# U. S. FIRMS OFFER CAREERS ABROAD – ADVENTURE, HARD WORK, GOOD SALARIES

### 
U.S. International companies have
broadened their horizons as they
search today for knowledgeable
young college graduates to send
abroad to manage their foreign bus
iness operations. Once they sought
men trained in business. Today (al
though it may come as a pleasant
shock to those who may have felt
hesitant about breaking into the
world of international commerce),
the companies are hiring liberal arts
graduates (with varied majors),
scientists, engineers, agriculturists,
pharmacists, and others as well as
graduates in business administration,
accounting, economics, and market
ing for careers abroad.
The appraising eyes of the re
cruiting representatives of most U.S.
international firms and government
agencies see a man as employable
if he has the proper attitude for an
overseas career, a general aptitude,
and, most important, an additional
year of practical training in foreign
trade techniques, in a spoken for
eign language, and in the social, cul
tural. and business aspects of the
world's marketing areas.

One of the world’s pre-eminent
authorities in the culture, economics,
and politics of Latin America. Dr.
William L. Schurz, director of the
area studies department of the far
famed American Institute for For
eign Trade in Phoenix, Arizona (and
author of the current, best-selling
Brazil, The Infinite Country), ob
serves that ‘the practice of foreign
trade is no longer a simple business
transaction to he conducted on a
‘main street’ overseas with the good
old American ‘hard sell'.”

"Nor is it a high-level operation
to be master-minded here at home
by theoreticians,” says Dr. Schurz,
a former Commerce Department
economist, “but an art to be prac
ticed by professionals preorienled
and specifically trained in the U.S.
before being thrust into a career
with private enterprise abroad.”
That means postgraduate satura
tion in the cult me, psychology, eco
nomics, politics, and social customs
of t

lobal marketing areas in
which U.S. companies are interested.
I lie art of foreign trade also de
mands practical training in the
modus operand! of international
commerce and a working knowledge
of a foreign language.

Recently, leafing through the
alumni file of the 16-year-old Amer
ican Institute for Foreign Trade, Dr.
Schurz, the “dean of Latin Ameri
canists’’ (who has probably trained
more young men for careers abroad
than any other living American)
singled out a group of typical AIFT
graduates who have already attained
executive status (president, vice pres
ident, director, general manager,
sales manager) with some U.S. inter
national firm.

From these cards, he selected sev
eral examples of the AIFT “success
story": one graduate, now vice presi
dent for all operations of a promi
nent U.S. soft drink company in the
Middle East (with his office in Beir
ut), started out by working for that
company in the Philippines, Aus
tralia, and Latin America; another,
now general manager of one of the
world’s best-known tire and rubber
company's operations in Italy, emi
grated some years ago from Italy,
was college-educated in the U.S. and
postgraduate-trained at The Ameri
can Institute for Foreign Trade, and
began his career at the foot of the
ladder; still another graduate, now
general manager for Western Europe
of a large American drug firm with
extensive foreign outlets (with head
quarters in Lisbon), got his start by
serving a long, fascinating appren
ticeship in the back country of Bra
zil, where he sold medicines and
drugs to village apothecaries out of
a jeep; another, who is president of
the International Trust Co. of Li

beria (in Monrovia); one, a recent
graduate who, in three years, has
risen to the sales managership of a
big U.S. steel company subsidiary in
Brazil (with offices in Sao Paulo);
another "Thunderbird” (as they are
widely known), now managing direc
tor of operations in Indonesia for
a familiar U.S. firm (with executive
offices in Djakarta), who (like many
another AIFT alumnus, has spoken
pridefully of the school) persuaded
a young Indonesian to enroll at the
Institute this fall and has just ar
ranged with the State Department
to send two influential Indonesian
trade executives to visit AIFT.

Dr. Schurz went on casually turn
ing up cards showing: an alumnus
who, after a few significant foreign
assignments, has become assistant
vice president for overseas person
nel of one of the biggest U.S. inter
national banks; another, who is pres
ident of all Peruvian operations of a
huge U.S. department store chain;
two alumni who are overseas gen
eral managers of two U.S. insurance
companies (one in Santiago, Chile;
the other in Bangkok, Thailand); a
graduate who heads a U.S. interna
tional bank branch in Tokyo; an
other, who is Latin American gen
eral manager for a large U.S. cos
metics company.

There are many more of equal
and lesser stature who arc actively
combatting the Communist econom
ic offensive abroad by setting an
example with their AILT - acquired
“know-how" of the functioning of
U.S. private enterprise abroad.
Senator Barry Goldwater, mem
ber of the Institute's board of di
rectors, in a recent speech on the
Senate floor applauded the major
role played by the more than 3.000
graduates of this young school in
the meteoric rise, of U.S. foreign
trade. Describing these alumni as
“America's best - trained and most
highly - respected body of goodwill
ambassadors,” he called The Ameri
can Institute “private industry's
training ground for its thousands of
junior and senior executives in 78
foreign nations."

Graduates in most branches of
liberal arts, business administration,
science, and engineering are sought
annually at AIFT by more than 500
L'.S, international businesses and
banks. The Institute’s sole place
ment problem appears to be its in
ability to fill the pressing demand
for engineers, accountants, chem
ists, and other technically - trained
college graduates with AIFT’s spe
cialized training for overseas oper
ations.

Cited by U.S. and foreign indus
trialists, educators, and government
officials as our most effective insti
tution for training college graduates
for international commerce, AIFT
offers a 3-part curriculum empha
sizing three general world areas;
modern foreign trade practices,
spoken languages (Spanish, Portu
guese, French), and living cultures
of the peoples in Latin and Central
America, the Far and Middle East,
and Western Europe.
About 300 carefully screened men

are graduated yearly. The postgrad
uate program lasts two semesters, a
new class starting both in January
and in September.
Industry and government officials
have been widely quoted as saying
that there is no institution of com
parable prestige for training in in
ternational commerce. Senator Gold
water predicts that most Americans
who become business leaders in
trade centers around the world in
the next few years will have been
trained '‘specifically at The Ameri
can Institute for Foreign Trade."
