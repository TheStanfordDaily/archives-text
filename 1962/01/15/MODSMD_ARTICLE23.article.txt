# Stuart Sees End For Castro Cuba
## 
### 
Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba
is doomed to fall, possibly within
the year, a leading Stanford au
thority on the science of govern
ment thinks.
Prof. Graham Stuart, professor
of political science emeritus, told
a Faculty Club audience that
Cubaâ€™s loss of its U.S. market for
tobacco and sugar will help bring
the Cuban nation to such a pitch
of economic distress that the
Cuban dictator might be over
thrown in protest.
Dr. Stuart, who retired in 1952,

has been a faculty member since
1923.
