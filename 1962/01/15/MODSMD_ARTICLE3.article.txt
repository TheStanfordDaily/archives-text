# HART STATES:
## Legal Limits to Moral Freedom Not Justified 
### 
By MIRK WAGGONER
H. L. A, Hart began a three
part defense of moral freedom
yesterday afternoon before a pre
dominantly adult audience in Me
morial Auditoi’ium.
Though dealing with morality
in general, he emphasized sexual
morality. His often subtle British
wit enlivened the lecture.
“Is it justified to use the crim
inal laws to enforce morality as
such?” Hart, a professor of juris
prudence at Oxford and a fre
quent visitor to our side of the
Atlantic, promises to give a rea
soned “No!” answer.
THE LECTURE series, spon
sored by the Harry Camp Memo
rial Fund, will essentially be a
defense of John Stuart Mill’s doc
trine that laws are justified in
adult society only to protect its
members from each other, and
not to enhance the members’ well
being or to promote a moral code.
Though he might have chosen
areas of welfare legislation, Hart

chose to emphasize sexual moral
ity. He did this as it is contro
versial, especially in Britain
where the recent Wolfendon Re
port advocated legalizing homo
sexuality, and as it is often not
a topic of polite American society.
Mill’s doctrine is currently in
question in Britain, but Hart ex
pressed shock at its absence here.
“Almost all save marital sexual
practices are outlawed in the
United States,” he said, “though I
do not know to what degree they
are enforced.”
YESTERDAY’S lecture laid the
ground work for Hart’s series. In
tomorrow’s evening lecture Hart
will deal with the arguments
against Mill in regard to polyg
amy and euthanasia and about
the danger to society of un
checked immorality.
Wednesday afternoon Hart will
examine the democratic aspects
of freedom—if there is popular
feeling for legislating a moral
code, is it justified?

ish legal system with Carter Harrison of the Committee on Public
Exercises.

prudence at Oxford and a fre
quent visitor to our side of the
Atlantic, promises to give a rea
soned “No!” answer.
THE LECTURE series, spon
sored by the Harry Camp Memo
rial Fund, will essentially be a
defense of John Stuart Mill’s doc
trine that laws are justified in
adult society only to protect its
members from each other, and
not to enhance the members’ well
being or to promote a moral code.
Though he might have chosen
areas of welfare legislation, Hart

chose to emphasize sexual moral
ity. He did this as it is contro
versial, especially in Britain
where the recent Wolfendon Re
port advocated legalizing homo
sexuality, and as it is often not
a topic of polite American society.
Mill’s doctrine is currently in
question in Britain, but Hart ex
pressed shock at its absence here.
“Almost all save marital sexual
practices are outlawed in the
United States,” he said, “though I
do not know to what degree they
are enforced.”
YESTERDAY’S lecture laid the
ground work for Hart’s series. In
tomorrow’s evening lecture Hart
will deal with the arguments
against Mill in regard to polyg
amy and euthanasia and about
the danger to society of un
checked immorality.
Wednesday afternoon Hart will
examine the democratic aspects
of freedom—if there is popular
feeling for legislating a moral
code, is it justified?


PROFESSOR HART, before his lecture yesterday, discussed the Brit
ish legal system with Carter Harrison of the Committee on Public
Exercises.
