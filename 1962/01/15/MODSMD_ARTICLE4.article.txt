by Gen. Victor Lundula battled savagely in the streets with out
numbered gendarmes loyal to pro-Communist Vice Premier An
toine Gizenga. Premier Cyrille Adoula said Landula, who was once

Gizenga’s right ■ hand man. “has

and day in the suburbs of Stan

camp after Landula’s troops used
mortar fire for the first time.
The mortar attack coincided
witht an .early morning confer
ence in Stanleyville between five
Gizengist gendarmes and Lan
dula, backed by U.N. civil repre
sentative Karl Englund and U.N.
Ethiopian Commander Colonel
Teshome.

NO UNITED NATIONS troops
were involved in this phase of the
civil war according to a U.N.
spokesman, although U.N. Secre

Ethiopians in the Stanleyville
area at the disposal of Lundula
who has sworn loyalty to the
central Congo regime.
Gizenga, once backed by the So
viet Union, w'as outnumbered
from the start. His gendarmerie
of 300 men faced 2.000 central
Congolese troops under Landula
armed with heavy mortars and
superior weapons. Apparently the
Ethiopians were not needed, al

force if necessary to restore law
and order and prevent civil war.

forces. It was not known if there
had been a major effort to seize

No fighting was reported from
the Katanga area.

ADOULA SAID the fighting
broke out when members of a
“Lumumbist youth” gang loyal to
Gizenga wont through the streets
of Stanleyville distributing pam
phlets calling for Landula’s ar
rest. Later, Gizenga gendarmes
tried to arrest Lundula and si
multaneously threw’ a protective
cordon around Gizenga’s home.
Gizenga was last reported hid

the banks of the Congo River.
But early yesterday 34 gen
