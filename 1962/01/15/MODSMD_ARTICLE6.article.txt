# Turn Toward Peace' Seeks Disarmament
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of two articles discussing
tlie National Peace Movement and Stanford's place in its organiza
tion and success.
In 1913, David Starr Jordan, then director of the World Peace
Foundation, stated, “What shall ye say of the Great War of Europe,
ever threatening, ever impending, and which never comes? We shall
say that it will never come. Humanly speaking, it is impossible.”
Impossible though it was, the war that Jordan and his Peace
Foundation sought to prevent did come. And 45 years later, his
words are still appropriate, and the idea of war as an institution
of national policy is as much a concern as ever.
Today a national movement which has gained the support of pro
fessors, students and concerned citizens all over the nation is about
to make its effect felt on the Farm. Last Wednesday Dr. Leo Szilard
called upon an enthusiastic Stanford audience in a packed Cubberley
Auditorium to join in a movement toward Peace.
“TURN TOWARD PEACE,” a national co-ordination movement
with the Peninsula Peace Center as its local representative, is bring-

ing together organizations of “la
bor, farmers, scientists, business
men, women, students, religious
organizations and public affairs
organizations” to “find alterna
tive policies which are not the
threat of war and are not surren
der. and to join their strength in
making these visible across the
country.”
Turn Toward Peace has taken
as its first action the composition
of a roster of all people in the
nation interested in working for
peace. All names on the national
roster will be turned over to the

local peace organization in an attempt to elicit action on four - fronts
from the signers:
• Write to the President,
• Encourage other groups to co-operate,
• Give support in the form of money, work, and time,
• Take part in at least one organization supporting Turn Toward
Peace. (There is currently an organization forming for this purpose
on the Stanford campus- “Non-Violent Action for Peace.” Its con
stitution was referred to Legislature’s By-Laws and Rules committee
last Thursday, and will be up for approval this Thursday. This or
ganization will be discussed in the second article of this series.)

A NAME CAN BE PLACED on the roster by contacting Turn
Toward Peace Roster, 20 South 121 h St„ Philadelphia 7. Pa., or the
Peninsula Peace Center, 529 Stanford Ave., Palo Alto, DA 1-2220.
Turn Toward Peace states as its final goal “multilateral agree
ment on a disarmed world under law, safe for free societies. . . .
Great emphasis would be laid on the idea that our message, Turn
Toward Peace, needs to reach the Communist world and can best do
so through a changed American policy.”
Emphasis is to be placed not merely on disarmament, but six
other areas as well: “1) growth toward world law, 2) developing a
sense of world community that can sustain world law', 3) economic
planning for disarmament, 4) the revolution of rising expectations,
5) reduction of political tensions, and 6) development of nonviolent
means of defending democratic values.”
In placing his name on the roster, a student signs a “Declaration
of Conscience and Responsibility” stating, “I oppose the present drift
toward war. I want a Turn Toward Peace. The United States should
set its own course in foreign relations and not merely react to the
threats or promises of the Soviet Union. The best defense against
Communism is the strengthening of our commitment to freedom and
democracy through measures consistent with those ideals.
“FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY could not survive nuclear war,
but they can flourish in peace. Personally, I believe we must Turn
Toward Peace. We must support the President in his appeal for total
and complete disarmament. We must strengthen the Unhod Nations.
Wo must develop world law. We must establish constructive non
military solutions for international conflict. The United States can
take initiatives for peace.”
One of the first activities to which Turn Toward Peace is lending
its support is a call for a national student-faculty demonstration in
Washington, D.C., which is to be held Friday, Feb. 16. The White
House, the Capitol and other government buildings will bo picketed
as policy statements are handed out. Also, a group of approximately
600 well-versed students will visit individually every Congressman
and Senator and 50 or so State Department and Executive officials
to present their positions. (Appointments have been made for this
activity.)
TA I'K'AL of the action for peace that is currently sweeping
throdugh the Bay Area is an “Open Letter to President Kennedy”
first printed in the New York Times, drafted by members of the
Harvard faculty and circulated among scholars and intellectuals in
the Boston area.
The Bay Area letter, soon to appear in San Francisco papers, was
sent around to faculty members who described it as criticizing “cer
tain aspects of the present civil defense program, and in particular
government encouragement for the construction of fallout shelters,
as a trend which “may be extremely dangerous to the nation and to
civilization itself.”

Emphasis is to be placed not merely on disarmament, but six
other areas as well: “1) growth toward world law, 2) developing a
sense of world community that can sustain world law', 3) economic
planning for disarmament, 4) the revolution of rising expectations,
5) reduction of political tensions, and 6) development of nonviolent
means of defending democratic values.”
In placing his name on the roster, a student signs a “Declaration
of Conscience and Responsibility” stating, “I oppose the present drift
toward war. I want a Turn Toward Peace. The United States should
set its own course in foreign relations and not merely react to the
threats or promises of the Soviet Union. The best defense against
Communism is the strengthening of our commitment to freedom and
democracy through measures consistent with those ideals.
“FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY could not survive nuclear war,
but they can flourish in peace. Personally, I believe we must Turn
Toward Peace. We must support the President in his appeal for total
and complete disarmament. We must strengthen the Unhod Nations.
Wo must develop world law. We must establish constructive non
military solutions for international conflict. The United States can
take initiatives for peace.”
One of the first activities to which Turn Toward Peace is lending
its support is a call for a national student-faculty demonstration in
Washington, D.C., which is to be held Friday, Feb. 16. The White
House, the Capitol and other government buildings will bo picketed
as policy statements are handed out. Also, a group of approximately
600 well-versed students will visit individually every Congressman
and Senator and 50 or so State Department and Executive officials
to present their positions. (Appointments have been made for this
activity.)
TA I'K'AL of the action for peace that is currently sweeping
throdugh the Bay Area is an “Open Letter to President Kennedy”
first printed in the New York Times, drafted by members of the
Harvard faculty and circulated among scholars and intellectuals in
the Boston area.
The Bay Area letter, soon to appear in San Francisco papers, was
sent around to faculty members who described it as criticizing “cer
tain aspects of the present civil defense program, and in particular
government encouragement for the construction of fallout shelters,
as a trend which “may be extremely dangerous to the nation and to
civilization itself.”

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of two articles discussing
tlie National Peace Movement and Stanford's place in its organiza
tion and success.
In 1913, David Starr Jordan, then director of the World Peace
Foundation, stated, “What shall ye say of the Great War of Europe,
ever threatening, ever impending, and which never comes? We shall
say that it will never come. Humanly speaking, it is impossible.”
Impossible though it was, the war that Jordan and his Peace
Foundation sought to prevent did come. And 45 years later, his
words are still appropriate, and the idea of war as an institution
of national policy is as much a concern as ever.
Today a national movement which has gained the support of pro
fessors, students and concerned citizens all over the nation is about
to make its effect felt on the Farm. Last Wednesday Dr. Leo Szilard
called upon an enthusiastic Stanford audience in a packed Cubberley
Auditorium to join in a movement toward Peace.
“TURN TOWARD PEACE,” a national co-ordination movement
with the Peninsula Peace Center as its local representative, is bring-

ing together organizations of “la
bor, farmers, scientists, business
men, women, students, religious
organizations and public affairs
organizations” to “find alterna
tive policies which are not the
threat of war and are not surren
der. and to join their strength in
making these visible across the
country.”
Turn Toward Peace has taken
as its first action the composition
of a roster of all people in the
nation interested in working for
peace. All names on the national
roster will be turned over to the

local peace organization in an attempt to elicit action on four - fronts
from the signers:
• Write to the President,
• Encourage other groups to co-operate,
• Give support in the form of money, work, and time,
• Take part in at least one organization supporting Turn Toward
Peace. (There is currently an organization forming for this purpose
on the Stanford campus- “Non-Violent Action for Peace.” Its con
stitution was referred to Legislature’s By-Laws and Rules committee
last Thursday, and will be up for approval this Thursday. This or
ganization will be discussed in the second article of this series.)

A NAME CAN BE PLACED on the roster by contacting Turn
Toward Peace Roster, 20 South 121 h St„ Philadelphia 7. Pa., or the
Peninsula Peace Center, 529 Stanford Ave., Palo Alto, DA 1-2220.
Turn Toward Peace states as its final goal “multilateral agree
ment on a disarmed world under law, safe for free societies. . . .
Great emphasis would be laid on the idea that our message, Turn
Toward Peace, needs to reach the Communist world and can best do
so through a changed American policy.”
Emphasis is to be placed not merely on disarmament, but six
other areas as well: “1) growth toward world law, 2) developing a

Impossible though it was, the war that Jordan and his Peace
Foundation sought to prevent did come. And 45 years later, his
words are still appropriate, and the idea of war as an institution
of national policy is as much a concern as ever.
Today a national movement which has gained the support of pro
fessors, students and concerned citizens all over the nation is about
to make its effect felt on the Farm. Last Wednesday Dr. Leo Szilard
called upon an enthusiastic Stanford audience in a packed Cubberley
Auditorium to join in a movement toward Peace.
“TURN TOWARD PEACE,” a national co-ordination movement
with the Peninsula Peace Center as its local representative, is bring-

ing together organizations of “la
bor, farmers, scientists, business
men, women, students, religious
organizations and public affairs
organizations” to “find alterna
tive policies which are not the
threat of war and are not surren
der. and to join their strength in
making these visible across the
country.”
Turn Toward Peace has taken
as its first action the composition
of a roster of all people in the
nation interested in working for
peace. All names on the national
roster will be turned over to the

local peace organization in an attempt to elicit action on four - fronts
from the signers:
• Write to the President,
• Encourage other groups to co-operate,
• Give support in the form of money, work, and time,
• Take part in at least one organization supporting Turn Toward
Peace. (There is currently an organization forming for this purpose
on the Stanford campus- “Non-Violent Action for Peace.” Its con
stitution was referred to Legislature’s By-Laws and Rules committee
last Thursday, and will be up for approval this Thursday. This or
ganization will be discussed in the second article of this series.)

A NAME CAN BE PLACED on the roster by contacting Turn
Toward Peace Roster, 20 South 121 h St„ Philadelphia 7. Pa., or the
Peninsula Peace Center, 529 Stanford Ave., Palo Alto, DA 1-2220.
Turn Toward Peace states as its final goal “multilateral agree
ment on a disarmed world under law, safe for free societies. . . .
Great emphasis would be laid on the idea that our message, Turn
Toward Peace, needs to reach the Communist world and can best do
so through a changed American policy.”
Emphasis is to be placed not merely on disarmament, but six
other areas as well: “1) growth toward world law, 2) developing a
sense of world community that can sustain world law', 3) economic
planning for disarmament, 4) the revolution of rising expectations,
5) reduction of political tensions, and 6) development of nonviolent
means of defending democratic values.”
In placing his name on the roster, a student signs a “Declaration
of Conscience and Responsibility” stating, “I oppose the present drift
toward war. I want a Turn Toward Peace. The United States should
set its own course in foreign relations and not merely react to the
threats or promises of the Soviet Union. The best defense against
Communism is the strengthening of our commitment to freedom and
democracy through measures consistent with those ideals.
“FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY could not survive nuclear war,
but they can flourish in peace. Personally, I believe we must Turn
Toward Peace. We must support the President in his appeal for total
and complete disarmament. We must strengthen the Unhod Nations.
Wo must develop world law. We must establish constructive non
military solutions for international conflict. The United States can
take initiatives for peace.”
One of the first activities to which Turn Toward Peace is lending
its support is a call for a national student-faculty demonstration in
Washington, D.C., which is to be held Friday, Feb. 16. The White
House, the Capitol and other government buildings will bo picketed
as policy statements are handed out. Also, a group of approximately
600 well-versed students will visit individually every Congressman
and Senator and 50 or so State Department and Executive officials
to present their positions. (Appointments have been made for this
activity.)
TA I'K'AL of the action for peace that is currently sweeping
throdugh the Bay Area is an “Open Letter to President Kennedy”
first printed in the New York Times, drafted by members of the
Harvard faculty and circulated among scholars and intellectuals in
the Boston area.
The Bay Area letter, soon to appear in San Francisco papers, was
sent around to faculty members who described it as criticizing “cer
tain aspects of the present civil defense program, and in particular
government encouragement for the construction of fallout shelters,
as a trend which “may be extremely dangerous to the nation and to
civilization itself.”
