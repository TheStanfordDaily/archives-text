## Algeria on Brink of War 
### 
ALGIERS (UPI) Commandos of the outlawed Secret Army
Organization (OAS) killed seven Moslems and wounded 20 others
yesterday in a machinegun and hand grenade attack on a Moslem
cafe that touched off angry Moslem mob demonstrations. Algeria
was so close to open civil war between European settlers and the

Moslem majority that Roman-1
Catholic Archbishop Leon
Duval appealed in a special radio
television address for special
prayers to save Algeria in its
“grave hours.”
THE VIOLENCE extended to
France itself. Six plastic bombs
exploded across the nation Satur
day night and early yesterday.
One of the bombs damaged the
home of Gaullist National Assem

to a halt in front of the Cafe of
Hope in an Algiers suburb, burst
into the cafe and sprayed ma
chine fire at Moslems standing at
a bar in the back. They hurled
hand grenades and fled.
After the attack, a mob of an
gry Moslems gathered in the
streets and hurled stones at pass
ing European cars. Security
forces rushed to the scene and
were met with a hail of rocks.
Three more truckloads of secu
rity forces and troops finally re
stored order.

BUT I,AST NIGHT hundreds
of other Moslems staged noisy
demonstrations in two Algiers
suburbs. They appeared on the
streets with such suddenness that
the dangerous situation in Alge
ria’s cities was made all too evi
dent.

Three separate groups of Mos
lems, each about 300 strong,
surged through the streets of the
Beicourt and Clos Salembier
workers’ suburbs yelling “Alge
rian Algeria’’ and other national
ist slogans. An hour and a half
later riot police dispersed the
mobs without incident.
OTHER VIOLENCE was re
ported from one end of Algeria
to the other, and authorities re
ported a constantly growing toll
of dead and wounded. They said
since the first of the year 217
persons have been killed and 454
wounded by acts of terrorism.
Another grenade attack against
a Moslem cafe was reported yes
terday afternoon in Constantine
in eastern Algeria. OAS terror
ists threw hand grenades into a
