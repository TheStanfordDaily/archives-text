Washington
riddled with leftists
says Goldwater
According to Barry Goldwater, 37
key Washington jobs are held by
members of a “strange organize
tion’’—a leftist group that wields
great power. In this week's Post,
Senator Goldwater lashes out at
left-wing extremists. And tells how
their ideas play “right into the
hands of the Kremlin."
