(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is
the last, in a series of articles
devoted to the national peace
movement and its manifesta
tions at Stanford )
At a time when I lie peace move
ment is bursting into nationwide
action, with main support from
university students and profes
sors. a Stanford group “Non-
Violent Action for Peace” - has
filed a constitution for LASSU
approval as a compus organiza
tion.
The constitution, after having
boon referred to the Legislature’s
Laws and By - Laws Committee
last week, will bo brought up for
approval at this Thursday’s meet
ing.
THE STANFORD campus is
rapidly being thrust into a posi
tion of activity in peace move
ments by the existence of such
groups as “Acts for Peace” in
Berkeley (“to achieve continuing
coordinated peace education and
action in Northern California
communities”), the Peninsula
Peace Center in Palo Alto, and
now the formation of a campus
group.

Non - Violent Action for Peace
describes itself as “a non-political
organization which believes a fun
damental change is necessary in
public opinion if humanity is to
survive. It shall act from the po
sition that war is not a rational
instrument of international pol
icy, that peace cannot be gained
through armaments, and that war
must be replaced by an active and
creative peace achieved through
non-violent means.
“THE ORGANIZATION will
sponsor informative activities for
the Stanford community, such as
talks, debates, and discussions in
quest of non violent alternatives
to war. It intends to engage in
practical non - violent action for
world disarmament.”

The group intends to pursue
action for peace on a multitude of
fronts: in addition to considera
tion of disarmament and war
problems, they plan to deal with
civil rights movements in the
South.

They are united not by a policy
stand, but by a philosophical ap
proach, the approach of non-vio
lence, first outlined by Ghandi in
his “War Without Violence”—the
philosophy that has guided the
sit-in demonstrators and freedom
riders in the South.
Non-Violent Action for Peace
feels it comes in answer to the
quickly developing concern in the
Stanford community with prob
lems of peace. Various independ
ently formed faculty seminars on
the disarmament peace question,
campus reaction to the call to ac
tion of Dr. Leo Szilard in his cam
pus address last week, and the
plans of the activating Peninsula
Peace Center were cited as ex
amples of this interest.
The group takes with it to Leg
islature letters from several Stan
ford faculty members, including
representatives from the English,
History, and Physics depart
ments. among others, recom
mending that Non-Violent. Action
for Peace be permitted to organ
ize as a campus organization.
