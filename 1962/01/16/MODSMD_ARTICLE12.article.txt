## Szilard Suggests a New Plan of Political Action 
### WILLIAM B. WOOD 
“I believe that our chances of
getting through the next 10 years
without war are slim,” Leo Szi
lard told his Stanford audience
last Wednesday night. ‘‘l find
myself in rebellion against the
fate that history seems to have
in store for us, and I suspect that
some of you may be equally re
bellious. The question is, what
can you do?"
Confronted with the political
power of the various interest
groups who favor increasing ar
maments and civil defense meas
ures, concerned individuals
throughout the country have long
been troubled by this question.
Lack of an answer has led to a
general feeling of helplessness
and a resort to demonstrations,
marches and other forms of pas
sive dissent, negative reactions
whose principal effect has been
only to equate desire for peace
with suspicious political leanings
in the minds of a few irrational
patriots.
Szilard, in answer to the above
question, proposes a plan for pos
itive action which would, for the
first time, unite the scattered
scientists, academicians, and con
cerned individuals “who see cur
rent events in their historical
perspective” into an effective po
litical movement, dedicated to ter
minating the unlimited arms race,
instituting a workable agreement
on arms control and eventually
removing entirely the danger of
an unwanted atomic war.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
from members pledging a small
percentage of their yearly in
come would provide the means to
operate a lobby or pressure group
in Washington in pursuit of the
movement’s immediate political
objectives. These would be for
mulated by a council of scien
tists, a board of political advis
ers and a research organization.
Through these various groups,
the movement could provide to
members of the administration
not only informed opinions, but
also tangible support in the form
of votes and funds for political
action.

Such a program would not only
be highly desirable, but might
also be feasible and quite suc
cessful. Feasible, because Szilard
is not seeking to convert anyone;
he wishes merely to provide an
opportunity to be heard and felt
in Washington for those who al
ready share his convictions. He
believes that an effective pro
gram could be set up with the
dedicated support of only one
hundred to two hundred thousand

contributing individuals. Success
ful, because it would operate po
litically, at the level of the fed
eral government where policy de
cisions arc made, and in a man
ner which has proven to be one of
the most effective in getting re
sults out of our administrative
machinery.
If Szilard’s program is insti
tuted, he will become, at most, no
more than a member of the sci
entists’ council. Enthusiasm for
his plan therefore by no means
requires agreement with all of
his opinions and personally fa
vored political objectives. These,
regardless of their merit, should
not be allowed to divert attention
from his most important and im
mediate aim: that of giving a
place and a voice in Washington
to a concerned minority of Amer
icans who up to now have had
little success in halting our
steady progress toward an atomic
clash.

Szilard points out that the
chances for a controlled disarma
ment will rapidly diminish as pos
session of nuclear weapons be
comes more widespread. He has
a sincere conviction that this mi
nority must waste no time in
making itself heard.
IN ADDITION, he appears to
have a practical plan by which it
might do so, and the contacts in
Washington to put the plan into
effect. His program could lead to
tangible results which will never
be achieved by all-night vigils in
public places or marches across
continents. It is a first opportu
nity for concerned individuals in
this university and across the
country to initiate positive action
which might eventually save us
from a nuclear catastrophe. This
plan deserves now, in its experi
mental stage, the strong support
of the Stanford community.

(NOTE: For those who did
not hear Szilard's speech, lie is
now in the process of conduct
ing an “experiment” in a few
selected university communi
ties, urging interested students
to assist him by contacting ad
ult members of the community
during the next few weeks and
sending (he names of those
who wish to pledge support of
the program to Leo Szilard, Ho
tel Dupont Plaza, Washington
6, D.C. From the magnitude of
the response, he hopes to esti
mate how soon and to what ex
tent his plan could be put into
effect. Additional information

night speech can be obtained by

“I believe that our chances of
getting through the next 10 years
without war are slim,” Leo Szi
lard told his Stanford audience
last Wednesday night. ‘‘l find
myself in rebellion against the
fate that history seems to have
in store for us, and I suspect that
some of you may be equally re
bellious. The question is, what
can you do?"
Confronted with the political
power of the various interest
groups who favor increasing ar
maments and civil defense meas
ures, concerned individuals
throughout the country have long
been troubled by this question.
Lack of an answer has led to a
general feeling of helplessness
and a resort to demonstrations,
marches and other forms of pas
sive dissent, negative reactions
whose principal effect has been
only to equate desire for peace
with suspicious political leanings
in the minds of a few irrational
patriots.
Szilard, in answer to the above
question, proposes a plan for pos
itive action which would, for the
first time, unite the scattered
scientists, academicians, and con
cerned individuals “who see cur
rent events in their historical
perspective” into an effective po
litical movement, dedicated to ter
minating the unlimited arms race,
instituting a workable agreement
on arms control and eventually
removing entirely the danger of
an unwanted atomic war.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
from members pledging a small
percentage of their yearly in
come would provide the means to
operate a lobby or pressure group
in Washington in pursuit of the
movement’s immediate political
objectives. These would be for
mulated by a council of scien
tists, a board of political advis
ers and a research organization.
Through these various groups,
the movement could provide to
members of the administration
not only informed opinions, but
also tangible support in the form
of votes and funds for political
action.

Such a program would not only
be highly desirable, but might
also be feasible and quite suc
cessful. Feasible, because Szilard
is not seeking to convert anyone;
he wishes merely to provide an
opportunity to be heard and felt
in Washington for those who al
ready share his convictions. He
believes that an effective pro
gram could be set up with the
dedicated support of only one
hundred to two hundred thousand

contributing individuals. Success
ful, because it would operate po
litically, at the level of the fed
eral government where policy de
cisions arc made, and in a man
ner which has proven to be one of
the most effective in getting re
sults out of our administrative
machinery.
If Szilard’s program is insti
tuted, he will become, at most, no
more than a member of the sci
entists’ council. Enthusiasm for
his plan therefore by no means
requires agreement with all of
his opinions and personally fa
vored political objectives. These,
regardless of their merit, should
not be allowed to divert attention
from his most important and im
mediate aim: that of giving a
place and a voice in Washington
to a concerned minority of Amer
icans who up to now have had
little success in halting our
steady progress toward an atomic
clash.

Szilard points out that the
chances for a controlled disarma
ment will rapidly diminish as pos
session of nuclear weapons be
comes more widespread. He has
a sincere conviction that this mi
nority must waste no time in
making itself heard.
IN ADDITION, he appears to
have a practical plan by which it
might do so, and the contacts in
Washington to put the plan into
effect. His program could lead to
tangible results which will never
be achieved by all-night vigils in
public places or marches across
continents. It is a first opportu
nity for concerned individuals in
this university and across the
country to initiate positive action
which might eventually save us
from a nuclear catastrophe. This
plan deserves now, in its experi
mental stage, the strong support
of the Stanford community.

tangible results which will never
be achieved by all-night vigils in
public places or marches across
continents. It is a first opportu
nity for concerned individuals in
this university and across the
country to initiate positive action
which might eventually save us
from a nuclear catastrophe. This
plan deserves now, in its experi
mental stage, the strong support
of the Stanford community.

“I believe that our chances of
getting through the next 10 years
without war are slim,” Leo Szi
lard told his Stanford audience
last Wednesday night. ‘‘l find
myself in rebellion against the
fate that history seems to have
in store for us, and I suspect that
some of you may be equally re
bellious. The question is, what
can you do?"
Confronted with the political
power of the various interest
groups who favor increasing ar
maments and civil defense meas
ures, concerned individuals
throughout the country have long
been troubled by this question.
Lack of an answer has led to a
general feeling of helplessness
and a resort to demonstrations,
marches and other forms of pas
sive dissent, negative reactions
whose principal effect has been
only to equate desire for peace
with suspicious political leanings
in the minds of a few irrational
patriots.
Szilard, in answer to the above
question, proposes a plan for pos
itive action which would, for the
first time, unite the scattered
scientists, academicians, and con
cerned individuals “who see cur
rent events in their historical
perspective” into an effective po
litical movement, dedicated to ter
minating the unlimited arms race,
instituting a workable agreement
on arms control and eventually
removing entirely the danger of
an unwanted atomic war.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
from members pledging a small
percentage of their yearly in
come would provide the means to
operate a lobby or pressure group
in Washington in pursuit of the
movement’s immediate political
objectives. These would be for
mulated by a council of scien
tists, a board of political advis
ers and a research organization.
Through these various groups,
the movement could provide to
members of the administration
not only informed opinions, but
also tangible support in the form
of votes and funds for political
action.

Such a program would not only
be highly desirable, but might
also be feasible and quite suc
cessful. Feasible, because Szilard
is not seeking to convert anyone;
he wishes merely to provide an
opportunity to be heard and felt
in Washington for those who al
ready share his convictions. He
believes that an effective pro
gram could be set up with the
dedicated support of only one
hundred to two hundred thousand

contributing individuals. Success
ful, because it would operate po
litically, at the level of the fed
eral government where policy de
cisions arc made, and in a man
ner which has proven to be one of
the most effective in getting re
sults out of our administrative
machinery.
If Szilard’s program is insti
tuted, he will become, at most, no
more than a member of the sci
entists’ council. Enthusiasm for
his plan therefore by no means
requires agreement with all of
his opinions and personally fa
vored political objectives. These,
regardless of their merit, should
not be allowed to divert attention
from his most important and im
mediate aim: that of giving a
place and a voice in Washington
to a concerned minority of Amer
icans who up to now have had
little success in halting our
steady progress toward an atomic
clash.

Szilard points out that the
chances for a controlled disarma
ment will rapidly diminish as pos
session of nuclear weapons be
comes more widespread. He has
a sincere conviction that this mi
nority must waste no time in
making itself heard.
IN ADDITION, he appears to
have a practical plan by which it
might do so, and the contacts in
Washington to put the plan into
effect. His program could lead to
tangible results which will never
be achieved by all-night vigils in
public places or marches across
