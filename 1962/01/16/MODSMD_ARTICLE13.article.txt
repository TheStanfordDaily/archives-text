WINDS OF FREEDOM
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Ketchum’s informants
were wrong. No questions relat
ing to Stanford Today and To
morrow were rejected or with
held from President Sterling.
Among the questions submitted
by the chairman of the ST&T
Committee in December were:
1. How many students become
“ditch diggers”?
2. How many enter profession
al fields?
3. How many go to a graduate
school?
4. How many become teachers?
5. How many Stanford women
marry Stanford men?
A second list of questions was
submitted by the ST&T Commit
tee on January 5. These ques
tions (including "Do the Winds
of Freedom really blow at Stan
ford?”) not only went to the
president but were discussed at a
briefing session on January 8 for
faculty participants in the ST&T
program. A Daily reporter was
present at that meeting.
President Sterling has spoken
his views on the subject of free
dom at Stanford on innumerable
occasions and not least effective
ly, we thought, when he ad
dressed the student body just last
November 6. His ST&T speech in
Memorial Auditorium a year ago
emphasized not only the tradi
tional freedom we cherish in this
University but the responsibility
that goes with it. He chose to
speak on other matters this time.
That’s all.

If there is doubt among stu
dents that the Winds really blow,
then the basis for their doubt
should be made known. If the
basis is no closer to fact than the
hearsay Mr. Ketchum used to in
troduce his opinions in Monday’s
Daily, then that, too, should be
made known.
If some evil force begins to di
vert the Winds of Freedom from
Stanford, the faculty will know
about it. Mr. Ketchum may be
certain of that! The faculty
speakers in this year’s ST&T pro
gram were all capable of discuss
ing freedom at Stanford out of
their own experience without as
sistance from the President’s
staff or anyone else. However,
we did supply them with copies
of the Annual Financial Report
and some additional data on Uni
versity finance. If Mr. Ketchum
had asked the speaker at the
ST&T session he attended his
question about how much of the
budget supports engineering, sci
ence, and the humanities, he
could have learned that the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences spent $4,560,668 for instruc
tion and departmental research
in 1960-61, and that the School of
Engineering spent $1,272,065. In
organized research, however,
which is completely supported by
funds from outside the Univer
sity, the School of Engineering
spent $4,319,085, while the School
of Humanities and Sciences spent
$2,031,471.
