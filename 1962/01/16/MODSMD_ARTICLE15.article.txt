## The
						Congo and the U.N. 
### 
The bloody business in Ka
tanga dramatizes the grave issue
which is now before the United
Nations. The issue is whether it
shall revert to being merely “a
conference machinery," as Dag
Hammarskjold put it, or shall be
also a tentative venture in inter
national government.
The intervention of the U.N. as
law and order collapsed in the
newly independent Belgian Congo
was a bold attempt to fill a dan
gerous vacuum. When the inter
vention was decided upon, there
was no visible alternative to mul
tiple intervention by the various
powers concerned, which included
not only Belgium, France, and
Great Britain but also the Soviet
Union and the United States.
However badly the U.N. interven
tion has gone, it can be said, it
probably will be said in retro
spect, that the alternative would
have been much worse.
Nevertheless, the intervention
has worked badly, and the reason
is that it has never had the sup
port of the great powers. The
U.N. is not a world government.
It is and always has been an as
sociation of national governments
in which the most powerful ones
have a veto on action. They have
a recognized and legalized veto
because in fact they have the
power to obstruct decisively. This
veto, which means that the U.N.
can act only with the unanimous
consent of the great powers, is
the inner principle of the U.N.
This principle distinguishes the
U.N. from a world government.
DAG HAMMARSKJOLD’S bold
experiment, which worked suc
cessfully enough on a small and
unobtrusive scale in Palestine
and in Laos, never had the full
support of any government ex
cept to a considerable degree that
of the United States. The U.N.
action in the Congo aroused the
implacable hostility of the Soviet
Union. For all practical proposes,
also, the U.N. has been opposed,
ndt supported, by France, Great
Britain and Belgium. It is the di
vision of the great powers in the

Congo affair which underlies the
conflicts in the Congo. For were
the great powers united, the U.N.
could impose law and order in
stead of having to fight a series
of indecisive skirmishes.

The Soviet opposition to the
Hammarskjold experiment took
the form of an attack on the per
son of the Secretary General and
on the structure of his office. In
Soviet eyes Hammarskjold had
circumvented the veto by admin
istrative action in the Congo, and
the celebrated troika proposal
was put forward as a device to
introduce the veto into the office
of the Secretary General. But
that was not all. The Soviet Un
ion took the position that, since it
disapproved of the Congo opera
tion, it would not pay its share of
the cost. This was a demonstra
tion that a great power, whether
or not it openly exercises a veto,
has the inherent power to frus
trate actions which it disapproves
of.

IN THE BUDGETARY discus
sion in the U.N. the French gov
ernment has taken the same po
sition as the Soviet Union. It does
not approve of the Congo opera
tion, therefore it will not help to
pay for it. If this became the
general rule of the U.N., no gov
ernment would ever vote for any
thing unless it was prepared to
pay not only its share but also
the share of those who vote
against the proposition.
The combined effect of the
U.N. policies of Mr. Khrushchev
and Gen. de Gaulle is in sub
stance to eliminate from the com
petence of the U.N. all executive
action to pacify areas of disorder.
The U.N. would remain as a
grand piece of conference ma
chinery capable of debating and
mediating for peace but, except
in some rare cases where the
great powers are unanimous, in
capable of enforcing peace. Ham
marskjold’s experiment would be
a dream and a memory, like
Camelot.

If this is the way it is, then we
shall all of us have to face the

problem of how to contrive in the
unworkable situation in the Con
go something that will work. It
is not easy to see what that
could be, and it is not being made
any easier for the responsible
powers by the grand abstainers in
Moscow and in Paris.
