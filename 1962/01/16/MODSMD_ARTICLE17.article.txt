Edmunds; 157, Jon Kay; 167,
Steve Meecham; 177, Steve Sears;
heavyweight, Duncan Ross or Joe
Rieke.
The team lacks a man in the
123-pound division, and coach Mc-

one interested in wrestling who
falls in that weight category to
turn out. As of now the team
must forfeit the match in that
division if its opponent has a man
at that weight.
Last year’s record of five wins

and four losses should be im
proved upon, according to Mc-
Kenna. The 'G2 squad has three
lettermen back and is stronger at
the other positions. Lee Stephen-
I son,, Duncan Ross, and Frank
! Redle are all experienced wres
tlers and form the nucleus of the
team.
THE STARTING lineup will be
identical for the Cal Poly match,
except that Redle will probably
wrestle in the 177-pound division.
