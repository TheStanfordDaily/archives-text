# Grad Student Flunks with 2.3, Says Stanford Unfair—Pickets
## 
### 
A Turkish electrical engineer
ing student who flunked out of
the graduate program because he
didn’t have a 3.0 grade point av
erage is picketing at University
Ave. and El Camino Real because
he says the University is unfair
in its requirements.
Allan Turel, 32. 293 Dunster
Dr„ Campbell, who says ho has
about a 2.3 over-all grade point
average, maintains that the 3.0
average is necessary only to get

the M.S. degree and that he could
still bring his final average up to
that level.

Turel said he will picket every
day this week during rush hours,
from noon to 12:30 and from 4:30
to 5:30 p.m., at the University en
trance in the hope that publicity
will force Stanford officials to
reconsider. He carries a sign
saying “Stop Unfair Policy at
Stanford University.”
Turel, from Ankara, Turkey,
said ho came to Stanford in 1937
on a Fulbright scholarship but
left after three quarters to take
a job with Boeing Aircraft until
he could save enough money to
continue. He worked for Boeing a
year and a half in Seattle and
then with IBM in San Jose but
failed to qualify for their Honors
Cooperative Program.
After a year he went to work
for Kaiser Aircraft and Electron
ics and last fall registered for six
units at Stanford while working
a 40-hour week. He got a B in
one course and a C in another
and asked for an 11 weeks’ leave
of absence so he could attend full
time this quarter.
Turel said he was told that he
could not register because of last
quarter’s grades and that the de
partment could not recommend
him for the Master’s degree. He
admitted he would have to get
practically straight A’s to finish
his program with a 3.0 average
but said there was no rule that
one couldn’t continue taking
units.

“Nobody is in a position to pre
dict the degree of my future
work as long as there is a mathe
matical and practical possibility,”
he contended.

Turel is married to an Ameri
can citizen and has a one-year-old
son. He said he was granted per
manent residence in 1959 and will
become a U.S. citizen in Decem
ber.

Turel said he would apply at
the University of Santa Clara if
he can’t make Stanford see things
his way.

a 40-hour week. He got a B in
one course and a C in another
and asked for an 11 weeks’ leave
of absence so he could attend full
time this quarter.
Turel said he was told that he
could not register because of last
quarter’s grades and that the de
partment could not recommend
him for the Master’s degree. He
admitted he would have to get
practically straight A’s to finish
his program with a 3.0 average
but said there was no rule that
one couldn’t continue taking
units.

“Nobody is in a position to pre
dict the degree of my future
work as long as there is a mathe
matical and practical possibility,”
he contended.

Turel is married to an Ameri
can citizen and has a one-year-old
son. He said he was granted per
manent residence in 1959 and will
become a U.S. citizen in Decem
ber.

Turel said he would apply at
the University of Santa Clara if
he can’t make Stanford see things
his way.
