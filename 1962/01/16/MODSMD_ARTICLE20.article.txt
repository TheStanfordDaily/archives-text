# TRIBE GUARD CO-PLAYER OF WEEK
## Darrell Sutherland Honored by Basketball Writers, SU Coach 
### PETE KING 
Darrell Sutherland, junior
guard for Stanford’s basket hall
team, was honored yesterday as
player of the week by the North
ern California Basketball Writ
ers’ Association at its weekly
luncheon.

Sutherland shared the honor
with two other local standouts.
Joe Braun, star center for San
Jose State, and Bob Gaillard of
USF were also named as last
week’s most outstanding players.
Sutherland almost singlehand
edly ruined the Cal Bears in the
first half of last Friday’s game at
Stanford’s Pavilion. He scored
five straight field goals in the
opening minutes and racked up
18 points for the night’s work.
HOWIE DALLMAB, Indian
coach, and Rene Herrerias, head
man for the Cal squad, were pres
ent at the luncheon. Dallmar had
plenty of praise for the hard
working Sutherland. “He hits
great moves and provides just
the leadership we need,” Dallmar
remarked. “He’s not the kind of
player we want to restrict too
much.”

Both Dallmar and Herrerias
commented freely on Friday's
game. Heneerias, loser by a 32-
point margin, understandably
lacked enthusiasm. "Last Friday
and Saturday nights were like
going to a horror movie,” stated
Herrerias. “Stanford’s defense
played real well against us.” He
also predicted that the Indians
would be a “real contender” for
the Big Five title, although de
clining to make further predic
tions until the conference was
well under way.
DALLMAR HAD accolades for
Card forward John Windsor, who
broke loose for 20 points aaginst
Cal. “The game was a good one
for us. Windsor took over in the

second half and helped out. but
we ran into foul trouble,” men
tioned Dallmar.

This was the second consecu
tive week that a Stanford player
has been named player of the
week. Indian center Tom Dose
got the nod at last week’s lunch
eon after his performance against
Oregon.

The Stanford victory put the
Cards in second place in the
A.A.W.U. standings with a 1-0
mark. UCLA leads the field, hav
ing won all three of its games.


HOT-SHOOTING STANFORD guard Darrell Sutherland, picked as
player of the week along with San Jose State's center Joe Braun
and Bob Gaillard of USF.
