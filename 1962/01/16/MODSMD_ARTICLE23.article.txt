### 
Tau Beta Pi, honorary engi
neering fraternity, will sponsor a
series of four one-hour lectures
designed to introduce the engi
neering or physics student to the
basic vector operations with two
and three-dimensional vectors.
The geometric nature of vec
tors will be stressed in order to
indicate the economy and utility
of vector notation in the mathe
matical analysis of physical prob
lems. The course will meet on
Wednesday nights starting Jan.
17, at 7 o’clock in Room 91A.
The instructor will be Geoff
Ball, now working for his doctor
ate in electrical engineering.
