BERLIN (UPD—The East Ger
man Communists yesterday un
expectedly released two Califor
nia youths arrested four months
ago for trying to smuggle an
East Berlin girl to freedom in the
trunk of their car. The boys
blamed their troubles on chivalry.

The youths were Victor Pan
key, 18, and Gilbert Ferry, 20,
both of Tustin, Calif. They were
released yesterday when Victor’s
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Pan
key, went to East Berlin to visit
them in jail with Ferrey’s moth
er.

THE COMMUNISTS still hold
another American, Frederic Pry
or, 28. a Yale University graduate
of Ann Arbor, Mich., who disap
peared on a trip to East Berlin
shortly after the East-West Ber
lin border was closed Aug. 13.
The Communists have hinted he
was arrested on spy charges.
Pankey and Ferrey were ar
rested Sept. 8 and sentenced Sept.
26 to two years’ imprisonment
for trying to smuggle out the
East Berlin girl. The Commu
nists said yesterday they wore
released as “an act of mercy” by
East German Communist leader
Walter Ulbricht.
PANKEY AND FERREY met
the press in a West Berlin hotel
after they had a bath and a “good
meal.” Their story pictured them
as the victims of a chivalrous im
pulse that began when they met
the girl in East Berlin and she
appealed to them to smuggle her
to the West.

Ferrey said they did not blame
the girl but told the Communist
interrogators “it was the idea of
all three of us.” He said they
were sure the girl was “not a
plant” and that they were told
yesterday she was still in prison.
"The girl appealed to us to get
her to West Berlin and we
agreed,” Ferrey said. “She told
us her father was dead and her
mother lived in West Berlin. Wo
broke an East German law by
trying to smuggle the girl out,
but we are sure we did the hu
manitarian thing.”
They said she was 22 but did
not give her name. Communist
border guards arrested them as
they reached the Friedrichstras.se
crossing point at the East-West
border.
