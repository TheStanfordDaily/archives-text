# Moscow University Rivals Stanford
## 
### 
Friendship University in Moscow has become Stanford’s inter
national rival in the world-wide quest for college teachers, according
to Dean Ernest C. Arbuckle of the Graduate School of Business.

Arbuckle recently returned from a world-wide trip to help select
the first class of teachers to participate in Stanford’s new Inter
national Center for the Advancement of Management Education
(ICAME).
• So far, he reports, the Russians have been “much more effective”
than the U.S. in providing educational opportunities for leading for
eign scholars from newly developing nations.
“They’re picking bright, intelligent students and teachers who
will become influential in their native lands—and the Russians don’t
quibble about expenses and housing,” he comments.
But Arbuckle is extremely optimistic on the prospects for
ICAME, a $3.5 million program financed by the Ford Foundation
to help train business administration professors from colleges and
universities in Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia, India and
other areas with challenging opportunities for economic develop
ment.
UNLIKE FRIENDSHIP UNIVERSITY, he notes. ICAME will not
Indoctrinate participants with any single ideology. “We want to
teach the principles and methods of management which can best
help our participants secure educational and economic advances
within the social and political framework of their own countries.”
Arbuckle and ICAME Director Ezra Solomon have visited aca
demic institutions in more than two dozen countries to recruit pro
fessors for the ICAME program, and establish international aca
demic ties.
“In many of the countries visited, we’ve found that economic
development has outstripped human development," the dean com
ments. “Good administrators are badly needed.
“Some colleges are trying to ‘borrow’ American manpower to
meet their most pressing needs for professors. Associations of pri

vale companies are trying to upgrade their present staffs with short
term training programs similar to those offered in this country by
the American Management Association.
“WHILE THESE MEASURES offer some quick relief, they ai'e
not adequate for any long-run effort to develop well-trained mana
gerial manpower. This can best be achieved through expansion of
college-level business administration programs in each country con
cerned.”
Through ICAME, Stanford will cooperate with about 40 overseas
institutions in working toward this goal over a seven-year period.
In this time, it will be possible for participating institutions to train
a strong faculty of business administration professors, since each
institution can send one or two different professors to Stanford
every year for seven years.
Individual participants will spend part of their year here studying
such broad managerial problems as economic development, adminis
trative organization and policy making, but devote more attention
to one broad functional area each year, such as finance, marketing,
personnel or production.
CASE MATERIALS prepared by participants will be used in the
classroom. Foreign professors also will gain first-hand knowledge
of administrative problems and practices through field work care
fully planned in selected business firms, educational institutions and
government agencies.
Because it is the first program of its kind in this country, much
of ICAME’s curriculum material must be built from the ground up.
In addition to the information furnished by participants and obtained
from other educational institutions, a team of five researchers will
travel abroad to obtain teaching material for the program with the
objective of making it relevant to the problems of the countries from
which the participants are drawn.
While ICAME will have a separate academic and research staff,
Arbuckle believes informal relationships between the foreign pro
fessors and Stanford students will prove highly beneficial to both.
