# Dutch Hit Indonesia In New Guinea Clash
## 
### 
HOLLANDIA, Dutch New
Guinea (UPD—The Dutch navy
said it intercepted an Indonesian
invasion fleet off the coast of
Dutch New Guinea yesterday and
sent it fleeing after a naval battle
in which the Dutch destroyed
two Indonesian motor torpedo
boats.

Capt. R. M. Elbers, official
Dutch naval spokesman here,
said a third motor torpedo boat

was “seen fleeing with the rest
of the invasion fleet” after the
brief engagement off the south
ern coast of West New Guinea.
“IT LOOKS as if we frustrated
an Indonesian invasion attempt,”
he said.

In The Hague, a defense min
istry spokesman would not com
ment when asked if the clash
meant a state of war existed be
tween Holland and Indonesia. He
did say that all information leav
ing his office was under full se
curity checks “as in wartime.”
In Washington, U.S. officials
expressed concern that Indone
sian President Sukarno might de
clare war as a face-saving ges
ture.

SUKARNO, who has mobilized
his nation and massed 48,000
troops in the South Celebes for
an invasion attempt, met with his
war cabinet in Jakarta. Reports
filtering through heavy Indone
sian censorship indicated that the
Indonesian navy had sent a flo
tilla of destroyers to the North
Celebes.

There were unconfirmed re
ports that some fighting had al
ready taken place on the New
Guinea mainland between Dutch
troops and Indonesian infiltra
tors, but official Dutch sources
denied them.

It was not immediately known
how many vessels took part in
the battle. Capt. Elbers said some
of the Indonesian vessels were
big enough to carry 60 men each,
possibly part of the “thousand
small boats” Sukarno said he
would send against New Guinea.
THE DUTC H NAVY has two
2,400-ton frigates, the Evertsen
and the Kortenaer, and a 2,200-
ton submarine chaser, the
Utrecht, in New Guinea waters.
The Dutch said the brief en
gagement took place in Dutch
territorial waters off the town of
Kaimana, of Triton Bay. about
500 miles west of Hollandia.
THIS IS OPPOSITE a string of
Indonesian islands east of the
Celebes where Sukarno recently
said he would make the capital
city of Makassar his springboard
for attack to “liberate” the area
the Indonesians claim as West
Irian.
The Dutch said their naval
units had no choice but to open
fire. They said the Indonesian
vessels were heading for the New
Guinea coast and ignored a Dutch
challenge.
Elbers said no Dutch warships
wei’e hit. He xefused to say which
Dutch units took part in the
battle but said they wei’e backed
by Neptunes.
The Dutch cabinet went into
immediate session at The Hague
to consider whether to appeal to
the United Nations Security
Council to halt Indonesian mili
tai’y actions against the disputed
territory.
