### RONALD HILTON 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Prof. Hilton wrote this
article in reply to a question from Hie Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow Committee. The
article will be concluded in tomorrow’s Daily.
Prof. Hilton is director of Stanford’s Insti
tute of Hispanic American and Luso-Brazilian
Studies.)

The local Voice of Freedom, The Stanford
Daily, has asked me for my opinioen about
the crisis in the humanities at this institu
tion. Having been here only since 1941, 1 do
not know what is going on, and therefore
prefer to speak about American universities
in general. Those who know this institution
better than I can tell if my remarks have
any local application.
It should be explained that I was origi
nally a professor of French, that I grew up
in the shade-of the great universities of Eu
rope, and that I would probably have spent a
quiet life in Europe teaching French and pos
sibly Spanish literature, had not my observa-

tions during the period of the Spanish repub
lic—l arived in Madrid in 1931 and left in
1936 at the outbreak of the Civil War, which
killed many of my friends—convinced me
that our traditional university approach made
it impossible to understand the upheavals
which shake the Hispanic world.
It was in 1937 that, at the instigation of
Prof. Rudolph Schevill of the University of
California, I came to America intent on de
veloping a new approach to the study of in
ternational, and more precisely, Hispanic
American affairs. In reality, Stanford’s In
stitute of Hispanic American and Luso-Bra
zilian Studies and our monthly journal the
Hispanic American Report were born of the
disillusionment with traditional academic
procedures which the holocaust of the Span
ish Civil War insp i ed.
MANY OBSERVATIONS made in 1937
still seem valid today. At the time I arrived
in New York, a professor, driven to despair
by a long series of academic tensions, com

mitted suicide by jumping out of a fifth-floor
window. It is indeed fortunate that Stanford
was originally planned as a group of one
story buildings. The conclusion I derived
from this episode was that, whereas in Eu
rope there was an abundance of individual
meanness in academic life, in the United
States it took on an institutionalized charac
ter, combined with New World efficiency.

This meanness was the result of a com
mercialized attitude toward the life of the
intellect; other colleagues were looked on
not as colleagues but as competitors. One of
my x’elatives, who was dean at a major
American university, resigned and entered
business, giving as his reason that he could
not stand the competition.
THIS COMPETITION .was .organized
around a series of departments, which di
vided the world of the spirit as though it
were lowa farmland. As the Faculty Club
in Berkeley the luncheon tables were orga
nized by subjects. There was a modem lan

guage table where I ate for some time. Then,
finding the company dull, I moved to the
historians’ table, and was viewed henceforth
as an infidel by my erstwhile companions.
Berkeley was remarkable in that it was
one of the few American universities with
an excellent geography department. It is a
vestige of insularity that some American uni
versities do not have a good geography de
partment, and that even some professors of
that mother discipline, history, do not under
stand the need for a geography department.
There have been recently several reports
stressing the need for geography in our uni
versities, and it may be safely said that any
one who in 1962 does not understand the need
for the study of geography is simply unedu
cated. We should commend the foresight of a
humanist, Prof. John W. Dodds, for creating
Stanford University’s Geography Depart
ment.

THE UNIVERSITY of California recently
announced its intention to strengthen its

Geography department and its inter-depart
mental programs, hut the fact is that the so
called “regular departments,” which think
they have some kind of apostolic succession,
forget their animosities when they are con
fronted with something outside the depart
mental pattern. Such a present danger de
serves only one answer—sabotage.
The Bancroft Library was one of the
things which had attracted me to Berkeley,
and that institute sponsored the project which
had as its end-product my “Handbook of His
panic Source Materials in the United States,”
now recognized as a pioneer reference book.
What happened was that, (as soon as the “reg
ular departments” saw that my work was
being sponsored by an institute, they at
tempted to sabotage it, and had I not been
cantankerous, they might have succeeded.
Today, over 20 years later, the battle of the
Bancroft is still going on.
These memories were revived
when, just a few years ago, some
Stanford professors set out to re
duce the Hoover Institution to
impotence, simply because it was
a competitor. We may not like
the peculiar solution which was
found to the problem of the
Hoover Institution, but we should
be stupid if we failed to realize
that it must be a vital center of
interdisciplinary teaching and re
search in the field of internation
al studies.
THE WHOLE C ONCEPT of
“departments,” indeed the very
word, were alien to me until I
came to Berkeley. At Oxford the
colleges, which are essentially
inter-disciplinary institutes, are
more powerful than the univer
sity. In the United States, the de
partments rule supreme. Har
vard’s houses and Yale’s colleges
atempt to recreate the spirit of
the Oxford and Cambridge col
leges, but in reality they are little
better than dormitories. To offset
the overweening power of the de
partments, inter-disciplinary in
stitutes are necessary to some ex
tent in the natural sciences hut
above all in the social sciences
and the humanities. The institutes
should be almost as strong as the
departments, otherwise they will
he unhappy little tails on big
dogs.
The claim of departments that
they have sovereignty over cer
tain specific areas is about as
realistic as Portugal’s claim that
its colonies are essential parts of
the home territory. The history
of departments shows that they
have been in a constant state of
transformation. It is not too im
portant whether diplomatic his
tory be taught by history or by
political science, whether econom
ic history be entrusted to econo
mists or historians. The impor
tant thing is that the job should

ho woll clono. What’s in a name?
Very little*.
THE SOCIETY I grow up in
was ono in which intelligent con
versation was highly prized, and
small talk was looked upon as
the expression of small minds. I
found myself in Berkeley in a
world-famous academic commun
ity where each one busied himself
with the job which would bring
hi m professional advancement,
while the conversation between
professors was characterized by
a fearful avoidance of controver
sial subjects which might make
people take a position on signifi
cant isues. Things have changed
but little. I was recently attend
ing in the East a symposium of
distinguished scholars. After sup
per they went off happily to
watch a prize-fight on television,
leaving two of us alone to talk
about more significant things.
What do most of my colleagues
think of Life. Death, God. Democ
racy and the other great issues
on which we must take sides?
I really don’t know. I don’t dare
raise the question.
