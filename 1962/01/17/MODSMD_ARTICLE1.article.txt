Prof. Hilton is director of Stanford’s Insti
tute of Hispanic American and Luso-Brazilian
Studies.)

The local Voice of Freedom, The Stanford
Daily, has asked me for my opinioen about
the crisis in the humanities at this institu
tion. Having been here only since 1941, 1 do
not know what is going on, and therefore
prefer to speak about American universities
in general. Those who know this institution
better than I can tell if my remarks have
any local application.
It should be explained that I was origi
nally a professor of French, that I grew up
in the shade-of the great universities of Eu
rope, and that I would probably have spent a
quiet life in Europe teaching French and pos
sibly Spanish literature, had not my observa-

tions during the period of the Spanish repub
lic—l arived in Madrid in 1931 and left in
1936 at the outbreak of the Civil War, which
killed many of my friends—convinced me
that our traditional university approach made
it impossible to understand the upheavals
which shake the Hispanic world.
It was in 1937 that, at the instigation of
Prof. Rudolph Schevill of the University of
California, I came to America intent on de
veloping a new approach to the study of in
ternational, and more precisely, Hispanic
American affairs. In reality, Stanford’s In
stitute of Hispanic American and Luso-Bra
zilian Studies and our monthly journal the
Hispanic American Report were born of the
disillusionment with traditional academic
procedures which the holocaust of the Span
ish Civil War insp i ed.
MANY OBSERVATIONS made in 1937
still seem valid today. At the time I arrived
in New York, a professor, driven to despair
by a long series of academic tensions, com

mitted suicide by jumping out of a fifth-floor
window. It is indeed fortunate that Stanford
was originally planned as a group of one
story buildings. The conclusion I derived
from this episode was that, whereas in Eu
rope there was an abundance of individual
meanness in academic life, in the United
States it took on an institutionalized charac
ter, combined with New World efficiency.

This meanness was the result of a com
mercialized attitude toward the life of the
intellect; other colleagues were looked on
not as colleagues but as competitors. One of
my x’elatives, who was dean at a major
American university, resigned and entered
business, giving as his reason that he could
not stand the competition.
THIS COMPETITION .was .organized
around a series of departments, which di
vided the world of the spirit as though it
were lowa farmland. As the Faculty Club
in Berkeley the luncheon tables were orga
nized by subjects. There was a modem lan

guage table where I ate for some time. Then,
finding the company dull, I moved to the
historians’ table, and was viewed henceforth
as an infidel by my erstwhile companions.
Berkeley was remarkable in that it was
one of the few American universities with
an excellent geography department. It is a
vestige of insularity that some American uni
versities do not have a good geography de
partment, and that even some professors of
that mother discipline, history, do not under
stand the need for a geography department.
There have been recently several reports
stressing the need for geography in our uni
versities, and it may be safely said that any
one who in 1962 does not understand the need
for the study of geography is simply unedu
cated. We should commend the foresight of a
humanist, Prof. John W. Dodds, for creating
Stanford University’s Geography Depart
ment.

THE UNIVERSITY of California recently
announced its intention to strengthen its

Geography department and its inter-depart
mental programs, hut the fact is that the so
called “regular departments,” which think
they have some kind of apostolic succession,
forget their animosities when they are con
fronted with something outside the depart
mental pattern. Such a present danger de
serves only one answer—sabotage.
The Bancroft Library was one of the
things which had attracted me to Berkeley,
and that institute sponsored the project which
had as its end-product my “Handbook of His
panic Source Materials in the United States,”
now recognized as a pioneer reference book.
What happened was that, (as soon as the “reg
ular departments” saw that my work was
being sponsored by an institute, they at
tempted to sabotage it, and had I not been
cantankerous, they might have succeeded.
Today, over 20 years later, the battle of the
Bancroft is still going on.
