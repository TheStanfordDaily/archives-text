(EDITOR’S NOTE: The an

Daily staffer now enrolled at
the ladies’ affiliate of “Stan
ford of the East.”)

“I’m a transfer student.”
“Oh? Whore from?”
“Stanford.”
At first they seem surprised.
Then they smile happily. You see,
these awesome Harvard people
are a little fearful that Harvard
is not as superior as it once was.
They know that Stanford has a
Ford Grant, and sunshine, and an
occasional top Harvard professor.
Sometimes, when they are all
alone, they wonder if Providence
is always just.
“Why did you transfer?” they
ask, eager to hear me say that
Stanford is not all they have
heard it is.
“I didn’t find the intellectual
atmosphere at Stanford as stimu
lating as I thought it would be
here,” I tell them.
IT IS A SNOBBISH answer,
and I know it makes them happy.
