# Versus Harvard-A Transfer's View

| It is also a true answer. Stanford
[ students are not so likely to dis
cuss the Philippine election, or
the symbolism in Proust, or the
biological reason mononucleosis
is called mononucleosis. Stanford
students frown on that sort of
thing.
This intellectual excitement of
Cambridge is one of the main dif
ferences. I am no longer sure it
is one of the main virtues. Some
thing seems to me wrong when
so many people I meet seem com
pelled to adeptly display their
erudition in polysyllabic non
sense. At least Stanford nonsense
is easy to understand.
New England formality is
sometimes oppressive. There
must be an unwritten convention
that says all male students must
wear coats and lies to class.
VV l>e n an occasional innocent
young man wears something else,
| he is either considered gauche, or
j he is pitied. When I see a boy
j wearing jeans, I find myself grin
ning at him and dreaming of the
lawn in front of Main Libe.
DINNER AT RADCEIFFE is a
j ritual, and one which I have not

yet learned to follow with the
proper religious fervor. The one
mitigating force is the sherry
which is occasionally served in
the Living Room before dinner.
All during the appetizer, the
main course, and the dessert, ev
eryone must chat politely and in
telligently with everyone else. 1
still haven’t mastered the art of
intellectual small talk. I keep
having the fearful feeling that I
have forgotten my manners, or
I’ve forgotten someone else’s
manners that I am expected to
know.
After dinner, everyone goes
into the living room for a demi
tasse. You must stand in line for
it, but you must always talk with
those around you to make it look
as if you are not standing in line
at all.
THEN YOU MUST balance
your cup in one hand, your cigar
ette in the other, and try to
smoke and drink and talk po
litely all the time. This is called
social poise.
The demi-tasse ritual is very
awkward for uncultured Stanford
students like me, but I cannot

escape it because I need coffee to
keep awake. The reason that I
need to keep awake is that I must
study all evening.
This is another difference be
tween the two schools. People
here study much more seriously,
and often. This pleases the pro
fessors so much that they add a
few more books to the required
reading list.
Tins pleases me too. Perhaps a
university is for studying, and
reading, and learning gieat awe
some ambiguous things. At the
same time I am a little scornful
and more than a little fearful of
it all. Sometimes I just want to
kiss off and go to Mama’s. But
these people wouldn’t understand.
I HAVE MADE OTHER quick
judgments on the two schools.
The quarter system is better than
the semester one. Harvard pro
fessors are more famous, but not
always better.
The Stanford overseas (beson
ders in Deutschland) program is
something that has no counter
part at Harvard, much to Har
vard’s loss. However. Harvard tu
torials are an educational expe

lienee which Stanford doesn’t
have, and probably help to ac
count for the good student-fac
ulty relationship here.
Boston is almost as exciting as
San Francisco, and is only six
minutes away. “Culture” is bet
ter in Boston; coffee is better in
San Francisco.
THE KEAE difference between
the two universities is not aca
demic. Everyone at Stanford
knows that Harvard is academi
cally excellent, and everyone at
Harvard knows that Stanford is
pretty damn good too.
The real difference is that be
tween the intellectual intensity of
Harvard and the casualness of
Stanford; between neckties and
go-aheads; between the aloof in
dividual and the gregarious stu
dent.
I am not sorry that I trans
ferred. There are many new
thoughts and exciting people
here. I am lucky to get to know
them. Yet I wouldn’t trade my
two years at Stanford for 10
years here. I’d rather be a Stan
ford snob than any other kind of
snob I know.
