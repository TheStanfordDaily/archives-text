# Keep Morality Out of Law, Urges British Philosopher
## 
### BILL REPPY 
Sexual promiscuity itself ought not to be punishable. Criminal
law must distinguish between immorality and indecency.
This was a major point developed last night by British legal
philosopher H.L.A. Hart before a capacity Tuesday Evening Series

audience in Dinkelspiol Audito-+
Hum

THE LAW must not punish
breaches of accepted conduct or
immoral actions which harm no
one, said Hart. But it must pun
ish indecency.
He illustrated this point dra
matically: “Sexual union of man
and wife in a public place is not
punished because it is immoral—
indeed it is not immoral—but be
cause it is indecent.”
Similarly, Hart argued, prosti
tution itself ought not to be ille
gal, rather the public pimping
associated with it.
Why do we punish the “fasci
nating and curious crime of big
amy?” Hart asked. It is not for
the sexual cohabitation involved,
for a married man can live with
another woman and oven declare
publicly they are married with
impunity so long as he has not
gone through a second marriage
ceremony.

No, said Hart, the law against
bigamy “docs not punish the im
morality, but the desecration of
a sacred institution, the public
mockery of marriage.” In other
words, indecency.
MUCH OP' Hart’s lecture was
a defense of the doctrine of John
Stuart Mill set forth in his essay
on liberty. “Mill was hostile to
all ‘paternalism’ in law.” Thus
Mill would have made mercy kill
ing legal on the grounds that the
function of a legal system does
not include “protecting people
against themselves.”
But, Hart said, this type of
legal paternalism is not the same
as the persecution of harmless
immorality. The judgment of a
man who requests euthanasia
may be clouded, and the law here
may indeed prevent harm being
done, Hart suggested.
Hart concludes his series of
throe lectures on “Law, Liberty
and Morality” today at 4:30 p.m.
in Dinkolspiel Auditorium. He is
being presented by the Harry
Camp Memorial Fund.
