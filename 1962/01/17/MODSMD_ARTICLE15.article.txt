# Quad No Place for Navy Recruiters
## 
### 
One of the more unfortunate signs of our times was in evidence
outside the Civ Libe Monday and yesterday—a U.S. Navy aviation
recruiting van. We hope it is the last time such a van is allowed
near Quad.
This was the third time in recent months the Navy’s recruiting
arm was able to reach so close to that part of the University where
teaching is carried on, and it is time the University put a stop to it.
We have no objecton to the Navy coming to Stanford to provide
Stanford men information on that service, as most Stanford men
will unfortunately be required to spend some time in one of the
services, and the individual ought to be provided as much informa
tion as possible before he chooses.
What we do object to is the apparent willingness of the Univer
sity to let the van park at the crossroads of the campus so that one
and all may learn of the greater glories of the Navy’s air arm. Quad
is not the place for recruiting of any knd; it should be regarded as
hallowed ground where students and faculty meet in the process of
educating and becoming educated.
The recruiters of the armed services have no business on or near
Quad, whether they are actually signing people up or just putting on
a show of how enjoyable and interesting life is in Navy aviation.
The presence of such a symbol of force at the University, where
intelligence and reason are held up as the means by which man
should settle his disputes, is an insult to the Stanford community.
A sign on the van’s side urges Stanford men to “Fly Navy.” We
would put it another way: “Flv, Navy.”
