NAVY VAN
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford can hardly afford to
bite the hand that feeds it when
operation costs are at an all-time
high. On the contrary, the Finan
cial Office should exert its ut
most influence to persuade the
Administration to placate both
the Federal Government and the
D.A.R., well known and generous
contributors to Stanford’s coffers.
The mobile X-ray unit was a
good if perhaps short-sighted
precedent, for surely such a char
ity, interested solely in healing,
can offer Stanford little in the
way of funds. But allowing the
Navy to take over the highly
competitive location in front of
the Western Civilization Library
(where the density of unformed
minds is the greatest) was pure
vision. Surely this will ingratiate
Stanford with the Navy, and
hence, the Federal Government.
But this is not enough; we can
and must do more, for the Gov
ernment is very wealthy. With
Pacifist picketeers outwitted by
a clever surprise appearance on
Monday afternoon, the Navy edu
cation van could be moved to
inner quad by Sunday. Perhaps
a Navy chaplain could speak in
Memorial Church on the spiritual
advantages of being a Naviator.
But enough said. I am confident
that the Administration will take
the appropriate steps to make
Stanford the greatest university
in the West.

HOUSE PLAN
Editor, The Daily:
If Miss Kingston would re-read
my article, she would find that it
is a statement of what the House
Plan aims to do (in my opinion),
not what it Ls. I never pretended
that it was anything more than
the statement of an ideal.

BIRDDOGS, ARISE!
Editor, The Daily:
It has come to our attention
from unhappy experience, that
the men of Stanford have an irra
tional fear of the age-old custom
known as Bird-dogging. We be
lieve that the present social sys
tem which accepts without ques
tion that a boy’s date is his pos
session, whether he cares about
her or not, is constricting, arti
ficial and needlessly painful.
Two manifestations of this sys
tem that we find especially de
plorable are: (1) spending one’s
time at a party exclusively with

one’s date, and (2) after one or
more dates with a person being
considered automatically off-lim
its to all his or her acquaintances.
A party should be a place to have
fun—to mingle, meet new people,
flirt, and be slightly irresponsible.
After four hours with exclusively
one person, one is either thor
oughly snowed or bored out of
his mind. The first is nice, the
second is all too common.
Dating as it stands is forced to
be intense and highly private. We
plead for a possible dating rela
tionship whose purpose is fun and
friendship mutual enjoyment
rather than possession. For the
protection of those who agree
with us, and are willing to stand
on their principles, we suggest
the formation of a Stanford Bird
dog Society and Auxiliary. (We
invite all those interested to write
Box 3548.)

DAILY GOOFS
Editor, The Daily:
One of the duties of The Daily
as a campus newspaper is to pub
licize all events of interest to stu
dents occurring at Stanford. We
of Sigma Phi Sigma, premedical
honorary society, feel slighted
that we were not newsworthy
enough to merit an announcement
of our recent program, Medicine
and the Mind.
Besides being of interest to pre
medical and psychology students,
of whom there are many at Stan
ford, this program featured three
outstanding psychiatric, neuro
logical, and research experts
speaking on subjects of general
concern. The weeks of work nec
essary to plan and execute such
a program we believe are worth
a few lines of print for a notice
prepared and submitted well in
advance of the actual date.
Is there an explanation?

(EDITOR’S NOTE: Our
apologies to Sigma Phi Sigma
for omitting their story. Unfor
tunately, mistakes do occur and
stories are misplaced or lost in
the routine of putting out a
daily paper, as apparently hap
pened here. We will continue
to make every effort to mini
mize such mistakes, and appre
ciate our attention being called
to the mistakes we make.)
