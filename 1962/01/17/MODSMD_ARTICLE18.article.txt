# CAMPUS OPINION
## Indian Student Comments On Criticism of Goa Move 
### ASHAK DATAR 
(EDITOR’S NOTE; The author
of this article is an ASSU foreign
scholar from India.)

In the third week of December
the Indian army “liberated” or
“invaded” Goa a “province of
metropolitan Portuga 1.” 5,000
miles away from Portugal lying
on the Indian subcontinent.
Here, I do not want to say what
India has done is correct. Here I
am concerned with the approach
of critics rather than justification
of the whole affair.
I would share the criticism of
the Indian action so far as it is
limited to inconsistency in Indian
policy. Beyond that there is hard
ly any ground for criticism. It is
not necessary for me to sound
again the ethnic, cultural and
geographical reasons which have
almost become cliches now. I will
turn to people’s aspirations later
on.

BUT THERE ARE still some
people, outside Portugal, who
cling to legal bases in criticizing
Indian action. Stressing the fact
of Portuguese rule for the last 400
years does not take us anywhere.
Nor is there any point in saying
that there was no such thing as
an Indian nation 400 years back.
Defense of this untenable position
should mean that once exploita
tion or colonialism is legalized, by
virtue of law, it can bo perpetu
ated. If history had accepted this,
the Union Jack would fly in
Washington and New Delhi.
Of course those who still feel
fond about racial supremacy and
the spread of Christianity and
“civilization” (with flag) cannot
be convinced. But I am sure they
have realized that these ideas are
no longer part of conventional
wisdom.

Now most people believe that
Goa rightfully belongs to India
but that India should not have re
sorted to force. I agree. But the
rest of their argument is falla
cious. “After all, India should not
behave like a bad boy. Nehru ap
parently looked like a peace-lov
ing angel. Now ho has shown his
real spirit.” I am surprised to
find the undertone in that.
IF THEY SHARPEN their
memory they will find that very
rarely is the neutral position of
India and the role of Nehru ap
preciated. With a sharp sense of
humor, Mr. Nehru commented
that “A man is appreciated at
least for his past deeds.” If I am

permitted to make a somewhat
meaningless statement I would
say that if force was ever justi
fied (which is really never!) it
can be more justified in Goa than
anywhere else.
In this situation, it is some
thing strange to hear Ambassa
dor Stevenson saying that this is
the gravest trouble since 1945,
and it can lead to the collapse of
the U.N. Apparently this means
the other points of friction are
still minor. That the comparison
which this statement involves is
untenable is brilliantly shown by
no less an authority than Walter
Lippmann. I shall not repeat it.
Coming to the explanation of
use of force I need not hesitate
to say that public pressure is
more of an adequate reason for
invading Goa than sheer election
strategy. Indian party politics is
not vulnerable to small episodes
like Goa, and on the other hand
this will not cause people to for
get China.
SECONDLY, NEHRU, though a
staunch advocate of non-violence,
is not Gandhi himself. He would
not want to be. There is a reason
able amount of pragmatism in
him. If we accept this, not as an
ideal principle but as a reason
ably peaceful strategy, it ceases
to be an absolute principle and
becomes subject to the law of
lesser evil.

Here, the problem of timetable
arises. Is the period of 14 years
too long or too short to negotiate
with the Portuguese? Is it wise
to rely on actuarial forecasts or
the death of a dictator in Portu
gal. Answers cannot stand abso
lute rationality.
And what was the basis of the
negotiation offer made by Portu
gal, the purpose of which was
only face-saving? How can India
proceed to negotiate while accept
ing Goa to bo part of Portugal?
And what point is there in nego
tiating further when the basic
question of sovereignty is not
touched on? These are the aspects
which critics fail to take into ac
count.
SIMILARLY, it is the Indian
government which must decide
whether to tackle China first or

Portugal first. Logistics assume
a decisive role in that Portuguese
Goa was definitely a mosquito.
But does that mean it should not
be killed until the Chinese tiger
is driven out? In fact, it might
be better to get rid of small things
first before facing the big thing.
Anyway, it is not for others to
decide.

And now a delicate theoretical
issue. To what extent would it
have been wise to apply the prin
ciple of self-determination in
Goa? I am sure that Goans would
welcome integration with India
overwhelmingly. But still it may
not be advisable to use self-deter
mination indiscriminately. If the
pui’e and simple logic of profit
maximization is applied, Goans
should prefer a “sovereign na
tion.’' meaning thereby a free port
something like Hong Kong or
Aden. It can hope to be rich with
out any effort or taxes. But is it
desirable? The artificially small
nation, in whatever form, might
be harmful in the present world.
It stands a better chance to be
a puppet of any ambitious nation.
STILL, ALL THESE points
seem to have some sense. But the
criticism revolving around busi
ness and religion appears emi
nently ridiculous to me. A popu
lar and opinion-forming magazine
such as Time should not have
played this trick. To defend Por
tuguese rule because it means
“freedom’’ for business (in terms
of less and regressive taxes!) is
nonsense.

As far as religion is concerned,
readers should remember that In
dia is a secular state—perhaps
more than any European nation—
and certainly much more than
great Portugal! The fact, that
there are 37 per cent Christians
in Portuguese India and 1.2 per
cent in British India will provide
an adequate clue to those who
have insight.
Above all, one often wonders
why India and the U.S. two
really good boys in the game of
international politics—cannot es
cape the elegant crime of incon
sistency, especially in the light of
(and, if you please) efficient con
sistency of Russia in these mat
ters.

In the third week of December
the Indian army “liberated” or
“invaded” Goa a “province of
metropolitan Portuga 1.” 5,000
miles away from Portugal lying
on the Indian subcontinent.
Here, I do not want to say what
India has done is correct. Here I
am concerned with the approach
of critics rather than justification
of the whole affair.
I would share the criticism of
the Indian action so far as it is
limited to inconsistency in Indian
policy. Beyond that there is hard
ly any ground for criticism. It is
not necessary for me to sound
again the ethnic, cultural and
geographical reasons which have
almost become cliches now. I will
turn to people’s aspirations later
on.

BUT THERE ARE still some
people, outside Portugal, who
cling to legal bases in criticizing
Indian action. Stressing the fact
of Portuguese rule for the last 400
years does not take us anywhere.
Nor is there any point in saying
that there was no such thing as
an Indian nation 400 years back.
Defense of this untenable position
should mean that once exploita
tion or colonialism is legalized, by
virtue of law, it can bo perpetu
ated. If history had accepted this,
the Union Jack would fly in
Washington and New Delhi.
Of course those who still feel
fond about racial supremacy and
the spread of Christianity and
“civilization” (with flag) cannot
be convinced. But I am sure they
have realized that these ideas are
no longer part of conventional
wisdom.

Now most people believe that
Goa rightfully belongs to India
but that India should not have re
sorted to force. I agree. But the
rest of their argument is falla
cious. “After all, India should not
behave like a bad boy. Nehru ap
parently looked like a peace-lov
ing angel. Now ho has shown his
real spirit.” I am surprised to
find the undertone in that.
IF THEY SHARPEN their
memory they will find that very
rarely is the neutral position of
India and the role of Nehru ap
preciated. With a sharp sense of
humor, Mr. Nehru commented
that “A man is appreciated at
least for his past deeds.” If I am

permitted to make a somewhat
meaningless statement I would
say that if force was ever justi
fied (which is really never!) it
can be more justified in Goa than
anywhere else.
In this situation, it is some
thing strange to hear Ambassa
dor Stevenson saying that this is
the gravest trouble since 1945,
and it can lead to the collapse of
the U.N. Apparently this means
the other points of friction are
still minor. That the comparison
which this statement involves is
untenable is brilliantly shown by
no less an authority than Walter
Lippmann. I shall not repeat it.
Coming to the explanation of
use of force I need not hesitate
to say that public pressure is
more of an adequate reason for
invading Goa than sheer election
strategy. Indian party politics is
not vulnerable to small episodes
like Goa, and on the other hand
this will not cause people to for
get China.
SECONDLY, NEHRU, though a
staunch advocate of non-violence,
is not Gandhi himself. He would
not want to be. There is a reason
able amount of pragmatism in
him. If we accept this, not as an
ideal principle but as a reason
ably peaceful strategy, it ceases
to be an absolute principle and
becomes subject to the law of
lesser evil.

Here, the problem of timetable
arises. Is the period of 14 years
too long or too short to negotiate
with the Portuguese? Is it wise
to rely on actuarial forecasts or
the death of a dictator in Portu
gal. Answers cannot stand abso
lute rationality.
And what was the basis of the
negotiation offer made by Portu
gal, the purpose of which was
only face-saving? How can India
proceed to negotiate while accept
ing Goa to bo part of Portugal?
And what point is there in nego
tiating further when the basic
question of sovereignty is not
touched on? These are the aspects
which critics fail to take into ac
count.
SIMILARLY, it is the Indian
government which must decide
whether to tackle China first or

Portugal first. Logistics assume
a decisive role in that Portuguese
Goa was definitely a mosquito.
But does that mean it should not
be killed until the Chinese tiger
is driven out? In fact, it might
be better to get rid of small things
first before facing the big thing.
Anyway, it is not for others to
decide.

And now a delicate theoretical
issue. To what extent would it
have been wise to apply the prin
ciple of self-determination in
Goa? I am sure that Goans would
welcome integration with India
overwhelmingly. But still it may
not be advisable to use self-deter
mination indiscriminately. If the
pui’e and simple logic of profit
maximization is applied, Goans
should prefer a “sovereign na
tion.’' meaning thereby a free port
something like Hong Kong or
Aden. It can hope to be rich with
out any effort or taxes. But is it
desirable? The artificially small
nation, in whatever form, might
be harmful in the present world.
It stands a better chance to be
a puppet of any ambitious nation.
STILL, ALL THESE points
seem to have some sense. But the
criticism revolving around busi
ness and religion appears emi
nently ridiculous to me. A popu
lar and opinion-forming magazine
such as Time should not have
played this trick. To defend Por
tuguese rule because it means
“freedom’’ for business (in terms
of less and regressive taxes!) is
nonsense.

As far as religion is concerned,
readers should remember that In
dia is a secular state—perhaps
more than any European nation—
and certainly much more than
great Portugal! The fact, that
there are 37 per cent Christians
in Portuguese India and 1.2 per
cent in British India will provide
an adequate clue to those who
have insight.
Above all, one often wonders
why India and the U.S. two
really good boys in the game of
international politics—cannot es
cape the elegant crime of incon
sistency, especially in the light of
(and, if you please) efficient con

readers should remember that In
dia is a secular state—perhaps
more than any European nation—
and certainly much more than
great Portugal! The fact, that
there are 37 per cent Christians
in Portuguese India and 1.2 per
cent in British India will provide
an adequate clue to those who
have insight.
Above all, one often wonders
why India and the U.S. two
really good boys in the game of
international politics—cannot es
cape the elegant crime of incon
sistency, especially in the light of
(and, if you please) efficient con
sistency of Russia in these mat

In the third week of December
the Indian army “liberated” or
“invaded” Goa a “province of
metropolitan Portuga 1.” 5,000
miles away from Portugal lying
on the Indian subcontinent.
Here, I do not want to say what
India has done is correct. Here I
am concerned with the approach
of critics rather than justification
of the whole affair.
I would share the criticism of
the Indian action so far as it is
limited to inconsistency in Indian
policy. Beyond that there is hard
ly any ground for criticism. It is
not necessary for me to sound
again the ethnic, cultural and
geographical reasons which have
almost become cliches now. I will
turn to people’s aspirations later
on.

BUT THERE ARE still some
people, outside Portugal, who
cling to legal bases in criticizing
Indian action. Stressing the fact
of Portuguese rule for the last 400
years does not take us anywhere.
Nor is there any point in saying
that there was no such thing as
an Indian nation 400 years back.
Defense of this untenable position
should mean that once exploita
tion or colonialism is legalized, by
virtue of law, it can bo perpetu
ated. If history had accepted this,
the Union Jack would fly in
Washington and New Delhi.
Of course those who still feel
fond about racial supremacy and
the spread of Christianity and
“civilization” (with flag) cannot
be convinced. But I am sure they
have realized that these ideas are
no longer part of conventional
wisdom.

Now most people believe that
Goa rightfully belongs to India
but that India should not have re
sorted to force. I agree. But the
rest of their argument is falla
cious. “After all, India should not
behave like a bad boy. Nehru ap
parently looked like a peace-lov
ing angel. Now ho has shown his
real spirit.” I am surprised to
find the undertone in that.
IF THEY SHARPEN their
memory they will find that very
rarely is the neutral position of
India and the role of Nehru ap
preciated. With a sharp sense of
humor, Mr. Nehru commented
that “A man is appreciated at
least for his past deeds.” If I am

permitted to make a somewhat
meaningless statement I would
say that if force was ever justi
fied (which is really never!) it
can be more justified in Goa than
anywhere else.
In this situation, it is some
thing strange to hear Ambassa
dor Stevenson saying that this is
the gravest trouble since 1945,
and it can lead to the collapse of
the U.N. Apparently this means
the other points of friction are
still minor. That the comparison
which this statement involves is
untenable is brilliantly shown by
no less an authority than Walter
Lippmann. I shall not repeat it.
Coming to the explanation of
use of force I need not hesitate
to say that public pressure is
more of an adequate reason for
invading Goa than sheer election
strategy. Indian party politics is
not vulnerable to small episodes
like Goa, and on the other hand
this will not cause people to for
get China.
SECONDLY, NEHRU, though a
staunch advocate of non-violence,
is not Gandhi himself. He would
not want to be. There is a reason
able amount of pragmatism in
him. If we accept this, not as an
ideal principle but as a reason
ably peaceful strategy, it ceases
to be an absolute principle and
becomes subject to the law of
lesser evil.

Here, the problem of timetable
arises. Is the period of 14 years
too long or too short to negotiate
with the Portuguese? Is it wise
to rely on actuarial forecasts or
the death of a dictator in Portu
gal. Answers cannot stand abso
lute rationality.
And what was the basis of the
negotiation offer made by Portu
gal, the purpose of which was
only face-saving? How can India
proceed to negotiate while accept
ing Goa to bo part of Portugal?
And what point is there in nego
tiating further when the basic
question of sovereignty is not
touched on? These are the aspects
which critics fail to take into ac
count.
SIMILARLY, it is the Indian
government which must decide
whether to tackle China first or

Portugal first. Logistics assume
a decisive role in that Portuguese
Goa was definitely a mosquito.
But does that mean it should not
be killed until the Chinese tiger
is driven out? In fact, it might
be better to get rid of small things
first before facing the big thing.
Anyway, it is not for others to
decide.

And now a delicate theoretical
issue. To what extent would it
have been wise to apply the prin
ciple of self-determination in
Goa? I am sure that Goans would
welcome integration with India
overwhelmingly. But still it may
not be advisable to use self-deter
mination indiscriminately. If the
pui’e and simple logic of profit
maximization is applied, Goans
should prefer a “sovereign na
tion.’' meaning thereby a free port
something like Hong Kong or
Aden. It can hope to be rich with
out any effort or taxes. But is it
desirable? The artificially small
nation, in whatever form, might
be harmful in the present world.
It stands a better chance to be
a puppet of any ambitious nation.
STILL, ALL THESE points
seem to have some sense. But the
criticism revolving around busi
ness and religion appears emi
nently ridiculous to me. A popu
lar and opinion-forming magazine
such as Time should not have
played this trick. To defend Por
tuguese rule because it means
“freedom’’ for business (in terms
of less and regressive taxes!) is
nonsense.

As far as religion is concerned,
readers should remember that In

more than any European nation—
and certainly much more than

nently ridiculous to me. A popu
lar and opinion-forming magazine
such as Time should not have
played this trick. To defend Por
tuguese rule because it means
“freedom’’ for business (in terms
of less and regressive taxes!) is
nonsense.

As far as religion is concerned,
readers should remember that In
dia is a secular state—perhaps
more than any European nation—
and certainly much more than
great Portugal! The fact, that
there are 37 per cent Christians
in Portuguese India and 1.2 per
cent in British India will provide
an adequate clue to those who
have insight.
Above all, one often wonders
why India and the U.S. two
really good boys in the game of
international politics—cannot es
cape the elegant crime of incon
sistency, especially in the light of
(and, if you please) efficient con
sistency of Russia in these mat
ters.

of this article is an ASSU foreign
scholar from India.)

In the third week of December
the Indian army “liberated” or
“invaded” Goa a “province of
metropolitan Portuga 1.” 5,000
miles away from Portugal lying
on the Indian subcontinent.
Here, I do not want to say what
India has done is correct. Here I
am concerned with the approach
of critics rather than justification
of the whole affair.
I would share the criticism of
the Indian action so far as it is
limited to inconsistency in Indian
policy. Beyond that there is hard
ly any ground for criticism. It is
not necessary for me to sound
again the ethnic, cultural and
geographical reasons which have
almost become cliches now. I will
turn to people’s aspirations later
on.

BUT THERE ARE still some
people, outside Portugal, who
cling to legal bases in criticizing
Indian action. Stressing the fact
of Portuguese rule for the last 400
years does not take us anywhere.
Nor is there any point in saying
that there was no such thing as
an Indian nation 400 years back.
Defense of this untenable position
should mean that once exploita
tion or colonialism is legalized, by
virtue of law, it can bo perpetu
ated. If history had accepted this,
the Union Jack would fly in
Washington and New Delhi.
Of course those who still feel
fond about racial supremacy and
the spread of Christianity and
“civilization” (with flag) cannot
be convinced. But I am sure they
have realized that these ideas are
no longer part of conventional
wisdom.

Now most people believe that
Goa rightfully belongs to India
but that India should not have re
sorted to force. I agree. But the
rest of their argument is falla
cious. “After all, India should not
behave like a bad boy. Nehru ap
parently looked like a peace-lov
ing angel. Now ho has shown his
real spirit.” I am surprised to
find the undertone in that.
IF THEY SHARPEN their
memory they will find that very
rarely is the neutral position of
India and the role of Nehru ap
preciated. With a sharp sense of
humor, Mr. Nehru commented
that “A man is appreciated at
least for his past deeds.” If I am

permitted to make a somewhat
meaningless statement I would
say that if force was ever justi
fied (which is really never!) it
can be more justified in Goa than
anywhere else.
In this situation, it is some
thing strange to hear Ambassa
dor Stevenson saying that this is
the gravest trouble since 1945,
and it can lead to the collapse of
the U.N. Apparently this means
the other points of friction are
still minor. That the comparison
which this statement involves is
untenable is brilliantly shown by
no less an authority than Walter
Lippmann. I shall not repeat it.
Coming to the explanation of
use of force I need not hesitate
to say that public pressure is
more of an adequate reason for
invading Goa than sheer election
strategy. Indian party politics is
not vulnerable to small episodes
like Goa, and on the other hand
this will not cause people to for
get China.
SECONDLY, NEHRU, though a
staunch advocate of non-violence,
is not Gandhi himself. He would
not want to be. There is a reason
able amount of pragmatism in
him. If we accept this, not as an
ideal principle but as a reason
ably peaceful strategy, it ceases
to be an absolute principle and
becomes subject to the law of
lesser evil.

Here, the problem of timetable
arises. Is the period of 14 years
too long or too short to negotiate
with the Portuguese? Is it wise
to rely on actuarial forecasts or
the death of a dictator in Portu
gal. Answers cannot stand abso
lute rationality.
And what was the basis of the
negotiation offer made by Portu
gal, the purpose of which was
only face-saving? How can India
proceed to negotiate while accept
ing Goa to bo part of Portugal?
And what point is there in nego
tiating further when the basic
question of sovereignty is not
touched on? These are the aspects
which critics fail to take into ac
count.
SIMILARLY, it is the Indian
government which must decide
whether to tackle China first or

Portugal first. Logistics assume
a decisive role in that Portuguese
Goa was definitely a mosquito.
But does that mean it should not
be killed until the Chinese tiger
is driven out? In fact, it might
be better to get rid of small things
first before facing the big thing.
Anyway, it is not for others to
decide.

And now a delicate theoretical
issue. To what extent would it
have been wise to apply the prin
ciple of self-determination in
Goa? I am sure that Goans would
welcome integration with India
overwhelmingly. But still it may
not be advisable to use self-deter
mination indiscriminately. If the
pui’e and simple logic of profit
maximization is applied, Goans
should prefer a “sovereign na
tion.’' meaning thereby a free port
something like Hong Kong or
Aden. It can hope to be rich with
out any effort or taxes. But is it
desirable? The artificially small
nation, in whatever form, might
be harmful in the present world.
It stands a better chance to be
a puppet of any ambitious nation.
STILL, ALL THESE points
seem to have some sense. But the
criticism revolving around busi
ness and religion appears emi
nently ridiculous to me. A popu
lar and opinion-forming magazine
such as Time should not have
