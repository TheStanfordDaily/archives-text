# OUR MAN ON THE FARM

The junior journalism major from Half Moon Bay had his judg
ment vindicated in Stanford’s convincing 74-22 basketball win over
California Friday.
Sticking his neck out on a limb, the Daily Sports Editor said in
the Thursday edition of the Daily that Stanford’s greatest asset was
a deep bench that would pull Howie Dallmar’s group out of trouble
in case of injury, weariness, and foul trouble.
THIS WAS THE CASE Friday night. Willi about five minutes
gone in the second half, Hollis Moore was the ungrateful recipient
of his fourth foul, and was pulled from the court by Dallmar so he
could be called on when needed. Shortly thereafter, Darrell Suther
land and Tom Dose followed Moore out of the game, both also with
four fouls.
It turned out they weren’t needed. John Windsor “came through
in the clutch” as the cliche goes, but it was never more true than

when it was said of Windsor’s
play.
The play of Stanford’s bench
was also “clutch.” Co-captain Phil
Kelly replaced Moore, Mike Ledg
erwood took over at center for
Dose, and Doug Clemetson subbed
for Sutherland. Stanford’s top
three replaceemnts were never
better.
Stanford was 12 points to the
good with 15 minutes to play,
and anyone who remembers the
three games between Stanford
and Cal last year knows that any
thing could happen when the two
rivals meet on a basketball court.
HOWEVER, with Windsor and
the reserves operating, Stanford
pulled away and won by 32, with
most of the damage done against
Cal’s first team, and not their
substitutes.

BIG FIVE STANDINGS
Things got interesting for Stanford due to the results of other
college hoop action over the weekend. USC got knocked off hy Wash
ington Friday, and although they clobbered the Huskies the follow
ing night, the upset by the Northerners left USC in third place in
Big Five standings.
UCLA leads the five-team loop with a 3-0 slate. They beat Cal
Saturday for that East Bay team’s fourth straight league setback.
STANFORD IS SECOND with a 1-0 record. Washington, figured
for second place in most pre-season selections, is one game out of
the cellar at 1-3, but they did nail USC.
Santa Clara, rated the top team in the Bay Area, and ranked 13
in the nation in a wire service poll, lost twice, including one upset
by lowly Pepperdine. Loyola administered the other blow to the
Broncos’ national prestige.
From what has been said at the Northern California Basketball
Writers Luncheon, it appears that some Bay Area basketball fans
are dissatisfied with the style of play in these parts. This feeling
cannot be directed at Stanford.
NOT ENOUGH
The chief complaints seem to be with the lack of scoring and
the dependence on the zone defense. Stanford doesn’t fall into either
of these categories. The Indians are one of the highest-scoring cage
aggregations to hit the Bay Area in quite a while.
EVEN CAL’S NCAA champs of a couple of years ago didn’t
score as much as the Stanfords of today. The Tribe has gone over
the 70-point mark in all of the seven home games, and also went
over 70 twice in Hawaii.
The outside shooting of Darrell Sutherland, the Clemetsons, and
Hollis Moore, and the consistent; rebounding and inside scoring of
Tom Dose and John Windsor make Stanford anything but a dull out
fit to watch.
They also make Stanfoi’d a winning team.
The only question is, how many will they win? The answer, I
dont’ know, but in a couple of months we’ll all find out.

Four fouls in a hurry
