By UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL
NEW YORK — The budding New York Mets will have “Yankee
class" everywhere hut on the playing field when they bring National
League baseball hack to the big town in 1962. The ownership, the
front-office, the field manager, the stadium boss and even the trainer
all are.Jop drawer. I he team itseH is not. Nor is the hand-me-down,

worn out Polo Grounds, one-time
home of the departed Giants, but
it will be scrubbed and re-fitted
with a $300,000 face-lifting to
make it almost “liveable” for the
year the Mets will have to spend
there before moving to a new
stadium in Flushing Meadow.
In time, the team figures to
improve because ex-Yankee brains
are running the show. The club
already is taking on a Yankee
flavor right down to the new pin
stripe uniforms patterned after
those worn by hte fabulously suc
cessful w'orld champions.
Here’s a sample of the new
club directory:
C HIEF STOCKHOLDER is
Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson,
long a familiar name in horse
racing, long-time Giant fan, once
a backer of Branch Rickey’s pro
posed third major league.
Mrs, Payson is on excellent
speaking term with money, an
important talent that’ll get a good
workout the next few years with
the Mets. However, when she
gave away a couple of million
dollars to one of her charities not
long ago it was estimated her
bankroll was capable of repeating
the same gesture for another cen
tury or so without showing
alarming signs of shrinkage.
In the front office is old reliable
George Weiss, bounced by the
Yankees when he reached retire
ment age but regarded as one of
baseball’s shrewdest operators.
ON THE managerial bench—
Casey Stengel, another “retired”
Yankee. At 71, Casey became “un
retired” to help George got the
Mets off the ground. Casey
brought in ex-managers Cookie
Lavagetto and Solly Hemus to
help.
The trainer is Gus Mauch, long
time Yankee. The Mets’ stadium
boss and also ticket manager is
another ex-Yankee, Jim Thomson.
Johnny Murphy, former Yan
kee relief pitching ace and one
time Boston Red Sox farm direc
tor, is an assistant to Weiss in
the swivel-chair department.

“EVERYTHING possible will
be done to spruce up the Polo
Grounds,” says Thomson. “We’ll
be there only a year and the
money spent will be a total loss
but we want the first impressions
of the customers to be as good
as we can make it.”
The team? Well, there are few
names like Gil Hodges, Richie
Ashburn, Frank Thomas, Gus
Bell, Roger Craig and Johnny An
tonelli.
But by no stretch of the imagi
nation are they expected to be
have like the Yankees on the
playing field.

NEW YORK — The budding New York Mets will have “Yankee
class" everywhere hut on the playing field when they bring National
League baseball hack to the big town in 1962. The ownership, the
front-office, the field manager, the stadium boss and even the trainer
all are.Jop drawer. I he team itseH is not. Nor is the hand-me-down,

worn out Polo Grounds, one-time
home of the departed Giants, but
it will be scrubbed and re-fitted
with a $300,000 face-lifting to
make it almost “liveable” for the
year the Mets will have to spend
there before moving to a new
stadium in Flushing Meadow.
In time, the team figures to
improve because ex-Yankee brains
are running the show. The club
already is taking on a Yankee
flavor right down to the new pin
stripe uniforms patterned after
those worn by hte fabulously suc
cessful w'orld champions.
Here’s a sample of the new
club directory:
C HIEF STOCKHOLDER is
Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson,
long a familiar name in horse
racing, long-time Giant fan, once
a backer of Branch Rickey’s pro
posed third major league.
Mrs, Payson is on excellent
speaking term with money, an
important talent that’ll get a good
workout the next few years with
the Mets. However, when she
gave away a couple of million
dollars to one of her charities not
long ago it was estimated her
bankroll was capable of repeating
the same gesture for another cen
tury or so without showing
alarming signs of shrinkage.
In the front office is old reliable
George Weiss, bounced by the
Yankees when he reached retire
ment age but regarded as one of
baseball’s shrewdest operators.
ON THE managerial bench—
Casey Stengel, another “retired”
Yankee. At 71, Casey became “un
retired” to help George got the
Mets off the ground. Casey
brought in ex-managers Cookie
Lavagetto and Solly Hemus to
help.
The trainer is Gus Mauch, long
time Yankee. The Mets’ stadium
boss and also ticket manager is
another ex-Yankee, Jim Thomson.
Johnny Murphy, former Yan
kee relief pitching ace and one
time Boston Red Sox farm direc
tor, is an assistant to Weiss in
the swivel-chair department.

“EVERYTHING possible will
be done to spruce up the Polo
Grounds,” says Thomson. “We’ll
be there only a year and the
money spent will be a total loss
but we want the first impressions
of the customers to be as good
as we can make it.”
The team? Well, there are few
names like Gil Hodges, Richie
Ashburn, Frank Thomas, Gus
Bell, Roger Craig and Johnny An
tonelli.
