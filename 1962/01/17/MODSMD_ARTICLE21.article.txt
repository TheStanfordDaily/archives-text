# Will Bowling League Fold?
## 
### 
DALLAS, Tex. (UPD—The Na
tional Bowling League, plagued
by the loss of its fourth entry
since start, of (he inaugural sea
son, called another meeting this
weekend to “talk over” the fu
ture.
Although the Los Angeles
Toros had not been competing in
the league for several weeks,
Toro owner Leonard Homel’s de
sion Monday to throw in the
towel touched off a new flurry
of talk about the league folding.
COMMISSIONER Dick Charles
and the six surviving league own-,
ers held a telephone conference
Monday and decided to meet
again this week, probably P’riday
and Saturday in Dallas.
Fort Worth owner Charles
Weisenburg said that while the
owners would talk of whether to
continue operations, “most of the
owners said they wanted to go
on with six teams.”
The loss of Los Angeles cre
ates an added financial burden
since Fresno now is the only West
Coast entry and the long road
trip must be made for just one
match instead of two.
