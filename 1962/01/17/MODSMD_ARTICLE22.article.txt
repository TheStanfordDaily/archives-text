NEW YORK (UPD The
World champion New York Yan
kees shelled out more than one
eigth their record $BOO,OOO pay
roll yesterday just to sign two
players- Whitey Ford and Yogi
Berra. Between them, the two
veteran Yankees will be paid an
estimated $102,000 for 1962.

Ford, whose 25-4 record last
year put him in the 20-victory
class for the first time, became
the highest paid pitcher in Yan
kee history with a $14,000 boost
to $50,000. Berra drew a token
raise of $3,000 to $55,000 for his
17th season with the Yankees but
admitted “that’s still not the big
gest salary I ever got.”
GEN K K A L MANAGER Roy
Harney predicted the Yankees
would have to pay out “at least
$800,000” for baseball’s highest
payroll to corral all the uni
formed members of the club that

swept to the American League
pennant and to a five-game World
Series triumph over the Cincin
nati Reds.
The “big one” Mickey Mantle
already has signed for $85,000.
But still to come are a flock of
others, including home run king
Roger Maris who is said to be
shooting for a 100 per cent hike
to $70,000. Maris hit 61 homers
last season for a major league
record.
“All but a couple of players
will get raises,” said Hamey. “I’d
say there’ll be small cuts for may
be Bob Turley and Bob Cerv but
the others probably will do as
well or a lot bettor than last year.
AMONG THE others is veteran
pither Robin Roberts, obtained
from the Phillies. Roberts had a
1-10 record for the Phils last year
but Hamey said he didn’t expect
to give the veteran right-hander
a cut.
