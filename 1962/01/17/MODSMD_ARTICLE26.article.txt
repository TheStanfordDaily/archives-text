The Southeast Asia Committee
of Asia Desk, HR, is holding its
first meeting of the winter quar
ter at 4:30 p.m. today in the
lower lounge of the Womenâ€™s
Clubhouse.
It is a kickoff meeting for sev
eral new projects. Chief among
these will he an attempt to pro
vide opportunities for Southeast
Asian students on campus to visit
various groups in the San Fran
cisco area.
Many of these foreign students
have had few such opportunities,
so a questionaire will be circu
lated inviting them to check in
terests such as visiting industrial
plants, public schools, scout
troops or eating in various dorms
on the campus.
The Southeast Asia Committee
is also planning to present lec
tures, slide talks and discussions
of current Asian problems at their
meetings this quarter. Anyone in
terested in learning or helping is
encouraged to come.
