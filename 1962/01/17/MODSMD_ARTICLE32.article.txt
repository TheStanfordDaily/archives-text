“If my college adviser had prophesied that studying psy
chology would some day help promote my career in bank
ing, I’d have scoffed. Yet that is exactly what has hap
pened. And when I think about it now the reason seems
obvious. The facts and figures of banking, or of any other
field, are mechanical devices. They take on real meaning

only when related to people.
“Good psychology is also the basis of all teamwork.
And, since most of today's business and scientific prob
lems are too complicated for ‘one man’ solutions, team
work is essential. If you want to be a valuable team player,
and a likely candidate for captain, be the person who
understands people. Learn what it takes for people to
work together in harmony. Learn how to win trust and
confidence. Learn basic human psychology.
“Bear this in mind, too. World tension, community
tension, business tension, even family tension are the
facts of everyday life. The more you know of human
behavior, the better prepared you will be to deal with
these problems.
“So, if you have the chance, take a course devoted to
‘people.’ Your class adviser can probably help you fit a
psychology elective into your schedule. I don’t think
you’ll regret it... I know I didn’t.”
