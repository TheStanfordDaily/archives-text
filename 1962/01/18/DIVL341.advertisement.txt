As in the custom this time of year
for newspapers, magazines, etc. to
choose the outstanding events or per
sons, so it is ours. Onr picks were,
unanimously chosen by an unbiased
panel of particularly qualified judges.
Outstanding customer of the year
was Charlie Goodlow, formerly an
auditor with the State of California,
whose job it was to keep an accurate
count of prisoners at San Quentin. Due
to the high mortality rate of prisoners,
Charlie s job became so complex he
was replaced by an IBM machine
Charlie s ear was found on the Bay
shore with a burned-out transmission,
it would not move forward on in re
verse. Charlie admitted it was his
fault, ordered an exchange transmis
sion, paid his bill in full, and promptly
jumped off the bay bridge; thus void
ing his one-year guarantee.
The event of the year was a little
bit more difficult, the judges were
unanimously split on this item. One
halt voted for the time the competitor’s
building burned down, with the other
half casting their ballot for the shop
stag party that began on Friday and
lasted until Monday. The fact that
several divorces were a result of this
did not deter the male judges in the
least.
Keep it in mind that you have a
chance to become either the person,
or the event of the year by simply
bringing your car to the home of good
service.
