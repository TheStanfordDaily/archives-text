# Professor Hilton Blasts Present Bureaucratic University Trends

(EDITORS NOTE: This Is the conclud
ins part of an article written by Prof. Hilton
in reply to a question submitted by the Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow Committee. Prof.
Hilton is director of the Institute for His
panic American and Luso-Brazilian Studies.)

The first meeting I attended of the Mod
ern Language Association of America
shocked me into the realization of what is
wrong with the humanities in America. I
expected to find an assembly of great schol
ars engaged in significant debate. After all,
if the humanists can’t debate great issues,
who will? Instead, I found a phenomenon
similar to that of the eastern prayer-wheel.
A lot of seedy hopefuls going through mo
tions they scarcely understood, in a mercan
tile atmosphere which was an insult to cul
ture.

I tried to start a debate in the grand old
tradition, such as the one going on in Oxford
now between A.J.P. Taylor and Hugh Trevor
Roper. My attempt fell flat, and I discovered
later that it had been regarded as trouble
making. A Modern Language Association
meeting in Chicago at the end of December
is suggestive of Dante’s frozen hell.

The ancient university was a company of
scholars who were assisted by a number of
functionaries of non academic status to take
care of the mechanical chores of running the
institution.

IN THE UNITED States the roles have
been reversed. As part of what Burnham
calls the managerial revolution, our univer
sities have created a power elite which leaves
the faculty almost powerless. It is often
made up of young men some of whom are
very nice and helpful but some of whom
wallow in the feeling that they are hatchet
men. Intellectually they are usually middle
weights; I have watched them benevolently
as graduate students and have been taken
aback to see them transmuted into executives
giving the faculty snappy orders. I recall one
who was making the most nonsensical sug
gestions about our Luso-Brazilian program;
it suddenly dawned on me that he did not
know that Portuguese was the language of
Brazil. I asked another who clearly did not
know what he was talking about why he did
not examine the facts. He replied in all seri
ousness, “I make proposals first and examine
the facts later.” I hasten to add that he is
no longer with Stanford, and that we are
fortunate to have a distinguished and de
voted administration.

It is interesting for those who analyze the
structure of power to compare an American
university with Franco Spain. There is usu
ally a senate (sometimes called an academic
council) which is essentially an assembly
that dutifully receives information. It corre
sponds to the Spanish Cortes. No one quite
knows where decisions are made. There are
elections to various committees which mean

very lithe since one scarcely knows the
names which appear on the ballots and has
no idea of what the various individuals stand
for.

I ONCE PROPOSED that faculty elec
tions be conducted like school-board elec
tions: individuals would be compelled to run
and state openly what they stood for and
proposed to do. The idea was thought enter
taining and obviously absurd. American uni
versity faculties usually have a house organ
which corresponds to the controlled Spanish
press. In other words, the Congolese should
learn to live in democratic freedom even if
American professors are incapable of so do
ing.

There is obviously an obverse to the
medal. American universities are groat insti
tutions, and Latin American universities,
which are more democratic, in general can
not compare with them. The great feature
of American life today is that in almost
every town there is a college, usually un
known save to God and the local inhabitants,
where earnest men are creating foci of cul
tural life. The so-called bureaucracy of our
universities contains a multitude of devoted
public servants.

Those of us who toil at Stanford know
how much the University owes to men like
Fred Glover and to secretaries such as Ruth
Headley and Eleanor Lane. There is a lot of
hidden idealism; our own Institute of His
panic American and Luso-Brazilian Studies

would not have progressed as it has without
the disinterested and idealistic work of such
men as Sir Harold Mitchell, William Kemnit
zer and James L. Taylor. Finally, in view of
the power-structure of American universities
it is fortunate that Stanford, the University
of California and the State College system
all have remarkable presidents. But suppose
they didn’t?
WHAT CHANGES have been observed in
American universities since 1937? Much of
the change has been change for change’s
sake. Committees are appointed, given a bud
get, and justify themselves by making
changes which are often nonsensical. In 1937
language teaching was influenced by the
Coleman Report which discarded for general
education any attempt to teach the spoken
language, and I actually received instruc
tions, which of course I disregarded, never
to use the spoken language in a reading
class.

Now, following more committees and
more reports, we have gone to the other ex
treme and rely largely on the oral-aural ap
proach. The result is that every year the
students who enter my advanced classes
seem less able to read.

Much change is purely destructive. The
administrators who view themselves as
hatchet-men should realize that it is easy to
desrtoy, hard to create. In the Christian tra
dition, Judas symbolizes man’s perverse
readincs to destroy that which is good. There

is a crying need for substantive progress,
but much change is essentially an attention
getting device. The willingness of American
universities to pay big-name professors sal
aries quite out of line with the regular scale
suggests the feud between Charles Heston
and Sophia Loren to see who will get top
billing in that horse-opera, “The Cid.’’

ONE DEEP TREND has b(H?n observable
over the years. A decade ago. the uninspired
teaching of letters loomed large in the aca
demic landscape, and an injection of the be
havioral sciences was clearly necessary. At
a meeting of the Modern Language Associ
ation (animus meminisse horret!) I gave a
paper applying with interesting results, sta
tistical criteria to literary history. There
upon a Dante specialist discarded his pre
pared paper and launched into a vehement
attack on such sacrilege. He died shortly
afterward; I don’t know to which of Dante’s
circles he went.

Since then our universities have sprouted
with vast machines, including computers.
The result has clearly been a new imbalance.
I was recently invited to give some lectures
in Eastern universities and at one of them
was guest-speaker at a dinner of social sci
entists. In my talk I explained the work of
our Institute, and expounded the need for
combining humanistic and social sicence
skills. I asserted that a foreign area specialist
must have an excellent command
of written and spoken Spanish
and Portuguese (both of which
are constantly changing), that he
must be in constant personal con
tact with the area, and that he
must keep up with the flood of
materials coming out of the 20
republics.
Thereupon, a behavioral scien
tist, who has a large grant to
study public opinion in Latin
America and elsewhere, arose to
say very superciliously that none
of this was necessary, that it was
sufficient to feed selected data
into IBM machines, and that for
example by feeding data into his
machines he had proved that
there was no more political vio
lence in Latin America (which he
incidentally does not know) than
in the United States. To this I
could find no better answer than
“You’re crazy!’’
A DANGEROUS craziness, I
should have added. America is
failing to understand the outside
world, and it avails little to retort
that the outside world does not
understand America. Our Insti
tute has developed extremely
careful techniques, which must
be rigorously applied, but they
would mean nothing without in
sight. The concept of insight is

as elusive as the concept of the
Holy Ghost, but without it all our
mechanical research will be as
sounding brass or a clanging
cymbal.
It will take all our best ener
gies to understand the outside
world, and we cannot devote a
major effort to coping with in
stitutional problems, with all the
frustrations and waste of time
which this involves. Teaching in
an American university is like
driving down Bayshore in the
five-o’clock rush with a nagging
wife constantly back-seat driving
beside one. Committees may yet
kill America, just as the abuses
of bureaucracy were one of the
causes of the decline of the Span
ish Empire. Wo need fewer com
mittees in the bad sens e, and
more working groups of scholars
who are joined together by a
community of intellectual inter
ests.
“A Program of Action for a
Challenging Era”: surely these
words describe the criteria set
down in this article?
