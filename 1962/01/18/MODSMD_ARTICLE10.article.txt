## 
### 
SAN IO DOMINGO ( UPI) Street fighting erupted yesterday
in Santo Domingo following a bloodless palace coup that Tuesday
night ousted the government and set up a new civilian-military
junta. New junta President Huberto Bogaert told the nation in a
radio speech the government change was made to foil an “inter-

■national conspiracy” aimed at
making the Dominican Republic
a second Cuba.

“ONCE ORDER is restored in
all the national territory and the
subversion which is presently
shaking institutional life is domi
nated, elections will be held for
the re-establishment of constitu
tional order,” he pledged.
Bogaert pledged Dominican sup
port of “free world nations,”
especially those in the Americas.
He said the new government
would prevent “by all means” any
effort at a Communist takeover
here.

In Washington, American offi
cials said the United States is
considering withdrawing recogni
tion of the Dominican Republic
because of the takeover by what
was termed a military junta with
all the aspects of a new dictator
ship.

UNCONFIRMED reports said
deposed Joaquin Balaguer was
trying to flee the country. Bala
guer and four other members of
the seven-man council of state

were ousted in an apparent pal
ace coup by armed forces secre
tary Gen. Pedro Rodriguez Eche
varria.

Dispatches from Santiago said
five persons had been killed and
others wounded in the past 24
hours. Army tanks were reported
patroling the streets.
