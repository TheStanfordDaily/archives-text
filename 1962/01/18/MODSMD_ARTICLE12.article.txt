# Red Accusations Could Use Proof

As might be expected, California—the nation’s chief spawning
ground for the crusading anti-Communists—has an Assembly in
terin committee on subversive control. This group currently is
holding hearings on whether a constitutional amendment should
be passed denying tax exemptions and public appointments to mem
bers of the Communist party.

At a hearing in San Francisco, retired Rear Adm. Edward S.
Carmick, who now teaches industrial engineering at San Jose State,
said we are losing hy default ’to the Communists because of a soft
attitude by some educators toward commur’>n. lie declared there
are men teaching in state colleges who could not pass security
checks for “the least important defense jobs.”
Presumably, the admiral-teacher feels that teachers should pass
some kind of security check before being allowed to teach. This is
a view held by many, including some educators. We understand
it, but can’t agree with it. A teacher’s politics should not determine
whether he is hired or fired. Ilis ability as a teacher is the signifi
cant factor, and we see no reason why a Communist, for instance,
shouldn t be allowed to teach at any school—including Stanford—as
long as he teaches his subject well and does not turn the classroom
into an outlet for nothing but his political opinions.
If he goes beyond reason, of course, then he is not fulfilling’iiis
responsibility as a teacher and should not be surprised to find him
self out of a job. But to bar a man from a classroom because of his
political beliefs is contrary to everything a university should stand
for and a statement of lack of trust in students’ ability to realize
when they are being taught and when they are being indoctrinated.
At the same hearing, Karl Prussion—a professional anti-Commu
nist and a participant in the famed Stanford HUAC debate last
winter—claimed that he knows a member of the State Assembly is
a member of the Communist party. In the usual fashion of such
accusers, however, he did not identify the person “because of the
complexity of the law.” Maybe he meant the libel law.

At any rate, Prussion’s statement is a perfect example of how
the free press can he used at times to spread accusations of “the
Communists are everywhere” without being able to furnish the
facts to hack up or refute such statements which intelligent persons
demand.

Following the tenets of good journalism, UPI checked in Sacra
mento and dutifully reported that the Justice Department said it
had no knowledge of a Red in the legislature, and a San Francisco
assemblyman said he would inquire if any complaints had been
made about the legislator who is said—by one man, Prussion—to be
a Communist.

The stage is now set, and one can imagine what would happen
if it is discovered that a member of the Assembly had been a Com
munist in the past. Lives have been ruined too often as the result
of unfounded statements such as Prussion’s, and the public should
realize this and take such unsubstantiated statements for what they
are worth—nothing.
