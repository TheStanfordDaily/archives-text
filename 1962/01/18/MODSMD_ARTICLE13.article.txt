NAVY VAN
Editor, The Daily:
The recent appearance of a U.S.
Naval aviation recruiting van on
the University grounds is not an
“insult to the Stanford commu
nity.” Since the University does,
as the Editor proclaims, hold in
telligence and reason as the
means by which man should
settle his disputes, the “symbol
of force” is a reassuring and wel
come sight to the more realistic
individuals who recognize the pos
sibility of war and the necessity
for defense.
The Editor’s cynicism and sar
castic nature is disturbing. It is
rather discouraging to hear an
intelligent person making snide
remarks about the “greater
glories” of Naval airmen and
sympathizing with Stanford men
who will “unfortunately” be re
quired to serve their country in
a branch of the Armed Forces.
Such an attitude will prove hos
tile to the welfare of the United
States and corruptive to the
moral foundation of Stanford.

WINDS OF FREEDOM 111
Editor, The Daily:
At least three important points
are to be noticed concerning Mr.
Carlson’s reply to Mr. Ketchum’s
article on the Winds of Freedom.
1. What does Mr. Carlson imply
by confirming that the question
“Do the Winds of Freedom really
blow?” actually reached Presi
dent Sterling? Why did President
Sterling choose to speak on ques

tions concerning the social fate
of Stanford graduates rather than
questions of academic freedom, if
not in proof of Mr. Ketchum’s
first point, that Stanford’s social
consciousness is eclipsing its aca
demic consciousness, to the detri
ment of its intellectual leader
ship? Lastly, if President Sterling
has spoken “effectively” on free
dom at Stanford, why hasn’t he
faced the central issues such as
those raised by Mr. Ketchum?
2. As can be seen from the con
text and the grammar of Mr.
Ketchum’s passing inquiry into
fund distribution, Mr. Carlson
misses the point. The meaningful
questions (still unanswered) are;
What is the apportionment of the
total $6,592,139 spent in Humani
ties and Sciences among the cate
gorles of pure science (theory),
applied science (technology), and
humanities? Concerning that
spent in Humanities, how much
went into basic service courses
such as Western Civilization and
Freshman English (remedial Eng
lish)?

3. Mr. Carlson’s elaborate ref
erence to financial matters, to
gether with his misunderstanding
of the basic issues of Mr. Ketch
um’s aritcle testify to Mr. Ketch
um’s second point, that Stanford
is more a business than a univer
sity.

On the whole, Mr. Carlson’s
aritcle merits careful study as an
outstanding example of the naive
optimism mentioned in Mr. Ketch
urn’s fourth point.
