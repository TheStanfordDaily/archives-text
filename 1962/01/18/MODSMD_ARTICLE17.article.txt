## Dose Holds Lead in Indian Cage Stats 
### 
Stanford center Tom Dose con
tinues to hold a lead in most of
the categories of Stanford basket
ball statistics.
The 6-8 sophomore center has
averaged 16.85 points per game to
lead that department by about six
points over junior guard Darrell
Sutherland, who has scored an
even 11 points per game. Third
in that department is senior for
ward John Windsor. Windsor has
averaged nine and a half points
per game.

THEN IN ORDER follow Don
Clemetson, eight and a half, and
Hollis Moore, seven.

Dose has attempted the most
field goals, 213, made the most,
85, and has a 39.9 shooting per
centage, Hollis Moore leads the
regulars with 46 per cent. How
ever, the team leader is forward
Jim Bryan, who is hitting a cool
50 per cent.
Dose has also attempted the
most free throws, 63, and made
the most, 49. Dose, Windsor and
Bob Sommers have the dubious
honor of leading the team in
missed free throws, 4. Dose has
made 77.8 per cent of his free
throws. However, it is Sutherland
who leads in free throw percent
age. He has made 78.1 per cent
of his free throws.
DOSE ALSO leads the rebound
ers. He has pulled down 156 for
a 12-per-game average. He has
collected 13.4 per cent of all re
bounds in the 13 Stanford bas
ketball games to date.
Windsor is Stanfordâ€™s second

leading rebounder, with nine and
a hall per game, Moore is third
with four and a half.
Don Clemetson has a wide lead
in assists. Ho has 26. Moore trails
with 17, The next three l are Suth
erland, 13. Kelly, 12, and Doug
Clemetson. 11.
WINDSOR LEADS in fouls. He
has ben whistled down 43 times.
Dose is second with 37 fouls called
against him, while Moore has 36
violations.
Dose, Windsor and Moore have
each fouled out of one game.
In team statistics, Stanford has
won 11 and lost two. The Cards
have outscored their opponents,
909 to 706. This averages out to
69.9 to 54.3.

Stanford has hit from the field
at a 39.5 per cent rate, as opposed
to 37.3 for the opponents. Stan
ford has the rebounding edge,
633-531.

A REVEALING statistic is the
loss of ball by violation, and bad
passes. This record is kept only
at home games. It shows that
Stanford has lost the ball only 69
times in seven home games, as
opposed to 141 by the opponents.

This evidence of Stanford ball
hawking and coolness under fire
is in part responsible for the Stan
ford resurgence to basketball
power.
