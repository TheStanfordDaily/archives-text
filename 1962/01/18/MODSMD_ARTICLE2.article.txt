# Gardener's Gift Endows Chair For Nobel Winner Bloch
## 
### 
An unusual gift from a one time
gardener will help endow a pro
fessorial chair for Stanford’s first
Nobel Prize winner, it was an
nounced today by President Sterl
ing,

The Max H. Stein Professorship
in Physics will be formally estab
lished in April at investiture cere
monies for Dr. Felix Bloch, who
received the 1952 Nobel award for
physics as a result of his work in
nuclear magnetic resonance.
BLOCH CAME to Stanford in
1931, and his past work has in
cluded research in neutron mag
netic resonance, quantum theory
of ferro magnetism, polarization
of the neutron, and magnetic mo
ments of nuclei.
The late Max Stein came west
to help rebuild San Francisco after
the 1906 earthquake, but instead
found himself a gardener on a
Woodside estate near Stanford.
Later he became a farmer, then
went into the produce business
for himself.
When he died, a retired bachelor
living quietly in Gardena, near-
Los Angeles, he bequeathed his
estate to Stanford after providing
a monthly life income for a surviv
ing brother and sister. The broth
er died recently in Balitmore, Md.
STEIN was unknown on the
campus when the University re
ceived its first communication
from him addressed merely to
“Stanford U.” The letter briefly
listed his assets, stated he had no
family of his own, and had decided
to leave most of his money to
Stanford.

On a visit to the campus soon
afterwards he said he had con
sidered a number of colleges but
what he had seen made him “even
more impressed with Stanford as
the university he would most like
to help.”
Modest in manner, Stein told
Stanford officials he would leave
use of his bequest entirely in uni
versity hands. He asked only that
if it should be used for a building
of any kind, he did not want it

to bear his name. He feared that
because of his background as a
farmer without much formal edu
cation, the building might ac
quire some student nickname like
“Farmer’s Hall.”

WITH HIS BEQUEST in mind,
the Stanford Trustees decided to
apply the money to an endowed
professorship. Then they as
signed it to the Department of
Physics, and chose as its first
holder a faculty member of top
distinction.

“I am honored by my selection
to occupy the Max H. Stein chair,”
said Bloch. “And I am touched
by the story of its origin.”
The Stein bequest is furnishing

a substantial portion of the full
endowment required for a pro
fessorship now usually about
$500,000.
Stein’s beneficence will, with
very real effectiveness, contribute
to the future progress of the Uni
versity,” said Sterling. “We de
rive much encouragement from
the confidence he has placed in
us and in the Stanford program.”
A date for the investiture cere
monies will be set when Bloch
returns from abroad. He is cur
rently visiting universities and
lecturing in India and Israel, and
will receive an honorary degree
from the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem.
