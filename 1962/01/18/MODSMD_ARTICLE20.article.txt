## Friends 'Bugging' Whitey Ford 
### STEVE SNIDER 
NEW YORK (UPI) Whitey
Ford’s friends still are “bugging”
him.
They needled him unmercifully
last winter because he never had
won 20 games in any season for
the New York Yankees but he
thought he had them stopped
when he wound up 1961 with a
spectacular 25-4 record.
“NOW THEY’RE bugging me
because I can’t finish,” said the
whimsical 33-year-old left-hander.
As the highest paid pitcher in
Yankee history, with an estimat
ed $50,000 coming up for ’62,
Whitey can afford to joke about
the fact that while he started
39 games last year he finished
only 11.
“Where would Luis Arroyo be
if I finished ’em all?” he quipped.
Arroyo, king of the Yankee re
lievers, frequently mopped up for
Ford.
ACTUALLY, said Ford, there’s
a mighty good reason he can’t go
all the way more often.
“When I first came up here
they told mo to pitch as hard as
I could as long as I could,” he
said.
“And that’s what I’ve always
done. The Yankees and I figure
if I can keep the score down for
six or seven innings pitching as
hard as I can the Yankees will
get enough runs to win the game.
“I NEVER DID try learning to
pace myself and I’m too old to
change now.”
In the big ones, however, Ford
always seemed to come up with
reserve power. It helped him
crack an honored pitching record
set by Babe Ruth—29% consecu
tive scoreless- innings in. World
Series play. Whitey went 32.
Ford hurled a pair of shutouts
against Pittsburgh in the 1960
Series and another one in his
first appearance against Cincin
nati in 1961, For good measure,
he wont five more whitewash in
nings in his second series start

last fall and then withdrew when
Ruth’s record had fallen with
room to spare.
FORD SAYS he plans nothing
new in ’62 and seems in no hurry
to add “the extra pitch” that
keeps older flingers active beyond
theri normal years.
“It’s the legs that worry pitch
ers when they get to my age,”
Ford explained. "So that’s what
I’ll concent rate on—getting my
legs in shape.”
When Casey Stengel managed
the Yankees, he gave Ford far
loss work than manager Ralph
Houk did last season and chiefly
for that reason Whitey came close
to winning 20 games but never
over the top. Once he won 19,
twice he won 18.

“BUT I KEPT thinking about
winning 20 all the time last year.”
he said. “I knew Houk would
give me the chance and the rest
was up to me and the relievers.”
Arroyo saved 13 games for
Whitey’s victory string by pre
serving leads in the eighth and
ninth innings after Ford departed.
In his final turn of the year,
when Whltey was shooting for
No. 26 against the Red Sox, he
went out of the game in the sev
enth and Arroyo came in to pitch.
Luis blew the lead and another
Yank pitcher, Roland Sheldon,
eventually was credited with the
victoi-y.
Later Ford said with a dead
pan; “I said all along you couldn’t
depend on Luis.”
