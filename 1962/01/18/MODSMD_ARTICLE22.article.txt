# Eastern All-Stars Downed
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) The West
holds an edge in top talent with
the likes of Oscar Robertson, El
gin Baylor and Jerry West, and
with youth on its side, soon may
catch the East in the National
Basketball Association All - Star
game series.
Thai’s the opinion of Fred
Schaus of Los Angeles, who
coached the West in its convinc
ing 150-130 victory over the vet
eran East stars in the 12th annual
game before 15,112 here on Tues
day night. The East still leads
the series 7-5.
“Understand, I’m talking about
individuals, not teams,” Schaus
said. “You have to concede the
Boston Celtics still are the best
team in basketball.”
Bob. Pettit.* 8-year veteran of
the St. Louis 'HaWks, won the

game’s most valuable player tro
phy with a record 27 rebounds.
Wilt Chamberlain, the 7-1 Phila
delphian who holds a 49-point
scoring average, set an NBA All-
Star scoring record wtih 42
points.
Yet mosl observers felt the cat
like Robertson was the difference
with his smooth play making and
4-point third-quarter burst that
put the West out of reach.
“Oscar got us running again in
the third quarter and that broke
open the game,” Schaus said,
"but I won’t argue that Pettit de
served the MVP award. Anytime
a man gets 27 rebounds over the
heads of Chamberlain and Bill
Russell (of Boston), you have to
hand it to him.”
Pettit had 27 votes from writ
ers, Robertson 11 and Baylor 5.
