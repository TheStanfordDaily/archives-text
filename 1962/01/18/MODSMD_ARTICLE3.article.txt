# Punish Immorality?—Hart Ends Lectures
## 
### 
“The enforcement of morality
and its preservation are opposed,”
British legal philosopher H.L.A.
Hart asserted in the last of his
three lectures on “Law. Liberty
and Morality.” yesterday after
noon.

Hart defined the preservation
of morality as “keeping alive the
sentiment that these actions
which are punished are morally
wrong." He questioned the idea
that morality is best (aught by
fear of punishment, noting, “Once
you slap people for what they do.
they begin to think of the slap
and not of the moral factor. Hart
mentioned education, advice, and
argument as better means of

keeping morality alive.
THK CAMP lecturer described
two theses of morality. The mod
erate thesis, which calls morality
the “cement of society” and justi
fies punishment of immorality
because of its tendency to weaken
this cement, he called “utilitari
anism in the air” because of its
lack of proof that all immorality
will do harm.
The extreme thesis terms mor
ality and its enforcement as
things of value apart from their
role as the cement of society.
Hart disagreed with both the
ories, saying that enforcement is
valuable when it protects people
from harm. However, in the case
of deviation from sexual morality
by two adults in privacy, it is
difficult to see the value of the
punishment. In this case there is
neither a criminal nor a victim.
By attempting to punish the
people involved, society is trying
to say that two blacks (the in
fringement of the moral code and
the pain of the punishment ) make
a white.

“I CERTAINLY all of us
probably have felt the appeal
of the idea that if a man has
done something morally repre
hensible to another, he should be
punished,” Hart asserted.
However, Hart asked, ‘‘Can we
speak of vengeance when there
isn’t a victim?” Such a theory
“seems rather like a form of hu
man sacrifice of the infringer to
the moral code.” It seems to as
sume that, not results, but simply
expression of moral condemna
tion. is valuable in itself.
Such a retributive theory is
connected with the denounciative
and populism theories. Denounci
ation is a desire for vengeance
and hatred for the transgressor.
The populism theory asserts that
there is a popular morality and
popular do ma n d that certain
things should not be done.
Hart asserted that democracy
is not a form of morality, but a
form of government. One can re
main a democrat, but still be
vigilant and critical of majority
wishes.
