# LASSU-'No' To Group For Peace
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Editor 
Legislature last night refused
approval of a constitution for a
student “Non-Violent Action for
Peace” organization, but left the
door open for the group to try
again for a LASSU okay so it
can operate on campus.
LASSU debated the proposed
constitution for 45 minutes before

rejecting it with only one dissent
ing vote. ASSU President Bob
Sayler explained the action by
noting “We’re disagreeing with
the constitution,’’ not with the
group’s purpose.
Sayler’s administrative assist
ant, Jock Mcßaine, told members
of the proposed group that the
Legislature By-Laws and Rules
Committee would help with a re
wording of the constitution if they
wished to again attempt to get
a constitution approved.

McBAINE INTRODUCED the
following resolutions which legis
lature adopted in turning down
the constitution:

“Legislature approves of the
overriding purpose of the group.
In short, we endorse the perma
nent establishment of peaceful
conditions in the world.
“However, since the ... consti
tution ... conflicts consistently
with both the ASSU Constitution
and a longstanding University
policy, wo are unable to give our
approval.
“We suggest ... those concern
ed redraft the constitution in
order to comply with the policies
previously mentioned, and the
constitution be resubmitted.”
THE GROUP’S CONSTITU
TION said it would “sponsor in
formative activities for the Stan
ford community, such as talks,
debates, and discussions in quest
of non-violent alternatives to war.
It intends to engage in practical
non-violent action for world dis
armament.”
Nick Shoumatoff, speaking for
the group, said “the forum” would
he their main device for bringing
their views to the community, and
that picketing would be a minor
part of the group’s activity.
Several members of Legislature
protested that the Non-Violent
Action club would infringe on the
activities of HR and Political
Union, It also was suggested that
those interested in the group could
form a caucus in Poli Union, rath
er than a separate organization.
UASSU MEMBERS also voiced
concern that the group might use
the name of Stanford in action.
Shoumatoff said it would not.
Technical aspects of the proposed
constitution also were criticized,
such as the possibility of non-slu
dents gaining membership.

THE GROUP’S CONSTITU
TION said it would “sponsor in
formative activities for the Stan
ford community, such as talks,
debates, and discussions in quest
of non-violent alternatives to war.
It intends to engage in practical
non-violent action for world dis
armament.”
Nick Shoumatoff, speaking for
the group, said “the forum” would
he their main device for bringing
their views to the community, and
that picketing would be a minor
part of the group’s activity.
Several members of Legislature
protested that the Non-Violent
Action club would infringe on the
activities of HR and Political
Union, It also was suggested that
those interested in the group could
form a caucus in Poli Union, rath
er than a separate organization.
UASSU MEMBERS also voiced
concern that the group might use
the name of Stanford in action.
Shoumatoff said it would not.
Technical aspects of the proposed
constitution also were criticized,
such as the possibility of non-slu
dents gaining membership.
Legislature last night refused
approval of a constitution for a
student “Non-Violent Action for
Peace” organization, but left the
door open for the group to try
again for a LASSU okay so it
can operate on campus.
LASSU debated the proposed
constitution for 45 minutes before

rejecting it with only one dissent
ing vote. ASSU President Bob
Sayler explained the action by
noting “We’re disagreeing with
the constitution,’’ not with the
group’s purpose.
Sayler’s administrative assist
ant, Jock Mcßaine, told members
of the proposed group that the
Legislature By-Laws and Rules
Committee would help with a re
wording of the constitution if they
wished to again attempt to get
a constitution approved.

McBAINE INTRODUCED the
following resolutions which legis
lature adopted in turning down
the constitution:

“Legislature approves of the
overriding purpose of the group.
In short, we endorse the perma
nent establishment of peaceful
conditions in the world.
“However, since the ... consti
tution ... conflicts consistently
with both the ASSU Constitution
and a longstanding University
policy, wo are unable to give our
approval.
“We suggest ... those concern
ed redraft the constitution in
order to comply with the policies
previously mentioned, and the
constitution be resubmitted.”
