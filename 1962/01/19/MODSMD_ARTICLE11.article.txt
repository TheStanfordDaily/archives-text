# Kennedy Reveals Record Breaking Peacetime Budget
## Income Tax Reductions Seen Likely 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Presi
dent Kennedy yesterday sent Con
gress a $92.5 billion record peace
time budget geared to U.S. mas
tery of space and stronger mili
tary forces to “strike back deci
sively” against any Communist
attack.

In the first complete fiscal pro
gram of his administration, the
President called for repeal of the
10 per cent tax on train and bus
travel. Officials said the adminis
tration also hoped to reduce in
come taxes somewhat early next
year.

WHILE HIS budget for the 12
months starting July 1 was the
biggest ever in a non-war year,
Kennedy forecast a “modest” $5OO
million surplus. He predicted that
rising prosperity would produce a
record $93 billion in revenues—a
whopping $10.9 billion increase
over this year.

Even so, he asked Congress for
a $lO billion increase in the tem
porary national debt limit to help
the government meet current bills.
This would bring the debt limit to
a record $3OB billion.
Immediate congressional reac
tion was pretty much along party
lines. Democrats generally praised
the President’s program as sound
and designed to promote economic
growth and national security. Re
publicans called it unrealistic and
scoffed at Kennedy’s forecast of
a surplus.

TO PROVIDE stronger and
more versatile military forces, the
President called for almost 1,600
ballistic missiles, more than 30,000
planes and 2,684,000 men under
arms.

For a space effort second to
none, he proposed a $1.4 billion
boost in spending over the current
year. This would provide funds
for such feats as manned orbital
flights looking toward manned
flight to the moon by 1970.

The President did not mention
any general tax reduction. But
Treasury Secreary Douglas Dil
lon said at a budget briefing that
the administration hoped Con
gress would pass early next year
a bill lowering tax rates and plug
ging some loopholes.

IF CONGRESS agrees, most
people probably would get a cut
in their income tax bill, especially
those in the low and middle income
brackets.

Budget Director David E. Bell
defended as reasonable the Presi
dent’s assumption for fiscal pur
poses that the Berlin situation
would permit release by next July
of reservists and guardsmen called
up for German crisis. They would
be replaced by a two-division in
crease in the regular Army.
