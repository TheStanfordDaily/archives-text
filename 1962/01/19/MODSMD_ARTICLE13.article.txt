### 
Several persons have asked ns if Stanford faculty members can
write for the The Daily only by invitation or through letters. The
answer, of course, is no.
The Daily, no matter who is sitting in the editor’s chair, always
welcomes the contributions of faculty members, whether it be
through the letters column or through longer articles. The Stanford
Today and Tomorrow Committee has been running a regular col
umn in the paper which has been at times written by a faculty mem
ber at the invitation of the committee.
But, as we have said, we will be happy to accept at any time
articles of any kind from faculty, for we feel The Daily can perform
a definite service to the Stanford community by voicing the opinions
of its faculty—just as it does its best to provide a vehicle for expres
sion of student opinion.
