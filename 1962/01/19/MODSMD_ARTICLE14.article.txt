HARVARD VS. STANFORD
Editor, The Daily:
Although I have been at Stan
ford since I was a freshman, I
might be considered a Harvard
transfer since I was raised in the
East and lived in the shadow of
Harvard. I, too, am aware of a
profound difference between east
ern and western universities. But
in the end, the difference turns
out to be one of affectations. At
Harvard, you are apt to be con
sidered strange if you discuss
rock and roll, while at Stanford,
you are often frowned upon if
you say anything considered in
tellectual. Though we do not no
tice it, Stanford’s casual atmos
phere is just as affected as Har
vard’s academic one, and if you
doubt this, just count the number
of surf boards in sports cars
parked in front of fraternities
during rushing.
Harvard’s “polysyllabic non
sense” might be as uncomfortable
to us as a four-year civ section,
but perhaps it is the better affec
tation, since discussing the sym
bolism of Proust is more likely
to sharpen our minds than dis
cussing Sylvester Grisby. After
all, we are supposedly here for
academic reasons, and the com
petition between the two univer
sities is an academic one. At least
Harvard graduates, when they
sink back to the easy intellectual
level of Madison Avenue, are
ahead of us because they have
experienced something different.
David H. Thompson
Editor, The Daily;
Under ideal circumstances,
breakfast is a difficult meal. On
the frequent occasions when The

Daily contains articles comparing
some aspect of Stanford with that
of its appointed eastern counter
part, Harvard, it is difficult to
restrain the nausea.
Harvard is a fine school, and
it doubtless has much that Stan
ford would do well to imitate.
However, the reasonable infer
ence from The Daily’s articles is
that the prevailing intellectual,
social, physical, and moral atmos
phere of Harvard should be insti
tuted hero.
Amid the adulation there is
little consideration of whether
particular features of Harvard
are desirable either at that insti
tution or, more important, here.
Moreover, The Daily, perhaps
glassy-eyed from too long staring
across the continent, generally
fails to notice that there are fea
tures worthy of our considera
tion at universities other than
Harvard.
One might wonder how many
of the other schools whose intel
lectual pretentions and achieve
ments rival those of Stanford feel
a similar compulsion to be Har
vard-like.
How many of the first rate
universities have newspapers that
devote five columns of the first
page to the sage observations of
a junior transfer student in her
fourth month at Radcliffe? At
Cornell, for instance, such an ar
ticle would have been saved for
publication in the April 1 issue.
Finally, it is worth noting that
the attempt to emulate every as
pect of Harvard is doomed to fail,
for Harvard, unlike The Daily’s
Stanford, does not seek to be the
carbon copy of another institu
tion.

Under ideal circumstances,
breakfast is a difficult meal. On
the frequent occasions when The

Daily contains articles comparing
some aspect of Stanford with that
of its appointed eastern counter
part, Harvard, it is difficult to
restrain the nausea.
Harvard is a fine school, and
it doubtless has much that Stan
ford would do well to imitate.
However, the reasonable infer
ence from The Daily’s articles is
that the prevailing intellectual,
social, physical, and moral atmos
phere of Harvard should be insti
tuted hero.
Amid the adulation there is
little consideration of whether
particular features of Harvard
are desirable either at that insti
tution or, more important, here.
Moreover, The Daily, perhaps
glassy-eyed from too long staring
across the continent, generally
fails to notice that there are fea
tures worthy of our considera
tion at universities other than
Harvard.
One might wonder how many
of the other schools whose intel
lectual pretentions and achieve
ments rival those of Stanford feel
a similar compulsion to be Har
vard-like.
How many of the first rate
universities have newspapers that
devote five columns of the first
page to the sage observations of
a junior transfer student in her
fourth month at Radcliffe? At
Cornell, for instance, such an ar
ticle would have been saved for
publication in the April 1 issue.
Finally, it is worth noting that
the attempt to emulate every as
pect of Harvard is doomed to fail,
for Harvard, unlike The Daily’s
Stanford, does not seek to be the
carbon copy of another institu
tion.

HARVARD VS. STANFORD
Editor, The Daily:
Although I have been at Stan
ford since I was a freshman, I
might be considered a Harvard
transfer since I was raised in the
East and lived in the shadow of
Harvard. I, too, am aware of a
profound difference between east
ern and western universities. But
in the end, the difference turns
out to be one of affectations. At
Harvard, you are apt to be con
sidered strange if you discuss
rock and roll, while at Stanford,
you are often frowned upon if
you say anything considered in
tellectual. Though we do not no
tice it, Stanford’s casual atmos
phere is just as affected as Har
vard’s academic one, and if you
doubt this, just count the number
of surf boards in sports cars
parked in front of fraternities
during rushing.
Harvard’s “polysyllabic non
sense” might be as uncomfortable
to us as a four-year civ section,
but perhaps it is the better affec
tation, since discussing the sym
bolism of Proust is more likely
to sharpen our minds than dis
cussing Sylvester Grisby. After
