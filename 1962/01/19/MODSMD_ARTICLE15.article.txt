# INDIVIDUAL OPINION
## University Forces Must Balance with Society 
### ROSS HERMANN Daily Staff Writer 
Man the catapult! Prepare to
defend the academic citadel! A
nasty old Navy recruiting van has
violated the sanctity of the aca
demic community and is poison
ing our minds. The evil must be
exorcised!

Such a plea was issued by the
Daily editorial of Jan. 17 and
comes to our attention as one of
the many bits of editorial humor
that have made The Daily the
true rival of the Chappie these
past few months.
Let’s look at what the editorial
said:
“WHAT WE DO object to is
the apparent willingness of the
University to let the van park at
the crossroads of the campus so
that one and all may learn of the
greater glories of the Navy’s air
arm.” (That’s like saying that
Communists should not be
allowed to speak on campus be
cause someone might become con
vinced of the glories of Commu
nism.)
“Quad is not a place for recruit
ing of any kind; it should be re
garded as hallowed ground where
students and faculty meet in the
process of educating and becom
ing educated.” (Quad is a holy
place wherein dwell innocents.
It is the purpose of the Univer
sity to protect their innocence,
which is an indispensable ele
ment of higher education.)
“The presence of such .a symbol
of force at the University where
intelligence and reason are held
up as means by which man
should settle his disputes, is an
insult to the Stanford commu
nity.” (Every symbol with which
we do not agree should be sup

pressed.)
ODDLY ENOUGH, this editor
ial appeals to “intelligence and
reason,” but the reader Is left
with the feeling that the writer
doesn’t really believe what he is
saying.
If he did believe in the qualities
of intelligence and reason, it
would seem that he should have
more confidence in the ability of
the student to make a rational
decision and avoid being hood
winked.
But what is stranger than this
inconsistency is the notion ex
pressed in the editorial that Quad
is somehow a sacred place, like
the inner garden of a monastery,
where the forces of evil (however
you define them) are forbidden
to enter. This notion implies that
the process of education can be
furthered by protecting students
from exposure to the competing
forces in American society.
On the contrary, I think that
the editor would say, as he has
on occasions when the freedom
of Communists has been threat
ened, that a great university is
one where the diverse forces of
society clash in sharp conflict—
a conflict from which emerges a
full understanding of American
society.
ONLY WHEN the balance of
forces within the university ap
proximates the balance of forces
in the whole of society will real
education result. If one force
gains a monopoly in the academic
community which it does not hold
elsewhere —as for example Liber
alism has gained a monopoly dur
ing the last 30 years—then the
result can only be a distorted
view of the rest of society and
less than perfect education.
