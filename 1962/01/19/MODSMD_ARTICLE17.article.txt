## 'I'm a Grad Student—from Harvard' 
### ERNEST R. HABICHT JR 
“I’m a graduate student.”
“Oh? Where from?”
“Harvard.”
Having confronted the reader
with the above seven-letter curse.
I would ordinarily shut up. Under
extreme duress, such as that pro
voked by the first-hand report of
Miss Stassen, it becomes a bit
more difficult to keep silent.
WHETHER ONE IS nurtured
in the academic womb of Harvard
or Stanford, it is a simple task
to begin by bragging. Since my
predecessors have exhausted this
form of introduction, it would
seem best to state the unexciting
truth. The two schools are re
markably dissimilar. The only
valid link is that each offers an
environment favorable to the
process of learning. As for my

self, I am very happy with the
academic opportunities here, but,
obviously having been conditioned
to different social graces (it’s a
bit cold to hang buns in Cam
bridge), I miss certain aspects
of New England.
Since it is most difficult to
transfer to Harvard or Radcliffe
as an undergraduate, Miss Stas
sen must possess an excellent
mind. Were she of the opposite
sex and present at the Harvard
freshman introductory lectures,
her impressions of academic vir
tues might not be quite as super
ficial. Had she been present at
mine (1956) she would have
heard Dr. McGeorge Bundy (Yale
man, Dean of the Harvard faculty
at that time, and since passed on
to the greater glory of the United
States Government) state a few
obvious truths which ran as fol
lows:

“YOU AKE HERE for two pur
poses. First, that you bo im
pressed by the fact that you don’t
really know very much. Secondly,
that you are given a decent con
ditioning of your mental proces
ses in order that you may be in
dependently capable of discerning
your own values and capabilities.
Your curiosity is implicit. The
first of these will hopefully result
from contact with your contem
poraries while the second is up
to us.”

Were I not an impressionable
freshman, this statement, coming
from (shudder) a Yale man,
would have been a bit difficult
to stomach. However, the general
idea stuck with me and seems to
apply no matter where I am.
Now, if you are really curious
about Harvard, I suggest that
you invest in a subscription to
the Harvard Crimson, the college
newspaper. If you are intelligent
and are the proud possessor of
good grades you might follow in
the go-aheadless footsteps of Miss
Stassen (who should soon discern
that for some, neckties make ex
cellent napkins, and that most of
her fellow Cliffies prefer hard
liquor perish the thought —to
sherry).

MISS STASSEN failed to re
mark about the excellent flavor
of shoe leather when she passed
on the revealed truth of Har
vard’s fear of diminishing superi
ority. The only thing those silly
little snobs in Cambridge are wor
ried about is Harvard, what it’s
doing and where it’s going in re
lation to what it’s done and where
it’s been.

Allow me to be so bold as to
suggest that Stanford, under
neath it all and despite the well
publicized opinions of newly ar
rived faculty members and trans
fer students, is doing the same
thing as any other academic in
stitution in its right collective
mind. Minding its own business.
That’s right, just like Harvard,
in a most profitable fashion.
