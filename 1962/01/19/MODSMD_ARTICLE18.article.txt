FORCE JUSTIFIED
Editor, The Daily:
My friend, Ashok, makes the
statement (Individual Opinion,
The Daily, Jan. 17) that if the
use of force was ever justified,
it is justified in the case of Goa.
This, of course, leaves open the
question whether the use of force
is justified, at all. I believe the
answer is in the positive.
There are certain values, like
liberty and equality, which are
greater than the values of peace,
even in these troubled times.
Americans should not find it hard
to see the point, especially with
all that money being spent on de
fence, and the SAC planes ready
to attack on twenty minutesâ€™ no
tice.
Colonialism in any form, at any
time, by any nation, is a denial
of these basic values.
Do we say that taking our
money back from a thief, by
forceful means if necessary, is
disgraceful? If we are willing to
fight for money, why not for
freedom?
