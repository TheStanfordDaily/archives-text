# All We Need-Asteroid Bomb
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI)-A sci
entist came up yesterday with a
chilling suggestion on how a
space power such as Russia could
wipe out much of the world in
1970 by using an "asteroid
bomb.”

It is theoretically possible, said
Dandridge M. Cole of the Gen
eral Electric Company’s missile
and space vehicle department, to
kick a small planet out of its
orbit and send it crashing into
a predetermined spot on earth.
Both Russia and the United
States conceivably could have the
rocket power to bring about this
“cataclysmic military employ
ment of a minor planet” in nine
years or so.
Cole told the annual meeting
of the American Astronautical
Society that an alien race invad
ing the solar system might use
such a weapon to destroy the
entire earth—if this race "wished
to eliminate men as a potential
threat to their operations.”
Asteroids are thousands of
minor planets, ranging in diame
ter from 100 feet or so to 20 miles
or more. Cole suggested that one
could be deliberately diverted so
it would hit the earth with a vio
lence equal to millions of H
bombs.
“A single asteroid bomb strik
ing Kentucky would knock out
the entire eastern half of the
United States including all inhab
ited areas from Boston to Miami,
from Duluth to New Orleans and
from Washington to Omaha.” he
said.
