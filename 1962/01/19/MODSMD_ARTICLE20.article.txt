### 
CAPE CANAVERAL (UP!)—
Preparations proceeded smoothly
yesterday for U.S. plans to shoot
a television transmitter to the
moon and to rocket a man into
orbit around earth next week.
A 10-story rocket is scheduled
to carry a complex 727-pound
probe called “Ranger-3” into
space Monday to collect the most,
detailed photographs ever taken
of the moon.
The second half of the dramatic

space-age doubleheader is slated
for a thunderous blast-off at 4:30
a.m. PST Wednesday. If all goes
well, the shot will hurl 40-year-old
astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. on a
three-orbit journey around earth.
