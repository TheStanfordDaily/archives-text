### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
A Stanford frosh basketball t<
and bad medical news this wed
tomorrow night, in the Pavilion, w
medical news is that forward Frai
Spartans. This will he the first a
month.
THE BAD NEWS hits hard.
Forward Jack Gilbert, who is the
Tribe’s leading scorer, is in the
hospital over the weekend for a
checkup. He has had two infected
wisdom teeth pulled, and will lose
two more this weekend.
Gilbert is definitely out.
As if this isn’t bad enough, sec
ond string center Craig Cordes
has the flu and is a doubtful par
ticipant against San Jose. Cordes
has split playing time just about
equally with starting center John
Murray, and has made over 50
per cent of his shots,
OERIC'H WILL probably take
Gilbert’s place in the starting
lineup as one forward. The other
forward will be manned by Bob
Garner, who was nicknamed
“Goose” at Menlo-Atherton High
School.
Murray will start at center. The
6-8 Eureka boy has averaged
almost 10 points per game.
Guards for Stanford are slated
to be Dick Ragsdale and Rod
Young. Ragsdale leads freshman
shooters with a phenomenal 65
per cent shooting average and

cam that has received both good
k takes on strong San Jose State
ith game time 6; 10 pan. The good
nk Olrich will he able to face the
iction he will have seen in over a

his passing has been the most
entertaining feature of the fresh
man games to date. His and
Young’s spectacular ball-handling
has been responsible for many of
the points scored by the sky
scraping front line.
OTHERS WHO are likely to see
action tomorrow night in reserve
roles include forwar d s Dick
Weaver, Bob Evans and John Pat
terson, center Eric Lochwing, and
guards Mike Preisler and Gary
Loveridge.
The Spartans have a losing rec
ord, but they aren't pushovers.
Stanford students hailing from
Los Angeles will remember Joe
Knox. This 6-6 center was all-CIF
last year, and he threatens to re
write Spartan scoring records.
Two other Spartans to look for
are 6-5 forward John Langenheim
and 5-8 guard Ron Labetich. Lab
etich and Knox load San Jose
scorers, while Knox and Langen
heim have topped the rebounders
of the team from down the Penin
sula.

San Jose uses a pattern offense,
with the pattern to shake Knox
loose.
