# Classy Tribe Hosts Huskies

### BEN TIPTON 
Stanford lays its classy 11-2
season record on Itie line tomor
row night when the powerful
Washington Huskies come to
town. The Indians’ perfect 1-0
Big Five record will also bo un
der fire in action starting at 8
p.m. in the Pavilion.
Washington features Bill Han
sen, an All-Big Five center two
years running and currently the
league’s leading scorer with a
24.3 conference average. Roger
Niva is the second Washington
scorer, sporting an 11.5 median
in four conference games.
CONTROLLING THE back
boards for the Huskies and form
ing one of the strongest front
lines in the league are Hansen,

Ed Corell and Niva. Hansen is
second in Big Five rebounding,
but leads in total rebounds with
47. Coroll and Niva have grabbed
37 and 35 rebounds and are
ranked sixth and seventh in the
conference.

Top three backcourt men for
Washington are Keith Brown,
Dick Reiten and Ron Paul. Brown
is 6-3, Reiten is 6-0, Paul is 6-4,
Corell and Niva are both 6-6, and
Hansen towers at 6-8.
COACH JOHN Grayson’s crew
walloped Oregon and Charlie
Warren, 81-59. but were defeated
by Oregon State and Mel Counts,
55-48. They have lost twice to
UCLA and once to USC in league
play, but possess the biggest up
set of the young conference sea
son, a convincing 14-point victory
over USC’s seventh-ranked na
tionally Trojans in the two clubs’
first meeting.
Stanford’s Indians, leading in
four of five Big Five statistical
departments after one game,
sported their first national rank

ing last week, a sixteenth place
billing by one press service.
Big John Windsor, after a 20-
point outburst against Cal, is
fourth ranked in the Big Five.
Darrell Sutherland and Don Clem
etson were both in the top ten
scorers also, again compliments
of the helpful Bears.
LEADING THE league in re
bounding is sophomore Tom Dose,
who pulled down 11 against Cal
to give him a .134 conference av
erage. He is averaging 12 re
bounds per game over the sea
son, and leads the Indians in
scoring with a 16.85 average.
Windsor upped his average to
a 9.45 per game with his spurt
against Cal. If he has found the
range which made him the Cards’

leading scorer last year, Stanford
will lie hard to beat indeed, as
Washington may find out tomor
row night.
The Huskies represent the
toughest competition the Indians
have had this year, however. The
Indians have looked very good
against competition that has been
something short of outstanding.
The Huskies have at least kept
from looking bad against some
of the best teams in the country.
WASHINGTON'S overwhelm
ing reliance on Hansen makes
him the key to Indian hopes. If
the Cards can stop him, they will
have eliminated nearly 40 per cent
of the Huskies’ conference scor
ing.
The Cards, on the other hand,
showed exceptional balance last
week against Cal. The Bears man
aged to bottle up Dose, but
couldn’t cope with Windsor, Suth
erland and Clemetson.
Washington will bo without the
services of veteran guard Lyle
Bakken, who underwent surgery
for a lorn Achilles tendon after
the first UCLA game. Replacing
him will be Brown, a good shoot
er, but weak on defense.

Tom Dose, Card sophomore
center, has had the flu tills
week, and lost 12 pounds while
missing practice Tuesday ami
Wednesday. Yesterday he went
through full practice and evi
dently is fit to play tomorrow
night against Washington.


JOHN WINDSOR DUNKS the ball. Windsor is Stanford's leading
scorer in Big Five play with a 20 point average. He starts at forward
tomorrow night against Washington.
