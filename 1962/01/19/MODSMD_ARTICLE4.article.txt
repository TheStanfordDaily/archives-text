Frederick O. Glover, Execu
tive Assistant to the President,
says that approval of a new
overseas campus in Taipei, For
mosa, “is very likely in the
near future.”

Investigation is now under
way for the financing of Stan
ford’s latest study center
abroad, and University repre
sentatives are checking on the
proposed site.

Stanford-in-Formosa would be
maintained for specialists in
the Asian languages, to parallel
the recently instituted program
at Keio University in Tokyo.
