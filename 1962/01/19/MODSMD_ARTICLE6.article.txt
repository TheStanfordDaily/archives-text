# Socialist Attacks HU AC As 'Unsavory' Politicians

### NILS WESSELL 
“You can judge a political
movement by the men it calls
heroes and by the men it calls
villains. The HUAC is a hero of
conservatives, and a more unsav
ory lot of characters you cannot
find in American politics.”
Socialist Bogdan Denitch at
tacked American conservatives in
these words last night in a de
bate with R. J. Stevens-Alien,
chairman of the membership
of the Berkeley Young Republi
cans. The Socialist Caucus pre
sented the debate.
STEVENS - ALLEN in defend
ing his kind of conservatism
(“really, it’s libertarianism”),
said that “there should be no leg
islative protection for anyone . ..
everyone should be allowed to ac
quire as much power and money
as he can . . . for sick people,
private charity is available, not
to mention the county poor
house.”
Denitch countered that “the
concern of democratic socialism
is freedom; to preserve freedom,
government intervention is re
quired (hat was not needed in the
simpler days of the 19th century.”
He pointed out that many mi
grant farmers in California are
i so poor they cannot afford any
j medical care regardless of the
seriousness of their illness.
| “Conservatives symbolize a de

feated ideology bewildered in a
revolutionary wo r 1 d,” Denitch
maintained. "They call Eisenhow
er a Communist and thus explain
our international defeats. The
trouble with this attitude is that
it makes political effort point
less.”

STEVENS-ALLEN, not a John
Bircher, also took note of the
anxious international situation:
“Nehru's India is, or will be. a
totalitarian country because India
operates a planned economy
where either you do what the
government tells you or else you
get shot eventually.

“Indians lor the moment have
inferior minds,” he continued.
“Their inferiority is evident from
the fact that their economy per
formance level is inferior to
our s.” Stevens-Alien explained
this reasoning by saying that
“things have to be ideas before
they are things.” Hence, Indians,
because they have inferior things,
have inferior minds, “at the mo
ment, anyway.”
“The Indian mind,” he asserted,
“needs tutoring and he will
choose the best teacher around.
Since the Communists are win
ning. India, like all so-called neu
trals, identifies herself with the
Communist ‘teachers.’ So there
are no true neutrals in the
world.”
“It’s perfectly logical, see!”
