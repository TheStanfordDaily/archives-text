# AT WASHINGTON CONFERENCE
## Bunzel Says Educators to Aid Labor in Unemployment Crisis 
### 
WASHINGTON. D.C. If the
40-hour week is to be shaved to
36 hours through increased use
of automation, the time saved
might well be devoted to educa
tion and re training of workers,
a Stanford political scientist sug
gested to a special National Edu
cation Association seminar here.
John H. Bunzel, associate pro
fessor of political science, told the
gathering that educators could
not of course set policy in what
is primarily a struggle between
business and labor, but that edu
cators could encourage the use of
increased leisure time for educa
tion.
EDUCATION, Bunzel note d,
may well become labor’s ally in
the contest, but he warned, "If
(education I expects the alliance
to become a full partnership, it
will be severely disappointed.”
“American unions have tended
to be highly pragmatic, concen
trating on the immediacies of
working conditions, benefits and
hours, rather than on the ‘larger’
social questions,” he told the
seminar.
Education lies “hardly first” in
labor’s desires, Bunzel said, and

since educators muster only mini
mal political strength, educational
programs are likely to be expend
able.
But educators will definitely

play an important role in helping
solve the unemployment caused
by automation, the Stanford pro
fessor predicted. This shifts part
of the burden to the public, and
"logically enough, the burden will
fall upon the schools.”
FINANCING such a program
through the public schools,
already budgeted to the hilt, will
be a problem. But if unions will
help pick up the tab, there is no
good reason why some of the re
maining support cannot come
from the business world. Bunzel
said.
Support might be forthcoming
from the state level, and indeed,
suggestions for such concrete ac
tion as unemployment benefits
and the broadening of merit rat
ings for those in re-training have
already been urged by the House
Republican Policy Committee.
In addition, some federal aid
would be necessary for depressed
and poor areas which might re
quire relocation of workers. Cleri
cal workers, usually not union
ized, are also victims of automa
tion and must be considered, he
suggested.
