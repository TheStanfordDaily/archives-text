THE TRUE AND TRAGICAL TALE OF
HAPPY JACK SIGAFOOS
Who would have thought that Happy Jack Sigafoos, the boy
the sky never rained on, would teeter on the edge of a life of crime?
Certainly there was no sign of it in his boyhood. His home
life was tranquil and uplifting. His mother was a nice fat lady
who hummed a lot and gave baskets to the poor. His father
was a respected citizen who could imitate more than 400 bird
calls and once saved an elderly widow from drowning in his
good suit. (That is, Mr. Sigafoos was in his good suit; the
elderly widow was in swimming trunks.) Happy Jack’s life
was nothing short of idyllic—till he went off to college.
Here Happy Jack quickly became a typical freshman—
tweedy, seedy, and needy. He learned the joys of rounding out
his personality, and he learned the cost. His allowance vanished
like dew before the morning sun. There were times, it grieves
me to report, when he didn’t even have enough money for a
pack of Marlboro Cigarettes—and you know how miserable
that can be! To be deprived of Marlboro’s matchless flavor, its
easy-drawing filter, its subtly blended tastiness, its refreshing
mildness, its ineffable excellence, its soft pack or flip-top box—
why, it is a prospect to break the heart in twain!
Marlboro-less and miserable, Happy Jack tried to get more
money from home. He wrote long, impassioned letters, pointing
out that the modern, large-capacity girl simply could not be
courted on his meager allowance. But all Jack got back from

home wore tiresome homilies about thrift and prudence.
Then one dark day a sinister sophomore came up to Jack
and said, “For one dollar I will sell you a list of fiendishly clever
lies to tell your father when you need some extra money.’’
He gave Jack the list of fiendishly clover lies. Jack read:
1. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to buy a new
house for the Dean of Men.
2. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to buy a head
stone for Rover, our late beloved dormitory watchdog.
3. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to endow a chair
of Etruscan Art.
4. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to build our
own particle accelerator.
For a moment poor Jack was tempted; surely his father could
not but support all these laudable causes. Then Jack’s good
upbringing came to the fore. He turned to the sinister sopho
more and said, “No, thank you. I could not deceive my aged
parent so. And as for you, sir, I can only say—fie!”
Upon hearing this the sinister sophomore broke into a huge
grin. He whipped off his black hat and pasty face—and who
do you think it was? None other than Mr. Sigafoos, Happy
Jack’s father, that’s who!
“Good lad!” cried Mr. Sigafoos. “You have passed your
tost brilliantly.” With that he gave Happy Jack a half million
dollars in small bills and a red convertible containing power
steering and four nubile maidens.
