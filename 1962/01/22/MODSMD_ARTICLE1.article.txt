# 'C','D';only the Names Have Been Changed
## 
### 
Following a lengthy study of grading practices by the Registrar's
Advisory Committee, the Stanford Academic Council has voted to
change the designation of a “C” grade from “fair” to “satisfactory”
and the description of a “D” from “barely passed” to “minimum
credit." The change reflects both the rising caliber of Stanford stu-

dents and the faculty
belief that tlie present grading!
system for undergraduates |
should be maintained. The Regis
trar’s Advisory Committee re
ports:
"Grading is a relative rather
than an absolute process. . . .
Although the Stanford student
body is now superior to the stu
dent body of a decade ago, the
all-university grade-point average ;
has not risen.
WHAT this indicates is that
our grading system does not and
perhaps cannot measure absolute
standards of achievement; rather,
what the grading system does is
to compare students of the pres
ent student body with each other.
“Parents fail to realize how
standards have risen, not only at
Stanford but at other institutions
of first rank, especially in the
last 15 years. Indeed, a substan
tial part of the student body of
past generations would not be
admitted to Stanford today.
“Failure to recognize th e
changing demands on our stu
dents accounts for a large part
of parental dissatisfaction with
their offsprings’ performance and
hence for some of the student
tension at Stanford.
“THE FEELING that a ‘C is
actually unsatisfactory causes
much of the tension, especially
since few of our students re
ceived ‘C’ grades in secondary
schools.”
The Committee recommended
that letters explaining the grad
ing system lx; sent freshman par
ents before school starts in the
autumn and again at the end of
the fall quarter.
The Registrar’s Advisory Com
mittee recommended the follow
ing description of Stanford’s
grading system be used: “Tradi
tionally, at Stanford, the suggest
ed distribution of passing grades
has been: A, excellent, approxi
mately 15 per cent; B, good, ap
proximately 35 per cent; C, satis
factory, approximately 35 per
cent; D, minimum credit, and F.
approximately 15 per cent.
“GRADES in small and ad
vanced undergraduate courses
and in the Graduate Division
generally have always ranged ap
preciably higher than this and
there is clear evidence that grad
ing is progressively higher as the
level of work becomes more ad
vanced.”
The Committee noted that
“there is little evidence of a slav
ish adherence to the recommend
ed grade distribution.”
While the advisory distribution
has encouraged “desirable uni
formity” in grading, “In practice,
it is not a straight jacket into
which all classes of varying sizes,
ability levels and chance distri
butions are forced,” the Commit
tee added.
SOME people may feel that
present grading standards at
Stanford are too strict, the Com

mitteo reported, but “the facts
are that fewer than two per cent
of all freshmen arc suspended or
disqualified for scholastic rea
sons, although an additional
seven per cent may withdraw
voluntarily at the end of their
first year for a complex of rea
sons, of which failure to achieve
expectations is sometimes one
component . . .
“No matter what is done about
Stanford’s recommended grade
distribution, it is unlikely that
our students will attain the same
success that they had in second
ary schools. From the very na
ture of our much more highly
selected population here, it is
completely impossible that very
many of them will have the same
level of success in relation to
their follows,” the Committee
said.

Following a lengthy study of grading practices by the Registrar's
Advisory Committee, the Stanford Academic Council has voted to
change the designation of a “C” grade from “fair” to “satisfactory”
and the description of a “D” from “barely passed” to “minimum
credit." The change reflects both the rising caliber of Stanford stu-

dents and the faculty
belief that tlie present grading!
