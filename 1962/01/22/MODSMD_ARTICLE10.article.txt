## 6:30 Sunday Morning—And 'IT'S SNOWING!' 
### RON RAPOPORT Associate Editor 
“SNOW?”
“See for yourself.”
“Oh, go back to bed (it was
6:30 in the morning and it had
been a long, hard Saturday
night). It’s just a little frost on
the ground.”
“The hell it’s frost. What do
you think those madmen are do
ing yelling and screaming down
there if it’s only frost. It’s
SNOW.”

Wearily, the skeptic climbed
out of bed and moved to the win
dow.

“MY GOD, the ground is cov
ered and it’s still coming down.
Amazing. You know, I’ve never
seen snow fall. Look at those tur
keys down there. Before this they
never knew there WAS a 6:30 on
Sunday morning, and now look
at them. YOW, what about my
car. I don’t know a thing about
anti-freeze.”

“Too late for anti-freeze now,”
said the Middle-Westerner. “All
you can do is hope.” The sigh of
relief was audible, if cold, when
10 minutes later the old Chevy
started on the first try.
There were more cameras per
square yard than at any other
time in memory. Students, facul
ty, children, old ladies and tired,
but secretly excited husbands
were snapping the Pavilion, the
Church, all corners of the Quad,
the Lake, and palm trees bend
ing under a completely unnatural
burden.

SNOWMEN GREW up quickly.
The lonely figure in front of Bow
man Alumni House was hard put
to keep up with the 10 Roble girls
rushing their masterpiece to com
pletion.
Snowball fights started imme
diately. Two fellows came racing
down Cabrillo Drive in an open
topped convertible. One of them,
riding shot gun, peppered every
car they went past. He was sit
ting next to his ammunition sup
ply; the soggy, “good-packing”
snow on the back of the car.

One girl saw a car driving
slowly past Florence Moore. She
came running across the street
with her hand cocked awkwardly,
waiting until she was within only
a few feet of the approaching
car. She throw and missed by
several yards. She frowned dis
gustedly at the driver who laugh
ed out loud and nearly lost con
trol of his car on an icy spot of
road he hadn’t seen.
“SUNDAY IN SAN Francisco,”
intoned an announcer for KABL,
that most pretentious Oakland
radio station. “The sun comes
brightly through the clouds, shin
ing its warm rays in a pattern of
loveliness on the city.”
“Oh, brother,” said a listener.
“How did you get to work today,
underground cable-car?”
The announcer droned on, and
the snow (light flurries is the
term used by weather forecasters
used to the stuff at more often
than 10-year intervals) kept fall
ing.
