USE OF MONEY
Editor, The Daily:
During the recent Stanford To
day & Tomorrow clambake, I
listened sympathetically while
President Sterling and his ST&T
spokesmen lamented the dispari
ty of funds endowed to the sci
ences in relation to the humani
ties. It seemed plain that the ad
ministration was concerned, yet
hamstrung by conditions which
came with funds channeling them
into the sciences in undue pro
portion.
Then I picked up The Daily and
read of a humble little man with
one-half million dollars who, after
providing for his family, turned
over his estate unconditionally to
the University. Here was an ideal
opportunity to provide funds for
much-needed facilities or profes
sorial chairs to bolster our hun
gry humanities programs. Who
received these unhampered
funds? The Physics department
. . . in order to provide Stanford
with another Nobel Prize re
searcher. Aside from the doubt
ful advantages of having more
ivory-tower men out of the range
of most of Stanford’s undergradu
ates, this allocation of funds
raises eyebrows about the Uni
versity’s professed aim of estab
lishing some just equilibrium in
the use of donated money.

TACIT AGREEMENT
Editor, The Daily:
Though various articles in re
cent Dailies have discussed the
Navy’s right to have a recruiting
van on Quad, fundamental ques
tions lately raised on this univer
sity’s purpose have been all but
ignored. The puerile controversy
over the Navy van, the dating sit
uation, and the bowling alley all
spring from the same source: we
tacitly assume Stanford is al
ready a community for higher
learning, hence Navy recruiters
don’t belong. But where is the evi
dence for this assumption?
If the university is a communi
ty, its members must have genu
ine communication with one an
other. But genuine communica
tion presupposes that personal as
sumptions be presented for mutu
al examination. On the other
hand we frequently use terms
like "maturity,” “moral climate,”
and “academic freedom,” whose
meanings we tacitly agree upon.
What is the effect of tacit agree
ment? It reduces all discussion

to triviality by uncritically as
suming the very concepts the dis
cussion should elucidate.
Genuine communication arises
from a student’s desire to reach
an understanding with others,
while preserving his own integ
rity. But if the student begins by
assuming a common understand
ing of basic concepts, he elimi
nates the integrity of his own as
sumptions. Thus he helps to per
petuate a static climate of opinion
which can proceed only from tacit
assumptions to sterile generali
ties.

What happens to higher learn
ing in this climate? So long as we
found our opinions on tacit as
sumptions, higher learning is re
duced to mere accumulation of
facts.
Until we learn to examine our
tacit agreements Stanford will
not become a community for
higher learning.
