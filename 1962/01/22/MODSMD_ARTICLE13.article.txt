### 
Motorists should carry a paper
towel or tissues in their cars dur
ing this cold weather to wipe ice
or moisture off their windshields
before driving away from the
curb, Police Chief Gordon Davis
warned.
Two accidents in the past two
mornings were caused by driving
when unable to see through
fogged windshields, he said.
Driving with fogged windows is
driving blind, he said. “Clean the
windshield, use your eyes, and
save our pupils.”
