LASSU HIT
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations to the LASSU
for smacking down the applica
tion of the “Non-Violent Action of
Peace” Organization. It is the job
of the LASSU to take care of stu
dent interests and it was obvious
that this organization had differ
ent aims.
There are several dangers ap
parent in such an organization,
all of which were exposed by the
discerning delegates.
1. The group might use the

name of Stanford. Indians, be
ware of your name being used by
a bunch of peace mongers. The
Navy Van is your van. What if
these fanatics had picketed the
van calling for equal space to ad
vertise peace?
2. Any group which would in
fringe on the HR and the Political
Union is of course, suspect. It is
remotely conceivable that this in
fringement might be beneficial
but an ounce of prevention etc.
• 3. This organization held the
possibility of non students attain
ing membership. The idea of a
campus organization having non
students is repellant. What if fac
ulty (gasp) were to join or worse,
wives of students. ASSU money
would be used by people not pay

ing any dues.
In truth it has been said that
you don’t need an enemy if the
LASSU is your friend.
