# Windsor Leads Cardinals To Tenth Straight Victory
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
Big Bill Hansen’s 29 points
couldn’t overcome his teammates’
22 losses of the ball or the 32 free
throw attempts they surrendered
to the Stanford Indians Saturday
night.
The result, as you may have
heard, was a 64-59 Card victory,
their tenth in a row and second
straight in Big Five play. That
makes it 12-2 for the season, and
leaves them still without a con
ference loss.
ONCE AGAIN, the Big Red
placed three players in double fig
ures. John Windsor kept his con
ference average at an oven 19
with an 18-point total. Sophomore
Tom Dose hit 11, and ball-hawk
ing guard Darrell Sutherland tal
lied another 11.

Dose, although still recovering
from the flu, managed to bring
clown seven rebounds, five of
them on offense. He loci Stanford
in that department. Coach Howie
Dallmar played his young ace
sparingly, using reserve center
Mike Ledgerwood for more than
half the game.
It was in his reserves that Dall
mar had the edge over Husky
coach John Grayson, With Ledg
erwood swapping places with
Dose, Doug Clemetson substitut
ing for his slightly injured broth
er Don, and Phil Kelly taking
over when Hollis Moore fouled
out in the second half, the Stan

ford mentor was able to breathe
easily most of the time.
BV THK WAV, it is possible to
tell the Clemetsons apart. Don is
right handed, Doug is a southpaw.
Although Hansen was having
a tremendous night, sinking 10 of
the 15 from the floor, nine out of
12 from the gift line, and leading
all rebounders with 10, the rest of
the Huskies wore having trouble.
Ed Corel!, Washington’s number
three scorer, failed to connect and
ended the evening with a round
zero in the scoring column.
Forward Roger Niva and Guard
Keith Brown picked up some of
the slack, scoring 11 and 10
points. The Huskies got only five
poinls from their reserves,
though, and had to go with their
starting five through almost the
entire game.
STANFORD picked up 1 5
points from the reserves, with
Kelly providing the most notable
performance. After Moore was
whistled out, Kelly drilled all of
six free throw attempts and added
a field goal for an eight-point to
tal. He tied Windsor for second
place Indian rebound honors with
six.

Down by six midway through
the first half, the Indians surged
back to lead at halftime 31-20.
Sutherland and Windsor closed
the gap with their scoring, and
Don Clemetson (the right handed
one) contributed with his play-

Although Hansen was having
a tremendous night, sinking 10 of
the 15 from the floor, nine out of
12 from the gift line, and leading
all rebounders with 10, the rest of
the Huskies wore having trouble.
Ed Corel!, Washington’s number
three scorer, failed to connect and
ended the evening with a round
zero in the scoring column.
Forward Roger Niva and Guard
Keith Brown picked up some of
the slack, scoring 11 and 10
points. The Huskies got only five
poinls from their reserves,
though, and had to go with their
starting five through almost the
entire game.
STANFORD picked up 1 5
points from the reserves, with
Kelly providing the most notable
performance. After Moore was
whistled out, Kelly drilled all of
six free throw attempts and added
a field goal for an eight-point to
tal. He tied Windsor for second
place Indian rebound honors with
six.

Down by six midway through
the first half, the Indians surged
back to lead at halftime 31-20.
Sutherland and Windsor closed
the gap with their scoring, and
Don Clemetson (the right handed
one) contributed with his play-
Big Bill Hansen’s 29 points
couldn’t overcome his teammates’
22 losses of the ball or the 32 free
throw attempts they surrendered
to the Stanford Indians Saturday
night.
The result, as you may have
heard, was a 64-59 Card victory,
their tenth in a row and second
straight in Big Five play. That
makes it 12-2 for the season, and
leaves them still without a con
ference loss.
ONCE AGAIN, the Big Red
placed three players in double fig
ures. John Windsor kept his con
ference average at an oven 19
with an 18-point total. Sophomore
Tom Dose hit 11, and ball-hawk
ing guard Darrell Sutherland tal
lied another 11.

Dose, although still recovering
from the flu, managed to bring
clown seven rebounds, five of
them on offense. He loci Stanford
in that department. Coach Howie
Dallmar played his young ace
sparingly, using reserve center
Mike Ledgerwood for more than
half the game.
It was in his reserves that Dall
mar had the edge over Husky
coach John Grayson, With Ledg
erwood swapping places with
Dose, Doug Clemetson substitut
ing for his slightly injured broth
er Don, and Phil Kelly taking
over when Hollis Moore fouled
out in the second half, the Stan

ford mentor was able to breathe
easily most of the time.
BV THK WAV, it is possible to
tell the Clemetsons apart. Don is
right handed, Doug is a southpaw.
