# Husky Hoopsters Downed

### 
making. Enthusiastic support
from a capacity crowd helped the
Cards.
Washington surged back after
intermission and knotted the
score at 35 all with 15:46 remain
ing as Dose was called for goal
tending. Don Clemetson scored
for the Cards, Washington lost
the ball on a bad pass, and Moore
tallied to make the score 39-35.
THE INDIANS fought to main
tain their margin against Hansen,
but were unable to lengthen it
until the big Husky went to the
bench with his fourth personal
foul throe minutes later. Ledger
wood drilled a free throw and
Sutherland followed with a long
jump shot to extend the Card
lead to 50-41 with 10:35 remain
ing.
The Cards hit their widest mar
gin after a cold spell, extending
the count to 53-41 with about
seven minutes left in the game.
Hansen came back with some
brilliant work under the Indian
basket to close the gap to six

points, but the game was as good
as over.
Stanford can expect trouble
from the Huskies when they next
meet them in Seattle this Satur
day. Dose and Don Clemetson will
both be in top condition, but once
again it will probably be Wash
ington's reserve scoring that will
make the difference.
BEFORE THEIR next Washing
ton tilt, the Cards host the Hus
kicâ€™s arch rivals from Washing
ton State in the Pavilion. The ac
tion starts tonight at eight, with
Stanford favored, hut not over
whelmingly.
