# Italy May Try Bulgarian Pilot For Espionage
## 
### 
ACQUAVIVA, Italy (UPI)
Italy was reported yesterday to
be preparing to try a Bulgarian
air force pilot on espionage
charges despite his story he
crash landed his spy plane 600
yards from a super-secret U.S.
missile base in a bid for political
asylum.
U.S. and Italian counter-intel
ligence agents questioned him
| non-stop in a local hospital here
and obviously did not believe his
story. His plane was jammed
with cameras and secret equip
ment similar to that carried by
Us pilot Francis Gary Powers,
and he passed up chances to land
at two airports.
TIIK PILOT, 22-year-old Milusc
Solakov, flew in high over the
Adriatic Saturday in a flight of
four planes, peeled off and land
ed in an olive grove 30 miles
south of Bari in a maneuver that
immediately recalled the Powers
case. Powers is serving a 10-year
sentence in Russia.
Yesterday Italy lodged a formal
; complaint with Bulgaria over the
i incursion, and informed sources
j said spy charges would be lodged
| against Solakov if a study of his
| secret equipment and the films he
carried proved he was a spy.
While U.S. agents joined Italian
| officials at his bedside, the cam
| eras and film were flown to Rome
i to be processed and studied. Offi-
I dais believed they would find rec
| ords of a spy mission carried out
|b y the specially built and
| equipped Soviet Mig.
THE BULGARIAN mission in
Romo admitted that the plane
| was a Bulgarian Migl7 but said
j that the plane “was forced off its
i course and toward Italy by bad
i weather without the pilot realiz
ing what, was happening.” The
! distance from Bulgaria to Italy is
about 300 miles.
A Bulgarian spokesman said
Solakov was a relatively inex
perienced pilot who would not be
entrusted with a difficult recon
naissance job. The spokesman
said the pilot tried to land on a
road when he found he was lost
and denied that the plane was
“adaptable” to aerial reconnais
sance.
j The pilot was reported in “quite
good” condition despite multiple
| injuries but was still suffering
j from shock. He was able to an
| swer questions by Italian intelli-
I gence agents and two U.S. offi-
I cers who rushed here from Romo
to try to find out how much the
Communists knew about the U.S.
missile bases.
