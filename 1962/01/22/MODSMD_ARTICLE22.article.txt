# Papooses Beat Spartans
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford’s fro s h basketball
team got back on the winning
side of the ledger Saturday with
a convincing, 42-24 victory over
San Jose State. High scorer for
the Cards was forward Frank
Olrich, who hadn’t seen action
since the second game of the sea
son.

Olrich’s 14 points paced a sec
ond half scoring spree which
iced the game for (he Indians,
who had led by only six points at
halftime. Center John Murray
put in 10 more points on his five
field goals.
Guard Dick Ragsdale had quite
a night for himself, shredding the
San Jose defense with pin-point
passes and generally keeping the
Spartans off balance in the sec
ond half. Dick kept up his torrid
shooting average, getting two for
three from the field and one for
one from the foul stripe.
A big factor in the Stanford
win was San Jose’s ice-cold
shooting. The Spartans hit on
only nine of 39 attempts for a

poor 23.1 per cent average.
San Jose’s defense kept the In
dians fairly well bottled up in the
first half, holding them to 17
points. Olrich’s looping jump
shots and Murray’s rebounding

I then broke the game open for
, Stanford.
j Tonight the Papooses tackle
Sacramento City College at 6:10
j p.m. as a preliminary to the var
sity game.
