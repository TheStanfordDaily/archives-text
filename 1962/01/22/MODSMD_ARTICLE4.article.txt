WASHINGTON ( UPl)—Several
U.S. officials expressed keen in
terest yesterday in the case of the
Communist Bulgarian plane car
rying photo reconnaissance equip
ment that crashed Saturday near
a secret NATO missile base in
Italy.
But in contrast to the rash—
and sometimes false—U.S. state
ments after the 1960 U2 plane in
cident, neither the State nor De
fense departments nor key mem
bers of Congress cared to com
ment for the record on the Com
munist plane pending further in
formation.
SPECIFICALLY, they declined
to say whether an attempt might
bo made to seek the release of
US pilot Francis Gary Powers
from a Russian prison in ex
change for the Bulgarian pilot
if it is proven that the Bulgarian
was on an espionage mission.
For such an exchange to be
worked out, Russia wmuld have to
admit that the Communist pilot
was on a spy mission. This was
i considered unlikely unless the
evidence was incontrovertible.
The base near which the plane
j crashed is under NATO command
and is equipped with U.S. mis
siles.
CHAIRMAN J. William Ful
bright. D-Ark., of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
| said that on the surface, judging
I from press reports, the Bulgarian
j plane appeared to be on “an es
| pionage operation.” But he quick -
| ly added that he lacked informa
j tion to judge on his own.
Administration officials said
privately that the Italian govern
; ment was reporting to the United
States on the case, but so far had
said only that the plane was down
and that the pilot, was under in
terrogation.
