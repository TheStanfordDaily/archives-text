Schwarz, a native of Australia,
graduated from University of
Queensland in 1933, attended the
Queensland Medical School, and
received degrees in medicine and
surgery in 1944. For a time, he
served as a psychiatrist in New
South Wales.
SCHWARZ first encountered
Communists at the University of
Queensland, where he engaged
in frequent public debates and
studied Communist texts.
He came to the United States
in 1958 and formed the Christian
Anti-Communist Crusade, after
having discontinued his medical
practice to devote full time to his
cause.
Since 1958, his organization
has grown into a world-wide com
plex carrying anti-Communist
educational programs to various
foreign countries as well as the
United States.
The organization became wide
ly known last August when Dr.
Schwarz filled the Sports Arena
in Los Angeles with his anti-
Communist schools and rallies.
SCHWARZ is presently in
Northern California to conduct
similar programs in Berkeley
during the last week in January.
Sign-ups will be taken today on
the bulletin board of the Political
Science Department for a series
of seminars covering Schwarz’s
address this afternoon. The So
cialist Caucus is sponsoring the
seminars, which wall be led by
various faculty members.

such groups as Schwarz’s in their
historical perspective, why they
appear, what their function is,
and upon what levels of the popu
