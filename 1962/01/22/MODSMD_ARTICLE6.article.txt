# Books Project Needs Help
## 
### 
The llR’s “Books for Africa’’
project has a space problem.
6.000 square feet of it.
75,000 books now in a Navy
warehouse in San Bruno must be

moved this weekend to a place
that hasn’t been found by people
who haven’t been found.
“The Navy has sold its San
Bruno property and we have to
clear out,” said Jim Haas, a soph
omore in charge of the project.
The book drive needs persons to
help in the moving of the books
this weekend. Anyone who wants
to help should contact the Africa
Desk at the I Shack.
“We have to have some place
to house our 75,000 between now
and May,” said Haas. At that
time the government will help
ship 30,000 of them to British
East Africa.
Originally the book drive was
founded simply with the idea in
mind to provide books for Afri
can schools. However, both the
African and the California
schools wanted to broaden its
scope. Thus while the transporta
tion arrangements are being iron
ed out a program of “Sister
schools” is being arranged. Under
such a program, schools will ex
change letters, do joint political
studies, and of course collect or
receive foods, from or for their
“sister school.”
Schools throughout California
have organized book drives
throughout their communities.
