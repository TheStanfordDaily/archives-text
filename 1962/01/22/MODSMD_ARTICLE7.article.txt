# Rhinelander Speaks on Freedom
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
What, exactly, is academic free
dom? How has the concept of
academic freedom developed?

These questions and others re
lated to academic freedom were
considered last night by Prof.
Philip H. Rhinelander in a talk
at the Sigma Nu fraternity house.

Rhinelander said that the prin
ciple of academic freedom is the
bolstering of free inquiry in the
university. Free inquiry, as con
ceived today, is a fairly recent
development on the university
level.

IT WAS only after the Civil
War that research into basic
truth was recognized as a legiti
mate function of educational in
stitutions. Previously, the uni
versity had been restricted to
teaching, and even this was limit
ed to a prescribed curriculum.
Academic freedom itself is a
development of the past fifty
years. Prof. Rhinelander stressed
this point. The first indications
of the present trend in academic
freedom were incidents involving
faculty suspension before and
during World War I.
The president of Harvard set
forth what he considered to be
the basic principles of academic
freedom in 1917 after retaining a
controversial German faculty
member at the expense of a ten
million dollar grant to the uni
versity.
HE SAID a professor should
teach the truth as he understands
it. The professor should also be
unrestrained in the publishing of
the results of his research into
truth although his findings
should be expressed in scholarly
form.
Academic tenure, which ac
cepts only moral turpitude or
serious incompetence as a basis
for dismissal of a faculty mem
ber, is a means of protecting
academic freedom. This tenure is
generally received by a faculty
member with a professorship, or
with more than seven years serv
ice at a university without dis
missal.
Rhinelander also considered the
abuses of academic freedom, and
the consequent desire by some to
limit academic freedom in order
to curb the abuses.
THOSE WHO advocate this
point out that private opinions
voiced by a professor on a subject
outside his own field, or inaccu
rate opinions, or unpopular opin
ions, are often falsely associated
with university policy and may
thus do harm to the school con
cerned.
Rhinelander commented that
such adverse reflections on the
university actually result from
abuses of civil liberty, not aca
demic freedom, and a distinction
between the two should be made.
Other citizens are not restricted
to voicing opinions only on sub
jects within their professional
competence.

Because of his special position,
the professor has a special re
sponsibility to bo accurate in any
statements he makes and to re
mind his audience that his opin
ions may not necessarily be those
of the university. Nevertheless,
abuses of academic freedom that
do occur should be corrected by
suggestion, not penalty.
It is better to keep academic
freedom and risk its abuses
rather than to avoid the abuses at
the cost of limiting free inquiry.

freedom and risk its abuses
rather than to avoid the abuses at
the cost of limiting free inquiry.
What, exactly, is academic free
dom? How has the concept of
academic freedom developed?

These questions and others re
lated to academic freedom were
considered last night by Prof.
Philip H. Rhinelander in a talk
at the Sigma Nu fraternity house.

Rhinelander said that the prin
ciple of academic freedom is the
bolstering of free inquiry in the
university. Free inquiry, as con
ceived today, is a fairly recent
development on the university
level.

IT WAS only after the Civil
War that research into basic
truth was recognized as a legiti
mate function of educational in
stitutions. Previously, the uni
versity had been restricted to
teaching, and even this was limit
ed to a prescribed curriculum.
Academic freedom itself is a
development of the past fifty
years. Prof. Rhinelander stressed
this point. The first indications
of the present trend in academic
freedom were incidents involving
faculty suspension before and
during World War I.
The president of Harvard set
forth what he considered to be
the basic principles of academic
freedom in 1917 after retaining a
controversial German faculty
member at the expense of a ten
million dollar grant to the uni
versity.
HE SAID a professor should
teach the truth as he understands
it. The professor should also be
unrestrained in the publishing of
the results of his research into
truth although his findings
should be expressed in scholarly
form.
Academic tenure, which ac
cepts only moral turpitude or
serious incompetence as a basis
for dismissal of a faculty mem
ber, is a means of protecting
academic freedom. This tenure is
generally received by a faculty
member with a professorship, or
with more than seven years serv
ice at a university without dis
missal.
Rhinelander also considered the
abuses of academic freedom, and
the consequent desire by some to
limit academic freedom in order
to curb the abuses.
THOSE WHO advocate this
point out that private opinions
voiced by a professor on a subject
outside his own field, or inaccu
rate opinions, or unpopular opin
ions, are often falsely associated
with university policy and may
thus do harm to the school con
cerned.
Rhinelander commented that
such adverse reflections on the
university actually result from
abuses of civil liberty, not aca
demic freedom, and a distinction
between the two should be made.
Other citizens are not restricted
to voicing opinions only on sub
jects within their professional
competence.

Because of his special position,
the professor has a special re
sponsibility to bo accurate in any
statements he makes and to re
mind his audience that his opin
ions may not necessarily be those
of the university. Nevertheless,
abuses of academic freedom that
do occur should be corrected by
suggestion, not penalty.
It is better to keep academic
freedom and risk its abuses
rather than to avoid the abuses at
the cost of limiting free inquiry.
