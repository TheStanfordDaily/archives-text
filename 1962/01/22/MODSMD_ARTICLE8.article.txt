To campus residents who looked
in the morning it looked like sonrn
soap-and-water foam like a Christ

rs fell on Stanford early yesterday
th a thick, fluffy layer of white,
out their windows incredulously
■one had sprayed the area with a
mas tree. Dormitories rang with
■shouts of excitement and disbe
lief as residents rushed to get out
into the snow before it melted
away. By late morning it was
melting fast, until snow was left
only in patches and sprinkled on
trees and bushes.

From noon snow fell in varying
amounts, melting on contact, but
heavier flurries in the late after
noon covered the ground with a
thin coating of big flakes.
The snowfall was part of a
storm that dumped up to several
inches of snow on parts of North
ern, Central and even Southern
California.
UNITED PRESS International
reported snow fell in San Fran
cisco as well as San Jose, San
Mateo and other parts of the
Peninsula, including the Skyline
Mountain area, whei’e snow en
thusiasts were lading toboggans
and sleds down the hills at Crys
tal Springs golf course. No snow
was reported in Marin county or
in the Oakland area across the
Bay.
A few groups of men loaded
themselves into convertibles or
pick-up trucks and drove around
campus showering others with
large supplies of snowballs.
Others busied themselves build
ing übiquitous snowmen.
EVEN OLD TIMERS at Stan
ford could remember nothing like
yesterday’s white blanket. Snow
last fell here Christmas week of
1932, when the thin coating lasted
only until mid-morning. UPI re
ported eight-tenths of an inch
fell in San Francisco then.
Police Chief Gordon Davis es
timated yesterday morning’s
snowy blanket as about one inch
thick and the 1932 snowfall here
at only one-fourth inch.
Before that it hadn’t snowed
since 1896, when half an inch fell.
The heaviest snowfall on record
deposited 3.7 inches on San Fran
cisco in 1887.
THE WEATHER BUREAU pre
dicted temperatures of 18-25 last
night and advised protection of
auto radiators, exposed water
pipes and other things that might
be damaged by freezing.
Many campus motorists had
trouble starting their cars, and
service stations in the area were
reported sold out of antifreeze.
At least three Northern Cali
fornia traffic deaths were attrib
uted to the storm, UPI reported.
It said a rash of minor accidents
occurred as cars skidded and col
lided, their drivers tackling the
unfamiliar task of driving on
snow and slush-covered roads.
In the state’s Central Valley
agricultural area, snowfall
ranged from five inches at Lodi
in the northern end of the San
Joaquin valley to mere traces at
Sacramento.
In Southern California snow
was reported in the Hollywood
Hills and at the Los Angeles sub
urbs of La Crescenta and La
Canada. Elsewhere in the area it
rained.

IT WAS AS UNPLEASANT AS BOSTON or New York yesterday once the snow began to fall. Uninitiated
in the joys of frost-bitten feet and dreary slush, Farm students ran through resident halls yesterday
morning at 6:30 to awaken the populace with cries of alarm in English and German.
