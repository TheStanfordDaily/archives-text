FEELING SORRY FOR
TEACHERS!
Teachers-says a teacher's wife
-are lucky. Their income is up.
Their divorce rate is low. Their
kids belong to a privileged
group. In this week’s Saturday
Evening Post, you’ll learn why
most teachers wouldn’t change
their lot. How they have their
pick of jobs. And what qualities
make a good teacher.
