# Bookstore, Stu-Fac To Publicize Authors
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
In a co-operative plan, the
Stanford bookstore and the ASSU
Student-Faculty Board have an
nounced the coming of a new
series of programs to the Stan
ford campus.

The programs are set to re
volve around the publications of
Stanford authors as they come
off the presses and are offered
in the bookstore for the first
time. As a new book is released,

three activities will go into mo
tion:

The Stanford bookstore will
feature the professor’s book in a
main display:

The Stanford Daily will review
it in all cases possible, inviting
guest reviews from scholars, as
well;

The Student-Faculty Board will
initiate plans for a fireside to be
hosted by the author of the book
and held within one to two weeks
after publication date.
THE FIRESIDES will be pub
licized in the bookstore in addi
tion to the regular campus chan
nels.

This program takes its place
not only within the functions of
the Student-Faculty Board, but
as a part of the integral goals of
the bookstore as part of the aca
demic community.

According to William Kimball,
general manager of the book
store, “This bookstore should be
an adjunct to the academic life of
the campus; this comes first,
sales second. This is the trend in
the better colleges.

“We concentrate not on novel
ties and stuffed animals—which
are the most profitable sales, but
in building up a fine selection of
books to serve the academic proj

ects. Stanford is in the vanguard
in this respect.”
KIMBALL, who is assisted by
managers Floyd Matson, Alice
McCutchan, and James Wilson,
cited other programs in which the
bookstore would like to partici
pate. “We hope to work with the
new Union Building. When Rob
ert Frost, for example, is on cam
pus, we would send a display of
his various books over to the
Union, have him as a speaker.
This would take the commercial
aspect out of it.
“Autograph parties are em
barrassing. Many students here
would like to meet various au
thors, but can’t buy their book.”
In conjunction with the pro
gram of and requests by the Stu
dent-Faculty Board, the book
store is formulating a “Stanford
authors” section. This will be a
permanent section of the book
store containing the current non
textbook works of Stanford fac
ulty and staff. Its contents will
be dynamic as it will be kept cur
rent.

WHILE THE COMPILATION
of such a section is requiring in
tense work over a short period of
time, The Daily will be announc
ing its opening in a short time.
Kimball also stated that he en
visioned for the future a foreign
language section with a large se
lection of foreign language books

—recent and classic, fiction and
nonfiction.

Firesides and sign up dates will
be announced throughout the
quarter as publications are re
leased.
