# Denies Right-Wing Affiliation; Urges Teaching of Communism
## 
### BILL REPPY 
Dr. Fred Schwarz, founder of
the Christian Anti-Communism
Crusade, yesterday denied he was
a right-wing radical. To back this
up, he kept his talk on “The Ap
peal of Communism to the In
tellectual” before a capacity
Memorial Auditorium crowd free
from rabble rousing and extrem
ist doctrine.

Much of the audience was hos
tile judging from the occasional
jeering during Ross Hermann’s
introduction of Schwarz.
But the Australian doctor
quickly quieted the hostility ask
ing the audience to put prejudice
aside and listen to him with in
telligence and reason. He was
shown respect throughout his
talk, although hissing could be
heard during the question period
which followed.

“THE FIRST step of Commu
nist conquest,” Schwarz said, “is
the ideological conquest of stu
dents’ minds."

"The majority of the students
in the world are attx-acted to
communism.” he said. “Almost
without exception the Communist
loaders become Communist while
students at universities.” Exam
ples: Mao Tse Tung, Chou En
Lai, Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin.
Communists use four forces to
conquer students’ minds, Schwarz

said.
The first is their “disenchant
ment with capitalism” which
they are convinced must lead to
war and depression. Capitalism
is viewed as inherently evil, and
therefore any tactics the Com
munists employ are considered
legitimate since the aim is to
stamp out capitalism, from
which all evil emanates.
THE SECOND force is the stu
dents’ materialist philosophy:
there is no soul and no universal
good.

Third is their intellectual
pride: they believe they are of
superior intelligence, “ordained
to improve the world.”
The fourth is their unfulfilled
religious need: “Even students
are people, they have passions,
they want a purpose—something
to live and die for.”

“The Marxian argument is
highly logical and therefore ap
peals to students,” Schwarz ad
mitted. However, he asserted, it
is based on premises which are
"incomplete or incorrect.” His ex
ample: in Marx’s theory money
and goods are the only variables,
but the “psychological climate”
exercises great influence on the
circulation of money.
ALSO: many workers now own
shares in industry, a condition
that has grown up since Marx’s
time.

Schwarz named five steps in
the communizing of a country:
1) the ideological conquest of a
few student intellectuals; 2) the
training of these students; 3) sci
entific exploitation of group self
interest, grievance, and ambition;
4) seizure of power; and 5) sci
entific consolidation of power
whqreby the small communist
minority ‘‘establishes dictatorial
monopolistic powers and enslaves
the people.”

“If the communists are to be
stopped, we must answer their
own arguments. I think we can
find those answers,” he said,
raising his voice in power and
firmness.
“W HEN KV E R communists
come into power, slavery is so
universal that people by the mil
lions flee despite great risk,” he
reminded the audience.
“To be victorious in maintain
ing our freedom we must win the
battle for conquest of students’
minds.”
In a question period after his
talk Schwarz said:
• The Communist science of
exploiting good to bring about
evil moans that those who favor
civil liberties (alluding to minis
ters) can be exploited to destroy
these very liberties.
• A Baptist, I begin my debate
with Communists on a basis of
simple faith.
• Communism should be
taught in high school with a
“closed mind,” that is, education
should establish that communism
is an evil system of enslavement
by a minority.
• “A half-witted moron can
see that communism is marching
toward world conquest.”

Communists use four forces to
conquer students’ minds, Schwarz

said.
The first is their “disenchant
ment with capitalism” which
they are convinced must lead to
war and depression. Capitalism
is viewed as inherently evil, and
therefore any tactics the Com
munists employ are considered
legitimate since the aim is to
stamp out capitalism, from
which all evil emanates.
THE SECOND force is the stu
dents’ materialist philosophy:
there is no soul and no universal
good.

Third is their intellectual
pride: they believe they are of
superior intelligence, “ordained
to improve the world.”
The fourth is their unfulfilled
religious need: “Even students
are people, they have passions,
they want a purpose—something
to live and die for.”

“The Marxian argument is
highly logical and therefore ap
peals to students,” Schwarz ad
mitted. However, he asserted, it
is based on premises which are
"incomplete or incorrect.” His ex
ample: in Marx’s theory money
and goods are the only variables,
but the “psychological climate”
exercises great influence on the
circulation of money.
ALSO: many workers now own
shares in industry, a condition
that has grown up since Marx’s
time.

Schwarz named five steps in
the communizing of a country:
1) the ideological conquest of a
few student intellectuals; 2) the
training of these students; 3) sci
entific exploitation of group self
interest, grievance, and ambition;
4) seizure of power; and 5) sci
entific consolidation of power
whqreby the small communist
minority ‘‘establishes dictatorial
monopolistic powers and enslaves
the people.”

“If the communists are to be
stopped, we must answer their
own arguments. I think we can
find those answers,” he said,
raising his voice in power and
firmness.
“W HEN KV E R communists
come into power, slavery is so
universal that people by the mil
lions flee despite great risk,” he
reminded the audience.
“To be victorious in maintain
ing our freedom we must win the
battle for conquest of students’
minds.”
In a question period after his
talk Schwarz said:
• The Communist science of
exploiting good to bring about
evil moans that those who favor
civil liberties (alluding to minis
ters) can be exploited to destroy
these very liberties.
• A Baptist, I begin my debate
with Communists on a basis of
simple faith.
• Communism should be
taught in high school with a
“closed mind,” that is, education
should establish that communism
is an evil system of enslavement
by a minority.
• “A half-witted moron can
see that communism is marching
toward world conquest.”
Dr. Fred Schwarz, founder of
the Christian Anti-Communism
Crusade, yesterday denied he was
a right-wing radical. To back this
up, he kept his talk on “The Ap

Memorial Auditorium crowd free
from rabble rousing and extrem
ist doctrine.

Much of the audience was hos

jeering during Ross Hermann’s
introduction of Schwarz.
But the Australian doctor

aside and listen to him with in

shown respect throughout his
talk, although hissing could be
heard during the question period

Schwarz named five steps in
the communizing of a country:
1) the ideological conquest of a
few student intellectuals; 2) the
training of these students; 3) sci
entific exploitation of group self
interest, grievance, and ambition;
4) seizure of power; and 5) sci
entific consolidation of power
whqreby the small communist
minority ‘‘establishes dictatorial
monopolistic powers and enslaves
the people.”

“If the communists are to be
stopped, we must answer their
own arguments. I think we can
find those answers,” he said,
raising his voice in power and
firmness.
“W HEN KV E R communists
come into power, slavery is so
universal that people by the mil
lions flee despite great risk,” he
reminded the audience.
“To be victorious in maintain
ing our freedom we must win the
battle for conquest of students’
minds.”
In a question period after his
talk Schwarz said:
• The Communist science of
exploiting good to bring about
evil moans that those who favor
civil liberties (alluding to minis
ters) can be exploited to destroy
these very liberties.
• A Baptist, I begin my debate
with Communists on a basis of
simple faith.
• Communism should be
taught in high school with a
“closed mind,” that is, education
should establish that communism
is an evil system of enslavement
by a minority.
• “A half-witted moron can
see that communism is marching
toward world conquest.”
