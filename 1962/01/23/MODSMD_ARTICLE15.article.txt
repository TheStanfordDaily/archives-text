## Investigate the UN

The mounting controversy
about the U.N. though it turns on
the proposed purchase of $lOO
million worth of U.N. bonds, is

plainly not a money question. By
comparison with our expendi
tures for defense, or for agricul
ture, or even for foreign aid, the
sums involved are very small.
The total budget of the U.N. for
last year was $231.7 million and
our share of that was $102.1 mil
lion. This is one-third of 1 per
cent of what we are spending on
defense. Our share of the pro
posed bond issue is to be $lOO
million and, if these bonds were
never repaid, this would be a
minute sum in our public expen
ditures.

The fact is that if the U.N.
serves a good purpose in the
pacification of the world, it is
fabulously cheap at the price.
THE BEAL QUESTION at the
root of the controversy in Con
gress and in the country is
whether the U.N. today, in this
year 1962, serves a purpose
which the United States has good
reason to support and promote,
or whether the U.N. is out of
hand and should be cut down or
even broken up. The movement
to cut down the U.N., if not to
dissolve it, is led by two great
powers, the Soviet Union and
France. The Soviet Union has the
support of the countries of the
Communist bloc and on the other
side along with France are Por
tugal and until recently Belgium.
The United States is the great
power which most actively sup
ports the U.N. Recently it has
had qualified and reluctant sup
port from Great Britain.

Our rather lonesome eminence
among the great powers has
aroused, naturally and properly
enough, much uneasiness and
questioning even among the old
friends of the U.N. in this coun
try. All this cannot and should
not be hushed up. On the con
trary. the activities of the U.N.
and our own part in them should
be investigated thoroughly and
publicly, and the question of the
kind and degree of our reliance
on the U.N. should be thoroughly
discussed.
What is called for is in effect
a vote of confidence by Congress
to determine what we should do
and what we should not do in the
U.N. as it now exists. Such a re
view and vote is in fact overdue.
For the U.N. today is a very dif
ferent organization from the one
which the Senate, with only two
dissenting votes, voted to join in
1945.
THE U.N. TODAY IS THE ere
ation, in which we played the
leading part, of those who in 1949
carried through amendments to
make the General Assembly,
where a two-thirds vote prevails,
the dominant organ over the Se
curity Council where the great
powers have a veto. From that
amendment, sponsored by the
United States, have developed the
anxieties which now disturb Eu
ropean and American opinion.

With the admission of the ex
colonial nations to the General
Assembly a majority is able to
exert strong pressure on the West
European countries Britain,
France, Belgium, in a measure
the Netherlands, and above all
Portugal which have not yet
completed the solution of the
problems of colonialism.
It is being said that the Presi
dent and Ambassador Stevenson
have allowed the Afro-Asian ma
jority in the Assembly to dictate
our foreign policy and to alien
ate our old European allies. This
is misleading. For it does not
take into account the real balance
of interests and of forces within
which, given the world-wide re
sponsibilities of the United States,
wo have to act. The United States
has inherited the role Great Brit
ain occupied for a century. We do
not have the option, which has
been exercised recently by Britain
and France, of abstaining and
standing aside.
WE CANNOT TAKE the view
that our allies in NATO have a
blank check which requires us to
support all their foreign policies,
even those on which we are not
consulted and over which we have

no control. There are, I know,
highly placed Americans who be
lieve that it is our interest and

duty to support the Portuguese
position in Goa, in Mozambique,
in Angola. But can we and should
we support Portugal in resisting
all change? Should our attitude to
Portugal be the same as our atti
tude towards the enlightened na
tions of Western Europe—Brit
ain, France, the Netherlands, and
now, I hope and believe, Belgium?
We cannot do this. Dr. Salazar’s
colonial policy is the same kind of
menace to the public peace as
was Marie Antoinette’s inability
to understand why the hungry
people of Paris did not eat cake.
We cannot pursue a moderate
and conciliatory policy in the Gen
eral Assembly if every zig and
every zag we make in such a tur
bulent situation is to be subject
to veto by Dr. Salazar or the Ka
tanga lobby.

What needs most to be investi
gated, exposed, explained, and
debated is the Congo affair. The
U.N. intervention there has been
a big and dangerous experiment,
and whether it succeeds—as is
now conceivable—or whether it
fails, which is always possible,
the nation must face the question
of whether there was any alter
native which would not have been
infinitely more dangerous.

IN ENTERING UPON this de
bate about the U.N. it is useful
to remind ourselves of what Sen.
Vandenberg and John Foster
Dulles said about the Charter
when it was before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
Mr. Dulles said:

"Now, of course, I recognize
that this Charter does not do
what many people would like—
to guarantee at a single step per
petual peace . . . but the world
does not move at a single step
from a condition of virtual an
archy to a condition of well
rounded political order. Those
steps are made falteringly. There
are missteps; there have been
missteps. This, for all I know,
may again turn out to be a mis
step. But when (a previous wit
ness) said . . . that he did not
himself know what to do, I say
that here is, at least a step which
presents itself to us, which may
be, or which has a good chance
to be, a step forward, onto new,
firm, and higher ground.” That is
the language of an experienced
and reasonable man.
This is what Sen. Vandenberg
said to the Senate about ratifica
tion:
“YOU MAY TELL, me that I
have but to scan the present
world with realistic eyes in order
to see these fine phrases often
contemptuously reduced to a con
temporary shambles, . . . that
some of the signatories to this
Charter practise the precise op
posite of what they preach even
as they sign, . . . that the after
math of this war seems to threat
en the utter disintegration of
these ideals at the very moment
they are born. I reply that the
nearer right you may be in any
such gloomy indictment, the
greater is the need for the new
pattern which promises at least to
try to stem these evil tides, . . .
if the effort fails, we can at least
face the consequence with clean
hands.”
