# New Frontier for Churches Seen on College Campuses

NEW YORK (UPD—A major
New Frontier of the church is on
the college campus.
Leaders of nearly every denom
ination report increasing num
bers of young people are straying
from churches when they become
old enough to leave home for col
lege or jobs.
The Methodist Church, which
long has regarded youth as its
"growing edge,” recently con
ducted its first national convoca
tion on preaching in college and
university communities. About
200 ministers assigned to academ
ic communities attended the meet
ing in Cincinnati to seek new
ways to increase student partici
pation in religious activities.
DR. DEANE William Ferm,
dean of the college chapel at
Mount Holyoke College, was the
chief speaker. He delivered a
series of talks in which he point
ed up the problems and offered
possible solutions.
"The college campus is the
greatest mission field in the
world today for the church,”
Ferm said. “Here (he leaders of
the next generation are to be

found. Here the competing
‘faiths’ meet head-on in a life-and
death struggle for the minds and
hearts of men. Here the course of
the world may he determined.”
Form said negative images of
the church are found in church
related colleges as well as in pri
vate and state institutions of
higher learning. Among these
"negative images” he listed;
• The image of credulity, of a
church too sure of itself, too fear
ful of healthy skepticism and too
prone to seek easy answers.
• THE IMAGE of a church
that is too rigid, authoritarian
and seeking obedience to external
authority Instead of to individual
freedom.
• The image of a church that
docs not speak the language of
young people. The churches seem
to bo more interested in commu
nicating with one another than
with the academic family.
• The image of a church that
can answer questions siudents are
NOT asking while ignoring the
questions they ARE asking.
“The church is credulous, au
thoritarian, speaks a foreign lan
guage, is socially insensitive and
largely irrelevant.” Ferm said.

"To be sure, there are other nega
tive images of (he church. These
are, however, the major ones.”
HE SAID THAT while the
church is not entirely to blame
for its shortcomings, it must boar
a share of the responsibility. The
task of preaching in an academic
community therefore is in part
one of breaking down “false im
ages,” he said.
Berm offered a list of steps
that could be taken to aid in de
velopment of a positive image of
the church. Among them were:
• The church should appreci
ate and encourage honest doubt
and admit it does not know the
final answers. The crucial prob
lem is to get students to be con
structive in their doubting.
• The church should be a
teaching community seeking to
stretch the minds and not just
inspire the hearts of the congre
gation.
« THE < TILTH H should be
concerned with the issues that
students and teachers regard as
critical.
• The church, through the
clergy, should become as Involved
as possible in college life.
• The church should educate
its members in the meaning of
theological terminology.
• The church should be sensi
tive to social issues of the day,
such as racial discrimination,
economic injustice, housing and
world understanding, and become
involved in them.
• The church must keep con
stantly in mind that a Gospel of
human redemption that helps
men find themselves is at the root
of everything the church does or
says.
“The image of the church in
the academic community,” Form
said, “should be that of making
out • a good substantial case for
her faith in the midst of ideolog
ical conflict and spiritual confu
sion.”
