FEDERAL AID TO ARTS
Editor, The Daily:
I have been sick and could not
deliver this letter earlier but I
feel it is still timely.
I see that you have advocated
another step toward the totali
tarian state in which choice is not
to be exercised by each individual
but by the all knowing Federal
Government. I refer to your edi
torial of January 5, 1962, which
suggested that people in the
United States he forced to pay
part of their earning to support
what some commission of experts
calls "culture” or “art” in order
that a small number of art lovers
be able to continue to enjoy said
art. I say a small number be
cause if there were a large num
ber of people really interested in
what you consider the arts then
there would be no need for your
ridiculous request for federal aid.

If you are really interested in
preserving American culture why
not put your efforts toward get
ting voluntary and active sup
port of the arts on a personal
level, rather than a bureaucratic
passive submission to their ex
istence. I know that getting vol
untary active support seems an
outmoded and troublesome proc
ess for you people who feel that
you know how others should dis
pose of their earnings; but if you
are going to w r ear that label—
“liberal-defender of civil liberties
and freedom” with any integrity
at all, you should acquaint your

self with the voluntary transac
tions of free men which have
made this country such a nice
place to live.
