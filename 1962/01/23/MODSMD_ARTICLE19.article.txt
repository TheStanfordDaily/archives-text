# Italians Call Bulgarian Spy
## 
### 
ROME (UPD—The Italian De
fense Ministry said last night in
a cautiously worded statement
there were “indications" the Bul
garian jet fighter which crash
landed Saturday near a NATO
missile base in southern Italy was
a spy plane.
A high government official was
less reserved. He said the plane
“definitely” was engaged in spy
ing on U.S. missile bases which
dot Italy and indicated the pilot,
24-year-old 2nd Lt. Milusc Sola
kov, could be sentenced to 15
years in another Francis Gary
Powers spv trial.
The Defense Department said it
was continuing questioning of the
pilot and the examination of the
plane “to establish if the indica
tions so far existing of a true
case of aerial espionage can be
further supported.”

Film from the several aerial re
connaissance cameras aboard the
Mig 17 jet were under scrutiny by
Italian and American NATO offi
cials to see if they showed sites
of the missile bases built by the
United States as pail of the
NATO defense plan for Europe.
