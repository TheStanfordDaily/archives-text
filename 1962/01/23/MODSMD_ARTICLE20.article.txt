## Sacramento Falls To Frosh Cagers 
### TOM PARKER 
A slow Stanford Frosh team fi
nally downed Sacramento City
College in basketball action last
night. With starters Dick Rags
dale and Jack Gilbert missing
from the line-up, the Papooses
were missing their high scorer
and leading playmaker.
Mike Preisler and Rod Young
started as guards and Bob Gar
ner and Frank Olrich as for
wards. John Murray was in his
usual starting position as center.
THE FIRST few minutes of
play dragged by as neither team
scored a field goal for over five
minutes. Then Sacramento final
ly scored. The Stanfordites wait
ed for two more minutes before
they finally sank one.
Not until forward Dick Weaver

came in for the Papooses late in
the first half, did the Frosh show
the spark that won them six
games.
Weaver was the high scorer for
the not-so-Blg Red with 12 points.
Murray was second for the Pa
pooses with nine.
Sacramento’s high scorer was
forward Bob Ferrell with 11
points.
CENTER JOHN Murray didn’t
seem to have the spark he has
had in previous games and (he
shorter Sacramento players out
rebounded the big hoopster.
And so the game dragged its
way out for forty minutes with
a final score of 45-32.
Perhaps the Stanford frosh will
be hustling again Friday, whim
they meet San Jose State frosh
in San Jose.

guard of Cougar Terry Ball on a fast break play.
