ington State Cougars last night
by a score of 67-51 at the Pavilion.
The big 6-8 cent dr collected 27
points, tying his previous high
score of the season against Ore
gon. Dose shot 11 for 20 from the

lead on a Dose lay-up and built
up an 11-4 margin before the
Cougars began to find the range.
Led by guard Terry Ball, WSU
finally surged ahead at 17-15.
Then John Windsor and Mike
Ledgerwood put the Indians
ahead for good with a series of
drives and hook shots that
dazzled the near-capacity crowd.

guarding three diffeient Cou
gars, blocking a shot, and grab
bing the rebound. Mike netted
seven points and six rebounds for
the night.
Stanford led at halftime, 38-27,
after scoring the final 10 points
of the half.
Dose was red hot as the second
half got under way, sinking 10 of
the Indians’ first 13 points. Most
of the big center’s scoring was
made possible by high lob passes
from the Clemetsons.
One of Don Clemetson’s high
passes to John Windsor under
neath the basket was so accurate
that it appeared to many spec
tators to go through the net.
However, the referee did not rule
a field goal.

the past two games, got, only
eight points, but hauled down
seven rebounds and made two
fancy driving lay-in shots that
drew heavy cheering from the
crowd.

scoring was scattered. Forward
