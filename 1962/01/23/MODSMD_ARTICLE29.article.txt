Late in the Autumn Quarter
the Student Faculty Employment
Committee disapproved the re
quest of a student to represent
the Liggett & Myers Tobacco
Company in a “Grand Prix Give
away Strictly for Stanford Uni
versity.” The proposal would
have involved a drawing with the
prize being a Sprite automobile.
In disapproving the request
the Committee stated its policy
not to approve the identification
of the University with a contest
in which the outcome is deter

mined primarily by chance.
As a result of a misunderstand
ing, posters announcing the con
test were distributed before the
Committee’s action. These posters
were withdrawn during the
Christmas holidays and the Lig
gett & Myers Company was re
quired to discontinue the contest.
