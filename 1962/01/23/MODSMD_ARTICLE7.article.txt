# Schwarz Says Communism Attracts Most Collegians
## Dim Hopes for Rusk's Plan to Oust Castro 
### 
PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay
tUPI)—AII-out efforts by the U.S.
to seek the ouster of Fidel Cas
tro’s Cuba from the inter-Ameri
can system ran into unexpected
new opposition yesterday. Hopes
for any unanimous action at the
hemispheric parley here virtually
disintegrated.

A highly placed source said U.S,
Secretary of State Dean Rusk
told key South American foreign
ministers gathered here for the
opening session of the inter-
American meeting that the Cas
tro regime is not the representa
tive government of Cuba and
should be ejected from the hemis
pheric community.
BUT AS RUSK took his tough
stand on the issue reliable sources
said the Haitian delegation had
made known its unwillingness to
vote in favor of any sanctions
against Cuba. This was a blow to
anti-Castro forces which had
counted on the Haitian vote.
At the same time, Chilean For
eign Minister Carlos Martinez So
tomayor said flatly that Chile op
posed sanctions against Cuba,
thus barring any r hope for a
change in that nation’s position.
INFORMED QUARTERS said
the American delegation has vir
tually abandoned hope of ham
mering out any proposal that
would be agreeable to all 20 hem
ispheric nations. Instead the
United States will concentrate on
finding the strongest possible
measure that would garner the
minimum necessity of 14 votes—
two-thirds of the membership of
the Organization of American
States (OAS).

Rusk was said to have empha
sized that his stand for maximum
action against Cuba is not a lone
U.S. position “but the position of
13 sovereign nations totaling 190,-
000,000 people who feel very
strongly the menace of Cuban
Communism.”
