1 Then you’d like computer programming, the new career
that makes full use of your logical talents. If you have a
keen analytical and logical mind —and want to use it fully
after college—then computer programming at IBM may
be just the career you’ve always looked forward to.
A computer programmer examines a business, indus
trial, or scientific problem and translates it into a special
mathematical-logical language for the computer. Working
at amazing speeds, the computer can produce answers
in minutes, even seconds. Some of these answers might
actually take days to produce by other methods.
The problems are interesting and varied. IBM pro
grammers have used computers to predict hurricanes, tell
'days ahead where satellites will be in space, locate the
best factory sites for businessmen, and aid highway engi
neers in laying out roads.
No previous knowledge of computers is necessary; an
intensive training course will equip you for your work. But
you should have an analytical and logical turn of mind,
and at least two years of college mathematics.
In computer programming you will find that the salaries
are excellent, and that the future can be virtually as un
limited as the future of the computer itself. There are
ample opportunities for continued education.
The IBM representative will interview on your campus.
He will be glad to give you details about this fascinating
new profession. Your placement office will make an ap
pointment. All qualified applicants will be considered for
employment without regard to race, creed, color or na
tional origin. Or you may write, outlining briefly your
background, to: Manager of Technical Recruitment, IBM
Corp., Dept. 902, 590 Madison Avenue, New York 22, N. Y,
