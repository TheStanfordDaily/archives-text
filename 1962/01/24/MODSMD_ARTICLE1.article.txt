# 'TV Belongs to the People' Says Producer Saudek
## 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
Television will become “a peo
ple’s stadium” where viewers can
see the best in sports, journal
ism. humor and the arts, if the
vision of TV producer Robert
Saudek comes true.
“Television can become the
greatest show on earth,” but it
belongs to the people, not adver
tisers, agents or even the F.C.C.,
he told last night’s Tuesday Eve
nign Series audience.
“IF THE LEADERS of tele
vision raise the level of taste
gradually and deliberately, their
public will not desert them;” the
150 million Americans will not
stir out of their easy chairs, Sau
dek said.

He praised as a growing force
the non-profit institution that
guarantees standards for their
own sakes, giving as an example
the Associated Press, a coopera
tive, non-profit association pro
viding services to its members for
quality journalism.

He looked forward to a time
when the great artists, statesmen
and experts in all fields will be
in good public demand and tele
vision programs will be judged
not by how many people watched.

but by how long they are remem
bered.
“TELEVISION MUST GROW
its own lusty tradition in the
arts.” He noted television started
out borrowing people accustomed
to other arts and audiences. Most
actors or playwrights will put
much more work into a broad
way play than a T.V. show
though the latter has a much
greater audience, he said.
Today’s true artists, however,
strive for great art wherever
they’re working; he said, citing
as examples Leonard Bernstein
whose shows he produces, and
Agnes De Mille. Succeeding T.V.
workers will work for art, he
said. Applause for artists in T.V.
is deceptively delayed but even
tually will make itself felt, Sau
dek added.

“The source of T.V.’s greatest
potential strength is the common
people,” Saudek declared. Art
started going down when plays
became too expensive for the
working girl and authors began
to write for the critic alone, he
felt. He thinks television can be
come the great theater of the fu
ture.

Patronage of the arts is the
center of T.V. in Europe on both
sides of the iron curtain, but in
the U.S. quality programs are
used as a change of pace or an
occasional thing to show they can
be cultured.
To show the obstacles Saudek
said creative art encounters on
television, he spun this story of
what would happen to Beethoven
if he decided to do the Ninth
Symphony on television:
Beethoven submits a sketch to

the network telling how he plan
ned his symphony. They say that
four movements set a good pat
tern for a program, leaving con
venient spots for commercials.
But the slow second movement
hits at the critical half-hour when
the audience gets fidgety and
starts to dial around. He has to
realize he's bucking Garry Moore,
so he’ll have to jazz it up a bit.

THE LAST MOVEMENT with
the chorus, due to budget prob
lems, is “strictly out.” It won’t
add a single rating point, and
the lyrics would sound pretty
pagan on a Sunday afternoon es
specially in the Bible belt. Instead
of a chorus they might let him
keep four vocal soloists. The bass

soloist hates his part, tolls his
agent it would hurt his image as
a singer, and changes it to his
liking. The advertising agent in
sists a part be added for the sym
bol-playing company president,
reminding Beethoven “with re
newal coming up I’m thinking of
your future with the operation.”
But the sponsor allows the 10th
Symphony to lapse, so it is never
written.

KZSU, 880, will broadcast a
tape of Mr. Robert Saudek’s
speech tomorrow at 3 p.m.
KZSU will make it a policy
to sign-on one hour earlier,
at 3 o’clock, each Wednesday
afternoon in order to be able
to broadcast all of the Tues
day Evening Series. This time
will bo devoted to rebroad
casting of other campus
speakers, also.
