# U.S. Asks Support In Branding Cuba "Russian Satellite”

PUNTA DE ESTE. Uruguay
(UPI)— I The United Stales yester
day abandoned efforts to have
collective sanctions imposed on
Cuba and launched a new cam
paign to brand the Fidel Castro
regime a Communist satellite and
force it out of the American com
munity of nations.
The switch in strategy at the
eighth inter-American conference
was intended to “isolate Castro
and brand the Cuban regime for
what it is—a Communist satel
lite,” a U.S. delegation spokesman
said.

HE CONFIDENTLY predicted
that the U.S. would be able to get
the 14 votes for the new measure
which would constitute the two
thirds majority necessary for con
ference ratification.

Although conceding that pres
ent inter-American treaties and
charters do not specifically pro
vi d e expulsion clauses, the
spokesman said the U.S. was con
fident it could establish a legal
basis for the ouster.

Only seven American nations
presently have diplomatic rela
tions with Cuba and the spokes
man said “we are not worried
about the handful of ambassa
dors in Havana . . .

“WE WANT CONFERENCE
action that will formally expose
Castro as a Communist satellite
incompatible with the inter-
American system.

“We think we are going to get
enough votes for this one.”

The new American plan was
said to be picking up support

among wavering delegations. It
would force Cuba out of all hemi
sphere economic, defense and po
litical treaties and organizations.
Delegates privately considered
the new U.S. formula for confer
ence action as “tougher and hard
er” on the Castro regime than
political or economic sanctions.
Thirteen nations have already
broken relations with Castro and,
with 80 per cent of Cuba’s trade
now in Red bloc hands, the hemi
sphere’s share of Cuban trade
amounts to less than five per
cent.

DELEGATES TO THE confer
ence met in regular general ses
sion for the first time yesterday
but the real work was being done
in the tiny, pastel-painted rooms
of the swank hotel San Rafael.

There was growing confidence
that the hemispheric unity
threatened by original U.S. ef
forts to get sanctions against
Castro could be preserved under
the new U.S. formula.

A secret U.S. working paper
distributed to delegations out
lined the new program. It in
cludes this concept:
—The Cuban regime to be sus
pended or expelled from the inter-
American system. When the pres
ent Communist regime topples
and a democratic regime is re
established, Cuba would return to
the American family circle.
