## Indispensable Issues 
### 
If we did not know that Russia
and China are bumping along on
a very rocky road, it would be
harder to be calm about the West
ern troubles in the United Na
tions and in NATO. Nevertheless,
the disunity of the Western pow
ers is alarming. Why, in the face
of the great pressures from the
Communist coalition, can the
Western nations indulge in so
much stubborn separatism? The
answer must be, 1 suppose, that
the separate nations do not really
believe seriously, deep in their
inmost minds, that the threat
from the East is what they say
it is. If they really believed that
the threat is great and imminent,
they would sink their differences
and unite at once, overriding all
mere questions of pride, gran
deur, prestige, glory and paro
chial self-interest.

It can be said then, probably
with much truth, that the West
ern powers are confident that the
balance of terror will maintain
the peace. Because the fearful
threat of a thermonuclear war is
relaxed, there is much less com
pulsion to unite on other matters.
BUT EVEN IF thermonuclear
war is most improbable at the
present time, there are momen
tous issues that have to be met,
great problems that have to be
dealt with. The United States has
enormous and inescapable respon
sibilities, and it is well for u$ to
remind ourselves why NATO and
the U.N. are indispensable to this
country in meeting these respon
sibilities.
NATO is the military center of
the Atlantic Community, which
includes North and South Ameri
ca, non-Communist Europe, and
the countries associated with it
in Africa. If NATO did not exist,
it would have to be created for
the defense of the whole Atlantic
Community. Whether a particular
country, like Switzerland, for ex
ample, is formally a member of
NATO or not, its security is a
vital interest of the United States.
Therefore, we cannot tolerate
the disruption of the NATO alli
ance, and in the long run—after
all differences have been heard,
debated and negotiated—our in
fluence will come down decisively
against separatism. If it ever
comes to that, our influence will

be decisive.
AS FOR THE United Nations,
our commitment to preserve it is,
in fact, indissoluble. With the ad
mission of some 50 new states we
are no longer the undisputed
loaders of the United Nations. We
have done very well on the China
question but, as we have seen in
the Goa question, we cannot al
ways prevail. There are some
Americans who, like spoiled chil
dren, wish to stop playing if they
cannot always win the game. But
the grown-up view of the United
Nations is, I submit, that if the
50 new members do not agree with
us inside the U.N. in all probabili
ty they would disagree with us
even more violently outside the
U.N. Those new nations would
still exist if there were no United
Nations that they could belong to.
In spile of everything that can
be said against it, the U.N. is in
dispensable because it keeps open
the contact and communications
between the old powers and the
new nations, and among all the
continents. The speeches and res
olutions in the General Assembly
are often annoying. The actions
of the U.N., as in the Congo, are
sometimes inefficient, and on cer
tain issues such as Goa they are
far from ideal. But what really
matters is that so many nations
have representatives in one city
at the same time, and that they
have their recognized place to
meet and that they can talk with
one another frequently and casu
ally in the lounges and the corri
dors, and in private apartments
and houses. No one can ever
measui’e the amount of good that
this does. But tnere can be no
doubt that because the United
Nations exists in New York the
situation is a great deal better
than it would be were there no
central place where practically all
the world can meet.

ALLIANCES AND multi-na
tional institutions are notoriously
difficult to make work, and they
produce headaches that never
end. This world is in upheaval.
But when we pause to imagine
what it would be like without the
United Nations, we realize that
we cannot do without it.

the U.N. are indispensable to this
country in meeting these respon
sibilities.
NATO is the military center of
the Atlantic Community, which
includes North and South Ameri
ca, non-Communist Europe, and
the countries associated with it
in Africa. If NATO did not exist,
it would have to be created for
the defense of the whole Atlantic
Community. Whether a particular
country, like Switzerland, for ex
ample, is formally a member of
NATO or not, its security is a
vital interest of the United States.
Therefore, we cannot tolerate
the disruption of the NATO alli
ance, and in the long run—after
all differences have been heard,
debated and negotiated—our in

against separatism. If it ever
comes to that, our influence will

be decisive.
AS FOR THE United Nations,
our commitment to preserve it is,
in fact, indissoluble. With the ad
mission of some 50 new states we
are no longer the undisputed
loaders of the United Nations. We
have done very well on the China
question but, as we have seen in
the Goa question, we cannot al
ways prevail. There are some
Americans who, like spoiled chil
dren, wish to stop playing if they
cannot always win the game. But
the grown-up view of the United
Nations is, I submit, that if the
50 new members do not agree with
us inside the U.N. in all probabili
ty they would disagree with us
even more violently outside the
U.N. Those new nations would
still exist if there were no United
Nations that they could belong to.
In spile of everything that can
be said against it, the U.N. is in
dispensable because it keeps open
the contact and communications
between the old powers and the
new nations, and among all the
continents. The speeches and res
olutions in the General Assembly
are often annoying. The actions
of the U.N., as in the Congo, are
sometimes inefficient, and on cer
tain issues such as Goa they are
far from ideal. But what really
matters is that so many nations
have representatives in one city
at the same time, and that they
have their recognized place to
meet and that they can talk with
one another frequently and casu
ally in the lounges and the corri
dors, and in private apartments
and houses. No one can ever
measui’e the amount of good that
this does. But tnere can be no
doubt that because the United
Nations exists in New York the
situation is a great deal better
than it would be were there no
central place where practically all
the world can meet.

ALLIANCES AND multi-na

difficult to make work, and they

If we did not know that Russia
and China are bumping along on
a very rocky road, it would be
harder to be calm about the West
ern troubles in the United Na
tions and in NATO. Nevertheless,
the disunity of the Western pow
ers is alarming. Why, in the face
of the great pressures from the
Communist coalition, can the
Western nations indulge in so
much stubborn separatism? The
answer must be, 1 suppose, that
the separate nations do not really
believe seriously, deep in their
inmost minds, that the threat
from the East is what they say
it is. If they really believed that
the threat is great and imminent,
they would sink their differences
and unite at once, overriding all
mere questions of pride, gran
deur, prestige, glory and paro
chial self-interest.

It can be said then, probably
with much truth, that the West
ern powers are confident that the
balance of terror will maintain
the peace. Because the fearful
threat of a thermonuclear war is
relaxed, there is much less com
pulsion to unite on other matters.
BUT EVEN IF thermonuclear
war is most improbable at the
present time, there are momen
tous issues that have to be met,
great problems that have to be
dealt with. The United States has

us inside the U.N. in all probabili
ty they would disagree with us
even more violently outside the
U.N. Those new nations would
still exist if there were no United
Nations that they could belong to.
In spile of everything that can
be said against it, the U.N. is in
dispensable because it keeps open
the contact and communications
between the old powers and the
new nations, and among all the
continents. The speeches and res
olutions in the General Assembly
are often annoying. The actions
of the U.N., as in the Congo, are
sometimes inefficient, and on cer
tain issues such as Goa they are
far from ideal. But what really
matters is that so many nations
have representatives in one city
at the same time, and that they
have their recognized place to
meet and that they can talk with
one another frequently and casu
ally in the lounges and the corri

and houses. No one can ever
measui’e the amount of good that
this does. But tnere can be no
doubt that because the United

situation is a great deal better
than it would be were there no
central place where practically all
the world can meet.

ALLIANCES AND multi-na

difficult to make work, and they
produce headaches that never

If we did not know that Russia
and China are bumping along on
a very rocky road, it would be
harder to be calm about the West
ern troubles in the United Na
tions and in NATO. Nevertheless,
the disunity of the Western pow
ers is alarming. Why, in the face
of the great pressures from the
Communist coalition, can the
Western nations indulge in so
much stubborn separatism? The
answer must be, 1 suppose, that
the separate nations do not really
believe seriously, deep in their
inmost minds, that the threat
from the East is what they say
it is. If they really believed that
the threat is great and imminent,
they would sink their differences
and unite at once, overriding all
mere questions of pride, gran
deur, prestige, glory and paro
chial self-interest.

It can be said then, probably
with much truth, that the West
ern powers are confident that the
balance of terror will maintain
the peace. Because the fearful
threat of a thermonuclear war is
relaxed, there is much less com
pulsion to unite on other matters.
BUT EVEN IF thermonuclear
war is most improbable at the
present time, there are momen
tous issues that have to be met,
great problems that have to be
dealt with. The United States has
enormous and inescapable respon
sibilities, and it is well for u$ to
remind ourselves why NATO and
the U.N. are indispensable to this
country in meeting these respon
sibilities.
NATO is the military center of
the Atlantic Community, which
includes North and South Ameri
ca, non-Communist Europe, and
the countries associated with it
in Africa. If NATO did not exist,
it would have to be created for
the defense of the whole Atlantic
Community. Whether a particular
country, like Switzerland, for ex
ample, is formally a member of
NATO or not, its security is a
vital interest of the United States.
Therefore, we cannot tolerate
the disruption of the NATO alli
ance, and in the long run—after
all differences have been heard,
debated and negotiated—our in
fluence will come down decisively
against separatism. If it ever
comes to that, our influence will

be decisive.
AS FOR THE United Nations,
our commitment to preserve it is,
in fact, indissoluble. With the ad
mission of some 50 new states we
are no longer the undisputed
loaders of the United Nations. We
have done very well on the China
question but, as we have seen in
the Goa question, we cannot al
ways prevail. There are some
Americans who, like spoiled chil
dren, wish to stop playing if they
cannot always win the game. But
the grown-up view of the United
Nations is, I submit, that if the
50 new members do not agree with
us inside the U.N. in all probabili
ty they would disagree with us
even more violently outside the
U.N. Those new nations would
