## Is There Money for Books in PACE Drive? 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is one
of a series of columns sponsored
by tiie Stanford Today and To
morrow Committee to answer
questions about Stanford. Anyone
with a question should send it to
Box 3845.)
This week’s question is an
swered by E, M. Grieder, associ
ate director of the Stanford li
braries: •
We have been asked whether
the goals of the PACE Program
include funds for books, journals
and other library needs as well
as for buildings.
The answer to this question is
yes.
Buildings are certainly the most
spectacular elements in library
planning, and they form an im
pressive part of the PACE sched
ules. Besides the $5,250,000 allo
cated to the Undergraduate Li
brary and the Main Library re
modelling, there are sizeable com
ponents in the buildings planned
for Engineering, Biological Sci
ences, Fine Arts and other fields.
But there is in addition a $6,-
000,000 item earmarked for li
brary operations. $1,500,000 for
the Hoover Institution and $4,-
000,000 for the University Li
braries. This latter sum is divided
into two categories: expendable
funds of $2,000,00 and endow
ment funds of $2,500,000. Those
would by no means support the
whole library operation; since the
University now spends around
$1,500,000 per year on its li
braries, it must continue to pour
into them large sums from gen
eral income. The PACE compon
ents would enable the libraries to
make up for the deficiencies in

curred during the past few dec
ades, particularly in the book and
journal collections and in binding.
AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS
which are especially in need of
large sums for immediate
strengthening of their research
collections are History, Classics,
Modern European Languages, Po
litical Science, Asian Languages,
Sociology and others.
Besides these, a number of geo
graphical areas of multi-depart
mental interest should be better
represented, not necessarily as
research specialties—though they
may become such—but simply to
make possible high-level research
on a broad scale in history, po
litical science, economics, anthro
pology and other fields in which
Stanford is active. Among them
are Africa south of the Sahara,
the Middle East, India and South
east Asia,
More generally, the reference
collections need strengthening;
the decaying and space-wasting
newspapers should be replaced by
microfilm; many valuable jour
nals need binding. There is a long
list of projects for strengthening
the book collections ready to be
undertaken when funds can be
found.
WHILE THE PACE Program
includes some money for equip
ment and other non-book needs,
the major investment always
excepting sorely-needed buildings
—should be for books, journals,
microfilms, recordings and other
types of library materials. The
demands of Stanford’s expanding
instructional and research com
mitments can only be met by the
expenditure of great sums to
build library resources.
