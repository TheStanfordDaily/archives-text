Editor, The Daily:
Although I am in law school at
Stanford, I have not yet lost my
desii'e to play basketball occa
sionally. Because of my work
load, this opportunity is limited
to the weekend, with its attendant
possibilities of affording some
spare time.
However, the events of the past
weekend demonstrate that recre
ational basketball at Stanford is
strictly wishful thinking. Early
Friday evening several of us were
refused admittance to Encina
gym on the grounds that ", . T
no one may play on Friday
nights, because that’s when the
varsity plays.” The varsity was
idle that night.
On Sunday we again attempted
to secure a court, but were in
formed by a rather indignant
maintenance man that “. . . we
never play basketball at Stanford
on Sunday.”
Why not? Why are the indoor
facilities on this campus closed
to students during the bettor part
of the weekend? Has it occurred
to the Athletic Department that
many students can find no other
time for recreation? Does the
Athletic Department realize that

by prohibiting basketball on Fri
day nights and Sundays it is plac
ing an almost intolerable burden
on Stanford’s limited indoor fa
cilities for the remainder of the
weekend, i.e. Saturday? Has any
one from the Athletic Department
ever tried to get a basketball
court at Encina gym on Saturday
afternoon?
True, several outdoor courts ex
ist; but of what use are they at
night, on rainy days, or, as was

the case last Sunday, when it
snows?
Ivy League universities are al
most by definition precluded be
ing basketball “factories”: yet
their athletic facilities are almost
always open to students, especial
ly on weekends. Stanford pur
ports to be the equal of these
schools in every other respect; is
it too much to expect the same
attitude here?

Ivy League universities are al
most by definition precluded be
ing basketball “factories”: yet
their athletic facilities are almost
always open to students, especial
ly on weekends. Stanford pur
ports to be the equal of these
schools in every other respect; is
it too much to expect the same
attitude here?
