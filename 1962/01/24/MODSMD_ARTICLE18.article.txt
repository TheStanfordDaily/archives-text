# Astronaut Countdown Begins
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL (UPT> -
U.S. scientists replaced two key
parts in a space capsule yester
day and resumed the “count
down” toward the launching of
astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. into
orbit around earth.
But it was still uncertain
whether the nation’s first manned
orbital flight would make its new

firing date, Saturday. Top sources
on the Mercury man-in-space pro
gram said the shot stood “a very
good chance” of slipping another
three days, to next Tuesday.
“If everything went absolutely
perfectly,” one official said, “we
could meet the Saturday date.
But let’s lie realistic- how often
has everything gone perfectly?”
