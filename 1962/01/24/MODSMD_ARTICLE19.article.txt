Basketball officiating on the West Coast has grown stagnant.
The nadir of refereeing came Monday night during the Stanford-
Washington State game.
It wasn’t that the calls went mainly against Stanford, it was the
manner in which the calls were made that disappointed me. Time
and time again, referees Joe Bussenius and Ernie Filiherti made calls
that they were in no position to make with any degree of accuracy.
One in particular stands out in my mind. Stanford center Tom
Dose drove past Cougar center Neil Dirom to the bucket and potted
an easy layin. To everyone in the Stanford rooting section it was
evident that Dose was free and scored and that was that.

It was also clear to Filberti
standing not two feet from the
basket and almost bowled over by
Dose’s drive. However, Bussenius
tooted the whistle from half-court
and called afoul on the Cougar
center. Filiberti looked helpless
and then motioned the players to
line up for the free throw'.
Another sickening display of
the of co-ordination between the
two referees occurred when Don
Clemetson fed a high lead-in pass
to John Windsor under the bas
ket. The pass riffled the net on
the basket and the Stanford play
ers and all the spectators in the
Pavilion though the ball had gone
in and Stanford had two.
Cougar guard Terry Ball half
heartedly rebounded the ball and
loked around. Everyone was mill
ing around so he took off for the
Stanford basket.
Eventually he threw the ball
out-of-bounds on a bad pass.
Stanford took possession at half-

court and asked the referees for a clarification of the decision that
the hall did not go through the hoop.
The Referees Were Silent
The trouble wasn’t that the referees disallowed what appeared
to be two Stanford points, but that they didn’t inform either team of
their decision. Had Ball gone down to make the layin in a close
game, the repercussions would have been rebounding from AAVVU
sounding-board Tom Hamilton for days.
What burns me up is that these two referees, Filiberti and Bus
senius, are considered to be two of the best referees on the West
Coast.
Actually, the Bay Area coaches have let it be known often
enough that they disapprove of many officials. Perhaps the most
bitter denunciation of officials came from Van Sweet, basketball
mentor at University of Pacific, about four years ago. when the
‘‘Big O’’ was in his pr ime at Cincinnati. U.0.P., then C.O.P. had
finished a mid-western tour and Sweet said that the sectionalism was
frightening.
He said that officiating was differ ent in the Bay Area from other
parts of the country, and things you can get away with here are
fouls elsewhere. He cited the “Big O,” who set a one-game scoring
record for Madison Square Garden against the Bengals, saying that
he got away with murder. It didn’t matter, since U.O.P. tumbled by
more than 50 points, but Sweet’s outburst characterized the dis
satisfaction.
More recently, Eddie Donovan, coach of Loyola of Los Angeles,
let it be known that some amazing things happened to Loyola this
year on their trip to Hawaii.
Now Hawaii is the home of Ed Bento, 6-6 center on the Loyola
squad, and he is regarded as some sort of a demi-god there. Donovan

reported that the officials constantly consulted Bento to see if their
work met with his approval.
What Happened in Reno?
This was well-publicized but the case of San Francisco State
taking their own referee with them when they played Nevada in
Reno did not receive so much press attention. This action was
prompted by memories of what has happened to State before in Reno.
Everyone knows that officiating is a hard job, low-paying,
usually done only by men who love the game enough to put up with
the constant abuse that a referee has to take. The most reviled
expression among referees is “homer.’’ In basketball, a ref who is a
homer favors the home team over a basketball squad visiting from
some other part of the United States.
It is actually hard to say that basketball officials are homers,
but the fact is they usually referee only for certain teams. For ex
ample, in the Bay Area, the referees only officiate for the teams in
this region.
The number of teams may be around ten. and the fact is that the
refs get familiar with the play of certain players. Where they may
call a foul on one man from a visiting team, they may be lenient on
another man from the home team because they know him and his
style of play, and subconsciously know' that he can do certain things
without committing a foul.
Certain referees, like Al Lightner, travel all around and don’t
get buddy-buddy with several teams. Thus they can call with im
partiality, or maybe the better term is equality of interpretation,
the fouls and technical decisions that are entailed in the game of
basketball.
If the referees officiate in different parts of the country, maybe
decisions on such technical points as traveling and charging will
become standardized, and not open to different interpretation in
different places.
Anyway, something is needed to cure the ills of basketball offi
