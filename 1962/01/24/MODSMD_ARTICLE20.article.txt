### 
BOSTON UPI —Fireball pitcher Bob Feller and Nogrn barrier
breaker Jackie Robinson yesterday were elected to the Hall of Fame
to smash a si\-vear stalemate on admission to the baseball shrine.

Feller was an overwhelming first
Cooperstown, N.Y. shrine, winnii
filed by veteran members of thet
Baseball Writers Association of
America.

ballot choice for a niche in the
ng a place on 150 of 160 ballots

was chosen by acclamation short
ly before his death in 1939. Not
even Joe DiMaggio, who won a
Hall of Fame place in 1955, was
chosen in the first election after
he became eligible.
In 21 seasons, Feller’s blazing
fastball and swooping curve gave
him three no-hitters, a dozen one
hitters, and such record book ac
complishments as 18 strikeouts
in a single game, 348 strikeouts
in a season, six seasons with 20
victories or better, and a single
season peak of 27 wins.
KOBINSON was the first Ne
gro to play in the major leagues
when he was brought up in 1947
and promptly became the Nation
al League’s rookie of the year.
The present restaurant chain
vice president played for the for
mer Brooklyn Dodgers for 10 sea
sons, reaching his peak in 1949
when he was league batting
champion with a .342 average.
He had a .312 lifetime average
and played on six Dodger pen
nant winners.

ROBINSON, the first Negro to
play in the major leagues and,
like Feller, eligible for selection
for the first time this year, was
named on 124 of the 160 ballots,
only four more than the mini
mum 75 per cent or 120 needed
for election.
The dual selection in the 1962
biennial election marked the first
time a so-called modern player
has been elected since American
League President Joe Cronin and
former slugger and baseball exec
utive Hank Greenberg were
chosen in 1956.

Under the rules, only players
out of baseball for at least five
years but less than 30 years and
who were active for at least ten
seasons are eligible, and they
must collect at least 75 per cent
of the total vote for election.
FELLER’S selection on all but
10 of the 160 ballots marked the
nearest thing to a unanimous
election since the late Lou Gehrig
