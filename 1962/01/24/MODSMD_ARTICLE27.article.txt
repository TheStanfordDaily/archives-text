# "Soviet Techniques are Weak" Says Prof. Gordon A. Craig
## 
### 
When Premier Khrushchev took
off his shoe and banged it on the
desk at the UN general session
in October 1960, the echoes rang
well outside those august halls.
His action may very will have
led the Afro-Asian bloc, whom it

was supposed to impress, to feel
much more critical of Soviet dip
lomatic behavior in general,
writes Gordon A. Craig in the
winter issue of Stanford Today.
Craig, in a study of the Sovi
ets’ no-holds-barred diplomatic
game, believes that Russia may
find herself compelled to adjust
her aproach toward negotiations
simply because the world audi
ence is becoming more sophisti
cated and critical of the Reds’ per
formance.
“The weakness of the Soviet
negotiating technique lies in its
repetitive quality,” Craig writes,
“and a world genuinely anxious
for peace may sooner or later rec
ognize the fact that Soviet claims
of Western obstructionism and
bad faith are really screens for
Soviet opposition to genuine ne
gotiation on the issues that divide
East and West.
“It is possible that the Soviet
Union may feel called upon to
prove its willingness to negotiate
seriously in order to avoid acquir
ing a reputation for negative di
plomacy in the eyes of the neu
tral and uncommitted powers,”
the article says.
“But it is essential that agree
ments be reached,” he empha
sizes.
