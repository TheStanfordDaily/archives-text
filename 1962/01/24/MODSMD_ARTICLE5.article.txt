# Ike Condemns Strict Censorship of Military
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) For
mer President Dwight D. Eisen
hower said yesterday that mili
tary officers are entitled to warn
of Communist threats and should
not be thrust behind “an Ameri
can Iron Curtain” of censorship.

Eisenhower offered his views
in a letter to a special Senate
armed services subcommittee
which opened its widely publi
cized hearings on charges that
the Pentagon is “muzzling” mili
tary officers.

THE SUBCOMMITTEE also
heard testimony by Adm. Ar
leigh A. Burke, retired chief of
naval operations, and received a
statement from Robert A. Lovett,
a defense secretary in the Tru
man administration.
Eisenhower, Burke and Lovett
were agreed on one point—that
military leaders should steer
clear of partisan politics. But in
his letter, Eisenhower questioned
the desirability of “requiring the
topmost government officials
whether military or civilian, to

submit their proposed public
statements for what amounts to
censorship of content—as dis
tinguished from security matters
—prior to their utterance.”

THE MILITARY is particular
ly well trained to provide both
servicemen and civilians with in
formation on Communist imperi
alism, the former President said.
Eisenhower said there may
have been excessive censorship
in both his administration and
the preceding Truman years.
"But,’ he added, “in thoughtful
reassessment of this procedure
I incline to the view that when
responsible and respected officials
feel compelled to submit to cen
sorship, we are smothering the
concept of personal responsibili
ty.”
“The Reds arc well aware of
the integrity, patriotic motives
and high qualifications of our
military. I suspect they would be
delighted if we should prevent
such people from spreading the
truth,” he continued.
Eisenhower said the subcom
mittee would render a valuable
service by rejecting recent at
tacks on the military and “by'
disapproving any effort to thrust
them, so to speak, behind an
American Iron Curtain, ordered
to stand mutely by as hostile
forces tirelessly strive to under
mine every aspect of American
life.”
Sen. Strom Thurmond. D-C.S.,
whose muzzling charges were
largely responsible for (he in
quiry being set up, said he
thought Eisenhower’s statement
was excellent and “a direct refu
tation of the Fulbright Memo
randum.”
Thurmond referred to a memo
filed last spring by r Chairman J.
William Fulbright of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, re
questing a Defense Department
review of military participation
in certain public affairs. Ful
bright charged that some of the
functions had been used to air
"right wing radicalism.”

the Pentagon is “muzzling” mili
tary officers.

THE SUBCOMMITTEE also
heard testimony by Adm. Ar
leigh A. Burke, retired chief of
naval operations, and received a
statement from Robert A. Lovett,
a defense secretary in the Tru
man administration.
Eisenhower, Burke and Lovett
were agreed on one point—that
military leaders should steer
clear of partisan politics. But in
his letter, Eisenhower questioned
the desirability of “requiring the
topmost government officials
whether military or civilian, to

submit their proposed public
statements for what amounts to
censorship of content—as dis
tinguished from security matters
—prior to their utterance.”

THE MILITARY is particular
ly well trained to provide both
servicemen and civilians with in
formation on Communist imperi
alism, the former President said.
Eisenhower said there may
have been excessive censorship
in both his administration and
the preceding Truman years.
"But,’ he added, “in thoughtful
reassessment of this procedure
I incline to the view that when
responsible and respected officials
feel compelled to submit to cen
sorship, we are smothering the
concept of personal responsibili
ty.”
“The Reds arc well aware of
the integrity, patriotic motives
and high qualifications of our
military. I suspect they would be
delighted if we should prevent
such people from spreading the
truth,” he continued.
Eisenhower said the subcom
mittee would render a valuable
service by rejecting recent at
tacks on the military and “by'
disapproving any effort to thrust
them, so to speak, behind an
American Iron Curtain, ordered
to stand mutely by as hostile
forces tirelessly strive to under
mine every aspect of American
life.”
Sen. Strom Thurmond. D-C.S.,
whose muzzling charges were
largely responsible for (he in
quiry being set up, said he
thought Eisenhower’s statement
was excellent and “a direct refu
tation of the Fulbright Memo
randum.”
Thurmond referred to a memo
filed last spring by r Chairman J.
William Fulbright of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, re
questing a Defense Department
review of military participation
in certain public affairs. Ful
bright charged that some of the
functions had been used to air
"right wing radicalism.”
