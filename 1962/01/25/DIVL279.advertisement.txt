FEBRUARY 5 FORECAST
Since it is not the University’s
function to warn its students, re
gents and employees of empending
disaster or events, we have decided
to jump into the breech and give
fair warning.
On Feb. 5, 1962 all the planets
| will be in line. This event, while
| it seems only of interest to sight
seers like a certain Mr. Glenn, will
have far reaching effects on all of
I us.
We have definite information
I that Stanford golf course will he
j torn up to make way for a new sub
! division of homes in the $9995.00
to $11,995 range featuring five hed-
I rooms and one hath. Unfortunately
there will be no walls.
Cowper., will be completely razed
to make way for off street parking.
Naturally with no street . . .
At 11:30 a.m. USSR will drop
a 190 metaton bomb on the bay
area. Our anti-megaton machines
will be rendered helpless. The en
tire area w ill be covered with tran
sistor-active dust that will make
! driving hazardous on the bayshore.
We will be open all day to render
1 the same excellent service at rea
■ sociable prices. (In case anyone
shouldventure ouT)
