# Aptitude, Aspiration, Education of Farm Undergrads

### DR. JOHN D. BLACK 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the first half
of u report written last October by the direc
tor of Stanford’s Counseling and Testing
Center on the aptitudes, aspirations and edu
cation of Stanford undergraduates. The sec
ond half of the report will appear in tomor
row’s Dally).

This paper is concerned with two trends
in Stanford’s undergraduate student body
which seem to deserve consideration and re
flection in planning both the ends and the
means of our undergraduate program. The
first of these is the increasingly high ability
level of the freshmen who enroll here. This
trend was commented upon in the report of
Ihe 1954-56 study. The Undergraduate in the
University, but the impact of the trend was
only beginning to be felt in those years. The
elimination of enrollees of more modest
ability and the increased incidence of stu
dents of exceptional aptitude continued
throughout Ihe decade of the ‘fifties and
shows no signs of leveling off.
Most of those who have been at Stanford
long know that our students are brighter
than they used to be, but the magnitude of
the change and its implications are harder to
grasp. At present over 95 per cent of the

freshmen are in the upper 15 per cent of
high school graduates across the nation in
terms of intellectual ability as measured by
the College Board verbal aptitude score. Well
over half—about 65 per cent—are in the
upper 3 per cent of high school graduates.
Since high school graduates as a group still
represent a selected segment of the total
population, it is obvious that our classrooms
are entirely filled from a very minute seg
ment of the upper reaches of the nation's
intellectual resources.
Another approach to visualizing the in
tellectual calibre of the undergraduates we
teach is to compare them with graduate
students, whom we perhaps know more inti
mately.
ALTHOUGH DATA OF THIS sort are dif
ficult to obtain, there is evidence that aver
age I.Q. of Stanford undergraduates is
probably not more than 5 points below that
of graduates in Ph.D. granting institutions,
and it is probably higher than the average
of students in most professional schools
(e.g., law, medicine, social work, theology,
education). For all practical purposes, an
instructor with a representative sample of
freshmen in his class may in most eases
assume that at least Ihe upper three-fourths
of them duplicate the distribution of intellec

tual ability of the graduate students in his
department.
One might continue this process and draw
interesting comparisons with the faculty, but
perhaps enough has been said to focus atten
tion on the fact that conscious or uncon
scious perceptions of undergraduates as they
were when we were in college, or indeed, as
they were at Stanford five years ago, could
not be more misleading. Yet it is probably
easier to perceive that students are taller
than they used to be than that they are so
much brighter.

Part of the difficulty of grasping the
transition that has occurred lies in the nature
of many of the learning tasks required at
introductory levels. A student with an I.Q.
of 150 will not memorize the periodic table
appreciably faster than one with an I.Q. of
120, other things being equal. Mastery of
spelling or grammar is relatively unrelated
to intelligence levels above a certain mini
mum. Acquisition of a new language is a
further example.

THEBE ABE MANY' TASKS of under
graduate education which are not easier for
the unusually gifted and which are probably
not performed significantly better by virtue
of added increments of intelligence.
Superior intelligence is essentially un

usual capacity for abstract reasoning: i.e.,
the manipulation of symbols and the percep
tion of relationships. It manifests itself both
in the level of insight and understanding
achieved and the speed at which learning
occurs at higher levels of abstraction. Here
the departmentalized structure of education
and its organization into discrete courses
restrict the opportunity for demonstrating
unusual intelligence. A student’s achieve
ment. for example, in relating concepts
learned in anthropology to material studied
in American social history is not routinely
measured. A gifted student may move with
great rapidity through the textbook in ad
vanced statistics, but the course runs for 12
weeks and its contents is finite; the time he
gains is not apparent; to the faculty.
These factors ameliorate the obvious im
pact of the general rise in scholastic aptitude
and we are therefore not driven to question
whether our individual teaching assignments
are carried out in a fashion to utilize and
serve the intelligence of current undergradu
ates or whether drastic improvements might
be made in the design of our undergraduate
program.

IT MAY BE WELL TO ADD that no one
is suggesting that I.Q. is the only important
variable with which a university must be

concerned in understanding its students. In
telligence is not a unitary trait but a com
bination of several aptitudes which alter per
formances in different mental tasks. Indi
viduality also arises from the variety of in
terests, values, motivations, and levels of
emotional maturity in any population of
adolescents, however bright or dull. One of
the great needs if we ai'e to improve our
educational program is to understand more
about the individual differences among the
students.

A second trend which deserves serious
attention may bo described as a change in
the educational goals and value system of
the student body. In this case wo do not have
comparable figures over the years, but the
current figures are startling enough to infer
that the selective admissions process has
wrought another significant change.
Questions were recently asked the enter
ing freshmen about the highest academic
degree each planned to seek. The answers
reveal the very high proportion of Stanford’s
current freshmen who plan to do graduate
and professional work. For the men, this
figure exceeds 85 per cent; for the women,
60 per cent; for the class as a whole, three
out of four plan to obtain at least a master’s
degree.
