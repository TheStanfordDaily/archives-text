## Scientists in Russia— Is the Stereotype True? 
### CHARLES SCHLACKS Instructor in Western Civ 
I should like to comment very
briefly on an article by Prof.
Konrad B. Krauskopf which ap
peared in the Winter 1961 issue
of Stanford Today, describing his
impressions of scientific life in
the Soviet Union.
According to Prof. Krauskopf,
Americans have a stereotyped
picture of Soviet citizens as basic
ally an unhappy lot, helplessly
subject to the controls and terror
apparatus of a totalitarian re
gime which allows no freedom
and no dissent. But this sort of
stereotype, Porf. Krauskopf in
sists, “ . . . is nurtured by the
publicity given in our press to oc
casional Russians who do flee
their country, and by the promi
nence accorded news stories that
contain any hint of dissatisfaction
among the Russian populace.”
What did Prof. Krauskopf find
when he journeyed to the Soviet
Union and talked to some of his
compatriots in the physical sci
ences? “It took no more than a
couple of days in Moscow to con
vince me that something was
wrong. The Russian geologists
simply were not acting like deni
zens of a slave state. On the con
trary, they seemed relaxed, confi
dent, happy in their work—very
much like Americans, in fact. The
resemblance to Americans im
pressed itself upon me increas
ingly during my stay. The Rus
sians I met had the same way of
looking at things, the same sense
of humor, the same easy infor
mality and hospitality that I was
accustomed to at home.”
TO THIS VERSION of life
within the Soviet system I should
like to contrast the one described
in an article appearing in This
Week Magazine for Jan. 21, 1962,
by Dr. Mikhail A. Klochko, a for
mer Soviet scientist in the field
of physical chemistry. Unfortun
ately, Dr. Klochko, who defected
to Canada quite recently, must
have missed the resemblance be
tween the Soviet and the Ameri
can way of life that so impressed
Prof. Krauskopf during his so
journ in the Soviet Union. In
stead, he subjected himself to nu
merous dangers in order to get
out of the Soviet Union and live
in the West.
What does Dr. Klochko have to
say about, life and work in his
former homeland? “Since my de
fection I have found that many in
the West think most Russians be
lieve ardently in their way of
life and support it strongly, that
they put up with today’s hard
ships because they believe that
they are forging ahead and that
tomorrow they will catch up with
North America and Western Eu
rope.”

Such a viewpoint, according to
Dr. Klochko, is a distortion of the
truth. As a rejoinder, he tells an
anecdote currently popular in the
Soviet Union; “A man explains
to a friend that Russian scholars
have discovered that Adam and
Eve were Soviet citizens. ‘lt was
just a matter of deduction,’ he
says. ‘They had no clothes to
wear. They had only one apple
hetween them. And yet they kept
insisting that they were in Para
dise.’ . . . Such stories indicate
a skepticism of the Soviet system
that is deep-rooted. Disillusion
ment is almost universal.”

HERE ARE SOME FACTS pro
vided by Dr. Klochko to support
his contention about the happi
ness and loyalty of the Russian
people under the present Soviet
regime being a myth. The KGB
(the successor to Stalin’s MVD)
no longer uses terror and mass
arrests to intimidate the Russian
people. But the spy apparatus
still exists and is widely used.
Conscious of their helplessness
under the always suspicious eyes
of the government, the people
turn to any means of escape. At
the present time, the most widely
used means is that of alcohol. Be
sides providing the largest single
source of income to the Soviet
state (as it did to the Tsarist re
gime some 50 years earlier), liq
uor has resulted in a serious prob

lem of mass alcoholism.
In addition, juvenile crime and
non-political crimes are wide
spread since the local militia, hav
ing no concern with political
crimes which are regarded more
seriously by the Soviets, are un
derpaid and therefore easily sub
ject to bribery. Add to this situa
tion unbearably crowded living
conditions and legal discrimina
tion in favor of the Soviet bureau
cratic elite, and now what
emerges? Certainly not the de
scriptions of Russians as “relax
ed, confident, happy in their
work.”
But in all fairness to Prof.
Krauskopf, I must point out that
he docs not say that everyone is
pleased and satisfied under the
Soviet regime. Instead he declares
that “ an intelligent and in
fluential segment of the Russian
population is sincere in its loyalty
to communism. ...” Presuming
these to be the scientists and in
tellectuals with whom he came in
to contact, and not Party mem
bers per se, can we conclude that
a significant portion of the
“thinking people” really do sup
port the Soviet system?
AS A FORMER MEMBER of
that portion of society, Dr. Kloch
ko has this to say: “Intellectuals
[in the Soviet Union], especially,
suffer from a sense of frustra
tion. There is a mock ‘Creed for
Intellectuals’ that is current in
Russian. It goes: ‘Don’t think. If
you think, don’t speak. If you
speak, don’t write. If you write,
don’t publish. If you publish, de
nounce what you have written
and confess your errors’ . . . Ed
ucated people feel more strongly
the lack of free access to knowl
edge than they do the lack of ma
terial things.”
But Dr. Klochko and his story
may be part of the stereotyped
picture of the Soviet system
foisted upon the West that Prof.
Krauskopf speaks about. There
fore I suggest we turn to a dif
ferent perspective of the same
basic point. What of the millions
of Russian and East German
skilled technicians and teachers
who have fled the Communist re
gime? Are they stereotypes too?
On the contrary, they all express
to some extent the reason given
by Dr. Klochko for his defection;
“Everyone has his own concept
of heaven, and mine has always
been of a place where there was
an unlimited supply of books and
some friends with whom it was
possible to discuss ideas freely.
Now, at last, I think I have found
it.”
