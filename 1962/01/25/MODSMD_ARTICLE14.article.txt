MORALITY ABSURD?
Editor, The Daily:
“ ‘Sex, on and off Campus;’ a
Scientific Investigation into Hu
man Behavior.” Had anyone writ
ten an essay on Psychologist
Black’s lecture Tuesday, he would
not have titled it this. But, cer
tainly, this is what psychology is:
a form of scientific investigation.
I feel that Dr. Black very unsci
entifically neglected some impor
tant facts in putting his seal of
approval on certain actions. I sup
port this by citing several things
that are important issues in Illi
nois. Had Dr. Black ever had an
opportunity to observe this year’s
budget for Illinois, he would have
noticed a monstrous item called
ADC: Aid to Dependent Children.
Why are many children depend
ent on the State, and why has the
ADC budget risen 90 per cent in
the last three years? Had he ever
read the Chicago Daily News’ ar
ticles on abortion last year, he
would have noticed that some
abortionists net upwards of $lOO,-
000 a year in income. Who pays
them, and why?
Morality had no place in Dr.
Black’s lecture; the implication
was that morality is merely an
absurd product of medieval asce
ticism. Is it? Does a moral stan
dard serve no purpose?
