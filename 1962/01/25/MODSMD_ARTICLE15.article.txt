DR. SCHWARZ
Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of the 11 students
who participated in the 1:15 semi
nar in Burbank Lounge, I thank
Mr. Theodore Rozak for his fine
leadership. An inquiry into the
basic character of the Christian
Anti-Communism Crusade was
the primary topic of discussion.
However a paucity of factual in
formation hampered us. Only five
people said they had attended Dr.
Schwarz’s address. Only four had
heard him speak before or had
read any of his material. This gap
was partially filled by the Stan
ford Daily’s excellent report of
Dr. Schwarz’s speech.
Unfortunately, on the campus
there are elements—a “group of
interested students” as the girl
handing out the petitions Tues
day called them—which appar
ently are not guided by a sense of
integrity in their political activi
ties. This group was presumably
responsible for “preparing” the
audience Monday by handing out
two pages of violently anti-
Schwarz propaganda as students
and faculty entered Memorial Au
ditorium. Not only was this hand
out extremely rude to the guest
speaker, but it also created in
part the atmosphere of hostility
which greeted him. This handout
and the petition are irresponsible
collections of innuendo, quota
tions out of context, and guilt
by association. One’s own hands
should be clean before he charges
another with erroneous methods
and motivations.
More significant is the fact that
of those who freely gathered in
Burbank Lounge at 1:15, not one
was outspokenly and violently
critical of Dr. Schwarz. This abil
ity to discuss Dr. Schwarz’s pro
gram fairly and tolerantly is
more representative of the Stan
ford atmosphere than the ap
proach represented by that
“group of interested students.”

Although no definite trend in
student opinion has yet emerged

concerning whether or not Stan
ford should emulate Harvard,
there can be no question, follow
ing our recent snow, as to how
God feels.

Editor, The Daily:
The recent Goa incident merely

serves to underscore a continuing
buildup of Indian military power.
The Royal Air Force Flying Re
view, definitive journal of world
military aviation, reported in a
recent issue that Dr. Kurt Tank,
foremost aircraft designer of Nazi
Germany and person responsible
for the Focke-Wulf F\v 190, now
works for the Indian government.
His latest effort, which has al

ready made its maiden flight, is
a supersonic ,jet interceptor of
advanced design.

On behalf of the 11 students
who participated in the 1:15 semi
nar in Burbank Lounge, I thank
Mr. Theodore Rozak for his fine
leadership. An inquiry into the
basic character of the Christian
Anti-Communism Crusade was
the primary topic of discussion.
However a paucity of factual in
formation hampered us. Only five
people said they had attended Dr.
Schwarz’s address. Only four had
heard him speak before or had
read any of his material. This gap
was partially filled by the Stan
ford Daily’s excellent report of
Dr. Schwarz’s speech.
Unfortunately, on the campus
there are elements—a “group of
interested students” as the girl
handing out the petitions Tues
day called them—which appar
ently are not guided by a sense of
integrity in their political activi
ties. This group was presumably
responsible for “preparing” the
audience Monday by handing out
two pages of violently anti-
Schwarz propaganda as students
and faculty entered Memorial Au
ditorium. Not only was this hand
out extremely rude to the guest
speaker, but it also created in
part the atmosphere of hostility
which greeted him. This handout
and the petition are irresponsible
collections of innuendo, quota
tions out of context, and guilt
by association. One’s own hands
should be clean before he charges
another with erroneous methods
and motivations.
More significant is the fact that
of those who freely gathered in
Burbank Lounge at 1:15, not one
was outspokenly and violently
critical of Dr. Schwarz. This abil
ity to discuss Dr. Schwarz’s pro
gram fairly and tolerantly is
more representative of the Stan
ford atmosphere than the ap
proach represented by that
“group of interested students.”
