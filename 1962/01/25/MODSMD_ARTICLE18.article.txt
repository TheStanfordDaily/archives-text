"clambake at Pebble Beach—his
first miss after 49 consecutive

“IT PROBABLY IS a Rood
thing that it happened,” said
Player. “I was straining too hard
and playing conservative golf to
keep the streak going. It was one
of my ambitions to break Dow
Finsterwald’s record of 72
straight tournaments in the
money.”
The weather man says it will
be cool anti crisp but sunny.
And the winds will be less than
