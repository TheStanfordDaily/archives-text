• SAN FRANCISCO (UPI i
Democratic Gov. Edmund G.
Brown announced Wednesday
night that he is a candidate for
another term and immediately as
sailed former vice president
Richard M. Nixon, whom he said
seeks the governorship only as a
step toward the White House.
The 56-year-old governor made
his long-expected announcement
that he will seek four more years
in office in a speech to 1,500 Dem
ocrats at a $lOO a plate dinner in
the Fairmont Hotel.
He linked his administration to
President Kennedy’s “new fron
tier” and said that California
under the Democrats already has
written into law ‘‘many of the
progressive goals our President
has set for all nations.”
AMONG TELEGRAMS received
by Brown was one from Kennedy
that congratulated him on a
"proud record” and said "I am
confident that, if we carry the
full impact of this record to the
people you will give an important
victory to your state and our
party.”
As for Nixon, one of three Re
publicans who have announced
they will seek the GOP guberna
torial nomination in the June 3th
primary, Brown said:

“His decision to run for gover
nor has nothing to do with Cal- j
ifornia or its future. To him,
Sacramento is nothing more than
a whistle-stop on the line to j
Washington.
“I TELL YOU that the people I
of California will not permit him ]
to convert the governor’s office'
into Nixon-for-president national |
headquarters.’’
When he announced for gover-1
nor last September, Nixon insist
ed he had no presidential ambi-1
tions in 1964. Since that time, he
has told national GOP leaders to!
rule him out as a presidential
candidate and has pledged he I
would serve a full four-year term
as governor if elected.
Two other Republicans con- [
servativc state Assemblyman Jo- j
seph C. Shell and former lieu- !
tenant governor Harold J. Powers !
-—also are in the race for gover
nor. Brown in his speech made
no mention of them and obviously
feels that his opponent in the
Nov. 6th runoff will be the for
mer vice president.
BROWN INSISTED that Nixon I
“has no time for California, He j
said Nixon spent a few moments;
criticizing California law enforce-1
ment or its educational system |
but spent days downgrading U.S.
policy in Berlin or Katanga.
“I am a candidate because I
believe the governorship of Cali- i
fornia is too important to entrust j
to a man who wants it only to
further his presidential ambi
tions,” Brown said.
“I am a candidate because 11
believe California should bo a j
working partner of the national j
administration not the strong-!
hold of a man and a party who
stand in opposition to our presi-1
dent and his policies.
The Governor conceded that i
Nixon will be a tough opponent, j
“We’re in for a rough year,” he j
warned his fellow Democrats.
