ANALYZING FRED SCHWARZ IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RIGHTISTS, Political Science Professor Charles
Drekmeier (far left) yesterday evening hosted the last of a group of seminars dealing with the
Schwarz movement. Drekmeier related the Schwarz campus address to that of H. R. A. Hart ("Law,
Liberty, and Morality") last week, by citing the "Christian Anti-Communism Crusade" as an attempt
to link law and popular moral decisions in a manner cited by Hart as dangerous. The Schwarz
movement was noted in the frame of a tradition of evangelist populist movements having a tendency
to treat complex problems with the religious simplicity of clear "black and white, right and wrong."
The political scientist noted that the Schwarz movement—and its backers, more importantly—is not
so much concerned with anti-communism as with blocking welfare legislation, income tax, and the
United Nations. "We are being prepared by them for exit from the U.N." "The Communist menace
becomes a key that unlocks doors to a simple explanation of history—just as Marx was," noted the
professor. The results of the simplest, crusading approach to politics is division at the grass roots
base with appeals to the groups Birch misses.
