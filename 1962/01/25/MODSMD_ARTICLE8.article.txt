The HR is now forming a Mid
dle East Committee for the pur
pose of provoking an awareness
on the part of the Stanford fam
ily of the nature and problems of
the Middle East.

As ultimate goals, the commit
tee hopes to establish relation
ships, which will result in closer
mutual understanding and per
haps in a student exchange pro
gram, with the peoples of these
lands. The committee also hopes
to provide the U.S. Foreign Serv
ice and other organizations with
Stanford people capable of wor k
ing in the Middle East.
“Because general knowledge
about the lands and politics of
the Middle East is significantly
deficient both here at Stanford
and throughout the entire United
States,’’ a committee member
said, “a committee of this type is
urgently needed."
“It is the purpose of this com
mittee not only to gather, corre
late and distribute information
about the Middle East, but also
to promote better' understanding
of such problems nation
alism, colonialism in North Af
rica, and Arab-Israeli conflict,
and neutralism,” he continued.
