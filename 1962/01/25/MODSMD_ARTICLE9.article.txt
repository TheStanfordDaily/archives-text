# New Heads Named For Top Lab Posts
## 
### 
New directors have been named for the two principal divisions
of Stanford’s Hansen Laboratories of Physics, it was announced
today. Prof. Marvin Chodorow heads lire Microwave Laboratory,
where Stanford’s famed linear electron accelerators were developed.
Prof. Carlisle Barber heads the High Energy Physics Laboratory,

where the biggest accelerator is*
located—the one-Bev (billion-elec
tron-volt) Mark 111. A 20-Bev ac
celerator two mile long is soon to
be built under a contract with the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.
The new directors replace Profs.
Edward L. Ginzton and Wolfgang
K. H. Panofsky, respectively, who
have assumed new duties. Dr.
Ginzton is board chairman of an
electronics firm, Varian Associ
ates, in addition to teaching phys
ics. Dr. Panofsky, also a physics
professor, heads the two-mile ac
celerator project.
Drs. Chodorow and Barber
have served as acting directors of
their respective laboratories for
some time. Both joined the Stan
ford physics faculty soon after
World War II and have been as
sociated with the laboratories
from the start.
DR. CHODROW, 48, is a gradu
ate of the University of Buffalo
and earned his doctoral degree at
MIT. After teaching at Penn
State and CCNY, he served as a
senior staff member at Sperry
Gyroscope Co. before coming to
Stanford in 1947. He is a profes
sor of applied physics and elec
trical engineering.
Colleagues rank Dr. Chodorow
among a few top men in micro
wave electronics—a field concern
ed with the dynamics of electrons
and radio waves at very high fre
quencies. He is one of the princi
pal developers of the super power
klystron tubes used in the Stan
ford accelerators.
A member of Phi Beta Kappa
and Sigma Xi, Dr. Chodorow is a
fellow of the American Physical
Society and the Institute of Radio
Engineers. He was x’ecently a co
winner of the Institute’s W. R. G.
Baker Award, and is chairman of
Commission Seven (electronics)
of URSl—the U.S. division of the
International Radio Scientific
Union. He lives at Ladera with
his wife and two children.
DR. BARBER, 42. graduated
from Utah State Agricultural Col
lege and received his doctoral de
gree at UC-Berkeley. He was a
Radjation Laboratory physicist
at Berkeley before he came to
Stanford in 1948.
An experimental nuclear physi
cist, he is widely recognized for
his important contributions in
photonuclear physics research.
He is currently co-director of a
Stanford-Princeton experiment to
bring two 500-Hev (million-elec
tron-volt) electron beams to
gether in a collision of energy
equivalent to 1000 Bev.
Dr. Barber is a fellow of the
American Physical Society and a
member of Sigma Xi. He lives
with his wife and four children in
Los Altos Hills.

tron-volt) Mark 111. A 20-Bev ac
celerator two mile long is soon to
be built under a contract with the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.
The new directors replace Profs.
Edward L. Ginzton and Wolfgang
K. H. Panofsky, respectively, who
have assumed new duties. Dr.
Ginzton is board chairman of an
electronics firm, Varian Associ
ates, in addition to teaching phys
ics. Dr. Panofsky, also a physics
professor, heads the two-mile ac
celerator project.
Drs. Chodorow and Barber
have served as acting directors of
their respective laboratories for
some time. Both joined the Stan
ford physics faculty soon after
World War II and have been as
sociated with the laboratories
from the start.
DR. CHODROW, 48, is a gradu
ate of the University of Buffalo
and earned his doctoral degree at
MIT. After teaching at Penn
State and CCNY, he served as a
senior staff member at Sperry
Gyroscope Co. before coming to
Stanford in 1947. He is a profes
sor of applied physics and elec
trical engineering.
Colleagues rank Dr. Chodorow
among a few top men in micro
wave electronics—a field concern
ed with the dynamics of electrons
and radio waves at very high fre
quencies. He is one of the princi
pal developers of the super power
klystron tubes used in the Stan
ford accelerators.
A member of Phi Beta Kappa
and Sigma Xi, Dr. Chodorow is a
fellow of the American Physical
Society and the Institute of Radio
Engineers. He was x’ecently a co
winner of the Institute’s W. R. G.
Baker Award, and is chairman of
Commission Seven (electronics)
of URSl—the U.S. division of the
International Radio Scientific
Union. He lives at Ladera with
his wife and two children.
DR. BARBER, 42. graduated
from Utah State Agricultural Col
lege and received his doctoral de
gree at UC-Berkeley. He was a
Radjation Laboratory physicist
at Berkeley before he came to
Stanford in 1948.
An experimental nuclear physi
cist, he is widely recognized for
his important contributions in
photonuclear physics research.
He is currently co-director of a
Stanford-Princeton experiment to
bring two 500-Hev (million-elec
tron-volt) electron beams to
gether in a collision of energy
equivalent to 1000 Bev.
Dr. Barber is a fellow of the
American Physical Society and a
member of Sigma Xi. He lives
with his wife and four children in
Los Altos Hills.
