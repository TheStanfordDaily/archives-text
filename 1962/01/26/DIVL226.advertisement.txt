SALUTE: STEVE BANKS
Because of Steve Banks, who just two years ago was an
undergraduate engineering student, the Bell Telephone
System is closer to wiping out the noise (or “static”) that
sometimes interferes with telephone conversations.
On one of his first assignments, Steve examined the
noise levels that had “leaked” into telephone circuits in
Colorado. His findings shed new light on the source of
noise, and on the important methods of measuring it.
Steve Banks of Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph
Company, and tlie other young engineers like him in Bell
Telephone Companies throughout the country, help make
your communications service the finest in the world.
