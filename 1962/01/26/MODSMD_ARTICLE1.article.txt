# Aptitude, Aspiration, Education of Farm Undergrads

(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the conclud
ing section of a report w'ritten last October
by the head of Stanford’s Counseling and
Testing Center. The first part of the report
ran in yesterday’s Daily.)

Attention has been directed to the extra
ordinary increases in the ability level of our
undergraduates and the high incidence of
those planning graduate and professional
work. Like most such developments, these
present both problems and opportunities to
those of us concerned with undergraduate
education at Stanford. One of the problems
which has already received some considera
tion by the faculty and administration con
cerns the distribution of grades, particularly
among freshmen, and its relationship to
motivational factors.
It is generally believed by students that
they should maintain at least a B average
if they want to enter graduate and profes
sional schools, and this belief is probably
correct with respect to most graduate
schools. Unfortunately, loss than one male
freshman in five will earn a B average his
first year at Stanford. Less than 5 out of 100
will obtain a Bl- (3.5), and the odds are that
not a single one will finish the year with a

straight A. Looking at the lower end of the
grade distribution, nearly one-fourth of
freshman men will not make a C average,
and more will fall below a C- (1.5) than
will earn a B+ (6 per cent vs. 4 per cent).
THE FIGURES GIVEN are based on the
freshman men of 1960, but these percentages
are extremely stable over the past five years.
The stability of the grade distribution despite
the substantial improvement in ability levels,
achievement in high school, and probably
also in motivation for academic achievement
clearly suggests that freshmen are graded
relative to each other, a fact which is not
entirely clear to them nor, I suspect, to the
faculty.
The lack of opportunity during the fresh
man year to make grades which would be
recommending to graduate schools seems
likely to alter the self-concept of some stu
dents that they are graduate school material
and to result in the scaling down of their
aspirations. Yet we know from their ability
and prior achievement that most of them do
have the necessary potentiality for the goals
they have chosen. While it is apparently true
that grade distributions for subsequent
years are more lenient, it is during the first
year that a student’s self-evaluation is most
subject to change.

The freshman grade distribution un
doubtedly contributes heavily to the anxiety
level of the class, a matter which has been
of concern in recent years. Because of their
aspirations they derive no reassurance from
the promise that almost none of them will
flunk out; indeed, it is doubtful if the possi
bility that they might do so even occurs to
most of them. But with the appearance of
‘‘cinch notices,” it does become obvious that
they may not even come close to the B+ or
B- average • that they anticipated. While a
little anxiety improves performance, an ex
cess impairs it, particularly in functions
which require concentration.
THE GEOWING CONCERN ABOUT
their grades also defeats many of the goals
which we have for general educational de
velopment. It replaces an emphasis on real
learning with a focus on a superficial index
of performance, a characteristic of secondary
education which most universities would like
to reverse. It prevents students from becom
ing deeply immersed in an area of special
fascination: to do so is to risk a low grade in
some other subject and with the existing
grade distribution, that could be disastrous.
Needless to say, it cuts down attendance at
social and cultural events of all sorts.
A more subtle but serious danger is for

students to defend against discouragement
with cynicism and hostility, which may then
characterize the remaining three years of
undergraduate work for some of them. Such
an attitude feeds the so-called “anti-intellec
tualism” of which many faculty members
complain. Yet it is a natural response to
defeat to direct one’s effort and attention
elsewhere in order to elicit the reinforce
ment and rewards that all human beings
require, The foregoing data arc not com
plete. While I would doubtless defend the in
terpretations offered, others might draw
different conclusions. The data are interest
ing and suggestive and have provoked some
stimulating discussion of possible innova
tions in our educational program at Stan
ford. Here are a few such ideas—both mun
dane and fanciful:
1. ADOPT A GRADE distribution with B
as the mode and approximately equal pro
portions of A and C, reserving D and F for
conspicuous dereliction in performance. Such
systems have characterized most grading
in seminars, graduate and professional
schools for many years; current undergradu
ate selection is no less rigorous than past
admission to most such programs. There is
no sound reason to fear our students will
work less conscientiously under a more

liberal distribution and for the many who
respond to positive reinforcement, motiva
tion should improve.
2. PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITY for
honors work and independent study. Stan
ford’s long-range plans include such pro
visions, but immediate progress could be
made in this direction. For example, the of
fering of a seminar program at the fresh
man or sophomore level modeled after the
present senior colloquia deserves considera
tion. Obviously, the nature of these two pro
grams would differ, but early exposure to a
more personalized form of teaching and an
opportunity to perceive the relatodness of
knowledge could do much to stimulate ap
preciation of a general education. It is often
assumed that these developments require
enormous additions to the faculty, but grad
uate students aided by faculty consultants
could carry much of this load.
3. AWARDS FOR CREATIVE projects
and performances irrespective of a student’s
overall G.P.A. have merit. It is reported that
50 per cent of Harvard’s recent graduating
classes receive some sort of honors at grad
uation; the calibre of its student body does
not significantly exceed ours and it seems
doubtful that students there do that much
better work.
