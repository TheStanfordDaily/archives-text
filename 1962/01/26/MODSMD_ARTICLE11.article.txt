Dr. John Black’s report on the aspiration, education and apti
tude of Stanford undergraduates—which is concluded in today’s
Daily—bears much food for thought on the part of the faculty,
administration and students. It is important that a major univer
sity, or any educational institution, knows as much as possible
about the type of students it has, their ability, the pressure brought
on them and their desires in obtaining an education. Thus careful,
constructive, fact-backed reports such as Dr. Black’s deserve
attention.
The ideas he presents in today’s paper are particularly inter
esting and wo hope the University’s Committee on Undergraduate
Education will look into them and pick up those which might
make for a better undergraduate program.
One item which draws our interest is the suggestion that
Stanford “Adopt a grade distribution with B as the mode and ap
proximately equal proportion of A and C, reserving D and F for
conspicuous dereliction in performance.” We would agree with
this recommendation and think the reasons Dr. Black gives for
this suggestion are well-founded.
It appears to us that the recent decision to change the wording
of what a C or D means is a step forward—although a somewhat
minor and humorous one. The problem of an overemphasis on
grades at Stanford still exists, and as the increasing tension among
students (particularly freshmen) over grades indicates, something
should be done. A change in wording will not accomplish this. A
grading system such as Dr. Black mentions would be one solution.
Another method is the one instituted at Cal Tech recently,
which counts pluses and minuses in grade points; thus a C+
receives 2.3 grade points rather than 2.0. Obviously, there arc
other grading methods which could relieve pressure on students
yet not cheapen the value of grades.
The fault for the overemphasis lies with all concerned. Too
many students—wrongly—are convinced that a 3.5 is needed to get
into graduate school, and that grades are the important thing in
academic life. Parents put entirely too much pressure on their
children to come up with “good” grades—seldom realizing the
quality of competition at Stanford or the fact that the curve on
occasion makes it impossible for a student to draw an A or B, The
fact, as indicated in Dr. Black’s report, that the freshmen will not
receive the grades they grew accustomed to in high school also
must be pounded into both the frosh and their parents. If this were
realized by all concerned, considerable grief would be avoided.
The faculty also must realize that they are dealing with human
beings when they hand out grades, and that subjective grading
is not a violation of some strict code which must be followed. The
idea which some faculty have that a certain percentage of students
should get D or F to conform to a curve is ridiculous and heart
less, No one has yet been able to explain to us why 15 per cent of
a freshman biology or chemistry or Civ class should automatically
receive a D or F.
The rest of Dr. Black’s points deserve consideration, also. It
only seems logical that the University should use what it knows
about its students to plan better programs and—if necessary
revise its thinking about certain aspects of academic life.
