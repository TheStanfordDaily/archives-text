# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Purple Noon' Absorbing 
### ALAN ROSENTHAL 
What do you reckon would be
your first reaction after commit
ting a murder? The answer of
one of the characters in “Purple
Noon,” at The Fine Arts, is to
grab a bite. After knifing his
friend Philip Greenleaf aboard
his yacht Tom Ripley feverishly
devours an orange. There is more
time for culinary detachment
after the second murder when
Tom proceeds to eat a roast
chicken with great sang froid
with a body stretched out cold on
the living room floor.
We first meet Tom and Philip
in Romo and after some scenes
vaguely reminiscent of “La Dolce
Vita” we realize that they are no
goodniks. Our impression is
strengthened because a passing
tourist calls Tom a “bum,” and
both boys wear their shirts open
to the waist which no self-respect
ing young San Franciscan on holi
day would do.
Oh, but didn’t I tell you, Philip
is a nice American boy, in spite
of his lack of haircut, who is ter
ribly rich and has fallen in love
with Marge, a sexy balletomane
who digs Fra Angelico.
TOM HAS BEEN hired by the
senior Mr. Greenleaf to bring
Philip back to America, and away
from the idleness of Italy. At
first Tom thinks that this is going
to be easy money but gradually
realizes he is merely the butt for
Philip’s sadistic pleasure, and
that the latter has no intention of
returning.
Spurred on by a passion for
Margo, and a love of Philip’s bank
balance and possessions, Tom
knifes Philip in the midst of a
card game on board the yacht.
As a result of a quarrel Marge
has deserted Philip, and thus
takes the quarrel as a reasonable
explanation of his disappearance.
Tom then proceds to lead a double
life, as himself with Marge in Ta
ormina, and as Philip in Rome
where he assimilates his entire
identity. Necessity demands a sec
ond murder which can be blamed
on Philip who is then convenient
ly disposed of by a suicide note.
This leaves the field clear for
friendly and helpful Tom to take
up a free and carefree life with
Marge, and enjoy as he calls it

“the best life.”
THE MORALS OF OUR society
unfortunately demand retribu
tion. It comes as the result of a
gruesome error in Tom’s careful
calculations which gives a second
of horror to equal “The Fiends.”
A story of this type dealing
with obsession and murder de
mands to be treated either as a
psychological study or as an ex
ercise in sustained suspense. In
stead director Rene Clement
gives us a mild paced Mediter
ranean travelogue, pleasant
enough I grant you, in which a
complex story is smothered in ir
relevant details. Characters ap
pear and disappear in a void in
cluding a highly improbable wom
an detective who looks like Ger
trude Stein’s grandmother.
Alain Delon as Tom looks even
more beautiful than when he
played Rocco but is given no real
chance to act. Marie Leforet as
Marge is stunningly sexual, but
what is more becomes very alive
as a person in spite of a limited
script.
THE FAULT OF the film,
which is probably better than the
average Palo Alto burnt offering,
lies in a lack of dramatic rhythm
and a continued disparity be
tween very good and appalling
scenes. Isolated segments such
as Tom’s trying on of Philip’s
clothes, or the second murder
which sees Tom clumsily lugging
a corpse down the stairs are
sharp and exact. Again Tom sees
blown up dead fish in the market
and the effect is excellent only to
be immediately spoilt by some
crude symbology.
Decae’s color photography is
clean, cool and beautiful whether
he is photographing Rome, Ta
ormina, a storm or the beautiful
eyes of Marge. But it is also often
irrelevant, which is rather the
fault of the director.
“Purple Noon” is extravagant,
competent, smooth and well act
ed. If not "gripping,” it is at least
absorbing. It’s Hitchcock materi
al without the master’s touch.
And at least it has an obvious
moral; only a mug takes an extra
guy along with him when he can
get his girl friend alone on a
yacht. As the historical saying
goes “two’s company . . . three’s
a crowd.” N’est ce pas?

knifes Philip in the midst of a
card game on board the yacht.
As a result of a quarrel Marge
has deserted Philip, and thus
takes the quarrel as a reasonable
explanation of his disappearance.
Tom then proceds to lead a double
life, as himself with Marge in Ta
ormina, and as Philip in Rome
where he assimilates his entire
identity. Necessity demands a sec
ond murder which can be blamed
on Philip who is then convenient
ly disposed of by a suicide note.
This leaves the field clear for
friendly and helpful Tom to take
up a free and carefree life with
Marge, and enjoy as he calls it

“the best life.”
THE MORALS OF OUR society
unfortunately demand retribu
tion. It comes as the result of a
gruesome error in Tom’s careful
calculations which gives a second
of horror to equal “The Fiends.”
A story of this type dealing
with obsession and murder de
mands to be treated either as a
psychological study or as an ex
ercise in sustained suspense. In
stead director Rene Clement
gives us a mild paced Mediter
ranean travelogue, pleasant
enough I grant you, in which a
complex story is smothered in ir
relevant details. Characters ap
pear and disappear in a void in
cluding a highly improbable wom
an detective who looks like Ger
trude Stein’s grandmother.
Alain Delon as Tom looks even
more beautiful than when he
played Rocco but is given no real
chance to act. Marie Leforet as
Marge is stunningly sexual, but
what is more becomes very alive
as a person in spite of a limited
script.
THE FAULT OF the film,
which is probably better than the
average Palo Alto burnt offering,
lies in a lack of dramatic rhythm
and a continued disparity be
tween very good and appalling
scenes. Isolated segments such
as Tom’s trying on of Philip’s
clothes, or the second murder
which sees Tom clumsily lugging
a corpse down the stairs are
sharp and exact. Again Tom sees
blown up dead fish in the market
and the effect is excellent only to
be immediately spoilt by some
crude symbology.
Decae’s color photography is
clean, cool and beautiful whether
he is photographing Rome, Ta
ormina, a storm or the beautiful
eyes of Marge. But it is also often
irrelevant, which is rather the
fault of the director.
“Purple Noon” is extravagant,
competent, smooth and well act
ed. If not "gripping,” it is at least
absorbing. It’s Hitchcock materi
al without the master’s touch.
And at least it has an obvious
moral; only a mug takes an extra
guy along with him when he can
get his girl friend alone on a
yacht. As the historical saying
goes “two’s company . . . three’s
a crowd.” N’est ce pas?
What do you reckon would be
your first reaction after commit
ting a murder? The answer of
one of the characters in “Purple
Noon,” at The Fine Arts, is to
grab a bite. After knifing his
friend Philip Greenleaf aboard
his yacht Tom Ripley feverishly
devours an orange. There is more
time for culinary detachment
after the second murder when
Tom proceeds to eat a roast
chicken with great sang froid
with a body stretched out cold on
the living room floor.
We first meet Tom and Philip
in Romo and after some scenes
vaguely reminiscent of “La Dolce
Vita” we realize that they are no
goodniks. Our impression is
strengthened because a passing
tourist calls Tom a “bum,” and
both boys wear their shirts open
to the waist which no self-respect
ing young San Franciscan on holi
day would do.
Oh, but didn’t I tell you, Philip
is a nice American boy, in spite
of his lack of haircut, who is ter
ribly rich and has fallen in love
with Marge, a sexy balletomane
who digs Fra Angelico.
TOM HAS BEEN hired by the
senior Mr. Greenleaf to bring
Philip back to America, and away
from the idleness of Italy. At
first Tom thinks that this is going
to be easy money but gradually
realizes he is merely the butt for
Philip’s sadistic pleasure, and
that the latter has no intention of
returning.
Spurred on by a passion for
Margo, and a love of Philip’s bank

knifes Philip in the midst of a

as a person in spite of a limited
script.
THE FAULT OF the film,
which is probably better than the
average Palo Alto burnt offering,
lies in a lack of dramatic rhythm
and a continued disparity be
tween very good and appalling
scenes. Isolated segments such
as Tom’s trying on of Philip’s
clothes, or the second murder
which sees Tom clumsily lugging
a corpse down the stairs are
sharp and exact. Again Tom sees
blown up dead fish in the market
and the effect is excellent only to
be immediately spoilt by some
crude symbology.
Decae’s color photography is
clean, cool and beautiful whether
he is photographing Rome, Ta
ormina, a storm or the beautiful
eyes of Marge. But it is also often
irrelevant, which is rather the
fault of the director.
“Purple Noon” is extravagant,
competent, smooth and well act
ed. If not "gripping,” it is at least
absorbing. It’s Hitchcock materi
al without the master’s touch.
And at least it has an obvious
moral; only a mug takes an extra
guy along with him when he can
get his girl friend alone on a
yacht. As the historical saying
goes “two’s company . . . three’s
a crowd.” N’est ce pas?
What do you reckon would be
your first reaction after commit
ting a murder? The answer of
one of the characters in “Purple
Noon,” at The Fine Arts, is to
grab a bite. After knifing his
friend Philip Greenleaf aboard
his yacht Tom Ripley feverishly
devours an orange. There is more
time for culinary detachment
after the second murder when
Tom proceeds to eat a roast
chicken with great sang froid
with a body stretched out cold on
the living room floor.
We first meet Tom and Philip
in Romo and after some scenes
vaguely reminiscent of “La Dolce
Vita” we realize that they are no
goodniks. Our impression is
strengthened because a passing
tourist calls Tom a “bum,” and
both boys wear their shirts open
to the waist which no self-respect
ing young San Franciscan on holi
day would do.
Oh, but didn’t I tell you, Philip
is a nice American boy, in spite
of his lack of haircut, who is ter
ribly rich and has fallen in love
with Marge, a sexy balletomane
who digs Fra Angelico.
TOM HAS BEEN hired by the
senior Mr. Greenleaf to bring
Philip back to America, and away
from the idleness of Italy. At
first Tom thinks that this is going
to be easy money but gradually
realizes he is merely the butt for
Philip’s sadistic pleasure, and
that the latter has no intention of
returning.
Spurred on by a passion for
Margo, and a love of Philip’s bank
balance and possessions, Tom
knifes Philip in the midst of a
card game on board the yacht.
As a result of a quarrel Marge
has deserted Philip, and thus
takes the quarrel as a reasonable
explanation of his disappearance.
Tom then proceds to lead a double
life, as himself with Marge in Ta
ormina, and as Philip in Rome
where he assimilates his entire
identity. Necessity demands a sec
ond murder which can be blamed
on Philip who is then convenient
ly disposed of by a suicide note.
This leaves the field clear for
friendly and helpful Tom to take
up a free and carefree life with
Marge, and enjoy as he calls it

“the best life.”
THE MORALS OF OUR society
unfortunately demand retribu
tion. It comes as the result of a
gruesome error in Tom’s careful
calculations which gives a second
of horror to equal “The Fiends.”
A story of this type dealing
with obsession and murder de
mands to be treated either as a
psychological study or as an ex
ercise in sustained suspense. In
stead director Rene Clement
gives us a mild paced Mediter
ranean travelogue, pleasant
enough I grant you, in which a
complex story is smothered in ir
relevant details. Characters ap
pear and disappear in a void in
cluding a highly improbable wom
an detective who looks like Ger
trude Stein’s grandmother.
Alain Delon as Tom looks even
more beautiful than when he
played Rocco but is given no real
chance to act. Marie Leforet as
Marge is stunningly sexual, but
what is more becomes very alive
as a person in spite of a limited
script.
