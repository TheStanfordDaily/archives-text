(EDITOR’S NOTE: Meet one
of the most powerful men in Con
gress—Rep. Wilbur Mills, D-
Ark. He is chairman of the House
Ways & Means Committee which
will pass <in key portions of Pres
ident Kennedy’s election-year leg
islative program. In an exclusive
interview with United Press In
ternational Mills discloses that he
will not support the President’s
program of medical care for the
aged under the Social Security
system. He also gives his views
on other major Kennedy requests
for broader tariff-cutting author
ity, tax reform and a revamped
program of public welfare.)

WASHINGTON (UPD- Chair
man Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark., of
the House Ways & Means Com
mittee disclosed yesterday that he
will not support the administra
tion’s hill to provide medical care
for the aged under Social Secu
rity.
But ho predicted that his com
mittee will give President Ken
nedy "much of what he asks” in
the way of new tariff-cutting pow
ers, tax reforms and overhaul of
public welfare programs.
Mills discussed these and other
major legislative proposals pend
ing before the Ways & Means
Committee in an interview with
United Press International in his
office in Room 1134 of the old
House office building on Capitol
Hill.
THE BLACK-HAIRED, S2-year
old Arkansas Democrat is one of
the key men in Congress this

year. The House committee which
he heads has jurisdiction over all
bills affecting taxes, Social Secu
rity, or tariffs. A large portion of
President Kennedy’s 1962 legisla
tive program—including the medi
cal care bill which involves an in
crease in Social Security payroll
taxes—falls within the commit
te’s bailiwick.
Mills emphasized his desire to
support the President’s legisla
tive program wherever he feels
he can do so in good conscience,
“I’m a Democrat,” he said,
"and whenever I can go along on
a program, I go along.”
BUT HE POINTED out that he
also is one of the authors of the
Kcrr-Mills Act, passed in 1960,
which seeks to moot the health
care problem through public as
sistance grants to the needy aged.
"It is entirely too early to
reach any definite conclusions as
to whether the Kcrr-Mills ap
proach will or will not solve the
health care problems of our elder
citizens,” he said. “I believe it
should be given sufficient time to
show what it can do. Therefore, I
do not see how I can vote, at. this
session of Congress, for a differ
ent approach to the problem
through Social Security.”
Mills said he definitely will
bring the administration’s pro
posal to a vote before his com
mittee, and "if a majority of the
members favor it, I have no in
tention of trying to thwart it.”
Q. WHAT ARE THE prospects
for President Kennedy’s trade
bill?
A. It probably will engender

about as great a controversy as
any legislation at this session.
Q. How is the Ways & Means
Committee likely to line up on
this legislation?
A. The committee has tradition
ally been a strong supporter of
liberal world trade policies. A sub
stantial majority of the members
share President Kennedy’s con
viction that the United States
must maintain and if possible en
large its export markets, and that
new tariff-cutting powers will be
required to do this, especially in
our future trade relations with
the countries of the European
Common Market. The problem is
not the committee’s willingness
to accept a philosophy of trade
expansion, but determining what
Congress itself will accept.
