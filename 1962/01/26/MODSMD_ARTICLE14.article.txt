ADMITTANCE POLICY
Editor, The Daily:
The Political Union should be
congratulated on their new policy
of admittance to their lectures.
At the Fred Schwarz lecture, only
Stanford students were admitted
up until five minutes before the
lecture began. As a result, there
was room for all the students
who wished to attend.
One of the features that at
tracts students to Stanford is the
University’s reputation for ac
quiring notable persons to lecture
on the campus. It seems reason
able to demand that Stanford stu
dents have first claim to the space
at all such University sponsoied
functions. Certainly, those stu
dents who were turned away
from Mr. William Shirer’s speech
(which was under the auspices of
the Committee on Public Exer
cises) last quarter will agree with
this.
I can’t help thinking that others
will be similarly disappointed
when the Committee presents Mr.
Christian Herter next Tuesday. It
is up to the Committee to fulfill
its obligation, first to the stu
dents, and then to the public.

SCHWARZ SEMINARS
Editor, The Daily:
As participants in two of the
seminars on Dr. Schwarz and the
Radical Right, we would like to
commend the Socialist Caucus for
presenting this program. Presum
ably one of the main purposes
for inviting a speaker to Stanford
is to provoke consideration and
discussion of his ideas. The brief,
often chaotic question-and-answer
periods which traditionally follow
a speaker are generally inade
quate to this task; such seminars
provide a forum for free discus
sion and exchange of views.
The seminars in which we par
ticipated were well organized and
attended. They were held in the
relaxed atmosphere of the living
groups. The faculty member in
each case presented a stimulating
introduction to discussion.
Similar excellent programs
have been organized by Focus and
the Foreign Policy Institute. In
this case however, although the
Socialist Caucus was not the
sponsor of Dr. Schwarz, they
were interested enough to plan
a program of benefit to the wider
student body. We hope other
groups will follow their initiative.
