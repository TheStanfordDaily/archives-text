# BASKETBALL SQUAD TRAVELS TO WASHINGTON
## Indians Battle Huskies Twice 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
The Stanford basketball team
will be fighting for a share of
first place in the AAWU tonight
and tomorrow night when they

take on the Washington Huskies
twice in Seattle.
Stanford as of now has a 20
conference record, and is second
to the UCLA Bruins who are un
defeated in three games. The
Cards have won eleven straight
games, and are 13-2 on the sea
son. As far as the NCAA is con
cerned, Stanford is 9-2, since four
of the victories were at the ex
pense of service teams during a
Christmas junket.

Till: INDIANS WILL have con
siderably more trouble with the
Huskies than they did last week
end in the Pavilion. The Stanford
crowd packed into the friendly
confines of the Stanford home
court had no little bit to do with
the Tribe win.

Stanford hopes trt get more con
sistent scoring from center Tom
Dose than they have been getting
in conference play. Dose consist
ently drops in over 20 points
against non-conference teams
from the Northwest, but has trou
ble with AAWU opponents.
DOSE TALLIED 27 against
Washington State Monday, scored
25 and 27 against Oregon, and 21
and 14 against Oregon State.
However he has a grand total of
14 in two Big Five contests, so
the burden of proof will he on the
6-8 center this weekend.

With Dose’s poor shooting (for
him) against Washington and
California, Stanford has had to
fall back upon stringbean guard
Darrell Sutherland and muscular
6-8 forward John Windsor, last
year’s mainstay.
Sutherland has a 14-point per
game average in the AAWU, and
Windsor has scored 18 and 20
points in the Indians two league

games. Forward Hollis Moore has
been a consistently accurate shot,
as his five baskets in six shots in
AAWU will attest.
OTHER KEY performers for
Stanford are guards Don Clemet
son, now recovered from an eye
injury which hampered his shoot
ing last week, and Doug Clemet
son, the other half of a brother
duo that has opponents wonder
ing what they did to deserve it.
Forwards Phil Kelly and Bob
Sommers and center Mike Ledg
erwood are others who will play
important roles in the up-coming
two games.
Against the Cards, Washington
sends the AAWU’s biggest scor
ing threat, center Bill Hansen.
Hansen netted 29 points in the
first of the three games to be
played between the two schools,
and also was the leading rebound
er.
The forward spots for Wash
ington will be manned by Smiling
Roger Niva and Ed Corell. The
primary reason for Stanford’s
win over Washington was Corell’s
inability to score. He made ex
actly 0, which is 12 points under
his season average.
BIG ED WILL never be guard
ed more closely than he was by
Moore and Kelly that night, un
less it is by those two against
Stanford this weekend.
Niva is an outstanding defend
er, as his effective throttle of
Dose’s scoring proves.
Guards for Washington are
slated to be Keith Brown, who
drives well, but is not tough on
defense, and team captain Dick
Reiten, who occasionally gives op
ponents fits with a long accurate
one-hander.
THIS WOULD BE an impor
tant pair of games any year, but
now it is doubly so. Stanford fi
nally has a nat ional rating, either
sixteenth or eighteenth, depend
ing on which wire service you
subscribe to.
Washington has to win, or for
get all title hopes. They are 1-4,
and another defeat would be the
death knell. Stanford’s undefeat
ed conference record is on the
line, and two wins would give
them an inside track to the title,
since UCLA and USC are an even
money bet to knock each other
off and ruin each others’ chances.

Devotees of physical com
bat sports will have their
wildest dreams fulfilled this
weekend. The Stanford
wrestlers host the Cabrillo
wrestlers tomorrow at 1 pan.
On the same day, the Indian
boxers host the conference
novice boxing match starting
at H pan.

as his five baskets in six shots in
AAWU will attest.
OTHER KEY performers for
Stanford are guards Don Clemet
son, now recovered from an eye
injury which hampered his shoot
ing last week, and Doug Clemet
son, the other half of a brother
duo that has opponents wonder
ing what they did to deserve it.
Forwards Phil Kelly and Bob
Sommers and center Mike Ledg
erwood are others who will play
important roles in the up-coming
two games.
Against the Cards, Washington
sends the AAWU’s biggest scor
ing threat, center Bill Hansen.
Hansen netted 29 points in the
first of the three games to be
played between the two schools,
and also was the leading rebound
er.
The forward spots for Wash
ington will be manned by Smiling
Roger Niva and Ed Corell. The
primary reason for Stanford’s
win over Washington was Corell’s
inability to score. He made ex
actly 0, which is 12 points under
his season average.
BIG ED WILL never be guard
ed more closely than he was by
Moore and Kelly that night, un
less it is by those two against
Stanford this weekend.
Niva is an outstanding defend
er, as his effective throttle of
Dose’s scoring proves.
Guards for Washington are
slated to be Keith Brown, who
drives well, but is not tough on
defense, and team captain Dick
Reiten, who occasionally gives op
ponents fits with a long accurate
one-hander.
THIS WOULD BE an impor
tant pair of games any year, but
now it is doubly so. Stanford fi
nally has a nat ional rating, either
sixteenth or eighteenth, depend
ing on which wire service you
subscribe to.
Washington has to win, or for
get all title hopes. They are 1-4,
and another defeat would be the
death knell. Stanford’s undefeat
ed conference record is on the
line, and two wins would give
them an inside track to the title,
since UCLA and USC are an even
money bet to knock each other
off and ruin each others’ chances.

Devotees of physical com

wildest dreams fulfilled this
weekend. The Stanford
wrestlers host the Cabrillo
wrestlers tomorrow at 1 pan.
On the same day, the Indian
boxers host the conference
novice boxing match starting

The Stanford basketball team
will be fighting for a share of
first place in the AAWU tonight
and tomorrow night when they

take on the Washington Huskies
twice in Seattle.
Stanford as of now has a 20
conference record, and is second
to the UCLA Bruins who are un
defeated in three games. The
Cards have won eleven straight
games, and are 13-2 on the sea
son. As far as the NCAA is con
cerned, Stanford is 9-2, since four
of the victories were at the ex
pense of service teams during a
Christmas junket.

siderably more trouble with the
Huskies than they did last week
end in the Pavilion. The Stanford
crowd packed into the friendly
confines of the Stanford home
court had no little bit to do with
the Tribe win.

Stanford hopes trt get more con
sistent scoring from center Tom
Dose than they have been getting
in conference play. Dose consist
ently drops in over 20 points
against non-conference teams
from the Northwest, but has trou

DOSE TALLIED 27 against
Washington State Monday, scored
25 and 27 against Oregon, and 21
and 14 against Oregon State.
However he has a grand total of
14 in two Big Five contests, so
the burden of proof will he on the
6-8 center this weekend.

With Dose’s poor shooting (for
him) against Washington and
California, Stanford has had to
fall back upon stringbean guard
Darrell Sutherland and muscular
6-8 forward John Windsor, last
year’s mainstay.
Sutherland has a 14-point per
game average in the AAWU, and
Windsor has scored 18 and 20
points in the Indians two league

games. Forward Hollis Moore has

line, and two wins would give
them an inside track to the title,
since UCLA and USC are an even
money bet to knock each other
off and ruin each others’ chances.

Devotees of physical com
bat sports will have their
wildest dreams fulfilled this
weekend. The Stanford
wrestlers host the Cabrillo
wrestlers tomorrow at 1 pan.
On the same day, the Indian
boxers host the conference
novice boxing match starting
at H pan.
The Stanford basketball team
will be fighting for a share of
first place in the AAWU tonight
and tomorrow night when they

take on the Washington Huskies
twice in Seattle.
Stanford as of now has a 20
conference record, and is second
to the UCLA Bruins who are un
defeated in three games. The
Cards have won eleven straight
games, and are 13-2 on the sea
son. As far as the NCAA is con
cerned, Stanford is 9-2, since four
of the victories were at the ex
pense of service teams during a
Christmas junket.

Till: INDIANS WILL have con
siderably more trouble with the
Huskies than they did last week
end in the Pavilion. The Stanford
crowd packed into the friendly
confines of the Stanford home
court had no little bit to do with
the Tribe win.

Stanford hopes trt get more con
sistent scoring from center Tom
Dose than they have been getting
in conference play. Dose consist
ently drops in over 20 points
against non-conference teams
from the Northwest, but has trou
ble with AAWU opponents.
DOSE TALLIED 27 against
Washington State Monday, scored
25 and 27 against Oregon, and 21
and 14 against Oregon State.
However he has a grand total of
14 in two Big Five contests, so
the burden of proof will he on the
6-8 center this weekend.

With Dose’s poor shooting (for
him) against Washington and
California, Stanford has had to
fall back upon stringbean guard
Darrell Sutherland and muscular
6-8 forward John Windsor, last
year’s mainstay.
Sutherland has a 14-point per
game average in the AAWU, and
Windsor has scored 18 and 20
points in the Indians two league

games. Forward Hollis Moore has
been a consistently accurate shot,
as his five baskets in six shots in
AAWU will attest.
OTHER KEY performers for
Stanford are guards Don Clemet
son, now recovered from an eye
injury which hampered his shoot
ing last week, and Doug Clemet
son, the other half of a brother
duo that has opponents wonder
ing what they did to deserve it.
Forwards Phil Kelly and Bob
Sommers and center Mike Ledg
erwood are others who will play
important roles in the up-coming
two games.
Against the Cards, Washington
sends the AAWU’s biggest scor
ing threat, center Bill Hansen.
Hansen netted 29 points in the
first of the three games to be
played between the two schools,
and also was the leading rebound
er.
The forward spots for Wash
ington will be manned by Smiling
Roger Niva and Ed Corell. The
primary reason for Stanford’s
win over Washington was Corell’s
inability to score. He made ex
actly 0, which is 12 points under
his season average.
BIG ED WILL never be guard
ed more closely than he was by
Moore and Kelly that night, un
less it is by those two against
Stanford this weekend.
Niva is an outstanding defend
er, as his effective throttle of
Dose’s scoring proves.
Guards for Washington are
slated to be Keith Brown, who
drives well, but is not tough on
defense, and team captain Dick
Reiten, who occasionally gives op
ponents fits with a long accurate
one-hander.
THIS WOULD BE an impor
tant pair of games any year, but
now it is doubly so. Stanford fi
nally has a nat ional rating, either
sixteenth or eighteenth, depend
ing on which wire service you
subscribe to.
Washington has to win, or for
get all title hopes. They are 1-4,
and another defeat would be the
death knell. Stanford’s undefeat
ed conference record is on the
line, and two wins would give
them an inside track to the title,
