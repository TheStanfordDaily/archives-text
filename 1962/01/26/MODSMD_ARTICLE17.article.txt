# Stanford Ruggers At Home Against Tough Olympic Club
## 
### 
Stanford’s varsity rugby team
returns to action after a two-week
layoff when the Cards entertain
the tough San Francisco Olympic
Club on the Indian rugby field at
3 p.m. Saturday.
The Tribe currently is the hold
er of 1-0 record, pasteing the Cal
Bears at Berkeley by a 13-8 mar
gin two weeks ago. A match
scheduled for last week with the
University of the Pacific had to
be called off because of finals
at UOP.
ALSO POSSESSOR of a perfect
one win-no loss mark is the Olym
pic Club, which walloped the
Peninsula Ramblers, 11-3, in their
season inaugural.
The San Franciscans boast a
squad with a definite British
flavor with seven of the Winged
“O” starters from England, Can
ada and Ireland. The remainder
of the 15 opening spots are taken
up by veteran ruggers from Bay
Area universities.
Reported to have over 100 men
turning out for rugby this year,
the Olympic Club will have its
usual outstanding squad. The
main strength of the Club will be
its experience. No team making
a lot of mistakes can hope to es
cape a licking at its hands.
AMONG THE outstanding “O”
Clubbers are Lou Baldacci, All-
American fullback from Michi
gan; John Hennessy, a prop from
i Ireland; Bernie Stoltzoff, the
I first 5/8; and lan Ruxter from

England, who handles the kicking
duties along with his breakaway
job.
Card coach Pete Kmetovic rates
the San Francisco team as one of
the strongest in the area. Com
menting that ihe Olympic Club
ruggers will give his Indians
“all they can handle,” Kmetovic
added that the Cards can win “if

they don’t get rocky after their
win over California.”
Another danger is that (ho Stan
ford rugbymen won’t have the
enthusiasm that was worked up
for the Bear clash, traditionally
the Tribe’s toughest game.
THERE WILL BE two lineup
changes in the Stanford opening
lineup. A1 Hildebrand has moved
up to a second row spot, and
Clark Weaver has taken over one
wing position for Chuck Cobb,
who has departed to participate
in a track meet.

layoff when the Cards entertain
the tough San Francisco Olympic
Club on the Indian rugby field at
3 p.m. Saturday.
The Tribe currently is the hold
er of 1-0 record, pasteing the Cal
Bears at Berkeley by a 13-8 mar
gin two weeks ago. A match
scheduled for last week with the
University of the Pacific had to
be called off because of finals
at UOP.
ALSO POSSESSOR of a perfect
one win-no loss mark is the Olym
pic Club, which walloped the
Peninsula Ramblers, 11-3, in their
season inaugural.
The San Franciscans boast a
squad with a definite British
flavor with seven of the Winged
“O” starters from England, Can
ada and Ireland. The remainder
of the 15 opening spots are taken
up by veteran ruggers from Bay
Area universities.
Reported to have over 100 men
turning out for rugby this year,
the Olympic Club will have its
usual outstanding squad. The
main strength of the Club will be
its experience. No team making
a lot of mistakes can hope to es
cape a licking at its hands.
AMONG THE outstanding “O”
Clubbers are Lou Baldacci, All-
American fullback from Michi
gan; John Hennessy, a prop from
i Ireland; Bernie Stoltzoff, the
I first 5/8; and lan Ruxter from

England, who handles the kicking
duties along with his breakaway
job.
Card coach Pete Kmetovic rates
the San Francisco team as one of
the strongest in the area. Com
menting that ihe Olympic Club
ruggers will give his Indians
“all they can handle,” Kmetovic
added that the Cards can win “if

they don’t get rocky after their
win over California.”
Another danger is that (ho Stan
ford rugbymen won’t have the
enthusiasm that was worked up
for the Bear clash, traditionally
the Tribe’s toughest game.
THERE WILL BE two lineup
changes in the Stanford opening
lineup. A1 Hildebrand has moved
up to a second row spot, and
Clark Weaver has taken over one
wing position for Chuck Cobb,
who has departed to participate
in a track meet.
Stanford’s varsity rugby team
returns to action after a two-week
