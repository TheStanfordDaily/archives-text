community who have expressed
concern about the growing
strength and activity of the ultra
right in the United States.
“The conference will analyze
the roots and causes of this move
ment and its impact upon the
community. It will take the form
of panel discussions open to the
public,” Ryther said.
Ho added that “the sponsors
feel that many people, alarmed
by the rise of right wing move

the conference will provide a
catalyst for informed and active
opposition.”
