# Mild Hope For Church Unity Told

### VIVI BOZMAN 
Cautious optimism was the at
titude expressed by Roman Cath
olic Daniel O’Hanlon, S.J., and
Protestant theologian Robert Mc-
Afee Brown, in a discussion last
night on the prospects for Chris
tian unity.
Citing the forthcoming Ecu
menical Council of the Roman
Catholic Church as a means for
renewal of the Church which will
eventually lead to reunion, O’Han
lon noted four areas of renewal:
the Bible, the life of the Church,
religious liberty, and the attitude
of Catholics toward the division
of Christianity.
POPE JOHN has made it clear
that “the Ecumenical Council
looks to unity and will humbly
recognize the need for renewal
and reform to clear the way.” The
Catholic Church has no “desire
to dominate others, but to be
faithful to the Lord.”
O’Hanlon urged that Christians
pray for unity and meet each
other at the grassroots level.
“Reform must be the road
toward reunion,” Brown asserted,
noting that the Roman Catholic
Church “has not always been a
fully faithful steward of the truth
in all areas.”
FROWN ADVISED Protestants
to entertain modest hopes for
unity, saying that the Council
shows Roman Catholic concern
for reform which will provide
material in this generation with
which in another generation the
Holy Spirit can work.
The end to the concept of Lu
ther as “a lecherous monk who
wanted to marry that nun,” the
concept of a “priesthood of all
the believers,” the acceptance of
a share of responsibility for the
tragic division, and an attempt to
define the Church’s infallibility
“the final, awesome stumbling
block in the road to unity,” are
trends in the Roman Catholic
Church Brown cited as encour
aging.
