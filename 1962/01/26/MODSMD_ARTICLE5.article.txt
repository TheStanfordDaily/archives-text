# No Radiation from 'M,' Say Experts in Answer Panel

### DAN SCHWARTZ 
What radiation hazard does
Project M present to nearby resi
dents? Would an earthquake
cause great destruction on the
proposed accelerator? What ef
fort has Stanford made to make
the 2-milc-long accelerator more
than an architectural “sore
thumb?”
These wei'e a few of the ques
tions answered by a panel of
four Stanford loaders last night
in a public discussion held in Me
morial Auditorium, The speakers
were Dr. Frederick E. Terman.
vice-president and provost of the
University; Dr. Wolfgang K. H.
Panofsky. professor of physics
and director of the accelerator
project; Dr. Leonard I. Schiff,
professor and head of the Phys
ics Department: and Harry San
ders. Stanford director of plan

ning. Jim Day, a Palo Alto resi
dent acted as moderator.
THE PANELISTS told the au
dience that there is no possibility
of a radiation hazard from the
accelerator. The accelerator will
be heavily shielded from any pos
sible radiation hazard by 35 feet
of earth. This mould make the
detectable radiation from the ac
celerator less than the natural
radiation experienced from the
sun.
The speakers also noted that
the accelerator', unlike a nuclear
reactor, can be turned off, elim
inating the chance of a runaway.
Because of the direction that
the accelerator will be built, it
will receive only a horizontal
force from any possible earth
quake. This can be guarded
against, and any damage would
be minimal, the speakers said.
STANFORD’S AIM, when con
sidering the accelerator, has al
ways been that it would be of the

highest architectural standards,
the speakers said. Much concern
has been given to landscaping
and design, in the hopes that the
accelerator can be made an in
tegral part of the campus.
The panelists told the audience
that they expected the project to
take five years to complete and
cost $ll4 million. Over 700 people
will work at the site when it is in
full operation, and the electron
beam is expected to reach a pow
er of 45 BEV (Billion Electron
Volts). Although there is no way
of anticipating results, the panel
ists hope for a great storehouse
of knowledge about the structure
of atomic nuclei to come from the
project.

of earth. This mould make the
detectable radiation from the ac
celerator less than the natural
radiation experienced from the
sun.
The speakers also noted that
the accelerator', unlike a nuclear
reactor, can be turned off, elim
inating the chance of a runaway.
Because of the direction that
the accelerator will be built, it
will receive only a horizontal
force from any possible earth
quake. This can be guarded
against, and any damage would
be minimal, the speakers said.
STANFORD’S AIM, when con
sidering the accelerator, has al
ways been that it would be of the

highest architectural standards,
the speakers said. Much concern
has been given to landscaping
and design, in the hopes that the
accelerator can be made an in
tegral part of the campus.
The panelists told the audience
that they expected the project to
take five years to complete and
cost $ll4 million. Over 700 people
will work at the site when it is in
full operation, and the electron
beam is expected to reach a pow
er of 45 BEV (Billion Electron
Volts). Although there is no way
of anticipating results, the panel
ists hope for a great storehouse
of knowledge about the structure
of atomic nuclei to come from the
project.


FARM ADMINISTRATORS, PLANNERS, SCIENTISTS discuss the impact of Project M on the Stanford
community. Left to right are Physics Department Head Leonard I. Schiff, Panel Moderator Jim Day,
Linear Accelerator Director Wolfgang H. K. Panofsky, Provost Frederick E. Terman and Director of
Planning Harry Sanders.
What radiation hazard does
Project M present to nearby resi
dents? Would an earthquake
cause great destruction on the
proposed accelerator? What ef
fort has Stanford made to make
the 2-milc-long accelerator more
than an architectural “sore
thumb?”
These wei'e a few of the ques
tions answered by a panel of
four Stanford loaders last night
in a public discussion held in Me
morial Auditorium, The speakers
were Dr. Frederick E. Terman.

University; Dr. Wolfgang K. H.

THE PANELISTS told the au
dience that there is no possibility
of a radiation hazard from the
accelerator. The accelerator will
be heavily shielded from any pos
sible radiation hazard by 35 feet
of earth. This mould make the
