# Help Needed in Book Transfer
## 
### 
The HR African Desk needs
student man- and woman-power
to help move books collected for
its “Books for Africa” project to
a new storage building tomorrow.
At least 30 men are needed to
pack and sort the 75,000 textbooks
and then haul them in rented
trucks from the San Bruno Ware
house, where they have been
awaiting shipment, to the old
Whisman Elementary School in
Mountain View. Volunteers are
asked to telephone the African
desk at the HR.
BREAKFAST will be provided
for the group which will leave
from the HR Shack tomorrow
morning at 7 a.m. and will return
for lunch. The second group will
leave the shack at 1 p.m. and will
be back for dinner.
Book drive Chairman Jim Haas
obtained a five-month lease on the
old schoolhouse from the Palo
Alto office of Coldwell Ranker &
Co. for $l. A notice of eviction by
the Navy last week from the San
Bruno Warehouse makes the
move necessary.
The HR has been unofficially
assured that the Administration
for International Development
will supply shipping space for the
books, which will be sent to Brit
ish East Africa this spring.
