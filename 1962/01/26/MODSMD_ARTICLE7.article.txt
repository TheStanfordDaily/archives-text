# '6 Characters' Enjoyable, Vital
## 
### Bridget Hursley Dobson 
Seeing the Stanford Players’
j production of “Six Characters in
I Search of an Author” by Luigi
| Pirandello is a thoroughly enjoy
! able experience, and not an un
j important one. The play seriously
question the significance and
[ meaning of performed drama.
Pirandello expresses the impos
sibility of truth in drama by
showing actors trying to fit their
constantly changing beings into
an artistic mold which is fixed
forever.
BUT THE PLAY is neither
! preaching nor pedantic. It is high
j ly dramatic, and the Stanford
! Players’ production under the di
j rection of Michael Addison ful
j fills its tragi-comedy potential,
j Both performance ancrproduet4&n
are far above the standards for
j amateur players.
Suzanne Payne, playing one of
the six characters who interrupt
a group of actors in rehearsal,
! does a superior job of acting. The
1 Stepdaughter she portrays is full i
j of spit and fire, and she never
1 loses the characterization.
The part allows Miss Payne to

demonstrate the versatility of her
acting ability, which she succeeds
in showing off to advantage. In
deed Miss Payne is one of the
reasons why the production keeps
its lively pace.
ANOTHER one of the six char
acters, Stanley Weese, gives a
fine acting performance. In the
role of The Father, he is “full of
intellectual complications” which
arc the most direct expressions of
Pirandello’s philosophy of dra
matic art. Mr. Weese manages to
be at once tormented and mature,
and his performance reflects a
sensitive interpretation of the
character, as well as a good deal
of talent.
Lisa Lauterer is quite adequate
in the role of the rejected Mother.
-_Th(y part is particularly difficult
because" ft —+ms —long lapses on
stage without dialogue. Miss Lau
terer manages to affect a mood of
misery, but her performance lias
a slightly trite ring to it.
AS THE SON, John McDaniels
i does a good job of acting. Though
i he is on stage most of the time,
! lie has very few lines. Neverthe
* less, he manages to communicate

his total lack of capacity for hu
man charity. He is completely be
lievable as a pathetic and emo
tionally disturbed young man.
The group of actors who are
interrupted by the six characters
are given vitality by the fine act
ing of Samira Kirollos and Her
bert Kennedy. As the Leading
Lady, Samira Kirollos has the
vanity and self-assurance of a
prima donna. She is leggy and
chic, and appropriate in the part.
Herbert Kennedy is a slightly
pompous, and quite amusing.
Leading Man.
ANTONY ALCOCK as The Di
rector was excellent when ho
slowed down his speeches to the
point where the words could be
understood.
Setting by Richard Hay, cos
tumes by Robert Harden and
lighting by James Lyon all con
tributed significantly to the fine
production.
The play continues tonight and
tomorrow night this week, and
Feb. 3. Ticket prices are $1.50 for
the general public on Wednesday
and Thursday, $2 on Friday and
Saturday; student rates arc 50
cents less.
