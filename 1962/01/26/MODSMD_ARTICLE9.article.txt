## 
### 
PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (UPI)-Secretary of State Dean
Husk attacked Fidel Castro in blistering terms yesterday and
called on the eighth inter-American conference to adopt a four
point program to defend the hemisphere against communism.

Rusk called for formal brand
ing of Cuba as a Communist
satellite, its ouster from the
American family, a halt to all
trade with it and immediate col
lective defense measures against
it.
IN HIS vigorously-woi’ded 40-
minute speech. Rusk termed
Cuba a “smirking sycophant for
the Communist bloc” and called
Premier Fidel Castro “a petty ty
rant” who had to be put in his
place.
Rusk said the Americas were
“repelled” by the internal ex
cesses of the Castro regime which
he labelled the “American agent
of world communism.”
Speakers for Peru, Venezuela
and Panama in the morning gen
eral session also castigated the
Castro regime. They backed Rusk
in his demand for a collective
American rupture with Cuba.
IMEDIATELY after Rusk’s
speech, some delegates launched
a vigorous, behind-closed-doors
campaign to swing over to his
viewpoint the handful of big
Latin American nations resisting
immediate action against Cuba.
The anti-Castro program advo
cated by Rusk represented the
third major strategy change
adopted by the United States del
egation since last Sunday’s con
ference opening. Previously, the
U.S. had called for immediate po
litical and economic sanctions
against Castro, then switched to
demands for his ouster from the
American family.
Meeting concurrently with the
conference general assembly was
a “phantom assembly” working
behind the scene to present to the
full body by Monday a resolution
sure to be adopted without dis
sention.
