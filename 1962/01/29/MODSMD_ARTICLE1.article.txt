# LOWENSTEIN:
## Student Incentive Needed at Stanford 
### DAN SCHWARTZ 
“Students, more than any other single group, can influence the
policies of the uncommitted nations,” said Assistant Dean of Men
Allard K. Lowenstein in an open discussion at the Sigma Nu house
last night. He is also a lecturer in Political Science and the Director
of the Stern Houses. He emphasized that students in the United

States, and at Stanford in particu-'
lar, arc unconscious of the role
that they can play, not only in
student affairs, but also in world
affairs. “Students in the free
world and the Communist world,”
he said, “are competing for the
intellectual groups in the world,
and the free world is losing.” He
said that unless students begin to
realize the responsibility that
they have, they should not be sur
prised when they see the rest of
the nations slipping away from
the Free World into Communism.
LOWENSTEIN said that many
of the students of the world have
the feeling that the United States
is indifferent to them. They natu
rally turn to Communism which
shows interest in them with pub
lications, scholarships, invitations
to world conventions of students
and the like.
The students, particularly at
Stanford, do not realize the in
fluence that they can have, he
said. “Almost anything can be
done in the University by organ
ized student pressure.” He felt
that the Student Government
should have great influence over
University policy as the organiza
tion representing all of the stu
dent body. “The Student Govern
ment should protect the rights of
the students,” he said.
Individual incentive is needed
and lacking at Stanford. “If one
tenth the time wore spent going
out and looking for solutions to
the problems as were spent on
House Decorations for Big Game,
a tremendous amount of influ
ence would be felt,” he said.
LOWENSTEIN also comment
ed about the house system at
Stanford. While the University
publicizes a three-type equal
house system, this is not really
the case, ho said. He felt that
there should be a greater cross
section of all types of students
in each system to strengthen each
system. The social stigma against
any freshman who is not accepted
into a fraternity should not ex
ist.
He felt that there is a funda
mental problem in the way fra
ternity rushing is held. There
should not be those who feel such
a social stigma against them be
cause they were not accepted in a
fraternity, and those who were
the usual “fraternity material”
should not feel obligated to choose
a fraternity but should be able
to make up their own choices
about their places to live.
The fraternities should more
effectively choose their members
instead of relying entirely on su
perficial characteristics of soci
ability or athletic skill, he said.
The fraternities should consider
how they can help the individual
rather than vice versa.

DECISIONS about rushing and
other problems, he added, still de
pend entirely on the students.
Any problems, if presented with
politeness and organization, will
eventually bo solved if enough
student incentive is shown.
