## 'Dept. of State Does Not Want Cold War Won' 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Sen.
Strom Thurmond said yesterday
that speech changes brought out
in the Senate’s inquiry of alleged
military “muzzling” convinces
him the State Department has
"sold our leaders on the idea that
we do not want to win the cold
war.”
The South Carolina Democrat,
prime mover in the study being
conducted by a special armed
services subcommittee, made his
remarks in an appraisal of the
hearings to date.
“From my study of the cen
sored items and my acquaintance
with recent and past policies in
dealing with the Communist
methods, I am convinced that
these actions reflect what I call a
‘no win’ policy,” Thurmond said
in a letter to weekly newspapers
of his state.
“OUR STATE Department poli
cy planners have sold our leaders
on the idea that we do not want
to win the cold war.”
In one respect, Thurmond’s
comments failed to jibe with a
capsule analysis of the testimony
made public Saturday by subcom
mittee chairman John C. Stennis,
D-Miss.
Stennis said last week’s ses
sions established “reasonable jus
tification for the existence” of
some system for policy review of
speeches by military officers.
THURMOND, presenting his
views in a letter sent to the sub
committee by former President
Eisenhower, said, however, he is
glad the ex-presidont “has been a
big enough man to announce to
the world that his administration
and his predecessors wore wrong
in implementing censorship poli
cies.”
Eisenhower said that even if
similar policies wore in effect dur
ing his administration, he now
questions the value of any speech
review procedure for "topmost”
officials—both civilian and mili
tary. Stennis has said the sub
committee will ask what Eisen
hower meant by “topmost.”
Thurmond characterized as
“shocking” certain of the State
Department censors’ comments
disclosed during the hearings. The
senator said: “What remains to
be answered is whether the cen
sors are acting capriciously on
their own or acting in accordance
with established policies which
have not been made readily avail
able to the public.”
The subcommittee will resume
hearings tomorrow morning with
chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy
and Air Force.
