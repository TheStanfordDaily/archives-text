# Courses, Departments Come Under Scrutiny
## 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Stanford is
noted for its luck of a Scratch
Sheet and other methods of criti
cism of University instructors and
departments criticism which
definitely Is needed. This is one
area the Committee on Academic
Affairs set up by ASSU President
Bob Sayler is looking into, and
this article is an outgrowth of a
subcommittee of the main body.
Purpose of the articles which
will appear in The Daily is to
present this intelligent criticism
gathered from students who are
majors in the department under
discussion, as explained in today’s
introductory article. The first ar
ticle dealing with a specific de
partment will appear tomorrow;
it will deal with the English De
partment.)
Is Stanford a first-rate school?
The statistics say yes. But what
does the undergraduate have to
say who suffers three lifeless lec
tures a day, who finds it more
worthwhile to chew on his pen
than take notes, who knows a
professor cares less about a
course than he does?
It is an old sermon that goes,
“Stanford students lack motiva
tion.” Little exaggeration is risk
ed, however, in saying the same
about Stanford professors. What
other phrase but “lack of motiva
tion” is appropriate to describe
teachers whose lecture notes are
ancient, whose delivery is disor
ganized, or whose contact with
students consists of office hours
unkept?
In any one quarter it is a fact
that the undergraduate encoun
ters at least one course that is
badly presented; student and
teacher will meet to bore each
other for an hour. Such courses
are not merely unpleasant, they
are parasites which suck the life
blood out of a university. They
infect the whole academic en
vironment with a noxious apathy
and do active harm to the under
graduate’s potential interest in
scholarship. As intellectual de
cline proceeds, entire departments
begin the slide to minimum ef
fort and slipshod techniques of
instruction.
IF THESE generalizations are
unpleasant, that does not alter
their truth. They are based on
evidence which any undergradu
ate after two years at Stanford
can corroborate: he need only add
up the number of courses in
which his professors have not
done their best; he can point
faithfully to the departments that
are distinguished for their inade
quacy.
Poorly taught courses can easi
ly bo discovered and side-stepped
by most students. But an “ob
stacle course” education is not
what the undergraduate is paying
for, and not what he will profit
from. Sidestepping is at present
the most reliable method of en
suring consistently good courses,
but the very fact that students
must resort to this practice
means there is something patho
logical about a Stanford educa
tion. Where students are dodging
teachers and departments, and
little is done to draw them back,
the outcome is mutual evasion.
Students shy away from profes
sors, professors from students,
and each says of the other, “If
he isn’t interested, why should I
be?”
Whose fault is this? Blame is
parceled to the student with the
argument that if he were really
interested in scholarship he would
forge ahead regardless of profes
sors’ faults. But this argument
is only a deception which skirts
around the obligations of the Uni
versity. It is the University, the
faculty in particular, which must
lead the student, even if it means
having to seduce a case of total
indifference. It should bo the edu
cator’s life-project to develop stu
dent potentialities. It is obvious,
however, that many Stanford pro
fessors would rather not respond
to the challenge. The student
often finds his back turned; he is
subjected repeatedly to inferior
instruction.
GIVEN THESE views, what
should be done? By the testimony
of professors, no one of them will
be so bold as to criticize another.
Logically, then, the initiative
must come from the student.
This group has taken upon it
self the task of looking into the

various departments of the under
graduate Humanities and Sci
ences and evaluating each in
terms of how well it presents its
material. Formally, the group is
authorized by the ASSU as part
of the Committee on Academic
Affairs, and its program is as fol
lows :
1. A column will appear regu
larly in The Daily undertaking
criticism of one department by
students in that department.
2. Before the end of winter
quarter a questionnaire will bo
circulated to all students, asking
opinions and evaluations of spe
cific teachers, courses, and de
partments.
3. Spring quarter the Scratch
Sheet, a student publication list
ing selected courses from each
depai’tment and describing their
instructive value to students, will
be revived.
4. Once a week seminars on
each department will be held,
where students may air griev
ances about the department, and
where, hopefully, faculty mem
bers attending informally will
hear them.
PROFESSORS WITH arched
eyebrows will ask defiantly, “Who
are undergraduates to judge my
competence?” Admittedly, an un
dergraduate is in no position to
judge the scholarly competence
of a professor. But a student is
capable of deciding whether a
professor is getting something
across to him. It is not the capaci
ty of the professor which is being
questioned; it is his output. How
up to date is his lecture materi
al? How much effort does he put
into his delivery? What positive
attempts does he make to draw
students to him and interest them
in his subject? The student can
answer questions like these, and
it is to his benefit as well as the
professors that he begin to do so.
Professors will hardly relish
the prospect of a student assault
on their educational methods. But
if a professor is insulted by a
suggestion for improvement, per
haps he should think first about
the degree of his guilt. Possibly
there are legitimate grounds for
complaint, and before becoming
hostile, he should consider the
more cooperative reaction of ask
ing himself where the faults lie
and where the remedies. A per
sonal war between student and
teacher exposes the vanity of
both; such embitterment is not
this committee’s aim.
We will work from the assump
tion that in every professor’s con
science there is the desire to ful
fill the purpose of education by
calling on all his talents, one of
which should be tolerance of con
structive criticism. Wo will even
be so visionary as to foresee the
day when professors and students
will candidly exchange sugges
tions for their mutual improve
ment.
IF GIVEN A SAY in academic
reform, will the undergraduate
respond? It is astonishing that,
in the myriad of organizations
formed to flip cards and argue
politics, no medium of student
faculty communication on aca
demic matters has even been con
templated. Presumably the stu
dent is anxious to tell professors
how they can learn more from
them. This group’s work will be
the student’s chance to do so. On
the other side, professors should
be eager for the results. The suc
cess of our endeavors will be a
measure of how much both stu
dent and professor are concerned
about good education.
