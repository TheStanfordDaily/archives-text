### JUDY SKLAR Associate Editor 
A magazine whose founding
premise is that Stanford students
and professors have the ability
and right to criticize their field,
their University and their posi
tion in the public realm received
LASSU approval to publish a
first trial issue last week.
Krino, from the Greek “I
judge,” will attempt to provide
Stanford with a critical, not a
literary, magazine.
According to its editor, Ray
mond A. Frier, ‘‘There will be no
such thing as ‘Krino style.’ ” The
magazine does not want to be
forced to reject perceptive work
because it is not written in cus

tomary literary magazine style.
THE FIRST ISSUE, which will
appear during the first two weeks
of April, is to be a flyer for
judging the reception of the mag
azine. If the magazine gets a good
reception, it will be published
quarterly.
The publishers, now an amor
phous group of students center
ing around the editor, the sub
editor John Miller and the busi
ness manager Michael Gagarin,
consider themselves representa
live of a large number of aware
students on campus for whom
Krino can provide a vehicle of
expression. They expect, to en
large their staff by attracting
some of the campus’ solitary
critics.
They expect their contributors
and supporters to have something
to say and to be strong enough to
say it.
ARTICLES WILL be expected
to have a broad enough context

so that they will provoke intelli
gent, eritieal response in their
readers.
The cost of the first Issue, $250,
will be met by donations within
the group. Everyone will receive
back a proportion of his original
investment, after the capital is
liquidated in May.
The magazine will sell for 30
cents a copy.
With the acceptance of the first
issue, Krino editors plan to de
velop a stronger administrative
form. They will also apply for
University and outside support
and advertising. Costs, because
of different printing processes,
will be about $5OO for later issues.
Krino also strives for coopera
tion among campus publications
since it believes that all are work
ing toward the same goal
achieving the maximum degree of
personal, intellectual and cultural
consciousness on campus and in
the world.

magazine does not want to be
forced to reject perceptive work
because it is not written in cus

tomary literary magazine style.
THE FIRST ISSUE, which will
appear during the first two weeks
of April, is to be a flyer for
judging the reception of the mag
azine. If the magazine gets a good
reception, it will be published
quarterly.
The publishers, now an amor
phous group of students center
ing around the editor, the sub
editor John Miller and the busi
ness manager Michael Gagarin,
consider themselves representa
live of a large number of aware
students on campus for whom
Krino can provide a vehicle of
expression. They expect, to en
large their staff by attracting
some of the campus’ solitary
critics.
They expect their contributors
and supporters to have something
to say and to be strong enough to
say it.
ARTICLES WILL be expected
to have a broad enough context

so that they will provoke intelli
gent, eritieal response in their
readers.
The cost of the first Issue, $250,
will be met by donations within
the group. Everyone will receive
back a proportion of his original
investment, after the capital is
liquidated in May.
The magazine will sell for 30
cents a copy.
With the acceptance of the first
issue, Krino editors plan to de
velop a stronger administrative
form. They will also apply for
University and outside support
and advertising. Costs, because
of different printing processes,
will be about $5OO for later issues.
Krino also strives for coopera
tion among campus publications
since it believes that all are work
ing toward the same goal
achieving the maximum degree of
personal, intellectual and cultural
consciousness on campus and in
the world.
A magazine whose founding
premise is that Stanford students
and professors have the ability
and right to criticize their field,
their University and their posi
tion in the public realm received
LASSU approval to publish a
first trial issue last week.
Krino, from the Greek “I
judge,” will attempt to provide
Stanford with a critical, not a
literary, magazine.
According to its editor, Ray
mond A. Frier, ‘‘There will be no
such thing as ‘Krino style.’ ” The
magazine does not want to be
forced to reject perceptive work
because it is not written in cus

tomary literary magazine style.
