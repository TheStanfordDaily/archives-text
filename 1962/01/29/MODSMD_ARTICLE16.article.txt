GRADING SYSTEM
Editor, The Daily;

The recent change of meaning
of B and C grades has brought
forth some discussion of the grad
ing system in use here. With the
increasing competition for admis
sion to graduate school, competi
tion for grades has increased si
multaneously. What is needed is
not just a change in meaning of
the grades themselves, but a more
equitable system of assigning
grade points.
A system in use for many
years at several Eastern colleges
is based on 12 points, rather than
4. 12 points correspond to an A+,
11 for an A, 10 for an A—, etc. A
D- is worth 1 point, while an F
equals —l. This system gives
more freedom to those persons
assigning grades, because the stu
dent’s performance can be more
clearly evaluated. Credit is re
ceived only where it is due; in the
3 point system, a C+ is equiva
lent in points to a C+.
Consideration of this or similar
systems would be worthwhile.
Competition will not decrease;
what is needed is a truer system
of evaluating each student.

POETRY (?)
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford looks to Harvard,
With green and jealous eyes.
But Harvard looks to Oxford,
With envy undisguised.
Let’s have done with being,
The Harvard of the west.
If we must copy someone,
Let’s pick the very best.
E. S. Erdahl
