# Stanford Gives 'Bitchin' Image Over Television
## 
### DAVID QUARLES 
Stanford University projected a “Bitchin” black and while image
via a program of studied informality on KGO-TV Sunday, Jan.
21, at noon.
Entitled "Youth Looks at Tomorrow OFF THE CUFF,” the
show starred star pupils Susan Koessler, David Cathcart, Scotty
Thompson, Rich Garlinghouse and others.
Despite the dreary Madison Avenue advertising for the show
(“TIME VALUE.” “S.U. undergraduates express some frank and
sparkling viewpoints in a televised discussion”), the production as a
whole came off very well.
Perhaps the best performance was that of Miss Koessler, who
presented a clear discussion of her views tm orthodox religion.
David Cathcart was a close second with sonorous contributions
on many topics.
Other members of the panel were either too eager, smoked too
many cigarettes, or lounged a bit too comfortably on the sofas.
There was one tense moment at the end when everyone scram
bled to get out of the studio with lighted cigarettes, nearly burning
themselves as well as the sofas.
Norman Ross, himself a Stanford graduate, did a commendable
job of moderating, which, in this case, consisted in politely closing
the discussion when obviously there was nothing more of interest
to be said.
A few more such programs should set the pace for PACE.
