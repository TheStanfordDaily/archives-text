## RUGGERS UNBEATEN Card Ruggers Down S.F. Olympic Club as Hansel Lindskog Star 
### 
Stanford’s varsity rugby squad
scored their second win in as
many contests by walloping the
San Francisco Olympic Club by a
17-9 score on the Card rugby field
Saturday.
In a preliminary contest, the
Tribe junior varsity ruggers
stretched their season’s mark to
2-1, defeating the Olympic Club
“A” team, 8-6.
AFTER ALLOWING the San
Franciscans an early three-point
score on a penalty kick, the In
dian ruggers took charge and
moved out to an overwhelming
17-3 bidge before the Winged “O”
could score again late in the last
period.
The Cards’ first score came
only a minute after lan Euxter
had boosted the “O” Clubbers to
a 3-0 lead with a 30-yard penalty
boot when Stan Lindskog retali
ated for the home club with a 40-
yard penalty kick of his own to
knot the score at 3-3.
Stanford moved into the lead it
never relinquished midway
through the first half on a long
pass and rush play.
GETTING THE BALL out of a
scrum, Tom McManus passed it
over quickly to second 5/8 Hal
Steuber, who lateralled it just as
quickly to Rod Sears, moving up
from his fullback position.

Sears wasted no time in giving
the pigskin to Lindskog, who out
maneuvered the Olympic Club de
fense for 25 yards before giving it
to wing Clark Weaver, who flew
the final yards for the try.

Lindskog’s conversion attempt
was not good, unusual for 1 the
sure-footed Card, to leave the
Tribe in front, 6-3.
The last score of the first half
was another Lindskog penalty
kick from about 35 yards out.
STANFORD MISSED out on
another try minutes before the
intermission whistle when Weav
er fumbled a kick down to the
goal line by Steuber, as the score
remained 9-3 for the Indian rug
gers.
A third of the way through the
second period, the Cards scored
again on a try by hook John
Thomas and Lindskog added the
conversion to make the margin
14-3 in favor of the locals.

Tim Hansel closed out the In
dian point-making with a try after
stealing the ball from the Olym
pic Club backfield and racing 30
yards for the score. Lindskog
missed the conversion to leave
the Tribe in front. 17-3.
The visitors managed six points
in the final minutes of play on a
second penalty kick by Ruxton
and a try by Archie Chagonjian
following Weaver’s bad kick at
the goal line.
STANFORD COACH Pete Kme
tovich was generally pleased with
the play of his charges, especially
singling out for praise forwards
Randy Vahan and A1 Hildebrand
and scrum half Bob Price.
The next contest for the Tribe
rugbymen comes next Saturday
against the Peninsula Ramblers
on the Card field. The match will
be preceded by a JV game.

stretched their season’s mark to
2-1, defeating the Olympic Club
“A” team, 8-6.
AFTER ALLOWING the San
Franciscans an early three-point
score on a penalty kick, the In
dian ruggers took charge and
moved out to an overwhelming
17-3 bidge before the Winged “O”
could score again late in the last
period.
The Cards’ first score came
only a minute after lan Euxter
had boosted the “O” Clubbers to
a 3-0 lead with a 30-yard penalty
boot when Stan Lindskog retali
ated for the home club with a 40-
yard penalty kick of his own to
knot the score at 3-3.
Stanford moved into the lead it
never relinquished midway
through the first half on a long
pass and rush play.
GETTING THE BALL out of a
scrum, Tom McManus passed it
over quickly to second 5/8 Hal
Steuber, who lateralled it just as
quickly to Rod Sears, moving up
from his fullback position.

Sears wasted no time in giving
the pigskin to Lindskog, who out
maneuvered the Olympic Club de
fense for 25 yards before giving it
to wing Clark Weaver, who flew
the final yards for the try.

Lindskog’s conversion attempt
was not good, unusual for 1 the
sure-footed Card, to leave the
Tribe in front, 6-3.
The last score of the first half
was another Lindskog penalty
kick from about 35 yards out.
STANFORD MISSED out on
another try minutes before the
intermission whistle when Weav
er fumbled a kick down to the
goal line by Steuber, as the score
remained 9-3 for the Indian rug
gers.
A third of the way through the
second period, the Cards scored
again on a try by hook John
Thomas and Lindskog added the
conversion to make the margin
14-3 in favor of the locals.

Tim Hansel closed out the In
dian point-making with a try after
stealing the ball from the Olym
pic Club backfield and racing 30
yards for the score. Lindskog
missed the conversion to leave
the Tribe in front. 17-3.
The visitors managed six points
in the final minutes of play on a
second penalty kick by Ruxton
and a try by Archie Chagonjian
following Weaver’s bad kick at
the goal line.
STANFORD COACH Pete Kme
tovich was generally pleased with
the play of his charges, especially
singling out for praise forwards
Randy Vahan and A1 Hildebrand
and scrum half Bob Price.
The next contest for the Tribe
rugbymen comes next Saturday
against the Peninsula Ramblers
on the Card field. The match will
be preceded by a JV game.
