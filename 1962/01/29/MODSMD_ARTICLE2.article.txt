# No School Aid This Session, Says Powell
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP! I - Rep.
Adam C. Powell. D-N.Y., chair
man of the House Education and
Labor Committee, said yesterday
night federal aid for public school
construction is “dead for this ses
sion of Congress.”
Powell said a large number of
congressmen do not want the is
sue brought to a vote in the
House because they would be de
feated for re-election this year
“no matter which way they
voted.”
The Negro congressman from
New York City said "the religious
issue is what killed the bill.”
Powell said that in congression
al districts where the margin of
victory for the incumbent was 5
per cent or less, a vote on the
federal aid for public grade and
high schools would be enough to
defeat any congressman who was
recorded on it.
He said the Protestant and
Catholic opposition on whether
aid should be given to parochial
schools “is so alive that which
ever way they voted they would
be defeated.”
But Powell said a $1.5 billion
bill for federal aid to colleges
would be passed overwhelmingly.
