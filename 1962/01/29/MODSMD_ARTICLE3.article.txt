Look Tonight” and “When I Fall
in Love.” The group, backed by
their own combo, will present two
shows during the evening. Dance
music will be provided by Del
Courtney’s band.
The Toyon lounge offers a spa
cious (and romantic) setting. Ad
joining the main hall are two
more intiamte alcoves. Refresh
ments, with waiter service, will
bo free.
Starting at 9. the dance music
will continue until 1 a.m. There
will be an open house in the Toy
on rooms during that time.
Tickets will be on sale starting

ner for $3 a couple. Further in
