patrols yesterday sot up surprise
roadblocks around Paris in an in
tensified hunt for plastic bomb
carrying terrorists of the outlaw

Armed police squads began
checking identities and searching
automobiles on the outskirts of
the French capital during the

the Algerians program.
No arrests were reported in the
checks here during the day. But
in raids last week police with
held reports of arrests for several
days.
COVER NMENT spokesman
Louis Terrenoire said Sunday
night President Charles de Gaulle
has never been more “master of
himself” than now and never

more determined to crush the
“momentary adversity’’ plaguing
France.
“Believe me,” Terrenoire de
clared, "the republic will be de
fended. I tell you forcefully that
never has General de Gaulle been
more master of himself nor more
profoundly resolved.”
Reinforcements of four com
panies of Republican Security
Corps CRS—about 448 specially
trained riot policemen—rolled in
to Paris Saturday from the prov
inces with a maximum show of
force along the famed Champs
Elysecs.
