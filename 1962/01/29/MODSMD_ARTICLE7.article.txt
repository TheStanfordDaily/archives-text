# SCHIZOPHRENIC
## Scientist Finds Diary of Madman 
### 
Almost 30 years ago a young scientist bought a dingy, second
hand pair of books. He set them aside, unread.
When Gregory Bateson—now a visiting professor of anthro
pology al Stanford University rediscovered the volumes four years
ago. he found on important firsthand description of the lonely jour
ney from schizophrenic madness to recovery in the 1830’s. He also
discovered that only two other sets of the books were still in exist
ence.
WRITTEN by John Perecval, the son of a British prime minister,
the books have been edited and condensed into a single volume by
Bateson. “Perceval’s Narrative, A Patient’s Account of His Psychosis,
1830-32” was published this month by Stanford University Press.
During the years from purchase to perusal, Bateson was evolving
from an original interest in zoology to the culture-personality aspects
of anthropology. Ho was, he says, “ready” to read “Perceval’s Nar
rative" when ho rediscovered it, and to pursue the publication of
these writings he found important.
Bateson’s introduction summarizes his interest: “In recent years
a number of autobiographical books have been published dealing
with the writers’ experiences during psychosis, but in general the
value of these works is as specimens of psychotic or postpsychotic
utterances rather than as scientific contributions in their own right.
“JOHN PEBCEVAE achieved something more. In his compulsive
struggle to make sense of his psychotic experiences, he discovered
what we would today call the Freudian Unconscious . . . his theo
retical position is perhaps midway between that of Freud and that
of William Blake . . . Perceval’s discoveries and some features of
his story have relevance and importance for modern psychiatry.”
Perceval himself—a singularly stubborn, rigid, disciplined, and
upright individual in his early years—had qualities that Bateson
suggests may have helped him to survive his derangement. The very
nature of the psychosis, Bateson says, may have provided the path
way to Perceval’s future ability to lead an average man’s life.
Bateson comments, “In spite of Perceval’s bitterness at his
family and the institutions in which he was confined, ho had singu
larly good treatment for his time. He was a passionate man and a
seeker.
His determination and his pig-headedness stood him in good

stead. “While little of levity shows up in the early Perceval,’’ Bateson
continues, “it appears to emerge during his recovery. In his own
words, Perceval says, ‘ls God a God of the sincere, the grave, the
sober, and the chaste only? Is he not also the God of fun, of humour,
of frolic, or merriment, and of joviality? May not humour and jocu
larity be necessary for the healthful conduct of the understanding?
And although excess of levity and of abandonment are injurious, and
border on lunacy, yet, may not extreme starchness and severity
. . . be equally unnatural, irksome, and ungrateful?’”
BATESON leaving zoology, continued anthropological studies in
New Guinea and Bali. He served with the U.S. Office of Strategic
Services in Southeast Asia during the war years—when he was
married to Anthropologist Margaret Mead. His interest in the cul
ture-personality aspects of anthropology began developing at the
New School for Social Research and the Langley Porter Clinic.
These continue at Stanford today and with his work at the
Veterans’ Hospital in Menlo Park, where much of his time is devoted
of studying the schizophrenic, his communication, and what works
in helping him.
. Bateson is the author of “Naven,” a Stanford Press publication
about the peculiar ritual practiced by the latmul, a head-hunting
tribe of New Guinea. He has also produced several film studies, in
cluding one on play, with the otter as the central figure.
HE TEACHERS a graduate seminar at Stanford, and teaches
Stanford Medical School lesidents in psychiatry. Ho participates in
therapeutic work, and researches on methods of therapy. Not neglect
ing his first love, zoology, he is presently studying how octopi
manage to build a relationship, “From the stage of mutual distrust
to the cuddling at the bottom of the tank.”
Of the schizophrenic—of the man in the double-bind —Bateson
says, “This individual has found in his world that the rug is pulled
from under him constantly, that he is punished constantly for being
right. He gradually dares not know the difference between play and
seriousness, between the literal and the figurative. His motto would
seem to be ‘lf things are not as I want them, I will prove it.’ ”
To (he question, “Have you a profile, an image, or outline of the
sane or healthly man?”, Bateson replied, “If you had asked me that
question a few years ago I could have told you. li you ask me a few
years hence I might have another theory. But today, no,”

right. He gradually dares not know the difference between play and
seriousness, between the literal and the figurative. His motto would
seem to be ‘lf things are not as I want them, I will prove it.’ ”
To (he question, “Have you a profile, an image, or outline of the
sane or healthly man?”, Bateson replied, “If you had asked me that
question a few years ago I could have told you. li you ask me a few
years hence I might have another theory. But today, no,”
Almost 30 years ago a young scientist bought a dingy, second
hand pair of books. He set them aside, unread.
When Gregory Bateson—now a visiting professor of anthro
pology al Stanford University rediscovered the volumes four years
ago. he found on important firsthand description of the lonely jour
ney from schizophrenic madness to recovery in the 1830’s. He also
discovered that only two other sets of the books were still in exist
ence.
WRITTEN by John Perecval, the son of a British prime minister,
the books have been edited and condensed into a single volume by
Bateson. “Perceval’s Narrative, A Patient’s Account of His Psychosis,
1830-32” was published this month by Stanford University Press.
During the years from purchase to perusal, Bateson was evolving
from an original interest in zoology to the culture-personality aspects
of anthropology. Ho was, he says, “ready” to read “Perceval’s Nar
rative" when ho rediscovered it, and to pursue the publication of
these writings he found important.
Bateson’s introduction summarizes his interest: “In recent years
a number of autobiographical books have been published dealing
with the writers’ experiences during psychosis, but in general the
value of these works is as specimens of psychotic or postpsychotic
utterances rather than as scientific contributions in their own right.
“JOHN PEBCEVAE achieved something more. In his compulsive
struggle to make sense of his psychotic experiences, he discovered
what we would today call the Freudian Unconscious . . . his theo
retical position is perhaps midway between that of Freud and that
of William Blake . . . Perceval’s discoveries and some features of
his story have relevance and importance for modern psychiatry.”
Perceval himself—a singularly stubborn, rigid, disciplined, and
upright individual in his early years—had qualities that Bateson
suggests may have helped him to survive his derangement. The very
nature of the psychosis, Bateson says, may have provided the path
way to Perceval’s future ability to lead an average man’s life.
Bateson comments, “In spite of Perceval’s bitterness at his
family and the institutions in which he was confined, ho had singu
larly good treatment for his time. He was a passionate man and a
seeker.
His determination and his pig-headedness stood him in good

stead. “While little of levity shows up in the early Perceval,’’ Bateson
continues, “it appears to emerge during his recovery. In his own
words, Perceval says, ‘ls God a God of the sincere, the grave, the
sober, and the chaste only? Is he not also the God of fun, of humour,
of frolic, or merriment, and of joviality? May not humour and jocu
larity be necessary for the healthful conduct of the understanding?
And although excess of levity and of abandonment are injurious, and
border on lunacy, yet, may not extreme starchness and severity
. . . be equally unnatural, irksome, and ungrateful?’”
BATESON leaving zoology, continued anthropological studies in
New Guinea and Bali. He served with the U.S. Office of Strategic
Services in Southeast Asia during the war years—when he was
married to Anthropologist Margaret Mead. His interest in the cul
ture-personality aspects of anthropology began developing at the
New School for Social Research and the Langley Porter Clinic.
These continue at Stanford today and with his work at the
Veterans’ Hospital in Menlo Park, where much of his time is devoted
of studying the schizophrenic, his communication, and what works
in helping him.
. Bateson is the author of “Naven,” a Stanford Press publication
about the peculiar ritual practiced by the latmul, a head-hunting
tribe of New Guinea. He has also produced several film studies, in
cluding one on play, with the otter as the central figure.
HE TEACHERS a graduate seminar at Stanford, and teaches
Stanford Medical School lesidents in psychiatry. Ho participates in
therapeutic work, and researches on methods of therapy. Not neglect
ing his first love, zoology, he is presently studying how octopi
manage to build a relationship, “From the stage of mutual distrust
to the cuddling at the bottom of the tank.”
Of the schizophrenic—of the man in the double-bind —Bateson
says, “This individual has found in his world that the rug is pulled
from under him constantly, that he is punished constantly for being
right. He gradually dares not know the difference between play and
seriousness, between the literal and the figurative. His motto would

HE TEACHERS a graduate seminar at Stanford, and teaches
Stanford Medical School lesidents in psychiatry. Ho participates in
therapeutic work, and researches on methods of therapy. Not neglect
ing his first love, zoology, he is presently studying how octopi
manage to build a relationship, “From the stage of mutual distrust
to the cuddling at the bottom of the tank.”
Of the schizophrenic—of the man in the double-bind —Bateson
says, “This individual has found in his world that the rug is pulled
from under him constantly, that he is punished constantly for being
right. He gradually dares not know the difference between play and
seriousness, between the literal and the figurative. His motto would
seem to be ‘lf things are not as I want them, I will prove it.’ ”
To (he question, “Have you a profile, an image, or outline of the
sane or healthly man?”, Bateson replied, “If you had asked me that
question a few years ago I could have told you. li you ask me a few
years hence I might have another theory. But today, no,”
Almost 30 years ago a young scientist bought a dingy, second
hand pair of books. He set them aside, unread.
When Gregory Bateson—now a visiting professor of anthro
pology al Stanford University rediscovered the volumes four years
ago. he found on important firsthand description of the lonely jour
ney from schizophrenic madness to recovery in the 1830’s. He also
discovered that only two other sets of the books were still in exist
ence.
WRITTEN by John Perecval, the son of a British prime minister,
the books have been edited and condensed into a single volume by
Bateson. “Perceval’s Narrative, A Patient’s Account of His Psychosis,
1830-32” was published this month by Stanford University Press.
During the years from purchase to perusal, Bateson was evolving
from an original interest in zoology to the culture-personality aspects
of anthropology. Ho was, he says, “ready” to read “Perceval’s Nar
rative" when ho rediscovered it, and to pursue the publication of
these writings he found important.
Bateson’s introduction summarizes his interest: “In recent years
a number of autobiographical books have been published dealing
with the writers’ experiences during psychosis, but in general the
value of these works is as specimens of psychotic or postpsychotic
utterances rather than as scientific contributions in their own right.
“JOHN PEBCEVAE achieved something more. In his compulsive
struggle to make sense of his psychotic experiences, he discovered
what we would today call the Freudian Unconscious . . . his theo
retical position is perhaps midway between that of Freud and that
of William Blake . . . Perceval’s discoveries and some features of
his story have relevance and importance for modern psychiatry.”
Perceval himself—a singularly stubborn, rigid, disciplined, and
upright individual in his early years—had qualities that Bateson
suggests may have helped him to survive his derangement. The very
nature of the psychosis, Bateson says, may have provided the path
way to Perceval’s future ability to lead an average man’s life.
Bateson comments, “In spite of Perceval’s bitterness at his
family and the institutions in which he was confined, ho had singu
larly good treatment for his time. He was a passionate man and a
seeker.
His determination and his pig-headedness stood him in good

stead. “While little of levity shows up in the early Perceval,’’ Bateson
continues, “it appears to emerge during his recovery. In his own
words, Perceval says, ‘ls God a God of the sincere, the grave, the
sober, and the chaste only? Is he not also the God of fun, of humour,
of frolic, or merriment, and of joviality? May not humour and jocu
larity be necessary for the healthful conduct of the understanding?
And although excess of levity and of abandonment are injurious, and
border on lunacy, yet, may not extreme starchness and severity
. . . be equally unnatural, irksome, and ungrateful?’”
BATESON leaving zoology, continued anthropological studies in
New Guinea and Bali. He served with the U.S. Office of Strategic
Services in Southeast Asia during the war years—when he was
married to Anthropologist Margaret Mead. His interest in the cul
ture-personality aspects of anthropology began developing at the
New School for Social Research and the Langley Porter Clinic.
These continue at Stanford today and with his work at the
Veterans’ Hospital in Menlo Park, where much of his time is devoted
of studying the schizophrenic, his communication, and what works
in helping him.

about the peculiar ritual practiced by the latmul, a head-hunting
tribe of New Guinea. He has also produced several film studies, in
cluding one on play, with the otter as the central figure.
