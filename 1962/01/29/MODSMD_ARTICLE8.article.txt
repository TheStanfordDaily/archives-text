PUNTA DEL ESTE. Uruguay
(UPl)—The United States last
night abandoned proposals for
immediate expulsion of Cuba
from the inter-American system
in favor of a declaration of prin
ciples saying the Castro regime
must be deprived of participation
in the system.
U.S. sources said the change
was necessary to gain the United
States the 17 or 18 votes in its
support that would show hemi
sphere solidarity on the issue of
Cuban Premier Fidel Castro’s
threat to the hemisphere.
Other observers interpreted the
action to mean the United States
failed to get the 14 votes—a two
thirds majority necessary for
enactment of an immediate sus
pension action.
Earlier, Argentina had been re
ported wavering on whether to
become the 14th nation to vote for
Cuban expulsion. U.S. Secretary
of State Dean Rusk was reported
hopeful of the vote of Argentine
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel
Carcano, not only because it
would provide the necessary two
thirds vote, but because of Ar
gentina’s prestige position as one
of the three largest Latin Ameri
can countries.
