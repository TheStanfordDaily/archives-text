invites you to discuss opportunities in the new era of Space
Technology with members of STL’s technical staff when they
visit your campus on
FEBRUARY 1 & 2
TODAY Space Technology Laboratories, Inc. is engaged in a balanced program of diversification
and planned growth.
PROGRAMS. Research, development, design, and construction of three Orbiting Geophysical
Observatories (OGO), and project coordination and systems planning for Project Relay, both for
NASA. Design, fabrication and test for the Air Force-ARPA VELA HOTEL Program to detect
nuclear explosions in space. Studies for the Air Force-ARPA BAMBI Project, a multi-satellite sys
tem which can identify and destroy enemy ICBM’s shortly after launch. Systems engineering and
technical direction of the Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman weapon systems for the Air Force. Original
and applied research in a broad spectrum of technical disciplines: particle physics, solid state
theory, guidance, space physics, communication theory, propulsion and power, and electromagnetic
systems in the infrared, ultraviolet and microwave regions.
FACILITIES. Nearing completion on a 110-acre site at Redondo Beach, close to Los Angeles
International Airport, is the STL Space Technology Center comprising ten buildings specially
designed for research and development in missile and space systems, for the fabrication and envi
ronmental test of subsystems and components, and for the production of scientific and technical
devices derived from STL’s sustained research program
