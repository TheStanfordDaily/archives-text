Learning never stops for engineers at Western Electric
There's no place at Western Electric for engi
neers who feel that college diplomas signify
the end of their education. However, if a man
can meet our quality standards and feels that
he is really just beginning to learn ... and if lie
is ready to launch his career where learning is
an important part of the job and where gradu
ate-level training on and off the job is encour
aged we want and need him.
At Western Electric, in addition to the nor
mal learning-while-doing, engineers are en
couraged to move ahead in their fields by sever
al types of educational programs. Western
maintains its own full-time graduate engineer
ing training program, seven formal manage
ment courses, and a tuition refund plan for
out-of-hours college study.
This learning atmosphere is just one reason
why a career at Western Electric is so stimu
lating. (>1 equal importance, however, is the
nature of the work we do. Our new engineers
are taking part in projects that implement the
whole art of modern telephony, from high
speed sound transmission and solar cells to
electronic telephone offices and computer-con
trolled production techniques.

as the communications needs of our nation and
the world continue to increase.
