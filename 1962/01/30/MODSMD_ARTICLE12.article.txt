# Radical Right Needs To Be Examined
## 
### 
A program of note will take place in San Francisco this Saturday
when a group of leaders from Bay Area schools, unions, business
and churches gathers to examine the radical right—its causes, mem
bers and effect on this nation.
The all-day program will come the day after Dr. Fred Schwarz
folds up his tent and moves his travelling anti-communism school
to another part of the Union. The San Francisco program should
provide a refreshing breeze to blow away the layer of hot air which
will be hanging over the Bay Area following the Australian physi
cian’s week-long crusade to save our area from communism.
Schwarz (aptly called “Crusader Rabid” by Herb Caen) is, it
seems to us, a good example of the radical right. He disclaims any
connection with the extreme right, yet anyone who has seen his
anti-communism schools in Southern California or—closer to home
—heard his recent speech to the Redwood City American Legion
members realizes that the Christian anti-Communism Crusade is,
indeed, part of the radical right.
True, Schwarz judged his audience well when he spoke at Stan
ford, and controlled himself. But that performance was an excep
tion—as was what he said. A somewhat truer picture of Schwarz
can be obtained by attending his “school” in Oakland, and hearing
Ills “faculty” speak.
If the past is any guide, one will hear him and his “faculty”
declare that internal communism is a dire threat (ignoring what
the U.S. attorney general has said in opposition), that British Guiana
has already gone Communist, and that we must beware of liberals
and their welfare ideas—for this way lies socialism and, therefore,
communism.
It seems to us that Schwarz and the other organizations on the
far right have too little faith in the citizens of the United States.
The conditions for an internal takeover by homegrown Reds simply
do not exist. One needs dissatisfied masses to get a hold on the
people—and we haven t noticed any dissatisfied masses lately. We
have noticed a prosperous, affluent nation still dedicated to freedom.
I rue, this nation does have a host of problems—many stemming
from its incredible abundance—but we fail to see how an intelligent
person can believe there is a significant threat from internal com
munism in this nation, a major point preferred by the right.
Instead, we would agree with President Kennedy that the danger
to the United States and free men everywhere can be seen by look
ing in the direction of the Kremlin-and its outposts all over the
globe. This is where the fight with communism will be fought and
won or lost. This is where the nation must direct its energies—
outside our boundaries, not inside.
Those who would stir up internal dissension and use the guise
of fighting communism to attack such things as taxes, Social Secur
ity the United Nations and other “liberal” institutions need to be
examined seriously and intelligently. We presume the program
Saturday will do this.

from its incredible abundance—but we fail to see how an intelligent
person can believe there is a significant threat from internal com
munism in this nation, a major point preferred by the right.
Instead, we would agree with President Kennedy that the danger
to the United States and free men everywhere can be seen by look
ing in the direction of the Kremlin-and its outposts all over the
globe. This is where the fight with communism will be fought and
won or lost. This is where the nation must direct its energies—
outside our boundaries, not inside.
Those who would stir up internal dissension and use the guise
of fighting communism to attack such things as taxes, Social Secur
ity the United Nations and other “liberal” institutions need to be
examined seriously and intelligently. We presume the program
Saturday will do this.
A program of note will take place in San Francisco this Saturday
when a group of leaders from Bay Area schools, unions, business
and churches gathers to examine the radical right—its causes, mem
bers and effect on this nation.
The all-day program will come the day after Dr. Fred Schwarz
folds up his tent and moves his travelling anti-communism school
to another part of the Union. The San Francisco program should
provide a refreshing breeze to blow away the layer of hot air which
will be hanging over the Bay Area following the Australian physi
cian’s week-long crusade to save our area from communism.
Schwarz (aptly called “Crusader Rabid” by Herb Caen) is, it
seems to us, a good example of the radical right. He disclaims any
connection with the extreme right, yet anyone who has seen his
anti-communism schools in Southern California or—closer to home
—heard his recent speech to the Redwood City American Legion
members realizes that the Christian anti-Communism Crusade is,
indeed, part of the radical right.
True, Schwarz judged his audience well when he spoke at Stan
ford, and controlled himself. But that performance was an excep
tion—as was what he said. A somewhat truer picture of Schwarz
can be obtained by attending his “school” in Oakland, and hearing
Ills “faculty” speak.
If the past is any guide, one will hear him and his “faculty”
declare that internal communism is a dire threat (ignoring what
the U.S. attorney general has said in opposition), that British Guiana
has already gone Communist, and that we must beware of liberals
and their welfare ideas—for this way lies socialism and, therefore,
communism.
It seems to us that Schwarz and the other organizations on the
far right have too little faith in the citizens of the United States.
The conditions for an internal takeover by homegrown Reds simply
do not exist. One needs dissatisfied masses to get a hold on the
people—and we haven t noticed any dissatisfied masses lately. We
have noticed a prosperous, affluent nation still dedicated to freedom.
I rue, this nation does have a host of problems—many stemming
from its incredible abundance—but we fail to see how an intelligent
person can believe there is a significant threat from internal com
munism in this nation, a major point preferred by the right.
