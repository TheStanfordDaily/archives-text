## JFK's Civil Defense Program Faces Tough Going in House 
### DAVID BURNHAM 
WASHINGTON (UPD—A pow
erful and sharply critical foe of
civil defense will play a major
role in Congress’ response to
President Kennedy’s recommen
dation that Americans should
have a measure of protection
against the peril of nuclear war.
He is Rep. Albert Thomas, 64-
year-old Texas Democrat, who is
chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee which will recom
mend to Congress how much of
the President’s $695 million plan
should be put into action.
Though Thomas and his sub
committee can be overruled, their
opinion has carried great weight
in the past.
ASKED TO COMMENT on civil
defense, the soft spoken Texan
told United Press International he
would stand by his record.
His record is one of steady hos
tility. During the seven years his
subcommittee handled civil de
fense money matters, the White
House requested $7OO million.
Congress gave the White House
$417 million.
“In my humble opinion, it’s just
money thrown away,” Thomas
told the House last June while
debating a $1.2 million shelter re
quest.
EAST YEAR, when a large part
of the President’s civil defense
money request was handled by
the defense appropriations sub
committee, practically all of it
was approved by Congress.
But this year, control of the
program has reverted to Thomas
and his independent offices sub
committee.

While the President can look
forward to a sharp attack from
the Texas lawmaker because his
program is too large, he also faces
congressional criticism because it
is too small.
Rep. Chet Holifield, D-Calif., a
long time supporter of a five year
$2O billion national shelter plan,
said in an interview his govern
ment operations subcommittee
will begin hearings on the Presi
dent’s recommendation in three
weeks.
HOLIFIELD ALSO DISCLOS
ED that the hearings had been set
for Feb. 19 because Defense De
partment officials had told him
their national survey of shelter
spaces in existing buildings would
be completed by that time.
He also said the Pentagon plan
ners would be questioned about
the department’s recently issued
pamphlet on how the average
American family can protect it
self against fallout.
In addition to the hearings
scheduled by the appropriations
and House government operations
subcommittees, Kennedy’s recom
mendation will also be considered
by the House Armed Services
Committee.
BECAUSE the program is a
new one—calling for the granting
of matching funds for the con
struction of shelters in schools
and other public buildings—a new
authorizing law will have to be
approved by the Armed Services
Committee and Congress.
A spokesman said the commit
tee probably would not be able to
hold hearings on the new civil
defense legislation until the end
of February or later.

money thrown away,” Thomas
told the House last June while
debating a $1.2 million shelter re
quest.
EAST YEAR, when a large part
of the President’s civil defense
money request was handled by
the defense appropriations sub
committee, practically all of it
was approved by Congress.
But this year, control of the
program has reverted to Thomas
and his independent offices sub
committee.

While the President can look
forward to a sharp attack from
the Texas lawmaker because his
program is too large, he also faces
congressional criticism because it
is too small.
Rep. Chet Holifield, D-Calif., a
long time supporter of a five year
$2O billion national shelter plan,
said in an interview his govern
ment operations subcommittee
will begin hearings on the Presi
dent’s recommendation in three
weeks.
HOLIFIELD ALSO DISCLOS
ED that the hearings had been set
for Feb. 19 because Defense De
partment officials had told him
their national survey of shelter
spaces in existing buildings would
be completed by that time.
He also said the Pentagon plan
ners would be questioned about
the department’s recently issued
pamphlet on how the average
American family can protect it
self against fallout.
In addition to the hearings
scheduled by the appropriations
and House government operations
subcommittees, Kennedy’s recom
mendation will also be considered
by the House Armed Services
Committee.
BECAUSE the program is a
new one—calling for the granting
of matching funds for the con
struction of shelters in schools
and other public buildings—a new
authorizing law will have to be
approved by the Armed Services
Committee and Congress.
A spokesman said the commit
tee probably would not be able to
hold hearings on the new civil
defense legislation until the end
of February or later.
WASHINGTON (UPD—A pow
erful and sharply critical foe of
civil defense will play a major
role in Congress’ response to
President Kennedy’s recommen
dation that Americans should
have a measure of protection
against the peril of nuclear war.
He is Rep. Albert Thomas, 64-
year-old Texas Democrat, who is
chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee which will recom
mend to Congress how much of
the President’s $695 million plan
should be put into action.
Though Thomas and his sub
committee can be overruled, their
opinion has carried great weight
in the past.
ASKED TO COMMENT on civil
defense, the soft spoken Texan
told United Press International he
would stand by his record.
His record is one of steady hos
tility. During the seven years his
subcommittee handled civil de
fense money matters, the White
House requested $7OO million.
Congress gave the White House
$417 million.
“In my humble opinion, it’s just
money thrown away,” Thomas
told the House last June while
debating a $1.2 million shelter re
quest.
