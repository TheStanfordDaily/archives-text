# Student Committee Reviews Stanford English Department

### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: As de
scribed in an article in yester
day's Daily, a subcommittee of
tlit* student Committee on Aca
demic Affairs lias begun a pro
gram of intelligent criticism of
Stanford departments.
Under the plan, students in a
particular department will get
together and discuss the depart
ment as a whole, its courses and
its faculty. Both good and had
IHiints will lie examined, and sug
gestions for improvement will he
offered. Only those students in
tlie department under discussion
will engage in the criticism.
I’art of the program will con
sist of regular articles in The
Daily, written by memliers of the
Subcommittee on Academic Re
view from the criticism by the*
students of the department.
Today’s is the* first article in
the series.)

Stanford’s English Department
is both stagnant and uninspiring,
yet it is hardly beyond repair.
Every English major, whether he
be in the sub-departments of Eng
lish Literature, American Liter
ature, or Creative Writing, is re
quired to take several survey
courses that occupy most of his
lime and the greater percentage
of his unit requirements. These
courses in particular represent
the real evils of the department,
yet few of the electives offered
are free from the same criticisms,
for almost all suffer from a tre
mendous lack of vitality.
The teachers themselves seem
to be bored, and even though
some profess dissatisfaction with
their role in the department, they
neither provide the inter-faculty
criticism necessary for progres
sive reforms, nor do they invigor
ate their own material. Youth is
lacking in the department: either
young ideas or young interested
and interesting professors. This
lack of “youth” is manifested first
in courses that are rehashed from
unrevised notes year after year,
and from the specific example of
one professor, who made it sound
as if he wore doing his class a big
favor by treating a new source
for the first time in years, and
thereby opening the course to
some new thinking. Yet even with
this condescending effort, this

academic “half step,” this course
and many others still fail (o re
alize their potential.
CERTAINLY ALL THE re
quired courses, and a great part
of the electives are packed with
anywhere from 50 to 200 students,
thereby eliminating class partici
pation and discussion. Even more
remarkable, there are few, if any
seminars to compensate for the
impersonality of the lecture hall,
for English Literature at Stanford
is taught by lectures and not by
discussion. Moreover the potenti
ally vitalizing effect of infusing
modern literature into the curric
ulum has not been considered, a
fact that is glaringly brought
home when one realizes that a
course in twentieth century Eng
lish novel does not satisfy an elec
tive requirement for the English
Literature major, and that out of
54 literature courses offered this
year, only 5 deal with contempor
ary work.

There is some solace for the
prospective English major, which
unfortunately is not included in
either the English or American
Literature majors. It is in tin* cre
ative writing department, in
which the student must still lake
the courses required for all Eng
lish majors, but where the sins of
the department as a whole are al
leviated by the several factors
that help emasculate the litera
ture department. The student in
creative writing is offered small
classes, in-class criticism and dis
cussion, young, interested and in
teresting faculty, the daily chal
lenge of his own creativity, and
subjects like aesthetics, style, and
the function and validity of liter
ature. Yet the Creative Writing
Department is an exception rath
er than a model for the English

Department at large.
It is comparatively easy to list
obvious deficiencies; it is another,
more difficult thing to suggest
the causes behind them. Wo offer
however, one solution to the ques
tion: the stagnation of the Eng
lish Department stems from two
traditions, neither of which is
healthy.
FIKST, IT HAS long relied on
old and inflexible standards of
teaching: that is, lectures rather
than discussions, and on profes
sors who, despite their eminent
scholastic ability, are uninterest
ing teachers and poor revision
ists. The second tradition goes
even deeper than the first, and
may in part explain it: the very
position held by the department
on what is the study of English
Literature. Literature, as a collec
tion of ideas and impressions in
an aesthetic form, knows no
truths, no rigid formulae, no
right or wrong, offering the stu
dent layer upon layer of interpre
tation and endless room for intro
spection and debate. These prop
erties make (he discussion of lit
erature not only a fascinating and
rewarding mental exercise hut a
practical necessity. The depart
ment chooses to treat literature
in terms of its history, which is a
valid position only if it is comple
mented by the all-important em
phasis on the ideas embodied in
literature itself. At present the
department offers primarily large
classes in which the student reads
various works of art, yet has no
opportunity to treat the works of
art as art itself, no means of
treating literature in respect to
its ideas as well as its historical
context. Were the department to
place more emphasis on the dy
namics of literature, the seminar
classes proposed in this criticism
would be doubly rewarding. So
far only the small creative writ
ing classes have been able to sup
ply this complement, and it is
only they that escape the double
tradition that has stagnated the
entirety of the department.

Stanford’s English Department
is both stagnant and uninspiring,
yet it is hardly beyond repair.
Every English major, whether he
be in the sub-departments of Eng
lish Literature, American Liter
ature, or Creative Writing, is re
quired to take several survey
courses that occupy most of his
lime and the greater percentage
of his unit requirements. These
courses in particular represent
the real evils of the department,
yet few of the electives offered
are free from the same criticisms,
for almost all suffer from a tre
mendous lack of vitality.
The teachers themselves seem
to be bored, and even though
some profess dissatisfaction with
their role in the department, they
neither provide the inter-faculty
criticism necessary for progres
sive reforms, nor do they invigor
ate their own material. Youth is
lacking in the department: either
young ideas or young interested
and interesting professors. This
lack of “youth” is manifested first
in courses that are rehashed from
unrevised notes year after year,
and from the specific example of
one professor, who made it sound
as if he wore doing his class a big
favor by treating a new source
for the first time in years, and
thereby opening the course to
some new thinking. Yet even with
this condescending effort, this

academic “half step,” this course
and many others still fail (o re
alize their potential.
CERTAINLY ALL THE re
quired courses, and a great part
of the electives are packed with
anywhere from 50 to 200 students,
thereby eliminating class partici
pation and discussion. Even more
remarkable, there are few, if any
seminars to compensate for the
impersonality of the lecture hall,
for English Literature at Stanford
is taught by lectures and not by
discussion. Moreover the potenti
ally vitalizing effect of infusing
modern literature into the curric
ulum has not been considered, a
fact that is glaringly brought
home when one realizes that a
course in twentieth century Eng
lish novel does not satisfy an elec
tive requirement for the English
Literature major, and that out of
54 literature courses offered this
year, only 5 deal with contempor
ary work.

There is some solace for the
prospective English major, which
unfortunately is not included in
either the English or American
Literature majors. It is in tin* cre
ative writing department, in
which the student must still lake
the courses required for all Eng
lish majors, but where the sins of
the department as a whole are al
leviated by the several factors
that help emasculate the litera
ture department. The student in
creative writing is offered small
classes, in-class criticism and dis
cussion, young, interested and in
teresting faculty, the daily chal
lenge of his own creativity, and
subjects like aesthetics, style, and
the function and validity of liter
ature. Yet the Creative Writing

the department as a whole are al

even deeper than the first, and
may in part explain it: the very
position held by the department
on what is the study of English
Literature. Literature, as a collec
tion of ideas and impressions in
an aesthetic form, knows no
truths, no rigid formulae, no
right or wrong, offering the stu
dent layer upon layer of interpre
tation and endless room for intro
spection and debate. These prop
erties make (he discussion of lit
erature not only a fascinating and
rewarding mental exercise hut a
practical necessity. The depart
ment chooses to treat literature
in terms of its history, which is a
valid position only if it is comple
mented by the all-important em
phasis on the ideas embodied in
literature itself. At present the
department offers primarily large
classes in which the student reads
various works of art, yet has no
opportunity to treat the works of
art as art itself, no means of
treating literature in respect to
its ideas as well as its historical
context. Were the department to
place more emphasis on the dy
namics of literature, the seminar
classes proposed in this criticism
would be doubly rewarding. So
far only the small creative writ

Stanford’s English Department
is both stagnant and uninspiring,
yet it is hardly beyond repair.
Every English major, whether he
be in the sub-departments of Eng
lish Literature, American Liter
ature, or Creative Writing, is re
quired to take several survey
courses that occupy most of his
lime and the greater percentage
of his unit requirements. These
courses in particular represent
the real evils of the department,
yet few of the electives offered
are free from the same criticisms,
for almost all suffer from a tre
mendous lack of vitality.
The teachers themselves seem
to be bored, and even though
some profess dissatisfaction with
their role in the department, they
neither provide the inter-faculty
criticism necessary for progres
sive reforms, nor do they invigor
ate their own material. Youth is
lacking in the department: either
young ideas or young interested
and interesting professors. This
lack of “youth” is manifested first
in courses that are rehashed from
unrevised notes year after year,
and from the specific example of
