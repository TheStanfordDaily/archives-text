# CAMPUS OPINION
## Krauskopf Replies to Schlacks 
### KONRAD B. KRAUSKOPF Professor of Geology 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow
ing: article wax submitted to The
Daily by Prof, Krauskopf in reply
to a recent Campus Opinion ar
ticle by Prof. Charles Schlacks,
who teaches Western Civiliza
tion.)

Dr. Schlacks, in a recent article
in The Daily, has questioned some
of the conclusions about Russian
attitudes that I recorded in the
winter issue of Stanford Today.
One of the points I had tried to
make was that the Russian scien
tists 1 met on a visit to the Soviet
Union last March did not fit the
familiar American stereotype of
Soviet citizens as basically un
happy, cowering under the terror
ism and restrictions of an oppres
sive dictatorship, ready to flee to
the West at the first opportunity.
Dr. Schlacks feels that this im
pression is mistaken, basing his
argument largely on extensive
quotations from an article in This
Week magazine by Dr. Mikhail
A. Klochko, a Russian chemist
who defected to Canada a few
weeks ago. Dr. Klochko stoutly
maintains that the American
stereotype of his erstwhile fellow
citizens is correct in all details.
This is a difficult point to ar
gue, but a very inportant one. If
the Russians are as dissatisfied
with communism as Dr. Klochko
and Dr. Schlacks maintain, then
life for us is simple: the Soviet
empire can have little inner
strength, and wc need only bide
our time until it falls apart from
lack of support by its people. If,
however, the Russians are as con
tented with their lot and as dedi
cated to communism as I found
them to be. then the world is
much more complicated, because
our continuing struggle with the
Soviet system will involve a bit
ter conflict of ideas as well as
competition in industrial produc
tion and military preparedness. I
wish very sincerely that I knew
which of these alternatives is
nearer the truth. The thing that
frightens me is that we in Ameri
ca so uncritically accept the first
alternative, the easy, comforting,
black-and-white alternative, when
everything I saw in Russia cries
out to the contrary.
ALL I HAVE TO BACK my

opinions is the vivid memory of
23 days of earnest talk with Rus
sians from one walk of life, plus
more casual contacts with the
man-in-the-street in four Russian
cities. This is an altogether in
adequate basis from which to
draw sweeping conclusions about
Russians in general and I have
tried assiduously to confine my
remarks to the scientific group
with which I became well ac
quainted). Small though the group
may be, its opinions seemed to me
noteworthy because they were so
different from what I had been
led to expect. Were the opinions
these scientists expressed their
real opinions? Was I the victim
of an elaborate propaganda
scheme, planned to confuse a gul
lible college professor—as some
of my recent correspondence has
suggested? Of course I do not
know. I can give only the conclu
sions that in my best judgment
seem most reasonable, and that
have been checked in every way I
can think of. If Dr, Schlacks pre
fers to question my judgment,
this is, of course, his privilege.
On his side of the argument
we have the testimony of Dr.
Klochko. This gentleman, in the
first of three articles in This
Week, explains how he came to be
at odds with Stalin’s regime, how
he lived for years in terror of im
prisonment or liquidation, and
how he nursed his grievances
through a life of solitude in more
recent years while he laid plans
for escape.

A MAN WITH THIS history
would hardly retain much enthu
siasm for the Soviet government.
I am not questioning his integri
ty, nor doubting the justice of his
complaints: I merely point out
that he would inevitably paint the
Communist system in the black
est possible colors. Doubtless
there are other Dr. Klochkos in
Russia, who have spent much of
their life under, suspicion for one
reason or another, and who would
welcome an opportunity to es
cape. Doubtless also there is oc
casional annoyance with short
ages of goods and stupid burreau
cracy, as the examples of wry
Russian humor quoted by Dr.
Schlacks so pointedly attest. I do
not see that either statement is
necessarily inconsistent with a

widespread feeling among scien
tists of general satisfaction with
their life under the Communist
government. After all, we need
not look far to find chronic mal
contents in the United States, and
we are all familiar with salty
American humor based on tempo
rary shortages and governmental
obtuseness.
Is it unfair in this argument to
hint that Dr. Klochko was almost
certainly aided in preparing his
articles by an American writer
well acquainted with the sort of
thing that Americans like to read
about Russia of a Sunday after
noon? That the articles are set
forth with all the tired old catch
words and lurid pictures that
seem necessary to this kind of
propaganda? That everything is
expressed in the usual black-and
white terminology America is
altogether wondeful, Russia is al
together terrible? That This Week
is distributed as a supplement to
the most conservative newspaper
in San Francisco?
Dr. Klochko’s story would be
more impressive if 1 had not read
exactly the same kind of propa
ganda stories from the opposite
side of the fence in Russian news
papers last March. I remember
one in particular, about an Ameri
can family which had fled to Rus
sia because the father could not
find work here, decorated with
heartrending pictures of bread
lines in Detroit and full of
phrases calculated to convince a
Russian reader that America was
on the verge of collapse because
of discontent over unemployment.

HR. SCHLACKS BOLSTERS
his picture of Russian unhappi
ness by citing “facts” about alco
holism and juvenile crime. Hete
I have no statistics to refute him,
only observations from much
wandering on foot through Rus
sian cities. Certainly the effects
of alcoholism and juvenile delin
quency are no more publicly evi
dent than they are here al
though I was told by several of
my Russian friends that these are
indeed serious problems, just as
they are in America.
As a capstone to his argument,
Dr. Schlacks mentions the mil
lions of Russians and Germans
who have fled the Communist re
gime. Regarding the Germans his
figure is not exaggerated, but
Germany is a special case. Here
communism is being forcibly im
posed on a country which has
long enjoyed a high standard of
living under Western capitalism,
and in such a situation the ugli
ness of communism is particular
ly evident. The evil is compound
ed by the fact that the Russians
hate and fear Germany, and will
do all in their power to keep the
country divided and weak. Small
wonder that three million Ger
mans have escaped to the West.
But I would like to see Dr.
Schlacks’ proof that “millions” of
Russians have escaped in recent
years. It seems to me that a strik
ing fact of the last decade is rath
er the extreme scarcity of Rus
sian defectors. Groups of Rus
sians have been visiting the West
in ever-increasing numbers, but
only a handful of them have used
the opportunity to desert. And of
course every isolated defection
has been given the same extrava
gant play by the Western press
that we see now in the Klochko
incident.

BECAUSE I THINK that the
mood of the Russian people is ex
tremely important for us to
know, and because I set no groat
store by my own limited observa
tions, I have gone to some trouble
to compare notes with others who
have visited the Soviet Union re

cently. The reactions cover the
whole spectrum, but fully 90 per
cent of those I have talked to or
corresponded with tell me that
their impressions were much the
same as mine.

I would call Dr. Schlacks’ atten
tion particularly to an article by
a Cornell psychologist. Dr. Urie
Bronfenbrenner, in a recent num
ber of the Journal of Social Is
sues (volume 17, number 3). Dr.
Bronfenbrenner reports impres
sions practically identical with
mine, but his statements should
carry greater weight because he
speaks Russian fluently and could
talk with people of all classes, and
because as a psychologist he was
in a better position to interpret
and evaluate what he saw. One
remark is especially revealing:
Dr. Bronfenbrenner asked Ameri
can embassy officials and journal
ists why the enthusiasm and com
mitment to communism that he
had found among the Russian
people was never reported back to
America, and one reporter an
swered, “Sure, I know, but when
a Communist acts like a Commu
nist it isn’t news. If I want to be
sure that it will be printed back
home, I have to write about
what’s wrong with the system,
not its successes.”

FOB AS long as I can remem
ber (and I think my memory goes
back considerably further than
Dr. Schlacks’) I have listened to
would-be Russian experts de

scribe the unhappiness and smol
dering resentment within the So
viet Union. And yet Communist
Russia, despite monstrous mis
takes of its government, has
grown steadily more prosperous;
it has fought a devastating war
and emerged stronger than ever;
and under its influence commu
nism has spread to one part of
the world after another. This does
not impress me as the work of a
sullen, unwilling populace. It
seems a reasonable inference,
however unpalatable it may be,
that communism has a genuine
appeal to a large number of peo
ple. Might it not be more realistic
if we would accept this and try
to understand wherein the appeal
lies, so that we can combat it,
rather than hide our heads in the
sand and try to pretend that the
appeal does not exist?

frightens me is that we in Ameri
ca so uncritically accept the first
alternative, the easy, comforting,
black-and-white alternative, when
everything I saw in Russia cries
out to the contrary.
ALL I HAVE TO BACK my

opinions is the vivid memory of
23 days of earnest talk with Rus
sians from one walk of life, plus
more casual contacts with the
man-in-the-street in four Russian
cities. This is an altogether in
adequate basis from which to
draw sweeping conclusions about
Russians in general and I have
tried assiduously to confine my
remarks to the scientific group
with which I became well ac
quainted). Small though the group
may be, its opinions seemed to me
noteworthy because they were so
different from what I had been
led to expect. Were the opinions
these scientists expressed their
real opinions? Was I the victim
of an elaborate propaganda
scheme, planned to confuse a gul
lible college professor—as some
of my recent correspondence has
suggested? Of course I do not
know. I can give only the conclu
sions that in my best judgment
seem most reasonable, and that
have been checked in every way I
can think of. If Dr, Schlacks pre
fers to question my judgment,
this is, of course, his privilege.
On his side of the argument
we have the testimony of Dr.
Klochko. This gentleman, in the
first of three articles in This
Week, explains how he came to be
at odds with Stalin’s regime, how
he lived for years in terror of im
prisonment or liquidation, and
how he nursed his grievances
through a life of solitude in more
recent years while he laid plans
for escape.

A MAN WITH THIS history
would hardly retain much enthu
siasm for the Soviet government.
I am not questioning his integri
ty, nor doubting the justice of his
complaints: I merely point out
that he would inevitably paint the
Communist system in the black
est possible colors. Doubtless
there are other Dr. Klochkos in
Russia, who have spent much of
their life under, suspicion for one
reason or another, and who would
welcome an opportunity to es
cape. Doubtless also there is oc
casional annoyance with short
ages of goods and stupid burreau
cracy, as the examples of wry
Russian humor quoted by Dr.
Schlacks so pointedly attest. I do
not see that either statement is
necessarily inconsistent with a

widespread feeling among scien
tists of general satisfaction with
their life under the Communist
government. After all, we need
not look far to find chronic mal
contents in the United States, and
we are all familiar with salty
American humor based on tempo
rary shortages and governmental
obtuseness.
Is it unfair in this argument to
hint that Dr. Klochko was almost
certainly aided in preparing his
articles by an American writer
well acquainted with the sort of
thing that Americans like to read
about Russia of a Sunday after
noon? That the articles are set
forth with all the tired old catch
words and lurid pictures that
seem necessary to this kind of
propaganda? That everything is
expressed in the usual black-and
white terminology America is
altogether wondeful, Russia is al
together terrible? That This Week
is distributed as a supplement to
the most conservative newspaper
in San Francisco?
Dr. Klochko’s story would be
more impressive if 1 had not read
exactly the same kind of propa
ganda stories from the opposite
side of the fence in Russian news
papers last March. I remember
one in particular, about an Ameri
can family which had fled to Rus
sia because the father could not
find work here, decorated with
heartrending pictures of bread
lines in Detroit and full of
phrases calculated to convince a
Russian reader that America was
on the verge of collapse because
of discontent over unemployment.

HR. SCHLACKS BOLSTERS
his picture of Russian unhappi
ness by citing “facts” about alco
holism and juvenile crime. Hete
I have no statistics to refute him,
only observations from much
wandering on foot through Rus
sian cities. Certainly the effects
of alcoholism and juvenile delin
quency are no more publicly evi
dent than they are here al
though I was told by several of
my Russian friends that these are
indeed serious problems, just as
they are in America.
As a capstone to his argument,
Dr. Schlacks mentions the mil
lions of Russians and Germans
who have fled the Communist re
gime. Regarding the Germans his
figure is not exaggerated, but
Germany is a special case. Here
communism is being forcibly im
posed on a country which has
long enjoyed a high standard of
living under Western capitalism,
and in such a situation the ugli
ness of communism is particular
ly evident. The evil is compound
ed by the fact that the Russians
hate and fear Germany, and will
do all in their power to keep the
country divided and weak. Small
wonder that three million Ger
mans have escaped to the West.
But I would like to see Dr.
Schlacks’ proof that “millions” of
Russians have escaped in recent
years. It seems to me that a strik
ing fact of the last decade is rath
er the extreme scarcity of Rus
sian defectors. Groups of Rus
sians have been visiting the West
in ever-increasing numbers, but
only a handful of them have used
the opportunity to desert. And of
course every isolated defection
has been given the same extrava
gant play by the Western press
that we see now in the Klochko
incident.

BECAUSE I THINK that the
mood of the Russian people is ex
tremely important for us to
know, and because I set no groat
store by my own limited observa
tions, I have gone to some trouble
to compare notes with others who
have visited the Soviet Union re

cently. The reactions cover the
whole spectrum, but fully 90 per
cent of those I have talked to or
corresponded with tell me that
their impressions were much the
same as mine.

I would call Dr. Schlacks’ atten
tion particularly to an article by
a Cornell psychologist. Dr. Urie
Bronfenbrenner, in a recent num
ber of the Journal of Social Is
sues (volume 17, number 3). Dr.
Bronfenbrenner reports impres
sions practically identical with
mine, but his statements should
carry greater weight because he
speaks Russian fluently and could
talk with people of all classes, and
because as a psychologist he was
in a better position to interpret
and evaluate what he saw. One
remark is especially revealing:
Dr. Bronfenbrenner asked Ameri
can embassy officials and journal
ists why the enthusiasm and com
mitment to communism that he
had found among the Russian
people was never reported back to
America, and one reporter an
swered, “Sure, I know, but when
a Communist acts like a Commu
nist it isn’t news. If I want to be
sure that it will be printed back
home, I have to write about
what’s wrong with the system,
not its successes.”

FOB AS long as I can remem
ber (and I think my memory goes
back considerably further than
Dr. Schlacks’) I have listened to
would-be Russian experts de

scribe the unhappiness and smol
dering resentment within the So
viet Union. And yet Communist
Russia, despite monstrous mis
takes of its government, has
grown steadily more prosperous;
it has fought a devastating war
and emerged stronger than ever;
and under its influence commu
nism has spread to one part of
the world after another. This does
not impress me as the work of a
sullen, unwilling populace. It
seems a reasonable inference,
however unpalatable it may be,
that communism has a genuine
appeal to a large number of peo
ple. Might it not be more realistic
if we would accept this and try
to understand wherein the appeal
lies, so that we can combat it,
rather than hide our heads in the
sand and try to pretend that the
appeal does not exist?
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow
ing: article wax submitted to The
Daily by Prof, Krauskopf in reply
to a recent Campus Opinion ar
ticle by Prof. Charles Schlacks,
who teaches Western Civiliza
tion.)

Dr. Schlacks, in a recent article
in The Daily, has questioned some
of the conclusions about Russian
attitudes that I recorded in the
winter issue of Stanford Today.
One of the points I had tried to
make was that the Russian scien
tists 1 met on a visit to the Soviet
Union last March did not fit the
familiar American stereotype of
Soviet citizens as basically un
happy, cowering under the terror
ism and restrictions of an oppres
sive dictatorship, ready to flee to
the West at the first opportunity.
Dr. Schlacks feels that this im
pression is mistaken, basing his
argument largely on extensive
quotations from an article in This
Week magazine by Dr. Mikhail
A. Klochko, a Russian chemist
who defected to Canada a few
weeks ago. Dr. Klochko stoutly
maintains that the American
stereotype of his erstwhile fellow
citizens is correct in all details.
This is a difficult point to ar
gue, but a very inportant one. If
the Russians are as dissatisfied
with communism as Dr. Klochko
and Dr. Schlacks maintain, then
life for us is simple: the Soviet
empire can have little inner
strength, and wc need only bide
our time until it falls apart from
lack of support by its people. If,
however, the Russians are as con
tented with their lot and as dedi
cated to communism as I found
them to be. then the world is
much more complicated, because
our continuing struggle with the
Soviet system will involve a bit
ter conflict of ideas as well as
competition in industrial produc
tion and military preparedness. I
wish very sincerely that I knew
which of these alternatives is
nearer the truth. The thing that
frightens me is that we in Ameri
ca so uncritically accept the first
alternative, the easy, comforting,
black-and-white alternative, when
everything I saw in Russia cries

there are other Dr. Klochkos in
Russia, who have spent much of
their life under, suspicion for one
reason or another, and who would
welcome an opportunity to es
cape. Doubtless also there is oc
casional annoyance with short
ages of goods and stupid burreau
cracy, as the examples of wry
Russian humor quoted by Dr.
Schlacks so pointedly attest. I do
not see that either statement is
necessarily inconsistent with a

widespread feeling among scien
tists of general satisfaction with
their life under the Communist
government. After all, we need
not look far to find chronic mal
contents in the United States, and
we are all familiar with salty
American humor based on tempo
rary shortages and governmental
obtuseness.
Is it unfair in this argument to
hint that Dr. Klochko was almost
certainly aided in preparing his
articles by an American writer
well acquainted with the sort of
thing that Americans like to read
about Russia of a Sunday after
noon? That the articles are set
forth with all the tired old catch
words and lurid pictures that
seem necessary to this kind of
propaganda? That everything is
expressed in the usual black-and
white terminology America is
altogether wondeful, Russia is al
together terrible? That This Week
is distributed as a supplement to
the most conservative newspaper
in San Francisco?
Dr. Klochko’s story would be
more impressive if 1 had not read
exactly the same kind of propa
ganda stories from the opposite
side of the fence in Russian news
papers last March. I remember
one in particular, about an Ameri
can family which had fled to Rus
sia because the father could not
find work here, decorated with
heartrending pictures of bread
lines in Detroit and full of
phrases calculated to convince a
Russian reader that America was
on the verge of collapse because
of discontent over unemployment.

HR. SCHLACKS BOLSTERS
his picture of Russian unhappi
ness by citing “facts” about alco
holism and juvenile crime. Hete
I have no statistics to refute him,
only observations from much
wandering on foot through Rus
sian cities. Certainly the effects
of alcoholism and juvenile delin
quency are no more publicly evi
dent than they are here al
though I was told by several of
my Russian friends that these are
indeed serious problems, just as
they are in America.
As a capstone to his argument,
Dr. Schlacks mentions the mil
lions of Russians and Germans
who have fled the Communist re
gime. Regarding the Germans his
figure is not exaggerated, but
Germany is a special case. Here
communism is being forcibly im
posed on a country which has
long enjoyed a high standard of
living under Western capitalism,
and in such a situation the ugli
ness of communism is particular
ly evident. The evil is compound
ed by the fact that the Russians
hate and fear Germany, and will
do all in their power to keep the
country divided and weak. Small
wonder that three million Ger
mans have escaped to the West.
But I would like to see Dr.
Schlacks’ proof that “millions” of
Russians have escaped in recent
years. It seems to me that a strik
ing fact of the last decade is rath
er the extreme scarcity of Rus
sian defectors. Groups of Rus
sians have been visiting the West
in ever-increasing numbers, but
only a handful of them have used
the opportunity to desert. And of
course every isolated defection
has been given the same extrava
gant play by the Western press
that we see now in the Klochko
incident.

BECAUSE I THINK that the
mood of the Russian people is ex
tremely important for us to
know, and because I set no groat
store by my own limited observa
tions, I have gone to some trouble
to compare notes with others who
have visited the Soviet Union re

cently. The reactions cover the
whole spectrum, but fully 90 per
cent of those I have talked to or
corresponded with tell me that
their impressions were much the
same as mine.

I would call Dr. Schlacks’ atten
tion particularly to an article by
a Cornell psychologist. Dr. Urie
Bronfenbrenner, in a recent num
ber of the Journal of Social Is
sues (volume 17, number 3). Dr.
Bronfenbrenner reports impres
sions practically identical with
mine, but his statements should
carry greater weight because he
speaks Russian fluently and could
talk with people of all classes, and
because as a psychologist he was
in a better position to interpret
and evaluate what he saw. One
remark is especially revealing:
Dr. Bronfenbrenner asked Ameri
can embassy officials and journal
ists why the enthusiasm and com
mitment to communism that he
had found among the Russian
people was never reported back to
America, and one reporter an
swered, “Sure, I know, but when
a Communist acts like a Commu
nist it isn’t news. If I want to be
sure that it will be printed back
home, I have to write about
what’s wrong with the system,
not its successes.”

FOB AS long as I can remem
ber (and I think my memory goes
back considerably further than
Dr. Schlacks’) I have listened to
would-be Russian experts de

scribe the unhappiness and smol
dering resentment within the So
viet Union. And yet Communist
Russia, despite monstrous mis
takes of its government, has
grown steadily more prosperous;
it has fought a devastating war
and emerged stronger than ever;
and under its influence commu
nism has spread to one part of
the world after another. This does
not impress me as the work of a
sullen, unwilling populace. It
seems a reasonable inference,
however unpalatable it may be,
that communism has a genuine
appeal to a large number of peo
ple. Might it not be more realistic
if we would accept this and try
to understand wherein the appeal
lies, so that we can combat it,
rather than hide our heads in the
sand and try to pretend that the
appeal does not exist?
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow
ing: article wax submitted to The
Daily by Prof, Krauskopf in reply
to a recent Campus Opinion ar
ticle by Prof. Charles Schlacks,
who teaches Western Civiliza
tion.)

Dr. Schlacks, in a recent article
in The Daily, has questioned some
of the conclusions about Russian
attitudes that I recorded in the
winter issue of Stanford Today.
One of the points I had tried to
make was that the Russian scien
tists 1 met on a visit to the Soviet
Union last March did not fit the
familiar American stereotype of
Soviet citizens as basically un
happy, cowering under the terror
ism and restrictions of an oppres
sive dictatorship, ready to flee to
the West at the first opportunity.
Dr. Schlacks feels that this im
pression is mistaken, basing his
argument largely on extensive
quotations from an article in This
Week magazine by Dr. Mikhail
A. Klochko, a Russian chemist
who defected to Canada a few
weeks ago. Dr. Klochko stoutly
maintains that the American
stereotype of his erstwhile fellow
citizens is correct in all details.
This is a difficult point to ar
gue, but a very inportant one. If
the Russians are as dissatisfied
with communism as Dr. Klochko
and Dr. Schlacks maintain, then
life for us is simple: the Soviet
empire can have little inner
strength, and wc need only bide
our time until it falls apart from
lack of support by its people. If,
however, the Russians are as con
tented with their lot and as dedi
cated to communism as I found
them to be. then the world is
much more complicated, because
our continuing struggle with the
Soviet system will involve a bit
ter conflict of ideas as well as
competition in industrial produc
tion and military preparedness. I
wish very sincerely that I knew
which of these alternatives is
nearer the truth. The thing that
frightens me is that we in Ameri
ca so uncritically accept the first
alternative, the easy, comforting,
black-and-white alternative, when
everything I saw in Russia cries
out to the contrary.
ALL I HAVE TO BACK my

opinions is the vivid memory of
23 days of earnest talk with Rus
sians from one walk of life, plus
more casual contacts with the
man-in-the-street in four Russian
cities. This is an altogether in
adequate basis from which to
draw sweeping conclusions about
Russians in general and I have
tried assiduously to confine my
remarks to the scientific group
with which I became well ac
quainted). Small though the group
may be, its opinions seemed to me
noteworthy because they were so
different from what I had been
led to expect. Were the opinions
these scientists expressed their
real opinions? Was I the victim
of an elaborate propaganda
scheme, planned to confuse a gul
lible college professor—as some
of my recent correspondence has
suggested? Of course I do not
know. I can give only the conclu
sions that in my best judgment
seem most reasonable, and that
have been checked in every way I
can think of. If Dr, Schlacks pre
fers to question my judgment,
this is, of course, his privilege.
On his side of the argument
we have the testimony of Dr.
Klochko. This gentleman, in the
first of three articles in This
Week, explains how he came to be
at odds with Stalin’s regime, how
he lived for years in terror of im
prisonment or liquidation, and
how he nursed his grievances
through a life of solitude in more
recent years while he laid plans
for escape.

A MAN WITH THIS history
would hardly retain much enthu
siasm for the Soviet government.
I am not questioning his integri
ty, nor doubting the justice of his
complaints: I merely point out
that he would inevitably paint the
Communist system in the black
est possible colors. Doubtless
there are other Dr. Klochkos in
Russia, who have spent much of
their life under, suspicion for one
reason or another, and who would
welcome an opportunity to es

holism and juvenile crime. Hete
I have no statistics to refute him,
only observations from much
wandering on foot through Rus
sian cities. Certainly the effects
of alcoholism and juvenile delin
quency are no more publicly evi
dent than they are here al
though I was told by several of
my Russian friends that these are
indeed serious problems, just as
they are in America.
As a capstone to his argument,
Dr. Schlacks mentions the mil
lions of Russians and Germans
who have fled the Communist re
gime. Regarding the Germans his
figure is not exaggerated, but
Germany is a special case. Here
communism is being forcibly im
posed on a country which has
long enjoyed a high standard of
living under Western capitalism,
and in such a situation the ugli
ness of communism is particular
ly evident. The evil is compound
ed by the fact that the Russians
hate and fear Germany, and will
do all in their power to keep the
country divided and weak. Small
wonder that three million Ger
mans have escaped to the West.
But I would like to see Dr.
Schlacks’ proof that “millions” of
Russians have escaped in recent
years. It seems to me that a strik
ing fact of the last decade is rath
er the extreme scarcity of Rus
sian defectors. Groups of Rus
sians have been visiting the West
in ever-increasing numbers, but
only a handful of them have used
the opportunity to desert. And of
course every isolated defection
has been given the same extrava
gant play by the Western press
that we see now in the Klochko
incident.

BECAUSE I THINK that the
mood of the Russian people is ex
tremely important for us to
know, and because I set no groat
store by my own limited observa
tions, I have gone to some trouble
to compare notes with others who
have visited the Soviet Union re

cently. The reactions cover the
whole spectrum, but fully 90 per
cent of those I have talked to or
corresponded with tell me that
their impressions were much the
same as mine.

I would call Dr. Schlacks’ atten
tion particularly to an article by
a Cornell psychologist. Dr. Urie
Bronfenbrenner, in a recent num
ber of the Journal of Social Is
sues (volume 17, number 3). Dr.
Bronfenbrenner reports impres
sions practically identical with
mine, but his statements should
carry greater weight because he
speaks Russian fluently and could
talk with people of all classes, and
because as a psychologist he was
in a better position to interpret
and evaluate what he saw. One
remark is especially revealing:
Dr. Bronfenbrenner asked Ameri
can embassy officials and journal
ists why the enthusiasm and com
mitment to communism that he
had found among the Russian
people was never reported back to
America, and one reporter an
swered, “Sure, I know, but when
a Communist acts like a Commu
nist it isn’t news. If I want to be
sure that it will be printed back
home, I have to write about
what’s wrong with the system,
not its successes.”

FOB AS long as I can remem
ber (and I think my memory goes
back considerably further than
Dr. Schlacks’) I have listened to
would-be Russian experts de

scribe the unhappiness and smol
dering resentment within the So
viet Union. And yet Communist
Russia, despite monstrous mis
takes of its government, has
grown steadily more prosperous;
it has fought a devastating war
and emerged stronger than ever;
and under its influence commu
nism has spread to one part of
the world after another. This does
not impress me as the work of a
sullen, unwilling populace. It
seems a reasonable inference,
however unpalatable it may be,
that communism has a genuine
appeal to a large number of peo
ple. Might it not be more realistic
if we would accept this and try
to understand wherein the appeal
lies, so that we can combat it,
rather than hide our heads in the
sand and try to pretend that the
appeal does not exist?
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow
ing: article wax submitted to The
Daily by Prof, Krauskopf in reply
to a recent Campus Opinion ar
ticle by Prof. Charles Schlacks,
who teaches Western Civiliza
tion.)

Dr. Schlacks, in a recent article
in The Daily, has questioned some
of the conclusions about Russian
attitudes that I recorded in the
winter issue of Stanford Today.
One of the points I had tried to
make was that the Russian scien
tists 1 met on a visit to the Soviet
Union last March did not fit the
familiar American stereotype of
Soviet citizens as basically un
happy, cowering under the terror
ism and restrictions of an oppres
sive dictatorship, ready to flee to
the West at the first opportunity.
Dr. Schlacks feels that this im
pression is mistaken, basing his
argument largely on extensive
quotations from an article in This
Week magazine by Dr. Mikhail
A. Klochko, a Russian chemist
who defected to Canada a few
weeks ago. Dr. Klochko stoutly
maintains that the American
stereotype of his erstwhile fellow
citizens is correct in all details.
This is a difficult point to ar
gue, but a very inportant one. If
the Russians are as dissatisfied
with communism as Dr. Klochko
and Dr. Schlacks maintain, then
life for us is simple: the Soviet
empire can have little inner
strength, and wc need only bide
our time until it falls apart from
lack of support by its people. If,
however, the Russians are as con
tented with their lot and as dedi
cated to communism as I found
them to be. then the world is
much more complicated, because
our continuing struggle with the
Soviet system will involve a bit
ter conflict of ideas as well as
competition in industrial produc
tion and military preparedness. I
wish very sincerely that I knew
which of these alternatives is
nearer the truth. The thing that
frightens me is that we in Ameri
ca so uncritically accept the first
alternative, the easy, comforting,
black-and-white alternative, when
everything I saw in Russia cries
out to the contrary.
ALL I HAVE TO BACK my

opinions is the vivid memory of
23 days of earnest talk with Rus
sians from one walk of life, plus
more casual contacts with the
man-in-the-street in four Russian
cities. This is an altogether in
adequate basis from which to
draw sweeping conclusions about
Russians in general and I have
tried assiduously to confine my
remarks to the scientific group
with which I became well ac
quainted). Small though the group
may be, its opinions seemed to me
noteworthy because they were so
different from what I had been
led to expect. Were the opinions
these scientists expressed their
real opinions? Was I the victim
of an elaborate propaganda
scheme, planned to confuse a gul
lible college professor—as some
of my recent correspondence has
suggested? Of course I do not
know. I can give only the conclu
sions that in my best judgment
seem most reasonable, and that
have been checked in every way I
can think of. If Dr, Schlacks pre
fers to question my judgment,
this is, of course, his privilege.
On his side of the argument
we have the testimony of Dr.
Klochko. This gentleman, in the
first of three articles in This
Week, explains how he came to be
at odds with Stalin’s regime, how
he lived for years in terror of im
prisonment or liquidation, and
how he nursed his grievances
through a life of solitude in more
recent years while he laid plans
for escape.

A MAN WITH THIS history
would hardly retain much enthu
siasm for the Soviet government.
I am not questioning his integri
ty, nor doubting the justice of his
complaints: I merely point out
that he would inevitably paint the
Communist system in the black
est possible colors. Doubtless
there are other Dr. Klochkos in
Russia, who have spent much of
their life under, suspicion for one
reason or another, and who would
welcome an opportunity to es
cape. Doubtless also there is oc
casional annoyance with short
ages of goods and stupid burreau
cracy, as the examples of wry
Russian humor quoted by Dr.
Schlacks so pointedly attest. I do
not see that either statement is
necessarily inconsistent with a

widespread feeling among scien
tists of general satisfaction with
their life under the Communist
government. After all, we need
not look far to find chronic mal
contents in the United States, and
we are all familiar with salty
American humor based on tempo
rary shortages and governmental
obtuseness.
Is it unfair in this argument to
hint that Dr. Klochko was almost
certainly aided in preparing his
articles by an American writer
well acquainted with the sort of
thing that Americans like to read
about Russia of a Sunday after
noon? That the articles are set
forth with all the tired old catch
words and lurid pictures that
seem necessary to this kind of
propaganda? That everything is
expressed in the usual black-and
white terminology America is
altogether wondeful, Russia is al
together terrible? That This Week
is distributed as a supplement to
the most conservative newspaper
in San Francisco?
Dr. Klochko’s story would be
more impressive if 1 had not read
exactly the same kind of propa
ganda stories from the opposite
side of the fence in Russian news
papers last March. I remember
one in particular, about an Ameri
can family which had fled to Rus
sia because the father could not
find work here, decorated with
heartrending pictures of bread
lines in Detroit and full of
phrases calculated to convince a
Russian reader that America was
on the verge of collapse because
of discontent over unemployment.

Bronfenbrenner reports impres

mine, but his statements should
carry greater weight because he
speaks Russian fluently and could
talk with people of all classes, and
because as a psychologist he was
in a better position to interpret

Dr. Bronfenbrenner asked Ameri

Russia, despite monstrous mis
takes of its government, has

it has fought a devastating war

that communism has a genuine

(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow
ing: article wax submitted to The
Daily by Prof, Krauskopf in reply
to a recent Campus Opinion ar
ticle by Prof. Charles Schlacks,
who teaches Western Civiliza
tion.)

Dr. Schlacks, in a recent article
in The Daily, has questioned some
of the conclusions about Russian
attitudes that I recorded in the
winter issue of Stanford Today.
One of the points I had tried to
make was that the Russian scien
tists 1 met on a visit to the Soviet
Union last March did not fit the
familiar American stereotype of
Soviet citizens as basically un
happy, cowering under the terror
ism and restrictions of an oppres
sive dictatorship, ready to flee to
the West at the first opportunity.
Dr. Schlacks feels that this im
pression is mistaken, basing his
argument largely on extensive
quotations from an article in This
Week magazine by Dr. Mikhail
A. Klochko, a Russian chemist
who defected to Canada a few
weeks ago. Dr. Klochko stoutly
maintains that the American
stereotype of his erstwhile fellow
citizens is correct in all details.
This is a difficult point to ar
gue, but a very inportant one. If
the Russians are as dissatisfied
with communism as Dr. Klochko
and Dr. Schlacks maintain, then
life for us is simple: the Soviet
empire can have little inner
strength, and wc need only bide
our time until it falls apart from
lack of support by its people. If,
however, the Russians are as con
tented with their lot and as dedi
cated to communism as I found
them to be. then the world is
much more complicated, because
our continuing struggle with the
Soviet system will involve a bit
ter conflict of ideas as well as
competition in industrial produc
tion and military preparedness. I
wish very sincerely that I knew
which of these alternatives is
nearer the truth. The thing that
frightens me is that we in Ameri
ca so uncritically accept the first
alternative, the easy, comforting,
black-and-white alternative, when
everything I saw in Russia cries
out to the contrary.
ALL I HAVE TO BACK my

opinions is the vivid memory of
23 days of earnest talk with Rus
sians from one walk of life, plus
more casual contacts with the
man-in-the-street in four Russian
cities. This is an altogether in
adequate basis from which to
draw sweeping conclusions about
Russians in general and I have
tried assiduously to confine my
remarks to the scientific group
with which I became well ac
quainted). Small though the group
may be, its opinions seemed to me
noteworthy because they were so
different from what I had been
led to expect. Were the opinions
these scientists expressed their
real opinions? Was I the victim
of an elaborate propaganda
scheme, planned to confuse a gul
lible college professor—as some
of my recent correspondence has
suggested? Of course I do not
know. I can give only the conclu
sions that in my best judgment
seem most reasonable, and that
have been checked in every way I
can think of. If Dr, Schlacks pre
fers to question my judgment,
this is, of course, his privilege.
On his side of the argument
we have the testimony of Dr.
Klochko. This gentleman, in the
first of three articles in This
Week, explains how he came to be
at odds with Stalin’s regime, how
he lived for years in terror of im
prisonment or liquidation, and
how he nursed his grievances
through a life of solitude in more
recent years while he laid plans
for escape.

A MAN WITH THIS history
would hardly retain much enthu
siasm for the Soviet government.
I am not questioning his integri
ty, nor doubting the justice of his
complaints: I merely point out
that he would inevitably paint the
Communist system in the black
est possible colors. Doubtless
there are other Dr. Klochkos in
Russia, who have spent much of
their life under, suspicion for one
reason or another, and who would
welcome an opportunity to es
cape. Doubtless also there is oc
casional annoyance with short
ages of goods and stupid burreau
cracy, as the examples of wry
Russian humor quoted by Dr.
Schlacks so pointedly attest. I do
not see that either statement is
necessarily inconsistent with a

widespread feeling among scien
tists of general satisfaction with
their life under the Communist
government. After all, we need
not look far to find chronic mal
contents in the United States, and
we are all familiar with salty
American humor based on tempo
rary shortages and governmental
obtuseness.
Is it unfair in this argument to
hint that Dr. Klochko was almost
certainly aided in preparing his
articles by an American writer
well acquainted with the sort of
thing that Americans like to read
about Russia of a Sunday after
noon? That the articles are set
forth with all the tired old catch
words and lurid pictures that
seem necessary to this kind of
propaganda? That everything is
expressed in the usual black-and
white terminology America is
altogether wondeful, Russia is al
together terrible? That This Week
is distributed as a supplement to
the most conservative newspaper
in San Francisco?
Dr. Klochko’s story would be
more impressive if 1 had not read
exactly the same kind of propa
ganda stories from the opposite
side of the fence in Russian news
papers last March. I remember
one in particular, about an Ameri
can family which had fled to Rus
sia because the father could not
find work here, decorated with
heartrending pictures of bread
lines in Detroit and full of
phrases calculated to convince a
Russian reader that America was
on the verge of collapse because
of discontent over unemployment.

HR. SCHLACKS BOLSTERS
his picture of Russian unhappi
ness by citing “facts” about alco
holism and juvenile crime. Hete
I have no statistics to refute him,
only observations from much
wandering on foot through Rus
sian cities. Certainly the effects
of alcoholism and juvenile delin
quency are no more publicly evi
dent than they are here al
though I was told by several of
my Russian friends that these are
indeed serious problems, just as
they are in America.
As a capstone to his argument,
Dr. Schlacks mentions the mil
lions of Russians and Germans
who have fled the Communist re
gime. Regarding the Germans his
figure is not exaggerated, but
Germany is a special case. Here
communism is being forcibly im
posed on a country which has
long enjoyed a high standard of
living under Western capitalism,
and in such a situation the ugli
ness of communism is particular
ly evident. The evil is compound
ed by the fact that the Russians
hate and fear Germany, and will
do all in their power to keep the
country divided and weak. Small
wonder that three million Ger
mans have escaped to the West.
But I would like to see Dr.
Schlacks’ proof that “millions” of
Russians have escaped in recent
years. It seems to me that a strik
ing fact of the last decade is rath
er the extreme scarcity of Rus
sian defectors. Groups of Rus
sians have been visiting the West
in ever-increasing numbers, but
only a handful of them have used
the opportunity to desert. And of
course every isolated defection
has been given the same extrava
gant play by the Western press
that we see now in the Klochko
incident.

BECAUSE I THINK that the
mood of the Russian people is ex
tremely important for us to
know, and because I set no groat
store by my own limited observa
tions, I have gone to some trouble
to compare notes with others who
have visited the Soviet Union re

cently. The reactions cover the
whole spectrum, but fully 90 per
cent of those I have talked to or
corresponded with tell me that
their impressions were much the
same as mine.

lies, so that we can combat it,

appeal does not exist?
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow
ing: article wax submitted to The
Daily by Prof, Krauskopf in reply
to a recent Campus Opinion ar
ticle by Prof. Charles Schlacks,
who teaches Western Civiliza
tion.)

Dr. Schlacks, in a recent article
in The Daily, has questioned some
of the conclusions about Russian
attitudes that I recorded in the
winter issue of Stanford Today.
One of the points I had tried to
make was that the Russian scien
tists 1 met on a visit to the Soviet
Union last March did not fit the
familiar American stereotype of
Soviet citizens as basically un
happy, cowering under the terror
ism and restrictions of an oppres
sive dictatorship, ready to flee to
the West at the first opportunity.
Dr. Schlacks feels that this im
pression is mistaken, basing his
argument largely on extensive
quotations from an article in This
Week magazine by Dr. Mikhail
A. Klochko, a Russian chemist
who defected to Canada a few
weeks ago. Dr. Klochko stoutly
maintains that the American
stereotype of his erstwhile fellow
citizens is correct in all details.
This is a difficult point to ar
gue, but a very inportant one. If
the Russians are as dissatisfied
with communism as Dr. Klochko
and Dr. Schlacks maintain, then
life for us is simple: the Soviet
empire can have little inner
strength, and wc need only bide
our time until it falls apart from
lack of support by its people. If,
however, the Russians are as con
tented with their lot and as dedi
cated to communism as I found
them to be. then the world is
much more complicated, because
our continuing struggle with the
Soviet system will involve a bit
ter conflict of ideas as well as
competition in industrial produc
tion and military preparedness. I
wish very sincerely that I knew
which of these alternatives is
nearer the truth. The thing that
frightens me is that we in Ameri
ca so uncritically accept the first
alternative, the easy, comforting,
black-and-white alternative, when
everything I saw in Russia cries
out to the contrary.
ALL I HAVE TO BACK my

opinions is the vivid memory of
23 days of earnest talk with Rus
sians from one walk of life, plus
more casual contacts with the
man-in-the-street in four Russian
cities. This is an altogether in
adequate basis from which to
draw sweeping conclusions about
Russians in general and I have
tried assiduously to confine my
remarks to the scientific group
with which I became well ac
quainted). Small though the group
may be, its opinions seemed to me
noteworthy because they were so
different from what I had been
led to expect. Were the opinions
these scientists expressed their
real opinions? Was I the victim
of an elaborate propaganda
scheme, planned to confuse a gul
lible college professor—as some
of my recent correspondence has
suggested? Of course I do not
know. I can give only the conclu
sions that in my best judgment
seem most reasonable, and that
have been checked in every way I
can think of. If Dr, Schlacks pre
fers to question my judgment,
this is, of course, his privilege.
On his side of the argument
we have the testimony of Dr.
Klochko. This gentleman, in the
first of three articles in This
Week, explains how he came to be
at odds with Stalin’s regime, how
he lived for years in terror of im
prisonment or liquidation, and
how he nursed his grievances
through a life of solitude in more
recent years while he laid plans
for escape.

A MAN WITH THIS history
would hardly retain much enthu
siasm for the Soviet government.
I am not questioning his integri
ty, nor doubting the justice of his
complaints: I merely point out
that he would inevitably paint the
Communist system in the black
est possible colors. Doubtless
there are other Dr. Klochkos in
Russia, who have spent much of
their life under, suspicion for one
reason or another, and who would
welcome an opportunity to es
cape. Doubtless also there is oc
casional annoyance with short
ages of goods and stupid burreau
cracy, as the examples of wry
Russian humor quoted by Dr.
Schlacks so pointedly attest. I do
not see that either statement is
necessarily inconsistent with a

widespread feeling among scien
tists of general satisfaction with
their life under the Communist
government. After all, we need
not look far to find chronic mal
contents in the United States, and
we are all familiar with salty
American humor based on tempo
rary shortages and governmental
obtuseness.
Is it unfair in this argument to
hint that Dr. Klochko was almost
certainly aided in preparing his
articles by an American writer
well acquainted with the sort of
thing that Americans like to read
about Russia of a Sunday after
noon? That the articles are set
forth with all the tired old catch
words and lurid pictures that
seem necessary to this kind of
propaganda? That everything is
expressed in the usual black-and
white terminology America is
altogether wondeful, Russia is al
together terrible? That This Week
is distributed as a supplement to
the most conservative newspaper
in San Francisco?
Dr. Klochko’s story would be
more impressive if 1 had not read
exactly the same kind of propa
ganda stories from the opposite
side of the fence in Russian news
papers last March. I remember
one in particular, about an Ameri
can family which had fled to Rus
sia because the father could not
find work here, decorated with
heartrending pictures of bread
lines in Detroit and full of
phrases calculated to convince a
Russian reader that America was
on the verge of collapse because
of discontent over unemployment.

HR. SCHLACKS BOLSTERS
his picture of Russian unhappi
ness by citing “facts” about alco
holism and juvenile crime. Hete
I have no statistics to refute him,
only observations from much
wandering on foot through Rus
sian cities. Certainly the effects
of alcoholism and juvenile delin
quency are no more publicly evi
dent than they are here al
though I was told by several of
my Russian friends that these are
indeed serious problems, just as
they are in America.
As a capstone to his argument,
Dr. Schlacks mentions the mil
lions of Russians and Germans
who have fled the Communist re
gime. Regarding the Germans his
figure is not exaggerated, but
Germany is a special case. Here
communism is being forcibly im
posed on a country which has
long enjoyed a high standard of
living under Western capitalism,
and in such a situation the ugli
ness of communism is particular
ly evident. The evil is compound
ed by the fact that the Russians
hate and fear Germany, and will
do all in their power to keep the
country divided and weak. Small
wonder that three million Ger
mans have escaped to the West.
But I would like to see Dr.
Schlacks’ proof that “millions” of
Russians have escaped in recent
years. It seems to me that a strik
ing fact of the last decade is rath
er the extreme scarcity of Rus
sian defectors. Groups of Rus
sians have been visiting the West
in ever-increasing numbers, but
only a handful of them have used
the opportunity to desert. And of
course every isolated defection
has been given the same extrava
gant play by the Western press
that we see now in the Klochko
incident.

BECAUSE I THINK that the
mood of the Russian people is ex
tremely important for us to
know, and because I set no groat
store by my own limited observa
tions, I have gone to some trouble
to compare notes with others who
have visited the Soviet Union re

cently. The reactions cover the
whole spectrum, but fully 90 per
cent of those I have talked to or
corresponded with tell me that
their impressions were much the
same as mine.

I would call Dr. Schlacks’ atten
tion particularly to an article by
a Cornell psychologist. Dr. Urie
Bronfenbrenner, in a recent num
ber of the Journal of Social Is
sues (volume 17, number 3). Dr.
Bronfenbrenner reports impres
sions practically identical with
mine, but his statements should
carry greater weight because he
speaks Russian fluently and could
talk with people of all classes, and
because as a psychologist he was
in a better position to interpret
and evaluate what he saw. One
remark is especially revealing:
Dr. Bronfenbrenner asked Ameri
can embassy officials and journal
ists why the enthusiasm and com
mitment to communism that he
had found among the Russian
people was never reported back to
America, and one reporter an
swered, “Sure, I know, but when
a Communist acts like a Commu
nist it isn’t news. If I want to be
sure that it will be printed back
home, I have to write about
what’s wrong with the system,
not its successes.”

FOB AS long as I can remem
ber (and I think my memory goes
back considerably further than
Dr. Schlacks’) I have listened to
would-be Russian experts de

scribe the unhappiness and smol
dering resentment within the So
viet Union. And yet Communist
Russia, despite monstrous mis
takes of its government, has
grown steadily more prosperous;
it has fought a devastating war
and emerged stronger than ever;
and under its influence commu
nism has spread to one part of
the world after another. This does
not impress me as the work of a
sullen, unwilling populace. It
seems a reasonable inference,
however unpalatable it may be,
that communism has a genuine
appeal to a large number of peo
ple. Might it not be more realistic
if we would accept this and try
to understand wherein the appeal
lies, so that we can combat it,
rather than hide our heads in the
sand and try to pretend that the
appeal does not exist?
