COMMUNISM CONDEMNED
Editor, The Daily:

I would like to discuss the
charge frequently made against
Dx’. Schwarz that, in condemning
Communism, he applies black
and-white morality to complex po
litical and economic pxoblems.
Dr. Schwarz’s condemnation, if
I assume correctly, does not lie
in the realm of politics or econ
omics, but in the x-ealm of moral
ity. Communism, unlike any other
institution existing, is in itself a
complete way of thinking. That
is, it is not just a system of poli
tics or economics, but a complete
system of politics, economics, sci
ence, religion, mox-ality, and meta
physics—in short, an cntii'e phi
losophy of life. These various
phases of Communism axe inter
dependent; for example, its poli
tics depends on its morality, its
economics depends on its meta
physics, and its religion depends
on its politics. Therefore, the only
ress.
The entire club will be open in
cluding two dance floors. Music
will be provided by Joe Drigandi
and his orchestra and by The
Four Fifths.

Tickets may be obtained from
ROTC cadets at the BAG.

way to handle this massive sys
tem of thinking is to deal directly
with its very core, and not its
politics or economics, since these
are only the outward manifesta
tions. The core of Communist
doctrine is dialectical material
ism, which assumes two basic
premises, namely, that the world
is entirely material, and that it is
in constant conflict.

Now it sems that if we can con
tradict these two premises, the
whole system collapses. Further
more, anyone who acknowledges
the existence of a supxeme spiritu
al Being, because of the theologi
cal implications, necessarily con
tradicts both pi’emises, and is
therefore justified in calling Com
munism false or wrong. And if
ho thus interprets Communism
fi’om a moral standpoint, he has
no need to examine the "reality”
or “progress” of Communist na
tions, because that is not how
morality is established. For exam
ple. muxder is always wrong, no
mattei' how many people are ma
terially benefited by the victim's
death.

Hence, Dr. Schwarz, or anyone
else who speaks in the name of
morality, has no choice but to
condemn Communism,

way to handle this massive sys

with its very core, and not its
politics or economics, since these
are only the outward manifesta

doctrine is dialectical material
ism, which assumes two basic
premises, namely, that the world
is entirely material, and that it is
in constant conflict.

Now it sems that if we can con
tradict these two premises, the
whole system collapses. Further

I would like to discuss the
charge frequently made against
Dx’. Schwarz that, in condemning
Communism, he applies black
and-white morality to complex po
litical and economic pxoblems.
Dr. Schwarz’s condemnation, if
I assume correctly, does not lie
in the realm of politics or econ
omics, but in the x-ealm of moral
ity. Communism, unlike any other
institution existing, is in itself a
complete way of thinking. That
is, it is not just a system of poli
tics or economics, but a complete
system of politics, economics, sci
ence, religion, mox-ality, and meta
