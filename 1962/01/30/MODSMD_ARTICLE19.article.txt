## It's About that Chubby Checker.... 
### STEVE ZOUSMER 
Twist-king Chubby Checker
and a raving team of lesser
screamers invaded the Cow Pal
ace Saturday night and gave
more than 15,000 young fanatics
all the entertainment they had
paid for. And while Chubby and
the 20-plus acts that preceded him
shook the Cow Palace stage, a
crowd of several thousand who
had been unable to get tickets
amused themselves by socking,
stamping and stabbing each other
outside the old arena.
I took a date instead of a
weapon—got a seat, and took in
one of the most amazing perform
ances I’ve ever seen.

One thing I realized after the
first few acts was that the show
would have been almost as suc
cessful without the performers.
I would buy a ticket to see that
audience. The motley, maniacal,
zoo-parade of Twist fans had
come to prove that they could do
everything the paid acts could do.
They could and did.
MOSTLY OF THE junior high
school sot, they twisted and shim
mied in the aisles until they were
pushed back into their seats by
rough, bruising police and securi
ty guards. The guards circulated
from one disturbance to another,
communicating by means of
walkie-talkies (my date mistook
the long antennas of their walkie
talkies for swords, which might
have been more useful).
The twisting kids could not be
stopped. Some bounced back into
the aisles to face the police,
others stood on their seats to
twist, others twisted while sitting.
My dale noticed such a sitting
twister who buried his chin in his
chest and passionately gyrated
his arms and shoulders even
when the music had stopped and
the next act was being intro
duced by one of the many emcees.
One of the emcees was a partic
ularly puzzling fellow in a space
suit who mumbled his introduc
tions through a vacuum-sealed
space helmet.
What an audience! (Now safe
ly back at Stanford I think of
something Joseph Conrad wrote:
“The contact with pure unmiti
gated savagery, with primitive
nature and primitive man, brings
sudden and profound trouble into
the heart.” That’s true.) I was
scared out of my mind.
ESPECIALLY BY THE Mexi
can who sat below and in front of
me. During the three and one
half hours I frequently crossed
and re-crossed my legs, kicking
him each time. He would turn
around and glare and I would
apologize. Near the end of the
show, when I kicked him in the
ear, he turned his head and mut
tered, “Gringo.”
My date said she would protect
me with her sharp fingernails,
She’s very humorous.

The performers did their best
to out-do the audience. There
were solos, duets, trios, quartets,
brother and sister acts. One of the
latter, either the Del-Coeds or the
Paris Sisters, thanked the princi

pal of their high school who had
excused them from school so they
could make their debut in show
biz. I guessed that their principal
would be willing to excuse them
many more times.
ONE OF THE classiest num
bers of the show was “Oliver
Twist.” The song makes Charles
Dickens’ character a modern
high-school illiterate who snows
the women with his hip motions;

He can’t write a letter
’Cause he can’t spell
Girls all wanna wear his sweater
And catch the eye of this fabulous
guy
. . . You oughta see Oliver twist.

The fellow who sang “Oliver
Twist” was the first to throw
away his suit jacket. This was a
well-received innovation and sev
eral other entertainers finished
their acts minus half of their
skin-tight apparel. Gene Pitney,
another star, shed his jacket and
then threw his tie into the audi
ence.
Raul Donner groaned, the Let
termen mentioned that they had
flunked out of school, Bobby Free
man shimmied for 30 minutes,
the Marvelettes did “Mr. Post
man” (which I paraphrase as fol
lows; “Mr. Postman, get a letter
and put a stamp on it, and bring
me a letter from my lover-man”).
Three apes in tuxedoes did the
funniest act. The emcee pointed

out that they hadn’t had any suc
cess with records but were “a
great visual act.”
We were beginning to wonder
when Chubby would appear. Al
most three hours had elapsed.
“May I scream when Chubby
Checker comes on?” asked my
date. I said that I planned to
scream myself, or yawn.
THAT IS WHEN the bandlead
er did his number. Everyone was
getting into the act.
Then Chubby bounced onstage.
The 20-year-old former chicken
vendor did half a dozen songs and
the aisles were bursting with
twisters. A sedate-looking adult
couple several rows behind me
stood up and made an effort at
the Twist. Someone shouted,
“Keep trying, old daddy.”
Flashbulbs popped. Hips swung.
Punches flew.
I decided it was time to move.
I was kicked up and down as I
tried to tug my date through the
twisting masses. One burly twist
er lifted his partner three feet off
the floor, stumbled, and dropped
her on her back.
We got away. But it will be a
long time before I forget Chubby
Checker:

He can’t write a letter
’Cause he can’t spell,
Girls all wanna wear his sweater
’Cause he got $23,000 for twisting
so well.
