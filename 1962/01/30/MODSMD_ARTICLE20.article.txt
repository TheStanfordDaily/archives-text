# Nuclear Test Talks Break up
## 
### 
GENEVA (UPI) The East-
West talks on banning nuclear
test explosions broke up in total
disagreement yesterday after
three years and 333 sessions of
fruitless negotiations.
It appeared probable the break
up would free the United States
to follow Russia in resuming at
mospheric testing of nuclear
bombs but that decision rests
with President Kennedy.
WESTERN SOURCES insisted
the talks were theoretically still
in session and had merely been
recessed for an indefinite period
as the United States and Britain
suggested.
But Soviet negotiator Semyon
K. Tsarapkin said “It is finished,
no more talks.” He waved a ball
point pen in the air and continu
ed, “they are finished, broken off
—wrecked by the west.”
Tsarapkin was prepared for
yesterday’s breakup. When the
session ended he fished out a
prepared statement and lambast
ed the West with charges of “sa
botage,” “attempted espionage”
and a warning the West must
take the “grave consequences.”

THE TALKS had dragged on
for years without getting any
where and the United States pro
posed yesterday they adjourn for
a while because they “had reach
ed a stage of total deadlock.”
Tsarapkin said yesterday the
West was sabotaging the confer
ence because it did not want to
accept Soviet proposals of last
Nov. 28 which he said provide a
“reliable, effective and feasible”
method of controlling nuclear ex
plosions.
The proposals called for an in
definite moratorium on under
ground tests and provided for no
controls. The West rejected them
because they left too much up to
Russian good faith.
