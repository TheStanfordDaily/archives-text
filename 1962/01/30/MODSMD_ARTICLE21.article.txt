In a close meet that wasn’t decided until the last match, Stan
fords combined freshman and JV wrestling team edged Cabrillo
College of Watsonville, 14-11, at the Pavilion last Saturday. Card

division.
In other matches, Stanford’s
Tim Davis won his 130-pound divi
sion with a pin in 44 seconds, and
Card Jerry Smith. 137 pounds,
won a decision. K. Starling of
Cabrillo pinned Jeff Armistead
in the 147-pound category. Stan
ford’s Bob Cox (157) and Rick
Schaefer (177) both lost close

decisions.
Beuhler was the lone varsity
wrestler for Stanford, as Coach
Jack McKenna gave his reserve
team some valuable experience.
Last Thursday the Indian var
sity squad lost to Mare Island,
25-11, at Mare Island.
The varsity’s record stands at
one win and throe losses, while
the freshman-.IV team is 1-1.
