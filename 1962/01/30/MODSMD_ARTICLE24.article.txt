# Slumping Stanford Cagers Seek Win Tonight Against Highly Rated Broncos
## 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford hopes to get back on
the winning path tonight when
the varsity basket bailers journey
down the peninsula to take on the
tough Santa Clara Broncos on
the Broncos’ home court. Game
time is 8 p.m.

Stanford comes off a disastrous
weekend trip to the Northwest
where they lost a pair to Wash
ington. Santa Clara has had equal
problems in their last two games.
On a road trip to Los Angeles
they dropped games to Peppor
fline and Loyola to fall into the
WCAC cellar. This came after
they were nationally ranked and
had compiled a 12-1 season record.
Santa Clara had also won the
WCAC preseason tournament.
Stanford had its 11-game win
ning streak broken by the double
loss. The Indians have yet to win
an away-from-home game against
college competition. They dropped
two to Oregon State early in the
season.
STANFORD WILL SEND the
same starting lineup used since
the end of a four-game sweep in
Hawaii, and hope it shoots better
than the dismal sub-30 per cent
shot up north.
Co-captain John Windsor and
sophomore Hollis Moore will start
at forwards. Windsor kept up his
pace as Stanford’s leading AAWU
scorer with 17 and 13 points
against the Huskies. Moore did a
good job defensing Ed Corell and
Roger Niva, but couldn’t hit the
basket.

Tom Dose will start at center.
He was at his hottest Friday
night when he scored 26 points,
but Saturday he played only 18
minutes because of foul trouble
and scored little.
THE GUARDS WILL be Dar
rell Sutherland and Don Clemet
son. Darrell showed some flashes
of his soft touch on the long jump
shot Saturday and wound up with
14 points. Don was just plain off
both nights.
Co-captain Phil Kelly and re
serves Mike Ledgerwood, Bob
Sommers and Doug Clemetson
will all see action.
Kelly and Sommers have been
waging a strong fight for the
first reserve forward spot. Kelly
is the better shooter, but Som
mers has a rebounding edge be
cause he is taller. Both are leech
like defenders.
Santa Clara will start an outfit
with balanced scoring, height and
the second-best defense in the na
tion.
THE BRONCOS SCORE 59
points per game and give up only
49. The leading scorer isn’t even
a starter, which shows the bal
ance on this club. The Broncs also
boast one of the few 6-6 guards in
college basketball.
The heights of the Santa Clara
players read like a college coach’s
dream. Forwards Joe Weiss and
Gene Shields are 6-7, center Le
roy Jackson is 6-6, and guard Ron
McGee is 6-6. Barry Christina is

ihe midget, measuring up to'
about six feet. Reserve guard and
forward Bob Garibaldi is a beefy
6-5.
Garibaldi is the leading scorer
for the Broncos with just under a
12-point average. All the starters
average about 10 points a game.
With all their height, the Bron
cos are tough on the boards. They
have reserve strength led by Gar
ibaldi, and they will be strength
ened by the return to action of
sophomore guard Tim Cullen,
who has yet to play this year,
THE WINNER ‘of the battle

will have to bo called tho best
team in tho Bay Area, with Stan
ford 13-4, and Santa Clara 12-3 on
the season.
The Stanford freshmen will
meet the Santa Clara freshmen in
a game to be played at San Jose
at €i: 1 r>. The Papooses were shad
ed by San Jose City College in
their last game. They will be go-j
ing for their seventh win in nine i
games.

BOB SOMMERS, reserve forward, is an aggressive rebounder, and
will probably see action against tall Santa Clara.
