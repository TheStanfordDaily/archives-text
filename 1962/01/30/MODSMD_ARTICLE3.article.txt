In an effort to bring a greater
understanding of the Far East to
high school students in the area,
the Asia desk of the HR is de
veloping a series of assembly pro

Each assembly will feature
teams of Asian and American stu
dents presenting the Far East in
films, talks, and dances.
Students from far eastern coun
tries interested in participating in
this activity will meet at 3 p.m. on
Thursday, Feb. 1, in the Alumni
