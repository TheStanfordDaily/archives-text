Union which greeted its inception,
Humphrey staled, "(Under the
Eisenhower administration) we
went through a time of Rip Van
Winkle politics, neither back
wards nor forwards, hut in flux.”
“This administration started
with its own area redevelop
ment,” he said, “broadened the
base of the Fair Labor Standards
Act, strengthened Social Security
aid to dependent children, reor
ganized the entire foreign aid ad
ministration . . . initiated the
broadest, most comprehensive
housing program ever presented
to a people in the history of the
world.”
“TO THOSE who spend much
of their ill-gotten gains for a bar
rage of propaganda on the Amer
ican people (on anti-commu
nism),” Humphrey stated, “I say
go down to the slums of Santiago,
Chile: Lima. Peru; go down and
fight the struggle where the
battle is being fought."
Humphrey, who is in San Fran
cisco to work on the Food for
Peace plan, called the foreign aid
program “a new program em
phasizing self-help, social and
community development.
“We have outlined the greatest
challenge of our decade—“ All
iance for Progress,” he said.
“Alliance for Progress is based

on a mutual co-operation to util
ize the resources of Latin Ameri
ca itself . . . We must make a
commitment.
“We must be known in the 60’s
not as a nation which built the
strongest military defense, . . .
but as the nation which brought
the wonders of enlightenment to
more people in the world than
ever before.
“You are a citizen of the most
powerful nation on the face of the
earth. If you don’t know it,
Khrushchev does.”
THE SENIOR MEMBER of the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee and chairman of (he disar
mament committee commented,
"The cost of peacemaking is high,
but it wouldn’t be even one-tenth
of a second of that of modern
military competition. Khrushchev
wants to weaken or cripple the
UN—and he has a lot of help in
this country.
“I think the greatest accom
plishment of the Kennedy admin
istration this year has been
breathing life into the UN with
Adlai Stevenson as Ambassador.”
In closing an address that
brought him a standing ovation
from the Stanford audience, Hum
phrey spoke “with regret” of
what may be the need to resume
nuclear testing. “The Soviets
broke the agreement, broke up
the conference,” he said, “We are
making one valiant effort for
agreement.”

from the Stanford audience, Hum

SEN. HUBERT HUMPHREY, in a vigorous speech yesterday praised
Kennedy's "New Frontier", and denounced "radical right-wingers."
Union which greeted its inception,
Humphrey staled, "(Under the
Eisenhower administration) we
went through a time of Rip Van
Winkle politics, neither back
wards nor forwards, hut in flux.”
“This administration started
with its own area redevelop
ment,” he said, “broadened the
base of the Fair Labor Standards
Act, strengthened Social Security
aid to dependent children, reor
ganized the entire foreign aid ad
ministration . . . initiated the
broadest, most comprehensive
housing program ever presented
to a people in the history of the
world.”
“TO THOSE who spend much
of their ill-gotten gains for a bar
rage of propaganda on the Amer
ican people (on anti-commu
nism),” Humphrey stated, “I say
go down to the slums of Santiago,
Chile: Lima. Peru; go down and
fight the struggle where the
battle is being fought."
Humphrey, who is in San Fran
cisco to work on the Food for
Peace plan, called the foreign aid
program “a new program em
phasizing self-help, social and
community development.
“We have outlined the greatest
challenge of our decade—“ All
iance for Progress,” he said.
“Alliance for Progress is based

on a mutual co-operation to util
ize the resources of Latin Ameri
ca itself . . . We must make a
commitment.
“We must be known in the 60’s
not as a nation which built the
strongest military defense, . . .
but as the nation which brought
the wonders of enlightenment to
more people in the world than
ever before.
“You are a citizen of the most
powerful nation on the face of the
earth. If you don’t know it,
Khrushchev does.”
