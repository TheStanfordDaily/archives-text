of radical right wing groups and
their relation to the American
political tradition at a conference
Saturday in San Francisco,
Entitled "The Impact of the
Radical Right,” the conference
will consist of speeches and panel
discussion beginning at 3 p.m.
and extending through the eve
ning at Nourse Auditorium, Hayes
at Franklin, in the City.
Plans for the conference de
veloped from informal discussions
among Stanford and Cal students

j last week. A volunteer committee
of students was at work over the
weekend enlisting sponsors for
the conference.
“'MOST OF THK people con
tacted were very responsive,” said
Tom Burns, Stanford graduate
student in sociology. "They ex
pressed concern with the rise of
radical right-wing groups and
welcomed any constructive means
for expressing their convictions.”
Burns said the panel discus
sions will take up two subjects.
The first panel, composed of noted
Bay Area social scientists and
journalists, will analyze the roots
of the extreme right-wing move
ments, the basis of its appeal and
the methods of its operation.
The second panel, composed of
community leaders from various
fields, will discuss the effect of
the movement upon American
society.
