# SU Grad Discovers Vertical Flight Plan

Alberto Alvarez-Calderon, a young Peruvian at Stanford lias
bit upon an incredibly simple idea that could be the answer to
man’s long-sought dream of vertical take-offs and landings in

conventional high-speed aircraft.
By installing a rotating cylind
he has found away to turn a pro--f
peller slipstream abruptly down
ward as much as 90 degrees.
In wind tunnel tests a wing
model incorporating the “rotating
cylinder flap” has demonstrated
a 70 per cent increase in lift over
the conventional wing flap com- j
binations and complete stability}
in vertical flight without the aid
of tail controls.
MOST IMPORTANT of all is
the negligible power required to
turn the trick. Inefficient use of
power has proved the stumbling
block of all previous attempts to
deflect the propeller slipstream j
downward. They used too much j
power, and were unstable besides, j

planes do to cut air speed for
landing. At the same time the
cylinder, located between the flap
and the fixed leading portion of
the wing, is set spinning. The I
cylinder’s surface moves at a
faster speed than the slipstream.
The rotating cylinder causes
the entire slipstream to turn
down sharply, flowing along the
surface of the trailing flap and
creating an upward force.
ALVAREZ - CALDERON’S ro
tating cylinder flap has yet to be
built into a real airplane. Several
aircraft companies are interested,
however.
Such an airplane could rise
straight up, hover, move back
ward or forward, and descend
vertically, all without using any
tail controls. For conventional
aircraft, its greater lifting ability
would permit drastically in
creased pay loads.
For high-speed horizontal flight,
the trailing flap is merely
straightened out, and the aircraft
flies in its normal manner. In this
position the rotating cylinder is
contained within the airfoil of
the wing.
