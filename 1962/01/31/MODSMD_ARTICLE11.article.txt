# Herter Urges America To Join Common Market
## 
### BILL REPLY 
If the United States refuses to combine its resources with the
free nations of the world our alliances such as the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization will break up and peaceful co-existence will
be impossible.
This was the warning former Secretary of State Christian

Herter gave an overflow crowd in
Memorial Auditorium at I he open
ing of the fifth annual Foreign
Policy Institute.
“If the strength of the free
world can be pooled, then we have
a chance,” Herter said. “Peaceful
co-existence with the limited
definition of no active war—will
be possible. The satellite nations
and perhaps even European Rus
sia herself will break away from
Communism.”

Herter was given a rousing
standing ovation by the crowd of
FPI members and Tuesday Eve
ning Series spectators. Some 100
students, unable to find seats,
lined the walls to hear the man
who was our secretary of State
in 1959-60.
A loud-speaker carried the
speech outside the Auditorium
where a crowd of more than 200
huddled in the cool night, after
the doors to Memorial Auditori
um were closed.
Herter suggested that the
strength of the free world bo
pooled through the European
Economic Community, popularly
called the Common Market.
He called the success of the
common market revolutionary
and phenomenal. “It is much
more than customs union—it is a
political and economic amalga
mation,” Herter said.
The member nations have
grown economically far faster
than the United States and Brit
ain, he said. Britain’s failure to
keep pace has forced her to join,
Herter noted.
“The Common Market is the
beginning of a free trade area;
in five to six years it will be com
pletely a free trade area,” he said.
“It was in this way that the 13
original states agreed to estab
lish free trade.”
“Now Europe is following suit
with an area equal to our own
and a poulation one-third larger.”
The United States would be
playing into the hands of the
Communists if she followed a
course of protectionism and iso
lationism or tried to rival the
Common Market in production,
Herter said.
A return to isolationism would
render the U.S. incapable of meet
ing the challenge of the underde
veloped world, “and this is a chal
lenge wo can’t afford to lose,” he
said. “It will take great strength
and resources.”
The high - standard -of - living
group of nations that make up
the free world are too small in
number (one-sixth of the world’s
population) and occupy too little
of the earth’s surface to fight
among themselves, Herter warn
ed. “This is precisely what the
Soviets would like to see.”
The Soviets are intent on gain
ing control of the world and
would accomplish this by means
other than war, Herter said. Their
program is to keep the free world
split and absorb the uncommitted
or underdeveloped nations by cap
italizing on their poverty, he
stated.
The Communists define peace
ful co-existence as total absence
of all elements of the cold war,
but with their statements such as
“your grandchildren will live un
der Communism” this kind of
peaceful co-existence is impossi
ble, Herter said.
“The worst possible thing
would be to make the free-world
trade partnership a “rich man’s
club,” he warned. “The benefits
must be extended to all free
countries, ho declared.
“We arc at a cross road,” Her
ter solemnly said. “This year or
the next will be the year of de
cision. A trade partnership is
what we need. The sui’vival of the
country depends on it.”
Some of our industries wmuld
be hurt; sacrifices and readjust
ments in our thinking would be
required: political institutions
would have to be rebuilt; and we
would have to submit ourselves
to some arbitral body that may
rule against us, Herter admitted.
But if America goes ahead with
this program, not only will peace
i ful co-existence be possible, but
| the world will be better for all
people,” he concluded.

Herter suggested that the
strength of the free world bo
pooled through the European
Economic Community, popularly
called the Common Market.
He called the success of the
common market revolutionary
and phenomenal. “It is much
more than customs union—it is a
political and economic amalga
mation,” Herter said.
The member nations have
grown economically far faster
than the United States and Brit
ain, he said. Britain’s failure to
keep pace has forced her to join,
Herter noted.
“The Common Market is the
beginning of a free trade area;
in five to six years it will be com
pletely a free trade area,” he said.
“It was in this way that the 13
original states agreed to estab
lish free trade.”
“Now Europe is following suit
with an area equal to our own
and a poulation one-third larger.”
The United States would be
playing into the hands of the
Communists if she followed a
course of protectionism and iso
lationism or tried to rival the
Common Market in production,
Herter said.
A return to isolationism would
render the U.S. incapable of meet
ing the challenge of the underde
veloped world, “and this is a chal
lenge wo can’t afford to lose,” he
said. “It will take great strength
and resources.”
The high - standard -of - living
group of nations that make up
the free world are too small in
number (one-sixth of the world’s
population) and occupy too little
of the earth’s surface to fight
among themselves, Herter warn
ed. “This is precisely what the
Soviets would like to see.”
The Soviets are intent on gain
ing control of the world and
would accomplish this by means
other than war, Herter said. Their
program is to keep the free world
split and absorb the uncommitted
or underdeveloped nations by cap
italizing on their poverty, he
stated.
The Communists define peace
ful co-existence as total absence
of all elements of the cold war,
but with their statements such as
“your grandchildren will live un
der Communism” this kind of
peaceful co-existence is impossi
ble, Herter said.
“The worst possible thing
would be to make the free-world
trade partnership a “rich man’s
club,” he warned. “The benefits
must be extended to all free
countries, ho declared.
“We arc at a cross road,” Her
ter solemnly said. “This year or
the next will be the year of de
cision. A trade partnership is
what we need. The sui’vival of the
country depends on it.”
Some of our industries wmuld
be hurt; sacrifices and readjust
ments in our thinking would be
required: political institutions
would have to be rebuilt; and we
would have to submit ourselves
to some arbitral body that may
rule against us, Herter admitted.
But if America goes ahead with
this program, not only will peace
i ful co-existence be possible, but
| the world will be better for all
people,” he concluded.

CHRISTIAN HERTER met Arroyo house officers (from left) Shelby
Maclntyre, Steve Hurlbut and Phil DeBarros last night at a rectption
held at Arroyo before his speech last night.
If the United States refuses to combine its resources with the
free nations of the world our alliances such as the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization will break up and peaceful co-existence will
be impossible.
This was the warning former Secretary of State Christian

Herter gave an overflow crowd in
Memorial Auditorium at I he open
ing of the fifth annual Foreign
Policy Institute.
“If the strength of the free
world can be pooled, then we have
a chance,” Herter said. “Peaceful
co-existence with the limited
definition of no active war—will
be possible. The satellite nations
and perhaps even European Rus
sia herself will break away from
Communism.”

Herter was given a rousing
standing ovation by the crowd of
FPI members and Tuesday Eve
ning Series spectators. Some 100
students, unable to find seats,
lined the walls to hear the man
who was our secretary of State
in 1959-60.
A loud-speaker carried the
speech outside the Auditorium
where a crowd of more than 200
huddled in the cool night, after
the doors to Memorial Auditori

render the U.S. incapable of meet
ing the challenge of the underde
veloped world, “and this is a chal
lenge wo can’t afford to lose,” he
said. “It will take great strength
and resources.”
The high - standard -of - living
group of nations that make up
the free world are too small in
number (one-sixth of the world’s
population) and occupy too little
of the earth’s surface to fight
among themselves, Herter warn
ed. “This is precisely what the
Soviets would like to see.”
The Soviets are intent on gain
ing control of the world and
would accomplish this by means
other than war, Herter said. Their
program is to keep the free world
split and absorb the uncommitted
or underdeveloped nations by cap
italizing on their poverty, he
stated.
The Communists define peace
ful co-existence as total absence
of all elements of the cold war,
but with their statements such as
“your grandchildren will live un
der Communism” this kind of
peaceful co-existence is impossi
ble, Herter said.
“The worst possible thing
would be to make the free-world
trade partnership a “rich man’s
club,” he warned. “The benefits
must be extended to all free
countries, ho declared.
“We arc at a cross road,” Her
ter solemnly said. “This year or
the next will be the year of de
cision. A trade partnership is
what we need. The sui’vival of the
country depends on it.”
Some of our industries wmuld
be hurt; sacrifices and readjust
ments in our thinking would be
required: political institutions
would have to be rebuilt; and we
would have to submit ourselves
to some arbitral body that may
rule against us, Herter admitted.
But if America goes ahead with
this program, not only will peace
i ful co-existence be possible, but
| the world will be better for all
people,” he concluded.

CHRISTIAN HERTER met Arroyo house officers (from left) Shelby
Maclntyre, Steve Hurlbut and Phil DeBarros last night at a rectption
held at Arroyo before his speech last night.
If the United States refuses to combine its resources with the
free nations of the world our alliances such as the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization will break up and peaceful co-existence will
be impossible.
This was the warning former Secretary of State Christian

Herter gave an overflow crowd in
Memorial Auditorium at I he open
ing of the fifth annual Foreign
Policy Institute.
“If the strength of the free
world can be pooled, then we have
a chance,” Herter said. “Peaceful
co-existence with the limited
definition of no active war—will
be possible. The satellite nations
and perhaps even European Rus
sia herself will break away from
Communism.”

Herter was given a rousing
standing ovation by the crowd of
FPI members and Tuesday Eve
ning Series spectators. Some 100
students, unable to find seats,
lined the walls to hear the man
who was our secretary of State
in 1959-60.
A loud-speaker carried the
speech outside the Auditorium
where a crowd of more than 200
huddled in the cool night, after
the doors to Memorial Auditori
um were closed.
Herter suggested that the
strength of the free world bo
pooled through the European
Economic Community, popularly
called the Common Market.
He called the success of the
common market revolutionary
and phenomenal. “It is much
more than customs union—it is a
political and economic amalga
mation,” Herter said.
The member nations have
grown economically far faster
than the United States and Brit
ain, he said. Britain’s failure to
keep pace has forced her to join,
Herter noted.
“The Common Market is the
beginning of a free trade area;
in five to six years it will be com
pletely a free trade area,” he said.
“It was in this way that the 13
original states agreed to estab
lish free trade.”
“Now Europe is following suit
with an area equal to our own
and a poulation one-third larger.”
The United States would be
playing into the hands of the
Communists if she followed a
course of protectionism and iso
lationism or tried to rival the
Common Market in production,
Herter said.
A return to isolationism would
render the U.S. incapable of meet
ing the challenge of the underde
veloped world, “and this is a chal
lenge wo can’t afford to lose,” he
said. “It will take great strength
