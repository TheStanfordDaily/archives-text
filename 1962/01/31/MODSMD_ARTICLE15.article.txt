# Mankind Takes a Tiny Step Forward
## 
### 
Willi all the problems facing our divided world and its citizens,
it is a relief to turn occasionally to an event which all men can
admire and regard as a step forward for mankind.
Such a step will come—weather permitting—in less than two
weeks when astronaut John Glenn becomes the United States’
first spaceman.

While politicians and generals can be counted on to spont
quotes about the greatness of the U.S. and its space program and
how this brings us “even” with the Russians, the most important
result of Glenn’s trip, whenever lie takes it, will be the quiet pride
and accompanying exhilaration that man has once again pushed
forward at the greatest frontier and challenge he has ever faced
—outer space.

To our mind, the luckiest men of all time are Titov, Gagarin,
Glenn and the other men who will follow them into space. We feel
sorry for those who ask why man should spend money on space
programs. The day when he doesn’t will be the day when he has
lost the inner drive which makes him climb mountains, explore the
Amazon, fly the Atlantic alone or probe the ocean depths. Scien
tific reasons? Of course. But without the basic inner drive man
would lead a dull life and eventually lose interest in living.
The words of this anonymous poem put it well:

Look up, look up, you sons of man, for there is much to do;
Go probe the outer reaches, and break the barriers through
Launch your star-ships upward, at twice the speed of light;
Ride herd upon the comets, in the pastures of the night.

Go ride the cosmic chaparral, and eat galactic dust;
Go throw a loop around the stars and tow them home to us
Bring in your new found spices, from the Indies of the sky,
And build us stellar light-houses to steer the future by.
