## Castro and Castroism 
### 
The Castro problem is how to
deal with a hostile regime with
out using military force to over
throw it. The Foreign Ministers
at Punta del Este have been seek
ing the beginning of a solution for
that problem. Castro has no
avowed and quite certainly no
genuine sympathizers and sup
porters among the governments
of the American republics. But
there has been an important divi
sion of view as to what it is wise
and expedient to do about him.
The division, as we have learn
ed, is between the republics which
lie on the shores of the Caribbean
facing Cuba and, with the rather
special exception of Mexico, the
big countries of South America
which are a long way by sea or
land from the troubled Caribbean.
I would venture a guess that
this geography explains the the
oretical differences between the
so-called soft and hard positions
at the conference. The Caribbean
countries, which have taken the
hard line, are physically within
reach of Cuba. The distances by
sea and air are fairly short, and
it is rather easy for Castro’s revo
lutionists to infiltrate countries
around the Caribbean, to do gun
running to local rebel bands
among them.
BUT THE BIG South American
countries, which are separated
from Cuba in the Caribbean by
the Andes Mountains, the jungles,
and the great hump of Brazil, are
not directly threatened by armed
intervention. For them the danger
of Castro comes primarily from
his legend as the Robin Hood who
has robbed the rich to help the
poor.
Castro does send propaganda
and agitators into southern South
America. He uses diplomatic fa
cilities of Europen and Asian na
tions which are sympathetic with
him. But all this activity is of
little consequence as compared
with the legend of Castroism, the
legend that Castro is the friend of
the poor.
The “soft” group of govern
ments have acted as they have
acted not because they want to

help Castro, and not because they
are afraid to anger him, but be
cause they know that legends are
not destroyed by strong adjec
tives. The legend would not be
dissolved by breaking diplomatic
relations and driving Castro en
tirely into the underground. The
legend would not be destroyed by
economic embargoes especially
since Cuba has no important
trade with Latin America.
FROM OUR POINT of view it
would have been a calamity if we
had forced the issue to a point
where with the backing of the
weakest part of Latin America
we overrode the views of the
strongest part. It would have been
a calamity to win such a victory
because it would have split the
inter-American system, with twice
as many Latin Americans op
posed to us as were with us.
What we really needed, and
perhaps have gotten, is that a
preponderant majority of our
American neighbors state clearly
that Castro and Castroism are
hostile to the inter-American sys
tem. When that is achieved, the
practical question of what to do
about Castro is not a matter of
words or of sanctions. It is a
matter of coordinated and coop
erative counter-espionage in this
hemisphere. That must be largely
a secret operation in order to
identify and frustrate subversive
agents. It cannot be done with a
brass band and a television cam
era but only by close working ar
rangements among the govern
ments.
Effective counter-espionage can
deal with Castro’s interventions
in this hemisphere. It will not and
cannot deal with his legend, with
Castroism. Counter-espionage will
not save the corrupt dictator
ships that still remain. It will not
save the incompetent democra
cies. And while there must be
counter-espionage to make sure
that Castro minds his own busi
ness in Cuba, it is no substitute
for doing what the Alliance for
Progress has promised to do.

the Andes Mountains, the jungles,
and the great hump of Brazil, are
not directly threatened by armed
intervention. For them the danger
of Castro comes primarily from
his legend as the Robin Hood who
has robbed the rich to help the
poor.
Castro does send propaganda
and agitators into southern South
America. He uses diplomatic fa
cilities of Europen and Asian na
tions which are sympathetic with
him. But all this activity is of
little consequence as compared
with the legend of Castroism, the
legend that Castro is the friend of
the poor.
The “soft” group of govern
ments have acted as they have
acted not because they want to

help Castro, and not because they
are afraid to anger him, but be
cause they know that legends are
not destroyed by strong adjec

dissolved by breaking diplomatic
relations and driving Castro en
tirely into the underground. The
legend would not be destroyed by
economic embargoes especially
since Cuba has no important
trade with Latin America.
FROM OUR POINT of view it
would have been a calamity if we
had forced the issue to a point
where with the backing of the
weakest part of Latin America
we overrode the views of the
strongest part. It would have been
a calamity to win such a victory
because it would have split the
inter-American system, with twice
as many Latin Americans op
posed to us as were with us.
What we really needed, and
perhaps have gotten, is that a
preponderant majority of our
American neighbors state clearly
that Castro and Castroism are
hostile to the inter-American sys
tem. When that is achieved, the
practical question of what to do
about Castro is not a matter of
words or of sanctions. It is a
matter of coordinated and coop
erative counter-espionage in this
hemisphere. That must be largely
a secret operation in order to
identify and frustrate subversive
agents. It cannot be done with a
brass band and a television cam
era but only by close working ar
rangements among the govern
ments.
Effective counter-espionage can
deal with Castro’s interventions
in this hemisphere. It will not and
cannot deal with his legend, with
Castroism. Counter-espionage will
not save the corrupt dictator
ships that still remain. It will not
save the incompetent democra
cies. And while there must be
counter-espionage to make sure
that Castro minds his own busi
ness in Cuba, it is no substitute
for doing what the Alliance for
Progress has promised to do.

The Castro problem is how to
deal with a hostile regime with
out using military force to over
throw it. The Foreign Ministers
at Punta del Este have been seek
ing the beginning of a solution for
that problem. Castro has no
avowed and quite certainly no
genuine sympathizers and sup
porters among the governments
of the American republics. But
there has been an important divi
sion of view as to what it is wise
and expedient to do about him.
The division, as we have learn
ed, is between the republics which
lie on the shores of the Caribbean
facing Cuba and, with the rather
special exception of Mexico, the
big countries of South America
which are a long way by sea or
land from the troubled Caribbean.
I would venture a guess that
this geography explains the the
oretical differences between the
so-called soft and hard positions
at the conference. The Caribbean
countries, which have taken the
hard line, are physically within
reach of Cuba. The distances by
sea and air are fairly short, and
it is rather easy for Castro’s revo
lutionists to infiltrate countries
around the Caribbean, to do gun
running to local rebel bands
among them.

a calamity to win such a victory
because it would have split the
inter-American system, with twice
as many Latin Americans op
posed to us as were with us.
What we really needed, and
perhaps have gotten, is that a
preponderant majority of our
American neighbors state clearly
that Castro and Castroism are
hostile to the inter-American sys
tem. When that is achieved, the
practical question of what to do
about Castro is not a matter of
words or of sanctions. It is a
matter of coordinated and coop
erative counter-espionage in this
hemisphere. That must be largely
a secret operation in order to
identify and frustrate subversive
agents. It cannot be done with a
brass band and a television cam
era but only by close working ar
rangements among the govern
ments.
Effective counter-espionage can
deal with Castro’s interventions
in this hemisphere. It will not and
cannot deal with his legend, with
Castroism. Counter-espionage will
not save the corrupt dictator
ships that still remain. It will not
save the incompetent democra
cies. And while there must be
counter-espionage to make sure
that Castro minds his own busi
ness in Cuba, it is no substitute
for doing what the Alliance for
Progress has promised to do.
