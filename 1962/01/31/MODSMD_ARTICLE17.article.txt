## The 						Radical Right—What Is It? 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
first of (wo articles dealing with
the extreme right movement. The

sociology. The second article will
appear tomorrow.)
By JOHN HOWARD
Every society needs conserva
tives. There should always be a
balance between those oriented
toward tradition and those with
a more dynamic, innovative ap
proach. A predominance of either
outlook is undesirable. Conserva
tism alone may lead to stagnation
while a dynamic approach not re
strained by a counterposed con
servatism may lead to lack of
stability. No one, then can ques
tion the need for reasonable and
responsible conservatives. Robert
Taft, Congressman John Lindsey
and Sen. Jacob Javits are exam
ples of conservatives who fall into
this category. Taft, more than a
decade after his death, is still
honored.
The activities of the radical
right (or more accurately, the
rabid right) differ in several rath
er striking ways from those of
more responsible conservatives.
For example, a truly remark
able list of persons, groups and
movements have been charged by
the rabid right with being impli
cated in a Communist plot to sun
vert America. Among them are
the following:
1. THE CATHOLIC priesthood.
Robert Welch in a speech in Gar
den City, New York, on Oct. 9,
1961, claimed that one and one
half per cent of the priests in the
country were Communists who
had become priests in order to
subvert the Calholic hierarchy.
When challenged on the matter
he admitted that he had pulled
the figure out of a hat.

2. The mental health movement
is, according to the right-wing
American Mercury, part of a plot
to bring about “a collectivist
world government through an in
sidious misuse of the meaning of
mental health.”
3. Urban renewal is said to be
a clever scheme to Sovietize
America by bringing more and
more private properly into the
hands of the government.
4. The movement for fluorida
tion of water is alleged to be tied
in with the mental health move
ment, both supposedly being in
dicative of the fact that “some
thing very sinister is happening
to our Republic.”
5. THE MOVIES “Exodus” and
“Spartacus” are both allegedly
“propaganda vehicles for the cur
rent parly line.”
6. The American Civil Liberties
Union is charged not only with
being a Communist-front organi
zation, but with being the one
which is “the most active in
plaguing the nation with oblique
attacks on American institutions
and constitutional safeguards.”
7. The New York Times and
New York Herald Tribune Sun
day book review sections are iden
tified as part of the plot by virtue
of the fact that they allegedly at
tempt to propagate “the views of
international Socialists to the ex
clusion and suppression of all
counteracting material.”
8. The National Student Asso
ciation is implicated by virtue of
the fact that it supposedly pushes
“collectivist policies.”
9. THE STATE Department is
said to be full of “enemy agents
and pro-Communist influences.”
10. Fair Trade laws, which are
designed to prevent underselling
by business firms have been iden

lified as part of a plot to main
tain inflation.
11. The United Nations Educa
tional, Scientific and Cultural Or
ganization has been identified by
a segment of the rabid right as
“the greatest subversive plot in
history.” (Here the World Feder
alists share guilt with the Com
munists.)

12. The Protestant clergy gets
the smear-brush in a booklet en
titled “The National Council of
Churches Indicts Itself on Fifty
Counts of Treason to God and
Country.”
THE LIST could go on and on
and would include such things as
the federal income tax which is
said to be “one of the steps the
Communists chart to take over a
country,” integration which is al
leged to be a deliberate plot to
“mongrelize” the nation, and re
cent versions of the Bible which
are said to be the works of Com
munists who want to pervert the
Gospel.
The distinguishing thing about
current right-wing movements is
that for the first time in years
they are well-organized and are
having some degree of success in
recruiting members at the grass
roots level. It has been estimated
that there are over 1,000 such
groups in the country; however,
most, are sweaty, transient little
affairs. Relatively few are im
portant in the current resurgence
of the rabid right.
Let us deal with three of these.
1.) THE CHRISTIAN Anti-
Communism Crusade is led by
Fred Schwarz, a 48-year-old, Au
stralian-born, one-time Baptist lay
preacher. He purports to be well
read and is cleverer than the
leaders of some of the other
movements. Schwarz, like his co
horts on the right, is rather gen
erous in terms of what he chooses
to define as communism. Al
though we would have to con
clude from his book “You Can
Trust The Communists” that any
or all of the 180,000,000 citizens
in the Republic may be Commu
nists, he especially identifies as
liable to be Communist, or at
least subject to Communist influ
ence, militant labor unions, pa
cifist and peace groups and lib
erals (particularly those found in
universities). He feels that the
charge regarding the Protestant
clergy is true and that more than
7,000 of them are guilty.
He claims that his “school” is
intended to inform the citizenry
about communism. To accomplish
this task he has assembled such
“experts” on the subject as
George Murphy, the former tap
dancer, W. Cleon Skousen, former
Salt Lake City chief of police—of
whom J. Braken Lee ex-governor
to Utah is said to have written,
“He is a master of half-truths
and would not hesitate to convey
an outright lie if he felt it would
further his personal ambitions
• .He was not only a wasteful,
extravagant public servant as
shown by the record, but he mis
spent and misused public funds
that were entrusted to him . . .
He is a first class ‘phony’.”
and Congressman Walter Judd of
Minnesota whose competence can
be measured by the fact that he
has asserted that “the Bolshoi
ballet is part and parcel of the
Communist conspiracy."
SCHWARZ HAS denied that he
is a right-winger, but others think
he is. For instance, Robert Welch,
fuhrer of the John Birch Society,
has observed that “The Fred
Schwarz schools have already
done a superb job of laying the
ground work for us . . . ” The
admiration is mutual, Schwarz
having observed that “ . . . there
may be a few individuals in it

who have carried some things to |
extremes, but tiie important |
thing is that the John Birch So
ciety is fighting communism
. . . I think we can be proud of
the John Birch Society and the
good work it is doing In the great
battle against communism.”

Tomorrow we will look at the
'roup for whom Schwarz has
;uch admiration.

tified as part of the plot by virtue
of the fact that they allegedly at
tempt to propagate “the views of
international Socialists to the ex
clusion and suppression of all
counteracting material.”
8. The National Student Asso
ciation is implicated by virtue of
the fact that it supposedly pushes
“collectivist policies.”
9. THE STATE Department is
said to be full of “enemy agents
and pro-Communist influences.”
10. Fair Trade laws, which are
designed to prevent underselling
by business firms have been iden

lified as part of a plot to main
tain inflation.
11. The United Nations Educa
tional, Scientific and Cultural Or
ganization has been identified by
a segment of the rabid right as
“the greatest subversive plot in
history.” (Here the World Feder
alists share guilt with the Com
munists.)

12. The Protestant clergy gets
the smear-brush in a booklet en
titled “The National Council of
Churches Indicts Itself on Fifty
Counts of Treason to God and
Country.”
THE LIST could go on and on
and would include such things as
the federal income tax which is
said to be “one of the steps the
Communists chart to take over a
country,” integration which is al
leged to be a deliberate plot to
“mongrelize” the nation, and re
cent versions of the Bible which
are said to be the works of Com
munists who want to pervert the
Gospel.
The distinguishing thing about
current right-wing movements is
that for the first time in years
they are well-organized and are
having some degree of success in
recruiting members at the grass
roots level. It has been estimated
that there are over 1,000 such
groups in the country; however,
most, are sweaty, transient little
affairs. Relatively few are im
portant in the current resurgence
of the rabid right.
Let us deal with three of these.
1.) THE CHRISTIAN Anti-
Communism Crusade is led by
Fred Schwarz, a 48-year-old, Au
stralian-born, one-time Baptist lay
preacher. He purports to be well
read and is cleverer than the
leaders of some of the other
movements. Schwarz, like his co
horts on the right, is rather gen
erous in terms of what he chooses
to define as communism. Al
though we would have to con
clude from his book “You Can
Trust The Communists” that any
or all of the 180,000,000 citizens
in the Republic may be Commu
nists, he especially identifies as
liable to be Communist, or at
least subject to Communist influ
ence, militant labor unions, pa
cifist and peace groups and lib
erals (particularly those found in
universities). He feels that the
charge regarding the Protestant
clergy is true and that more than
7,000 of them are guilty.
He claims that his “school” is
intended to inform the citizenry
about communism. To accomplish
this task he has assembled such
“experts” on the subject as
George Murphy, the former tap
dancer, W. Cleon Skousen, former
Salt Lake City chief of police—of
whom J. Braken Lee ex-governor
to Utah is said to have written,
“He is a master of half-truths
and would not hesitate to convey
an outright lie if he felt it would
further his personal ambitions
• .He was not only a wasteful,
extravagant public servant as
shown by the record, but he mis
spent and misused public funds
that were entrusted to him . . .
He is a first class ‘phony’.”
and Congressman Walter Judd of
Minnesota whose competence can
be measured by the fact that he
has asserted that “the Bolshoi
ballet is part and parcel of the
Communist conspiracy."
SCHWARZ HAS denied that he
is a right-winger, but others think
he is. For instance, Robert Welch,
fuhrer of the John Birch Society,
has observed that “The Fred
Schwarz schools have already
done a superb job of laying the
ground work for us . . . ” The
admiration is mutual, Schwarz
having observed that “ . . . there
may be a few individuals in it

who have carried some things to |
extremes, but tiie important |
thing is that the John Birch So
ciety is fighting communism
. . . I think we can be proud of
the John Birch Society and the
good work it is doing In the great
battle against communism.”

Tomorrow we will look at the
'roup for whom Schwarz has
;uch admiration.

By JOHN HOWARD
Every society needs conserva
tives. There should always be a
balance between those oriented
toward tradition and those with
a more dynamic, innovative ap
proach. A predominance of either
outlook is undesirable. Conserva
tism alone may lead to stagnation
while a dynamic approach not re
strained by a counterposed con
servatism may lead to lack of
stability. No one, then can ques
tion the need for reasonable and
responsible conservatives. Robert
Taft, Congressman John Lindsey
and Sen. Jacob Javits are exam
ples of conservatives who fall into
this category. Taft, more than a
decade after his death, is still
honored.
The activities of the radical
right (or more accurately, the
rabid right) differ in several rath
er striking ways from those of
more responsible conservatives.
For example, a truly remark
able list of persons, groups and
movements have been charged by
the rabid right with being impli
cated in a Communist plot to sun
vert America. Among them are
the following:
1. THE CATHOLIC priesthood.
Robert Welch in a speech in Gar
den City, New York, on Oct. 9,
1961, claimed that one and one
half per cent of the priests in the
country were Communists who
had become priests in order to
subvert the Calholic hierarchy.
When challenged on the matter
he admitted that he had pulled
the figure out of a hat.

2. The mental health movement
is, according to the right-wing
American Mercury, part of a plot
to bring about “a collectivist
world government through an in
sidious misuse of the meaning of
mental health.”
3. Urban renewal is said to be
a clever scheme to Sovietize
America by bringing more and
more private properly into the
hands of the government.
4. The movement for fluorida
tion of water is alleged to be tied
in with the mental health move
ment, both supposedly being in
dicative of the fact that “some
thing very sinister is happening
to our Republic.”
5. THE MOVIES “Exodus” and
“Spartacus” are both allegedly
“propaganda vehicles for the cur
rent parly line.”
6. The American Civil Liberties
Union is charged not only with
being a Communist-front organi
zation, but with being the one
which is “the most active in
plaguing the nation with oblique
attacks on American institutions
and constitutional safeguards.”
7. The New York Times and
New York Herald Tribune Sun
day book review sections are iden
tified as part of the plot by virtue
of the fact that they allegedly at
tempt to propagate “the views of
international Socialists to the ex
clusion and suppression of all

universities). He feels that the
charge regarding the Protestant
clergy is true and that more than
7,000 of them are guilty.
He claims that his “school” is
intended to inform the citizenry
about communism. To accomplish
this task he has assembled such
“experts” on the subject as
George Murphy, the former tap
dancer, W. Cleon Skousen, former
Salt Lake City chief of police—of
whom J. Braken Lee ex-governor
to Utah is said to have written,
“He is a master of half-truths
and would not hesitate to convey
an outright lie if he felt it would
further his personal ambitions
• .He was not only a wasteful,
extravagant public servant as
shown by the record, but he mis
spent and misused public funds
that were entrusted to him . . .
He is a first class ‘phony’.”
and Congressman Walter Judd of
Minnesota whose competence can
be measured by the fact that he
has asserted that “the Bolshoi
ballet is part and parcel of the
Communist conspiracy."
SCHWARZ HAS denied that he
is a right-winger, but others think
he is. For instance, Robert Welch,
fuhrer of the John Birch Society,
has observed that “The Fred
Schwarz schools have already
done a superb job of laying the
ground work for us . . . ” The
admiration is mutual, Schwarz
having observed that “ . . . there
may be a few individuals in it

who have carried some things to |
extremes, but tiie important |
thing is that the John Birch So
ciety is fighting communism
. . . I think we can be proud of
the John Birch Society and the
good work it is doing In the great
battle against communism.”

Tomorrow we will look at the
'roup for whom Schwarz has
;uch admiration.

By JOHN HOWARD
Every society needs conserva
tives. There should always be a
balance between those oriented
toward tradition and those with
a more dynamic, innovative ap
proach. A predominance of either
outlook is undesirable. Conserva
tism alone may lead to stagnation
while a dynamic approach not re
strained by a counterposed con
servatism may lead to lack of
stability. No one, then can ques
tion the need for reasonable and
responsible conservatives. Robert
Taft, Congressman John Lindsey
and Sen. Jacob Javits are exam
ples of conservatives who fall into
this category. Taft, more than a
decade after his death, is still
honored.
The activities of the radical
right (or more accurately, the
rabid right) differ in several rath
er striking ways from those of
more responsible conservatives.
For example, a truly remark
able list of persons, groups and
movements have been charged by
the rabid right with being impli
cated in a Communist plot to sun
vert America. Among them are
the following:
1. THE CATHOLIC priesthood.
Robert Welch in a speech in Gar
den City, New York, on Oct. 9,
1961, claimed that one and one
half per cent of the priests in the
country were Communists who
had become priests in order to
subvert the Calholic hierarchy.
When challenged on the matter
he admitted that he had pulled
the figure out of a hat.

2. The mental health movement
is, according to the right-wing
American Mercury, part of a plot
to bring about “a collectivist
world government through an in
sidious misuse of the meaning of
mental health.”
3. Urban renewal is said to be
a clever scheme to Sovietize
America by bringing more and
more private properly into the
hands of the government.
4. The movement for fluorida
tion of water is alleged to be tied
in with the mental health move
ment, both supposedly being in
dicative of the fact that “some
thing very sinister is happening
to our Republic.”
5. THE MOVIES “Exodus” and
“Spartacus” are both allegedly
“propaganda vehicles for the cur
rent parly line.”
6. The American Civil Liberties
Union is charged not only with
being a Communist-front organi
zation, but with being the one
which is “the most active in
plaguing the nation with oblique
attacks on American institutions
and constitutional safeguards.”
7. The New York Times and
New York Herald Tribune Sun
day book review sections are iden
tified as part of the plot by virtue
of the fact that they allegedly at
tempt to propagate “the views of
international Socialists to the ex
clusion and suppression of all
counteracting material.”
8. The National Student Asso
ciation is implicated by virtue of
the fact that it supposedly pushes
“collectivist policies.”
9. THE STATE Department is
said to be full of “enemy agents
and pro-Communist influences.”
10. Fair Trade laws, which are
designed to prevent underselling
by business firms have been iden

lified as part of a plot to main
tain inflation.
11. The United Nations Educa
tional, Scientific and Cultural Or
ganization has been identified by
a segment of the rabid right as
“the greatest subversive plot in
history.” (Here the World Feder
alists share guilt with the Com
munists.)

12. The Protestant clergy gets
the smear-brush in a booklet en
titled “The National Council of
Churches Indicts Itself on Fifty
Counts of Treason to God and
Country.”
THE LIST could go on and on
and would include such things as
the federal income tax which is
said to be “one of the steps the
Communists chart to take over a
country,” integration which is al
leged to be a deliberate plot to
“mongrelize” the nation, and re
cent versions of the Bible which
are said to be the works of Com
munists who want to pervert the
Gospel.
The distinguishing thing about
current right-wing movements is
that for the first time in years
they are well-organized and are
having some degree of success in
recruiting members at the grass
roots level. It has been estimated
that there are over 1,000 such
groups in the country; however,
most, are sweaty, transient little
affairs. Relatively few are im
portant in the current resurgence
of the rabid right.
Let us deal with three of these.
1.) THE CHRISTIAN Anti-
Communism Crusade is led by
Fred Schwarz, a 48-year-old, Au
stralian-born, one-time Baptist lay
preacher. He purports to be well
read and is cleverer than the
leaders of some of the other
movements. Schwarz, like his co
horts on the right, is rather gen
erous in terms of what he chooses
to define as communism. Al
though we would have to con
clude from his book “You Can
Trust The Communists” that any
or all of the 180,000,000 citizens
in the Republic may be Commu
nists, he especially identifies as
liable to be Communist, or at
least subject to Communist influ
ence, militant labor unions, pa
cifist and peace groups and lib
erals (particularly those found in
universities). He feels that the
charge regarding the Protestant
clergy is true and that more than
7,000 of them are guilty.

For example, a truly remark
able list of persons, groups and
movements have been charged by
the rabid right with being impli
cated in a Communist plot to sun
vert America. Among them are
the following:
1. THE CATHOLIC priesthood.
Robert Welch in a speech in Gar
den City, New York, on Oct. 9,
1961, claimed that one and one
half per cent of the priests in the
country were Communists who
had become priests in order to
subvert the Calholic hierarchy.
When challenged on the matter
he admitted that he had pulled
the figure out of a hat.

2. The mental health movement
is, according to the right-wing
American Mercury, part of a plot
to bring about “a collectivist
world government through an in
sidious misuse of the meaning of
mental health.”
3. Urban renewal is said to be
a clever scheme to Sovietize
America by bringing more and
more private properly into the
hands of the government.
4. The movement for fluorida
tion of water is alleged to be tied
in with the mental health move
ment, both supposedly being in
dicative of the fact that “some
thing very sinister is happening
to our Republic.”
5. THE MOVIES “Exodus” and
“Spartacus” are both allegedly
“propaganda vehicles for the cur
rent parly line.”
6. The American Civil Liberties
Union is charged not only with
being a Communist-front organi
zation, but with being the one
which is “the most active in
plaguing the nation with oblique
attacks on American institutions
and constitutional safeguards.”
7. The New York Times and
New York Herald Tribune Sun
day book review sections are iden
tified as part of the plot by virtue
of the fact that they allegedly at
tempt to propagate “the views of
international Socialists to the ex
clusion and suppression of all
counteracting material.”
8. The National Student Asso
ciation is implicated by virtue of
the fact that it supposedly pushes
“collectivist policies.”
9. THE STATE Department is
said to be full of “enemy agents
and pro-Communist influences.”
10. Fair Trade laws, which are
designed to prevent underselling
by business firms have been iden

lified as part of a plot to main
tain inflation.
11. The United Nations Educa
tional, Scientific and Cultural Or
ganization has been identified by
a segment of the rabid right as
“the greatest subversive plot in
history.” (Here the World Feder
alists share guilt with the Com
munists.)

12. The Protestant clergy gets
the smear-brush in a booklet en
titled “The National Council of
Churches Indicts Itself on Fifty
Counts of Treason to God and
Country.”
THE LIST could go on and on
and would include such things as
the federal income tax which is
said to be “one of the steps the
Communists chart to take over a
country,” integration which is al
leged to be a deliberate plot to
“mongrelize” the nation, and re
cent versions of the Bible which
are said to be the works of Com
munists who want to pervert the
Gospel.
The distinguishing thing about
current right-wing movements is
that for the first time in years
they are well-organized and are
having some degree of success in
recruiting members at the grass
roots level. It has been estimated
that there are over 1,000 such
groups in the country; however,
most, are sweaty, transient little
affairs. Relatively few are im
portant in the current resurgence
of the rabid right.
Let us deal with three of these.
1.) THE CHRISTIAN Anti-
Communism Crusade is led by
Fred Schwarz, a 48-year-old, Au
stralian-born, one-time Baptist lay
preacher. He purports to be well
read and is cleverer than the
leaders of some of the other
movements. Schwarz, like his co
horts on the right, is rather gen
erous in terms of what he chooses
to define as communism. Al
though we would have to con
clude from his book “You Can
Trust The Communists” that any
or all of the 180,000,000 citizens
in the Republic may be Commu
nists, he especially identifies as
liable to be Communist, or at
least subject to Communist influ
ence, militant labor unions, pa
cifist and peace groups and lib
erals (particularly those found in
universities). He feels that the
charge regarding the Protestant
clergy is true and that more than
7,000 of them are guilty.
He claims that his “school” is
intended to inform the citizenry
about communism. To accomplish
this task he has assembled such
“experts” on the subject as
George Murphy, the former tap
dancer, W. Cleon Skousen, former
Salt Lake City chief of police—of
whom J. Braken Lee ex-governor
to Utah is said to have written,
“He is a master of half-truths
and would not hesitate to convey
an outright lie if he felt it would
further his personal ambitions
• .He was not only a wasteful,
extravagant public servant as
shown by the record, but he mis
spent and misused public funds
that were entrusted to him . . .
He is a first class ‘phony’.”
and Congressman Walter Judd of
Minnesota whose competence can
be measured by the fact that he
has asserted that “the Bolshoi
ballet is part and parcel of the
Communist conspiracy."
SCHWARZ HAS denied that he
is a right-winger, but others think
he is. For instance, Robert Welch,
fuhrer of the John Birch Society,
has observed that “The Fred
Schwarz schools have already
done a superb job of laying the
ground work for us . . . ” The
admiration is mutual, Schwarz
having observed that “ . . . there
may be a few individuals in it

who have carried some things to |
extremes, but tiie important |
thing is that the John Birch So
ciety is fighting communism
. . . I think we can be proud of
the John Birch Society and the
good work it is doing In the great
battle against communism.”

Tomorrow we will look at the
'roup for whom Schwarz has
;uch admiration.

By JOHN HOWARD
Every society needs conserva
tives. There should always be a
balance between those oriented
toward tradition and those with
a more dynamic, innovative ap
proach. A predominance of either
outlook is undesirable. Conserva
tism alone may lead to stagnation
while a dynamic approach not re
strained by a counterposed con
servatism may lead to lack of
stability. No one, then can ques
tion the need for reasonable and
responsible conservatives. Robert
Taft, Congressman John Lindsey
and Sen. Jacob Javits are exam
ples of conservatives who fall into
this category. Taft, more than a
decade after his death, is still
honored.
The activities of the radical
right (or more accurately, the
rabid right) differ in several rath
er striking ways from those of
