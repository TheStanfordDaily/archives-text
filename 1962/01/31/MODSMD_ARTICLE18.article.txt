NUCLEAR TESTS
Editor, The Daily:
Senator Humphrey, in reply to
a question Monday afternoon, ar
gued in favor of the resumption
of atmospheric nuclear testing by
the U.S. that (1) The small
amount of fallout from the big
Russian explosion indicated that
the Russians had developed an
improved triggering device; we
must resume testing to stay
abreast of such developments.
(2) Improvement in the Soviet
arsenal makes it imperative that
we develop defensive (anti-mis
sile) missiles. Senator Humphrey
said that in general the Soviet
tests showed that they had made
great technical advances.
I. F. Stone’s Weekly of Jan. 15
reports on a lecture delivered by
Dr. Hans Bethe at Cornell on
Jan. 5. In this lecture Dr. Bethe
revealed that the relative clean
liness of the large Russian ex
plosion was not due to any great
ly improved triggering device but
was due to the encasement of the
bomb in lead. Dr. Bethe also said
that he believed that really effec
tive AICBMs (anti-intercontinen
tal ballistic missiles) are impos
sible and that “nothing has been
changed fundamentally by the
Russian tests.”
Dr. Bethe was the head of a
committee of scientists which re
ported to the President and the
National Security Council on the
significance of the Soviet tests
early in December.

RUSHING PLANS
Editor, The Daily:
As spring quarter rushing plans
are being made, let us not lose
sight of what makes it all pos
sible; the “no contact” rule. So
well has it worked that I recom

mend not only continuing it, but
extending it progressively in an
obvious manner—a sequence of
four phases.
Phase one: no contact between
fraternity men and frosh women.
This reform would be pushed by
(he more innate of our frosh men,
if they weren’t so innate. (I am
not so naive as to think such
things as “pocket pinning” would
not go on at first, but certainly
the IFC would soon put it to an
end with its usual, harsh, effec
tive punishments of offending
houses.
Phase two: no contact between
any men and any women. Some
people would argue that Stanford,
in general, has been pushing
toward this end for many years.
Phase three; no contact among
any students. Existing rooms
could easily he partitioned into
cozy cubicles. Shut off from the
bother of the outside world, the
student would have more time to
study (What else could he do in
a cozy cubicle?), and he would
have an excuse for being the apa
thetic isolationist he already is.
Phase four: no contact between
student and teacher (to even
greater an extent than at pres
ent). This ultimate goal, the
promise of Stanford’s future, is
so close to being realized that in
our own time we may not have
to go to classes.

houses.
Phase two: no contact between
any men and any women. Some
people would argue that Stanford,
in general, has been pushing
toward this end for many years.
Phase three; no contact among
any students. Existing rooms
could easily he partitioned into
cozy cubicles. Shut off from the
bother of the outside world, the
student would have more time to
study (What else could he do in
a cozy cubicle?), and he would
have an excuse for being the apa
thetic isolationist he already is.
Phase four: no contact between
student and teacher (to even
greater an extent than at pres
ent). This ultimate goal, the
promise of Stanford’s future, is
so close to being realized that in
our own time we may not have
to go to classes.

NUCLEAR TESTS
Editor, The Daily:
Senator Humphrey, in reply to
a question Monday afternoon, ar
gued in favor of the resumption
of atmospheric nuclear testing by
the U.S. that (1) The small
amount of fallout from the big
Russian explosion indicated that
the Russians had developed an
improved triggering device; we
must resume testing to stay
abreast of such developments.
(2) Improvement in the Soviet
arsenal makes it imperative that
we develop defensive (anti-mis
sile) missiles. Senator Humphrey
said that in general the Soviet
tests showed that they had made
great technical advances.
I. F. Stone’s Weekly of Jan. 15
reports on a lecture delivered by
Dr. Hans Bethe at Cornell on
Jan. 5. In this lecture Dr. Bethe
revealed that the relative clean
liness of the large Russian ex
plosion was not due to any great
ly improved triggering device but
was due to the encasement of the
bomb in lead. Dr. Bethe also said
that he believed that really effec
tive AICBMs (anti-intercontinen
tal ballistic missiles) are impos
sible and that “nothing has been
changed fundamentally by the
Russian tests.”
Dr. Bethe was the head of a
committee of scientists which re
ported to the President and the
National Security Council on the
significance of the Soviet tests
early in December.

RUSHING PLANS
Editor, The Daily:
As spring quarter rushing plans
are being made, let us not lose
sight of what makes it all pos
sible; the “no contact” rule. So
well has it worked that I recom

mend not only continuing it, but
extending it progressively in an
obvious manner—a sequence of
four phases.
Phase one: no contact between
fraternity men and frosh women.
This reform would be pushed by
(he more innate of our frosh men,
if they weren’t so innate. (I am
not so naive as to think such
things as “pocket pinning” would
not go on at first, but certainly
the IFC would soon put it to an
end with its usual, harsh, effec
tive punishments of offending
houses.
Phase two: no contact between
any men and any women. Some
