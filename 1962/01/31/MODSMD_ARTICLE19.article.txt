# OUR MAN ON THE FARM

### Glenn Alford 
This column is dedicated to those most dedicated of all sports
fans, the brave men and women who watch intramural football.
The intramural fan is not unlike most of the students on the
Stanford campus. He is often the manager of one team and is scout
ing his next week’s competition. He can be someone who happens to
he down by the intramural football fields and sees a crowd milling
around and decides to investigate.
But more often, lie is a football fan who enjoys watching the
unusual, and the unusual is common-place in intramural football.

The Mural Action Was Weird

This year’s intramural football action provided some of the
weirdest games of them all.
In one game involving a team that hadn’t scored in two years

and another team that finished
second in its league, I lie low-scor
ing outfit decided to bring in a
ringer to enhance its chances. The
ringer was a first-string end on
the frosh football team.
This team scored twice on 60-
yard passes to the ringer in (he
first two minutes of tlie game.
The other outfit fought back and
won in the last minute of action
by two small points, thus proving
that crime doesn’t pay.
Another oddity was (he eventu
al mural football champion,
SR AC. (The initials stand for
Santa Rosa Athletic Club and
don’t ask me why. I SRAC was
horn for the express purpose of
winning the intramural football
title. Whoever dreamed up the
idea did his work well. Some of
the speediest members of the uni
versity joined SRAC. Among

these was grad student Keith (q e phones j n the Mural Schedule
rhomassen, who was an entrant
in the Olympic Trials of the 400 meters held at Stanford two years
ago.
Other members included Craig Barrett, 10-flat sprinter, John
Nourse, high hurdles winner in last year's Big Meet, and Boh Besse,
also a former member of the Stanford track team.

SRAC Didn't Lose a Game

SRAC went through the season undefeated. Their biggest win
W'as a one touchdown triumph over Law. The winning touchdown
was the most remarkable feature of a remarkable intramural season,
SRAC was on the one-yard line, when a bad center cost them 39 yards
and put them back on the midfield stripe. The next play was a
touchdown pass from Mike Bertolet to Thomassen that put them on
the road to the title.
Other mural oddities were the rebirth of the T-formation by
Junipero, and the most odd ball outfit of the year, Los Arcos. Arcos,
which finished second in the Eating Club League, ended up in the
semi-finals of the university playoffs.
The mural football fan starts his day by scanning the mural
schedule given to The Daily every morning by Mural Director Elwyn
Bugge, and selecting a game that meets his particular mood. He also
makes a second choice, for the first game picked may not be much
of a contest.
At about 4 p.m., just a few minutes before game-time, he starts
for the field and arrives seconds before the game is scheduled to
begin. The mural fan usually goes to the game without a favorite,
but after watching one series of downs for each team, he has his
mind made up.
During the game, the fan keeps his vocal cords in tune, with
constant abuse directed at the referee and support for his chosen
team.
After the game, the fan goes back to his residence with his
frustrations removed, ready to attack a more important foe than a
mural football foe, a hook.
