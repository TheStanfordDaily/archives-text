# LASSU OK's Request For Stern Improvement
## 
### 
Legislature has unanimously passed a resolution requesting
“high priority” consideration for a list of Stern Hall physical im
provements by the Board of Trustees at its February meeting.
The resolution, addressed to President Sterling, also was sent
to various deans and University officials. It reads:

“Whereas: The administrators
of the University have displayed
a genuine interest in furthering
the development of the house sys
tem,” and “ the elected stu
dent representatives and the resi
dent assistants of the Stern
houses compiled and submitted,
in December 1961, a list of priori
ty projects for the improvement
of the physical environment of
the Stern houses.” and “ . . . the
list of priority projects has been
approved by the requisite Univer
sity officials and committees and
now awaits the consideration of
the Board of Trustees.” and “Due
to a crowded agenda, this item
was not considered at the Janu
ary meeting of the Board . . .
Legislature . . . requests that
the physical improvement list of
the Stern houses be given high
priority on the agenda for the
February meeting of the Board
of Trustees.”
808 PHILIBOSIAN, the Stern
representative to LASSU, said the
improvements probably would
cost about $36,000.
One of the main projects is a
room for Holladay House which
would be used for formal and in
formal social occasions. Also on
the list are “quiet, comfortably
furnished” rooms “for study and
reading” in Fremont and Larkin
Houses.
A MUIR ROOM, similar to the
Holladay one. also will bo built.
Drapes for Serra and Donner
lounges are another item on the
list. A juke box room in Lassen
House, to bo shared by the entire
hall, is planned. The idea hero is
to give a place for “ad hoc” danc
ing.
A similar room would be built
in Donner House. Money also is
asked for courtyard furniture, the
report to Stern Director A1 Low
onstein calling the courtyards
“one of our greatest untapped re
sources.”
Work on four of the eight
dining rooms also is included in
the request, as is money to paint
the halls in Burbank House. The
house will supply the labor if the
University supplies the paint.
