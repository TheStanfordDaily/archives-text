BATTLE CRY
“Remember the Alamo,” was the
ringing cry that put a million Amer
icans in uniform and sent them to
fight and die at Gettysburg, Moss
Landing etc.
“Remember yonr Automotive
Transmission Specialist,” is another
great American shout. While it
may not be as well known as that
other one it has much meaning to
us here at Automotive Specialists
(901 Alma, Palo Alto, DA 1-2256) .
We feel that only by making you
conscious of the needs of your
automatic transmission will we be
able to stay in business. There are
several important do’s and don’ts”
in regard to their care.
(1) Don’t take it anywhere else for
adjustment. (2) Don’t take it any
where else for repairs. (3) Don’t
take it anywhere else for seals. (4)
Don’t take it anywhere else for fluid.
(5) Don’t take it anywhere else for
fun. (6) Don’t take it anywhere
else for exchange, as the Stanford
Daily Staff urges you, so we urge
you, “Re Careful,” if you can't be
careful, bring It to ns for those last
minute replacements and removal
of badly worn parts (or misplaced
parts (within reason, of course).
