# Stanford Foreign Students an 'Undeveloped Resource'
## 
### WERNER WARMBRUNN 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: At the request of the
Stanford Today and Tomorrow Committee,
Dr. Warmhriiim wrote this article about the
foreign student program at Stanford. Dr.
Warmbninn is Stanford's foreign student ad
viser.)

Foreign students are Stanford’s most
precious undeveloped resource. Stanford’s
potential wealth is dazzling. With over 500
foreign students from 64 countries located on
every continent, and 9,000 "native” students,
Stanford has an annual potential of 4.5 mil
lion contacts between American and foreign
students. An airplane ticket to the capitals of
these 64 countries alone would cost at least
$2,520, or twice Stanford's annual tuition.
And yet, in the past, this potential wealth

has been tapped only to a minor extent. This
is particularly ironic in view of the increas
ingly large amounts of money spent on
travel abroad each summer. The entire world
can be explored in four years at Stanford, at
the cost of a dime for coffee at the Cellar, or
the price of a dinner at a residence or a
luncheon discussion group at the Interna
tional Center.
There are many reasons for this failure
in communication, not altogether peculiar
to Stanford. Some are inherent in the nature
of the foreign student program, and cannot
be changed by students or staff. But some
fundamental psychological obstacles to in
ternational communication can be changed
by those who desire to do so. It is on an
analysis of these obstacles that I wish to

concentrate in this article.
THE BASK’ OBSTACLE to cross-cultural
communication within the young American
is his anxiety over his own adequacy and
identity which forces him to stick closely to
patterns of behavior acceptable to his refer
ence group, and to shun experiences which
might earn him its disapproval. The basic
mechanisms at work have been described by
Riesman and others under the labels of “con
formity” and "other-dlrectedness.” Conform
ity pressures are especially potent at Stan
ford since the peer reference group is par
ticularly homogeneous, essentially drawn
from a narrow segment of West Coast, sub
urban middle-class society. This situation is
conducive to a peculiar parochialism of
values, The academic pressures described so

well by Dr. Black in his recent paper make
social conformity especially important so
that the student can at least earn and retain
social approval when the academic experi
ence produces intensive questioning of one’s
own worth.
Coupled with this anxiety is the self-con
cern and selfishness which growing up in our
society requires of adolescents and young
adults. This is a time to find a profession, a
mate and, in general, a mode of operation in
the adult world. There is little time for, and
some fear of, involvement in strange or
stressful experiences, and association with
others who might be upsetting to the quest
for identity, the most important job at hand.
This pressure leads to a narrowing of per
spective and a lowering of sights in individu

als, as it does in society as a whole, as shown
by the McCarthy Era and the current rise of
right-wing extremism.
THESE PRESSURES ARK a part of be
coming an adult in this society and are not
presented in this article as negative criticism.
What makes this situation destructive of
communication, however, is the unwilling
ness to recognize and face the inherent dif
ficulty, the inner conflict, and to use the in
sight gained from an understanding of the
basic forces at work to transcend the boun
daries of self and culture. This kind of in
sight does not happen often enough, al
though it is happening increasingly. The
most common pattern of reaction to foreign
students remains a curious contradiction be-
tween a benign Rotarianism
(“Let us have more foreign stu
dents” and "Okay, you guys, why
not have another ASSU scholar
in the house next year”) which
approves of the foreign student
in the abstract, and a rather po
lite indifference to the individual
foreign student in real-life situa
tions.
The most clear-cut expression
of this ambivalence, however, is
apparent in often mildly deroga
tory comments about the Inter
national Center and other inter
national operations and particu
larly in the negative reaction to
the American who associates
freely with foreign students, of
ten because he has sufficient au
tonomy to make this choice. Such
American students are often
pigeon-holed as bohemian, “odd
ball” or maladjusted. This is a
rather striking reaction in view
of the fact that a recent uncom
pleted research study comparing
a group of American girls mak
ing substantial use of the Inter
national Center to their room
mates showed only two major
differences: the former group
had superior grades and College
Board Scores as well as a strong
er degree of dissatisfaction with
the intellectual climate of the
dormitories. Negativism toward
marginal (superior or inferior)
groups is of course typical of the
reaction of any majority living
under great internal or external
stress.
THESE INNER difficulties of
American students are not the
only obstacle to encounters with
foreign students. The fears and
inner difficulties of foreign stu
dents play fully as important a
role as those of their American
counter parts, although they tend
to be more situational and exter
nal, and are discussed more free
ly. Other obstacles may be listed
as follows:
1. The Age Difference. Eighty
per cent of the foreign students
are graduates and the average
age of these students is 26 years.
How many undergraduates main
tain close friendships with Ameri
cans six to eight years their sen
ior?
2. Cultural Differences. What
is there to talk about with a man
just arrived from Katmandu
(“And where is THAT?”)? He
doesn’t know much about football
or dating, or the World Series or
even Riesman or Henry Miller for
that matter. Nor do I, Bob Jones,
know much about Kashmir, King
Mahendra’s coup d’etat, the mer
its of the Mekong River Project,
of the problem of language and
nationhood in India. And I, Bob
Jones, am really afraid to get in
volved 100 deeply with this
strange character, and I, Sri
Singh, want a real friend quite
badly in this bewildering new
place.
3. Language. Many foreign stu
dents do not know English well
enough to carry on a meaningful
conversation. In some instances,
language may remain a subtle
barrier for many years.
4. Dormitory Arrangements.
Stanford has dormitory space in
the autumn for only a small frac
tion of new foreign students.
Since many good contacts are
made in dormitories, communica
tion suffers.
5. The Ratio, For better or
worse, much of the “discourse”
in college, at all levels, takes
place between men and women.
On a campus where the competi
tion for women is exacting and
full of rigors, the fact that the
foreign student ratio is not 2:1
or 3:1, but 8:1 (!) makes it par
ticularly difficult for foreign
students to develop the desired
contacts.
There are many reasons why
we should overcome these ob
stacles to communication: The
foreign student, too, can help us
with the important process of
self discovery, although on a dif
ferent plane than the roommate
from Walla Walla. More and
more among us will study and
work abroad for a good part of
our lives. Our survival as a na
tion may depend to some extent
on our capacity to communicate
with people from other cultures.
And if we are ever to acquire
this capacity for cross-cultural
communication, what better place
is there than Stanford, which has
become a true world campus, a
microcosm of the world-at-large.
This is an opportunity which
should be captured now since it
may never return.
This brings us to the point
where we can take a look at what
is being done currently and what

can be done in the future to pro
mote cross-cultural encounters on
the campus. The present program
is complex hut could be improved.
THE FOREIGN student is in
vited by the Community Commit
tee for International Students to
come to Stanford 10 days before
the September registration to live
with a local family, hopefully his
family-for-the-year. The Host
Committee of the HR arranges
an orientation and social program
for the last four days of this peri
od with lectures and discussions
on the academic system, univer
sity services, social customs and
student activities. On registration
day. the Host Committee helps
new foreign students through the
first-registration haze and maze,
a vitally important service.
During the regular school year,
the I-Cluh offers weekly Friday
afternoon coffee hours, attended
by hundreds of students. It or
ganizes a weekly Saturday night
‘‘Evening Abroad," which is the
only regularly-scheduled weekend
open house on campus. The I-Club
also holds Friday night dances
three times a quarter. The I-Cen
ter organizes Sunday night Inter
national Dinners and runs small
luncheon discussion groups, nor
mally every day of the week, at
which American-foreign student
groups discuss topics ranging
from “Race Problems and the
American Image Abroad” to the
“Economics of Developing Coun
tries.” The discussion groups of
the YWCA traditionally have in
cluded many foreign students.
The Host Committee of the HR
organizes panels on alternate Fri
day nights and a continuing host
service at the I-Center.

During weekends and vacations,
trips are organized to such di
verse locations as Carmel, Yosem
ite and (he Grand Canyon. In all
of these, participation of Ameri
can students is an important in
gredient of success.

THESE ORGANIZED activities
offer plenty of opportunities for
American students to associate
with foreign students; but dor
mitories, dining rooms, eating
clubs and fraternities, as well as
the International Center, offer
other good chances for unorgan
ized and casual associations with
students from overseas.
What about the future? Most
fundamental of all, and more cru
cial than any organizational ar
rangement, is the necessity to
find for oneself inner freedom
and autonomy to associate with
strangers who may become
friends. In the second place, we
should continue to develop new
opportunities for informal con
tacts between American and for
eign students. The recently de
veloped lunch and dinner invita
tion program sponsored by the
HR could become one of the most
important steps forward in recent
years. The time may arrive when
all foreign students who express
a desire to do so may eat with
undergraduates as “International
Associates.”
Finally, wo must make better
use of the existing programs and
facilities which have been de
scribed. It is particularly impor
tant to maintain ties with con
genial foreign students because

they usually seek more sustained
relationships than young Ameri
cans who have grown up in the
most highly mobile society in the
world.
This article has stressed a vari
ety of utilitarian reasons for
cross-cultural associations, such
as self-development and the criti
cal need for international under
standing. Yet there is a danger in
laying too much stress on these
utilitarian motivations. The most
satisfying relationship will bo
that which is sought for its own
sake, for the joy and warmth of
an association with another
unique individual. And it is
through such a dual motivation
that international friendships on
the campus should increasingly
develop. There is good reason to
hope that such meaningful inter
cultural encounters will become
as much a part of a Stanford edu
cation as a summer abroad or a
term at an overseas center. When
this happens, Stanford’s foreign
resources will be fully developed.
