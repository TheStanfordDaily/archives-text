# Stanford Foreign Students an 'Undeveloped Resource'

Dr. Warmhriiim wrote this article about the
foreign student program at Stanford. Dr.

Foreign students are Stanford’s most
precious undeveloped resource. Stanford’s
potential wealth is dazzling. With over 500
foreign students from 64 countries located on
every continent, and 9,000 "native” students,
Stanford has an annual potential of 4.5 mil
lion contacts between American and foreign
students. An airplane ticket to the capitals of
these 64 countries alone would cost at least
$2,520, or twice Stanford's annual tuition.
And yet, in the past, this potential wealth

has been tapped only to a minor extent. This
is particularly ironic in view of the increas
ingly large amounts of money spent on
travel abroad each summer. The entire world
can be explored in four years at Stanford, at
the cost of a dime for coffee at the Cellar, or
the price of a dinner at a residence or a
luncheon discussion group at the Interna
tional Center.
There are many reasons for this failure
in communication, not altogether peculiar
to Stanford. Some are inherent in the nature
of the foreign student program, and cannot
be changed by students or staff. But some
fundamental psychological obstacles to in
ternational communication can be changed
by those who desire to do so. It is on an
analysis of these obstacles that I wish to

concentrate in this article.
THE BASK’ OBSTACLE to cross-cultural
communication within the young American
is his anxiety over his own adequacy and
identity which forces him to stick closely to
patterns of behavior acceptable to his refer
ence group, and to shun experiences which
might earn him its disapproval. The basic
mechanisms at work have been described by
Riesman and others under the labels of “con
formity” and "other-dlrectedness.” Conform
ity pressures are especially potent at Stan
ford since the peer reference group is par
ticularly homogeneous, essentially drawn
from a narrow segment of West Coast, sub
urban middle-class society. This situation is
conducive to a peculiar parochialism of
values, The academic pressures described so

well by Dr. Black in his recent paper make
social conformity especially important so
that the student can at least earn and retain
social approval when the academic experi
ence produces intensive questioning of one’s
own worth.
Coupled with this anxiety is the self-con
cern and selfishness which growing up in our
society requires of adolescents and young
adults. This is a time to find a profession, a
mate and, in general, a mode of operation in
the adult world. There is little time for, and
some fear of, involvement in strange or
stressful experiences, and association with
others who might be upsetting to the quest
for identity, the most important job at hand.
This pressure leads to a narrowing of per
spective and a lowering of sights in individu

als, as it does in society as a whole, as shown
by the McCarthy Era and the current rise of
right-wing extremism.
THESE PRESSURES ARK a part of be
coming an adult in this society and are not
presented in this article as negative criticism.
What makes this situation destructive of
communication, however, is the unwilling
ness to recognize and face the inherent dif
ficulty, the inner conflict, and to use the in
sight gained from an understanding of the
basic forces at work to transcend the boun
daries of self and culture. This kind of in
sight does not happen often enough, al
though it is happening increasingly. The
most common pattern of reaction to foreign
students remains a curious contradiction be-
