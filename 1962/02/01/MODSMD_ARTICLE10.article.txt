The Free University of West
Berlin was founded in 1948 by
about 500 students and professors
who revolted against Soviet inter
ference with academic freedom
at the Humboldt University in
East Berlin.
THE BEGINNINGS of the
school, today one of Germany’s
leading universities, were rather
inauspicious. Classes were first
held in an old house in a resi
| dential suburb. The few chairs
available had to be carried from
room to room. During the block
ade, evening lectures were given
by candlelight.
A Henry Ford Foundation
giant financed the first univer
sity building. Other institutes
j and schools continue to grow
j around it. making the FU the only
German university with a “cam
pus” today.
Students were responsible for
the founding of the university,
and today’s 12,000 FU students
continue to have a strong influ
ence in university policy-making,
a situation unique in German uni
versities.
Stanford’s affiliation with the
FU began in 1949, when money
for urgently needed books, cloth
ing, and shoes was collected.
Since then the two schools have
exchanged students and profes
sors regularly.
