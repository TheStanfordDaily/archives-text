# Russian Secrecy Termed Main Bar To Disarmament
## 
### BILL BEPPY 
The greatest obstacle to nuclear
disarmament is the Soviets’ love
of secrecy. This was the opinion
of both U.S. Ambassador Arthur

Dean and Stanford physicist W.
K. H. Panofsky at last night’s

Foreign Policy Institute session
in Memorial Auditorium.
However, Dean, U.S. represent
ative at the Geneva disarmament
talks, and Panofsky, chairman of
the President’s panel on nuclear
testing and director of Project M,
agreed that disarmament is in
deed possible.
“I believe an agreement can be
made which will maintain the se
curity of both sides,” Panofsky
said. “If we are unwilling to ac
cept the military risks involved
we are inviting catastrophe.”
ACCORDING TO Panofsky the
United States clearly must choose
from three alternatives: 1) con
tinuation of the arms race with
the goal of achieving military su
periority; 21 complete unilateral
disarmament or pacifism; and 3)
gradual disarmament by negoti
ation. He believes the latter is the
only sensible course.
Dean said agreement with the
USSR is possible hut: “it’s not
going to be easy to work out—it
may take many months and many
years before our military and
their military and our scientists
and their scientists agree.”
No inspection system is fool
proof, Dean said. But, he added,
the odds of success are sufficient
ly good that we must accept them
and go forward in working out
disarmament.
Til 10 SOVIETS propose that
both sides report the amount of
their arms and liquidate a frac

tion of this total, permitting in
spection only of the arms to be
destroyed, Panofsky said.
Although this is contrary to
U.S. proposals, Panofsky said he
felt it would be safe to agree to
their plan without harm to our
security. This would improve re
lations between the opposing
sides, he maintained.

Why would this plan without
adequate inspection not harm our
security? Because, Panofsky as
serted, the Soviets would not dare
to falsify to any significant ex
tent their initial report on the ex
tent of their arms.
IF THEY overstate, they will
have to liquidate more arms than
they need to, he explained. If
they understate, they will fear
that we consider them militarily
weak and that we might attack
them.
However, after this first move
the secrecy of the Soviet world
would have to be reduced, Panof
sky said.
But the Soviets resist inspec
tion, Dean said. “They believe
one of their greatest assets is se
crecy and say so frankly.”
However, he continued, the
Russians are beginning to realize
that if the armaments race is not
stopped it is quite possible that
by miscalculation “we might blow
each other up or blow ourselves
up.”
“Most citizens are tired of hear
ing about disarmament negotia
tions,” Panofsky said.
THERE ARE three main rea
sons why they have always failed,
he added: 1) neither side under
stands fully what a disarmed
world would be like—an interna
tional police force would be re
quired. 2 1 mutual trust is impos
sible when both sides feel the
threats of superbombs and 3) the
military policies of both sides are
undefined.
Panofsky said that a proposal
to disarm both the United States
and the USSR region by region
might be the basis for future pro
grams. Under this plan disarma
ment progresses as secrecy de
creases.
No proposal, he said, would got
the unanimous backing of the
U.S. government. We will have to
leave to the President and his
advisors the task of achieving our
goals, he suggested.
