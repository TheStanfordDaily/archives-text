# Strange People of The 20th Century

Ever get the feeling that somewhere, somehow, the United
States has discarded some pretty important values while traveling
the path of international conflict? This feeling hit us yesterday
after reading two different news items sent out of Washington by
United Press International.
One, buried deep in the inside pages of the’ metropolitan papers,
read in part:
“The Senate Armed Services Committee was told yesterday that
the Army plans a 67 per cent increase in spending to expand its
chemical and biological warfare program to counter Communist
advances.
“Lieutenant General Arthur G. Trudeau, head of the Army’s re
search and development program, said ‘chemical and biological
weapons and defense’ continue to receive major and increasing
emphasis.’ ”
The other, which got somewhat better play, told how President
Kennedy had asked Congress for authority to purchase $lOO million
of the $2OO million in United Nations bonds being offered to lift
the world parliament out of its financial hole. It noted that a sur
prising amount of opposition to the request was developing in
Congress, and that the plan might face very tough going—and might
not even pass.
Unfortunately, this is fairly indicative of the level to which
our national morals have sunk. That the U.S. is developing in
credible methods of waging chemical and biological warfare and
has a stock of such weapons doesn’t raise any stir. Anyone who has
read one of the few articles detailing the types of germ “bombs”
and fantastic gases our scientists and militarists have come up with
knows that the program is much larger than most people realize,
and that the generals really do plan to use these weapons if war
breaks out—if they have the time to launch them.
Yet our lawmakers sit in Washington and debate whether we
should support the U.N. simply because we may not agree with
all it does. The fact that this organization, despite its frequent
ineffectiveness, is the only body dedicated to working for peace and
the only one where all nations can meet together and try to hash
out their problems—and therefore must be saved—apparently isn’t
as important to some of our Congressmen as the fact that it has
done something they don’t agree with.
Its a futile wish, but we still would like to see someone in
Washington with the moral courage to close down the Army’s
burgeoning chemical and biological warfare factory, and turn their
money over to something useful—such as purchasing U.N. bonds.
But, as we say, somewhere in the past our national values under
went a change, and we became able to rationalize (“to counter
Communist advances’) the existence of such things as nuclear
weapons and inhuman chemical and biological weapons, while at
the same time questioning whether we should support the United
Nations.
If there are any future historians, they should have an interesting
time explaining the actions of those strange people of the 20th
century.
