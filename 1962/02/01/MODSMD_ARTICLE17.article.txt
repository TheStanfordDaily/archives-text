# Students Say English Dept. Article 'Failed'
## 
### George Calvert Kinnear William E. Sheidley 
It is unfortunate that the Stu
dent Committee on Academic Af
fairs, which announced such com
mendable aims and purposes in
last Monday’s Daily, failed so not
ably in its first article, a criticism
of the Stanford English Depart
ment. The article manifests a
lack of thoroughness in investiga
tion, is uniformly vague in direct
ing its criticism and in suggesting
improvements, and is based upon
an incomplete and superficial con
ception of the study of literature.
Certainly an understanding of
the content of a work of litera
ture and an aesthetic response to
it are the final goals of reading.
But to achieve these goals it is
necessary to master the histori
cal, philosophical, and religious
setting of a given work, and the
intellectual and stylistic tradition
of which it is a part. This is sub
stantially the Stanford English
Department’s approach to the
teaching of literature.
SURVEY COURSES ARE de
signed not to fascinate students,
but to pi’ovide them with this nec
essary back ground material.
What the lecturers appear to lack
in inspirational quality they more
than make up for with consider
able knowledge and insight. In
each lecture course the students
benefit from the professor’s largo
and specialized experience in his
field. Contrary to the opinion ex
pressed by the student commit
tee, the courses as presented have
developed and been modified as
the lecturer has embodied in them
his own and others’ new work.
Specifically concerning survey
courses, it might be of value to
both student and teacher if the
lectures were reduced in number
and limited to background and

critical material. This would
make the student responsible for
applying the principles he has
learned to the specific work, free
ing the teacher from time con
suming explication of simple
texts.

The student committee seems
justified in suggesting that more
courses in modern literature be
offered and that they be recog
nized as fulfilling major field re
quirements. However, it must be
remembered that an understand
ing of the development of literary
forms and traditions is necessary
even to the student specializing
in contemporary literature. He
could not fail to lose by neglect
of any other period.
THE STUDENT COMMITTEE
demands that the English Depart
ment as a whole adopt the semi
nar system used for creative writ
ing courses. Seminars are a spe
cialized teaching tool, applied
quite effectively in creative writ
ing. They are designed primarily
as workshops, where students
write and discuss stories. Simi
larly, the senior seminars re
quired in English Literature and
recommended in American Liter
ature are projects in original
scholarship and criticism in which
each student writes a paper on a
different aspect of a certain gen
eral subject.
The newly formed English
Honors Program, neglected by
the student committee report,
also provides the opportunity for
small groups of students to dis
cuss their reading with teachers.
This provides an excellent com
plement to the lectures. Present
faculty limitations prevent fur
ther expansion of this program.
Student effort would be well spent
in persuading the administration
to provide more teachers in an at
tempt to approach the ideal tu
torial system.
