# A 						Nobel Peace Prize Trip
## 
### HARLAN ROBINSON 
Stanford has had many Nobel
Prize winners in science, and now
an unusual distinction has been
conferred on a member of the fac
ulty in connection with the No
bel Peace Prize.

Assistant Dean of Men Allard
K. Lowenstein, who is offering a
course in African government and
politics this quarter, recently re
turned from Oslo where, at the
request of Chief Albert Luthuli,
he served as a member of the
Nobel Peace Prize winner’s staff.
Lowenstein, who serves as di
rector of Stern Hall, received his
L. from Yale, was president
of the U.S. National Student As
sociation, has served as legisla
tive assistant to U.S. Sen. Frank
Graham, as foreign policy assist
ant to Sen. Hubert Humphrey,
and was a delegate to the 1960
Democratic National Convention.
IN THE SUMMER of 1959, at
the behest of representatives of
South West African tribes who
had escaped to the U.N., he and
two companions wont to South
West Africa to gather informa
tion clandestinely about the man
agement of this international ter
ritory. The South African govern
ment has refused to permit any
investigation of conditions in the
territory. On a previous visit to
South Africa Lowenstein had be
come involved with South Afri
cans opposed to the South Afri
can government and had met
Chief Luthuli.
After returning from South
West Africa Lowenstein and his
companions testified before the
Fourth Committee of the U.N. on
behalf of the South West African
tribes. He has now completed a
book, “Brutal Mandate,” about
the situation in southern Africa.
The South African government,
in issuing Chief Luthuli his pass
port, forbid him from leaving
Oslo. For this reason Oslo was the
site of a considerable gathering of
people prominent in the opposi
tion to the South African govern
ment. In charge of Chief Luthuli’s
staff was Oliver Tambo, deputy
president of the now-illegal Afri

can National Congress, of which
Chief Luthuli has been president.
Tambo was selected by the A.N.C.
to leave South Africa after the
Sharpeville massacre in order to
organize the fight abroad.
GUNNAR .lAHN, chairman of
the Nobel Peace Prize committee,
in presenting the award to Chief
Luthuli, said:
“Albert John Luthuli’s struggle
has been waged within the bor
ders of his own country: yet the
issues raised are of far wider im
port. He brings a message to all
who work and strive to establish
respect for human rights udhin
the various nations of the world
and also between nations.
“Should the non-white popula
tion of South Africa ever arise
from their position of humiliation
without having recourse to vi
olence and terror, then this will
be due above all to Luthuli, their
fearless and incorruptible loader
who, thanks to his noble personal
qualities, has rallied his people in
support of this policy, a man who
throughout his adult life has
staked everything and suffered
everything without bitterness and
without allowing hatred and ag
gression to oust his abiding love
of his fellow-men.
"Should, however, the day
dawn when the struggle of the
non-whites in South Africa to win
their freedom degenerates into
bloody slaughter, then Luthuli’s
voice will be heard no more. But
in that evil hour let us remember
that his path was unswerving
and clear. This was not his will.”
LOWENSTEIN’S ENTHUSI
ASM about Chief Luthuli seems
to be even greater than that of
Jahn. In an interview, he also ex
pressed great admiration for
Tambo; he feels that the two men
are cut from the same cloth. He
added that Chief Luthuli was
very moved by a deluge of con
gratulatory messages received
from Americans. Many of these
messages resulted from a cam
paign organized by the "Friends
of Luthuli,” a group founded by
Stanford students Ed Haley and
Harlan Robinson.

Lowenstein expressed concern

for the Chief's future in light of
the treatment he has received at
the hands of the South African
government in the past decade.
The Chief has been banished to a
remote village where he must re
main when not in jail.
The Stanford dean reported
that the Chief’s impact on the
people of Scandinavia was extra
ordinary. Many Norwegian offi
cials said that no previous prize
winner had made so great an im
pression. The Luthulis charmed
everyone with whom they came
in contact.
While in Oslo the Chief deliver
ed three major addresses. At the
end of his formal lecture the
Chief burst spontaneously into
the anthem of the African Na
tional Congress. The audience of
800, including the King and the
Norwegian Parliament, rose and
remained standing while the
Chief and his wife left the hall.
The Chief's third address, deliv
ered from the outside balcony of
the city hall, was heard by 20.000
people, including 2000 students
bearing torches, in seven-degree
weather.
DURING HIS STAY in Oslo,
Lowenstein conferred with offi
cials of several Scandinavian
countries, including the chairman
of the foreign relations committee
and leaders of opposition parties
of the Norwegian Parliament. As
a result of these discussions
Lowenstein is optimistic about
the possibility of the Scandinavi
an countries supporting economic
sanctions against South Africa in
the U.N. in the near future.
He asserts in “Brutal Mandate”
that “the present state of affairs
in southern Africa is as immoral
as any in the world today.” He is
convinced that economic pressure
on South Africa is the only re
maining hope of bringing about
“a peaceful and humane resolu
tion of this situation . . . How
long,” he asks, “can the outside
world insist that South Africans
must be nonviolent at the same
time that it excuses itself from
supporting nonviolence on the
grounds that it is futile against
the South African government?”
