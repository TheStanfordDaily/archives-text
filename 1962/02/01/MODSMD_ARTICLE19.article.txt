BASKETBALL TICKETS
Editor, The Daily:
In an attempt to purchase bas
ketball tickets in advance to the
Stanford-Santa Clara game, I
learned that tickets weren’t on
sale here.
Contacting the athletic depart
ment at Santa Clara the day of
the game, I was told that all re
served tickets were sold, but that
general admission tickets for
Stanford students would bo avail
able only at the gate in San Jose.
The Santa Clara officials told me
that they had not sent any student
tickets to Stanford simply be
cause Stanford’s Department of
Athletics had not requested any.
The ticket manager at the BAC
reported to me that none had been
requested because in previous
years Stanford students had not
shown any interest. Even this
year, she said, “there were only
three or four requests.”
Twenty-five men in my fra
ternity alone were interested in
buying advance tickets this year
had they been on sale.
With basketball interest higher
on the campus now than it has
been for several years (the Pa
vilion has been sold out several
times recently), would it have
been a dangerous financial gam
ble for Stanford to have request
ed 50 or even 100 tickets for sale
to accommodate student fans?
Isn’t this another typical ex
ample of administrative disregard
for undergraduate interests and
desires at Stanford?
