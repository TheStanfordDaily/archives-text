WASHINGTON (UPI) The
Treasury is considering offering
the public a new “education sav
ings bond’’ that would give par
ents and youngsters a special way
to save for the rapidly mounting
cost of going to college.
If issued, the new bond would
yield somewhat more than the
3% per cent now returned by Se
ries E and H bonds held to ma
turity. The bonds, which could be
offered through the payroll sav
ings plan, might be designated
Series “EE.”
In 1959 the Treasury considered
bringing out such a bond but j
dropped the plan in the face of I
opposition from key members of
Congress. The idea was revived
as part of a search for ways to
strengthen the savings bond pro
gram.
AN EDUCATION bond could j
help strengthen the program in
the face of new competition from |
banks for savings funds.
Under a Jan. 1 change in fed
eral regulations, banks may pay
up to 4 per cent interest on sav
ings deposits undisturbed for a
year or more. How much this
may hurt savings bonds will not
bo clear for several months.
If adopted and approved by
Congress, the education bonds
probably would be similar to
Series E bonds in that they would
be discount securities sold for j
less than their future redemption j
value.
