## 'Rabid Right' Movements Need Careful Observation 
### JOHN HOWARD 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
second of two articles on the radi
cal right-wing movement by a
graduate student in sociology.)

The John Birch Society was
founded in 1958 by a retired
Massachusetts candymaker
named Robert Welch (Welch’s
Fudge and Sugar Daddy). It has
chapters in something between 27
and 34 states with most of them
found in Texas. California, Michi
gan and Massachusetts appear to
have 20 to 35 chapters each with
the other' states trailing off with
fewer. The two major centers of
strength are greater Houston and
greater Los Angeles. Membership
in the organization has been esti
mated at 10,000 by the Anti-de
famation League in its publica
tion Facts and at 60,000 by Rep.
Hiestand testifying before the
House Rules Committee.
These figures are mentioned
only because the Society attempts
to carry through on the action
implications of the Christian Anti-
Communism Crusade. Welch ad
ises his people to infiltrate local
ivic groups, and as the Birch
efinition of communism is rath
- broad this has led to attacks
a wide variety of groups and
dividuals and to harassment of
cal school and library officials.
WELCH, LIKE A bloodhound
tee on the scent, never gives up.
. 'or example, he has not been de
terred from attacks upon the jus
tices of the Supreme Court as
Communists by the fact that they
have recently delivered opinions
which dealt rather harshly with
Communist plaintiffs. He ration
alizes these attacks by what he
calls the “principle of reversal.”
Basically this means that if a
m.-.n admits he is a Communist—
of course he is. If he denies it, he
is only hiding the fact.
It remains to be seen what the
effects on the movement will be
of (he fact that Welch has called
Dwight and Milton Eisenhower
Communists, attacked democracy
as “a weapon of demagogery and
a perennial fraud,” and boasted
of his dictatorial rule of the
group. Welch of course labels
criticism directed at him as Com
munist in inspiration. It is not
clear yet whether his followers
and potential followers buy this.
We, The People and the Chris
tian Crusade are run by a 36-ycar
old, roly-poly evangelist preacher
named Billy James Hargis. Billy
specializes in smiting “modern
ists,” “leftists,” “socialists” and
“Communists” in countless rallies
around the country where he oft
en speaks under banners emblaz
oned “For Christ, Against Com
munism.”
IT IS TO Billy that we owe the
revelation about the doubtful
loyalty of the Protestant clergy.
The publication of We, The Peo
ple, called “Free Enterprise,”
leads to the conclusion that the
“We” of the group’s title is con
fined to whites. The June 1961
issue of this publication recom
mends as good reading for real
Americans Gerald L. K. Smith’s
racist magazine The Cross and
the Flag, and the equally dubious
Common Sense.
In the September 1960 issue of
Free Enterprise we are informed
by one Revilo P. Oliver, one of its
contributors, that, “The Batista
Government in Cuba was not, to
be sure, a perfect government.
But it was probably as good a
government as one could reason
ably expect to find in an island
largely populated by mongrels.”
The Christian Crusade in addi
tion to fighting Bolshevism is
also involved in the sale of a food
supplement called “Nutrio-Bio.”

Hargis, when asked why a minis
ter of God should be peddling
drug products on the side, replied
that healthy bodies are as im
portant as healthy minds in fight
ing communism. The Food and
Drug Administration has taken
issue with him on the matter, at
least with regard to the question
of whether or not “Nutrio-Bio”
has anything to do with having
a healthy body, having seized
some of the vitamin pills and
tablets and charged the corpora
tion with making false and mis
leading health claims.
AS WITH THE John Birch So
ciety and the C.A.C.C. again we
see a tie-in between rabid right
organizations, Welch having ad
dressed a rally of Crusade stal
warts in 1961. In addition Hargis
is a member of the Committee of
Endorsers of the John Birch So
ciety.
It is unlikely that the rabid
right can be dismissed as a mere
pimple on the body politic. There
is a kind of Charles Adams hu
mor in the gyrations of some of
them, but unfortunately wo seem
increasingly to live in a Charles
Adams world. They pretend to be
the most fervent defenders of
American liberties, but the logic
of their position (and it has a
kind of Orwellian, Alice-in-Won
derland logic) of necessity leads
them to make ever more furious
attacks upon those liberties. That
this is true may be seen by re
ducing their position to the fol
lowing three basic tenets.
1. Almost any person or group
may be Communist.
2. Communism is a diabolical
and hateful thing.
3. Therefore one is justified in
using any means, however arbi
trary or unconstitutional, against
almost any one, if they serve the
purpose of rooting out and pun
ishing Communists.
IF EVEN THE mildest expres
sion of liberalism or any slightly
dissenting opinion can be attack
ed as Communist lies, and if it is
said that Communists have no
rights, then clearly no citizen can
rest secure in the knowledge that
he is protected by the laws; for if
the accusing finger is pointed at
him because he happens to be
lieve in mental health, or the
U.N., or peace, or the union move
ment, and if the fact of accusa
tion is used to deny him a fair
hearing or equal protection under
the law then clearly the laws
mean nothing.
Let us, then, look at some ex
amples of rabid right logic in ac
tion on the community level.
That nothing is s«fe from their
Orwellian logic is indicated in the
"Smiling Chinese” incident in San
Diego. One day last spring a
physical education teacher, noting
that it was I’ainy decided to show
his class a film rather than take
them outdoors. He checked a film
out of the Education Center and
showed it. The film happened to
deal with China. It showed some
Chinese children smiling. Now
San Diego’s rabid right apparent
ly reasoned as follows; China is
Communist. Communism is bad.
No one smiles when his situation
is bad, therefore, the Chinese
children in the film would not
have smiled of their own accord,
therefore their Communist over

lords must have made them smile
( perhaps by holding their parents
hostage or something like that),
therefore the film was a dirty
piece of Communist propaganda.
When the parents of some of the
children who had seen the film
found out that it had shown kids
under communism smiling they
protested to the board of educa
tion and the film was withdrawn.
THE PROBLEM IS not con
fined to Southern California.
When two staff members of
WOSU, the Ohio State University
radio station, played a record
"Song of Protest” whjch contain
ed pieces from the left, the right,
and the center, they were sus
pended because one of the songs
dealt with the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee with
something less than reverence.
When 30 faculty members of the
State University of New York
signed a petition against the Com
mittee the local rabid right cried
for an investigation of commu
nism at the school and apparently
had enough influence to have two
cops from the New York State
Bureau of Criminal Intelligence
sent out tc ihe campus. These
two gumshoes went around ques
tioning students about the 30 fac
ulty who had signed. At last re
port the 30 teachers were still at
school. (Apparently being a dull
lecturer is not yet a sign of one’s
disloyalty.)

The basic contempt of the rabid
right for the democratic processes
which they pretend to be defend
ing is revealed in an incident
which took place in Sunnyvale re
cently. Wilhelm Schmidt, Penin
sula representatice of the
C.A.C.C., who had attended a City
Council meeting along with Karl
Prussion, asked the council to
adopt a resolution requiring as
pirants for city office to sign
loyalty oaths before filing offici
ally as candidates. When City At
torney Frank Gillio pointed out
that election procedure cannot be
changed independent of the State
Elections Code and that the pro
posed ordinance was therefore
probably unconstitutional, Prus
sion urged the Council to go
ahead and pass it anyway.
IN SUMMARY THEN, the rab
id right—far from offering a so
lution to the problems posed by
communism—has itself become a
problem; far from illuminating
and clarifying issues it has ob
scured them. Its quick use of the
smear brush and its careless dis
regard for democratic processes
make it a danger to the nation
rather than its saviour. I agree
with the slogan of the Christian
Anti-Communism Crusade that
“Eternal Vigilance Is the Price of
Liberty.” The question is “against
whom should we be vigilant?” I
would certainly place in the cate
gory of things to be watched
carefully lest they make incur
sions into my liberties the Chris
tian Anti-Communism Crusade
itself and its brother rabid right
movements.
