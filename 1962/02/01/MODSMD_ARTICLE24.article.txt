ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
Editor, The Daily:
Although not moaning to de
fend the Established Order of
Things, I am disappointed that a
group bearing the awesome offi
cial title of “Subcommittee on
Academic Review” should present
such a shabby critique of Stan
ford’s English department.
My first complaint is that the
article seems to assume all stu
dents agree on what the study of
literature really entails, and that
all prefer to anything else Class
Discussions, Contemporary Liter
ature, and Interesting Young
Professors. All students do not.
The Subcommittee, as a repre
sentative group, should combat
incompetence rather than set
.straight supposed misdirection.
But, sadly enough, the article
itself constitutes a more trench
ant, although unintentional, con
demnation of the English depart
ment. We should expect from a
group of select English majors
the ability to write English prose.
But alas! what do we find? “It is
in the creative writing depart
ment, in which the student must
still take the courses for all Eng
lish majors, but where the sins of
the department as a whole are al
leviated by the several factors
that help emasculate the litera
ture department.” The writing
throughout is similarly garbled;
the ideas—“treat art as art” and
“literature is ideas in aesthetic
form” for example—are none too
clear; the result is remarkable in
coherence.
Stanford’s English department,
like all departments, could profit
from intelligent student criticism.
I hope that this initial article does
not serve as a model for those
that are to come.

Editor, The Daily:
The unfortunate soul who
would attempt comment on the
Student Committee Review of the
English Department must needs
meet generality with generality,
and thus risk contributing noth
ing tangible to the discussion. Be

that as it may, I find some things
said in the Review rather unjust,
to put it mildly.
First, I would object to the off
hand castigation of the faculty.
My experience may not be com
prehensive enough, or maybe I’m
just ignorant, but I find Stan
ford’s English professors a source
both of interest and enlighten
ment. Indeed, I think their suc
cess in lecturing remarkable in
view of the problems inherent in
conveying so much material in a
personal fashion to so large an
audience.
This last suggests, of course,
that I agree with the criticisms
leveled against the “lecture hall
system” as I choose to call it. I
do agree; the small problem of
practical necessity, however,
tends to make me tolerant. I won
der if perhaps more accent
couldn’t be put on seminars, in
addition to lectures. I know some
students attend both (i.e. Honors
Program students). Time is ob
viously a limiting factor here,
though.
This brings me, by implication,
to class discussion. I take excep
tion to the rather blatant com
ment in the Review that large
classes are “eliminating class
participation and discussion.” I
suggest this statement should be
qualified—not all discussion is
eliminated; furthermore, it is oft
en the students who refuse to
speak when given the opportuni
ty. Of course, larger classes
somehow inhibit most students
more, but this is a phychological
effect, not the fault of the de
partment.
Now, I agree smaller classes
are “better” and promote freer
discussion: hence learning is more
“fun.” I also agree with the re
port that literature needs to be
taught with more cognizance of
its aesthetic significance that is,

as an “art," and not merely as the
reflection of a cultural millieu.
But, being Greek at heart, I would
cry “moderation” to all those

criticisms; it isn’t all so gloomy
as “stagnant and uninspiring”
would seem to indicate.

taught with more cognizance of
its aesthetic significance that is,

as an “art," and not merely as the

Although not moaning to de
fend the Established Order of
Things, I am disappointed that a
group bearing the awesome offi
cial title of “Subcommittee on
Academic Review” should present
such a shabby critique of Stan
ford’s English department.
My first complaint is that the
article seems to assume all stu
dents agree on what the study of
literature really entails, and that
all prefer to anything else Class
Discussions, Contemporary Liter
ature, and Interesting Young
Professors. All students do not.
The Subcommittee, as a repre
sentative group, should combat
incompetence rather than set
.straight supposed misdirection.
But, sadly enough, the article
itself constitutes a more trench
ant, although unintentional, con
demnation of the English depart
ment. We should expect from a
group of select English majors
the ability to write English prose.
But alas! what do we find? “It is
in the creative writing depart
ment, in which the student must
still take the courses for all Eng
lish majors, but where the sins of
the department as a whole are al
leviated by the several factors
that help emasculate the litera
ture department.” The writing
throughout is similarly garbled;
the ideas—“treat art as art” and
“literature is ideas in aesthetic
form” for example—are none too
clear; the result is remarkable in
coherence.
Stanford’s English department,
like all departments, could profit
from intelligent student criticism.
I hope that this initial article does
not serve as a model for those

Editor, The Daily:
The unfortunate soul who
would attempt comment on the
Student Committee Review of the
English Department must needs
meet generality with generality,
and thus risk contributing noth
ing tangible to the discussion. Be

that as it may, I find some things
said in the Review rather unjust,
to put it mildly.
First, I would object to the off
hand castigation of the faculty.
My experience may not be com
prehensive enough, or maybe I’m
just ignorant, but I find Stan
ford’s English professors a source
both of interest and enlighten
ment. Indeed, I think their suc
cess in lecturing remarkable in
view of the problems inherent in
conveying so much material in a
personal fashion to so large an
audience.
This last suggests, of course,
that I agree with the criticisms
leveled against the “lecture hall
system” as I choose to call it. I
do agree; the small problem of
practical necessity, however,
tends to make me tolerant. I won
der if perhaps more accent
couldn’t be put on seminars, in
addition to lectures. I know some
students attend both (i.e. Honors
Program students). Time is ob
viously a limiting factor here,
though.
This brings me, by implication,
to class discussion. I take excep
tion to the rather blatant com
ment in the Review that large
classes are “eliminating class
participation and discussion.” I
suggest this statement should be
qualified—not all discussion is
eliminated; furthermore, it is oft

practical necessity, however,
tends to make me tolerant. I won
der if perhaps more accent
couldn’t be put on seminars, in
addition to lectures. I know some
students attend both (i.e. Honors
Program students). Time is ob
viously a limiting factor here,
though.
This brings me, by implication,
to class discussion. I take excep
tion to the rather blatant com
ment in the Review that large
classes are “eliminating class
participation and discussion.” I
suggest this statement should be
qualified—not all discussion is
eliminated; furthermore, it is oft
en the students who refuse to
speak when given the opportuni
ty. Of course, larger classes
somehow inhibit most students
more, but this is a phychological
effect, not the fault of the de
partment.
Now, I agree smaller classes
are “better” and promote freer
discussion: hence learning is more
“fun.” I also agree with the re
port that literature needs to be
taught with more cognizance of
its aesthetic significance that is,

as an “art," and not merely as the
reflection of a cultural millieu.
But, being Greek at heart, I would
cry “moderation” to all those

criticisms; it isn’t all so gloomy
as “stagnant and uninspiring”
would seem to indicate.

ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
Editor, The Daily:
Although not moaning to de
fend the Established Order of
Things, I am disappointed that a
group bearing the awesome offi
cial title of “Subcommittee on
Academic Review” should present
such a shabby critique of Stan
ford’s English department.
My first complaint is that the
article seems to assume all stu
dents agree on what the study of
literature really entails, and that
all prefer to anything else Class
Discussions, Contemporary Liter
ature, and Interesting Young
Professors. All students do not.
The Subcommittee, as a repre
sentative group, should combat
incompetence rather than set
.straight supposed misdirection.
But, sadly enough, the article
itself constitutes a more trench
ant, although unintentional, con
demnation of the English depart
ment. We should expect from a
group of select English majors
the ability to write English prose.
But alas! what do we find? “It is
in the creative writing depart
ment, in which the student must
still take the courses for all Eng
lish majors, but where the sins of
the department as a whole are al
leviated by the several factors
that help emasculate the litera
ture department.” The writing
throughout is similarly garbled;
the ideas—“treat art as art” and
“literature is ideas in aesthetic
form” for example—are none too
clear; the result is remarkable in
coherence.
Stanford’s English department,
like all departments, could profit
from intelligent student criticism.
I hope that this initial article does
not serve as a model for those
that are to come.

plete sentence mentioned by Mr.
Schroeder resulted from a Daily
proofreading error, and was not

did the article.)
Editor, The Daily:
The unfortunate soul who
would attempt comment on the
Student Committee Review of the
English Department must needs
meet generality with generality,
and thus risk contributing noth
ing tangible to the discussion. Be

that as it may, I find some things
said in the Review rather unjust,
to put it mildly.
First, I would object to the off
hand castigation of the faculty.
My experience may not be com
prehensive enough, or maybe I’m
just ignorant, but I find Stan
ford’s English professors a source
both of interest and enlighten
ment. Indeed, I think their suc
cess in lecturing remarkable in
view of the problems inherent in
conveying so much material in a
personal fashion to so large an
audience.
This last suggests, of course,
that I agree with the criticisms
leveled against the “lecture hall
system” as I choose to call it. I
do agree; the small problem of
practical necessity, however,
tends to make me tolerant. I won
der if perhaps more accent
couldn’t be put on seminars, in
addition to lectures. I know some
students attend both (i.e. Honors
Program students). Time is ob
viously a limiting factor here,
though.
This brings me, by implication,
