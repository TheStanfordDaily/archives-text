# Just Sort of a Column
## 
### Tom Parker 
I don’t know about anyone else,
but I can never make it to break
fast in the morning. It’s just
something about that extra half
hour of sleep that more than
compensates for those grumbling
sounds you hear about ten or so.
So I don't know what John Q.
Average Breakfastgoer’s reaction
is to The Daily. I frankly can’t
look at the thing till at least nine.
And oven then it’s sort of diffi
cult. I suppose I could best ex
plain this difficiflty by saying
that I have to pul out one of
those four pages every Monday
morning, and when I look at the
thing, a wave of nausea flows
through my body. Few people re
alize what goes on “behind the
scenes in a big newspaper office”
like The Daily. So perhaps if I
told you, you also would feel this
wave of nausea, or maybe you do
already.
I get to the shack (for those
that have seen The Daily building
you will realize what a gross un
derstatement this is) every Sun
day at four. There I am greeted
by the usual smiling faces of the
Wire Editor, the Night Editor, an
array of broken typewriters, a
very uncomfortable chair and a
“menu.”
THIS “MENU” is my guide.
Upon it are all the things that
should appear on the page. It
reads something like this:
1. Varsity Basketball—me
2. Frosh Basketball—Ken
3. Rugby—Art
4. Murals—Bugge calls
5. Art see Ken
6. Tom, if the stories run short,
use a wire or something.
Next to the menu is the dummy
page. This is exactly what the
name indicates. A page upon
which to dummy. You ask, what
do you dummy on this page. The
layout naturally. And in doing
this layout there is one thing to
remember: Break up grey space.
This means use bold face type at
the start of every third para
graph, throw in pictures (any
thing will do), write big head
lines, and use boxes. DON’T put
a bold face headline next to an
other bold face headline. This, to
the average reader does not seem
too important, but someday,
when you have a little time, just
try putting a bold face headline
next to a boldface headline. I

mean it just isn’t done.
So now you are faced with that
age-olfl problem of finding away
to fill forty inches of space with
twenty inches of story. A quick
run to the UPI teletype and your
problem is solved. All that is left
to fill space now are headlines.
And I digress.
HAVE YOU even seen anything
quite as ridiculous as some>of lhe*
words used in headlines. Quiet,
unassuming basketball players
become “hoopsters,” “cagers” and
“melon men.”» The football line
becomes part and parcel of that
ominous “forward wall,” cross
country runners become “harri
ers” and “leather lungers.” and
wrestlers are suddenly “grap
plers.” This is not to mention
some of the names the University
itself adopts. In one story I no
ticed the Freshman football squad
referred to as “Papooses, Indians,
Cardinals, Cards, Stanfords, Big
Red, and Frosh Eleven.” And al
most all these names wore results
of fanatic headline writers.
The headline, for those of you
who are graphically inclined,
needs a certain "count” for it to
fill a certain space. It is pretty
certain that the “Freshman Foot
ball Team” will not fit across one
column, so “Frosh Cards” is
adopted. And then the slaughter
begins. A coach becomes a men
tor, teams no longer lose, they
are beaten, clobbered, plucked,
downed, scalped, or massacred.
And even poor Mr. Curtice has to
have Cactus tacked onto his name.
Well, back to writing the
blessed things. The first story on
the menu is the basketball story.
Immediately "Cagers” and “In
dians” become musts. Then a
“downed” or a "clobbered.” add a
“Bears” and what do you have
. . . A Stanford Daily headline.
“Indian Cagers Down Bears.” Ah!
but perhaps this has to run four
columns. I m m c d i at e 1 y the
“Bears” become “Golden” and
“down” becomes “clobber.” Es
sentially you still have the same
thing. It is pretty obvious that
the University of California has
suffered a loss at the hands of
those merciless Indians from
Palo Alto.
AND THIS little ordeal is re
peated for every story. Occasion
ally though you will notice a
headline and a kicker. A kicker

is the little italic filing on top.
You are not limited when writing
kickers. Usually a kicker reads,
“Atkinson, Patitucci Star,” fol
lowed by a head that usually
reads, “Stanford Downed by
Washington.” The incongruity of
the whole thing amazes me.

There are times too, in the mid
file of the week especially, when
there is really not too much going
on. These are the times you will
see ridiculous space-filling col
umns like this one and probably
the UPI story that I’ll bet a half
a buck runs right next to this
column. In fact in the middle of
the week the biggest thing that
goes on is the murals. “Theta
Xi downed Rinconada II in basket
ball action in the pavilion last
night. The win puts Theta Xi
only two games away from Sig
ma Nu, who is tied for sixth.” So
naturally this warrants a mam
moth headline that will probably

read, “Theta Xi Wins, Moving In.”
Then of course, you will have
to be able to write captions. Sarah
works in the darkroom the night
I put out the page (dispell all evil
thoughts) and 1 have to pick the
pictures and write the captions.
Last week I had to pick a wres
tling picture.
Now 1 know as much about
wrestling as I do about writing
columns, so I had a little prob
lem. From the picture it was evi
dent that some Stanford “grap
pler” was on the verge of break
ing somebody from Cal Poly’s
leg. The guy from Poly was on
his stomach and the Big lied
Grappler had his knee on the
Poly guy's (high and was bending
his leg and foot at the same time.
Try to write a caption for that.
The caption, if you remember it
(if you are one of those people
I hat remembers captions) read
something like, “Stanford grap-

pler picking up points against
Cal Poly ...”
AND THEN YOU have to proof
read all your copy (I like to use
the jargon) Misspelled words are
not tragedies. Nine times out of
ten, they are the fault of the 140
plus IQ's of the student writers,
it’s when a whole line is missing
or something; that’s when your
heartaches begin.
With captions out of the way
and proofreading done, only one
thing remains. The actual “make
up.” This is the part that smashes
your ego-. Remember that story
that was supposed to run ten
inches; it only ran eight. Back to
UPI for a filler. And it happens
again and again. Pretty soon,
though, the page takes shape and
assumes the form of a typical
Monday morning Daily sports
page. More fillers than stories.
But so what, nobody reads the
damn thing anyway.
