### 
The three plays presented by
Ram’s Head Productions Febru
ary 9, 10, 16 and 17 promise to
provide a varied program for
theatregoers. The student - pro
duced program will begin each
night at 8:30 in the Little Theatre.
“Friends of the Universe” is a
comedy by Chappie writer Judy
Skinner. It spoofs European
tours, problems of integration,
and “The Ideals of The Younger
Generation.” The play is to be
directed by Moses Goldberg.
A STARK BACKDROP of black
draperies will set the scene for
Dave Kirk’s “The Inquisition.”
The play dramatically portrays
the effects of Spanish persecu
tion of heretics. The director is
drama student Susan James.
Playwright Kirk will direct “As
I Was Going to St. Ives.” The
play, by Judy Shrader, is a farce
on an English murder mystery.
The set features hidden doors,
secret panels, and all of the
touches necessary for suspense
and humor.
Tickets at $1.30 are available at
the Ram’s Head office in the
Union, above the Cellar. Tele
phone orders may be placed at
