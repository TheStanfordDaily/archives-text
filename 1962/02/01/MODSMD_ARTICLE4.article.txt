# Fuel Troubles Still Hold Glenn

CAPE CANAVERAL (HIT)
Sources said yesterday the fuel
device difficulties that developed
in astronaut John H. Glenn’s
space rocket could have resulted
in a “hot” flight that would have
put Glenn in a dangerously high
orbit.
Minutes after the trouble was
discovered Tuesday officials an
nounced that America would post
pone its first manned orbital
flight attempt until Feb. 13.
The heart of the problem,
sources said, was a series of small
“regulator” boxes which controll
ed (he flow of fuel to the giant
engines of Glenn’s Atlas booster
rocket.
There was also a rupture some
where in the rocket’s fuel line,
these sources said.
Technicians reportedly made
“some progress” yesterday in
curing the rocket of its ills. But a
spokesman for the National Aero
nautics and Space Administration
(NASA i explained that “we are
not yet sure of the complete ex
tent of the problems.”
