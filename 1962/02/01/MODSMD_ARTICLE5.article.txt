# Pacifist Group Before LASSU
## 
### 
First hearing of a constitution
for the “Non-Violent Alternative
to War” organization will top the
agenda at tonight’s Legislature
meeting at 7 o’clock in Bowman
Alumni House.
This is an offshoot of the group
which presented a constitution to
LASSU three weeks ago under
the name of the “Non-Violent Ac
tion for Peace” group. LASSU re
fused approval of that constitu
tion but members of that group
got together with the Legislature
By-Laws and Rules Committee
and worked out the new consti
tution.
Also up for discussion will be
the new Daily and Pre-Reg mem
bers, amendments to the Hurlburt
House constitution and first read
ing of a Jordan House constitu
tion.
