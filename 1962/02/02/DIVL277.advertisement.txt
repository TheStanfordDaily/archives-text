THE MANY LOVES OF
THORWALD DOCKSTADER
W lion Thorvvald Dockstader —sopliomore, epicure, and sports
man—first took up smoking, he did not simply choose the first
brand of cigarettes that came to hand. He did what any
sophomore, epicure, and sportsman would do: he sampled sev
eral brands until he found the very best—a mild, rich, flavorful
smoke an endless source of comfort and satisfaction—a smoke
that never palled, never failed to please—a smoke that age
could not wither nor custom stale—a filter cigarette with an
unfiltered taste—Marlboro, of course!
Similarly, when Thorwald took up girls, he did not simply
select the first one who came along. He sampled. First he
dated an English literature major named Elizabeth Barrett
Schwartz, a wisp of a girl with large, luminous eyes and a soul
that shimmered with a pale, unearthly beauty. Trippingly,
trippingly,she walked with Thorwald upon the beach and sat
with him behind a windward dune and listened to a conch shell
and sighed sweetly and took out a little gold pencil and a little
morocco notebook and wrote a little poem:
I will lie upon the shore,
1 will he a dreamer,
I will feel the sen once, more,
Pounding on my femur.
Thorwald’s second date was with a physical education major
L ;

named Peaches (Bendower, a broth of a girl with a ready smile
and a size 18 neck. She took Thorwald down to the cinder track
where they did 100 laps to open the pores. Then they played
four games of squash, six sets of tennis, 30 holes of golf, nine
innings of one o’cat, six chukkers of lacrosse, and a mile and a
quarter of leapfrog. Then they went ten rounds with eight
ounce gloves and had heaping bowls of whey and exchanged a
firm handshake and went home to their respective whirlpool
baths.
1 horwald’s final date was with a golden-haired, creamy
browed, green-eyed, red-lipped, full-calved girl named Totsi
Sigafoos. Totsi was not majoring in anything. As she often said,
“Gee whillikers, what’s college for anyhow—to fill your head
full of icky old facts, or to discover the shining essence that is
YOU?”
Totsi started the evening with Thorwald at a luxurious
restaurant where she consumed her own weight in Cornish rock
hen. From there they went to a deluxe movie palace where
Totsi had popcorn with butter. Then she had a bag of chocolate
covered raisins—also with butter. Then they went to a costly
ballroom and did the Twist till dawn, tipping the band every
eight bars. 1 hen they went to a Chinese restaurant where
Totsi, unable to translate the menu, solved her problem by
ordering one of everything. Then Thorwald took her to the
women’s dorm, boosted her in the window, and went downtown
to wait for the employment office to open.
While waiting, Thorwald thought over all of his girls and
came to a sensible decision. “I think,” he said to himself, “that
I will stick with Marlboros. I am not rich enough for girls.”
e 1»62 Max Sbulman
Marlboro, however, is rich enough for anybody. It lakes
niighty good makin's to give you unaltered taste in a filter
cigarette. Thai’s the flavor you gel in the famous Marlboro
recipe from Richmond, Virginia. You get a lot to like.

THE MANY LOVES OF
THORWALD DOCKSTADER
W lion Thorvvald Dockstader —sopliomore, epicure, and sports
man—first took up smoking, he did not simply choose the first
brand of cigarettes that came to hand. He did what any
sophomore, epicure, and sportsman would do: he sampled sev
eral brands until he found the very best—a mild, rich, flavorful
smoke an endless source of comfort and satisfaction—a smoke
that never palled, never failed to please—a smoke that age
could not wither nor custom stale—a filter cigarette with an
unfiltered taste—Marlboro, of course!
Similarly, when Thorwald took up girls, he did not simply
select the first one who came along. He sampled. First he
dated an English literature major named Elizabeth Barrett
Schwartz, a wisp of a girl with large, luminous eyes and a soul
that shimmered with a pale, unearthly beauty. Trippingly,
trippingly,she walked with Thorwald upon the beach and sat
with him behind a windward dune and listened to a conch shell
and sighed sweetly and took out a little gold pencil and a little
morocco notebook and wrote a little poem:
I will lie upon the shore,
1 will he a dreamer,
I will feel the sen once, more,
Pounding on my femur.
Thorwald’s second date was with a physical education major
L ;

named Peaches (Bendower, a broth of a girl with a ready smile
and a size 18 neck. She took Thorwald down to the cinder track
where they did 100 laps to open the pores. Then they played
four games of squash, six sets of tennis, 30 holes of golf, nine
innings of one o’cat, six chukkers of lacrosse, and a mile and a
quarter of leapfrog. Then they went ten rounds with eight
ounce gloves and had heaping bowls of whey and exchanged a
firm handshake and went home to their respective whirlpool
baths.
1 horwald’s final date was with a golden-haired, creamy
browed, green-eyed, red-lipped, full-calved girl named Totsi
Sigafoos. Totsi was not majoring in anything. As she often said,
“Gee whillikers, what’s college for anyhow—to fill your head
full of icky old facts, or to discover the shining essence that is
YOU?”
Totsi started the evening with Thorwald at a luxurious
restaurant where she consumed her own weight in Cornish rock
hen. From there they went to a deluxe movie palace where
Totsi had popcorn with butter. Then she had a bag of chocolate
covered raisins—also with butter. Then they went to a costly
ballroom and did the Twist till dawn, tipping the band every
eight bars. 1 hen they went to a Chinese restaurant where
Totsi, unable to translate the menu, solved her problem by
ordering one of everything. Then Thorwald took her to the
women’s dorm, boosted her in the window, and went downtown
to wait for the employment office to open.
While waiting, Thorwald thought over all of his girls and
came to a sensible decision. “I think,” he said to himself, “that
I will stick with Marlboros. I am not rich enough for girls.”

Marlboro, however, is rich enough for anybody. It lakes
niighty good makin's to give you unaltered taste in a filter
cigarette. Thai’s the flavor you gel in the famous Marlboro
recipe from Richmond, Virginia. You get a lot to like.
