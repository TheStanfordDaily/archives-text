# JFK Welfare Plan Sent to Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD— Presi
dent Kennedy asked Congress
yesterday to enact a new welfare
program providing increased fed
eral aid to the states to rehabili
tate needy families and help get
them off relief rolls.
His proposals would cost an es
timated $193 million, hut the
President said they would save
money in the long run. He also
said the program would “restore
human dignity” by aiding millions
of Americans in their desire to
bo independent of relief checks.
The program was described by
the administration as the first
major overhauling of the welfare
system since the Social Security
Act was passed in 1935. The Presi
dent dubbed it a program of “pre
vention and rehabilitation.”
CONGRESSIONAL reaction in
dicated that Kennedy would get
fast and probably favorable action
on most, if not all, of the new
welfare legislation. The adminis
tration measure was immediately
introduced by Chairman Wilbur
D, Mills, D-Ark., of the House
Ways & Means Committee.
Rep. Noah Mason, senior Re
publican on the committee, said
that he would oppose most of its
provisions. But the veteran Illi
nois lawmaker said he saw no
real hope that Congress in an
election year would refuse to ex
pand federal responsibility for
welfare.
Adding to this was a state
ment by Rep. John W. Byrnes, R-
Wis., second-ranking committee
Republican who as House GOP
policy chairman is likely to set
GOP policy on the issue.
BYRNES SAID HE agreed with
the general direction of the ad
ministration approach.
Kennedy said a number of com
munities have had little success
in trying to save money with
“ruthless and arbitrary” cutbacks
in their welfare program. But he
said communities that tried to re
habilitate relief families have re
duced their welfare rolls.
The President's program fell
into five major categories:
• The states, which now re
ceive federal funds to pay for half
their total welfare costs, would be
required to separate the cost of
routine clerical and office func

lions from the cost of essential
rehabilitation, social work and
other service costs. After they did
so, the government would pay the
states three-fourths of the cost of
such services.

• THE STATUS would set up
facilities to lake care of children
while their mothers work. Up to
$5 million would be earmarked
for the states for such services in
1963. and up to $lO million an
nually thereafter. Congress also
would make permanent the tem
porary aid for 1 dependent children
of unemployed parents.
• Federal aid would be provid
ed the states to help them main
tain community work and train
ing projects for the unemployed.
This would be designed to help
the unemployed retain their 1 work
skills or develop new ones and to
give communities additional man
power on public projects.
• Increased aid would be marie
available to the states for train
ing welfare personnel, especially
welfare workers to deal with chil
dren whose parents have desert
ed, are unmarried or who have
other serious problems.
• STATES THAT receive fed
eral funds could not exclude from
relief rolls any otherwise eligible
person who has been a resident of
the state for one year. A small
increase in federal aid would be
provided for states that removed
all residence requirements.

habilitate relief families have re
duced their welfare rolls.
The President's program fell
into five major categories:
• The states, which now re
ceive federal funds to pay for half
their total welfare costs, would be
required to separate the cost of
routine clerical and office func

lions from the cost of essential
rehabilitation, social work and
other service costs. After they did
so, the government would pay the
states three-fourths of the cost of
such services.

• THE STATUS would set up
facilities to lake care of children
while their mothers work. Up to
$5 million would be earmarked
for the states for such services in
1963. and up to $lO million an
nually thereafter. Congress also
would make permanent the tem
porary aid for 1 dependent children
of unemployed parents.
• Federal aid would be provid
ed the states to help them main
tain community work and train
ing projects for the unemployed.
This would be designed to help
the unemployed retain their 1 work
skills or develop new ones and to
give communities additional man
power on public projects.
• Increased aid would be marie
available to the states for train
ing welfare personnel, especially
welfare workers to deal with chil
dren whose parents have desert
ed, are unmarried or who have
other serious problems.
• STATES THAT receive fed
eral funds could not exclude from
relief rolls any otherwise eligible
person who has been a resident of
the state for one year. A small
increase in federal aid would be
provided for states that removed
all residence requirements.
WASHINGTON (UPD— Presi
dent Kennedy asked Congress
yesterday to enact a new welfare
program providing increased fed
eral aid to the states to rehabili
tate needy families and help get
them off relief rolls.
His proposals would cost an es
timated $193 million, hut the
President said they would save
money in the long run. He also
said the program would “restore
human dignity” by aiding millions
of Americans in their desire to
bo independent of relief checks.
The program was described by
the administration as the first
major overhauling of the welfare
system since the Social Security
Act was passed in 1935. The Presi
dent dubbed it a program of “pre
vention and rehabilitation.”
CONGRESSIONAL reaction in
dicated that Kennedy would get
fast and probably favorable action
on most, if not all, of the new
welfare legislation. The adminis
tration measure was immediately
introduced by Chairman Wilbur
D, Mills, D-Ark., of the House
Ways & Means Committee.
Rep. Noah Mason, senior Re
publican on the committee, said
that he would oppose most of its
provisions. But the veteran Illi
nois lawmaker said he saw no
real hope that Congress in an
election year would refuse to ex
pand federal responsibility for
welfare.
Adding to this was a state
ment by Rep. John W. Byrnes, R-
Wis., second-ranking committee
Republican who as House GOP
policy chairman is likely to set
GOP policy on the issue.
BYRNES SAID HE agreed with
the general direction of the ad
ministration approach.
Kennedy said a number of com
munities have had little success
in trying to save money with
“ruthless and arbitrary” cutbacks
in their welfare program. But he
said communities that tried to re
habilitate relief families have re
duced their welfare rolls.
