# Russ Confident of Future, Fear Nuclear War--Hazard
## Foreign Policy Institute Ends With Achilles Speech Tonight 
### TOM COLEMAN 
The Russians are confident of
their future. They feel they are
making economic, social and po
litical progress, and they fear a
nuclear war which would destroy
their chances of ultimate world
wide conquest, Dr. John N. Haz
ard said last night.
Hazard, a Columbia University
professor and a Russian expert,
told Foreign Policy Institute
members that this is why Soviet
leaders desire peaceful co-exist
ence. They regard it as peaceful
competition, but never peaceful
cooperation, he added.
Russian leaders have carefully
weighed the gains against the
losses resulting from war. Un
like the Red Chinese, the Soviets
feel they would stand to lose in
an all-out nuclear war, he de
clared.
THE CHINESE MIGHT not se

verely feel the loss of a hundred
million people, but the compara
tively wealthy Soviet Union
would, Hazard explained. He
feels the Russians also would
dread the crushing blow of wide
spread industrial destruction,
whereas the Communist Chinese
would have little to lose along
this lino.

Theodore C’. Achilles will close
the Foreign Policy Institute to
night with a major foreign policy
address at 8 p.m. in Room 320 in
Geology Corner.
Achilles will speak on "Peace
ful Co-Existence and U.S. Nation
al Security.” lie is present direc
tor of the State Department’s
“Crisis Center” and has served as
ambassador to Peru. He is a
Stanford graduate of 1925.
Achilles will dine at El Tigre
before the speech, and will be
hosted at a reception after the
speech at Bowman Alumni House.
The reception is sponsored by the
junior class.
KZSU, 880 on the dial, will
broadcast Dr. John Hazard’s
speech today at 3 p.m.

Hazard attributed the Soviet’s
fear of war and their distrust of
Western motives for nuclear dis
armament negotiations to the
traditional Russian suspicion of
foreign nations.
Above all, ho said, the Russians
fear the Germans, who devastated
their land during the two world
wars. Soviet military strategists
envision war wdth Germans
armed by the United States. Wo,
the Americans, would supply the
braver Germans with nuclear
arms, and let them attack the
Soviet Union, is the feeling.
Such is not our strategy, Haz
ard said, but it is hard to con
vince Russian military leaders
this is not the case. Thus we can
see why Berlin is such an annoy
ance for the Russians. Viewed in
context, it is part of the NATO
scheme to destroy the U.S.S.R.
WHY THE RUSSIANS’ confi
dence in their future? Hazard
feels that it arises basically from
the faith of the Soviet people in
Marxist-Leninist doctrine, along
with numerous events of recent
years which confirm that faith.
With the coming of the Russian
revolution, the Bolsheviks, like
patient astrologers, hoped they
were seeing their predictions
coming true. However, the world
revolution did not occur, and
Russia’s future was to be marked
by many calamities, he said.
In the last 20 years, however,
the Soviet standard of living has
risen somewhat, industrial
growth has been tremendous, and
militarily, the U.S.S.R. has be
come a first-rate power.
At the same time, he noted, the
Russian people’s belief in the re
ality of a world revolution is re
inforced quite frequently by po
litical eruptions in many under
developed countries. An example
is Cuba, under the wry shadow
of the land of capitalism.
