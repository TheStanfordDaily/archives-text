One clay a long time ago a Daily editor sat clown at his battered
Underwood in the equally battered Daily Shack and typed out his
final editorial. One of the things he wrote was that you don’t realize
you’re the editor until the time comes to lock up the editorial page
for the last time. He was right. And anyone who doesn’t get senti
mental and feel a lump in his throat when that time comes isn’t
human.
Leafing through the Daily’s dusty files, I was struck by the
topics dealt with in these final editorials. Only recently have the
subjects switcthed from fond farewells to The Daily and four years
of campus life to more serious matters—perhaps an indication of the
changing temper of our time. All the outgoing editors, however,
spoke frankly and personally, avoiding the editorial “we” used for
70 or so previous issues. Thus, one sets clown in short, simple sen
tences a few generalities on what concerns one the most and hopes
that a few people may read it and think about it.
These days, of course, it is impossible not to be concerned with
communism and the threat it poses to man’s freedom and dignity.
Clearly, it is up to the United States to lead the fight against the
forceful, illegal spread of communism. If people wish to freely
choose communism as away of life, fine; that’s their right. This
has not yet happened, however, and we doubt that it ever will.
Ways of fighting communism are varied. One is to set a proud
example for the emerging nations.
The free world’s basic principles do set this example. “Govern
ment of the people, by the people, for the people”—what man can
fail to be stirred by these words? However, the free world, and
particularly the United States, too often does not live up to its high
sounding principles. We too frequently see the world as black or
white, failing to discern the vast amount of greyness around us.
We swear by a system of capitalism which needs revising if one
truly believes that every man should have just as much chance to
succeed in life as the next man. Nor do we admit that some good
can be found in communism and socialism.
Our system of values condones a Rockefeller inheriting millions
of dollars while migrant farm workers live like animals simply
because there isn’t money available to care for them. Our repre
sentatives in Congress debate whether we should make it easier
for our elderly to receive medical care, while the subjects of the
debate die because they can’t afford that medical care—certainly
the one thing no human being should have to worry about.
We value education as the foundation upon which our freedom
rests, yet intelligence and desire aren’t as important in guaranteeing
one an opportunity to gain a higher education as are the possession
of money and a certain type of environment as a child.
We have not yet extended the guarantees of the Constitution
to all Americans. There are places in our nation where a man is
not allowed to vote because his skin is black. This same man can
be reasonably sure that his children will have no chance to go to
anything but a jerkwater, unaccredited college, that his wife cannot
sit where she wants to on a bus, and that his relatives cannot stay
at any hotel they please when they visit him—all because of a dif
ference in skin pigmentation.
We also inhibit the right of the individual in areas where the
right of the individual should be absolute. There is a committee of
the U.S. Congress which wrecks men’s lives because they feel their
present or past political affiliation are no one’s business but their
own, and because they refuse to turn informer on their friends.
Obviously, I could continue listing the faults of this country.
My point, however, is that there are too many faults for a democ
racy which is the richest nation the world has ever known. Such a
nation should be able to correct its faults without undue trouble.
It has the necessary money, ideas and manpower. I do wonder
whether it has the necessary drive and concern to take the corrective
action.
Personally, I favor such things as socialized medicine, a very
heavy inheritance tax, federal aid to schools and those who need
it to finance an education, a more responsible party government
with clearer choices offered the voters and a stronger federal gov
ernment accompanied by a stronger interest in that government by
the average citizen.
I also feel the use of nuclear weapons by any nation never will
be justified under any circumstances. We will save nothing by their
use, for once they are used there will be nothing left to be saved.
Nothing is so valuable as to justify the unleashing of nuclear weap
ons, knowing that such an act will kill or doom most of the people
in the world.
But the problems I have described are by no means insoluble.
The dawn of the space age and the emergence of the underdevel
oped nations have provided man with his greatest challenge in
history, and we are fortunate to be the ones to meet that challenge.
Perhaps the editor of Daily Volume 180 will be able to chronicle
the daily life of a world at peace, a world where all men have equal
opportunity in life, in which all men truly are brothers, and in which
no man or nation is a slave,
I like the way a refrain from one of the Freedom Riders’ songs
puts it:
The only chain a man can sland
Is the chain of hand in hand.
