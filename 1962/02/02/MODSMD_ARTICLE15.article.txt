# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Mein Kampf' a 'Fascinating' Documentary of Third Reich 
### ALAN ROSENTHAL 
Last year I spent eight months
in Israel working in connection
with the Eichmann trial. One
memory stands out above all
others. The memory of the speech
of Yechiel Dinar, author of “The
House of Dolls,” and former Au
schwitz inmate. “I do not consider
myself a writer,” he said. “I only
wrote the history of another
planet. I lived there two years.
There one did not find a single
concept like the ones on Earth.
But that planet is still casting its
malign influence on all of us to
this day.”
“Mein Kampf,” at The Guild,
Menlo Park, is the story of the ar
chitects of that planet. In two
hours the film traces the history
of the Third Reich from its ori
gins in the 1918 defeat to its de
struction in 1945.

In the beginning one sees Hit
ler as the young political agitator,
number seven in the new Nation
al Socialist Party. Gradually the
other “heroes” put in their ap
pearance Captain Goering,
Himmler, Hess and Goebbels. And
the nightmare grows. The ban
ners thicken. The machine guns
are seen in the streets. And final
ly in 1933 Hitler Is the state.
MUCH OF THE footage has a
surrealist quality. Torches burn

in midnight marches, blond
youths swear eternal allegiance
to the empire which will last a
thousand years; Hess raises Hit
ler to the level of a god, and above
all stands the crooked cross.
A lot of this is familiar from
“Triumph of the Will,” but cus
tom cannot blunt the horror of
the serried rows of helmets at
Nurenberg, of the boy reciting
from “Mein Kampf” as from the
Bible, and the grim cattle trucks
moving to the east.
Among the most interesting
scenes are the Reichstag lire
trial, and the trial of the army
conspirators after the attempt on
Hitler’s life, when the writing has
already been seen on the wall.
There is also one ironic parallel.
Early in the film Hitler is seen
patting some smiling children. In
1945 he is shown repeating this
gesture with a difference. This
time the boy is 12, in uniform and
helmeted, and recounting his per
sonal fight for the fatherland.
There is also the irony of Goeb
bels requesting the soldiers to use
the fervor and dedication of a
priest in their task of murder.
THE MOST MOVING se
quences are those of the Warsaw
ghetto, so powerful that they tend
to unbalance the film. No com
mentary is needed. The undescrib
able existence of the ghetto Jews
unfolds against a Rabbi’s prayer
and a mother’s song. The streets
bring forth their dead. A four
year-old child dances for bread.
And eyes accuse.
In 1943, after a fantastic upris
ing against the Germans, the
ghetto was razed by fire and
bombing. On entering the ghetto
all the enemy found were nine
rifles and a few small arms. Later
in the film the authors point out
that the 1944 revolt of the Poles
against the Germans received not
the slightest, help from the near

by Russians. But lot it not be for
gotten that the Warsaw ghetto
would never have been possible
but for the attitude of the Poles
themselves.

“Mein Kampf” is a horrific,
fascinating document. Its struc
ture is at times weak but it is im
possible to view with any normal
critical objectivity. I am not im
personal on this subject. Like the
makers of “Mein Kampf” I think
it is the duty of everyone to see
that such a thing as the Third
Reich can never be born again.
BUT THEBE ARE wider impli
cations of the film. In every coun
try there are those concerned
with the world around them.
They fight prejudice and ignor
ance in whatever form it appears.
There is a larger number whom
no education can alter, who for
ever will remain racialists and
bigots. But the majority of us
come somewhere in the middle.

We think of ourselves as pretty
nice average people leading fairly
pleasant lives. Our one fault is
that we fail to realize that what
is going on around us is our con
cern, that we cannot separate our
selves from humanity. We are
part and parcel of everything that
happens and bear a moral respon
sibility. It was the negation of re
sponsibility by both the individu
al and the European countries in
the thirties which helped the
holocaust.

It is clear from “Mein Kampf”
that there are two worlds. One is
composed of the Caesars who
know no tears, who have no con
science, whose hearts are of stone.
And there is the world of those
who possess the common heart of
humanity. The two worlds faced
each other in the thirties and at
the trial of Eichmann. The tusk
now is to decide with which world
we personally want to be associ
ated.
