IMMORAL WARFARE
Editor, The Daily:
Your comment on the immorali
ty of chemical and biological war
fare is well pointed. I have
clipped the editorial and sent it to
President Kennedy, whose pres
sure is needed to make the hear
ings public and to reactivate the
Kastenmeier resolution in the
House to stop this barbarity.
As a news reporter 10 years at
Frederick, Maryland, where this
operation is now concentrated, I
saw Fort Detrick in its early use
ful stage. Pentagon millions have
transformed it to Buchenwald
proportions and attributes of
which the nation is little aware.
It is well that you have publi
cized reports of the Army’s new
squeeze for funds to keep its pro
gram barreling. It’s the old game,
1962 version, ob'cured in inside
pages. Protesting letters to the
President and congressmen are
now timely.
You err only in saying: “It’s a
futile wish, but—.” We must first
assume that no democratic action
is futile. Keep leading the way
VV. W. Smith
