# And a Merry '30' to All
## 
### 
Today’s issue of The Daily
writes “30” to the story of
Volume 140.

A new chapter in Daily his
tory begins with Monday’s
paper—the first in Volume
141, which will be headed by
co-editors Ron Rapoport and
Judy Sklar.

Outgoing Editor Jerry Ran
kin would leave his readers
with this thought from Dis
raeli;

“The press is not only free,
it is powerful. That power is
ours. It is the proudest that
man can enjoy. It was, not
granted by monarchies; it
was not gained for us by
aristocracies: but it sprang
from the people, and, with an
immortal instinct, it has al
ways worked for the people.”
