# The 						World Is Coming To an End
## 
### 
A partial eclipse of the sun will
be visible on the Farm Sunday.
Starting at 4:54 p.m., the moon
will begin eclipsing the sun, cov
ering half the sunâ€™s surface at
sunset. Beneath the horizon the
eclipse will become total, dark
ening the South Pacific at mid
day.

I This phenomenon could bo well
! observed from Hoover Tower,
[which unfortunately closes at 4
; p.m. The next best observation
points arc in the hills at the foot
jof The Dish, or from atop the
Behavioral Sciences water tower.
Unless the world ends, as has
been predicted by some Indian as
trologers, the partial eclipse will
| be the most spectacular feature
I of an unusual conjunction of all
| bodies in the solar system visible
with the naked eye.
j In India yesterday, Hindu
priests and holy men embarked
on a series of 11th hour prayers
and rituals they hope will ward
off the evil effects of a planetary
traffic jam their astrologers say
will mean doom this weekend.
On our side of the sun will be
the Earth, the moon and first
planet Mercury. Beyond the sun
will be Venus, Mars, Jupiter and
Saturn. All will bo visible and es
pecially impressive at sunrise

and sunset, but would-be observ
ers are cautioned to use smoked
glass to prevent eye injury.
Should the world end as pre
j dieted, the hills are a good place
} to watch that, too. There one can
see the tidal waves before they
strike, feel the heat when it only
tingles and does not yet burn,
! smell the wafting brimstone be
fore it chokes.
