First field trip
Keep moving
One of the most Important rules of girl watching is this;
keep moving. In fact, it is always a good idea not only
to move, but to appear to be going somewhere. (This is
especially important on group field trips.) Beautiful girls,
although they enjoy being watched, arc instinctively sus
picious of strollers and downright fearful of loiterers.
The man who is walking briskly, who looks like he’s
“going places,” makes a better girl watcher. For one
thing, he sees more total girls and in the end he enjoys
his hobby more. (If you are planning an extended field
trip —to Paris and Rome, for example —be sure to pack
a couple of cartons of Pall Mall.)
