Prints
The bark cloth prints of the Hawaiian
Islands inspired us to design a new
collection of shirts completely
different in coloring and pattern.
We are sure you will want to
add one or more of these fine
shirts to your casual wardrobe.
Tailored so well it looks
personally measured. Button-down
collar-tapered waistline.
Long sleeves *5. 00
Short sleeves *4.00
