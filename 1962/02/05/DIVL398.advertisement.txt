Automatic cars with button and lever
controls may seem far out right now. But
Ford Motor Company scientists and engi
neers are busy prying out and buttoning
down some fantastic computer
controlled guidance systems for future
Ford-built cars.
Among the controls now under study at
Ford is a radar system that warns a
driver when he gets too close to the
vehicle ahead. Another is a short-range
radio frequency device that extends the
limits of drivers' senses by giving advance
information on road surface and weather
conditions, evaluating and appraising
obstacles in the driving path ahead.
When developed, control systems like
these will enable drivers to enjoy safer,
faster driving without fatigue.
Advanced studies of this nature are but
a part of a continuous and wide-ranging
program that has gained Ford its place
of leadership through scientific research
and engineering.
