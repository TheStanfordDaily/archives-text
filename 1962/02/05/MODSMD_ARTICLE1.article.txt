THE PROGRAM, according to
ST&T Chairman Rick Seifert, 's
designed to give freshmen gener-1
al information on which they may
base their preference for a living
group after the freshman year.
The rushing philosophies of the
clubs and fraternities as well as
answers to specific questions of
living conditions and require
ments in the various systems will
be brought out.
Hopefully, said Seifert, such
topics as the freshman’s role in |
rushing, the advantages for and!
against pledging, and the quali- i
ties each system looks for in a I
prospective member will be clari
fied. Mechanical aspects of the
rushing procedure will also be
discussed.
