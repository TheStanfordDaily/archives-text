BIGEST FISH CAUGHT in the Antarctic—52 inches and weighing 58 pounds—is held by Stanford Prof.
Donald E. Wohlschlag for inspection by Philip M. Smith, senior U.S. Antarctic Research representative,
and Rear Adm. David M. Tyree, commander of Operation Deepfreeze. Wohlschlag directs the only
biological station on the Antarctic sub-continent, located at McAAurdo Sound. He and eleven other
biologists collect and study marine life through holes chopped in the ice. Wohlschlag, and fifteen
other Stanford investigators, are among the more than 200 scientists working in the Antarctic "summer
season." They are working under National Science Foundation grants and contracts totalling nearly
$500,000.
