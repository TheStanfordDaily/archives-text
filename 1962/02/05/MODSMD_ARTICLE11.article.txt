# Moon Eclipses Sun But World Survives
## 
### 
Yesterday Stanfordites witnessed an eclipse of the sun, observ
ing it in little knots in the hills, at the bank of Lake Lag and by the
residences. The expected end of the world failed to take place, how
ever. Conditions were favorable for viewing. The haze was thick
enough to make the eclipse watchable through unshielded eyes,

hut was not so thick as to impair*
observation.
Shortly before 5 p.m. the moon
began blanking the sun’s surface.
First the lower edge of the sun
was flattened, then a round dent
appeared in it. The dent expanded
as the sun sank, covering half the
sun’s diameter by sunset.
ONE observation point, by the
Behavioral Sciences Center, had
about fifty viewers, ranging from
young families to sweatshirted
Roble girls to well dressed society
types. They oohed and ahhed, one
said, “Rather interesting,” then
they went home.
The Daily reporter at this rite
tried to watch from the top of the
water tower, but was called down
by a member of the Stanford Po
lice Force, hence missed most of
the eclipse.
There was little disappointment
at the Farm over the world not
ending, save perhaps among Civ
students who hoped to get out of
today’s midterm.
HINDUS an d Buddhists
throughout Asia prayed non stop
or bathed in chill, muddy and
sacred rivers yesterday to ward
off disaster brought on by the
stars. But in England an astrolo
ger reassured the world that
doomsday reports were a “ghast
ly mistake without foundation.”
The reassuring report came
from Keith Robertson, secretary
of the Aetherius Society, who
warned that the worst that could
happen would be for the earth to
“flip” on its axis when eight
heavenly bodies align themselves
in space.
While most of Asia seemed to
be recovering from the wide
spread fears, new terror was re
ported in New Guinea where na
tives told of the total eclipse of
the sun began the same fearful
preparations reported in India.
A DISPATCH from Lae, New
Guinea, said many villagers feared
they could be in for a long siege
of darkness when the sun swal
lows the moon. Man headed for
the hills and wore not expected
to reappear for a fortnight or so.
Newspapers and radio broad
casts in New Guinea reassured
natives the blackout would last
only a few minutes. But a mer
chant in Bulolo said one villager
still purchased seven four-gallon
containers of gerosene to light his
homo during a long period of
darkness.
The petrol purchaser explained
that he had heard the sun and
moon would enter into contact
and that it would take a long time
| to disentangle them. And in the
nearby Markham Valley natives
I built small grass huts to hide in

during the eclipse.
IN BERLIN, the American-run
radio station RIAS began its Sun
day program with the announce
ment “the world has not ended.
Our tea dance program will go on
as scheduled.” It played a song,
“There Will Be Music As Long As
The Clock Ticks, As Long As The
World Exists.”
And in London, Brig. R.C.W.G.
Firebrace, former president of the
Astrological Association and pres
ident of the College of Psychic
Science, said Hindu predictions of
doomsday because of the lineup
of the planets with the sun and
the moon were somewhat overly
dramatic.
“For instance,” he said, “a cer
tain formation I have drawn in my
map, my horoscope, they inter
pret as adultery with an aunt. But
this is certainly not true in case.”
A DISPATCH from Katmandu.
Nepal, said nothing happened
there Saturday night, and to
thousands of Nepalis it was quite
a relief. They had expected ca
lamity upon calamity, including
the physical destruction of a large
part of the Himalayan kingdom.
For Nepal the climax of the
“evil hours” came early yester
day. Most Katmandu residents
stayed awake all night chanting
prayers. Nearly every one aban
doned the city’s buildings for fear
of falling walls and spent the
night in open camps. Fortunately
the night was warmer than usual.

of the Aetherius Society, who
warned that the worst that could
happen would be for the earth to
“flip” on its axis when eight
heavenly bodies align themselves
in space.
While most of Asia seemed to
be recovering from the wide
spread fears, new terror was re
ported in New Guinea where na
tives told of the total eclipse of
the sun began the same fearful
preparations reported in India.
A DISPATCH from Lae, New
Guinea, said many villagers feared
they could be in for a long siege
of darkness when the sun swal
lows the moon. Man headed for
the hills and wore not expected
to reappear for a fortnight or so.
Newspapers and radio broad
casts in New Guinea reassured
natives the blackout would last
only a few minutes. But a mer
chant in Bulolo said one villager
still purchased seven four-gallon
containers of gerosene to light his
homo during a long period of
darkness.
The petrol purchaser explained
that he had heard the sun and
moon would enter into contact
and that it would take a long time
| to disentangle them. And in the
nearby Markham Valley natives
I built small grass huts to hide in

during the eclipse.
IN BERLIN, the American-run
radio station RIAS began its Sun
day program with the announce
ment “the world has not ended.
Our tea dance program will go on
as scheduled.” It played a song,
“There Will Be Music As Long As
The Clock Ticks, As Long As The
World Exists.”
And in London, Brig. R.C.W.G.
Firebrace, former president of the
Astrological Association and pres
ident of the College of Psychic
Science, said Hindu predictions of
doomsday because of the lineup
of the planets with the sun and
the moon were somewhat overly
dramatic.
“For instance,” he said, “a cer
tain formation I have drawn in my
map, my horoscope, they inter
pret as adultery with an aunt. But
this is certainly not true in case.”
A DISPATCH from Katmandu.
Nepal, said nothing happened
there Saturday night, and to
thousands of Nepalis it was quite
a relief. They had expected ca
lamity upon calamity, including
the physical destruction of a large
part of the Himalayan kingdom.
For Nepal the climax of the
“evil hours” came early yester
day. Most Katmandu residents
stayed awake all night chanting
prayers. Nearly every one aban
doned the city’s buildings for fear
of falling walls and spent the
night in open camps. Fortunately
the night was warmer than usual.


A STANFORD PHOTOGRAPHER awaits the world's end during the moon's eclipse of the sun yester
day afternoon at 4:54 p.m. Like everyone else he waited in vain for the astrologers' prediction of
domesday.
Yesterday Stanfordites witnessed an eclipse of the sun, observ
ing it in little knots in the hills, at the bank of Lake Lag and by the
residences. The expected end of the world failed to take place, how
ever. Conditions were favorable for viewing. The haze was thick
enough to make the eclipse watchable through unshielded eyes,

hut was not so thick as to impair*
observation.
Shortly before 5 p.m. the moon
began blanking the sun’s surface.
First the lower edge of the sun
was flattened, then a round dent
appeared in it. The dent expanded
as the sun sank, covering half the
sun’s diameter by sunset.
ONE observation point, by the
Behavioral Sciences Center, had
about fifty viewers, ranging from
young families to sweatshirted
Roble girls to well dressed society
types. They oohed and ahhed, one
said, “Rather interesting,” then
they went home.
The Daily reporter at this rite
tried to watch from the top of the
water tower, but was called down
by a member of the Stanford Po
lice Force, hence missed most of
the eclipse.
There was little disappointment
at the Farm over the world not
ending, save perhaps among Civ
students who hoped to get out of
today’s midterm.
HINDUS an d Buddhists
throughout Asia prayed non stop
or bathed in chill, muddy and
sacred rivers yesterday to ward
off disaster brought on by the
stars. But in England an astrolo

doomsday reports were a “ghast

ident of the College of Psychic
Science, said Hindu predictions of
doomsday because of the lineup
of the planets with the sun and
the moon were somewhat overly
dramatic.
“For instance,” he said, “a cer
tain formation I have drawn in my
map, my horoscope, they inter
pret as adultery with an aunt. But
this is certainly not true in case.”
A DISPATCH from Katmandu.
Nepal, said nothing happened
there Saturday night, and to
thousands of Nepalis it was quite
a relief. They had expected ca
lamity upon calamity, including
the physical destruction of a large
part of the Himalayan kingdom.
For Nepal the climax of the
“evil hours” came early yester
day. Most Katmandu residents
stayed awake all night chanting
prayers. Nearly every one aban
doned the city’s buildings for fear
of falling walls and spent the
night in open camps. Fortunately
the night was warmer than usual.


A STANFORD PHOTOGRAPHER awaits the world's end during the moon's eclipse of the sun yester
day afternoon at 4:54 p.m. Like everyone else he waited in vain for the astrologers' prediction of
domesday.
Yesterday Stanfordites witnessed an eclipse of the sun, observ
ing it in little knots in the hills, at the bank of Lake Lag and by the
residences. The expected end of the world failed to take place, how
ever. Conditions were favorable for viewing. The haze was thick
enough to make the eclipse watchable through unshielded eyes,

hut was not so thick as to impair*
observation.
Shortly before 5 p.m. the moon
began blanking the sun’s surface.
First the lower edge of the sun
was flattened, then a round dent
appeared in it. The dent expanded
as the sun sank, covering half the
sun’s diameter by sunset.
ONE observation point, by the
Behavioral Sciences Center, had
about fifty viewers, ranging from
young families to sweatshirted
Roble girls to well dressed society
types. They oohed and ahhed, one
said, “Rather interesting,” then
they went home.
The Daily reporter at this rite
tried to watch from the top of the
water tower, but was called down
by a member of the Stanford Po
lice Force, hence missed most of
the eclipse.
There was little disappointment
at the Farm over the world not
ending, save perhaps among Civ
students who hoped to get out of
today’s midterm.
HINDUS an d Buddhists
throughout Asia prayed non stop
or bathed in chill, muddy and
sacred rivers yesterday to ward
off disaster brought on by the
stars. But in England an astrolo
ger reassured the world that
doomsday reports were a “ghast
ly mistake without foundation.”
The reassuring report came
from Keith Robertson, secretary
of the Aetherius Society, who
warned that the worst that could
happen would be for the earth to
“flip” on its axis when eight
heavenly bodies align themselves
in space.
While most of Asia seemed to
be recovering from the wide
spread fears, new terror was re
ported in New Guinea where na
tives told of the total eclipse of
the sun began the same fearful
preparations reported in India.
A DISPATCH from Lae, New
Guinea, said many villagers feared
they could be in for a long siege
of darkness when the sun swal
lows the moon. Man headed for
the hills and wore not expected
to reappear for a fortnight or so.
Newspapers and radio broad
casts in New Guinea reassured
natives the blackout would last
only a few minutes. But a mer
chant in Bulolo said one villager
still purchased seven four-gallon
containers of gerosene to light his
homo during a long period of
darkness.
The petrol purchaser explained
that he had heard the sun and
moon would enter into contact
and that it would take a long time
| to disentangle them. And in the
nearby Markham Valley natives
I built small grass huts to hide in

during the eclipse.
IN BERLIN, the American-run
radio station RIAS began its Sun
day program with the announce
ment “the world has not ended.
Our tea dance program will go on
as scheduled.” It played a song,
“There Will Be Music As Long As
The Clock Ticks, As Long As The
World Exists.”
And in London, Brig. R.C.W.G.

Astrological Association and pres
ident of the College of Psychic
Science, said Hindu predictions of
doomsday because of the lineup
of the planets with the sun and
