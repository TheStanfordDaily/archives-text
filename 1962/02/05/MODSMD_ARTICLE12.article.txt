## 'U.S. Faces Challenge' 
### 
Policies of military contain
ment and negative anti-Commu
nism are no longer adequate for
America to maintain world lead
ership, a State Department offi
cial said Friday at Stanford Uni
versity.
Addressing the final session of
Stanford's fifth Foreign Policy In
stitute, Theodore C. Achilles, as
sistant to the Undersecretary of
Stale for Political Affairs, said:
“It is not enough merely to be
against something or to react. We
must be positive and dynamic.
We must get on with the job of
helping to shape the kind of world
we would want to see if Marxist-
Leninism had never existed.”
During the past four decades,
Achilles noted, once great coloni
al empires have disintegrated.
But offsetting this fragmentation
has been the “fantastic strides”
toward economic and political
unity in Western Europe, Includ
ing the U.S., the Atlantic Com
munity now enjoys a total pur
chasing power more than twice
that of the Sino-Soviet world.
This community of free na
tions should develop “far beyond”
the borders of the Atlantic, Achil
les said.
