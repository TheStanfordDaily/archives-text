# Dear Sir or Madam: The Editorial 'We'
## 
### 
In making a reality of the editorial “we,” we have been the butt
of a good deal of humor. Hon Rapoport’s becoming a Co-Ed (neat
est trick of the week) is rivaled only by the quip that letters to the
Editor now must be addressed Dear Sir or Madam,
The problem raised by this humor must of course be considered
carefully. How well will a co-Editorship work? How can a split of
responsibility be successful?
We did not make this decision hastily. We have both given it
a great deal of thought, and we expect Co-Editors to work extremely
well.
The two of us are compatible in our political and editorial judg
ment, and we feed confident that we can maintain a consistent and
uncompromised editorial position working together. We will not
divide the responsibility for what appears in this column and on
this page; i.e„ letters should be directed to both Sir and Madam,
Editors, The Daily.
Each of us will do his own writing, and in order to maintain
continuity, one of tis will take full charge of any given issue, from
the initial investigation of it to the last editorial or article that ap
pears.
We will split the heavy load of mechanical work that goes into
putting out a newspaper to give ourselves more time to improve the
quality of both the content and writing of the Daily.
While one of us puts out page two and supervises page one
production, the other w ill lx l doing the searching for material that
makes a newspaper interesting and valuable reading.
We intend to tap every news source and every evaluative and
critical source that we can find, giving the fullest possible coverage
to every event of interest to the campus.
TI ic Daily is not an ordinary newspaper, and it does not have
to cater to every man’s reading taste. We expect our readers to
demand intelligent and thoughtful investigation of a great many
issues; we intend to give it to them in all the space that The Daily
has.
The quote from Tom Paine in the mast below is indicative of
the tone we hope to set in this volume.
