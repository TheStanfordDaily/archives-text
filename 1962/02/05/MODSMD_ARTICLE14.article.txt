# Schwarz Ran Into Rough Going With SF Crusade
## 
### 
Dr. Fred C. Schwarz, founding
father of the Christian Anti-Com
munism Crusade, who has scored
some easy triumphs in the evan
gelical swamps of Southern Cal
ifornia. arrived in San Francisco
with full knowledge that he was
moving into a somewhat more
skeptical and critical community.
An expert in one-upmanship,
Dr. Schwarz at once placed the
community on the defensive; Ni
kita Khrushchev, he gravely
warned, had long had his eye on
San Francisco. It was, ho implied,
a kind of Gomorrah of the West
Coast, whose Chamber of Com
merce was a horrible example of
“how Communism can exploit the
personal self-interest of a group”
the chamber had urged a pro
gram of trade with Red China.
BUT THE community declined
the bait, and let Dr. Schwarz talk
on and on. Having given him a
genei’ous allowance of space in
which an astute reporter (Charles
Raudebaugh) encouraged him to
parade his non sequiturs, the
San Francisco Chronicle proceed
ed to speak its mind editorially.
"We regard San Francisco,” the
editorial said, “as healthy, toler
ant, alert and intelligent, under
standing the nature of Commu
nism and unsusceptible to the
flimsy blandishments of Marx
ism; it is a free and confident
city, in no need for such salva
tion as the good doctor now of

fers.” But more bad news for Dr.
Schwarz was yet to come.
In a letter sent to more than a
thousand churches and syna
gogues, a committee of the lead
ers of the principal Protestant
churches in Northern California,
joined by the president of the
Northern California Board of Rab
bis, let the one time “lay” Baptist
evangelist have it from both
barrels.
NOTING THAT while the Cru
sade denies having a “program,”
the letter pointed out that the or
ganization had sponsored speak
ers who had raised suspicions
against churches, schools and
universities that could bo “most
destructive to our society in gen
eral.”
“Frustration and fear,” not in
telligent action, seemed to be the
aim of these speakers. In a word,
the statement suggested that the
Crusade was out, not to save our
democracy, but to destroy It. Such
rough handling the good Dr.
Schwarz has not received since
he was a student at the Universi
ty of Queensland making
speeches that should be better
known by his admirers on the
West Coast.
San Francisco is, indeed, a free
and confident city, and once again
it has set an admirable example
to communities less free and less
confident.
