I ment on the activities of a Stan
j ford political organization.)

On January 18, 1962, thp San
Mateo County Young Reput)licans
held their annual election, an elec
tion with which all Stanford Re
[ publicans should be proud. A
[week or so before the election,
j word of a free beer party spread
through the Stanford campus. All
you had to do for your beer was
to come and vote (presumably for
Stanford’s candidate) at the coun
ty election. No need to worry
about not being a Stanford Area
Young Republican (SAYR» mem
ber; the hierarchy would supply
you with a card.
Then came election eve. ‘‘Buses
will leave at 7:30 tonight; any
body who wants to go, we’ll give
| them a fake card.” Jim Scnsen
| brenner, Stanford delegation floor
| leader, announced to Madera dur
ing dinner.
AFTER DIN N E R, several
SAYR big-wigs came info Madera,
including Dan Cullen, SAYR Pro
gram Vice President, and Dick
Noble. Mr. Noble is currently Na
tional Executive Board member
of the Young Americans for Free
dom (a conservative group) and
Treasurer of the California
Young Republicans.
He is considered to control the
SAYR Machine. When questioned
about cards, Mr. Noble said,
‘‘You’ll get your fake cards on the
bus.” Some of the hierarchy went
into several Madera rooms for the
purpose of recruiting freshman
voters. Free beer was mentioned.
Shortly afterwards, I walked
up to Ross Hermann, Stanford’s
famed defender of the American
Ideal. He was standing in front
of three buses that were to pro
vide free transportation for all
who wanted it. I had not met Mr.
Hermann before, so I introduced
myself and inquired about SAYR
membership.
HE HANDED me a membership
card (he had a stack of them)
and told me it cost two dollars. I
told him I thought they were
free. “No, but I could loan it for

the evening, if you want to go ;
up,” ho replied. As I walked (
away, students (mostly fresh-!.'
men) who had little interest in an I i
election were entering the buses | ]
in expectation of the free beer 1 I
party afterwards.
'Die so-called “fake cards” ap
peal’ to have been of two types. | ,
Most of them were probably | i
proxy cards. I have talked to stu- 1 ,
dents who gave their SAVR cards
and student body cards to the or- ,
ganization. I have also talked to
students who used such cards to
vote, and who were not SAYR ,
members.
The second type of “fake card” !
was a bona fide membership card, (
which was given to the new mem- j'
her free of charge. Biff Barker, '
for example, received such a free
card shortly before the county,
election. His free card is valid for
the year.
IF ONE is to believe the SAYR
literature sent to members, the
“anti-Stanford” faction at the
county election was equally ir
responsible. It is reported that
they imported “volunters” from !
Berkeley, San Francisco, and even ;
Fresno, 2.10 miles away.
This type of SAYR activity |
seems to have been going on for !
at least the past three county |
“elections.” According to a former i
officer of the SAYR, who fought |
unsuccessfully against the Ma- i
chine, the posters for the 1960 1
election were decorated with a i
cocktail glass, “which resulted in
Mr. Noble seeing the interior of
the Dean’s office,” This former j
officer also told me that students j
from Stern Hall received free |
cards shortly before the 1961 |
county election.
“The political purpose of the J
Young Republicans has been thor-1
oughly subverted and destroyed j
by this type of approach,” con-1
eluded the ex-officer. Although \
the Machine presently has a tight
hold on the SAYR, a re-election
can be forced if 20 per cent of the
SAYR membership signs a peti- j
lion for this purpose. There is i
also a scheduled election for May I
of this year.

On January 18, 1962, thp San
Mateo County Young Reput)licans
held their annual election, an elec
tion with which all Stanford Re
[ publicans should be proud. A
[week or so before the election,
j word of a free beer party spread
through the Stanford campus. All
you had to do for your beer was
to come and vote (presumably for
Stanford’s candidate) at the coun
ty election. No need to worry
about not being a Stanford Area
Young Republican (SAYR» mem
ber; the hierarchy would supply
you with a card.
Then came election eve. ‘‘Buses
will leave at 7:30 tonight; any
body who wants to go, we’ll give
| them a fake card.” Jim Scnsen
| brenner, Stanford delegation floor
| leader, announced to Madera dur
ing dinner.
AFTER DIN N E R, several
SAYR big-wigs came info Madera,
including Dan Cullen, SAYR Pro
gram Vice President, and Dick
Noble. Mr. Noble is currently Na
tional Executive Board member
of the Young Americans for Free
dom (a conservative group) and
Treasurer of the California
Young Republicans.
He is considered to control the
SAYR Machine. When questioned
about cards, Mr. Noble said,
‘‘You’ll get your fake cards on the
bus.” Some of the hierarchy went
into several Madera rooms for the
purpose of recruiting freshman
voters. Free beer was mentioned.
Shortly afterwards, I walked
up to Ross Hermann, Stanford’s
famed defender of the American
Ideal. He was standing in front
of three buses that were to pro
vide free transportation for all
who wanted it. I had not met Mr.
Hermann before, so I introduced
myself and inquired about SAYR
membership.
HE HANDED me a membership
card (he had a stack of them)
and told me it cost two dollars. I
told him I thought they were
free. “No, but I could loan it for

the evening, if you want to go ;
up,” ho replied. As I walked (
away, students (mostly fresh-!.'
men) who had little interest in an I i
election were entering the buses | ]
in expectation of the free beer 1 I
party afterwards.
'Die so-called “fake cards” ap
peal’ to have been of two types. | ,
Most of them were probably | i
proxy cards. I have talked to stu- 1 ,
dents who gave their SAVR cards
and student body cards to the or- ,
ganization. I have also talked to
students who used such cards to
vote, and who were not SAYR ,
members.
The second type of “fake card” !
was a bona fide membership card, (
which was given to the new mem- j'
her free of charge. Biff Barker, '
for example, received such a free
card shortly before the county,
election. His free card is valid for
the year.
IF ONE is to believe the SAYR
literature sent to members, the
“anti-Stanford” faction at the
county election was equally ir
responsible. It is reported that
they imported “volunters” from !
Berkeley, San Francisco, and even ;
Fresno, 2.10 miles away.
This type of SAYR activity |
seems to have been going on for !
at least the past three county |
“elections.” According to a former i
officer of the SAYR, who fought |
unsuccessfully against the Ma- i
chine, the posters for the 1960 1
election were decorated with a i
cocktail glass, “which resulted in
Mr. Noble seeing the interior of
the Dean’s office,” This former j
officer also told me that students j
from Stern Hall received free |
cards shortly before the 1961 |
county election.

On January 18, 1962, thp San
Mateo County Young Reput)licans
held their annual election, an elec
tion with which all Stanford Re
[ publicans should be proud. A
[week or so before the election,
j word of a free beer party spread
through the Stanford campus. All
you had to do for your beer was
to come and vote (presumably for
Stanford’s candidate) at the coun
ty election. No need to worry
about not being a Stanford Area
Young Republican (SAYR» mem
ber; the hierarchy would supply
you with a card.
Then came election eve. ‘‘Buses
will leave at 7:30 tonight; any
body who wants to go, we’ll give
| them a fake card.” Jim Scnsen
| brenner, Stanford delegation floor
| leader, announced to Madera dur
ing dinner.
AFTER DIN N E R, several
SAYR big-wigs came info Madera,
including Dan Cullen, SAYR Pro
gram Vice President, and Dick
Noble. Mr. Noble is currently Na
tional Executive Board member
of the Young Americans for Free
dom (a conservative group) and
Treasurer of the California
Young Republicans.
He is considered to control the
SAYR Machine. When questioned
about cards, Mr. Noble said,
‘‘You’ll get your fake cards on the
bus.” Some of the hierarchy went
into several Madera rooms for the
purpose of recruiting freshman
voters. Free beer was mentioned.
Shortly afterwards, I walked
up to Ross Hermann, Stanford’s
famed defender of the American
Ideal. He was standing in front
of three buses that were to pro
vide free transportation for all
who wanted it. I had not met Mr.
Hermann before, so I introduced
myself and inquired about SAYR
membership.
HE HANDED me a membership
card (he had a stack of them)
and told me it cost two dollars. I
told him I thought they were
free. “No, but I could loan it for

the evening, if you want to go ;
up,” ho replied. As I walked (
away, students (mostly fresh-!.'
men) who had little interest in an I i
election were entering the buses | ]
in expectation of the free beer 1 I
party afterwards.
'Die so-called “fake cards” ap
peal’ to have been of two types. | ,
Most of them were probably | i
proxy cards. I have talked to stu- 1 ,
dents who gave their SAVR cards
and student body cards to the or- ,
ganization. I have also talked to
students who used such cards to
vote, and who were not SAYR ,
members.
The second type of “fake card” !
was a bona fide membership card, (
which was given to the new mem- j'
her free of charge. Biff Barker, '
for example, received such a free
card shortly before the county,
election. His free card is valid for
the year.
IF ONE is to believe the SAYR
literature sent to members, the
“anti-Stanford” faction at the
county election was equally ir
responsible. It is reported that
they imported “volunters” from !
Berkeley, San Francisco, and even ;
Fresno, 2.10 miles away.
This type of SAYR activity |
seems to have been going on for !
at least the past three county |
“elections.” According to a former i
officer of the SAYR, who fought |
unsuccessfully against the Ma- i
chine, the posters for the 1960 1
election were decorated with a i
cocktail glass, “which resulted in
Mr. Noble seeing the interior of
the Dean’s office,” This former j
officer also told me that students j
from Stern Hall received free |
cards shortly before the 1961 |
