Editor, The Daily:
Everyone at Stanford, Ameri
can and foreign students alike,
should welcome Doktor Warm
brunn’s excellent article. On my
part, as a foreign student, I would
like to make only a few comple
mentary remarks.
Communication between two
groups or two individuals is al
ways a two-way proposition; it
cannot be otherwise. One’s searcli
for friendship is bound to fail if
not reciprocated. In this regard
the responsibility rests equally on
(lie American and the foreign stu
dent.
DOKTOR Warmbrunn’s article
is directed towards the majority
on campus, towards the American
students. But for the sake of com
pleteness, one should take a look
at Ihe other side of the coin. Are
we foreign students doing every
thing in our power to add our
share in building up the bridge
that links us?
Generalizations are unfair, but
it is safe to say that after the hec
tic and happy days of pre-regis
tration when all the hindering
factors mentioned by Doktor
Warmhrunn begin to work, the
reaction on the part of the foreign
student is all too often a kind of
defiant sulkiness, stemming from
a feeling of being rejected or at
least not being accepted.
THE KESUET is the lonely for
eign student, associating only
with his own kind, brooding in the
dark corners of the I-Center, be
ing critical of America and Amer
icans without knowing them and
without trying to get to know
them. Remembering all the ob
| stacles one may enter now a
vicious circle; the foreign student
i is unhappy because he is not ao
j cepted, and he is not trying to be
I accepted because he is unhappy.
Is there any cure then? Yes,
but only if the foreign student too
does his share and does not sit
back and wait for the plums to
I fall into his mouth. Administra
[ tive measures are useful, but the
■ obstacles will be overcome only
by a mutual effort.

MUTUAL EFFORT
Editor, The Daily:
Everyone at Stanford, Ameri
can and foreign students alike,
should welcome Doktor Warm
brunn’s excellent article. On my
part, as a foreign student, I would
like to make only a few comple
mentary remarks.
Communication between two
groups or two individuals is al
ways a two-way proposition; it
cannot be otherwise. One’s searcli
for friendship is bound to fail if
not reciprocated. In this regard
the responsibility rests equally on
(lie American and the foreign stu
dent.
DOKTOR Warmbrunn’s article
is directed towards the majority
on campus, towards the American
students. But for the sake of com
pleteness, one should take a look
at Ihe other side of the coin. Are
we foreign students doing every
thing in our power to add our
share in building up the bridge
that links us?
