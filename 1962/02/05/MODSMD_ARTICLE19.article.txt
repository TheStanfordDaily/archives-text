# HONORS PROGRAM IN HUMANITIES
## 'Potential Lost in Generality' 
### CLIFF PROBST 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the

For the Subcommittee on Aca
demic Review

The purpose of the Honors Pro
gram in Humanities is “to de
velop in its students a greater
sense of the relatedness of vari
ous fields of knowledge and ex
perience, and to increase their
awareness of basic values—intel
lectual. aesthetic, social, and ethi
cal.” This is, indeed, a noble pur
pose. No one can deny the great
need for such a program at Stan
ford. In fact, seven academic de
partments recommend the Hon
ors Program as a minor. Honors
in Humanities, more than any
other department in the Univer
sity, has the potential of giving
the student a dynamic, vital edu
cation.
Unfortunately for Stanford stu
dents who are seeking something
more than job training, the Hon
ors Program in Humanities does
not accomplish its purpose. The
attempts to relate “various fields
of knowledge and experience”
bogs down in vague generaliza
tions, and the individual is left to
determine his own “basic values.”
OUT OF the thirteen courses
the Honors Program offers, four
deal with the personalities of sig
nificant individuals. This particu
lar series of course attempts to
provide some knowledge of per
sonality in general, and to help
the student understand his own
life through an examination of
the lives of world figures. These
courses fail because their two ob
jectives are not unified. In at
tempting both they accomplish
neither, and the frustrated stu
dent falls somew'here in between,
pondering the mystical signifi
cance of the statement: “There is
a little of Hitler in each of us.”
It seems hardly necessary to have
four courses fail in this manner.
One would suffice.
The most popular courses in
the Honors Program are the
World Literature series. This
series is the greatest disappoint
ment of all, for the reading list is
brilliant. The works assigned ri
val those in any other course in
the university for their compre
hensiveness and their challenge
to the student.
HOWEVER, the department is
not content to consider the works
and the ideas they express as in
dividual masterpieces. The stifl
ing approach of the lecturers is
to consider each assignment as an
example of a trend, and to place
the trends in a direct, causal re
lationship. The student copies
these trends in his notbook, mem
orizes, and happily regurgitates
them on the final exam. In this
way, the true literary and philo
sophical value of the works is ob
scured.
The lecturers should also be
criticized individually; the first
for his rambling and emphasis on
sox, the second for his over-gener
alizations, and the third for forc
ing over-simplified ideas into out
line form. The sections, which
should provide a free discussion
of the works and ideas, could be
the most rewarding part of the
course. Unfortunately, they are
led for the most part by opinion
ated and inept graduate students.
The interdepartmental seminar
on aesthetics and the one on phi
losophy and history are to be
commended for their dynamic ap
proach and leadership, which the
other courses lack.
THE host valuable part of the
Honors Program is, without a

doubt, the senior essay. In the
writing of the essay, ‘‘a critical
exploration of a subject of rele
vance to more than one field of
knowledge,” the student comes
closest to realizing the goals
which the department has set.
The disappointment comes from
the realization that, due to the im
potent approach of most of his
courses, the student has had to
accomplish the program’s pur
pose by himself. The courses
should lead the student to the

culmination of his grasp of
knowledge in the essay. That they
do not is the real failure of the
program.
The Honors Program in Hu
manities needs a revitalization,
and, in some cases, a reorganiza
tion. The student should be chal
lenged by “living” ideas, not the
over-general, historical outline.
To increase the students’ “aware
ness of basic values,” the courses
must make those values “real” to
the students.

to the student.
HOWEVER, the department is
not content to consider the works
and the ideas they express as in

to consider each assignment as an
example of a trend, and to place
the trends in a direct, causal re

these trends in his notbook, mem
orizes, and happily regurgitates
them on the final exam. In this

for his rambling and emphasis on

writing of the essay, ‘‘a critical
exploration of a subject of rele

which the department has set.
The disappointment comes from
the realization that, due to the im
potent approach of most of his
courses, the student has had to
accomplish the program’s pur
pose by himself. The courses
should lead the student to the

culmination of his grasp of
knowledge in the essay. That they
do not is the real failure of the
program.
The Honors Program in Hu

and, in some cases, a reorganiza

over-general, historical outline.

ness of basic values,” the courses
must make those values “real” to
the students.

THE host valuable part of the
Honors Program is, without a

which the department has set.
The disappointment comes from
the realization that, due to the im
potent approach of most of his
courses, the student has had to
accomplish the program’s pur

The Honors Program in Hu

To increase the students’ “aware
ness of basic values,” the courses
must make those values “real” to
the students.

The purpose of the Honors Pro
gram in Humanities is “to de
velop in its students a greater
sense of the relatedness of vari
ous fields of knowledge and ex
perience, and to increase their
awareness of basic values—intel
lectual. aesthetic, social, and ethi
cal.” This is, indeed, a noble pur
pose. No one can deny the great
need for such a program at Stan
ford. In fact, seven academic de
partments recommend the Hon
ors Program as a minor. Honors
in Humanities, more than any
other department in the Univer
sity, has the potential of giving
the student a dynamic, vital edu
cation.
Unfortunately for Stanford stu
dents who are seeking something
more than job training, the Hon
ors Program in Humanities does
not accomplish its purpose. The
attempts to relate “various fields
of knowledge and experience”
bogs down in vague generaliza
tions, and the individual is left to
determine his own “basic values.”
OUT OF the thirteen courses
the Honors Program offers, four
deal with the personalities of sig
nificant individuals. This particu
lar series of course attempts to
provide some knowledge of per
sonality in general, and to help
the student understand his own
life through an examination of
the lives of world figures. These
courses fail because their two ob
jectives are not unified. In at
tempting both they accomplish
neither, and the frustrated stu
dent falls somew'here in between,
pondering the mystical signifi
cance of the statement: “There is
a little of Hitler in each of us.”
It seems hardly necessary to have
four courses fail in this manner.
One would suffice.
The most popular courses in
the Honors Program are the
World Literature series. This
series is the greatest disappoint
ment of all, for the reading list is
brilliant. The works assigned ri
val those in any other course in
the university for their compre
hensiveness and their challenge
to the student.
HOWEVER, the department is
not content to consider the works
and the ideas they express as in
dividual masterpieces. The stifl
ing approach of the lecturers is
to consider each assignment as an
example of a trend, and to place
the trends in a direct, causal re
lationship. The student copies
these trends in his notbook, mem
orizes, and happily regurgitates
them on the final exam. In this
way, the true literary and philo
sophical value of the works is ob
scured.
The lecturers should also be
criticized individually; the first
for his rambling and emphasis on
sox, the second for his over-gener
alizations, and the third for forc
ing over-simplified ideas into out
line form. The sections, which
should provide a free discussion
of the works and ideas, could be
the most rewarding part of the
course. Unfortunately, they are
led for the most part by opinion
ated and inept graduate students.
