# URBAN AFFAIRS BILL
## Walter Lippmann 
### 
In the political hullabaloo about
the proposed Department of Ur
ban Affairs and Housing, it is use
ful to remember that the Depart
ment will possess no new Federal
powers and will possess no new
money to spend. All the powers
which are to be in the new De
partment have long since been
voted by Congress. These powers
will come from four existing
agencies and all the Department
will be able to spend is what Con
gress has authorized these agen
cies to spend. For this is a reor
ganization and not a new grant
of power.
What ground, then, is there for
thinking that the new Depart
ment creates anything new? Can
it do anything which cannot al
ready be done by one of the four
constituent agencies? The answer
is, it seems to me, that it can fo
cus attention on the mounting
problems of the cities and of the
metropolitan areas. It can bring
together and encourage those
who know and care about these
problems, and it can do much to
get them a hearing.
THE NEW Department will
have no power and no money to
re-plan the old cities and to plan
the development of the new met
ropolitan areas. But it can pro
mote the studies which must pre
cede the replanning and the de
velopment. This will have to be
done in order to make life decent
and convenient for the three
quarters of the American people
who live in urban areas. Over and
above the work of the old agen
cies which would be grouped in
the new Department, it would bo
essentially a department of re
search and education in urban af
fairs.

AS FOR the politics which now
swirl about the proposal, the fact
is that there would have been
little of it had the Republican
leaders not made so much ado
about nothing. It was wrong and
it was foolish of them to gang up
with a few Southern Democrats
in the House Rules Committee in
order to refuse to let the House
vote on the proposal. On what
principal, constitutional, moral, or
political, can it be argued that the
House of Representatives should
not be allowed to vote on a pro
posal made by the President of
the United States?

This wrong was a silly one to
commit because the Republican
leaders seem to have forgotten
that the President could force the
House to have a chance to vote by
doing with the Department of Ur
ban Affairs what President Eisen
hower did with the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare

to send it to Congress under the
Reorganization Act of 1949. If
there was any political trap in all

this, the Republican leaders laid
the trap into which they have fal
len. They should not have forgot
ten the Reorganization Act of
1949.
I DO not know what part the
proposed appointment of Mr.
Weaver has played in promoting
the coalition of Southern Demo
crats and Republicans. Mr. Weav
er is already the head of the
Housing Administration, which
will be the largest component of
the Department, and a refusal to
promote him when he is so pre
eminently qualified could have
been explained only as racial dis
crimination.
Nevertheless, he is no doubt
the main reason for the opposi
tion of the Southern Democrats.
But he cannot be the reason for
the opposition of the Republican
leaders who are making all sorts
of gestures, no doubt sincerely,
to prove themselves to be friends
of Negro voters.
I cannot help thinking that the
Republicans did not slop to con
sider what they were doing, and
that they acted on their reflexes,
which take it for granted that any
new proposal to deal with the
changing world is automatically
undesirable.

that the President could force the
House to have a chance to vote by
doing with the Department of Ur
ban Affairs what President Eisen
hower did with the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare

to send it to Congress under the
Reorganization Act of 1949. If
there was any political trap in all

this, the Republican leaders laid
the trap into which they have fal
len. They should not have forgot
ten the Reorganization Act of
1949.
I DO not know what part the
proposed appointment of Mr.
Weaver has played in promoting
the coalition of Southern Demo
crats and Republicans. Mr. Weav
er is already the head of the
Housing Administration, which
will be the largest component of
the Department, and a refusal to
promote him when he is so pre
eminently qualified could have
been explained only as racial dis
crimination.
Nevertheless, he is no doubt
the main reason for the opposi
tion of the Southern Democrats.
But he cannot be the reason for
the opposition of the Republican
leaders who are making all sorts
of gestures, no doubt sincerely,
to prove themselves to be friends
of Negro voters.
I cannot help thinking that the
Republicans did not slop to con
sider what they were doing, and
that they acted on their reflexes,
which take it for granted that any
new proposal to deal with the
changing world is automatically
undesirable.

In the political hullabaloo about
the proposed Department of Ur
ban Affairs and Housing, it is use
ful to remember that the Depart
ment will possess no new Federal
powers and will possess no new
money to spend. All the powers
which are to be in the new De
partment have long since been
voted by Congress. These powers
will come from four existing
agencies and all the Department
will be able to spend is what Con
gress has authorized these agen
cies to spend. For this is a reor
ganization and not a new grant
of power.
What ground, then, is there for
thinking that the new Depart
ment creates anything new? Can
it do anything which cannot al
ready be done by one of the four
constituent agencies? The answer
is, it seems to me, that it can fo
cus attention on the mounting
problems of the cities and of the
metropolitan areas. It can bring
together and encourage those
who know and care about these
problems, and it can do much to
get them a hearing.
THE NEW Department will
have no power and no money to
re-plan the old cities and to plan
the development of the new met
ropolitan areas. But it can pro
mote the studies which must pre
cede the replanning and the de
velopment. This will have to be
done in order to make life decent
and convenient for the three
quarters of the American people
who live in urban areas. Over and
above the work of the old agen
cies which would be grouped in
the new Department, it would bo
essentially a department of re
search and education in urban af
fairs.

AS FOR the politics which now
swirl about the proposal, the fact
is that there would have been
little of it had the Republican
leaders not made so much ado
about nothing. It was wrong and
it was foolish of them to gang up
with a few Southern Democrats
in the House Rules Committee in
order to refuse to let the House
vote on the proposal. On what
principal, constitutional, moral, or
political, can it be argued that the
House of Representatives should
not be allowed to vote on a pro
posal made by the President of
the United States?

This wrong was a silly one to
commit because the Republican
leaders seem to have forgotten
that the President could force the
House to have a chance to vote by
doing with the Department of Ur
ban Affairs what President Eisen
hower did with the Department of
