ANTI-COMMUNISM SCHOOL
Editor, The Dally:
Last year in political science we
were taught that one of the tricks
of propaganda is guilt by associ
ation. For instance, it was pointed
out to us by our teacher that a
certain Southern California news
paper during the presidential
campaign would often print re
ports of Kennedy’s campaign ac
tivities next to articles on com
munist activities, in hopes that
readers would subconsciously
connect Kennedy with commu
nism.
I FEEL that an even more ob
vious employment of this trick
has been used against Dr. Fred
Schwarz and his Christian Anti-
Communism Crusade. Somewhere
someone started the story that
Schwarz is a lunatic rightist be
cause he is against communism,
and everyone seems to have join
ed the band wagon. Why is it that
anyone who speaks out against
the danger of communism is im
mediately branded a “rabid right
ist?” Can’t one merely bo a patri
otic American (or in this case Au
stralian), liberal or conservative,
Republican or Democrat, and still
be against a system which, as
Herter said on Tuesday, has
promised time and time again to
conquer the world?
I realize I am not qualified to
render a judgment on Schwarz’s
school, for unlike John Howard,
the author of Tuesday’s attack on
Schwarz. I have not done research
about his school by reading books
and second-hand accounts about
the speakers; I have merely been
to the school and seen it at work.
FIRST, Herbert Philbrick, au
thor of "I Led Three Lives” de
scribed the communist espionage
and subversion the F. 8.1. is com
batting. Then Schwarz spoke. He
made no emotional harangues or
wild and irrational Robert Welch
ian charges of conspiracy being
all around us; he merely laid the
facts before us, describing com
munism, its ideals and goals. He
then concluded by advising us to
hold onto our religion and demo
cratic system, for he felt they are
the greatest weapon against com
munism.
Therefore, only on the basis of
what I myself have seen, I feel
that Howard’s attack is unfair,
for he is giving a distorted picture
of the school. He attacks the
school mainly by using a tech

nique of false logic, Poisoning the
Well—discrediting and ridiculing
the speakers at the school by call
ing them names instead of evalu
ating what they say at the school.

“STANFORD’S OWN”
Editor, The Daily;
In Friday’s movie review “Mein

Kampf” I noticed the following
statement: “But let it not bo for
gotten that the Warsaw ghetto
would never have been possible
but for the attitude of the Poles
themselves.” To any student of
the German occupation policies
the statement speaks for itself
and is, therefore, not worth argu
ing. What puzzles me, however,

is why this kind of nonsense lias
been continuously reappearing on
this campus in speeches and pub
lications. Is it due to the ignor
ance of individuals or, perhaps,
to some peculiar “Stanford own”
interpretation of history: original,
shrewd, unique buy it!?

the German occupation policies
the statement speaks for itself
and is, therefore, not worth argu

is why this kind of nonsense lias
been continuously reappearing on

to some peculiar “Stanford own”
interpretation of history: original,

ANTI-COMMUNISM SCHOOL
Editor, The Dally:
Last year in political science we
were taught that one of the tricks
of propaganda is guilt by associ
ation. For instance, it was pointed
out to us by our teacher that a
certain Southern California news
paper during the presidential
campaign would often print re
ports of Kennedy’s campaign ac
tivities next to articles on com
munist activities, in hopes that
readers would subconsciously
connect Kennedy with commu
nism.
I FEEL that an even more ob
vious employment of this trick
has been used against Dr. Fred
Schwarz and his Christian Anti-
Communism Crusade. Somewhere
someone started the story that
Schwarz is a lunatic rightist be
cause he is against communism,
and everyone seems to have join
ed the band wagon. Why is it that
anyone who speaks out against
the danger of communism is im
mediately branded a “rabid right
ist?” Can’t one merely bo a patri
otic American (or in this case Au
stralian), liberal or conservative,
Republican or Democrat, and still
be against a system which, as
Herter said on Tuesday, has
promised time and time again to
conquer the world?
I realize I am not qualified to
render a judgment on Schwarz’s
school, for unlike John Howard,
the author of Tuesday’s attack on
Schwarz. I have not done research
about his school by reading books
and second-hand accounts about
the speakers; I have merely been
to the school and seen it at work.
FIRST, Herbert Philbrick, au
thor of "I Led Three Lives” de
scribed the communist espionage
and subversion the F. 8.1. is com
batting. Then Schwarz spoke. He
made no emotional harangues or
wild and irrational Robert Welch
ian charges of conspiracy being
all around us; he merely laid the
facts before us, describing com
munism, its ideals and goals. He
then concluded by advising us to
hold onto our religion and demo
cratic system, for he felt they are
the greatest weapon against com
munism.
Therefore, only on the basis of
what I myself have seen, I feel
that Howard’s attack is unfair,
for he is giving a distorted picture
of the school. He attacks the
school mainly by using a tech

nique of false logic, Poisoning the
Well—discrediting and ridiculing
the speakers at the school by call
ing them names instead of evalu
ating what they say at the school.
