# Castro Scores JFK For Import Embargo
## 
### 
HAVANA (UPI) Premier Fidel Castro told a wildly cheering
mass meeting of a million Cubans last night President Kennedy was
guilty of a “felony when he ordered a total embargo of the Ameri
can imports of Cuban products. Castro called the meeting—largest
since he came to power—to give a Havana declaration in answer

♦to the decision taken by hemi-

spheric foreign ministers at Pun
ta del Este to expel Cuba from
the Organization of American
States (OAS).
He began his outdoor speech
by saying that the embargo which
amounted to the loss of a “few
million dollars, perhaps twenty
million,” left Cuba without dollars
to purchase foodstuffs and medi
cines in the United States.
"THE FELONY would nol have
been so complete if Kennedy had
at least extended us credits to
buy medicines,” he said. He de
clared that such an act com
pounded the United States’ “at
tack on the Cuban people.”
Castro, accompanied by Presi
dent Osvaldo Dorticos and Mrs.
Dorticos, arrived 30 minutes late
and was cheered by the crowd,
many of whom sang the Commu
nist Internationale or raised their
arm in the clenched-fist salute of
communism.
The crowds had begun stream
ing into the Civic Plaza at noon,
hours in advance of Castro’s
scheduled speech, expected to pro
duce a second “declaration of
Havana." Among them were 50,-
000 students. Women parading
through the park wore multi-col
ored blouses, light pants and big
straw hats like those sold to the
American tourists years ago.
MANY Russian flags could bo
seen among the marchers. One
carried a cardboard white dove of
peace with a red star in its beak
and a hammer and sickle painted
on its side. One of the banners
carried by the marchers said,
"we are Marxists-Leninists de
spite the fact that it bothers the
OAS.”
