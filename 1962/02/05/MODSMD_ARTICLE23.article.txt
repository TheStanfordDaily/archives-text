HELSINKI, Finland (UPI)
Finland voted yesterday in the
first day of a two-day parliamen
tary election that was expected to !
produce a majority committed to |
tho neutralist course demanded !
by the Soviet Union.
Mild weather was reported in
most sections of the country but
scattered storms made it impos
sible to predict what percentage
of voters would turn out.
President Urho Kekkonen was ,
one of the firs) to east his vote
soon after the polls opened at j
Luumaeki in Southern Finland.
The conservative newspaper j
Uusi Suomi yesterday urged in j
frontpage headlines that ‘‘a high
voting turnout will secure the j
best result a bourgeois majority |
is within reach.” It said the Com
munists gained seven seats in the
last election because of the small |
turnout.
There wore 2,767,070 eligible j
voters and 1,291 candidates for the
200-seat parliament.
The main components of the j
hoped for “neutralist” majority—
a makeshift majority of nearly j
five years’ standing probably ;
would be the Agrarian party, the
mainstay of the present minority
government, and the Social Dem
ocrats.
