# Security Check Moves to Foil OAS Plot on De Gaulle's Talk
## 
### 
PARIS (UP!) Special units of Paris’ 30,000-man security force
checked the identity of 26,000 persons yesterday in a search for
Secret Army Organization members who might try to disrupt Presi
dent Charles de Gaulle’s speech to the nation tonight. The capital,
ringed by 30,000 armed men and 100 tanks and armored cars, was

outwardly calm yesterday, but
there still were fears that the OAS
might try to pull off some sort
of coup to offset the speech de
Gaulle was to make tonight.
THERE were reports earlier in
the week the OAS might spark a
major revolt here or in Algeria in
fear De Gaulle would announce
the grant of independence to Al
geria. But informed sources said
no major announcement on Al
geria was expected.
The Algerian rebel government
called a meeting yesterday after
noon in Tunis, but all indications
were that any cease-fire agree
ment or even announcement of a
peaceful solution to the seven-year
old war would not come for a
week or two.
Interior ministry sources said
the security force, whose strength
has been increased the past week,
operated roadblocks in and near
Paris, checking 11,768 cars.
SIX PERSONS were reported
arrested on suspicion of OAS ac
tivities. Authorities identified two
of them as Army Col. Bertrand
de Seze, former adjutant to the
French expeditionary force in the
Korean War, and Maitre J. Pirch,
a prominent lawyer.
