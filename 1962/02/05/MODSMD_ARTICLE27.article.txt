# Farm Psychologists Study 'High-Domed Introvert'
## 
### 
The classic stereotype of the
student who excels in math- the
high-domed introvert doesn’t
seem to be holding up, at least at
the fifth-grade level, two Stanford
University psychologists have
found.

The investigators, Dr. Eleanor
E. Maccoby and Dr. Lucy Rau,
found that boys and girls who do
better at numerical tasks than at
spatial or verbal ones “contrary
to what we had originally expect
ed .. . appear to be social in
many ways.

“They like to be with others,
both their age-mates and adults,
and turn to adults for help quite
readily . . . One of their out
standing characteristics is the
ability to shut out distractions
. . . ” their report shows.

The tests included one on the
ability to wait: the offering of a
small piece of candy now or a
larger chunk two days later. Still
others gathered their classmates’
descriptions of the test group and
analyzed the test groups’ attitude
toward other people.
“Among children who do better
at numerical tasks than they do
at spatial or verbal ones, the boys
are fairly aggressive. For exam
ple, boys in this group wore
checked more often than others
as being ‘real good fighters’ by
their classmates.

“High-number girls, on the
other hand, are seen as competent
but not aggressive by their class
mates, and they score low on our
questionnaires about aggressive
feelings.
"One rather puzzling finding is
that our high-number girls could
not wait for a larger piece of
candy later. They more often
chose to eat the small piece im
mediately.”
THEIR PRELIMINARY find
ings have been filed with parents,
teachers and principals of 126
fifth-grade youngsters in Red
wood City and San Carlos schools
who were included in the study.
The children were selected be
cause they were better at one
kind of task than another. Some
12000 were screened in order to

gather a group which showed a
fairly wide range of scores on in
telligence tests. None were gifted
in all tasks and none were re
tarded.

Another general result of the
year-long study, which began in
the fall of 1960 under a U.S. Of
fice of Education grant, was that
“highly verbal children are rela
tively independent in their inter
personal relations.”
“FACED with some difficulty,”
the report said, “they tend not to
ask for help as readily as the
other children we studied . . . ”
Mrs. Macoby and Miss Rau of
fer a word of caution. They point
out that theirs is the first study
of its kind, and that it might be
necassary to study a new group
of fifth-graders perhaps in a dif
ferent region to chack the study’s
validity.

One benefit from their study,
they report, might be that chil
dren who are having difficulty
with arithmetic but are doing well
in other school subjects need
training in concentration in addi
tion to specific mathematical op
erations.
SOME of the tests given W’ero
exercises in concentration: solv
ing verbal or mathematical prob
lems while earphones offered dis
tracting material. Others involved
muscular co-ordination: minor
drawing and blindfolded orienta
tion.
Some of the test results:
“Among girls, high verbal skills
were accompanied by what we
have labeled aggression anxiety
—that is, these girls were made
uncomfortable by aggressive ten
dencies in themselves or other
people.
