# Unbeaten SU Ruggers Scared, Edge Peninsula Ramblers 10-3
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford’s varsity rugby team
was given a scare by an under
rated Peninsula Ramblers squad
but managed to pull itself to
gether for a 10-3 win over the
visiting Peninsulans on the Card
rugby field Saturday.
In a junior varsity preliminary
contest, the Tribe JV’s walt/.ed to
an easy 14-0 victory over (he
Rambler JV’s. The win was the
third in a row for the Stanford
team after losing its season open
er,
THE VARSITY’S WIN brought
their season’s record to three wins
against no defeats in regular com
petition plus two wins in the pre
season Stanford Rugby Carnival.
The Peninsula team scored
first, drawing blood early on a
penalty kick by Allie Lopez. Lo
pez’s successful boot put the
Ramblers out in front by a 3-0
score.
Stanford drew vengeance later
in the first half when the Card
scrum pushed the Ramblers back
over their goal line, and Troy
Barbee pounced on the ball from
his prop position for a try.
Stan Lindskog added the con
version to give the Indian ruggers
a goal and a 5-3 lead which lasted
until the intermission whistle.
CLARK WEAVER sewed up
the contest for (he home team
with a try midway through the
second half when he took the
pigskin covered spheroid from a
scrum and dashed over the goal
line on the short side,
Lindskog’s successful conver
sion closed out the day’s scoring
and assured the Indians their fi
nal 10-3 winning margin.
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
was a little unhappy with the
play of his team. Earlier in the
{ season during the Rugby Carni

val, the Tribe had rolled up a
16-0 bulge over the Ramblers
while playing only one half.
NATURALLY all the Indians
expected an easy win this time,
too. However, with the addition
of some new players and a sur
prisingly tough scrum combined

wdth the fact that Stanford “sorta
let up a little,” the Ramblers
gave the Cards one of their tough
est matches of the season.
Kmetovic called attention to the
fact that Stanford had “lots of
opportunities to score” but could
never quite get the ball downed
over the goal line.
All was not completely black,
however, as the Card coach
praised the efforts of Dick Shaw,
who made some good runs in the
second half, and of Dick Leeuwen

burg in the scrum. Tom McManus
also drew plaudits for his general
all around good play.
OUTSTANDING IN the JV’s
win were scrum half fid Haley
and Beau Bianchi, both of whom
were instrumental in setting up
the Stanford victory.
Next week Stanford goes up
against the touring UCLA Bruins
on the Card field while the JV's
meet San Jose City College in a
return engagement,

Stanford’s varsity rugby team
was given a scare by an under
rated Peninsula Ramblers squad
but managed to pull itself to
gether for a 10-3 win over the
visiting Peninsulans on the Card
rugby field Saturday.
In a junior varsity preliminary
contest, the Tribe JV’s walt/.ed to
an easy 14-0 victory over (he
Rambler JV’s. The win was the
third in a row for the Stanford
team after losing its season open
er,
THE VARSITY’S WIN brought
their season’s record to three wins
against no defeats in regular com
petition plus two wins in the pre
season Stanford Rugby Carnival.
The Peninsula team scored
first, drawing blood early on a
penalty kick by Allie Lopez. Lo
pez’s successful boot put the
Ramblers out in front by a 3-0
score.
Stanford drew vengeance later
in the first half when the Card
scrum pushed the Ramblers back
over their goal line, and Troy
Barbee pounced on the ball from
his prop position for a try.
Stan Lindskog added the con
version to give the Indian ruggers
a goal and a 5-3 lead which lasted
until the intermission whistle.
CLARK WEAVER sewed up
the contest for (he home team
with a try midway through the
second half when he took the
pigskin covered spheroid from a
scrum and dashed over the goal
line on the short side,
Lindskog’s successful conver
sion closed out the day’s scoring
and assured the Indians their fi
nal 10-3 winning margin.
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
was a little unhappy with the
play of his team. Earlier in the
{ season during the Rugby Carni

val, the Tribe had rolled up a
16-0 bulge over the Ramblers
while playing only one half.
NATURALLY all the Indians
expected an easy win this time,
too. However, with the addition
of some new players and a sur
prisingly tough scrum combined

wdth the fact that Stanford “sorta
let up a little,” the Ramblers
gave the Cards one of their tough
est matches of the season.
Kmetovic called attention to the
fact that Stanford had “lots of
opportunities to score” but could
never quite get the ball downed
over the goal line.
All was not completely black,
however, as the Card coach
praised the efforts of Dick Shaw,
who made some good runs in the
second half, and of Dick Leeuwen

burg in the scrum. Tom McManus
also drew plaudits for his general
all around good play.
