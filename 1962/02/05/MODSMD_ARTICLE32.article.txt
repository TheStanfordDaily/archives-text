# Grapplers Win
## 
### 
The Stanford wrestlers knocked
off San Francisco State last
Thursday night 26-13 in Encina
Gym.
The Indians started out badly
with a forfeit to the Gators in the
123-pound division, and a Stale
win in the 130-division didn’t help
either. Troy Denyer pinned the
Indians’ John Smith.
However Dave Herasmichuk
got Stanford onto winning ways
with a 12-3 decision in the 137-
pound weight class. Stanford’s
Lee Stephensen was a winner by
default in the 147-pound match.
Phil Kendall held his opponent
pointless to win by decision in the
157-pound division. John Kay,
wrestling 167. did likewise.
Frank Redle won the 177 with
a first round pin, and in one of
the evening’s best matches, Don
Buehler lost a close 4-2 decision in
the 191-pound class.
In the heavyweight division,
Stanford’s Duncan Ross won by
forfeit.
