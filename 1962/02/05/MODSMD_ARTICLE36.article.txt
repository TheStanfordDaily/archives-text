# Ford Foundation Gives Farm $100,000 for Student Loans
## 
### 
Five California universities have received grants totalling
$400,000 from the Ford Foundation for a two-year forgivable loans
program to graduate students in engineering who plan to become
college teachers. Stanford, the University of California at Berkeley,
and the California Institute of Technology received $100,000 each,

♦•while the University of Califox-nia
at Los Angeles and the University
of Southern California received
$50,000 each. The size of the
grants was based on the size of
the current doctoral pi'ograms in
engineering of each institution.
In all, the Foundation an
nounced grants totalling about
$2.8 million to 42 schools and
departments of engineering na
tionally.
The loans are designed to bring
into teaching graduates who,
usually because of family respon
sibilities, require moie support in
advanced training than conven
tional fellowships or their per
sonal resources can provide. The
forgivability feature is intended
to reinforce the graduates’ own
motiavation toward a teaching
career.
Qualified students who commit
themselves to teaching careers
will bo eligible for loans of up to
a total of $10,000 each over a three
year period. After students com
plete their doctorates, the loans
will he forgiven at a fixed rate
$1,000 or 20 per cent of the total
owed at the termination of gi'ad
uate study, whichever is greater
for every year of sex vice on an'
American or Canadian engineer
ing faculty.
