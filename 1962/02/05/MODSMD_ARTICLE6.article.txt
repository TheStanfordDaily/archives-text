# Enthusiastic Japanese Welcome Bob Kennedy
## 
### 
TOKYO (UPli—Attorney Gen
eral Robert F. Kenedy arrived
yesterday to a tumultuous greet
ing in which a policeman was
bashed on the head with a “Wel
come Mr. Kennedy” sign by an
enthusiastic Japanese who want
ed to shake hands with the broth
er of the President of the United
States.
Kennedy flew in from, Honolulu
on the first leg of a goodwill
around-the world tour for a one
week stay in Japan. The first two
days he will bo the official guest
c he Japanese government. For
e remainder of his visit ho will
the guest of a group of Jap
anese private citizens in what
American officials here called a
“historical” experiment in people
to-people diplomacy.
A relatively small crowd turned
out at the Tokyo International
Airport to welcome Kennedy, his
wife and other members of his
party. But what it lacked in size,
the crowd more than made up in
enthusiasm.
FOLLOWING the brief official
welcoming ceremonies, in which
Kennedy and his wife delighted
the audience with speeches in
badly-mangled Japanese, a crowd
of students pressed around Ken

nedy to shake his hand.
Kennedy was obviously annoy
ed with the police who pushed
and shoved the students away.
“They’re okay,” he said, “Why
don’t you leave them alone?”
As he started down a flight of
steps from the airport lobby to a
waiting automobile, a band of ul
tra nationalists frotn the Great
Japan Patriotic Society shouted
“Banzai” three times. Most of the
rightists were wearing U.S.-mili
tary type uniforms and carried
banners proclaiming in English
and Japanese “Welcome Mr. Ken
nedy.” Some of the banners had
Kennedy misspelled.
KENNEDY tried to push
through the police surrounding
him to shake hands with the na
tionalists who kept shouting
greetings intermingled with anti
communists slogans. But the po
lice held firm and Kennedy was
able to shake hands with only a
couple of them before he was
swept out the door by his escort.
ONE STARTED a shoving
match with a policeman and fi
nally bashed the officer on the
head with his “Welcome Mr. Ken
nedy” sign. The blow could bo
heard above the noise of the
crowd and Kennedy turned to see
what had happened.
Kennedy appeared to have made
an instant hit by reading a brief
statement in Japanese. In halting
and bad Japanese ho said:
“I am very happy to visit Japan
I and to bring greetings from my
I brother, who is the President. I
| thank you very much for all the
preparations you have made.”

A relatively small crowd turned
out at the Tokyo International
Airport to welcome Kennedy, his
wife and other members of his
party. But what it lacked in size,
the crowd more than made up in
enthusiasm.
FOLLOWING the brief official
welcoming ceremonies, in which
Kennedy and his wife delighted
the audience with speeches in
badly-mangled Japanese, a crowd
of students pressed around Ken

nedy to shake his hand.
Kennedy was obviously annoy
ed with the police who pushed
and shoved the students away.
“They’re okay,” he said, “Why
don’t you leave them alone?”
As he started down a flight of
steps from the airport lobby to a
waiting automobile, a band of ul
tra nationalists frotn the Great
Japan Patriotic Society shouted
“Banzai” three times. Most of the
rightists were wearing U.S.-mili
tary type uniforms and carried
banners proclaiming in English
and Japanese “Welcome Mr. Ken
nedy.” Some of the banners had
Kennedy misspelled.
KENNEDY tried to push
through the police surrounding
him to shake hands with the na
tionalists who kept shouting
greetings intermingled with anti
communists slogans. But the po
lice held firm and Kennedy was
able to shake hands with only a
couple of them before he was
swept out the door by his escort.
ONE STARTED a shoving
match with a policeman and fi
nally bashed the officer on the
head with his “Welcome Mr. Ken
nedy” sign. The blow could bo
heard above the noise of the
crowd and Kennedy turned to see
what had happened.
Kennedy appeared to have made
an instant hit by reading a brief
statement in Japanese. In halting
and bad Japanese ho said:
“I am very happy to visit Japan
I and to bring greetings from my
I brother, who is the President. I
| thank you very much for all the
preparations you have made.”
