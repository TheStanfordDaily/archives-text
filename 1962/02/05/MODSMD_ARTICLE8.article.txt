NAPLES, Italy ( UPI i-Lucky
Luciano goes back to the United
States this week the only way he
could make it in a pine box.
The onetime New York vice
king died Jan. 26 of heart failure.
He had been living in Naples
most of the time since he was de
ported from the United States as
an “undesirable alien’’ in 1946.
Alive, the 65-year-old Luciano
could not get back into the coun
try where he had lived since he
emigrated with his parents from
Sicily when he was nine years old.
But dead, U.S. authorities had
no objections.
