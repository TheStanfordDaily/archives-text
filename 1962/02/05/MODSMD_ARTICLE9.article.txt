# Fire Bodes World's End
## 
### 
The spectacular blaze of an I
empty building attached to the
University rifle I’ango lit up the
sky Saturday night and attracted
crowds of students looking for
the end of the world predicted by
Asian astrologers.
The blaze, caused by an electri
cal fuse box failure, was put out
before it got to the rifle range,
but damage to electrical lines
knocked out phone service to
Project M and cut out lights in
nearby ROTC classrooms.
THU BUILDINGS, off Campus j
Drive near Arguello St., were for
merly stables for cavalry con
structed about 1917 (World War
I vintage). Assistant Fire Chief
Frank Jurian guessed the box
failure came with an overload on
the old wiring.
High flames raced through the
roof as the fire caught onto the
old shingles and tarpaper. The
flames, reflected by the fog, cre
ated a big glare which lit up a
large part of the sky.
In the Stern-Wilbur-Branner
complex, hundreds streamed out
i to see where the fire was, joking,
i “Hey, the world is coming to an
end!” “It’s this way,” called some,
trying to track down the blaze,
which seemed in the general di
rection of the stadium. “Non
sense,” others said, “The world is
ending over here!”
A LARGE crowd watched the
building blaze spectacularly and
then send up great clouds of
smoke as firemen poured water
on it.
Financial loss was slight except
to telephone lines since the old
building was unoccupied and will
probably be torn down and new
power lines strung to the adjoin
ing rifle range, Jurian said. PG&E
men were at work replacing pow
er service yesterday, he said. It
was good practice to keep the
firemen in shape, Jurian, com
mented brightly.
