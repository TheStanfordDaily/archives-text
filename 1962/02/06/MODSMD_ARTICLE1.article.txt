# De Gaulle Eyes Use Of Dictator’s Power To Combat OAS
## 
### 
PARIS (UPl)—President Charles cle Gaulle threatened last
night to resume dictatorial powers to crush the outlawed Secret
Army Organization (OAS) so he can restore peace “very soon” to
an independent Algeria.
The OAS, denounced by De Gaulle as a “subversive and crim-

inal enterprise,” forced the state
run radio-television station in
Oran off the air by a dramatic
kidnaping Monday night and pre
vented broadcast of the speech.
The OAS substituted an eight
minute pirate broadcast instead.

lIE GAULLE’S tensely awaited
radio-television address to the
French nation did not announce a
cease-fire agreement with the
Moslem rebels but he expressed
“the positive hope” an agreement
will be reached very soon making
Algeria an independent nation
with close ties with France.

The OAS has threatened civil
war if necessary to keep Algeria
French. Paris was ringed with
armed cars and tanks against a
possible OAS coup, and more
than 40,000 security force and
troops were martialed in Oran
and Algiers to try to prevent a
new bloodbath.
The OAS has launched a cam
paign of terror in Algeria to keep
the territory part of France and
have carried out isolated acts of
terror in Paris itself. The cam
paign that began Jan. 1 has taken
more than 650 lives in Algeria
and wounded more than 1,000 per
sons.

YESTERDAY the OAS attacked
a suburban commuter train out
side of Algiers with machinegun
fire from a speeding automobile.
Later they kidnaped director Jean
Rouselly of the Oran television
network and two technicians to
force the broadcast off the air.
Workers were threatened with
death if they broadcast the
speech.

Dc Gaulle said the moment is
near when France will make pub
lic the terms she has offered the
Moslem rebel leaders. The rebel
leaders themselves met in Tunis
Monday to discuss the peace
terms and to listen to De Gaulle’s
speech by radio.
Without mentioning the OAS by
name, De Gaulle castigated its

“subversive and criminal enter
prises” and added, “but once
more they are doing this in vain.”

“THE NATION despises and
condemns unanimously these peo
ple, their plotting and their out
rages.” De Gaulle said. “Their
fate can only be decided and will
only bo decided by the forces of
order, the police and justice. The
government is there to reply to
them. I myself once took, when
necessary, and would take again,
if need be. the necessary excep
tional powers.”

This was a reference to the ex
traordinary powers De Gaulle as
sumed during the Algiers “gen
erals’ revolt” last April. Ho relin
quished all but a few of these
special powers last fall.
