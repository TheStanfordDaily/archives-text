# IIR's 'Bridge' Will Publish Student Work
## 
### 
The Bridge, annual publication
of the HR. announced a new pub
lication policy under which it
will accept any term paper re
lated in some way to this year’s
theme, according to Editor Bill
Kitchen.

This plan is designed to over
come the lack of publicity given
to undergraduate creative
thought, he said.
“THIS YEAR The Bridge will
be investigating the three areas
in the world where democracies
are likely to develop; Southeast
Asia, Africa and South America,”
Kitchen stated. “It is hoped that
the possibility of publication will
encourage student thought and
research, and increase the literary
value of student papers. In addi
tion it is hoped that this policy
will spread to the other publica
tions and thus open new channels
for student creativity,” he added.
An attempt will be made to
print any relevant paper, and the
magazine will be expanded to in
clude all valuable contributions.
A carbon copy of the finished pa
per should be in the HR shack by
Feb. 28, or other arrangements
should be made by calling Kitchen
at 941-0241.
THEMES SHOULD be concern
ed, Kitchen said, with four basic
questions:

• Is it reasonable to assume
that, in the short run, democracy
will lead to provincialism in a
country’s diplomacy?
• What is Ihe present nature
of public opinion in the elitist
dominated countries of these
areas?

• If democracy develops in
these areas, to what extent can
public opinion be educated?
• Assuming that provincialism
will naturally follow democracy,
how might this situation change
over a relatively long period of
lime?

“These questions are purposely
broad;” Kitchen added, “however,
their breadth increases the possi
bility that students will find some
touchpoint between the questions
and the subjects of term papers.”
