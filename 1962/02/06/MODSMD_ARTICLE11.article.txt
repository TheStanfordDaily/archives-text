# Indonesian Students Stone U.S. Embassy

JAKARTA. Indonesia (UPI) —
A mob of toon-aged Indonesians
yesterday smashed windows in
the U.S. Embassy, injuring an
American woman employe, in
protest against landing permits at
American airfields granted by the

U.S. government to Dutch troop
carrying planes.

The mob of about 100 included
a number of students believed to
be members of a Communist
dominated student organization.
The howling youths smashed win
dows with stones and bamboo
spears, ripped down the embassy
plaque and hung a huge sign on
the fence reading:
“AMERICA must be rubbed
out.”
The attack brought an official
protest from U.S. Ambassador
Howard P. Jones to the Indonesi
an foreign ministry. There was
no immediate response although
the war administration said “sev
eral persons” were held for inves
tigation.
The mob was reacting to dis
closure last Friday that the U.S.
State Department had granted
permission for a chartered KLM
Royal Dutch Airline plane carry
ing 110 Dutch soldiers to West
New Guinea which Indonesia
claims belongs to it—to use com
mercial facilities on U.S. soil in
the Pacific as stopover points.
STATE Department: press offi
cer Lincoln White said in Wash
ington yesterday that the permis
sion had been withdrawn “for the
time being” but that the ban
would be reconsidered if peace
talks between the Dutch and Indo
nesians break down and a “mili
tary emergency arises.”
He explained that the decision
was made because officials in
Washington were “apprehensive”
that the troop movements would
be misconstrued as reinforce
ments rather than replacements
for the Dutch garrison in New
Guinea. The Dutch maintain the
soldiers were not part of a mili
tary buildup but were replace
ments.
LAST WEEK the Japanese gov
ernment refused to permit a char
tered airliner carrying Dutch sol
diers to land in Japan. A KLM
DCS jet carrying the Dutch troops
passed through Anchorage, Alas
ka and Honolulu on Saturday.
A Dutch foreign ministry
spokesman at The Hague said
Premier Jan E. de Quay “expres
sed his profound disappointment
and bafflement” at the American
decision to ban further flights.
The spokesman said the American
can decision “is the subject of
further study” but did not elab
orate.
Indonesia has been whipped
into near-war fever during the
past months by President Sukar
no’s campaign to “liberate” West
Irian, as the Indonesians call
Dutch New Guinea.
