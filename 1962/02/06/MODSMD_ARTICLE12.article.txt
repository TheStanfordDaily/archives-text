# Panel Presents Upperclass Living
## 
### 
A panel of speakers represent
ing each of the various living
systems on campus addressed an
audience of freshman men last
night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Presented by Stanford Today
and Tomorrow, the panel at tempt
ed to give an over-all picture of
the living facilities available to
upper-classmen. The result gave
freshmen a humorous introduc
tion to the terrors of rush.
DEAN of Men Gordon Craig
opened the discussion with a few
semi-serious words on the forth
coming rush period and cautioned
freshmen against being overly
concerned. A choice regarding
future residence at the university
must be made by every fresh
man, but, hopefully, the rigors of

this choice will not scar him for
life, he said.
Lee Stevenson then gave a de
scription of the fraternity system.
Fraternity rush, he said, involves
the mutual selection of livittg
companions by the rushee and the
existing members of the fraterni
ty. Secondly members of a fra
ternity themselves are wholly re
sponsible for setting the stand
ards and the rules of the house.
Thirdly in contrast to many fra
ternities in other schools, there
are very few compulsory activi
ties. Individual freedom is of
prime importance, he said.
STEVENSON stressed that fra
ternities, originally organized on
a social basis, have spread their
efforts over academic, cultural,
and extra-curricular life.
Pledges arc required to cal din
ner once a week at the house, and
are expected to be available for a

few hours on Saturday for house
projects. Members must live in
the house at least one quarter of
their sophomore year, he said.
Tin; BASK cost for fraternity
living averages a little over $lOO
a month. An initiation fee of $7O
is paid only once, he said.
Bill Hansen, representing Stern
Hall, emphasized the looser or
ganization of independent living.
The student is free to participate
as he pleases and is only required
to abide by house rules.
Bads costs are the same as for
Wilbur residence, l imning slight
ly over $lOO a month.
The Eating Clubs were repre
sented by Joel Meistcr, who also
stressed the freedom of members
to participate as they please.
Members may live cither in Toyon
Hall or off campus. Basic costs
are about the same as in the other
university residences, he said.
