# A 						Double Feature In Mem Aud Today
## 
### 
If “Operation Abolition” had been made in Hollywood it would
have been called a “message” film. That’s the designation for a
movie that tries to prove something,
“Abolition” tries to prove that the demonstrations at the San
Francisco hearings of the House Un-American Activities Commit
tee in 1960 were led by Communists. Since the makers of the film
(HUAC, who else?) were trying to prove something that was
patently untrue, the evidence they presented in trying to prove
their point was also untrue. In fact, “Abolition” is a masterpiece of
untruth.
Every conceivable method of distortion was used. Films are
shown out of sequence (the Committee has recently said that this
was the only way they could show what really happened) and
the narration is filled with half-truth, innuendo and, in a few cases,
outright lies.
Today at 4:15 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium, “Operation Abo
lition” will be shown along with another film, “Operation Cor
rection.” Produced by the American Civil Liberties Union, “Cor
rection” is nothing but a print of “Abolition” with a new sound
track, whose purpose is to correct what was said in the original
narration.
We have seen “Abolition” a couple of times and, though, we
haven’t seen “Correction,” it seems that the ACLU has tackled a
job too large for one film. The last time we saw a reporter begin
to show what was wrong with “Abolition,” it took him 20 minutes
to get through the first few minutes of what is shown on the screen.
We highly recommend that these films be seen today. An evalu
ation of how well the ACLU has succeeded at its super-human
task will appear on this page tomorrow.
