(EDITOR’S NOTE: The Daily
today begins a regular weekly
column intended to provide cap
sule critical information on the
performing and communicative
media. It makes no pretense of
being complete but is merely a
listing of items that have come to
our attention as being of possible
interest to the Stanford communi
ty.)
STAGE
Friedman and Son, by Mark Har
ris—Actor's Workshop (Satur
days).
Lukewarm reviews haven’t kept
the crowds away from this play
which is the project of a San
Francisco State English profes
sor who is one of the most worth
while writers presently at work
in this country. Harris’ gentle an
swer to his critics which appeared
in the Chronicle Datebook Sunday
probably won’t hurt the box of
fice either’.
Winter One-Acts— Little Theatre
(Friday and Saturday).
Ram’s Head’s annual effort at
student-written plays opens this
weekend. They’re usually more
than worthwhile.
THE SCREEN
One, Two, Three The Varsity
(Palo Alto).
The “Some Like It Hot” team
of Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Dia
mond have hit the jackpot again
with a very funny movie about a
very unfunny part of the world,
Berlin.
The King and I and Carousel—
The Guild (Menlo Park).
Two great Rogers and Ham
merstein musicals which were
transferred to the screen with
more than the usual amount of
skill provide a bill of fare for re
vival fans.
TELEVISION
Bob Newhart Wed., 10 p.m.
(NBC).
The freshest (and often the
funniest) comedy on the tube
these days is offered by a fellow
who is amused by the possibilities
of a Russian workman who dug
on Stalin and couldn’t get rid of
him (“My kids are getting attach
ed to him”) and Mao Tse-Tung
hiring an ad man to get China in
to the UN (“What do you mean
you’re going to fire us and hire
the outfit that sold Nehru as a

The Varsity

peace lover? They just went out
of business”).
Leonard Bernstein Tue., 7:30
p.m. (CBS).
A concert given last spring in
Tokyo with Bernstein conducting
the Now York Philharmonic will
he this week’s rare breath of good
music.
Carl Sandburg Thur., 10 p.m.
(CBS).
America’s great poet and Lin
coln historian presents a story
and song program of Lincoln’s
Prairie Years. Could be a good
one.
THE PRESS
Saturday Evening Post—Feb. 10.
This issue has two articles
worthy of your attention. The
“Speaking Out!” section features
on article by the former manag
ing editor of “The Nation.” It’s
called “Right Not to Believe” and
it’s the kind of thing the “old”
Post wouldn’t have touched with
a ten-foot pole.
The other article is by Edward
Teller entitled “The Fallout
Scare,” It’s the second in a series
entitled “Plan for Survival” and
is a must for all of those who feel
secure when an atomic scientist
says, “things really aren’t as bad
as all that!”
BOOKS
The Press, by A. J. Leibling
Ballantine (paperback) 75 cents.
One of the most perceptive
critics of American journalism is
in top form in this caustic, hilari
ous and often brilliant set of es
says on what goes into newspa
pers and how it gets there.
MISCELLANEOUS
Mort Sahl —Nightly at the hun
gry i.
Some reports have it that The
Next President is slipping (Say
it isn’t so, Mort) and has become
positively gentle in his dollar
laden maturity. But there are
others who contend he’s as good
as he ever was, maybe better. If
you find out, let us know.
Brownie McGee and Sonny Terry
Pauley Ballroom, Berkeley.
One of this pair is blind and
the other is lame, but together
they are among the best folk
singers in the business. They gen
erate real excitement and intensi
ty and aficionados shouldn’t miss.
