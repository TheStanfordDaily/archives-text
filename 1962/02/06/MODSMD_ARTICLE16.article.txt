Editor, Tin* Daily:
Being as we are quite familiar 1
with The Daily’s unique concep
tion of “objective” and “factual”
reporting, we were still more than
a bit surprised to see the new low
to which it had fallen in publish
ing the untrue and frankly ma
licious article written by Peter
Biersterlt.
Actually, this is not our first
encounter with portions of the
Bierstedt piece. Some weeks ago,
when it was still in letter form,
we discussed it at great length
with then editor Jerry Rankin.
We denied the accusations then
and we deny them now. We offer
ed to confront and examine Mr.
Bierstedt’s witnesses then, and
we renew the offer. Mr. Rankin,
realizing the malicious nature of
the letter and possessing, it would
appear, a far greater journalistic
Integrity and sense of responsi
bility than the present editors, re
fused to print it.
Now, the original letter has
been dusted off, revised at the
Daily’s request (omitting at least
one quotation which Mr. Bier
stedt apparently, and quite right
ly, realizes is incorrect) and sup
plemented with a few anonymous
quotes from a former SAYR of
ficer. If Mr. Bierstedt had wanted
to write a really vicious article,
he should have consulted some
of our other “liberal” friends
(list on request, in the event that
the Daily is contemplating a
series) who would have gladly
supplied some more anonymous
quotations.
While a little reluctant to digni
fy the article with a detailed re
ply, and feeling the pressure of
the Daily’s deadline for submis
sion of letters (Bierstedt, after
all, had two weeks to concoct his
“expose”) we would be glad, if
given equal space, to set the rec
ord straight.

of course, will be glad to give
Messrs. Noble, Hermann and
Weinig whatever space they need
to “set (he record straight.")
MISREPRESENTATION
Editor, The Daily:
I found the article on the Stan
ford Area Young Republicans’
“beer party” to be a serious mis
representation of the facts. It ap
peared that the author was so
anxious to expose the startling
news that he had been given that
he neglected to check on the va
lidity of a number of the points
that he made.
Granted, there was a party fol
lowing the recent county elec
tions; however, it should he point
ed out that only 38-22 of the 340
Stanford students present at the
election attended the party.
Therefore, I would question the
claim that the promise of free
beer was the great incentive
which brought Stanford students
to the election. I feel that the is
sue of increased dues for Stan
ford YR members was a much
greater incentive for the large at
tendance.
Perhaps it should be noted that
a former SAYR officer who so
generously supplied the names of
others, but not his own, was Bob
Seimer, former SAYR president

who lost control of the group in
December, following an all but
distinguished term. He actively
canvassed Stanford students at
the election in behalf of a candi
date whose platform advocated
severe penalties for members of
the Stanford club.
As to the comments about ques
tionable conduct on the part of
the Stanford group at past county
elections, Mr. Seimer is surely a
competent source of information,
for he was Executive Vice-Presi
dent of SAYR at last year’s elec
tion, opposing the same candidate
for whom he so actively cam
paigned (his year.
It seems unfortunate that a
person must use the press as a
vehicle for a personal revenge
campaign.

RESPONSIBILITY
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to submit the fol
lowing as an indirect response to
Mr. Rosenthal’s review of “Mein
Kampf” of Friday last. I cannot
say if it is apothetical to Mr.
Rosenthal’s ideas, although my
motivation is in part a fear that
such is the case. I fully agree that
the National Socialist chapter of
the History of Man should be the
object of contemplation, but I
disagree with Mr. Rosenthal, I
believe, and with the Zionist posi
tion as to the results to be gained
from such study.
The point is well taken that (he
individual cannot avoid his re
sponsibility for the structure and
attitudes of society. Undoubtedly
the Germans and perhaps others
culpably failed to see that the
Nazi State was promoting im
moral relationships among indi
viduals, human arid corporate.

However, one often concen
trates on the particular acts of
the Nazis to the extent that one
loses sight of their general refer
ence. I maintain that there is only
a meaningless quantitative differ
ence between the murder of six
million Jews (or, if one were to
count Polish Jews as Polish, six
million Poles) and the accidental

[killing of one Jewish or Arab
j peasant on some forgotten border
jin the Near East.
} These two events are quite
[equal in their reference to that
type of social structure which
condones and actively promotes
immoral, relatinships.
I confess my prejudice against
| the State of Israel, just as any
[ one, I trust, would confess his
1 against Hitler’s Germany. While
[the “common heart of humanity”
I fails to see the general nature of
[ immoral actions, I, on my part,
[fail to see a difference between
I the “Jewish Conspiracy” and
j Nurenburg, and the “Jewish
j Homeland” and the Gaza inva
[ sion. Both are active mythologies,
j which in itself does not make
I them bad, but both are bad in
(hat they suppose a social legali
ty which is immoral.
Recently Mr. Hart entertained
us with the idea of divorcing the
law and morality: it is only with
a narrow idea of morality and a
very naive concept of law that
such a distinction and division can
I be made.
1 trust that one does not neces
sarily suffer Mr. Toynbee’s fate
if one dares to speak of the Jews
as being prejudiced or the quoted
Mr. Dinur as being hypocritical
on the occasion of the Eichmann
burning.

Being as we are quite familiar 1
with The Daily’s unique concep
tion of “objective” and “factual”
reporting, we were still more than
a bit surprised to see the new low
to which it had fallen in publish
ing the untrue and frankly ma
licious article written by Peter
Biersterlt.
Actually, this is not our first
encounter with portions of the
Bierstedt piece. Some weeks ago,
when it was still in letter form,
we discussed it at great length
with then editor Jerry Rankin.
We denied the accusations then
and we deny them now. We offer
ed to confront and examine Mr.
Bierstedt’s witnesses then, and
we renew the offer. Mr. Rankin,
realizing the malicious nature of
the letter and possessing, it would
appear, a far greater journalistic
Integrity and sense of responsi
bility than the present editors, re
fused to print it.
Now, the original letter has
been dusted off, revised at the
Daily’s request (omitting at least
one quotation which Mr. Bier
stedt apparently, and quite right
ly, realizes is incorrect) and sup
plemented with a few anonymous
quotes from a former SAYR of
ficer. If Mr. Bierstedt had wanted
to write a really vicious article,
he should have consulted some
of our other “liberal” friends
(list on request, in the event that
the Daily is contemplating a
series) who would have gladly
supplied some more anonymous
quotations.
While a little reluctant to digni
fy the article with a detailed re
ply, and feeling the pressure of
the Daily’s deadline for submis
sion of letters (Bierstedt, after
all, had two weeks to concoct his
“expose”) we would be glad, if
given equal space, to set the rec
ord straight.

MISREPRESENTATION
Editor, The Daily:
I found the article on the Stan
ford Area Young Republicans’
“beer party” to be a serious mis
representation of the facts. It ap
peared that the author was so
anxious to expose the startling
news that he had been given that
he neglected to check on the va
lidity of a number of the points
that he made.
Granted, there was a party fol
lowing the recent county elec
tions; however, it should he point
ed out that only 38-22 of the 340
Stanford students present at the
election attended the party.
Therefore, I would question the
claim that the promise of free
beer was the great incentive
which brought Stanford students
to the election. I feel that the is
sue of increased dues for Stan
ford YR members was a much
greater incentive for the large at
tendance.
Perhaps it should be noted that
a former SAYR officer who so
generously supplied the names of
others, but not his own, was Bob
Seimer, former SAYR president

who lost control of the group in
December, following an all but
distinguished term. He actively
canvassed Stanford students at
the election in behalf of a candi
date whose platform advocated
severe penalties for members of
the Stanford club.
As to the comments about ques
tionable conduct on the part of
the Stanford group at past county
elections, Mr. Seimer is surely a
competent source of information,
for he was Executive Vice-Presi
dent of SAYR at last year’s elec
tion, opposing the same candidate
for whom he so actively cam
paigned (his year.
It seems unfortunate that a
person must use the press as a
vehicle for a personal revenge
campaign.

I should like to submit the fol

Mr. Rosenthal’s review of “Mein

say if it is apothetical to Mr.
Rosenthal’s ideas, although my
motivation is in part a fear that
such is the case. I fully agree that
the National Socialist chapter of

disagree with Mr. Rosenthal, I

The point is well taken that (he
individual cannot avoid his re

attitudes of society. Undoubtedly
the Germans and perhaps others
culpably failed to see that the
Nazi State was promoting im
moral relationships among indi

However, one often concen
trates on the particular acts of
the Nazis to the extent that one
loses sight of their general refer

Being as we are quite familiar 1
with The Daily’s unique concep
tion of “objective” and “factual”
reporting, we were still more than
a bit surprised to see the new low
to which it had fallen in publish
ing the untrue and frankly ma
licious article written by Peter
Biersterlt.
Actually, this is not our first
encounter with portions of the
Bierstedt piece. Some weeks ago,
when it was still in letter form,
we discussed it at great length
with then editor Jerry Rankin.
We denied the accusations then
and we deny them now. We offer
ed to confront and examine Mr.
Bierstedt’s witnesses then, and
we renew the offer. Mr. Rankin,
realizing the malicious nature of
the letter and possessing, it would
appear, a far greater journalistic
Integrity and sense of responsi
bility than the present editors, re
fused to print it.
Now, the original letter has
been dusted off, revised at the
Daily’s request (omitting at least
one quotation which Mr. Bier
stedt apparently, and quite right
ly, realizes is incorrect) and sup
plemented with a few anonymous
quotes from a former SAYR of
ficer. If Mr. Bierstedt had wanted
to write a really vicious article,
he should have consulted some
of our other “liberal” friends
(list on request, in the event that
the Daily is contemplating a
series) who would have gladly
supplied some more anonymous
quotations.
While a little reluctant to digni
fy the article with a detailed re
ply, and feeling the pressure of
the Daily’s deadline for submis
sion of letters (Bierstedt, after
all, had two weeks to concoct his
“expose”) we would be glad, if
given equal space, to set the rec
ord straight.

MISREPRESENTATION
Editor, The Daily:
I found the article on the Stan
ford Area Young Republicans’
“beer party” to be a serious mis
representation of the facts. It ap
peared that the author was so
anxious to expose the startling
news that he had been given that
he neglected to check on the va
lidity of a number of the points
that he made.
Granted, there was a party fol
lowing the recent county elec
tions; however, it should he point
ed out that only 38-22 of the 340
Stanford students present at the
election attended the party.
Therefore, I would question the
claim that the promise of free
beer was the great incentive
which brought Stanford students
to the election. I feel that the is
sue of increased dues for Stan
ford YR members was a much
greater incentive for the large at
tendance.
Perhaps it should be noted that
a former SAYR officer who so
generously supplied the names of
others, but not his own, was Bob
Seimer, former SAYR president

who lost control of the group in
December, following an all but
distinguished term. He actively
canvassed Stanford students at
the election in behalf of a candi
date whose platform advocated
severe penalties for members of
the Stanford club.
As to the comments about ques
tionable conduct on the part of
the Stanford group at past county
elections, Mr. Seimer is surely a
competent source of information,
for he was Executive Vice-Presi
dent of SAYR at last year’s elec
tion, opposing the same candidate
for whom he so actively cam
paigned (his year.
It seems unfortunate that a
person must use the press as a
vehicle for a personal revenge
campaign.

UEBUTTAL
Editor, Tin* Daily:
Being as we are quite familiar 1
with The Daily’s unique concep
tion of “objective” and “factual”
reporting, we were still more than
a bit surprised to see the new low
to which it had fallen in publish
ing the untrue and frankly ma
licious article written by Peter
Biersterlt.
Actually, this is not our first
encounter with portions of the
Bierstedt piece. Some weeks ago,
when it was still in letter form,
we discussed it at great length
with then editor Jerry Rankin.
We denied the accusations then
and we deny them now. We offer
ed to confront and examine Mr.
Bierstedt’s witnesses then, and
we renew the offer. Mr. Rankin,
realizing the malicious nature of
the letter and possessing, it would
appear, a far greater journalistic
Integrity and sense of responsi
bility than the present editors, re
fused to print it.
Now, the original letter has
been dusted off, revised at the
Daily’s request (omitting at least
one quotation which Mr. Bier
stedt apparently, and quite right
ly, realizes is incorrect) and sup
plemented with a few anonymous
quotes from a former SAYR of
ficer. If Mr. Bierstedt had wanted
to write a really vicious article,
he should have consulted some
of our other “liberal” friends
(list on request, in the event that
the Daily is contemplating a
series) who would have gladly
supplied some more anonymous
quotations.
While a little reluctant to digni
fy the article with a detailed re
ply, and feeling the pressure of
the Daily’s deadline for submis
sion of letters (Bierstedt, after
all, had two weeks to concoct his
“expose”) we would be glad, if
given equal space, to set the rec
ord straight.

MISREPRESENTATION
Editor, The Daily:
I found the article on the Stan
ford Area Young Republicans’
“beer party” to be a serious mis
representation of the facts. It ap
peared that the author was so
anxious to expose the startling
news that he had been given that
he neglected to check on the va
lidity of a number of the points
that he made.
Granted, there was a party fol
lowing the recent county elec
tions; however, it should he point
ed out that only 38-22 of the 340
Stanford students present at the
election attended the party.
Therefore, I would question the
claim that the promise of free
beer was the great incentive
which brought Stanford students
to the election. I feel that the is
sue of increased dues for Stan
ford YR members was a much
greater incentive for the large at
tendance.
Perhaps it should be noted that
a former SAYR officer who so
generously supplied the names of
others, but not his own, was Bob
Seimer, former SAYR president

who lost control of the group in
December, following an all but
distinguished term. He actively
canvassed Stanford students at
the election in behalf of a candi
date whose platform advocated
severe penalties for members of
the Stanford club.
As to the comments about ques
tionable conduct on the part of
the Stanford group at past county
elections, Mr. Seimer is surely a
competent source of information,
for he was Executive Vice-Presi
dent of SAYR at last year’s elec
tion, opposing the same candidate
for whom he so actively cam
paigned (his year.
It seems unfortunate that a
person must use the press as a
vehicle for a personal revenge
campaign.

RESPONSIBILITY
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to submit the fol
lowing as an indirect response to
Mr. Rosenthal’s review of “Mein
Kampf” of Friday last. I cannot
say if it is apothetical to Mr.
Rosenthal’s ideas, although my
motivation is in part a fear that
such is the case. I fully agree that
the National Socialist chapter of
the History of Man should be the
object of contemplation, but I
disagree with Mr. Rosenthal, I
believe, and with the Zionist posi
tion as to the results to be gained
from such study.
The point is well taken that (he
individual cannot avoid his re
sponsibility for the structure and
attitudes of society. Undoubtedly
the Germans and perhaps others
culpably failed to see that the
Nazi State was promoting im
moral relationships among indi
viduals, human arid corporate.

However, one often concen
trates on the particular acts of
the Nazis to the extent that one
loses sight of their general refer
ence. I maintain that there is only
a meaningless quantitative differ
ence between the murder of six
million Jews (or, if one were to
count Polish Jews as Polish, six
million Poles) and the accidental

[killing of one Jewish or Arab
j peasant on some forgotten border
jin the Near East.
} These two events are quite
[equal in their reference to that
type of social structure which
condones and actively promotes
immoral, relatinships.
I confess my prejudice against
| the State of Israel, just as any
[ one, I trust, would confess his
1 against Hitler’s Germany. While
[the “common heart of humanity”
I fails to see the general nature of
[ immoral actions, I, on my part,
[fail to see a difference between
I the “Jewish Conspiracy” and
j Nurenburg, and the “Jewish
j Homeland” and the Gaza inva
[ sion. Both are active mythologies,
