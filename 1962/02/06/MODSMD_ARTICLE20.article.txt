COLORADO SPRINGS. Colo.
tUPI) International Hockey
Federation President Robert La
bel said Monday plans for the
world hockey championships are
being completed with no consider
ation of possible changes because
of the East German team’s travel
problem.
Label was here for a two-day
meeting with the U.S. organizing
committee to complete plans for
the tournament to be played here
and in Denver March 8-18.
He said there has been “no
thought” of making any changes,
even in scheduling of games, be
cause the East German squad
has been refused permission to
attend the championships by the
Allied travel office in West Ber
lin.
The hockey tournament is
scheduled to be played here and
in Denver with about 90 games on
tap. Nineteen teams are entered
—counting East Germany.
Lebel said last week he would
protest the action of the Allied
travel office in refusing the East
Germans the documents they
need to apply for visas to enter
the United States, The refusal
was described as part of a policy
adopted after erection of the wall
between East and West Berlin by
the East German government.
