# INDIANS MUST WIN
## Title Hopes on Line for Cards 
### PETE KING 
Stanford basketball coach Howie
Dallmar has a maddeningly sim
ple task this weekend, namely to
coach the Indian cagers to (wo
wins over UCLA and USC.
Of course the Bruins and Tro
jans aren’t going to roll over and
play dead. Southern California is
ranked number seven in the na
tion and the pesky Bruins are cur
rently riding a hot streak that
carried them past the Trojans
last Friday.
Dallmar said at the Northern
California Basketball Writers
Luncheon Saturday that the up
coming weekend is crucial to
Card title chances. “If we're ever
going to make a strong bid for the
AAWU title, this had better be
it,” mentioned Howie. He also re
marked that he had watched the
Bruin-Trojan game and had been
particularly impressed by UCLA
guard Johnny Green, who hit on
his first eight shots from the
floor. In his opinion, both teams
were real good, and prospects
weren’t real bright for the com
ing two-game series.
STANFORD PLAYS USC on
Friday night and meets the
Bruins on Saturday. The Trojans,
who hit only 32 per cent of their
shots against UCLA, are just fin
ished with a three-week layoff for
final exams and the semester
break. Stanford will have been
idle for a week and a half when
they play the Trojans.
John Rudometkin, USC star
center, bagged 18 points last
weekend to keep up his 21 -point
average. He is now only three
points from a career total of 1300
points, a record for a Trojan. He
will have his hands full against

Tom Dose, scoring lender for the
Indians, and it will be interesting
to see who wins their "duel.”
Chris Appel is the second man
on the Trojans’ one-two scoring
punch. The deadly guard has a
hefty 15-point per game average

and has been a big fart nr in re
rent USC victories.
THE STANFOBII-USr basket
ball series, which began in 1923,
stands with a 71-57 advantage for
the Trojans. Last year the South
ern Cal men took all three Big
Five games from the Indians, and
Dallmar would like nothing bet
ter than to band a defeat to USC
coach Forrest Twogood.
Named players of the week at
the luncheon were Santa Clara’s
Leßoy Jackson and UOP’s Leo
Middleton. Jackson was the only
bright spot in Santa Clara’s los
ing cause to Stanford a week ago,
and Middieton has been a stand
out for HOP recently.


KEN STANLEY, Trojan forward, is
the third leading scorer on the
team. He was elected to all-AAWU
honorable mention last
season, and his rebounding this
year has been invaluable to USC.
Ken has been whistled for 59
fouls so far this season, tops on
the team.

fouls so far this season, tops on
the team.
Stanford basketball coach Howie
Dallmar has a maddeningly sim
ple task this weekend, namely to
coach the Indian cagers to (wo
wins over UCLA and USC.
Of course the Bruins and Tro
jans aren’t going to roll over and
play dead. Southern California is
ranked number seven in the na
tion and the pesky Bruins are cur
rently riding a hot streak that
carried them past the Trojans
last Friday.
Dallmar said at the Northern
California Basketball Writers
Luncheon Saturday that the up
coming weekend is crucial to
Card title chances. “If we're ever
going to make a strong bid for the
AAWU title, this had better be
it,” mentioned Howie. He also re
marked that he had watched the
Bruin-Trojan game and had been
particularly impressed by UCLA
guard Johnny Green, who hit on
his first eight shots from the
floor. In his opinion, both teams
were real good, and prospects
weren’t real bright for the com
ing two-game series.
STANFORD PLAYS USC on
Friday night and meets the
Bruins on Saturday. The Trojans,
who hit only 32 per cent of their
shots against UCLA, are just fin
ished with a three-week layoff for
final exams and the semester
break. Stanford will have been
idle for a week and a half when
they play the Trojans.
John Rudometkin, USC star
center, bagged 18 points last
weekend to keep up his 21 -point
average. He is now only three
points from a career total of 1300
points, a record for a Trojan. He
will have his hands full against

Tom Dose, scoring lender for the
Indians, and it will be interesting
to see who wins their "duel.”
Chris Appel is the second man
on the Trojans’ one-two scoring
punch. The deadly guard has a
hefty 15-point per game average

and has been a big fart nr in re
rent USC victories.
THE STANFOBII-USr basket
ball series, which began in 1923,
stands with a 71-57 advantage for
the Trojans. Last year the South
ern Cal men took all three Big
Five games from the Indians, and
Dallmar would like nothing bet
ter than to band a defeat to USC
coach Forrest Twogood.
Named players of the week at
the luncheon were Santa Clara’s
Leßoy Jackson and UOP’s Leo
Middleton. Jackson was the only
bright spot in Santa Clara’s los
ing cause to Stanford a week ago,
and Middieton has been a stand
out for HOP recently.


KEN STANLEY, Trojan forward, is
the third leading scorer on the
team. He was elected to all-AAWU
honorable mention last
season, and his rebounding this
year has been invaluable to USC.
Ken has been whistled for 59
fouls so far this season, tops on
the team.
