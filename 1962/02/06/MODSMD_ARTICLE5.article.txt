## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (UPI)
The hot election year budget ses-1
sion of the Legislature opened
yesterday with many Republicans
holding their nose at Gov. Ed
mund Brown’s $2.8 billion budget
and Democrats applauding it.
Brown told a joint session of
the Legislature that his budget of
$2,885,523,247 for the fiscal year
starting next July “adheres to
strict standards of austerity and
economy.”
The major increases in the now
budget include a $93 million boost
in education costs to a total of
$1.2 billion; a health program for
the aged and disabled aid, up $54
million, a five per cent pay raise
for some 100,000 state employes
costing $4O million, increases to
local governments for such things
as health, welfare, schools and
flood control, $145 million.
NOT REFLECTED in the $2.8
billion program was another $B2O
million which Brown said he
would submit to the voters in the
Juno and November elections in
the form of bond issues.
They will include $lOO million
for a five-year beach and park
acquisition program; $270 million
for state construction, including
state colleges and the university
and adding junior colleges, of
which $l4l million will be spent
in the now budget; $250 million
for the self-liquidating veterans’
farm and home loan program and
$2OO million for elementary school
construction.
REPUBLICANS, waging a cam
paign to recapture almost all of
the state’s top offices this year,
called the budget “terrible.”
Assemblyman Joseph C. Shell
of Los Angeles, a candidate for
the Republican nomination for
Governor, said Brown used a
“bookkeeping trick” to balance
the budget.
Shell said borrowing from re
serve funds and from lending in
stitutions by the use of $B2O mil
lion in new bond issues would
make higher- taxes “inevitable”
by 1964.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (UPI)
The hot election year budget ses-1
sion of the Legislature opened
yesterday with many Republicans
holding their nose at Gov. Ed
mund Brown’s $2.8 billion budget
and Democrats applauding it.
Brown told a joint session of
the Legislature that his budget of
$2,885,523,247 for the fiscal year
starting next July “adheres to
strict standards of austerity and
economy.”
The major increases in the now
budget include a $93 million boost
in education costs to a total of
$1.2 billion; a health program for
the aged and disabled aid, up $54
million, a five per cent pay raise
for some 100,000 state employes
costing $4O million, increases to
local governments for such things
as health, welfare, schools and
flood control, $145 million.
NOT REFLECTED in the $2.8

would submit to the voters in the
Juno and November elections in
the form of bond issues.
