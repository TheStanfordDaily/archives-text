# Rusk Justifies Aid To Tito’s Regime--May Defy Kremlin
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD- Secre
tary of Slate Doan Rusk defended
U.S. military and economic aid to
Communist Yugoslavia yester
day.

He predicted the Tito regime
would stay neutral in event of
war and is less dangerous to the
West than Fidel Castro’s Cuban
government.

Rusk underwent extensive ques
tioning about the administration’s
policy towards Yugoslavia by a
special House Committee on
Trade with Red Nations.
HK SAID that should an East-
West conflict break out, “I would
suppose. . .the Yugoslavs would
make a strong effort to stay out
of it.” Rusk testified that Ameri
can assistance, including the sale
of planes, has helped Yugoslavia
to achieve independence of Krem
lin control.

He cited Cuba as part of the
world communist conspiracy
while the results of U.S. coopera
tion with Tito “have more than
met our expectations.”
Rep, A. Paul Kitchin, D-N.C.,
chairman of the House group,
told Rusk that he felt one com
munist government was as 1 ad as
another from the U.S. view.
BUT KUSK said that the de
cision to maintain cordial rela
tions with the Tito government
has paid off since the policy was
initiated in the Truman adminis
tration and continued by former
president Dwight D. Eisenhower
and President Kennedy.
“Yugoslav support was with
drawn from the civil war in
Greece,” he recounted. “The Tri
este question was resolved. Bor
der and minority issues were
shelved. Albania was geographic
ally isolated from the Soviet bloc,
thus permitting its ultimate defi
ance of Moscow.”
The cabinet member comment
ed: “Yugoslavia remains the out
standing example of successful
defiance by a communist country
of Soviet imperialism. It has
shown the world that escape from
the Soviet system is possible and
that development in close cooper
ation with the West produces re
sults superior to those possible
under the tutelage of the Soviet
Union.”

Rusk said any change in U.S.
policy which might drive Tito
back into the Soviet bloc “would
be a serious blow to the West.”

that development in close cooper
ation with the West produces re
sults superior to those possible
under the tutelage of the Soviet
Union.”

Rusk said any change in U.S.
policy which might drive Tito
back into the Soviet bloc “would
be a serious blow to the West.”
WASHINGTON (UPD- Secre
tary of Slate Doan Rusk defended
U.S. military and economic aid to
Communist Yugoslavia yester
day.

He predicted the Tito regime
would stay neutral in event of
war and is less dangerous to the
West than Fidel Castro’s Cuban
government.

Rusk underwent extensive ques
tioning about the administration’s
policy towards Yugoslavia by a
special House Committee on
Trade with Red Nations.
HK SAID that should an East-
West conflict break out, “I would
suppose. . .the Yugoslavs would
make a strong effort to stay out
of it.” Rusk testified that Ameri
can assistance, including the sale
of planes, has helped Yugoslavia
to achieve independence of Krem
lin control.

He cited Cuba as part of the
world communist conspiracy
while the results of U.S. coopera
tion with Tito “have more than
met our expectations.”
Rep, A. Paul Kitchin, D-N.C.,
chairman of the House group,
told Rusk that he felt one com
munist government was as 1 ad as
another from the U.S. view.
BUT KUSK said that the de
cision to maintain cordial rela
tions with the Tito government
has paid off since the policy was
initiated in the Truman adminis
tration and continued by former
president Dwight D. Eisenhower
and President Kennedy.
“Yugoslav support was with
drawn from the civil war in
Greece,” he recounted. “The Tri
este question was resolved. Bor
der and minority issues were
shelved. Albania was geographic
ally isolated from the Soviet bloc,
thus permitting its ultimate defi
ance of Moscow.”
The cabinet member comment
ed: “Yugoslavia remains the out
standing example of successful
defiance by a communist country
of Soviet imperialism. It has
shown the world that escape from
the Soviet system is possible and
that development in close cooper
ation with the West produces re
sults superior to those possible
under the tutelage of the Soviet
Union.”
