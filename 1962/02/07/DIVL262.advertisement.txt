HOW TO BE A BWOC
Ladies, let mo lip frank. The days of tlio college year dwindle
down to a precious few. And some of you—let’s face it—have
hot yet become BWOC’s. Vos, I know, you’ve been busy what
with going to class and walking your cheetah, but really, ladies,
becoming a BWOC! is so easy if you’ll only follow a few simple
rules.
The first and most basic stop on the road to being a BWOC
is to attract attention, (let,yourself noticed. But he very, very
careful not to do it the wrong way. I mean, any old girl is
bound to be noticed if she goes around with a placard that says,
“II ICY! LOOK IT MB!’’ Don’t you make -u eh a horrid gaffe.
On your placard put: “ZT'T! BEOABDLZ MOI!” This, as
you can see, lends a whole new dimension of tone and dignity.
Once you have been noticed, it is no longer necessary to carry
the placard. It will suffice if, from time to time, you make
distinctive noises. If, for instance, every three or four minutes
you cry, “Whippoorwill!” you cannot but stay fresh in the
minds of onlookers.
We come now to clothes, a vital accessory to the BWOC
indeed, to any girl who wishes to remain out of jail. But to the
BWOC! clothes are more than just a decent cover; they are,
it is not too much to say, away of life.
This spring the “little boy look” is all (he rage on campus.
Every coed, in a mad effort to look like a little boy, is wearing
short pants, knee sox, and boyshirts. But the BWOC is doing
more. She has gone the whole hog in achieving little boyhood.
She has frogs in her pockets, scabs on her knees, down on her
upper lip, and is followed everywhere by a dog named Spot.
All this, of course, is only by day. When evening falls and her
date comes calling, the BWOC is the very picture of chic fem
ininity. She dresses in severe, simple basic black, relieved only
by a fourteen pound charm bracelet. Her hair is exquisitely
coiffed, with a fresh rubber band around the pony tail. Her
daytime sneakers have been replaced by fashionable high
heeled pumps, and she does not remove them until she gets to
the movies.
After the movies, at the campus cafe, the BWOC undergoes
her severest test. The true BWOC will never, never, never, order
the entire menu. This is gluttony and can only cause one’s date
to blanch. The true BWOC will pick six or seven good entrees
and then have nothing more till dessert. This is class and Is
the hallmark of the true BWOC.
Finally, the BWOC', upon being asked by the cigarette vendor
which is the brand of her choice, will always reply, “Marlboro,
of course!’’ For any girl knows that a Marlboro in one’s hand
stamps one instantly as a person of taste and discernment, as
the possessor of an educated palate, as a connoisseur of the finer,
loftier pleasures. This Marlboro, this badge of savoir-faire,
comes to you in flip-top boxes that flip, or in soft packs that are
soft, with a filter that filters and a flavor that is flavorful, in alt
fifty states of the Union and Duluth. ® 1902Max.simimwi
RMOC: Buy Marlboro On Campus. Buy them downtown,
100. Either place, you gel a lot to like.
