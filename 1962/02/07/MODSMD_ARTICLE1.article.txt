# OVERFLOW AUDIENCE
## Waves of Laughter For Cerf 
### BILL REPPY 
Bennett Cerf said last night
that one good belly-laugh is bet
ter for a man than all the anti
biotics and pills developed in the
last twenty years. He must have
left Stanford believing he’d done
wonders for the health of the au
dience which packed Memorial
Auditorium, as his Tuesday Eve
ning series talk drew snickers
and guffaws from start to finish.

Orf's speech will lx- rebroad
cast today at 3:00 p.m. by KZSU.

The crowd was undoubtedly the
largest drawn by a lecturer to
date this school year. Mom Aud
was full almost 30 minutes before
Cerf’s talk began.
HUNDREDS gathered outside
to hear the publisher, author, I
columnist, and TV panelist j
(What’s My Lino?) over the loud-|
speaker.
i Among the audience were
Shirley Temple and her husband.
They had earlier joined Mr. and
Mrs. Corf for dinner at Branner
Hall. "We’re personal friends of
the Cerfs,” said a beaming Shir
ley, who lives in Atherton.)
Cerf hit upon myriad subjects
in His quip-rich talk.
He started, where else, with the
weather and jokes about fog, in
cluding one on President Ken
nedy: seems JFK once had to
hitch hike to a rally in the Los
Angeles Coliseum when dense fog
grounded his helicopter on the
freeway.
TURNING to the serious: "Peo
ple got more thrills and pleasures
out of living today than in any
preceding generation. Some call
ours the ‘Age of Exasperation,, ’’
lie said. We must put up with one
“deliberately manufactured cri
sis’ after another—Berlin, Laos,
Cuba. “Khrushchev at a PTA
meeting in Minsk announcing he’s
going to kill us,” etc.
Cerf then turned to his own pro
fession, publishing, and had a few
terse words on censorship. The
threat of censorship, ho said,
comes from the “lunatic left and
the lunatic right—both equally
dangerous” (applause).
The extreme left he described
as “penniless bums;” the extreme
right: “men rich enough to know
better, but very impatient.”
CRUSADING ladies who try to
pressure controversial books off
the shelves of their local stores,
he said, turn these very books
into "international best sellers” by
the publicity they create. His ex
amples: “Lady Chatterley’s Lov
er” and “Tropic of Cancer,” both
of which he described this way
“so boring to read they accom
plish something 1 nevei thought
could be done; they make sex
seem dull.”
Serious once again, Cerf rec
ommended that U.S. reporters be
sent to Red China and that “Com
munism be studied in every school
in the country how can you
fight an enemy effectively if you
don’t know what you’re fighting
against?”
