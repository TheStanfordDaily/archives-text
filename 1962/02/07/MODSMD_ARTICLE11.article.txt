# Senate Approves College Aid Bill
## $2.67 Billion in Loans for Classrooms, Scholarships 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The
Senate last night approved Presi
dent Kennedy’s $2.(57 billion aid
program to loan the nation’s col
leges money to build classrooms
and provide 212,500 four-year
scholarships for needy and talent-

Ed students.
The vote was 69-17.
The measure, far broader than
a college aid bill passed by the
House last week, also would au
thorize $250 million in grants to
two-year community colleges.
Within hours after receiving the
message, the Senate approved
Kennedy’s college program as
well as $250 million in aid the
President didn't request for two
year community colleges. The bill
now goes to Senate-House con
ferees who will try to work out a
compromise with a smaller House
passed version containing only
the construction funds.
Senate passage came after the
chamber rejected an effort to lack
on aid to public grade and high
schools. This kept the college
measure free of the religious con
troversy which scuttled Ken
nedy’s education program last
year.
KENNEDY EARLIER yester
day sent to Congress a $5.7 bil
lion education program including
the higher education and public
school aid. He urged the law
makers to act without delay be
cause “we cannot afford to lose
another year.’’
The Senate’s college bill now
goes to a House-Senate confer
ence committee to work out a
compromise with the $.5 billion
House version, which does not in
clude scholarships or assistance
to junior colleges.
Just before the final vote, the
Senate defeated 72-15 a controver
sial proposal by Sen. Sam J. Er
vin Jr., D-N.C., which would have
prohibited the use of federal
loans by private or church-sup
ported colleges.
THE STEAM WAS taken out of
Ervin’s proposal Monday, how
ever, when the Senate approved
an amendment permitting private
schools to use the funds but pro
hibiting their use for building fa
cilities primarily for religious in
struction or worship.
The public grade and high
school amendment, sponsored by
Sen. Pat McNamara, D-Mich..
was defeated by voice vote. Sen.
Wayne Morse, D-Ore., floor man
ager of the college bill, urged the
Senate to reject what he termed
“crippling amendments” no mat
ter how laudatory their purpose.
He warned that approval of the
public school amendment would
doom all education legislation in
the House this year.
THE SENATE also defeated a
move to replace Kennedy's pro
posal for 212,500 scholarships,
costing $924 million, with a much
more modest expansion of a stu
dent loan program. The amend
ment, sponsored by Sen. Frank
Lausche, D-Ohio, was defeated on
a 50 to 37 roll call vote.
The lawmakers defeated 61-28
another proposal to finance edu
cational facilities by giving states
$455 million a year in federal cig
arette taxes.

The Senate’s college bill now
goes to a House-Senate confer
ence committee to work out a
compromise with the $.5 billion
House version, which does not in
clude scholarships or assistance
to junior colleges.
Just before the final vote, the
Senate defeated 72-15 a controver
sial proposal by Sen. Sam J. Er
vin Jr., D-N.C., which would have
prohibited the use of federal
loans by private or church-sup
ported colleges.
THE STEAM WAS taken out of
Ervin’s proposal Monday, how
ever, when the Senate approved
an amendment permitting private
schools to use the funds but pro
hibiting their use for building fa
cilities primarily for religious in
struction or worship.
The public grade and high
school amendment, sponsored by
Sen. Pat McNamara, D-Mich..
was defeated by voice vote. Sen.
Wayne Morse, D-Ore., floor man
ager of the college bill, urged the
Senate to reject what he termed
“crippling amendments” no mat
ter how laudatory their purpose.
He warned that approval of the
public school amendment would
doom all education legislation in
the House this year.
THE SENATE also defeated a
move to replace Kennedy's pro
posal for 212,500 scholarships,
costing $924 million, with a much
more modest expansion of a stu
dent loan program. The amend
ment, sponsored by Sen. Frank
Lausche, D-Ohio, was defeated on
a 50 to 37 roll call vote.
The lawmakers defeated 61-28
another proposal to finance edu
cational facilities by giving states
$455 million a year in federal cig
arette taxes.
WASHINGTON (UPI) The
Senate last night approved Presi
dent Kennedy’s $2.(57 billion aid
program to loan the nation’s col
leges money to build classrooms
and provide 212,500 four-year
scholarships for needy and talent-

Ed students.
The vote was 69-17.
The measure, far broader than
a college aid bill passed by the
House last week, also would au
thorize $250 million in grants to
two-year community colleges.
Within hours after receiving the
message, the Senate approved
Kennedy’s college program as
well as $250 million in aid the
President didn't request for two
year community colleges. The bill
now goes to Senate-House con
ferees who will try to work out a
compromise with a smaller House
passed version containing only
the construction funds.
Senate passage came after the
chamber rejected an effort to lack
on aid to public grade and high
schools. This kept the college
measure free of the religious con
troversy which scuttled Ken
nedy’s education program last
year.
KENNEDY EARLIER yester
