ACCURATE PICTURE
Editor, The Dally:
We, the undersigned, have per
sonally attended one or more
SAYR elections over the last
three years. We testify that the
article by Mr. Bierstedt gave an
accurate picture of these affairs.
We further note that if the ar
ticle is false, Mr. Bierstedt will
be open to libel action. We doubt
that the SAYR will bring a libel
suit in court, since they would
leave themselves wide open to
prosecution on charges of selling
liquor to minors.

OBVIOUS ERROR
Editor, The Daily;
At the start, it is not my inten
tion to rebut the allegations of
Mr. Peter Bierstedt in his calum
ny published in Monday’s Daily.
I would not grace his accusations
with such a rebuttal. Two of the
fellow members of the Stanford
Young Republicans, who attended
the convention as I did, will clari
fy the more obvious errors.

However, after reading the I
gentleman’s remarks, I must say
that he relied upon his imagina
tion for his facts. I will not, dwell
on the character of the person
who would make such accusa
tions, for I feel that the letter
does this itself.
I would like to remind all the
readers of this paper to read the
true situations as will he set forth
by the honorable gentlemen of
the Stanford Young Republicans
in a Daily article.
I would also ask the editors of
this newspaper to fully consider
the responsibility of the persons
and situations and their truth and
clarity before publishing such tra
vesties of the truth. It is merely
a question of prudence and integ
rity on the part of the editors.
The characters and reputation
of a fine organization and its
members are at stake in this sit
uation. It is quite sorry indeed to
see that intelligent and responsi
ble people are subject to such
writings ....

BOSS
Editor, The Daily:
Last week, according to The
Daily, we conservatives were
“radical right wing extremists”;
this week, like Socrates, we are
corruptors of youth. What can the
coeditors have in mind for next
week?
On the basis of Bierstedt’s ar
ticle, I might have expected to
receive: 1) a pair of dark glasses
and a lucrative job offer from
sometime Tammany boss Car
mine DiSapio, who obviously
needs my help; 2) a note of con
gratulations from Mayor Richard
Daley of Chicago who needs help
from no one, but recognizes tal
ent; and, 3) a letter of denuncia
tion from Mrs. Roosevelt. Alas,
none of these worthies are credu
lous enough to believe Bierstedt’s
fabrication!
Richard E. “Boss” Noble
TOOL
Editor, The Daily:
After Pete Bierstedt had sub
mitted his letter to The Daily and
had been requested to write an ar
ticle, a mutual friend brought him
to me with the request that I tell
them about the past throe years
in SAYR’s.
While it is true that Mr. Bier
stedt did use some of what ho
learned from me in a portion of
his article, Mr. Hunter is mis
taken if he thinks that very much
was taken from me. I was neither
the inspiration of the article nor
the principal source. I understand
that Mr. Bierstedt is able to docu
ment everything he said, through
personal observation and eye-wit
ness accounts. Furthermore, Mr.
Hunter was not at the party in
question; Mr. Bierstedt was.
Last year I was convinced of
the truth of Mr. Noble’s allega
tions that the opposing candi
date’s victory would be a disaster.
But I am not above admitting my
mistakes. I was duped by half
truths and invalid promises, as
have been many others with no
previous experience of such a ma
chine.
However, some time ago it be
came clear to me that SAYR’s
were being used as a tool for the
advancement of a few—one man
especially. After I determined up
on an independent course of ac
tion, I found that I was not able
to count upon the performance of

their duties by those members of
my administration who constitute
most of the present administra
tion.

After that time my term was
“distinguished” by resistance and
outright obstructionism on the
part of those willing to do the
bidding of their unofficial boss,
Dick Noble. Up to Nov. 16, 1961,
the members of the current ad
ministration who were on last
term’s Ex-Board, nine in all, had
an attendance record at its meet
ings of 48 per cent, and Dick
Weinig’s was even less: 40 per
cent. Thus has the very purpose
of a YR club been subverted while
it was made into the tool of one
man and his separatist wing of
the party.
Such corruption cannot stand
the light of public exposure, and
it is my hope that Mr. Bierstedt’s
decision to expose it will restore
respectability to SAYR’s. The
rumblings of grass-roots revolt
are already audible.
Robert Siemer
AS STATED
Editor, The Daily:
I, too, am a former SAYR offi
cer and would like the opportuni
ty to state what I know about the
Stanford Area Young Republi
cans. I joined SAYR last year as
a freshman in order to meet Gold
water and Nixon in person. I was
given this opportunity.

I also learned how malicious
politics can be, and resigned in
disgust from my office of execu
tive secretary last fall. I speak
from the knowledge I gained in
attending weekly SAYR executive
committee meetings, numerous
San Mateo County board meet
ings, and the California Young
Republican College Federation in
Oakland last spring.
The main purpose of the pres
ent SAYR is to sell for two rea
sons as many memberships as
possible to incoming freshmen.
First, the price of two dollars is
the main source of income for the
club, which as a partisan group
is not supported by ASSU. Second
and more important, voting
strength in YR county and state
elections is determined by the
number of members each local
club has.

Those people who benefit most
from these votes are those people
seeking political recognition by
being elected to county and state
YR offices. Thus Dick Noble and
liis associates find it greatly ex
pedient to their own political ca
reers to mastermind the Stanford
Area club and insure that it has
enough members.
Why are freshmen the main
target of the membership drive?
As stated in an ex-com meeting I
attended last fall, “Many fresh
men don’t have cars. Therefore,
the receptions we hold for po
litical speakers are a good oppor
tunity for freshmen to attend off
campus functions.
At the same meeting, Mr. Noble
cautioned us to be careful with
reception invitations, reminding
us of the incident of the cocktail
glasses with the Dean.
The denials printed in yester
day’s Daily prompted me to write
this letter, because I also attend
ed last year’s county elections and
found the situation to be mostly
as stated. The majority of the
freshmen attending were recruit
ed for the evening and were not
acquainted with the candidates or
issues.

The largest example of the ac
tion of SAYR masterminds occur
red at the College Federation
Oakland convention. The Stan
ford Area club had a voting
strength of 32; however two
thirds of that number had to bo
present at the convention. When
the SAYR delegation stood at
only 18, it rounded up “bodies”
from Stanford, Cal, and even
Oakland area high schools and
gave them fake membership
cards.

Not all SAYR officers and
members are content with the
hierarchy that prevails. However,
there seems to be no ready alter
native allowing the SAYR to
again be an organization promot
ing partisan politics and provid
ing opportunities to meet top po
litical leaders.

TRUE

Editor, The Daily:
In the letter by Messrs. Noble,
Hermann, and Weinig, they deny
all the accusations in Mr. Bier
stedt’s letter. Well, I, for one,
know that some of the “accusa
tions” are true.

For one thing, Mr. Noble and
Jim Sensenbrenner came into my
room at Wilbur Hall and invited

me to come to the YR election,
saying that there would be a beer
party afterwards, and that I
would get a membership card to
vote with.
I must admit that the hire of
free beer was too much to with
stand, and I went to the election.
Before we left on the buses pro
vided, I was given a membership
card of a SAYR member who was
not going, along with his student
body card for identification,
I did vote on this card, and, a
little after midnight, one of the
buses left the convention and
went to The Party House in San
Carlos. On this bus were two kegs
of beer. At The Party House, the
beer was made available to any
one who was present, with no re
gard for age.
If this is typical of all YR con
ventions, I am glad that I am not
a member of the Young Republi
cans.

OBJECTIVE
Editor, Tin* Daily:
The leaders of the Stanford
Area Young Republicans, Messrs.
Noble, Hermann, and Weinig, re
plied in yesterday’s Daily to a
very objective letter by Mr. Bier
stedt. I believe that it is now time
to summarize the position of both
sides to see exactly what Mr. No
ble and Company did deny.
Mr. Bierstedt explained that
word of a free beer party was cir
culated throughout the campus;
that free fake cards were given
either for the evening or perma
nently; and that representatives
of the club mentioned both these
items when going through our
house, Madera. ALL ARE TRUE.

Let’s examine the reply in yes
terday’s Daily. Messrs. Noble, j
Hermann, and Wcinig alleged the |
article to be “malicious,” “vi
cious,” and challenged Mr. Bier
stedt to produce all his witnesses.
I am such a witness. Notice that
they did not refute any of the ac
tual accusations mentioned in
Mr. Bierstedt’s letter, but instead
resorted to “name-calling.” Could
it be that the machine wishes to
find out the exact number of wit
nesses before they specifically
deny any of the charges?

UNWARRANTED
Editor, The Daily:
In yesterday’s edition of The |
Daily, Mr. Paul Hunter made cer-1
tain accusations which seem to be!
completely unwarranted. In com- j
menting on the recent letter of |
Mr. Peter Bierstedt concerning
the activities at the latest San
Mateo County Young Republi
cans’ election, Mr. Hunter insinu- j
ated that Mr. Bierstedt’s com- j
ments were part of a “personal |
revenge campaign” instigated by j
a former SAYR official, Mr. Bob!
Siemer.
This is absolutely and flatly!
not true. As a friend of Mr. Bier- j
stedt, I am in a position to know j
(as Mr. Hunter is not) that per- j
sonal political animosities played
no part in Mr. Bierstedt’s actions.
His letter to The Daily was in
stead an expression of disgust at
activities he felt to be distasteful
and unwarranted.

After the original submission
of his letter, and solely for infor
mation, Mr. Bierstedt sought out
Mr. Siemer and questioned him
about the recent history of the
SAYR’s. Far from inspiring or in
stigating this affair, Mr. Siemer
was reluctant to spend much time
with it, due to a pressing aca-
