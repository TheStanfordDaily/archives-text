# Abolition,' 'Correction' Both Fail in Contentions
## 
### NILS WESSELL Associate Editor 
“Operation Abolition” and “Op
eration Correction,” giving con
tradicting versions of the HUAC
riot in May, 1960, both fail to
support convincingly their major
contentions.
“Operation Abolition” contends
that the San Francisco riot was
led and inspired by Communists;
their whole argument rests not
on filmed evidence hut on the
narration of Fulton Lewis 111, not
a disinterested party.
“Operation Correction” insists
that the House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee, and more
specifically chairman Francis
Walter, D-Pa., deliberately dis
torted its version of the riotous
days in “Operation Abolition” in
order to prove Communist in
spiration.
THE TWO FILMS, presented
to an overflowing Mem Aud
crowd by El Campo, share some
common attributes: both appeal
to (he same corny Americanism
that is intended to convince view
ers emotionally instead of reason
ably, and in their narrations both
make assertions that appear du
bious at best.
“Operation Abolition” waves
the flag in the name of home,
hearth, and J. Edgar Hoover
whereas “Operation Correction”
reflects the motives of its pro
ducer. the American Civil Liber
ties Union. The Union waves the
flag in the name of “traditional”
American freedoms and (he mod
ern, more controversial Southern
sit-in movements.
IT IS in their specific asser
demic load.
It seems that Mr. Hunter has
pulled his description of the mo
tives behind Mr. Bierstedt’s ac
tions out of a hat. I would suggest
that an apology is in order and
that Mr. Hunter might best re
frain from such conjecture in
matters beyond the range of his
personal experience.

lions regarding the riot that the
films fail more significantly. “Op
eration Abolition” does not prove
that Communists led or inspired
the riot. In this it is irresponsible
since it claims to prove its point
incontestably. The ACLU film, if
we can trust the ACLU subtitles
and commentary more readily
than the HUAC narration, cites at
least eight instances of falsifica
tion by the HUAC film. It insists
that events one day before and
one day after the riot were rear
ranged to appear as events imme
diately preceding the Friday riot
when police turned fire hoses on
the demonstrators and pushed
passive resisters down the City
Hall steps.
When students began chanting
and singing, the ACLII says that
the noise could not have been in
terrupting testimony since the
Committee was not in session.
To counter the charge that
Robert Meisenhach leaped the po
lice barricade and assaulted an
officer. “Operation Correction”
cites his acquittal of the charge
in a court trial.
AND TO counter the charge
that one patrolman suffered a
stroke when pushed by demon
strators, “Operation Correction”
cites the police report that the
officer had merely collapsed from
exhaustion.
The weakness of most of “Op
eration Correction” is that it, too,
depends on its narration to sup
port its case. It charges the
HUAC with wanting publicity and
getting it by deliberately encour
aging self-confessed Communist
Archie Brown and others to pro
voke the student demonstrators.
The ACLU insists that the com
mittee could have ejected Brown
before he provoked outbursts.
The resultant publicity allowed
the HUAC to popularize the be
lief that all its opponents are
either Communists or their dupes,
according to “Operation Correc
tion.” The film implies the HUAC
wanted to perpetuate itself with
out receiving further criticism.
