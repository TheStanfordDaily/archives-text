On the perils of being a sports addict in the Bay Area.
My joy knew no bounds when the New York Giants announced
toward the end of the 1957 baseball season that (hey were moving to
the city by the Golden Gate. I had been a Giant fan for several years,
and the thought of seeing Willie Mays in person, along with others
such as Stan Musial, Duke Snider, Warren Spahn, and on and on
filled my heart with joy.
Unfortunately, the performance of the Giants in the four years
they have been here has filled my life with grief.
Every year, the Giants start out as world-beaters. Over the first
two months of every year- Urey tear the league apart, only to fall by
the wayside when the going gels rough. One year, 1959, they even
managed to stick it out ’til the last week of the season.
In the Giants’ first year here. 1958, they finished third, and had
the league standing on its ear' well into July, wheir they fell afoul,
of all things, the then lowly Cincinnati Reds. An obscure outfielder
named Pete Whisenant effectively applied the brakes to the then
skidding Giants with a pinch-homer.
That year was marked by the weirdest base-running to hit the big
time since the Dodgers had three men on third. Orlando Cepeda in
particular ran through so many signals flashed by third base coach
Herman Franks that the latter quit the team in disgust. It seems the
fans blamed him for the “Baby Bull’s” impetuous conduct on the
hasepaths.
The year 1959 is also known in San Francisco as “The Year the
Bubble Burst,” Hiding high for all but the last week of the season,
San Francisco ran afoul of the Dodgers and collapsed so hard and
loudly that the Cubs heard them in Chicago and determined to finish
the job. They did, mainly on a homer by George Altman off “broke
arm” Sam Jones.
Jones Responded to Treatment
Jones was so tired that Bill Rigney decided to give him a day off
on the last day of the year by pitching him against the St. Louis
Cards, Jones responded to this kind treatment by hurling a no-hitter.
1960 is best forgotten by all save the Pittsburgh Pirates. The
Giants were a few games out of first place in early June when they
lost a couple to the Pirates, something which wasn’t unusual because
every National League team had been doing the same thing.
Nevertheless, Horace Stoneham, dubbed “Squire” by a profes
sional sarcastic working for one of San Francisco’s morning news
papers, decided that the Giants needed a change. So he fired Rigney,
who had brought the Giants two third place finishes and had raised
the Giants from sixth to third in one year.
Panic, cried the newspapers, but they had seen nothing yet.
Stoneham hired a former house-detective, chief scout named Tom
“Clancy” Sheehan to pilot the team for the last part of the year.
Sheehan’s duties as chief scout consisted of drinking prodigious
quantities of Vat 69, in the company of Stoneham and second guess
ing the present manager.
Rigney suggested that Sheehan second-guessed him out of a job.
If Sheehan thought he was a brilliant second-guesser, the Giant fans
taught him a few things about that art with choice queries of their
own. Such as “Why don’t you go back to being a house-dick?”
To no avail. Stoneham was convinced his buddy could drag the
Giants out of the doldrums. He didn’t, and the Giants finished a
dismal fifth.
Were the Giants Playboys?
Sheehan complained bitterly that the Giants were a gang of in
dividualistic playboys. How could anyone be a successful manager
with such a team? he asked. Well, Rigney did all right, and Alvin
Dark had them third at the tag end of this year.
In many ways the Alvin Dark year was the most frustrating of
them all. There w'ere times when the Giants were undoubtedly the
class of baseball, and other times they stunk up an already stinking
Candlestick Park.
For instance, they tromped the pennant-winning Cincinnati Reds
16-0. Juan Marichel gave up only two hits, and the Giants scored 14
runs in the ninth inning. In that frame the Giants belted five home
runs and massacred the most consistent pitching in the National loop.
The Jints beat the Cubs 18-3 in the first half of a double-header,
only to drop the second game 5-3 when the umpire refused to call a
game that as played in all the light of an eclipse of the moon.
1960 saw such memorable moments as Sheriff Dark’s decree that
Jack Stanford would complete a start against the Phillies. (Sanford
won, after wobbling slightly in (he final three frames). Sheriff Dark’s
decree that the Giants would use no signals, after having dropped a
game to the Dodgers. 'The Giants dropped three more to the Bums
and fell out of the pennant race). Sheriff Dark’s decree that perhaps
the Giants should use signals after all. (The Giants toppled Los
Angeles three times and clinched the flag for Cincinnati).
However the real star of the 1960 season was Candlestick Park.
The wind at Candlestick drew more national attention than Willy
Mays’ four homers against Milwaukee, or Spahn’s no-hitter against
the Giants. For many San Franciscans, the high-light of the year
was the wind that blew Miller off the mound at Candlestick during
the All-Star Game.
The wind and cold at Candlestick Park got so bad that Melvin
Belli, leading local pettifogger, sued for his money back for a s2ooo+
season ticket. Sympathetic jurors, who presumably had been to the
big concrete structure by Visitacion Drain, awarded him the rebate,
and others who had bought season tickets were reportedly licking
their chops over the prospect of getting some ready cash. The corn
merits of Horace Stoneham were not recorded, hut it is just as well,
since they couldn’t be printed anyway.

One San Francisco pundit summed up the whole affair, penning,
“Selling a season ticket to Melvin Belli was the Giants’ biggest mis
taken since putting Willy McCovey on first base.”

This series of ups and downs the Giants have gone through since
gracing the Bay Area with their presence, is in the spirit that
prompted a Giant fan to write a story for SPORT MAGAZINE
entitled “A Giant Fan’s Lament, or, My Heart Is a Yo-Yo.”

That year was marked by the weirdest base-running to hit the big
time since the Dodgers had three men on third. Orlando Cepeda in
particular ran through so many signals flashed by third base coach
Herman Franks that the latter quit the team in disgust. It seems the
fans blamed him for the “Baby Bull’s” impetuous conduct on the
hasepaths.
The year 1959 is also known in San Francisco as “The Year the
Bubble Burst,” Hiding high for all but the last week of the season,
San Francisco ran afoul of the Dodgers and collapsed so hard and
loudly that the Cubs heard them in Chicago and determined to finish
the job. They did, mainly on a homer by George Altman off “broke
arm” Sam Jones.
Jones Responded to Treatment
Jones was so tired that Bill Rigney decided to give him a day off
on the last day of the year by pitching him against the St. Louis
Cards, Jones responded to this kind treatment by hurling a no-hitter.
1960 is best forgotten by all save the Pittsburgh Pirates. The
Giants were a few games out of first place in early June when they
lost a couple to the Pirates, something which wasn’t unusual because
every National League team had been doing the same thing.
Nevertheless, Horace Stoneham, dubbed “Squire” by a profes
sional sarcastic working for one of San Francisco’s morning news
papers, decided that the Giants needed a change. So he fired Rigney,
who had brought the Giants two third place finishes and had raised
the Giants from sixth to third in one year.
Panic, cried the newspapers, but they had seen nothing yet.
Stoneham hired a former house-detective, chief scout named Tom
“Clancy” Sheehan to pilot the team for the last part of the year.
Sheehan’s duties as chief scout consisted of drinking prodigious
quantities of Vat 69, in the company of Stoneham and second guess
ing the present manager.
Rigney suggested that Sheehan second-guessed him out of a job.
If Sheehan thought he was a brilliant second-guesser, the Giant fans
taught him a few things about that art with choice queries of their
own. Such as “Why don’t you go back to being a house-dick?”
To no avail. Stoneham was convinced his buddy could drag the
Giants out of the doldrums. He didn’t, and the Giants finished a
dismal fifth.
Were the Giants Playboys?
Sheehan complained bitterly that the Giants were a gang of in
dividualistic playboys. How could anyone be a successful manager
with such a team? he asked. Well, Rigney did all right, and Alvin
Dark had them third at the tag end of this year.
In many ways the Alvin Dark year was the most frustrating of
them all. There w'ere times when the Giants were undoubtedly the
class of baseball, and other times they stunk up an already stinking
Candlestick Park.
For instance, they tromped the pennant-winning Cincinnati Reds
16-0. Juan Marichel gave up only two hits, and the Giants scored 14
runs in the ninth inning. In that frame the Giants belted five home
runs and massacred the most consistent pitching in the National loop.
The Jints beat the Cubs 18-3 in the first half of a double-header,
only to drop the second game 5-3 when the umpire refused to call a
game that as played in all the light of an eclipse of the moon.
1960 saw such memorable moments as Sheriff Dark’s decree that
Jack Stanford would complete a start against the Phillies. (Sanford
won, after wobbling slightly in (he final three frames). Sheriff Dark’s
decree that the Giants would use no signals, after having dropped a
game to the Dodgers. 'The Giants dropped three more to the Bums
and fell out of the pennant race). Sheriff Dark’s decree that perhaps
the Giants should use signals after all. (The Giants toppled Los
Angeles three times and clinched the flag for Cincinnati).
However the real star of the 1960 season was Candlestick Park.
The wind at Candlestick drew more national attention than Willy
Mays’ four homers against Milwaukee, or Spahn’s no-hitter against
the Giants. For many San Franciscans, the high-light of the year
was the wind that blew Miller off the mound at Candlestick during
the All-Star Game.
The wind and cold at Candlestick Park got so bad that Melvin
Belli, leading local pettifogger, sued for his money back for a s2ooo+
season ticket. Sympathetic jurors, who presumably had been to the
big concrete structure by Visitacion Drain, awarded him the rebate,
and others who had bought season tickets were reportedly licking
their chops over the prospect of getting some ready cash. The corn
merits of Horace Stoneham were not recorded, hut it is just as well,
since they couldn’t be printed anyway.

One San Francisco pundit summed up the whole affair, penning,
“Selling a season ticket to Melvin Belli was the Giants’ biggest mis
taken since putting Willy McCovey on first base.”

This series of ups and downs the Giants have gone through since
gracing the Bay Area with their presence, is in the spirit that
prompted a Giant fan to write a story for SPORT MAGAZINE
entitled “A Giant Fan’s Lament, or, My Heart Is a Yo-Yo.”
On the perils of being a sports addict in the Bay Area.
My joy knew no bounds when the New York Giants announced
toward the end of the 1957 baseball season that (hey were moving to
the city by the Golden Gate. I had been a Giant fan for several years,
and the thought of seeing Willie Mays in person, along with others
such as Stan Musial, Duke Snider, Warren Spahn, and on and on
filled my heart with joy.
Unfortunately, the performance of the Giants in the four years
they have been here has filled my life with grief.
Every year, the Giants start out as world-beaters. Over the first
two months of every year- Urey tear the league apart, only to fall by
the wayside when the going gels rough. One year, 1959, they even
managed to stick it out ’til the last week of the season.
In the Giants’ first year here. 1958, they finished third, and had
the league standing on its ear' well into July, wheir they fell afoul,
of all things, the then lowly Cincinnati Reds. An obscure outfielder
named Pete Whisenant effectively applied the brakes to the then
skidding Giants with a pinch-homer.

every National League team had been doing the same thing.
Nevertheless, Horace Stoneham, dubbed “Squire” by a profes
sional sarcastic working for one of San Francisco’s morning news
papers, decided that the Giants needed a change. So he fired Rigney,
who had brought the Giants two third place finishes and had raised
the Giants from sixth to third in one year.
Panic, cried the newspapers, but they had seen nothing yet.
Stoneham hired a former house-detective, chief scout named Tom
“Clancy” Sheehan to pilot the team for the last part of the year.
Sheehan’s duties as chief scout consisted of drinking prodigious
quantities of Vat 69, in the company of Stoneham and second guess
ing the present manager.
Rigney suggested that Sheehan second-guessed him out of a job.
If Sheehan thought he was a brilliant second-guesser, the Giant fans
taught him a few things about that art with choice queries of their
own. Such as “Why don’t you go back to being a house-dick?”
To no avail. Stoneham was convinced his buddy could drag the
Giants out of the doldrums. He didn’t, and the Giants finished a
dismal fifth.
Were the Giants Playboys?
Sheehan complained bitterly that the Giants were a gang of in
dividualistic playboys. How could anyone be a successful manager
with such a team? he asked. Well, Rigney did all right, and Alvin
Dark had them third at the tag end of this year.
In many ways the Alvin Dark year was the most frustrating of
them all. There w'ere times when the Giants were undoubtedly the
class of baseball, and other times they stunk up an already stinking
Candlestick Park.
For instance, they tromped the pennant-winning Cincinnati Reds
16-0. Juan Marichel gave up only two hits, and the Giants scored 14
runs in the ninth inning. In that frame the Giants belted five home
runs and massacred the most consistent pitching in the National loop.
The Jints beat the Cubs 18-3 in the first half of a double-header,
only to drop the second game 5-3 when the umpire refused to call a
game that as played in all the light of an eclipse of the moon.
1960 saw such memorable moments as Sheriff Dark’s decree that
Jack Stanford would complete a start against the Phillies. (Sanford
won, after wobbling slightly in (he final three frames). Sheriff Dark’s
decree that the Giants would use no signals, after having dropped a
game to the Dodgers. 'The Giants dropped three more to the Bums
and fell out of the pennant race). Sheriff Dark’s decree that perhaps
the Giants should use signals after all. (The Giants toppled Los
Angeles three times and clinched the flag for Cincinnati).
However the real star of the 1960 season was Candlestick Park.
The wind at Candlestick drew more national attention than Willy
Mays’ four homers against Milwaukee, or Spahn’s no-hitter against
the Giants. For many San Franciscans, the high-light of the year
was the wind that blew Miller off the mound at Candlestick during
the All-Star Game.
The wind and cold at Candlestick Park got so bad that Melvin
Belli, leading local pettifogger, sued for his money back for a s2ooo+
season ticket. Sympathetic jurors, who presumably had been to the
big concrete structure by Visitacion Drain, awarded him the rebate,
and others who had bought season tickets were reportedly licking
their chops over the prospect of getting some ready cash. The corn
merits of Horace Stoneham were not recorded, hut it is just as well,
since they couldn’t be printed anyway.

One San Francisco pundit summed up the whole affair, penning,
“Selling a season ticket to Melvin Belli was the Giants’ biggest mis
taken since putting Willy McCovey on first base.”

This series of ups and downs the Giants have gone through since
gracing the Bay Area with their presence, is in the spirit that
prompted a Giant fan to write a story for SPORT MAGAZINE
entitled “A Giant Fan’s Lament, or, My Heart Is a Yo-Yo.”
On the perils of being a sports addict in the Bay Area.
My joy knew no bounds when the New York Giants announced
toward the end of the 1957 baseball season that (hey were moving to
the city by the Golden Gate. I had been a Giant fan for several years,
and the thought of seeing Willie Mays in person, along with others
such as Stan Musial, Duke Snider, Warren Spahn, and on and on
filled my heart with joy.
Unfortunately, the performance of the Giants in the four years
they have been here has filled my life with grief.
Every year, the Giants start out as world-beaters. Over the first
two months of every year- Urey tear the league apart, only to fall by
the wayside when the going gels rough. One year, 1959, they even
managed to stick it out ’til the last week of the season.
In the Giants’ first year here. 1958, they finished third, and had
the league standing on its ear' well into July, wheir they fell afoul,
of all things, the then lowly Cincinnati Reds. An obscure outfielder
named Pete Whisenant effectively applied the brakes to the then
skidding Giants with a pinch-homer.
That year was marked by the weirdest base-running to hit the big
time since the Dodgers had three men on third. Orlando Cepeda in
particular ran through so many signals flashed by third base coach
Herman Franks that the latter quit the team in disgust. It seems the
fans blamed him for the “Baby Bull’s” impetuous conduct on the
hasepaths.
The year 1959 is also known in San Francisco as “The Year the
Bubble Burst,” Hiding high for all but the last week of the season,
San Francisco ran afoul of the Dodgers and collapsed so hard and
loudly that the Cubs heard them in Chicago and determined to finish
the job. They did, mainly on a homer by George Altman off “broke
arm” Sam Jones.

Jones was so tired that Bill Rigney decided to give him a day off
on the last day of the year by pitching him against the St. Louis
Cards, Jones responded to this kind treatment by hurling a no-hitter.

dismal fifth.
Were the Giants Playboys?
Sheehan complained bitterly that the Giants were a gang of in
dividualistic playboys. How could anyone be a successful manager
with such a team? he asked. Well, Rigney did all right, and Alvin
Dark had them third at the tag end of this year.
In many ways the Alvin Dark year was the most frustrating of
them all. There w'ere times when the Giants were undoubtedly the
class of baseball, and other times they stunk up an already stinking
Candlestick Park.
For instance, they tromped the pennant-winning Cincinnati Reds
16-0. Juan Marichel gave up only two hits, and the Giants scored 14
runs in the ninth inning. In that frame the Giants belted five home
runs and massacred the most consistent pitching in the National loop.
The Jints beat the Cubs 18-3 in the first half of a double-header,
only to drop the second game 5-3 when the umpire refused to call a
game that as played in all the light of an eclipse of the moon.
1960 saw such memorable moments as Sheriff Dark’s decree that
Jack Stanford would complete a start against the Phillies. (Sanford
won, after wobbling slightly in (he final three frames). Sheriff Dark’s
decree that the Giants would use no signals, after having dropped a
game to the Dodgers. 'The Giants dropped three more to the Bums
and fell out of the pennant race). Sheriff Dark’s decree that perhaps
the Giants should use signals after all. (The Giants toppled Los
Angeles three times and clinched the flag for Cincinnati).
However the real star of the 1960 season was Candlestick Park.
The wind at Candlestick drew more national attention than Willy
Mays’ four homers against Milwaukee, or Spahn’s no-hitter against
the Giants. For many San Franciscans, the high-light of the year
was the wind that blew Miller off the mound at Candlestick during
the All-Star Game.
The wind and cold at Candlestick Park got so bad that Melvin
Belli, leading local pettifogger, sued for his money back for a s2ooo+
season ticket. Sympathetic jurors, who presumably had been to the
big concrete structure by Visitacion Drain, awarded him the rebate,
and others who had bought season tickets were reportedly licking
their chops over the prospect of getting some ready cash. The corn
merits of Horace Stoneham were not recorded, hut it is just as well,
since they couldn’t be printed anyway.

One San Francisco pundit summed up the whole affair, penning,
“Selling a season ticket to Melvin Belli was the Giants’ biggest mis
taken since putting Willy McCovey on first base.”

This series of ups and downs the Giants have gone through since
gracing the Bay Area with their presence, is in the spirit that
prompted a Giant fan to write a story for SPORT MAGAZINE
entitled “A Giant Fan’s Lament, or, My Heart Is a Yo-Yo.”
On the perils of being a sports addict in the Bay Area.
My joy knew no bounds when the New York Giants announced
toward the end of the 1957 baseball season that (hey were moving to
the city by the Golden Gate. I had been a Giant fan for several years,
and the thought of seeing Willie Mays in person, along with others
such as Stan Musial, Duke Snider, Warren Spahn, and on and on
filled my heart with joy.
Unfortunately, the performance of the Giants in the four years
they have been here has filled my life with grief.
Every year, the Giants start out as world-beaters. Over the first
two months of every year- Urey tear the league apart, only to fall by
the wayside when the going gels rough. One year, 1959, they even
managed to stick it out ’til the last week of the season.
In the Giants’ first year here. 1958, they finished third, and had
the league standing on its ear' well into July, wheir they fell afoul,
of all things, the then lowly Cincinnati Reds. An obscure outfielder
named Pete Whisenant effectively applied the brakes to the then
skidding Giants with a pinch-homer.
That year was marked by the weirdest base-running to hit the big
time since the Dodgers had three men on third. Orlando Cepeda in
particular ran through so many signals flashed by third base coach
Herman Franks that the latter quit the team in disgust. It seems the
fans blamed him for the “Baby Bull’s” impetuous conduct on the
hasepaths.
The year 1959 is also known in San Francisco as “The Year the
Bubble Burst,” Hiding high for all but the last week of the season,
San Francisco ran afoul of the Dodgers and collapsed so hard and
loudly that the Cubs heard them in Chicago and determined to finish
the job. They did, mainly on a homer by George Altman off “broke
arm” Sam Jones.
Jones Responded to Treatment
Jones was so tired that Bill Rigney decided to give him a day off
on the last day of the year by pitching him against the St. Louis
Cards, Jones responded to this kind treatment by hurling a no-hitter.
1960 is best forgotten by all save the Pittsburgh Pirates. The
Giants were a few games out of first place in early June when they
lost a couple to the Pirates, something which wasn’t unusual because
every National League team had been doing the same thing.
Nevertheless, Horace Stoneham, dubbed “Squire” by a profes
sional sarcastic working for one of San Francisco’s morning news
papers, decided that the Giants needed a change. So he fired Rigney,
who had brought the Giants two third place finishes and had raised
the Giants from sixth to third in one year.
Panic, cried the newspapers, but they had seen nothing yet.
Stoneham hired a former house-detective, chief scout named Tom
“Clancy” Sheehan to pilot the team for the last part of the year.
Sheehan’s duties as chief scout consisted of drinking prodigious
quantities of Vat 69, in the company of Stoneham and second guess
ing the present manager.
Rigney suggested that Sheehan second-guessed him out of a job.
If Sheehan thought he was a brilliant second-guesser, the Giant fans
taught him a few things about that art with choice queries of their
own. Such as “Why don’t you go back to being a house-dick?”
To no avail. Stoneham was convinced his buddy could drag the
Giants out of the doldrums. He didn’t, and the Giants finished a
dismal fifth.

dividualistic playboys. How could anyone be a successful manager
with such a team? he asked. Well, Rigney did all right, and Alvin
