NEIL EDWARDS, Trojan backcourt man, is a 6-2, 170 pounder who
should give the Cards plenty of trouble Friday night. He has lettered
for the last two years.


BIG JOHN WINDSOR, tough Stanford forward who has been leading
his mates of late with his determined play, is pictured above
working out for this weekend's games. The cards take on rugged
USC and league-leading UCLA in the southland Friday and Saturday
nights respectively.
