# Sensitive Rocket Scientists Battle

CAPE CANAVERAL (UPI)
Trouble with the booster rocket
forced U.S. scientists yesterday
to call another one-day postpone
ment in plans to put an astronaut
in orbit. This meant the shot
would be attempted a week from
next Wednesday, at the earliest.
Sources close to the $4OO-mil
lion Mercury man-into-space pro
gram said officials were consider
ing delaying the flight even long
er.
