# HEARINGS
## Senators, McNamara Deadlocked 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Sena
tors investigating military cen
sorship suspended public hearings
yesterday while they try to break
a deadlock with Defense Secre
tary Robert S. McNatnara over
naming individual Pentagon
speech reviewers.
Chairman John C. Stennis, D-
Miss., of a Senate armed services
subcommittee, announced the sus
pension after a second meeting
with McNamara failed to resolve
the dispute. Both the subcommit
tee and McNamara held fast to
their previous positions.
AT ISSUE is the question of
whether McNamara will identify
individual reviewers who censor
ed specific speeches by military
officers so they can be questioned
by the subcommittee about the
reasons for certain deletions or
changes.
Sen. Strom Thurmond, D-S.C.,
said after hearing McNamara that
his position was unchanged. He
said previously that individual
speech reviewers had nothing to
fear from the subcommittee, but
that they must testify so the
group can assign responsibility.
McNamara has told Defense
Department officials not to link
reviewers with speeches they
handled and reiterated his stand
at the subcommittee meeting.
HE SAID after the session that
he had supplied the subcommittee
with some 1,500 speeches and had
offered to provide explanations
for changes or deletions in speci
fic speeches.
Thurmond is confident that the
subcommittee would insist that
the censors answ'er questions or
face contempt of Congress cita
tions. McNamara told a news con
ference Monday that any con
tempt action should be directed
at him.
Both Stennis and Thurmond
held that McNamara cannot with
hold the names of the censors
without invoking a plea of execu
tive privilegeâ€”the procedure un
der which the executive branch
historically has withheld informa
tion from Congress.
