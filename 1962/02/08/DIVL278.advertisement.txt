Minds are different, too. You can’t ink them and
roil them and press them on hard-finished white
paper. But you can test them, mold them, nurture
them, shape them, stretch them, excite them.
And challenge them. At Cal Tech’s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, that’s all we do. The products of these
minds are spacecraft and instruments that will explore
the Moon and planets and communication systems to
probe outer space.
It’s a big responsibility. And it requires the finest young
scientific and engineering minds this country has to
offer. Many, many minds that work as one. Minds such
as yours, perhaps. Won't you come in and talk to us? If
you have a mind to?
