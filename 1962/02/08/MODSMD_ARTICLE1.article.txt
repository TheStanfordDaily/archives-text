# Mine Explosion One of Germany's Worst Disasters
## 
### 
SAARBHUCKEN, Germany (UPI)—A gas explosion ripped
through the tunnels of a coal mine yesterday, killing at least 109
miners and trapping T8 others behind fallen rock and earth where
they could not be reached.
The Saarland Mines Commission announced the casualties 14

hours after the blast and said
those trapped were “beyond res-

cue.”
At least 85 others were injured
by the flash fire that accompanied
the explosion, but 200 were res
cued unharmed from the fiery
death trap a quarter of a mile
underground. Authorities said 494
men were believed in the mine at
the time of the blast early yester
day morning.
THE SCENE OF the disaster,
one of the worst in German min
ing history, was the coal rich area
on the French-German border,
where one out of every nine male
Saarlanders works in the mining
industry.
Officials said they believed an
overheated engine driving a con
veyor belt may have touched off
the blast, worst in Germany since
1946, when 412 men died in a
Ruhr mine.
The explosion of methane gas
took place in the Luisenthal Mine
outside Saarbrucken in the vil
lage of Voelklingen. The mine had
taken extra safety precautions
against a gas explosion, always
a danger in the mines, and sever
al years ago won a special safety
award for its efforts.
RESCUE WORKERS, aided by
U.S. Army detachments, swarmed
into the disaster area immediately
after the blast, but it was five
hours before they reached the
first group of trapped men. By
nightfall, the rescuers still sought
to dig through the mass of earth,
timbers, coal, and stone toward
the areas where the men were
trapped.
Witnesses said truckloads of
sand and stone were brought up
to the mine entrance late yester
day. It was believed mine officials
might be considering sealing off
the three side tunnels to prevent
further danger of fire or explo
sion.
News of the disaster quickly
spread across the Saar, which is
about three-fourths the size of
Rhode Island. Flags were flown
at half-staff, radio stations broad
cast only solemn music, and state
Premier Franz Joseph Roeder
ended celebrations of the tradi
tional pre-Lenten carnival.
