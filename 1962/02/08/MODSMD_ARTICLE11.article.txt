### 
GUATEMALA CITY (UPI)
New lighting flared yesterday in
the Guatemalan coastal area
where the government announced
earlier .. smashed a pocket-sized
revolt movement which it said
was backed by Fidel Castro.
U.S.-built 826 medium bombers
were readied with rockets and
bombs at Guatemala City’s mili
tary airport to smash the rebel
band estimated at about 50 men.
GOVERNMENT statements dis
closed at least three army officers
had been killed in a series of
small-scale skirmishes with the
rebels in the Puerto Barrios coast
al area. One was said to have
been executed.
Official statements identified
the rebel leaders as a trio of
former army officers involved in
last November’s Castro-backed
revolt attempt.
The government rushed rein
forcements to Zacapa, north of
Puerto Barrios, whose surrender
was said to have been demanded
telephonlcally by the rebels who
first overran small army garri
sons in Bananera and Morales.
The government said its army
commander at Bananera, 2nd-Lt.
Zcnon Reyna, had been executed
“in cold blood” by the rebels.
A GOVERNMENT statement
said one army officer was killed
and three others were wounded
in skirmishing with the rebel
band around Entre Rios, 15 miles
from Puerto Barrios, the coun
try’s principal seaport.
The enemy force of an estimat
ed 50 men was reported to have
escaped into the mountains with
arms seized from two small gar
risons overrun in a surprise at
tack, and the proceeds from an
armed robbery against a United
Fruit Company branch office in
interior Bananera. The amount
stolen was not disclosed.
