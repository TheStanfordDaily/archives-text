## 
### 
W ASHINGTON (UP1)—President Kennedy yesterday charged
New York Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller with doing an about-face
on the President’s proposal to create a cabinet-level department
of urban affairs.
The Chief Executive told his news conference that in 1956 and

■1957, Rockefeller had suggested
such an agency, but that now “he
must have for some reason or an
other changed his point of view
on it."
Kennedy made the remarks aft
er he was asked about the gov
ernor’s speech a week ago ac
cusing the President of “political
fakery” in making it known in
advance that Robert C. Weaver, a
Negro, would be chosen to head
any such department.
REGARDING that charge, the
President suggested that Rocke
feller may have moved to the
right of Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz.
Kennedy said Rockefeller obvi
ously forgot that former Presi
dent Eisenhower had announced
that Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby
would be named head of the
Health, Education and Welfare
Department before Congress com
pleted action on the proposal to
set it up.
Kennedy said he had read of
commentator Fulton Lewis’ as
sertion that no one would get to
the right of conservative Repub
lican Senator Barry Goldwater.
“But now I’m not so sure,” the
President said with a smile.
Kennedy also was asked if he
thought groups like the John
Birch Society belonged in the Re
publican party, and whether re
tired Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker,
now a candidate for the Demo
cratic gubernatorial nomination
in Texas and a Birch Society
member, belongs in the Demo
cratic party.
THE President replied that for
mer President Dwight D. Eisen
hower had been just as vigorous
as he in denunciation of the Birch
Society. He said he was sure that
responsible Republicans felt it
had no place in the GOP.
As for Walker’s candidacy, he
commented that “everybody is
free to run, and the people will
decide, in either party.”
In response to another question,
the President said it was too ear
ly for comment on a possible po
litical foe, American Motors Pres
ident George Romney. Romney
may become Republican candi
date for governor of Michigan,
and is considered a possible GOP
presidential candidate.
On another subject, Kennedy
said recent setbacks in the Amer
ican space program were a con
tinuing result of a late start in
this field. But he said there had
been no change in the timetable
for landing a man on the moon
before 1970.
THE President also said ho will
do everything in his power to per
suade Congress to approve his
aid to education program this
year.
And he stoutly defended De
fense Secretary Robert S. Mc-
Namara for his stand in refusing
to identify Pentagon speech re
viewers who made specific dele
tions in proposed speeches by mil
itary officers.

W ASHINGTON (UP1)—President Kennedy yesterday charged
New York Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller with doing an about-face
on the President’s proposal to create a cabinet-level department
of urban affairs.
The Chief Executive told his news conference that in 1956 and

■1957, Rockefeller had suggested
such an agency, but that now “he
must have for some reason or an
other changed his point of view
on it."
Kennedy made the remarks aft
er he was asked about the gov
ernor’s speech a week ago ac
cusing the President of “political
fakery” in making it known in
advance that Robert C. Weaver, a
Negro, would be chosen to head
any such department.
REGARDING that charge, the
President suggested that Rocke
feller may have moved to the
right of Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz.
Kennedy said Rockefeller obvi
ously forgot that former Presi
dent Eisenhower had announced
that Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby
would be named head of the
Health, Education and Welfare
Department before Congress com
pleted action on the proposal to
set it up.
Kennedy said he had read of
commentator Fulton Lewis’ as
sertion that no one would get to
the right of conservative Repub
lican Senator Barry Goldwater.
“But now I’m not so sure,” the
President said with a smile.
Kennedy also was asked if he
thought groups like the John
Birch Society belonged in the Re
publican party, and whether re
tired Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker,
now a candidate for the Demo
cratic gubernatorial nomination
in Texas and a Birch Society
member, belongs in the Demo
cratic party.
THE President replied that for
mer President Dwight D. Eisen
hower had been just as vigorous
as he in denunciation of the Birch
Society. He said he was sure that
responsible Republicans felt it
had no place in the GOP.
As for Walker’s candidacy, he
commented that “everybody is
free to run, and the people will
decide, in either party.”
In response to another question,
the President said it was too ear
ly for comment on a possible po
litical foe, American Motors Pres
ident George Romney. Romney
may become Republican candi
date for governor of Michigan,
and is considered a possible GOP
presidential candidate.
