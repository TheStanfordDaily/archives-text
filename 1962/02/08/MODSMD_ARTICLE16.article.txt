NO ACTION
Editor, The Daily:
Our poor past president Bob
Siemer is still protesting that his
"independent course of action”
was thwarted by “tools of the in
terests.” An objective examina
tion of the record would reveal
no action, independent or other
wise. The obstructionists referred
to in Mr. Siemer’s letter invited
speakers (Knight, Kuchel, Chris
topher, Shell, Hatfield, Rousselot,
Nixon, etc., but Mr. Siemer
couldn’t be bothered with follow
ing up on the acceptances; we so
licited members (without beer or
other promises), when a “press
ing academic load” similar to our
own incapacited Mr. Siemer; we
watched while communications
with members were snarled by a
reluctance to delegate responsi
bilities.
As for the attendance at board
meetings (of which Bob apparent
ly kept careful statistics without
doing anything else), we who sat
through them can only wonder
that it was so high. Those who
were able to attend more than one
deserve credit for their patience
and perseverance.
We are sorry that Mr. Siemer’s
administration was so undistin
guished for it has left a great deal
for his successors to rebuild. We
are sorry, too, that he feels com
pelled to conjure up assorted “de
mons” to explain his failure. But
he must seek for his justification.

Program Vice-Pres. SAYR
SPECIAL PERCEPTION
Editor, The Daily:
Messrs. Gallistel, Gates, Light,
Allen, and Lopez must possess
special avenues of perception not
open to the ordinary individual.
Having attended SAYR elections
of two and three years ago, they
are able to say, without presently
being members of the organiza
tion and without having personal
ly attended the election in ques
tion, that Mr. Bierstedt’s accusa
tions “gave an accurate picture of
these affairs.”
We are sorry that Mr. Light (a
former officer), whose departure
from the executive board was not
altogether voluntary, chose to
join the attack. But liberals and
conservatives don’t always part
the best of friends.

SETTLE INSIDE
Editor, The Daily:
As hopefully the last in a rath
er hysterical series of letters con
cerning the SAYR’s, I would like
to give what I consider a relative
ly objective opinion on the con
troversy.
As an ex-chairman of the Stan
ford club, a “liberal” involved in
the abortive overthrow attempt
In December, and a state and na
tional officer in the YR’s, I sub
mit that my bias does not operate
in favor of Mr. Noble,
Nevertheless I feel there are a
few salient points which have
been overlooked in regard to the
recent county election. Although
I attended, I can neither deny nor
substantiate the charges made by
Mr. Bierstedt. Let me suggest,
however, that the Stanford club
was provoked into whatever ac
tions it took, first by the blind
anti-Stanford stand taken by the
opposition candidate, and, second,
by the rumors, later proven, of
outside interference in the county
culminating in the mass import

ing of students from Cal, USE, SF
State, and as far away as Fresno.
Certainly these tactics can hardly
be called “ethical.”

I am not suggesting that two
wrongs make a right, but rather
that those who are not involved
in politics and express such
amazement and disgust are not
aware of the facts of life which
are true at all levels of political
activity. Politics is, as Bismarck
said, the art of the possible. Al
though we cannot always condone
what occurs in the political arena,
we must accept it unless we are
willing to work for something
better.

SAYR's have been more than
effective in their main function,
electing Republicans to office. If
there are problems in the inter
nal workings of the club, then
let them be settled there. I have
personally sent too many notices
of meetings, called too many peo
ple, and seen too many fail to
arrive.
If those in their ivory towers
do not like the way the organiza
tion is being run, then let them
come down and work for a
change instead of expressing hor
rified condemnations and practic
ing disinvolvement.

OUT OF HAND
Editor, The Daily:
To my mind, the controversy
over the YR county elections has
gotten far out of hand. Indeed,
this was the case the moment Mr.
Bierstedt put ink to paper.
To be sure, officers of the YR’s
recruited voters for the election.
It was our duty to do so, for
every member of the SAYR’s is
entitled to vote at these elections.
We also sent out mailers explain
ing the platforms of the candi
dates and giving our endorse
ments. And as any student of
practical politics knows, ALL po
litical organizations ALWAYS
schedule victory parties to follow
an election.
As far as the fake cards are
concerned, I feel that I am in the
best position to clarify this situa
tion, since 1 am the membership
chairman of the SAYR’s, i.e., I
am in charge of the cards.
The facts are that if any mem
bership cards were issued without
the $2 membership fee being paid
into the SAYR treasury, they
were issued without authorization
from me or the SAYR Executive
Board, and since all official SAYR
membership cards are numbered
serially, this is all but a physical
impossibility. And if anyone voted
in this election on someone else’s
membership card, that is a mat
ter between himself and the legiti
mate owner of the card.

As Miss Van Scoy generously
explained, the purpose of the
SAYR’s is to enable interested
students to meet political person
alities such as the Messrs. Nixon
and Goldwater; as she pointed
out, this function is well per
formed. And the cold, hard reali
ties of the situation indicate that
if the SAYR’s had lost this elec
tion, or any of numerous similar
elections previous to this one,
there would be no SAYR’s, and
hence no such opportunities for
meeting men like Nixon, Gold
water or Joe Shell.

As far as I am concerned, this
whole affair decries nothing so
much as the shocking political
and economic naivete of the Stan

ford community. Each letter I
read by those who presume to be
offended by the proceedings at
this election is more ludicrous
than the last, and I am amazed
that the worthy coeditors of this
esteemed publication have con
descended to print so many of
them.
Michael C. Norton
Vic© President, SAYR
