# IMAGINARY IRREGULARITIES'
## Weinig Answers YR Indictment 
### DICK WEINIG President, Stanford Area Young Republicans 
As the chief engineer and oiler
of the Stanford Area Young Re
publican Unlimited Railroad, bet
ter known as The Machine, I wish
to answer the charges made by a
dissatisfied passenger and the
former brakeman, who appears
to have taken the air horn with
him when he left.

The passenger, Mr. Peter Bier
stedt, indicted the Stanford Area
Young Republicans for innumer
able alleged and perhaps imagin
ary irregularities during the re
cent, maligned county election.
A principal charge was that ru
mors of a free beer party were
used to beguile freshmen and lure
them to the election. Indeed, a
party was held after the election.
The organization took the legally
required precautions by posting
a sign requesting minors not to
imbibe and making soft drinks
available for those under age.
Presumably, the fundamental
standard was in effect.
IT IS, however, doubtful that
an affinity for alcohol was the
primary attraction for the ma
jority of the persons attending
the election, since less than 30 of
the 120 Stanford students who
had participated in the election
came to the party.
Most of the voters were simply
interested enough in the issues of
the election to spend the evening
away from their studies. This fact
was shown by the barrage of in
cisive questions which the Stan
ford people fired at both candi
dates for the office of county
chairman.
Another charge made by Mr.
Bierstedt was that James Sensen
brenner, as "delegation floor
leader,” offered to give any non
member a “fake membership
card” if he would go to the elec
tion and vote for the Stanford
endorsed candidate.
I CAN neither affirm nor deny
this charge because I frankly do
not know what Mr. Sensenbrenner
said. However, he holds no elec
tive position in the Stanford Area
Young Republicans and he was
not the “delegation floor leader”
at the recent election. Let it suf
fice to say that if Sensenbrenner
made the forenamed statement,
he did so without authorization
by myself or any other member
of the Executive Board, and for
it, he must assume complete per
sonal responsibility.
A third charge is that Richard
Noble—Stanford’s answer to Wil

liam Marcey Tweed if one is to
believe Mr. Bierstedt—spent elec
tion eve offering fake cards to
non-members. Since, in addition
to being a state officer of the
California Young Republicans
and a national officer of Young
Americans for Freedom, Mr. No
ble is a very busy law student
who would have rather been
home with “Prosser on Torts,” it
was with some difficulty that I
was able to prevail upon him to
spend a few minutes contacting
floor chairmen. The idea of his
touring Wilbur Hall dispensing
free membership cards to fresh
men is a bit ridiculous. After all.
Boss Tweed never stuffed his own
ballot boxes.

A real insight into the nature
and integrity of the Bierstedt ar
ticle is provided by the charge
against Ross Hermann—namely
that he offered to loan cards to
non-members.

ACTUALLY, Mr. Bierstedt
walked up to Mr. Hermann (who
is also not a member of the
Board), introduced himself, and
slated that he wanted to go to the
election but that he had lost his
membership card. Since Mr. Bier
stedt has been a SAYR member
since September, Hermann re
plied that he would be glad to
loan him a card.

Bierstedt pulled this statement
out of context and intimated that
Mr. Hermann loaned membership
cards to every non-member who
came by. The journalistic ethic
of such an implication is appar
ent. Moreover, I know of no objec
tion which can be raised to lend
ing a membership card to a mem
ber, even if said member is Peter
Bierstedt.

It would further appear that
the leaders of SAYR are very so
phisticated machine politicians in
deed, for according to Bierstedt,
two types of fake membership
cards were utilized; let’s call them
“fake card, type 1-A” and "fake
card, type I-B.” “Fake card, type
1-A” appears to have been a proxy
card, the lending of which should

cause no more moral indignation
than the tending of old Civ ex
aminations, I-D’s, or roommates’
automobiles. “Fake card, typo
1-B” was described by Mr. Bier
stedt as a “bona fide” member
ship card. If the forenamed gen
tleman were to think deeply for
a moment, he might be able to de
tect a contradiction in terms.

SUPPOSEDLY, these bona fide
fake membership cards were
handed out free of charge, and to
substantiate his charge, Mr. Bier
stedt cites one Biff Barker as
such a recipient. If Mr. Barker or
anyone else has not. yet paid for
his membership card, it would he
appreciated if he would bring two
dollars to Toyon 202 at his earli
est convenience.

It should be noted, however,
that Stanford membership lists |
had to be turned in to the county
organization 24 hours prior to the [
election, and that on the eve of the
election, it was impossible to re
cruit and register new voters.
Mr. Bierstedt then cited the I
statements of the former brake
man of The Machine, a former
SAYR officer, who asserted that
similar skulduggery has marked
county elections for the past three 1
years. This former officer related
how Stern Hall students received
free membership cards during the
1961 elections. This gentleman is
a former SAYR president who
may well know what he is talking
about. He was in charge of Stern
during that eletcion, and was at
that time, vice-president.
HE IS now an ex-officer, pri
marily because under his adminis
tration, no one would have taken
a free membership card, let alone
have bought one.
So, Mr. Bierstedt’s charges an
swered, the Bosses of The Ma
chine, the other engineers of the
Stanford Area Republican Unlim
ited Railroad, and I, will retire to
the corner pool hall where, be
neath the large color portrait of
the late Senator Stanford, we will
chart more nefarious plans for
the conservative conspiracy.
