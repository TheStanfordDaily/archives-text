# Uelses' Pole OK?
## 
### STEVE SNIDER 
NEW YORK (UPD 16-foot
pole vaulter John Uelses may
wind tip with an asterisk on his
record like home run hitter Roger
Maris.
There’s precedent on both sides
it figures for settling the latest
track and field controversy in
volving Uelses and his fiberglass
pole but his chances for winning
recognition are open to debate.
SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS, par
ticularly in equipment, long has
baffled officials in this rhubarb
ridden sport.
Starting blocks for sprinters
created a furor in the 1930s but
track nabobs bowed to demand
and okayed them. Later on, they
leaned the other way by outlaw
ing Bud Held’s specially designed
javelin and throwing up their
hands in horror when the Rus
sians came along with a built-up
shoe for high jumpers.
Although fiber-glass poles have
been used for nearly 10 years,
there was little fuss until Uelses
used one to put officials in a
quandry last weekend with two
16-foot toppers on consecutive
nights. Those are the only two in
vaulting history.
GLASS POLE HAS more bend,
whip and catapulting properties
than such previously used mate
rials as aluminum, steel and the
original bamboo. It also requires
a different, technique than that
used by Cornelius Warmerdam,
Bob Richards and Don Bragg,
earlier record-setters.
So now it’s a question of wheth
er fiberglass is legal or just a
gimmick requiring an asterisk on
the record.
There’s no question but what a
16-foot vault was inevitable. War
merdam was shooting for it him
self nearly 20 years ago and prob
ably would have made it if he had
any competition to push him. One
night in Chicago during World
War II he had three shots at 16-
plus and twice barely grazed the
bar, brushing it off the standards.
ODD BALL TECHNIQUES, in
cluding the monkey-on-a-stick
pole-climbing rouline by one soar
ing Japanese, have been outlaw
ed not only in pole vaulting hut
in other events.

Among (he recent ones banned
was the “Spanish style’’ javelin
throw, a whirly-bird motion some

what like the discus throw. The
javelin would travel tremendous
distances thrown that way but no
one knew where it would fly,
least of all the guy who threw it.
Records set in foot-races with
pace-setters aren’t allowed. Nor,
of course, are those with aiding
winds.
BUT IX RECENT years, broad
jumpers, vaulters and high jump
ers have been helped by faster,
all-weather runways of a special
composition. They have been ac
cepted for use in the Olympics.
No argument there. That’s prog
ress, apparently.
The fiber-glass pole, however,
really kicked up a storm. The
problem to be faced is where do
we go from here when other new
materials are discovered or put
to use.
There's precedent on both
sides. The guess here is officials
eventually will okay anything—■
provided the pole is all in one
piece.
