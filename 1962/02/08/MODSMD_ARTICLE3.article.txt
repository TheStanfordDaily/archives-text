# CHI PSI TALK
## Harris Covers Islam Religion, Black Muslims 
### 
Developments and difficulties
within the Islamic religion today
was the topic of a talk at Chi Psi
last night by Professor Christina
Phelps Harris of the Political Sci
ence Department, formerly with
the U.S. State Department.
As a speaker in the Chi Psi
“Man on the Campus" lecture
series, Mrs. Harris touched on
problems within the Muslim re
ligion all over the world. The
most interesting part of her talk
concerned the Black Muslim
movement in the United States,
which, she said, has been “terri
bly bad publicity” for the Islamic
nations of the world.
TH E ORIGINAL religious
movement which began in the
inter-war period has been cor
rupted by subversives and crim
inal elements who hope to gain
special privilege by virtue of the
religion, she said.
“One wing of the Black Mus
lims allegedly advocates the with
drawal of one or two states of the
union to form an all-Negro Mus
lim state,” Mrs. Harris said.
Their basic tenet, she added,
was superiority of the black race
over the white. The true Islamic
religion docs not distinguish be
tween black and white peoples,
she pointed out.
The subversive, violent branch
of the Black Muslims knows little
or nothing about the religion and
has been denounced by the
Mosque in Washington, D. C.
IMPRISONED MEMBERS of
the conspiracy use the religion
for illegal communication by de
manding “religious literature”
and the right to meet with their
"religious leaders,” actually heads
of various subversive Black Mus
lim groups around the country.
The “literature” is always part
ly political as well as religious,
she said.
The government must take a
firm position to prevent this mis
use of religion for special privi
lege, Mrs. Harris said. The solu
tion: have all literature and re
ligious leaders made available to
these prison inmates emanate
from the Mosque of the true
church in Washington.
THERE ARE “quite a few
Black Muslims in the country,”
she said, although the total is un
known since the organization is
secret.
Turning to the Near East, Mrs.
Harris said a change in Muslim
law is badly needed. This lengthy
task must bo undertaken by qual
ified doctors of religin.
“Although Islam has every
shade of liberalism, small groups
of conservatives now attempt to
have the people live as Muham
mad did in the 7th century.”
