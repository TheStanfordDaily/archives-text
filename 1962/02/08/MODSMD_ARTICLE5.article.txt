# KZSU Offers Fun and Games Plus Activity Credit to Anyone
## 
### BILL SMITH 
"I’m a transfer student.”
“Oh, really, from where?”
“KZSU.”
You hear a sigh of relief. You
see, everybody else wonders what
KZSU is, and the thought that
anyone could leave it and still
have credits enough to transfer
to Stanford is surprising.
Most of the time KZSU is lo
cated in the basement of Mem
Aud. but after a Kzoo party, it
may be found anywhere from
Harley’s joint to the drunk tank
of the Wabash, Minnesota, City
Jail.
KZSU IS OWNED by the Uni
versity, and broadcasts, God will
ing, at 880 kilocycles on the aver
age AM dial. Students operate the
whole thing. KZSU is the only
all student activity not under
ASSU jurisdiction, but our qual

ity is similar to that of the Legis
lature and olher ASSU toys.
KZSU Chief Engineer, Doug
Petersen (CQ), a marginally re
liable source, reported that the
following living groups have
KZSU transmitters; Lagunita
Court, Toyon, Wilbur, the front
houses in Stern, Union. Flo Mo,
Guthrie, ATO, DKE, Theta Xi,
Sigma Chi and Branner. although
there has been some trouble
about house mothers turning us
off, bad influence or something.
KZSU offers a greater variety
of activities and opportunities
than any other campus organiza
tion, or so says its information
brochure. However, the point is
open to philosophic debate and
lends itself to this type of intel
lectual discussion more readily
than does the question of Stan
ford’s Carmine DeSapio, Dick No
ble.
KZSU OFFERS opportunities
in announcing, producing, acting,
public relations, advertising, en
gineering, programming, writing,
music, production of RF (radio
frequency, necessary to broad
cast) and numerous ther activi
ties.
“The most hang-loose organiza
tion on a very hang-loose cam
pus.” That’s the way KZSU was
described just before it was kick
ed off campus. Chappie wasn’t
first by a long way. Anything
that is done on campus was first
done at KZSU. or to KZSU, de
pending on how one looks at it.
Speech and Drama Department,
KZSU’s legal owner and nemesis,
keeps a light but firm hand on
KZSU’s cut-off switches. Care is
taken when Speech and Drama
are around. Oh, other times too.

The KZSU business department
is headed by Pierre Joujon-Roche
ICQ) and offers opportunities in
all phases of advertsing. KZSU
offers 15 per rent commission as
compared to the Daily’s miserly
It) per cent.
THE ENGINEERING depart
ment at KZSU is concerned with
production of audio and RF
(sometimes radio frequency,
other times . . . ) and is sur
passed by no other group in this
field.
If you don’t mind associating
with anyone, come down to
KZSU. There is fun and a little
work available, for activity credit
even, to any interested students.

DOUG PETERSEN, Chief Engineer at KZSU, "the most hang-loose organization on a very hang-loose
compos", transfers words of wisdom from the Mem Aud basement studio to the various living
groups on campus who have transmitters.
"I’m a transfer student.”
“Oh, really, from where?”
“KZSU.”
You hear a sigh of relief. You
see, everybody else wonders what
KZSU is, and the thought that
anyone could leave it and still
have credits enough to transfer
to Stanford is surprising.
Most of the time KZSU is lo
cated in the basement of Mem
Aud. but after a Kzoo party, it
may be found anywhere from
Harley’s joint to the drunk tank
of the Wabash, Minnesota, City
Jail.
KZSU IS OWNED by the Uni
versity, and broadcasts, God will
ing, at 880 kilocycles on the aver
age AM dial. Students operate the
whole thing. KZSU is the only
all student activity not under
ASSU jurisdiction, but our qual

ity is similar to that of the Legis
lature and olher ASSU toys.
KZSU Chief Engineer, Doug
Petersen (CQ), a marginally re
liable source, reported that the
following living groups have
KZSU transmitters; Lagunita
Court, Toyon, Wilbur, the front
houses in Stern, Union. Flo Mo,
Guthrie, ATO, DKE, Theta Xi,
Sigma Chi and Branner. although
there has been some trouble
about house mothers turning us
off, bad influence or something.
KZSU offers a greater variety
of activities and opportunities
than any other campus organiza
tion, or so says its information
brochure. However, the point is
open to philosophic debate and
lends itself to this type of intel
lectual discussion more readily
than does the question of Stan
ford’s Carmine DeSapio, Dick No
ble.
KZSU OFFERS opportunities
in announcing, producing, acting,
public relations, advertising, en
gineering, programming, writing,
music, production of RF (radio
frequency, necessary to broad
cast) and numerous ther activi
ties.
