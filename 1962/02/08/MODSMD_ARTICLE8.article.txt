# OAS Explodes Bombs in Paris

PARIS (UPl)—The outlawed
Secret Army Organization (OAS)
bombed the apartment building of
noted author and French Culture
Minister Andrew Malraux yester
day during a barrage of attacks
that rocked Paris while President
Charles de Gaulle and his cabinet
debated new anti-terrorist meas
ures.
A total of 10 bombs exploded
in the city, injuring seven per
sons, as terrorist bombers struck
in defiance of a heavy guard
mounted by 30,000 armed troops
and police equipped with tanks.
One of the bombs exploded
three blocks from De Gaulle’s
presidential palace. The bomb
hurled into Malraux’s suburban
residence missed the writer and
cabinet minister but wounded a
woman and a little girl, Delphic
Renard, playing with her doll in
a ground-floor apartment. Doc
tors said the girl, 4. may lose an
eye.
It was the first known time that
terrorist bombers had struck at
the residence of a De Gaulle gov
ernment minister. Last month a
bomb exploded in the courtyard
of the Foreign Ministry and De
Gaulle escaped assassination last
autumn when a bomb exploded
near his car on a highway in
eastern France.
