We’re looking forward to meeting you
We’ll be on the campus on the dates listed below, ready to give
engineering and science seniors information on space-age careers
in a dynamic industry. If you are looking for a company offering
assignments on programs of unique interest and career potential,
you’ll be interested in the advantages Boeing can offer you.
Boeing, for instance, is a major contractor on such advanced
programs as the Saturn S-IB advanced first stage booster, the
Dyna-Soar manned space glider, the solid-fuel Minuteman ICBM,
and the Bomarc defense missile system. Boeing is also the
world’s foremost designer and builder of multijet aircraft, includ
ing the eight-jet B-52H missile bomber, the KC-135 tanker
transport, the C-135 cargo-jet, and the famous Boeing 707, 720
and 727 jetliners. In addition, Boeing’s Verlol Division is one
of America’s leading builders of helicopters.
Research projects at Boeing are under way in such advanced
fields as celestial mechanics, solid state physics, nuclear and
plasma physics, flight sciences, space flight and propulsion.
Expanding Boeing programs offer exceptional opportunities to
holders of 8.5., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in aeronautical, mechani
cal, civil, electrical-electronic and industrial engineering, and in
engineering mechanics, engineering physics as well as in mathe
matics and physics. At Boeing you’ll work in a small group where
individual ability and initiative get plenty of visibility. You’ll
enjoy many other advantages, including an opportunity to take
graduate studies at company expense to help you get ahead faster.
Drop in to your Placement Office and arrange for an interview.
We’re looking forward to meeting you!
