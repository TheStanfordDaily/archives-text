Technical representatives
of the MITRE Corporation
will be conducting interviews
on campus
February 13, 1962
MITRE now has openings for talented men who want to
work in the challenging new field of system engineering ... a
set of skills defined in only the most recent reference books.
With MITRE, system engineering embraces such electronic
command and control systems as the NORAD Intelligence
Function and the manned bomber defense, SAGE.
The work is vital. Time for decision in aerospace opera
tions has been compressed intolerably. Today’s military
leaders must have help in commanding forces of awesome
strength. They need great quantities of information elec
tronically transmitted, processed and displayed. This is the
challenge of command and control . . . the work of the men at
MITRE.
Formed under the sponsorship of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, MITRE is a growing engineering
research corporation with 1,600 employees, over 600 of which
comprise the technical staff. It serves as technical advisor to
the U. S. Air Force and other government agencies and en
gages in system design, conceptual planning, evaluation of
electronic systems and research development.
Appointments will be made principally in the Suburban
Boston area. Openings are also available at facilities in
Washington, D. C. and Colorado Springs, Colo. Brochures
describing the activities of The MITRE Corporation are
available on request at the placement office.
