# WEST IRIAN TALK
## Indonesian Puts Blame On Dutch 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
Indonesian Consul Daroman
last night blamed his country’s
resort to force in West Irian on
Dutch refusal to negotiate and
said Indonesia has not accepted
recent offers from the Nether
lands to talk because “negotia
tions may be used to gain time to
carry out its insidious machina
tions.”
Indonesia will agree to negoti
ation only if convinced the Neth
erlands will participate in good
faith, with real intentions to
transfer the West Irian territory,
he said.
DAROMAN SAID West Irian
belongs to Indonesia because in
1919 the Dutch agreed to transfer
the sovereignly of what used to
lie the Netherlands East Indies,
including West Irian, to the Re
public of the United States of In
donesia as an independent and
sovereign state.
He said the Netherlands wanted
to keep administering New
Guinea to maintain Dutch econ
omic interests in Indonesia and
agreed to determine its future
status by negotiations within a
year.
Indonesians agreed, believing it
only a matter of political expedi
ence to get the Netherlands to
consent to Indonesian independ
ence, Daroman claimed. He said
the action Was to appease inter
ests opposed to losing the rich
colony.
SINCE THEN the Netherlands
has rejected negotiations while
Indonesia repeatedly asked for
settlement and finally concluded
force was the only way.
Indonesia has refused to bring
the issue to an international
court of justice because it is “not
a legal problem but a political
one," Daroman said. “Colonialism
is an inhuman disease which can’t
be justified by legal moans.”
