# Argentina Breaks Relations With Cuba
## 
### 
BUENOS AIRES UFI Argen
tina has broken diplomatic rela
tions with Cuba, the Foreign Min
istry announced yesterday.
The Foreign Office immediately
handed Cuban diplomats assigned
to the embassy here their pass
ports.
The Foreign Ministry said Ar

gentina’s Charge d’Affairs in Ha
vana, Hector Villanueva, has been
instructed to “invite” aged and
ailing Manuel Cardinal Arteaga to
accompany him to Buenos Aires
when Villaneuva departs. Villa
neuva was told to come home
within 48 hours.

ARTEGA is currently a “guest”
in the embassy with 40 persons
who have been given political
asylum there.
The ministry told Villaneuva
that the other 40 are to remain
for the next 48 hours in the em
bassy under the Argentine flag.
Then the Latin American country
which agrees to assume charge
of Argentine affairs will take
charge of them.
There was no immediate indi
cation which of the six Latin na
tions with embassies here might
take over Argentine interests.
The break came exactly a week
after an ultimatum served on the
government by the armed forces
for a reversal of Argentina’s
“hand’s-off” policy toward Cuba
as demonstrated at the Punta del
Este conference.
It coincided with the return to
Buenos Aires from Havana of Ar
gentine Ambassador Julio Amoe
do.
ARGENTINA is the 14th hemi
sphere country to break relations
with Cuba. The rupture leaves
six Latin American nations with
functioning embassies in Havana.
The break was understood to be
one of a series of demands on the
government by the armed forces,
agreed to by the Arturo Frondizi
regime in a secret agreement.
Other military demands in the
foreign policy field included, in
addition to a break, the discharge
of Foreign Minister Miguel Angel
Carcano and the aides held re
sponsible for Argentina’s attitude
at Punta del Este. Although Ar
gentina signed the final act of the
conference, declaring the Fidel
Castro regime “incompatible”
with the inter-American system,
Carcano refused to go along with
a 1-6 majority vote arbitrary
ousting Cuba frotn the American
family of nations.
THE SECRET agreement was
reported to have included a 30-
day time limit for the government
break with Cuba. However, action
of the armed forces chiefs in boy
cotting an official reception for
visiting ex-King Leopold 111 of
Belgium earlier this week was
believed to have spurred President
Frondizi to early action.
