# Young Republicans Should Clean House
## 
### 
In “Tim Enemy Within,” an oxer]lent book on the investigation
of labor union racketeering, Robert Kennedy relates the following
story.
The McClellan Committee, for which Kennedy was chief coun
sel, had finished its investigations and was about to disband. Some
of the Republican members of the Committee were unhappy that
Walter Reuther, head of the United Auto Workers, had not been
the subject of more intensive investigation. It was Kennedy’s con
tention that Reuther was “clean” and not the legitimate subject of
a probe.
The day after the Committee had finished, Arizona Republican
Barry Goldwater publicly accused Kennedy of having “run out” on
Reuther. Kennedy says he called Goldwater and asked if there
were anything more he could do on the subject.
“No, no,” said Goldwater, “I want to get back to Arizona now.
I don’t want any more hearings.”
“Then why did you say it?” Kennedy asked.
“That’s politics,” said Goldwater.
Of course this conception of “politics” is not new with Barry
Goldwater. Nor is its practice necessarily inimical to statesmanship.
In fact Franklin D. Roosevelt and even Abraham Lincoln were, to
an extent, the master politicians of their day.
But it strikes us that politics—and the practice thereof—often
gets out of hand when compared with the reason for its intensive
use. Such is the case with the Stanford Area (and perhaps the Cali
fornia) Young Republicans, over whom a feud has been raging in
these pages for the past week.
The Noble-Weinig-Ilermann contingent in the controversy
seems, in our opinion, to have come up with the least to commend
itself, but somehow the charges, rebuttals and counter-rebuttals
that have been thrown back and forth seem less important than
something upon which all the parties agree: the way in which
politics is played by the Young Republicans.
Everybody agrees that the YR’s play hard and for keeps. And
everybody agrees that either one of the factions (the one to which
the speaker doesn’t belong) or (in rare moments of candidness)
both of them play dirty. Phony identification cards (of two types),
free beer-parties and busloads of non-YR’s rung in for elections
are some of the charges. The whole thing gets even more exciting
when the names of members of the senior Republican party arc
dropped. (“The Fresno chapter brought in ringers, probably with
Dick Nixon’s money,” for instance.)
The reaction to all these charges is three-fold:
1. The group that would like to play clean is forced into dirty
tactics to stay alive. (“You’ve got to fight fire with fire.”)
2. The YR’s should be cleaned up (and if naming names of the
violators of fair play is necessary, so bo it).
3. That’s politics. (Hi there, Barry.)
While we recognize that the first approach is sometimes neces
sary, we dislike it and we would submit that the control of a
student political organization (even one that is state-wide) is not
a sufficient stake to justify the type of events that have occurred.
We applaud those who use the second approach and if ever
again we are given a chance to help them attain their goal, we will
do so.
The third approach bothers us the most. It was expressed well
in two letters in yesterday’s Daily. This type usually expresses
amazement that anyone could be concerned with dirty politics
(since to this mentality politics, by definition, is dirty). Statements
such as “naive,” “ivory tower,” and, of course, “that’s politics” are
standard equipment for this group.
Perhaps this attitude should be expected of those who devote
their lives to politics (or the reporting of it) and perhaps tire ex
ample set by its more mature practitioners cannot help but set a
bad example for groups such as the YR’s. But if the game is
played this roughly when the prize is nothing higher than an un
important symbol, what will happen when these same YR’s are
out of school and in politics for real?
And if occasional amazement by outsiders at just how dirty
politics is amazes the YR’s now, what will happen when they are
important in government and some segments of the public start
complaining about how its money is being spent, etc.?
We hope that the YR’s see fit to clean house and that a little
more idealism and attention to ethics mark their future dealings.

amazement that anyone could be concerned with dirty politics

standard equipment for this group.

played this roughly when the prize is nothing higher than an un

In “Tim Enemy Within,” an oxer]lent book on the investigation
of labor union racketeering, Robert Kennedy relates the following
story.
The McClellan Committee, for which Kennedy was chief coun
sel, had finished its investigations and was about to disband. Some
of the Republican members of the Committee were unhappy that
Walter Reuther, head of the United Auto Workers, had not been
the subject of more intensive investigation. It was Kennedy’s con
tention that Reuther was “clean” and not the legitimate subject of
a probe.
The day after the Committee had finished, Arizona Republican
Barry Goldwater publicly accused Kennedy of having “run out” on
Reuther. Kennedy says he called Goldwater and asked if there
were anything more he could do on the subject.
“No, no,” said Goldwater, “I want to get back to Arizona now.
I don’t want any more hearings.”
“Then why did you say it?” Kennedy asked.
“That’s politics,” said Goldwater.
Of course this conception of “politics” is not new with Barry
Goldwater. Nor is its practice necessarily inimical to statesmanship.
In fact Franklin D. Roosevelt and even Abraham Lincoln were, to
an extent, the master politicians of their day.
But it strikes us that politics—and the practice thereof—often
gets out of hand when compared with the reason for its intensive
use. Such is the case with the Stanford Area (and perhaps the Cali
fornia) Young Republicans, over whom a feud has been raging in
these pages for the past week.
The Noble-Weinig-Ilermann contingent in the controversy
seems, in our opinion, to have come up with the least to commend
itself, but somehow the charges, rebuttals and counter-rebuttals
that have been thrown back and forth seem less important than
something upon which all the parties agree: the way in which
politics is played by the Young Republicans.
Everybody agrees that the YR’s play hard and for keeps. And
everybody agrees that either one of the factions (the one to which
the speaker doesn’t belong) or (in rare moments of candidness)
both of them play dirty. Phony identification cards (of two types),
free beer-parties and busloads of non-YR’s rung in for elections
are some of the charges. The whole thing gets even more exciting
when the names of members of the senior Republican party arc
dropped. (“The Fresno chapter brought in ringers, probably with
Dick Nixon’s money,” for instance.)
The reaction to all these charges is three-fold:
1. The group that would like to play clean is forced into dirty
tactics to stay alive. (“You’ve got to fight fire with fire.”)
2. The YR’s should be cleaned up (and if naming names of the
violators of fair play is necessary, so bo it).
3. That’s politics. (Hi there, Barry.)
While we recognize that the first approach is sometimes neces
sary, we dislike it and we would submit that the control of a
student political organization (even one that is state-wide) is not

seems, in our opinion, to have come up with the least to commend
itself, but somehow the charges, rebuttals and counter-rebuttals
that have been thrown back and forth seem less important than
something upon which all the parties agree: the way in which
politics is played by the Young Republicans.
Everybody agrees that the YR’s play hard and for keeps. And
everybody agrees that either one of the factions (the one to which
the speaker doesn’t belong) or (in rare moments of candidness)
both of them play dirty. Phony identification cards (of two types),
free beer-parties and busloads of non-YR’s rung in for elections
are some of the charges. The whole thing gets even more exciting
when the names of members of the senior Republican party arc
dropped. (“The Fresno chapter brought in ringers, probably with
Dick Nixon’s money,” for instance.)
The reaction to all these charges is three-fold:
1. The group that would like to play clean is forced into dirty
tactics to stay alive. (“You’ve got to fight fire with fire.”)
2. The YR’s should be cleaned up (and if naming names of the
violators of fair play is necessary, so bo it).
3. That’s politics. (Hi there, Barry.)
While we recognize that the first approach is sometimes neces
sary, we dislike it and we would submit that the control of a
student political organization (even one that is state-wide) is not
a sufficient stake to justify the type of events that have occurred.
We applaud those who use the second approach and if ever
again we are given a chance to help them attain their goal, we will
do so.
The third approach bothers us the most. It was expressed well
in two letters in yesterday’s Daily. This type usually expresses
amazement that anyone could be concerned with dirty politics
(since to this mentality politics, by definition, is dirty). Statements
such as “naive,” “ivory tower,” and, of course, “that’s politics” are
standard equipment for this group.
Perhaps this attitude should be expected of those who devote
their lives to politics (or the reporting of it) and perhaps tire ex
ample set by its more mature practitioners cannot help but set a
bad example for groups such as the YR’s. But if the game is
played this roughly when the prize is nothing higher than an un
important symbol, what will happen when these same YR’s are
out of school and in politics for real?
And if occasional amazement by outsiders at just how dirty
politics is amazes the YR’s now, what will happen when they are
important in government and some segments of the public start
complaining about how its money is being spent, etc.?
We hope that the YR’s see fit to clean house and that a little
more idealism and attention to ethics mark their future dealings.
In “Tim Enemy Within,” an oxer]lent book on the investigation
of labor union racketeering, Robert Kennedy relates the following
story.
The McClellan Committee, for which Kennedy was chief coun
sel, had finished its investigations and was about to disband. Some
of the Republican members of the Committee were unhappy that
Walter Reuther, head of the United Auto Workers, had not been
the subject of more intensive investigation. It was Kennedy’s con
tention that Reuther was “clean” and not the legitimate subject of
a probe.
The day after the Committee had finished, Arizona Republican
Barry Goldwater publicly accused Kennedy of having “run out” on
Reuther. Kennedy says he called Goldwater and asked if there
were anything more he could do on the subject.
“No, no,” said Goldwater, “I want to get back to Arizona now.
I don’t want any more hearings.”
“Then why did you say it?” Kennedy asked.
“That’s politics,” said Goldwater.
Of course this conception of “politics” is not new with Barry
Goldwater. Nor is its practice necessarily inimical to statesmanship.
In fact Franklin D. Roosevelt and even Abraham Lincoln were, to
an extent, the master politicians of their day.
But it strikes us that politics—and the practice thereof—often
gets out of hand when compared with the reason for its intensive
use. Such is the case with the Stanford Area (and perhaps the Cali
fornia) Young Republicans, over whom a feud has been raging in
these pages for the past week.
