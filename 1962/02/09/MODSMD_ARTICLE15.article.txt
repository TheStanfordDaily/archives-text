INCIDENTALLY
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Weinig’s description of the
SAYR “victory party” was most
interesting, especially since I was
present at the celebration.
I saw no sign “requesting mi
nors not to imbibe,” nor did I see
any soft drinks.
Furthermore, the attendance at
the free beer party was probably
decreased because it did not be
gin until after midnight, although
those students I was with had
been told the election would end
at 9:30 p.m.
Incidentally, I received “fake
card, typo 1-A,” although not
from its owner.

CONNECTIONS
Editor, The Daily:
The present SAYR administra
tion has (regrettably, between mo
ments of sarcasm) not specifical
ly denied that certain of the ir
regularities described by Mr. Bier
stedt occurred. However, they
deny having authorized or con
doned such activities. In particu
lar, they deny that the doings of
one SAYR member, who was spe
cifically identified by several wit
nesses, were authorized.
Now, although this SAYR mem
ber holds no elective office, he has
served and continues to serve as
the editor of the SAYR newslet
ter, and in effect speaks for the
organization in his writings. He
was also quite active in the mem
bership recruiting done in the
Wilbur houses this year. The
reader may judge from this what
connections he has with the
SAYR administration.

CONSTRUCTIVE FUTURE
Editor, The Daily:
I could spend time commending
Kris Mullick for her balanced let
ter, while pointing out that many
successful politicians draw the
line closer to integrity. I could
chuckle at Mr. Turk’s resort to
personal abuse because he could
deny nothing. (Actually, I was
approached for a higher office
when I resigned in favor of the
much more valuable work the HR
does.) But this is not the point.
SAYR could be an outstanding
organization. Many of us left in
disgust because we saw no worth
in a personal political machine
dealing in petty county politics.
YR’s could provide students with
an educational program, discuss
ing national issues and drawing
on top speakers. At present, the
YR’s serve some useful functions:
its work in national elections is
outstanding and enables students
to participate in major elections;
it cooperates with the Political
Union in bringing speakers to
campus: it holds receptions for
major politicians for its members.
This is only a start; and a full
program of debate, serious re
search on national problems, etc.
would make the SAYR’s a leader
in political education. The chief

obstacles to such enlightened
growth seem to be a preoccupa
tion with local politics and the oh
so-subtle ambitions of a few in
dividuals.
I hope these past few clays will
lead to serious thought about why
YR’s exist. What is their func
tion? What should it be? Perhaps
a more constructive future will
result.

THE BEST POLICY
Editor, The Daily:
The efforts of some to divert
attention from the issues raised
in Mr. Bierstedt’s article by bring
ing forth attacks upon myself and
my term in office are so obvious
ly designed as to give the impres
sion of a lot of hand waving. The
use of Mr. Cullen’s pen in yester
day morning’s barrage is particu
larly interesting, for what he has
to say must necessarily be hear
say since he was never around
either to perform his duties or to
observe what was going on.
Merely as an illustration, one
might point out that it was ex-
Governor Goodwin Knight’s ill
ness alone that prevented his ap
pearance under SAYR auspices,
all arrangements having been
completed with scarce little help
from the members of the present
administration. Secondly the rec
ord shows that Mr. Nixon was in
vited by myself personally in the
face of his deliberate omission
from the original invitations.
However, all of the above and
much of what has been said in
defense of machine actions has
been totally irrelevant to the
charges made in Mr. Bierstedt’s
article. Mr. Bierstedt charged that
the actions which he and his in
formants observed were not ac
ceptable to himself or to those to
whom he spoke. The plea of po
litical necessity vs. political naive
te has very little bearing when
the membership at large is ready
to condemn the actions taken on
moral grounds.

The probleyi is in the willing
ness of the officers to do ANY
THING to gain, increase, or pre
serve their own power or political

advantage. It is a question of
whether SAYR’s are organized to
work for the Republican Party
and to provide a center for politi
cal education, or whether the pur
pose has been changed to the
maintenance of an instrument of
power,
I, for one, hope that this contro
versy will now come to an end.
It is clear that the present SAYR
administration intends to persist
in an attitude and type of activity
which is repulsive to a large per
centage of the membership. It has
been further shown that their ac
tivities have driven Republicans
away from the support of their
own party. This past week has in
dicated that honesty may still be
the best policy despite the self
serving arguments of a few

CONSPICUOUS
Editor, The Daily:
Several of the statements made
by Mr. Weinig in yesterday’s
Daily are, at the least, mislead
ing. The statements I am refer
ring to are “the organization took
the legally required precautions
by posting a sign requesting mi
nor not to imbibe and making soft
drinks available,” and “it is . . ,
doubtful that an affinity for alco
hol was the primary attraction
for the majority of the persons
attending the election, since less
than 30 of the 120 Stanford stu
dents . . . came to the party.”
I was at the party, and if the
sign was posted it must have been
posted in some conspicuous place
like under the piano. Nor did I
see any sign of the soft drinks
that were, according to Mr. Wei
nig, made “available.” Further
more, no I.D.’s were requested
for being served beer, anti none
were presented.
Enough has been said about the
fake membership cards. I would
like to add that since I have had
no opportunity to examine the
SAYR constitution I cannot tell
whether or not the proceedings
were legal. I suspect they were
not, but at any rate they certain
ly were unethical and morally
wrong.

CONSPICUOUS
Editor, The Daily:
Several of the statements made
by Mr. Weinig in yesterday’s
Daily are, at the least, mislead
ing. The statements I am refer
ring to are “the organization took
the legally required precautions
by posting a sign requesting mi
nor not to imbibe and making soft
drinks available,” and “it is . . ,
doubtful that an affinity for alco
hol was the primary attraction
for the majority of the persons
attending the election, since less
than 30 of the 120 Stanford stu
dents . . . came to the party.”
I was at the party, and if the
sign was posted it must have been
posted in some conspicuous place
like under the piano. Nor did I
see any sign of the soft drinks
that were, according to Mr. Wei
nig, made “available.” Further
more, no I.D.’s were requested
for being served beer, anti none
were presented.
Enough has been said about the
fake membership cards. I would
like to add that since I have had
no opportunity to examine the
SAYR constitution I cannot tell
whether or not the proceedings
were legal. I suspect they were
not, but at any rate they certain
ly were unethical and morally
wrong.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Weinig’s description of the
SAYR “victory party” was most
interesting, especially since I was
present at the celebration.
I saw no sign “requesting mi
nors not to imbibe,” nor did I see
any soft drinks.
Furthermore, the attendance at
the free beer party was probably
decreased because it did not be
gin until after midnight, although
those students I was with had
been told the election would end
at 9:30 p.m.
Incidentally, I received “fake
card, typo 1-A,” although not
from its owner.

The present SAYR administra
tion has (regrettably, between mo
ments of sarcasm) not specifical
ly denied that certain of the ir
regularities described by Mr. Bier
stedt occurred. However, they
deny having authorized or con
doned such activities. In particu
lar, they deny that the doings of
one SAYR member, who was spe
cifically identified by several wit
nesses, were authorized.
Now, although this SAYR mem
ber holds no elective office, he has
served and continues to serve as
the editor of the SAYR newslet
ter, and in effect speaks for the
organization in his writings. He
was also quite active in the mem
bership recruiting done in the
Wilbur houses this year. The
reader may judge from this what
connections he has with the
SAYR administration.

CONSTRUCTIVE FUTURE
Editor, The Daily:
I could spend time commending
Kris Mullick for her balanced let
ter, while pointing out that many
successful politicians draw the
line closer to integrity. I could
chuckle at Mr. Turk’s resort to
personal abuse because he could
deny nothing. (Actually, I was
approached for a higher office
when I resigned in favor of the
much more valuable work the HR
does.) But this is not the point.
SAYR could be an outstanding
organization. Many of us left in
disgust because we saw no worth
in a personal political machine
dealing in petty county politics.
YR’s could provide students with
an educational program, discuss
ing national issues and drawing
on top speakers. At present, the
YR’s serve some useful functions:
its work in national elections is
outstanding and enables students
to participate in major elections;
it cooperates with the Political
Union in bringing speakers to
campus: it holds receptions for
major politicians for its members.
This is only a start; and a full
program of debate, serious re
search on national problems, etc.
would make the SAYR’s a leader
in political education. The chief

obstacles to such enlightened
growth seem to be a preoccupa
tion with local politics and the oh
so-subtle ambitions of a few in
dividuals.
I hope these past few clays will
lead to serious thought about why
YR’s exist. What is their func
tion? What should it be? Perhaps
a more constructive future will
result.

THE BEST POLICY
Editor, The Daily:
The efforts of some to divert
attention from the issues raised
in Mr. Bierstedt’s article by bring
ing forth attacks upon myself and
my term in office are so obvious
ly designed as to give the impres
sion of a lot of hand waving. The
use of Mr. Cullen’s pen in yester
day morning’s barrage is particu
larly interesting, for what he has
to say must necessarily be hear
say since he was never around
either to perform his duties or to
observe what was going on.
Merely as an illustration, one
might point out that it was ex-
Governor Goodwin Knight’s ill
ness alone that prevented his ap
pearance under SAYR auspices,
all arrangements having been
completed with scarce little help
from the members of the present
administration. Secondly the rec
ord shows that Mr. Nixon was in
vited by myself personally in the
face of his deliberate omission
from the original invitations.
However, all of the above and
much of what has been said in
defense of machine actions has
been totally irrelevant to the
charges made in Mr. Bierstedt’s
article. Mr. Bierstedt charged that
the actions which he and his in
formants observed were not ac
ceptable to himself or to those to
whom he spoke. The plea of po
litical necessity vs. political naive
te has very little bearing when
the membership at large is ready
to condemn the actions taken on
moral grounds.

The probleyi is in the willing
ness of the officers to do ANY
THING to gain, increase, or pre
serve their own power or political

advantage. It is a question of
whether SAYR’s are organized to
work for the Republican Party
and to provide a center for politi
cal education, or whether the pur
pose has been changed to the
maintenance of an instrument of
power,
I, for one, hope that this contro

use of Mr. Cullen’s pen in yester
day morning’s barrage is particu

to say must necessarily be hear
say since he was never around
either to perform his duties or to
observe what was going on.
Merely as an illustration, one
might point out that it was ex-
Governor Goodwin Knight’s ill
ness alone that prevented his ap
pearance under SAYR auspices,
all arrangements having been
completed with scarce little help
from the members of the present
administration. Secondly the rec
ord shows that Mr. Nixon was in
vited by myself personally in the
face of his deliberate omission
from the original invitations.
However, all of the above and
much of what has been said in
defense of machine actions has
been totally irrelevant to the
charges made in Mr. Bierstedt’s
article. Mr. Bierstedt charged that
the actions which he and his in
formants observed were not ac
ceptable to himself or to those to
whom he spoke. The plea of po
litical necessity vs. political naive

the membership at large is ready
to condemn the actions taken on
moral grounds.

The probleyi is in the willing

THING to gain, increase, or pre

advantage. It is a question of

CONSPICUOUS
Editor, The Daily:
Several of the statements made
by Mr. Weinig in yesterday’s
Daily are, at the least, mislead
ing. The statements I am refer
ring to are “the organization took
the legally required precautions
by posting a sign requesting mi
nor not to imbibe and making soft
drinks available,” and “it is . . ,
doubtful that an affinity for alco
hol was the primary attraction
for the majority of the persons
attending the election, since less
than 30 of the 120 Stanford stu
dents . . . came to the party.”
I was at the party, and if the
sign was posted it must have been
posted in some conspicuous place
like under the piano. Nor did I
see any sign of the soft drinks
that were, according to Mr. Wei
nig, made “available.” Further
more, no I.D.’s were requested
for being served beer, anti none
were presented.
Enough has been said about the
fake membership cards. I would
like to add that since I have had
no opportunity to examine the
SAYR constitution I cannot tell
whether or not the proceedings
were legal. I suspect they were
not, but at any rate they certain
ly were unethical and morally
wrong.

Mr. Weinig’s description of the
SAYR “victory party” was most
interesting, especially since I was
present at the celebration.
I saw no sign “requesting mi
nors not to imbibe,” nor did I see
any soft drinks.
Furthermore, the attendance at
the free beer party was probably
decreased because it did not be
gin until after midnight, although
those students I was with had
been told the election would end
at 9:30 p.m.
Incidentally, I received “fake
card, typo 1-A,” although not
from its owner.

The present SAYR administra
tion has (regrettably, between mo
ments of sarcasm) not specifical
ly denied that certain of the ir
regularities described by Mr. Bier
stedt occurred. However, they
deny having authorized or con
doned such activities. In particu
lar, they deny that the doings of
one SAYR member, who was spe
cifically identified by several wit
nesses, were authorized.
Now, although this SAYR mem
ber holds no elective office, he has
served and continues to serve as
the editor of the SAYR newslet
ter, and in effect speaks for the
organization in his writings. He
was also quite active in the mem
bership recruiting done in the
Wilbur houses this year. The
reader may judge from this what
connections he has with the
SAYR administration.

Editor, The Daily:
I could spend time commending
Kris Mullick for her balanced let
ter, while pointing out that many
successful politicians draw the
line closer to integrity. I could
chuckle at Mr. Turk’s resort to
personal abuse because he could
deny nothing. (Actually, I was
approached for a higher office
when I resigned in favor of the
much more valuable work the HR
does.) But this is not the point.
SAYR could be an outstanding
organization. Many of us left in
disgust because we saw no worth
in a personal political machine
dealing in petty county politics.
YR’s could provide students with
an educational program, discuss
ing national issues and drawing
on top speakers. At present, the
YR’s serve some useful functions:
its work in national elections is
outstanding and enables students
to participate in major elections;
it cooperates with the Political
Union in bringing speakers to
campus: it holds receptions for
major politicians for its members.
This is only a start; and a full
program of debate, serious re
search on national problems, etc.
would make the SAYR’s a leader
in political education. The chief

obstacles to such enlightened
growth seem to be a preoccupa
tion with local politics and the oh
so-subtle ambitions of a few in
dividuals.
I hope these past few clays will
lead to serious thought about why
YR’s exist. What is their func
tion? What should it be? Perhaps
a more constructive future will
result.

line closer to integrity. I could
chuckle at Mr. Turk’s resort to
personal abuse because he could
deny nothing. (Actually, I was
approached for a higher office
when I resigned in favor of the
much more valuable work the HR
does.) But this is not the point.
SAYR could be an outstanding
organization. Many of us left in
disgust because we saw no worth
in a personal political machine
dealing in petty county politics.
YR’s could provide students with
an educational program, discuss
ing national issues and drawing
on top speakers. At present, the
YR’s serve some useful functions:
its work in national elections is
outstanding and enables students
to participate in major elections;
it cooperates with the Political
Union in bringing speakers to
campus: it holds receptions for
major politicians for its members.
This is only a start; and a full
program of debate, serious re
search on national problems, etc.
would make the SAYR’s a leader
in political education. The chief

obstacles to such enlightened
growth seem to be a preoccupa
tion with local politics and the oh
so-subtle ambitions of a few in
dividuals.
I hope these past few clays will
lead to serious thought about why
YR’s exist. What is their func
tion? What should it be? Perhaps
a more constructive future will
result.

THE BEST POLICY
Editor, The Daily:
The efforts of some to divert
attention from the issues raised
in Mr. Bierstedt’s article by bring
ing forth attacks upon myself and
my term in office are so obvious
ly designed as to give the impres
sion of a lot of hand waving. The
use of Mr. Cullen’s pen in yester
day morning’s barrage is particu
larly interesting, for what he has
to say must necessarily be hear
say since he was never around
either to perform his duties or to
observe what was going on.
Merely as an illustration, one
might point out that it was ex-
Governor Goodwin Knight’s ill
ness alone that prevented his ap
pearance under SAYR auspices,
all arrangements having been
completed with scarce little help
from the members of the present
administration. Secondly the rec
ord shows that Mr. Nixon was in
vited by myself personally in the
face of his deliberate omission
from the original invitations.
However, all of the above and
much of what has been said in
defense of machine actions has
been totally irrelevant to the
charges made in Mr. Bierstedt’s
article. Mr. Bierstedt charged that
the actions which he and his in
formants observed were not ac
ceptable to himself or to those to
whom he spoke. The plea of po
litical necessity vs. political naive
te has very little bearing when
the membership at large is ready
to condemn the actions taken on
moral grounds.

The probleyi is in the willing
ness of the officers to do ANY
THING to gain, increase, or pre
serve their own power or political

advantage. It is a question of
whether SAYR’s are organized to
work for the Republican Party
and to provide a center for politi
cal education, or whether the pur
pose has been changed to the
maintenance of an instrument of
power,
I, for one, hope that this contro
versy will now come to an end.
It is clear that the present SAYR
administration intends to persist
in an attitude and type of activity
which is repulsive to a large per
centage of the membership. It has
been further shown that their ac
tivities have driven Republicans
away from the support of their
own party. This past week has in
dicated that honesty may still be
the best policy despite the self
serving arguments of a few

CONSPICUOUS
Editor, The Daily:
Several of the statements made
by Mr. Weinig in yesterday’s
Daily are, at the least, mislead
ing. The statements I am refer
ring to are “the organization took
the legally required precautions
by posting a sign requesting mi
nor not to imbibe and making soft
drinks available,” and “it is . . ,
doubtful that an affinity for alco
hol was the primary attraction
for the majority of the persons
attending the election, since less
than 30 of the 120 Stanford stu
dents . . . came to the party.”
I was at the party, and if the
sign was posted it must have been
posted in some conspicuous place
like under the piano. Nor did I
see any sign of the soft drinks
that were, according to Mr. Wei
nig, made “available.” Further
more, no I.D.’s were requested
for being served beer, anti none
were presented.
Enough has been said about the
fake membership cards. I would
like to add that since I have had
no opportunity to examine the
SAYR constitution I cannot tell
whether or not the proceedings
were legal. I suspect they were
not, but at any rate they certain
ly were unethical and morally
wrong.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Weinig’s description of the
SAYR “victory party” was most
interesting, especially since I was
present at the celebration.
I saw no sign “requesting mi
nors not to imbibe,” nor did I see
any soft drinks.
Furthermore, the attendance at
the free beer party was probably
decreased because it did not be
gin until after midnight, although
those students I was with had
been told the election would end
at 9:30 p.m.
Incidentally, I received “fake
card, typo 1-A,” although not
from its owner.

The present SAYR administra
tion has (regrettably, between mo
ments of sarcasm) not specifical
ly denied that certain of the ir
regularities described by Mr. Bier
stedt occurred. However, they
deny having authorized or con
doned such activities. In particu
lar, they deny that the doings of
one SAYR member, who was spe
cifically identified by several wit
nesses, were authorized.
Now, although this SAYR mem
ber holds no elective office, he has
served and continues to serve as
the editor of the SAYR newslet
ter, and in effect speaks for the
organization in his writings. He
was also quite active in the mem
bership recruiting done in the
Wilbur houses this year. The
reader may judge from this what
connections he has with the
SAYR administration.
