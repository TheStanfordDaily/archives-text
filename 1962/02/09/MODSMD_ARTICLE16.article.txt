# THE
						REPUBLICAN 'IMAGE'
## Walter Lippmann 
### 
Mr. George Romney is a Repub
lican who “recognizes that the Re
publican image needs improve
ment.” In the Democratic party
“union influence is too great,” and
the Republican party, at least in
Michigan, has been “excessively
influenced” by business pressure
groups. Mr. Romney’s remedy,
which presumably would improve
the Republican “image,” is to re
spond less to organized minorities
and to rely on the strength of the
unorganized citizenry.
I cannot feel that this throws
much light on the problem of the
Republican party. The problem is
how to become the majority party
instead of being, as it has been for
over 30 years, the minority party.
The fallacy in Mr. Romney’s di
agnosis is that he talks as if all
“business” had the same views of
policy and of its interests, and so
too all “unions,” and that a sound
Republican party should divorce
itself from both. This is not only
impossible. It is quite undesirable.
The true political line for a par ty
—for either of the two parties—is
to associate itself with the en
lightened and progressive wing in
the business world and the en
lightened and progressive wing in
the union world. When a party
can do that, it commands the cen
ter, and is unbeatable.
SINCE THE Great Depression
and the advent of Franklin Roose
velt, the Republican party organ
ization has been in the control of
the Republican Congressmen who
had such safe seats that they sur
vived the Roosevelt landslides. Al
though there are exceptions, by
and large the Republican seniors,
who have acquired leadership by
being re-elected, come from the
countryside, the suburbs, and the
small manufacturing towns.
They are not in touch with the
urban masses. But also they are
not in touch with the bigger in
dustrialists and bankers in the
big cities, with the businessmen
who have had a wider experience
at home and abroad. For a long
time, for most of this century,
there has been a large divergence
inside the business world and in
side the Republican party on ques
tions of provincialism and paro
chialism as against nationalism
and internationalism.
The proof that this is the prob
lem is that never in the past 30
years have the Republicans chos
en for their Presidential candi
date a man who belongs to the
Congressional ruling group. The
Congressional group, which is
dominant in Congress, speaks for
I ho Republicans as a minority
party.
THEIK STRONGEST and their
wisest and their best leader was
Robert Taft. But three times the
party convention denied him the
nomination and chose a candidate
not identified with the Congres
sional Old Guard.
Why? Because the state poli
ticians and the larger urban busi
ness interests have known that no
Republican could be elected Presi
dent if he were an isolationist

and, in face of modern industrial
development, a reactionary. The
only Republican who was in fact
elected was Gen. Eisenhower, and
until he was nominated he could
not be described accurately as any
kind of Republican. When it came
to Mr. Nixon, he did his best not
to identify himself with the Old
Guard, and made overtures to
Gov. Rockefeller.
The fact that the Republican
party has been nominating men
who do not qualify as “real Re
publicans”—that is, as Congres
sional Old Guard Republicans—
plus the fact that all of them but
Gen. Eisenhower have lost the
election, has created a theory in
the Old Guard circle. Its loudest
and most attractive exponent is
Sen. Barry Goldwater. The theory
lis that the Republicans will win |
j apart from a freak election like
11hat of Gen. Eisenhower—only
j when they stand unreservedly for
the ideas of the Congressional Old
Guard. Sen. Goldwater has per
suaded himself that there is a
vast submerged Republican ma
jority which will go to the polls j
and vote only for an Old Guards
man.
THIS THEORY is almost cer
tainly not true. But there is no
way of proving that it is not true
as long as it is not tested at the
polls. As long as the dominant
| group in the party believes that
jthey have been frustrated by the
| nomination of men like Willkie,
; Dewey, and even Eisenhower, and
i now perhaps Romney, the party
j will be at sixes and sevens within
itself. This inner disorder is the
reason why it presents a poor
“image,” The party in Congress
is run by the Old Guard. But
masses of voters, who might pre
fer to be Republicans, do not find
a welcome and a home in the par
ty as it is actually managed.
The apparent remedy for this
would be to settle the conflict
within the party—to nominate not
another Willkie, Dewey, or Eisen
j hower, but what the Old Guard
calls a real Republican. If the out
look for the Republicans in 1964
is as poor as it is today, they
might not be risking much by do
ing that and they might gain a
good deal. They would be devot
ing one election to settling de
cisively the issue which divides
them and defeats them.
