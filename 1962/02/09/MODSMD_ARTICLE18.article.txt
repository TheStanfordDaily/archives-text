MISSED THE POINT
Editor, The Daily:
Cliff Probst’s criiclstm of the
Honors Program in Humanities
perhaps missed the point of the
department, indeed, of liberal edu
cation—not to mention that he
has presented a ludicrously un
fair picture of the program itself.
Mr. Probst makes much of the
four courses offered in World
Personalities. Now only one is
required of students in the de
partment; few take more than
one. As to the World Literature
series, it is admittedly a survey
course in the history of ideas. It
can hardly, in 12 units, cover
everything from Homer to Joyce
in more than a superficial man
ner. But is it unfair to assume
that serious students will thus
have an opening, a general back
ground and familiarity, to pursue
further such writers as Aeschy
lus, Dante, Augustine, or Kafka?
One must start somewhere can
“The Divine Comedy” be mean
ingful in itself before it is under
stood in relation to all leading up
to it, particularly the “Aeneid?”
And Mr. Probst’s criticism of the
lecturers in this series is a rath
er biased personal opinion.
Then Mr, Probst admits his own
error by granting that the two
remaining seminars in the second
year of the program are superb,
and that the senior thesis is an
excellent idea. This is, of course,
the major portion of the program.
But he fails to mention that one
is also required to take courses
in other departments, philosophy
and fine arts, which give one ade
quate background for the semi
nars in aesthetics and history.
Mr. Probst apparently advo
cates the “spoon feeding” method
of education. Naturally, students
in the Honors Program are ex
pected to do much work on their

own. One would hope an honors
program would assume such.
Certainly the program could be
improved. But I find it already do
ing an excellent job of relating
the fields of knowledge and ex
perience, and in “increasing one’s
awareness of basic values- intel
lectual, aesthetic, social and ethi
cal.”

TUTORIAL PROGRAM?
Kditor, The Daily:
The criticism of the Humanities
Honors Program in the Cliff
Probst article suffers from the
very malady which he attacks, in
that he "bogs down in vague gen
eralizations.” II is one thing to
recommend revitalization, and an
other to put forth specific sug
gestions for improvement. A
thorough study and considerable
overhaul of the Honors Program
is indicated in view of the obvious
dissatisfaction with the present
situation voiced by the majority
of the undergraduates involved.
The place for such a study is
not in (he columns of The Daily,
but at least a start may he made
by pointing out one area of im
provement. Probably the most in
tellectually stimulating experi
ence any student may undergo is
close personal contact with an
outstanding scholar in the stu
dent’s own field of interest. At
present (his occurs only in hap
hazard fashion, and then only
during the writing of the senior
essay.
As a transfer student I have
had the opportunity to participate

in an Honors Program at an in
stitution roughly analogous to
Stanford. There, however', the em
phasis was on individual tutorial,
commencing sophomore year. In
this way the student was con
stantly challenged and his even
tual selection of a thesis topic
was based on a broad considera
tion of many fields of learning.
The student was then well-round
ed, having been through a general
education program, and was also
a scholar with an acute aware
ness of the role of ideas in human
experience. The well-rounded are
} plentiful at Stanford, but I have
yet to meet many in the Honors
Program who considered the label
“scholar” a term of approbation.
The experiences of Oxford,
Cambridge and Harvard have
I demonstrated the efficacy of a tu
j torial program. If a similar ar
! rangement could be instituted at
I Stanford it is my belief that the
present problems of the Humani
ties Honors Program would bo
largely ameliorated.
Perhaps (his could take (he
form of a series of one-unit
courses involving weekly confer
ences and bi-weekly papers. In
any case, to reject tutorial be
cause of a claimed lack of per
sonnel would to admit a paucity
of competent scholars in graduate
[status at Stanford, which I do not
believe to be the case.

NOT THAT BLACK
Kditor, The Daily:
| Speaking as a member of the
1 Honors Program in Humanities,

I found Mr. Probst’s article criti
cizing the program an extremely
vague attempt at evaluation. This
is not to say that the program is
undeserving of critical scrutiny.
Many program members spend
the better part of their sophomore
and junior years trying to decide
what there is of value in the pro
gram to merit the time, three
years, and the units, some 48,
spent fulfilling the requirements.
The value of program partici
pation lies in personal applica
tion. The department seems to bo
saying, as the participant pro
ceeds to the junior and senior lev
els, “All right, follow up what in
terests you. In practical terms
your - 48 units are equivalent to a
minor. In personal ter ms, it’s up
to you to make junior seminar
and senior essay participation
something personally significant.”
Thus after an admittedly over
loaded sophomore year- of pro
gram requirements, the student
puts midterms and finals aside
and embarks on the most subjec
tive academic experience. It is in
this light that one must judge tire
success and integrity of the pro
gram.
Instead Mr. Probst wastes a
good deal of his criticism on the
world literature series, which is
only the introductory level of the

program. The effectiveness of this
series seems to me dependent on
discussion sections that are intel
ligently planned and enthusias
tically led.
Mr. Probst’s conclusion that in
the senior essay “the student has
had to accomplish the program's
purpose by himself” doesn’t paint
all that black a picture. Since
when has it been the job of a
Stanford education to not only
provide the materials for an in
dividual’s intellectual structure
but to build that structure as
well? Stephanie McDonell
