# Feinberg Law Creates 'Humorless Paradox'
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
Approximately 10 years ago,
New York State put into effect
the Feinberg Law to protect chil
dren against the “dissemination
of dangerous political propagan
da.” It was created to protect the
school against the infiltration of
“subversive ideas” which, as in
most laws of this type, are not
clearly defined.
I assume that the creators of
the Feinberg Law are honorable
men who are doing what they
think is best for America. How
ever, they are extremely short
sighted or dangerously stupid.
The Feinberg Law promotes con
formist thinking—the ver\ type
of conformist thinking we see and
hate behind the Iron Curtain.
OUR FEAR of being “polluted”
leads us to create standards
against which we measure the ac
ceptability of “unorthodox” ideas.
What we overlook is that pres
ence of “unorthodox” ideas, “ac
ceptable” or not, is one of the
ways we protect ourselves against
confox’mist majority thinking.
We are obviously faced with an
extremely humorless paradox.
The “Feinberg Laws” of this
country have been created to pre
vent the growth of totalitarian
concepts. Unfortunately, such
laws do just the opposite.
When men are told what to
think about, when they are told
what views they can and cannot
express, with what groups they
can and cannot associate, then we
are well on our way to “Totali
taria.”
SUPREME COURT Justice Hu
go Black, upon casting a dissent
ing opinion on the Feinberg Law
in 1952, said: “This is another of
those . . . rapidly multiplying
legislative enactments which
make it dangerous to think or say
anything except what a transient
majority happens to approve at
the moment.
“Basically these laws rest on
the belief that Government should
supervise and limit the flow of
ideas into the minds of men. The
tendency of such governmental
policy is to mould people into a
common pattern.” The same com
mon pattern into which people be
hind the Iron Curtain are mould
ed!
“Quite a different governmental

policy rests on the belief that Gov
ernment should leave the mind
and spirit of man absolutely free.”
Black says, ‘‘Such a governmental
policy” encourages varied intel
lectual outlooks in the belief that

the best views will prevail.”
To conclude, a free society’s
greatest safeguard against mass
conformism and DESTRUCTION
OF FREEDOM, is the free ex
change of ideas. A free society
possesses the sophistication to ig
nore ideas which threaten its free
dom. Once a free society is over
run by ‘‘father protectors,” how
ever, it is but one short step away
from totalitarianism, the very sys
tem these same protectors so pa
triotically denounce.
