NOMINAL CHARGE
Editor, The Daily:
As we read Mr. Probst’s article
on the Humanities Honors Pro
gram, we became deeply concern
ed over his anguished statement
that ‘‘the individual is left to de
termine his own basic values.”
Because Mr. Probst’s plight is
quite understandable, we feel an
earnest desire to help him.
For a nominal charge wo will
gladly send him a copy of one of
our two pamphlets on basic
values—either the one supplying
alternative basic values, or the
one which provides a single,
tightly unified system of ethics.
