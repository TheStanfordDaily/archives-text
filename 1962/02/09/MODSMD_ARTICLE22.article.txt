## Two Ways to Enjoy a Concert 
### SALLY PAYTON 
While we heartily endorse Glenn
Gould’s reputation as one of the
most brilliant young pianists on
the scene today, it seemed during
the concert Wednesday night that
Mr. Gould has not yet quite re
alized the potentialities of the
piano as a solo instrument.
Ho apparently feels that when
the piano is not supported by an
orchestra it is most appropriately
assisted by the human voice—his,
to be exact. And while his instru
mental excellence is unquestion
able, his vocal merit is open to
debate.
Concert-goers Wednesday night
were torn between two ways of
enjoying Mr. Gould’s perform
ance; either one could close one’s
eyes and sink into a highly sensi
tive, if slightly over-dramatic, in
terpretalion of Beethoven’s
Fourth Piano Concerto, and at
tempt to ignore Mr. Gould him
self; or one could enjoy a highly
diverting comedy act put on by
Mr. Gould. In either case the per
formance was brilliant.
Mr. Gould slouched in his low,
green-cushioned chair, his face
twitching violently during orches
tral interludes, conducted with
his left hand while playing with
his right, cued in the conductor,
and, of course, sang. The orches
tra, and, in fact, the piano, seemed
superfluous.

For those who chose to listen to
the musical aspect o£ Mr. Gould’s
talent, the performance was
equally enjoyable. He showed
himself to be possessed of an im
pressive technique and a feeling
for Beethoven, marred only infre
quently by the histrionics which
characterized his stage presence.
With the exception of the second
movement, in which he seemed
to be slightly less at ease, his vir
tuosity justified his reputation,
which well merited the sell-out
house.
The first half of the program
was devoted to Handel’s “Water
Music” and Stravinsky’s “Third
Symphony” (vintage 1946). The
Oakland Symphony, blessed with
a very sparse, non-histrionic con
ductor in Gerhard Samuel, gave a
creditable and enjoyable rendition
of both works, apart from some
insubordination in the brass sec
tion. The string tone, though in
appropriate to the Handel, which
would have been better performed
by a smaller group, emerged very
well during the last two move
ments of the Beethoven.
As a whole, the concert, from
both an entertainment and a seri
ous musical standpoint, was most
profitable.

a very sparse, non-histrionic con
ductor in Gerhard Samuel, gave a
creditable and enjoyable rendition
of both works, apart from some
insubordination in the brass sec
tion. The string tone, though in
appropriate to the Handel, which
would have been better performed
by a smaller group, emerged very
well during the last two move
ments of the Beethoven.
As a whole, the concert, from
both an entertainment and a seri
ous musical standpoint, was most
profitable.
While we heartily endorse Glenn
Gould’s reputation as one of the
most brilliant young pianists on
the scene today, it seemed during
the concert Wednesday night that
Mr. Gould has not yet quite re
alized the potentialities of the
piano as a solo instrument.
Ho apparently feels that when
the piano is not supported by an
orchestra it is most appropriately
assisted by the human voice—his,
to be exact. And while his instru
mental excellence is unquestion
able, his vocal merit is open to
debate.
Concert-goers Wednesday night
were torn between two ways of
enjoying Mr. Gould’s perform
ance; either one could close one’s
eyes and sink into a highly sensi
tive, if slightly over-dramatic, in
terpretalion of Beethoven’s
Fourth Piano Concerto, and at
tempt to ignore Mr. Gould him
self; or one could enjoy a highly
diverting comedy act put on by
Mr. Gould. In either case the per
formance was brilliant.
Mr. Gould slouched in his low,
green-cushioned chair, his face
twitching violently during orches
tral interludes, conducted with
his left hand while playing with
his right, cued in the conductor,
and, of course, sang. The orches
tra, and, in fact, the piano, seemed
superfluous.

For those who chose to listen to
the musical aspect o£ Mr. Gould’s
talent, the performance was
equally enjoyable. He showed
himself to be possessed of an im
pressive technique and a feeling
for Beethoven, marred only infre
quently by the histrionics which
characterized his stage presence.
With the exception of the second
movement, in which he seemed
to be slightly less at ease, his vir
tuosity justified his reputation,
which well merited the sell-out
house.
The first half of the program
was devoted to Handel’s “Water
Music” and Stravinsky’s “Third
Symphony” (vintage 1946). The
Oakland Symphony, blessed with
a very sparse, non-histrionic con
ductor in Gerhard Samuel, gave a
creditable and enjoyable rendition
of both works, apart from some
insubordination in the brass sec
tion. The string tone, though in
