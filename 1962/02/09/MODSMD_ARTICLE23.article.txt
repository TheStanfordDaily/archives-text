Nearly everyone from last
year’s team is back, and with the
addition of some new personnel,
the visiting Southlanders can be
tough.
Leading the UCLA atack will
be Peter Nicklin, a veteran from
South Africa. Nicklin, who plays
at the secontl 5/8 position, does
most of the kicking for the Bruins.
According to Kmetovic, if the

Cards can keep from giving him
many opportunities to make pen
alty kicks, a good part of the
game will be already won.
Coach Ged Garner’s Bruins will
also have some help from two
new classy foreign imports in the
persons of Barry Bugden from
England, a scrum half, and Peter
Wilson, a New Zealand break
away.

The visitors from Westwood
also sport some talent in football
stars Joe Bauwens, Rob Smith
and Don Vena.

The opening lineup for UCLA
should see Joe Edwards at Hook,
and Jim Morris and Bill Dun
woodie at the two prop spots.
Playing in the second row will
be Bauwens and Nelson Rising,
and Don Francis will play lock.
The Bruin forward wall will be
completed by Vena and Wilson at
the breakaway spots.
Starting in the backfield for the
touring Bruins will be Bugden at
scrum half, Mibo Shimayama at
first 5/8 and Nicklin at second
5/8.

John Davis will play the center
3/4 slot; the two wings will be
manned by Herb Ludwig and
Mike Downey; and Smith will
round out the backfield playing
at fullback.

Stanford’s opening lineup will

season will be Rod Sears. Sears,
playing at fullback, a defensive
position in rugby, seldom gets to
show much of an offensive threat,
but his outstanding play is one
reason why Stanford sports such
a tough defense.

Leading the UCLA atack will
be Peter Nicklin, a veteran from
South Africa. Nicklin, who plays
at the secontl 5/8 position, does
most of the kicking for the Bruins.
According to Kmetovic, if the

Cards can keep from giving him
many opportunities to make pen
alty kicks, a good part of the
game will be already won.
Coach Ged Garner’s Bruins will
also have some help from two
new classy foreign imports in the
persons of Barry Bugden from
England, a scrum half, and Peter
Wilson, a New Zealand break
away.

The visitors from Westwood
also sport some talent in football
stars Joe Bauwens, Rob Smith
and Don Vena.

The opening lineup for UCLA
should see Joe Edwards at Hook,
and Jim Morris and Bill Dun
woodie at the two prop spots.
Playing in the second row will
be Bauwens and Nelson Rising,
and Don Francis will play lock.
The Bruin forward wall will be
completed by Vena and Wilson at
the breakaway spots.
Starting in the backfield for the
touring Bruins will be Bugden at
scrum half, Mibo Shimayama at
first 5/8 and Nicklin at second
5/8.

John Davis will play the center
3/4 slot; the two wings will be
manned by Herb Ludwig and
Mike Downey; and Smith will
round out the backfield playing
at fullback.

Stanford’s opening lineup will
be slightly changed from previous
weeks.

Keith Richmond is missing with
a bad leg along with big A1 Hilde
brand, who is nursing a sprained
ankle. Jon Brandin will be gone
with a case of mononucleosis, and
Chuck Cobb has taken time off to
participate in a track meet in Los
Angeles.
Leading the Indian rugbymen
into their fourth contest of the
season will be Rod Sears. Sears,
playing at fullback, a defensive
position in rugby, seldom gets to
show much of an offensive threat,
but his outstanding play is one
reason why Stanford sports such
a tough defense.
The rest of the Card lineup will
include John Thomas, Troy Bar
bee, Randy Vahan, Dick Leeuwen
berg, Frank Atkinson, John But
ler-, Steve Pursell and Tim Hansel
in the line.
In the backfield will be Bob
Price, Tom McManus, Hal Steu
her-, Stan Lindskog, Clark Weaver,
