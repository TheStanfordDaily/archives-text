# CAGERS MEET USC, UCLA
## Indians in Crucial Road Trip 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
This is the weekend of tied
team. If the Cards are going to n
chase it has to be now.
Stanford opposes the USC Ti
row evening in a pair of games
★ ★ ★

ision for the Stanford basketball
nake a move in the Big Five title
rojans tonight and UCLA tomor
i to be played in the Southland,
I Tipoff time is scheduled for 8
p.m. both nights.
THE INDIANS are 2-2 in
j league, as opposed to UCLA’s 4-0
I and USC’s .3-2. One loss would
I make it all but impossible for the
Tribe to come out on top, and
two losses would sound the death
knell.
Stanford will send to the fore
against SC and UCLA the same
starting five that Coach Howie
Dallmar has been counting on
since Christmas vacation.
Forwards will be Hollis Moore
and John Windsor. Tom Dose is
a sure bet at center, and Don
Clemetson and Darrell Suther
land will be the guards.
IE STANFORD is to win either
game, it will have to get increased
fire-power from the guards. When
Stanford was hot during the pre
season games, it was Dose and
the guards doing most of the scor
ing, with occasional bursts from
Windsor and Moore.
Now. Windsor and Dose have
been carrying virtually all the
scoring burden, with occasional
support from the guards. Moore
has done little point-making but
he has performed well enough on
defense to account for his pres
ence in the starting lineup.
Windsor has been the top Card
gunner of late, and this is no
secret to the Southlanders who
will probably concentrate their
defenses on him and Dose to stop
Stanford. Contributions by Suth
erland and Don and Doug Clemet
son would be appreciated by Dall
mar.
AGAINST THE slumping Slan-

I fords, USC will send out a lineup
i including Gordie Martin and Ken
] Stanley at forwards, All-Ameri
i can John Rudometkin at center,
and all-coast Chris Appel and Neil
Edwards at guards. This outfit
j was once rated second in the na
tion, but its loss to UCLA last
week dropped it to seventh or
eleventh, depending on which
wire service you listen to.
USC also boasts a bench almost
jas strong as that of Stanford.
| Wells Sloniger and Vern Ashby
! top that department.
The Bruins send out a well
{ balanced squad led by guard John
j ny Green. Others on the squad
; are guard Walt Hazzard and for
wards Gary Cunningham and
Pete Blackman. All average over
10 points per game.
CKNTEK Flt EII Slaughter
rounds out the starting five,
j Slaughter is a good rebounder.
I Second-string center Dave Wax
j man is tough defensively, hut it
I was when Slaughter was moved
j past him to the first string that
j UCLA started making noises like
a champ.
Because of the balance of both
squads, Stanford can’t concen
trate on any one individual.
Against SC, if Stanford concern
: trates on Rudometkin or Appel,
I Stanley or Martin will kill them
wdth insirle moves, and Edwards
will pop in a few long Jumpers.
UCLA IS MORE of the same.
Green drives and hits the long
one, and usually is fouled while
doing so.
Cunningham and Blackman are
deadly on medium range jump
shots, and Hazzard is a play-mak
er and ball-hawk.
Slaughter is murder under the
boards.
It could be a long weekend for
i Stanford in Southern California,
[ but on the other hand, it could he
jthe start of the big push to the
■ I AAWU title.
