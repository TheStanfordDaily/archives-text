# Frosh Cagers Visit San Jose
## 
### 
Stanford’s frosh basketball
team hopes for a repeat perform
ance tomorrow afternoon when it
travels to San Jose to take on the
under-rated San Jose State Spar
tans. Game time is 4 p.m. in the
San Jose State Gym.
Stanford defeated the Spartans
42-24 in the Pavilion in a game
that had connoisseurs of basket
ball shuddering. The Spartans,
never noted as a fast-moving
team, worked the ball around in
terminably for a set-uo. and then
took a bad shot anyway. Stanford
grabbed the rebound, drove down
court for a fast shot, and when
the Spartans got the ball again,
the whole absurd cycle repealed
itself.
SAN JOSE WAS hampered
that game by the absence from
the lineup of 6-6 nonesuch center
Joe Knox, who evidently has re
covered from what ailed him and
will see action tomorrow.
Knox is supposedly one of the
greatest basketball prospects ever
to enroll at the college down the
Peninsula. Others on the Spartan
club who will make trouble for
Stanford include 5-8 guard Ron
Labetich and 6-5 forward John
Langenhime.
Despite his small size. Labetich
is a good shooter, (hough he
didn’t impress against Stanford
in their last meeting. Indian
guard Dick Ragsdale used a
pressing defense to force him to
take a variety of bad shots.
LANGENHIME is a rugged re
bounder, and has some moves in
side.
Stanford will open with a line
up including Bob Garner and
Frank Olrich at forwards, John
Murray at center, and Rod Taylor
and Mike Preisler, recently elect
ed co-captains for the 1962 season
at guards.
Murray, the 6-8 giant from Eu
reka, had his best night to date
in the Frosh’s last outing, against
Santa Clara, when he potted 24
points, mostly on a variety of
short fall-away jump shots. He
also topped rebounders, and
| seems to be coming into his own
i after a slow start.
Backing up the starters are for-
I ward Jack Gilbert and Ragsdale
I mainly.
GILBERT HAD been the Tribe’s
leading scorer before a bout with
infected teeth. His 6-7 heighth
will be welcome addition to Stan
ford’s already sky-scraping hack
board crew.
Ragsdale is Stanford’s top
marksman, with a percentage
over the 60 mark. His passing has
set up many an easy basket for
the jumping-jacks in the front
line.
Stanford has to be favored to
morrow, but with the crew of
shooters San Jose has and their
off-beat offense, anything can
happen.
