MONTE CARLO, Monaco (UPI»
—The Secret Army Organization
(OAS) has threatened a terror
campaign of plastic bombings in
this tiny principality if Prince
Rainier does not stop pro-French
government broadcasts from
Monte Carlo radio, it was learned
yesterday.
Informed sources said the
prince, husband of the former
Grace Kelly, recently received a
series of letters outlining the
threat.
The sources said the OAS
warned that a chain of bomb ex
plosions would frighten tourists
away, empty Monte Carlo’s gam
bling casinos, and drive out inter
national businessmen, thus cut
ting off Monaco’s chief sources of
income.
