# LASSU
## Pacifists Approved 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
The non-violent action group,
a peace demonstration and fund
raising activity for the I-Club
took up most of last night’s
LASSU meeting, with the first
being approved, the second offi
cially ignored, and the latter held
in abeyance until next week.
Forum for Discussion of Non-
Violent Alternatives to War’s
three-page constitution was ap
proved by a 19 to 5 roll call vote
after assurances were written in
that the group have only Stan
ford students, operate only on
campus, and have no contact with
off-campus groups, though its
members will retain freedom to
operate as individuals.
THIS IS the same group whose
constitution was rejected four
weeks ago for technical reasons.
There were no technical ques
tions on this week’s document,
written with the assistance of the
LASSU By-Laws Committee.
Opposition operated on two
other fronts. Lawrie Chickering
thought the group was partisan
and should be under Political Un
ion. but he was ignored since the
group is non-partisan. Charles
Lofgren fought the group for the
bad publicity it may produce and
danger of Communist infiltration.
Immediately thereafter another
group sought permission to hold
a demonstration for peace as part
of the national Turn Towards
Peace next weekend. The demon
stration would consist of a peti
tion to Kennedy, distribution of
literature, and peace songs and
speeches on the library lawn next
Friday.
ASSU PRESIDENT Bob Saylor
explained that ho didn’t think
LASSU had to approve the dem
onstration, but ought to know of
it.
After some discussion, LASSU
decided it would be damned for
opposing free speech if it dis
approved, and damned for giving
official sanction to the movement
if it okayed the group. Therefore,
it stood mute.
It was explained that the dem
onstration, due to its national af
filiation, did not fall under the
auspices of the newly approved
peace group.

being approved, the second offi
cially ignored, and the latter held
in abeyance until next week.
Forum for Discussion of Non-
Violent Alternatives to War’s
three-page constitution was ap
proved by a 19 to 5 roll call vote
after assurances were written in
that the group have only Stan
ford students, operate only on
campus, and have no contact with
off-campus groups, though its
members will retain freedom to
operate as individuals.
THIS IS the same group whose
constitution was rejected four
weeks ago for technical reasons.
There were no technical ques
tions on this week’s document,
written with the assistance of the
LASSU By-Laws Committee.
Opposition operated on two
other fronts. Lawrie Chickering
thought the group was partisan
and should be under Political Un
ion. but he was ignored since the
group is non-partisan. Charles
Lofgren fought the group for the
bad publicity it may produce and
danger of Communist infiltration.
Immediately thereafter another
group sought permission to hold
a demonstration for peace as part
of the national Turn Towards
Peace next weekend. The demon
stration would consist of a peti
tion to Kennedy, distribution of
literature, and peace songs and
speeches on the library lawn next
Friday.
ASSU PRESIDENT Bob Saylor
explained that ho didn’t think
LASSU had to approve the dem
onstration, but ought to know of
it.
After some discussion, LASSU
decided it would be damned for
opposing free speech if it dis
approved, and damned for giving
official sanction to the movement
if it okayed the group. Therefore,
it stood mute.
It was explained that the dem
onstration, due to its national af
filiation, did not fall under the
auspices of the newly approved
peace group.
