PARIS, Friday UPl—Eight per
sons including three women were
killed in a three hour battle last
night between police and a Com
munist-led mob of 10,000 demon
strators protesting against the
Secret Army Organization OAS,
authorities said today.
While the mob fought police
with clubs and paving stones in
the working class section of east
Paris the OAS exploded plastic
bombs in other sections. One dam
aged the offices of the Soviet Tass
news agency.
The Interior Ministry said 83
demonstrators were arrested dur
ing and after the rioting in which
at least one policeman fired his
pistol and wounded two members
of the mob who were attacking
his paddy wagon jammed with
prisoners with paving stones.
Hundreds of others were hauled
away and released.
The fighting erupted last night
in the historic Place de la Bastille
where the fortress• prison once
stood and spilled over into the side
streets and the nearby Place de la
Nation. It raged for nearly three
hours before police dispersed the
mob at 9:30 p.m.
The Ministry of Interior issued
a communique blaming the riots
on the Communists and said it was
trying to take advantage of the
“criminal OAS actions” in an at
tempt to recover "lost credit”
among persons fighting to pre
serve the French democracy.
“Subversion finds an ally in the
disorder which such demonstra
tions provoke in the public mind
and in the immobilization of forces
which would be better employed
elsewhere,” the ministry said. The
statement made it dear - the police
wanted no two-front war at such
a grave time of crisis.
The Communists called the dem
onstration against the outlawed
army terrorist group despite a
police ban.
