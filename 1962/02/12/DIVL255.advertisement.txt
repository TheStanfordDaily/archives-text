It's easy to feel that way when
you can’t seem to get ahead of
financial woes. But, things prob
ably aren't as bad as they seem.
A good way to begin your finan
cial planning is through life in
surance. And a good time to
begin is now, when you’ll profit
by lower premiums. Many new
plans and features, especially
attractive to college students,
deserve your consideration.
Stop by our campus office, or
