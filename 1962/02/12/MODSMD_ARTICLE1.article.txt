# Results of Coeducational Housing Study Disclosed

(EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the first of a
three-part series investigating coeducational
housing in college dormitories. Today’s ar
ticle tells how coed housing works at uni
versities that have it.)

In the fall of 1961, LASSU established the
Committee for Undergraduate Living to
study, among other things, the possibility of
coeducational housing. That committee, head
ed by Richard Muller, is now almost ready
to give its report.
The members of the committee sent ques
tionnaires to the Directors of Housing and
the Deans of Men, Women and Students on
each of 13 campuses. They asked about the
coeducational housing programs on each of
these campuses, and have attempted to relate

them to the possibility of coeducational
housing at Stanford.
THE FINDINGS of the committee have
been almost entirely in favor of coed hous
ing. Through their correspondence, they have
found both advantages and disarvantages of
the coed housing system.
The colleges have listed as advantages a
marked improvement in manners and dress,
more mature social conduct, more natural
social situations, broadened perspective in
discussions, and a marked drop in mainten
ance costs. Bill Cranmer, a member of the
committee, said that with a single exception
•—Northern Illinois University-all of the 13
responding schools planned to either keep or
enlarge their present facilities.
There also seemed to be several common
disadvantages in coed living programs. There

was always some exposure problems—un
closed drapes, etc.—but none of the schools
seemed to take them particularly seriously.
More serious were the problems involved in
lounge use—couples necking and the need
for proper dress. Cranmer said, however,
that “these lounge problems are usually kept
to a minimum by social regulation and by
proper planning of the lounge facilities.”
Most schools replied that their social regula
tions about hours, etc., were not altered at
all. Cranmer felt that it was interesting to
note that “practically all the schools seemed
to feel that the advantages involved in co
educational living programs far outweighed
the disadvantages.”
“ON A SLIGHTLY different plane.” said
Cranmer, "are the planning and administra
tive problems. Since the common recreational

facilities in coed living centers are used much
more than those in comparable facilities,
there is a need for both more space and more
equipment. This also involves a slightly
higher cost for maintenance and replacement,
offset by less damage overall.
“There is also a need for some convenient
small lounge and recreational space within the
residence especially for one sex or the other
—where the students can talk or study with
out worrying about dress,” Cranmer said.
The correspondence from the other cam
puses also showed a number of other needs
required to make the coed program work
able. Among these, Cranmer included the
need for single living facilities somewhere
on campus for those who did not wish to be
part of a coeducational living program. He
also told of the need of a number of small,

joint dining rooms ralhor than one large
dining room to help develop closer and fuller
friendships, although admittedly fewer in
number.
CRANMER learned that particularly in
the coeducational units there was a need for
“a united administration and united adminis
tration policy towards coeducational living
problems. This would involve both student
government’s handling of disciplinary prob
lems and faculty and “house” administra
tion’s supervision of the whole range of stu
dent problems,” Cranmer said.
Cranmer felt that the answers to the
questionnaires didn’t seem to show any ob
vious effect on academics in the coeducation
al residences and centers.
