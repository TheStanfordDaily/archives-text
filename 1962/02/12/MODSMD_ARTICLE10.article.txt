co-operate with Stanford foreign
students in making the I-Club a
more integral part of the campus
life will be presented to students
tonight at house meetings when
they meet to vote for the bene
ficiary of this year’s Winter
Drives.
The opinion vote is a part of
the re-evaluation of Winter Drives
being made by Cardinals, spon
sor of the all-campus event, in
view of past lack of interest by
students. According to Cardinals
Board, students had no direct con
nections with the past x’ecipients
and felt that their parents already
supported such organizations.

$1,089, as compared with the top
figure for earlier years, $3,400.
This year the International
Club, official ASSU host for the
500 foreign students on campus,
is being considered by Cardinals
for a program to provide for
more opportunities for informal
contacts between foreign and
American students. The program
will also extend to providing some
of the physical needs of the new
I-Club being planned.
Jim Rogers and Jim Shekoyan,
co-chairmen of Winter Drives ex
plained Cardinals’ plans to help
provide events such as receptions
for foreign dignitaries, expanded
Evening Abroad programs, inter
national entertainment evenings,
and more foreign dinner guests in
residences.

Rogers stated that the plan, “if
received favorably by students to
night, will benefit the Univeisi
ty as a whole as well as the for
eign students.”
