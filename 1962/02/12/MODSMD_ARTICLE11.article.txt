# ROSY CRUSADER'S GLOW
## Indignation Hits Aid to Tito 
### JERRY RANKIN 
The National Indignation Con
vention hit Sunnyvale last Friday
night and played to a near full
house of highly indignant Penin
sulans who left the Bishop School
Auditorium emanating that rosy
glow of those engaged in a cru
sade.
They declared the object of their
religious-like, dedicated indigna
tion is the U.S. policy of training
Yugoslav pilots in this country
and giving obsolete jet planes to
Tito in the hope that this will help
keep him outside the clutches of
Moscow.
And, no question about it, they
are indignant about this U.S. pol
icy. But—as in almost all right
wing meetings I've attended (and
I’m a veteran of right-wing meet
ings)—their wrath touched the
usual subjects: the Red-riddled
State Department, the anti-mili
tary Secretary of Defense, the
“controlled press,” the left-wing
Kennedy Administratinn and so
forth.
THE AUDITORIUM where the
meeting was hold bore the usual
marks of such meetings. In the
lobby, a vast array of conserva
tive literature was available for
the faithful willing to pay. Inside
the auditorium, the usual stand of
red, white and blue flowers was

set in front of the podium, while
a group of 30 chairs was set up
for members of the “Freedom
Chorus” which would lend its pa
triotic voice to the events of the
evening. The ever-present, middle
aged ladies who organize these
things scuttled about, making ar
rangements and greeting local
personalities (“So glad to see you,
colonel,” “Welcome, councilman
Brown!”).
Master of ceremonies for the
night was Wilhelm Schmitt, con
sidered by many on the Peninsula
including himself as the
world's foremost expert on com
munism. Those who witnessed
last, winter’s HUAC debate at
Stanford will remember Bill.

Bill got things rolling by saying
why he was indignant (“pro-Com
munist agents” in the govern
ment, etc.) and getting in a nice
dig at Sen. Fulbright, whom he
described as the man “who sees
patriots under every bed.” They
roared at that one.

Cheers also were long and
heavy for Gen. Douglas Mac A
rthur, Barry Goldwater and, most
of all, Gen. Edwin Walker, who
apparently is coming to San Jose
sometime soon.

(BEERS AGAIN GREETED
Schmitt (who seems to enjoy the
limelight) when he castigated the

“rotten structure" of “that tower
of infamy ... of butchers,” the
United Nations. Schmitt caution
ed, however, that the NIC was be
ing non-partisan—and then de
clared “by popular proclamation
of the floor” the meeting a bona
fide local gathering of the NIC.
“We want our voice of protest
to reverberate across the country
and penetrate even the thick walls
of Hyannis Port,” Schmitt de
clared as the crowd of about 400
applauded.
Then Schmitt pulled out a pe
tition which, along with a dog
muzzle he happened to have
along, would be sent to Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara
“in recognition of his efforts to
silence” the noble military men
Who are attempting to alert the
nation to the danger of the athe
istic, Communist conspiracy. This
move really brought down the
house.
IN FACT, any preacher present
would have drooled at the sight of
such fervent, unquestioning dedi
cation to a cause. Often during
the speeches when a particularly
reprehensible U.S. policy was
mentioned (“There is, right now
a YUGOSLAV officer training at
Fort Leavenworth!”) the ladies
in the audience would groan or
gasp in horror, and the man be
hind me even burst out with a
sincere “Amen!” when Schmitt
declared the Reds in the govern
ment must be ousted. Great ma
terial for a revival.
The featured speaker, Republi
can Rep. Charles Gubser, same up
with a strangely mixed speech.
He pointed out that many loyal,
well-intentioned citizens were ad
vocating causes which, bit by bit,
added up to the entire Communist
line being advocated in this coun
try. Obviously, if the Reds advo
cate integration, then one is—un
wittingly, of course—advocating
a part of the Red line, if he too is
for integration.
He also flung arrows at the “in
tellectual bigots” which abound,
and at the press, which is “dis
crediting” the anti-Communist
movement. Schmitt made the rou
tine right wing charge that the
press is “controlled” by the Reds
or their sympathizers—a charge
I always find amusing, particular
ly when I think of the typically
uncontrolled Los Angeles press
and the variety of views offered
readers of the Hearst and Chand
ler papers.
BUT GUBSER ALSO put forth
some common sense. He said he
is “alarmed by some in our midst”
who are engaged in a “foolish ex
ercise to find who is the purest,
the most conservative among us.”
He criticized those who judge
one’s degree of anti-communism
by the degree of one’s conserva
tism. “We can’t divide ourselves
and haggle over who is the most
conservative,” he pointed out. He
sure had his audience pegged
right.
Gubser noted that in the last
month he has been rated by three
conservative groups on the degree
of conservatism-liberalism-social
ism he has shown by his votes in
the House.
One group gave him a 100 per
cent conservative rating, while
the other said he was okay 75 per
cent of the time. But the third
gave him a 61 per cent liberal-so
cialist rating, he added with a
laugh. The audience seemed to
get his point.
Gubser was still going strong
when I left, this time calling for a
“vigorous anti-Communist pro
gram in the State Department
. . . ” His audience was just as
responsive as ever.
It must be reassuring to be part
of a dedicated unquestioning,
simple cause. It sure beats think
ing.
