TIIK TRUTH
Editor, The Daily:
In reviewing “Mein Kampf”
last week I wrote the following:
“The Warsaw ghetto would never
have been possible but for the at
titude of the Poles themselves.”
A few days later, in a letter to
The Daily. Mr. William Boreysza
called my statement “nonsense—
a peculiar Stanford interpreta
tion of history original . . .
unique.” To Mr. Boreysza my
words are so patently ridiculous
that “it is not worth arguing.”
I happen to think to the con
trary that it is worth discussing
and am willing to prove my point.

My main view is this. The worst
excesses of the Nazis against the
Jews might have been prevented
had they not found Poland itself
to be a country steeped in anti-
Semitism, and with its own long
history of pogroms. That is to
say that many parts of the popu
lation, with the notable exception
of the labor movement, tacitly ap
proved of the Nazi actions in re
gard to the Jewish populace.

Before the war there existed a
strong tradition of anti-Semitism
in Poland that found its voice in
the many extreme fascist organ
izations such as the N.D. Party.
These organizations demanded a
solution to the Jewish question
often in terms borrowed straight
from Hitler Germany.
In 1936 the Camp of National
Unification, acting under the aus
pices of the government proclaim
ed the necessity of ousting Jews
from the economic and cultural
life of the country. Some groups
demanded confiscation of Jewish
property without idemnification,
while Polish Ministers on many
occasions expressed their official
approval of a program designed
to expel all Jews from Poland.
Prior to 1939 the program of
the fascists manifested itself in
the picketing of Jewish shops,
the expulsion of Jews from uni
versities, and finally in the or
ganization of pogroms which
didn’t cease till the outbreak of
the war. This then was the pic
ture of pre-war Poland.
During the war a small minori
ty of courageous Poles as indi
viduals and as members of the
resistance helped the Jews, But
my contention is that the mass had
ceased caring so that the Nazis
were able to harvest a crop al
ready sown by the Endeks and
the Sanacja.
But when Hitler fell this was
not the end for Polish Jews. It
has been estimated that over 1,000
Jews died in waves of Polish anti-
Semitism after the war, while the
traditional pogrom was again
seen a Cracow in 1945 and Kielce
in 1946.

This bloody and shameful his
tory is all the more striking when
contrasted with the attitudes of
the Danish and Dutch popula
tions. In Denmark the King him
self swore ho would wear a badge
of shame if it was imposed, while
in Holland in February 1941 the

whole population came out in a
general strike aimed against the
deportation policies of the Ger
mans.
All these facts I am willing to
document, and, in spite of Mr.
Boreysza, I see no reason for
taking back a single word of my
review.
Mr. Boreysza acknowledges
that views similar to mine have
appeared in many speeches and
publications. May I submit that
the reason is simple. They hap
pen to express the truth.

TIIK TRUTH
Editor, The Daily:
In reviewing “Mein Kampf”
last week I wrote the following:
“The Warsaw ghetto would never
have been possible but for the at
titude of the Poles themselves.”
A few days later, in a letter to
The Daily. Mr. William Boreysza
called my statement “nonsense—
a peculiar Stanford interpreta
tion of history original . . .
unique.” To Mr. Boreysza my
words are so patently ridiculous
that “it is not worth arguing.”
I happen to think to the con
trary that it is worth discussing
and am willing to prove my point.

My main view is this. The worst
excesses of the Nazis against the
Jews might have been prevented
had they not found Poland itself
to be a country steeped in anti-
Semitism, and with its own long
history of pogroms. That is to
say that many parts of the popu
lation, with the notable exception
of the labor movement, tacitly ap
proved of the Nazi actions in re
gard to the Jewish populace.

Before the war there existed a
strong tradition of anti-Semitism
in Poland that found its voice in
the many extreme fascist organ
izations such as the N.D. Party.
These organizations demanded a
solution to the Jewish question
often in terms borrowed straight
from Hitler Germany.
In 1936 the Camp of National
Unification, acting under the aus
pices of the government proclaim
ed the necessity of ousting Jews
from the economic and cultural
life of the country. Some groups
demanded confiscation of Jewish
property without idemnification,
while Polish Ministers on many
occasions expressed their official
approval of a program designed
to expel all Jews from Poland.
Prior to 1939 the program of
the fascists manifested itself in
the picketing of Jewish shops,
the expulsion of Jews from uni
versities, and finally in the or
ganization of pogroms which
didn’t cease till the outbreak of
the war. This then was the pic
ture of pre-war Poland.
During the war a small minori
ty of courageous Poles as indi
viduals and as members of the
resistance helped the Jews, But
my contention is that the mass had
ceased caring so that the Nazis
were able to harvest a crop al
ready sown by the Endeks and
the Sanacja.
But when Hitler fell this was
not the end for Polish Jews. It
has been estimated that over 1,000
Jews died in waves of Polish anti-
Semitism after the war, while the
traditional pogrom was again
seen a Cracow in 1945 and Kielce
in 1946.

This bloody and shameful his
tory is all the more striking when
contrasted with the attitudes of
the Danish and Dutch popula
tions. In Denmark the King him
self swore ho would wear a badge
of shame if it was imposed, while
in Holland in February 1941 the

whole population came out in a
general strike aimed against the
deportation policies of the Ger
mans.
All these facts I am willing to
document, and, in spite of Mr.
Boreysza, I see no reason for
taking back a single word of my
review.
Mr. Boreysza acknowledges
that views similar to mine have
appeared in many speeches and
publications. May I submit that
the reason is simple. They hap
pen to express the truth.

TIIK TRUTH
Editor, The Daily:
In reviewing “Mein Kampf”
last week I wrote the following:
“The Warsaw ghetto would never
have been possible but for the at
titude of the Poles themselves.”
A few days later, in a letter to
The Daily. Mr. William Boreysza
called my statement “nonsense—
a peculiar Stanford interpreta
tion of history original . . .
unique.” To Mr. Boreysza my
words are so patently ridiculous
that “it is not worth arguing.”
I happen to think to the con
trary that it is worth discussing
and am willing to prove my point.

My main view is this. The worst
excesses of the Nazis against the
Jews might have been prevented
had they not found Poland itself
to be a country steeped in anti-
Semitism, and with its own long
history of pogroms. That is to
say that many parts of the popu
lation, with the notable exception
of the labor movement, tacitly ap
proved of the Nazi actions in re
gard to the Jewish populace.

Before the war there existed a
strong tradition of anti-Semitism
in Poland that found its voice in
the many extreme fascist organ
izations such as the N.D. Party.
These organizations demanded a
solution to the Jewish question
often in terms borrowed straight
from Hitler Germany.
In 1936 the Camp of National
Unification, acting under the aus
pices of the government proclaim
ed the necessity of ousting Jews
from the economic and cultural
life of the country. Some groups
demanded confiscation of Jewish
property without idemnification,
while Polish Ministers on many
occasions expressed their official
approval of a program designed
to expel all Jews from Poland.
Prior to 1939 the program of
the fascists manifested itself in
the picketing of Jewish shops,
the expulsion of Jews from uni
versities, and finally in the or
ganization of pogroms which
didn’t cease till the outbreak of
the war. This then was the pic
ture of pre-war Poland.
During the war a small minori
ty of courageous Poles as indi
viduals and as members of the
resistance helped the Jews, But
my contention is that the mass had
ceased caring so that the Nazis
were able to harvest a crop al
ready sown by the Endeks and
the Sanacja.
But when Hitler fell this was
not the end for Polish Jews. It
has been estimated that over 1,000
Jews died in waves of Polish anti-
Semitism after the war, while the
traditional pogrom was again
seen a Cracow in 1945 and Kielce
in 1946.

This bloody and shameful his
tory is all the more striking when
contrasted with the attitudes of
the Danish and Dutch popula
tions. In Denmark the King him
self swore ho would wear a badge
of shame if it was imposed, while
in Holland in February 1941 the

whole population came out in a
general strike aimed against the
deportation policies of the Ger
mans.
All these facts I am willing to
document, and, in spite of Mr.
Boreysza, I see no reason for
taking back a single word of my
review.
Mr. Boreysza acknowledges
that views similar to mine have
appeared in many speeches and
publications. May I submit that
the reason is simple. They hap
pen to express the truth.
