# THE 						BIAS CLAUSE
## On Other Campi 
### MAUREEN STRAIN Exchange Editor 
The two-foot stack of college
newspapers which has been grow
ing steadily for the past three
months on a dusty shelf in the
Daily Shack is finally being at
tacked.
The December 10 issue of the
Michigan Daily shows this inter
esting headline: “Sigma Nu; All
Deliberate Speed.”
A previous editorial had criticiz
ed both national and local policy
on the Sigma Nu “bias clause.”
In this issue, one Edmund White,
a Michigan Sigma Nu, says the
following about his chapter:
“IF I HAD to describe the cli
mate of opinion in the chapter vis
a-vis the bias clause, I should say
that there is a powerful hard-core
group of liberals, a small and not
so-vocal handful of conservatives,
and the rest.
“The rest (by far the largest
group) are frustrated, griped and
dispirited. They resist discussing
the entire issue and continue to
make merry, albeit wanly, re
minding one of those British aris
tocrats who live it up with a you
can’t-take-it-with-you frenzy in
the face of the death taxes.”
White describes his own posi
tion as “deeply embarrassed” that
his fraternity should have a bias
clause. He also says, “The local
should not be blamed for the re
actionary and unbending posture
of the national.”
THE PRESENCE of bias
clauses in constitutions of national
fraternities has been causing con
cern in various locals across the
country, including, of course, the
ATO chapter here at Stanford.
The Michigan Daily reported on
Dec. 14 that the Lambda Chi Al
pha chapter at Brown University
had applied for a waiver from ra
cial and religious restrictions im
posed by its national in member
ship selection.
Blasting the national for “the
most blatant hypocrisy in exclud
ing from membership those of
non-Caucasion and Semitic ori
gin,” the Brown chapter requested
the release due to “pressures by
responsible student organiza
tions” to abolish bias clauses,
which it “has long resented.”
THE MINNESOTA Daily, com
menting on the NAACP state
ment of disappointment with Ken
nedy’s civil rights legislation,
says “Kennedy has obviously
given up any ambitions of passing
any major civil rights legisla
tion.”
The author of the article, Mau
rice Hobbs, says that he believes

that the fault for this lies not
with Kennedy, or with the admin
istration.
“The problem, rather,” Hobbs
says, “is in the House of Repre
sentatives which, to judge from
the latest reports, is fast becom
ing a conservative domain.”
Hobbs criticizes the conserva
tive-Republican-conservative Dem
ocratic coalition for blocking civil
rights legislation which he be
lieves the Kennedy administra
tidn would readily introduce if it
had a chance of passing.
We should perhaps look at the
so-called “democratic” ideology
we profess to uphold in the world
in the light of such American in
stitutions as fraternities and the
House of Representatives.

of the national.”
THE PRESENCE of bias
clauses in constitutions of national
fraternities has been causing con
cern in various locals across the
country, including, of course, the
ATO chapter here at Stanford.
The Michigan Daily reported on
Dec. 14 that the Lambda Chi Al
pha chapter at Brown University
had applied for a waiver from ra
cial and religious restrictions im
posed by its national in member
ship selection.
Blasting the national for “the
most blatant hypocrisy in exclud
ing from membership those of
non-Caucasion and Semitic ori
gin,” the Brown chapter requested
the release due to “pressures by
responsible student organiza
tions” to abolish bias clauses,
which it “has long resented.”
THE MINNESOTA Daily, com
menting on the NAACP state
ment of disappointment with Ken
nedy’s civil rights legislation,
says “Kennedy has obviously
given up any ambitions of passing
any major civil rights legisla
tion.”
The author of the article, Mau
rice Hobbs, says that he believes

that the fault for this lies not
with Kennedy, or with the admin
istration.
“The problem, rather,” Hobbs
says, “is in the House of Repre
sentatives which, to judge from
the latest reports, is fast becom
ing a conservative domain.”
Hobbs criticizes the conserva
tive-Republican-conservative Dem
ocratic coalition for blocking civil
rights legislation which he be
lieves the Kennedy administra
tidn would readily introduce if it
had a chance of passing.
We should perhaps look at the
so-called “democratic” ideology
we profess to uphold in the world
in the light of such American in
stitutions as fraternities and the
House of Representatives.
The two-foot stack of college
newspapers which has been grow
ing steadily for the past three
months on a dusty shelf in the
Daily Shack is finally being at
tacked.
The December 10 issue of the
Michigan Daily shows this inter
esting headline: “Sigma Nu; All
Deliberate Speed.”
A previous editorial had criticiz
ed both national and local policy
on the Sigma Nu “bias clause.”
In this issue, one Edmund White,
a Michigan Sigma Nu, says the
following about his chapter:
“IF I HAD to describe the cli
mate of opinion in the chapter vis
a-vis the bias clause, I should say
that there is a powerful hard-core
group of liberals, a small and not
so-vocal handful of conservatives,
and the rest.
“The rest (by far the largest
group) are frustrated, griped and
dispirited. They resist discussing
the entire issue and continue to
make merry, albeit wanly, re
minding one of those British aris
tocrats who live it up with a you
can’t-take-it-with-you frenzy in
the face of the death taxes.”
White describes his own posi
tion as “deeply embarrassed” that
his fraternity should have a bias
clause. He also says, “The local
should not be blamed for the re
actionary and unbending posture
of the national.”
