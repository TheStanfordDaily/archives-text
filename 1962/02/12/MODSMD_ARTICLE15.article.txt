THANKS
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to thank sincere
ly the people who tried out for the
1962 Pre-Reg Committee. The
large turnout seems to indicate
that the committee is held in high
regard by the student body and
that there is a sincere interest
among students to improve the
orientation program for the in
coming freshmen.
There were so many qualified
people who tried out that we wish
the committee could be larger and
that we could have taken more of
those who tried out.
The selection of the committee
was a difficult process with such
an abundance of competent stu
dents expressing an interest in
the Pre-Reg program. We hope
that the job that the new commit
tee does will be a credit to the
Stanford student body.

Editor, The Daily:
It is almost incomprehensible
to me that Mr. Zousmer should
not have been aware of the wide
spread nature of that contempo
rary phenomenon known as the
“Twist.” One has but to watch
“Dick Clark’s Tribal Fertility
Rites” every afternoon to see the
same pex’formers (and the same
type of audience) gyrating before
an audience of millions.
The Twist has merely provided
one more way for any swivel-hip
ped idiot in tight pants to wriggle
his way to fame and fortune.
