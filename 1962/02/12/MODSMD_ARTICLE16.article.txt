# Indians Split in Los Angeles AAWU Title Prospects Dim
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Stanford’s hopes for a Big Five
basketball title were all but ex
tinguished Saturday night by a
hot-shooting, hustling UCLA
squad.
The Tribe started this all-im
portant basketball weekend in
Los Angeles by handily upsetting
seventh-ranked USC, 67 (55, Fri
day night, but then fell before the
onslaught of Bruin guard Johnny
Green’s 32-point performance and
UCLA’s 50 per cent shooting ac
curacy.
EQUALLY AS important as
UCLA’s shooting was the re
bounding of Fred Slaughter and
Pete Blackman, who continually
beat Stanford’s front line on the
boards. Their control of the of
fensive backboard resulted in sev
eral tip-ins and short follow-shots,
which contributed to the Uclans’
red-hot shooting percentage.
The Indians’ only bright spot
was in scoring where four start
ers rang up double figures with
Tom Dose and John Windsor lead
ing (he way with 23 and 13 points
respectively. Don Clemetson and
Darrell Sutherland were the
others in double figures with 10
points apiece.
Stanford definitely missed the
defensive pressure usually ap
plied by Doug Clemetson, who
suffered a broken ankle the night
before in the USC game.
BALL HAWKING AM) aggres
sive defense were the keys to the
Tribe’s victory as USC’s two high
scorers, John Rudometkin and
Chris Appel, were held to 17 and
15 points respectively. The Tro
jans were forced into 19 ball con
trol errors as opposed to only 30
for Stanford.
John Windsor completely stole
the show, scoring 27 points and
grabbing 14 rebounds. Windsor
showed great hustle in every
phase of the game, and came
through with probably his best
single performance in the most
crucial game of his college career.
He is now averaging 18 points per
game in the AAWU.
Hollis Moore, sophomore for
ward, came back from disappoint
ing performances at Washington
and Santa Clara by rolling in 11
points, grabbing seven rebounds,
and double teaming Rudometkin
while doing a good defensive job
on his own man, Ken Stanley.


A BROKEN METATARSAL bone in the left foot will sideline Stanford
back-court ace Doug Clemetson for three weeks. Clemetson suffered
the injury in the first half of the DSC basketball game Friday night.
He is hopeful of having the cast removed in time for him to play
against UCLA and USC on March 9 and 10 in the Pavilion.

Tribe’s victory as USC’s two high
scorers, John Rudometkin and
Chris Appel, were held to 17 and
15 points respectively. The Tro
jans were forced into 19 ball con
trol errors as opposed to only 30
for Stanford.
John Windsor completely stole
the show, scoring 27 points and
grabbing 14 rebounds. Windsor
showed great hustle in every
phase of the game, and came
through with probably his best
single performance in the most
crucial game of his college career.
He is now averaging 18 points per
game in the AAWU.
Hollis Moore, sophomore for
ward, came back from disappoint
ing performances at Washington
and Santa Clara by rolling in 11
points, grabbing seven rebounds,
and double teaming Rudometkin
while doing a good defensive job
on his own man, Ken Stanley.


A BROKEN METATARSAL bone in the left foot will sideline Stanford
back-court ace Doug Clemetson for three weeks. Clemetson suffered
the injury in the first half of the DSC basketball game Friday night.
He is hopeful of having the cast removed in time for him to play
against UCLA and USC on March 9 and 10 in the Pavilion.
Stanford’s hopes for a Big Five
basketball title were all but ex
tinguished Saturday night by a
hot-shooting, hustling UCLA
squad.
The Tribe started this all-im
portant basketball weekend in
Los Angeles by handily upsetting
seventh-ranked USC, 67 (55, Fri
day night, but then fell before the
onslaught of Bruin guard Johnny
Green’s 32-point performance and
UCLA’s 50 per cent shooting ac
curacy.
EQUALLY AS important as
UCLA’s shooting was the re
bounding of Fred Slaughter and
Pete Blackman, who continually
beat Stanford’s front line on the
boards. Their control of the of
fensive backboard resulted in sev
eral tip-ins and short follow-shots,
which contributed to the Uclans’
red-hot shooting percentage.
The Indians’ only bright spot
was in scoring where four start
ers rang up double figures with
Tom Dose and John Windsor lead
ing (he way with 23 and 13 points
respectively. Don Clemetson and
Darrell Sutherland were the
others in double figures with 10
points apiece.
Stanford definitely missed the
defensive pressure usually ap
plied by Doug Clemetson, who
