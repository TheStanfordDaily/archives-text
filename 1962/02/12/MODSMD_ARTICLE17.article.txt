# Frosh Bounce San Jose State
## 
### BES TIPTON 
Key splurges by Eric Loehwing
and Dick Ragsdale counterbal
anced a frosty shooting percent
age and powered the Stanford
frosh basketball forces bast San
Jose, 53-45, in the San Jose State
Gym Saturday.
San Jose maintained a slim
lead through the first ten minutes
of action, as both squads were
cold from the floor.
THE PAPOOSES’ HEIGHT ad
vantage began to show midway
through the first half, as John
Murray drilled two fall-away
.jump shots to put Stanford ahead
14-9. San Jose forged back with a
tricky weave pattern to close the
score up again, but some strong
work under the basket by Loeh
wing netted the advantage for the
Indians once more.
Thanks mainly to their superi
ority on the boards and to Loeh
wing’s spurt, the frosh were able
to leave the court at half-time
with a 23-16 lead, which is a com
manding one if you’re playing
San Jose.
The Papooses out-rebounded
the Spartans 34-12. The Stanford
squad shot only 25 per cent from
the floor and under fifty percent
from the foul line.
SAN JOSE GOT off to a fast
start in the second half with two
easy baskets, and held the Stan
ford lead to three points or less
for nearly half the period. Rags
dale drilled seven straight points
in less than a minute and a half,
though, and from then on the
Papooses were never in trouble.
The steady work of Frank Ol
rich was instrumental in the Pa
poose win. He added some power
ful rebounding to his 11 points.
Ragsdale also tanked 11. The
Cards rolled up a 58-30 rebound
advantage over the Spartans.
