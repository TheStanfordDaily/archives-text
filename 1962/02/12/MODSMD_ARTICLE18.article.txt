## 
### 
The Stanford boxers lost a close
SH-312 boxing meet Saturday
night to the University of Nevada.
The meet was held in Reno.
Stanford itself won two of three
fights, but the Indians were com
peting along with Santa Clara,
and the Broncos dragged Stan
ford down with them to defeat.
In the first Stanford bout, A1
Gaylord lost a three-round de
cision to Skip Iloak of Nevada, in
the 139-pound division.
At 156-pounds, Jerry Butts of
Stanford edged Nevada's Dave
Stix in a three-round decision.
Jerry Clough decisioned Bryan
Roarke of Nevada in the 165-
pound division, also in throe
rounds.
Heavyweights Mike Dowling of
Stanford and Jeff Alongi from

Santa Clara boxed a three-round
exhibition, as Nevada had neither
heavy nor light-heavyweight box
er. The fight went the distance to
a draw.
