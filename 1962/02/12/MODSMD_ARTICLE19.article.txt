Stanford's varsity rugby tram scored 14 points in the second
half of a match with the UCLA Bruins to rack up its fourth
straight win ol the season, a 14-3 decision over the visiting Uclans
on tlie Card rugby field iu the rain Saturday.
A preliminary match to be played between the Indian (V rugby
squad and San Jose City College^—

was called off because of bad
weather.
THE ('Anns’ WIN extended
their season’s record to four wins
against no losses in addition to
two wins in the preseason Stan
ford Rugby Carnival.
For the Bruins, it was their
first contest of the year, and the
loss leaves coach Ged Garner’s
squad with a 0-1 mark for (he sea
son.
Stanford dominated the play
for most of the first half, keeping
the ball within 30 yards of the
Uclans’ goal. Unfortunately, the
Card ruggers could never manage
a score as they had to fight a
tough Bruin defense and heavy
rain.
STAN LINDSKOG had three
opportunities at penally kicks hut
was unable to handle the wet and
slippery ball.
UCLA got the only score of the
half on a 30-yard passing rush
play about three-fourths of the
way through the period which
was good for a try by Don Vena.
Peter Nicklin’s conversion at
tempt was short and wide to leave
the Bruins’ margin at 3-0 which
lasted to the intermission.
TEN MINUTES INTO the sec
ond period the Indians got their
first points of the contest. Tom
McManus, taking over the kick
ing chores momentarily, booted
a 20-yard penalty kick that
bounced off one of the vertical
bars of the goal post before drop
ping through for the three points.
Five minutes later McManus
missed another penalty kick from
25 yards out, hut one of the UCLA
rugbymen was too close to the
ball, and Lindskog then success
fully kicked the replay from 15
yards to put the Indians out in
front by 6-3.
The Indians began to turn the
game into a rout when Peter Fa
ber slid through the mud to cap
ture the ball in the UCLA end
zone for a try after a long drib
bling rush by the Stanford for
wards.
LINDSKOG ADDED the con

version to give the Cards their
first goal and an 11-3 bulge.
Beau Bianchi, moving up from
the junior varsity, scored the last
points of the day in much the
same way as Faber.
Second 5/8 Hal Steuber kicked
a beautiful pop-kick down to the
Bruin 15-yard stripe whore it was
dribbled over the goal by the In
dian forwards. Bianchi got credit
for the try when he fell on the
ball in the end zone.
The conversion attempt by Lind
skog was wide and the Tribe had
its final 14-3 winning margin.
STANFORD COACH Pete
Kmetovic was generally pleased
with the play of his charges. He
declined to rate the Cards’ per
formance, saying (hat the wet and
muddy field made scoring as
much a matter of luck as any
thing else.
Kmetovic did praise the Indian
rugbymen, how'ever, for the con
stant pressure they put on the
Bruins, thus opening up the few
chances for point-making that did
occur.
He also gave plaudits to the ef
forts of Tim Hansel and Bob
Price in the backfield and Dick
Leeuwenberg in the line.
The Cards resume action next
Saturday at San Francisco in a
rematch with the San Francisco
Olympic Club.
