# Med Student Dies In 50 Foot Tumble
## 
### 
A medical student was killed yesterday morning during an
Alpine Club practice climb at Hunter’s Mill, north of Vallejo.
William S. (Rick) Litferick Jr., 24, 1477 Portola Road, fell
about 50 feet and was bit by rocks while climbing with ropes on
a cliff face shortly before noon yesterday. Other climbers admin-

istered first aid and mouth-to
mouth resuscitation until a doc
tor, flown in by helicopter an
hour and a half later, pronounced
Litterick ‘‘dead for some time.”
Litterick, a Princeton graduate,
entered Stanford in 1959 and was
in his second year at the Medical
School after spending last sum
mer travelling and climbing
abroad.
His parents live in Keuka Park,
New York, where his father is
president of Keuka College, a
girls’ finishing school.
Litterick, climbing with equip
ment up a cliff face, was lied to
George Pastor, a San Francisco
State student, on the ground be
low, and had passed the overhang
of the cliff, the most difficult
part, when he fell, according to
John Neale, freshman Alpine Club
member. Neale said he saw Lit
terick ‘‘falling with all this rock
following him”; the rope, held
by pitons driven into the cliff
broke his fall, but a rock follow
ing him hit him in the head.
Neale said Litterick must have
reached up for a hand hold when
the rock came loose and hit him.
Neale figured wind and rain must
have loosened the rock.
Litterick was among about 10
Stanford Alpine Club members
who left campus early yesterday
j morning to practice-climb on the
I cliff. Litterick was ‘‘probably the
most experienced and cautious
climber in the group,” Neale said.
Neale said Litterick had been
| climbing about seven years and
had climbed in Pakistan this sum
mer and was almost ready to go
on a Himalayan climb.
Neale said Litterick was doing
a more difficult kind of climb
than usual practice climbs, when
a rope is thrown down from
above, the kind which must be
done in real mountain climbing.
Other members of the club
group were doing standard prac
tice climbs in the same area.
Litterick had made several films
and had planned to do one on
mountain climbing techniques,
Seymour Kolko, Medical School
assistant dean for student affairs
said. Kolko called Litterick “very
well liked.”
