# Debaters Win in Successful Eastern Tour
## 
### 
Stanford’s debate team returned
to the warm climates today after
almost two weeks in the chilly
East on a speaking lour which
ranks as one of the most success
ful in Farm forensic history.
The pair, juniors Mike Hall and
Chuck Bischoff, took part in two
national tournaments as well as
addressing four groups of Stan
ford alums. Their overall record
for the tour of 17 wins against
three losses in national compe
tition is the best compiled by any
Stanford debate team in recent
memory.
Over the weekend, the debaters
argued at Northwestern and
placed 9th behind North Texas
State in a field of 94 teams. In
the preliminaries Thursday and
Friday, Hall and Bischoff defeat
ed Dartmouth, Nebraska, Illinois,
Notre Dame, Kansas State of Em
poria, Brigham Young and North
ern Illinois. The only decision
they dropped was to Oshkosh Col
lege. Saturday, in the final elim
inations, the Indian debaters lost
on a 2-1 judges’ vote to the same
Kansas State team they had de
feated the day before.
At Harvard the previous week
end, Stanford placed slightly
higher, winning third in an inter
national field of 103. The debaters
outtalked Loyola of Chicago, St.
Michael’s, Wayne State, Ford
horn. McGill, Boston College, Os
good Hall Law School (of Toron
to), and the University of Chicago
in the prelims. In the final elim
inations they set back Brigham
Young and Georgetown before
losing out to Eastern Nazarene
in the semifinals.

one win and seven losses. They
