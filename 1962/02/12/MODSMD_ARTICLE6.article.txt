# Varied Winter One-Acts Enjoyable Theater Evening
## 
### BRIDGET HURSLEY DOBSON 
The three plays in Winter One Acts, 1962, add
up to a potpourri of moods and themes— and a
thoroughly enjoyable theater evening. The plays
are written by students and produced by Sue
Davidson of Ram’s Head. Each play, without being
an artistic masterpiece, makes its own special con
tribution to the flavor of the evening’s entertain
ment.
The first of the three, “Friends of the Uni
verse.’’ by Judy Skinner, serves to whet the appe
tite. This comedy-wilh-a-point, under the direction
of Moses Goldberg, gently pokes fun at a teenage
girl and her family who, one evening, make a
special effort to be unprejudiced toward “darkies.”
-HiVI FADIMAN, who plays the father, Mr. King,
has most of the funny lines, and ho says them with
off-hand comic finesse. He doesn’t miss a chance at
getting the humor of the situation, and to a great
extent the scene is his.
Mary Lou, the daughter, is played by Sallie
Cross. From this young girl’s point of view, the
evening is very serious indeed. Miss Cross does a
competent job of acting, although several times
she almost loses control of her characterization by
succumbing to the humor of the situation.
Rudy Morris plays Josh, the Negro guest with
a good sense of humor (“I’ll have my coffee Cau
casian.”). In his role, Mr. Morris is quite convinc
ingly a teenage hipster with a vague socialistic air
about him.
IF, ON occasion, the director leaves his actors
stranded awkwardly center stage without much
reason for being there, the interference is negli
gible and does not spoil the fun.
"The Inquisition,” by David Kirk, is a play of
more substance and serves well as the evening's
entree. This somber drama, directed by Susan
James, is concerned with the contradictions in the
personality of the Inquisitor.
Victor Emeljanow, as the conscience-tormented

Inquisitor, does an excellent job of acting. He man
ages to reflect a variety of different shades of
character: strength in the execution of his church
duties, weakness when faced with his misdeeds,
and pride and fear of his accomplishments as
Inquisitor.
IN THE role of Sister Maria, a nun who was
once- and still is—in love with the Inquisitor, Su
san Lcich is believably tender and forgiving. Larry
Alioto is apppropriate in the part of Don Gregorio,
the father of the Inquisitor. And Michael Percival,
the Prosecutor, is very much what a prosecutor
ought to be.
The play itself is moving, for the most part.
At moments it is trite, especially in its use of the
symbolism of light and dark. The fragmentary
sets by Susan James are quite effective in setting
the mood for the drama.
“As I Was Going to St. Ives,” by Judy Shrader,
is a play with still a different flavor. It is a 19th
century drawing room comedy with murder sea
soning. The play, directed by David Kirk, occasion
ally becomes bogged In chit-chat among the Dukes
and Duchesses-and Lords and Ladies. But the situ
ation is intrinsically funny, and it has as many
twists as a corkscrew. With a little judicious prun
ing. the play might be very good indeed.
CAROL Oliver in the role of Georgians, an
aristocratic but “nasty-minded little bitch,” gives
such a fine performance that she steals the show.
Indeed, it is when she is not on stage that the play
seems to drag a bit.
The supporting cast of aristocrats manages to
be both stuffy and humorous, despite their be
draggled costumes.
The set, which plays a major role in the
mystery, is effectively designed by Jim Lyon.
The play continues next Friday and Saturday.
Tickets are available for $1.50 at the Memorial
Box office from 9-3 and at lire Rant’s Head office
from 3-5.
