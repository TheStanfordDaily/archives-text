# LASSU Com Shapes New Constitution
## 
### 
Legislature will hold the first
of several extraordinary meetings
tonight to consider the proposed
new ASSU Constitution.
The drafting sessions will in
volve examining the proposed sec
tions of the new documents and
tentatively accepting or revising
them. The suggested executive
and judiciary parts of the consti
tution will come under LASSU’s
scrutiny tonight. They are the
first two sections of the proposed
constitution to be put into form
for submission to Legislature.
ASSU President Bob Saylor set
up the special committee last fall
to revise the present constitution
to give students a more effective
voice in University affairs.
SUBCOMMITTEES of the main
committee have been at work
drafting sections for the recamp
ed constitution. The main com
mittee has passed the executive
and judiciary parts. Financial,
legislative and publications ar
ticles are in the process of final
drafting and will go before
LASSU in the coming weeks.
Many new ideas are included
in the rewriting of the old con
stitution.
One which will be discussed to
night is the idea of a first vice
president, who would be elected
and serve as speaker of the Legis
lature. The ASSU president cur
rently does this.
A second vice president would
be elected and would handle the
duties of the present vice presi
dent.
Another idea is to give the pres
ident more executive powers than
he now holds.
A STUDENT ATTORNEY gen
eral who would refer offenders
of the Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard to the appropri
ate judicial council and handle
other “policing” duties, also has
been suggested.
A proposed change in the judi
ciary setup would establish a
joint student-faculty council
which would be the court of high
est appeal from the various judi
cial councils. A streamlining of
present judicial bodies also is
proposed.
These and other suggestions,
none of which is final yet, will be
discussed at LASSU’s extraordi
nary sessions in the next few
weeks. Action on the new consti
tution will be taken at LASSU’s
regular Thursday meetings.
