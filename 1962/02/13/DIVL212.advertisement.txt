0 INDIANS,
Tomorrow is Valen
tine’s day, & anyone
who forgot raise his
right Hand (okay,
your left hand then).
But, take heart
(that's a pun), you
still have a chance
to redeem yourselves
(like saving’s stamps)
for good old R/A
has some great items
for you to give to
that very special
man (or men). Come
in and see.
