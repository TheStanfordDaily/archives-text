# Results of Coeducational Housing Study Disclosed

(Editor's Note: This is the second in a
series on coeducational university housing.
Today’s article is on Stanford reaction to the
plan.)

Last Saturday, the LASSU Committee for
Undergraduates mot with a number of facul
ty members to discuss the possibility of in
troducing a coed housing program to the
Stanford campus.
The members of the committee agreed
upon a very definite need for such a program
at Stanford. A member of the committee.
Sally Sievers, divided the reasons into two
groups.
The first is a social reason. The coed
system at Stanford "would provide a more
pleasant, more relaxed atmosphere for boy
girl contact.” She felt that in a dating re
lationship, both boy and girl are usually so
concerned with making “a good impression,
being fun, being socially attractive, that
really getting to know each other comfort
ably is difficult. Dating at Stanford is often a
status search and exchanges become a look
overt he-crop-and-pick-the-best-you-can-get af
fair."
“IN A coeducational living group the

mere fact of living and eating together would
foster friendships between people who might
never date each other, and allow people who
would normally be considered socially be
yond the pale or who have little time for
social activity to have contact with people of
the opposite sex,” she said.
The second group of reasons was intellec
tual. Miss Sievers felt that integrated living
eliminates a lot of the emotional tension
which exists in many boy-girl relationships
and therefore would allow for more intellec
tual exchange.
“ONE IMPORTANT aim of the residence
program,” she said, “is to provide an oppor
tunity for students of different backgrounds,
ideas, and motivations to live together in a
learning situation—a learning process in it
self. Why should three-fourths or one
fourth of the student body be unavailable as
a ready source of information and stimula
tion to an individual because it is simply of
the opposite sex?”
Allard K. Lowenstein, Ass’t. Dean of Men
and Director of Stern Hall, has said that he
was “convinced of the educational value of
coed housing.”
Julie Shearer, committee member and
sponsor at Roble, said, “A discouraging num-

ber of men and women never learn to take
each other for granted as intelligent and
spirited human beings. To segregate on the
basis of sex and thus encourage the separa
tion of the social from the Intellectual is, in
effect, an endorsement of the present defects
in the social situation at Stanford. That is:
relations between men and women tend to
be either politely detached ‘good friends’ or
romantic. There is no reason why this primi
tive and unreal social situation should con
tinue to exist at Stanford.”
WILLIAM G. Craig, dean of men, has
said that he is generally in favor of coed
housing. He felt that a coed housing system
would help develop the proper kind of “intel
lectual atmosphere.” He said that “where
the students live is now too separated from
where they do other things.” He fell that the
unnatural men-women relationships should
not exist as they do at Stanford. “A coed
system would need faculty participation,
books, lounges, and a variety of people,” he
said.

Dean of Women Lucile A, Allen does not
feel that she is ready to give any kind of
statement about the possibility of coed hous
ing at Stanford because she does not have
enough information about it. She said that

she had tried to ask questions about coed
housing, but “no one seems to have the
answers.”

DR. RALITI Smith, the chairman of the
faculty Committee on Undergraduate Hous
ing was, last week, unable to give a com
ment, because “the problem had not yet been
discussed.”

The LASSU Committee cited the foreign
campuses and other campuses as examples
of how well the coed housing system can
work. Dean Allen has warned, however, that
the overseas campus situation is not like that
on the main campus. She said that the en
vironment and situation are in many impor
tant respects, different. These differences
make coed housing here and coed housing
overseas not entirely comparable.
PROF. WAYNE S. Vucinlch, Prof, of His
tory. present at the Saturday meeting, was
not convinced of the value of coed housing
plan as he had seen it overseas. He had no
ticed many small groups forming among
themselves within the bigger group which
disputes the idea of increased friendly rela
tionships.
The committee felt that at the overseas
campuses many people who were not in fa
vor of coed housing had made the sacrifice

in order to go overseas. They felt that that
problem would be eliminated here because
only those that volunteered to live in coed
housing would have to do so. These people,
they felt, would be in favor of the system
and try to make it work,
TIIK MEMBERS of the committee felt
that the advantages of having coed housing
were many. Rob Carpenter, a member of the
Committee, noted that the influence of wom
en present during meals can be seen at Stern,
which now has women hashers. “While there
was at least one food fight a week and a
tremendous amount of noise and crudity dur
ing the meals before the women came, there
have been no food fights and much less noise
since the women hashers have been there.”
The committee emphasized that if coed
housing were Instituted there would still bo
facilities on campus for those who did not
want to live under that system.
The committee also emphasized the need
for not only proximity, but adequate coed
dining and recreational facilities.
Mrs. Robert S. Sears, Prof, of Education,
also present at the meeting, emphasized the
need for flexibility in coed construction plans.
