11. Jackson Fortsman, “Word and
Spirit. Calvin’s Doctrine of Bib
lical Authority” (Stanford Uni
versity Press, 1962).
By LEWIS VV. SPITZ
Associate Professor of History
This is a book for the profes
sional theologian or for the un
usually bright amateur, of whom
there is said to be a very consid
erable number in the Stanford
population.
Both the revival of Reforma
tion studies and the concerns of
contemporary theology under the
impact of the Neo-orthodox move
ment have focussed renewed at- .
tention upon the thought of the ■
reformers. Moreover,
the current ecumenical dialogue ,
between Protestants and Catho- ,
lies has once again pointed up I he i
significance of the problem of au
thority for religious thought. For
example. George Tavard, distin
guished Catholic scholar, in his
book “Holy Writ or Holy ,
Church.” raises the question of ,
the sufficiency of the Protestant
principle of Sola Scriptura and
the role of “tradition” in authori
tative interpretation. ,
FORSTMAN turns for fresh in- ;
sights to Calvin, the continental ’
reformer whom Melanchthon al
ready in his own day tagged as
“the theologian.” He puts to Cal- (
vin the same basic question posed ,
by Calvin’s own most pertinacious ,
critic, Sebastion Castellio, who
asked: “Who shall be judge?”- ,
Forstman rejects the attempts .
of Calvin specialists to center the i
whole corpus of his thought ;
around one central theme and to
relate all aspects of his theology ;
to a single leitmotif. Calvin as a 1
Biblical theologian sought to set i
all the major themes of the Scrip- ]
times side by side, an approach i

which makes his principle of au
thority all the more determina
tive.
FORSTMAN perceives an im
plicit distinction in Calvin’s use
; of his principle of authority re
flecting a kind of dual epistemol
| ogy. There is one way of knowing
for faith in the Word and in the
promises of grace (essentially fi
ducia, trust, not credulitas, belief)
and another for a wider knowl
edge of those things which are
contained in God’s word and
which are believed on another
level. Both of these epistemolo
gies are derived from the same
statement of authority, namely,
the correlation of word and Spirit.
The relevance of this suggestion
for contemporary theology illus
trates the value of this study in
historical theology.
In discussing the work of the
Spirit in the Biblical writers the
author marks a clear trail
through the labyrinth of scholar
ly literature on the nature and
extent of inspiration. In the heart
of the believer the Spirit works
faith, regeneration, illumination,
and a spirit of discernment. The
author candidly acknowledges
Calvin’s difficulty in verifying au
thority outside of the word and
the Spirit, that is, in communicat
ing publicly.
THE AUTHOR’S discussion of
Calvin’s ideas on the content and
character of knowledge possesses
the rare virtue of coupling lucid
ity with succinctness. The chap
ter on the peculiarities of Calvin’s
exegesis provides a fascinating
account of the difficulties into
which his own hermeneutical
principles led him.
In the epilogue on Calvin, later
Calvinism, and the contemporary
situation Forstman boldly spells
out the implications of his venture
into the past for present day the
ology as represented primarily by
Karl Barth and Rudolph Bult
mann, two giants on the Europe
an scene.
He is certainly the man to do
yet another volume relating Cal
vin the interpreter and theologian
to the Renaissance philology and
philosophy of the world of hu
manism from which Calvin came.

By LEWIS VV. SPITZ
Associate Professor of History
This is a book for the profes
sional theologian or for the un
usually bright amateur, of whom
there is said to be a very consid
erable number in the Stanford
population.
Both the revival of Reforma
tion studies and the concerns of
contemporary theology under the
impact of the Neo-orthodox move
ment have focussed renewed at- .
tention upon the thought of the ■
reformers. Moreover,
the current ecumenical dialogue ,
between Protestants and Catho- ,
lies has once again pointed up I he i
significance of the problem of au
thority for religious thought. For
example. George Tavard, distin
guished Catholic scholar, in his
book “Holy Writ or Holy ,
Church.” raises the question of ,
the sufficiency of the Protestant
principle of Sola Scriptura and
the role of “tradition” in authori
tative interpretation. ,
FORSTMAN turns for fresh in- ;
sights to Calvin, the continental ’
reformer whom Melanchthon al
ready in his own day tagged as
“the theologian.” He puts to Cal- (
vin the same basic question posed ,
by Calvin’s own most pertinacious ,
critic, Sebastion Castellio, who
asked: “Who shall be judge?”- ,
Forstman rejects the attempts .
of Calvin specialists to center the i
whole corpus of his thought ;
around one central theme and to
relate all aspects of his theology ;
to a single leitmotif. Calvin as a 1
Biblical theologian sought to set i
all the major themes of the Scrip- ]
times side by side, an approach i

which makes his principle of au
thority all the more determina
tive.
FORSTMAN perceives an im
plicit distinction in Calvin’s use
; of his principle of authority re
flecting a kind of dual epistemol
| ogy. There is one way of knowing
for faith in the Word and in the
promises of grace (essentially fi
ducia, trust, not credulitas, belief)
and another for a wider knowl
edge of those things which are
contained in God’s word and
which are believed on another
level. Both of these epistemolo
gies are derived from the same
statement of authority, namely,
the correlation of word and Spirit.
The relevance of this suggestion
for contemporary theology illus
trates the value of this study in
historical theology.
In discussing the work of the
Spirit in the Biblical writers the
author marks a clear trail
through the labyrinth of scholar
ly literature on the nature and
extent of inspiration. In the heart
of the believer the Spirit works
faith, regeneration, illumination,
and a spirit of discernment. The
author candidly acknowledges
Calvin’s difficulty in verifying au
thority outside of the word and
the Spirit, that is, in communicat
ing publicly.
THE AUTHOR’S discussion of
Calvin’s ideas on the content and
character of knowledge possesses
the rare virtue of coupling lucid
ity with succinctness. The chap
ter on the peculiarities of Calvin’s
exegesis provides a fascinating
account of the difficulties into
which his own hermeneutical
principles led him.

11. Jackson Fortsman, “Word and
Spirit. Calvin’s Doctrine of Bib
lical Authority” (Stanford Uni
versity Press, 1962).
By LEWIS VV. SPITZ
Associate Professor of History
This is a book for the profes
sional theologian or for the un
usually bright amateur, of whom
there is said to be a very consid
erable number in the Stanford
population.
Both the revival of Reforma
tion studies and the concerns of
contemporary theology under the
impact of the Neo-orthodox move
ment have focussed renewed at- .
tention upon the thought of the ■
reformers. Moreover,
the current ecumenical dialogue ,
between Protestants and Catho- ,
lies has once again pointed up I he i
significance of the problem of au
thority for religious thought. For
example. George Tavard, distin
guished Catholic scholar, in his
book “Holy Writ or Holy ,
Church.” raises the question of ,
the sufficiency of the Protestant
principle of Sola Scriptura and
the role of “tradition” in authori
tative interpretation. ,
FORSTMAN turns for fresh in- ;
sights to Calvin, the continental ’
reformer whom Melanchthon al
ready in his own day tagged as
“the theologian.” He puts to Cal- (
vin the same basic question posed ,
by Calvin’s own most pertinacious ,
critic, Sebastion Castellio, who
asked: “Who shall be judge?”- ,
Forstman rejects the attempts .
of Calvin specialists to center the i
whole corpus of his thought ;
around one central theme and to
relate all aspects of his theology ;
to a single leitmotif. Calvin as a 1
Biblical theologian sought to set i
all the major themes of the Scrip- ]
times side by side, an approach i

which makes his principle of au
thority all the more determina
tive.
FORSTMAN perceives an im
plicit distinction in Calvin’s use
; of his principle of authority re
flecting a kind of dual epistemol
| ogy. There is one way of knowing
for faith in the Word and in the
promises of grace (essentially fi
ducia, trust, not credulitas, belief)
and another for a wider knowl
edge of those things which are
contained in God’s word and
which are believed on another
level. Both of these epistemolo
gies are derived from the same
statement of authority, namely,
the correlation of word and Spirit.
The relevance of this suggestion
for contemporary theology illus
trates the value of this study in
historical theology.
In discussing the work of the
Spirit in the Biblical writers the
author marks a clear trail
through the labyrinth of scholar
ly literature on the nature and
extent of inspiration. In the heart
of the believer the Spirit works
faith, regeneration, illumination,
and a spirit of discernment. The
author candidly acknowledges
Calvin’s difficulty in verifying au
thority outside of the word and
the Spirit, that is, in communicat
ing publicly.
THE AUTHOR’S discussion of
Calvin’s ideas on the content and
character of knowledge possesses
the rare virtue of coupling lucid
ity with succinctness. The chap
ter on the peculiarities of Calvin’s
exegesis provides a fascinating
account of the difficulties into
which his own hermeneutical
principles led him.
In the epilogue on Calvin, later
Calvinism, and the contemporary
situation Forstman boldly spells
out the implications of his venture
into the past for present day the
ology as represented primarily by
Karl Barth and Rudolph Bult
mann, two giants on the Europe
an scene.
He is certainly the man to do
yet another volume relating Cal
vin the interpreter and theologian
to the Renaissance philology and
philosophy of the world of hu
manism from which Calvin came.
