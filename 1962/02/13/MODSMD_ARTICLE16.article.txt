# Indian Sharpshooters Win Every Match Despite Most Run-down Range in League
## 
### BILL BRINR 
(Sports Editor's Note; Bill
Brink is a member of the Stan
ford Varsity Rifle Team presently
participating in inter-collegiate
competition.)

The 10-man varsity rifle team
which represents Stanford in in
tercollegiate competition is pres
ently leading the league, having
won every match this year. The
team has posted the highest team
and some of the highest individu
al averages in the league.
They have done this in spite of
the fact (hat they must work out
in the worst conditions in the
league.

I Mi. 151, rifle and pistol marks
manship, is one of the most popu-1
lar of the P.K. programs, with ap
proximately 210 people enrolled!
in some phase of it this quarter.
Most of these are ROTC students, <
This isn’t because other students |
aren’t interested, but because
there is no room, nor instructors, j
to handle more.
All those who use the range, | t
but are not doing so as part of an I
ROTC program, are members of I
the Stanford Varsity Rifle and'
Pistol Club. The purpose of the,'
organization is to give the shoot-M
ers and organization and also to U
raise funds for the support of the | 1
rifle and pistol teams. Each mem
ber of the club pays dues of $2
per quarter.
This money goes toward trip
expenses, ammunition and equip-, (
ment for (he teams. Also, civilian
shooters are required to pay for
the ammunition and targets
which they use. Most of the am-1
munition, targets, weapons, and
| shooting jackets is purchased by
the Army and Navy.
THE RIFLE RANKE at Stan-!
i ford is located in a building erect- ;
j ed by the Army in 1917 as a tern- !
porary structure for the stabling
( of horses belonging to an artillery i
| unit. Later it was used as stables
I for the polo team.
At present, the building is in a
I very dilapidated state, due to a
| persistent refusal by the univer-
I sity to update the facilities or to
| do more than the minimum
amount of repair work necessary
j to keep the range functioning
j barely.
At the larger rifle matches,
those requiring an umpire, the
range is almost invariably given
a rating of “substandard.”
THE ROOF HAS many large
, holes in it. as well as innumerable
small ones. The walls are full of
cracks and holes. The lighting is
;extremely poor, though not as bad
as it once was. This improvement
is mostly due to the efforts of the
range NCO, Sgt. Joe Hawkins.
The building is a fire trap. That
was proven a week ago Saturday, 1
when one etui of the range burned
! down.
These conditions are not the j
fault of the people Who run the
rifle range. Unfortunately, Sgt.
Hawkins and Sgt. Joe Romanello
have the responsibility for the
range, hut no authority to im
prove conditions. However, it is
not the purpose of this article to
: find fault.
Everything becomes painfully
obvious to anyone who visits the
range.
RATHER I SHOULD like 1o
make some definite proposals
which seem fair to all involved,
and which will, in the long run.
save the school money assuming
that Stanford is still interested
in entering the rifle team in inter
collegiate rifle competition.

Six private rifle clubs use the
Stanford range on weekday eve
nings. For this privilege they
must pay a total of $.300 per
month. Up to now, little, if any,
of this money has been pul back

into the range and equipment. I
would propose that a new rifle
range he built with the money
paid by these local rifle clubs for
the use of the campus range fa
cilities.
A concrete block structure
could be erected upon the foun
dations of the present building
at a cost of $lO,OOO to $15,000. The
whole project could be completed

during the summer months with
out disrupting the present pro
gram. At the rate of $.300 per
month for only 10 mon'hs of the
year, the new building would
have paid for itself within five

years.
THERE IS NO reason why,
with the ROTC units footing the
bill for the operation of (he range
and the university making money
from it, the university should hes
itate to replace the ancient, un
safe rifle range with a new build
ing. to be paid for out of funds
for its rental.
This writer would hazard a

predirt ion 111 a 1 at least some of
these local clubs that rent the
present building, would be willing
to make a substantial monetary
advance on future rent, if the
money went for a new range.
