## Revision of Judiciary Under Consideration 
### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
An extensive revamping of the
ASSU judiciary system was under
discussion last night by the ASSU
constitution committee.
The meeting was the first of a
series of meetings set up to revise
the constitution to give students
a more effective voice in deter
mining University affairs.
The constitutional revision pre
sented last night by Jim Woolsey
provides for more student juris
diction in disciplinary actions.
The hope is to have students han
dle discipline and leave the deans
to do more counseling work.
The revised section of the con
stitution will be; voted on by
LASSU on Thursday night. If
passed by a two-thirds vote, the
section will be included in the new
constitution to be presented to the
student body for a two-thirds vote
ratification.
Major changes in the judiciary
system include:
1) The establishment of a Stu
dent Judicial Coordinator. This
position would be advisery, with
out specific power. The position
would be created as a means to
keep the judicial system running
smoothly. “Student self-discipline
cannot function without such a
position” ASSU President Bob
Saylor slated. The Judicial Co
ordinator would decide which of
the many student courts should
take a case. He would further act
as an “initiator of action,” accept
ing complaints and advising
courts on reviewing cases handled
unsatisfactorily by lower courts.
These duties are now handled by
the deans.
2> The expansion of Men’s and
Women’s Councils from five to
six members. Woolsey comment
ed, “In the past Men’s Council
has been accused of a bias, of be
ing controlled by the fraternities
or by one fraternity.” The re
vision proposes to elect two Men’s

Council members from the fra
ternities, the eating clubs and
those without affiliation, thus
eliminating the bias.
3) The establishment of a
Joint Student-Faculty Council
| which would have final ruling on
I cases involving suspension or ex
i pulsion. Here, again, responsibili
ties now accorded to the deans
I would be shouldered by students.
4) The maintenance of records
j of all cases. This is not done now.
Although the cases would be re
{corded without names, Woolsey
| felt that records of cases would
| allow more standardization on
court decisions from year to year,
providing precedents to guide the
| courts.
The question of whether a stu
[ dent called before a court will
| have the right to face his accuser
I was left unresolved. Students do
| not have such rights now.
