### 
NEW ORLEANS (UPI) The
U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Ap
peals yesterday refused to grant
an emergency injunction to allow
Negro James Meredith to attend
the all-white University of Missis
sippi.
The three-judge panel, with
Chief Judge Elbert Tuttle of At
lanta dissenting, ruled that it
could not grant the temporary in
junction without studying the full
record of the case. The court of
Appeals did, however, order a
quick hearing of the appeal on
its merits.
The court ruled that Meredith
could preserve his right to be ad
mitted to the University of Missis
sippi later by withdrawing from
Jackson, Miss. State College this
spring.
Meredith is scheduled for grad
uation from Jackson in June and
his attorneys have said that by
denying him admission to the uni
versity this month, the state of
Mississippi was forcing him to
graduate from an “inferior”
school.
Meredith sought the temporary
injunction against Ole Miss offi
cials so he could enter the school
by Feb. 15, the final day for ad
mission in the spring semester.
U.S. District Judge Sidney
Mize ruled earlier that Meredith
was not being denied admission
on the basis of his race. It was
this ruling Meredith was appeal
ing here.
