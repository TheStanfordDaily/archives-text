# Powers’ Liberation Minimized by Rusk
## Rusk Rejects Request For Summit Conference 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Secre
tary of State Dean Rusk said last
night that Russia’s release of U2
flier Francis Gary Powers does
not in itself move us “very far in
the issues that divide the Commu
nist and the free worlds.”
Rusk said that it is of some
advantage to get “unnecessary ir
ritations” out of the way. “But I
would not draw any conclusions
from this return of Mr. Powers
with respect to situations like
Berlin or Southeast Asia,” he add
ed.”
The secretary made the state
ments when questioned during an
interview on Westinghouse Broad
casting’s “Washington View
point."
This development in the Powers
case came after the Senate For
eign Relations Committee asked
for a full report on what Powers
tells government investigators
who have concealed him behind a
screen of secrecy.
Sen. John J. Sparkman, D-Ala.,
acting chairman of the Senate
group, disclosed in a letter to
Rusk that preliminary arrange
ments already have been made to
obtain details of Powers’ story.
Rusk was asked whether the
release of Powers was a propa
ganda play on the part of Russia
or an indication of a real desire
to come to solid agreement on
outstanding East - West differ
ences.
Rusk said ho was glad, of
course, about the release of Pow
ers and an American student,
Frederic Pryor.
Rusk went on to reject Nikita
Khrushchev’s bid for a summit
conference on disarmament next
month but left the door ajar for
such a meeting later if there is
progress in resolving East-West
differences.
He said the United States and

Russia already were in “substan
tial agreement on a number of
underlying principles affecting
disarmament.” The main point
still to be resolved, he said, is
some system to make sure no na
tion is duped as disarmament pro
ceeds.
But he ruled out Khrushchev’s
proposal for an 18-nation heads
of-government meeting in Geneva
March 14, saying that what is
needed now is “some systematic,
serious, hard and determined” ne
gotiation at lower diplomatic
levels to pave the way to a later
summit meeting.
In connection with his call for
serious lower-level negotiations,
the secretary noted that President
Kennedy and British Prime Minis
ter Harold Macmillan proposed to
Khrushchev last week that the
foreign ministers meet in connec
tion with the Geneva disarma
ment sessions scheduled to open
Monday. Meanwhile, it became
known that the initial attitude of
administration officials is as fol
lows: —They welcomed the fact
that Khrushchev’s reply to a Feb.
7 suggestion by President Ken
nedy and British Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan for a foreign
ministers meeting on disarma
ment was positive and differed
only on the level of the talks.
—But they took the view that
a disarmament conference at the
summit which became deadlocked
at the start could bo a grave set
back for disarmament prospects.
As for a summit conference
later, the administration appeared
to condition any agreement on
two factors progress by the for
eign ministers and continued re
duction of East-West tensions.
