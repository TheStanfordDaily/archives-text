THE STAGE
Once Upon a Mattress Opera
Ring (San Francisco).
A delightful parody on Victor
Herbert musicals (the princess is
awkward and athletic and the
prince is gawking and gangly),
based on the fairy tale of the
Princess and the Pea. A must for
those who like musicals and those
who hate them.
THE SCREEN
One, Two Three and Separate
Tables Laurel (San Carlos).
A great double bill of a very
funny movie and a very dramatic
one (in which David Niven gives
one of the screen’s great per
formances) is a possibility this
weekend. On the other hand you
could see “One, Two, Three’’ and
“Twenty Plus Two” at the Var
sity.
Suddenly Last Summer Memori
al Auditorium (Sunday).
A hint of cannibalism, a hint of
homosexuality and much moi’e
than a hint of Elizabeth Taylor
spice up this flick based on some
thing or other by Tennessee Wil
liams. We’re going back to see if
Liz’ bathing suit stays up this

TELEVISION
Tour of the White House Wed.
10 p.m., (NBC, CBS I.
“We're being pre-empted this
week,” said Bob Newhart. “Jackie
Kennedy would like to show you
the White House and I said . . .
‘by all means.’ ”
Boston Symphony - Fri., 9 p.m.
(Channel 9).
A two-hour concert of Smetana,
Beethoven, Prokofiev and Tche
repning should satiate the music
lovers who can't get to the City
to hear Glenn Gould.
The Defenders Sat., 8:30 p.m.
(CBS i.

! This Reginald (“Twelve Angry
Men”) Rose production is proof
that all television needs is a few
competent writers and the will
ingness every so often to say
something that more than two
per cent of the viewers might dis
agree with. A courtroom drama
that makes Perry Mason seem
like an afternoon soap opera, this
is probably the best dramatic
series on television.
THE PRESS
The National Review— Feb. 13.
It pains us to recommend that
you give Buckley money to find
out what he's thinking these days,
but this issue has a long editorial
which comes to the considered
conclusion that, although many
fine and noble people belong to
! the John Birch Society, Robert
Welch has gone too far.
Esquire March.
This issue of what is now a
I consistently fine magazine has a
| sad touching article called, "The
Abraham Lincoln Brigade Revis
ited.” The Spanish Civil War still
affects the lives of many of the
members of this battalion, even if
it only takes the form of a cat
and-mouse game with the Subver
sive Activities Control Board.
Jose Greco Curran (Today
through Feb. 18).
The man who glares at the floor
like he’s mad at it and his troupe
of Spanish dancers will make
hash of the Curran’s floor. The
audiences won’t mind, though.
Joan Baez Berkeley Community
Theater (Saturday).
The “Joan of Arc” of folk sing
ing gives her only Bay Area con
cert in Berkeley this year. She’s
about the most commercial folk
pel-former this side of the King
ston Trio, but the comparison
ends there. A real find, this girl.
