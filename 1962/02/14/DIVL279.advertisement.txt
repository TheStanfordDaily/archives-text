Portrait of a con
servative. Not a
political type, an
Ivy Leaguer. It’s
funny that lots of
Natural Shoulder
buffs aren’t consis
tently conservative.
For instance, they’ll
use most any cologne
or after shave, no
matter the scent. We
suggest Valentine’s
as the day to start
using a conservative
lotion, Dunhill.
