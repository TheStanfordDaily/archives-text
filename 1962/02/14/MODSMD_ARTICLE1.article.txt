# Foreign Student Resources Being Tapped, But Only Shallowly
## 
### KAREN SHELLABAKGER 
Last January 26 over 750 diplomats, poli
ticians, community leaders and students
crowded into the Gold Room of the Sheraton-
Palace Hotel to enjoy Stanford's first Inter
national Ball.
Twenty-two consul-generals attended, the
largest number ever recorded at any one
function of this typo sponsored by any or
ganize Mon in the bay area. Mayor Christo
pher sent his wishes by telegram and Gov
ernor Brown expressed deep regrets that he
would not be able to attend until very late.
Over 50 peninsula families attended the ball
as patrons.
It has been said that this activity was the
most successful combined all-campus and
community dance ever sponsored by a stu
dent organization at Stanford. Wo can some
what judge the validity of this opinion by
looking at the impact of the ball on other
campuses. The University of California has
just announced plans for its first internation
al ball to be held in May at the Sheraton-
Palace Hotel. It is rumored that San Jose
State might attempt a similar activity in the

near future.
THE PHENOMENAL success of the In
ternational Club's first annual ball clearly in
dicates a growing concern for international
students and an awareness of their potenti
alities, not only here at Stanford but also in
the community.
Stanford students are slowly becoming
aware of the wealth of knowledge and un
derstanding to be gained from association
with our foreign guests. This campus is the
academic home for more than 640 foreign
students from 73 foreign countries. These
students of different educational and cultural
backgrounds come to the United States to
learn about American life and the process of
ducation at a top-rate American University.
They come with expectations and curiosity
as to our standards and goals. Many of them
hope to find potential lifelong friends here.
Until this year, no sincere effort was
made on the part of the Stanford student
body to welcome these students and accept
them into the fold. Few organizations went
out of their way to befriend international
scholars, to show them how we live and to
inquire into their national ways. American

students who frequented the I-Center wore
considered socially inept, left-wing extrem
ists, or of the Beat Generation.
THIS YEAR has brought about a marked
change in the attitude of the campus towards
the international student. We have begun to
realize with the help of the Soviet Friendship
University, that successful foreign relations
often begin when favorable impressions are
made on visiting students, a large percentage
of whom become the future leaders of their
respective countries.
Travel to America is too expensive and
the need for trained personnel at home too
critical for these students to come here mere
ly for pleasure. Each one is at this university
to learn about the American way of living
as well as to study. Attitudes developed now
will remain throughout life.
It is a poor comment on our hospitality
when it is a fact that foreign students on this
campus make more friends with other for
eign students than they do with their Ameri
can “hosts.” Are American students socially
shy or afraid to test their ideas against for
eign views? Or are we all too inner-directed,
as Riesman would say, to think about somc-

one, or even something, outside our immedi
ate circle of interests?

THE GOAL of the I-Ciub this year has
been to bring American students and faculty
together with Stanford’s international stu
dents. The I-Club has grown from an obscure
campus organization into an organized
group with more than 700 foreign and Amer
ican members.

The bevy of activities presented in this
year’s program has aimed at stimulating an
interest in world affairs and providing op
portunities for informal get-togethers be
tween students, faculty and administrators.
Informal Friday afternoon coffee hours, Fit
day evening discussion groups, Saturday
Evenings Abroad, monthly dances, and the
annual international ball all attempt to create
a bond between students and faculty of all
nationalities at Stanford.

In the future the International Club hopes
to encourage more desire on the part of
American students to join in activities with
their international counterparts. But the
Stanford student body must be willing to
contribute to this goal. Programs that the
I-Club hopes to initiate, provided there is suf-

ficient interest on campus, are; picnics, hos
tels, more informal get-togethers with facul
ty and students in living groups, eating pro
grams for international students in campus
living groups—with an educational goal in
mind, international dinners with distinguish
ed visitors, faculty and American students,
and more frank discussion groups on per
tinent and interesting subjects.
THE 1-CLUB also hopes to sponsor excur
sions and extended trips to various points of
interest in the Western United States with
American students as guides and companion
travelers.
To date, the I-Club has had to work under
severe financial strain because its position in
Stanford life has not been recognized. It has
been a hard battle to gain the present meas
ure of support from the student body. It is
the hope of all those who are concerned
with the foreign student program at Stan
ford that the student body will welcome our
international scholars and help to make their
stay in the United States a truly memorable
experience. Let us tap our priceless “re
source” for a greater knowledge and under
standing of the world.

Palace Hotel. It is rumored that San Jose
State might attempt a similar activity in the

near future.
THE PHENOMENAL success of the In
ternational Club's first annual ball clearly in
dicates a growing concern for international
students and an awareness of their potenti
alities, not only here at Stanford but also in
the community.
Stanford students are slowly becoming
aware of the wealth of knowledge and un
derstanding to be gained from association
with our foreign guests. This campus is the
academic home for more than 640 foreign
students from 73 foreign countries. These
students of different educational and cultural
backgrounds come to the United States to
learn about American life and the process of
ducation at a top-rate American University.
They come with expectations and curiosity
as to our standards and goals. Many of them
hope to find potential lifelong friends here.
Until this year, no sincere effort was
made on the part of the Stanford student
body to welcome these students and accept
them into the fold. Few organizations went
out of their way to befriend international
scholars, to show them how we live and to
inquire into their national ways. American

students who frequented the I-Center wore
considered socially inept, left-wing extrem
ists, or of the Beat Generation.
THIS YEAR has brought about a marked
change in the attitude of the campus towards
the international student. We have begun to
realize with the help of the Soviet Friendship
University, that successful foreign relations
often begin when favorable impressions are
made on visiting students, a large percentage
of whom become the future leaders of their
respective countries.
Travel to America is too expensive and
the need for trained personnel at home too
critical for these students to come here mere
ly for pleasure. Each one is at this university
to learn about the American way of living
as well as to study. Attitudes developed now
will remain throughout life.
It is a poor comment on our hospitality
when it is a fact that foreign students on this
campus make more friends with other for
eign students than they do with their Ameri
can “hosts.” Are American students socially
shy or afraid to test their ideas against for
eign views? Or are we all too inner-directed,
as Riesman would say, to think about somc-

one, or even something, outside our immedi
ate circle of interests?

THE GOAL of the I-Ciub this year has
been to bring American students and faculty
together with Stanford’s international stu
dents. The I-Club has grown from an obscure
campus organization into an organized
group with more than 700 foreign and Amer
ican members.

The bevy of activities presented in this
year’s program has aimed at stimulating an
interest in world affairs and providing op
portunities for informal get-togethers be
tween students, faculty and administrators.
Informal Friday afternoon coffee hours, Fit
day evening discussion groups, Saturday
Evenings Abroad, monthly dances, and the
annual international ball all attempt to create
a bond between students and faculty of all
nationalities at Stanford.

In the future the International Club hopes
to encourage more desire on the part of
American students to join in activities with
their international counterparts. But the
Stanford student body must be willing to
contribute to this goal. Programs that the
I-Club hopes to initiate, provided there is suf-

ficient interest on campus, are; picnics, hos
tels, more informal get-togethers with facul
ty and students in living groups, eating pro
grams for international students in campus
living groups—with an educational goal in
mind, international dinners with distinguish
ed visitors, faculty and American students,
and more frank discussion groups on per
tinent and interesting subjects.
THE 1-CLUB also hopes to sponsor excur
sions and extended trips to various points of
interest in the Western United States with
American students as guides and companion
travelers.
To date, the I-Club has had to work under
severe financial strain because its position in
Stanford life has not been recognized. It has
been a hard battle to gain the present meas
ure of support from the student body. It is
the hope of all those who are concerned
with the foreign student program at Stan
ford that the student body will welcome our
international scholars and help to make their
stay in the United States a truly memorable
experience. Let us tap our priceless “re
source” for a greater knowledge and under
standing of the world.
Last January 26 over 750 diplomats, poli
ticians, community leaders and students
crowded into the Gold Room of the Sheraton-
Palace Hotel to enjoy Stanford's first Inter
national Ball.
Twenty-two consul-generals attended, the
largest number ever recorded at any one
function of this typo sponsored by any or
ganize Mon in the bay area. Mayor Christo
pher sent his wishes by telegram and Gov
ernor Brown expressed deep regrets that he
would not be able to attend until very late.
Over 50 peninsula families attended the ball
as patrons.
It has been said that this activity was the
most successful combined all-campus and
community dance ever sponsored by a stu
dent organization at Stanford. Wo can some
what judge the validity of this opinion by
looking at the impact of the ball on other
campuses. The University of California has

them into the fold. Few organizations went
out of their way to befriend international
scholars, to show them how we live and to
inquire into their national ways. American

students who frequented the I-Center wore
considered socially inept, left-wing extrem
ists, or of the Beat Generation.
THIS YEAR has brought about a marked
change in the attitude of the campus towards
the international student. We have begun to
realize with the help of the Soviet Friendship
University, that successful foreign relations
often begin when favorable impressions are
made on visiting students, a large percentage
of whom become the future leaders of their
respective countries.
Travel to America is too expensive and
the need for trained personnel at home too
critical for these students to come here mere
ly for pleasure. Each one is at this university
to learn about the American way of living
as well as to study. Attitudes developed now
will remain throughout life.
It is a poor comment on our hospitality
when it is a fact that foreign students on this
campus make more friends with other for
eign students than they do with their Ameri
can “hosts.” Are American students socially
shy or afraid to test their ideas against for
eign views? Or are we all too inner-directed,
as Riesman would say, to think about somc-

one, or even something, outside our immedi
ate circle of interests?

THE GOAL of the I-Ciub this year has
been to bring American students and faculty
together with Stanford’s international stu
dents. The I-Club has grown from an obscure
campus organization into an organized
group with more than 700 foreign and Amer
ican members.

The bevy of activities presented in this
year’s program has aimed at stimulating an
interest in world affairs and providing op
portunities for informal get-togethers be
tween students, faculty and administrators.
Informal Friday afternoon coffee hours, Fit
day evening discussion groups, Saturday
Evenings Abroad, monthly dances, and the
annual international ball all attempt to create
a bond between students and faculty of all
nationalities at Stanford.

In the future the International Club hopes
to encourage more desire on the part of
American students to join in activities with
their international counterparts. But the
Stanford student body must be willing to
contribute to this goal. Programs that the
I-Club hopes to initiate, provided there is suf-

ficient interest on campus, are; picnics, hos
tels, more informal get-togethers with facul
ty and students in living groups, eating pro
grams for international students in campus
living groups—with an educational goal in
mind, international dinners with distinguish
ed visitors, faculty and American students,
and more frank discussion groups on per
tinent and interesting subjects.
THE 1-CLUB also hopes to sponsor excur
sions and extended trips to various points of
interest in the Western United States with
American students as guides and companion
travelers.
To date, the I-Club has had to work under
severe financial strain because its position in
Stanford life has not been recognized. It has
been a hard battle to gain the present meas
ure of support from the student body. It is
the hope of all those who are concerned
with the foreign student program at Stan
ford that the student body will welcome our
international scholars and help to make their
stay in the United States a truly memorable
experience. Let us tap our priceless “re
source” for a greater knowledge and under
standing of the world.
Last January 26 over 750 diplomats, poli
ticians, community leaders and students
crowded into the Gold Room of the Sheraton-
Palace Hotel to enjoy Stanford's first Inter
national Ball.
Twenty-two consul-generals attended, the
largest number ever recorded at any one
function of this typo sponsored by any or
ganize Mon in the bay area. Mayor Christo
pher sent his wishes by telegram and Gov
ernor Brown expressed deep regrets that he
would not be able to attend until very late.
Over 50 peninsula families attended the ball
as patrons.
It has been said that this activity was the
most successful combined all-campus and
community dance ever sponsored by a stu
dent organization at Stanford. Wo can some
what judge the validity of this opinion by
looking at the impact of the ball on other
campuses. The University of California has
just announced plans for its first internation
al ball to be held in May at the Sheraton-
Palace Hotel. It is rumored that San Jose
State might attempt a similar activity in the

near future.
THE PHENOMENAL success of the In
ternational Club's first annual ball clearly in
dicates a growing concern for international
students and an awareness of their potenti
alities, not only here at Stanford but also in
the community.
Stanford students are slowly becoming
aware of the wealth of knowledge and un
derstanding to be gained from association
with our foreign guests. This campus is the
academic home for more than 640 foreign
students from 73 foreign countries. These
students of different educational and cultural
backgrounds come to the United States to
learn about American life and the process of
ducation at a top-rate American University.
They come with expectations and curiosity
as to our standards and goals. Many of them
hope to find potential lifelong friends here.
Until this year, no sincere effort was
made on the part of the Stanford student
body to welcome these students and accept
them into the fold. Few organizations went
out of their way to befriend international
scholars, to show them how we live and to
inquire into their national ways. American
