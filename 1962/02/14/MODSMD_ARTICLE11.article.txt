### 
PARIS (UPI) The Commu
nists Tuesday tied up the country
with a general strike that brought
300.000 Frenchmen into the
streets of Paris—one of the great
est crowds since the 1944 libera
tion.

The show-of-strength was in
protest against the Algerian poli
cies of both President Charles
de Gaulle and right-wing terror
ists.
There was no violence. The
strike was called by the Commu
nist-dominated General Confeder
ation of Labor (CGT). Vetei’an
observers said it was one of the
most effective ever seen in this
country where political walkouts
are frequent.
The strike was timed to coin
cide with the funerals of eight
persons killed in last Thursday’s
rioting over the Algerian situa
tion. All but two of the victims
were Communists.

Communist party chiefs Mau
rice Thorez and Jacques Duclos
and the entire party central com
mittee marched or rode in the
procession. Four labor union lead
ers delivered funeral orations at
the cemetery gates.
