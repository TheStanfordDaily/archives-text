# All-Campus Support May Give Stanford Coed Housing Soon

“Although we understand o
sidering it, we feel that the men

her committees have been con
in Stern can best judge what they
-want for Stern,” said John Batch,
the assistant director of Stern
Hall. “The Stern House presi
dents, representing their houses,
have voted unanimously in favor
0 fhaving a coed housing system
set up at Stern for next year, and
1 think that their desires should
be considered.”
The LASSU Committee for Un
dergraduate Living heard from
Balch and a number of othei’s
concei’ning a Coed Housing sys
tem at Stanford in the near fu
ture, and particularly at Stern
for next year. Julie Shearer, a
member of the Committee, and
Head Sponsor at Roble, said that
she has committments from a
“sufficient” number of girls to fill
one of the Iront houses at Stern
who have said that they would
like to participate in the pro
gram.

HILL CBANMEB, a member of
the committee, felt that the ti’ans
ition of one of the houses at Stern
fi’om a men’s to a women’s hall
would be easily accomplished.
“Stern has the best setup of any
place on campus to try the sys
tem,” he said. He noted that the
small dining axeas; lai’ge, “close,”
lounges, smaller upstairs lounges
to provide privacy for segregated
activities and large I'ecr’eational
areas in the basements of the
houses at Stern would make it
ideal. “With the senior men leav
ing Stern, and a smaller freshman
class enrollment lor next yeai’,
plus the crowded conditions in the
women’s dorms, there should be
very little placement problem if
one of the houses is convexted for
next year,” ho said. The minimum
of changes, not costing more than
$2500, would make one of the
houses ready for occupation by
women.

DEAN CRAIG has said that he
had no objection to the coed sys
tem at Stanford, but that it
would, he felt, best work if new
dorms wore designed for it rather
than converting existing housing.
Newly proposed Robert Moore
Hall could be made coeducational,
and it could be designed to make
a good dorm for coed living.

John Dennis, a member of the
committee, does not feel that
Stanford should wait three or
more years until that ideal “uto
pian” hall comes about. “We at
Stern, and many of the women,
want it now, and there is really
no reason why it could not work
successfully at Stern.”
Prof. Robert R. Sears, Dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said that he could see that
coed housing may be in Stern
next year.
