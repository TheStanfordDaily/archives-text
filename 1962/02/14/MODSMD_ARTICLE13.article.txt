# U.S. Must Refrain From Nuclear Tests
## 
### 
Tlic tiling in the large jar stares at yon. It’s alive and it seems to
have feelings. Its arms and legs, for that is what they are, are
gnarled and shrivelled. Its torso is twisted beyond belief. Somehow
the lungs, heart, and viscera have been ripped from their places
and seemingly have been grafted on to the skin.
That something in the large jar can be seen by Stanford stu
dents and has already been seen by many of them, for it is part of
the current exhibit in the Main Library which depicts the foolish
ness and results of nuclear war and atmospheric nuclear testing.
The thing in the jar is almost a Japanese baby—one of many
semi-humans who never quite made it because of the atomic bombs
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
In spite of the likely results of radioactivity, the U.S. is ap
parently ready and willing to renew atmospheric tests in the near
future in order to “improve onr national defense.”
It is so easy. Instead of really trying to come to an understand
ing with the Russians in regard to disarmament this country pre
fers to fill the atmosphere with material which may cause the birth
of more semi-humans.
We refuse to believe that negotiations with the Russians must
end in stalemate. One of the main reasons for discord is our in
sistence upon a foolproof inspection system. Senator Hubert
Humphrey has an effective and sensible answer: “When I hear
people say that we must be absolutely and positively certain that
a control system is foolproof, then I ask them, ‘What is foolproof
about the continuation of the nuclear race?’”
We add our feeble voice to those who are now imploring our
government to refrain from atmospheric testing. We believe in
democracy and therefore believe that enough feeble voices shout
ing in unison will be heard and obeyed.
In the words of Albert Einstein: “We are still making bombs
and the bombs are making hate and suspicion. We are keeping
secrets and secrets breed distrust. While we distrust Russia’s
secrecy and she distrusts ours, we walk together toward certain
doom.”
