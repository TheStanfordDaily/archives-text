### VIVI BOZMAN 
(Editor's Note: This is the first
of two articles on the recent San
Francisco conference held in op
position to tlie Christian Anti
( onmninism Crusade.)

The most impressive aspect of
the Conference on the Impact of
the Radical Right held in San
Francisco on Feb. 3 is the fact
that students cared enough to or
ganize it and close to 3200 people
cared enough to attend, agreed
Dr. Irving Howe and Dr. John
Bunzel. Stanford professors who
participated in the conference.
Bunzel noted that Dr. Fred
Schwarz's Christian Anti-Commu
nist Crusade met its first public
opposition in San Francisco in
contrast to Los Angeles where it
found a “ready-made audience.”
“Close to 1200 people came to a
little publicized meeting to dis
cuss the impact of the emerging
right wing in this country. This,
I think, is a real credit to the
whole Bay Area community,”
Bunzel stated.
HOWE praised the conference
as a manifestation of student in
terest and initiative. He noted
that the conference was complete
ly organized by students.
Howe further commented on
the value of the conference, em
phasizing the reasonable and in
telligent atmosphere which pro
moted an interesting exchange of
ideas and the public demonstra
tion of opposition, especially valu
able since rightist elements had
tended to monopolize the public
media.
The conference “posed very
clearly the danger of not only the
leaders, but especially of the fol
lowers of these right wing ex
tremist groups, to our democratic
political processes,” Bunzel stat
ed.
COMMENTING on the charac
ter of right wing movements in
general, both professors agreed
that they are always potentially
dangerous. Howe noted that their
immediate danger is primarily on
a local level where they exert
pressure on the educational sys
tem. “They tend to choke up
teaching, frighten local educat
ors.” This is still a preliminary
stage, he cautioned. “It is desir
able to catch these things before
it is too late.”
Bunzel commented that these
movements are always danger
ous, just as “McCarthyism was
and is still a danger.”
However, a greater danger than

the movements themselves is to
become overwhelmed and awed
by their frantic agitation. “If we
have learned anything about how
to confront these primitives,”
Bunzel said, “it is not to allow
them to monopolize the political
stage. I think they must be ex
posed, analyzed, discussed, and
laughed at. The one thing they do
not like is ridicule, but we should
never let them forget that in ad
dition to being loud and boister
ous, they are also ridiculous.”
BUNZEL’S attitude of ridicule
is similar to the opinion express
ed by Howard H. Jewel, Assistant
Attorney General of California,
in his speech at the conference.
Jewel noted that the radical
right is composed of those who
“believe Little Orphan Annie is a
true story, and that Robert Welch
is Daddy Warbucks,” If the radi
cal right would “rather be dead
than Rod,” the intelligent mem
ber of the community would
“rather be neither than either.”
More seriously, Jewel charac
terized the radical right as “in
sidious, clever, well-financed, and
more dangerous than any com
parable movement in the past.”
The followers of the right wing
today are “healthy, sincere, and
loyal Americans fooled into rally
ing for a cause which seems a
panacea.”

Jewel's speech was followed by
the afternoon panel, “Origins,
Purposes, and Methods of the
Radical Right,” in which Bunzel,
Howe, and San Francisco State
College Professors Marshall
Windmiller and Louis Levine par
ticipated.
THE RIGHT wing leaders en
courage a “compound of fear,
frustration, and foolishness,” Le
vine noted. The intelligent ap
proach in opposition to this com
pound should be “a variety of at
tacks on ignorance, programs for
presenting American ideals in
depth, emphasizing freedom of
speech, freedom of inquiry . . . ”

Windmiller cited one cause for
the rise of the radical right as the
fact that old fashioned warfare
and hence the traditional impor
tance of the army is becoming ob
solete. Military leaders are frus
trated, and rightist groups insist
that we are “at war, so that the
rules of war apply to the present,
situation.”

“In the health of the radical
right wing lies the symptom of
our sickness,” Howe noted.

“itinerant medicine man.”)
