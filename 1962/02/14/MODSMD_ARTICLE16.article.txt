THE DRAFT
Editor, The Daily;
A great deal has already been
written about the inadequacy, in
equality, and general stupidity ot
the present selective service sys
tem. I have nothing new to add
except a few personal comments,
I did not register this quarter
in order to make up incompletes
and do some other personal work.
This week I find that the Stan
ford National Service Office has
sent out a special bulletin to my
draft board, informing them that
I am no longer a full-time student
at Stanford.
MR. FINDEISEN in the Nation
al Service Office was kind enough
to answer my questions but did
not seem to be able to tell mo
whether this bulletin business
was required by individual draft
boards and was Stanford’s own
policy or whether it was a Na
tional policy.
His position, and rightly so, was
that once Stanford has issued a
statement to any draft hoard (I
have a student deferment) that a
particular student is full-time
and in the top quarter of his
class, then it is Stanford’s duty
to inform that draft board when
ever the student is no longer reg
istered.
While I was in the office, a
harried student came in to ask
whether he would he drafted if he
was 26. The secretary said that
“at present” he was safe, hut that
there might he another “Berlin”
any time. He replied, then “babies
aren’t necessary?” The answer:
“No, not at the present time.”
BUREAUCRACY can be toler
ated as long as it interferes only
with relatively unimportant
things such as private mail. But
when it reaches down into ques
tions of love and marriage (“Ba
bies aren’t necessary?”) it has
gone a bit too far.
It seems to me that it’s time we
realized, especially with the re
cent problems concerning Gener
al Walker, that we need a well
paid, professional army under the
absolute control of the civil ad
ministration of this country.

Simply because Ihe Army at pres
ent can draft any Tom, Dick or [
Harry whenever it pleases it feels
that it can also politically edu
cate any Tom, Dick or Harry.
The time has passed when we
can waste our time on this pseu
do-obeisance to democracy. Ev
eryone has a job to do if this
country is to survive the political
and social upheavals that encircle
the earth at present. But for
God’s sake, let's make sure just
exactly what our jobs are!

DUPED AGAIN
Editor, The Daily:
I am afraid The Daily has once
again been the victim of a hoax.
I, the current Old Boy, did not j
write the letter attributed to my
name in Monday’s letter column.
As I join Ross Hermann in the
“Outraged innocence club,” let me
attempt to salvage what I can of I
a hopeless situation.
First of all, the Chaparral does 1
not make a point of publicizing
its staff members’ occasional in
discretions. True enough, the
facts as presented Monday were |
substantially correct (though I, j
for one, would like to see the “two I
kidney stones” mentioned). But |
what about the other side of the
coin? It is not generally known [
that the Chaparral last year con
tributed half its profits to the con j
home, not to mention our substan-1
lial support of the Displaced Stu-1
dents Relief Fund.
Secondly, the Chaparral is not,
in any sense of the word, a “hang
loose” organization. We are a
close-knit coterie of beady-eyed,
tight-lipped young men and wom
en, moving about the campus in
groups of two and three (the
“buddy” system). You’d be tight
lipped too. Editors Sklar and Rap
oport, if it was already February
and only one issue of The Daily
had come out.
Finally, we do bribe people to
come to our elections, but why
not, doesn’t everybody these
days?

in any sense of the word, a “hang

THE DRAFT
Editor, The Daily;
A great deal has already been
written about the inadequacy, in
equality, and general stupidity ot
the present selective service sys
tem. I have nothing new to add
except a few personal comments,
I did not register this quarter
in order to make up incompletes
and do some other personal work.
This week I find that the Stan
ford National Service Office has
sent out a special bulletin to my
draft board, informing them that
I am no longer a full-time student
at Stanford.
MR. FINDEISEN in the Nation
al Service Office was kind enough
to answer my questions but did
not seem to be able to tell mo
whether this bulletin business
was required by individual draft
boards and was Stanford’s own
policy or whether it was a Na
tional policy.
His position, and rightly so, was
that once Stanford has issued a
statement to any draft hoard (I
have a student deferment) that a
particular student is full-time
and in the top quarter of his
class, then it is Stanford’s duty
to inform that draft board when
ever the student is no longer reg
istered.
While I was in the office, a
harried student came in to ask
whether he would he drafted if he
was 26. The secretary said that
“at present” he was safe, hut that
there might he another “Berlin”
any time. He replied, then “babies
aren’t necessary?” The answer:
“No, not at the present time.”
BUREAUCRACY can be toler
ated as long as it interferes only
with relatively unimportant
things such as private mail. But
when it reaches down into ques
tions of love and marriage (“Ba
bies aren’t necessary?”) it has
gone a bit too far.
It seems to me that it’s time we
realized, especially with the re
cent problems concerning Gener
al Walker, that we need a well
paid, professional army under the
absolute control of the civil ad
ministration of this country.

Simply because Ihe Army at pres
ent can draft any Tom, Dick or [
Harry whenever it pleases it feels
that it can also politically edu
cate any Tom, Dick or Harry.
The time has passed when we
can waste our time on this pseu
do-obeisance to democracy. Ev
eryone has a job to do if this
country is to survive the political
and social upheavals that encircle
the earth at present. But for
God’s sake, let's make sure just
exactly what our jobs are!

whether he would he drafted if he

aren’t necessary?” The answer:
“No, not at the present time.”
BUREAUCRACY can be toler

It seems to me that it’s time we
realized, especially with the re

Simply because Ihe Army at pres

that it can also politically edu

The time has passed when we
can waste our time on this pseu

the earth at present. But for
God’s sake, let's make sure just
exactly what our jobs are!

DUPED AGAIN
Editor, The Daily:
I am afraid The Daily has once
again been the victim of a hoax.
I, the current Old Boy, did not j
write the letter attributed to my
name in Monday’s letter column.
As I join Ross Hermann in the
“Outraged innocence club,” let me
attempt to salvage what I can of I
a hopeless situation.
First of all, the Chaparral does 1
not make a point of publicizing
its staff members’ occasional in
discretions. True enough, the
facts as presented Monday were |
substantially correct (though I, j
for one, would like to see the “two I
kidney stones” mentioned). But |
what about the other side of the
coin? It is not generally known [
that the Chaparral last year con
tributed half its profits to the con j
home, not to mention our substan-1
lial support of the Displaced Stu-1
dents Relief Fund.
Secondly, the Chaparral is not,
in any sense of the word, a “hang
loose” organization. We are a
close-knit coterie of beady-eyed,
tight-lipped young men and wom
en, moving about the campus in
groups of two and three (the
“buddy” system). You’d be tight
lipped too. Editors Sklar and Rap
oport, if it was already February
and only one issue of The Daily
had come out.
Finally, we do bribe people to
come to our elections, but why
not, doesn’t everybody these
days?

THE DRAFT
Editor, The Daily;
A great deal has already been
written about the inadequacy, in
equality, and general stupidity ot
the present selective service sys
tem. I have nothing new to add
except a few personal comments,
I did not register this quarter
in order to make up incompletes
and do some other personal work.
This week I find that the Stan
ford National Service Office has
sent out a special bulletin to my
draft board, informing them that
I am no longer a full-time student
at Stanford.
MR. FINDEISEN in the Nation
al Service Office was kind enough
to answer my questions but did
not seem to be able to tell mo
whether this bulletin business
was required by individual draft
boards and was Stanford’s own
policy or whether it was a Na
tional policy.
His position, and rightly so, was
that once Stanford has issued a
statement to any draft hoard (I
have a student deferment) that a
particular student is full-time
and in the top quarter of his
class, then it is Stanford’s duty
to inform that draft board when
ever the student is no longer reg
istered.
While I was in the office, a
harried student came in to ask
whether he would he drafted if he
was 26. The secretary said that
“at present” he was safe, hut that
there might he another “Berlin”
any time. He replied, then “babies
aren’t necessary?” The answer:
“No, not at the present time.”
