# INFORMATION NEEDED
## Taiwan Study Center Questioned 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
Stanford is in the process of set
ting up a study program on the
island of Taiwan.
As far as can he learned from
unofficial sources, the program
will serve a small group of Chi
nese language majors, mostly
graduate students, enabling them
to learn Mandarin Chinese.

Stanford will be cooperating in
the program with Ihe University
of Taiwan, which will supply
some of the teachers and facili
ties.

ACCORDING TO James T. C.
Liu of the Chinese Language de
partment, the plans at present do
not include a “Stanford-in-Formo
sa” on the model of the European
Overseas campuses, hut this pos
sibility will be considered after
an evaluation of the language pro
gram experiment.
The establishment of such a
program on Taiwan raises several
questions.

Rep. Meyer, speaking in the
House of Representatives, April
26-27, 1960, said of Formosa:
“Our press frequently refers to

Formosa as a bastion of freedom
in the Far East, but this is what:
happened in the recent election of
Nationalist China:
“FIRST, President Chiang Kai
shek was the only candidate al
lowed on the ballot. Second, the
Constitution was suspended for
one day because It forbade a third
term. Third, the only way electors
could vote against Chiang was to
cast a blank ballot and so they
were thrown out as invalid.
Fourth, 83 per cent of the For
mosans are native Taiwanese but
they were allotted only two per
cent of the electoral votes.”
To what extent does Stanford,
by locating a campus on Formo
sa, lend its prestige and intellec
tual legitimacy to a totalitarian
government?
If we are receiving any finan
cial assistance from the Formo
san government towards Ihe pro
gram, will this mean that that
government will be able to influ
ence Stanford’s decisions in any
way?
At the Yale study center in Ma
drid, it has been observed that
they are “preaching the party
line,” in effect, because Franco
won’t support any liberal profes-

I sors. Could a similar situation oc
i ('ur on Formosa?
IS TUKRK any possibility that
political considerations will lead
the University to admit only
I safe students to the Formosa pro-
I gram?
j Study of the Chinese language
j is unquestionably a goal which
I the University could profitably
j pursue.
It would he interesting to know
however, the considerations
which led the administration to
prefer Formosa to, for example,
| Hong Kong as-the most logical
place for our study center.
I’KRHAPS THK questions ask
ed above have been answered to
the satisfaction of all concerned.
Perhaps, though, some of them
were neither asked nor adequate
ly answered.
Official information about the
program is being “held for the
approval of the president’s of
fice,’’ according to Dr. Robert
Walker, Director of the Stanford
Overseas Campuses.
We would hope that this in
formation can be released soon
and that it will provide satisfac
toiy answers to any questionable
aspects of the program.

The establishment of such a
program on Taiwan raises several
questions.

Rep. Meyer, speaking in the
House of Representatives, April
26-27, 1960, said of Formosa:
“Our press frequently refers to

Formosa as a bastion of freedom
in the Far East, but this is what:
happened in the recent election of
Nationalist China:
“FIRST, President Chiang Kai
shek was the only candidate al
lowed on the ballot. Second, the
Constitution was suspended for
one day because It forbade a third
term. Third, the only way electors
could vote against Chiang was to
cast a blank ballot and so they
were thrown out as invalid.
Fourth, 83 per cent of the For
mosans are native Taiwanese but
they were allotted only two per
cent of the electoral votes.”
To what extent does Stanford,
by locating a campus on Formo
sa, lend its prestige and intellec
tual legitimacy to a totalitarian
government?
If we are receiving any finan
cial assistance from the Formo
san government towards Ihe pro
gram, will this mean that that
government will be able to influ
ence Stanford’s decisions in any
way?
At the Yale study center in Ma
drid, it has been observed that
they are “preaching the party
line,” in effect, because Franco
won’t support any liberal profes-

I sors. Could a similar situation oc
i ('ur on Formosa?
IS TUKRK any possibility that
political considerations will lead
the University to admit only
I safe students to the Formosa pro-
I gram?
j Study of the Chinese language
j is unquestionably a goal which
I the University could profitably
j pursue.
It would he interesting to know
however, the considerations
which led the administration to
prefer Formosa to, for example,
| Hong Kong as-the most logical
place for our study center.
I’KRHAPS THK questions ask
ed above have been answered to
the satisfaction of all concerned.
Perhaps, though, some of them
were neither asked nor adequate
ly answered.
Official information about the
program is being “held for the
approval of the president’s of
fice,’’ according to Dr. Robert
Walker, Director of the Stanford
Overseas Campuses.
We would hope that this in
formation can be released soon
and that it will provide satisfac
toiy answers to any questionable
aspects of the program.
Stanford is in the process of set
ting up a study program on the
island of Taiwan.
As far as can he learned from
unofficial sources, the program
will serve a small group of Chi
nese language majors, mostly
graduate students, enabling them
to learn Mandarin Chinese.

Stanford will be cooperating in
the program with Ihe University
of Taiwan, which will supply
some of the teachers and facili
ties.

ACCORDING TO James T. C.
Liu of the Chinese Language de
partment, the plans at present do
not include a “Stanford-in-Formo
sa” on the model of the European
Overseas campuses, hut this pos
sibility will be considered after
an evaluation of the language pro
gram experiment.
