EXCELLENT DANCE
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to commend the
Inter-Club Council and the Eating
Clubs for the excellent dance they
presented last Saturday night in
Toyon lounge. The hand provided
fine music and the Lettermen
stopped the show with 50 minutes
of real entertainment! From the
appearance of the capacity crowd
present, we think everyone will
agree that the Clubs proved that
a truly enjoyable (and economi
cal) evening can be spent on cam
pus.

We hope that the ICC will con
sent to lend Toyon lounge to
other groups wanting to use the
fine facilities there for future
functions. Susan Wotring
