# Hall, Chief US Red, to Speak, Debate Nixed
## 
### 
Gus Hall, leader of the Ameri
can Communist Party, will speak
on “The Appeal of Communism
to the Intellectual” and then lead
a question-and-answer session at
4:15 p.m. tomorrow in Memorial
Auditorium.
Originally. Hall was to debate
Allard Lowenstein, director of
Stern Hall on the topic, “Re
solved: That the Communist
movement is the greatest threat
to freedom in the world.”
However, the Communist lead
er refused to debate and asked to
be allowed to speak alone instead.
HALL WROTE that he turned
down the debate in favor of a
speech and questions because of
his tight schedule and the limited
time allowed to present his views
and, in his view, the negative sub
ject of debate scheduled.
He also said that as his appear
ance here would ho presented as a
political stand opposite from that
of Dr. Fred Schwartz, head of the
Christian Anti-Communist Cru
sade, he should be free to present
his material in the same manner
as did Schwartz, that is, in a
speech rather than in a debate.
Lawrence Chickering, president
of Political Union, said that Low
enstein agreed to the debate pend
ing the approval of either Hall or
his representative, Mickey Lima,
chairman of the Communist Par
ty of Northern California.
“It is interesting that the self
styled defenders of the free mar
ketplace of ideas are unwilling to
expose their ideas in a competi

tive situation,” Chickening said

‘‘His (Hall's) attitude is even
more interesting when the topic
he lias chosen is “The Appeal of
Communism to the Intellectual,”
Chickening said.
HALE IS a former president of
United Steel Workers. He served
a five-year jail term under the
Smith Act for teaching and advo
cating the overthrow of the gov
ernment and is now under indict
ment for failing to comply with
that act’s membership clause.
He cancelled an earlier invita
tion to speak at Stanford on Jan.
26. four days after a similar cam
pus appearance of Schwartz.
The talk will be open only to
Stanford students, faculty and
staff.

pus appearance of Schwartz.
The talk will be open only to
Stanford students, faculty and
staff.
Gus Hall, leader of the Ameri
can Communist Party, will speak
on “The Appeal of Communism
to the Intellectual” and then lead
a question-and-answer session at
4:15 p.m. tomorrow in Memorial
Auditorium.
Originally. Hall was to debate
Allard Lowenstein, director of
Stern Hall on the topic, “Re
solved: That the Communist
movement is the greatest threat
to freedom in the world.”
However, the Communist lead
er refused to debate and asked to
be allowed to speak alone instead.
HALL WROTE that he turned
down the debate in favor of a
speech and questions because of
his tight schedule and the limited
time allowed to present his views
and, in his view, the negative sub
ject of debate scheduled.
He also said that as his appear
ance here would ho presented as a
political stand opposite from that
of Dr. Fred Schwartz, head of the
Christian Anti-Communist Cru
sade, he should be free to present
his material in the same manner
as did Schwartz, that is, in a
speech rather than in a debate.
Lawrence Chickering, president
of Political Union, said that Low
enstein agreed to the debate pend
ing the approval of either Hall or
his representative, Mickey Lima,
chairman of the Communist Par
ty of Northern California.
“It is interesting that the self
styled defenders of the free mar
ketplace of ideas are unwilling to
expose their ideas in a competi

tive situation,” Chickening said

‘‘His (Hall's) attitude is even
more interesting when the topic
he lias chosen is “The Appeal of
Communism to the Intellectual,”
Chickening said.
HALE IS a former president of
United Steel Workers. He served
a five-year jail term under the
Smith Act for teaching and advo
cating the overthrow of the gov
ernment and is now under indict
ment for failing to comply with
that act’s membership clause.
He cancelled an earlier invita
tion to speak at Stanford on Jan.
26. four days after a similar cam
pus appearance of Schwartz.
