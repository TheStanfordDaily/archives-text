NEW YORK—A good little man still can make it big on the
sports scene.
Jim Beatty 5-6 and Chuck McKinley 5-8 scored impressive
victories in different sports last weekend for what might be a
dandy lesson for slow-to-spront youngsters who feel they’ll never

♦be big enough to star in major
competition.

ed,F RECORD
ROANOKE, Tex. (UPI) By
ron Nelson, who still competes
occasionally, won 11 straight pro
fessional golf tournaments in
1945- a record that still stands.

THIS IS AN AGE of the mobile
monster in pro football and bas
ketball but there’s plenty of room
for a small man in baseball, golf,
tennis, college basketball, college
football, track and field and, of
course, horse-racing for the real
pee wees.
Beatty, a 27-year-old 128 pound
er, raced the first indoor mile
under four minutes at Los An
geles Saturday night with a clock
ing of 3:.78.9. McKinley, 21, won
the U.S, indoor tennis champion
ship. He's also co-holder of the
grass courts doubles and is the
chief hope of the U.S. Davis Cup
team.
By today’s physical standards
both Beatty ami McKinley are
real shorties who don’t figure to
hold their own in big time com
petition.
But Beatty, a dedicated runner,
trains diligently and plans care
fully before he steps onto the
track for a race.
McKinley, dwarfed by most of
his tennis opponents, compensat-

Ed for his lack of size by perfect
ing a sizzling overhead shot and
scored with 26 of 27 attempts in
his winning indoor final against
Whitney Reed.
Leading little men in other
sports, all under 5 feet 10, include
golfers Gary Player, Jerry Bar
ber, Gene Littler, and Billy Max
well; baseballers Albie Pearson,
Elroy Face, Harvey Haddix, Bob
by Richardson, Luis Aparicio and
Nellie Fox; football star Galen
Hall of Penn State and a flock of
candidates for the “Small Ameri
ca” basketball team led by Larry
Armstrong 3-9 of Arizona State U.

er, raced the first indoor mile
under four minutes at Los An
geles Saturday night with a clock
ing of 3:.78.9. McKinley, 21, won
the U.S, indoor tennis champion
ship. He's also co-holder of the
grass courts doubles and is the
chief hope of the U.S. Davis Cup
team.
By today’s physical standards
both Beatty ami McKinley are
real shorties who don’t figure to
hold their own in big time com
petition.
But Beatty, a dedicated runner,
trains diligently and plans care
fully before he steps onto the
track for a race.
McKinley, dwarfed by most of
his tennis opponents, compensat-

Ed for his lack of size by perfect
ing a sizzling overhead shot and
scored with 26 of 27 attempts in
his winning indoor final against
Whitney Reed.

competition.
