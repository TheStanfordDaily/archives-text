# Gymnasts Face S.F. State in Gym
## 
### 
Stanford’s gymnastics team
will open its 1962 season tonight
against San Francisco State Col
lege in Encina Gym at 7:30.
Coach Wesley Ruff has only
one returning letterman on (he
squad, Bill Bednar, who will com
pete in trampoline, horizontal
bar, and tumbling.
TWO OTHER MEN from last
year’s squad will also perform:
Cal Kinnear, in free exercise,
parallel bars, and side horse; and
Steve Knaehel, on trampoline and
rope climbing.
The gymnasts will be out to
avenge last year’s three-point loss
to S. F. State, and the match
ought to he a close one despite
Stanford inexperience.
