### Glenn Alford 
Stanford’s crew of baseball roaches conducted a highly success
ful baseball clinic last Saturday.
The clinic was “emceed” by Dutch Fehring, Stanford head base
ball coach, and pushed smoothly along by such other members of the
Stanford Athletic Department as Athletic Director A1 Masters, and
Ray Young and Bob Bollingbroke, assistant baseball coaches.
IT ATTRACTED an audience of over 400 at its height, and as
Fehring said, “Baseball has to be the top sport in America. What
other sport could drag all of you out on a rainy Saturday morning
at 9?”
Of the 400, about 225 were coaches, one was a Stanford professor
emeritus, a few were Stanford
• - - students and members of the

Card baseball learn, some were
interested parents and the rest
were children. Those who remem
ber Bill Kartozian will know this
writer’s feelings on that point.
The clinic was informative and
authoritative, '['hose baseball lu
minaries in attendance aside from
the Stanford staff were Alvin
Dark, manager of the Giants;
Mike McCormick, Giant pitcher;
Jim Davenport, Giant third-base
man; Ed Bressoud, Boston Rod
Sox shortstop; and Hobie Land
rish, New York Mets catcher.
LANDKITH GAVE tips on
catching, and passed out a few in
sights on the handling of major
league players. Such as, when an
inning is over, another player will
often come up to you and ask
what pitch the catcher signaled
for on a hall that was belled out

of the park. The catcher’s only
recourse is lo say, “If you’d been paying attention to the game, you’d
know.”
BRESSOUD AND DAVENPORT SPOKE
Bressoud and Davenport got up together and spoke about the
technique of playing the infield. Both are eminently qualified to do
(his. Davenport is considered the greatest fielding third baseman in
baseball today, and Bressoud ranks among the top short-stops.
In the question-and-answer session at the end of the program,
Davenport was asked if he could handle anything that was hit within
his reach. Dark butted in. "He’d better.”
McCORMICK TALKED about the pitcher’s chores other than
throwing the ball to the plate; such as covering bases, pick-off plays,
and the like. In the questions and answers he was asked about how a
pitcher can improve his control. He replied (hat it was difficult, and
that day in and day out work was necessary.

He added that today in the National League, the strike zone has
gone from between the arm-pits to the knees, to between the belt
and the belt-buckle.

Dark spoke for about fifteen
minutes about the methods that
are called strategy. He said that
the manager’s best strategy is to
know his players, and derided the
effect of strategy in baseball say
ing that strategy-wise, the best
manager in the National Circuit
is Gene Mauch, and everybody
knows where the Phillies finished
last year’.

This clinic pointed out a big
problem in (he Stanford athletic
program. The crowd at the clinic
could possibly be bigger than the
combined Stanford home attend
ance at all baseball games this
year. Why isn’t anyone interested
in Stanford baseball?
BASEBALLERS ARE
CONSISTENT WINNERS
It can’t be the calibre of play.
Stanford hasn’t had a losing sea
son in the last several years. The
teams played are tough, and are
mostly close rivals of Stanford.
Each of the last two years,
Stanford has once defeated USC
here in league play, and the string
may extend farther back than
that. Everyone knows that USC
was the number one college team
in the nation last year, and high
up the year before that.

Yet the combined attendance at
those two wins probably did not
exceed 100. This is ridiculous.
It is so bad, that the aforemen
tioned professor emertius button
holed me at the clinic and offered
to spend his own free time and
effort to publicize the Stanford
baseball team in the surrounding
area for no repayment hut ex
pense money. He was sick at the
lack of campus response to what
has been called America’s “Na
tional Pastime.”

If attendance is any measure

may take over (bat mantle.

McCORMICK TALKED about the pitcher’s chores other than
throwing the ball to the plate; such as covering bases, pick-off plays,
and the like. In the questions and answers he was asked about how a
pitcher can improve his control. He replied (hat it was difficult, and
that day in and day out work was necessary.

He added that today in the National League, the strike zone has
gone from between the arm-pits to the knees, to between the belt
and the belt-buckle.

Dark spoke for about fifteen
minutes about the methods that
are called strategy. He said that
the manager’s best strategy is to
know his players, and derided the

manager in the National Circuit
is Gene Mauch, and everybody
knows where the Phillies finished
last year’.

This clinic pointed out a big
problem in (he Stanford athletic
program. The crowd at the clinic
could possibly be bigger than the
combined Stanford home attend
ance at all baseball games this
year. Why isn’t anyone interested
in Stanford baseball?
BASEBALLERS ARE
CONSISTENT WINNERS
It can’t be the calibre of play.
Stanford hasn’t had a losing sea
son in the last several years. The
teams played are tough, and are
mostly close rivals of Stanford.
Each of the last two years,
Stanford has once defeated USC
here in league play, and the string
may extend farther back than
that. Everyone knows that USC
was the number one college team
in the nation last year, and high
up the year before that.

Yet the combined attendance at
those two wins probably did not
exceed 100. This is ridiculous.
It is so bad, that the aforemen

holed me at the clinic and offered

DUTCH FEHRING
Stanford head baseball coach
Stanford’s crew of baseball roaches conducted a highly success
ful baseball clinic last Saturday.
The clinic was “emceed” by Dutch Fehring, Stanford head base
ball coach, and pushed smoothly along by such other members of the
Stanford Athletic Department as Athletic Director A1 Masters, and
Ray Young and Bob Bollingbroke, assistant baseball coaches.
IT ATTRACTED an audience of over 400 at its height, and as
Fehring said, “Baseball has to be the top sport in America. What
other sport could drag all of you out on a rainy Saturday morning
at 9?”
Of the 400, about 225 were coaches, one was a Stanford professor
emeritus, a few were Stanford
• - - students and members of the

Card baseball learn, some were
interested parents and the rest
were children. Those who remem
ber Bill Kartozian will know this
writer’s feelings on that point.
The clinic was informative and
authoritative, '['hose baseball lu
minaries in attendance aside from
the Stanford staff were Alvin
Dark, manager of the Giants;
Mike McCormick, Giant pitcher;
Jim Davenport, Giant third-base
man; Ed Bressoud, Boston Rod
Sox shortstop; and Hobie Land
rish, New York Mets catcher.
LANDKITH GAVE tips on
catching, and passed out a few in
sights on the handling of major
league players. Such as, when an
inning is over, another player will
often come up to you and ask
what pitch the catcher signaled
for on a hall that was belled out

of the park. The catcher’s only
recourse is lo say, “If you’d been paying attention to the game, you’d
know.”
BRESSOUD AND DAVENPORT SPOKE
Bressoud and Davenport got up together and spoke about the
technique of playing the infield. Both are eminently qualified to do
(his. Davenport is considered the greatest fielding third baseman in
baseball today, and Bressoud ranks among the top short-stops.
In the question-and-answer session at the end of the program,

DUTCH FEHRING
Stanford head baseball coach
Stanford’s crew of baseball roaches conducted a highly success
ful baseball clinic last Saturday.
The clinic was “emceed” by Dutch Fehring, Stanford head base
ball coach, and pushed smoothly along by such other members of the
Stanford Athletic Department as Athletic Director A1 Masters, and
Ray Young and Bob Bollingbroke, assistant baseball coaches.
IT ATTRACTED an audience of over 400 at its height, and as
Fehring said, “Baseball has to be the top sport in America. What
other sport could drag all of you out on a rainy Saturday morning
at 9?”
Of the 400, about 225 were coaches, one was a Stanford professor
emeritus, a few were Stanford
• - - students and members of the

Card baseball learn, some were
interested parents and the rest
were children. Those who remem
ber Bill Kartozian will know this
writer’s feelings on that point.
The clinic was informative and
authoritative, '['hose baseball lu
minaries in attendance aside from
the Stanford staff were Alvin
Dark, manager of the Giants;
Mike McCormick, Giant pitcher;
Jim Davenport, Giant third-base
man; Ed Bressoud, Boston Rod
Sox shortstop; and Hobie Land
rish, New York Mets catcher.
LANDKITH GAVE tips on
catching, and passed out a few in
sights on the handling of major
league players. Such as, when an
inning is over, another player will
often come up to you and ask
what pitch the catcher signaled
for on a hall that was belled out

of the park. The catcher’s only
recourse is lo say, “If you’d been paying attention to the game, you’d
know.”
BRESSOUD AND DAVENPORT SPOKE
Bressoud and Davenport got up together and spoke about the
technique of playing the infield. Both are eminently qualified to do
(his. Davenport is considered the greatest fielding third baseman in
baseball today, and Bressoud ranks among the top short-stops.
In the question-and-answer session at the end of the program,
Davenport was asked if he could handle anything that was hit within
his reach. Dark butted in. "He’d better.”
McCORMICK TALKED about the pitcher’s chores other than
throwing the ball to the plate; such as covering bases, pick-off plays,
and the like. In the questions and answers he was asked about how a
pitcher can improve his control. He replied (hat it was difficult, and
that day in and day out work was necessary.

He added that today in the National League, the strike zone has
gone from between the arm-pits to the knees, to between the belt
and the belt-buckle.

Dark spoke for about fifteen
minutes about the methods that
are called strategy. He said that
the manager’s best strategy is to
know his players, and derided the
effect of strategy in baseball say
ing that strategy-wise, the best
manager in the National Circuit
is Gene Mauch, and everybody
knows where the Phillies finished
last year’.

This clinic pointed out a big
problem in (he Stanford athletic
program. The crowd at the clinic
could possibly be bigger than the
combined Stanford home attend
ance at all baseball games this
year. Why isn’t anyone interested
in Stanford baseball?
BASEBALLERS ARE
CONSISTENT WINNERS
It can’t be the calibre of play.
Stanford hasn’t had a losing sea
son in the last several years. The
teams played are tough, and are
mostly close rivals of Stanford.
Each of the last two years,
Stanford has once defeated USC
here in league play, and the string
may extend farther back than
that. Everyone knows that USC
was the number one college team
in the nation last year, and high
up the year before that.

Yet the combined attendance at
those two wins probably did not
exceed 100. This is ridiculous.
