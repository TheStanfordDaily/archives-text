WASHINGTON (UPI) For
mer Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker
has been scratched from the pro
gram of a Madison Square Gar
den rally as a result of objec
tions by GOP Sens. Barry Gold
water, Ariz., and John G. Tower,
Tex., it was learned Tuesday.
Walker’s invitation to appear
at the March 7 rally in New York
City was withdrawn by Young
Americans for Freedom. The con
servative youth group advised the
former general his appearance
might be taken as an endorsement
of his Democratic candidacy for
governor of Texas.
Walker said in Dallas, however,
that as far as he knew, the invi
tation had not been withdrawn.
He said he had been invited by
Goldwater.
A spokesman for Tower said
the question of Walker’s appear
ance was raised with both Tower
and Goldwater, who are to deliver
speeches at the rally, before the
former division commander jump
ed into the Texas gubernatorial
race.
Goldwater was reported to have
told the group ho would not par
ticipate if Walker was retained.
Tower apparently shared this
feeling but did not take as strong
a position.
