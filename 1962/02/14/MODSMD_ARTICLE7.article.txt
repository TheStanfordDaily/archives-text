# Gros Calls Khrushchev Nerveless

### 
Advertising executive Robert
Gros last night sandwiched a few
revealing personal glimpses of
Premier Khrushchev between a
mass of commonplace observa
tions about the cold war and the
Soviet system to produce a rea
sonably amusing, if not unusually
enlightening. Tuesday evening
lecture.
The heart of Gros’ talk was
contained in his observations of
Khrushchev during a four-hour
reception at the Soviet embassy
last November. Perhaps the most
revealing of these was his descrip
tion of Mr. K. as "the most total
ly nerveless human being” ho had
ever met, “a simple relaxed peas
ant” absorbed totally in the mo
mentary diversion of a second
rate variety show'. The feeling
that Khrushchev isn’t nervous
was somewhat comforting, said
Gros, for it lessened the chance of
a blowup which would lead to
war.
Gros’ personal observations of
“the most powerful man in the
world,” also included the fact that
ho is on a very strict and temper
ate diet, attributed to severe
health problems, and several of
Mr. K’s ever-present quips, such
as “I was a Christian once,” when
asked why ho quoted from the
Bible so much. The most impor
tant thing, however, was not to
underestimate this man.
Among Gros’ comparisons of
Soviet life in 1953 and 1961, the
most unusual concerned the qual
ity of Russian clothing. While
many observers have reported
that the Russians are ill-clothed,
Gros noted that while the styles
certainly cannot be compared to
the West, the quality of the ma
terial was. in his opinion, as good
as that in prosperous Western
Europe.
All success in industry was dis
missed by Gros as a result of
American-type incentive plans.
This led him to conclude that
America would not be overtaken
economically by the Soviets.
