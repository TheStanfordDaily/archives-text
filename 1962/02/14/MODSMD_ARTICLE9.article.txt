# BACKS WASHINGTON PROTEST
## Peace Rally Set For Library Lawn 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ 
At 9 a.m. Friday a group of
Stanford students will gather in
front of the Main Libe to support
a “Turn Toward Peace” demon
stration scheduled in Washington,
D.C., the same day.
The Washington demonstrators
are protesting what they have
termed “the essentially military
response of the United States to
the Soviet challenge . . . inade
quate, self-defeating, and pro
foundly dangerous.”
THE STANFORD GROUP in a
statement of purpose, said, “We,
as individuals, have become con
cerned with the threat of impend
ing nuclear war. We are appalled
by the growing militarism of both
the United States and the Soviet
Union. We feel that now, more
than ever, solutions short of war
must be sought.”
The demonstration will be ac
cented by the display in the Labe’s
main inside stairway showing the
evils of nuclear bomb tests and
advocating steps to be taken to
end them.
Literature and information will
be available in front of the li
brary from 9 to 4, and a pi’ogram
of folk singing and short student
speeches is planned from 12 to
1:15 p.m.
The events are part of a na
tional peace coordinating move
ment, “Turn Toward Peace.”
Sponsors of the Washington rally
include Stringellow Barr, Norman
Cousins, Jules Feiffer, Seymour
Melman, Hans Morgenthau, Da
vid Riesman, and Norman Thorn-

THE PEACE organizations
“urge the United States to take
the following initiatives:
To announce that it will not re
sume atmospheric testing of nu

clear weapons, to invite the U.N.
to establish a monitoxing system
within our territory, and then to
invite the other woxdd powers to
follow suit.
Not to provide nuclear weapons
to those powers not presently in
possession of them.
To seek disengagement in Cen
tral Europe.
To commit itself fully to the
struggle against poverty, hunger
and disease throughout the world,
channeling these efforts through
the U.N. and calling on other
countries to follow our lead.
To declax-e that fallout shelters
offer no real protection from nu
clear war.”
IN WASHINGTON, the White
House and other government
buildings will be picketed by stu
dents and faculty members w'ho
will hand out policy statements.
"We wish to meet squarely the
danger presented to democratic
values by Soviet ideology and
Communist expansionism,” states
the national group. “We do not
accept present foreign policy. In
stead we urge all countries to
lake initiatives toward a lasting
peace.”

RECENT action in the “peace
movement” on campus has includ
ed acceptance of the “Non-Violent
Alternatives to War” group as a
legal organization, faculty semi
nars dealing with the project, and
the HR Foreign Policy Institute.
