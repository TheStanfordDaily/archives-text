Like, Go Man
Buy the Quad
No advertising in this
year’s Quad. That’s what they
tell us. The Quad is reported
to be bigger, better, and more
beautiful than last year’s
(Can you believe that, eh?)
and what’s more, they are
taking orders today at En
gineering Corner and in front
of the Post Office from 9 to 5.
The Quad would also like
to admonish Frosh to hurry
and buy their one and only
very own copy of the Frosh
Book—only a few copies left.
