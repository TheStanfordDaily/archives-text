# First Nine Months of Stanford-in-Japan Reviewed: Favorable

(Editor's Nolo: Professor John D. Goheen,
head of the Philosophy Department, who
served as director of the Stanford Japanese
Center for the first nine months, lias been

Treasure for Ids contribution to U.S.-Japa
nese cultural and educational relations.)

Nine months have passed since the impres
sive ceremonies were held to open the Stan
ford Center in Tokyo last spring. Notwith
standing unique problems involved in its
establishment, the Center is emerging to
provide extraordinary opportunities for
study in this part of the world. Those of us
studying here during the first year are hav
ing a noteworthy experience.
The center is in many respects a pioneer
ing venture. There were few precedents to
follow in establishing a branch campus in
the Far East. Of necessity there had to be a
certain amount of experimenting with meth
ods and facilities. This, together with prob
lems of adjusting to new surroundings and
the acknowledged complexity of the Japanese
language, has compounded the challenge
which we have confronted in these months.

OFFICES of the Center are pleasantly
situated in a stately old mansion, once owned

by a deposed feudal lord. The classrooms and
a small specialized library are in an adjoin
ing. recently-completed classroom building,
owned by a privately endowed Japanese
foundation. Aside from the director and the
assistant director, the Center staff is entirely
made up of Japanese.
In these early months the most frustrating
problem for us, as students, has been grasp
ing a basic knowledge of this cumbersome
but fascinating language. Most of us had a
comparatively short background—a year or
so of study in the States—before coming to
Japan.

Most of us expected that once we were in
the native setting wc would make ‘‘the great
leap forward” and that reading speed and
conversational ability would blossom natural
ly. A few months here has tempered that
uninformed optimism.
Japanese is not so easily acquired by “os
mosis” as is a European language. Often
foreigners arc here for years and never
acquire even a rudimentary command of the
spoken language. It requires a groat deal of
discipline in oral drill, which in turn de
mands much in perseverance from the teach
er as well as the student. In the future the
Center may well place more emphasis on
intense oral training for newcomers.

ONE OF THE MOST perplexing problems
for the Center has been finding an able
group of teacher's. For instance, lecture
courses offered in history, economics, and
art history are given in English and it was
necessary to find Japanese scholars who
wore not only well-qualified in these fields,
but who also had a fluency in English.
On the other hand, language courses de
manded instructors who had the special
skill of teaching Japanese to foreigners. Of
necessity there has had to be some shuffling
of the staff, but in general the Center has
acquired instructors who are not only com
petent scholars but capable teachers as well.
Aside from the regularly scheduled
courses, the Center has had an interesting
schedule of meetings and lectures. Students
have met informally with Prime Minister
Ikeda, Ambassador Reischauer, Japanese
teachers and students, and American schol
ars working on research projects in Japan,
IN THE LONG BUN the most lasting and
rewarding contribution the Center will make
to us, as serious students of Japan and the
Far East, will be the opportunities for con
tact with Japanese scholars. Teachers at
Japanese universities have been especially
cooperative in taking on students at the Cen
ter in directed reading courses. Many such

individual tutorials are in progress now.
The enrollment during the first year has
numbered around twenty and has been about
evenly divided between undergraduates and
graduate students. Stanford’s Center in
Japan is probably best suited for graduate
study because of its specialized nature and
particularly because of the nature of the
language and the intensive study it demands.
Our ambassador has referred to Japanese as
the most difficult writing system still being
used in the world.

It requires an enormous amount of rote
memory work to learn the Chinese-Japanese
characters. For this reason some of us feel
that it is better not to burden a general un
dergraduate education with the slow and
endless task of memorizing characters. On
the other hand there are many who argue
that if one has an interest in this part of the
world he cannot start too early to learn the
language.
Although we have had many of the same
difficulties with the language and with ad
justment to our environs, the variety of ex
perience among us is remarkable. The under
graduate men live with Japanese students in
a dormitory adjacent to the Center. The
women undergraduates live in the dormi
tories of the nearby Japan Women’s Univer-

SINGLE GRADUATE students are scat
tered throughout Tokyo, living with Japa
nese families. Married graduate students are
also living in all parts of the metropolis,
having found their own housing. Each in his
own surroundings has found no dearth of
opportunity to practice the language.
Students are involved in a variety of out
side activities. Many are playing Japanese
sports or studying the traditional arts. There
is ample time for travel. As this is written,
during Christmas vacation, students are
sightseeing in Kyoto, skiing in the Japan
Alps with Tokyo University students, travel
ing in Korea, visiting with newly-made Japa
nese friends.

That the Center has successfully passed
through a difficult period of trial and error
owes much to the wisdom of its director
during these months, Professor John Go
been. In the absence of established prece
dents, he has listened with patience and
interest to our response to the problems
which have arisen. Sometimes these inac
tions have been the only guide to follow. In
the future universities will establish
branches in the Far East and will doubtless
be guided by the path broken by the Stan
ford Center.

dergraduate education with the slow and
endless task of memorizing characters. On
the other hand there are many who argue
that if one has an interest in this part of the
world he cannot start too early to learn the
language.
Although we have had many of the same
difficulties with the language and with ad
justment to our environs, the variety of ex
perience among us is remarkable. The under
graduate men live with Japanese students in
a dormitory adjacent to the Center. The
women undergraduates live in the dormi
tories of the nearby Japan Women’s Univer-

SINGLE GRADUATE students are scat
tered throughout Tokyo, living with Japa
nese families. Married graduate students are
also living in all parts of the metropolis,
having found their own housing. Each in his
own surroundings has found no dearth of
opportunity to practice the language.
Students are involved in a variety of out
side activities. Many are playing Japanese
sports or studying the traditional arts. There
is ample time for travel. As this is written,
during Christmas vacation, students are
sightseeing in Kyoto, skiing in the Japan
Alps with Tokyo University students, travel
ing in Korea, visiting with newly-made Japa
nese friends.

That the Center has successfully passed
through a difficult period of trial and error
owes much to the wisdom of its director
during these months, Professor John Go
been. In the absence of established prece
dents, he has listened with patience and
interest to our response to the problems
which have arisen. Sometimes these inac
tions have been the only guide to follow. In
the future universities will establish
branches in the Far East and will doubtless
be guided by the path broken by the Stan
ford Center.

Nine months have passed since the impres
sive ceremonies were held to open the Stan
ford Center in Tokyo last spring. Notwith
standing unique problems involved in its
establishment, the Center is emerging to
provide extraordinary opportunities for
study in this part of the world. Those of us
studying here during the first year are hav
ing a noteworthy experience.
The center is in many respects a pioneer
ing venture. There were few precedents to
follow in establishing a branch campus in
the Far East. Of necessity there had to be a
certain amount of experimenting with meth
ods and facilities. This, together with prob
lems of adjusting to new surroundings and
the acknowledged complexity of the Japanese
language, has compounded the challenge
which we have confronted in these months.

OFFICES of the Center are pleasantly
situated in a stately old mansion, once owned

by a deposed feudal lord. The classrooms and
a small specialized library are in an adjoin
ing. recently-completed classroom building,
owned by a privately endowed Japanese
foundation. Aside from the director and the
assistant director, the Center staff is entirely
made up of Japanese.
In these early months the most frustrating
problem for us, as students, has been grasp
ing a basic knowledge of this cumbersome
but fascinating language. Most of us had a
comparatively short background—a year or
so of study in the States—before coming to
Japan.

Most of us expected that once we were in
the native setting wc would make ‘‘the great
leap forward” and that reading speed and
conversational ability would blossom natural
ly. A few months here has tempered that
uninformed optimism.
Japanese is not so easily acquired by “os
mosis” as is a European language. Often
foreigners arc here for years and never
acquire even a rudimentary command of the
spoken language. It requires a groat deal of
discipline in oral drill, which in turn de
mands much in perseverance from the teach
er as well as the student. In the future the
Center may well place more emphasis on
intense oral training for newcomers.

ONE OF THE MOST perplexing problems
for the Center has been finding an able
group of teacher's. For instance, lecture
courses offered in history, economics, and
art history are given in English and it was
necessary to find Japanese scholars who
wore not only well-qualified in these fields,
but who also had a fluency in English.
On the other hand, language courses de
manded instructors who had the special
skill of teaching Japanese to foreigners. Of
necessity there has had to be some shuffling
of the staff, but in general the Center has
acquired instructors who are not only com
petent scholars but capable teachers as well.
Aside from the regularly scheduled
courses, the Center has had an interesting
schedule of meetings and lectures. Students
have met informally with Prime Minister
Ikeda, Ambassador Reischauer, Japanese
teachers and students, and American schol
ars working on research projects in Japan,
IN THE LONG BUN the most lasting and
rewarding contribution the Center will make
to us, as serious students of Japan and the
Far East, will be the opportunities for con
tact with Japanese scholars. Teachers at
Japanese universities have been especially
cooperative in taking on students at the Cen
ter in directed reading courses. Many such

individual tutorials are in progress now.
The enrollment during the first year has
numbered around twenty and has been about
evenly divided between undergraduates and
graduate students. Stanford’s Center in
Japan is probably best suited for graduate
study because of its specialized nature and
particularly because of the nature of the
language and the intensive study it demands.
Our ambassador has referred to Japanese as
the most difficult writing system still being
used in the world.

It requires an enormous amount of rote
memory work to learn the Chinese-Japanese
characters. For this reason some of us feel
that it is better not to burden a general un
dergraduate education with the slow and
endless task of memorizing characters. On

art history are given in English and it was
necessary to find Japanese scholars who
wore not only well-qualified in these fields,
but who also had a fluency in English.
On the other hand, language courses de
manded instructors who had the special
skill of teaching Japanese to foreigners. Of
necessity there has had to be some shuffling
of the staff, but in general the Center has
acquired instructors who are not only com
petent scholars but capable teachers as well.
Aside from the regularly scheduled
courses, the Center has had an interesting
schedule of meetings and lectures. Students
have met informally with Prime Minister
Ikeda, Ambassador Reischauer, Japanese
teachers and students, and American schol
ars working on research projects in Japan,
IN THE LONG BUN the most lasting and
rewarding contribution the Center will make
to us, as serious students of Japan and the
Far East, will be the opportunities for con
tact with Japanese scholars. Teachers at
Japanese universities have been especially
cooperative in taking on students at the Cen
ter in directed reading courses. Many such

individual tutorials are in progress now.
The enrollment during the first year has
numbered around twenty and has been about
evenly divided between undergraduates and
graduate students. Stanford’s Center in
Japan is probably best suited for graduate
study because of its specialized nature and
particularly because of the nature of the
language and the intensive study it demands.
Our ambassador has referred to Japanese as
the most difficult writing system still being
used in the world.

It requires an enormous amount of rote
memory work to learn the Chinese-Japanese
characters. For this reason some of us feel
that it is better not to burden a general un
dergraduate education with the slow and
endless task of memorizing characters. On
the other hand there are many who argue
that if one has an interest in this part of the
world he cannot start too early to learn the
language.
Although we have had many of the same
difficulties with the language and with ad
justment to our environs, the variety of ex
perience among us is remarkable. The under
graduate men live with Japanese students in
a dormitory adjacent to the Center. The
women undergraduates live in the dormi
tories of the nearby Japan Women’s Univer-

SINGLE GRADUATE students are scat
tered throughout Tokyo, living with Japa
nese families. Married graduate students are
also living in all parts of the metropolis,
having found their own housing. Each in his
own surroundings has found no dearth of
opportunity to practice the language.
Students are involved in a variety of out
side activities. Many are playing Japanese
sports or studying the traditional arts. There
is ample time for travel. As this is written,
during Christmas vacation, students are
sightseeing in Kyoto, skiing in the Japan
Alps with Tokyo University students, travel
ing in Korea, visiting with newly-made Japa
nese friends.

That the Center has successfully passed
through a difficult period of trial and error
owes much to the wisdom of its director
during these months, Professor John Go
been. In the absence of established prece
dents, he has listened with patience and
interest to our response to the problems
which have arisen. Sometimes these inac
tions have been the only guide to follow. In
the future universities will establish
branches in the Far East and will doubtless
be guided by the path broken by the Stan
ford Center.

Nine months have passed since the impres
sive ceremonies were held to open the Stan
ford Center in Tokyo last spring. Notwith
standing unique problems involved in its
establishment, the Center is emerging to
provide extraordinary opportunities for
study in this part of the world. Those of us
studying here during the first year are hav
ing a noteworthy experience.
The center is in many respects a pioneer
ing venture. There were few precedents to
follow in establishing a branch campus in
the Far East. Of necessity there had to be a
certain amount of experimenting with meth
ods and facilities. This, together with prob
lems of adjusting to new surroundings and
the acknowledged complexity of the Japanese
language, has compounded the challenge
which we have confronted in these months.

OFFICES of the Center are pleasantly
situated in a stately old mansion, once owned

by a deposed feudal lord. The classrooms and
a small specialized library are in an adjoin
ing. recently-completed classroom building,
owned by a privately endowed Japanese
foundation. Aside from the director and the
assistant director, the Center staff is entirely
made up of Japanese.
In these early months the most frustrating
problem for us, as students, has been grasp
ing a basic knowledge of this cumbersome
but fascinating language. Most of us had a
comparatively short background—a year or
so of study in the States—before coming to
Japan.

Most of us expected that once we were in
the native setting wc would make ‘‘the great
leap forward” and that reading speed and
conversational ability would blossom natural
ly. A few months here has tempered that
uninformed optimism.
Japanese is not so easily acquired by “os
mosis” as is a European language. Often
foreigners arc here for years and never
acquire even a rudimentary command of the
spoken language. It requires a groat deal of
discipline in oral drill, which in turn de
mands much in perseverance from the teach
er as well as the student. In the future the
Center may well place more emphasis on
intense oral training for newcomers.

group of teacher's. For instance, lecture
