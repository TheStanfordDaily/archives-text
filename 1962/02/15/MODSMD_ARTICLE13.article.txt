## 
### VIVI BOZMAN 
(Editor’s Note: This is (lie sec
ond of two articles on the recent
conference held in San Francisco
in opposition to the Christian An
lo t omniunism ( rnsade.)

An interested spectator at the
afternoon panel was Dr. Fred
Schwarz, who arrived late with a
group of his “camp followers,” as
Dr. Bunzel characterized them.
In answer to Dr. Schwarz's re
quest for a definition of the radi
cal right, Bunzel termed Schwarz
“an itinerant medicine man, offer
ing a quick-cure to a modern
‘disease’ ”. Dr. Bunzel elaborated
on this definition in an interview,
noting “Schwarz has something
to sell and he uses modern day
techniques TV, mass media, etc.
—to sell it. And there are always
plenty of people who are ready
to buy the medicine he pre
scribes.
“Dr, Schwarz’s question cannot
be answered, since ho adopts the
pose of standing only ‘for’ anti
communism,” Howe noted. “If he
is seriously ‘anti - Communist,’
why does he not invite qualified
liberal anti-Communists such as
Arthur Schlesinger to lecture at
his school? Why hasn’t he invited
me? I wrote a book on the sub
ject,” (The American Communist
Party: A Critical History),
Evening speakers at the con
ference were John O'Connell,
Stale Assemblyman, and Rev.
Charles S. McCoy, Professor of
Religion and Higher Education,
Pacific School of Religion, Ber
keley.
O’Connell asserted that the real
aim of the radical right, who at

lempt In package love of God and
fear of the threat from within
and without, is the defeat of liber
al legislation and social reform.

“As a Christian, I am embar
rassed at Dr. Schwarz’s ‘Christian
Anti-Communism Crusade,” Mc-
Coy stated. He characterized the
radical right as an unfortunate
response to a “void in creative
leadership.”
The evening panel discussed

“The Impact of Right Wing Ex
tremism on the Community.”
Seymour Lipset, University of
California Sociology Professor,
noted that the Communists’
“greatest strength is among the
poorest people,” contrary to
Schwarz’s claim that the basic
appeal of the Communists is to
the intellectual. Lipset cited the
way to weaken Communism as
the solving of the problem of pov
erty.

Panel members termed the radi
cal right a “judgment upon our
own political irresponsibility" and
urged that we become active, in
terested, responsible citizens, thus
underlining the basic message of
the conference,
Bunzel summarized this atti
tude in an interview when he
stated, “The task to expose these
inroads into our constitutional
procedures should be borne equal
ly by liberals and conservatives.”
Lipset, too, summarized the
tone of the conference when he
said, “Wo are all anticommu
nist. We challenge certain peo
ple's effectiveness in fighting
Communism, however, and in fact
consider their efforts a hinder
ance to effective opposition to
Communists.”

Evening speakers at the con
ference were John O'Connell,
Stale Assemblyman, and Rev.
Charles S. McCoy, Professor of
Religion and Higher Education,
Pacific School of Religion, Ber
keley.
O’Connell asserted that the real
aim of the radical right, who at

lempt In package love of God and
fear of the threat from within
and without, is the defeat of liber
al legislation and social reform.

“As a Christian, I am embar
rassed at Dr. Schwarz’s ‘Christian
Anti-Communism Crusade,” Mc-
Coy stated. He characterized the
radical right as an unfortunate
response to a “void in creative
leadership.”
The evening panel discussed

“The Impact of Right Wing Ex
tremism on the Community.”
Seymour Lipset, University of
California Sociology Professor,
noted that the Communists’
“greatest strength is among the
poorest people,” contrary to
Schwarz’s claim that the basic
appeal of the Communists is to
the intellectual. Lipset cited the
way to weaken Communism as
the solving of the problem of pov
erty.

Panel members termed the radi
cal right a “judgment upon our
own political irresponsibility" and
urged that we become active, in
terested, responsible citizens, thus
underlining the basic message of
the conference,
Bunzel summarized this atti
tude in an interview when he
stated, “The task to expose these
inroads into our constitutional
procedures should be borne equal
ly by liberals and conservatives.”
Lipset, too, summarized the
tone of the conference when he
said, “Wo are all anticommu
nist. We challenge certain peo
ple's effectiveness in fighting
Communism, however, and in fact
consider their efforts a hinder
ance to effective opposition to
Communists.”
(Editor’s Note: This is (lie sec

conference held in San Francisco
in opposition to the Christian An
lo t omniunism ( rnsade.)

An interested spectator at the
afternoon panel was Dr. Fred
Schwarz, who arrived late with a
group of his “camp followers,” as
Dr. Bunzel characterized them.
In answer to Dr. Schwarz's re
quest for a definition of the radi
cal right, Bunzel termed Schwarz
“an itinerant medicine man, offer
ing a quick-cure to a modern
‘disease’ ”. Dr. Bunzel elaborated
on this definition in an interview,
noting “Schwarz has something
to sell and he uses modern day
techniques TV, mass media, etc.
—to sell it. And there are always
plenty of people who are ready
to buy the medicine he pre
scribes.
“Dr, Schwarz’s question cannot
be answered, since ho adopts the
pose of standing only ‘for’ anti
communism,” Howe noted. “If he
is seriously ‘anti - Communist,’
why does he not invite qualified
liberal anti-Communists such as
Arthur Schlesinger to lecture at
his school? Why hasn’t he invited
me? I wrote a book on the sub
ject,” (The American Communist
Party: A Critical History),
