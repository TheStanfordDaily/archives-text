WARSAW GHETTO
Editor, The Daily;
Mr, Alan Rosenthal repeats his
statement that the “Warsaw ghet
to would never have been possible
but for the attitude of the Poles
themselves.” He promises to
“prove his point” by describing
what he calls the picture of pre
war Poland. Acknowledging a
small minority of courageous
Polos w'ho helped the Jews during
the war, he then cites the perse
cutions of Jews in post-war Po
land for further support of his
thesis.
It is not the purpose of this
letter to deny the existence of
anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism cer
tainly did exist in Poland as it
did throughout Europe and 1 de
plore this and feel a sense of uni
ty with Mr. Rosenthal about his
resentment of anti-Semitism. I
also profoundly respect his feel
ings of indignation about the
murder of Polish citizens of Jew
ish faith.
Yet, I object to his letter on the
following counts:
Air. Rosenthal, 11) confuses
chronological data, (2) vastly
oversimplifies h i s deductions,
and. finally, (3) “proves” that he
is ignorant of the history of the
Second World War.
(1) MR, ROSENTHAL is using
the periods between 1918-1939 (in
dependent Poland) and 1945 on
(Poland under Communist re
gime i to provide proof for his
interpretation of what happened
in Warsaw between 1940 and
1943 when the city was in the
deadly grip of the German occu
pational forces. Not only chron
ology is confused here. So is Mr.
Rosenthal in lacking the insight
into human behavior, under
stress.
(2) As one who lived in War
saw throughout the German oc
cupation of that city, including
the time of the ghetto’s destruc
tion, I want to assure Mr. Rosen
thal that Polish citizens, other
than those of the Jewish faith,
were murdered daily on the
streets of Warsaw by the German
security police the numbers
sometimes ran literally into hun
dreds.
As one who lost several friends
in the ghetto and helplessly wit
nessed its destruction, I resent
inferences that the majority of
Polish citizens were approving,
condoning, or in collusion with
the Germans and/or their actions
against Poles of Jewish faith. In
asserting this Mr. Rosenthal re
veals pathetic ignorance, of the
local conditions.
(3) AIR. ROSENTHAL’S asser
tion that if it would not have

been for the Polish “attitude” the
ghetto would never have been
possible in German-occupied Po
land and then citing the behavior
of the Dutch populations and that
of the King of Denmark as a par
allel example, reveals a lack in
Air. Rosenthal’s general knowl
edge of the German policies to
ward occupied Europe during
World War II and particularly to
ward Slavs: Poles and Russians.
Germans during the occupation
of Holland maintained Dutch
laws, Dutch administrative per
sonnel and the Dutch court sys
tem. The same policy was applied
in Denmark where even the King
was kept in a position of authori
ty and strong enough to resist
German pressures, at least until
the Fall of 1943,
Although the infringements of
the German administration were
severe, all of these institutions
provided the Dutch and Danish
people some room for self-asser
tion. None of this was possible in
Poland. There was no semblance
of Polish government recognized
by the Germans. The naked ter
ror ruled with curfews, deporta
tions, executions, and clubbing
into submission. Under these con
ditions, the Polish “anti-Semites”
shared the fate of their Polish
brothers of Jewish faith who
w 7 ere “on the other side of the
wall.”
At any rate, on German author
ity the wholesale deportation
from Holland and Denmark of al
most the entire Jewish popula
tion ultimately took place—Dutch
and Danish attitudes notwith
standing.
As an alumnus I know that
Stanford is a good place to pur
sue the truth, which, I under
stand, Mr. Rosenthal is seeking.
I hope that Mr. Rosenthal will
take full advantage of this oppor
tunity.

COED IN STERN?
Editor, The Daily:
Recently, there has been much
discussion of coeducational living
groups at Stanford, but it will be
at least three years before the
still- tentatively coeducatoinal
Robert Moore Hall is completed.
To enable the present student
body to take advantage of the
tremendous opportunities for per
sonal growth that are possible
only within a coeducational sys
tem. it is necessary to alter ex
isting living facilities.
Stern Hall is the most readily
alterable dormitory on campus,
and, in addition, it can he altered

to provide the optimum conditions
that a coeducational living sys
tem needs if it is to develop suc
cessfully.
The Stern House Presidents
Council, representing the whole
of Stern, has unanimously re
solved that at least part of Stern
Hall should be made coeducation
al, no later than autumn quarter
of 1962. The Faculty Residents
in Stern, Drs. Wilfred H. Stone,
Edwin J. Doyle, and Milton Van
Dyke, as well as John Balch, are
all in favor of this proposal.
In Roble, Branner, and Flor
ence Moore Halls, and in Lagu
nita Court, many interested wom
en are waiting for an opportunity
to participate in a coeducational
living group.
All of the elements that would
compose a successful coeduca
tional system are available for
use in. Stern. We are looking to
the Stanford administration to
help us institute coeducational
living in Stern Hall next year.

Y" IT’S GREAT
Editor, The Daily:
Last November, I went to
UCLA with a student committee
connected with Stern Hall, to
gather information about the ad
vantages and problems of coed
housing. By staying in one of the
two coed dorms and by talking
with deans, dorm officers, and
residents, wo gathered much in
formation, from which I have
reached these general observa
tions;
1. Coed living is a natural an
swer to problems of student rela
tionships. Often, the only contact
we have with fellow students, es
pecially of the opposite sex, is in
casual classroom acquaintances
or in an artificial dating atmos
phere. The coed housing situa
tion lessens the superficiality of
seeing others only as potential
“conquests,” while fostering re
laxed, close friendships between
the sexes. Our investigations sug
gest that, rather than turning in
to a “marriage mill,” the coed
dorm becomes a common ground
for getting to know members of
the opposite sex as people,
2. Coed living is great. By stay
ing in one of the coed dorms, we
got a sample of what coed living
is like in practice. The students
were well-groomed, there was no
abusive language floating around,

conversations at meals and in the
lounges were much more stimu
lating, students seemed generally
more animated in their activities,
and honest, girls, putting on lip
stick for breakfast really isn’t
that terrible!
In connection with Stanford:
3. Stern Hall, with its court
yards, low buildings, and small
lounges, affords a pleasant set
ting for a coed living system.
4. The size of Stern’s houses is
conducive to successful coed hous
ing. In Stern, a single living
group comprises a convenient
number—4o men and 40 women
thereby minimizing problems of
government, control, and house
pride.
I believe that Stanford will ben
efit from a coed living system and
I hope all interested students will
vigorously support current ef
forts to integrate Stern Hall.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.
Editor, Tin* Daily:
The answer to Miss Strain’s
questions regarding possible po
litical influence on the proposed
Taiwan study center obviously is
yes. Political considerations exist
wherever Stanford has overseas
establishments. The major rea
son for which we prefer Taiwan
to Hong Kong as a study center
for Mandarin Chinese is that Tai
wan is a Mandarin Chinese-speak
ing community, whereas the chief
languages of the British Crown
Colony of Hong Kong are English
and Cantonese.

Y" IT’S GREAT
Editor, The Daily:
Last November, I went to
UCLA with a student committee
connected with Stern Hall, to
gather information about the ad
vantages and problems of coed
housing. By staying in one of the
two coed dorms and by talking
with deans, dorm officers, and
residents, wo gathered much in
formation, from which I have
reached these general observa
tions;
1. Coed living is a natural an
swer to problems of student rela
tionships. Often, the only contact
we have with fellow students, es
pecially of the opposite sex, is in
casual classroom acquaintances
or in an artificial dating atmos
phere. The coed housing situa
tion lessens the superficiality of
seeing others only as potential
“conquests,” while fostering re
laxed, close friendships between
the sexes. Our investigations sug
gest that, rather than turning in
to a “marriage mill,” the coed
dorm becomes a common ground
for getting to know members of
the opposite sex as people,
2. Coed living is great. By stay
ing in one of the coed dorms, we
got a sample of what coed living
is like in practice. The students
were well-groomed, there was no
abusive language floating around,

conversations at meals and in the
lounges were much more stimu
lating, students seemed generally
more animated in their activities,
and honest, girls, putting on lip
stick for breakfast really isn’t
that terrible!
In connection with Stanford:
3. Stern Hall, with its court
yards, low buildings, and small
lounges, affords a pleasant set
ting for a coed living system.
4. The size of Stern’s houses is
conducive to successful coed hous
ing. In Stern, a single living
group comprises a convenient
number—4o men and 40 women
thereby minimizing problems of
government, control, and house
pride.
I believe that Stanford will ben
efit from a coed living system and
I hope all interested students will
vigorously support current ef
forts to integrate Stern Hall.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.
Editor, Tin* Daily:
The answer to Miss Strain’s
questions regarding possible po
litical influence on the proposed
Taiwan study center obviously is
yes. Political considerations exist
wherever Stanford has overseas
establishments. The major rea
son for which we prefer Taiwan
to Hong Kong as a study center
for Mandarin Chinese is that Tai
wan is a Mandarin Chinese-speak
ing community, whereas the chief
languages of the British Crown
Colony of Hong Kong are English
and Cantonese.

WARSAW GHETTO
Editor, The Daily;
Mr, Alan Rosenthal repeats his
statement that the “Warsaw ghet
to would never have been possible
but for the attitude of the Poles
themselves.” He promises to
“prove his point” by describing
what he calls the picture of pre
war Poland. Acknowledging a
small minority of courageous
Polos w'ho helped the Jews during
the war, he then cites the perse
cutions of Jews in post-war Po
land for further support of his
thesis.
It is not the purpose of this
letter to deny the existence of
anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism cer
tainly did exist in Poland as it
did throughout Europe and 1 de
plore this and feel a sense of uni
ty with Mr. Rosenthal about his
resentment of anti-Semitism. I
also profoundly respect his feel
ings of indignation about the
murder of Polish citizens of Jew
ish faith.
Yet, I object to his letter on the
following counts:
Air. Rosenthal, 11) confuses
chronological data, (2) vastly
oversimplifies h i s deductions,
and. finally, (3) “proves” that he
is ignorant of the history of the
Second World War.
(1) MR, ROSENTHAL is using
the periods between 1918-1939 (in
dependent Poland) and 1945 on
(Poland under Communist re
gime i to provide proof for his
interpretation of what happened
in Warsaw between 1940 and
1943 when the city was in the
deadly grip of the German occu
pational forces. Not only chron
ology is confused here. So is Mr.
Rosenthal in lacking the insight
into human behavior, under
stress.
(2) As one who lived in War
saw throughout the German oc
cupation of that city, including
the time of the ghetto’s destruc
tion, I want to assure Mr. Rosen
thal that Polish citizens, other
than those of the Jewish faith,
were murdered daily on the
streets of Warsaw by the German
security police the numbers
sometimes ran literally into hun
dreds.
As one who lost several friends
in the ghetto and helplessly wit
nessed its destruction, I resent
inferences that the majority of
Polish citizens were approving,
condoning, or in collusion with
the Germans and/or their actions
against Poles of Jewish faith. In
asserting this Mr. Rosenthal re
veals pathetic ignorance, of the
local conditions.
(3) AIR. ROSENTHAL’S asser
tion that if it would not have

been for the Polish “attitude” the
ghetto would never have been
possible in German-occupied Po
land and then citing the behavior
of the Dutch populations and that
of the King of Denmark as a par
allel example, reveals a lack in
Air. Rosenthal’s general knowl
edge of the German policies to
ward occupied Europe during
World War II and particularly to
ward Slavs: Poles and Russians.
Germans during the occupation
of Holland maintained Dutch
laws, Dutch administrative per
sonnel and the Dutch court sys
tem. The same policy was applied
in Denmark where even the King
was kept in a position of authori
ty and strong enough to resist
German pressures, at least until
the Fall of 1943,
Although the infringements of
the German administration were
severe, all of these institutions
provided the Dutch and Danish
people some room for self-asser
tion. None of this was possible in
Poland. There was no semblance
of Polish government recognized
by the Germans. The naked ter
ror ruled with curfews, deporta
tions, executions, and clubbing
into submission. Under these con
ditions, the Polish “anti-Semites”
shared the fate of their Polish
brothers of Jewish faith who
w 7 ere “on the other side of the
wall.”
At any rate, on German author
ity the wholesale deportation
from Holland and Denmark of al
most the entire Jewish popula
tion ultimately took place—Dutch
and Danish attitudes notwith
standing.
As an alumnus I know that
Stanford is a good place to pur
sue the truth, which, I under
stand, Mr. Rosenthal is seeking.
I hope that Mr. Rosenthal will
take full advantage of this oppor
tunity.

(2) As one who lived in War

than those of the Jewish faith,

(3) AIR. ROSENTHAL’S asser

been for the Polish “attitude” the
ghetto would never have been
possible in German-occupied Po
land and then citing the behavior
of the Dutch populations and that
of the King of Denmark as a par
allel example, reveals a lack in
Air. Rosenthal’s general knowl
edge of the German policies to
ward occupied Europe during
World War II and particularly to
ward Slavs: Poles and Russians.
Germans during the occupation
of Holland maintained Dutch
laws, Dutch administrative per
sonnel and the Dutch court sys
tem. The same policy was applied
in Denmark where even the King
was kept in a position of authori
ty and strong enough to resist
German pressures, at least until
the Fall of 1943,
Although the infringements of
the German administration were
severe, all of these institutions
provided the Dutch and Danish
people some room for self-asser
tion. None of this was possible in
Poland. There was no semblance
of Polish government recognized
by the Germans. The naked ter
ror ruled with curfews, deporta
tions, executions, and clubbing
into submission. Under these con
ditions, the Polish “anti-Semites”
shared the fate of their Polish
brothers of Jewish faith who
w 7 ere “on the other side of the
wall.”
At any rate, on German author
ity the wholesale deportation
from Holland and Denmark of al
most the entire Jewish popula
tion ultimately took place—Dutch
and Danish attitudes notwith
standing.
As an alumnus I know that
Stanford is a good place to pur
sue the truth, which, I under

I hope that Mr. Rosenthal will
take full advantage of this oppor

Editor, The Daily:
Recently, there has been much
discussion of coeducational living
groups at Stanford, but it will be
at least three years before the
still- tentatively coeducatoinal
Robert Moore Hall is completed.
To enable the present student
body to take advantage of the
tremendous opportunities for per
sonal growth that are possible
only within a coeducational sys
tem. it is necessary to alter ex
isting living facilities.
Stern Hall is the most readily
alterable dormitory on campus,
and, in addition, it can he altered

to provide the optimum conditions
that a coeducational living sys
tem needs if it is to develop suc
cessfully.
The Stern House Presidents
Council, representing the whole
of Stern, has unanimously re
solved that at least part of Stern
Hall should be made coeducation
al, no later than autumn quarter
of 1962. The Faculty Residents
in Stern, Drs. Wilfred H. Stone,
Edwin J. Doyle, and Milton Van
Dyke, as well as John Balch, are
all in favor of this proposal.
In Roble, Branner, and Flor

Editor, The Daily:
Last November, I went to
UCLA with a student committee
connected with Stern Hall, to
gather information about the ad
vantages and problems of coed
housing. By staying in one of the
two coed dorms and by talking
with deans, dorm officers, and
residents, wo gathered much in
formation, from which I have
reached these general observa
tions;
1. Coed living is a natural an
swer to problems of student rela
tionships. Often, the only contact
we have with fellow students, es
pecially of the opposite sex, is in
casual classroom acquaintances
or in an artificial dating atmos
phere. The coed housing situa
tion lessens the superficiality of
seeing others only as potential
“conquests,” while fostering re
laxed, close friendships between
the sexes. Our investigations sug
gest that, rather than turning in
to a “marriage mill,” the coed
dorm becomes a common ground
for getting to know members of
the opposite sex as people,
2. Coed living is great. By stay
ing in one of the coed dorms, we
got a sample of what coed living
is like in practice. The students
were well-groomed, there was no
abusive language floating around,

conversations at meals and in the
lounges were much more stimu
lating, students seemed generally
more animated in their activities,
and honest, girls, putting on lip
stick for breakfast really isn’t
that terrible!
In connection with Stanford:
3. Stern Hall, with its court
yards, low buildings, and small
lounges, affords a pleasant set
ting for a coed living system.
4. The size of Stern’s houses is
conducive to successful coed hous
ing. In Stern, a single living
group comprises a convenient
number—4o men and 40 women
thereby minimizing problems of
government, control, and house
pride.
I believe that Stanford will ben
efit from a coed living system and
I hope all interested students will
vigorously support current ef
forts to integrate Stern Hall.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.
Editor, Tin* Daily:
The answer to Miss Strain’s
questions regarding possible po
litical influence on the proposed
Taiwan study center obviously is
yes. Political considerations exist
wherever Stanford has overseas
establishments. The major rea
son for which we prefer Taiwan
to Hong Kong as a study center
for Mandarin Chinese is that Tai
wan is a Mandarin Chinese-speak
ing community, whereas the chief
languages of the British Crown
Colony of Hong Kong are English
and Cantonese.

WARSAW GHETTO
Editor, The Daily;
Mr, Alan Rosenthal repeats his
statement that the “Warsaw ghet
to would never have been possible
but for the attitude of the Poles
themselves.” He promises to
“prove his point” by describing
what he calls the picture of pre
war Poland. Acknowledging a
small minority of courageous
Polos w'ho helped the Jews during
the war, he then cites the perse
cutions of Jews in post-war Po
land for further support of his
thesis.
It is not the purpose of this
letter to deny the existence of
anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism cer
tainly did exist in Poland as it
did throughout Europe and 1 de
plore this and feel a sense of uni
ty with Mr. Rosenthal about his
resentment of anti-Semitism. I
also profoundly respect his feel
ings of indignation about the
murder of Polish citizens of Jew
ish faith.
Yet, I object to his letter on the
following counts:
Air. Rosenthal, 11) confuses
chronological data, (2) vastly
oversimplifies h i s deductions,
and. finally, (3) “proves” that he
is ignorant of the history of the
Second World War.
(1) MR, ROSENTHAL is using
the periods between 1918-1939 (in
dependent Poland) and 1945 on
(Poland under Communist re
gime i to provide proof for his
interpretation of what happened
in Warsaw between 1940 and
1943 when the city was in the
deadly grip of the German occu
pational forces. Not only chron
ology is confused here. So is Mr.

Editor, Tin* Daily:
The answer to Miss Strain’s
questions regarding possible po
litical influence on the proposed
Taiwan study center obviously is
yes. Political considerations exist
wherever Stanford has overseas
establishments. The major rea
son for which we prefer Taiwan
to Hong Kong as a study center
for Mandarin Chinese is that Tai

languages of the British Crown
Colony of Hong Kong are English
and Cantonese.

WARSAW GHETTO
Editor, The Daily;
Mr, Alan Rosenthal repeats his
statement that the “Warsaw ghet
to would never have been possible
but for the attitude of the Poles
themselves.” He promises to
“prove his point” by describing
what he calls the picture of pre
war Poland. Acknowledging a
small minority of courageous
Polos w'ho helped the Jews during
the war, he then cites the perse
cutions of Jews in post-war Po
land for further support of his
thesis.
It is not the purpose of this
letter to deny the existence of
anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism cer
tainly did exist in Poland as it
did throughout Europe and 1 de
plore this and feel a sense of uni
ty with Mr. Rosenthal about his
resentment of anti-Semitism. I
also profoundly respect his feel
ings of indignation about the
murder of Polish citizens of Jew
ish faith.
Yet, I object to his letter on the
following counts:
Air. Rosenthal, 11) confuses
chronological data, (2) vastly
oversimplifies h i s deductions,
and. finally, (3) “proves” that he
is ignorant of the history of the
Second World War.
(1) MR, ROSENTHAL is using
the periods between 1918-1939 (in
dependent Poland) and 1945 on
(Poland under Communist re
gime i to provide proof for his
interpretation of what happened
in Warsaw between 1940 and
1943 when the city was in the
deadly grip of the German occu
pational forces. Not only chron
ology is confused here. So is Mr.
Rosenthal in lacking the insight
into human behavior, under
stress.
(2) As one who lived in War
saw throughout the German oc
cupation of that city, including
the time of the ghetto’s destruc
tion, I want to assure Mr. Rosen
thal that Polish citizens, other
than those of the Jewish faith,
were murdered daily on the
streets of Warsaw by the German
security police the numbers
sometimes ran literally into hun
dreds.
As one who lost several friends
in the ghetto and helplessly wit
nessed its destruction, I resent
inferences that the majority of
Polish citizens were approving,
condoning, or in collusion with
the Germans and/or their actions
against Poles of Jewish faith. In
asserting this Mr. Rosenthal re
veals pathetic ignorance, of the
local conditions.
(3) AIR. ROSENTHAL’S asser
tion that if it would not have

been for the Polish “attitude” the
ghetto would never have been
possible in German-occupied Po
land and then citing the behavior
of the Dutch populations and that
of the King of Denmark as a par
allel example, reveals a lack in
Air. Rosenthal’s general knowl
edge of the German policies to
ward occupied Europe during
World War II and particularly to
ward Slavs: Poles and Russians.
Germans during the occupation
of Holland maintained Dutch
laws, Dutch administrative per
sonnel and the Dutch court sys
tem. The same policy was applied
in Denmark where even the King
was kept in a position of authori
ty and strong enough to resist
German pressures, at least until
the Fall of 1943,
Although the infringements of
the German administration were
severe, all of these institutions
provided the Dutch and Danish
people some room for self-asser
tion. None of this was possible in
Poland. There was no semblance
of Polish government recognized
by the Germans. The naked ter
ror ruled with curfews, deporta
tions, executions, and clubbing
into submission. Under these con
ditions, the Polish “anti-Semites”
shared the fate of their Polish
brothers of Jewish faith who
w 7 ere “on the other side of the
wall.”
At any rate, on German author
ity the wholesale deportation
from Holland and Denmark of al
most the entire Jewish popula
tion ultimately took place—Dutch
and Danish attitudes notwith
standing.
As an alumnus I know that
Stanford is a good place to pur
sue the truth, which, I under
stand, Mr. Rosenthal is seeking.
I hope that Mr. Rosenthal will
take full advantage of this oppor
tunity.

Recently, there has been much
discussion of coeducational living
groups at Stanford, but it will be
at least three years before the
still- tentatively coeducatoinal
Robert Moore Hall is completed.
To enable the present student
body to take advantage of the
tremendous opportunities for per
sonal growth that are possible
only within a coeducational sys
tem. it is necessary to alter ex
isting living facilities.
Stern Hall is the most readily
alterable dormitory on campus,
and, in addition, it can he altered

to provide the optimum conditions
that a coeducational living sys
tem needs if it is to develop suc
cessfully.
The Stern House Presidents
Council, representing the whole
of Stern, has unanimously re
solved that at least part of Stern
Hall should be made coeducation
al, no later than autumn quarter
of 1962. The Faculty Residents
in Stern, Drs. Wilfred H. Stone,
Edwin J. Doyle, and Milton Van
Dyke, as well as John Balch, are
all in favor of this proposal.
In Roble, Branner, and Flor
ence Moore Halls, and in Lagu

to participate in a coeducational

All of the elements that would

ty and strong enough to resist
German pressures, at least until
the Fall of 1943,
Although the infringements of
the German administration were
severe, all of these institutions
provided the Dutch and Danish
people some room for self-asser
tion. None of this was possible in
Poland. There was no semblance
of Polish government recognized
by the Germans. The naked ter
ror ruled with curfews, deporta
tions, executions, and clubbing
into submission. Under these con
ditions, the Polish “anti-Semites”
shared the fate of their Polish
brothers of Jewish faith who
w 7 ere “on the other side of the
wall.”
At any rate, on German author
ity the wholesale deportation
from Holland and Denmark of al
most the entire Jewish popula
tion ultimately took place—Dutch
and Danish attitudes notwith
standing.
As an alumnus I know that
Stanford is a good place to pur
sue the truth, which, I under
stand, Mr. Rosenthal is seeking.
I hope that Mr. Rosenthal will
take full advantage of this oppor
tunity.

COED IN STERN?
Editor, The Daily:
Recently, there has been much
discussion of coeducational living
groups at Stanford, but it will be
at least three years before the
still- tentatively coeducatoinal
Robert Moore Hall is completed.
To enable the present student
body to take advantage of the
tremendous opportunities for per
sonal growth that are possible
only within a coeducational sys
tem. it is necessary to alter ex
isting living facilities.
Stern Hall is the most readily
alterable dormitory on campus,
and, in addition, it can he altered

to provide the optimum conditions
that a coeducational living sys
tem needs if it is to develop suc
cessfully.
The Stern House Presidents
Council, representing the whole
of Stern, has unanimously re
solved that at least part of Stern
Hall should be made coeducation
al, no later than autumn quarter
of 1962. The Faculty Residents
in Stern, Drs. Wilfred H. Stone,
Edwin J. Doyle, and Milton Van
Dyke, as well as John Balch, are
all in favor of this proposal.
In Roble, Branner, and Flor
ence Moore Halls, and in Lagu
nita Court, many interested wom
en are waiting for an opportunity
to participate in a coeducational
living group.
All of the elements that would
compose a successful coeduca
tional system are available for
use in. Stern. We are looking to
the Stanford administration to
help us institute coeducational
living in Stern Hall next year.

Y" IT’S GREAT
Editor, The Daily:
Last November, I went to
UCLA with a student committee
connected with Stern Hall, to
gather information about the ad
vantages and problems of coed
housing. By staying in one of the
two coed dorms and by talking
with deans, dorm officers, and
residents, wo gathered much in
formation, from which I have
reached these general observa
tions;
1. Coed living is a natural an
swer to problems of student rela
tionships. Often, the only contact
we have with fellow students, es
pecially of the opposite sex, is in
casual classroom acquaintances
or in an artificial dating atmos
phere. The coed housing situa
tion lessens the superficiality of
seeing others only as potential
“conquests,” while fostering re
laxed, close friendships between
the sexes. Our investigations sug
gest that, rather than turning in
to a “marriage mill,” the coed
dorm becomes a common ground
for getting to know members of
the opposite sex as people,
2. Coed living is great. By stay
ing in one of the coed dorms, we
got a sample of what coed living
is like in practice. The students
were well-groomed, there was no
abusive language floating around,

conversations at meals and in the
lounges were much more stimu
lating, students seemed generally
more animated in their activities,
and honest, girls, putting on lip
stick for breakfast really isn’t
that terrible!
In connection with Stanford:
3. Stern Hall, with its court
yards, low buildings, and small
lounges, affords a pleasant set
ting for a coed living system.
4. The size of Stern’s houses is
conducive to successful coed hous
ing. In Stern, a single living
group comprises a convenient
number—4o men and 40 women
thereby minimizing problems of
government, control, and house
pride.
I believe that Stanford will ben
efit from a coed living system and
I hope all interested students will
vigorously support current ef
forts to integrate Stern Hall.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.
Editor, Tin* Daily:
The answer to Miss Strain’s
questions regarding possible po
litical influence on the proposed
Taiwan study center obviously is
yes. Political considerations exist
wherever Stanford has overseas
establishments. The major rea
son for which we prefer Taiwan
to Hong Kong as a study center
for Mandarin Chinese is that Tai
wan is a Mandarin Chinese-speak
ing community, whereas the chief
languages of the British Crown
Colony of Hong Kong are English
and Cantonese.

WARSAW GHETTO
Editor, The Daily;
Mr, Alan Rosenthal repeats his
statement that the “Warsaw ghet
to would never have been possible
but for the attitude of the Poles
themselves.” He promises to
“prove his point” by describing
what he calls the picture of pre
war Poland. Acknowledging a
small minority of courageous
Polos w'ho helped the Jews during
the war, he then cites the perse
cutions of Jews in post-war Po
land for further support of his
thesis.
It is not the purpose of this
letter to deny the existence of
anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism cer
tainly did exist in Poland as it
did throughout Europe and 1 de
plore this and feel a sense of uni
ty with Mr. Rosenthal about his
resentment of anti-Semitism. I
also profoundly respect his feel
ings of indignation about the
murder of Polish citizens of Jew
ish faith.
Yet, I object to his letter on the
following counts:
Air. Rosenthal, 11) confuses
chronological data, (2) vastly
oversimplifies h i s deductions,
and. finally, (3) “proves” that he
is ignorant of the history of the
Second World War.
(1) MR, ROSENTHAL is using
the periods between 1918-1939 (in
dependent Poland) and 1945 on
(Poland under Communist re
gime i to provide proof for his
interpretation of what happened
in Warsaw between 1940 and
1943 when the city was in the
deadly grip of the German occu
pational forces. Not only chron
ology is confused here. So is Mr.
Rosenthal in lacking the insight
into human behavior, under
stress.
(2) As one who lived in War
saw throughout the German oc
cupation of that city, including
the time of the ghetto’s destruc
tion, I want to assure Mr. Rosen
thal that Polish citizens, other
than those of the Jewish faith,
were murdered daily on the
streets of Warsaw by the German
security police the numbers
sometimes ran literally into hun
dreds.
As one who lost several friends
in the ghetto and helplessly wit
nessed its destruction, I resent
inferences that the majority of
Polish citizens were approving,
condoning, or in collusion with
the Germans and/or their actions
against Poles of Jewish faith. In
asserting this Mr. Rosenthal re
veals pathetic ignorance, of the
local conditions.
(3) AIR. ROSENTHAL’S asser
tion that if it would not have

been for the Polish “attitude” the
ghetto would never have been
possible in German-occupied Po
land and then citing the behavior
of the Dutch populations and that
of the King of Denmark as a par
allel example, reveals a lack in
Air. Rosenthal’s general knowl
edge of the German policies to
ward occupied Europe during
World War II and particularly to
ward Slavs: Poles and Russians.
Germans during the occupation
of Holland maintained Dutch
laws, Dutch administrative per
sonnel and the Dutch court sys
tem. The same policy was applied
in Denmark where even the King
was kept in a position of authori
ty and strong enough to resist
German pressures, at least until
the Fall of 1943,
Although the infringements of
the German administration were
severe, all of these institutions
provided the Dutch and Danish
people some room for self-asser
tion. None of this was possible in
Poland. There was no semblance
of Polish government recognized
by the Germans. The naked ter

tions, executions, and clubbing

ditions, the Polish “anti-Semites”

At any rate, on German author
