## Dose and Windsor Join Top Scorers 
### 
With six games remaining 01
tainty that John Windsor and T<
all-time Stanford single-season ai
Windsor, the 6-8 senior forw;
tied with George Yardley as the
a three-year period. His 40-point
outburst last weekend gave him
a three-year varsity total of 820
points, equalling that made by
Yardley during the 1948. 1959,
1950 seasons.
Dose, the 0-8 sophomore center
from Glendale, has scored 330
points in 20 games and it appears
likely he will be the ninth man,
and only the third sophomore, to
score 400 or more points in one
season for the Indians. Ron Tom
sk- with 515 points in 1953 and
Hank Luisetti with 410 points in
1930 were the only others to score
400 or more in their sophomore
year.
Dose currently leads the Stan
ford squad in ten statistical cate
gories, including the rather dubi
ous honors of committing 00 per
sonal fouls and folding out of five
games.
More important, he has hit on
120 of 300 field goal attempts for
a team-leading shooting accuracy
of 41.2 per cent. Right behind
him is Hollis Moore, the fine de
fensive forward, who had made
52 of 129 attempts for 40.3 per
cent.
Guard Darrell Sutherland and
Windsor are shooting a shade un
der the 40 per cent mark at 38.5
and 37.9 per cent, respectively.
As a team, the Indians are
slightly more accurate than their
opponents, 37.3 per cent to 36.7
per cent.

Dose, averaging 16.5 points, and
Windsor, scoring 11.9 points per
game. The only other player aver
aging in double figures is Suther
land, with a mark of 10.1 points.
The best free-thrower on the
team is Phil Kelly. The reserve
forward has converted 31 of 37
attempts for an 83.8 percentage.
Both Dose and Sutherland have
been 77.2 per cent accurate from
the charity line. Tom has made
78 of 101 free throws attempted,
both team-leading statistics, while
Darrell has hit 44 of 57 attempts.
Stanford is shooting a rather
mediocre 67.7 per cent (314 of
464) from the free throw line.
In rebounding, Dose and Wind
‘sor are far in front of their team
mates, The two tallest Indians
have grabbed 208 and 193, respec
tively. Moore, the third member
of the front line, has 92 rebounds.
The team has rebounded 940
times or 51.6 per cent of all the
rebounds in Stanford’s games.
The Indians fine offensive re
bound total (451) has often al
lowed them two or three shots at
a time, and is one of the keys to
their success this year.
Don Clemetson leads the squad
in the important department of
assists. Don’s passing has directly
led to 31 baskets scored by team
mates.
Moore has 21 assists, mostly
on high lob passes to Dose. Doug
Clemetson and Sutherland have
set up 18 field goals each.
