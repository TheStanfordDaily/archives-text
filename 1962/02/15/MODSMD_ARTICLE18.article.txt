# Special Rules Will Regulate Frosh, Brave Baseball Games
## 
### 
Brave and Freshman baseball
games during February and
March will be played under a
special set of rules designed to
shorten the time required to play
a college baseball game, accord
ing to Stanford baseball coach,
Dutch Fehring.
The new rules are:
1 There shall be no warm-up
pitches between innings. If pitch
ers desire to throw a few before
going out to the mound each in
ning, they must do this on the
sideline after two men on his
team are out.
2. There shall be no tossing
the ball around the infield after
each out and infielders will not
take warm-up tosses between in
nings.
3 Both offensive and defensive
teams must run on and off thft
field when switching positions be
tween innings. Failure to do so on
the part of the offensive team
may result in a strike being called
on the first batter. Failure to run
out to position on the part of the
defensive team may result in a
hall being called on the first bat
ter. This, of course, is at the dis

cretion of the umpire in charge of
the game.

4—The team at bat may be al
lowed a courtesy runner for the
pitcher any time after he has
reached base safely without his
having to leave the game. The ex
ception is made in order to give
him a chance to take warm up
tosses on the sidelines if he so de
sires.

s—Courtesy runners shall he
allowed for the catcher after two
men are out in order that he may
have time to get his catching gear
adjusted without delaying the
game.
