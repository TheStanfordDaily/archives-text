# Russ Planes Buzz Berlin-Bound Briton
## 
### 
BERLIN (UPli—Soviet fighter
aircraft in seven separate inci
dents yesterday circled Western
Allied planes flying to Berlin. The
Western planes were defying a
Russian threat to reserve the vital
airlanes for Soviet use by jam
ming them with military aircraft.
Western officials took a serious
view of the Russian harassment.
Their apprehension was increased
by another Russian demand last
night that Western aircraft again
keep above 7,500 foot today in
one of the three 20-mile air cor
ridors to Berlin over East Ger
many. The new demand was re
jected by the West.
AMONG THE seven Western
aircraft “looked over” yesterday
by the Soviet fighters was a
Royal Air Force two-engine Pem
broke transport carrying British
Ambassador Si r Christopher
Steel to Berlin.
Asked if his plane was actually
“buzzed,” Steel, in a telephone
interview, said, “the Russian
planes did not come very close.”
Today will be the fifth Russian
attempt in eight days to restrict
the air traffic that saved Berlin
from starvation during the 1948-
49 blockade.
YESTERDAY for the first time,
on the Soviets’ fourth attempt,
Russian aircraft appeared in the
air space as Western Allied mili
tary and commercial aircraft flew
to Berlin despite the Russian
warning of “saturation” flights.
The Soviets at the Four-Power
air safety center told the Western
Allies that space in the Hannover-
Berlin air corridor up to 7,500 feet
would have to be reserved for
Russian military flights, an Allied
spokesman said.
ANOTHER Allied spokesman
denied he had said the British
ambassador’s plane was buzzed
by the Soviet fighter. He said re
ports of buzzing apparently were
an attempt to interpret his state
ment that the fighter “flew near.”
“My statement did not say nor
mean that the plane was buzzed,”
he said. “I do not know if the
plane was in fact buzzed. I have
istted a statement that was
agreed upon and I have no more
knowledge about the incident.”

The Soviets at the Four-Power
air safety center told the Western
Allies that space in the Hannover-
Berlin air corridor up to 7,500 feet
would have to be reserved for
Russian military flights, an Allied
spokesman said.
ANOTHER Allied spokesman
denied he had said the British
ambassador’s plane was buzzed
by the Soviet fighter. He said re
ports of buzzing apparently were
an attempt to interpret his state
ment that the fighter “flew near.”
“My statement did not say nor
mean that the plane was buzzed,”
he said. “I do not know if the
plane was in fact buzzed. I have
istted a statement that was
agreed upon and I have no more
knowledge about the incident.”
BERLIN (UPli—Soviet fighter
aircraft in seven separate inci
dents yesterday circled Western
Allied planes flying to Berlin. The
Western planes were defying a
Russian threat to reserve the vital
airlanes for Soviet use by jam
ming them with military aircraft.
Western officials took a serious
view of the Russian harassment.
Their apprehension was increased
by another Russian demand last
night that Western aircraft again
keep above 7,500 foot today in
one of the three 20-mile air cor
ridors to Berlin over East Ger
many. The new demand was re
jected by the West.
AMONG THE seven Western
aircraft “looked over” yesterday
by the Soviet fighters was a
Royal Air Force two-engine Pem
broke transport carrying British
Ambassador Si r Christopher
Steel to Berlin.
Asked if his plane was actually
“buzzed,” Steel, in a telephone
interview, said, “the Russian
planes did not come very close.”
Today will be the fifth Russian
attempt in eight days to restrict
the air traffic that saved Berlin
from starvation during the 1948-
49 blockade.
YESTERDAY for the first time,
on the Soviets’ fourth attempt,
Russian aircraft appeared in the
air space as Western Allied mili
tary and commercial aircraft flew
to Berlin despite the Russian
warning of “saturation” flights.
The Soviets at the Four-Power
air safety center told the Western
Allies that space in the Hannover-
Berlin air corridor up to 7,500 feet
would have to be reserved for
Russian military flights, an Allied
spokesman said.
