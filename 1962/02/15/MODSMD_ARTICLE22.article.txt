when the 130 pounder Dave Her
asmichuk edged Cal’s Allen Chen
6-4.
However Cal look a good lead
of 10-3 when Fred Sylvester pin
ned Card John Smith at 137.
LEE STEPHENSON returned
the compliment by pinning Bear

and the score was 8-10.
Phil Kendall put the Indians on
top 11-10 by a decision at 157 over
Frank Milton of UC. Kendall won
easily 7-0.
Cal went ahead again as Jon
Kay was edged 5-4 by Ken Men
zer in the 167-pound class.
Frank Redle gave Stanford the
14-13 lead with another 7-0 de
cision. Redle nailed Dick Rice of
Cal, but it was Rice's refusal to
be pinned that enabled Cal to win.
Had Redle pinned him, the final
score would have been a 16-16 lie.
STILL, IT WAS Redie’s fifth
straight win since recovering
from an injury.

.500 mark again tonight, when
they host San Jose State. The
match will start at 7:30 p.m. in
