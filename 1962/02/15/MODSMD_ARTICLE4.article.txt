# Good, Australian Will Discuss Bible, Viewpoints on Belief
## 
### 
“Can We Believe the Bible?” is
the subject of a discussion to
night at 9:30 in Cubberley Audi
torium by Professor of Religion
Edwin Good and Rev. D. W. B.
Robinson, Vice-principal of Moore
Theaological College in Sydney,

Australia.
The speakers will discuss what
belief in the Bible means and why
people take different views. Rev.
Robinson plans to present the
more conservative viewpoint. Pro
fessor Good stated that his an
swer may be “a hearty amen.”
However, it is more likely the two
will differ on specific issues,
though not in principle.
Professor Good said that he
tends to be a Bultmannian, fol
lower of the German scholar who
is famous for his demy Biologizing
of the New Testament.
Rev. Robinson, who has written
many commentaries on the scrip
tures, was the principal speaker
at the Northern California Inter
Varsity Christian Fellowship Con
ference. His subject was “Biblical
Authority and Interpretation.”
The Council on Religious Af
fairs and Stanford Christian Fel
lowship are sponsoring the pro
gram tonight.
