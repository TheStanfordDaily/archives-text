Miss Makeba is best known for
her singing of African folk songs,
especially those from her native

songs are characterized by a

to master.
Though her audience may not

language in which the songs are
rendered, he r interpretations
clearly convey t lie moaning and
the feeling of the songs to the lis
teners. Her repertoire also in
cludes many English songs and
folk songs from other countries.

singing folk songs while the boys
were attending Gonzaga Univer
sity in Spokane, Washington, and
