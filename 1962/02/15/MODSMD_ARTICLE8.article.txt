## 
### 
HAVANA (UPl)—Communist leader Carlos Rafael Rodriguez
yesterday replaced Premier Fidel Castro as president of the all
powerful Cuban Agrarian Reform Institute.
The significance of the change was not immcdaitely apparent,
hut it created a sensation. It was announced without fanfare by

The cabinet in a brief statement
published in the official press.
Much of Castro’s power has
stemmed from the all-embracing
authority vested in him as head
of the institute.
Institute employes appeared
surprised, admitting that Rodri
guez was “replacing Fidel.’’ Cas
tro drafted the legal machinery
for the institute in 1959 while still
campaigning as a mountain guer
rilla. He has been its president
since.
The institute controls agricul
ture, the pillar of the Cuban econ
omy. It is an autonomous govern
ment body with unlimited powers.
Its decisions cannot be chal
lenged. They are specifically ex
empted from legal appeal by con
stitutional proviso.
Political observers speculated
whether the change represented
an open government takeover by
increasingly powerful Commu
nists or, perhaps, official recogni
tion of Rodriguez’ work in trans
forming the Cuban economy from
a capitalist to a socialist base.
Rodriguez is one of the top five
men in the Communist hierarchy
in Cuba.
