“Pity Moll Magee.”
Why? She didn’t know
about Super/Charge,
Roos/Atkins answer
to the Easter bunny
(it’s Easter before
it’s Christmas).
Anyway, the reason
Moll didn’t trot
down to R/A with
her reg. card was
she was too busy
reading this
fellow called Yeast,
or Yeats or something
like that. “Pity Moll.”
