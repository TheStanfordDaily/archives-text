The entire academic world is agog over the success of (he
Associated Colleges Plan—ACP, for short. I mean, you go to
any campus in the country these days and you will see students
and faculty dancing on the green, blowing penny whistles,
grabbing each other by the elbows and yelling, “About that
ACP, Charley—like wane!”
And who can blame them? The ACP is a plan not only simply
brilliant, but also brilliantly simple. All it, is, is a loose regional
federation of small colleges, lad's say, for example, that in a
given region we have a group of small colleges, each with its
own academic specialty. Small College No. 1, let’s say, has a fine
language department; Small College No. 2, let’s say, has a fine
science department; No. 3 has a fine music department: etc., etc.
Well sir, under the ACP these various colleges federate. A
student in any one of the colleges can take courses in the spe
cialty of any of the other colleges and—here’s the beauty part!
—he will receive credit for the course at his home college. Thus
he enjoys all the advantages of a big university without losing
the comfy coziness of a small college!
Well sir, you can see what a good idea the ACP is. 1 respect
fully submit, however, that just because a thing is good is no
reason not to try to make it better. Take, for instance, Marlboro
Cigarettes. Marlboros were good from the very beginning, and
people found out quickly and sales zoomed. But did the makers
of Marlboro say, “Okay, we’ve got it made. Let’s relax”?
Well sir, if that’s what you think, you don’t know the makers!
They did not relax. They took their good Marlboros and kept
improving them. They improved the filter, improved the blend,
improved the pack. They researched and developed tirelessly,
until today Marlboro is just about the most admirable cigarette
you can put a match to. There are, in fact, some people who
find Marlboros so admirable they can’t bear to put a match to
them. They just sit with a single Marlboro in hand and admire
it for ten, twelve years on end. The makers of Marlboro are of
course deeply touched by this—except for E. Rennie Sigafoos,
the sales manager.
But T digress. The ACP, I say, is good but it can be better.
Why should the plan be confined to small colleges? Why should
it be confined to a limited region? Why not include all colleges
and universities, big and small, wherever they are?
Let's start such a federation, let's call it the “Bigger Asso
ciated Colleges To Encourage Richer Intellectual Activity ’
BACTERIA, for short!

What a bright new world BACTERIA opens up. Take, for
example, a typical college student- Hunrath Sigafoos (son,
incidentally, of the Marlboro sales manager). Hunrath, a bright
lad, is currently majoring in hurley at the University of Ken
tucky. Under the BACTERIA plan, Hunrath could stay at
Kentucky, where he has made many friends, but at the same
time broaden his vistas by taking a course in constitutional law
at I harvard, a course in physics at Caltech, a course in frostbite
at Minnesota and a course in poi at Hawaii!
I admit there are still a few bugs in BACTERIA. How, for
instance, could Hunrath attend a ft o'clock class at Harvard,
a 10 o’clock class at Hawaii, an 11 o’clock class at Minnesota,
and still keep his lunch date at Kentucky? It would be idle to
deny that this is a tricky problem, but 1 have no doubt American
ingenuity will carry the day. Always remember how they
laughed at Edison and Fulton—and particularly at Walter
Clavicle who invented the collarbone.

Cigarettes. Marlboros were good from the very beginning, and
people found out quickly and sales zoomed. But did the makers
of Marlboro say, “Okay, we’ve got it made. Let’s relax”?
Well sir, if that’s what you think, you don’t know the makers!
They did not relax. They took their good Marlboros and kept
improving them. They improved the filter, improved the blend,
improved the pack. They researched and developed tirelessly,
until today Marlboro is just about the most admirable cigarette
you can put a match to. There are, in fact, some people who
find Marlboros so admirable they can’t bear to put a match to
them. They just sit with a single Marlboro in hand and admire
it for ten, twelve years on end. The makers of Marlboro are of
course deeply touched by this—except for E. Rennie Sigafoos,
the sales manager.
But T digress. The ACP, I say, is good but it can be better.
Why should the plan be confined to small colleges? Why should
it be confined to a limited region? Why not include all colleges
and universities, big and small, wherever they are?

What a bright new world BACTERIA opens up. Take, for
example, a typical college student- Hunrath Sigafoos (son,
incidentally, of the Marlboro sales manager). Hunrath, a bright
lad, is currently majoring in hurley at the University of Ken
tucky. Under the BACTERIA plan, Hunrath could stay at
Kentucky, where he has made many friends, but at the same
time broaden his vistas by taking a course in constitutional law
at I harvard, a course in physics at Caltech, a course in frostbite
at Minnesota and a course in poi at Hawaii!
I admit there are still a few bugs in BACTERIA. How, for
instance, could Hunrath attend a ft o'clock class at Harvard,
a 10 o’clock class at Hawaii, an 11 o’clock class at Minnesota,
and still keep his lunch date at Kentucky? It would be idle to
deny that this is a tricky problem, but 1 have no doubt American
ingenuity will carry the day. Always remember how they
laughed at Edison and Fulton—and particularly at Walter
Clavicle who invented the collarbone.

The entire academic world is agog over the success of (he
Associated Colleges Plan—ACP, for short. I mean, you go to
any campus in the country these days and you will see students
and faculty dancing on the green, blowing penny whistles,
grabbing each other by the elbows and yelling, “About that
ACP, Charley—like wane!”
And who can blame them? The ACP is a plan not only simply
brilliant, but also brilliantly simple. All it, is, is a loose regional
federation of small colleges, lad's say, for example, that in a
given region we have a group of small colleges, each with its
own academic specialty. Small College No. 1, let’s say, has a fine
language department; Small College No. 2, let’s say, has a fine
science department; No. 3 has a fine music department: etc., etc.
Well sir, under the ACP these various colleges federate. A
student in any one of the colleges can take courses in the spe
cialty of any of the other colleges and—here’s the beauty part!
—he will receive credit for the course at his home college. Thus
he enjoys all the advantages of a big university without losing
the comfy coziness of a small college!
Well sir, you can see what a good idea the ACP is. 1 respect

incidentally, of the Marlboro sales manager). Hunrath, a bright
lad, is currently majoring in hurley at the University of Ken
tucky. Under the BACTERIA plan, Hunrath could stay at
Kentucky, where he has made many friends, but at the same
time broaden his vistas by taking a course in constitutional law
at I harvard, a course in physics at Caltech, a course in frostbite
at Minnesota and a course in poi at Hawaii!
I admit there are still a few bugs in BACTERIA. How, for
instance, could Hunrath attend a ft o'clock class at Harvard,
a 10 o’clock class at Hawaii, an 11 o’clock class at Minnesota,
and still keep his lunch date at Kentucky? It would be idle to
deny that this is a tricky problem, but 1 have no doubt American
ingenuity will carry the day. Always remember how they
laughed at Edison and Fulton—and particularly at Walter
Clavicle who invented the collarbone.

UNITED WE STAND
The entire academic world is agog over the success of (he
Associated Colleges Plan—ACP, for short. I mean, you go to
any campus in the country these days and you will see students
and faculty dancing on the green, blowing penny whistles,
grabbing each other by the elbows and yelling, “About that
ACP, Charley—like wane!”
And who can blame them? The ACP is a plan not only simply
brilliant, but also brilliantly simple. All it, is, is a loose regional
federation of small colleges, lad's say, for example, that in a
given region we have a group of small colleges, each with its
own academic specialty. Small College No. 1, let’s say, has a fine
language department; Small College No. 2, let’s say, has a fine
science department; No. 3 has a fine music department: etc., etc.
Well sir, under the ACP these various colleges federate. A
student in any one of the colleges can take courses in the spe
cialty of any of the other colleges and—here’s the beauty part!
—he will receive credit for the course at his home college. Thus
he enjoys all the advantages of a big university without losing
the comfy coziness of a small college!
Well sir, you can see what a good idea the ACP is. 1 respect
fully submit, however, that just because a thing is good is no
reason not to try to make it better. Take, for instance, Marlboro
Cigarettes. Marlboros were good from the very beginning, and
people found out quickly and sales zoomed. But did the makers
of Marlboro say, “Okay, we’ve got it made. Let’s relax”?
Well sir, if that’s what you think, you don’t know the makers!
They did not relax. They took their good Marlboros and kept
improving them. They improved the filter, improved the blend,
improved the pack. They researched and developed tirelessly,
until today Marlboro is just about the most admirable cigarette
you can put a match to. There are, in fact, some people who
find Marlboros so admirable they can’t bear to put a match to
them. They just sit with a single Marlboro in hand and admire
it for ten, twelve years on end. The makers of Marlboro are of
course deeply touched by this—except for E. Rennie Sigafoos,
the sales manager.
But T digress. The ACP, I say, is good but it can be better.
Why should the plan be confined to small colleges? Why should
it be confined to a limited region? Why not include all colleges
and universities, big and small, wherever they are?
Let's start such a federation, let's call it the “Bigger Asso
ciated Colleges To Encourage Richer Intellectual Activity ’
BACTERIA, for short!
