“The broader your knowledge,
the greater your chance
fit CMPPPCCI” Edwin J. Ducayet, President
Ul OUUUCOO. Bell Helicopter Company
“As I look back, graduating from college in the depth of
the depression was a blessing in disguise. It was difficult
to get a job, and even more difficult to hold it. It proved
to me early in life that to succeed in business requires
constant struggle.
“I found that the truly successful individual never stops
learning, that a formal college education is the foundation
on which we continue to build the knowledge and experi
ence required to get ahead.
“Even in today’s age of specialization, a man eventually
reaches a point where breadth of knowledge is necessary.
The engineer must understand accounting and marketing.
The marketing man must know his product. The financial
man must be sympathetic to engineering development
and sales programs. Management must have a working
knowledge of all phases of the complex and highly com
petitive business world.
“Therefore, even though specializing, a student should
make his college curriculum as broad as possible, and
diversify his outside activities. Authoritative surveys have
shown that only a small percentage of individuals end up
in the field in which they specialized in college.
“Widen your world. Broaden your interests right now.
Since graduation from college I’ve discovered that those
who are really succeeding today are the ones who do more
and keep on learning from what they do. The broader
your college interests are now the steadier your ladder
of success tomorrow!”
