# Pace Donation For Chem Unit
## 
### 
A gift of $500,000 was pledged
to Stanford’s PACE program yes
terday by John Stauffer, senior
vice president of the Stauffer
Chemical Co., Los Angeles.
The $500,000 is earmarked for
construction of a building for
teaching and research in chemis
try, including the studies of plas
tics. The building, to be named
the “John Stauffer Laboratory
for Physical Chemistry,” is the
second building in the quadrangle
which owes its basic financing to
Stauffer.
Tentatively the building will be
finished in 1963. The two men di
recting research and teaching will
be Dr. Paul J. Flory, former ex
ecutive director of research at the
Mellon Institute, and Dr. Henry
Taube, former head of the Uni
versity of Chicago Chemistry De
partment.
Flory has worked in research
on commercial development of
nylon and other synthetic materi
als. At Stanford, he has studied
the biological makeup of tissue
and cells.
