# ON NAMING NAMES
## Walter Lippmann 
### 
In the hearings before the Sten
nis Committee, which is investi
gating the censorship of speeches
of military men, Secretary Mc-
Namara is defending a fundamen
tal principle of good government.
The issue has been posed by Sen.
Thurmond, who is demanding
that he be given the name of (he
individual who has censored any
particular speech. Secretary Mc-
Namara, acting, of course, under
instructions from the President,
has refused to do this.
IT IS most important that we
know exactly what the issue is
between the Senator and the Sec
retary. In the first place, the Sec
retary has given the Congress the
names of all the censors in the
Pentagon, some fourteen of them.
These men have been examined
individually by the Congressional
Committee in executive session.
There is absolutely no question
of security and loyalty about any
one of them, and Sen. Thurmond
has himself acknowledged this
fact. There is, therefore, no
charge, no suspicion, that any
particular passage was censored
out of a particular speech because
the censor had a wrong motive or
did anything worse than make
the mistake of being over zealous.
So, as matters stand, Congress
knows exactly what was censored
out of every speech; it knows and
has examined the whole panel of
officers who did the censoring.
Moreover, Secretary McNamara
has offered to give the committee
a written explanation, over his
own signature, of any particular
act of censorship. But Sen. Thur
mond is not satisfied with all this.
He insists that he must know
whether it was John Smith or
Tom Brown who cut this or that
sentence out of Gen. Somebody’s
speech.
WHY IS it a matter of the
highest importance that the Pres
ident and his Administration
should stand firm on Secretary
McNamara’s refusal to name
names and to pinpoint individu
als? Because to surrender on that
issue would be to destroy the dis
cipline and confuse the loyalties
of government employees of the
military personnel, of the foreign
service, of the civil service of all
the large mass of the bureau
cracy who do not make policy but
are (here to carry it out.
If it became the accepted prece
dent that an Army officer as
signed to the job of censorship
could be called to account by a
Congressional committee for car
rying out the orders of a superior
officer, the Army officer would
have two masters and would not
know who was his boss. This was
the quintessence of the evil of
McCarthyism, and we know from
that appalling experience how it
destroys the spirit and morale
and efficiency of civil servants.
When this condition prevails,
men work with one eye on their
official boss and the other eye
on the inquisitors from Congress.
Temptation is great to feed out
information, rumors, and innuen
do behind the official boss’s back,
either to curry the favor of the in
quisitor or to placate his wrath.
Subordinates cannot count on be
ing protected against public deg
radation and the boss cannot
count on his staff to serve him
loyally. This would be a vicious
condition of affairs, and should
not be tolerated in a self-respect

ing government.
CONGRESS has every right to :
know what is being done by the j
Administration and why it is be-1
ing done. It has a right to know |
this from the policy-making offi-1
cers who must accept the whole
responsibility, whether it brings j
credit or blame, for what their j
subordinates do. Considering the j
damage that yielding to Sen. 1
Thurmond would do, what com- j
pensating good would it do if Con-1
gress were able to put the individ- j
ual censor on the witness stand
and in front of the klieg lights in
order to cross-examine him about
why he thought this phrase or
that in a speech was subject to
censorship?
There is nothing to be learned
from that kind of persecution
which could not be learned far
better by cross-examining Secre
tary McNamara, his deputies and
assistants. Thei’e is so little that
could conceivably he learned
from the subordinate individual
censors that would bo of any pub
lic value that one must conclude
that it is not knowledge that Sen.
Thurmond is seeking, it is the
power to intimidate the Adminis- j
tration.
For if the line taken by Secre
tary McNamara is not held reso
lutely, the way will be open for a
great invasion by investigating
committees of the whole Execu
tive branch of the government.
Under our system of a balance of
powers it is necessary for public j
opinion to resist the invasion and j
usurpation of one branch of gov- j
eminent by another.
THERE ARE times, particular
ly in war, when the Executive
overrides the Congress. There are j
other times usually in post-war j
periods when the reaction |
against the war time Executive '
powers brings with it an aggres
sion by the Congress against the
Executive. These attempts to in- ;
vade and usurp are a recurrent
phenomenon in our political his- !
tory. They spring from the sep
aration of powers, and the integ
rity of our peculiar constitutional \
system depends upon finding an i
efficient balance between the sep- |
arated powers.
In this particular controversy
before the Stennis Committee. |
Sen. Thurmond is attempting to i
lead an invasion, amounting to a
usurpation, against the Executive. !
The issue is clearly and cleanly !
drawn, and it is hard to believe j
that the Stennis Committee will
fail to see its fundamental im- j
portance.
