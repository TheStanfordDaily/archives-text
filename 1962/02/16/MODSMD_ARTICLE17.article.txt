SHOUT AIKMOKV
Kditor, The Daily:
While The Daily has every
right to editorialize against the
I resumption of nuclear tests, I
[ think that somebody should ob
| ject to your dishonest implication
that Sen. Humphrey is/against
the resumption of tests by our
government.
If you would check back into
Son. Humphrey’s speech here at
j Stanford, you will find that ho
spoke of the need to resume nu
j clear testing. Sen. Humphrey said
j that all the great amount of in
i formation available to him had
convinced him that the Russians
had made so much progress in
j their test that it was “with re
gret” that he thought the U.S.
| might have to resume its testing.
Aren’t you asking too much of
, i our nation in wanting us to re
| frain from testing? The last time
| we refrained, you will remember,
j the Russians were secretly pre
-11 paring for tests while all the lime
supposedly negotiating a test ban
I agreement. But, you do have a
' short memory where the Rus
sians are concerned, don’t you? I
• j am afraid that the Russians have
• proved that it is with very good
• reason that our government in
i sists on a foolproof inspection
’ system.

CONGRATULATIONS?
Kditor, The Daily:
I would like to make a few re
j marks with respect to the report
ing of Tuesday's Cal-Stanford
; I wrestling match.
Your article placed the blame
| for the Stanford team’s loss on
i j one man, Frank Redle. It was
'; said, in effect, (hat because Redle
j only decisioned his man, who was
j the Cal captain and their best
wrestler, instead of pinning him.
Stanford lost the match.
I must congratulate your astute
reporting, for it is obvious that
i the forfeit in the 123-pound divi
: | sion, the loss to Cal by a pin in
! the 137-pound division, and the
losses by decision in 167-pound
i and heavyweight classes, all of

which add up to 16 points for j
Cal, had nothing to do with the |
team’s loss.
It’s also obvious that Redle, |
and all athletes in every sport, i

should be reprimanded for not
winning by the maximum score,
but should be congratulated for
losing.
Denis P. White
