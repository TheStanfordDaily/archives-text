GOOD NEWS
Editor, The Daily:
I am very sorry about Miss
Maureen Strain’s misunderstand
ing about the Taiwan Study Cen
ter. I would like to say something
about Taiwan where I came from
last year.
I am glad to see a campus will
soon be in Taipei, for this is the
best place to learn the Chinese
language. There are many good
teachers and facilities for those
who want to learn Manda-

rin Chinese, and you can prac
tice it with everyone in Formosa,
but in Hong Kong there is no op
portunity to speak Mandarin Chi
nese, except with some movie
stars. I think this is the reason

I hat led the Stanford administra
tion to prefer Formosa to Hong
Kong. Besides, there are many
ancient Chinese treasures in the
museums which are very useful
in the study of Chinese culture or
civilization.

Miss Strain’s most critical point
was that Taiwan has a bad politi
cal atmosphere. In my opinion,
this is not true. I lived there for
13 years, and I know it very well.
First, most of our people love
President Chiang Kai-shek very
much. They need his leadership,
especially in war time. Therefore

ho was elected to a third term as
president. Franklin D. Roosevelt
was elected U.S. President four
times. Why? Because it was war
time.

Secondly, after the Communist
occupation of the Chinese main
land, the Government of the Re
public of China moved its seat
temporarily to Taiwan. We are
endeavoring to promote our peo
ple’s living standard, military
strength, educational facilities,
etc. So we have the second high
est standard of living in the Far
East, the most powerful military
in free Asia, and the highest at
tendance rate of children of
school age (96.56) in Asia.
Thirdly, you should not feel
that what happened in the case of
the Yale study center in Madrid
could occur in Taiwan, for we like
any liberal professors. For ex
ample, Dr. Hu Shih, a famous
Chinese philosopher and liberal
scholar, is now living in Taiwan
and is the president of Academia
Sinica. Wo respect and admire
him.
Lastly, the Chinese like Ameri
can friends. We know the long
historical Sino-American friend
ship. We have cooperated to de
feat imperialist aggression many
times. Now, we stand firm to
fight Communist China. Taiwan
is not only the hope of thousands
of Chinese people, but also the
hope of the Free World. We need
the support and cooperation of
Free World. Even in the cultural
exchange, we hope for more op
portunity. It is good to hear of a
Stanford campus in Taipei, I wish
Miss Strain would agree.

HUNKY DORY
Editor, The Daily:
Most of Stanford’s administra
tion seem to favor coeducational
dormitories. Well, hunky dory. I
won't believe it until they prove
it. I have had too much contact
with our administration to trust
verbal statements.
I am tired of Stanford’s bureau
cratic incompetence and negli

gence. Let me cite an example.
When the first four houses of
Stern were built, the walls were
colored by mixing paint in the
plaster, with dissatisfying results
even 13 years ago. For 10 years
the University would neither
paint these rooms nor let the stu
dents paint them.
In 1959 the University did agree
to paint the rooms at a cost of
$25 to the occupants. But until
the University got around to
painting all the rooms this quar
ter, only three out of 30 rooms in
our house showed any signs of
paint.
If the University balks at giv
ing us coed dorms now, we may
not have them until the turn of
the century. An institution which
puts off a routine paint job for 13
years will surely delay coed
dorms for 50.
Am I being unreasonable?
When was your room last paint
ed?
The University seems to have
begun its delaying tactics. It is
suggested that we wait for the
completion of Robert Moore Hall
to initiate coed living under the
best possible conditions.
Other schools that really want
ed coed living did not wait. I
know. Other members of a Stern
committee on coed living and I
studied reports on these schools
and in some cases went to the
schools and talked to their stu
dents and administrators.
They were well satisfied with
their systems of coed housing,
even though the dorms were not
originally built for coed housing.
Deans and administrators of
UCLA even pointed out that Stern
was more suitable for coed living
than their own new coed halls.
Let us make Stern coed now, and
then let the University build its
concept of the ideal coed dormi
tory.

-f WOMEN SAY
Editor, The Daily:
In reply to the article of Wed.,
Feb. 14 in The Daily concerning
the possibility of coeducational
housing in Stern Hall for the next
year, the following recommenda
tion was presented to the seven
houses of Florence Moore Hall in
an attempt to determine the sup
port of the women for this pro
posal:

“We, the undersigned, recom
mend an experiment in integrated
housing for Stern Hall to begin
next fall quarter. We would rec
ommend that it begin as a joint
effort between two houses, one
men's house and one women’s
house, which would share a com
mon dining room and lounge.

I Out of 350_ women in Moore,
j 190 signed their approval to this
j statement. The recommendation
j lists have been placed in the
| Dean’s office so that in the future
j they may be used as evidence of j
j the women’s support for this pro- j
1 gram.

CAMPUS ALERT
Editor, The Daily:
[ I have been a member of the |
Model U.S. Senate since its incep-1
tion. Since the MUSS was found-1
ed, members have been chosen j
on three occasions on the basis |
of interest and merit. As a result. I
the conservative position predom- j
inated. Three votes have been I
taken thus far in the MUSS.
The first resolution, calling for
cessation of atomic testing and
of arms buildup and for “peace”
negotiations, was defeated. The
second resolution, which advocat
ed the adoption of a national
right to work law, passed. The
third resolution called for admis
sion of Red China to the U.N.,
and it was defeated. The Daily re
fused to print any of these re
sults. This was expected.
Unexpected, however, was the
decision by the officers of the
MUSS to pack the Senate with
liberal members. This will, in all
probability, result in more Daily
coverage, and also in resolutions
more in line with liberal opinions.
The campus should realize
j what has happened when it reads
the excellent coverage of the lib
eral opinions of the MUSS in the
future Daily issues.

nothing to do with it.)
