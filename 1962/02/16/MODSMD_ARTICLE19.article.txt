# 'DANGEROUS IRRATIONALITY'
## 'Doublethink' —A Problem of the Frustrated 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
Today, class, we shall dwell
briefly on “doublethink,” a most
interesting and troublesome af
fliction which is particularly prev
alent in those who find the world
a terribly frustrating place in
which to live.
“Doublethink,” says George Or
well in his book "1984.” “means
the power of holding two contra
dictory beliefs in one’s mind, and
accepting both of them.” Clearly
no rational being could be guilty
of “doublethinking," yet millions
of people who CONSIDER them
selves rational do.
“Doublethink” i s extremely
dangerous in relation to the bat
tle between East and West. Amer
icans are very quick to notice
Russian "doublethink.” Russians
talk about their classless society
when clearly Russia is built along
fairly rigid class distinctions.
Few Westerners have noticed the
different standards of living be
tween the factory manager and
the peasant without concluding
Russia most certainly doesn’t
have a “classless society.”
ANOTHER example is the Rus
sians’ use of “people’s democra
cy” which they apply to undemo
cratic regimes as East Germany,
Hungary, Rumania, etc. Perhaps
the most startling example of
Russian “doublethink” is the con
tention that “the Russian state

will wither away” when obviously
it is growing stronger every day.

But “doublethinkers” have a
problem. They are quick to no
tice the other fellow’s “double
thinking,” but never notice or re
fuse to recognize their own.
Wo Westerners are also quite
guilty. Many of us have little
trouble calling brutal dictators
like Chiang Kai-shek, and Franco,
members in good standing of the
“free world.” Their only “qualifi
cation” is their strong hatred of
Communism quite understand
able when one realizes that these
gentlemen would undoubtedly
lose their autocratic heads if the
“Red butchers” wore to seize pow
er in their countries.
EVEN WORSE, such dictators
are permitted to influence Ameri
can foreign policy!
Many other examples of “Amer
ican doublethink” can bo given
but two will suffice. We always
talk about our undying respect
and admiration for small coun
tries’ independence, yet we do not
hesitate to support or attempt
the overthrow of governments in
Guatemala and Cuba.
Finally, when the Russians
mercilessly crushed the Hungari
ans in 1956 we were horrified. On
the other hand, French atrocities
in Algeria and Portuguese bru
tality in Angola are tolerated by
all too many because France and
Portugal are “on our side.”

THERE ARE several reasons
why “doublethink” is dangerous.
First, it is highly irrational and
indicates an inability to cope with
complex situations. Realistic
thinking is essential if we are to
settle the East-West dispute. Ir
rationality can only increase the
possibility of unnecessary con
flict.
Second, “doublethinkers” have
forgotten the principles for which
this country supposedly stands.
We are a “rationalizing” society
rather than a principled one. How
else can we explain our willing
ness to defend certain murderers
and to outlaw others?
Third, our irrational, hypocriti
cal “doublethinking” confuses the
neutral nations we are trying to
keep neutral. Angolans and Al
gerians. for instance, must have
a hard time understanding our
double standard.
If we are to improve the
chances of avoiding war, if we
are to remain true to traditonal
principles, and if we are to keep
the neutral countries neutral,
then we must stop “doublethink
ing” and all other forms of irra
tional behavior'.

this country supposedly stands.
We are a “rationalizing” society
rather than a principled one. How
else can we explain our willing
ness to defend certain murderers
and to outlaw others?
Third, our irrational, hypocriti
cal “doublethinking” confuses the
neutral nations we are trying to
keep neutral. Angolans and Al
gerians. for instance, must have
a hard time understanding our
double standard.
If we are to improve the
chances of avoiding war, if we
are to remain true to traditonal
principles, and if we are to keep
the neutral countries neutral,
then we must stop “doublethink
ing” and all other forms of irra
tional behavior'.
Today, class, we shall dwell
briefly on “doublethink,” a most
interesting and troublesome af
fliction which is particularly prev
alent in those who find the world
a terribly frustrating place in
which to live.
“Doublethink,” says George Or
well in his book "1984.” “means
the power of holding two contra
dictory beliefs in one’s mind, and
accepting both of them.” Clearly
no rational being could be guilty
of “doublethinking," yet millions
of people who CONSIDER them
selves rational do.
“Doublethink” i s extremely
dangerous in relation to the bat
tle between East and West. Amer
icans are very quick to notice
Russian "doublethink.” Russians
talk about their classless society
when clearly Russia is built along
fairly rigid class distinctions.
Few Westerners have noticed the
different standards of living be
tween the factory manager and
the peasant without concluding
Russia most certainly doesn’t
have a “classless society.”
ANOTHER example is the Rus
sians’ use of “people’s democra
cy” which they apply to undemo
cratic regimes as East Germany,
Hungary, Rumania, etc. Perhaps
the most startling example of
Russian “doublethink” is the con
tention that “the Russian state

will wither away” when obviously
it is growing stronger every day.

But “doublethinkers” have a
problem. They are quick to no
tice the other fellow’s “double
thinking,” but never notice or re
fuse to recognize their own.
Wo Westerners are also quite
guilty. Many of us have little
trouble calling brutal dictators
like Chiang Kai-shek, and Franco,
members in good standing of the
“free world.” Their only “qualifi
cation” is their strong hatred of
Communism quite understand
able when one realizes that these
gentlemen would undoubtedly
lose their autocratic heads if the
“Red butchers” wore to seize pow
er in their countries.
EVEN WORSE, such dictators
are permitted to influence Ameri
can foreign policy!
Many other examples of “Amer
ican doublethink” can bo given
but two will suffice. We always
talk about our undying respect
and admiration for small coun
tries’ independence, yet we do not
hesitate to support or attempt
the overthrow of governments in
Guatemala and Cuba.
Finally, when the Russians
mercilessly crushed the Hungari
ans in 1956 we were horrified. On
the other hand, French atrocities
in Algeria and Portuguese bru
tality in Angola are tolerated by
all too many because France and
Portugal are “on our side.”

THERE ARE several reasons
why “doublethink” is dangerous.
First, it is highly irrational and
indicates an inability to cope with
complex situations. Realistic
thinking is essential if we are to
settle the East-West dispute. Ir
rationality can only increase the
possibility of unnecessary con
flict.
Second, “doublethinkers” have
