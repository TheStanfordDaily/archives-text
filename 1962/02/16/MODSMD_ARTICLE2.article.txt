# Subversive Groups Hit By Bunzel

### ILENE H. STRELITZ Stall Editor 
Stanford political scientist John
Bunzel last night cited the dan
gers of subversion to the demo
cratic process posed by rightist
extreme groups, in a Breakers’
speakers series address.
Illustrating the danger with a
statement of Robert Welch’s
“ . . . cannot count on politics,
politicians, or even political ac
tion,” Bunzel stated, ‘‘the danger
here is that those people have no
commitment to the democratic
process.
“THEY VOICE a nihilist plea
for the repeal of industrialism
and international politics,” he
noted after citing a list of policies
the rightists stand against. “The
extremists are not addressing
themselves to the urgent prob
lems we face—racial, urban de
velopment, etc.”
Bunzel viewed the extremist
groups in terms of a personality
type the “island of safety men
tality” who seek safety in the cre
ation of a “rigid two-color world
with no tattletale grey.”
BUNZEL CONCENTRATED
his analysis upon the right wing
extremists after noting the “dis
mal failure of the Communist
Party in the United States.”
The political scholar character
ized the extremist as possessing a
"certitude of truth” and feeling
that a person disagreeing is ‘‘not
only misguided but dangerous.”
“When the individual consci
ence is elevated to the point of
principle, majority rule is no
longer effective.
"There is no allegiance on the
part of these people to the demo
cratic process. They know so well
what they want to believe, they
are willing to go around it.”
THE AMERICAN political proc
ess was cited as one by which
group differences, sympathetical
ly understood, are discussed with
a view of solution. This involves
a "toleration of disagreement,”
Bunzel, who has recently drawn
attention to the rightist phenom
ena byway of his participation
in the San Francisco conference
on the radical right, concluded,
“I am pleading essentially for the
worth of the democratic process.
“In a democracy there are go
ing to be individual differences
and individual ideas . . . must be
tolerated.”
