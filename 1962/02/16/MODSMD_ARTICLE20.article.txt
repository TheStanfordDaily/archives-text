# Cagers Meet Bears Tonight, Tomorrow
## 
### KEN DERY 
Well, this is supposed to ho the
Stanford basketball team’s week
of low pressure with two games
against Cal. But, tonight’s contest
a I Harmon Gym in Berkeley at
8:00 p.m. and tomorrow’s game
at the Pavilion, also at 8:00, may
prove surprising.
The University of California Is
having one of its infrequent off
years in the roundhall game and
Stanford’s success has been re
freshing. But, whenever the arch
rivals meet anything can happen.
FOB INSTANCE last year the
Cards left for their half-time
break at Harmon gym holding a
fantastic 21-point lead, but the
Bears charged out of the dressing
room and their full-court press
found the Indians stumbling. Be
lieve it or not Ihe Bears of coach
Rene Herrerias actually won go
ing away.
This is the youngest, greenest
Cal team in at least a decade and
the record shows it. The Bears
are sporting a sad 6-13 overall
record and have yet to beat any
one in the league in six tries.
The one proven performer is
junior guard Dick Smilh. A very
quick jump-shooter, 6-0, 170-pound
Smith started the last eight games
for Cal last year and ignited the
Bears into winning five of their
last six conference contests.
HOWEVER AFTER Smith the
squad is unproven. The first three
centers are all sophomores. The
guards have very little varsity
experience.
At the forwards lettermen Ed
Donahue (6-5, 190) has returned
and Don Lauer is currently the
other starter.
Denny Lewis a 5-11 sophomore
will probably open up at (he other
guard slot with Smith. He is
noted for his sharp passing and
playmaking ability and averaged
10 points per game for the frosh
last year.
CHRIS CARPENTER is a mo
bile 6-8 center who has been a
pleasant surprise so far this sea
son, but he is still very inexper
ienced. He also lettered in swim
ming last year.
But if Cal is to give Stanford
a time of it Donahue and Smith
must leaf! the charge. When the
two teams met earlier in the year
Stanford won 74-42.
Donahue is 6-5 and a tough re
bounder and his outside shooting
is improved.
Smith is hitting about 10 points
per game to lead the Bear scoring
in this dismal season.
STANFORD on the other is en

joying its best season in many a
year. The record is 15-5 against
all competition and 11-5 if only
college games are counted.
Sophomore Tom Dose and sen
ior forward John Windsor have
been the real big guns so far.
Dose’s scoring (16.5 points per
game) has been amazing for just
a sophomore. The tall guy with
the baby face is atop of most of
the Cards stats.
HE TOPS the stat list in field
goal attempts, field goals made,
field goal percentage, free throw
atcmpts, free throws made, offen
sive rebounds, total rebounds, and
total points.
His inexperience has resulted in
66 personal fouls charged against
him and five disqualifications, but
his assets outweigh his liabilities
many times.
“Duke” Windsor the rugged re

bounding forward has carried
most of the load when Dose has
been off and his 11.9 average is
deceptive, for he had tough going
in some of the early games.
HE HAS taken the most defen
sive rebounds and has cleared the
boards 193 times for coach Howie
Dallmar and company. His peak
performance was against USC
when he dunked 27 markers and
crushed the Trojans with his in
spired board play.
But, don’t forget Darrell Suth
erland, the deadeye guard, Hollis
Moore, the steady sophomore for
ward and Don Clemetson the
play making other guard.
Sutherland has been consistent
ly hitting in double figures and
is averaging 10.1.
CLEMETSON and his brother
Doug, currently sitting out with
a broken bone in his foot have
kept the team running smoothly
with their great floor games and
they can hit the bucket if given
any room.

was supposed to be guarding Windsor. The picture was taken at

A MAGNIFICENT FAKE and Card forward John Windsor is all by
himself for an easy layin. Stanford player looking on is Doug
Clemetson (23). The Bear in the background is Ed Donahue, who
was supposed to be guarding Windsor. The picture was taken at
the Stanford-Cal game earlier this year which Stanford won 74-42.
Well, this is supposed to ho the
Stanford basketball team’s week
of low pressure with two games
against Cal. But, tonight’s contest
a I Harmon Gym in Berkeley at
8:00 p.m. and tomorrow’s game
at the Pavilion, also at 8:00, may
prove surprising.
The University of California Is
having one of its infrequent off
years in the roundhall game and
Stanford’s success has been re
freshing. But, whenever the arch
rivals meet anything can happen.
FOB INSTANCE last year the
Cards left for their half-time
break at Harmon gym holding a
fantastic 21-point lead, but the
Bears charged out of the dressing
room and their full-court press
found the Indians stumbling. Be
lieve it or not Ihe Bears of coach
Rene Herrerias actually won go
ing away.
This is the youngest, greenest
Cal team in at least a decade and
the record shows it. The Bears
are sporting a sad 6-13 overall
record and have yet to beat any
one in the league in six tries.
The one proven performer is
junior guard Dick Smilh. A very
quick jump-shooter, 6-0, 170-pound
Smith started the last eight games
for Cal last year and ignited the
Bears into winning five of their
last six conference contests.
HOWEVER AFTER Smith the
squad is unproven. The first three
centers are all sophomores. The
guards have very little varsity
experience.
At the forwards lettermen Ed
Donahue (6-5, 190) has returned
and Don Lauer is currently the
other starter.
Denny Lewis a 5-11 sophomore
will probably open up at (he other
guard slot with Smith. He is
noted for his sharp passing and
playmaking ability and averaged
10 points per game for the frosh
last year.
CHRIS CARPENTER is a mo
bile 6-8 center who has been a
pleasant surprise so far this sea
son, but he is still very inexper
ienced. He also lettered in swim
ming last year.
But if Cal is to give Stanford
a time of it Donahue and Smith
must leaf! the charge. When the
two teams met earlier in the year
Stanford won 74-42.
Donahue is 6-5 and a tough re
bounder and his outside shooting
is improved.
Smith is hitting about 10 points
per game to lead the Bear scoring
in this dismal season.
STANFORD on the other is en

joying its best season in many a
year. The record is 15-5 against
all competition and 11-5 if only
college games are counted.
Sophomore Tom Dose and sen
ior forward John Windsor have
been the real big guns so far.
Dose’s scoring (16.5 points per
game) has been amazing for just
a sophomore. The tall guy with
the baby face is atop of most of
the Cards stats.
HE TOPS the stat list in field
goal attempts, field goals made,
field goal percentage, free throw
atcmpts, free throws made, offen
sive rebounds, total rebounds, and
total points.
His inexperience has resulted in
66 personal fouls charged against
him and five disqualifications, but
his assets outweigh his liabilities
many times.
“Duke” Windsor the rugged re

bounding forward has carried
most of the load when Dose has
been off and his 11.9 average is
deceptive, for he had tough going
in some of the early games.
HE HAS taken the most defen
sive rebounds and has cleared the
boards 193 times for coach Howie
Dallmar and company. His peak
performance was against USC
when he dunked 27 markers and
crushed the Trojans with his in
spired board play.
But, don’t forget Darrell Suth
erland, the deadeye guard, Hollis
Moore, the steady sophomore for
ward and Don Clemetson the
play making other guard.
Sutherland has been consistent
ly hitting in double figures and
is averaging 10.1.

most of the load when Dose has
been off and his 11.9 average is
deceptive, for he had tough going
in some of the early games.
HE HAS taken the most defen
sive rebounds and has cleared the
boards 193 times for coach Howie
Dallmar and company. His peak
performance was against USC
when he dunked 27 markers and
crushed the Trojans with his in
spired board play.
But, don’t forget Darrell Suth
erland, the deadeye guard, Hollis
Moore, the steady sophomore for
ward and Don Clemetson the
play making other guard.
Sutherland has been consistent
ly hitting in double figures and
is averaging 10.1.
CLEMETSON and his brother
Doug, currently sitting out with
a broken bone in his foot have
kept the team running smoothly
with their great floor games and
they can hit the bucket if given
any room.

A MAGNIFICENT FAKE and Card forward John Windsor is all by
himself for an easy layin. Stanford player looking on is Doug
Clemetson (23). The Bear in the background is Ed Donahue, who
was supposed to be guarding Windsor. The picture was taken at
the Stanford-Cal game earlier this year which Stanford won 74-42.
Well, this is supposed to ho the
Stanford basketball team’s week
of low pressure with two games
against Cal. But, tonight’s contest
a I Harmon Gym in Berkeley at
8:00 p.m. and tomorrow’s game
at the Pavilion, also at 8:00, may
prove surprising.
The University of California Is
having one of its infrequent off
years in the roundhall game and
Stanford’s success has been re
freshing. But, whenever the arch
rivals meet anything can happen.
FOB INSTANCE last year the
Cards left for their half-time
break at Harmon gym holding a
fantastic 21-point lead, but the
Bears charged out of the dressing
room and their full-court press
found the Indians stumbling. Be
lieve it or not Ihe Bears of coach
Rene Herrerias actually won go
ing away.
This is the youngest, greenest
Cal team in at least a decade and
the record shows it. The Bears
are sporting a sad 6-13 overall
record and have yet to beat any
one in the league in six tries.
The one proven performer is
junior guard Dick Smilh. A very
quick jump-shooter, 6-0, 170-pound
Smith started the last eight games
for Cal last year and ignited the
Bears into winning five of their
last six conference contests.
HOWEVER AFTER Smith the
squad is unproven. The first three
centers are all sophomores. The
guards have very little varsity
experience.
At the forwards lettermen Ed
Donahue (6-5, 190) has returned
and Don Lauer is currently the
other starter.
Denny Lewis a 5-11 sophomore
will probably open up at (he other
guard slot with Smith. He is
noted for his sharp passing and
playmaking ability and averaged
10 points per game for the frosh
last year.
CHRIS CARPENTER is a mo
bile 6-8 center who has been a
pleasant surprise so far this sea
son, but he is still very inexper
ienced. He also lettered in swim
ming last year.
But if Cal is to give Stanford
a time of it Donahue and Smith
must leaf! the charge. When the
two teams met earlier in the year
Stanford won 74-42.
Donahue is 6-5 and a tough re
bounder and his outside shooting
is improved.
Smith is hitting about 10 points
per game to lead the Bear scoring
in this dismal season.
STANFORD on the other is en

joying its best season in many a
year. The record is 15-5 against
all competition and 11-5 if only
college games are counted.
Sophomore Tom Dose and sen
ior forward John Windsor have
been the real big guns so far.
Dose’s scoring (16.5 points per
game) has been amazing for just
a sophomore. The tall guy with
the baby face is atop of most of
the Cards stats.
HE TOPS the stat list in field
goal attempts, field goals made,
field goal percentage, free throw
atcmpts, free throws made, offen
sive rebounds, total rebounds, and
total points.
His inexperience has resulted in
66 personal fouls charged against
him and five disqualifications, but
his assets outweigh his liabilities
many times.
