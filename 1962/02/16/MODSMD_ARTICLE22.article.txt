# STANFORD AT TOP STRENGTH
## Freshmen Oppose Baby Bears Twice 
### BEN TIPTON 
If past performances are any indication, then Stanford’s frosh
basketball participants will have their hands full this weekend.
They meet the Cal Frosh in back to back game? tonight at Cal

and tomorrow in the Pavilion. Roth contests begin at 6 pan.
In the two teams’ last encounter, the Baby Bears tagged the

Papooses with one of their twot
losses of the season, 58-17 in the
Pavilion. The Indians were cold,
and couldn’t move against Cal’s
solid defense and slow style of
play.
Stanford will he at peak
strength for tills series, with the
return of “Deacon” Jack Gilbert
to the lineup. Although sidelined
for nearly a month, Gilbert re
mained near the top in individual
scoring, an indication of (he ad
vantage he had over his team
mates. He was still feeling the
effects of his illness against San
Jose last Saturday, but should he
in peak condition this week end.

The Cards have height in John
Murray and Erie Loewing, both
6-8. and Gilbert and Frank Olrich,
both 6-6. Olrich is a very consist
ent performer who scores with
almost monotonous consistency.
He, Gilbert, and Murray are the
big rebounders for the frosh.
Key playmakers for the Indians
are Dick Ragsdale, Rod Young,
and Mike Preisler. Ragsdale’s be
hind-the-back passes electrified
an enthusiastic crowd at San Jose
last week.

High scorers for the Cal frosh
in their win over Stanford were
Rich Henderson and Mike Tan

nenhaum, a vicious center-for
ward duo who tallied 22 and 21
points in the Bahy Bear win.
