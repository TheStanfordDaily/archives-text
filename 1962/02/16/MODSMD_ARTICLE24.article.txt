# Indian Ruggers Meet 'O' Club
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford’s varsity rugby team
takes to the road this weekend
for the first time in a month.
Tomorrow finds coach Pete Kme
tovic’s stalwarts traveling to far
away San Franciso to encounter
the Stan Francisco Olympic Club
for the second time at 3 p.m.
In their previous clash, the
Cards ruggers emerged victorious
by an economy sized 17-9 margin
over the visiting San Franciscans.
That win was the fourth straight
Stanford win over the Winged
“O” in three years and was a part
of the Indians’ present 11 game
win streak dating to last year’s
6-5 loss to (ho Cal Bears at Berke
ley.
THE TRIBE’S season mark to
date shows four wins and no los
ses in addition to two wins in the
preseason Stanford Rugby Carni
val.
Stanford holds wins over Cali
fornia, 13-8, the Olympic Club,
the Peninsula Ramblers. 10-3, and
UCLA 14-3. A game with the
University of the Pacific was can
celled.
The Olympic Club usually has
one of the better rugby squads in
the Bay Area, and this season is
no exception, despite the earlier
lopsided loss to the Cards.
It usually happens that (ho
“O" Clubbers cannot play at full
strength because of the difficulty
of getting their team together all
at the same time.
AMONti the San Franciscans’
outstanding personnel are Lou
Baldacci, a former all-America
fullback from the University of
Michigan, Archie Chagonjian and
Hemic Stoltzoff, who plays at the
first .. spot.
Although the Olympic Club per
sonnel is mainly made up of form
er Bay Area collegians, if also
sports some imported talent. John
Hennessy, a prop from Ireland

and Englishmen, lan Rnxton are
good examples. Kuxton does most
of the Olympic Club’s kicking in
addition to playing a good break
away position.

Since losing to the Tribe rugby
men, the Winged “0”-men have
played to a 3-3 tie with the power
ful Universities Club of Berkeley.
It is said the game had to be
called early because of excessive
ly spirited play.
ANOTHER match scheduled
with the UCLA team had to be
cancelled because of bad weather
and difficulties in finding a field
to play on.
For Stanford everyone seems
to be healthy with the sole excep
tion of Jon Brandin, who is still
out with mononucleosis, so the
Indians should be in top shape
medically for tomorrow’s encount
er.
However, Kmetovic has com
plained about the small amount
of practice his team has put in
this week. Light workouts
Wednesday and yesterday were
all that could bo worked in be
tween the periodic downpours.
Kmetovic has named a starting
lineup much the same as that
which started against UCLA last
week. The only change is the
return of Chuck Cobb, who took
leave to participate in the track
meet at Los Angeles.
JOHN THOMAS will open at
hook, backed up by Troy Barbee
and Randy Vahan at the prop
positions. Dick Leeuwenberg and
Al Hildebrand are the two second
row men, and John Butler is play
ing the lock spot. Steve Pursell
and Tim Hansel round out the

Tribe forwards at the breakaway
positions.

In the backfield, Bob Price is
starting at serum half with 'Pom
McManus and Hal Steuber at (he
first and second . . slots respec
tively. Stan Lindskog is to play
center a. and Clark Weaver and
Cobb will open at the wings. Rod
Sears, at fullback, closes out the
Card starting lineup.
There will be a Junior varsity
match at 1:30, featuring the Tribe
JV’s and Olympic Club “A” squad
preceding the varsity contest.


STANFORD LIGHTHEAVYWEIGHT
Ed Rothman will be favored to
win his boxing match tomorrow
night against Cal Poly.
