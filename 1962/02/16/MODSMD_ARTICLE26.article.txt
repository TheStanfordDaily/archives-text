# Windsor Leads Cards in AAWU
## 
### 
John Windsor is the Stanford
pace-setter in AAWU statistics
for the Indians’ first six Big Five
games.
Windsor is the fourth man in
the league in scoring. With an 18-
point average, he has fourth place
safely sewed up, with a prospect
of going higher, should one of the
top three slip.
FIRST IS STILL John Green of
UCLA, who has hit at a 26.8 clip.
His 32 points against Stanford
didn't hurt his average any. Next
comes Washington’s Bill Hanson.
In a scheduling freak. Washing
ton has only one conference game
left, so Hansen’s present 21.3 av
erage won’t change much.
USC’s John Rudometkin has
also a 21.4. Fifth is teammate
Chris Appel with 14.6,
Stanford’s Tom Dose is seventh
with 12.5, right behind Walt Haz
zard of UCLA. Then come two
more Uclans, Gary Cunningham
and Pete Blackman, followed by-
Card Darrell Sutherland, 11 .0.
CUNNINGHAM leads the free
throw shooters with .900. Stan
ford’s top is Dose, .778 for fifth
place. Sutherland is seventh at
.762.
Blackman’s .600 field goal
shooting is good enough to lead
in field goal percentage. Stanford
doesn’t have a man in the top
ten,
Fred Slaughter, a late-blooming
soph from UCLA, leads the re
bounders. He has picked off .126
of all rebounds in his teams Big
Five games. Hansen, Rudometkin,
and Ed Corell of Washington
trail. Windsor is fifth at .111.
Dose is seventh at .083.
