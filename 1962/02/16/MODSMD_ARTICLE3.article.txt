# Peace Rally On Libe Lawn
## 
### 
Stanford students will convene
this morning at 9 a.m. on the
lawn of Main Libe to give their
support to the “Turn Toward
Peace” demonstration held in
Washington D.C. today. The dem
onstrators are protesting the mil
itary nature of U.S. policy to
ward the Soviet Union.
The group states its reason for
the rally is that “we, as individu
als, have become concerned with
the throat of impending nuclear
war.
“We are appalled by the grow
ing militarism of both the United
States and the Soviet Union. We
feel that now, more than ever,
solutions short of war must be
sought.”
Accompanying the demonstra
tion is a display along the sides
of the Library’s main inside stair
way showing the evils of nuclear
bomb tests and advocating steps
to be taken to end them. Other
literature and information will be
in front of the library from 9 to
4. Folk singing and student
speeches are scheduled from 12
to 1:15 p.m.
