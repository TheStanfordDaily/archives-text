# Rains Swell Lake Lag—Searsville Full
## 
### 
Drenched and disgusted? Tired
of being soaked? Forget it—it
was all worth it
Lake Lag’s made it one-third of
the way full!
Wednesday’s rainfall of 1.11
inches brought the season’s total
to 10.29 inches, almost four inches
more than last year’s total rain
fall of 0.69 inches, and put Lake
Lag over the one-third mark. The
rainy season extends into May.
Lake Lag, which holds 118 mil
lion gallons of water, now con
tains 43 million gallons.
Searsville Lake, near Woodside,
the largest lake on campus, which
holds 263 million gallons, has
reached Ihe point of overflowing.
The overflow from Searsville is
now being diverted into San Fran
cisquito Creek. This diversionary
system can also help fill Lake
Lag if necessary.
Felt Lake, whore Ihe biology
experiment station is located, is
now 37 per cent full. The lake
holds 126 million gallons.
If there is enough consistent
rainfall for the rest of the season,
the Stanford water system will
be back in shape and able to com
pletely supply ils own nods.

STANFORD'S BOATHOUSE is beginning to look like it could be used as a boathouse once again as
recent heavy storms have dropped enough water in Lake Lagunita to fill it to one third its capacity.
Break out the canoes, men.
