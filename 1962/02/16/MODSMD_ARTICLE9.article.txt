# US Communist Hall Spouts Party Line In Mem Aud Talk
## 
### JERRY RANKIN 
Curtailment of tree speech and the right of political associa
tion of one group eventually will spread to all sections of the
political scene, U.S. Communist Party boss Gus Hall warned
yesterday.

Hall addressed a crowd of 1,500 at Memorial Auditorium, part

of which jammed the stage after'
his speech to continue question
ing him. Before the talk an anti
communist statement by FBI Di
rector J. Edgar Hoover was pass
ed out in front of Mem Aud.
Otherwise the audience tendered
the nation’s top Red no more than

the usual amount of noise drawn
by most political speakers here.
Hall dealt with civil liberties
and Communist dogma in his 90-
minute appearance.
DEALING with current Party
dogma, Hall said the U.S. Com
munist Party is not affiliated
with any international organiza
tion. He confidently predicted the
arrival of socialism in this nation,
but noted “Your socialism will be
stamped ‘Made in the U.S.A.’ and
not anywhere else.’’
In reply to a question whether
there is a chance the United
States will go fascist, Hall said
“the danger is there, but I don’t
think so.”
HE CLAIMED THAT “freedom
of speech has been restrained on
only one end of the political spec
trum”—the left. The right wing
“has had no difficulty” gaining
publicity in the press, he added.
The right wing has charged the
press with favoring the left wing.
“Once you start checking free
dom of expression on one end”

of the spectrum, ‘‘it will creep”
to the other end sooner or later,
he declared.
Hall explained his refusal to
register as a Communist and
thus as an agent of a foreign
power, according to law—by say
ing “it would be tantamount to
pleading guilty” to various
charges without benefit of a trial.
HE CHARGED “it is absolute
ly impossible to register under
the McCarran Act” because that
would be admitting to crimes
such as espionage with no evi
dence being brought against him
and no trial on such charges.
Hall pointed out that under the
law requiring Communists to
register, which levies heavy pen
alties against those who don’t, he
already could be fined about $2
million and be given a jail term
of 600 to 700 years.
HE TOLD how no one who ad
mits he is a Communist can be
employed in industry, apply for
Federal housing, or obtain a pass
port. “You can’t get a job, but
you can’t get out” of the country,
either, he observed.
“If after all this, the Commu
nist movement still stands, what
gives it its staying power?”
The answer Hall declared is
that Communists firmly believe
in their ideology and its ultimate
triumph over capitalism.
HE BELIEVES Socialism and
then Communism will eventually
win out in the U.S. because Capi
talism can’t deal with the prob
lems facing it, such as automa
tion. “Capitalism has difficulty
using now technology,” the for
mer union leader claimed, while
Communism can deal with that
technology because it "presents
the key to a solution” of man’s
problems.
Before the speech, Jim Rogers.
Political Union vice president,
stated that neither the Universi
ty nor Poli Union had agreed in
any way to pay for Hall’s ap
pearance at Stanford. Reports
had circulated earlier yesterday
that Hall said in Oregon his ex
penses would be taken care of by
the University.
THE GOVERNOR of Oregon.
Rogers said, had called President
Sterling to check on this. The Uni
versity flatly denied offering to
pay Hall. And Hall, when asked
by Rogers if the reports were
true, answered only that he re
ceives money from speaking.

KZSU, 8«0, will broadcast
Hall’s speech today at 3 p.m.

minute appearance.
DEALING with current Party
dogma, Hall said the U.S. Com
munist Party is not affiliated
with any international organiza
tion. He confidently predicted the
arrival of socialism in this nation,
but noted “Your socialism will be
stamped ‘Made in the U.S.A.’ and
not anywhere else.’’
In reply to a question whether
there is a chance the United
States will go fascist, Hall said
“the danger is there, but I don’t
think so.”
HE CLAIMED THAT “freedom
of speech has been restrained on
only one end of the political spec
trum”—the left. The right wing
“has had no difficulty” gaining
publicity in the press, he added.
The right wing has charged the
press with favoring the left wing.
“Once you start checking free
dom of expression on one end”

of the spectrum, ‘‘it will creep”
to the other end sooner or later,
he declared.
Hall explained his refusal to
register as a Communist and
thus as an agent of a foreign
power, according to law—by say
ing “it would be tantamount to
pleading guilty” to various
charges without benefit of a trial.
HE CHARGED “it is absolute
ly impossible to register under
the McCarran Act” because that
would be admitting to crimes
such as espionage with no evi
dence being brought against him
and no trial on such charges.
Hall pointed out that under the
law requiring Communists to
register, which levies heavy pen
alties against those who don’t, he
already could be fined about $2
million and be given a jail term
of 600 to 700 years.
HE TOLD how no one who ad
mits he is a Communist can be
employed in industry, apply for
Federal housing, or obtain a pass
port. “You can’t get a job, but
you can’t get out” of the country,
either, he observed.
“If after all this, the Commu
nist movement still stands, what
gives it its staying power?”
The answer Hall declared is
that Communists firmly believe
in their ideology and its ultimate
triumph over capitalism.
HE BELIEVES Socialism and
then Communism will eventually
win out in the U.S. because Capi
talism can’t deal with the prob
lems facing it, such as automa
tion. “Capitalism has difficulty
using now technology,” the for
mer union leader claimed, while
Communism can deal with that
technology because it "presents
the key to a solution” of man’s
problems.
Before the speech, Jim Rogers.
Political Union vice president,
stated that neither the Universi
ty nor Poli Union had agreed in
any way to pay for Hall’s ap
pearance at Stanford. Reports
had circulated earlier yesterday
that Hall said in Oregon his ex
penses would be taken care of by
the University.
THE GOVERNOR of Oregon.
Rogers said, had called President
Sterling to check on this. The Uni
versity flatly denied offering to
pay Hall. And Hall, when asked
by Rogers if the reports were
true, answered only that he re
ceives money from speaking.

KZSU, 8«0, will broadcast
Hall’s speech today at 3 p.m.

press with favoring the left wing.
“Once you start checking free
dom of expression on one end”

of the spectrum, ‘‘it will creep”
to the other end sooner or later,
he declared.
Hall explained his refusal to
register as a Communist and
thus as an agent of a foreign
power, according to law—by say
ing “it would be tantamount to
pleading guilty” to various
charges without benefit of a trial.
HE CHARGED “it is absolute
ly impossible to register under
the McCarran Act” because that
would be admitting to crimes
such as espionage with no evi
dence being brought against him
and no trial on such charges.
Hall pointed out that under the
law requiring Communists to
register, which levies heavy pen
alties against those who don’t, he
already could be fined about $2
million and be given a jail term
of 600 to 700 years.
HE TOLD how no one who ad
mits he is a Communist can be
employed in industry, apply for
Federal housing, or obtain a pass
port. “You can’t get a job, but
you can’t get out” of the country,
either, he observed.
“If after all this, the Commu
nist movement still stands, what
gives it its staying power?”
The answer Hall declared is
that Communists firmly believe
in their ideology and its ultimate
triumph over capitalism.
HE BELIEVES Socialism and
then Communism will eventually
win out in the U.S. because Capi
talism can’t deal with the prob
lems facing it, such as automa
tion. “Capitalism has difficulty
using now technology,” the for
mer union leader claimed, while
Communism can deal with that
technology because it "presents
the key to a solution” of man’s
problems.
Before the speech, Jim Rogers.
Political Union vice president,
stated that neither the Universi
ty nor Poli Union had agreed in
any way to pay for Hall’s ap
pearance at Stanford. Reports
had circulated earlier yesterday
that Hall said in Oregon his ex
penses would be taken care of by
the University.
THE GOVERNOR of Oregon.
Rogers said, had called President
Sterling to check on this. The Uni
versity flatly denied offering to
pay Hall. And Hall, when asked
by Rogers if the reports were
true, answered only that he re
ceives money from speaking.

KZSU, 8«0, will broadcast
Hall’s speech today at 3 p.m.
