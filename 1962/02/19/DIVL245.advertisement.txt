;®[3 © a Becoming a specialist
Experienced girl watchers, for whom routine watching
has lost some of its excitement, often become specialists.
(This is definitely not recommended for beginners. How
ever, it may be practiced as a change-of-pace by more
advanced students.) They may spend an entire field trip
concentrating on one part of a girl. This tends to step up
activity, since it does not require that the whole girl be
beautiful. For example, if you decide to specialize in
knees, you watch only beautiful knees. (The doorman
above appears to be an ankle specialist.) Whatever your
watching specialty, make sure your smoking specialty is
Pall Mali’s natural mildness-it’s so good to your taste.
