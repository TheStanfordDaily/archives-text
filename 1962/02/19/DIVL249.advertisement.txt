Why Fred MacMarray
wanted no part of TV
"I turneddown somanyTVshows,"
says Fred MacM array, ‘‘that I lost
count." In fact, he nearly passed up
"My Three Sons"—now a hit on
ABC Television. In this week’s
Saturday Evening Post, Fred tells
how he was dragged into the show.
And why his writers don't want
pretty girls on the program.
