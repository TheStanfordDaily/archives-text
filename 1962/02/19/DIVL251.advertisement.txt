KENNEDY
WILL HIS
TRADE PROGRAM
HURT U.S. BUSINESS?
An Oregon lumber company re
cently shut down one of its mills.
It just couldn’t compete with cheap
imports. Yet Kennedy wants even
lower tariffs. In this week’s Satur
day Evening Post, you'll read how
Kennedy defends his trade pro
gram. How he plans to deal with
the resulting job losses. And what
he’ll do if he can’t push his pro
gram through Congress.
