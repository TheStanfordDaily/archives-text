# Stanford Defeats California Twice
## 
### KEN DERY 
The Stanford Indians, battling
hard to stay in the Big Five bas
ketball race, kept their chances
alive over the weekend with two
victories over arch-rival Califor
nia.

Saturday night in the Pavilion
the Tribe outlasted the Bears 59-
54. while Friday’s score at Har
mon Gym in Berkeley was 64-51.

A SPLIT IN a pair of games be
tween USC and league-leading
UCLA in the southland enabled
the Cards of coach Howie Dali
mar to cling to their slim hope of
catching the Bruins in the AAWU
race.

UCLA has a 7-1 record while
Stanford is 5-3. USC, the pre-sea
son favorite for West Coast lau
rels is third with five wins and
four losses.

Tom Dose’s consistent scoring
led both the Stanford wins as the
6-8 sophomore center from Glen
dale hit 21 and 17 points in the
two outings.
SATURDAY’S GAME in he Pa
vilion, witnessed by a capacity
crowd and a television audience,
was a story of Stanford jumping
on top of outmanned Cal early
and then fighting off the scrappy
Bears the rest of the way.
The Cards fired to 10-3 and 25-
16 leads in the first half only to
see their margin at one point cut
to just two when Dick Smith
scored for Cal on a full court
drive.

However a great long-range tip
in by Dose enabled the Indians
to leave the court with a 33-29
half-time edge.
When the two squads again
took the floor it looked like a
tough game that could go either
way.

CAL’S BRUCE Ballmer opened
with a jumper from the corner
to cut the margin to a scant two
points, but Card guard Don Cle
met.son countered with a free
throw.

Denny Lewis hit a 25-foot jump
shot and coach Rene Herrerias’s
Bears were within a point.

But backcourt ace Darrell
Sutherland canned a jumper from
in tight and Dose drove a base
line to push the score to 38-33.

Ballmer and Lewis hit three
fouls between them and the mar
gin was just one bucket again.
BUT DOSE and his mates con
tinued hot and opened up a com
fortable 10-point gap 47-37, and
from there held on to the end.

Cal, suffering Us seventh suc
cessive setback in league play,
was a determined if outclassed
ball club.
In fact, the Bears out-rebound-

Ed the taller Cards 45-44, this
despite the fact that the men
from Berkeley had three men on
the court under 6-3 most of the
game.

STANFORD OUTSHOT Cal 37
per cent to 31 per cent.
Tom Dose’s 21 points led a hot
and cold Stanford past California
64-51 Friday.

Dose scored on his specialties,
tipins, set ups under the basket,
and even one 25-foot set shot. All
told, he had eight buckets from
the floor and five free' throws.

THi: tiAMIO STAKTKI) out like
another one of those games at
Berkeley, with Cal ahead 5-3 after
two and a half minutes had been
played. But Stanford went on a
spree that saw them score 20 of
the next 26 points and get a
23-11 lead.
This was Cal’s cue to hit one of
their infrequent hot streaks and
they pulled to within 27-21, main
ly because of two 25-footers by
Bruce Ballmer.
Stanford regained its footing,
thanks to some Cal fouls, and
took a 33-24 half-time lead.
DOSK SCOKFD nine in the first
half, and Windsor followed with
eight, his total output for the
night. Cal's high scorer in the
first half had four. Ballmer, Ed
Donahue, Denny Lewis and Dick
Smith all made tha many.
The tipoff to begin the second
half was the Indians’ cue to go
into their longest scoring drouth
of the season.
Stanford went five and a half
minutes without a point to open
the second stanza. Luckily for the
Tribe. Cal could manage only
three markers in that period.
When Dose finally hit a 10-foot
jumper to break the spell, the
score was 35-27, so the Indians
lost only a single point.

AT THIS POINT, Cal put on*
their full-court zone press. This
is what gave Stanford the impe
tus needed to pull ahead and
stay there. Stanford made seven
layins, and received numerous
free throws, all needed, as Cal
came to within seven points fre
quently, but couldn’t make the
extra push to pull abreast of the
Cards.
Phil Kelly, in particular, broke
up the press with three layins on
long passes from Don Clemetson
or Darrell Sutherland.

The Stanford ruggers de
feated the Olympic Club H-0
Saturday, to extend their sea
son record to 5-0, and the
swimming team edged Foot
hills iI.C. and Long Beach
ii- a triangular meet. See
tomorrow’s Daily for the de
tails.


38 POINTS OVER THE WEEKEND by sophomore center Tom Dose
were essential to the Indians' double triumph over California. Dose
also was the Tribe's top rebounder, especially Saturday, when he
pulled down 18.

into their longest scoring drouth
of the season.
Stanford went five and a half
minutes without a point to open
the second stanza. Luckily for the
Tribe. Cal could manage only
three markers in that period.
When Dose finally hit a 10-foot
jumper to break the spell, the
score was 35-27, so the Indians
lost only a single point.

AT THIS POINT, Cal put on*
their full-court zone press. This
is what gave Stanford the impe
tus needed to pull ahead and
stay there. Stanford made seven
layins, and received numerous
free throws, all needed, as Cal
came to within seven points fre
quently, but couldn’t make the
extra push to pull abreast of the
Cards.
Phil Kelly, in particular, broke
up the press with three layins on
long passes from Don Clemetson
or Darrell Sutherland.

The Stanford ruggers de
feated the Olympic Club H-0
Saturday, to extend their sea
son record to 5-0, and the
swimming team edged Foot

38 POINTS OVER THE WEEKEND by sophomore center Tom Dose
were essential to the Indians' double triumph over California. Dose
also was the Tribe's top rebounder, especially Saturday, when he
pulled down 18.
The Stanford Indians, battling
hard to stay in the Big Five bas
ketball race, kept their chances
alive over the weekend with two
victories over arch-rival Califor
nia.

Saturday night in the Pavilion
the Tribe outlasted the Bears 59-
54. while Friday’s score at Har
mon Gym in Berkeley was 64-51.

A SPLIT IN a pair of games be
tween USC and league-leading
UCLA in the southland enabled
the Cards of coach Howie Dali
mar to cling to their slim hope of
catching the Bruins in the AAWU
race.

UCLA has a 7-1 record while
Stanford is 5-3. USC, the pre-sea
son favorite for West Coast lau
rels is third with five wins and
four losses.

Tom Dose’s consistent scoring
led both the Stanford wins as the
6-8 sophomore center from Glen
dale hit 21 and 17 points in the
two outings.
SATURDAY’S GAME in he Pa
vilion, witnessed by a capacity
crowd and a television audience,
was a story of Stanford jumping
on top of outmanned Cal early
and then fighting off the scrappy
Bears the rest of the way.
The Cards fired to 10-3 and 25-
16 leads in the first half only to
see their margin at one point cut
to just two when Dick Smith
scored for Cal on a full court
drive.

However a great long-range tip
in by Dose enabled the Indians
to leave the court with a 33-29
half-time edge.
When the two squads again
took the floor it looked like a
tough game that could go either
way.

CAL’S BRUCE Ballmer opened
with a jumper from the corner
to cut the margin to a scant two
points, but Card guard Don Cle
met.son countered with a free
throw.

Denny Lewis hit a 25-foot jump
shot and coach Rene Herrerias’s
Bears were within a point.

But backcourt ace Darrell
Sutherland canned a jumper from
in tight and Dose drove a base
line to push the score to 38-33.

Ballmer and Lewis hit three
fouls between them and the mar
gin was just one bucket again.
BUT DOSE and his mates con
tinued hot and opened up a com
fortable 10-point gap 47-37, and
from there held on to the end.

Cal, suffering Us seventh suc
cessive setback in league play,
was a determined if outclassed
ball club.
In fact, the Bears out-rebound-

Ed the taller Cards 45-44, this
despite the fact that the men
from Berkeley had three men on
the court under 6-3 most of the
game.

STANFORD OUTSHOT Cal 37

Tom Dose’s 21 points led a hot
and cold Stanford past California
64-51 Friday.

Dose scored on his specialties,
tipins, set ups under the basket,
and even one 25-foot set shot. All
told, he had eight buckets from
the floor and five free' throws.

This was Cal’s cue to hit one of
their infrequent hot streaks and
they pulled to within 27-21, main
ly because of two 25-footers by
Bruce Ballmer.
Stanford regained its footing,

STANFORD OUTSHOT Cal 37
per cent to 31 per cent.
Tom Dose’s 21 points led a hot
and cold Stanford past California
64-51 Friday.

Dose scored on his specialties,
tipins, set ups under the basket,
and even one 25-foot set shot. All
told, he had eight buckets from
the floor and five free' throws.

THi: tiAMIO STAKTKI) out like
another one of those games at
Berkeley, with Cal ahead 5-3 after
two and a half minutes had been
played. But Stanford went on a
spree that saw them score 20 of
the next 26 points and get a
23-11 lead.
This was Cal’s cue to hit one of
their infrequent hot streaks and
they pulled to within 27-21, main
ly because of two 25-footers by
Bruce Ballmer.
Stanford regained its footing,
thanks to some Cal fouls, and
took a 33-24 half-time lead.
DOSK SCOKFD nine in the first
half, and Windsor followed with
eight, his total output for the
night. Cal's high scorer in the
first half had four. Ballmer, Ed
Donahue, Denny Lewis and Dick
Smith all made tha many.
The tipoff to begin the second
half was the Indians’ cue to go
into their longest scoring drouth
of the season.
Stanford went five and a half
minutes without a point to open
the second stanza. Luckily for the
Tribe. Cal could manage only
three markers in that period.
When Dose finally hit a 10-foot
jumper to break the spell, the
score was 35-27, so the Indians
lost only a single point.

AT THIS POINT, Cal put on*
their full-court zone press. This
is what gave Stanford the impe
tus needed to pull ahead and
stay there. Stanford made seven
layins, and received numerous
free throws, all needed, as Cal
came to within seven points fre
quently, but couldn’t make the
extra push to pull abreast of the
Cards.
Phil Kelly, in particular, broke
up the press with three layins on
long passes from Don Clemetson
or Darrell Sutherland.

The Stanford ruggers de
feated the Olympic Club H-0

son record to 5-0, and the
swimming team edged Foot

38 POINTS OVER THE WEEKEND by sophomore center Tom Dose
were essential to the Indians' double triumph over California. Dose
also was the Tribe's top rebounder, especially Saturday, when he
pulled down 18.
The Stanford Indians, battling
hard to stay in the Big Five bas
ketball race, kept their chances
alive over the weekend with two
victories over arch-rival Califor
nia.

Saturday night in the Pavilion
the Tribe outlasted the Bears 59-
54. while Friday’s score at Har
mon Gym in Berkeley was 64-51.

A SPLIT IN a pair of games be
tween USC and league-leading
UCLA in the southland enabled
the Cards of coach Howie Dali
mar to cling to their slim hope of
catching the Bruins in the AAWU
race.

UCLA has a 7-1 record while
Stanford is 5-3. USC, the pre-sea
son favorite for West Coast lau
rels is third with five wins and
four losses.

Tom Dose’s consistent scoring
led both the Stanford wins as the
6-8 sophomore center from Glen
dale hit 21 and 17 points in the
two outings.
SATURDAY’S GAME in he Pa

crowd and a television audience,
was a story of Stanford jumping
on top of outmanned Cal early
and then fighting off the scrappy
Bears the rest of the way.
The Cards fired to 10-3 and 25-
16 leads in the first half only to
see their margin at one point cut
to just two when Dick Smith
scored for Cal on a full court
drive.

However a great long-range tip
in by Dose enabled the Indians
to leave the court with a 33-29
half-time edge.
When the two squads again
took the floor it looked like a
tough game that could go either
way.

CAL’S BRUCE Ballmer opened
with a jumper from the corner
to cut the margin to a scant two
points, but Card guard Don Cle
met.son countered with a free
throw.

Denny Lewis hit a 25-foot jump
shot and coach Rene Herrerias’s
Bears were within a point.

But backcourt ace Darrell
Sutherland canned a jumper from
in tight and Dose drove a base
line to push the score to 38-33.

Ballmer and Lewis hit three
fouls between them and the mar
gin was just one bucket again.
BUT DOSE and his mates con
tinued hot and opened up a com
fortable 10-point gap 47-37, and
from there held on to the end.

Cal, suffering Us seventh suc

was a determined if outclassed
