# Stanford Defeats California Twice
## 
### KEN DERY 
The Stanford Indians, battling
hard to stay in the Big Five bas
ketball race, kept their chances
alive over the weekend with two
victories over arch-rival Califor
nia.

Saturday night in the Pavilion
the Tribe outlasted the Bears 59-
54. while Friday’s score at Har
mon Gym in Berkeley was 64-51.

A SPLIT IN a pair of games be
tween USC and league-leading
UCLA in the southland enabled
the Cards of coach Howie Dali
mar to cling to their slim hope of
catching the Bruins in the AAWU
race.

UCLA has a 7-1 record while
Stanford is 5-3. USC, the pre-sea
son favorite for West Coast lau
rels is third with five wins and
four losses.

Tom Dose’s consistent scoring
led both the Stanford wins as the
6-8 sophomore center from Glen
dale hit 21 and 17 points in the
two outings.
SATURDAY’S GAME in he Pa
vilion, witnessed by a capacity
crowd and a television audience,
was a story of Stanford jumping
on top of outmanned Cal early
and then fighting off the scrappy
Bears the rest of the way.
The Cards fired to 10-3 and 25-
16 leads in the first half only to
see their margin at one point cut
to just two when Dick Smith
scored for Cal on a full court
drive.

However a great long-range tip
in by Dose enabled the Indians
to leave the court with a 33-29
half-time edge.
When the two squads again
took the floor it looked like a
tough game that could go either
way.

CAL’S BRUCE Ballmer opened
with a jumper from the corner
to cut the margin to a scant two
points, but Card guard Don Cle
met.son countered with a free
throw.

Denny Lewis hit a 25-foot jump
shot and coach Rene Herrerias’s
Bears were within a point.

But backcourt ace Darrell
Sutherland canned a jumper from
in tight and Dose drove a base
line to push the score to 38-33.

Ballmer and Lewis hit three
fouls between them and the mar
gin was just one bucket again.
BUT DOSE and his mates con
tinued hot and opened up a com
fortable 10-point gap 47-37, and
from there held on to the end.

Cal, suffering Us seventh suc
cessive setback in league play,
was a determined if outclassed
ball club.
In fact, the Bears out-rebound-

Ed the taller Cards 45-44, this
despite the fact that the men
from Berkeley had three men on
the court under 6-3 most of the
game.

STANFORD OUTSHOT Cal 37
per cent to 31 per cent.
