# Gus Hall's Speech Credit to Stanford
## 
### 
The sot-np of a private university is such that, in theory, it is
able to offer its students several advantages not within the power
of a university ultimately responsible to the taxpayers.
The University of California, a state school, was unable to give
fais Hall, a communist, the right to speak on its campus.
Stanford, although it too is vulnerable to economic pressure,
was in a position to give Hall the platform that Cal had to
deny him. The University can act in the name of freedom of
speech and academic freedom, and when it does, it is doing the
student body a great service.
That Hall swayed anyone to the side of communism is
highly doubtful, but his explication of the Supreme Court's recent
upholding of the McCarran Act w as worthy of notice.
Communists, whose civil liberties are most constantly under
attack and who are most directly implicated by the McCarran
Act, are extremely sensitive to its effects.
Hall feels that registration under the McCarran Act is “impos
sible,” because it implies a plea of guilty to a felony and means
automatic conviction under the Smith Act.
It means he is guilty of being the agent of a foreign power, a
crime for which he has never been tried.
The McCarran Act is what Supreme Court Justice Hugo
Black called a “classic bill of attainder." It denies some people
certain civil rights without evidence, jury or trial proceedings. By
registering, one pleads guilty to something for which he has not
been tried, that is, to being the agent of a foreign power.
Hall has refused to register and to charge himself with a felony,
it seems to us, rightly.

The denial ol civil liberties to anyone without due process, as
in the McCarran and Smith Acts, poses a grave danger to everyone.
The University’s affirmation of Hall’s rights in permitting him
to present his views is commendable.
