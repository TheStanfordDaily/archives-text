RENOUNCE STEREOTYPES
Editor, The Daily:
After observing the Turn To
ward Peace discussion at the li
brary on Friday, several ideas
have occurred to us about politi
cal beliefs and expression.
We were impressed by the open
discussion and diversity of opin
ion of the audience. Significantly,
the irresponsible and ludicrous
performance of the self-appointed
leaders of the Stanford right
wing interrupted a member of
the audience who had been in
vited by the speaker to present
an opposing viewpoint.
Both liberals and conservatives
were present and participating in
the discussion. The interruption
demonstrated the contrast be
tween creative political activity
and the intolerance which results
from inflexible dogma. The Turk-
Hermann-Weinig faction, so vocal
in the past few months, has alien
ated itself from serious discus
sion and deserves the laughter
Professor Bunzel has recommend
ed.
Why have American conserva
tives remained silent and default
ed to misrepresentation of their
beliefs by extremists? More con
servatives should be presenting
and discussing positive proposals,
rather than acquiesing to leaders
who parade around in burlap.
True liberals and conservatives
must renounce the use of slogans
and stereotypes and discuss their
beliefs in an honest and open
manner. The peace group should
be congratulated for establishing
such a forum, and those conserva
tives present deserve credit for
accepting (he challenge to discuss,

HALL REFUTED
Editor, The Daily:
Speaking to Stanford students
1 he Secretary general of the Com
munist party in America, Gus
Hall, was so freedom minded, rea
sonable and patriotic, that com
pared to him some of the previ
ous speakers, such as Norman
Thomas and even Sen. Humphrey
appeared as downright “subver
sives.” Hall also presented such a
reformist, vis. revisionist Commu
nist viewpoints that “Tito’s “na
tional Communism” sounds as
pure Stalinism compared to Hall’s
lack of orthodoxy.
For those, however, familiar
with Lenin’s writings and in par
ticular with his “Left-wing Com
munism, an Infantile Disorder,”
Hall’s moderation sems rather a
dutiful ( th o ugh astonishingly
dull) application of a basic tactical
principle when confronting a
large majority of “objective”
class enemies whose sympathies
are important to the Party in
trouble and in need of supporters.
Moreover, the readers of Theo
dore Draper’s “The Roots , of
American Communism” will cer
tainly recall his masterly analy

sis of the periodic rediscovery of
“Americanization” by the Ameri
can communists, as part of “a
rhythmic rotation from Commu
nist sectarianism to Americanized
oportunism.”
But the most meaningful ele
ment in appraising Hall's per
formance concerns one of the ba
sic political facts of our time:
while in opposition and fighting
for power, communists profess to
be the most genuine proponents
of freedom and civil rights. Once
in power, however, they suppress
most ruthlessly every trace of
non conformity. Let us hope that
Hall’s Stanford listeners will
never have the opportunity to
witness this “dialectical” passage
when the hailing of freedom
transforms into the exact oppo
site.

APPROACH QUESTIONED
Editor, The Daily:
We agree with the “Turn To
ward Peace” group in that we de
sire an alternative to war. Also
we believe that some positive
steps in this direction are neces
sary. We question, however, the
group’s approach to the public.
If the purpose of the “Turn
Toward Peace” rally, was to air
individual views, then the ap
proach in public should be of the
individual’s choice. If, however,
the primary purpose of this rally
was to create favorable public
opinion toward the group’s posi
tion, then these people should
consider the image they present.
The public who is approached
is often automatically put on the
defensive by the radical appear
ance of some of the advocates of
these movements. Wo do not con
tend that the public is justified in
these views. We only suggest that
if any such group wishes to ap
peal to popular backing, partici
pants should cast aside personal
tastes and consider what the gen
eral public accepts.

PLEASED
Editor, The Daily:
I was surprised and pleased at
both the polite audience reaction
toward and the accurate Daily re
porting of Gus Hall’s speech on
Thursday. I hope that this demon
stration of audience control and
responsibility and the example of
Jerry Rankin’s unbiased and suf
ficiently complete coverage will
serve as models to subsequent
Stanford audiences and reporters.
In view of the magnitude of
cynicism that pervades the Stan
ford campus, I feel compelled to
add for the benefit of those who
were not able to attend the
speech, that this letter is in no
way intended to be sarcastic; it is
written in complete sincerity.
