GREEK WEEK QUEEN Judy McClure, Alpha Sigma Phi's nominee, is presented, appropriately enough,
an armload of American Beauties by IFC President Swede Pierson at Saturday's IFC Ball at the Fair
mont Hotel's Grand Ballroom. Looking on are Kappa Sigma's Lauri Munro, Kappa Alpha's Chris von
Saltza and Delta Upsilon's top chariotrix, Jaki Laney. The Alpha Sigs’ 100 percent attendance at the

the mudsoaked Queens' Games last Friday.
