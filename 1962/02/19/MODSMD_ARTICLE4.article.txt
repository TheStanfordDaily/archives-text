## Soviets Reject Western Protests, Plan Exclusive Use of Corridor 
### 
BERLIN (UPI) The Soviet
Union yesterday rejected West
ern protests and warnings over
interference with Allied air traffic
in the Berlin corridors and de
manded exclusive use of part of
one of the air lanes today.

Allied sources said the Russians
reported they would use all the
space up to 7,500 feet in the Ber
lin-Hamburg corridor between
9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. 3:30
a.m. and 6:30 a.m. EST.
“YOU CAN assume our re
sponse will b similar to that of
last week,” the sources said. The
Allies then sent extra military
transports through the three 20-
mile-wide corridors to show their
determination to keep the lanes
free from Communist obstruc
tions.

It was the seventh time in 11
days that the Soviets have tried
to monopolize part of the vital
air links between Berlin and the
West.

The Russian representative at
the four-power air safety control
center in Berlin demanded that
altitudes up to 7,500 feet be “re
served” for the exclusive use of
Soviet military planes for certain
specified hours. The Allied repre
sentatives rejected the demands
as a violation of four-power agree
ments and extra military flights
sent through the corridors during
the hours the Russians sought
to monopolize.
LAST WEEK, Russian MIGs
shadowed Western military and
commercial planes in the 20-mile
wide air corridors over East Ger

many. Several performed acro
batics dangerously close to the
Western aircraft.
The United States, Britain and
France warned Russia last Thurs
day that the buzzing of Allied
planes by Soviet MIG jets in the
corridors “seriously threatened’’
traffic in the corridors across
East Germany.

THE ALLIES warned that the
Soviet Union was “running grave
risks’’ and would be responsible
for any incidents.
Saturday night, the Soviets de
livered notes to the three West
ern embassies in Moscow, reject
ing the protests.

Contents of the notes were not
immediately disclosed and West
ern sources here refused to com
ment.
