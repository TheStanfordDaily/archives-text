tered the Soviet sector for a one

cording to State Department of
ficials in Washington.

Stanford student, moved to Ber
lin at the close of the Stanford-in-
Germany seventh session, shortly
before Christmas.
Mann was reported to have
made friends with students at
Humboldt University in East Ber
lin.
An American student notified
the United States Mission in West
Berlin that Mann had entered the
Soviet sector, leaving behind him
his clothing and other personal
belongings.
Stanford students who were
with Mann at Stuttgart last quar
ter fear he has been arrested by
East German authorities but
don’t know on what charges. One
of them, junior Mike Randall, said
there was “no chance whatever’’
that Mann has defected to East
Germany.
RANDALL SAID Mann, stu
dents from his group, sophomore
Joan Glenn and junior John M.
Lee, moved to Berlin at the close
of their session, staying at Haus
der Zukunft (House of the Fu

An American spokesman for
the U.S. Consulate said Mann was

STANFORD AUTHORITIES
said they are cooperating with
the State Department in helping

Press reported the U.S. consulate
in Berlin is trying to locate Mann
but that officials say as little as
possible about such disappear
ances on the grounds that publici
ty hampers negotiations, usually
carried on by a small number of
lawyers authorized to practice in
both East and West Berlin.
The Communists have said
nothing about Mann either, the
AP said.
Francis Tully, the State De
partment’s press officer, said in
Washington, D.C., that no in
quiries concerning Mann have
been sent to Russian authorities.
“We’re trying to find out as much
information as we can before we
take that step,” he said.
MANN’S PARENTS, Charles
W. Mann, athletic coach and phys
ical education teacher at Los An
geles Valley College, and Mis.
Mann were notified by the State
Department of his disappearance
late last month.
Mann’s parents said they con
sidered their son “mature” and
able to handle any situation that
came up. The elder Mann relayed
a message through the University
news department that he and his
wife had received no information
other than what the State Depart
ment reported.
