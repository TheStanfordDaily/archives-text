## Storm Toll Nears 200 
### 
HAMBURG, Germany (UPD—
The death toll in one of the worst
winter storms in northern Euro
pean history climbed toward the
200 mark Sunday night as thou
sands of rescue workers searched
the flooded countryside in a
search for survivors.

A still incomplete count placed
the overall European toll at 173
and the West German toll at 143
following storms that unleashed
floods through North Sea com
munities. Rescue workers flying
in helicopters saw many more
bodies floating in the flood wa
ters.

Hamburg, a city of 2.8 million,
was the worst hit. More than 100,-
000 persons were homeless and
authorities said 107 bodies had
been discovered in this sodden
city.
The vicious three-day storm
struck Friday with hurricane
force winds that crumpled dikes
and sent avalanches rumbling
down alpine mountains. Tens of
thousands of British, American
and German rescue workers
many of them servicemen—were
engaged in rescue work.
