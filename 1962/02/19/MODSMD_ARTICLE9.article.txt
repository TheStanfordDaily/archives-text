# Peace Groups Elicit Many Reactions
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
Drawing observers numbering
up to 130 at a time, and a counter
demonstration from a group of
campus conservatives, Stanford
students conducted a seven-hour
demonstration for disarmament
on the library lawn Friday.
Reaching their maximum audi
ence during the noon hour stu
dent speakers program, the Stan
ford demonstrators were handing
out literature and presenting
views on peace simultaneously
with a parallel group forming the
biggest picket line ever assembled
in front of the White House.
BOTH THE WASHINGTON
student-faculty demonstration

numbering 3,000 at its height Sat
urday and the farm activities
were part of the national “Turn
Toward Peace” movement. In
both instances, the peace groups
were countered by smaller dem
onstrations (150 Young Ameri
cans lor Freedom members in
Washington, approximately eight
at Stanford i by students of op
posing views.
Medical School student Steve
Morris began the Farm program
at noon by addressing a group of
60 on the meaning of non-violence
“forego the use of violence to
meet violence.” As Morris yielded
the floor (the main libe’s front
steps) to student Dan Cohen, a
burlap-clad switch-flailing group
burst from the main entrance of
the library bearing signs stating,
“Grovel for Peace” and “Howl for
Peace” to demonstrate their non
acceptance of the peace group's
proposals.
Led by Dick Weineg, chairman
of the Conservative Caucus, Ross
Hermann, president of the Stan
ford Area Young Republicans
and Boh Turk, president of the
local Young American for Free
dom group, the counter-demon
stators circled the lawn shouting,
“We know you’re a nice man,
Khrushchev,” “Howl, Howl, Howl
for Peace.”
In the meantime, the crowd

around the student speakers had
grown to approximately 75 as
Cohen continued his address on

"The Scientist’s Responsibility for
Peace” and the listeners closed
ranks to block out what moder
ator Nick Shoumatoff called “the
most colorful counterdemonstra
tion I’ve over seen,” and the
sparse applause that greeted it.
WITH THE STATEMENTS of
student Lew Cabot on the ’’jug
gernaut of the warfare state—-the
military-industrial complex” the
crowd became active and entered
into general debate.
Reactions of the listeners were
mixed as to the effectiveness of
the peace demonstration and its
purposes, as the crowd itself ex
hibited heterogeneous political be
liefs.
Indicative was the impatient re
mark of a student as he replied to
one of the other audience mem
bers who was heatedly challeng
ing Cabot: “I’m just as rank a
conservative as you are. I'm just
trying to be a bit more reason
able.”
When Kepler’s employee and
local grade school teacher Ira
Sandpearl an active in the Bay
Area peace movement—appeared
at the demonstration he com
mented, “Effectiveness? It is part
of an overall program. Everytime
someone stands up it is important.
What is important is this is the
first time something of this type
has gone up all over the country,”
Other members of the always
shifting audience evaluated:
very little effectiveness. They
draw their own crowd, while
other people just stop around to
sec what's going on.”
“THIS SHOWS some kind of
activity on the Stanford campus
is going on. It puts Stanford’s
name on the roll.”
“This could be effective, but
they would have to actually make
speeches rather than elicit re
marks from the audience off the
top of the head.”
Meanwhile, back in Washing

ton, demonstrators, including stu
dents and faculty members from
the Eastern seaboard, busloads
from midwestern schools, and a
planeload from the University of
California at Berkeley hiked from
the White House picket site to the
tomb of the unknown soldier, then
to an afternoon rally near the
Washington monument on Fri
day, to listen to many-times So
cialist candidate for President
Norman Thomas.
ORGANIZED M A I N E V by
“Tocsin,” a Harvard disarmament
group, the demonstrators visited
top aides of President Kennedy, a
good number of Congressmen,
and several embassies, as colleges
and high schools all over the na
tion staged sympathy demonstra

tions.
A student spokesman, after a
conversation with special coun
sel Theodore Sorenson, said Presi
dent Kennedy had relayed a mes
sage that he “was impressed with
the size of the demonstration and
the students’ constructive ap
proach.”
While the peace marchers felt
satisfaction after their contact
with the Kennedy staff, they de
claimed their encounter with the
State Department.
Don Carter of the University
of California at Berkeley and an
officer in the Turn Toward Peace
Council, stated, “The general im
pression I got was that we were
very much resented for daring to
question the policies of the gov-

I ernment.”
HARVARD PARTICIPANT Pe
'ter Goodmark said of the State
Department, “(they) treated us as
if we were very, very young and
totally in the dark” about the cold
war.
Associated Press reports that
State Department officials said
the students appeared to feel they
already had all the answers to
world problems.
About 4,000 of the estimated
4,700 who swarmed into Washing
ton for the demonstration attend
ed a closing rally Saturday night
and cheered wildly as Socialist
leader Norman Thomas attacked
Holifield and other advocates of
maintaining a powerful military
posture.


A PEACE DEMONSTRATION on the Library lawn last Saturday, part of a national 'Turn Toward Peace'
movement, attracted many comments including a counter demonstration by the campus conservatives,
