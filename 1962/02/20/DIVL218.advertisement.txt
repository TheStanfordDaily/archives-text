INDIANS
I cannot tell a lie,
R A is by far the
best place to shop,—
and besides they have
Super Charge. With
just your reg. card
in your cherry pickin'
hand you can trot
right down to the
store and open up
this symbol of free
enterprise (laissez
faire—don’t get cute).
Buy what you want
now and take a long
time to pay.
