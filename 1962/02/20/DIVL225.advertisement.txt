STANFORD
RESEARCH INSTITUTE (5.R.1.)
Follows HARVARD
S.R.I. s Recreational Committee has officially decided that—in one respect at
least—Harvard has shown the way—the way to EUROPE. The Recreation Com
mittee (an organization of and for those at S.R.I. interested in traveling during
their vacations) has chosen the V.T.C. charter flights and tours for Stanford and
S.R.I. as the best offered this year I And well it should; Y.T.C.'s first West Coast
offering gives S.R.I. AND STANFORD a chance to take the same high-quality
low-cost flights and tours that have been so overwhelmingly successful at
Harvard (12 Y.T.C. flights and 4 Y.T.C. tours last year), M.1.T., Duke and else
where. (Y.T.C. has arranged tours for over 50,000 Europeans!)
Why? Y.T.C. flights go via major scheduled airlines, with the
trans-Atlantic portion by jet.
Y.T.C. tours include 3 meals a day —every day.
Y.T.C. tours include all accommodations— at hotels only.
Y.T.C. land transportation is by deluxe buses, with re
clining seats.
Y.T.C. tours offer ample free time for sightseeing or
shopping.
And the cost?
3-week roundtrip flight (June 24 - July 17)—5460.
3-week all inclusive tour of 10 countries—s29B.
For further information contact your local Y.T.C. representatives: John and
Connie Ruch, Star Route Box 70, Redwood City, or after 7:00 p.m. or weekends,
Pioneer 7-0266 (La Honda).
