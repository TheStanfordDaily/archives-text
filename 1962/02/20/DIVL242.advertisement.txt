IF THE SHOE FITS..
.. . then we probably have nothing to offer you now. We like to fill our big
shoe jobs from within. So if you’re looking for room to grow, try us. Our
senior engineers and executives of the future must come up from the college
ranks of today. Many of our top men began their careers in our engineering
departments and not so long ago. Time now for you to take that first step:
sign up for an interview with the men from General Dynamics.
We’ll be on campus soon to discuss opportunities at our Astronautics
and Convair Divisions in San Diego, California; Pomona Division,
Pomona, California; Fort Worth Division, Fort Worth, Texas; Electronics
and Telecommunication Divisions, Rochester, New York. See your
Placement Officer or write Mr. H. T. Brooks, Manager of Personnel Place
ment, General Dynamics, P. O. Box 2672, San Diego 12, California.
