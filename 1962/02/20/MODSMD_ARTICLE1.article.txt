# Committee Proposes Student Activity in Campus Administration
## 
### JOHN STEINBRUNER 
(Editor’** Note: This is the i'irst of three
articles on the proposals submitted to LASSU
by the special committee on tlie new consti
tution and the philosophy behind them.)

A special committee appointed by ASSU
President Bob Saylor has been evaluating
over the past three months the possibilities
and actualities of student government at
Stanford.

It is I he opinion of this committee that
student government is necessary, pertinent
and valuable but that the present ASSU
operation is in need of revision and change
of emphasis.
The specific proposals of the committee
are being submitted in the form of a new
ASSU constitution which is being considered
this week in Legislature, and will hopefully
be submitted for student referendum at
either the end of this quarter or the begin-

ning of next. The committee wishes to bring
the proposals contained in the constitution
before the student body for consideration.
IT IS our basic premise that each student
should be actively concerned with issues in
the University, the nation and the world
which affect students and that it is essential
to have an adequate association to represent
Stanford students in these issues according
to democratic principles.
The present ASSU structure does not ac
complish these aims. It is not truly repre
sentative and it has no structure for con
sistent and efficient formulation and expres
sion of student views in any of these areas.
IN THE area of the University it is our
opinion that the students should participate
in the policy making procedures handled by
the administration since what is done there
heavily affects our life at the University,
academic and otherwise.
As of now there is very little communica

tion between the students for whom the Uni
versity exists and the faculty and adminis
tration who run it. Policy decisions are made
without real knowledge of the problems of
the student body and wholly without their
opinions. The students themselves are to
blame for this.
THERE ARE two ways which the stu
dents can participate in the policy-making
procedure of the University: they can sit
jointly with the faculty committees advising
the President, or they can form student com
mittees which parallel these faculty commit
tees.
In the new constitution we have selected
the second of these alternatives as the only
one feasible at this time with the hope that
cooperation between the student and faculty
committees and perhaps even consolidation
will result.
The student committee chairmen will be
appointed by the ASSU President, and they

will select their own committees.
These student committees will consider
the major topics and decisions facing the Uni
versity in each of the areas which directly
affect the student day. Thus there will be
student committees corresponding to such
faculty committees as general studies, under
graduate education, etc.
THE REPORTS and proposals which they
submit will go before the Legislature who
may give official student endorsement to
these reports and proposals by a two-thirds
majority vote in favor; they may veto them
by a two-thirds majority against; or they
may simply let them pass for submission to
the appropriate administration officials. This
structure is provided for in the executive
article.

There are several considerations which
led to this proposal: it embodies our basic
principle stated above. It allows students to
deal with major topics of the administration

while avoiding waste of time on minor ad
ministrative details and irrelevant topics on
which the student voice could have little or
no effect.
IT ENABLES the ASSU to tap the re
source of able students (especially graduate
students) who have special areas of interest
and specific ideas as to how the University
can be improved but a limited amount of
time. It forces students to think out ideas
and their implications completely and to ex
press them clearly and effectively.
It will inform the administration officials
about problems which the students have no
ticed but which have not received adminis
trative attention. It will bring student per
spective into consideration in university
policy. It will provide the student body with
a powerful means of agitation to bring about
improvements which we see as needed.
(Tomorrow the parallel committee
structure).

should be actively concerned with issues in
the University, the nation and the world
which affect students and that it is essential
to have an adequate association to represent
Stanford students in these issues according
to democratic principles.
The present ASSU structure does not ac
complish these aims. It is not truly repre
sentative and it has no structure for con
sistent and efficient formulation and expres
sion of student views in any of these areas.
IN THE area of the University it is our
opinion that the students should participate
in the policy making procedures handled by
the administration since what is done there
heavily affects our life at the University,
academic and otherwise.
As of now there is very little communica

tion between the students for whom the Uni
versity exists and the faculty and adminis
tration who run it. Policy decisions are made
without real knowledge of the problems of
the student body and wholly without their
opinions. The students themselves are to
blame for this.
THERE ARE two ways which the stu
dents can participate in the policy-making
procedure of the University: they can sit
jointly with the faculty committees advising
the President, or they can form student com
mittees which parallel these faculty commit
tees.
In the new constitution we have selected
the second of these alternatives as the only
one feasible at this time with the hope that
cooperation between the student and faculty
committees and perhaps even consolidation
will result.
The student committee chairmen will be
appointed by the ASSU President, and they

will select their own committees.
These student committees will consider
the major topics and decisions facing the Uni
versity in each of the areas which directly
affect the student day. Thus there will be
student committees corresponding to such
faculty committees as general studies, under
graduate education, etc.
THE REPORTS and proposals which they
submit will go before the Legislature who
may give official student endorsement to
these reports and proposals by a two-thirds
majority vote in favor; they may veto them
by a two-thirds majority against; or they
may simply let them pass for submission to
the appropriate administration officials. This
structure is provided for in the executive
article.

There are several considerations which
led to this proposal: it embodies our basic
principle stated above. It allows students to
deal with major topics of the administration

while avoiding waste of time on minor ad
ministrative details and irrelevant topics on
which the student voice could have little or
no effect.
IT ENABLES the ASSU to tap the re
source of able students (especially graduate
students) who have special areas of interest
and specific ideas as to how the University
can be improved but a limited amount of
time. It forces students to think out ideas
and their implications completely and to ex
press them clearly and effectively.
It will inform the administration officials
about problems which the students have no
ticed but which have not received adminis
trative attention. It will bring student per
spective into consideration in university
policy. It will provide the student body with
a powerful means of agitation to bring about
improvements which we see as needed.

structure).

blame for this.
THERE ARE two ways which the stu
dents can participate in the policy-making
procedure of the University: they can sit
jointly with the faculty committees advising
the President, or they can form student com
mittees which parallel these faculty commit
tees.
In the new constitution we have selected
the second of these alternatives as the only
one feasible at this time with the hope that
cooperation between the student and faculty
committees and perhaps even consolidation
will result.
The student committee chairmen will be
appointed by the ASSU President, and they

will select their own committees.
These student committees will consider
the major topics and decisions facing the Uni
versity in each of the areas which directly
affect the student day. Thus there will be
student committees corresponding to such
faculty committees as general studies, under
graduate education, etc.
THE REPORTS and proposals which they
submit will go before the Legislature who
may give official student endorsement to
these reports and proposals by a two-thirds
majority vote in favor; they may veto them
by a two-thirds majority against; or they
may simply let them pass for submission to
the appropriate administration officials. This
structure is provided for in the executive
article.

There are several considerations which
led to this proposal: it embodies our basic
principle stated above. It allows students to
deal with major topics of the administration

while avoiding waste of time on minor ad
ministrative details and irrelevant topics on
which the student voice could have little or
no effect.
IT ENABLES the ASSU to tap the re
source of able students (especially graduate
students) who have special areas of interest
and specific ideas as to how the University
can be improved but a limited amount of
time. It forces students to think out ideas
and their implications completely and to ex
press them clearly and effectively.
It will inform the administration officials
about problems which the students have no
ticed but which have not received adminis
trative attention. It will bring student per
spective into consideration in university
policy. It will provide the student body with
a powerful means of agitation to bring about
improvements which we see as needed.
(Tomorrow the parallel committee
structure).
