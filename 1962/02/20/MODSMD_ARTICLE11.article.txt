# History Department Is Praised By Students
## 
### SHAWN DELANEY ROBERT PILPEL For the Subcommittee on Academic Review 
The foundation of any depart
ment is, of course, its personnel.
This is as true of the history de
partment as of any other. The
history faculty is characterized
by a generally high level of com
petence; so high, in fact, that in
a few cases it affords the history
student an educational dividend
obtainable from few other
sources: association with “great”

educators.
The framework in which the
faculty works, however, leaves a
few things to be desired. The gen
eral format of the lecture course,
which is predominant in the his
tory department, does not afford
the student the opportunity to
study the material of any one
course as intensively as might be
wished.

This is alleviated to some ex
tent by the specialized courses
with which the student may sup
plement the general knowledge
he acquires In the surveys. Since,
however, most students haven’t
the time to take many of the
specialized courses, we feel that
necessary depth should be sup
plied by honors and discussion
seminars undertaken in conjunc
tion with the surveys.

Examples of this are the speci
al seminar section of History 165
gnd the discussion sections in
History 104.
Along this line, we feel that
some courses that at present ex
tend over only one quarter should
be expanded as was American
diplomatic history this year. Such
expansion would eliminate the
tendency toward superficiality re
sulting from the attempt to cover
100 great a field in too short a
lime, and would be of special
value to non-majors.
The program for history ma
jors is generally quite good. We
have, however, two possible im
provements to suggest. First of
all we feel that while the flexi
bility of courses required in the
major is a distinct advantage, it
exists to such an extent that, in
some cases, it is not conducive to

a coherent program of study.
In light of this, it might be ad
visable to require history majors,
upon consultation, to concentrate
roughly half their total units in
one specific field prescribed by
the department.
Our second suggestion concerns
the basic seminar, the only spe
cific requirement for the major.
This seminar attempts, in five
units of work, to give the student
an intensive introduction to his
toriography; some sections also
include a study of the philosophy
of history.
We feel that both of these dis
ciplines are of considerable value
to the history major, and that
such value could and should be
maximized by concentrating on
them separately through two bas
ic seminars of three or four units
each.

As opposed to the elasticity of
the major program, the Honors
Program, due to the directed read
ing requirement which extends
over three successive quarters,
tends to be slightly rigid. To cor
rect this, and in addition to make
the program more diversified, we
would suggest two directed read
ing programs, each two quarters
long, to be taken in the junior and
senior years.

Several suggestions can be
made in conclusion. Guest lec
tures by professors from other
social science departments could
emphasize a particular aspect of
history and might greatly aid the
student’s understanding and ap
preciation of the material; for ex
ample, lectures by members of
the sociology department would
be helpful where pertinent ma
terial could best be presented by
a specialist in social history.
Another possible innovation
would be a survey course in East
ern Civilization: this would cor
relate with the new surge of in
terest which all students have
shown for Far Eastern affairs.
Finally, the institution of
courses dealing with the evolu
tion of particular aspects of civi
lization (e.g., the History of Diplo
macy i might encourage a greater
perspective and breadth in view
ing historical developments.

100 great a field in too short a
lime, and would be of special
value to non-majors.
The program for history ma
jors is generally quite good. We
have, however, two possible im
provements to suggest. First of
all we feel that while the flexi
bility of courses required in the
major is a distinct advantage, it
exists to such an extent that, in
some cases, it is not conducive to

a coherent program of study.
In light of this, it might be ad
visable to require history majors,
upon consultation, to concentrate
roughly half their total units in
one specific field prescribed by
the department.
Our second suggestion concerns
the basic seminar, the only spe
cific requirement for the major.
This seminar attempts, in five
units of work, to give the student
an intensive introduction to his
toriography; some sections also
include a study of the philosophy
of history.
We feel that both of these dis
ciplines are of considerable value
to the history major, and that
such value could and should be
maximized by concentrating on
them separately through two bas
ic seminars of three or four units
each.

As opposed to the elasticity of
the major program, the Honors
Program, due to the directed read
ing requirement which extends
over three successive quarters,
tends to be slightly rigid. To cor
rect this, and in addition to make
the program more diversified, we
would suggest two directed read
ing programs, each two quarters
long, to be taken in the junior and
senior years.

Several suggestions can be
made in conclusion. Guest lec
tures by professors from other
social science departments could
emphasize a particular aspect of
history and might greatly aid the
student’s understanding and ap
preciation of the material; for ex
ample, lectures by members of
the sociology department would
be helpful where pertinent ma
terial could best be presented by
a specialist in social history.
Another possible innovation
would be a survey course in East
ern Civilization: this would cor
relate with the new surge of in
terest which all students have
shown for Far Eastern affairs.
Finally, the institution of
courses dealing with the evolu
tion of particular aspects of civi
lization (e.g., the History of Diplo
macy i might encourage a greater
perspective and breadth in view
ing historical developments.
The foundation of any depart
ment is, of course, its personnel.
This is as true of the history de
partment as of any other. The
history faculty is characterized
by a generally high level of com
petence; so high, in fact, that in
a few cases it affords the history
student an educational dividend
obtainable from few other
sources: association with “great”

educators.
The framework in which the
faculty works, however, leaves a
few things to be desired. The gen
eral format of the lecture course,
which is predominant in the his
tory department, does not afford
the student the opportunity to
study the material of any one
course as intensively as might be
wished.

This is alleviated to some ex
tent by the specialized courses
with which the student may sup
plement the general knowledge
he acquires In the surveys. Since,
however, most students haven’t
the time to take many of the
specialized courses, we feel that
necessary depth should be sup
plied by honors and discussion
seminars undertaken in conjunc
tion with the surveys.

Examples of this are the speci
al seminar section of History 165
gnd the discussion sections in
History 104.
Along this line, we feel that
some courses that at present ex
tend over only one quarter should
be expanded as was American
diplomatic history this year. Such
expansion would eliminate the
tendency toward superficiality re
sulting from the attempt to cover
100 great a field in too short a

tures by professors from other
social science departments could
emphasize a particular aspect of
history and might greatly aid the
student’s understanding and ap
preciation of the material; for ex
ample, lectures by members of
the sociology department would
be helpful where pertinent ma
terial could best be presented by
a specialist in social history.
Another possible innovation
would be a survey course in East
ern Civilization: this would cor
relate with the new surge of in
terest which all students have
shown for Far Eastern affairs.
Finally, the institution of
courses dealing with the evolu
tion of particular aspects of civi
lization (e.g., the History of Diplo
macy i might encourage a greater
perspective and breadth in view
ing historical developments.
