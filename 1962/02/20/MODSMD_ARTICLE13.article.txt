# The 						Other Side of Coed Housing
## 
### SUE DAVIDSON 
Women’s Row Representative to
LASSU; Member, Undergraduate
Housing Comm.
Daily readers have recently
been given a three-part article
series on co educational housing.
As a member of the committee
which supposedly did the re
search for this statement, I feel
some sort of further explanation
is in order on a number of points.
The LASSU Committee on Un
dergraduate Housing was given
by ASSU President Bob Sayler
the charge of studying the pres
ent and future housing facilities
of the University. Several sug
gestions were given for topics of
study: improvement of current
facilities, foreign student hous
ing, co-educational housing, new
construction, the function of the
RA, and an overall housing poli
cy. These were the areas with
which the commit tee was to be
concerned.
The series of articles presented
only one facet of the Committee’s
study, and that not too clearly. I
feel that there were both mis
takes and unanswered objections
involved.
In the line of mistakes, the an
swers to a committee survey of
administrators of schools with co
educational housing were, in my
opinion, inconclusive. "Co-ed din
ing” meant in many cases a large
common dining room (or several
such) lor the entire campus- an
alogous to an all-University En
cina. What relation precisely
does an answer based on this sys
tem, or on overseas campi, have
to the application at Stanford of
coeducational meals in small,
scattered dining rooms? Some of
the letter-writers indicated that
the questions showed a misunder
standing on the part of the com
mittee on what systems their uni

versifies were using.
Also, the committee has gained
several new members since the
last lime I su\y the list, apparent
ly. I tend to think that a lot of
people with dn outside interest in
one area of housing are now “the
committee” for advertising pur
poses and that the original goal
of objective study in all areas has
been lost.
This lack of objective study
shows up most noticeably in such
statements as (to paraphrase)
“Dean Craig thinks we should
wait awhile for co-ed housing but
John Dennis, a Committee mem
ber, disagrees." To me this Is an
insult to the considered opinion
of a very co-operative and helpful
Dean if his judgment can be “ade
quately" refuted by the unsup
ported statement of a second
quarter freshman.
As to objections, I wish to avoid
any personal and therefore emo
tional ones. Basically, though I
am not adverse to co-ed housing, I
object to the lack of thorough
study on this project. It is my
opinion that a basic, University
wide housing policy MUST be de
veloped before any new scheme
is tried. And 1 think that there
are other considerations, such as
the desire and ability of students
to live in a co-ed situation.
I object to the hurry-up atti
tudes of co-ed proponents. What’s
the rush? And more fundamental
ly. why do the Stern leaders so
avidly desire invasion by fifty
women? Not for academic rea
sons, and probably not as an in
centive towards better dress and
manners. I would theorize (they
do not give reasons) that co-ed
housing might seem to he an in
ducement to move into Stern, and
a lever to make University ad
ministrators more concerned
about Stein problems. As a Stan
ford woman, I would resent being
used this way if I had been drawn

in for other reasons.
Last, I object to the lack of
thought on specific problems such
as regulation, methods of placing
students in co-ed units, with
drawals, economic considerations
and the like. The people working
on this project ignore these ob
jections, saying that all of these
things will be worked out, and
that they’re not going to worry
about them until the project is
begun. If it is to be started this
fall, I don’t think it is any too
soon to be concerned with these
topics especially if they might in
fluence the decisions of partici
pants.
It is difficult to decide where
the blame should be placed for
the confusion resulting from the
Daily article. I believe that the
Committee set up by LASSU is
still basically concerned with gen
neral plans, and that the group
of Stern students led by John
Balch made the report which was
the foundation of the Daily ar
ticle. The LASSU committee’s ac
tions were quoted in a few places,
and the article came out sounding
like the Committee’s opinion. If
the committee has specialized to
the point where it is directly con
cerned only with co-ed housing in
Stern, then it is off the track. If
not, (he Stern group or the Daily
writer has falsely attributed
someone else’s recommendations
on Stern to the LASSU commit
tee.
To me, the major need is for a
co-ordinated housing policy for
the campus, one which is well
thought out and which can be
substantiated. While Committee
members hold many various
views on co-ed housing, we are
all willing to endorse any sound
long-range plan which fits in with
general housing policy. In my
opinion, the 1963 Stern proposal
does not yet warrant such en
dorsement.
