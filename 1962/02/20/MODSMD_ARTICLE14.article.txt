OFF CAMPUS LIVING
Editor, The Daily:
A recent series of programs in
Wilbur Hall has presented the
various joys of living on campus
in Stern, Toy on. or the fraterni
ties. Unfortunately, no one seems
to have presented the case for off
campus living.
Not only does one enjoy more
congenial surroundings and a less
restricted social life; one also
avoids the financial drubbing
which the University administers
to all those who live in University
dormitories.
As of next year, it will cost $l4O
a quarter or approximately $5O
a month to live in a University
dormitory, or that you get a bed,
a desk with one uncomfortable
metal chair, and an inadequate
closet. The floor is of antiseptic
tile. The walls, of poured con
crete painted an institutional yel
low. hardly give off what could
be called a warm glow.
At present, I am living off cam
pus with four friends in two ad
joining apartments. We have two
bedrooms, two bathrooms, two
kitchens each with stove and re
frigerator, two living rooms, with
wall to wall carpeting and floor
length drapes, two couches, three
armchairs, numerous other
chairs, two tables and two desks,
ample closet space, a pleasant
little side yard with a picnic table
and a basketball backboard, a pri
vate telephone, and a young at
tractive neighbor who lets us
drive her Mercedes and doesn’t
object when we make noise. With
utilities and phone included, this
costs us each $42 a month.
Our situation is in no way
unique. Indeed, a number of our
friends have apartments superior
to and sometimes cheaper- than
ours.
Just why the University finds
it necessary to charge such out
rageous prices for the substand
ard barracks which it offers as
living quarters has always es
caped me. But if Stanford stu
dents ever develop any financial
common sense, to say nothing of
an appreciation for the pleasures
of more gracious living, the Uni
versity will soon find itself with
a bunch of empty dormitories on
its hands.

DEFINITE NEED
Editor, The Daily:
The innovations of integrated
living and the proposed Stern
Hall experiment are steps for
ward in social and intellectual re
lations at Stanford.
There is a definite need to de
velop friendships between men
and women on more than a more
physical-attraction, dating level.
With an opportunity to eat meals
together and to discuss mutual
interests, oven pholosophical
questions openly, a heretofore un
tapped source of intellectual
stimulation will be explored.
Many girls would like to have
fellows they can “just talk to”
and would be eager to expand
their numbers and types of ac
quaintances. With a living sys
tem of closely related activities
and integrated dining, people
will be evaluated on the basis of
their personal qualities; friend
ships will come to be founded on
a less superficial level.
I hope that the administration
will be open-minded enough to
give this idea a fair trial period,
sarting next fall, for the sake of
improved social and intellectual
relationships on the Stanford
campus.

/ CLARIFICATION
Editor, The Daily:
I must sympathize with Mr.
Berry’s desire to see some action
on the part of the administration
concerning the possibility of co-ed
housing next fall. This is an idea
which has provoked much dis
cussion among Stanford students,
and if the published reaction in
Roble, Stern, Florence Moore, and
Brannor is any indication, it has
widespread support.
However I would like to clarify
a point which might be miscon
strued. Co-ed Housing was inves
tigated and enthusiastically ac
cepted by a committe of inter
ested students who made the in
itial research of the plan on its
own merits. It was considered

that this arrangement of co-ed
dormitory residence living could
make a positive contribution to j
the intellectual and social life on
this campus by helping to resolve |
the unnatural separation of social ;
and intellectual exchange, which
is fostered by a social system that
restricts meeting of the opposite
sex to a purely dating or even
courting basis. A more relaxed I
opportunity to meet and to know j
in depth people, as people, is
surely needed and would surely be |
welcome at Stanford.
The proposed site for this ex- 1
periment was also chosen strictly
for potential as a possible co-ed |
dorm. Recommendations from the j
13 colleges with co-ed housing all
indicated that the ideal conditions
were fulfilled by having separate ;
dormitories of modest size for
the men and women with com- i
mon dining facilities. Such facili- j
ties exist at Wilbur, Stern, La
gunita and Flo Mo. Stern, how-1
ever has a threefold advantage in
its physical plant. It does have |
individual dining rooms for in
formal intimate dining; it has up- i
stairs sitting rooms for such “seg- j
regated” activities as corridor
meetings; Stern also has the abil
ity to juggle the number of stu
dents (transfer and entering j
freshmen) to make the spaces)
available for the women. Al-;
though it would be relatively easy |
and inexpensive to convert Stern |
for women’s housing it is under- 1
slandahle that the administration
must look carefully at the pro
posal and for student support in
its favor.
Thus with action in mind, mem
bers of the ASSU committee and
interested students have drawn j
up a questionnaire which will be
distributed to all the women on
campus. If there is real student j
support of this plan, the question
naire will serve to show the ad
ministration its strength and ex
tent.
