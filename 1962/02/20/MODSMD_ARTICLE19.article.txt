# Stanford Ruggers Blank Olympic Club on Lindskog's Kicks for 12th Straight Victory
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford’s varsity rugby team
remained undefeated on the sea
son by turning back a good San
Francisco Olympic Club team,
8-0, on the Golden Gate Park
Polo Fields last Saturday.
The win upped the Indians’ win
loss mark to 5-0 and was their
second win over the San Francis
co squad this season. Stanford
has not lost to the “O” Club since
early in 1960 and has now won 12
in a row since losing to Cal mid
way through last season.
Coach Pete Kmetovic’s team
was blessed with good weather
and a dry field for the match,
which was surprising since there
was some question whether or
not a field dry enough to play on
could be found.
STAN IJNDSKOO scored first
for the Card ruggers on a 30-yard
penalty kick about 10 minutes
into the first half to send Stan
ford into an early 3-0 lead.
There was no more scoring be
fore the intermission whistle. Al
though the Indians had two more
opportunities for penalty kicks,
they could convert neither one
into a score.
Second ranker Dick Leeuwen
berg made sure the home team
didn’t get onto the scoreboard in
the first half when he nailed a
swift Winged “O” back on his
way to a try just before the peri
od ended.
STANFORD GOT the last score
of the day a third of the way

through the second half on a long
passing rush play. Dick Shaw
picked up the ball and took off
downfield for 30 yards.

I Surrounded by hostile Olym
! plans, Shaw lateralled off to Tim
I Hansel who passed off in turn to
A1 Hildebrand. The pigskin was
too hot for Hildebrand, so he
tossed over to John Thomas, who
scampered over the goal and
| downed the ball under the goal
I posts for the try.
Lindskog unerringly kicked the
i conversion to give the Tribe its
i final 8-0 winning margin.
KMETOVICJ WAS generally
I pleased with the play of his

charges, praising the efforts of
Randy Vahan along with those of
Thomas and Leeuwenberg in the
scrum.
Also drawing plaudits from the
coach for their backfield play
were Hal Steuber and Shaw.
The Stanford mentor did men
tion, however, that the Indians
were doing too much kicking and
not enough running, thus hamp
ering their scoring game.
The game Saturday was a case
in point, as the Tribe constantly
kept the pressure up on the Olym
pic Club but had difficulty turn
ing their efforts into points.
In a junior varsity preliminary
match, the Stanford JV’s wallop
ed the OC “A" squad by a 19-6
bulge.
URIC SMITH with two tries
and Ron Abelmann with a penal
ty kick and a conversion topped
the Card scorers.
Other scores were turned in by
Henry McQueen (try), Mike Me-
Cardie (try) and Don Haider
(conversion).
Next week the Stanford rugby
team returns to action with a

meet against the Universities
Club of Berkeley. Made up pri
marily of ex-Cal ruggers, the Uni
versities Club is one of the top
area teams and defeated St.
Mary’s by 18-6 Saturday.

Stanford’s varsity rugby team
remained undefeated on the sea
son by turning back a good San
Francisco Olympic Club team,
8-0, on the Golden Gate Park
Polo Fields last Saturday.
The win upped the Indians’ win
loss mark to 5-0 and was their
second win over the San Francis
co squad this season. Stanford
has not lost to the “O” Club since
early in 1960 and has now won 12
in a row since losing to Cal mid
way through last season.
Coach Pete Kmetovic’s team
was blessed with good weather
and a dry field for the match,
which was surprising since there
was some question whether or
not a field dry enough to play on
could be found.
STAN IJNDSKOO scored first
for the Card ruggers on a 30-yard
penalty kick about 10 minutes
into the first half to send Stan
ford into an early 3-0 lead.
There was no more scoring be
fore the intermission whistle. Al
though the Indians had two more
opportunities for penalty kicks,
they could convert neither one
into a score.
Second ranker Dick Leeuwen
berg made sure the home team
didn’t get onto the scoreboard in
the first half when he nailed a
swift Winged “O” back on his
way to a try just before the peri
od ended.
STANFORD GOT the last score
of the day a third of the way

through the second half on a long
passing rush play. Dick Shaw
picked up the ball and took off
downfield for 30 yards.
