temporary opera by Luigi Dalla
piccola in Dinkelspiel Auditorium

flight, and a wireless operator
gives the account of the missing
pilot’s crash in the dramatic
scene, set in the airline’s office.

and in over 70 performances of
14 major roles in the Amato Opera
and in the New Orleans Opera. Ho

Francisco Opera this spring.

soloist at the Vancouver Inter
national Festival in 1959. He
