# Prof. Sanford Releases Study on 'The American College'
## 
### 
Editor’s Note: As part of the
Student-Faculty Board authors'
scries. Prof. Sanford will host a
fireside tomorrow night at 7:30 in
Muir Lounge dealing with the
general topic of his volume. The
program is open to students and
faculty. Sign-ups are being taken
now in the ASSU office.)
“The trouble with students, the
saying goes, is that they turn into
alumni. Indeed, a close look at
college-educated people in the
U.S. is enough to dispel any no
tion that our institutions of high
er learning are doing a good job
of liberal education.”
With this indictment, Prof. No
vitt Sanford of Stanford opens a
thousand-page study of “The
American College,” the work of
30 leading interpreters of the edu
cation process.
Sponsored by the Society for
the Psychological Study of Social
Issues, the book was published
in January by John Wiley & Sons.

“THE FAILURES and short
comings of the colleges seem to
be not at all discouraging to the
general public,” Sanford com
ments. “It is a remarkable fact
that a culture that places relative
ly little value upon learning or
the intellectual life . , . neverthe
less regards college—the experi
ence of college for young people
—as one of the greatest goods,
virtually as one of the necessities
of life.”
“If the general public has little
interest in improving the colleges,
it must be said that many of the
colleges themselves seem to have
hut little more.
“To understand the attitudes of
the colleges, it is necessary to con
sider that they are in an impor
tant sense corporate enterprises.
Much of their activity has to he
devoted to surviving, expanding,
maintaining a strong position
relative to other institutions. To
a very considerable extent, this
holds for slate institutions as well

as private ones.
“THE ORDINARY private col
lege or smaller state institution
has a hard time rising above the
level of value and taste that pre
vails in its immediate community.
It often has to come to terms
with the demands of large donors
or the state legislature.
“It is the college faculties who
will have to take the major re
sponsibility for the needed re
form. The burden of carrying out
educational policies rests mainly
upon them and, as professionals,
they have the right to a major
voice in determining these poli
cies.
“In order to resist pressures
from outside, as well as to further
their most immediate interests,
faculties have fostered an ingroup
spirit, built up tx-aditions of fac
ulty prei’ogatives, installed the
machinery of campus democ
racy.”
COLLEGES SERVE as mam
moth personnel offices for busi

ness and the professions, as vast
WPA projects for students and
faculty, and as powerful pace set
ters for a fast growing national
elite, according to Harvard Uni
versity sociologist David Rcisman
and Christopher Jencks, former
editor of The Harvard Crimson,
whose views are also included in
Sanford’s study.
“But beyond the more or less
rational considerations, the Amer
ican college exists as a vast WPA
project, which gives promising
adolescents work to do while
keeping them out of the job mar
ket and also keeping several hun
dred thousand faculty members
off the streets,” Reisman and
Jencks add.

“What a college does is to
‘nationalize’ the student, taking
him out of his ethnic, I’eligious,
geographic and social parishes,
and exposing him to a more cos
mopolitan world in which the
imagination is less restricted by
pi’econception and ignorance.

“Even in the worst colleges,
emancipation from the older gen
eration can bo stimulating. Many
of the Negro colleges from which
lunch-counter sit-ins were begun
were institutions of low stand
ards, which offered little to their
students other than an opportuni
ty to enter a sector of the ‘black
bourgeoisie’ sheltered behind the
wall of segregation.”
PSYCHOLOGICALLY, the col
lege freshman resembles an au
thoritarian adult. Sanford be
lieves,
“The freshman inhibits im
pulse by being morally strict w’ith
himself and others. He is ready
to meet stiff requirements, to
work hard, to conform with what
he takes to be the prevailing
standards of behavior—and he is
inclined to be somewhat intoler
ant of those who do not.
“An element of perfectionism,
of striving for purity of thought
and action is characteristic of the
freshman.
