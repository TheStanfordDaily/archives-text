# Rocket, Weather Ready for Orbital Try This Morning
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL (UPI) -
Everything was “go” today for a
launching within the next few
hours that could make John
Glenn the first American to
achieve earth-orbital flight.
“It looks good.” a Project Mer
cury spokesman said after a
check of the weather downrange
and a look at the shifting cloud
cover over the cape. The final
stages of launch preparations
were in progress, raising hopes
that Glenn’s much-delayed take
off could come between 4:30 a.m.
and 9:30 a.m.
THE FINAL countdown for
Glenn's Atlas rocket and bell
shaped Mercury space capsule
started at 8:30 last night—9o min
utes earlier than in previous at
tempts. This &ave scientists ex
tra “built in” time during which
constant checks could be made on
tricky weather conditions before
Glenn entered the capsule.
This did away with the need
for a midnight weather survey to
decide whether the countdown
should be started. It also allowed
scientists plenty of time to keep
a close watch-on high, hazy cloud
conditions over the cape launch
ing area which could possibly in
terfere with live camera coverage
of the take-off.
The federal space agency said
fate shifted in favor of the per
severing when storms
abated in the Atlantic recovery
areas where :,he was scheduled to
return to eaiHh after a one-, two-,
of three-orbii flight.
THE ONIV apparent dark spot
was a prediction of broken cloudi
ness for the Cape Canaveral
launch area during at least part
of the five hours between 4:30
a.m. and 9:30 a.m., in which
Glenn’s 10-story space vehicle can
be launched.
Roughly 24 hours before the
scheduled take-off, Lt. Col. John
A. Shorty Powers, astronaut
spokesman, said the odds ap
peared to be 60-40 in our favor.”
He quoted Ernest Amman,
weather forecaster for the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad

ministration (NASA), as being “a
little more optimistic.” Amman
usually is pretty cautious, Powers
said, and when he grows optimis
tic, “I can’t help but tilt the scales
in our favor.”
THE PRE-FLIGHT schedule
called for a final midnight check
of the weather, after which Proj
ect Mercury officials would give
the 40-year-old astronaut a “go”
or “no-go” order.
Ten times since last December
the red-haired Marine officer has
been thwarted in his effort to be
come the first American in orbit.
Weather was the culprit most of
the time, but there also was some
trouble with his bell-shaped space
capsule and Atlas rocket booster.
Glenn’s spacecroft checked out
perfectly during last week’s
launching attempts that were
blocked by Atlantic storms.
Sunday, technicians poured 120
tons of high grade kerosene into
the huge Atlas roeket. It is mixed
with substantially less liquid oxy
gen to form the fuel that powers
the astronaut’s capsule to orbital
speed of about 17,500 miles an
hour.

hours that could make John
Glenn the first American to
achieve earth-orbital flight.
“It looks good.” a Project Mer
cury spokesman said after a
check of the weather downrange
and a look at the shifting cloud
cover over the cape. The final
stages of launch preparations
were in progress, raising hopes
that Glenn’s much-delayed take
off could come between 4:30 a.m.
and 9:30 a.m.
THE FINAL countdown for
Glenn's Atlas rocket and bell
shaped Mercury space capsule
started at 8:30 last night—9o min
utes earlier than in previous at
tempts. This &ave scientists ex
tra “built in” time during which
constant checks could be made on
tricky weather conditions before
Glenn entered the capsule.
This did away with the need
for a midnight weather survey to
decide whether the countdown
should be started. It also allowed
scientists plenty of time to keep
a close watch-on high, hazy cloud
conditions over the cape launch
ing area which could possibly in
terfere with live camera coverage
of the take-off.
The federal space agency said
fate shifted in favor of the per
severing when storms
abated in the Atlantic recovery
areas where :,he was scheduled to
return to eaiHh after a one-, two-,
of three-orbii flight.
THE ONIV apparent dark spot
was a prediction of broken cloudi
ness for the Cape Canaveral
launch area during at least part
of the five hours between 4:30
a.m. and 9:30 a.m., in which
Glenn’s 10-story space vehicle can
be launched.
Roughly 24 hours before the
scheduled take-off, Lt. Col. John
A. Shorty Powers, astronaut
spokesman, said the odds ap
peared to be 60-40 in our favor.”
He quoted Ernest Amman,
weather forecaster for the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad

ministration (NASA), as being “a
little more optimistic.” Amman
usually is pretty cautious, Powers
said, and when he grows optimis
tic, “I can’t help but tilt the scales
in our favor.”
THE PRE-FLIGHT schedule
called for a final midnight check
of the weather, after which Proj
ect Mercury officials would give
the 40-year-old astronaut a “go”
or “no-go” order.
Ten times since last December
the red-haired Marine officer has
been thwarted in his effort to be
come the first American in orbit.
Weather was the culprit most of
the time, but there also was some
trouble with his bell-shaped space
capsule and Atlas rocket booster.
Glenn’s spacecroft checked out
perfectly during last week’s
launching attempts that were
blocked by Atlantic storms.
Sunday, technicians poured 120
tons of high grade kerosene into
the huge Atlas roeket. It is mixed
with substantially less liquid oxy
gen to form the fuel that powers
the astronaut’s capsule to orbital
speed of about 17,500 miles an
hour.
