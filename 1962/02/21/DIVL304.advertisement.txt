Historical fact of
the century, George
Wa, did not toss a
dollar across the
Delaware. No sir,
he booted it (the
fact is that under
those rags that his
men were wearing—
that was a stunt by
the P.R. man for the
folks at home—were
loafers) and that’s
really how football
started. R/A loafers
are from 14.95.
