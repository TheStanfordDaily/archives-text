Even in a University
It is not always easy to get the word from "the horses mouth.”
Too often we are solely dependent on the saturation effect of the conven
tional mass media. There we ore told what others think, and what we should
think, by self appointed guardians who influence or control major parts of the
piess, radio and T.V.
Perhaps you will recall the open letter which appeared in the New York
Times as a paid ad last November; it was signed by 183 faculty members of
some major Eastern Universities. The letter was critical of the Civil Defense
fallout shelter proposals. Later it appeared nationally as an ad in other papers
signed in each region by faculty members of regional schools. Thus 500 Bay
Area people, including some Stanford professors, signed the ad that appeared
in San Francisco papers on December 1, 1961.
The Eastern group, in reporting their experience had this to say— . . . at
the time we published our letter we really thought we were a voice in the
wilderness. From reading the popular press, from listening to radio or watching
television, from attending local civil defense meetings, one gets the impression
that almost everyone is in favor of the present shelter program. Now we no
longer'think that is true. . .
How can you search for what is true? Sometimes by daring to speak up
critically as these faculty people did. But also by reading the unpopular press”
periodicals, books and pamphlets not part of the mass scene.
At KEPLEH’S one function we try to fill in this community is that of making
available direct sources —what the different horses have to say for themselves.
Thus you'll find here the views of Communists, socialists (both Marxist and
democratic), conservatives, know nothings, humanists, pacifists, libertarians,
semanticists, scientists, etc.
Among reprints, books and pamphlets of current interest are:
“The American Ultras,” a critical study of the radical right.
“Shelters and Survival,” a report on the civil defense muddle reprinted by
The New Republic.”
“U.S. Foreign Policy and the Soviet Union,” from the Cenier for the Study of
Democratic Institution.
“Soviet Communism: Programs ind Rules,” official texts edited by Jan F. Triska
of Stanford,
‘‘Mao Tae-Tung —On the Rectification of Incorrect Ideas in the Party,” and
other writings of Chinese Communists.
“You Can Trust the Communists,” Dr. Fred Schwarz s textbook.
‘Disturber of the Peace,” a reprint from Mademoiselle” of an interview with
Robert Pickus of Acts for Peace, a Northern California peace effort.
