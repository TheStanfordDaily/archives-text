# Committee Proposes Student Activity in Campus Administration
## 
### JOHN STEINBRUNER 
(Editor’s Note: This is the second of three
articles on the proposals submitted to EASSU
by the special committee on the new consti
tution and the philosophy behind them.)

It is my sincere belief that students should
concern themselves with those issues of the
University, the nation, and the world which
affect student life, and I believe that an
effective student government is necessary
in accomplishing this.
In view of our responsibilities to the
issues affecting students on an international
and national level, the new constitution
makes provision for the associated students
of Stanford to affiliate with the United
States National Student Association (NSA)
and it further provides for an appointed stu
dent officer to administer the affairs of the
NSA and to publicize its policies and ac
tivities.

In order to present the considerations be
hind this proposal it is necessary to give a
brief account of what the students of the
world are doing and what relationship the
NSA has to student action both here and

abroad.
Space does not allow a complete account,
so I shall have to be dogmatic and incom
plete for which I apologize in advance.
IN THE CRUCIAL areas of the world,
outside of the U.S., students are frequently
a major political force. Students in Africa
play major roles in the independence move
ments; students in Hungary threw Molotov
cocktails at Russian tanks; students in Japan
forced Eisenhower to cancel his visit; and
students in Latin America and Southeast
Asia make their voices heard in many ways.
Students all over the world are concerned
and active, and the world is an audience to
their views. These students can and do shape
history while at their universities.
In the U.S., students are not as important
a social force but they are still involved in
major issues such as integration, nuclear dis
armament, civil rights, etc. Students at Stan
ford have been neither active nor concerned.
In 1945 the International Union of Stu
dents (IUS) was founded by students ad
hering to the communist ideology, and since
that time it has grown to a major force for
munist youths regularly publish a magazine

the size of "Life” which is read in 12 differ
the advancement of communism. These com
ment in languages throughout the world.
They regularly hold international meet
ings for which they fly in delegates from
Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America
at lUS expense. The Communists talk to
these delegates in their own language, show
that they are concerned with their problems,
offer help of all sorts, and solicit their sup
port against the West. The delegates then
return to their countries to become states
men on the international level.

THESE STUDENTS arc deeply concerned
with the various problems their countries
face, and they are determined to address
themselves to these problems. If we would
not alienate over half of the student world,
we must concern ourselves with the same
problems. Our measures so far—books to
Africa, exchange programs, travel programs
—are but tiny drops in a very large bucket
and cannot substitute for general student
concern.

In 1950 the Coordinating Secretariat for
the International Student Conference
(COSEC) was established by students of the

Western democracies to compete with the
lUS. These students have come together
from widely divergent ideologies and political
viewpoints and have tortuously ground out
stands on issues which vitally concern the
non-committod world.
The United States National Student As
sociation (USNSA or simply NSA) repre
sents the students of American universities
in this organization.
AT ANNUAL CONVENTIONS composed
of delegates from member schools the NSA
addresses itself to the Herculean task of
gathering information on scores of crucial
issues and of establishing policies on these
issues according to the principles of freedom.
It establishes programs of action to im
plement these policies and chooses national
officers to implement the programs. It pe
titions Congress, States, and Universities; it
organizes sit-in demonstrations against seg
regation; it establishes scholarship and ex
change programs; and in short, performs as
an active, responsible student government.
The two main reasons generally forward
ed in opposition to Stanford’s membership
in the NSA are the cost involved and the fact

that the NSA might take stands with which
Stanford disagrees and thus mbroil our
name in some undesirable issue.

TIIK COST of membership in the NSA is
$l5O per year plus the cost of sending up to
10 delegates to the national convention, a
sum which could easily be raised.

The second “criticism” is a true statement
of fact, but is also true of the U.S. govern
ment in relations to the States. No govern
ment operating under democratic principles
ever claims to represent more than the
majority opinion of its constituents and
many of our major universities find it pos
sible to belong to the NSA in spite of the
fact that they must sometimes be on the
minority side of an issue.
At any rate, we believe quite strongly
that Stanford should be in the NSA as an
embodiment of our basic principle staled
above. We wish that those who have serious
objections would air them in order that they
might be answered and that we might get on
with what seems to be a clear obligation, if
not a necessity.

history while at their universities.
In the U.S., students are not as important
a social force but they are still involved in
major issues such as integration, nuclear dis
armament, civil rights, etc. Students at Stan
ford have been neither active nor concerned.
In 1945 the International Union of Stu
dents (IUS) was founded by students ad
hering to the communist ideology, and since
that time it has grown to a major force for
munist youths regularly publish a magazine

the size of "Life” which is read in 12 differ
the advancement of communism. These com
ment in languages throughout the world.
They regularly hold international meet
ings for which they fly in delegates from
Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America
at lUS expense. The Communists talk to
these delegates in their own language, show
that they are concerned with their problems,
offer help of all sorts, and solicit their sup
port against the West. The delegates then
return to their countries to become states
men on the international level.

THESE STUDENTS arc deeply concerned
with the various problems their countries
face, and they are determined to address
themselves to these problems. If we would
not alienate over half of the student world,
we must concern ourselves with the same
problems. Our measures so far—books to
Africa, exchange programs, travel programs
—are but tiny drops in a very large bucket
and cannot substitute for general student
concern.

In 1950 the Coordinating Secretariat for
the International Student Conference
(COSEC) was established by students of the

Western democracies to compete with the
lUS. These students have come together
from widely divergent ideologies and political
viewpoints and have tortuously ground out
stands on issues which vitally concern the
non-committod world.
The United States National Student As
sociation (USNSA or simply NSA) repre
sents the students of American universities
in this organization.
AT ANNUAL CONVENTIONS composed
of delegates from member schools the NSA
addresses itself to the Herculean task of
gathering information on scores of crucial
issues and of establishing policies on these
issues according to the principles of freedom.
It establishes programs of action to im
plement these policies and chooses national
officers to implement the programs. It pe
titions Congress, States, and Universities; it
organizes sit-in demonstrations against seg
regation; it establishes scholarship and ex
change programs; and in short, performs as
an active, responsible student government.
The two main reasons generally forward
ed in opposition to Stanford’s membership
in the NSA are the cost involved and the fact

that the NSA might take stands with which
Stanford disagrees and thus mbroil our
name in some undesirable issue.

TIIK COST of membership in the NSA is
$l5O per year plus the cost of sending up to
10 delegates to the national convention, a
sum which could easily be raised.

The second “criticism” is a true statement
of fact, but is also true of the U.S. govern
ment in relations to the States. No govern
ment operating under democratic principles
ever claims to represent more than the
majority opinion of its constituents and
many of our major universities find it pos
sible to belong to the NSA in spite of the
fact that they must sometimes be on the
minority side of an issue.
At any rate, we believe quite strongly
that Stanford should be in the NSA as an
embodiment of our basic principle staled
above. We wish that those who have serious
objections would air them in order that they
might be answered and that we might get on
with what seems to be a clear obligation, if
not a necessity.

It is my sincere belief that students should
concern themselves with those issues of the
University, the nation, and the world which
affect student life, and I believe that an
effective student government is necessary
in accomplishing this.
In view of our responsibilities to the
issues affecting students on an international
and national level, the new constitution
makes provision for the associated students
of Stanford to affiliate with the United
States National Student Association (NSA)
and it further provides for an appointed stu
dent officer to administer the affairs of the
NSA and to publicize its policies and ac
tivities.

In order to present the considerations be
hind this proposal it is necessary to give a
brief account of what the students of the
world are doing and what relationship the
NSA has to student action both here and

abroad.
Space does not allow a complete account,
so I shall have to be dogmatic and incom
plete for which I apologize in advance.

outside of the U.S., students are frequently

from widely divergent ideologies and political
viewpoints and have tortuously ground out
stands on issues which vitally concern the
non-committod world.
The United States National Student As
sociation (USNSA or simply NSA) repre
sents the students of American universities
in this organization.
AT ANNUAL CONVENTIONS composed
of delegates from member schools the NSA
addresses itself to the Herculean task of
gathering information on scores of crucial
issues and of establishing policies on these
issues according to the principles of freedom.
It establishes programs of action to im
plement these policies and chooses national
officers to implement the programs. It pe
titions Congress, States, and Universities; it
organizes sit-in demonstrations against seg
regation; it establishes scholarship and ex
change programs; and in short, performs as
an active, responsible student government.
The two main reasons generally forward
ed in opposition to Stanford’s membership
in the NSA are the cost involved and the fact

that the NSA might take stands with which
Stanford disagrees and thus mbroil our
name in some undesirable issue.

TIIK COST of membership in the NSA is
$l5O per year plus the cost of sending up to
10 delegates to the national convention, a
sum which could easily be raised.

The second “criticism” is a true statement
of fact, but is also true of the U.S. govern
ment in relations to the States. No govern
ment operating under democratic principles
ever claims to represent more than the
majority opinion of its constituents and
many of our major universities find it pos
sible to belong to the NSA in spite of the
fact that they must sometimes be on the
minority side of an issue.
At any rate, we believe quite strongly
that Stanford should be in the NSA as an
embodiment of our basic principle staled
above. We wish that those who have serious
objections would air them in order that they
might be answered and that we might get on
with what seems to be a clear obligation, if
not a necessity.

(Editor’s Note: This is the second of three
articles on the proposals submitted to EASSU
by the special committee on the new consti
tution and the philosophy behind them.)

It is my sincere belief that students should
concern themselves with those issues of the
University, the nation, and the world which
affect student life, and I believe that an
effective student government is necessary
in accomplishing this.
In view of our responsibilities to the
issues affecting students on an international
and national level, the new constitution
makes provision for the associated students
of Stanford to affiliate with the United
States National Student Association (NSA)
and it further provides for an appointed stu
dent officer to administer the affairs of the
NSA and to publicize its policies and ac
tivities.

In order to present the considerations be
hind this proposal it is necessary to give a
brief account of what the students of the
world are doing and what relationship the
NSA has to student action both here and

abroad.
Space does not allow a complete account,
so I shall have to be dogmatic and incom
plete for which I apologize in advance.
IN THE CRUCIAL areas of the world,
outside of the U.S., students are frequently
a major political force. Students in Africa
play major roles in the independence move
ments; students in Hungary threw Molotov
cocktails at Russian tanks; students in Japan
forced Eisenhower to cancel his visit; and
students in Latin America and Southeast
Asia make their voices heard in many ways.
Students all over the world are concerned
and active, and the world is an audience to
their views. These students can and do shape
history while at their universities.
In the U.S., students are not as important
a social force but they are still involved in
major issues such as integration, nuclear dis
armament, civil rights, etc. Students at Stan
ford have been neither active nor concerned.
In 1945 the International Union of Stu
dents (IUS) was founded by students ad
hering to the communist ideology, and since
that time it has grown to a major force for
munist youths regularly publish a magazine

the size of "Life” which is read in 12 differ
the advancement of communism. These com
ment in languages throughout the world.
They regularly hold international meet
ings for which they fly in delegates from
Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America
at lUS expense. The Communists talk to
these delegates in their own language, show
that they are concerned with their problems,
offer help of all sorts, and solicit their sup
port against the West. The delegates then
return to their countries to become states
men on the international level.

THESE STUDENTS arc deeply concerned
with the various problems their countries
face, and they are determined to address
themselves to these problems. If we would
not alienate over half of the student world,
we must concern ourselves with the same
problems. Our measures so far—books to
Africa, exchange programs, travel programs
—are but tiny drops in a very large bucket
and cannot substitute for general student
concern.

In 1950 the Coordinating Secretariat for
the International Student Conference
(COSEC) was established by students of the

Western democracies to compete with the
lUS. These students have come together
from widely divergent ideologies and political
viewpoints and have tortuously ground out
stands on issues which vitally concern the
