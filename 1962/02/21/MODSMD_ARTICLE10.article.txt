In response to a request from
President Tubman of Liberia, a
Peace Corps educational project
is being set up in Liberia. About
70 Peace Corps Volunteers are
scheduled to begin teaching in
Liberian secondary schools in Sep
tember.

Volunteers will help staff new
schools which Liberia is now
building under a program assist
ed by the agency for International
Development. Teachers are need
ed at the junior and senior high
school levels and for teacher
training schools.

Volunteers will be under the
supervision of the Liberian De
partment of Education and local
school officials. They will teach
a full schedule of courses and
participate in after-school activi
ties. Most will be located in urban
areas, probably two volunters as
signed to each school.
