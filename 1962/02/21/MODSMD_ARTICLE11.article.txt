“A THURBER CARNIVAL,” 16 sketches based on the hilarious stories
of the late James Thurber, will be performed tomorrow evening at
Memorial Auditorium starting at 8:30 p.m. Imogene Coca, Sid Cae
sar's former partner on T.V., Arthur Treacher and King Donovan, plus
a cast of other sardonic funsters, star in the Carnival, which won
from Broadway critic Walter Kerr the praise, "completely captivat
ing." Included in the sketches are such Thurber favorites as "The
Last Flower," "The Unicorn in the Garden," "The Secret Life of Walter
Mitty," and "The Night the Bed Fell on Father." Numerous Thurber
dogs will also cavort. Tickets are on sale now at the Mem Aud Box
Office.
