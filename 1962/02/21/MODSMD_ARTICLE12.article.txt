## World Acclaims Glenn's Victory in Space

CAPE CANAVERAL (UPI)
John H. Glenn Jr. blazed a three
orbit American spaceway around
the earth yesterday, splashed tri
umphantly down in the Atlantic
near recovery forces and popped
from his space capsule declaring
he was in excellent condition.
To the acclaim of his elated
countrymen, the 40-year-old astro
naut was plucked from the sea by
a crane on the destroyer Noa, one
of the recovery ships waiting to
rescue him. He landed only six
miles from the vessel.

“My condition is excellent." the
freckled - faced Marine reported
even before he climbed from his
cramped capsule on the destroy
er’s deck. That was the message
he had sent back x - epeatedly all
during his 4 hour and 56 minute
record smashing free world flight.
WITH A NEAR perfect flight

marked only by minor difficulties,
Glenn pushed the U.S. space pro
gram ahead with a mighty leap
that will see perhaps a manned
orbital flight every two months
the rest of this year preparatory
to longer orbital flights and
flights to the moon and planets.
Scarcely had Glenn emerged
from his capsule than President
Kennedy expressed the nation’s
“great happiness and thanksgiv
ing” at the red-haired pilot’s suc
cessful orbital flight. Speaking
from the White House lawn, the
President said:
“THIS IS THE NEW ocean
space and I believe the United
States must sail on it and be in
a position second to none.”

Glenn Jr. drew cheers around
the world for his history-making
voyage through space.
A French observatory spokes
man summed up general Western
European feeling when he called
Glenn’s trip into space “a great
step forward for the whole
world.” West German Chancellor
Konrad Adenauer said it was “a
great deed.”

“Good luck to him,” Moscow
citizens told United Press Inter
national. “He’s a brave man,”
said one Moscow office worker.

cramped capsule on the destroy
er’s deck. That was the message
he had sent back x - epeatedly all
during his 4 hour and 56 minute
record smashing free world flight.
WITH A NEAR perfect flight

marked only by minor difficulties,
Glenn pushed the U.S. space pro
gram ahead with a mighty leap
that will see perhaps a manned
orbital flight every two months
the rest of this year preparatory
to longer orbital flights and
flights to the moon and planets.
Scarcely had Glenn emerged
from his capsule than President
Kennedy expressed the nation’s
“great happiness and thanksgiv
ing” at the red-haired pilot’s suc
cessful orbital flight. Speaking
from the White House lawn, the
President said:
“THIS IS THE NEW ocean
space and I believe the United
States must sail on it and be in
a position second to none.”

Glenn Jr. drew cheers around
the world for his history-making
voyage through space.
A French observatory spokes
man summed up general Western
European feeling when he called
Glenn’s trip into space “a great
step forward for the whole
world.” West German Chancellor
Konrad Adenauer said it was “a
great deed.”

“Good luck to him,” Moscow
citizens told United Press Inter
national. “He’s a brave man,”
said one Moscow office worker.
