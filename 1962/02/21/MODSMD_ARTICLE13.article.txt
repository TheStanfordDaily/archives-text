## Davidson's Article Had 'Lack of Information' 
### RICHARD MULLER 
Chairman, LASSf Committee on
Undergraduate Housing
I wish to clear up some misun
derstanding caused by Sue David
son’s article in yesterday’s Daily
about the LASSF Committee on
Undergraduate Housing.
Although Miss Davidson is a
committee member she did not
attend either of the two meetings
at which coeducational housing
was discussed. Her letter should
not he considered a misrepresen
tation as it has been by some
informed committee members
hut a result of lack of informa
tion.
FIRST, Miss Davidson said the
Committee’s “survey of adminis
trators of schools with coeduca
tional housing was . . . inconclu
sive.” She has read only that part
of the report presented in The
Daily and only some of the let
ters on which it is based. 1 feel
confident that when she reads the
full report, or hears it read at
Legislature tomorrow, her criti
cism will he different and more
soundly based.
Second, yes, the Committee has
gained “several new members”
six, for a total of 34. One is a
member of Legislature. Two will
study on-campus apartment liv
ing. One will lead a subcommittee
to investigate overall housing
policy. Two will assist in our in
vestigation of coed housing. One
of these has attended enough
meetings to vote on this issue.
Others with “outside interest”
who wish to contribute their ef
forts to any aspect of our work
will be given membership.
TlilKI), I flo not feel the objec
tivity of a committee’s study can
be judged by one member’s “para
phrased” statement. I feel a more
appropriate means might be to
attend meetings, or at least talk
with those who have.
Fourth, I would also like to ask
“What’s the rush?” on this coed

housing issue. Stanford has had
coed living at its overseas cam
puses for over three years. Two
high University Committees in
February of 19fi0 jointly recom
mended coed living for Stanford
“at home.”
Stanford administration has al
so decided to build “one cluster
of four units . . . for undergrad
uate men and women, who will
share common dining rooms.”
(The quote is found on page 58
of “A Case For Stanford,” the
PACE book.)
FIFTH, the committee at both
coed discussion meetings did un
dertake “other considerations
such as the desire and ability of
students to live in a coed situa
tion." as Miss Davidson indicated
it should.
Moreover, it had the help of
eight faculty members familiar
with coed housing. Among these
was Dean Robert Sears, a profes
sional psychologist and Dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
After lengthy discussion the
committee and its guests agreed
that Stanford students had the
ability to live in a coed situation.
Student interest in coed living is
being shown in The Daily, dorm
discussion, and in answers to our
questionnaires.
FINALLY, Miss Davidson ques
tioned the motives of the Stern
leaders who want coed housing
to bo instituted in Stern Hall. I
would theorize that their reasons
are as varied as those of the 190
out of 300 girls in Florence Moore
who support them.
Perhaps many feel that the
principle of coed housing is sound
and that Stern would he the best
and most practical of existing
living groups in which it could
be initiated.
Others may feel it would
strengthen the house system
ideal. Others may simply feel
that this system woud make
Stern a more desirable place in
which to live.
