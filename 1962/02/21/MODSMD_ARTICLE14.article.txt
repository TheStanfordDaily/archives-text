THE PUBLIC IMAGE
Editor. The Daily:
In The Daily of Monday, Mr.
Rogers et al. questioned whether
or not the “radical” appearance of
the crowd at the Turn Toward
Peace rally alienated the public
from the cause by its appearance.
The question of where one
must place his highest emphasis
on the transitory public image
of such a group or upon the view
of the individual is quite diffi
cult to resolve. Obviously one
must do some of both. Proclaim
ing “Love thy neighbor” while
parading in one’s birthday suit
usually gains nothing but a stay
in jail.
In the group of 15 to 20 people
who planned and executed the
rally, I can only think of three
boys, two with beards and one
without sox, who were “radical”
in their appearance. The others
came to listen and discuss. These
people were welcome, just as the
hebrephrenic conservatives would
have been, had they anything con
structive to contribute.
If we are to limit our own ap
pearance to gain a favorable

“image,” we must also limit that
of our audience (if this is pos
sible) and thus we begin to sacri
fice the democratic values in
which we believe.
Why not carry the Madison
Avenue approach a step further
and hire a big advertising agency
to promote a “Peace” campaign?
If the “pacifists” could accom
plish disarmament by sue h
means, there is nothing to stop
the “war-lords” from hiring a
rival firm to reverse public opin
ion.
I do not believe that one ever
convinces another of the option
of total non-violence. He must
convince himself, and for the
great majority of western hu
manity, this requires a change in
basic assumptions.
It is much easier (especially in
these times) to convince oneself
of the need for disarmament, at
least at the nuclear level. We
seek to do more than change the
requirements for peace as one
would change his brand of tooth
paste. We seek a world where we
and our children can live free of
the fear of war.

THE PUBLIC IMAGE
Editor. The Daily:
In The Daily of Monday, Mr.
Rogers et al. questioned whether
or not the “radical” appearance of
the crowd at the Turn Toward
Peace rally alienated the public
from the cause by its appearance.
The question of where one
must place his highest emphasis
on the transitory public image
of such a group or upon the view
of the individual is quite diffi
cult to resolve. Obviously one
must do some of both. Proclaim
ing “Love thy neighbor” while
parading in one’s birthday suit
usually gains nothing but a stay
in jail.
In the group of 15 to 20 people
who planned and executed the
rally, I can only think of three
boys, two with beards and one
without sox, who were “radical”
in their appearance. The others
came to listen and discuss. These
people were welcome, just as the
hebrephrenic conservatives would
have been, had they anything con
structive to contribute.
If we are to limit our own ap
pearance to gain a favorable

“image,” we must also limit that
of our audience (if this is pos
sible) and thus we begin to sacri
fice the democratic values in
which we believe.
Why not carry the Madison
Avenue approach a step further
and hire a big advertising agency
to promote a “Peace” campaign?
If the “pacifists” could accom
plish disarmament by sue h
means, there is nothing to stop
the “war-lords” from hiring a
rival firm to reverse public opin
ion.
I do not believe that one ever
convinces another of the option
of total non-violence. He must
convince himself, and for the
great majority of western hu
manity, this requires a change in
basic assumptions.
It is much easier (especially in
these times) to convince oneself
of the need for disarmament, at
least at the nuclear level. We
seek to do more than change the
requirements for peace as one
would change his brand of tooth
paste. We seek a world where we
and our children can live free of
the fear of war.
