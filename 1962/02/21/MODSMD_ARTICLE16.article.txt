By JUDY lIOUT/
A few days ago I visited with
some Peace Corps teachers in a
small town in the Western Re
gion. They live in a comfortable
apartment above a row of small
shops.
The apartment has five rooms,
electricity and running water.
The neighbor on one side as a re
diffusion box which broadcasts
hi-life from 6 a.m. till late in the
night. On the other side of the
house is an open air cinema which
shows popular Indian films sup
plemented by enthusiastic audi
ence participation.
The cries of goats shatter any
remaining stillness in the early
morning.
THE TOWN is a typical one.
The teachers cause great merri
ment among the women in their
yard by cooking and cleaning and
carrying out the garbage them
selves white women are sup
posed to have house hoys.
The living standard of these
girls is what the Peace Corps
promised it would be; they live
among the people at the same
level as a Nigerian teacher. Some
of the Corpsmen live* more com
fortably, others, less so in thatch
roofed houses without electricity,
many yards from the water sup
ply-
All of them work long hours
teaching students for whom Eng
lish is a second language. Not all
of the schools have books and
equipment.
HOW IS their morale? Never
higher. Away from University
College and the strains of being
part of a project of dubious popu
larity they are at last able to be
gin to prove themselves as in
dividuals and teachers. It is on
their personal and professional
merits that the Peace Corps ex
periment depends.
The real obstacles are not dis
ease and discomfort, not physical

ordeals, hut boredom, loneliness
and the thousand and one petty
irritations of daily life. Lack of
privacy, personality conflicts,
feelings of personal inadequacy
and depression: the trials are
nothing dramatic; they are the
same enervating frustrations we
all face but compounded by being
representatives of the United
States.
NOW THAT the renowned
postcard has been established in
the body of “literature that
moved men" and is no longer a
burning issue around Ibadan, I’ve
mellowed and my ideas of the
meaning of the incident have;
changed. The amount of publicity |
it attracted is a tribute to the de-1
gree of preparation and organiza
tion achieved by the students in-1
volved in its exploitation.
Though a trace of resentment j
remains it is very slight and the L
most immediate effect of the epi-1
sode was the dissipation of pro-1
postcard tensions between the |
Peace Corps and the student body. I
One can be sure that this will not |
be the only such incident which j
will involve and injure the Peace j
Corps but the fact that it has hap- j
pened and will happen again
does not necessarily mean the |
project should be abandoned.

SERVICE programs like the
Peace Corps are valuable. In ad
dition to supplying desperately
needed teachers and technicians
they give those who participate,
their families and friends and
all those within their personal
sphere of influence new perspec
tives on personal and national re
sponsibility.
And judging from current U.S.
news, this aspect of it is also of
great importance. Everyone who
considers participating in such a
project, and I think every student
should, must take into account

Die additional problems that rep.
I resenting America and t’.S. for
leign policy entail: regardless of
what it aims to he. the Peace
Corps will always be considered a
political organization in those
countries which receive its aid.
Those who feel they have trou
bles should consider one of the
many private organizations in the
field which present a wide variety
of programs. Those who are in
terested in complete independ
ence from any sort of organiza
tion can try contacting foreign
governments directly.
