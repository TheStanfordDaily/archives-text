## Displaced Person's Almanac' 
### KERRY FELTHAM 
“The Displaced Person’s Al
manac" by John Pairman Brown:
$3.50.
It is comparatively easy for the
average American to ignore the
essentially nasty turns and di
rections taken by Things. If he
docs see them, he is more likely
to acknowledge them; he becomes
flip or wry instead.
“The Displaced Person’s Al
manac” could be just the book to
change his mind. A series of short
essays, each under a sign of the
zodiac, discloses John Pairman
Brown’s discomfiture with or
ganized religion, (he State De
partment. confident living and j
progress.
He pulls references from nearly j
every section of history and liter-’
ature to uncover, to my satisfac-!
(ion, at least, the essentially un- j
noble human being, and from sci
entists from Newton to Wiener to i
show the basic fallacy of the
school of Progress.
The displaced person is diame-1
trically opposed to the Organiza-j
(ion Man and is more nearly a
sixteenth ceVitury pagan (in the j
Brown sense of country dweller) j
who can take the solid and fre
quently funny daily advice of the
r " ~ii

Almanac and use it to his inner
advantage.
The advice given is a curious
combination of well-worded eru
dition and English Vulgate.
Brown says. “Our anthology of
Hebrew literature stands on the
same shelf as Tacitus and Gibbon,
11 he “Bachae” and “Gulliver,” Ca
j tullus and Ezra Pound. If we
| don’t like them, we won't like it.”
jHe quotes a Hollywood madam:
I “I’ve tried it rich and I’ve trier!
iit poor, and believe me, dearie,
j rich is best.”
The last nasty word forward
I thinking people could call Brown
|is flip . . . but he might be a
[ little wry. He is able to catch
[ without cleverness or strident
[voice the picturesque, and appo
site, instance. His earnest genius
[ anrt pretty sense of the incongru
ous have produced an utterly in
| dividual book, a self-conscious ur
bane offering of a lot of tortured
I analysis of the rate of decomposi
tion of things.
Brown’s classical background
| and wry twist have made for a
j hook which should be read word
jby word for the cliches of
thought or language are not
present and then kept on the li
brary shelf to be sampled in short
bits as the inclination strikes.
