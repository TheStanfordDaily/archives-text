# NO ELBOW ROOM
## Walter Lippmann 
### 
The soul-searching which went
on among the Republican orators
on Lincoln’s birthday did not
bring forth that new “image”
which they were all seeking.
Somewhere there is a block. It
prevents the Republican party
from getting to a position which
is both conservative and popular.
The block, I venture to suggest,
is that the Republican position
has been moved so far to the
right that the party has conceded
to the Kennedy administration
not only the left but the whole
vast dominant center.
This has left the Republican
leaders with no elbow room, aad
they are squeezed into a corner
where they can only say no. This
cannot make for popularity and
for votes in a country where the
population is growing prodigious
ly, where the way of life is chang
ing rapidly, where the people,
conscious of the huge productive
capacity of our economy, are de
manding that their crowded life
in the cities bo made more com
fortable and more civilized.
THE DISPLACEMENT of the
Republican leaders from the cen
ter to the right has many causes.
One of them, for example, is the
control of the party organization
by the old codgers, who have safe
seats and keep on being re-elected.
There is another reason which is
that in recent years Republican
doctrine has been shaped by the
orists who arc out of touch with
the modern world. Indeed, it would
not be an exaggeration to say that
it has been shaped by theorists
who do not know what they are
talking about.
These theorists have produced
a formula which discombobulates
Republican thinking. It is that
liberalism and progressivism are
the high road to socialism, and
that socialism is the high road to
communism. The extremists use
the formula to say that the Unit
ed States started down the road
to communism when the income
tax was legalized in 1913. But even
the moderates, Gen. Eisenhower,
for example, are deeply suspici
ous of social security and the
welfare state and of aid to edu
cation, and above all of the mod
ern conception of the compensa
tory economy.
The difficulty about making a
new image is that the Republican
theorists have created such a
false image of the Kennedy Dem
ocratic party that there is no ef
fective way they can oppose it.
Applied to the Kennedy adminis
tration the formula of the the
orists of the right, that progres
sivism loads to socialism and so
cialism to communism, is absurd.
It is silly. Though Mr. Kennedy
is a progressive and a liberal, he

is also a profound conservative,
and only the befuddled theorists
find that strange and hard to un
derstand.
THEIR CENTRAL theme,
which is also a central illusion, is
that this country is “spending”
its way out of freedom into so
cialism and communism. But is
it? I have some figures here
which come from Prof. F. M. Ba
tor, a leading authority on the
problems of government spend
ing.
A big rich country spends
more, of course, than a small
poor) country. The proper basis of
comparison, therefore, is the vol
ume of government spending
against the size of the economy.
Prof. Bator’s figures show that
government spending in the Unit
ed States is not out of line with
spending in other advanced indus
trial nations.
1959 is the most recent year for
which adequate comparative fig
ures are available. In that year in
the United States total public
spending (Federal, state, local)
, was 28.3 per cent of the gross na
tional product. As this includes
national defense, public education,
, highways, police, hospitals, and
what not, can it really be said
, that spending less than 30 per
cent publicly puts us on the road
; to, or anywhere near the road to,
socialism and communism? Can
it really bo said when of this 30
per cent which is spent publicly
; over half goes to purchases from
private firms producing for prof
' it?

AS A MATTKK of fact, in pub
lic spending we arc behind Bel
1 gium (29.3 per cent), Canada (30
; per cent), France (33.5 per cent),
: United Kingdom (34.9 per cent),
■ Sweden (35.7 per cent). In West
I Germany the latest figures are
i for 1957. That was before the big
• rise of Gorman defense spending
- and at that time the percentage
I of public spending was slightly
' bigger than ours (28.6 per cent),
i Yet West Germany is regarded
, by many as the shining example
- of a free capitalistic economy.
1 But, it will be said, while de
- fense spending is necessary, the
- real creeping socialism is the
- money spent for social security,
veterans’ benefits, government in
i terest, and cash subsidies. For the
i United States the ratio of such
i payments to gross national pro
- duct was 7 per cent in 1959. The
-1 Canadian ratio was 8.7 per cent.
. | The United Kingdom’s ratio was
-! 11.2 per cent. The West German
-1 fin 1957) was 12.1 per cent, the
- i Belgian 13.6 per cent, the French
- j 16.5 per cent.
There are other comparative
r | figures which could be cited. All
j 1 of them point to the conclusion

that as compared with the ad
vanced industrial nations of the
world the ratio of our public
spending is conservative. There
is no hard factual basis for the
theory that we have turned our
back on the free economy and are
on the high road to socialism and
communism.
The latter day Republican prop
aganda does not work for the
very simple reason that it is not
true.

orists of the right, that progres
sivism loads to socialism and so
cialism to communism, is absurd.
It is silly. Though Mr. Kennedy
is a progressive and a liberal, he

is also a profound conservative,
and only the befuddled theorists
find that strange and hard to un
derstand.
THEIR CENTRAL theme,
which is also a central illusion, is
that this country is “spending”
its way out of freedom into so
cialism and communism. But is
it? I have some figures here
which come from Prof. F. M. Ba
tor, a leading authority on the
problems of government spend
ing.
A big rich country spends
more, of course, than a small
poor) country. The proper basis of
comparison, therefore, is the vol
ume of government spending
against the size of the economy.
Prof. Bator’s figures show that
government spending in the Unit
ed States is not out of line with
spending in other advanced indus
trial nations.
1959 is the most recent year for
which adequate comparative fig
ures are available. In that year in
the United States total public
spending (Federal, state, local)
, was 28.3 per cent of the gross na
tional product. As this includes
national defense, public education,
, highways, police, hospitals, and
what not, can it really be said
, that spending less than 30 per
cent publicly puts us on the road
; to, or anywhere near the road to,
socialism and communism? Can
it really bo said when of this 30
per cent which is spent publicly
; over half goes to purchases from
private firms producing for prof
' it?

AS A MATTKK of fact, in pub
lic spending we arc behind Bel
1 gium (29.3 per cent), Canada (30
; per cent), France (33.5 per cent),
: United Kingdom (34.9 per cent),
■ Sweden (35.7 per cent). In West
I Germany the latest figures are
i for 1957. That was before the big
• rise of Gorman defense spending
- and at that time the percentage
I of public spending was slightly
' bigger than ours (28.6 per cent),
i Yet West Germany is regarded
, by many as the shining example
- of a free capitalistic economy.
1 But, it will be said, while de
- fense spending is necessary, the
- real creeping socialism is the
- money spent for social security,
veterans’ benefits, government in
i terest, and cash subsidies. For the
i United States the ratio of such
i payments to gross national pro
- duct was 7 per cent in 1959. The
-1 Canadian ratio was 8.7 per cent.
. | The United Kingdom’s ratio was
-! 11.2 per cent. The West German
-1 fin 1957) was 12.1 per cent, the
- i Belgian 13.6 per cent, the French
- j 16.5 per cent.
There are other comparative
r | figures which could be cited. All
j 1 of them point to the conclusion

that as compared with the ad
vanced industrial nations of the
world the ratio of our public
spending is conservative. There
is no hard factual basis for the
theory that we have turned our
back on the free economy and are
on the high road to socialism and
communism.
The latter day Republican prop
aganda does not work for the
very simple reason that it is not
true.
The soul-searching which went
on among the Republican orators
on Lincoln’s birthday did not
bring forth that new “image”
which they were all seeking.
Somewhere there is a block. It
prevents the Republican party
from getting to a position which
is both conservative and popular.
The block, I venture to suggest,
is that the Republican position
has been moved so far to the
right that the party has conceded
to the Kennedy administration
not only the left but the whole
vast dominant center.
This has left the Republican
leaders with no elbow room, aad
they are squeezed into a corner
where they can only say no. This
cannot make for popularity and
for votes in a country where the
population is growing prodigious
ly, where the way of life is chang
ing rapidly, where the people,
conscious of the huge productive
capacity of our economy, are de
manding that their crowded life
in the cities bo made more com
fortable and more civilized.
THE DISPLACEMENT of the
Republican leaders from the cen
ter to the right has many causes.
One of them, for example, is the
control of the party organization
by the old codgers, who have safe
seats and keep on being re-elected.
There is another reason which is
that in recent years Republican
doctrine has been shaped by the
orists who arc out of touch with
the modern world. Indeed, it would
not be an exaggeration to say that
it has been shaped by theorists
who do not know what they are
talking about.
These theorists have produced
a formula which discombobulates
Republican thinking. It is that
liberalism and progressivism are
the high road to socialism, and
that socialism is the high road to
communism. The extremists use
the formula to say that the Unit
ed States started down the road
to communism when the income
tax was legalized in 1913. But even
the moderates, Gen. Eisenhower,
for example, are deeply suspici
ous of social security and the
welfare state and of aid to edu
cation, and above all of the mod
ern conception of the compensa
tory economy.
The difficulty about making a
new image is that the Republican
theorists have created such a
false image of the Kennedy Dem
ocratic party that there is no ef

There are other comparative
r | figures which could be cited. All
j 1 of them point to the conclusion

that as compared with the ad
vanced industrial nations of the
world the ratio of our public
spending is conservative. There
is no hard factual basis for the
theory that we have turned our
back on the free economy and are
on the high road to socialism and
communism.
The latter day Republican prop
aganda does not work for the
very simple reason that it is not
true.
The soul-searching which went
on among the Republican orators
on Lincoln’s birthday did not
bring forth that new “image”
which they were all seeking.
Somewhere there is a block. It
prevents the Republican party
from getting to a position which
is both conservative and popular.
The block, I venture to suggest,
is that the Republican position
has been moved so far to the
right that the party has conceded
to the Kennedy administration
not only the left but the whole
vast dominant center.
This has left the Republican
leaders with no elbow room, aad
they are squeezed into a corner
where they can only say no. This
cannot make for popularity and
for votes in a country where the
population is growing prodigious
ly, where the way of life is chang
ing rapidly, where the people,
conscious of the huge productive
capacity of our economy, are de
manding that their crowded life
in the cities bo made more com
fortable and more civilized.
THE DISPLACEMENT of the
Republican leaders from the cen
ter to the right has many causes.
One of them, for example, is the
control of the party organization
by the old codgers, who have safe
seats and keep on being re-elected.
There is another reason which is
that in recent years Republican
doctrine has been shaped by the
orists who arc out of touch with
the modern world. Indeed, it would
not be an exaggeration to say that
it has been shaped by theorists
who do not know what they are
talking about.
These theorists have produced
a formula which discombobulates
Republican thinking. It is that
liberalism and progressivism are
the high road to socialism, and
that socialism is the high road to
communism. The extremists use
the formula to say that the Unit
ed States started down the road
to communism when the income
tax was legalized in 1913. But even
the moderates, Gen. Eisenhower,
for example, are deeply suspici
ous of social security and the
welfare state and of aid to edu
cation, and above all of the mod
ern conception of the compensa
tory economy.
The difficulty about making a
new image is that the Republican
theorists have created such a
false image of the Kennedy Dem
ocratic party that there is no ef
fective way they can oppose it.
Applied to the Kennedy adminis
tration the formula of the the
orists of the right, that progres
sivism loads to socialism and so
cialism to communism, is absurd.
It is silly. Though Mr. Kennedy
is a progressive and a liberal, he

is also a profound conservative,
and only the befuddled theorists
find that strange and hard to un
derstand.
THEIR CENTRAL theme,
which is also a central illusion, is
that this country is “spending”
its way out of freedom into so
cialism and communism. But is
it? I have some figures here
which come from Prof. F. M. Ba
tor, a leading authority on the
problems of government spend
ing.
A big rich country spends
more, of course, than a small
poor) country. The proper basis of
comparison, therefore, is the vol
ume of government spending
against the size of the economy.
Prof. Bator’s figures show that
government spending in the Unit
ed States is not out of line with
spending in other advanced indus
trial nations.
1959 is the most recent year for
which adequate comparative fig
ures are available. In that year in
the United States total public
spending (Federal, state, local)
, was 28.3 per cent of the gross na
tional product. As this includes
national defense, public education,
, highways, police, hospitals, and
what not, can it really be said
, that spending less than 30 per
cent publicly puts us on the road
; to, or anywhere near the road to,
socialism and communism? Can
it really bo said when of this 30
per cent which is spent publicly
; over half goes to purchases from
private firms producing for prof
' it?

AS A MATTKK of fact, in pub

There is another reason which is
that in recent years Republican
doctrine has been shaped by the
orists who arc out of touch with
the modern world. Indeed, it would
not be an exaggeration to say that
it has been shaped by theorists
who do not know what they are
talking about.
These theorists have produced
a formula which discombobulates
Republican thinking. It is that
liberalism and progressivism are
the high road to socialism, and
that socialism is the high road to
communism. The extremists use
the formula to say that the Unit
ed States started down the road
to communism when the income
tax was legalized in 1913. But even
the moderates, Gen. Eisenhower,
for example, are deeply suspici
ous of social security and the
welfare state and of aid to edu
cation, and above all of the mod
ern conception of the compensa
tory economy.
The difficulty about making a
new image is that the Republican
theorists have created such a
false image of the Kennedy Dem
ocratic party that there is no ef
fective way they can oppose it.
Applied to the Kennedy adminis
tration the formula of the the
orists of the right, that progres
sivism loads to socialism and so
cialism to communism, is absurd.
It is silly. Though Mr. Kennedy
is a progressive and a liberal, he

is also a profound conservative,
and only the befuddled theorists
find that strange and hard to un
derstand.
THEIR CENTRAL theme,
which is also a central illusion, is
that this country is “spending”
its way out of freedom into so
cialism and communism. But is
it? I have some figures here
which come from Prof. F. M. Ba
tor, a leading authority on the
problems of government spend
ing.
A big rich country spends
more, of course, than a small
poor) country. The proper basis of
comparison, therefore, is the vol
ume of government spending
against the size of the economy.
Prof. Bator’s figures show that
government spending in the Unit
ed States is not out of line with
spending in other advanced indus
trial nations.
1959 is the most recent year for
which adequate comparative fig
ures are available. In that year in
the United States total public
spending (Federal, state, local)
, was 28.3 per cent of the gross na
tional product. As this includes
national defense, public education,
, highways, police, hospitals, and
what not, can it really be said
, that spending less than 30 per
cent publicly puts us on the road
; to, or anywhere near the road to,
socialism and communism? Can
it really bo said when of this 30
per cent which is spent publicly
; over half goes to purchases from
private firms producing for prof
' it?

AS A MATTKK of fact, in pub
lic spending we arc behind Bel
1 gium (29.3 per cent), Canada (30
; per cent), France (33.5 per cent),
: United Kingdom (34.9 per cent),
■ Sweden (35.7 per cent). In West
I Germany the latest figures are
i for 1957. That was before the big
• rise of Gorman defense spending
- and at that time the percentage
I of public spending was slightly
' bigger than ours (28.6 per cent),
i Yet West Germany is regarded
, by many as the shining example
- of a free capitalistic economy.
1 But, it will be said, while de
- fense spending is necessary, the
- real creeping socialism is the
- money spent for social security,
veterans’ benefits, government in
i terest, and cash subsidies. For the
i United States the ratio of such
i payments to gross national pro
- duct was 7 per cent in 1959. The
-1 Canadian ratio was 8.7 per cent.
. | The United Kingdom’s ratio was
-! 11.2 per cent. The West German
-1 fin 1957) was 12.1 per cent, the
- i Belgian 13.6 per cent, the French
- j 16.5 per cent.
There are other comparative
r | figures which could be cited. All
j 1 of them point to the conclusion

that as compared with the ad
vanced industrial nations of the
world the ratio of our public
spending is conservative. There
is no hard factual basis for the
theory that we have turned our
back on the free economy and are
on the high road to socialism and
communism.
The latter day Republican prop
aganda does not work for the
very simple reason that it is not
true.
