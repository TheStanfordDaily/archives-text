As those members of Young
Americans for Freedom who par
ticipated in last Friday’s peace
demonstration, albeit clad in sack
cloth and ashes, we wish to ex
plain our objectives to those few
who might still be in doubt.
It has been asserted by Messrs.
Lyman and Green and others who
should know better that our
peace march “demonstrated the
contrast between creative politi
cal activity, (presumably, that ac
tivity with which the Liberal
agrees) and the intolerance which
results from inflexible dogma”
(presumably, all activities which
the Liberal abhors). Nothing
could be further from the truth.
We have simply demonstrated
that American liberals no longer
hold a monopoly on the now fa
mous John Harvey Bunzel for
mula for dealing with groups
with which one disagrees; that is,
“They should be exposed, ana
lyzed, discussed, and laughed at.”
Moreover, we are certain that
even the good Dr. Bunzel would
agree with us that laughter is a
tool which may be justifiably
utilized against all extremist
groups, regardless of their posi
tion on the political spectrum;
against “Turn Toward Peace”
rallies as well as “Indignation”
rallies: and against the American
Civil Liberties Union as well as
its right wing counterpart, the
John Birch Society.
