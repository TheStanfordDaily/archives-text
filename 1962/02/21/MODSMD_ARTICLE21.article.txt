Editor, The Daily:
The Congress of 81 Communist
Parties (including the U.S.) held
in Moscow (November-December
1961) declared that peace is their
main objective—as under peace
ful conditions will "socialism” be
best propagated.
Pacifists in the United States
and other countries of the world
who have taken up the cry for
peace are overlooking several is
sues:
1. that it was Russia who broke
the 3-year moratorium on nuclear
testing.
2. that "peaceful co-existence”
is not a new term, but has been
used by communists since the
days of Lenin.
3. that Russia has economically
supported civil wars—approached
the “brink of war” without in
volving herself in a world wide
conflagration.
4. that the United Stales has
constantly sought peace al
though not at the expense of her
national security.
5. that the United States pours
millions of dollars annually into
the UN, while Russia has refused
to settle her $l5 million debt to
that organ of peace.

6. that Russia is perfectly will
ing to enter into disarmament
talks, but is unwilling to allow
comprehensive inspection of her
defense plants a most peculiar
situation for a country which sug
gests disarmament as a means to
peace.
I, 100, want peaceful conditions
in the world. However, I feel it is
irresponsible to harass the men
in our government whom we
should support with confidence in
their judgment and peaceful
aims; rather than undermining
them in the guise of “democratic
appeals.” It is they who enter in
to active negotiations. It is they
who study the disasters of nu
clear war, nuclear testing, disar
mament and the prospects of
peace and all their ramifica
tions. It is also they who will
steadfastly refuse to render the
United States defense agencies
impotent in the face of a deceit
ful enemy.

Editor, The Daily:
The Congress of 81 Communist
Parties (including the U.S.) held
in Moscow (November-December
1961) declared that peace is their
main objective—as under peace
ful conditions will "socialism” be
best propagated.
Pacifists in the United States
and other countries of the world
who have taken up the cry for
peace are overlooking several is
sues:
1. that it was Russia who broke
the 3-year moratorium on nuclear
testing.
2. that "peaceful co-existence”
is not a new term, but has been
used by communists since the
days of Lenin.
3. that Russia has economically
supported civil wars—approached
the “brink of war” without in
volving herself in a world wide
conflagration.
4. that the United Stales has
constantly sought peace al
though not at the expense of her
national security.
5. that the United States pours
millions of dollars annually into
the UN, while Russia has refused
to settle her $l5 million debt to
that organ of peace.

6. that Russia is perfectly will
ing to enter into disarmament
talks, but is unwilling to allow
comprehensive inspection of her
defense plants a most peculiar
situation for a country which sug
gests disarmament as a means to
peace.
I, 100, want peaceful conditions
in the world. However, I feel it is
irresponsible to harass the men
in our government whom we
should support with confidence in
their judgment and peaceful
aims; rather than undermining
them in the guise of “democratic
appeals.” It is they who enter in
to active negotiations. It is they
who study the disasters of nu
clear war, nuclear testing, disar
mament and the prospects of
peace and all their ramifica
tions. It is also they who will
steadfastly refuse to render the
United States defense agencies
impotent in the face of a deceit
ful enemy.
