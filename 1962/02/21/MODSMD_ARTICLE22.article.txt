# LETTER QUESTIONED
## The 						Truth About Chiang 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
On Feb. 28, 1947, a Formosan
woman was killed for selling
bootleg cigarettes. The killing led
to protests and riots which were
suppressed in a very unpleasant
manner 10,000 Formosans were
shot and bayoneted. The execu
tioners were Chiang Kai-shek’s
henchmen who had come to For
mosa in 1945 to set up a National
ist Chinese government after the
Japanese had left.
In light of this fact, and many
others which will soon be men
tioned, a recent letter to The
Daily by a Chinese student who
lived on Formosa for 13 years
must be questioned. The letter
was written in response to a
Daily column which questioned
the advisability of creating a
“Stanford on Formosa” because
of its bad political atmosphere.
THE LETTER writer claims
that Formosans love Chiang be
cause he has made Formosa the
second richest country in Asia, j
In general, Formosans are very j
happy and that is why Chiang!
has been elected President three
successive times.
What are the facts? Many of

them can be obtained from Wil
liam J. Lederor’s best-selling “A i
Nation of Sheep” and in many |
other books as well.
The saga of “Chiang the Be
loved” begin in 1949 when he fled
to Formosa with his army. Upon
arriving, Chiang’s army quickly
made their presence known by I
looting stores, gutting hospitals,|
commandeering supplies, etc. The
Formosans objected so Chiang
rlid what any man who believes j
in democracy would do he turn- j

ed out his army which proceeded !
to slaughter thousands of Formo
sans.
IT HAS been a little over a
decade since that slaughter and j
it is difficult to believe that For-!
mosans have forgiven Chiang
since many of their relatives and
neighbors were among the
slaughtered. But Formosans hate
Chiang for other reasons as well.
They grimace when they hear
the story of how Chiang trans
formed an ignorant, backward,
illiterate country into El Dorado.

The truth is that under the Japa
nese the Formosans were 95 per

| cent literate. In addition, “their
agricultural techniques were the
most advanced in Asia with the
exception of Japan.” Lederer re
ports.
“True, there have been land re
forms . . . and agricultural de
velopments during the last 10
years; but the literacy and in
herited skill were present long be
fore Chiang Kai-shek sought
refuge there. Under the Japanese
. . . Formosa had been well de
veloped technically. The entire
area laced with a modern and ef
ficient network of good roads, ir
rigation and electrification.”
FINALLY, just how democratic
is the Formosan government? At
the local level officials ARE elect
ed by democratic processes. But
the men at the top the ones who
make the decisions are not elect
ed by the common people. These
National Assembly members
were chosen by Chiang Kai-shek
when he first arrived and most of
jthem are still sitting in the As
! sembly. Most of them are Chinese
refugees although Formosans
| constitute 80 per cent of the popu
lation.

So now wo see why Chiang has
been elected President three suc
cessive times. It is not because
the Formosans love him or be
cause they need him, as our let
ter writer states. The truth is the
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
ELECTS CHIANG, the very same
Assembly which Chiang has
stacked with men loyal to him!
. .AS IF this weren’t bad enough,
Chiang’s election is unconstitu
tional since the Nationalist Con
stitution states that Chiang is not
supposed to serve extra terms.
In light of these facts (many
more can be cited), one must
question the sincerity or recog
nize the naivete of our letter
writer. And we again question the
advisability of a Stanford group
studying on Formosa.
