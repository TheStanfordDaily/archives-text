HOUSE SYSTEM
Editor, The Daily:
As freshmen of the Stern
houses, we would like to give Wil
bur freshmen a clearer picture of
what Stern Hall life is like. This
topic was supposedly covered in
the recent talks at Dinkelspiel
and Wilbur, but we feel that the
impression left was not accurate.
The speaker representing inde
pendent living alked about Stern
Hall and not about the Stern
houses. Stern Hall is not one
large conglomeration. It is a phys
ical plant composed of eight in
dividual houses with individual
governments, individual social
programs, individual judicial
councils, etc. in short, individual
personalities.
Precisely speaking, the term
“Stern Hall’ should be used as
the terms “fraternities” and “eat
ing clubs” are used. It refers to
a type of living group independ
ent living.
Being acquainted with one type
Of living group, we plan to inves
tigate the other two. We would
like to emphasize to Wilbur fresh
men that there are three primary
types of living groups on-campus
at Stanford: fraternities, eating
clubs, and the house system. In
dependent housing should not be
reduced to secondary considera
tion in deciding where to spend
your next three years.

HARD TO TAKE
Editor, The Daily;
The article “The Other Side of
Coed Housing” by student-leader
Sue Davidson was hard to take.
Miss Davidson’s obvious affinity
for the small and the petty, and
her propensity to “table” or “put
-into-committee” bespeak her
qualifications for her responsible
position. She has obviously been
no small contributor in LASSU’s
determined drive to make its
weight, (and corresponding iner
tia), felt in every phase of cam
pus life.

If her report is truly indicative
of her intellectual capabilities and
interests, then, I too am in “no
rush” to have her “invade” Stern.
As for her being “used”: at her
present level, Stanford Woman
Sue Davidson need never worry
about being used for anything
but a LASSU representative for
Women’s Row.

The article “The Other Side of
Coed Housing” by student-leader
Sue Davidson was hard to take.
Miss Davidson’s obvious affinity
for the small and the petty, and
her propensity to “table” or “put
-into-committee” bespeak her
qualifications for her responsible
position. She has obviously been
no small contributor in LASSU’s
determined drive to make its
weight, (and corresponding iner
tia), felt in every phase of cam
pus life.

If her report is truly indicative
of her intellectual capabilities and
interests, then, I too am in “no
rush” to have her “invade” Stern.
As for her being “used”: at her
present level, Stanford Woman
Sue Davidson need never worry
about being used for anything
but a LASSU representative for
Women’s Row.

HOUSE SYSTEM
Editor, The Daily:
As freshmen of the Stern
houses, we would like to give Wil
bur freshmen a clearer picture of
what Stern Hall life is like. This
topic was supposedly covered in
the recent talks at Dinkelspiel
and Wilbur, but we feel that the
impression left was not accurate.
The speaker representing inde
pendent living alked about Stern
Hall and not about the Stern
houses. Stern Hall is not one
large conglomeration. It is a phys
ical plant composed of eight in
dividual houses with individual
governments, individual social
programs, individual judicial
councils, etc. in short, individual
personalities.
Precisely speaking, the term
“Stern Hall’ should be used as
the terms “fraternities” and “eat
ing clubs” are used. It refers to
a type of living group independ
ent living.
Being acquainted with one type
Of living group, we plan to inves
tigate the other two. We would
like to emphasize to Wilbur fresh
men that there are three primary
types of living groups on-campus
at Stanford: fraternities, eating
clubs, and the house system. In
dependent housing should not be
reduced to secondary considera
tion in deciding where to spend
your next three years.
