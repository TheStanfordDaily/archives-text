NEAR UNANIMITY
Editor, The Daily:
As resident assistants in the
Stern Houses we can affirm an
atmosphere of near unanimity
among Stein men endorsing the
idea of promptly adopting a co
educational housing plan here. In
the light of this consensus it is
distressing to note again, as ever
at Stanford, the baneful echo of
supercaution in the air.
Caution? Over two years ago
the joint faculty committees on
general studies and student resi
dences adopted the following res
olution: “The Joint committees
approve in principle a coeduca
lional house system for the upper
three undergraduate classes and
recommend altering existing (em
phasis added» housing to accom
modate this change. Men and
women students would occupy
separate sections or wings of each
house but would share dining, li
brary, and social facilities.”
Citing evidence of the success
of coeducational housing from
other institutions as well as from
Stanford’s overseas and Stanford
Village experiments, the joint
committee suggested that condi
tions seemed “most promising for
an experiment which might be
made in two wings of Stern or
elsewhere on the campus proper

next year.” That “next year” was j
last year. We cannot therefore i
regard the present proposals as j
precipitate.
We are convinced that the mem- I
bers of the Stern Houses can ac
cept the responsibility which in
evitably accompanies such a new
departure. We are likewise con
vinced that the students who are
likely to participate in such an
experiment are qualified to make
the fundamental decision to em
bark on the program. The men of
the Stern Houses have already in
dicated their enthusiasm for it; a
similar response from Stanford
women should be enough on
which to proceed.
We strongly urge that Stanford
begin this long-considered ven
ture in the Stern Houses next i
year.

WORTHLESS
Editor, The Daily:
In all humility may we suggest

I to Messrs. Rogers, Shevach and
| Frohnmayer that their letter was
j not worth the paper it was print
led on, much less the price of the
j ink. Anyone who would judge the
value of a campaign, not by the
content, but by the manner of
dress of the participants is more
than welcome to refrain from
joining.
We await a scathing rebuttal.

I-CENTER
Editor, The Daily:
The other day I happened to
hear o'f a survey which was be
gun on the characteristics of
American students frequently
participating in I-Center events,
j The survey was conducted by a
coed in education and was never
completed because she dropped
out of school. The preliminary
findings showed that the Ameri
can girl students interested in the
I-Center were academically su
perior to the average student, and
at the same time had wider inter
ests in many subjects such as art
and public affairs. Naturally,
t heir interest to the world out
side the United States was higher
than that of their roommates who
were taken as the random sample
of average student.
The I-Center was an ideal set

ling for gatherings of foreign and
American students to further
such interests as they may have
in common. The Center was a
most memorable place for the
foreign student, for the atmos
phere was conducive to communi
cation between American and
foreign students. Cultural differ
ences and language difficulties
frequently make it difficult to
freely associate with American
students, and some foreign stu
dents prefer to remain within
their own national groups. Both
foreign and American students
sometimes view other groups in
stereotyped fashion, as ‘‘lnscrut
able Indians” or ‘‘materialistic
Americans."
There is substantial awareness
of the problem of communication
and the HR has had a panel dis
cussion on the improvement of
communication between foreign
and American students. The
weekly coffee hours likewise
help to overcome the problem.
The most effective solution, how
ever, would seem to be to build a
new I-Center which would pro
vide the features missed since the
old one burned down in Novem
ber. I remember the pleasant and
easy atmosphere of the house
where I had so many interesting
encounters with people from all

j parts of the earth. Being a for
eign student, I used to find my
| self there exploring the exciting
experience of meeting other stu
dents from many lands. Of
course, the I-Center served very
well as “our home.”
Some of the foreign students
very much wish to see the Center
rebuilt soon, and we are seeking
some means by which we can
contribute to the reconstruction
of it. The volunteer group, Com
munity Committee for the Inter
national Students, has encourag
ed us by offering all-out assist
ance. We very much want the
I-Center to have a permanent
building. It should be an indis
pensable facility especially on this
internationally minded campus
with over 500 foreign students.
We are exploring the possibilities
of holding a fund-raising show or
festival on which foreign and
American students could work
together and further the commu
nication between the two groups.
With the help of many people this
dream could come true and could
be a memorable experience for all
involved. Those who are, are in
vited to join in the first meeting
I for this project to be held on
Monday, Feb, 26, at 7:30 p.m. in
the Women’s Clubhouse.
