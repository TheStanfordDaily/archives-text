Prospects are extremely dim for a Stanford championship in the
Big Five, hut all hope is not lost.
USC gave Stanford the chance it needed, by defeating the UCLA
Bruins once in their two-game set down south. The Southern Cal
win Friday put Stanford hack in the title chase, while the Bruin
victory Saturday eliminated Southern Cal.
UCLA IS ON lop at 7-1, while Stanford is 5-3 and SC is 5-4.
Washington is mathematically eliminated at 5-5, and Cal hasn’t won
a league game yet, although it I.

would be nice if they could win
this Friday against the Bruins.
So Stanford is two games be
hind with four left for both the
Tribe and the Bruins to play. The
two games when UCLA and Stan
ford play each other will decide
the title, needless to say.
It is hard to say who has the
tougher schedule. Stanford has
two games with USC remaining,
aside from the pair with UCLA.
But both of these games are in
the Pavilion, where Stanford
hasn’t lost a game this year.
UCLA FACES Cal this Friday,
and while Cal is winless, they
were surprisingly strong here
last Saturday, and could beat a
UC'.A team looking past them to
Saturday's game with Stanford.
UCLA also has to moot Wash
ington on the Huskie's home

court. Washington rarely loses
there, as Stanford basketball players will readily tell you.
STANFORD WASN’T AT TOP STRENGTH
In Stanford and UCLA’s first Bruins won S2-R4. but
that isn’t indicative of Stanford’s true strength. 'Fhe Indians had
Just finished playing USC the night before, and though the Tribe
won by a good margin, it probably took its worst physical beating of
the year in that game. Doug Clemetson broke his foot that game.
No doubt about it, the Indians were tired that Saturday against
UCLA.
This weekend, the tables will be reversed. Stanford will have a
week of rest, and the Bruins will have a Friday opponent. It could
be a different story in the Southland this weekend.

THIS STORY comes out of a Southern California newspaper.
It seems Mrs. Darrell Sutherland, (he mother of the guard on
the Stanford basketball team, has two other sons who play basket
ball. Gene, the youngest, plays ball at Crescenta Valley, and Gary,
who attends Glendale.
When Crescenta played Glendale, she had the thrill of watching
her two sons guard each other. Each scored 11 points. Mrs. Suther
land’s problem was which side of the grandstand to sit on.
She finally compromised, and sat on a different side each half.
DARRELL PRESENTED AX OUT
However, when the rematch came around, she had an out. Stan
ford was in town to meet USC in a do-or-die game to stay in the
AAWU title race.
The game meant little to her, but she had never seen Darrell at
full strength in a college basketball game. She saw him last year, but
he had a had ankle, and never hit his peak.
Mrs. Sutherland has had a great deal to do with the success
enjoyed by her athletically-minded sons. Aside from encouraging
them (she is regarded as the top sports fan in the La Crescenta areal
she can also give them tips in what may be their best sport, baseball.
IT SEEMS THAT Mrs. Sutherland was a softball catcher and
toured the world, playing for women’s all-star aggregations.

were surprisingly strong here
last Saturday, and could beat a

Saturday's game with Stanford.
UCLA also has to moot Wash

court. Washington rarely loses
there, as Stanford basketball players will readily tell you.

Just finished playing USC the night before, and though the Tribe
won by a good margin, it probably took its worst physical beating of
the year in that game. Doug Clemetson broke his foot that game.
No doubt about it, the Indians were tired that Saturday against
UCLA.
This weekend, the tables will be reversed. Stanford will have a
week of rest, and the Bruins will have a Friday opponent. It could
be a different story in the Southland this weekend.

THIS STORY comes out of a Southern California newspaper.
It seems Mrs. Darrell Sutherland, (he mother of the guard on
the Stanford basketball team, has two other sons who play basket
ball. Gene, the youngest, plays ball at Crescenta Valley, and Gary,
who attends Glendale.
When Crescenta played Glendale, she had the thrill of watching
her two sons guard each other. Each scored 11 points. Mrs. Suther
land’s problem was which side of the grandstand to sit on.
She finally compromised, and sat on a different side each half.
DARRELL PRESENTED AX OUT
However, when the rematch came around, she had an out. Stan
ford was in town to meet USC in a do-or-die game to stay in the
AAWU title race.
The game meant little to her, but she had never seen Darrell at
full strength in a college basketball game. She saw him last year, but
he had a had ankle, and never hit his peak.
Mrs. Sutherland has had a great deal to do with the success
enjoyed by her athletically-minded sons. Aside from encouraging
them (she is regarded as the top sports fan in the La Crescenta areal
she can also give them tips in what may be their best sport, baseball.
IT SEEMS THAT Mrs. Sutherland was a softball catcher and
toured the world, playing for women’s all-star aggregations.


DARRELL SUTHERLAND

Prospects are extremely dim for a Stanford championship in the
Big Five, hut all hope is not lost.
USC gave Stanford the chance it needed, by defeating the UCLA
Bruins once in their two-game set down south. The Southern Cal
win Friday put Stanford hack in the title chase, while the Bruin
victory Saturday eliminated Southern Cal.
UCLA IS ON lop at 7-1, while Stanford is 5-3 and SC is 5-4.
Washington is mathematically eliminated at 5-5, and Cal hasn’t won

this Friday against the Bruins.
So Stanford is two games be
hind with four left for both the
Tribe and the Bruins to play. The
two games when UCLA and Stan
ford play each other will decide
the title, needless to say.
It is hard to say who has the
tougher schedule. Stanford has
two games with USC remaining,
aside from the pair with UCLA.
But both of these games are in
the Pavilion, where Stanford
hasn’t lost a game this year.
