# AT SAN JOSE
## Netters In First Tourney 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford will be playing tennis
for the next three days in San
Jose. The Northern California
Tennis Intercollegiatos will bo
held there today, tomorrow, and
Friday.
Coach Bob Renker plans to
send a six-man varsity squad
down the peninsula, along with a
pair of frosh, to defend the
Tribe’s championship won there
last year.
VOSIII MINK.ISIII is the num
ber one Stanford entrant. George
Bates isn’t far behind him on the
tennis ladder. Other Stanford en
trants are Johan Horn, John Is
sues, John Minne, and Brad
Hodgeman.
The top varsity doubles team is
scheduled to be Minigishi and
Bates.
Sheldon Boege and Robert Wea
ver arc the freshmen who will
compete in the Frosh-JC part of
the tourney. John MacPherson
and Roger Poole were slated to
go to San Jose with the frosh, but
for various reasons cannot.
CALIFORNIA IS favored to
win the San Jose tournament,
with Stanford a close second.
Other good teams are Sacramento
State and USF.
Cal features the number three
doubles team in the nation, com
posed of Bill Hoogs and Jim Mc-
Manus. Hoogs and MsManus are
also top singles players. Cal dou
bles team will be top seeded and
Hoogs will probably he seeded
first in the singles.
However Minigishi isn’t far be
hind, and could take it all.
He has experience surprising
opponents. Only lightly regarded
in last year’s National Intercol
legiates, he finished in the quar
ter-finals, after upsetting two
players rated in the top ten in the
country.
HE WON’T BE so lightly re
garded now.
Renker sizes up the Big Five
tennis title chase as SC leading
the pack, with four dangerous
teams chasing the Trojans.
SC has such well-known rac
queteers as Ramsey Earnhart,
Raphael Osuna, Dennis Ralston
and Bill Bod. UCLA will be tough
with Larry Nagler back, while
Washington has balance.
OF COURSE CAL has Hoogs
and McManus, while Stanford is
always tough on the tennis
courts.
It sizes up as anybody’s race,
with SC favored, and Stanford
capable of winning it.
