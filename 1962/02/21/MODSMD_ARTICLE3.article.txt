# Business Evils Help Socialism
## 
### NILS WESSELL 
Big businesses object to the
principle of economic dictation as
practiced under Communism
while they themselves arc dictat
ing prices to the American public
by price-fixing agreements, Bur
ton Wolfe stated yesterday in a
speech sponsored by Breakers
Club.
Wolfe, editor of the muckrak
ing magazine, The Californian,
spoke on “The Evils of Big Busi
ness.”
He also suggested that big busi
ness. while preaching against
economic regulation and social
ism, is unwittingly the greatest
force working for socialism in the
U.S. Business malpractices, he
suggested, encourage the govern
ment to regulate business, and
then big business complains of
socialism.
He cited Safeway stores as one
of the worst offenders in accept
ing “discriminatory promotional
payment allowances.” These al
lowances amount to a ten per cent
discount on food goods sold by
their manufacturers to a retail
chain store, fn return a chain
store like Safeway gives special
display to one manufacturer’s
produce. Also Safeway may ad
vertise only this one brand in
local newspapers.
The chain stores force small
independents out of business and
thereby corner the market, he
said.
