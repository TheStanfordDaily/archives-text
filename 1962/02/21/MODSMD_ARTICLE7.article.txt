# Water Scarcity Major Problem In California
## 
### BILL REPPY 
“Bold in size and perhaps stag
gering in cost,” but an important
j step toward solving California’s
j critical water problems—this was
j the view of Arthur Piper on the
j California Water Project to bring
| Feather River water to the di’y
areas of the state.
Piper, division hydrologist for
| the U.S. Geological Survey, spoke
j on our state’s water problems last
night in Memorial Auditorium in
I the Tuesday Evening Series.
THREE FOURTHS of Calif or
! nia’s water supply is generated
north of Sacramento, while three
fourths of the water need is found
south of the Capital, Piper said.
The San Juaquin Valley agri
, cultural area and not the Los
• Angeles Metropolitan complex is
the area with the most accute
water shortage, he said.
California’s water needs arc
I more than twice that required by
1 any other slate, Piper said. We
use 35 billion gallons a day, with
> j agriculture irrigation consuming
' | the largest share.
; j Turning to water pollution,
’ Piper noted two methods to meet
this problem: (1) by diluting pol
luted water in streams requiring
pure water that is needed desper
atoly for consumption, (2) by con
structing a network of canals to
carry waste to the ocean in con
centrated form.
THE PROCESS of desalinating
■ ocean water for consumption is
still too expensive, Piper said.
( Desalinated water now would cost
$1 a ton. Californians pay an
, everage of $.05 a ton for their
> water.
; Piper also suggested that soft
. ening of water for drinking may
? be linked to health problems. A
. recent report showed a correla
) (ion of a low incidence of cardio-
I vascular diseases (which cause 50
1 per cent of American fatalities)
. with consumption of hard water,
i THE SMALL AMOUNT of van
i adium in hard water is thought to
, he the key to the low incidence of
. I cardio vascular ailments, he said.
I ! Piper, who has been with the
i; U.S. Geological Survey since 1926,
J j illustrated his lecture with maps,
graphs, and photographs.
