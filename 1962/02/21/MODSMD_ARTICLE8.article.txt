# Sanford to Talk On Universities At Fireside
## 
### 
Do you have questions about
coed dorms? You don’t like your
curriculum? Prof. Nevitt Sanford
can answer these and many other
questions at a fireside tonight at
7:30 in Muir Lounge. The fire
side is to deal with the general
topic of Sanford's thousand-page
book, "The American College.”
Part of the Student - Faculty
Board authors’ series, the fireside
is open to all students and facul
ty, in addition to those who have
already signed up.
Sanford hopes people will come
to ask questions about his book,
and about his views even if they
have not read his book. He would
he happy to have people ask how
(he 30 education interpreters hap
pened to write the book.
Three other contributors to the
book have come to Stanford re
cently to take part in the Institute
for the Study of Human Prob
lems: Drs. Joseph Katz, Chris
tian Bay. and Howard Becker.
Sanford pointed out that al
though publicity has promoted the
idea that colleges are criticized in
the study, the book is not primar
ally a criticism of colleges, but
an analysis and summary of ten
years research.
The first chapter is concerned
mainly with criticism. An exam
ple: “A close look at college-educ
cated people in the U.S. is enough
to dispel any notion that our in
stitutions of higher learning are
doing a good job of liberal educa
tion.
Prof. H. J. Forstman, depart
ment of religion, is hosting a fire
side Monday evening at 7:30 in
'francos lounge.
