# Campo in Finals Of Mural Debate
## 
### 
El Campo, on the strength of
Randy Gallistel’s debating skill,
yesterday advanced to the finals
of the “Issues of Challenge’’ in
tramural tournament by defeating
Muir. Campo’s opponent will be
determined this afternon at 4:15
in room 251K as Lagunita clashes
with Trancos on the question of
HUAC abolition.
Gallistel attacked the committee
with both wit and logic in a man
ner which earned him superior
ratings from two of the three
judges. Muir's Mark Hayutin ably
defended the committee, however,
arguing that the continued exis
tence of the HUAC was justified
on the basis of investigatory, pub
licity, and watchdog functions.
The debate was close, as evidence
by the 2 to 1 judges’ decision.
This afternoon’s debate will
match Mary Minor of Lagunita
on the affirmative and Randy Wil
lard of Trancos, in what should be
another excellent contest. Miss
Minor last week upset John
Spence of the previously unde
feated SAE's, while Willard is
one of the top frosh debaters on
the Farm in recent years. Spec
tators will bo welcome.
The final debate will take place
on Thursday, March 1. Sides will
be announced later, and the Cam
po speaker will be either Gallistel
or negative speaker Bob Gates.
The Trancos team is Willard and
Bill Cornwall, while Miss Manor
and Karen Downs represent Lagu
nita.
