The gift, pledged to aid Stan;
Program, is earmarked for con

grams of teaching and chemistry
research in physical chemistry,
including studies in plastics and
other inorganic substances.
THK JOHN STAUFFER Lab
oratory for Physical Chemistry
will be the second building in the
growing Chemistry Quadrangle
at Stanford to owe its basic fi
nances to the same donor.
The first building—for study of
organic chemistry -was dedicated
last March in honor of Stauffer's
parents, John and Katharina
Stauffer. His father was the
founder of Stauffer Chemical
Company. The buildings will bo
adjacent and similar in design.
The gift was announced to din
ner guests at the California Club
by Arthur C. Stewart, Union Oil

Gifts Committee for the Stanford
PACE campaign.
Thomas P. Pike, president of
the Stanford Trustees, and Stan

gratefully acknowledged the
Stauffer gift for the University.

ply Company of California, is a
national co-chairman of the
PACE campaign.
DR. STERLING SAID that ul
timate results of such contribu
tions as those made by Stauffer
and other friends of the Universi
ty are “beyond calculation.”

“Few areas of science can claim
more spectacular development in
recent years than can chemistry,”
he said. “Current trends of re
search in both organic and physi
cal chemistry are contributing
greatly to the health and comfort
of mankind.

“We are happy to see Stanford
making rapid progress toward
becoming one of the great world
centers of expanding chemical
knowledge."
The new building is tentative
ly scheduled for completion by
the end of 1963. Directing re
search and teaching there will be
two outstanding new members of
the Stanford faculty: Dr. Paul J.
Flory, former Executive Director
of Research at the Mellon Insti
tute, and Dr. Henry Taube, for
mer head of the University of
Chicago Chemistry Department.
JOHN STAUFFER SR. pioneer
