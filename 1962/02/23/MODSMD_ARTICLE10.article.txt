# Stern Houses To be Fixed
## 
### 
Stern Hall’s “underground”
a series of basement rooms now
either vacant or unused—will be
made an integral part of dormi
tory life under a program first
authorized by Stanford Univer
sity’s Board of Trustees.
The University’s second largest
men’s dormitory, which holds
some 600 students in eight
“houses,” will benefit from a $48,-
000 remodeling and redecoration.
As soon as contracts can be let,
the basement rooms will be turn
ed into library, club, and recrea
tion rooms.
Individual house changes in
clude the following: Holladay,
small library and study room;
Muir, club room for games and
dancing; Donner, space for rec
reation and dancing, in addition
to the present billiards and ping
pong room.
In addition, the main floor
lounges in Donner and Serra
wings will be fitted with new
drapes, Burbank lounge will re
ceive additional furniture, and
patios will receive additional out
door lounges and chairs.
Redecoration of all four dining
rooms is also scheduled.
The dormitory was completed
during the late 1950’5, but base
ment use was delayed for budg
etary reasons, according to Plan
ning Office officials.
Stern Hall is the gift of the es
tate of Mrs. Ruth Lucie Stern,
the “Aunt Lucie” of many Stan
ford and Bay Area philanthro
pies.
