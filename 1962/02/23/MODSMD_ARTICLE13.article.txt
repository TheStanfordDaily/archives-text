# A 						CROSSING
## The 						Wall at the Berlin Border 
### PHIL HUYCK 
(Editor’s Note: Phil Huyck is
a Stanford graduate now study
ing: in Berlin.)

For the several hundred stu
dents of the Free University of
Berlin who still resided in the
East Sector, the erection of the
cement and barbed wire wall on
the 13th of August came as a

blow. They had been crossing the
border daily for years, to pursue
illegally their studies in the West.
Suddenly they found themselves
shut off from (heir education, im
prisoned behind a “wall of
shame” (Schandmauer). Many of
them managed to escape, but a
number did not, and theirs is a
most doubtful future.
One young medical student who
made good his escape with phony
papers returned again and again
with a small group of comrades
to the East Sector, risking arrest
and imprisonment, to help smug
gle friends and strangers out to
the West through the sewers that
run underneath the whole city.
They ceased their activities re
cently when one of their group
was caught and imprisoned, and
the East German authorities be
gan to weld the sewer entrances
shut. He was kind enough to
write a brief resume of his ex
periences and feelings.
“I WAS already studying at
(he Free University of Berlin be
fore the 13th of August. I lived
in the East Sector of the city, and
commuted, therefore, between
East and West.
“As was the case with many of
my fellow students, the blockade
measures of the Zone regime
caught me by surprise. We were
faced with a decision: a renun
ciation of our studies and remain
ing united with our families, or

flight to Iho west with the guar
antee of further study, hut also
with the danger that we might
hi* caught by (he People’s Army
and bo forced to spend several
years behind prison walls or in
labor camps.

“Nearly all of my friends and
acquaintances, horde r-hoppers
(Grenzenganger) who had been
working for years in West Ber
lin, decided to flee.

“ALL WERE in a belligerent
mood. When a power failure oc
curred for a few hours, we cheer
ed and joyously yelled ‘Sabotage!’
Wo would much have preferred
to attack the party members.
“Mothers ran weeping through
the streets because their children
had been captured as they at
tempted to escape. Many from
our area had previously been sen
tenced to several years in prison,
ostensibly because they had given
speeches against the state.
“With a certain cynicism we
related to each other: ‘Have you
heard the latest news, already
another protest from the Allies.’
Everyone asked himself (he ques
tion, why do the Allies bow be
fore Ulbricht; they should rip
the barricades away.

“If the Russians really did
come, we would either have a
war (which we began to see as
the only solution to this hopeless
situation) or perhaps a cessation
of the wall construction. A glim
mer of hope would have remain
ed if at least something had been
attempted; now no one in the
East Zone of our country believes
that there will be an improve
ment in the coming years, per
haps even in decades.

“WE TRIED everything to get
across the border; we attempted
to swim canals, to get out
through old ruins or over roofs.

Rut it was practically impossible
even to get to (he border. It was
swarming with “National Peo
ple's Army,” Battle Group Units
(recruited from factory workers),
and agents in civilian clothes.

“Friends and strangers from
West Berlin and West Germany,
who put their identification pa
pers at our disposal, helped to
prepare the way. Some brought
us passes with a completely dif
ferent picture on them, different
eye color, and different age. Wo
risked the five-year jail sentence,
went through several control
points, and were in West Beilin.
“I COULD scarcely believe it.
The streets of East Berlin were
occupied by tanks, police pla
toons in great numbers, barbed
wire fence everywhere, and I
had come across the border
through a chain of 20 police with
a small, crumpled, completely
strange pass.

“At the first control point I
was relatively calm. At the sec
ond and third, which brought me
about 20 meters of the West sec
tor, I thought, ‘should I run,
would they shoot, would they hit
me?’

“At the last control, where an
officer closely examined me and
the picture on the pass, I was
tempted 1o run. I had to exercise
a great deal of self-control to go
slowly.
“In this same manner, with
similar heart poundings and sim
ilar risk, hundreds of people man
aged their way into West Berlin.
Others chose a path through the
barbed wire, swimming canals, or
through the sewers.
“BOVS. GIRLS, women, men
climbing out of the sewers of the
border streets, covered with filth,
falling into each other's arms,
grateful and elated, made a deep
impression on me, that can only
lead me, as a member of the
younger generation, to hate and
despise a totalitarian regime.
“The attitude even of some
Germans, who, far from Berlin,
have attained possession of a

little home and a car—with the
help of the economic miracle—is
disappointing.
“Many are so indifferent and
disinterested in the recent events,
that one can only hope after the
revelation of the ‘murderous
Red fascism’ that no other revolt
in East Germany, Budapest, or
another wall of shame with
shooting police will be necessary
to arouse them and the rest of
the world momentarily.
“MANY FELLOW students
who were not fortunate enough
to reach western freedom must
now spend several years in some
factory as a helper, or sacrifice
their time on the farms in the
country in order to ‘prove them
selves.' Will they ever be able to
study again? Will they have the
power to remain true to their be
liefs and renounce communism?”
This student’s reaction to his
experiences seems to me not only
a bitter condemnation of a des
potic regime and of western poli
cy toward it, hut also a tacit ad
monishment to those students
who have forgotten, or perhaps
never understood, the value and
meaning of an education.

a Stanford graduate now study
ing: in Berlin.)

For the several hundred stu
dents of the Free University of
Berlin who still resided in the
East Sector, the erection of the
cement and barbed wire wall on
the 13th of August came as a

blow. They had been crossing the
border daily for years, to pursue
illegally their studies in the West.
Suddenly they found themselves
shut off from (heir education, im
prisoned behind a “wall of
shame” (Schandmauer). Many of
them managed to escape, but a
number did not, and theirs is a
most doubtful future.
One young medical student who
made good his escape with phony
papers returned again and again
with a small group of comrades
to the East Sector, risking arrest
and imprisonment, to help smug
gle friends and strangers out to
the West through the sewers that
run underneath the whole city.
They ceased their activities re
cently when one of their group
was caught and imprisoned, and
the East German authorities be
gan to weld the sewer entrances
shut. He was kind enough to
write a brief resume of his ex
periences and feelings.
“I WAS already studying at
(he Free University of Berlin be
fore the 13th of August. I lived
in the East Sector of the city, and
commuted, therefore, between
East and West.
“As was the case with many of
my fellow students, the blockade
measures of the Zone regime
caught me by surprise. We were
faced with a decision: a renun
ciation of our studies and remain
ing united with our families, or

flight to Iho west with the guar
antee of further study, hut also
with the danger that we might
hi* caught by (he People’s Army
and bo forced to spend several
years behind prison walls or in
labor camps.

“Nearly all of my friends and
acquaintances, horde r-hoppers
(Grenzenganger) who had been
working for years in West Ber
lin, decided to flee.

“ALL WERE in a belligerent
mood. When a power failure oc
curred for a few hours, we cheer
ed and joyously yelled ‘Sabotage!’
Wo would much have preferred
to attack the party members.
“Mothers ran weeping through
the streets because their children
had been captured as they at
tempted to escape. Many from
our area had previously been sen
tenced to several years in prison,
ostensibly because they had given
speeches against the state.
“With a certain cynicism we
related to each other: ‘Have you
heard the latest news, already
another protest from the Allies.’
Everyone asked himself (he ques
tion, why do the Allies bow be
fore Ulbricht; they should rip
the barricades away.

“If the Russians really did
come, we would either have a
war (which we began to see as
the only solution to this hopeless
situation) or perhaps a cessation
of the wall construction. A glim
mer of hope would have remain
ed if at least something had been
attempted; now no one in the
East Zone of our country believes
that there will be an improve
ment in the coming years, per
haps even in decades.

“WE TRIED everything to get
across the border; we attempted
to swim canals, to get out
through old ruins or over roofs.

Rut it was practically impossible
even to get to (he border. It was
swarming with “National Peo
ple's Army,” Battle Group Units
(recruited from factory workers),
and agents in civilian clothes.

“Friends and strangers from
West Berlin and West Germany,
who put their identification pa
pers at our disposal, helped to
prepare the way. Some brought
us passes with a completely dif
ferent picture on them, different
eye color, and different age. Wo
risked the five-year jail sentence,
went through several control
points, and were in West Beilin.
“I COULD scarcely believe it.
The streets of East Berlin were
occupied by tanks, police pla
toons in great numbers, barbed
wire fence everywhere, and I
had come across the border
through a chain of 20 police with
a small, crumpled, completely
strange pass.

“At the first control point I
was relatively calm. At the sec
ond and third, which brought me
about 20 meters of the West sec
tor, I thought, ‘should I run,
would they shoot, would they hit
me?’

“At the last control, where an
officer closely examined me and
the picture on the pass, I was
tempted 1o run. I had to exercise
a great deal of self-control to go
slowly.
“In this same manner, with
similar heart poundings and sim
ilar risk, hundreds of people man
aged their way into West Berlin.
Others chose a path through the
barbed wire, swimming canals, or
through the sewers.
“BOVS. GIRLS, women, men
climbing out of the sewers of the
border streets, covered with filth,
falling into each other's arms,
grateful and elated, made a deep
impression on me, that can only
lead me, as a member of the
younger generation, to hate and
despise a totalitarian regime.
“The attitude even of some
Germans, who, far from Berlin,
have attained possession of a

little home and a car—with the
help of the economic miracle—is
disappointing.
“Many are so indifferent and
disinterested in the recent events,
that one can only hope after the
revelation of the ‘murderous
Red fascism’ that no other revolt
in East Germany, Budapest, or
another wall of shame with
shooting police will be necessary
to arouse them and the rest of
the world momentarily.
“MANY FELLOW students
who were not fortunate enough
to reach western freedom must
now spend several years in some
factory as a helper, or sacrifice
their time on the farms in the
country in order to ‘prove them
selves.' Will they ever be able to
study again? Will they have the
power to remain true to their be
liefs and renounce communism?”
This student’s reaction to his
experiences seems to me not only
a bitter condemnation of a des
potic regime and of western poli
cy toward it, hut also a tacit ad
monishment to those students
who have forgotten, or perhaps
never understood, the value and
meaning of an education.

dents of the Free University of
Berlin who still resided in the
East Sector, the erection of the
cement and barbed wire wall on
the 13th of August came as a

blow. They had been crossing the
border daily for years, to pursue
illegally their studies in the West.
Suddenly they found themselves
shut off from (heir education, im
prisoned behind a “wall of
shame” (Schandmauer). Many of
them managed to escape, but a
number did not, and theirs is a
most doubtful future.
One young medical student who
made good his escape with phony
papers returned again and again
with a small group of comrades
to the East Sector, risking arrest
and imprisonment, to help smug
gle friends and strangers out to
the West through the sewers that
run underneath the whole city.
They ceased their activities re
cently when one of their group
was caught and imprisoned, and
the East German authorities be
gan to weld the sewer entrances
shut. He was kind enough to
write a brief resume of his ex
periences and feelings.
“I WAS already studying at
(he Free University of Berlin be
fore the 13th of August. I lived
in the East Sector of the city, and
commuted, therefore, between
East and West.
“As was the case with many of
my fellow students, the blockade
measures of the Zone regime
caught me by surprise. We were
faced with a decision: a renun
ciation of our studies and remain
ing united with our families, or

flight to Iho west with the guar
antee of further study, hut also
with the danger that we might
hi* caught by (he People’s Army
and bo forced to spend several
years behind prison walls or in
labor camps.

“Nearly all of my friends and
acquaintances, horde r-hoppers
(Grenzenganger) who had been
working for years in West Ber
lin, decided to flee.

“ALL WERE in a belligerent
mood. When a power failure oc
curred for a few hours, we cheer
ed and joyously yelled ‘Sabotage!’
Wo would much have preferred
to attack the party members.
“Mothers ran weeping through
the streets because their children
had been captured as they at
tempted to escape. Many from
our area had previously been sen
tenced to several years in prison,
ostensibly because they had given
speeches against the state.
“With a certain cynicism we
related to each other: ‘Have you
heard the latest news, already
another protest from the Allies.’
Everyone asked himself (he ques
tion, why do the Allies bow be
fore Ulbricht; they should rip
the barricades away.

“If the Russians really did
come, we would either have a
war (which we began to see as
the only solution to this hopeless
situation) or perhaps a cessation
of the wall construction. A glim
mer of hope would have remain
ed if at least something had been
attempted; now no one in the
East Zone of our country believes
that there will be an improve
ment in the coming years, per
haps even in decades.

“WE TRIED everything to get
across the border; we attempted
to swim canals, to get out
through old ruins or over roofs.

Rut it was practically impossible
even to get to (he border. It was
swarming with “National Peo
ple's Army,” Battle Group Units
(recruited from factory workers),
and agents in civilian clothes.

“Friends and strangers from
West Berlin and West Germany,
who put their identification pa
pers at our disposal, helped to
prepare the way. Some brought
us passes with a completely dif
ferent picture on them, different
eye color, and different age. Wo
risked the five-year jail sentence,
went through several control
points, and were in West Beilin.
“I COULD scarcely believe it.
The streets of East Berlin were
occupied by tanks, police pla
toons in great numbers, barbed
wire fence everywhere, and I
had come across the border
through a chain of 20 police with
a small, crumpled, completely
strange pass.

“At the first control point I
was relatively calm. At the sec
ond and third, which brought me
about 20 meters of the West sec
tor, I thought, ‘should I run,
would they shoot, would they hit
me?’

“At the last control, where an
officer closely examined me and
the picture on the pass, I was
tempted 1o run. I had to exercise
a great deal of self-control to go
slowly.
“In this same manner, with
similar heart poundings and sim
ilar risk, hundreds of people man
aged their way into West Berlin.
Others chose a path through the
barbed wire, swimming canals, or
through the sewers.
“BOVS. GIRLS, women, men
climbing out of the sewers of the
border streets, covered with filth,
falling into each other's arms,
grateful and elated, made a deep
impression on me, that can only
lead me, as a member of the
younger generation, to hate and
despise a totalitarian regime.
“The attitude even of some
Germans, who, far from Berlin,
have attained possession of a

little home and a car—with the
help of the economic miracle—is
disappointing.
“Many are so indifferent and
disinterested in the recent events,
that one can only hope after the
revelation of the ‘murderous
Red fascism’ that no other revolt
in East Germany, Budapest, or
another wall of shame with
shooting police will be necessary
to arouse them and the rest of
the world momentarily.
“MANY FELLOW students
who were not fortunate enough
to reach western freedom must
now spend several years in some
factory as a helper, or sacrifice
their time on the farms in the
country in order to ‘prove them
selves.' Will they ever be able to
study again? Will they have the
power to remain true to their be
liefs and renounce communism?”
This student’s reaction to his
experiences seems to me not only
a bitter condemnation of a des
potic regime and of western poli
cy toward it, hut also a tacit ad
monishment to those students
who have forgotten, or perhaps
never understood, the value and

cement and barbed wire wall on
the 13th of August came as a

blow. They had been crossing the
border daily for years, to pursue
illegally their studies in the West.
Suddenly they found themselves
shut off from (heir education, im
prisoned behind a “wall of
shame” (Schandmauer). Many of
them managed to escape, but a
number did not, and theirs is a
most doubtful future.
One young medical student who
made good his escape with phony
papers returned again and again
with a small group of comrades
to the East Sector, risking arrest
and imprisonment, to help smug
gle friends and strangers out to
the West through the sewers that
run underneath the whole city.
They ceased their activities re
cently when one of their group
was caught and imprisoned, and
the East German authorities be
gan to weld the sewer entrances
shut. He was kind enough to
write a brief resume of his ex
periences and feelings.
“I WAS already studying at
(he Free University of Berlin be
fore the 13th of August. I lived
in the East Sector of the city, and
commuted, therefore, between
East and West.
“As was the case with many of
my fellow students, the blockade
measures of the Zone regime
caught me by surprise. We were
faced with a decision: a renun
ciation of our studies and remain
ing united with our families, or

flight to Iho west with the guar
antee of further study, hut also
with the danger that we might
hi* caught by (he People’s Army
and bo forced to spend several
years behind prison walls or in
labor camps.

“Nearly all of my friends and
acquaintances, horde r-hoppers
(Grenzenganger) who had been
working for years in West Ber
lin, decided to flee.

“ALL WERE in a belligerent
mood. When a power failure oc
curred for a few hours, we cheer
ed and joyously yelled ‘Sabotage!’
Wo would much have preferred
to attack the party members.
“Mothers ran weeping through
the streets because their children
had been captured as they at
tempted to escape. Many from
our area had previously been sen
tenced to several years in prison,
ostensibly because they had given
speeches against the state.
“With a certain cynicism we
related to each other: ‘Have you
heard the latest news, already
another protest from the Allies.’
Everyone asked himself (he ques
tion, why do the Allies bow be
fore Ulbricht; they should rip
the barricades away.

“If the Russians really did
come, we would either have a
war (which we began to see as
the only solution to this hopeless
situation) or perhaps a cessation
of the wall construction. A glim
mer of hope would have remain
ed if at least something had been
attempted; now no one in the
East Zone of our country believes
that there will be an improve
ment in the coming years, per
haps even in decades.

“WE TRIED everything to get
across the border; we attempted
to swim canals, to get out
through old ruins or over roofs.

Rut it was practically impossible
even to get to (he border. It was
swarming with “National Peo
ple's Army,” Battle Group Units
(recruited from factory workers),
and agents in civilian clothes.

“Friends and strangers from
West Berlin and West Germany,
who put their identification pa
pers at our disposal, helped to
prepare the way. Some brought
us passes with a completely dif
ferent picture on them, different
eye color, and different age. Wo
risked the five-year jail sentence,
went through several control
points, and were in West Beilin.
“I COULD scarcely believe it.
The streets of East Berlin were
occupied by tanks, police pla
toons in great numbers, barbed
wire fence everywhere, and I
had come across the border
through a chain of 20 police with
a small, crumpled, completely
strange pass.

“At the first control point I
was relatively calm. At the sec
ond and third, which brought me
about 20 meters of the West sec
tor, I thought, ‘should I run,
would they shoot, would they hit
me?’

“At the last control, where an
officer closely examined me and
the picture on the pass, I was
tempted 1o run. I had to exercise
a great deal of self-control to go
slowly.
“In this same manner, with
similar heart poundings and sim
ilar risk, hundreds of people man
aged their way into West Berlin.
Others chose a path through the
barbed wire, swimming canals, or
through the sewers.
“BOVS. GIRLS, women, men
climbing out of the sewers of the
border streets, covered with filth,
falling into each other's arms,
grateful and elated, made a deep
impression on me, that can only
lead me, as a member of the
younger generation, to hate and
despise a totalitarian regime.
“The attitude even of some
Germans, who, far from Berlin,
have attained possession of a

little home and a car—with the
help of the economic miracle—is
disappointing.
“Many are so indifferent and
disinterested in the recent events,
that one can only hope after the
revelation of the ‘murderous
Red fascism’ that no other revolt
in East Germany, Budapest, or
another wall of shame with
shooting police will be necessary
to arouse them and the rest of
the world momentarily.
“MANY FELLOW students
who were not fortunate enough
to reach western freedom must
now spend several years in some
factory as a helper, or sacrifice
their time on the farms in the
country in order to ‘prove them
selves.' Will they ever be able to
study again? Will they have the
power to remain true to their be
liefs and renounce communism?”
This student’s reaction to his
experiences seems to me not only
a bitter condemnation of a des
potic regime and of western poli
cy toward it, hut also a tacit ad
monishment to those students
who have forgotten, or perhaps
never understood, the value and
meaning of an education.
