# IIR POLITICAL ANALYSIS
## A 						Policy for Vietnam 
### 
By OAKY A. PATTON
New York Governor Nelson A.
Rockefeller recently stated that
the United States should have
used its armed forces to back the
Cuban invasion of last April, and
the failiu’e of the U.S. to do so
resulted in a “definite defeat” at
the recent hemisphere conference
of foreign ministers.
Rockefeller attributed the out
come of the conference to the
fact that the large countries of
Latin and South America feel
that “the great United States had
failed to live up to the Monroe
Doctrine,” and that therefore
they could not depend on us to
stop further Communist en
croachment in the hemisphere.
ROCKEFELLER’S view paral
lels one presented by Robert S.
Elegant, Newsweek’s bureau
chief for Southeast Asia. Elegant
states that “we must overcome
our moral repugnance to decisive
intervention,” military and social
intervention in particular; and
that “intervention would, without
question, restore Asian confi
dence In American resolution.”
Both of these men seem to be
pointing out that positive and
comprehensive moves toward a
specific end are far more desir
able than indecisive action which
doesn’t cope with the full extent
of the problem.
Our conduct in Southeast Asia
is indecisive, not positive.
SOUTH VIETNAM is a moun
tainous jungle country bordered
by the South China Sea, Commu
nist-controlled North Vietnam,
and Laos and Cambodia. Its posi
tion is roughly like that of South
Korea, a hot-spot of Communist
infiltration; Red Chinese and
North Vietnamese guerrillas en
ter on the coast or through jun
gle trails from Laos or North
Vietnam.
Although the country would
react violently to direct troop
movement across the border sep
arating North and South Viet
nam, the neutralist regime of
Ngo Dinh Diem has not been able
to cope with the clandestine in
vasion, largely because of a lack
of popular support.
CONCERTED action taken in
two directions by the United
States could change the present
state of affairs. The United
States has had little success in
trying to persuade Diem to
change his unpopular policies, so
a withdrawal of U.S. support for
Diem and the backing of another

anti-Commist would scorn to be
indicated.

This, coupled with greater mili
tary intervention, would have
profound effects on the Commu
nist infiltration into South Viet
nam; guerrillas have never yet
been able to take over an Asian
country without first forming in
to larger, more easily combatted
units; and the topography of the
country is such that a small con
centration of well equipped
troops could choke off the infil
trator’s jungle and sea routes.
Action along these lines by the
United States in conjunction with
SEATO troops would be both ef
ficacious and welcome. A single
reinforced division, hacked up by
native units, would be able effec
tively to stop current Communist
movements.
THE CHINESE and North Viet
namese could react to such a step
with a major attack, which Ele
gant states would be limited by
production, transportation, and
topographical considerations to
an effective force of 100,000 men.
Such an attack, if mounted, could
be repelled by a smaller force by
holding supply and access routes.
The removal of Diem would be
welcomed by the South Vietna
mese, and indications are that
military intervention would be
taken as proof that the U.S. and
SEATO are not acquiescing in a
Communist takeover, an option
not infrequently voiced since the
U.S. backdown in Laos.
There is also some indication
that there might not be the great
Indian opposition that some ex
pect; in a recent conference with
Secretary of State Rusk, the In
dian foreign minister pledged
his country to more tolerance of
the United States’ relations with
colonial countries.
so THE administration’s new
strategy for coping with the prob
lem in South Vietnam, which in
volves social reform, physical se
curity for native villages, and a
step-up in South Vietnamese
guerrilla resistance, is a step in
the right direction.
All of these measures, how
ever, are of a long-range nature
and will need to he continued for
some time, as will economic aid.
They should be supplemented—
must be supplemented if they are
to work effectively—by decisive
military moves by U.S. troops
against Communist infiltration
and decisive intervention with re
gard to the Diem regime.
