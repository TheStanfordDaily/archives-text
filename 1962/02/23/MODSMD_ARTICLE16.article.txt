CIRCUMVENTION
Editor, The Daily:
As graduate women, we are in
terested in the discussion about j
student coed housing, and we j
wish to have our say in this con
troversy. . I
We are for coed housing.
Wo are for segregated housing, j
We are, in fact, for ANY sort of
housing. (Well, almost any.)
In fart, we are so much in
favor of housing that when we J
came to Stanford, we wanted a !
place to live.
SINCE WE submitted our ap- i
plications only 19 and one-half 1
months ahead of time, we were
notified that we were too late to
get into that mythical haven for |
35 and one-half graduate women, 1
Mary Posey Hall, named after
the first graduate suffragette at
Stanford. tMiss Posey, wo under- j
stand, a doctoral candidate sped-1
alizing in mechanics in heat,
camped in a sleeping bag on top
of Hoover Tower for 39 and one
half days before the administra
tion finally gave in. (They bought
her a tent.)
However, our booklet told us
that things had changed since |
Miss Posey’s day: Stanford had a ,
housing bureau for in-coming, i
out-state students. On arrival, we
went through the card file at the
housing bureau, and set out, I
blissfully confident that our
search would be a short one.
NOT WISHING to expect too !
much, we had no preconceived |
list of things we wanted. Eleven
hours, 123 Hertz-miles and six j
blisters later, we had a list ... I
of things we DIDN’T want:
(1) To live in a basement suite j
that doubles as a fall-out shelter. I
(2) To cook with the central I
heating, i.e., a wood stove.
(3) To share a bath and i
broken lock with six other grad
uate students (male).
(4) To rent two rooms and a
30-yard dash to the not-quite-ad
;joining bedroom.
(5) To live in an asylum for
unwanted dogs.
(6) To pay more than 60 dol
lars a month for any of the above 1

privileges.
We do not, wish to appear un- j
grateful to the housing bureau.
They cheerfully assisted us in j
every way possible, and their
Cardex file was, without doubt,
imaginative, ingenious and sad
istic. Next time we come to Stan
ford, however, we are going to
circumvent the housing problem.
We are going to be married,
undergraduates, or men (prefer
ably in that order).

RIDICULE
Editor, Tin* Daily:
Messrs, Weinig, Hermann, et
; al. of course have the right to
j ridicule whomever they choose.
However, their counterdemon
| stration on Monday would have
, been more effective if they were
| not so funny-looking.

DO SUGGEST
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Greenberg’s article, “The
: Truth about Chiang,” is a scath
j ing attack upon the Formosa
government. I will not deny that
the article is based upon certain
: facts exaggerated a bit, but
' tacts nevertheless.
However, I would prescribe as
an antidote John Fairbanks, “The
| United States and China” and A.
Daak Bennett, “Communist China
} and Asia”- two hooks which do
| not employ the sensational as a
j writing technique.
But far* more irritating is Mr.
| Greenberg’s assertion that Stan
; ford should not establish a center
j in Formosa because its political
| atmosphere is bad. First, who is
to be the judge of good and bad;
■ second, in what possible way
I could Stanford or its students be
j “harmed” by going to Formosa?
It seems to me that both of the
articles on the Formosan center
have ignored its major purpose.
The center is to be established to
facilitate the learning primarily
of the Mandarin Chinese lan
guage and learning something of
Chinese customs, culture and his
i lory by associating with those

who speak the language.
Now, if Mr. Greenberg can sug
gest a better place to which we

could go to study Mandarin
would ho ploaso do so?
