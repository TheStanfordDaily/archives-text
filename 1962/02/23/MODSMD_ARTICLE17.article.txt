# Card Cagers Visit Southland For Crucial Tilt With UCLA
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Stanford’s basketball team puts
its waning hopes for a Big Five
championship up at stake when
it plays league-leading UCLA
Saturday night in Los Angeles.
The Bruins trounced the Indians
in their only previous meeting,
82-04.
UCLA is definitely an offense
minded team. Its fast break at
tack features Johnny Green, the

best offensive guard in the i
league, averaging 22 points per j
game. Green, at fi-3, 185 pounds,
is a menace from all over the
court: he has a fine outside jump
shot, drives well, has enough
muscle to score inside, and is 78
per cent deadly from the free
throw line.
AX IMI'ORTANT factor con
tributing to Green's exploits is
the ball handling and playmak-!
ing of his hackcourt mate, Walt i
Hazzard. He is averaging a solid (

12 points, but more important,
ince he has assumed the leader
ship of the team, the Bruins have
been on a surge that has carried
them to a 7-1 record in league
play.
The UCLA front lino centers
around 6-5 Fred Slaughter, the
fourth leading rebounder in the
Big Five and a 10.0 sprinter and
a 6-3 high jumper. He consistent
ly swept the offensive backboard
in the Stanford victory and
scored an important 17 points.
The Bruin forwards are Gary
Cunningham and Pete Blackman,
both scoring around the 13-point
mark.

STANFORD CO AC If Howie
Dallmar considers “more alert
defense” to be the key to the
Tribe’s comeback. He stressed,
however, that if the defense con
centrated on Green, any of the
other four Uclans could get hot.
Not only must the Indians ap
ply defensive pressure to curtail
Hazzard’s passing, but they must
also control their defensive board
to prevent the Bruins from get
ting easy follow shots, inside.
SEVERAL NEW factors will
be in the Indian’s favor this time.
First, the game will be played
in the Sports Arena, whereas the
previous one was in Santa Moni
ca. The Indians will have the psy
chological lift of looking back on
their fine performance against
USC in the Arena.
Second, the Indians will be
fresh for this game, whereas the
last time they played the Bruins,
(hey had just come off a tough
Hattie against Troy. Conversely,
the Bruins have to play a surpris
ingly pesky Cal team the night
before they take on Stanford.
Finally, it is doubtful that
UCLA wall have the same kind of
50 per cent shooting again that
consistently cut off Indian rallies.
Coach Dallmar is very optimis
tic (hat his boys will play a vast
ly inproved game; certainly, all
these factor indicate that he will
not be disappointed.

best offensive guard in the i
league, averaging 22 points per j
game. Green, at fi-3, 185 pounds,
is a menace from all over the
court: he has a fine outside jump
shot, drives well, has enough
muscle to score inside, and is 78
per cent deadly from the free
throw line.

the ball handling and playmak-!

Hazzard. He is averaging a solid (

12 points, but more important,

however, that if the defense con
centrated on Green, any of the
other four Uclans could get hot.
Not only must the Indians ap
ply defensive pressure to curtail
Hazzard’s passing, but they must
also control their defensive board
to prevent the Bruins from get

SEVERAL NEW factors will
be in the Indian’s favor this time.
First, the game will be played
in the Sports Arena, whereas the
previous one was in Santa Moni

their fine performance against
USC in the Arena.
Second, the Indians will be
fresh for this game, whereas the

(hey had just come off a tough
Hattie against Troy. Conversely,
the Bruins have to play a surpris
