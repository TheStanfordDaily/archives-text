### 
The toughest game of the year
for tho Stanford frosh cagers is
on tap tonight, when the San
Francisco Presidio visits the
Farm. The game is scheduled for
the Pavilion at 8 p.m.

The Presidio features former
well-known college basketball
players, and one All-America hon
orable mentoin.
THE ALL-AMERICAN is Walt
Torrance, a flashy guard out of
Sacramento and UCLA, where he
led the Pacific Coast in scoring
in his senior year. The (1-2 guard
also high-jumped for the Bruin
track team.
The other guard is fi-2 Cleve
land McKinney. He had a cup of
coffee with the San Francisco
Saints before being cut just prior
to the opening of the ABL season.
Another man to watch will be
Clncinnatus Powell, who may at
tend Stanford after he serves his
hitch.
AGAINST THIS formidable op
position, Stanford will present
the same lineup that has carried
it on a four-game winning streak.
At forwards will be Jack Gil
bert, Bob Garner, and Frank- Ol
rich. Two of this fine trio will
start. The center is John Murray
and the guards are co-captains
Rod Young and Mike Priesler. In
reserve are center Craig Cordes
and guard Dick Ragsdale.
Murray apparently has found
the touch after a slump at the
start of the year. He totaled 27
points against Cal last weekend,
and did a great defensive job on

high scoring Cal center Mike
Henderson Saturday night.
GILBERT ALSO has regained
the scoring touch. He put in 18
points Saturday, mainly on long
one-handers. Garner and Olrich
are rugged on defense, and give
Stanford board control.
Young and Priesler keep the
defense honest with drives and
an occasional jump shot. Rags
dale provides a good replacement
at guard, and his accurate passes
loosen up the defense.
Cordes recently got the OK to
play after being sidelined with a
series of respiratory ailments. At
(> (i, he is a rugged rebounder, and
he possesses an accurate hook.

Torrance, a flashy guard out of
Sacramento and UCLA, where he
led the Pacific Coast in scoring
in his senior year. The (1-2 guard
also high-jumped for the Bruin
track team.
The other guard is fi-2 Cleve
land McKinney. He had a cup of
coffee with the San Francisco
Saints before being cut just prior
to the opening of the ABL season.
Another man to watch will be
Clncinnatus Powell, who may at
tend Stanford after he serves his
hitch.
AGAINST THIS formidable op
position, Stanford will present
the same lineup that has carried
it on a four-game winning streak.
At forwards will be Jack Gil
bert, Bob Garner, and Frank- Ol
rich. Two of this fine trio will
start. The center is John Murray
and the guards are co-captains
Rod Young and Mike Priesler. In
reserve are center Craig Cordes
and guard Dick Ragsdale.
Murray apparently has found
the touch after a slump at the
start of the year. He totaled 27
points against Cal last weekend,
and did a great defensive job on

high scoring Cal center Mike
Henderson Saturday night.
GILBERT ALSO has regained
the scoring touch. He put in 18
points Saturday, mainly on long
one-handers. Garner and Olrich
are rugged on defense, and give
Stanford board control.
Young and Priesler keep the
defense honest with drives and
an occasional jump shot. Rags
dale provides a good replacement
at guard, and his accurate passes
loosen up the defense.
Cordes recently got the OK to
play after being sidelined with a
series of respiratory ailments. At
(> (i, he is a rugged rebounder, and
he possesses an accurate hook.
