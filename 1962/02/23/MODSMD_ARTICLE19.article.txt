# Undefeated Ruggers Test Universities Club
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford’s undefeated varsity
rugby team meets its Toughest
test of the season tomorrow in
the form of the Universities Club
of Berkeley on the Card rugby
field at 3 p.m.
There will be no junior varsity
match, although there is a possi
bility that the Peninsula Ram
blers and the San Francisco
Olympic Club will meet on the
Stanford turf at 1:30, if no field
can be found elsewhere.
IN PRKVIOUS meets, the Uni
versities Club, made up primarily
of ex-California Bear ruggers, has
defeated St. Mary’s. 18-6, and
tied the Olympic Club, 3-3. Re
portedly, the Berkeley team also
downed Cal in a practice scrim
mage.
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
describes the Universities Club
as having a real strong scrum,
especially on line-outs. The visit
ing team is also blessed with
some fast backs, including Bobby
Brooks, called by the Card coach
as “possibly the best broken field
runner in rugby,” and Steve Kla

mara, who plays first t/%.
John Harrison, an Australian
playing scrum half, was a long
time stickout with the Cal squad
and is now doing his part to make
the Universities Club offense one
of variety and constant pressure.
Mike White, an all everything
while at California, is another of
the Berkeley stars. Dick Frazier
and Bob Brown, playing in the
second row, are also top ruggers
for the Universities Club.
FOR THE INDIANS, nearly
everyone is in top shape for the
Saturday clash. Only Jon Bran
din, out for the season with mon
onucleosis, and John Butler, who
strained his neck last week
against the Olympic Club, are
missing.
Butler’s slot will be taken over
by Keith Richmond. Otherwise
(he lineup for Stanford remains
the same as last week.
John Thomas. Troy Barbee,
Randy Vahan, Dick Leeuwen
berg, A1 Hildebrand, Richmond,
Steve Pursell and Tim Hansel
will play the forward positions
for the Tribe.
In the backfield will be Bob
Price, Tom McManus, Hal Steu
ber, Stan Lindskog, Clark Weav
er, Chuck Cobb and Rod Sears.
