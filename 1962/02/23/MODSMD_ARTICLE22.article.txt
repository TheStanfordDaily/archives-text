### TOM PARKER 
~~~“We-cerhrinly hope That those
clutch hits will be coming our
way this year,” were the words
of varsity baseball coach Dutch
Fehring. Last year’s squad lost
six conference games by one run,
one of them with 16 men left on.
“Problems, yet we have prob
lems. like losing nine lettermen,
leaving us without pitching
depth, especially left-handed
pitching depth. We lost our lead
off man, our clean-up hitter, our
first baseman, catcher, and three
pitchers.”
But things are really looking
up. Coming hack from last year’s
Varsity are pitchers, Darrell
Sutherland of basketball fame,
with a 4-3 record from last year,
Jim Smith, a footballer with a
9-4 record, and Mark Miller with
a 4-3 record.
THE FIRST VARSSTV game
will be Saturday, Feb. 24 with
University of San Francisco. Ac
cording to coach Fehring the
starting line-up will probably be
the following: 28, Skip Law
rence; CF, Tom May or Warren
Newall; 18, Jim Chenu or Jack
Allen; LF, Boh Hensler; RF,
Greg Post; 38, Rich Ferrazano;
C. Bob Overman; SS, Joel Shul
man, and Pitchers, Jim Lonborg,
Mark Miller, Jim Smith, and Jack
Wood. Sutherland won’t see any
game action till at least April.
In all there are five regulars re
turning from last year’s team.
“A lot of positions are up for
grabs, though.” says coach Feh
ring. “We have at least five up
and coming sophomores that
might be starting before the end
of the season.”
“I can’t really say that much
about the team as yet, since
we’ve been rained out for the last
two weeks,” says Fehring, “but
I do know that we’re in the
toughest league in the country,
and it’ll take a lot of hustling to
beat some of the conference
teams.”
In all there will be 36 Varsity
games, 18 J.V. games and 20
Frosh games. The Braves have al
ready played a game, beating Mo
desto J.C., 10-7 on Tuesday.

Stanford’s chances are better
against UCLA. The Bruins only
tied Cal earlier this year, while
Stanford easily beat the Bears.
Gaughran said that the Bruins
have a free-styler, Mike Brown,
who should give Bill Lorton and
Steve Hull (rouble in the sprints.

~~~“We-cerhrinly hope That those
clutch hits will be coming our
way this year,” were the words
of varsity baseball coach Dutch
Fehring. Last year’s squad lost
six conference games by one run,
one of them with 16 men left on.
“Problems, yet we have prob
lems. like losing nine lettermen,
leaving us without pitching
depth, especially left-handed
pitching depth. We lost our lead
off man, our clean-up hitter, our
first baseman, catcher, and three
pitchers.”
But things are really looking
up. Coming hack from last year’s
Varsity are pitchers, Darrell
Sutherland of basketball fame,
with a 4-3 record from last year,
Jim Smith, a footballer with a
9-4 record, and Mark Miller with
a 4-3 record.
THE FIRST VARSSTV game
will be Saturday, Feb. 24 with
University of San Francisco. Ac
cording to coach Fehring the
starting line-up will probably be
the following: 28, Skip Law
rence; CF, Tom May or Warren
Newall; 18, Jim Chenu or Jack
Allen; LF, Boh Hensler; RF,
Greg Post; 38, Rich Ferrazano;
C. Bob Overman; SS, Joel Shul
man, and Pitchers, Jim Lonborg,
Mark Miller, Jim Smith, and Jack
Wood. Sutherland won’t see any
game action till at least April.
In all there are five regulars re
turning from last year’s team.
“A lot of positions are up for
grabs, though.” says coach Feh
ring. “We have at least five up
and coming sophomores that
might be starting before the end
of the season.”
“I can’t really say that much
about the team as yet, since
we’ve been rained out for the last
two weeks,” says Fehring, “but
I do know that we’re in the
toughest league in the country,
and it’ll take a lot of hustling to
beat some of the conference
teams.”
In all there will be 36 Varsity
games, 18 J.V. games and 20
Frosh games. The Braves have al
ready played a game, beating Mo
desto J.C., 10-7 on Tuesday.

Stanford’s chances are better
against UCLA. The Bruins only
tied Cal earlier this year, while
Stanford easily beat the Bears.
Gaughran said that the Bruins
have a free-styler, Mike Brown,
who should give Bill Lorton and
Steve Hull (rouble in the sprints.
