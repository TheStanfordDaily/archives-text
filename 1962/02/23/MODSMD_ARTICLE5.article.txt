# 'American Colleges Soc. Subject'-Sanford

Every anthropologist want to
go to some island, preferably Ta
hiti, when fantastic customs and
traditions are going on under
their noses. There are extremely
interesting primitive customs
within the colleges themselves.
For instance, the daisy chain at
Vassar would be very rewarding
to an anthropologist.
Dr. Nevitt Sanford, speaking at
a fireside last night in the Muir
lounge on his book, The Ameri
can College, contended that a col
lege should be studied in its soci
ological context as “a productive
institution whose function is to
bring about some kind of change
in human beings.”

PSYCHOLOGISTS have never
studied students as students, peo
ple who are undergoing change,
but have merely invited sopho
mores to participate in experi
ments as specimens of the hu
man race, working on the as
sumption that character is al
ready determined in an 18-year
old.

But, Sanford contends, people
can keep on developing indefi
nitely, for development depends
on whether the individual is in
troduced to situations which re
quire new kinds of responses.
The problem of a university is
to make the student undergo the
kind of change that will contrib
ute to his growth, broaden his
perspective on the world and on
himself, and “bring him into con
tact with the deepest sources of
satisfaction within him.”

WHAT KIND OF challenges

do students face? Entering fresh
men don’t know what they can
do, said Sanford. Girls don’t
know how far they can go in
achieving themselves as inde
pendent personalities without
threatening their attractiveness
to the opposite sox.
Students entering college have
not experienced psychological in
timacy with another person be
cause they can’t do this until
they have a good grip on them
selves.

In his day, Sanford stated, the
confrontation of traditional re
ligious values with philosophy
was a great shock to students,
but now ‘students are very adept
at avoiding issues. They approach
ethical questions with a kind of
total relativity.”
IN FACING these challenges
personalities change and devel
op. and this is why the college
years are important. They are the
last chance for change.
A person has to be different
than he is in adolescence—if he
doesn’t change then he won’t
change at all. On the other hand,
Sanford said, this period is im
portant because we believe that
the longer the preparation for
life, the richer it will be.

For example, getting married
is not the same for a 16-year-old
high school girl as it is for a col
lege girl because it doesn’t hap
pen to the same kind of person.
Sanford believes that “finding
oneself and one’s career is the
most important thing one can do
and ought not be left in the hands
of some high school kid.”
Because college culture and ex
perience has so much effect, it
must be studied so that the
changes a college makes can be
controlled and directed.
