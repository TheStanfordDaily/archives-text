# Bachelors Arise It's Your Week!
## 
### 
Bachelor Week, the once-a
year reversal when the women
take the initiative and the men
don’t have to pay, is scheduled
for next week, February 26
through March 3, by its co-spon
sors AWS and the Junior class.
The King contest, the Bachelor
Week Dance, and opportunities
for the women to pay are official
features of the yearly ritual.
Voting for the women’s choice,
the King of Bachelor Week, will
take place on Engineering Corner
from 9:45 to 12:15 a.m., Tuesday
through Friday mornings. Each
women’s living group will nomi
nate a candidate at house meet
ing Monday night, and the names
of the lucky ones will be publish
ed in The Daily Tuesday.
The final result hinges not only
on voting but also on the contest
ant’s performance in the King’s
Games, the masculine counter
part of wel-known Stanford tra
dition, which will be held Friday
at Mama’s from 3 to 6 p.m.

Donuts and coffee will be sold
to couples by the Juniors at En
gineering Corner every morning
from 8:45 to 10:15. The girls must
pay. but to soften the blow the
five-cent cup of coffee is being
revived, and donuts will also go
at the cut rate of five cents
apiece.

Women with more daring can
take advantage of a Bachelor
Week twenty-five per cent dis
count offered to couples at Edy's
throughout the week.
The Red Vest Band will play at
an all-campus dance scheduled
for the Pavilion Saturday night
after the USC game, over which
the king will reign.
