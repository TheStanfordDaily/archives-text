# Engineering Here—Even for Women
## 
### 
National Engineers’ Week, February 18-
24, is a special week set aside to promote
engineering.
But on the Stanford campus, two girls
seem to be promoting engineering the year
round. Bonnie Madden and Nancy Calling
arc both enrolled as freshman engineering
majors:
“The attendance is always better with
them in class,” said P. Bulkeley, their me
chanical drawing instructor.
What’s more, these co-eds are serious
about Seeking a profession in engineering.
“After the boys discover we are serious,”
said Nancy, “and that we’re not here just to
find a husband, they treat us rather nice.”
“But every so often,” Bonnie added, “a
boy comes up to you and says ‘Arc you
REALLY in engineering?’ ”
AS MIGHT BK SUSPECTED, both girls
have members of the family who have
strongly influenced their career bent. Bon
nie's father, Baxter C. Madden, Jr. is a me
chanical-aeronautical engineer and Deputy
Hoad of Engineering Department, Pacific
Missile Range, Point Mugu, California.
Nancy’s late grandfather with whom she j
spent a lot of time was a civil engineer.
“My interest probably showed up in my |
early childhood,” Bonnie began. “I liked to I

build things—even out of my food . . . like
asparagus bridges for example.”
Bonnie expects to specialize in human en
gineering: Nancy, mechanical engineering.
Human engineering is increasing the ef
ficiency of engineering through studying the
limits of human performance. Bonnie's
choice of this specialization is the result of
her dual interest in medicine and engineer
ing.
“I’m really interested in medical instru
mentation,” Bonnie explained. “I’ve read a
lot about such things as installing batteries
inside hearts to enable heart patients to be
restored to an almost normal life.”
ONE OF THE MAIN criticisms an engi
neer copes with—both from outside sources
and within himself—is his field’s being too
narrow.
Two Stanford engineering students have
some ideas on how they can broaden their
viewpoints and become better englners.
“Take subjects in the humanities,” says
Bill Shurtleff,
"Travel ...” suggests Keith Woods,
Both students have recently returned
from studying at one of Stanford’s overseas
campuses and Shurtleff is the first engineer
ing major who has been accepted in the hu
manities program at the Palo Alto campus.
"Probably the reason I’m the first,” said
Bill, “is I don’t think any other engineering

major has applied. The extra work load adds
on another year to graduate but I think it's
worth it. These subjects in literature, psy
chology. and other areas really leach you
how to think.
“THERE ARE SO MANY people now who
know how to build bridges,” Shurtleff con
tinued, “but we need to have more who know
when to build them. This is especially true
of engineers building guided missiles. They
have a terrific responsibility.”
Undoubtedly a strong influence on Shurt
leff’s applying for the humanities program,
which requires a B average for admittance,
has been the studying abroad at Stuttgart
he and Woods completed. Although both
went at different times, each had similar
experiences.
“BEING AN ENGINEER,” Woods said,
“I sometimes get the feeling I’m trapped in
side the world of formulas and math. Now I
feel as if I’ve opened up after this experi
ence. 1 think I’ve grown and become more
contented.’
“Sometimes when guys arc over there,”
Shurtleff said, “they ask ‘ls engineering for
me?’ But if the answer is yes. they will have
a much better reason why, which will end
up giving them more purpose and goal.
“And along with all this learning,” Shurt
leff emphasized, “it’s a fantastic amount of
fun.”

ONE OF THE MAIN criticisms an engi

narrow.
Two Stanford engineering students have
some ideas on how they can broaden their
viewpoints and become better englners.
“Take subjects in the humanities,” says
Bill Shurtleff,
"Travel ...” suggests Keith Woods,
Both students have recently returned
from studying at one of Stanford’s overseas
campuses and Shurtleff is the first engineer
ing major who has been accepted in the hu
manities program at the Palo Alto campus.
"Probably the reason I’m the first,” said
Bill, “is I don’t think any other engineering

major has applied. The extra work load adds
on another year to graduate but I think it's
worth it. These subjects in literature, psy
chology. and other areas really leach you
how to think.
“THERE ARE SO MANY people now who
know how to build bridges,” Shurtleff con
tinued, “but we need to have more who know
when to build them. This is especially true
of engineers building guided missiles. They
have a terrific responsibility.”
Undoubtedly a strong influence on Shurt
leff’s applying for the humanities program,
which requires a B average for admittance,
has been the studying abroad at Stuttgart
he and Woods completed. Although both
went at different times, each had similar
experiences.
“BEING AN ENGINEER,” Woods said,
“I sometimes get the feeling I’m trapped in
side the world of formulas and math. Now I
feel as if I’ve opened up after this experi
ence. 1 think I’ve grown and become more
contented.’
“Sometimes when guys arc over there,”
Shurtleff said, “they ask ‘ls engineering for
me?’ But if the answer is yes. they will have
a much better reason why, which will end
up giving them more purpose and goal.
“And along with all this learning,” Shurt
leff emphasized, “it’s a fantastic amount of
fun.”
National Engineers’ Week, February 18-
24, is a special week set aside to promote
engineering.
But on the Stanford campus, two girls
seem to be promoting engineering the year
round. Bonnie Madden and Nancy Calling
arc both enrolled as freshman engineering
majors:
“The attendance is always better with
them in class,” said P. Bulkeley, their me
chanical drawing instructor.
What’s more, these co-eds are serious
about Seeking a profession in engineering.
“After the boys discover we are serious,”
said Nancy, “and that we’re not here just to
find a husband, they treat us rather nice.”
“But every so often,” Bonnie added, “a
boy comes up to you and says ‘Arc you
REALLY in engineering?’ ”
AS MIGHT BK SUSPECTED, both girls
have members of the family who have
strongly influenced their career bent. Bon
nie's father, Baxter C. Madden, Jr. is a me
chanical-aeronautical engineer and Deputy
Hoad of Engineering Department, Pacific
Missile Range, Point Mugu, California.
Nancy’s late grandfather with whom she j
spent a lot of time was a civil engineer.
“My interest probably showed up in my |
early childhood,” Bonnie began. “I liked to I

build things—even out of my food . . . like
asparagus bridges for example.”
Bonnie expects to specialize in human en
gineering: Nancy, mechanical engineering.
Human engineering is increasing the ef
ficiency of engineering through studying the
limits of human performance. Bonnie's
choice of this specialization is the result of
her dual interest in medicine and engineer
ing.
