HOW DO YOU RATE AS A
KOMAH
Is being a mothei your full
time job? Then you're no
better than a cave woman, ■
says Margaret Mead. In this •
week’s Saturday Evening Post, she
tells why the average housewife
is a flop as a woman. Shows how
smart mothers are encouraged to
be Dumb Doras. Tells why we
should stop picking on career girls
and spinsters. And advises women
how to get out of their rut.
