DUMB
GUYS CAN BE GOOD PITCHERS
-SAYS WHITEY FORD
Last year, Whitey Ford won 25
games for the Yankees. Yet he still
insists it doesn’t take brains to be
a winning pitcher. In this week's
Post, Whitey tells why one Dodger
pitcher with plenty of brains never
made the grade. Tells how he han
dles Al Kaline, Rocky Colavito, Jim
Gentile and other top sluggers.
And says why the beanball isn’t as
dangerous as it’s cracked up to be.
