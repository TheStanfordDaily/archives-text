# Berlin Exchange Student Tells Effects of the Wall
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This analysis of the Berlin
situation by Jtiorgen Lange, Free University
of Berlin Exchange Scholar, is presented as
part of the Berlin Week activities.)

Since the erection of the wall by the East
German government on August 13. 1961, Ber
lin has been the center of world attention. At
that time political leaders of the Free World
agreed that the danger of a military clash be
tween the world powers had never been great
er since the end of World War 11.
Even today, six months later, the situation
does not seem much improved.
Soviet encroachment on the Berlin air cor
ridors will presumably lead to a new peak of
the Berlin crisis.
For the citizens these approaches to the
isolated city are a matter of life and death
and conflict over their control could, if the
Soviets and Western powers do not find the
way to the conference table, load to military
collision.

What other implications, besides the ten
sions between the Soviet Union and the West
ern Allies, docs the wall have on life in Ber
lin?
POLITICALLY, the wall has only made
evident a situation that had prevailed before.
In Berlin, a symbol of divided Germany,
the hopes for an eventual reunification had
been vested. The city served an important
function as a meeting place for people from
the East and the West. The erection of the
wall demonstrated that hope for reunification
is illusory as long as the Communists rule in
Eastern Germany.
The economic implications of the wall are
of great importance. After August 13, 60,000
"Grenzgaenger”—cross-border commuters”—
who had been living in the Eastern part of the
city but were employed in West Berlin, were
cut off from their places of work.
The sudden loss of this labor group has had
serious effects on the industry of the city.
The growth rate of industrial production,

which had been higher than that of Western
Germany, retarded. In the months following
the erection of the wall, it became apparent
that West Berlin would be condemned to the
rate of a “dying city,” unless a continuous
flow of labor kept coming into the city.
The wall was not the primary cause of the
population movement from Berlin to Western
Germany. Before 1958, when the Berlin crisis
was provoked by Premier Khrushchev, people
had moved out of the city, but the population
had constantly increased because of the con
tinuous inflow of refugees.
But population statistics of Berlin for the
period 1958-61 show a gradual decline in the
number of inhabitants. In addition, the num
ber of unproductive inhabitants (65 and over)
is steadily increasing while the percentage of
productive workers (15 to 65) is declining.
THE SHIFTS in the population structure
were probably the most serious result of
Khrushchev’s 1958 Berlin ultimatum.
The problems caused by the “over-aging”
of the population can be solved only through

an increased influx of labor from Western
Germany or abroad. But the West German
labor market is already sold out completely
because of the prevailing full employment.
Since 1958 the number of people leaving
the city and seeking employment in Western
Germany has exceeded the number of people
coming into Berlin.
From August through October, 1961, 7,000
more people moved out of Berlin than moved
in. Appropriate measures will have to be—
and are being—taken by the German Federal
Government to secure a continuous flow of
young people into Berlin.
THE FIRST results of these measures can
West German students were recommended to
already be perceived in Berlin. The 200,000
spend a year of their university education at
one of the academically high ranking Berlin
universities. The reaction of the German stu
dent body was so spontaneously great that
both universities in West Berlin are now over
filled.
THE BUILDING of the wall between East

and West Berlin meant also a split In the cul
tural life of the city. Up to that time the East
Berlin population had been able to attend art
galleries, theaters, and universities in West
Berlin, just as the West Berliners attended
similar cultural events in the Eastern Sector.
This lively cultural intercourse between the
two halves of Berlin of course no longer is
possible.
Since the 13th of August Berlin is no
longer a symbol of the immediate reunifica
tion of Germany, and its importance to the
Gormans themselves—as a meeting place for
East and West—has been wiped out.
IF BERLIN is to be saved from the fate of
a dying city, political and military support
alone will not be sufficient. Isolated from both
parts of Germany, Berlin can only survive as
an “international city.” This implies that the
cultural and economics with the city have to
bo intensified. The fate of Berlin is so closely
related to the prestige of the Free World—
now more than ever—that we cannot afford
to sacrifice its freedom.

universities. The reaction of the German stu

and West Berlin meant also a split In the cul

Berlin population had been able to attend art
galleries, theaters, and universities in West
Berlin, just as the West Berliners attended
similar cultural events in the Eastern Sector.

two halves of Berlin of course no longer is

related to the prestige of the Free World—
now more than ever—that we cannot afford
to sacrifice its freedom.

Since the erection of the wall by the East
German government on August 13. 1961, Ber
lin has been the center of world attention. At
that time political leaders of the Free World
agreed that the danger of a military clash be
tween the world powers had never been great
er since the end of World War 11.
Even today, six months later, the situation
does not seem much improved.
Soviet encroachment on the Berlin air cor
ridors will presumably lead to a new peak of
the Berlin crisis.
For the citizens these approaches to the
isolated city are a matter of life and death
and conflict over their control could, if the
Soviets and Western powers do not find the
way to the conference table, load to military
collision.

What other implications, besides the ten
sions between the Soviet Union and the West
ern Allies, docs the wall have on life in Ber
lin?
POLITICALLY, the wall has only made
evident a situation that had prevailed before.
In Berlin, a symbol of divided Germany,
the hopes for an eventual reunification had
been vested. The city served an important
function as a meeting place for people from
the East and the West. The erection of the
wall demonstrated that hope for reunification
is illusory as long as the Communists rule in
Eastern Germany.
The economic implications of the wall are
of great importance. After August 13, 60,000
"Grenzgaenger”—cross-border commuters”—
who had been living in the Eastern part of the
city but were employed in West Berlin, were
cut off from their places of work.
The sudden loss of this labor group has had
serious effects on the industry of the city.
The growth rate of industrial production,

which had been higher than that of Western
Germany, retarded. In the months following
the erection of the wall, it became apparent
that West Berlin would be condemned to the
rate of a “dying city,” unless a continuous
flow of labor kept coming into the city.
The wall was not the primary cause of the
population movement from Berlin to Western
Germany. Before 1958, when the Berlin crisis
was provoked by Premier Khrushchev, people
had moved out of the city, but the population
had constantly increased because of the con
tinuous inflow of refugees.
But population statistics of Berlin for the
period 1958-61 show a gradual decline in the
number of inhabitants. In addition, the num
ber of unproductive inhabitants (65 and over)
is steadily increasing while the percentage of
productive workers (15 to 65) is declining.
THE SHIFTS in the population structure
were probably the most serious result of
Khrushchev’s 1958 Berlin ultimatum.
The problems caused by the “over-aging”
of the population can be solved only through

an increased influx of labor from Western
Germany or abroad. But the West German
labor market is already sold out completely
because of the prevailing full employment.
Since 1958 the number of people leaving
the city and seeking employment in Western
Germany has exceeded the number of people
coming into Berlin.
From August through October, 1961, 7,000
more people moved out of Berlin than moved
in. Appropriate measures will have to be—
and are being—taken by the German Federal
Government to secure a continuous flow of

which had been higher than that of Western
Germany, retarded. In the months following
the erection of the wall, it became apparent
that West Berlin would be condemned to the
rate of a “dying city,” unless a continuous
flow of labor kept coming into the city.
The wall was not the primary cause of the
population movement from Berlin to Western
Germany. Before 1958, when the Berlin crisis
was provoked by Premier Khrushchev, people
had moved out of the city, but the population
had constantly increased because of the con
tinuous inflow of refugees.
But population statistics of Berlin for the
period 1958-61 show a gradual decline in the
number of inhabitants. In addition, the num
ber of unproductive inhabitants (65 and over)
is steadily increasing while the percentage of
productive workers (15 to 65) is declining.
THE SHIFTS in the population structure
were probably the most serious result of
Khrushchev’s 1958 Berlin ultimatum.
The problems caused by the “over-aging”
of the population can be solved only through

an increased influx of labor from Western
Germany or abroad. But the West German
labor market is already sold out completely
because of the prevailing full employment.
Since 1958 the number of people leaving
the city and seeking employment in Western
Germany has exceeded the number of people
coming into Berlin.
From August through October, 1961, 7,000
more people moved out of Berlin than moved
in. Appropriate measures will have to be—
and are being—taken by the German Federal
Government to secure a continuous flow of
young people into Berlin.
THE FIRST results of these measures can
West German students were recommended to
already be perceived in Berlin. The 200,000
spend a year of their university education at
one of the academically high ranking Berlin
universities. The reaction of the German stu
dent body was so spontaneously great that
both universities in West Berlin are now over
filled.
THE BUILDING of the wall between East

and West Berlin meant also a split In the cul
tural life of the city. Up to that time the East
Berlin population had been able to attend art
galleries, theaters, and universities in West
Berlin, just as the West Berliners attended
similar cultural events in the Eastern Sector.
This lively cultural intercourse between the
two halves of Berlin of course no longer is
possible.
Since the 13th of August Berlin is no
longer a symbol of the immediate reunifica
tion of Germany, and its importance to the
Gormans themselves—as a meeting place for
East and West—has been wiped out.
IF BERLIN is to be saved from the fate of
a dying city, political and military support
alone will not be sufficient. Isolated from both
parts of Germany, Berlin can only survive as
an “international city.” This implies that the
cultural and economics with the city have to
bo intensified. The fate of Berlin is so closely
related to the prestige of the Free World—
now more than ever—that we cannot afford
to sacrifice its freedom.

situation by Jtiorgen Lange, Free University
of Berlin Exchange Scholar, is presented as

Since the erection of the wall by the East
German government on August 13. 1961, Ber
lin has been the center of world attention. At
that time political leaders of the Free World
agreed that the danger of a military clash be
tween the world powers had never been great
er since the end of World War 11.
Even today, six months later, the situation
does not seem much improved.
Soviet encroachment on the Berlin air cor
ridors will presumably lead to a new peak of
the Berlin crisis.
For the citizens these approaches to the
isolated city are a matter of life and death
and conflict over their control could, if the
Soviets and Western powers do not find the
way to the conference table, load to military
collision.

What other implications, besides the ten
sions between the Soviet Union and the West
ern Allies, docs the wall have on life in Ber
lin?
POLITICALLY, the wall has only made
evident a situation that had prevailed before.
In Berlin, a symbol of divided Germany,
the hopes for an eventual reunification had
been vested. The city served an important
function as a meeting place for people from
the East and the West. The erection of the
wall demonstrated that hope for reunification
is illusory as long as the Communists rule in
Eastern Germany.
The economic implications of the wall are
of great importance. After August 13, 60,000
"Grenzgaenger”—cross-border commuters”—
who had been living in the Eastern part of the
city but were employed in West Berlin, were
cut off from their places of work.
The sudden loss of this labor group has had
serious effects on the industry of the city.
