# LASSU Approves Coed Dormitories
## 
### FRANCES FISHER 
Last Thursday night, Legisla
ture approved the principle of
coed housing for Stanford and
appropriated money for voting
machines for the spring ASSU
elections.
The housing resolution which
passed easily although not unani
mously. gave LASSU’s approval
to an integrated housing system
for all but freshmen, with the
recommendation that the system
be put into effect by constructing
new housing facilities and/or alter
ing existing housing.
ROBERT MOORE Hall, which
has high priority on the PACE
building plan, has been considered
as an integrated dorm and Stern
has been considered for alteration
to permit coed living.
The resolution, presented by
Undergraduate Housing Commit
tee Chairman Rick Muller, recom

mended more specifically that
men and women should occupy
separate sections or wings of the
integrated housing center, while
sharing dining, library and social
facilities.
The Committee based their reso
lution on findings garnered from
letters to other universities which
have integrated housing presently,
talks with Dr. Robert Walker and
other faculty members connected
with the overseas programs where
integrated living is established,
and other sources.
These faculty members, Muller
reported, fell that coeducational
living would help to improve the
men’s attitude toward the women
—that it would help them over
come the prevalent emphasis on
looks.
These faculty members also
felt that coed living would mini
mize the organizational efforts
aimed at getting the men to mix
with the women and allow a more
natural means of contact.
KATY KNOWLES, representing
Branner, reported that 25 Branner
girls agreed to live in Stern next
year if the dorm is converted for
coed living; 55 Roble girls were
reported to have made the same
committment.
Next week the Housing Commit
tee will ask LASSU to request that
the University draw up plans for
the conversion of two houses in
Stern into an integrated housing
unit for next fall, the unit consist
ing of one men's and one women’s
house.
In response to the request of
Bob Adams, LASSU voted $250 to
defray the additional expense of
having eight voting machines for
the spring election.
All eight machines will be lo
cated in the Cubberley lobby, thus
limiting the usual array of polling
places to one. Since often ASSU
elections are so close that one or
two votes are decisive, the commit
tee felt that the "machines make
up $250 worth of human error”.

elections are so close that one or
two votes are decisive, the commit

up $250 worth of human error”.
Last Thursday night, Legisla
ture approved the principle of
coed housing for Stanford and
appropriated money for voting
machines for the spring ASSU
elections.
The housing resolution which
passed easily although not unani
mously. gave LASSU’s approval
to an integrated housing system
for all but freshmen, with the
recommendation that the system
be put into effect by constructing
new housing facilities and/or alter
ing existing housing.
ROBERT MOORE Hall, which
has high priority on the PACE
building plan, has been considered
as an integrated dorm and Stern
has been considered for alteration
to permit coed living.
The resolution, presented by
Undergraduate Housing Commit
tee Chairman Rick Muller, recom

mended more specifically that
men and women should occupy
separate sections or wings of the
integrated housing center, while
sharing dining, library and social
facilities.
The Committee based their reso
lution on findings garnered from
letters to other universities which
have integrated housing presently,
talks with Dr. Robert Walker and
other faculty members connected
with the overseas programs where
integrated living is established,
and other sources.
These faculty members, Muller
reported, fell that coeducational
living would help to improve the
men’s attitude toward the women
—that it would help them over
come the prevalent emphasis on
looks.
These faculty members also
felt that coed living would mini
mize the organizational efforts
aimed at getting the men to mix
with the women and allow a more
natural means of contact.
KATY KNOWLES, representing
Branner, reported that 25 Branner
girls agreed to live in Stern next
year if the dorm is converted for
coed living; 55 Roble girls were
reported to have made the same
committment.
Next week the Housing Commit
tee will ask LASSU to request that
the University draw up plans for
the conversion of two houses in
Stern into an integrated housing
unit for next fall, the unit consist
ing of one men's and one women’s
house.
In response to the request of
Bob Adams, LASSU voted $250 to
defray the additional expense of
having eight voting machines for
the spring election.
All eight machines will be lo
cated in the Cubberley lobby, thus
limiting the usual array of polling
places to one. Since often ASSU
