## 
### 
A fascinating debate is presently going on in the legislature of
the State of Virginia.
It concerns whether a book, “Race and Reason—A Yankee
View,” shall be made compulsory reading in Virginia schools.
Written by Carleton Putnam, “Race and Reason ...” provides
“proof’ that Negroes as a race are inherently inferior to whites.
Tlie book is now required reading in Louisiana schools.
Mr. Putnam’s credentials for writing such a book are unclear.
Ile has a science degree from Princeton and a law degree from
Columbia. Anthropology was not included in his course of study.
The American Anthropological Association unanimously adopt
ed a resolution in November saying Putnam’s theories are un
founded and saying, “ . . . there is not scientifically established
evidence to justify the exclusion of any race from the rights guar
anteed by the Constitution of the United States.”
Sen. Harry Byrd, the boss of Virginia politics, is distributing
the book through his office and hearings on a resolution in favor
of the book have been held by the Education Committee of the
Virginia House of Delegates.
The only speaker at the hearings in favor of the resolution was
its sponsor, William A. Pennington. Speaking in opposition to the
motion was J. Ruppert Picott, executive director of the Virginia
Teachers Association, which represents Negro public school
teachers, and a Mrs. Louise Winfield.
Mrs. Winfield asked the committee, “Do any of us . . . hon
estly want our children to be indoctrinated with the idea that they
are members of a super race?”
But there was little doubt that the resolution would be reported
favorably by the committee to the House.
Thus, politics, anthropology and the quest for truth in the
sovereign state of Virginia.
