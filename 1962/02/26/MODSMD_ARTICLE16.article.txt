“Popular Ethics in Ancient
Greece” by Lionel I. Pearson:
Stanford Press, $5.50, 262 pp.
By DANIEL C. BENNETT
Assistant Professor of Philosophy
Mr. Pearson’s declared object is
to sot forth the ethical considera
tion or principles on the basis of
which the ordinary ancient
Greek, and especially, the fifth
century Athenian, justified and
excused, criticised and commend
ed his own and others’ behavior.
This object he seeks to achieve
through an examination of the
literary productions of the fifth
century and of the literary tradi
tion still living in the fifth cen
tury, especially the Homeric epics
(from which the Greek young
learned their morality), but also
the poems of Hesiod, Theoguis,
Solon, et al.
However, I have a bit of diffi
culty identifying the ordinary
fifth century Athenian. By popu
lar Greek ethics Pearson seems
sometimes to mean non-philo
sophical ethics (which for him
means non-Platonic ethics).
But sometimes he seems to
mean non-literary ethics, for he
says of the tragedians, especially
of Aeschylus, and of the histori
ans, especially of Thucydides,
that they point out the “inade
quacies,” “Insufficiencies,” and
“inconsistencies” of popular eth
ics.

This seems to imply that the
ethics expressed in the tragedians
and historians is not popular, but
is, in some degree, a (better) sub
stitute lor the popular. In this
they are thought of by Pearson
as playing a Socratic role, of crit
icising, not of professing, popular
ethics.

The Platonic Socrates of the
“Republic,” Books I and 11, fig
ures centrally in Pearson’s dis
cussion. He takes Socrates’ at
tack on Polemarchus’ identifica
tion of justice with aiding friends
and harming enemies (‘returning
like for like’), and Thrasmyachus’
(confused) identification of jus
tice with self-interest, as expo
sures of inconsistencies in popu
lar ethics ... in the first in
stance, an inconsistency resulting
from acceptance of ethical prin
ciples which, when applied to
some action, yield conflicting ver
dicts, in the second instance, an
inconsistency resulting from ac
ceptance of some ethical princi
ple which, when applied to some
action, yields a verdict conflicting
with self-interest.

This reading of “Republic,” I TT,
constitutes the model for his
reading of the tragedies and his
tories. He looks for these Socrat
ic critiques in the non-philosophi
cal literature.

In the first place, it is by no
means clear that Plato in the
early books of the “Republic” is
criticising popular ethics in the
way Pearson represents him as
doing.

Plato is dissatisfied with the
I claim that justice is definable as
returning benefits or as self-in
terest, but this dissatisfaction is
not in itself a dissatisfaction with
the claim that returning benefits
I is just or that self-interest is just.
Indeed, on principal object of
the “Republic” is to establish that
what is just is in one’s interest to
do. Plato’s dissatisfaction is with
the popular inability to state the
essence of justice. But this in
ability does not by itself bespeak
ethical confusion any more than
the inability to define Number
bespeaks inability to count.
In the second place, supposing
j it is part of Plato’s purpose to
criticise popular ethical princi
ples as principles (rather than as
definitions), we should not ac
cept uncritically the claim that
because there can be a conflict
of obligations with one another
or with self-interest, there is an
“inconsistency,” “inadequacy” or
“insufficiency” in the set of such
obligations and principles.
This sort of claim is an expres
sion of the view that ethical prin
ciples must be universal, i.e. ap
plicable without exception, reser
vation or mitigation, a view
which Pearson takes to be the
philosophical view of ethical prin
ciples.
Of course, it is not; it is the
Platonic view, which portrays
ethics as a sort of geometric sci
ence. It should be contrasted with
the Aristotelian view that ethics
deals with matters which are
“only for the most part true.”
Pearson plays philosophical fa
vorites.

The main interest of this book
seems to me to lie in the analyses
which it offers of the tragedies,
histories and Homeric poems, as
literature, not as evidence for
popular ethics (which they un
doubtedly are), or as critiques of
popular ethics (which all of them
doubtfully are).
Pearson’s reading of Aeschylus’
plays as ethical arguments (self
contained in the plays); i.e. as
equitable weighings of conflicting
ethical goods and evils, is an in
teresting complement to, say, Kit
to’s readings of the same plays
as theological arguments.
Both readings, since they treat
the plays as literature, are useful
antidotes to the tendency to treat
them as something other than
literature- as degenerate form of
fertility rite, for example. Or,
for that matter, as critiques of
popular ethics.

tion still living in the fifth cen
tury, especially the Homeric epics
(from which the Greek young
learned their morality), but also
the poems of Hesiod, Theoguis,
Solon, et al.
However, I have a bit of diffi
culty identifying the ordinary
fifth century Athenian. By popu
lar Greek ethics Pearson seems
sometimes to mean non-philo
sophical ethics (which for him
means non-Platonic ethics).
But sometimes he seems to
mean non-literary ethics, for he
says of the tragedians, especially
of Aeschylus, and of the histori
ans, especially of Thucydides,
that they point out the “inade
quacies,” “Insufficiencies,” and
“inconsistencies” of popular eth
ics.

This seems to imply that the
ethics expressed in the tragedians
and historians is not popular, but
is, in some degree, a (better) sub
stitute lor the popular. In this
they are thought of by Pearson
as playing a Socratic role, of crit
icising, not of professing, popular
ethics.

The Platonic Socrates of the
“Republic,” Books I and 11, fig
ures centrally in Pearson’s dis
cussion. He takes Socrates’ at
tack on Polemarchus’ identifica
tion of justice with aiding friends
and harming enemies (‘returning
like for like’), and Thrasmyachus’
(confused) identification of jus
tice with self-interest, as expo
sures of inconsistencies in popu
lar ethics ... in the first in
stance, an inconsistency resulting
from acceptance of ethical prin
ciples which, when applied to
some action, yield conflicting ver
dicts, in the second instance, an
inconsistency resulting from ac
ceptance of some ethical princi
ple which, when applied to some
action, yields a verdict conflicting
with self-interest.

This reading of “Republic,” I TT,
constitutes the model for his
reading of the tragedies and his
tories. He looks for these Socrat
ic critiques in the non-philosophi
cal literature.

In the first place, it is by no
means clear that Plato in the
early books of the “Republic” is
criticising popular ethics in the
way Pearson represents him as
doing.

Plato is dissatisfied with the
I claim that justice is definable as
returning benefits or as self-in
terest, but this dissatisfaction is
not in itself a dissatisfaction with
the claim that returning benefits
I is just or that self-interest is just.
Indeed, on principal object of
the “Republic” is to establish that
what is just is in one’s interest to
do. Plato’s dissatisfaction is with
the popular inability to state the
essence of justice. But this in
ability does not by itself bespeak
ethical confusion any more than
the inability to define Number
bespeaks inability to count.
In the second place, supposing
j it is part of Plato’s purpose to
criticise popular ethical princi
ples as principles (rather than as
definitions), we should not ac
cept uncritically the claim that
because there can be a conflict
of obligations with one another
or with self-interest, there is an
“inconsistency,” “inadequacy” or
“insufficiency” in the set of such
obligations and principles.
This sort of claim is an expres
sion of the view that ethical prin
ciples must be universal, i.e. ap
plicable without exception, reser
vation or mitigation, a view
which Pearson takes to be the
philosophical view of ethical prin
ciples.
Of course, it is not; it is the
Platonic view, which portrays
ethics as a sort of geometric sci
ence. It should be contrasted with
the Aristotelian view that ethics
deals with matters which are
“only for the most part true.”
Pearson plays philosophical fa
vorites.

The main interest of this book
seems to me to lie in the analyses
which it offers of the tragedies,
histories and Homeric poems, as
literature, not as evidence for
popular ethics (which they un
doubtedly are), or as critiques of
popular ethics (which all of them
doubtfully are).
Pearson’s reading of Aeschylus’
plays as ethical arguments (self
contained in the plays); i.e. as
equitable weighings of conflicting
ethical goods and evils, is an in
teresting complement to, say, Kit
to’s readings of the same plays
as theological arguments.
Both readings, since they treat
the plays as literature, are useful
antidotes to the tendency to treat
them as something other than
literature- as degenerate form of
fertility rite, for example. Or,
for that matter, as critiques of
popular ethics.

ans, especially of Thucydides,
that they point out the “inade
quacies,” “Insufficiencies,” and
“inconsistencies” of popular eth
ics.

This seems to imply that the
ethics expressed in the tragedians
and historians is not popular, but
is, in some degree, a (better) sub
stitute lor the popular. In this
they are thought of by Pearson
as playing a Socratic role, of crit
icising, not of professing, popular
ethics.

The Platonic Socrates of the
“Republic,” Books I and 11, fig
ures centrally in Pearson’s dis
cussion. He takes Socrates’ at
tack on Polemarchus’ identifica
tion of justice with aiding friends
and harming enemies (‘returning
like for like’), and Thrasmyachus’
(confused) identification of jus
tice with self-interest, as expo
sures of inconsistencies in popu
lar ethics ... in the first in
stance, an inconsistency resulting
from acceptance of ethical prin
ciples which, when applied to
some action, yield conflicting ver
dicts, in the second instance, an
inconsistency resulting from ac
ceptance of some ethical princi
ple which, when applied to some
action, yields a verdict conflicting
with self-interest.

This reading of “Republic,” I TT,
constitutes the model for his
reading of the tragedies and his
tories. He looks for these Socrat
ic critiques in the non-philosophi
cal literature.

In the first place, it is by no
means clear that Plato in the
early books of the “Republic” is
criticising popular ethics in the
way Pearson represents him as
doing.

Plato is dissatisfied with the
I claim that justice is definable as
returning benefits or as self-in
terest, but this dissatisfaction is
not in itself a dissatisfaction with
the claim that returning benefits
I is just or that self-interest is just.
Indeed, on principal object of
the “Republic” is to establish that
what is just is in one’s interest to
do. Plato’s dissatisfaction is with
the popular inability to state the
essence of justice. But this in
ability does not by itself bespeak
ethical confusion any more than
the inability to define Number
bespeaks inability to count.
In the second place, supposing
j it is part of Plato’s purpose to
criticise popular ethical princi
ples as principles (rather than as
definitions), we should not ac
cept uncritically the claim that
because there can be a conflict
of obligations with one another
or with self-interest, there is an
“inconsistency,” “inadequacy” or
“insufficiency” in the set of such
obligations and principles.
This sort of claim is an expres
sion of the view that ethical prin
ciples must be universal, i.e. ap
plicable without exception, reser
vation or mitigation, a view
which Pearson takes to be the
philosophical view of ethical prin
ciples.
Of course, it is not; it is the
Platonic view, which portrays
ethics as a sort of geometric sci
ence. It should be contrasted with
the Aristotelian view that ethics
deals with matters which are
“only for the most part true.”
Pearson plays philosophical fa
vorites.

The main interest of this book
seems to me to lie in the analyses
which it offers of the tragedies,
histories and Homeric poems, as
literature, not as evidence for
popular ethics (which they un
doubtedly are), or as critiques of
popular ethics (which all of them
doubtfully are).
Pearson’s reading of Aeschylus’
plays as ethical arguments (self
contained in the plays); i.e. as
equitable weighings of conflicting
ethical goods and evils, is an in
teresting complement to, say, Kit
to’s readings of the same plays
as theological arguments.
Both readings, since they treat
the plays as literature, are useful
antidotes to the tendency to treat
them as something other than
literature- as degenerate form of
fertility rite, for example. Or,
for that matter, as critiques of
popular ethics.

Mr. Pearson’s declared object is
to sot forth the ethical considera
tion or principles on the basis of
which the ordinary ancient
Greek, and especially, the fifth
century Athenian, justified and
excused, criticised and commend
ed his own and others’ behavior.
This object he seeks to achieve
through an examination of the
literary productions of the fifth
century and of the literary tradi
tion still living in the fifth cen
tury, especially the Homeric epics
(from which the Greek young
learned their morality), but also
the poems of Hesiod, Theoguis,
Solon, et al.
However, I have a bit of diffi
culty identifying the ordinary
fifth century Athenian. By popu
lar Greek ethics Pearson seems
sometimes to mean non-philo
sophical ethics (which for him
means non-Platonic ethics).
But sometimes he seems to
mean non-literary ethics, for he
says of the tragedians, especially
of Aeschylus, and of the histori
ans, especially of Thucydides,
that they point out the “inade
quacies,” “Insufficiencies,” and
“inconsistencies” of popular eth
