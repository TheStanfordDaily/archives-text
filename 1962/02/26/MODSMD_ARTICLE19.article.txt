### VIRTUES SINS 
Kdllor, The Daily:
We have noted with profound
concern the recent development
of the possibilities for coeduca
tional living at Stanford. We
could hardly agree more with the
thoughts and feelings behind tins
movement. However we sympa
thize with Miss Davidson’s views
on getting into things too quick
ly-
Rather than risk the number

of uncertainties involved when
using such a large group as the
Stern Houses or Florence Moore,
we think that a more cautious
and certain way of accomplishing
the ends in view would be to uti
lize a small “pilot” group of se
lected individuals.
The common dining, study and
recreational facilities at our resi
dence in College Terrace are apt

ly suited for the type of coeduca
tional experience envisioned by
the men at Stern. We would be
more than delighted to discuss
the virtues and sins of such an
experiment with those persons
who have already expressed their
desires on the subject.
