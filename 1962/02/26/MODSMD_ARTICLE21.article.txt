# Ruggers Remain Undefeated By Beating Universities Club
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford’s varsity rugby team
remained undefeated this season
by whipping the Universities Club
of Berkeley by a 16-0 score on the
Stanford rugby field Saturday.
There was no junior varsity game.
THK WIN WAS the sixth this
year in regular season competi
tion and jumped the Indians’ un
defeated string to 13 in a row since
midway through last year.

For the first time this year, not
a single point was made via the
penalty kick route. This was main
ly due to (h > fact that a stiff cross
fied wind blew throughout the
match, blowing aside ill penalty
kick attempts.
Stanford opened the scoring
about 13 minutes into (lie first
half when first 5-8 Torn McManus
picked up a loose ball five yards
from the goal line and snaked into
the end zone to put the ball down
for a try.
STAN EINDSKOG added the
conversion from a slight angle and
against the wind to complete the
Tribe’s goal and send (hem into an
eary 5-0 lead, which stores up til
the halt.
Five minutes into the second
period, the Card ruggers almost
had another try when Chuck Cobb
was tackled in the Universities
Club end zone before he could
down th" ball.
The Tribe got the score back
10 minutes later, however, when
Tim Hansel went through the vis
itors’ defense for- a try after get
ting the ball from McManus on
another smooth play.
LINDSKOG ADDUD the con
version from right in front of the
goal posts to boost the Cards into
a 10-0 bulge.
Beau Bianchi scored (he third

Tribe try on a play that caught
everyone by surprise. As the Uni
versities Club backs tried to
mount up a passing rush, the
shifty Bianchi deftly stole the ball
right out of the hands of one UC
man and raced into scoring terr i
tory without a scratch.
Even though Lindskog’s conver
sion attempt was wide, Stanford
had the contest cinched with an
insurmountable 13-0 margin.
THK LAST SCORE of the day
was a try by Eric Smith on a 10
yard scamper. Smith’s score gave
the Tribe its 16-0 winning margin,
and the whistle sounded shortly
after to end the match.
The Universities Club was
stronger than the 16-0 score inch

oateri, according to Card coach
Pete Kmetovic. He pointed out
that the absence of their outstand
ing scrum half, George Harrison,
hurt the Universities Clubbers.
KMKTOVIC ALSO called atten
tion to the tough scrum play of
the visiting team.
In praising the efforts of his
own team, the Stanford mentor
mentioned the outstanding work
of McManus, Hansel, and Bianchi
among the backs. He also noted
the greatly improved play of Lind
skog.
The general impression was that
it was solid play on the part of
the Indians rather than a weak
. opponent that made the home
team big winners.

In other sports action over
the weekend at Stanford, the
Stanford swimmers defeated
Utah and UCLA, while losing
to lISC. The tennis team fin
ished second to Cal in tin*
Northern California Intercol
legiate Tennis Tourney, and
(he Stanford frosh basketball
team lost to (lie Presidio of
San Francisco 82-57. See the
Daily tomorrow for details.

CARD BACKFIELD ACE Stan Lindskog (21) boots the Indians out of
danger in the opening moments of Saturday's rugby match with the
Universities Club of Berkeley. Stanford won 16-0.
Stanford’s varsity rugby team
remained undefeated this season
by whipping the Universities Club
of Berkeley by a 16-0 score on the
Stanford rugby field Saturday.
There was no junior varsity game.
THK WIN WAS the sixth this
year in regular season competi
tion and jumped the Indians’ un
defeated string to 13 in a row since
midway through last year.

For the first time this year, not
a single point was made via the
penalty kick route. This was main
ly due to (h > fact that a stiff cross
fied wind blew throughout the
match, blowing aside ill penalty
kick attempts.
Stanford opened the scoring
about 13 minutes into (lie first
half when first 5-8 Torn McManus
picked up a loose ball five yards
from the goal line and snaked into
the end zone to put the ball down
for a try.
STAN EINDSKOG added the
conversion from a slight angle and
against the wind to complete the
Tribe’s goal and send (hem into an
eary 5-0 lead, which stores up til
the halt.
Five minutes into the second
period, the Card ruggers almost
had another try when Chuck Cobb
was tackled in the Universities
Club end zone before he could
down th" ball.
The Tribe got the score back
10 minutes later, however, when
Tim Hansel went through the vis
itors’ defense for- a try after get
ting the ball from McManus on
another smooth play.
LINDSKOG ADDUD the con
version from right in front of the
goal posts to boost the Cards into
a 10-0 bulge.
Beau Bianchi scored (he third

Tribe try on a play that caught
everyone by surprise. As the Uni
versities Club backs tried to
mount up a passing rush, the
shifty Bianchi deftly stole the ball
right out of the hands of one UC
man and raced into scoring terr i
tory without a scratch.
Even though Lindskog’s conver
sion attempt was wide, Stanford
had the contest cinched with an
insurmountable 13-0 margin.
THK LAST SCORE of the day
was a try by Eric Smith on a 10
yard scamper. Smith’s score gave
the Tribe its 16-0 winning margin,
and the whistle sounded shortly
after to end the match.
The Universities Club was
stronger than the 16-0 score inch

oateri, according to Card coach
Pete Kmetovic. He pointed out
that the absence of their outstand
ing scrum half, George Harrison,
hurt the Universities Clubbers.
KMKTOVIC ALSO called atten
tion to the tough scrum play of
the visiting team.
In praising the efforts of his
own team, the Stanford mentor
mentioned the outstanding work
of McManus, Hansel, and Bianchi
among the backs. He also noted
the greatly improved play of Lind
skog.
The general impression was that
it was solid play on the part of
the Indians rather than a weak
. opponent that made the home
team big winners.
