# Exhibit Displays Quantum Physics In Modern Art
## 
### 
An exhibit of parallel develop
ments in quantum physics and
modern art is on display through
today and tomorrow in Studio I
of the Architecture Building next
door to the Art Gallery.
The exhibit is only a model of
what John Solomon of architec
ture and David Stea of psychol
ogy plan to produce on a much
larger scale. According to Solo
mon the exhibit was originally
intended for the Seattle World
Fair, but it will probably be pro
duced for a tour of the nation’s
major universities.
The display show’s how the
modern artist uses an indetermi
nate distribution of his materials
to produce spontaneous, new
forms that cannot be achieved by
more conventional techniques of
free association and improvisa
tion. A layered painting by Keith
Wallace illustrates the gradual
control which the artist takes of
his materials as he builds upon a
bottom layer of randomly dis
tributed paint.
A sculpture by John Solomon
is assembled out of random
pieces of scrap from a junk pile.
Other exhibits describe new
ideas in city planning and the ap
plication of the uncertainty prin
ciple to music and architecture.
