# Debate Teams Nab Top Places In Tournament
## 
### 
Stanford Speech Association
members traveled to Stockton
over the weekend and came home
with nine of the top awards for
superior achievement at the
Northern California Forensic As
sociation winter tournament.
In the junior division, only
three debate teams wore unde
feated in the two days of compe
tition, and two were from Stan
ford. The teams with perfect rec
ords were Cary Coulter-Chan
Phillips and Judy Wilmorth-Ran
dy Willard. A third team which
received a top award was Doug
Thompson-Dick Grossman, with a
5-1 record.
In all, ton Stanfordites, all in
their first year of intercollegiate
debate, took part in junior divi
sion. The overall record was 25
wins out of 30, as Roger Green-
Ed Christenson and Kathy Ja
comb-Pam LaPlante c o m p i le d
creditable 4-2 win-loss records.

THE FROSH speakers did as
well, if not better, in individual
events. Willard and Roger Green
won superior awards in exposi
tory speaking Doug Thompson,
Ed Christensen, and Cary Coul
ter achieved the same distinction
in impromptu speaking.
In interpretation, Foster Hirsch
was rated first in all three of his
rounds, to rate the top award in
that category.

Stanford’s senior division de
bate teams both did quite respect
able jobs. Sophomores Don Boi
leau and Tom Ommon, moving
into senior competition for the
first time, won 4 and lost only 2.
Jim Woolsey and Bob Mackey,
who had never before debated as
a team, had the same record.
ALTHOUGH the tournament
was officially for northern Cali
fornia, that was not really indica
tive of the level of competition.
Teams also came from Hawaii,
Washington, Utah, and southern
California to take part.
The sweep was all the more re
markable because half the Stan
ford debate squad did not even
take part in the Stockton tourna
ment. but traveled to Tucson for
another meet. Results from that
tournament will be in tomor
row’s Daily.

creditable 4-2 win-loss records.

THE FROSH speakers did as
well, if not better, in individual
events. Willard and Roger Green
won superior awards in exposi
tory speaking Doug Thompson,
Ed Christensen, and Cary Coul
ter achieved the same distinction
in impromptu speaking.
In interpretation, Foster Hirsch
was rated first in all three of his
rounds, to rate the top award in
that category.

Stanford’s senior division de
bate teams both did quite respect
able jobs. Sophomores Don Boi
leau and Tom Ommon, moving
into senior competition for the
first time, won 4 and lost only 2.
Jim Woolsey and Bob Mackey,
who had never before debated as
a team, had the same record.
ALTHOUGH the tournament
was officially for northern Cali
fornia, that was not really indica
tive of the level of competition.
Teams also came from Hawaii,
Washington, Utah, and southern
California to take part.
The sweep was all the more re
markable because half the Stan
ford debate squad did not even
take part in the Stockton tourna
ment. but traveled to Tucson for
another meet. Results from that
tournament will be in tomor
