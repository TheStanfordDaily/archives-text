# Committee Proposes An Active, Alive Student Government
## 
### JOHN STEINBRUNER For The LASSU Constitution Committee 
(Editor’s Note: Tills is the last of three
articles on the proposals submitted to
I .ASSU by tiie special committee on the new
constitution and tile philosophy behind those
proposals.)

We have discussed in the previous two
articles the proposal that student govern
ment become active in the affairs internal
and external to the university. We have said
that student government will deal with in
ternal affairs by means of a structure rough
ly parallel to the present administration
structure and that it will deal with external
affairs by proposed affiliation with the Na
tional Student Association (NSA).

This latter proposal is supplementary to
the new ASSU constitution, but not a part of
it. We now wish to present directly some of

the differences between the old constitution
and the proposed new one.
IN THE NEW constitution there is a sep
aration of executive and legislative powers
(a separation which does not now exist) ef
fected by removing the ASSU president as
speaker of Legislature and by establishing
the speaker as another elected office. In ad
dition, legislature has been expanded (neces
sitating reapportionment) from 22 to 50
members.

Tlie idea behind these mechanical changes
is that this body will become representative.
By acting on executive proposals, it will take
official student body positions on the major
issues facing the University policy makers;
and it will have the option (which we hope
it will exercise) of mandating NSA delegates
on national and international student issues,
if affiliation with NSA is voted in along with

the new constitution.
IT WILL NO LONGER act as a police
man, approving every group which wishes
to organize. It will approve only those groups
using the name Stanford, or claiming to
represent the Stanford student body. The
new constitution, in a student bill of rights,
attempts to maintain, rather than limit, the
rights of groups and individuals to free in
quiry and responsible expression and action
on any subject.
The function of regulation now exercised
by the legislature will be taken over by the
student attorney general, an office created
by the new constitution, who will prosecute,
in the student courts any individual or group
violating the Fundamental Standard or the
constitution. The attorney general will also
interpret the constitution in regard to juris
diction of student courts in cases of violation.

HE WILL THEREFORE insure that ac
tion is taken in all cases reported, a function
which recent occurrences point to as needed.
He will maintain a file of standardized re
ports on all cases, and in conjunction with
council members will provide for necessary
retrials and appeals.
Ultimate judicial authority still rests, of
course, with the President of the University,
but a joint student-faculty court of appeals
has been established, hopefully to remove
from the Deans’ offices the onus of exercis
ing this Presidential review.
OBVIOUSLY, with Legislature taking of
ficial stands on University, national, and In
ternational student issues; wdth the Execu
tive department investigating the academic
operation of the University, collecting infor
mation, making reports, and advocating
changes; with the judicial councils actually

handling all reported cases of violation, the
charge that student government doesn’t do
anything will not be valid.
Student government under the new consti
tution will be pertinent to the interests of
graduates and undergraduates alike, and it
will bo necessary for students to participate
as constituents and to keep informed as to
what the student government is doing. Hope
fully this will lead to a more informed, more
active, more interesting campus.

If there are those who think that student
government should remain innocuous, as
Riesmann charges it is, who would rather
passively accept what happens to students in
the University and the nation without trying
to influence these events, then let them take
a stand and make their arguments known
lest they be compelled into action against
their will.
