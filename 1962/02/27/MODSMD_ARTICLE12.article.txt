## 'Catch-22' A Funny Tale 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
“Catch-22” by Joseph Heller:
$5.95, 443 pp.
This story is quite tragic, which
is why the reader hates himself
for laughing. Not that the reader
is sadistic. Heller makes you
laugh and one wonders why since
he obviously doesn’t think the
story is- very funny either.
The hero is Yossarian and he
has a problem. He lives in the
twentieth century. Which is not a
problem in itself but Yossarian
has the added disadvantage of
being sane.
Just about everyone else in the
bomber squadron on the little is
land near Italy seems reconciled
to his fate, which is to get blown
up or simply to disappear in a
cloud.
But Yossarian has this silly
desire to live and that is why he
hates the thousands of people ho
doesn’t even know who are trying
to kill him. And these thousands
of people are not all Germans
either. Colonel Cathcart, who
keeps raising the number of
missions Yossarian must fly,
wants to kill him.
So does General Dreedle, Doc
Daneeka, Milo Minderbinder, Ma
jor Major Major Major, Colonel
Korn, and a whole host of dedicat
ed, patidotic military men who
are really hypocritical, selfish,
and most of all, CRAZY.

To repeat, the story isn’t funny,
yet the reader laughs on several
occasions, mostly during the first
hundred pages or so.
But while Heller is making you
laugh he is also making his point;
the twentieth century is inhabited
by selfish, prejudicial, deceitful
animals, called human beings.

Take Chief White Halfoat, a
swarthy Indian from Oklahoma
who lias made up his mind to die
of pneumonia (“why not?”) Half
oat is pretty bitter because every
time he pitched his tent, the pale
faces would sink an oil well right
where he pitched it, forcing him
to move. But Halfoat is an ideal

ist: “Racial prejudice is a terrible
thing, Yossarian. It really is. It’s
a terrible thing to treat a decent
loyal Indian like a nigger, kike,
wop or spic.”

Or take Major Major Major
Major’s father, Major Major. He
was a rugged individualist who
held that federal aid to anyone
but farmers was creeping social
ism. His specialty was alfalfa,
and he made a fortune by not
growing any. “The government
paid him well for every bushel of
alfalfa he did not grow. The more
alfalfa he did not grow, the more
money the government gave him,
and lie spent every penny he
didn’t earn on new land to In
crease the amount of alfalfa he
did not produce.”
Then there was rich, young
Nately who never had a chance
because his mother “was a
Daughter of the American Revo
lution and his father was a Son
of a Bitch.”
But Heller suddenly shifts
gears. The message presented
with humor becomes a message
presented with sincerity. The
funny lines are still there but
Heller doesn’t mean them to bo
funny so you don’t laugh much or
not at all.
In the beginning you only sym
pathize wdth the poor, insane,
battleworn men. But soon you be
gin to empathize as you realize
that you also are trapped in the
twentieth century, that you are
insane.
You become a willing prisoner
as Heller analyzes men’s souls
stripped of their professed values.
You and Yossarian discover the
dying Snowden’s secret in his en
trails, oozing to the ground. “Man
was matter, that was Snow r den’s
secret. Drop him out a window
and he’ll fall. Set fire to him and
he’ll burn. Bury him and he’ll rot,
like other kinds of garbage. The
spirit gone, man is garbage.”
“Catch-22” is a tragic yet hu- i
morous novel. In the seeming'
contradiction between tragedy!
and humor we also see the seem
ing contradiction of life.
