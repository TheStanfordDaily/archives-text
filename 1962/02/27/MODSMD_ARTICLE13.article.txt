“LEGAL PROBLEMS”
Editor, The Daily:
Bob Saylor’s comment that
“Student self-discipline cannot
function without such a position
(Student Judicial Coordinators)”
is without doubt one of the most
overt bits of sophistry this stu
dent body has been expected to
swallow in a long time.
The mechanization and homo
genization of the “judicial sys
tem”—which is now luckily any
thing but a system—for which
Mr. Saylor’s new student dean
stands can only lead to a more ab
stract and inhuman approach to j
our petty legal situation than we j
have at the present.
How can one possibly achieve j
“self-discipline” if one is disci-1
plined? Few objects can assume [
the subject’s properties if the,
subject-object relationship is lin- j
ear.
Who is gullible enough to be-1
lieve that by separating counsel
ing and discipline between the |
dean and the mythical “students” |
vve shall come upon a more hu-!
man or equitable system- especi
ally since any valuable discipline
can only be brought about by
counseling? The atomistic, legal- j
istic mind has certainly been at I
work here.
To make a judicial system “run
smoothly” is to intensify the dis- |
cipline but helps the individual i
in no way whatsoever. To keep j
records for “standardization” will
no doubt help a smoothly running I
abstract system but will not help I
the person who is by no means |
“standard”—perhaps we have a j
few such among us.
Who is this god-like “initiator j
of action” going to be —perhaps
some appointment of a president
who is incapable of regarding law
in human terms? From whom '
would this new student dean be
“accepting complaints?” Who is
going to advise him, “advising
courts on reviewing cases han-1
died unsatisfactorily by lower |
courts,” which cases were han
dled “unsatisfactorily?” It would
seem that more than the students
are really in control of this “in
itiator of action.”
Lastly, we must realize that
handing discipline over to a stu
dent body, its appointed official,
and a set of judicial bodies is not
to give students “qua” humans

any additional “self-discipline” or
control over their own destinies
at all. Discipline—a very real
power—in this new system will
be but another step removed
from its human source which is
the dean within whom both coun
seling and disciplining must be
incorporated.
Let the dean handle his proper
functions, and let the students
have time to be students instead
of inexperienced lawgivers. Stan
[ ford’s “legal problems” can only
be solved by mature, experienced
| and intelligent deans whose ma
jor desire is to appreciate and
J work with the student.
| At the present time any fur
j ther abstraction of power and dis
j cipline will bring about only more
| hypocrisy and “bias” than we
have now. Students as humans
j will not in the end be robbed of
| their individual lives by a Man
} devillian homogenization of law
| for a homogenized community.

The mechanization and homo

Lastly, we must realize that
handing discipline over to a stu

to give students “qua” humans

any additional “self-discipline” or

stract and inhuman approach to j
our petty legal situation than we j
have at the present.
How can one possibly achieve j
“self-discipline” if one is disci-1
plined? Few objects can assume [
the subject’s properties if the,
subject-object relationship is lin- j
ear.
Who is gullible enough to be-1
lieve that by separating counsel
ing and discipline between the |
dean and the mythical “students” |
vve shall come upon a more hu-!
man or equitable system- especi
ally since any valuable discipline
can only be brought about by
counseling? The atomistic, legal- j
istic mind has certainly been at I
work here.
To make a judicial system “run
smoothly” is to intensify the dis- |
cipline but helps the individual i
in no way whatsoever. To keep j
records for “standardization” will
no doubt help a smoothly running I
abstract system but will not help I
the person who is by no means |
“standard”—perhaps we have a j
few such among us.
Who is this god-like “initiator j
of action” going to be —perhaps
some appointment of a president
who is incapable of regarding law
in human terms? From whom '
would this new student dean be
“accepting complaints?” Who is
going to advise him, “advising
courts on reviewing cases han-1
died unsatisfactorily by lower |
courts,” which cases were han
dled “unsatisfactorily?” It would
seem that more than the students
are really in control of this “in
itiator of action.”
Lastly, we must realize that
handing discipline over to a stu
dent body, its appointed official,
and a set of judicial bodies is not
to give students “qua” humans

any additional “self-discipline” or
control over their own destinies
at all. Discipline—a very real
power—in this new system will
be but another step removed
from its human source which is
the dean within whom both coun
seling and disciplining must be
incorporated.
Let the dean handle his proper
functions, and let the students
have time to be students instead
of inexperienced lawgivers. Stan
[ ford’s “legal problems” can only
be solved by mature, experienced
| and intelligent deans whose ma
jor desire is to appreciate and
J work with the student.
| At the present time any fur
j ther abstraction of power and dis
j cipline will bring about only more
| hypocrisy and “bias” than we
have now. Students as humans
j will not in the end be robbed of

} devillian homogenization of law
| for a homogenized community.

i ed as the site for coed living, in

Quite naturally we have devel

“LEGAL PROBLEMS”
Editor, The Daily:
Bob Saylor’s comment that
