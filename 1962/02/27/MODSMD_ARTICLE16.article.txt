LEFT-WING DANGER
Editor, The Daily;
Professor John Bunzel feels the
democratic process is endangered
by right-wing extremists such as
Robert Welch, as he indicated in
his Breakers’ address of Feb. 15.
There have been numerous ex
amples during the past twenty
five years of the dangerous effec
tiveness of left-wing extremists
le.g., Alger Hiss’ contribution to
the UN, W. Arthur Wieland’s con
tribution to communist Cuba,
communist contribution to the
San Francisco Riot, just to name
a bare few) and yet Professor
Bunzel chooses to write off the
Communist Party influence as a
“dismal failure.”
He prefers to concentrate on
the likes of Robert Welch, who
can boast of no riots or subver
sive coups and wdio can hardly
claim any effective influence, in
light of the quite general repudi
ation of his tactics by notable
right-wingers (e.g., Goldwater,
Nixon. Walter Judd, Russell Kirk,
F. Lewis, Jr., Wm. Buckley).
It might be that clever mass
handling has the Professor chas
ing the wrong threat.
If Bunzel feels danger in Mr.
Welch’s pronouncements per se,
his reaction is in conflict with the
traditional notion, which the Pro
fessor himself expressed, that “in
a democracy there are going to
be individual differences and in
dividual ideas (and they) must
be tolerated.”
Professor Bunzel was further
quoted, as stating in reference
to the democratic process, “When
the individual conscience is ele
vated to the point of principle,
majority rule is no longer effec
tive.” If the Professor leally be
lieves this rather arbitrary gen
eralization, one is forced to ques
tion his understanding of the
role played by principle in the
democratic process.
As a starter, it is suggested
that the Professor take note of
the short quotation by Thomas
Paine carried in The Daily title
block. Having done that perhaps
he might explain why one should
be so distrustful of principles
when they might help him defeat
the very rightist, authoritarian
element of which he is so afraid.
