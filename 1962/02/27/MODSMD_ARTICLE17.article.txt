Nights of Cabiria —Paris (Palo
Alto).
A Federico Fellini-directed film
of 1957, “Cabiria” has in primi
tive and more moving form some
of the spectacular horror scenes
of “La Dolce Vita.” Giulietta Ma
sina (“La Strada”) gives a bril
liant performance, using a funny
face to its best possible advan
tage.
Once More, With Feeling Me
morial Auditorium (Sunday).
Kay Kendall’s first and last
starring role as the wife to music
mad Yul Brynner in a velvet
house leaves no doubts that she’s
one of the screen’s finest comedi
ennes.
Tlie Devil’s Eye Guild (Palo Al
to).
Ingmar Bergman’s latest ef
fort is based on what he calls an
old Irish proverb, “A virgin is a
sty in the Devil’s eye.” Sounds
more like an old Bergman prov
erb. Anyhow, it’s a good flick.

The Californian— March.
When this muckraking maga
zine is at its best (as it is in this

ing pieces of journalism to be
found. A hair-raising documen
tary on the California Senate
Fact-Finding Subcommittee on
Un-American Activities, and an
interview with its chairman fill
up most of the issue.
New York Times Magazine —Feb,
18 (‘La Bella Italia’—Myths and
Truths).
Joan Marble, an American
who’s lived in Rome for 10 years,
evaluates conventional concep
tions of Italy, including food, cli
mate, "la bella figura,” the family
and the new Renaissance. Her
point of view is interesting: its
validity is questionable. The
length of the article makes a
great deal of what she says sound
superficial. Firenze-goers, past
and future, will at least enjoy the
photos.

tary on the California Senate
Fact-Finding Subcommittee on
Un-American Activities, and an
interview with its chairman fill
up most of the issue.
New York Times Magazine —Feb,
18 (‘La Bella Italia’—Myths and
Truths).
Joan Marble, an American
who’s lived in Rome for 10 years,
evaluates conventional concep
tions of Italy, including food, cli
mate, "la bella figura,” the family
and the new Renaissance. Her
point of view is interesting: its
validity is questionable. The
length of the article makes a
great deal of what she says sound
superficial. Firenze-goers, past
and future, will at least enjoy the
photos.
