### JUSTIN BECK 
Knocking off Utah, 51-43, and
UCLA, 61-33, in meets earlier in
the week, Stanford’s swimmers
ran into national power USC Sat
urday and dropped their first
dual meet of the season to the
Trojans, 69-25.
In (he first of three dual meets
in three days, the Indians were
very nearly upset by a supposed
ly mediocre Utah squad. Utah, in
a surprising showing, threatened
the home Stanford squad right
down to the final relay.
A DOUBLE WIN by Pete Pet
tigrew in the 200-yard individual
medley and the 200-yard hack
stroke, and wins by the 400-yard
medley relay team of Tom Red
fern, Dave Cladwell, Booth Hart
ley, and Pettigrew, and the 400-
yard freestyle relay tram of Red

fern, Bill Lorton, Tom Morgan,
and Steve Hull helped the Indians
prevent an upset.
Against UCLA Friday, Stanford
opened with a win with the 400-
yard medley relay team of Red
fern, Dave Pollack, Hartley, and
Con Kovas, only to have the
Bruins win the next five events.
However, wins by Hull in the 100-
yard freestyle at 53.1, Redfern in
the 200-yard backstroke at 2:13.8,
Lorton in the 440 freestyle at
4:51.3, and Pollack in the 200-yard
breaststroke and a Stanford win
by the 400-yard freestyle relay
team of Redfern, Pettigrew, Lor
ton, and Hull led to a final Indian
edge of 24 points, 61-33. In the
sweep of the last half of the meet,
Stanford outscored the home
team, 37-6.

AGAINST USC Saturday, it
was a far different story, as the
powerful Trojans won just about
everything in sight. Stanford’s
sole first place was by Dave Bar

num in diving, although Redfern i
took a second in the 200 back-

stroke, won by SC’s Bob Moulton |
in 2:08 Pollack took a second in i
the 200-yard breaststroke, won by !
Bobby Griesses in 2:23.2, and Hull ;
and Horton tied for second in the

fly in 2:03.6, and Murray Rose in
