# Stanford Netters Beaten By Bears
## 
### 
The Stanford tennis team fin
ished second in the Northern Cali
fornia Tennis Intercollegiates
held at San Jose last week.

Cal won the tourney with a
point total of 19. Stanford trailed
with nine. Only two other schools
entered in the meet scoring.
Cal’s Bill Hoogs beat team

mate Edgie Scott in the finals.
The top-seeded Hoogs had little
trouble in the tourney until he
ran into Stanford’s Yoshi Mini
gishi in the semifinals. Hoogs
dropped the first set, but eventu
ally won 4-6, 8-6, 6-2.

Scott started out on the trail
as an unseeded wonder, upset
ting Stanford’s John Isaacs in his
first match and toppling one
seeded player after another.
After Minigishi’s trip to the
semi-finals is considered, Stan
ford’s bright spot must be the ad
vance of two doubles teams to the
semi-finals. Both bowed to Cal at
that point.
Brad Hodgeman and Issacs lost
to Hoogs and Mike Farrell 6-3,
6-2, and Minigishi and George
Bates lost to Paul Welles and
Barry Baskin 6-1, 6-3.
In the freshman-Junior College
division, both Stanford singles
entrants lost in the semifinals,
Sheldon Boege lost to Cal’s Doug
Sykes 6-1, 6-2. John McPherson
was edged by Menlo’s Ron Preiss
man 4-6. 6-1, 6-4.
The frosh doubles combo of
Boege and McPherson lost in
straight sets to the Cal combo of
Kent Olsen and Bob Harper 6-4,
6-4.
