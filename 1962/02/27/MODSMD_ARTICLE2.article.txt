# Three Viewpoints On Berlin Offered In Panel's Talk
## 
### SANDRA SIMS 
“Three Views on Berlin,” the panel discussion which began
Berlin Week last night, was really one view of the Berlin situation
from three different angles.

Dr. Franz Brecr, West German Consul-General in San Fran
cisco, spoke on the history of the Berlin situation. Mr. Pierre

Basdcvant, French Consul-Gen
eral in San Francisco, clarified
the position of France and of
General DeGaullo concerning the
problem. Mr. Randle Reid-Adam.
British Consul-General in San
Francisco, “filled in the gaps” of
his colleagues’ talks.

THE PANEL discussion held
in Cubberley was moderated by
Dr. Gordon Wright, Professor of
History at Stanford. Wright set
the tone of the discussion with a
review of the problem as it stands
now, and a statement of the ma
jor suggestions for the solution—
move to assert our rights or just
stay as we are now.
Breer outlined the history of
the Berlin occupation from its be
ginnings in September 1944 until
the present time. He emphasized
that removal of Allied troops
from Berlin and its organization
as a “free city” would mean the
eventual destruction of the Bei
lin economy, which now depends
on the West for 80 per cent of its
$2 billion industry.

BASDKVANT stated that the
French are willing to go to a
summit meeting in a mood of co
operation, where the major prob
lems of the world would be dis
cussed, but think that at the pres
ent such a meeting is possible
only at the lower levels.
He said France doesn’t want to
bring the German problem to the
United Nations because of the re
cent Soviet attempts to weaken
that body, and doubt as to wheth
er the U.N. could handle the situ
ation. He stated that DeGaulle is
convinced there is no danger of
war over Berlin because Khrush
chev knows the Soviet Union
would suffer more than the West
in such a war.
UEID-ADAM emphasized the
unified policy of the Allies on
the Berlin situation. He said the
last vote in West Berlin showed
it solidly behind the West, and he
advised up to keep our heads, to
watch the facts and not to get ex
cited if the Allies seem to dis
agree because they will agree.

Berlin Week last night, was really one view of the Berlin situation
from three different angles.

Dr. Franz Brecr, West German Consul-General in San Fran
cisco, spoke on the history of the Berlin situation. Mr. Pierre

Basdcvant, French Consul-Gen
eral in San Francisco, clarified
the position of France and of
General DeGaullo concerning the
problem. Mr. Randle Reid-Adam.
British Consul-General in San
Francisco, “filled in the gaps” of
his colleagues’ talks.

THE PANEL discussion held
in Cubberley was moderated by
Dr. Gordon Wright, Professor of
History at Stanford. Wright set
the tone of the discussion with a
review of the problem as it stands
now, and a statement of the ma
jor suggestions for the solution—
move to assert our rights or just
stay as we are now.
Breer outlined the history of
the Berlin occupation from its be
ginnings in September 1944 until
the present time. He emphasized
that removal of Allied troops
from Berlin and its organization
as a “free city” would mean the
eventual destruction of the Bei
lin economy, which now depends
on the West for 80 per cent of its
$2 billion industry.

BASDKVANT stated that the
French are willing to go to a
summit meeting in a mood of co
operation, where the major prob
lems of the world would be dis
cussed, but think that at the pres
ent such a meeting is possible
only at the lower levels.
He said France doesn’t want to
bring the German problem to the
United Nations because of the re
cent Soviet attempts to weaken
that body, and doubt as to wheth
er the U.N. could handle the situ
ation. He stated that DeGaulle is
convinced there is no danger of
war over Berlin because Khrush
chev knows the Soviet Union
would suffer more than the West
in such a war.
UEID-ADAM emphasized the
unified policy of the Allies on
the Berlin situation. He said the
last vote in West Berlin showed
it solidly behind the West, and he
advised up to keep our heads, to
watch the facts and not to get ex
cited if the Allies seem to dis
agree because they will agree.
“Three Views on Berlin,” the panel discussion which began
Berlin Week last night, was really one view of the Berlin situation
