# Presidio Beats Frosh Cagers On Fast Break
## 
### 
The competition got a bit
rough for the freshman basket
ball team last Friday, as they lost
to a star-studded Presidio team,
82-57, at the Pavilion.

The Presidio squad boasted two
all-Americans and an ex-pro play
er. Walt Torrence, who was out
standing at UCLA as an all-
American, and Charlie Franklin,
who made just about everybody’s
first team when he played at Ore
gon, both played for Presidio.
The Indians, younger by an
average of four years, couldn’t
keep up with Presidio’s merciless
fast break, Stanford guard Rod
Young was faced with the task of
guarding three and four men at
once as the servicemen raced
down the floor time after time.
Cinclnnatus Powell of Presidio
led all scorers with 25 points,
while Torrence collected 14. Cen
ter John Murray got 15 points
and Jack Gilbert 11 for the Cards.

The win upped Presidio’s rec
ord .to 35-3, while Stanford’s
dropped to 10-3.
The Papooses face USE at the
Dons’ gym this Friday, and meet
the Santa Clara freshmen at the
Pavilion on Saturday. Stanford
edged USF. 48-46, in a previous
game and heat Santa Clara by a
convincing margin recently.
