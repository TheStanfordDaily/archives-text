# Berlin Week-Faschings Ball Tops Activities
## 
### 
A Faschings Ball Friday night
will top the social events of Ber
lin Week. The dance, open to all
I-Club, HR, and German Club
members and their guests, will
be held at the Chez Yvonne Res
taurant, 1854 El Camino, in
Mountain View'.
Einar Anderson and his band
will provide music from 9 until 1.
Stag or drag, the price is 35 cents
per person.

FASCHING, or Karnival, as it
is called along the Rhino, is the
festive German pre-Lenten cele
bration. Technically Fasching be
gins on the eleventh day of the
eleventh month, the eleventh sec
ond of the eleventh minute of the
eleventh hour. But things really
got rolling only after Christmas.
Parties cram the social sched
ule tighter and tighter. Finally,
the entire celebration is climaxed,
especially along the Rhino and in
southern Germany, by a wild two
days of parading, partying, and
singing on the Monday and Tues
day before Ash Wednesday.
IN STRICTEST keeping with
German Fasching customs, the
Stanford Faschings Ball will bo a
masked costume party. There is
no theme, so any kind of costume
is apropo.

A panel of honored judges will
award a prize for the most imagi
native costume, and at a certain
hour, everyone will un-mask.
