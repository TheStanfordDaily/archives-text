BARITONE JOHN ROBERT DUNLAP leafs through the pages of his
scrapbook recalling some of his experiences with great names of
the musical world: Koussevitsky, Toscanini, Eileen Farrell, Marion
Anderson, Dallapiccola and others. Dunlap is at Stanford to sing
the principal role of Riviere in the Stanford Opera Theater American
premiere of Luigi Dallapiccola's "Night Flight" opening March 1 for
a two week run in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Dunlap makes his San
Francisco debut shortly under Kurt Herbert Adler in the Spring Opera.
