# 'Vagabond' Travel Guide Goes on Sale Monday
## 
### 
The 1962 issue of “The Vaga
bond,” a travel guide for stu
dents, will be on sale March 5-9,
according to George Corfino, di
rector of the Stanford Overseas
Information Service.

The second issue of “The Vaga
bond” is much more comprehen
sive than last year’s effort, Cor
fino said, and contains specific
information on every country in
Europe and Asia open to Ameri
can travelers.
ALSO, sections on Africa and
Latin America have been added;
for the first time students may
have at their fingertips for com
parison first-hand reports on
travel conditions all over the
world.
Including the contributing staff,
“The Vagabond” represents first
hand travel experience in more
than 95 countries.
ABOUT HALF OF the issue is
devoted to travel in Europe since
there is move interest in this area,
but substantial sections deal with
the less-visited areas to show stu
dents what opportunities are
available there.
The booklet includes invalu
able information on where to
stay, where to oat, what to eat,
and how to travel—all inexpen
sively. Editor Dean Savage esti
mated “The Vagabond” could
save a student several hundred
dollars on a round the world trip
and enable him to cut his ex
penses in half in Europe if he is
an average tourist.

However the emphasis is not
just on having money, though
this is crucial for most students
and a central idea behind the
booklet. “The Vagabond’’ also
gives information on where and
how to meet other students and
people without seeming to in
trude, on some of the spectacu
larly unusual experiences waiting
for ambitious travelers—such as
staying in a Buddhist monastery,
and valuable general suggestions
on travel in the underdeveloped
areas and travel for women.

BUSINESS MANAGER Gary
Reagan stressed that “The Vaga
bond” is unique—-the only travel
guide published by students fa
miliar with travel problems and
chronic money difficulties for
other students who must face the
same problems.
“The Vagabond” will be on
sale next Monday through Friday
on Engineering Corner and at the
Postoffice. The 60-page booklet
sells for $l.OO.
