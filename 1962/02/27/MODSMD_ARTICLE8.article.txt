# Men’s Council, IFC Revise Procedures
## Student Groups Take initiative To Stop Campus 'Incidents' 
### 
Men’s Council and IFC Judicial Council last night issued
letters to all of the men’s living groups stipulating new discipli
nary regulations.
These regulations are meant to insure that the rash of “anti
social” actions which have occurred at Stanford within the last

few weeks will not be repeated.*
IN A JOINT statement pre
pared for The Daily, the two
groups outlined the types of ac
tivities that caused their action.
“Drunken driving, theft, lewd and
obscene conduct, and malicious
mischief” were cited.
Most of the recent incidents
took place on the Row, but
“Men’s Council and IFC Judicial
Council want it to be clear that
this statement is not meant to be
a blanket condemnation of the
fraternity system. Actually the
violations attributed to members
of fraternities are concentrated
in a minority of the fraternity
houses. This minority of individu
als is a black eye to the frater
nity system, the students, and the
university as a whole.”
The letter sent to the fraterni
ties stated explicit punishments
for explicit “anti-social” activities.
It stated that either lewd or in
decent exposure, or the presence
or breaking in of a women’s resi
dence would be severely punish
ed.
THE INDIVIDUAL could be ex
pelled from Stanford, and the fra
ternity, if found to be at fault,
could lose its social and rushing
privileges for as long as a year.
Jeff Dell-osso, chairman of IFC
Judicial Council, felt that these
new regulations would definitely
be effective. “The individuals and
fraternities know what the con
sequences will be if any more
such activities occur.”
The statement went on: “It is
time to climb out from under the
shield of the Stanford curve and
academic pressure. This is some
thing that every student is con
fronted with and yet the vast ma
jority are able to conduct them
selves in a relatively civil man
ner and not crumble to pieces.
“THE INADEQUATELY ad
justed remainder use the excuse
of pressure to the extent that
they feel they are not account
able to anyone for their actions,
no matter how far from the ac
cepted social code they happen
to stray.
“Men’s Council and IFC Judici
al Council feel the entire campus
should be aware of the problem.
The prevailing attitude in most
living groups is often one of un
concern about the irresponsible
minority where, instead, it should
be active in enforcing the will of
the majority.
“IDEALLY, the individual liv
ing groups should be able to in
fluence the few members who
constantly disregard the rights of
others. The living group has the
power to create an atmosphere
whore anti-social behavior is un
necessary and even unthinkable.”
The statement was concluded:
“Men’s Council and IFC Judicial
Council expect the prevailing at
titude to change for the better. In
any case, we are prepared to act.”

titude to change for the better. In
any case, we are prepared to act.”
Men’s Council and IFC Judicial Council last night issued
letters to all of the men’s living groups stipulating new discipli
nary regulations.
These regulations are meant to insure that the rash of “anti
social” actions which have occurred at Stanford within the last

few weeks will not be repeated.*
IN A JOINT statement pre
pared for The Daily, the two
groups outlined the types of ac
tivities that caused their action.
“Drunken driving, theft, lewd and
obscene conduct, and malicious
mischief” were cited.
Most of the recent incidents
took place on the Row, but
“Men’s Council and IFC Judicial
Council want it to be clear that
this statement is not meant to be
a blanket condemnation of the
fraternity system. Actually the
violations attributed to members
of fraternities are concentrated
in a minority of the fraternity
houses. This minority of individu
als is a black eye to the frater
nity system, the students, and the
university as a whole.”
The letter sent to the fraterni
ties stated explicit punishments
for explicit “anti-social” activities.
It stated that either lewd or in
decent exposure, or the presence
or breaking in of a women’s resi
dence would be severely punish
ed.
THE INDIVIDUAL could be ex
pelled from Stanford, and the fra
ternity, if found to be at fault,
could lose its social and rushing
privileges for as long as a year.
Jeff Dell-osso, chairman of IFC
Judicial Council, felt that these
new regulations would definitely
be effective. “The individuals and
fraternities know what the con
sequences will be if any more
such activities occur.”
The statement went on: “It is
time to climb out from under the
shield of the Stanford curve and
academic pressure. This is some
thing that every student is con
fronted with and yet the vast ma
jority are able to conduct them
selves in a relatively civil man
ner and not crumble to pieces.
“THE INADEQUATELY ad
justed remainder use the excuse
of pressure to the extent that
they feel they are not account
able to anyone for their actions,
no matter how far from the ac
cepted social code they happen
to stray.
“Men’s Council and IFC Judici
al Council feel the entire campus
should be aware of the problem.
The prevailing attitude in most
living groups is often one of un
concern about the irresponsible
minority where, instead, it should
be active in enforcing the will of
the majority.
“IDEALLY, the individual liv
ing groups should be able to in
fluence the few members who
constantly disregard the rights of
others. The living group has the
power to create an atmosphere
whore anti-social behavior is un
necessary and even unthinkable.”
The statement was concluded:
