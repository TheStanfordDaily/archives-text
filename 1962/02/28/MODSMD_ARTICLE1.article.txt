# Quarter System Smacks of High School, Says Prof
## 
### SAMUEL E. STOKES, ,JR. Assistant Professor of French 
(Professor Stokes’ provocative defense of
the semester system was solicited by Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow'. Stokes, on the
Stanford faculty since 1959, studied at Haver
ford and Columbia and was an instructor at
Amherst and Harvard before coming to the
farm.)

In writing a defense of the semester
system, I am fully aware of two things: (1)
that the quarter system has an advantage
in its unperturbed vacations (after all, learn
ing is only secondary, the sanctity of (he va
cation, the true goal, must be maintained)
and in the short time a teacher is obliged to
spend with a class (after all, what professor
who likes the quarter system really wants
to stick longer on a subject with a class);
(2) that all humans are creatures of habit.
Since I received my education under the
semester system, my preference for it is
naturally strong.

In an effort to he somewhat objective,
however, let us first look at the situation
from the student’s point of view. If a stu
dent is here to acquire knowledge, is ho like
ly to learn more from a course lasting 10
weeks or 14? Consider Shakespeare, for in
stance.

Secondly, does compression of knowledge
produce a better informed graduate? Yale
offers a year of Elementary Economics;

Stanford offers it in one quarter. In history,
Harvard undergraduates may take a year
course in English constitutional history to
the 17th Century; Stanford undergraduates
and graduates may take English constitu
tional history in one quarter. In French at
Harvard a student devotes one year to seven
teenth century literature, at Stanford one
quarter.
1 do not moan all courses should he a year
long. I do believe that compressing even 14
weeks’ work into 10 calls for haste and con
sequently less depth.
Thirdly, to make up for the shortage of
time at Stanford, courses meet more often.
I cannot speak for the sciences, but in the
humanities, would you as a student like to
have a day between classes to do the read
ing? In English and philosophy you meet
four times a week, in history and economics
five times. Do you have time to read
thoughtfully, to write a careful paper or two
along the way? As a matter of fact doesn’t
the routine of a class every day smack of
high school?
Colleagues, would students be able to par
ticipate in class discussion more intelligently
if they had more time to consider the ma
terial or even read an outside book on the
subject? Wouldn’t you have more time to
read original and secondary material?
Secondly, wouldn’t you be able to cover
your subject more thoroughly with an addi
tional two weeks of classes? If the answer
is no, I wonder what this implies. If there
were a reading period instead, I believe both

teachers and students would profit from it.
Let us look at final exams at Stanford.
The student may have to take an exam from
8 to 10 and start another fifteen minutes
later. A teacher is expected to turn in the
grades 72 hours later! The IBM machines
can’t wait!!
Now suppose you students are writing
an essay exam 15 minutes after a previous
one. Is your essay likely to be your best?
Do you really believe that if you are in a
class of a hundred your exam can be read
with much care, especially if the professor
has two sets of exams to correct?
If you seniors realize that the results of
an exam taken Wednesday afternoon in June
must be in by Thursday noon, you must
admit that careful consideration of your
exam is next to impossible and that at such
moments the quarter system becomes a
farce.
So much for the mechanics of the system.
In theory the quarter system was instituted
to allow students to get the A.B. in three
years. This is no longer possible because the
summer quarter contains only a skeleton of
offerings. If the theory is no longer valid,
its application is pointless.
Psychologically the quarter system mili
tates against the best education. Some stu
dents like it because they can sample more
subjects. Last year a student in Modern
European Literature, a program now dis
continued, liked it because it gave her “a
little bit of knowledge.”
This is highly characteristic of many stu-

teachers and students would profit from it,

dents who dabble and who take 10 to 12
units of new subjects each quarter. Dilet
tantism, which is encouraged by the quarter
system, has never been highly respected.
In another psychological way this system
is defeating. It is an old Pascalian concept
that man is most often thinking of yesterday
or tomorrow. In present-day America all
sorts of media strive to prevent us from
thinking about ourselves or the present.
At Stanford this inability to concentrate
on what is at hand turns up in planning va
cations six to eight woks early, wanting to
change final exam dates four weeks early,
planning for new courses three weeks ahead
of each quarter.
Meanwhile what is happening to the work
one should be doing NOW? Three times a
year at least everything almost stops for a
review of program and then a new start. It
is self-evident that a person who starts and
stops all the time does not get as far as one
who keeps going.

The combination of these two traits—
dilettantism and living in the tomorrow—
under the quarter system constitutes the
greatest detriment to learning which, as
Prof. Sanford has just pointed out, receives
little value already from our culture. The
semester system would not turn the tables
but it would certainly work in a positive
direction.

Stanford will never be Harvard, Yale or
any other place. It will remain Stanford
despite all the ink that has recently spilled
across the country. So I do not propose the

semester system because the leading uni
versities in the world have it.

I do propose, nevertheless, a semester
system analogous to Harvard’s because its
merits are applicable to any university. This
would moan having a 10-day reading period
after Christmas and a two-week reading
period in May. During this time those pro
fessors whose subject matter warranted fur
ther classes could hold them, those who pre
fer reading periods could have them. Stu
dents and teachers would be able to work on
their own, consult at leisure (attendance on
campus would be required), finish papers,
prepare exams and possibly reflect. This
period gives a student a chance to be on his
own, to apply self-control, to be mature.
The reading period would be fololwed by
a 10- or 12-day exam period with three-hour
exams, i.e., only two a day with two hours
in between. The faculty would have one
week from the date of the examination to
hand in the grades.
In general, under the semester system, a
student could stay a little longer with a sub
ject, learn more about it, have time to im
prove himself with less haste, write a solid
examination and be judged with more con
sideration. The success of PACE is essential
and desirable for the improvement of the
staff and the plant, but I believe the intel
lectual atmosphere can improve only if the
semester system is adopted.

Wouldn’t a little time for reflection and
self-education make the intellectual tone of
the university seem more adult?

with much care, especially if the professor
has two sets of exams to correct?
If you seniors realize that the results of
an exam taken Wednesday afternoon in June
must be in by Thursday noon, you must
admit that careful consideration of your
exam is next to impossible and that at such
moments the quarter system becomes a
farce.
So much for the mechanics of the system.
In theory the quarter system was instituted
to allow students to get the A.B. in three
years. This is no longer possible because the
summer quarter contains only a skeleton of
offerings. If the theory is no longer valid,
its application is pointless.
Psychologically the quarter system mili
tates against the best education. Some stu
dents like it because they can sample more
subjects. Last year a student in Modern
European Literature, a program now dis
continued, liked it because it gave her “a
little bit of knowledge.”
This is highly characteristic of many stu-

teachers and students would profit from it,

dents who dabble and who take 10 to 12
units of new subjects each quarter. Dilet
tantism, which is encouraged by the quarter
system, has never been highly respected.
In another psychological way this system
is defeating. It is an old Pascalian concept
that man is most often thinking of yesterday
or tomorrow. In present-day America all
sorts of media strive to prevent us from
thinking about ourselves or the present.
At Stanford this inability to concentrate
on what is at hand turns up in planning va
cations six to eight woks early, wanting to
change final exam dates four weeks early,
planning for new courses three weeks ahead
of each quarter.
Meanwhile what is happening to the work
one should be doing NOW? Three times a
year at least everything almost stops for a
review of program and then a new start. It
is self-evident that a person who starts and
stops all the time does not get as far as one
who keeps going.

The combination of these two traits—
dilettantism and living in the tomorrow—
under the quarter system constitutes the
greatest detriment to learning which, as
Prof. Sanford has just pointed out, receives
little value already from our culture. The
semester system would not turn the tables
but it would certainly work in a positive
direction.

Stanford will never be Harvard, Yale or
any other place. It will remain Stanford
despite all the ink that has recently spilled
across the country. So I do not propose the

semester system because the leading uni
versities in the world have it.

I do propose, nevertheless, a semester
system analogous to Harvard’s because its
merits are applicable to any university. This
would moan having a 10-day reading period
after Christmas and a two-week reading
period in May. During this time those pro
fessors whose subject matter warranted fur
ther classes could hold them, those who pre
fer reading periods could have them. Stu
dents and teachers would be able to work on
their own, consult at leisure (attendance on
campus would be required), finish papers,
prepare exams and possibly reflect. This
period gives a student a chance to be on his
own, to apply self-control, to be mature.
The reading period would be fololwed by
a 10- or 12-day exam period with three-hour
exams, i.e., only two a day with two hours
in between. The faculty would have one
week from the date of the examination to
hand in the grades.
In general, under the semester system, a
student could stay a little longer with a sub
ject, learn more about it, have time to im
prove himself with less haste, write a solid
examination and be judged with more con
sideration. The success of PACE is essential
and desirable for the improvement of the
staff and the plant, but I believe the intel
lectual atmosphere can improve only if the
semester system is adopted.

Wouldn’t a little time for reflection and
self-education make the intellectual tone of
the university seem more adult?

(Professor Stokes’ provocative defense of
the semester system was solicited by Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow'. Stokes, on the
Stanford faculty since 1959, studied at Haver
ford and Columbia and was an instructor at
Amherst and Harvard before coming to the
farm.)

In writing a defense of the semester
system, I am fully aware of two things: (1)
that the quarter system has an advantage
in its unperturbed vacations (after all, learn
ing is only secondary, the sanctity of (he va
cation, the true goal, must be maintained)
and in the short time a teacher is obliged to
spend with a class (after all, what professor
who likes the quarter system really wants
to stick longer on a subject with a class);
(2) that all humans are creatures of habit.
Since I received my education under the
semester system, my preference for it is
naturally strong.

In an effort to he somewhat objective,
however, let us first look at the situation
from the student’s point of view. If a stu
dent is here to acquire knowledge, is ho like
ly to learn more from a course lasting 10
weeks or 14? Consider Shakespeare, for in
stance.

Secondly, does compression of knowledge
produce a better informed graduate? Yale
offers a year of Elementary Economics;

Stanford offers it in one quarter. In history,
Harvard undergraduates may take a year
course in English constitutional history to
the 17th Century; Stanford undergraduates
and graduates may take English constitu
tional history in one quarter. In French at
Harvard a student devotes one year to seven
teenth century literature, at Stanford one
quarter.
1 do not moan all courses should he a year
long. I do believe that compressing even 14
weeks’ work into 10 calls for haste and con
sequently less depth.
Thirdly, to make up for the shortage of
time at Stanford, courses meet more often.
I cannot speak for the sciences, but in the
humanities, would you as a student like to
have a day between classes to do the read
ing? In English and philosophy you meet
four times a week, in history and economics
five times. Do you have time to read
thoughtfully, to write a careful paper or two
along the way? As a matter of fact doesn’t
the routine of a class every day smack of
high school?
Colleagues, would students be able to par
ticipate in class discussion more intelligently
if they had more time to consider the ma
terial or even read an outside book on the
subject? Wouldn’t you have more time to
read original and secondary material?
Secondly, wouldn’t you be able to cover
your subject more thoroughly with an addi
tional two weeks of classes? If the answer
is no, I wonder what this implies. If there
were a reading period instead, I believe both

teachers and students would profit from it.
Let us look at final exams at Stanford.
The student may have to take an exam from
8 to 10 and start another fifteen minutes
later. A teacher is expected to turn in the
grades 72 hours later! The IBM machines
can’t wait!!
Now suppose you students are writing
an essay exam 15 minutes after a previous
one. Is your essay likely to be your best?
Do you really believe that if you are in a

week from the date of the examination to
hand in the grades.
In general, under the semester system, a
student could stay a little longer with a sub
ject, learn more about it, have time to im
prove himself with less haste, write a solid
examination and be judged with more con
sideration. The success of PACE is essential
and desirable for the improvement of the
staff and the plant, but I believe the intel
lectual atmosphere can improve only if the
semester system is adopted.

Wouldn’t a little time for reflection and
self-education make the intellectual tone of
the university seem more adult?

(Professor Stokes’ provocative defense of
the semester system was solicited by Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow'. Stokes, on the
Stanford faculty since 1959, studied at Haver
ford and Columbia and was an instructor at
Amherst and Harvard before coming to the
farm.)

In writing a defense of the semester
system, I am fully aware of two things: (1)
that the quarter system has an advantage
in its unperturbed vacations (after all, learn
ing is only secondary, the sanctity of (he va
cation, the true goal, must be maintained)
and in the short time a teacher is obliged to
spend with a class (after all, what professor
who likes the quarter system really wants
to stick longer on a subject with a class);
(2) that all humans are creatures of habit.
Since I received my education under the
semester system, my preference for it is
naturally strong.

In an effort to he somewhat objective,
however, let us first look at the situation
from the student’s point of view. If a stu
dent is here to acquire knowledge, is ho like
ly to learn more from a course lasting 10
weeks or 14? Consider Shakespeare, for in
stance.

Secondly, does compression of knowledge
produce a better informed graduate? Yale
offers a year of Elementary Economics;

Stanford offers it in one quarter. In history,
Harvard undergraduates may take a year
course in English constitutional history to
the 17th Century; Stanford undergraduates
and graduates may take English constitu
tional history in one quarter. In French at
Harvard a student devotes one year to seven
teenth century literature, at Stanford one
quarter.
1 do not moan all courses should he a year
long. I do believe that compressing even 14
weeks’ work into 10 calls for haste and con
sequently less depth.
Thirdly, to make up for the shortage of
time at Stanford, courses meet more often.
I cannot speak for the sciences, but in the
humanities, would you as a student like to
have a day between classes to do the read
ing? In English and philosophy you meet
four times a week, in history and economics
five times. Do you have time to read
thoughtfully, to write a careful paper or two
along the way? As a matter of fact doesn’t
the routine of a class every day smack of
high school?
Colleagues, would students be able to par
ticipate in class discussion more intelligently
if they had more time to consider the ma
terial or even read an outside book on the
subject? Wouldn’t you have more time to
read original and secondary material?
Secondly, wouldn’t you be able to cover
your subject more thoroughly with an addi
tional two weeks of classes? If the answer
is no, I wonder what this implies. If there
were a reading period instead, I believe both

teachers and students would profit from it.
Let us look at final exams at Stanford.
The student may have to take an exam from
8 to 10 and start another fifteen minutes
later. A teacher is expected to turn in the
grades 72 hours later! The IBM machines
can’t wait!!
Now suppose you students are writing
an essay exam 15 minutes after a previous
one. Is your essay likely to be your best?
Do you really believe that if you are in a
class of a hundred your exam can be read
with much care, especially if the professor
has two sets of exams to correct?
If you seniors realize that the results of
an exam taken Wednesday afternoon in June
must be in by Thursday noon, you must
admit that careful consideration of your
exam is next to impossible and that at such
moments the quarter system becomes a
farce.
So much for the mechanics of the system.
In theory the quarter system was instituted
to allow students to get the A.B. in three
years. This is no longer possible because the
summer quarter contains only a skeleton of
offerings. If the theory is no longer valid,
its application is pointless.
Psychologically the quarter system mili
tates against the best education. Some stu
dents like it because they can sample more
subjects. Last year a student in Modern
European Literature, a program now dis
continued, liked it because it gave her “a
little bit of knowledge.”
This is highly characteristic of many stu-

teachers and students would profit from it,

dents who dabble and who take 10 to 12
units of new subjects each quarter. Dilet
tantism, which is encouraged by the quarter
system, has never been highly respected.
In another psychological way this system
is defeating. It is an old Pascalian concept
that man is most often thinking of yesterday
or tomorrow. In present-day America all
sorts of media strive to prevent us from
thinking about ourselves or the present.
At Stanford this inability to concentrate
on what is at hand turns up in planning va
cations six to eight woks early, wanting to
change final exam dates four weeks early,
planning for new courses three weeks ahead
of each quarter.
Meanwhile what is happening to the work
one should be doing NOW? Three times a
year at least everything almost stops for a
review of program and then a new start. It
is self-evident that a person who starts and
stops all the time does not get as far as one
who keeps going.

The combination of these two traits—
dilettantism and living in the tomorrow—
under the quarter system constitutes the
greatest detriment to learning which, as
Prof. Sanford has just pointed out, receives
little value already from our culture. The
semester system would not turn the tables
but it would certainly work in a positive
direction.

Stanford will never be Harvard, Yale or
any other place. It will remain Stanford
despite all the ink that has recently spilled
across the country. So I do not propose the

semester system because the leading uni
versities in the world have it.

I do propose, nevertheless, a semester
system analogous to Harvard’s because its
merits are applicable to any university. This
would moan having a 10-day reading period
after Christmas and a two-week reading
period in May. During this time those pro
fessors whose subject matter warranted fur
ther classes could hold them, those who pre
fer reading periods could have them. Stu
dents and teachers would be able to work on
their own, consult at leisure (attendance on
campus would be required), finish papers,
prepare exams and possibly reflect. This
period gives a student a chance to be on his
own, to apply self-control, to be mature.
The reading period would be fololwed by
a 10- or 12-day exam period with three-hour
exams, i.e., only two a day with two hours
in between. The faculty would have one

is no, I wonder what this implies. If there
were a reading period instead, I believe both

teachers and students would profit from it.
Let us look at final exams at Stanford.
The student may have to take an exam from
8 to 10 and start another fifteen minutes
later. A teacher is expected to turn in the
grades 72 hours later! The IBM machines
can’t wait!!
Now suppose you students are writing
an essay exam 15 minutes after a previous
one. Is your essay likely to be your best?
Do you really believe that if you are in a
class of a hundred your exam can be read
with much care, especially if the professor
has two sets of exams to correct?
If you seniors realize that the results of
an exam taken Wednesday afternoon in June
must be in by Thursday noon, you must
admit that careful consideration of your
exam is next to impossible and that at such
moments the quarter system becomes a
farce.
So much for the mechanics of the system.
In theory the quarter system was instituted
to allow students to get the A.B. in three
years. This is no longer possible because the
summer quarter contains only a skeleton of
offerings. If the theory is no longer valid,
its application is pointless.
Psychologically the quarter system mili
tates against the best education. Some stu
dents like it because they can sample more
subjects. Last year a student in Modern
European Literature, a program now dis
continued, liked it because it gave her “a
little bit of knowledge.”
This is highly characteristic of many stu-

teachers and students would profit from it,

dents who dabble and who take 10 to 12
units of new subjects each quarter. Dilet
tantism, which is encouraged by the quarter
system, has never been highly respected.
In another psychological way this system
is defeating. It is an old Pascalian concept
that man is most often thinking of yesterday
or tomorrow. In present-day America all
sorts of media strive to prevent us from
thinking about ourselves or the present.
At Stanford this inability to concentrate
on what is at hand turns up in planning va
cations six to eight woks early, wanting to
change final exam dates four weeks early,
planning for new courses three weeks ahead
of each quarter.
Meanwhile what is happening to the work
one should be doing NOW? Three times a
year at least everything almost stops for a
review of program and then a new start. It
is self-evident that a person who starts and
stops all the time does not get as far as one
who keeps going.

The combination of these two traits—
dilettantism and living in the tomorrow—
under the quarter system constitutes the
greatest detriment to learning which, as
Prof. Sanford has just pointed out, receives
little value already from our culture. The
semester system would not turn the tables
but it would certainly work in a positive
direction.

Stanford will never be Harvard, Yale or
any other place. It will remain Stanford
despite all the ink that has recently spilled
across the country. So I do not propose the

semester system because the leading uni
versities in the world have it.

I do propose, nevertheless, a semester
system analogous to Harvard’s because its
merits are applicable to any university. This
would moan having a 10-day reading period
after Christmas and a two-week reading
period in May. During this time those pro
fessors whose subject matter warranted fur
ther classes could hold them, those who pre
fer reading periods could have them. Stu
dents and teachers would be able to work on
their own, consult at leisure (attendance on
campus would be required), finish papers,
prepare exams and possibly reflect. This
period gives a student a chance to be on his
own, to apply self-control, to be mature.
The reading period would be fololwed by
a 10- or 12-day exam period with three-hour
exams, i.e., only two a day with two hours
in between. The faculty would have one
week from the date of the examination to
hand in the grades.
In general, under the semester system, a
student could stay a little longer with a sub
ject, learn more about it, have time to im
prove himself with less haste, write a solid
examination and be judged with more con
sideration. The success of PACE is essential
and desirable for the improvement of the
staff and the plant, but I believe the intel
lectual atmosphere can improve only if the
semester system is adopted.

Wouldn’t a little time for reflection and
self-education make the intellectual tone of
the university seem more adult?

(Professor Stokes’ provocative defense of
the semester system was solicited by Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow'. Stokes, on the
Stanford faculty since 1959, studied at Haver
ford and Columbia and was an instructor at
Amherst and Harvard before coming to the
farm.)

In writing a defense of the semester
system, I am fully aware of two things: (1)
that the quarter system has an advantage
in its unperturbed vacations (after all, learn
ing is only secondary, the sanctity of (he va
cation, the true goal, must be maintained)
and in the short time a teacher is obliged to
spend with a class (after all, what professor
who likes the quarter system really wants
to stick longer on a subject with a class);
(2) that all humans are creatures of habit.
Since I received my education under the
semester system, my preference for it is
naturally strong.

In an effort to he somewhat objective,
however, let us first look at the situation
from the student’s point of view. If a stu
dent is here to acquire knowledge, is ho like
ly to learn more from a course lasting 10
weeks or 14? Consider Shakespeare, for in
stance.

Secondly, does compression of knowledge
produce a better informed graduate? Yale
offers a year of Elementary Economics;

Stanford offers it in one quarter. In history,
Harvard undergraduates may take a year
course in English constitutional history to
the 17th Century; Stanford undergraduates
and graduates may take English constitu
tional history in one quarter. In French at
Harvard a student devotes one year to seven
teenth century literature, at Stanford one
quarter.
1 do not moan all courses should he a year
long. I do believe that compressing even 14
weeks’ work into 10 calls for haste and con
sequently less depth.
Thirdly, to make up for the shortage of
time at Stanford, courses meet more often.
I cannot speak for the sciences, but in the
humanities, would you as a student like to
have a day between classes to do the read
ing? In English and philosophy you meet
four times a week, in history and economics
five times. Do you have time to read
thoughtfully, to write a careful paper or two
along the way? As a matter of fact doesn’t
the routine of a class every day smack of
high school?
Colleagues, would students be able to par
ticipate in class discussion more intelligently
if they had more time to consider the ma
terial or even read an outside book on the
subject? Wouldn’t you have more time to
read original and secondary material?
Secondly, wouldn’t you be able to cover
your subject more thoroughly with an addi
tional two weeks of classes? If the answer
is no, I wonder what this implies. If there
were a reading period instead, I believe both
