# TO RAISE $100 MILLION
## How to Corner a Donor With PACE Instructions 
### NILS WESSELL Associate Editor 
Trying to get money from a
wealthy man Is like putting a
ring in a hull’s nose and leading
it around until finally you can
lake the ring off and let the hull
go free again. This is the way
one insider describes the tech
nique of raising $lOO million for
Stanford through the PACE cam
paign.
In order to got hold of the bull,
Stanford officials have set up a
complex network of committees,
subcommittees, kitchen cabinets
and chairmen who hunt up the
most likely and, of course, the
most wealthy prospects from a
long list of the nation’s most
promising philanthropists.
AND TO help these volunteer
committee members, the Univer
sity has published a 24-page bro
chure devoted to selling Stanford
to potential donors. The brochure
goes into great detail in its rec
ommendations for the technique
that volunteer money - raisers
should use.
The brochure warns the volun
teer that “a large gift is not se
cured by making one casual call
on a prospect. Successful solici
tation involves careful prepara
tion and negotiations.”
Preparatory work Includes
“studying the prospect” after
which PACE advises you on
“strategy and tactics” in sizing
up the prospect.
TO STUDY the prospect, “your
PACE regional office will pro
vide you with a summary ... of
his giving record for the last five
years, his total gifts to date and
his estimated giving capacity,”
Be careful, warns the University,
“(he general tendency is to under
estimate a prospect’s capacity
and willingness to give.”
Now that you know your man.
you stage a preliminary meeting
with him. Still, be cautious; “only
rarely does the preliminary ses
sion involve discussion of a spe
cific gift.” More appropriate at
this meeting are the standard
comments about “the general
role of private universities and
Stanford’s place in the nation and
the world.”
After this, the conversations
should get down to business.
“Avoid the timorous approach.
Heave basic materials . . . pre
sent the expert witness with spe
cial knowledge of the project un

dor consideration.”
THEN the brochure recom
mends that you use “additional
ammunition” in “keeping the do
nor’s sights high.”

“One of the most frequent ques
-1 ions in every campaign is, How
can a solicitor avoid taking a gift
of, say, $lO,OOO from a prospect
who can well afford to give $lOO,-
000? Here is an attempt to an
swer it. Preventive medicine is
always better than therapeutic
medicine. Therefore, we should
always try to avoid a situation
where a check for $lO,OOO is vol
unteered by such a donor . . .
Try to stimulate interest in the
purpose of the gift rather than
the amount.”

it he doesn’t swallow this medi
cine, the pamphlet suggests an
other less subtle remedy such as
offering to name a new building
after him if he will finance it. In
candor, (he pamphlet observes
that “those who really prefer
anonymity are in the minority.”
THE PACE brochure even an
ticipates a crisis. “If, however,
the donor is impatient with all
these negotiations and asks
abruptly, ‘How much have you
got me down for?’ ” then PACE

wants you to say that Stanford
must receive 15 gifts of $1 mil
lion and mon?, and about 150 gifts
of $lOO,OOO and more. To lessen
the blow, start talking about tax
deductions and even go back to
Stanford’s place in the world, if
you have to. (As a matter of
fact any man drawing an income
of $500,000 annually can make a
gift of $lOO,OOO at a net cost to
him of $9,000 since the govern
ment would take most of the
$lOO,OOO otherwise.)

Behind the amusing facade of
euphemism and cold-blooded an
alysis there is, of course, a dif
ferent and more indicative spirit
among the men working for
PACE.

ALREADY the benefits of their
work are evident: in the three
new endowed professorships, in
the construction of Tresidder Un
ion; in the announcement of a
grant to finance a new building
for physical chemistry; and in
the announcement of a grant to
build a new Faculty Clubhouse.
After nine months PACE has
raised $46 million (including $9
million from the Ford Founda
tion to match the $27 million
raised apart from Ford). Time
will not run out for Ford dollars
until September 1965.

the construction of Tresidder Un
ion; in the announcement of a
grant to finance a new building
for physical chemistry; and in
the announcement of a grant to
build a new Faculty Clubhouse.
After nine months PACE has
raised $46 million (including $9
million from the Ford Founda
tion to match the $27 million
raised apart from Ford). Time
will not run out for Ford dollars
until September 1965.
Trying to get money from a
wealthy man Is like putting a
ring in a hull’s nose and leading
it around until finally you can
lake the ring off and let the hull
go free again. This is the way
one insider describes the tech
nique of raising $lOO million for
Stanford through the PACE cam
paign.
In order to got hold of the bull,
Stanford officials have set up a
complex network of committees,
subcommittees, kitchen cabinets
and chairmen who hunt up the
most likely and, of course, the
most wealthy prospects from a
long list of the nation’s most
promising philanthropists.
AND TO help these volunteer
committee members, the Univer
sity has published a 24-page bro
chure devoted to selling Stanford
to potential donors. The brochure
goes into great detail in its rec
ommendations for the technique
that volunteer money - raisers
should use.
The brochure warns the volun
teer that “a large gift is not se
cured by making one casual call
on a prospect. Successful solici
tation involves careful prepara
tion and negotiations.”
Preparatory work Includes
“studying the prospect” after
which PACE advises you on
“strategy and tactics” in sizing
up the prospect.
TO STUDY the prospect, “your
PACE regional office will pro
vide you with a summary ... of
his giving record for the last five
years, his total gifts to date and
his estimated giving capacity,”
Be careful, warns the University,
“(he general tendency is to under
estimate a prospect’s capacity
and willingness to give.”
Now that you know your man.
you stage a preliminary meeting
with him. Still, be cautious; “only
rarely does the preliminary ses
sion involve discussion of a spe
cific gift.” More appropriate at
this meeting are the standard
comments about “the general
role of private universities and
Stanford’s place in the nation and
the world.”
After this, the conversations
should get down to business.
“Avoid the timorous approach.
Heave basic materials . . . pre
sent the expert witness with spe
cial knowledge of the project un

dor consideration.”
THEN the brochure recom
mends that you use “additional
ammunition” in “keeping the do
nor’s sights high.”

“One of the most frequent ques
-1 ions in every campaign is, How
can a solicitor avoid taking a gift
of, say, $lO,OOO from a prospect
who can well afford to give $lOO,-
000? Here is an attempt to an
swer it. Preventive medicine is
always better than therapeutic
medicine. Therefore, we should
always try to avoid a situation
where a check for $lO,OOO is vol
unteered by such a donor . . .
Try to stimulate interest in the
purpose of the gift rather than
the amount.”

it he doesn’t swallow this medi
cine, the pamphlet suggests an
other less subtle remedy such as
offering to name a new building
after him if he will finance it. In
candor, (he pamphlet observes
that “those who really prefer
anonymity are in the minority.”
THE PACE brochure even an
ticipates a crisis. “If, however,
the donor is impatient with all
these negotiations and asks
abruptly, ‘How much have you
got me down for?’ ” then PACE

wants you to say that Stanford
must receive 15 gifts of $1 mil
lion and mon?, and about 150 gifts
of $lOO,OOO and more. To lessen
the blow, start talking about tax
deductions and even go back to
Stanford’s place in the world, if
you have to. (As a matter of
fact any man drawing an income
of $500,000 annually can make a
gift of $lOO,OOO at a net cost to
him of $9,000 since the govern
ment would take most of the
$lOO,OOO otherwise.)

Behind the amusing facade of
euphemism and cold-blooded an
alysis there is, of course, a dif
ferent and more indicative spirit
among the men working for
PACE.

ALREADY the benefits of their
work are evident: in the three

him of $9,000 since the govern
ment would take most of the
$lOO,OOO otherwise.)

Behind the amusing facade of
euphemism and cold-blooded an
alysis there is, of course, a dif
ferent and more indicative spirit
among the men working for
PACE.

ALREADY the benefits of their
work are evident: in the three
new endowed professorships, in
the construction of Tresidder Un
ion; in the announcement of a
grant to finance a new building
for physical chemistry; and in
the announcement of a grant to
build a new Faculty Clubhouse.
After nine months PACE has
raised $46 million (including $9
million from the Ford Founda
tion to match the $27 million
raised apart from Ford). Time
will not run out for Ford dollars
until September 1965.
Trying to get money from a
wealthy man Is like putting a
ring in a hull’s nose and leading
it around until finally you can
lake the ring off and let the hull
go free again. This is the way
one insider describes the tech
nique of raising $lOO million for
Stanford through the PACE cam
paign.
In order to got hold of the bull,
Stanford officials have set up a
complex network of committees,
subcommittees, kitchen cabinets
and chairmen who hunt up the
most likely and, of course, the
most wealthy prospects from a
long list of the nation’s most
promising philanthropists.
AND TO help these volunteer
committee members, the Univer
sity has published a 24-page bro
chure devoted to selling Stanford
to potential donors. The brochure
goes into great detail in its rec
ommendations for the technique
that volunteer money - raisers
should use.
The brochure warns the volun
teer that “a large gift is not se
cured by making one casual call
on a prospect. Successful solici
tation involves careful prepara
tion and negotiations.”
Preparatory work Includes
“studying the prospect” after
which PACE advises you on
“strategy and tactics” in sizing
up the prospect.
TO STUDY the prospect, “your
PACE regional office will pro
vide you with a summary ... of
his giving record for the last five
years, his total gifts to date and
his estimated giving capacity,”
Be careful, warns the University,
“(he general tendency is to under
estimate a prospect’s capacity
and willingness to give.”
Now that you know your man.
you stage a preliminary meeting
with him. Still, be cautious; “only
rarely does the preliminary ses
sion involve discussion of a spe
cific gift.” More appropriate at
this meeting are the standard
comments about “the general
role of private universities and
Stanford’s place in the nation and
the world.”
After this, the conversations
should get down to business.
“Avoid the timorous approach.
Heave basic materials . . . pre
sent the expert witness with spe
cial knowledge of the project un

dor consideration.”
THEN the brochure recom
mends that you use “additional
ammunition” in “keeping the do
nor’s sights high.”

“One of the most frequent ques
-1 ions in every campaign is, How
can a solicitor avoid taking a gift
of, say, $lO,OOO from a prospect
who can well afford to give $lOO,-
000? Here is an attempt to an
swer it. Preventive medicine is
always better than therapeutic
medicine. Therefore, we should
always try to avoid a situation
where a check for $lO,OOO is vol
unteered by such a donor . . .
Try to stimulate interest in the
purpose of the gift rather than
the amount.”

it he doesn’t swallow this medi
cine, the pamphlet suggests an
other less subtle remedy such as
offering to name a new building
after him if he will finance it. In
candor, (he pamphlet observes
that “those who really prefer
anonymity are in the minority.”
THE PACE brochure even an
ticipates a crisis. “If, however,
the donor is impatient with all
these negotiations and asks
abruptly, ‘How much have you
got me down for?’ ” then PACE

wants you to say that Stanford
must receive 15 gifts of $1 mil
lion and mon?, and about 150 gifts
of $lOO,OOO and more. To lessen
the blow, start talking about tax
deductions and even go back to
Stanford’s place in the world, if
you have to. (As a matter of
fact any man drawing an income
of $500,000 annually can make a
gift of $lOO,OOO at a net cost to
him of $9,000 since the govern
ment would take most of the
$lOO,OOO otherwise.)
