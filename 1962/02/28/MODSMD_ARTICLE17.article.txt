# MAKEBA CONCERT
## The
						Unsurprising Reception 
### 
A surprisingly large and un
surprisingly enthusiastic audi
ence greeted South African folk
singer Miriam Makeba and the
Chad Mitchell Trio in Memorial
Auditorium Monday night.

Miss Makeba combines a beau
tiful and husky voice with some
impossible-sounding phonetics in
the singing of her native music.
The “Click” song is the most in
credible of these, as, while she
sings, Miss Makeba produces a
sound roughly comparable to
castanets by some manipulation
of her tongue (or maybe her
eyes; who knows?).
AS FOR the Chad Mitchell
Trio, it took about a song and a
half for these three collegians to
overcome whatever “Not another
Kingston Trio, I hope” sentiment
there may have been in the audi
ence.

Professional in their approach
to their music, the trio foregoes
tricky harmonizing and arrange
ments (as well as guitars), and
instead emphasizes the words
and melody of several different
types of songs.

After warming up with several
well-chosen American folk songs,
the trio moved into (he area of
social criticism. And here they
I’eally hit their stride.

A MAGNIFICENTLY funny
piece called “The John Birch
Society” not only brought a thun
derous response, but also the
unusual feeling of wishing they’d
sing it again. It was the hit of
the night.
Not far behind were “Away
with Rum” (the song of the
WCTU) and a parody on “The
Twelve Days of Christmas”
brought up to date with a setting
in West Berlin. (“On the eighth
day of Christmas, my true love
gave to me ... a Telefunken H-
Bomb—lt looks like a radio, ex
cept when you’re trying to get
England, you’re trying to GET
England.”)
AS A FINISH Miss Makeba
and the trio together sang “Wi
moweh” as it may never be sung
again. You expected the lion to
come out onto the stage at any
moment.
