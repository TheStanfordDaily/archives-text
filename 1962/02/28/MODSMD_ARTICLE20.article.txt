STATEMENT
Editor, The Daily:
Men’s Council and IFC Judicial
Council would like to clarify yes
terday’s article in The Daily. The
following statement was deleted
from that originally submitted:
“Anti-social behavior is con
demned by our society. There is
no reason for such behavior to be
tolerated at Stanford.
“Students should be aware that
it was necessary to suspend 29
male undergraduates last year
for disciplinary reasons. Drunken
driving, theft, lewd and obscene
conduct and malicious mischief
are all grounds for suspension,
not only because they are obvious
violations of the Fundamental
Standard, but also because they
are violations of our society’s so
cial code.
“A breakdown of the 29 sus
pended students by type of living
group is enlightening. Members
of:
Fraternities .... 20 suspended
Eating Clubs ... 4 suspended
Independents ... 5 suspended
“Representing approximately
one-third of the male population,
the fraternities accounted for al
most 70 per cent of all violations
serious enough to involve suspen
sion. This minority of individuals
is a black eye to the fraternity
system, the students and the uni
versity as a whole.”
The.second half of the article
was quoted substantially as sub
mitted. A further point of clari
fication is that the penalties
stated namely, suspension for
the individual and revoked rush
ing privileges for the house —are
not just possible penalties; they
are definite ones.
It should be made clear to all
living groups that the shouting
of obscenities and similar behavi
or falls dangerously close to the
above category and each house
should make a determined effort
to control such conduct.

MORALITY PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily;
Why is the Men’s Council act
ing on a problem—lewdness, bes

tiality, and obscenity—which is,
according to yesterday’s article,
“concentrated in a minority of
the fraternity houses”? Is not the
IFC designed for just such ac
tion, and if so, why is it not al
lowed to act by itself?
We naturally want to avoid a
“blanket condemnation” of the
fraternity system, and therefore
we notify all men’s living groups
of their new regulations, even
though the action was precipitat
ed by a small part of a minority
group; in other words, a few fra
ternities. This has the false ring
of poor logic, and indicates the
general attitude taken at Stan
ford to all disciplinary action.

In line with Professor Hart’s
lectures on Law and Morality, a
graver problem is arising with
this action. Crossness may offend
some people, but the rights of the
depraved should not he suppress
ed because of this. As long as no
one is offended, why shouldn’t
the groups be allowed to “create
an atmosphere’’ in which any kind
of behavior is tolerated? In other
words, why shouldn’t individual
living groups be allowed to de
termine their own standards of
behavior as long as non-members
are not offended? Let them re
lease those tensions!
In summary, then, it is morally
wrong to persecute the majority
for the actions of the minority.
The Daily, the IFC, and Men’s
Council should apologize to all
individuals w y hose character was
slighted by yesterday’s article.

NOT A VILLAIN
Editor, The Daily:
Come now. I refuse to be cast
as the villain of the coed housing
idea. I didn’t oppose the Legisla
ture’s resolution, now did I?
As for the Stern proposal, in
spite of some opposition I did use
all of the available information in
writing my article. I meant what
I said, but rational criticism such
as that of Mr. Arnaud and his as
sociates is more apt to change my
mind than any Padulo-esque anal

ysis of my extracurricular “in
ertia.”
