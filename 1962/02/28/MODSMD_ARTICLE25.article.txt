## Stilt Nearing 4,000 Points 
### 
Wilt Chamberlain of the Phila
delphia Warriors is about to put
pro basketball’s scoring record
out of sight. In 73 games this
season, “Stilt” has dunked 3,637
points for an average of 49.8.
At this rate, nothing will stop
him from being the first player
ever to crack the 4,000-point
mark.
Chamberlain is also leading the
NBA in rebounding, grabbing 25.4
per game.
