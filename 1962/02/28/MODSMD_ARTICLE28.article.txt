# Kafka Novel Lecture Topic
## 
### 
Prof. Kurt Mueller-Vollmer of
the Department of Modern Lan
guages will address the Stanford
Philological Association tomor
row at 4:15 p.m. in the upper
lounge of the Women’s Club
house. He will discuss “Narrative
Style and Speculative Discourse
in Kafka’s ‘Castle’.”
This lecture will attempt to cor
relate prose-style, narrative struc
ture, and central theme in Kaf
ka’s novel and to describe the in
tricate relationship between those
three elements. Interpretative
clues will be derived from Hegel’s
“Phenomenology of Mind.”
