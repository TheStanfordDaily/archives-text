# Tradition Hinders U.S. In Cold War'

United States foreign policy
must be accurately gauged by the
requirements of international
competition in a situation of nu
clear stalemate, said former New
York Times Moscow correspond
ent Harrison Salisbury last night
in his Tuesday Evening Series
address.

Our foreign policy has tended
to be ineffective in dealing with
the Communist threat, ho warn
ed, because we have been hinder
ed even in recent years by our
traditional disinterest and lack
of understanding of international
affairs.
In addition, our estimates of
Russian technology and military
might have been unrealistic, be
cause we have grossly underesti
mated the abilities of the Russian
people and their government to
meet the present-day demands of
scientific and industrial excel
lence.

“The Sputnik was the best
thing that could have happened
to this country—it made us come
awake,” explaned Salisbury. The
Russian satellite severely jolted
our confidence in the superiority
of our technology, and, on a
broader scale, of our ability to
cope with the Russian menace.

Our estimates of Soviet mili
tary strength have become more
sober. However, Salisbury warn
ed of the danger in our continued
ineptitude in responding to the
problems presented by the Com
munist threat.

That ineptitude, he expalined,
lies in our serious lack of knowl
edge of the political, economic,
and social trends within the Com
munist bloc.
