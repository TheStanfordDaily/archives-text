SHAKESPEARE DOESN’T LIVE HERE
A recent and most heartening development in American college
life has been the emergence of the artist-in-residence. In fact,
the artist-in-residence has become as familiar a sight on campus
a s Latin ponies, leather elbow patches, Rorschach tests, hula
hoops, and Marlboro cigarettes.
And we all know how familiar that is 1 mean Marlboro ciga
rettes. And why should it not be familiar? Why, where learning
is king, where taste is sovereign, where brain power rules
supreme, should not Marlboro he everyone’s favorite? The sanu
good sense that gets you through an exam in Restoration Poetry
or solid-state physics certainly does not desert you when you
come to pick a cigarette. You look for a flavor that is flavorful,
a filter pure and white, a choice of pack or box, a lot to like. You
look, in short, lor Marlboro—and happily you don't have to look
far. Marlboro is available at your friendly tobacconist’s or vend
ing machine, wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states and
Las Vegas.
Hut I digress. We were speaking of the new campus phenome
non the artist-in-residence—a man or woman who writes,
paints, or composes right on your very own campus and who is
also available for occasional consultations with superior students.
lake, for example, \\ illiam Cullen Sigafoos, artist-in-residence
at the Toledo College of Belles Lettrcsand Fingerprint Identifi
cation.
As we all know, Mr. Sigafoos has been working for many years
on an epic poem in rhymed couplets about tin l opening of the
Aoungstown-Akron highway. Fntil, however, he went into
residence at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Finger
print Identification, his progress was not what you would call
rapid. He started well enough with the immortal couplet wo all
know: 77a// speed along on wheels of rubber , rushing home in
lime for suhher . . .
I hen Air. Sigafoos got stuck. It is not that his muse deserted
him; it is that he became involved in a series of time-consuming
episodes—a prefrontal lobotomy for Irwin, his faithful sled
dog: fourteen consecutive months of jury duty on a very com
plicated case of overtime parking: getting bis coattail caught in
the door of a jet bound for Brisbane, Australia; stuff like that.
He was engaged in a very arduous job in Sandusky posing
lor a sculptor of hydrants—when all offer came from the Toledo
( allege of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identification to take
up residence there, finish his magnum opus and, from time to
time, see a few gifted students.
Mr. Sigafoos accepted with pleasure and in three short years
completed the second couplet ol his A oungstown-Akron Turnpike
epic; 7 he highway is made of solid concrete and at the 101 l slid ion you
r lhen a few gifted students came to visit him. They were a
prepossessing lot—the boys with corduroy jackets and long,
shaggy beards: the girls also with corduroy jackets but with
beards neatly braided.
‘AMiat is truth?’ said one. “What is beauty?” said another.
“Should a writer live first and write later or should he write
and do a little living in his spare time?” said another.
"How do you find happiness—and having found it, how do
you get rid of it?” said another.
“Whither arc we drifting?” said another.
“I don’t know whither you are drifting,” said Mr. Sigafoos,
“but as for me, 1 am drifting back to Sandusky to pose for the
hydrant sculptor.”
And back he went, alas, leaving only a fragment of his Abungs
town-Akron Turnpike epic to rank with other such uncom
pleted masterpieces as Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony, the
Take cheer, good friends, from one masterpiece that is com
plete. lie, refer, of course, to Marlboro cigarettes. Filter
end and tobacco end are both as good as tobacco artistry
and science ran make them.
