A good sword nowadays is hard to fmd-and in olden times, too. Many a
feudal lord saw it pointless to joust with a faulty halberd, and for worthy steel
alone the Visigoths sacked Rome.
Today, centuries later, the search for stronger steels goes on. And among those
making most dramatic strides in advancing the state of the metallurgical art
are the research teams at Ford’s Scientific Laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan.
In exploring the "world of microstructure," these scientists, using methods of
extreme sophistication, have been able to look at iron and steel on a near
atomic scale. They have discovered secrets of nature leading to new processing
techniques which yield steels of ultra-high strength unknown a decade ago.
The promise of such techniques seems limitless. As man develops the needs
and means to travel more swiftly on earth and over interplanetary reaches—
wherever economy of weight and space is required—strength of physical
materials will become paramount. This is another example of how Ford is gaining
leadership through scientific research and engineering.
