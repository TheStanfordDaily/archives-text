# LASSU to Consider Constitution
## 
### 
LASSU tonight will consider
the executive section of the new
constitution and Winter Drives
and will continue action on coed
housing.

The executive section of the con
stitution was examined at a
sparsely attended session of
LASSU meeting as a constitution
al convention last week. Due to
the absence of ICC President Dave
Dierdorff, who headed the com
mittee which drew up this section,
less than possible was accom
plished, according to ASSU Pres
ident Bob Saylor.
The main area needing clarifi
cation was the office of the new
first vice president—how to elect
him, whether he is to embody the
increased power of the legislature
or to be an aid to reducing the
load on the president, where the
power will lie.
The members of that conven
tion also expressed strong disap
proval of John Steinbruner’s pre
sentation of his views concerning
the National Student Association
as those of the committee in his
articles in The Daily.
The appointment of a judicial
co-ordinator (originally an ’’at
torney general”) and the creation
of student committees paralleling
those of the faculty were less
controversial.
Winter Drives will, if the Car
dinals have their way, bo used as
a fund-raising and publicity ven
ture for the I-Club. This idea was
broached three weeks ago to
LASSU and has since been dis
cussed with living groups. Jim
Rogers will report on these dis
cussions and make a definite pro
posal for Winter Drives.
LASSU last week approved the
principle of coed housing; this
week it will consider the specific
case of Stern Hall and next year.
Other items on the agenda are
a report on Tresidder Union by
Roy Cairncross, approval of Me
linda Gartsman to replace Chuck
Bischoff as Elections Chairman,
and hearing the AWS By-Laws
report.
