### 
NEW DELHI, India (UPD—Po
litical observers said yesterday
Defense Minister V. K. Krishna
Menon is headed for one of the
biggest election victories ever re
corded by a candidate in India’s
three general elections.
The vote count in North Bom
bay showed Krishna Menon
lengthening his lead over his op
ponent, A. J. B. Kripalani, in the
race for the seat in Parliament.
Latest returns gave him a 114,000-
vote margin.
The hopes of founding an im
portant. party in opposition to
Nehru’s Congress Party and
hopes of giving India a true multi
party democracy were dashed by
Menon’s victory. The opposition
parties had concentrated their ef
forts on defeating Menon, symbol
of leftist tendencies in Indian for
eign policy.
Political observers described
Krishna Menon’s showing as
“phenomenal,” surpassing the
most optimistic hopes of the Con
gress parly workers. Krishna
Menon also ran with the support
of the Communists.
The Congress party retained ab
solute control of Parliament and
in the state essemblies as well.
Nehru was returned by a ma
jority of more than 65,000 votes
over his nearest competitor.
