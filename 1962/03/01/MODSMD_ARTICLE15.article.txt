# Classics Department Has Undergone Rebirth

For the Subcommittee on Aca
demic Review

The advantages of a closely
knit. small department to an un
dergraduate in a huge university
are all too often over looked. Stan
ford’s Classics Department, dur
ing the last four years, has bene
fitted from a renaissance that
now gives it the largest number
of undergraduate classics majors
of any university in the country,
excluding Harvard.
Four years ago, before Brooks
Otis was brought in as head of the
department, there were three pro
fessors, one instructor, three ma
jors, and no graduate students
comprising what was virtually a
dead department.
WITH THE advent of the Na
tional Defense Education Act
loans, the department immediate
ly began to attract graduate stu
dents; before long, undergradu
ates began to discover it. Much of
the credit goes to Professor Otis,
particularly for bringing in the
now famous duo from Yale,
Messrs. Doyle and Beyo; it is in
the last two years that this de
partment has truly been activated
in tire eyes of the Student Body.
These two men, with almost a
missionary zeal for the depart
ment, have drawn in student after
student through the force of their
personalities and the superb
quality of their teaching.
There are few departments any
where in which off-campus par
ties are held frequently, teas are
held weekly, and in which many
of the teachers regularly enter
tain all their students at their
homes. This intimacy is reflected
also in the small size of the
classes, a rarity at Stanford and
an advantage which should not be
overlooked.

One of the department’s main
strengths is its insistence on
learning the original language
well. Too many departments, like
those of Princeton. Yale, and
Brown, have fallen into the rut
of teaching courses primarily in
translation, for lack of majors.
Though one of the successes of
Stanford’s classics department is
that it does concentrate on read
ing originals rather than transla
tions, no one can deny the value
of Classics courses in translation
for the non-major; probably there

is still 100 great a scarcity of such
offerings as Tl6O, Homeric Epics.
THE DEPARTMENT, though,
is quite understaffed at present;
the increase in students has out
stripped the increase in faculty.
Whereas most departments need
cover only several fields, Classics
must be able to teach the lan
guage, literature, philosophy, his
tory, and archaeology of two cul
tures spanning a millenium.
The purpose of the department
is. in fact, to give a student an
acquaintance with a civilization
in all its aspects; no other depart
ment can approach such compre
hensiveness. But as a result, many
of its teachers are forced to teach
considerably beyond the normal
number of hours.
Lest one feel this article is bias
ed, it should be pointed out that
not all aspects of the department
are free of pedantry and general
uselessness. In a small depart
ment, it is essential that all the
faculty be excellent teachers,
since neatly all majors will he
taking courses from all members
of the department. Despite the ex
cellent courses in Archaeology,
History. Beginning Greek, etc.,
many of the upper-division
courses do suffer from a definite
lack >f vitality, which, to an un
der graduate observer, appears to
he caused by an over-interest in
scholarly research, to the exclu
sion of interest in teaching.
IN SEVERAL courses, the
teachers too frequently intrude
their own special research inter
ests, which seldom bear any rele
vance to the course.
But. if the department faculty
could be increased by 50 per cent,
with all members taking an in
terest in teaching equal to that of,
say, Professors, Hansen, Doyle,
and Beye; if Professor Otis’ plans
for a summer institute in Rome
could he set up for majors; if
more courses in translation could
be devised, such as Mr. Sullwold’s
course in Mythology, and Mr,
Beye’s in Homeric Epics, then the
Classics Department could be one
of the most challenging and vita]
in the University.

Already the department has
added such internationally known
scholars as Prof. Waszink of the
University of Leiden, a visiting
professor, and others such as Li
onel Pearson, and Hermann Fran
kel, and it has already gained,
despite its shortcomings, one of
the best reputations of any clas
sics department in the country.
