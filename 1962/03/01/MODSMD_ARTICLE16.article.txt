## Fellini's 'Cabiria' Better Than 'La Dolce Vita' By KERRY FELTHAM 
### 
It is curious to see the manner
in which one work of a man leads
into another. Here is the precur
sor. eerily similar, of "La Dolce
Vita.” Frederico Fellini has, you
might say ‘Done it Before.’ And
better.
Like “La Dolce Vita,” one per
son is taken, via unstrung to
gether incidents, through several
shades of life in Rome. We see
again the decadent, beautiful
world of the very rich temporar
ily inhabited by the title charac
ter a very poor and un-Italian
shady lady, who with her blond
hair looks more like a Minsk tart.
EXOTIC NIGHT-CLUB acts,
decadent high and low lifes scram
bled together, a bitter (but thank
God shorter) observation of the
commcrcialities of a religious
shrine (masses herded in to ask
the Virgin for favors are sold
balloons, candles, picnics - kiss
the relic, wipe it off, kiss the relic,
wipe it off I and characters sensi
tive enough to feel guilty that
their selfishness shatters some
one’s life—all are startlingly
similar to “La Dolce Vita.”
It is a curious mixture of harsh
ness and sentiment—-Cabiria is an
awkward, peasant prostitute, a
cock-eyed Candide, wanting to

hope and to love, but kicked so
many times that she is heart
breakingly suspicious.
The filmic construction is that
of a screen play rather than a
film, hut it’s normal style, pieced
together shot by shot like a fine
mosaic, has been followed with a
great regard for the effect of each
shot and the cumulative effects
of the series of shots.
MOST OF the orgiestic loud
ness of “La Dolce Vita” is missing
in “Cabiria,” but it seems to be
a more perceptive picture, cutting
through to a better understanding
of the same sort of people. It
shouldn’t be missed.
“New York, New York,” the
short shown with it, is probably
the most cinematic-ally interest
ing film to be shown in Palo Alto
this month.
It appears to be an attempt,
through use of trick lenses, to
show the feeling of New York.
I don’t think it’s very good at it,
but no one could quarrel with the
technical production, which is ex
tremely smooth.
IT’S GOOD to know that ab
stract films can he shown in pub
lic theatres and their very rari
ty should prompt one to see it.
You may not like it, hut you’ll he
1 fascinated.
