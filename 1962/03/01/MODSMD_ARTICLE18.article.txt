## An Old University Tradition 
### 
(Editor’s Note: Last year at
about tills time. The Daily print
ed a laudatory salute to Founder’s
Day. Feeling that there’s another
side to tliis campus tradition,
Steve Zousiner lias undertaken to
present his views on the subject.
Zousiner says lie'll he casting fur
tive glances all around him for
the next week or so.)

Come hell or - high water, the
University says, we're going to
celebrate Founder’s’ Day. And not
only are we going to celebrate it,
but we’re going to have somebody
around to celebrate it with.
That’s why the anniversary of
the University’s founding has
been changed from March 9th to
March 4th. March 4th is a Sun
day and people go to church the
plan is to slip in a quick ceremony
before (he church-goers can exit.
THE ADMINISTRA TION
knows that without Sunday’s cap
tive audience at Memorial Church,
there would be nobody to listen
to the glowing words about Stan
ford University (One of the rules
for Founders’ Day is to enunciate
clearly and not say StanFURD.
As a matter of fact, we are all
urged to say StanFORD, with a
special emphasis on the last syl
lable because it is the FORD
Foundation which is giving us the
PACE money every little apple
polish helps).
Without some conniving to get
an audience, the ceremony might
just as well be held in a phone
booth. We could cram the Presi
dent, chaplain, emeritii, student

leaders, and wreath (it’s tire same
wreath that we used last year
every little saving helps) into the
phone booth and be assured of a
capacity crowd.
Founders’ Day is celebrated In
honor of Leland Stanford, who
started the University ball rolling
back in 1891. I know that Stan
ford was founded in 1891 because
it says so on my sweatshirt. Ac
tually what it says on my sweat
shirt is that Stanford was “or
ganized” in 1891. We don’t call
March 4th “Organization Day”
because that wouldn’t bo senti
mental enough. Maybe I should
bleach my sweatshirt.
I’M PROBABLY being indeli
cate to mention my sweatshirt in
connection with Founders’ Day,
which is traditionally a black robe
affair. Ten or 20 professors
mosey down the aisle of Mom
Chu in their robes to take part in
the ceremony. This means that
the day before Founders’ Day
will be pretty hectic in some fac
ulty homes: “Hey Martha, where
the hell’s my robe.”
One thing about Founders’ Day
though, it’s dull. You sit through
a few inappropriate Biblical se
lections. some gratitude speeches,
somebody works in a mention of
Mrs. Stanford (it was she who
said, “No smoking in the Inner-
Quad”), and finally there is the
Founders’ Day Address.

This is tho highpoint of the day
because you know that somebody
is on the spot. Some professor is
going to have to make an address
and what in the world can he
say? He can’t quote former Presi
dent David Starr Jordan for 20
minutes; he can’t say, sincerely
and suitably, “I'm proud of Stan
ford” because that would be too
brief and not sufficiently pom
pous; all he can do is rely on long
windedness and let go with every
thing he can dream up.
DESPITE THE assemblage of
PhD.’s and student leaflet’s all you
learn from the Founders’ show is
that Stanford was founded. It
answers the question of an in
quisitive student who asked,

“Who found this place?”
The fact that Stanford was
founded is something to mull over
all day Sunday, especially if you
go to the flicks. Incidentally, Sun
clay night’s flick is “Once More
with Feeling,” which is appropri
ate. I can hear the chairman of
the Committee on Public- Exer
cises pleading to tired professors
who have become Founders’ Day
veterans, “Just once more, guys,
and with a little feeling this time-,
huh?”
Oh well. Founders' Day is okay.
Give it credit for honoring Leland
Stanford. Give it credit for being
a vapid, honeyed-over- institution
which nevertheless gives the Uni
versity tradition. Give it as little
of your time as possible. Give it
the axe.
