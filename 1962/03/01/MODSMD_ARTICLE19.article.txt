COED POLL
Editor, The Daily:
It has already been stated that
there is support among women
students for coeducational hous
ing in Stein. In order to find out
the extent of this support in i
Branner a poll was taken, after!
considering an article presented
to us by the LASSU Housing
Committee.

These were the results: Out of
183 girls, 25 said they would “ten
tatively commit themselves to
living in Stern next year 1 under- a
system of coeducational hous
ing”; 21 said they would “serious
ly consider living in Stern next
year under a system of coeduca
tional housing”; 57 said they
would “support the program, al
though not live in Stern next
year”; and 8 said they were “defi
nitely against coeducational hous
ing.” The rest had no opinion.
This is meant as an answer to
people who refuse to proceed
with any plan at all because they
don’t know what kind of support
they have.
