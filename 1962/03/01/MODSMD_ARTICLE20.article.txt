# Stanford On Formosa?—Two Views on Chiang and His Government
## 
### JOSEPH S. CHANG BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
In a recent article, The Daily’s
associate editor, Mr. Barry Green
berg, raised several questions
about Taiwan. It seems Mr.
Greenberg draws his material al
most exclusively from a book by
William J. Lederer, who co-au
thored “The Ugly American.’’
I have no way of telling what
are the sources Lederer used.
However, if Lederer's book about
his own people is a good indica
tion of his sense of fairness and
standard of judgment, it may not
be difficult to tell how accurate
his observation is about a coun
try which he only knows second
hand.

Now let’s take a look at some
of the facts. First, the Fob. 28,
1947 incident, in which Mr. Green
berg alleged “10,000 Formosans
were shot and bayoneted.” True,
the riot was touched off by the
accidental shooting of a native
woman who was caught selling
untaxed cigarettes.

As in any mob riots, it was hard
to tell exactly what happened. A
number of persons were injured
and others were killed during the
riot. But there was no such thing
as “10,000 Formosans shot and
bayoneted.” The Chinese Central
Government, then in Nanking, re
gretted the incident and did what
it could to patch up the ruffled
feelings. The governor of Taiwan
at that time, Chen Yi, was re
moved from office, tried for ne
glect of duty, and reprimanded.
He was later executed in connec
tion with another case.

SECOND, Mr. Greenberg might
like to know that the Nationalist
army did not “quickly make their
presence known by looting stores,
gutting hospitals, etc.’’ nor did it
“proceed to slaughter thousands
of Formosans” in 1949. I don’t
know what sources Mr. Green
berg used when he made such
sweeping statements.

Could it be he confused the ex
aggerated 1947 riot with the re
treat of the Nationalist army to
Taiwan in 1949?

Anyway, the retreat of the Na
toinalist army, who were bedrag
gled but still well disciplined,
was orderly. Many foreigners
who were in Taiwan in 1949 could
tell Mr. Greenberg there was no
such thing as “looting stores and

gutting hospitals.”
IN HIS article, Mr. Greenberg
quoted Lederer and cited some
figures to establish his point that
whatever that is good in Taiwan
was achieved by the Japanese
and, therefore, the Nationalist
Chinese government has done
nothing that merits mentioning.
A few figures might clear this
point. Rice production: 1,400.000
tons peak record during Japanese
rule; 2,050,000 tons in 1960. Power
output: 1.2 billion kilowatt hours
in 1943; 3.9 billion kilowatt hours
in 1960.

During the Japanese occupa
tion, the Japanese government
was the largest landowner in Tai
wan while few peasants owned
(heir land. In a land reform pro
gram from 1949 to 1953, the Na
tionalist Chinese go v e rnment
turned the land to the farmers.
In all. 468,701 families became
new landowners through this
“land-to-the-tiller” program.
ABOUT EDUCATION, there
was only one university in Tai
wan under the Japanese. It was
primarily for the Japanese resi
dents, not the natives. Now there
are 27 universities and colleges.
Among the students, more than
two thirds are natives.

Mr. Greenberg said that the
National Assembly was “chosen”
by President Chiang Kai-shek. It
was not. The members of the As
sembly were popularly elected.
Mr. Greenberg repeatedly men
tioned the “slaughtering of For
mosans” by the Nationalist army.
A little research will satisfy him
that no such “slaughtering” ever
took place. Besides, Mr. Green
berg might like to know the Na
tionalist army today consists of
about 70 per cent natives, whom
he called “Formosans.” One won
ders how you can “turn out” an
army to “slaughter” their own
people.

FINALLY, a word about (ho
pot term Mr. Greenberg used,
namely the “Formosans,” The
true “Formosans” on the island
constitute about 2 per cent of the
total population. They belong to

the Polynesian stock and live up
in the mountains.

The remaining portion of the
people on Taiwan are all Chinese,
and speak the same language.
The so-called natives about 75 per
cent are offspring of Chinese im
migrants who came to Taiwan
from the mainland China in the
17th century, when Taiwan first
became a province of China. The
others, about 23 per cent, include
those who came to Taiwan from
the mainland after 1945, and their
children born in Taiwan since
then.

Mr. Chang criticizes me per
haps justifiably—for using Mr.
Lederer’s book as my main
source. There are 1 , several excel
lent, non-sensationalistic books
about Formosa which I could
have used. In order to rectify the
situation, I would like to quote
from them now.
Mr. Lederer’s book, by the way,
was not my only source. I also
used Professor Claude Buss’ book,
“The Far East.” Professor Buss
teaches at Stanford when he isn’t
in the Far East, and is a recog
nized expert. It was from his
book that I learned 10,000 Taiwa
nese were shot and bayoneted as
a result of the Feb. 28 incident.
Professor Buss’ figure is the
same one used by Joseph Ballan
tine in his book, “Formosa,” and
by Fred W. Riggs in his book.
“Formosa Under Nationalist
Rule.”
Mr. Chang refers to the Feh.
28 incident as being touched off
by an “accidental shooting.” Ex
actly what is an accidental shoot
ing? One has to assume that the
native woman selling untaxed
cigarettes was caught, but in the
process got in the way of a bul-

let which was minding its own
business. Possible, but unlikely.
Mr. Chang is absolutely correct
when he says that Chen Yi was
removed from office after the
massacre. But things didn’t stay
peaceful for long. On Jan. 5, 1949,
Chiang Kai-shek sent General
Ch’en Ch’eng to Formosa to take
over as Governor.
Upon his arrival, Ch'en Ch’eng
reasserted martial law and ar
rested and executed persons
charged with communist sym
pathies, This is not from Mr. Led
erer, but from Mr, Ballantine
who. to my knowledge, has never
said a nasty thing about his own
people.
Mr. Chang is also correct when
he says that Chen Yi was execut
ed “in connection with another
case.” After being removed from
office, Chiang made Chon Yi Gov
ernor of Chekiang province. In
gratitude, Chen Yi connived with
the communists to give them the I
province for a small price. The
Nationalists caught him and he
was promptly shot. The moral is
that killing 10,000 Taiwanese |
earns you distinction but con
spiracy with the enemy earns you |
extinction.

I cannot refute Mr. Chang’s
next statement concerning the re
ported looting that went on when
the Nationalists arrived in 1949.
Mr. Lederer is the only person to
mention it.

As for Mr. Chang’s next point,
I never said or implied that the
Japanese are entirely responsible
for Formosa’s economic well-be
ing. I said that due to the Japa
nese economic program from 1895
to 1945, the Nationalists came to
an island which was already eco
nomically prosperous. To my
knowledge no one has disputed
this fact.
The question of Chiang and the

National Assembly is clear cut.
On March 1, 1950, Chiang, re
sponding to “the people's will,”
proclaimed he was resuming his
office as President of China.

One of his opponents, General
Tsung-jen, claimed correctly that
this was unconstitutional. Tsung
jen was fortunate to be out of the
country when he made his state
ment. for Chiang instituted a com
prehensive purge in which at
least ninety high-ranking civil and
military officials were arrested,
some being executed. Many other
political opponents were exiled.
I All of this from Ballantine and
Riggs.)
There is general agreement
that the National Assembly elec
tions were rigged. Whether they
were or not dwindles to unim
portance when he remember that
these elections had no adverse ef
fects on Chiang’s dictatorial
powers.
Ballantine says, “Chiang’s dic
tatorial authority is not found in
law but is maintained through po
litical manipulation and the dis

pensation of patronage.” Biggs
agrees. So does Lederer.
All this is not to say that the
Nationalist Chinese have accom
plished nothing on Formosa.

They must certainly have accom
plished things and deserve credit.
The fact remains, however, that
Formosa is ruled by a dictator
and his sycophants. Whether or

j not the Taiwanese love this group
is a moot point, but history indi
cates that most dictators are re
1 speeded out of fear, not out of
| love.
