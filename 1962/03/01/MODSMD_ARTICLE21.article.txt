# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## 
### Glenn Alford 
The Far West figures to again dominate college track this year,
and one of the reasons for this is Stanford, with one of its strongest
teams ever.
Coach Payton Jordan’s Indians won only three dual meets last,
year, but the varsity is bolstered by the* number one frosh track
squad in the United States last year.
use, Oregon, Oregon State, San Jose, UCLA, Occidental and
Stanford are the tops in the West, not necessarily in that order.
USC once again figures to be America’s best. A pair of weight
men, Dallas Long in the shot-put and Jim Wade throwing the discus,
as consistent winners. Add this to Rex Cawley, possibly the best low
hurdles man anywhere and also on excellent quarter-miler, and other
hurdlers such as Brian Polkinghorne and Bob Pierce and you get
a powerhouse.
Javelin hurler Jan Sikorsky joined SC from the Marines, where
he consistently was between 230-240. Pole-vaulter Mol Hein Jr. is
usually over 14 feet. However SC is weak over (he longer running
distances and in the broad jump, and can be had.
OREUON HAS SEVERAL DISTANCE MEN
Oregon has a crew of distance men in Dyrol Burleson, Archie
San Romani Jr., Keith Forman and Vic Reeve. Jerry Tarr lends
strength in the hurdles and Sig

Ohlemann is a top 880 man.
Oregon State has Dale Story,
first in the national cross country
championships. Darrell Horn
sprints, and broad jumps over 25-
feet.
San Jose State’s 9.3 sprinter
Dennis Johnson paces a crew of '
sprinters second only to Villa- |
nova. Willie Williams runs 9.5 and I
there are several others under 10 I
flat. Williams runs the 440 in 46.8. I
Vance Barnes has high-jumped I
6-10 in the friendly Stanford pit. I
Harry Edwards hurls the discus "
170 and Dan Studney goes over .
230 in the javelin. Jeff Fishbaek
and Ben Tucker are highly-rated
in the 880 and mile.
Mil Dahl is virtually unbeatable
over the two-mile distance at
UCLA. C. K. Yang is a one-man
gang, pole-vaulting, throwing the
javelin, hurdling and high-jump
ing, He has a record of over 8,300

points in the decathlon. Gerald Carr is tough in the weight events.
Occidental sports Jim Cerveny in the middle distances, sprinter
Steve Haas and jack-of-all-trades Dixon Farmer.
Stanford will not be hurting in the midst of all these track
riches. Strength in the field events and the distance running events
is the Indians’ main forte.
Stanford has the top 1-2 punch in the nation in the discus. Dave
Weill, an All-American with the third best college throw in the
nation was elected captain of the track team for ’62, and could he
the best discus man in the U.S. Weill’s best toss is 186-7 in an All-
Comer’s meet this winter.
THE VERSATILE MR. BELL
Don Bell is the second man in this duo. He is usually around
165, a winning mark in most meets. Bell is the most versatile of the
Stanford trackmen.
He high-jumps 6-2 and hurdles well enough to place second
against Washington last year. He may shot-put if needed.
Shot-putter Steve Arch has done 54-9. and may tack a couple of
feet on to that mark.
Pole-vaulter Phil White has gone up as high as 14-9, and rarely
goes below 14.
After White and Arch, the depth is not there in the shot and
pole-vault.
The high-jump and broad-jump could be among Stanford’s
strongest events.
High-jumpers John Fontius, and John Haynie and Clayton Raaka
all have been around 6-5, with Haynie having the best mark in com
petition. 6-6*/2. Fontius has done 6-8 in a practice jump, and just a
couple of w'eeks ago did 6-5 1 a in an All-Comers’ Meet. Raaka has
jumped 6-4 la. As said, Bell also competes.
Broad-jumpers Charles Barth and Dan Moore have both been
around 25 feet. Moore’s best is 25-1. while Barth has hit 24-7. A dark
horse is Sheridan Downey at 23-2.
Art Batchelder and Chris Stack make Stanford rough in the
javelin. Art is within three feet of the Stanford javelin record, with
a best of 233-3. Stack is usually close to 200, with an all-time best
of 210.
STRENGTH OVER THE LONG HAUL
Stanford is strong in the 880, mile and two-mile. Rich Klier could
be the best on the coast, with a best of 1:50.8 in the former distance.
Bill Pratt, best frosh 880 man is Stanford history lends depth. Rich
Parker has been the top 880 man so far this winter, with a best
of 1:54.2.
Stanford has a batch of milers led by Harry McCalla. McCalla
has done 4:09. Robin Ruble has been looking better all the time, and
the sophomore from Los Altos will undoubtedly win a few for
Stanford this year. He could be the sensation of the AAWU before
the track season is over. Pratt will also run the mile.
McCalla has the U.S. record in the JC two-mile, 9:06. John North
way, Stanford’s one-man distance squad last year, will concentrate on
the two-mile, although he may run in the shorter distances. Larry
Shafer and George Pilz add depth.
The Tribe could be tough in the 440, hut only time will tell. Ken
Emmanuels has a world of promise, but has been hampered by
injuries. Rich Chesarek and Gary Walker have been under 49, and
may break into the win column. Boh Taylor is at present the lop
man in this event.
The sprints and hurdles are Stanford’s weak points. Phil Lamo
reaux is a good 220 man, but is weak in the century. If Chris Babbs
runs back to his 9.7 high school form, the 100 could be a winning
Stanford event.
Steve Cortright is Stanford’s best in the hurdles. He has done
a 14.7 high-hurdles, and a 23.9 lows. The only other Stanford hurdler
with experience is Bill Wandrey, whose best is 14.9. Bell may hurdle,
since behind him there is no experienced hurdler whatsoever.
Wih a little bit of luck here and there, Stanford could he very
good, hut a few injuries to key men and Stanford would be just
another team. We’ll wait and see, and enjoy the ride.

a best of 233-3. Stack is usually close to 200, with an all-time best
of 210.
STRENGTH OVER THE LONG HAUL
Stanford is strong in the 880, mile and two-mile. Rich Klier could
be the best on the coast, with a best of 1:50.8 in the former distance.
Bill Pratt, best frosh 880 man is Stanford history lends depth. Rich
Parker has been the top 880 man so far this winter, with a best
of 1:54.2.
Stanford has a batch of milers led by Harry McCalla. McCalla
has done 4:09. Robin Ruble has been looking better all the time, and
the sophomore from Los Altos will undoubtedly win a few for
Stanford this year. He could be the sensation of the AAWU before
the track season is over. Pratt will also run the mile.
McCalla has the U.S. record in the JC two-mile, 9:06. John North
way, Stanford’s one-man distance squad last year, will concentrate on
the two-mile, although he may run in the shorter distances. Larry
Shafer and George Pilz add depth.
The Tribe could be tough in the 440, hut only time will tell. Ken
Emmanuels has a world of promise, but has been hampered by
injuries. Rich Chesarek and Gary Walker have been under 49, and
may break into the win column. Boh Taylor is at present the lop
man in this event.
The sprints and hurdles are Stanford’s weak points. Phil Lamo
reaux is a good 220 man, but is weak in the century. If Chris Babbs
runs back to his 9.7 high school form, the 100 could be a winning
Stanford event.
Steve Cortright is Stanford’s best in the hurdles. He has done
a 14.7 high-hurdles, and a 23.9 lows. The only other Stanford hurdler
with experience is Bill Wandrey, whose best is 14.9. Bell may hurdle,
since behind him there is no experienced hurdler whatsoever.
Wih a little bit of luck here and there, Stanford could he very
good, hut a few injuries to key men and Stanford would be just
another team. We’ll wait and see, and enjoy the ride.


PAYTON JORDAN
His trackmen are strong
The Far West figures to again dominate college track this year,

USC once again figures to be America’s best. A pair of weight
men, Dallas Long in the shot-put and Jim Wade throwing the discus,
as consistent winners. Add this to Rex Cawley, possibly the best low
hurdles man anywhere and also on excellent quarter-miler, and other
hurdlers such as Brian Polkinghorne and Bob Pierce and you get
a powerhouse.
Javelin hurler Jan Sikorsky joined SC from the Marines, where

Pole-vaulter Phil White has gone up as high as 14-9, and rarely
goes below 14.
After White and Arch, the depth is not there in the shot and

javelin, hurdling and high-jump
ing, He has a record of over 8,300

points in the decathlon. Gerald Carr is tough in the weight events.
Occidental sports Jim Cerveny in the middle distances, sprinter
Steve Haas and jack-of-all-trades Dixon Farmer.
Stanford will not be hurting in the midst of all these track
riches. Strength in the field events and the distance running events
is the Indians’ main forte.
Stanford has the top 1-2 punch in the nation in the discus. Dave
Weill, an All-American with the third best college throw in the
nation was elected captain of the track team for ’62, and could he
the best discus man in the U.S. Weill’s best toss is 186-7 in an All-
Comer’s meet this winter.
THE VERSATILE MR. BELL
Don Bell is the second man in this duo. He is usually around
165, a winning mark in most meets. Bell is the most versatile of the
Stanford trackmen.
He high-jumps 6-2 and hurdles well enough to place second
against Washington last year. He may shot-put if needed.
Shot-putter Steve Arch has done 54-9. and may tack a couple of
feet on to that mark.
Pole-vaulter Phil White has gone up as high as 14-9, and rarely
goes below 14.
After White and Arch, the depth is not there in the shot and
pole-vault.
The high-jump and broad-jump could be among Stanford’s
strongest events.
High-jumpers John Fontius, and John Haynie and Clayton Raaka
all have been around 6-5, with Haynie having the best mark in com
petition. 6-6*/2. Fontius has done 6-8 in a practice jump, and just a
couple of w'eeks ago did 6-5 1 a in an All-Comers’ Meet. Raaka has
jumped 6-4 la. As said, Bell also competes.
Broad-jumpers Charles Barth and Dan Moore have both been
around 25 feet. Moore’s best is 25-1. while Barth has hit 24-7. A dark
horse is Sheridan Downey at 23-2.
Art Batchelder and Chris Stack make Stanford rough in the
javelin. Art is within three feet of the Stanford javelin record, with
a best of 233-3. Stack is usually close to 200, with an all-time best
of 210.
STRENGTH OVER THE LONG HAUL
Stanford is strong in the 880, mile and two-mile. Rich Klier could
be the best on the coast, with a best of 1:50.8 in the former distance.
Bill Pratt, best frosh 880 man is Stanford history lends depth. Rich
Parker has been the top 880 man so far this winter, with a best
of 1:54.2.
Stanford has a batch of milers led by Harry McCalla. McCalla
has done 4:09. Robin Ruble has been looking better all the time, and
the sophomore from Los Altos will undoubtedly win a few for
Stanford this year. He could be the sensation of the AAWU before
the track season is over. Pratt will also run the mile.
McCalla has the U.S. record in the JC two-mile, 9:06. John North
way, Stanford’s one-man distance squad last year, will concentrate on
the two-mile, although he may run in the shorter distances. Larry
Shafer and George Pilz add depth.
The Tribe could be tough in the 440, hut only time will tell. Ken
Emmanuels has a world of promise, but has been hampered by
injuries. Rich Chesarek and Gary Walker have been under 49, and
may break into the win column. Boh Taylor is at present the lop
man in this event.
The sprints and hurdles are Stanford’s weak points. Phil Lamo
reaux is a good 220 man, but is weak in the century. If Chris Babbs
runs back to his 9.7 high school form, the 100 could be a winning
Stanford event.
Steve Cortright is Stanford’s best in the hurdles. He has done
a 14.7 high-hurdles, and a 23.9 lows. The only other Stanford hurdler
with experience is Bill Wandrey, whose best is 14.9. Bell may hurdle,
since behind him there is no experienced hurdler whatsoever.
Wih a little bit of luck here and there, Stanford could he very
good, hut a few injuries to key men and Stanford would be just
another team. We’ll wait and see, and enjoy the ride.

The Far West figures to again dominate college track this year,
and one of the reasons for this is Stanford, with one of its strongest
teams ever.
Coach Payton Jordan’s Indians won only three dual meets last,
year, but the varsity is bolstered by the* number one frosh track
squad in the United States last year.
use, Oregon, Oregon State, San Jose, UCLA, Occidental and
Stanford are the tops in the West, not necessarily in that order.
USC once again figures to be America’s best. A pair of weight
men, Dallas Long in the shot-put and Jim Wade throwing the discus,
as consistent winners. Add this to Rex Cawley, possibly the best low
hurdles man anywhere and also on excellent quarter-miler, and other
hurdlers such as Brian Polkinghorne and Bob Pierce and you get
a powerhouse.
Javelin hurler Jan Sikorsky joined SC from the Marines, where
he consistently was between 230-240. Pole-vaulter Mol Hein Jr. is
usually over 14 feet. However SC is weak over (he longer running
distances and in the broad jump, and can be had.
OREUON HAS SEVERAL DISTANCE MEN
Oregon has a crew of distance men in Dyrol Burleson, Archie
San Romani Jr., Keith Forman and Vic Reeve. Jerry Tarr lends
strength in the hurdles and Sig

Ohlemann is a top 880 man.
Oregon State has Dale Story,
first in the national cross country
championships. Darrell Horn
sprints, and broad jumps over 25-
feet.
San Jose State’s 9.3 sprinter
Dennis Johnson paces a crew of '
sprinters second only to Villa- |
nova. Willie Williams runs 9.5 and I
there are several others under 10 I
flat. Williams runs the 440 in 46.8. I
Vance Barnes has high-jumped I
6-10 in the friendly Stanford pit. I
Harry Edwards hurls the discus "
170 and Dan Studney goes over .
230 in the javelin. Jeff Fishbaek
and Ben Tucker are highly-rated
in the 880 and mile.
Mil Dahl is virtually unbeatable
over the two-mile distance at
UCLA. C. K. Yang is a one-man
gang, pole-vaulting, throwing the
javelin, hurdling and high-jump
ing, He has a record of over 8,300

points in the decathlon. Gerald Carr is tough in the weight events.
Occidental sports Jim Cerveny in the middle distances, sprinter
Steve Haas and jack-of-all-trades Dixon Farmer.
Stanford will not be hurting in the midst of all these track
riches. Strength in the field events and the distance running events
is the Indians’ main forte.
Stanford has the top 1-2 punch in the nation in the discus. Dave
Weill, an All-American with the third best college throw in the
nation was elected captain of the track team for ’62, and could he
the best discus man in the U.S. Weill’s best toss is 186-7 in an All-
Comer’s meet this winter.
THE VERSATILE MR. BELL
Don Bell is the second man in this duo. He is usually around
165, a winning mark in most meets. Bell is the most versatile of the
Stanford trackmen.
He high-jumps 6-2 and hurdles well enough to place second
against Washington last year. He may shot-put if needed.
Shot-putter Steve Arch has done 54-9. and may tack a couple of
feet on to that mark.
Pole-vaulter Phil White has gone up as high as 14-9, and rarely
goes below 14.
After White and Arch, the depth is not there in the shot and
pole-vault.
The high-jump and broad-jump could be among Stanford’s
strongest events.
High-jumpers John Fontius, and John Haynie and Clayton Raaka
all have been around 6-5, with Haynie having the best mark in com
petition. 6-6*/2. Fontius has done 6-8 in a practice jump, and just a
couple of w'eeks ago did 6-5 1 a in an All-Comers’ Meet. Raaka has
jumped 6-4 la. As said, Bell also competes.
Broad-jumpers Charles Barth and Dan Moore have both been
around 25 feet. Moore’s best is 25-1. while Barth has hit 24-7. A dark
horse is Sheridan Downey at 23-2.
Art Batchelder and Chris Stack make Stanford rough in the
javelin. Art is within three feet of the Stanford javelin record, with
a best of 233-3. Stack is usually close to 200, with an all-time best
of 210.
STRENGTH OVER THE LONG HAUL
Stanford is strong in the 880, mile and two-mile. Rich Klier could
be the best on the coast, with a best of 1:50.8 in the former distance.
Bill Pratt, best frosh 880 man is Stanford history lends depth. Rich
Parker has been the top 880 man so far this winter, with a best
of 1:54.2.
Stanford has a batch of milers led by Harry McCalla. McCalla
has done 4:09. Robin Ruble has been looking better all the time, and
the sophomore from Los Altos will undoubtedly win a few for
Stanford this year. He could be the sensation of the AAWU before
the track season is over. Pratt will also run the mile.
McCalla has the U.S. record in the JC two-mile, 9:06. John North
way, Stanford’s one-man distance squad last year, will concentrate on
the two-mile, although he may run in the shorter distances. Larry
Shafer and George Pilz add depth.
The Tribe could be tough in the 440, hut only time will tell. Ken
Emmanuels has a world of promise, but has been hampered by
injuries. Rich Chesarek and Gary Walker have been under 49, and
may break into the win column. Boh Taylor is at present the lop
man in this event.
The sprints and hurdles are Stanford’s weak points. Phil Lamo
reaux is a good 220 man, but is weak in the century. If Chris Babbs
runs back to his 9.7 high school form, the 100 could be a winning
Stanford event.
Steve Cortright is Stanford’s best in the hurdles. He has done
a 14.7 high-hurdles, and a 23.9 lows. The only other Stanford hurdler
with experience is Bill Wandrey, whose best is 14.9. Bell may hurdle,
since behind him there is no experienced hurdler whatsoever.
Wih a little bit of luck here and there, Stanford could he very
good, hut a few injuries to key men and Stanford would be just
another team. We’ll wait and see, and enjoy the ride.
