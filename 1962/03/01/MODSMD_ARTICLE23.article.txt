# Indian Rugby Team Wallops SC, 33-3
## 
### 
Stanford’s undefeated rugby
team waltzed to its seventh win
in a row this season with an un
believably easy 33-3 win over the
University of Santa Clara on the
Card rugby field yesterday.
The Stanford team, composed
of junior varsity and second line
varsity ruggers, led at half time
by a 16-3 bulge and had difficulty
in keeping down to only IT digits
in the second period while holding
the visitors to none.
MOKE STRANGELY still, not
a single point was scored via the
penalty kick route. The entire
Stanford point total came on nine
tries and three conversions.
Kurt Hauser topped the Indian
scorers with six markers, totaled
on two tries. Don Haider came in
second in the point-making derby
with four counters on two conver
sions.
Other tries were turned in by
Clark Weaver, John Wilber,
George Mollett, Dick Shaw, Gary
Lofgren, Hud Wedin, and Dave
Moreland. The last two points
came on another conversion by
Ron Abelmann.
STANFORD COACH Pole
Kmetovic voiced surprise at the
Indians’ easy conquest of the
Broncos. Before the contest be
gan, the Card mentor was worried
that maybe he should have let the
varsity first team have a crack
at the visitors, since Santa Clara
bad earlier beaten a fair Loyola
team.
Stanford’s next meet is with the
'esurgent California Bears in
Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Early in the season, the Berkeley
ruggers dropped a 13-8 decision to
the Tribe, but since then have

comp on strong to post a season's
record of 5-1.
In the last week, the Bears have
upset the University of British
Columbia twice by scores of 9-3
and 1(1-9 to take a 2 0 lead in (he
two teams’ annual World Cup
competition.
THK LATTER WIN came after
the Cal team was down by a 9-0
margin at (he half.
If the Indians can win again,
(hey can clinch their second
Northern California Rugby Union
championship in two years as well
as take the Big Scrum Axe, insti
tuted last season, for the second
year in a row.
DAVIS INJURED
VERO BEACH, Fla. (UPI)
Tommy Davis became the Los
Angeles Dodgers’ first spring
casualty yesterday when recur
ring back trouble forced him to
the sidelines halfway through the
workout.
Trainer Bill Buyler described
the injury as a sprained back and
advised the young outfielder to
rest at least 21 hours.


VERN ASHBY IS one of the better reserve forwards on the West
Coast. He has held that role of Southern Cal's sixth man for all of
his three years with the Trojans.


DUNKING THE BALL, Gordie Martin, is a valuable man to have
around when a couple of points are needed fast. He averages
around 10 points a game, and pulls down the clutch rebound. He
has to be a consistent player to keep Ashby on the bench.
