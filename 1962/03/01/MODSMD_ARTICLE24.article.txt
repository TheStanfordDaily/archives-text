# Track Season Opens
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Spring is heralded on the Farm
by the blooming of the flowering
dogwood, and while the chilly
winds still blow around the cam
pus, the casual observer walking
past Angell Field might think the
men in short pants cavorting
there were running to keep warm.

The more perceptive realize,
however, that the track season is
already in full swing, and that
Coach Payton Jordan’s charges
meet their first stern lest this

Saturday when they run into a
star-studded Santa Clara Youth
Village team.

THE THINCEADS, captained
by mammoth Dave Weill, the best
discus thrower Stanford has ever
had, should be able to keep up
with the rugged competition
throughout the season, according
to Jordan, “if they can compete
up to (heir ability.”
Weill, the 270-lh. junior, is the
“big” man in more ways than
one. But he and teammate Don

Bell will have an early “baptism
of fire" Saturday when they meet
Jay Silvester, whose tremendous
toss of 199-2 is the pending world
record.

Saturday will see Knee other
Stanford record holders in action,
two on the side of the Youth Vil
lage and one for the Indians.

CARD JUNIOR Phil While be
gins the year with an official pole
vault record of 14-4 : U", using a
steel pole. But While, who is
called the “ideal pole vault pros
pect” by Jordan, has switched to
the fibre-glass pole sensationalized
by John Uelses. Already he has
unoficially gone over 14-9, and is
looking forward to still higher
things.

On the other side arc such ex-
Stanford greats as Phil Fehlen
and Chuck Cobb. Fehlen set the
school high jump mark of 0-8 1 - in
1957, and has since raised his best
to (Ml. Ho leads a group of four
Youth Villagers who have been
over that height.

On the Card side are John Fon-
Hum, who’s jumped 6-8 in practice
but never in a meet, John Hayne,
gifted with great natural spring
and apparently recovered from a
broken ankle, and promising soph
omore Clayton Raaka. The event
could be closer than it appears.

ANOTHER FORMER Indian re
tinning to the Farm will be Cobb,
record holder in the high hurdles
at 13.9, with a best mark of .2
seconds faster. Chasing Cobb will
he Indian soph Steve Cortright,
with a best of 14.7, and Bill Wand
rey, who has hung up a 14.9.
Cortright and Raaka have
moved up to the varsity along
with other members of the best
frosh team in Stanford history.
The others include three who set
or tied records; Bill Pratt, Steve
Arch, and Rich Chesarek.

Pratt is the key to Stanford
middle distance hopes, specializ
ing in the half mile, with a 1:52.2
best. Pratt also has a 4:15.7 mile
record. Another sophomore, Robin
Ruble, is the most important man
in the mile, having run a 4:14 this
winter.

ARCH HAS HEAVED the shot
close to 55-feet, putting him ahead
of record holder Jerry Winters at
a similar stage of development.
Chesarek, whose older brother
starred here, tied the 220 mark at
21.6.

Other key men Include transfer
Harry McCalla, national junior
college two-mile record holder,
and John Northway, Rich Klier,
Boh Taylor, Ken Emanuels, and
Phil Lamoreaux in the running
events. Art Batcholder, Chris
Stack. Charles Barth, and Dan
Moore bear watching in the field.
But with an opposition which
includes such names as Bob Poyn
ter, Willie White, Keith Thomas
son. Jack Yerman, and Charlie
Clark, the Indians will certainly
have their hands full at Angeil
Field.

by the blooming of the flowering
dogwood, and while the chilly
winds still blow around the cam
pus, the casual observer walking
past Angell Field might think the
men in short pants cavorting
there were running to keep warm.

The more perceptive realize,
however, that the track season is
already in full swing, and that
Coach Payton Jordan’s charges
meet their first stern lest this

Saturday when they run into a
star-studded Santa Clara Youth
Village team.

THE THINCEADS, captained
by mammoth Dave Weill, the best
discus thrower Stanford has ever
had, should be able to keep up
with the rugged competition
throughout the season, according
to Jordan, “if they can compete
up to (heir ability.”
Weill, the 270-lh. junior, is the
“big” man in more ways than
one. But he and teammate Don

Bell will have an early “baptism
of fire" Saturday when they meet
Jay Silvester, whose tremendous
toss of 199-2 is the pending world
record.

Saturday will see Knee other
Stanford record holders in action,
two on the side of the Youth Vil
lage and one for the Indians.

CARD JUNIOR Phil While be
gins the year with an official pole
vault record of 14-4 : U", using a
steel pole. But While, who is
called the “ideal pole vault pros
pect” by Jordan, has switched to
the fibre-glass pole sensationalized
by John Uelses. Already he has
unoficially gone over 14-9, and is
looking forward to still higher
things.

On the other side arc such ex-
Stanford greats as Phil Fehlen
and Chuck Cobb. Fehlen set the
school high jump mark of 0-8 1 - in
1957, and has since raised his best
to (Ml. Ho leads a group of four
Youth Villagers who have been
over that height.

On the Card side are John Fon-
Hum, who’s jumped 6-8 in practice
but never in a meet, John Hayne,
gifted with great natural spring
and apparently recovered from a
broken ankle, and promising soph
omore Clayton Raaka. The event
could be closer than it appears.

ANOTHER FORMER Indian re
tinning to the Farm will be Cobb,
record holder in the high hurdles
at 13.9, with a best mark of .2
seconds faster. Chasing Cobb will
he Indian soph Steve Cortright,
with a best of 14.7, and Bill Wand
rey, who has hung up a 14.9.
Cortright and Raaka have
moved up to the varsity along
with other members of the best
frosh team in Stanford history.
The others include three who set
or tied records; Bill Pratt, Steve
Arch, and Rich Chesarek.

Pratt is the key to Stanford
middle distance hopes, specializ
ing in the half mile, with a 1:52.2
best. Pratt also has a 4:15.7 mile
record. Another sophomore, Robin
Ruble, is the most important man
in the mile, having run a 4:14 this
winter.

ARCH HAS HEAVED the shot
close to 55-feet, putting him ahead
of record holder Jerry Winters at
a similar stage of development.
Chesarek, whose older brother
starred here, tied the 220 mark at
21.6.

Other key men Include transfer
Harry McCalla, national junior
college two-mile record holder,
and John Northway, Rich Klier,
Boh Taylor, Ken Emanuels, and
Phil Lamoreaux in the running
events. Art Batcholder, Chris
Stack. Charles Barth, and Dan
Moore bear watching in the field.
But with an opposition which
includes such names as Bob Poyn
ter, Willie White, Keith Thomas
son. Jack Yerman, and Charlie
Clark, the Indians will certainly
have their hands full at Angeil
Field.

winds still blow around the cam
pus, the casual observer walking
past Angell Field might think the
men in short pants cavorting
there were running to keep warm.

The more perceptive realize,
however, that the track season is
already in full swing, and that
Coach Payton Jordan’s charges
meet their first stern lest this

Saturday when they run into a
star-studded Santa Clara Youth
Village team.

THE THINCEADS, captained
by mammoth Dave Weill, the best
discus thrower Stanford has ever
had, should be able to keep up
with the rugged competition
throughout the season, according
to Jordan, “if they can compete
up to (heir ability.”
Weill, the 270-lh. junior, is the
“big” man in more ways than
one. But he and teammate Don

Bell will have an early “baptism
of fire" Saturday when they meet
Jay Silvester, whose tremendous
toss of 199-2 is the pending world
record.

Saturday will see Knee other
Stanford record holders in action,
two on the side of the Youth Vil
lage and one for the Indians.

CARD JUNIOR Phil While be
gins the year with an official pole
vault record of 14-4 : U", using a
steel pole. But While, who is
called the “ideal pole vault pros
pect” by Jordan, has switched to
the fibre-glass pole sensationalized
by John Uelses. Already he has
unoficially gone over 14-9, and is
looking forward to still higher
things.

On the other side arc such ex-
Stanford greats as Phil Fehlen
and Chuck Cobb. Fehlen set the
school high jump mark of 0-8 1 - in
1957, and has since raised his best
to (Ml. Ho leads a group of four
Youth Villagers who have been
over that height.

On the Card side are John Fon-
Hum, who’s jumped 6-8 in practice
but never in a meet, John Hayne,
gifted with great natural spring
and apparently recovered from a
broken ankle, and promising soph
omore Clayton Raaka. The event
could be closer than it appears.

ANOTHER FORMER Indian re
tinning to the Farm will be Cobb,
record holder in the high hurdles
at 13.9, with a best mark of .2
seconds faster. Chasing Cobb will
he Indian soph Steve Cortright,
with a best of 14.7, and Bill Wand
rey, who has hung up a 14.9.
Cortright and Raaka have
moved up to the varsity along
with other members of the best
frosh team in Stanford history.
The others include three who set
or tied records; Bill Pratt, Steve
Arch, and Rich Chesarek.

Pratt is the key to Stanford
middle distance hopes, specializ
ing in the half mile, with a 1:52.2
best. Pratt also has a 4:15.7 mile
record. Another sophomore, Robin
Ruble, is the most important man
in the mile, having run a 4:14 this
winter.

ARCH HAS HEAVED the shot
close to 55-feet, putting him ahead
of record holder Jerry Winters at
a similar stage of development.
Chesarek, whose older brother
starred here, tied the 220 mark at
21.6.

Other key men Include transfer
Harry McCalla, national junior
college two-mile record holder,
and John Northway, Rich Klier,
Boh Taylor, Ken Emanuels, and
Phil Lamoreaux in the running
events. Art Batcholder, Chris
Stack. Charles Barth, and Dan
Moore bear watching in the field.
But with an opposition which
includes such names as Bob Poyn
ter, Willie White, Keith Thomas
son. Jack Yerman, and Charlie
Clark, the Indians will certainly
have their hands full at Angeil
Field.
