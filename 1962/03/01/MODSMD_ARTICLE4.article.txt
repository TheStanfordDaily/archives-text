# Mural Debaters Tackle HUAC
## 
### 
Karen Davis of Lagunita and
Randy Gallistel of El Camino will
clash tonight at 7:30 in the largo
Physics lecture hall on the ques
tion of the abolition of the House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee. It is expected, however, that
the discussion will turn on broad
issues of civil rights and the jus
tification in a democracy for sur
pressing political opposition.
The event is the final round of
the first annual “Issues of Chal
lenge” intramural debate tourna
ment, sponsored by the Speech
Asssociation, which began six
weeks ago. After three prelim
inary rounds, the eight top living
groups were selected for the elim
ination rounds.

The Lagunita team of Miss
Davis and Mary Minor has been
the tournament darkhorse. The
two girls won only three of their
six preliminary debates, but then
upset highly touted speakers from
SAE and Trancos to gain the fi
nals. The Campo pair of Gallistel
and Bob Gates qualified for the
championship round by defeating
Sigma Nu and Muir.
The debates include cross exam
ination of both speakers, thus in
suring a direct clash of issues.
Tonight’s debate should provide
an insight into the question which
is both original and realistic, ac
cording to tournament publicity
director Chuck Bischoff.

Members of the faculty will act
as judges, and trophies will be
awarded after the debate to win
ning living groups and runners-
