# Lloyd Explains PACE Corp
## 
### 
An enthusiastic turn-out of stu
dents Monday night heard student
Jeff Lloyd explain the new PACE
Corps. The "Corps”, as it has
been tentatively named, is being
formed to provide student speak
ers for various activities con
nected with PACE.

Lloyd, who originated Iho idea
of a student speaking bureau and
called the first meeting of the
PACE Corps, explained several
needs which the group hopes to
fill. He cited the four to five
weekly requests to the University
for speakers at local clubs and
functions. In addition, there are
many campus living groups who
may want to learn in more detail
about the PACE program and its
progress. Lloyd has also learned
frome a PACE official that more
student speakers are needed at
alumni functions.

“Wo don't want to duplicate the
work of others.” Lloyd stated, but
rather to coordinate our activities
with the work already being
done.”

Lloyd, noting the lack of oppor
tunity for students to contribute
to the PACE effort, was told by
a PACE official that students
must take the initiative.

The group has been told that
PACE will finance transportation
and lodging costs for students
speaking out of town. PACE
Corps members will mecl next
week with PACE officials to plan
the committee's future.
Lloyd hopes the PACE Corps
will attract the many students
who have not yet found a place
for their speaking talents. Those
interested should call Lloyd at 222
Toyon or Los Arcos.
