# JFK to Announce Atom Test Decision
## Nuclear Testing Necessary For Security, Says Kennedy 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPl)—Presi
dent Kennedy prepared last night
to announce within the next 24
to 48 hours his decision on re
sumption of nuclear testing in the
atmosphere, according to admin
istration sources.

The decision could not be re
garded as final until placed be
fore the world, but informed offi
cials said the Chief Executive
would announce shortly that at
mospheric test resumption by the
United States was necessary for
national security and safety of
the free world.

The President was expected to
go before the nation by tomor
row night with a radio and tele
vision report on his long-awaited
decision and reasons for it.
Kennedy’s decision was based
on a long scientific study of the
massive test series of over 50 at
mospheric explosions set off by
the Soviet Union last year. He
told a news conference two weeks
ago that by Feb. 28 “we will be
in a position to make a decision.”
THE EXPERT analysis has
been studied by the President
with some of his highest advisers
in recent days. The results, as re
flected in some official quarters
last night, was that effects of the
Russian tests left this country
little choice but to go ahead with
her own nuclear weapons devel
opment.

The White House attempted to
keep a tight secrecy lid on the
timing of the President’s decision
which—if it is, as expected, to re
sume testing—will add to diplo
matic stresses between this coun
try and the Soviet Union.
An 18-nation disarmament con
ference is scheduled to open at
Geneva March 14. In any case.
Kennedy has said there would be
no testing at the British-owned
Christmas Island in the Central
Pacific before the Geneva meet
ing begins.

THE UNITED STATES and
Great Britain want to use the
Geneva conference to drive again
for a nuclear test ban backed up
by inspection controls.
Russia has bitterly resisted any
sort of inspection system which
the West would regard as effec
tive. Soviet Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchov has labeled the ex
pected U.S. test resumption as an
“aggressive act.”
The United States has not held
atmospheric tests since October
1958. At that time it joined with
Britain in declaring a suspension
of all such tests so long as Russia
refrained.

The moratorium lasted almost
three years—until the Soviet Un
ion last September shattered the
test truce with a series of atmos

pheric explosions, at least one of
them of more than 50 megatons.
The equivalent of 50 million tons
of TNT.
U.S. underground tests were
resumed early last fall.

three years—until the Soviet Un
ion last September shattered the
test truce with a series of atmos

pheric explosions, at least one of
them of more than 50 megatons.
The equivalent of 50 million tons
of TNT.
U.S. underground tests were
resumed early last fall.
WASHINGTON (UPl)—Presi
dent Kennedy prepared last night
to announce within the next 24
to 48 hours his decision on re
sumption of nuclear testing in the
atmosphere, according to admin
istration sources.

The decision could not be re
garded as final until placed be
fore the world, but informed offi
cials said the Chief Executive
would announce shortly that at
mospheric test resumption by the
United States was necessary for
national security and safety of
the free world.

The President was expected to
go before the nation by tomor
row night with a radio and tele
vision report on his long-awaited
decision and reasons for it.
Kennedy’s decision was based
on a long scientific study of the
massive test series of over 50 at
mospheric explosions set off by
the Soviet Union last year. He
told a news conference two weeks
ago that by Feb. 28 “we will be
in a position to make a decision.”
THE EXPERT analysis has
been studied by the President
with some of his highest advisers
in recent days. The results, as re
flected in some official quarters
last night, was that effects of the
Russian tests left this country
little choice but to go ahead with
her own nuclear weapons devel
opment.

The White House attempted to
keep a tight secrecy lid on the
timing of the President’s decision
which—if it is, as expected, to re
sume testing—will add to diplo
matic stresses between this coun
try and the Soviet Union.
An 18-nation disarmament con
ference is scheduled to open at
Geneva March 14. In any case.
Kennedy has said there would be
no testing at the British-owned
Christmas Island in the Central
Pacific before the Geneva meet
ing begins.

THE UNITED STATES and
Great Britain want to use the
Geneva conference to drive again
for a nuclear test ban backed up
by inspection controls.
Russia has bitterly resisted any
sort of inspection system which
the West would regard as effec
tive. Soviet Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchov has labeled the ex
pected U.S. test resumption as an
“aggressive act.”
The United States has not held
atmospheric tests since October
1958. At that time it joined with
Britain in declaring a suspension
of all such tests so long as Russia
refrained.

The moratorium lasted almost
three years—until the Soviet Un
ion last September shattered the
test truce with a series of atmos

pheric explosions, at least one of
them of more than 50 megatons.
