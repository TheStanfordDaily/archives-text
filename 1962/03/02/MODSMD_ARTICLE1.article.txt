# 95 KILLED
## 707 Jet Crashes Into New York Bay 
### 
NEW YORK (UPD—An Amer
ican Airlines astrojet carried all
95 per sons aboard to sudden death
yesterday when it nosedived into
Jamaica Bay and exploded mo
ments after taking off from Idle
wild Airport in clear, crisp
weather for a non-stop flight to
Los Angeles.

American’s Boeing 707 luxury
Mercury Flight No. 1 was lost in
the nation’s worst domestic crash
involging a single airliner.
The crash came just 63 minutes
before astronaut John H. Glenn
Jr. arrived at La Guardia Airport,
12 miles away, for a triumphant
motorcade through the streets of
New York.

Among the 87 passengers killed
in the baffling crash of the $6
million jetliner nearly half as long
as a football field was W. Alton
Jones, 70, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the Cities Serv
ice Corp., and close friend of for
mer president Dwight D. Eisen
hower. Jones was en route to the
coast for a fishing trip with Ei-

senhower.
ALSO KILLED were Adm.
Richard M. Conolly, president of
Long Island University, and his
wife, and Irving Rubine, vice pres
ident of Highroad Productions,
which helped bring the movie

“Guns of Navarrone” to the
screen. Conolly, 69. a much-dec
orated hero of World War 11,
gained the nickname of “Close-In
Conolly” for his daring inshore
bombardments of enemy held

beaches.
Civil Aeronautics Board investi
gators flew immediately from
Washington to investigate the dis
aster, the second worst in domes
tic commercial aviation history.
The worst was the collision of a
United Airlines DC-8 jet and a
Trans-World Airlines Constella
tion over New York City on Dec.
16, 1960, killing 134 persons.
THE BIG PUZZLE in yester
day’s disaster was: what went
wrong in near perfect weather to
cause the plane to crash on take
off? Nearly every air disaster in
New York has occurred during
rain, snow or fog and authorities
were baffled by the absence of
adverse weather conditions.

Investigators looking for clues
lo the crash searched desperately
for the flight recorder, a device
carried by all jetliners to record
flight data speed, altitude and di
rection from the time the plane

is cleared to take off until the
flight is over.
THE CRASH, first Boeing 707
disaster to involve passenger fa
talities since the plane went into
service domestically in 1959, came
completely without warning, at
10:07 a.m. EST, before friends
and relatives of those aboard had
left the airport on Long Island 13
miles away from the Manhattan
streets lined with crowds waiting
to cheer astronaut Glenn.

“There was absolutely no com
munication of any kind between
the pilot and the control tower
after the plane became airborne,”
an American Airlines spokesman
said.
Pilot James H. Heist, 58, of
Rolling Hills, Calif., a veteran of
5 million miles at the controls of
American Airlines planes since
1940, had lifted the roaring four
jet plane 1,500 feet off the run
way and vered out toward the At
lantic when the 257,000-pound
plane fully loaded with 15,500 gal
lons of explosive fuel nosed over
and crashed in the reedy, murky
waters of a bird sanctuary known
as Pumpkin Patch Channel.

NEW YORK (UPD—An Amer
ican Airlines astrojet carried all
95 per sons aboard to sudden death
yesterday when it nosedived into
Jamaica Bay and exploded mo
ments after taking off from Idle
wild Airport in clear, crisp
weather for a non-stop flight to
Los Angeles.

American’s Boeing 707 luxury
Mercury Flight No. 1 was lost in
the nation’s worst domestic crash
involging a single airliner.
The crash came just 63 minutes
before astronaut John H. Glenn
Jr. arrived at La Guardia Airport,
12 miles away, for a triumphant
motorcade through the streets of
New York.

Among the 87 passengers killed
in the baffling crash of the $6
million jetliner nearly half as long
as a football field was W. Alton
Jones, 70, chairman of the execu
tive committee of the Cities Serv
ice Corp., and close friend of for
mer president Dwight D. Eisen
hower. Jones was en route to the
coast for a fishing trip with Ei-

senhower.
ALSO KILLED were Adm.
Richard M. Conolly, president of
Long Island University, and his
wife, and Irving Rubine, vice pres
ident of Highroad Productions,
which helped bring the movie

“Guns of Navarrone” to the
screen. Conolly, 69. a much-dec
orated hero of World War 11,
gained the nickname of “Close-In
Conolly” for his daring inshore
bombardments of enemy held

beaches.
Civil Aeronautics Board investi
gators flew immediately from
Washington to investigate the dis
aster, the second worst in domes
tic commercial aviation history.
The worst was the collision of a
United Airlines DC-8 jet and a
Trans-World Airlines Constella
tion over New York City on Dec.
16, 1960, killing 134 persons.
THE BIG PUZZLE in yester
day’s disaster was: what went
wrong in near perfect weather to
cause the plane to crash on take
off? Nearly every air disaster in
New York has occurred during
rain, snow or fog and authorities
were baffled by the absence of
adverse weather conditions.

Investigators looking for clues
lo the crash searched desperately
for the flight recorder, a device
carried by all jetliners to record
flight data speed, altitude and di
rection from the time the plane

is cleared to take off until the
flight is over.
THE CRASH, first Boeing 707
disaster to involve passenger fa
talities since the plane went into
service domestically in 1959, came
completely without warning, at
10:07 a.m. EST, before friends
and relatives of those aboard had
left the airport on Long Island 13
miles away from the Manhattan
streets lined with crowds waiting
to cheer astronaut Glenn.

“There was absolutely no com
munication of any kind between
the pilot and the control tower
after the plane became airborne,”
an American Airlines spokesman
said.
Pilot James H. Heist, 58, of
Rolling Hills, Calif., a veteran of
5 million miles at the controls of
American Airlines planes since
1940, had lifted the roaring four
jet plane 1,500 feet off the run
way and vered out toward the At
lantic when the 257,000-pound
plane fully loaded with 15,500 gal
lons of explosive fuel nosed over
