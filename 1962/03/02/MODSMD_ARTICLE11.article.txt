# Poll Indicates SU Students' Political Views
## 
### 
The Political Union’s poll dem
onstrated that the majority of
Stanford undergrads are Republi
cans, but more would prefer to be
called moderates than conserva
tives with no strict adherence to
party line. The vote on capital
punishment was about even, yet
a substantial majority were for
Right-to-Work laws. While being
extremely oriented to the UN, a
majority felt that there are prin
ciples that are not to be sacrificed
even at the cost of war.

Monday evening the Political
Union administered a political
poll to 575 Stanford undergrads
in fifteen living groups. It tried
to maintain an even representa
tion of Stanford students.

MOST OF the students prefer
red to be identified with the Re
publican party: 302 Republicans to
174 Democrats, and many took
the label “moderate”: 240 Moder
ate, 149 Liberals, 110 Conserva
tives, 23 Socialists. Kennedy re
ceived the most votes as the man
most closely identified with their
political views: Kennedy 146, Nix
on 92, Rockefeller 83, Goldwater
61.
The students wore clearly
against the federal government
increasing its scope of Medical
Care: 315-no, 210-yes. Although a
large majority was in favor of
increasing the federal aid to pub
lic schools: 421-yes, 139-no.
THE House Committee on Un-
American Activities won a ma
jority vote for existence: 328-yes,
214-no; however, the students
seemed to feel that the HUAC
needed to be reformed: 242-yes,
230-no.
Even if the time arrives when
the US is out-voted in a majority
of cases in the UN, a large ma
jority favored remaining in the
UN: 484-yes, 67-no. Wooing the
satellite nations (i.e. Poland and
Yugoslavia) with monetary and
manufacturing products was in
vogue: 341-yes, 197-no; but, the
students seemed to feel the US
was justified in equipping and
aiding the Cuban invasion: 277-
yes, 267-no.
