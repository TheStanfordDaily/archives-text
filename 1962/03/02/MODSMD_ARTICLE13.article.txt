# LASSU Approves Stern Coed Housing Experiment
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
LASSU last night approved recommending the conversion of
Holladay and Fremont Houses of Stem Hall into a coeducational
housing unit to he occupied autumn quarter, 1962.
Rick Muller, chairman of the Committee on Undergraduate
Housing, presented a detailed proposal for LASSU to recommend
to the administration.
Holladay would house forty women and Fremont, sixty men,
all chosen on a voluntary basis. Non-coeducationul lounge facilities
would be provided, and provision would be made to prevent
passage between the upper floors of Fremont and Holladay,
Social regulations would be created especially for this unit,
wdth an integrated house system but separate social programs.
The houses would cat in communicating dining rooms.
And as a special concession to the ladies, bathtubs would be

►provided in the Holladay lava
tories.
This program, Muller report
ed, was drawn up after the com
mittee had inspected the two
houses, with special attention to
their habitability for women.
They reported the facilities were
ideal for feminine living.
Two sui’veys were presented.
One, of students from overseas
campuses who had had experience
with coeducational living there,
showed 80 per cent in favor of
coed housing.
QUESTIONNAIRES were pass
ed out at all women’s living
groups except one of the Flo Mo
houses. 101 girls expressed defi
nite interest and another 69 said
they would consider living in coed
housing, out of 702 who answered.
As only forty girls are needed,
there would be no trouble filling
Holladay.
Another argument presented
for coed housing was that it
would be a useful experiment be
fore a decision is made on making
the proposed Robert Moore coed
ucational.
Sue Davidson asked why did
this have to happen in 1962, and
was answered that a thorough
study had been made, that the
idea had been approved by a fac
ulty committee in 1960, that the
experience will be useful towards
Ro Mo, and why wait?
BUI) BATTS questioned the
need of such specific recommend
ations, and Charlie Lofgren won
dered if its giving a date and pre
scribing action might be taken as
an affront by the administration.
With shortening tempers, Bob
Saylor and Bob Philibosian said
that the proposal was neither too
specific nor an affront: the Ad
ministration asked student ideas
on coed housing, and the more
specific they are, the better
thought out and investigated they
are shown to be.
The recommendation was pass
ed without a dissenting vote.
LASSU also heard reports by
Jim Rogers on Winter Drives and
by Roy Cairncross on the new
Union.
THE AWS By-Laws amend
ment was distributed for action
at next week’s meeting; and Me
linda Gartsman was approved to
replace Chuck Bischoff as Elec
tions Chairman, as he will be at
the West Point National Debate
Tournament during the elections.
LASSU adjourned at 8 to a
happy hour at Bud Ratt’s place in
Palo Alto.
