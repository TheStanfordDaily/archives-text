# Censorship: Another Time, Another Place

There's more than one way to burn a book. Ask the school
superintendent and the Unified School District Board in El Se
gnndo.
The issue there is not over “Tropic of Cancer” or “Lady Chat
terly’s Lover” or even “Tarzan." This time it's two magazines. The
New Republic and the Reporter.
School Hoard President Warren F. MacQneen said that the
parents of some students have told the administration that they 1
did not care to have their children reading these magazines. So j
MacQneen banned them from the classrooms. Half a dozen social
studies teachers questioned this move and two of them made the
issue pnblie. For this the two were reprimanded.
School Board President Charles Schumann said that the pub
lic reaction to the banning ol the magazines “subjected the com
munity and the hoard to ridicule and criticism. MacQneen rec
ommended that only Time and Newsweek be read in the class
rooms and that if any student wanted anything as controversial
(and thought-provoking) as The New Republic and the Reporter, |
be get it from the school library with the permission of bis teacher, i
That the objections of a few parents should be enough to keep i
two magazine's from being used in a classroom is ludicrous enough.
But that teachers w ho realized there was a larger issue involved
should be censured is enough evidence to accuse the El Segnndo
school board of unwarranted interference in its classrooms.
Such interference doesn’t speak well for the concept of freedom
which the members of the school board learned while they were ,
in school. They should let their teachers alone to do a better job
with their present students.
