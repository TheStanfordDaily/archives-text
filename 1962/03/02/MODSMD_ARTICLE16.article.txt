NO TIAIK
Editor, The Daily;
I was impressed by Dr. Stokes’
eloquent, reasonable defense of
the semester plan, but I was irri
tated at his back handed swipe at
the sanctity of vacations, and I
look with alarm at the opportuni
ties the semester system provides
for the Captain Blighs of the aca
demic high seas.
Many teachers seem convinced
that students vanish into air when
not in a bar. a classroom, or a
library. Students and teachers
alike complain about apathy and
illiteracy. But you need a good
deal of time to be enthusiastic
and literate not the ‘running
around’ time needed for the usual
student committees, hut time to
sit down, look out a window and
think.
AS A LONG time staff member
and sometime editor of Sequoia, I
know how little time is available
for independent creative work.
Have students seen the genesis of
racial tension in Mississippi
towns, have they eaten mush
rooms in Mexico, done brilliant
experiments in physics or picket
ed laboratories?
Sure they have. And they sim
ply have no time to write about
these experiences. Much is lost to
them; everything is lost to the
rest of us. Heading and writing
essays, fiction and poetry, except
under the indulgence of a course,
are scarcely respectable.
I snatch time from my required
work, and my friends say, “You
have to read/write a novel!” No,
I don’t have time, according to the
theoretical demands of the quar
ter system. When do students
read “Ulysses” or “War and
Peace” or “Behaviorism,” write
stories, hunt for Indian relics?
Not during the academic term. It
does no good for a teacher to rec
ommend we read “Faust” if he
leaves us no time to do so, and I
am wary of a system which would
allow a teacher to assign a paper
to he written over Christmas va
cation.

AS A GIHL at Stanford I allow
myself to be treated like a moral
suckling, I am forced to pay ex
orbitant prices for mediocre food,
and 1 live in an over-crowded dor
mitory on a rigidly “residence”
campus.
My objections so far are few. or
feeble. But I do demand lime to
myself to read and think, and to
write. The lecture system of a
large university and Stanford
isn’t going to get any smaller—
results in students of necessity
writing papers for Dr. Millmoss’
number two grader—and after a
little more than three years here,
I am convinced that when I have
done a lecture course paper, I
should do best to burn the paper
and keep my outline and the file
cards I painfully filled out in the
library.
Of course a semester system as
Dr. Stokes imagines it would bo
an improvement, as long as teach
ers used a semester’s rime for
thoughtful presentation and dis
cussion of what is now crammed
into a quarter; but I am afraid of
those who would double their
reading lists, who would suggest
that with so much more time stu
dents could take five courses
where they now take four.
AND WHAT about teachers
who happen to be writers and
scholars and research scientists,
who find in the quarter system
to take three months off, beyond
the opportunity to take three
months off, beyond the summer
vacation, to write? Dr. Millmoss
doesn’t have time to write his
“Life of Pasteur” between daily
lectures, and Miss Rascoe has no
time to read it.
Teachers and students at a uni
versity should educate them
selves; I would like to keep the
university from too solicitously
doing it for us.
Judith Kascoe
LABELS
Editor, The Daily;
Although I am among those
who do deplore the attaching of

such labels as “conservative” or
“liberal” to persons or groups, I
do of course recognize that such
terms may be used as a conveni
ent shorthand to identify general
positions on the political spec
trums.
But when in successive issues
of The Daily I read that Senator
Javits is a conservative. Senator
Kuchel is an affirmed moderate,
and that Goldwater Republicans
are ultraconservatives, I begin to
wonder if these labels are of any
practical use whatsoever in some
hands.
For 1 instance if Goldwater con
servatives are ultraconservatives
or members of the radical right,
just where do we place members
of the John Birch Society, let
alone such lunatic fringe groups
as the Minulemen which are usu
ally termed ultrarightist.
Following The Daily’s scheme
of classification, I believe that we
can safely characterize Stevenson
and Bowles as middle-of-the-road
ers. Furthermore, Gus Hall and
Mr. Khrushchev could be called
avowed liberals, and we might
even be so hold as to say that
Lenin was suspected of being
just a little pink!

writing papers for Dr. Millmoss’
number two grader—and after a
little more than three years here,
I am convinced that when I have
done a lecture course paper, I
should do best to burn the paper
and keep my outline and the file
cards I painfully filled out in the
library.
Of course a semester system as
Dr. Stokes imagines it would bo
an improvement, as long as teach
ers used a semester’s rime for
thoughtful presentation and dis
cussion of what is now crammed
into a quarter; but I am afraid of
those who would double their
reading lists, who would suggest
that with so much more time stu
dents could take five courses
where they now take four.
AND WHAT about teachers
who happen to be writers and
scholars and research scientists,
who find in the quarter system
to take three months off, beyond
the opportunity to take three
months off, beyond the summer
vacation, to write? Dr. Millmoss
doesn’t have time to write his
“Life of Pasteur” between daily
lectures, and Miss Rascoe has no
time to read it.
Teachers and students at a uni
versity should educate them
selves; I would like to keep the
university from too solicitously
doing it for us.

Although I am among those
who do deplore the attaching of

such labels as “conservative” or
“liberal” to persons or groups, I
do of course recognize that such
terms may be used as a conveni
ent shorthand to identify general
positions on the political spec
trums.
But when in successive issues
of The Daily I read that Senator
Javits is a conservative. Senator
Kuchel is an affirmed moderate,
and that Goldwater Republicans
are ultraconservatives, I begin to
wonder if these labels are of any
practical use whatsoever in some
hands.
For 1 instance if Goldwater con
servatives are ultraconservatives
or members of the radical right,
just where do we place members
of the John Birch Society, let
alone such lunatic fringe groups
as the Minulemen which are usu
ally termed ultrarightist.
Following The Daily’s scheme
of classification, I believe that we
can safely characterize Stevenson
and Bowles as middle-of-the-road
ers. Furthermore, Gus Hall and
Mr. Khrushchev could be called
avowed liberals, and we might
even be so hold as to say that
Lenin was suspected of being
just a little pink!

I was impressed by Dr. Stokes’
eloquent, reasonable defense of
the semester plan, but I was irri
tated at his back handed swipe at
the sanctity of vacations, and I
look with alarm at the opportuni
ties the semester system provides
for the Captain Blighs of the aca
demic high seas.
Many teachers seem convinced
that students vanish into air when
not in a bar. a classroom, or a
library. Students and teachers
alike complain about apathy and
illiteracy. But you need a good
deal of time to be enthusiastic
and literate not the ‘running
around’ time needed for the usual
student committees, hut time to
sit down, look out a window and
think.
AS A LONG time staff member
and sometime editor of Sequoia, I
know how little time is available
for independent creative work.
Have students seen the genesis of
racial tension in Mississippi
towns, have they eaten mush
rooms in Mexico, done brilliant
experiments in physics or picket
ed laboratories?
Sure they have. And they sim
ply have no time to write about
these experiences. Much is lost to
them; everything is lost to the
rest of us. Heading and writing
essays, fiction and poetry, except
under the indulgence of a course,
are scarcely respectable.
I snatch time from my required
work, and my friends say, “You
have to read/write a novel!” No,
I don’t have time, according to the
theoretical demands of the quar
ter system. When do students
read “Ulysses” or “War and
Peace” or “Behaviorism,” write
stories, hunt for Indian relics?
Not during the academic term. It
does no good for a teacher to rec
ommend we read “Faust” if he
leaves us no time to do so, and I
am wary of a system which would
allow a teacher to assign a paper
to he written over Christmas va
cation.

AS A GIHL at Stanford I allow
myself to be treated like a moral
suckling, I am forced to pay ex
orbitant prices for mediocre food,
and 1 live in an over-crowded dor
mitory on a rigidly “residence”
campus.
My objections so far are few. or
feeble. But I do demand lime to
myself to read and think, and to
write. The lecture system of a
large university and Stanford
isn’t going to get any smaller—

just a little pink!
Paul B. Van Huron
NO TIAIK
Editor, The Daily;
I was impressed by Dr. Stokes’
eloquent, reasonable defense of
the semester plan, but I was irri
tated at his back handed swipe at
the sanctity of vacations, and I
look with alarm at the opportuni
ties the semester system provides
for the Captain Blighs of the aca
demic high seas.
Many teachers seem convinced
that students vanish into air when
not in a bar. a classroom, or a
library. Students and teachers
alike complain about apathy and
illiteracy. But you need a good
deal of time to be enthusiastic
and literate not the ‘running
around’ time needed for the usual
student committees, hut time to
sit down, look out a window and
think.
AS A LONG time staff member
and sometime editor of Sequoia, I
know how little time is available
for independent creative work.
Have students seen the genesis of
racial tension in Mississippi
towns, have they eaten mush
rooms in Mexico, done brilliant
experiments in physics or picket
ed laboratories?
Sure they have. And they sim
ply have no time to write about
these experiences. Much is lost to
them; everything is lost to the
rest of us. Heading and writing
essays, fiction and poetry, except
under the indulgence of a course,
are scarcely respectable.
I snatch time from my required
work, and my friends say, “You
have to read/write a novel!” No,
I don’t have time, according to the
theoretical demands of the quar
ter system. When do students
read “Ulysses” or “War and
Peace” or “Behaviorism,” write
stories, hunt for Indian relics?
Not during the academic term. It
does no good for a teacher to rec
ommend we read “Faust” if he
leaves us no time to do so, and I
am wary of a system which would
allow a teacher to assign a paper
to he written over Christmas va
cation.

AS A GIHL at Stanford I allow
myself to be treated like a moral
suckling, I am forced to pay ex
orbitant prices for mediocre food,
and 1 live in an over-crowded dor
mitory on a rigidly “residence”
campus.
My objections so far are few. or
feeble. But I do demand lime to
myself to read and think, and to
write. The lecture system of a
large university and Stanford
isn’t going to get any smaller—
results in students of necessity
writing papers for Dr. Millmoss’
number two grader—and after a
little more than three years here,
I am convinced that when I have
done a lecture course paper, I
should do best to burn the paper
and keep my outline and the file
cards I painfully filled out in the
library.
Of course a semester system as
Dr. Stokes imagines it would bo
an improvement, as long as teach
ers used a semester’s rime for
thoughtful presentation and dis
cussion of what is now crammed
into a quarter; but I am afraid of
those who would double their
reading lists, who would suggest
that with so much more time stu
dents could take five courses
where they now take four.
AND WHAT about teachers
who happen to be writers and
scholars and research scientists,
who find in the quarter system
to take three months off, beyond
the opportunity to take three
months off, beyond the summer
vacation, to write? Dr. Millmoss
doesn’t have time to write his
“Life of Pasteur” between daily
lectures, and Miss Rascoe has no
time to read it.
Teachers and students at a uni
versity should educate them
selves; I would like to keep the
university from too solicitously
doing it for us.

Although I am among those
who do deplore the attaching of

such labels as “conservative” or
“liberal” to persons or groups, I
do of course recognize that such
terms may be used as a conveni
ent shorthand to identify general
positions on the political spec
trums.
But when in successive issues
of The Daily I read that Senator
Javits is a conservative. Senator
Kuchel is an affirmed moderate,
and that Goldwater Republicans
are ultraconservatives, I begin to
wonder if these labels are of any
practical use whatsoever in some
hands.
For 1 instance if Goldwater con
servatives are ultraconservatives
or members of the radical right,
just where do we place members
of the John Birch Society, let
alone such lunatic fringe groups
as the Minulemen which are usu
ally termed ultrarightist.
Following The Daily’s scheme
of classification, I believe that we
can safely characterize Stevenson
and Bowles as middle-of-the-road
ers. Furthermore, Gus Hall and
Mr. Khrushchev could be called
avowed liberals, and we might
even be so hold as to say that
Lenin was suspected of being
just a little pink!
