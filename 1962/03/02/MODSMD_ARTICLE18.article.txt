will ge underway at 1:30.
At stake in the clash is posses
sion of the Big Scrum Axe. Insti
tuted last season, the Axe goes
to the school scoring the most
points in the annual two-game
rugby series between the two
schools.
Last season, the Indians won
the trophy by outscoring their
rivals by 14-12. Unfortunately,
since the Axe was not yet com
pleted, Stanford did not get ac
tual possession. But this year
Prince Light foot has labored long
and hard to ready the victory
symbol, and it awaits the victor
tomorrow.
THK INDIANS, with a sea
son’s record of 7-0, lopped the
Bears (5-li in their first encoun
ter earlier this year by a 13-3
score and would like nothing bet
ter than to score their first rug
by sweep over the Berkeley
school in more years than anyone
can remember.
Stanford coach Pete Kmetovic
has promised that his Card rug
gers will be “real fired up” for
the Big Scrum match, adding that
the Tribe wants to lake the Bears
down a peg or two after their re
cent upset double win over the
University of British Columbia.
All the Indians are healthy with
the exception of A1 Hildebrand,
who is only a doubtful starter.
