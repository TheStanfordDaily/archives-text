# Winter Drive To Bolster I-Club Budget
## 
### 
Jim Rogers, co-chairman of
Winter Drives for Cardinals
Board, reported the plans for next
week’s Winter Drives at LASSU
last night. The drive, whi6h starts
Monday, will be in support of the
International Club, the official
ASSU host for foreign students.
Rogers stated that legislature’s
“I” Club budget for this year was
too small to fulfill successfully
the aim of “I” Club—to provide
the opportunity for cross cultural
communication between foreign
and American students and to
provide the foreign students an
opportunity to view' more of the
American way of life.
The funds collected will be dis
tributed by a board made up of
possibly “I” students and legisla
ture members plus Dr. Warm
brunn, the foreign student advis
or, and will help increase the
number and variety of activities
which “I” Club holds to enable a
wider cross section of Stanford
students to participate. The mon
ey collected will also bo used for
activities designed especially for
foreign students to increase their
knowledge of US culture and life
—such as evenings at the San
Francisco Symphony.
Soliciting by house chairmen
will take place in each living
group till Friday. The class ex
coms have each promised to sup
port Winter Drives with the
Frosh and Soph classes planning
on having a fund raising activity
for “I” Club next quarter while
the Junior class is turning over
all the profits from their Bach
elor Week. The Drives will close
with a Happy Hour by the Senior
class with both “I” Club students
and faculty as guests.
The purpose of Winter Drives,
as stated by Rogers, is to focus
attention on the benefits of the
“I” Club and to help increase the
opportunities for both foreign
and American students communi
cation.
