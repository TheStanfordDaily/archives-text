# Trojans Invade SU
## 
### Bv KEN DERY 
Card fans will have that infrequent opportunity tomorrow
night at 8 pan. in the Pavilion to see the home troops compete on
even terms with the Trojans of USC.
Perennial powerhouses in the major sports—the Trojans were
rated No, 4 in the country in the earlv weeks of this basketball

campaign but they have not
lived up to their potential,
IN FACT, THE surprising
Stanford cagers slapped the
Southlanders on their- home court
earlier in the season 69-58.
Coach Howie Dallmar’s Tribe
is seeking its fourteenth win
against six defeats.
USC has fallen out of the top
twenty rated teams in the nation
after droping two games to Hou
ston last weekend.
THEIR RECORD is now 14 8.
Leading invading Troy is John
Rudometkin. The 6-6 center is one
of the smoothest players around.
Specializing in a soft touch and

a variety of spins and hooks from
the medium distances, he averag
ed 23.9 last season and is hitting
better than 20 markers per game
again so far this year.
HACKING UP Rudo are Chris
Appel and Neil Edwards at the
guards and Ken Stanley and Gor
don Martin at the forward slots.
Appel, as much as Rudometkin,
makes the Trojans go when they
do decide to go.
The fiery 6-2, 185-pounder is a
hard driver and a tenacious de
fender.
His scrappiness has been one of
the bright spots for USC in a dis
appointing season.
