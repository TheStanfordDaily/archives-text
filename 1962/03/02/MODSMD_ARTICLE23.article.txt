# Horsehiders Play SJS, Minor League All-Sfars
## 
### 
The Stanford baseball team
starts a busy weekend today at 3
p.m. with a tilt against the Minor)
League All-Stars. The Indians also

meet San Jose tomorrow, in a
game to be played at the San Jose
Municipal Ball Park. Starting
time is 1 p.m.
Against the All-Stars, Stanford
Coach Dutch Fehring has sched

tiled Pete Dixon, John LeCompte
and Joe Schultz for pitching
chores. Jim Lonborg, Mark Miller
and Jim Smith will throw against
San Jose,

Fehring said that his pitching
is surprisingly good for this early
in the season. Last Saturday,
Stanford’s hurlers didn’t allow an
earned run, in pitching Stanford
to a 3-2 win over USF.

Fehring announced a starting
lineup that had Tom May in cen
terfield, Greg Post in right field,
either Skip Lawrence or Gordie
Austin at second base, Jack Allen
or Jim Chenu at first base, Bob
Overman catching, Rich Ferraz
zano at third base, Bob Hensler in
left field and Joel Shulman at
shortstop.
Lawrence, probably the Card’s
best hitter has a pulled muscle,
and may not play.
The Minor League All-Stars are
composed of local players who
haven’t yet reported to spring
training. Among them is Marv
Mecklenberg, a Stanford hurler
last year.
