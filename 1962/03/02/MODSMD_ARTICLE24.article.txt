### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Farm track enthusiasts will get
a chance to view some of the
more exotic events in tomorrow

while highly-touted Harry Mc-
Calla will get his chance against
Charlie Clark and speedy frosh
Weym Kirkland and Dave Stine
beck in the three-mile run.
One of the top field events fig
ures to be the shot put, with 61-
footer Jay Silvester matched
against Stanford’s Steve Arch
and Papoose Lome Peterson and
Jack Chappie. Another is the dis
cus. with Silvester trying to break
his own world record, and Dave
Weill and Don Bell in pursuit.
Herm Wyatt, Ed Costa, Errol
Williams, and Phil Fehlen of
Santa Clara have all high jumped
6-10. Sprinters Bob Poynter and
Willie While have 9.4 clockings.
Fran Washington, a 13.6 hurdler
leads alum Chuck Cobb, the var
sity’s Steve Cortright and frosh
Phil Arnaudo and Rick Scherer.
From the opening mile match
ing Fred Abington (4:07), Robin
Ruble (4:12), and first-year men
Harlan Andrews and Paul
Schlicke, to the final relay, the
field is a classy one.
