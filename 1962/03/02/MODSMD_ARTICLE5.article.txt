# British Explode Bomb In Nevada Desert
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD A
small British nuclear device, re
ported to involve a now trigger
and safety techniques for handl
ing atomic weapons, was tested
underground yesterday in Ne
vada.

It was the first foreign-made
atomic bomb ever exploded in
the United States.
Authoritative sources in Lon
don said the blast involved a hy
drogen-type device in the low kil
oton-range meaning its force
equalled several thousand tons of
TNT.
The sources indicated the test
would advance considerably safe
ty techniques used in handling
and storing U.S. and British nu
clear weapons. The sources said
the test also involved a trigger
mechanism on a new design.
A BRIEF announcement by the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
said the British device was tested
by the United States and the
United Kingdom under a 1958 co
operation agreement.
President Kennedy authorized
the test at the request of the
British government, the AEC
said.

The nuclear explosion was de
scribed as of “low yield.” No
elaboration was given, but this
means the blast released energy
equal to 20,000 tons of TNT or
less.
THE UNITED STATES has an
nounced 18 underground atomic
detonations since resuming nu
clear testing.
This country resumed its tests
two weeks after Russia broke
a three-year atomic test mora
torium. The Soviet series includ-

Ed about 50 atmospheric, under
ground and underwater shots.

The Russian series was climax
ed by a 50-60 megaton monster
bomb.
BRITAIN HAS announced it
will allow the United States to use
Christmas Island in the Pacific
for atmospheric nuclear testing.

The United States, in turn, has
announced that Britain could con
duct atomic tests in Nevada.
SHORTLY BEFORE the AEC
announcement, British Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan told
Parliament that preparations for
the underground blast were "vir
tually complete.”
He gave no details. But authori
tative sources in London said that
it involved hydrogen-type devices
in a low kiloton range, which in
volved a trigger mechanism of a
new design.
Safety techniques for the handl
ing and storage of both U.S. and
allied weapons were involved,
they said.
