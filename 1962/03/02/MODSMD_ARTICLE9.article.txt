# Berlin Week Ends with Films
## 
### 
Two social events tonight and
tomorrow night will conclude this
year’s Berlin Week activities.
Tonight from 9 to 1 I-Club, HR,
and German Club members and
guests will dance in disguise at
the Faschings Ball. Since there is
no theme for this German pre-
Lenten celebration, any kind of
costume is apropos—but must be
complete with mask. A commit
tee of astute judges will award
a prize for the best costume, and
at an appointed hour everyone
will un-mask and have to be
come his real self once again.
The party will be held at the
Chez Yvonne Restaurant, 1854 El
Camino, in Mt. View. Music will
be provided by Einar Anderson
and his band.
Rides will leave Women’s Club
house between 8:45 and 9:15 p.m.
People with room in their cars
and those who want rides should
be there then.

Saturday night at 8 the I-Club
will present a German Evening
Abroad at Union Residence. Those
attending will watch slides of
Germany, sing German folk
songs, and eat real German Kit
chen (cake).
