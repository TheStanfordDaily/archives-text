Vagabond Delays
Until Wednesday
The Vagabond, Stanfordâ€™s
student travel magazine, will
be on sale Wednesday instead
of today as previously an
nounced. Kditor Dean Savage
says this is because Stan
ford's literary magazine, Se
quoia, has come out today
and neither magazine wants
to compete with the other one
for your money. Thoughtful,
yes?
