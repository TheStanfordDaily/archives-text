Count no man happy
. . . That ends one of
Sophocles’ great
tragedies, Oedipus
Rex. What new re
search has discovered
is that Sophocles
meant to say, Count
no man happy until
he has seen (and inci
dentally bought) the
new ‘M’ shirt. After
all, how can anyone
possibly be happy
without this new
collar and exciting
colors. 5.95.
