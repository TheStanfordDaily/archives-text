# Winter Drives Will Support the I-Club This Year
## 
### JIM ROGERS Winter Drives Chairman Cardinals Board 
Tire goal for this year’s Winter Drives,
sponsored by Cardinals and running this
week, is unique: for the first time in its
history, Winter' Drives is supporting an on
campus organization rather than the usual
national drives. /

The organization which Cardinals Board
felt most worthy of student body support
this year is the International Club, the ASSU
host for foreign students at Stanford.
After a series of meeting with Tom
Mathai, I-Club president, Joel Meister, HR
president, and Dr. Werner Warmbrunn, For
eign Student Advisor, Cardinals believes that
the I-Club is in need of student body support.
It is true that this support is needed in the
financial realm, but, more importantly, it is
needed in the area of active, personal, in
dividual support.

Financially, I-Club receives its budget
from ASSU through the HR, which acts as
an advisory committee. This year over 500
foreign students are on campus, yet the
I-Club budget is $460. Ideally, money should
come from “higher sources,” i.e. the Uni
versity or ASSU. However, the University
does not make it a practice to give money
to student body organizations. It has the
International Center, which includes the
Foreign Student advisor, Dr. Warmbrunn,
and the office personnel to process the admin
istrative end of the foreign students’ stay on
campus, in, say, scholarships and study
programs.
ASSU, which procures funds from student
tuition, allots money to student body organ
izations according to which groups receive
the most student support. They receive the
larger budgets. Because ASSU feels the I-
Cluh has not been backed by a large cross
section of the American students, it has al
loted it only a "bare minimum,” This lack

of funds has limited the I-Club’s activities.
The money obtained from Winter Drives
will help supplement the I-Club’s nox’mal
ASSU budget this year to increase the range
and variety of activities I-Club now holds to
provide a greater opportunity for foreign
and American students to become acquainted.
Such programs as the Evening Abroad
series, panel discussions, coffee hours, group
discussions and the living groups, Interna
tional Associates, can be multiplied many
times. Money can also provide the foreign
student more opportunity to see American
life —ranging from evenings at the symphony
to weekends at Carmel. Equipment, such as
instruments and international records, which
was lost in the I-Club fire, can be restored
and increased.
The I-Club needs financial support if it
is to bo expected to fulfil] its purpose of
offering opportunities for international com
munication. Cardinals hopes that Legislature
will feel justified in granting a larger budget

to I-Club next year because of increased
student interest.
ACTIVE, INDIVIDUAL, personal support
of I-Club is the most important element
which Winter Drives is striving to attain.
One of the most outstanding opportunities
which a university offers is for a person to
broaden his views and knowledge of the
world around him.
Quoting from Warmbrunn’s article about
“Stanford’s Untapped Resource:”
“Our survival as a nation may depend
to some extent on our capacity to com
municate with other people from other
cultures. And if we are to acquire this
capacity for cross cultural communica
tion, what better place is there than
Stanford, which has become a true
world campus, a microcosm of the
world-at-large. This is an opportunity
which should be captured now since it
may never return.”

I-Club offers this chance to meet, debate,
and become friends with citizens of over 64
countries, yet this chance for “cross cultural
communication” is being ignored by a great
number of Stanford students.
Cardinals hopes that Winter Drives will
point out the benefits and perhaps stimulate
some “free” thought and action directed in
personal support of the foreign student.
CARDINALS realizes that “money col
lected” and “attention focused” will not im
prove the foreign-American student relation
unless each student makes a personal effort.
We are aware that there is a danger in put
ting too much stress on the “utilitarian mo
tives,” for the most satisfying relationship
is not a “pre-arranged” one.
We believe, however, that through an in
creased opportunity for informal contacts
provided by the funds collected, both foreign
and American students can benefit and build
a rewarding international friendship.
