# Gallistel Wins Mural Debates For EI Campo
## 
### 
Randy Gallistel of El Campo
won a 2-1 decision over Karen Da
vis of Lagunita in the finals of
the “Issues of Challenge” intra
mural debate tournament Thurs
day night.
Gallistel argued for the aboli
tion of the House UnAmerican
Activities Committee on the basis
that;

1. Laws against subversive ac
tivity per se come dangerously
close to violating first amend
ment freedoms and should not be
enacted except in case of “real
and present danger.”
2. There is no such danger to
day.
3. Any minor danger which
might exist can be handled under
the jurisdiction of other commit
tees.

Miss Davis countered these ar
guments by presenting evidence
of the “communist menace” and
the value of the committee from
a number of sources including
the Supreme Court, the AFL-CIO,
J. Edgar Hoover, William Z. Fos
ter, and a long list of Congress
men who concluded by voting
overwhelmingly to retain the
committee and increase its appro
priation. She then offered some
procedural changes to curb any
abuses of the committee’s power
which might occur.
Trophies were awarded to the
winning El Campo team of Gallis
tel and Bob Gates, the runnersup,
Miss Davis and Mary Minor, and
the third place living groups,
Trancos and Muir.
