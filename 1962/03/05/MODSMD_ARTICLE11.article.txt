# Khrushchev to Give Major Policy Talk
## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPI)— Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev is expected
to deliver his first major policy speech in nearly two months today
and most observers expected him to reply roughly to President
Kennedy’s decision to resume nuclear testing in the atmosphere.
The occasion is a closed door meeting of the Soviet Communist

party’s ruling Central Committee.
The meeting was called to discuss
the internal problem of pulling
the country’s chronically poor ag
ricultural production out of the
mud.
BUT KHRUSHCHEV also may
range over the international
scene. He has not dealt at length
with international affairs in a
speech since the 22nd Communist
party congress last fall.
It was there he publicly ex
posed the Kremlin’s quarrel with
Albania and Communist China.
He also launched a renewed and
stormy de-Stalinization campaign
in the Soviet Union and other So
cialist countries.
The Soviet Union has not yet
reacted officially to the Kennedy
announcement, but the press and
radio broadcasts have condemned
the decision as aggressive and
atomic blackmail and warned that
the Soviet Union will defend its
interests.
THE LATEST comment came
from the Russian news agency
Novosti. It accused Kennedy of
“atomic blackmail of the darkest
shade” in setting conditions for a
nuclear test ban treaty which it
said Kennedy knew wore unac
ceptable to the Soviet Union.
A commentary by the agency’s
E. Mamedov, printed yesterday in
the official Communist party
newspaper Pravda, said Ken
nedy’s actions were driving the
world “into a new round of the
armament race” and compelling
Russia to “adopt new measures
toward the improvement of its
own nuclear armory”—a resump
tion of nuclear testing.
