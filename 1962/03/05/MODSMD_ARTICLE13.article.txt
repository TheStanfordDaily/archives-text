# Toward a Coherent Policy on Housing
## 
### 
LASSU’s unanimous adoption of the Housing Committee’s pro
posal on coed housing marks the first important step in the insti
tution of coed housing as part of a unified University policy on
housing.
The University’s position at this point is extremely nebulous.
Stanford has no policy on housing; it has, rather, a “concept” of
housing, that is, it believes in a kind of house system, with faculty
residents and associates, house libraries, facilities for independent
study and seminars and places for the meeting of students and
faculty on an informal and non-artificial basis.
But aside from the fact that it is a residence university, Stan
ford has no official policy, and it cannot get (lie money to institute
one until it has one.
The University has been working on the formation of an in
clusive policy for several years. After a great deal of study, a com
mittee under Alexander Miller was preparing to make a recom
mendation to the University, but with Miller’s death in the spring
of J 960, progress was halted.
Recently President Wallace Sterling appointed a subcommittee
to his ad hoc Committee on Undergraduate Education, to be
headed by Ralph J. Smith of electrical engineering. The Subcom
mittee on Residences will probably take up where the old com
mittee left off. It has all of its files and studies, and it is expected
to come up with a recommendation to the full committee some
time in May.
We assume that Smith and his colleagues Robert Compton,
Sanford Dornbuseh and Erie Hutchinson will be meeting with
Rick Muller, head of the LASSU committee, and that they will
make full use of the LASSU recommendations.
The specificity of the LASSU report, the fact that it is the
result of careful study and a large sampling of campus and other
opinion, should make it extremely useful to the President’s sub
committee.
The adoption in principle of coed housing by two faculty
committee, General Studies and the Committee on Student Resi
dence's, ought to he an additional boost to the President’s group.
That the President could send a fuljy formulated residence
policy which includes coed housing to the Board of Trustees by
the end of the academic year is certainly possible.
Its adoption would mean a great deal to the life of the Uni
versity in an area where chaos now prevails. We too hope io see
women in Stern by fall of 1962, And we hope to see the University
with a coherent policy on housing at that time.
