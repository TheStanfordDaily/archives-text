# San Jose State Campus Is Hit By 'Spying on Profs' Furor
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
(Editor’s Note: This is the first
of several articles on a series of
incidents that caused much com
ment at San Jose State College
last week. Today’s article explains
the controversy.)

A San Jose professor who has
constructed a list of 10 ways to
toll subsersive conduct on the
part of a professor, and an alleged
student “spy ring” taking notes
on the lectures of “suspected”
professors rocked the SJS campus
Friday.
Prof. Edward S. Carmick, a re
tired Navy rear admiral, and cur
rent faculty adviser to the SJS
“Students Against Communism,”
was charged in a report of a sub
committee of the faculty council,
of “keeping for future reference”
student reports of subversive re
marks by other faculty members.
IN A I’HONE conversation with
this reporter yesterday, Carmick
stated “I don’t keep any files; 1
discourage these students from
coming to me. I don’t play this
way. It is all an obnoxious lie. It
was either an intentional way to
hurt me, or an act of someone
whose conscience was bothering
him.
“My purposes go a lot farther
back than this. I’m not carrying
on a one man fight against the
cause of academic freedom.
"We’re deep in a war. as most
people realize. Education as a
whole, especially California edu
cation, is not meeting this chal
lenge. There is no evidence of
constructive leadership on our
faculties.
“WE ARE NOT meeting the re
sponsibility of turning out men
and women devoted to saving
our country.”
The faculty report dealing with
Carmick, an associate professor
of industrial engineering, reported
he had made “special note of 16
cases, reported by students, of
faculty expressions of opinion
which in his judgment were con
trary to the national interest.”
The report cited a list, written
by Carmick, of 10 ways to toll
subversive or unprofessional con
duct by a professor.

DEPRECATING patriotism,
suggesting national shame, weak
ening the national posture, depict
ing the Communist conspiracy as
other than a national enemy, at
tacking committees of the nation
al government, weakening confi
dence in the free enterprise econ
omy, suggesting fear of the en
emy, weakening a student’s be
lief in God, attacking the college
administration, and pressing for
socialism formed the essence of
the ten points.
The San Jose administration, by
way of a statement from vice
president Dr. William Dusel, de
nied evidence of an organized ef
fort to spy on professors, but did
take action prohibiting the audit
ing of classes. From now on a
rule will he enforced which per
mits only officially registered
students who have paid all fees to
attend classes.
Charges had included the pos
sibility of “outsiders” acting as
spies as well, and student groups
going through classrooms search
ing for anti-American statements.
C’ABMICK WAS a participant
in the Sunnyvale Indignation
Rally two weeks ago.
The Spartan Daily retracted a
statement—for lack of proof—
which said “an ultra-conservative
organization on campus” was con
ducting organized spying.
In a Saturday editorial, the
Palo Alto Times blanched at the
idea of “self-constituted vigilante
packs of callow youths,” but felt
that “This investigation, however,
should be put into the hands of
professionals .. . We suggest
that the investigation be conduct
ed by the professionals of the
FBI, the college administration,
and the university professors.”
THE TIMES went on to recom
mend that if any Communists are
uncovered “appropriate punish
ment should be meted out.”
As the editorial concluded, “In
any event, steps must be taken to
ensure the confidence of the stu
dents in their professors, and to
permit San Jose State College to
go about its important mission in
an atmosphere of intellectual
freedom.”

A San Jose professor who has
constructed a list of 10 ways to
toll subsersive conduct on the
part of a professor, and an alleged
student “spy ring” taking notes
on the lectures of “suspected”
professors rocked the SJS campus
Friday.
Prof. Edward S. Carmick, a re
tired Navy rear admiral, and cur
rent faculty adviser to the SJS
“Students Against Communism,”
was charged in a report of a sub
committee of the faculty council,
of “keeping for future reference”
student reports of subversive re
marks by other faculty members.
IN A I’HONE conversation with
this reporter yesterday, Carmick
stated “I don’t keep any files; 1
discourage these students from
coming to me. I don’t play this
way. It is all an obnoxious lie. It
was either an intentional way to
hurt me, or an act of someone
whose conscience was bothering
him.
“My purposes go a lot farther
back than this. I’m not carrying
on a one man fight against the
cause of academic freedom.
"We’re deep in a war. as most
people realize. Education as a
whole, especially California edu
cation, is not meeting this chal
lenge. There is no evidence of
constructive leadership on our
faculties.
“WE ARE NOT meeting the re
sponsibility of turning out men
and women devoted to saving
our country.”
The faculty report dealing with
Carmick, an associate professor
of industrial engineering, reported
he had made “special note of 16
cases, reported by students, of
faculty expressions of opinion
which in his judgment were con
trary to the national interest.”
The report cited a list, written
by Carmick, of 10 ways to toll
subversive or unprofessional con
duct by a professor.

DEPRECATING patriotism,
suggesting national shame, weak
ening the national posture, depict
ing the Communist conspiracy as
other than a national enemy, at
tacking committees of the nation
al government, weakening confi
dence in the free enterprise econ
omy, suggesting fear of the en
emy, weakening a student’s be
lief in God, attacking the college
administration, and pressing for
socialism formed the essence of
the ten points.
The San Jose administration, by
way of a statement from vice
president Dr. William Dusel, de
nied evidence of an organized ef
fort to spy on professors, but did
take action prohibiting the audit
ing of classes. From now on a
rule will he enforced which per
mits only officially registered
students who have paid all fees to
attend classes.
Charges had included the pos
sibility of “outsiders” acting as
spies as well, and student groups
going through classrooms search
ing for anti-American statements.
C’ABMICK WAS a participant
in the Sunnyvale Indignation
Rally two weeks ago.
The Spartan Daily retracted a
statement—for lack of proof—
which said “an ultra-conservative
organization on campus” was con
ducting organized spying.
In a Saturday editorial, the
Palo Alto Times blanched at the
idea of “self-constituted vigilante
packs of callow youths,” but felt
that “This investigation, however,
should be put into the hands of
professionals .. . We suggest
that the investigation be conduct
ed by the professionals of the
FBI, the college administration,
and the university professors.”
THE TIMES went on to recom
mend that if any Communists are
uncovered “appropriate punish
ment should be meted out.”
As the editorial concluded, “In
any event, steps must be taken to
ensure the confidence of the stu
dents in their professors, and to
permit San Jose State College to
go about its important mission in
an atmosphere of intellectual
freedom.”

incidents that caused much com
ment at San Jose State College
last week. Today’s article explains
the controversy.)

A San Jose professor who has
constructed a list of 10 ways to
toll subsersive conduct on the
part of a professor, and an alleged
student “spy ring” taking notes
on the lectures of “suspected”
professors rocked the SJS campus
Friday.
Prof. Edward S. Carmick, a re
tired Navy rear admiral, and cur
rent faculty adviser to the SJS
“Students Against Communism,”
was charged in a report of a sub
committee of the faculty council,
of “keeping for future reference”
student reports of subversive re
marks by other faculty members.
IN A I’HONE conversation with
this reporter yesterday, Carmick
stated “I don’t keep any files; 1
discourage these students from
coming to me. I don’t play this
way. It is all an obnoxious lie. It
was either an intentional way to
hurt me, or an act of someone
whose conscience was bothering
him.
“My purposes go a lot farther
back than this. I’m not carrying
on a one man fight against the
cause of academic freedom.
"We’re deep in a war. as most
people realize. Education as a
whole, especially California edu
cation, is not meeting this chal
lenge. There is no evidence of
constructive leadership on our
faculties.
“WE ARE NOT meeting the re
sponsibility of turning out men
and women devoted to saving
our country.”
The faculty report dealing with
Carmick, an associate professor
of industrial engineering, reported
he had made “special note of 16
cases, reported by students, of
faculty expressions of opinion
which in his judgment were con
trary to the national interest.”
The report cited a list, written
by Carmick, of 10 ways to toll
subversive or unprofessional con
duct by a professor.

DEPRECATING patriotism,
suggesting national shame, weak
ening the national posture, depict
ing the Communist conspiracy as
other than a national enemy, at
tacking committees of the nation
al government, weakening confi
dence in the free enterprise econ
omy, suggesting fear of the en
emy, weakening a student’s be
lief in God, attacking the college
administration, and pressing for
socialism formed the essence of
the ten points.
The San Jose administration, by
way of a statement from vice
president Dr. William Dusel, de
nied evidence of an organized ef
fort to spy on professors, but did
take action prohibiting the audit
ing of classes. From now on a
rule will he enforced which per
mits only officially registered
students who have paid all fees to
attend classes.
Charges had included the pos
sibility of “outsiders” acting as
spies as well, and student groups
going through classrooms search
ing for anti-American statements.
C’ABMICK WAS a participant
in the Sunnyvale Indignation
Rally two weeks ago.
The Spartan Daily retracted a
statement—for lack of proof—
which said “an ultra-conservative
organization on campus” was con
ducting organized spying.
In a Saturday editorial, the
Palo Alto Times blanched at the
idea of “self-constituted vigilante
packs of callow youths,” but felt
that “This investigation, however,
should be put into the hands of
professionals .. . We suggest
that the investigation be conduct
ed by the professionals of the
FBI, the college administration,
and the university professors.”
THE TIMES went on to recom
mend that if any Communists are
uncovered “appropriate punish
ment should be meted out.”
As the editorial concluded, “In
any event, steps must be taken to
ensure the confidence of the stu
dents in their professors, and to
permit San Jose State College to
go about its important mission in
an atmosphere of intellectual
freedom.”

Edward Carmick).
