CHANGING THE SUBJECT
Editor, The Daily:
If I may be excused for chang
ing the subject, it is heartening
to encounter a Stanford “conserv
ative” (pardon the label), Mr. Van
Buren, who acknowledges that
Lenin may have been somewhat
more “communist” than Khrush
chev. Most conservatives find it
embarrassing to make the dis
tinction. But this “Godless ma
terialism’ may be less optimistic
about and actually oriented to
ward world conquest in 1962 than
it was in 1917 is a possibility in
sufficiently conducive to unmiti
gated paranoia.
Herein lie grounds, I think, for
a particularly valid objection to
the likes of Fred Schwarz. I am
not competent to judge his every
man interpretation of Marx as
such. I do think Schwarz, as
Marx, is considerably behind the
times.
Most academic courses on cur
rent Soviet politics of course at
tempt to ascertain the actual in
fluence of Marxist-Leninist ide
ology on Soviet behavior. It
emerges a very different thing in
practice than on paper. It
emerges subordinate to the na
tional and international situation
in which the Soviet Union finds
itself today. It is not dead; but
neither is it a philosophy to
which Khrushchev finds himself
able to subscribe religiously.
Communism is a politico-econ
omic philosophy attempting to
survive, just like democracy, in
a real world. We cannot, like
Schwarz, simply label it a “dis
ease’ and thereafter remain de
fensively convinced of its “dis
ease-like” hostility and effective
ness. Its advocates are people;
they differ. Its context is history;
that changes.

SEMESTER SYSTEM
Editor, The Daily;
I find it rather difficult to ac
cept Professor Stokes’ arguments,
both earnest and sarcastic, given
in defense of the semester sys
tem.
The quarter system offers a
degree of versatility not found in
the semester system. Certainly if
a student wishes to study Shakes
peare in greater detail than a sin
gle course permits, he is free to
do so.
It is difficult to believe that the
quarter system necessarily re
quires more class hours and re
sults in less knowledge than does
the semester system. Having
spent a year and a quarter at an
Ivy League college (heaven for
bid), I managed to discuss the
semester system with several
Harvard undergraduates who
were far from satisfied with it:

Christmas vacation is a farce for
many students; the famed read
ing periods are spent cramming
neglected courses or skiing as
often as they are for studying,
unadmirable as it might seem.
One of Professor Stokes’ main
objections to the quarter system
is the emphasis to places on va
cations, for “it is self-evident that
a person who starts and stops all
the time does not get as far as
one who keeps going.” Any I.E.
major will tell you that coffee
breaks do serve a useful purpose.
Finally, I realize that Professor
Stokes is academically oriented;
however, there are those of us
who prefer to combine the aca
demic aspects of a college educa
tion with other interests and with
the experience that can be gained
outside college in an attempt to
attain what might be called a
“character with substance.”
