# BEAT BEARS, 14-0
## Ruggers Victorious 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford’s varsity rugby team kept its season’s unblemished
record intact over the weekend on the way to the Card’s biggest
win of the year, an economy-sized 14-0 walloping of the Cali
fornia Bears.

With the win, the Indian ruj,
feats: (1) won the Big Scrum Axe
for the second year in a row, (2)
clinched their second straight
Northern California Rughy Asso
ciation title, (3) extended their
year’s won-lost mark to 8-0, (4)
stretched their undefeated string
to 15 matches over two years, and
(5) scored their first rugby sweep
over their Bay Area rivals in
umpteen years.

i»gers accomplished the following

half. The hawk-eyed Hansel spot
ted the loose pigskin on the turf
after a Cal fumble and raced with
it 15 yards into the end zone for
the score.

Although Lindskog’s conversion
attempt was wide, the Indians
were off to a surprisingly easy
6-0 lead.

IN THE junior varsity prelim
inary match, the Tribe JV’s
gained revenge for an earlier 14-3
pasting at the hands of the Bears
by handing the visitors their first
loss of the year by a 6-3 score.
The win placed Stanford’s junior
varsity at 6-1 for the year.

Then a couple of minutes later
the roof fell in on the Bears when
the Cards’ Clark Weaver turned
in the most spectacular play of
the contest.

THE CAL hacks were trying to
mount up a Bear scoring drive
when Steve Pursell, playing
breakaway for Stanford, tackled
the Cal runner. The ball popped
up into the air where it was grab
bed by the alert Weaver, who out
footed the Berkeleyite defenders
for 80 yards down the field before
setting down the spheroid for a
try.

The Indians were on the score
hoard almost before the contest
started. Stan Lindskog placed a
35-yard penalty kick squarely
through the uprights with only a
scant two minutes played to send
the Tribe off winging with a 3-0
lead.
By the time the first half was
only one third complete, Stan
ford had jumped off to an 11-0
bulge which lasted until the half
time intermission.

Lindskog’s conversion gave the
Tribe an 11-0 lead, seemingly in
surmountable. But remembering
the Bears' great 16-9 comeback
win against the University of
British Columbia after being
down by 9-0, Stanford did not for
get to keep the pressure on, and
played one of its best defensive
games of the year.

THE SOLE remaining score of
the day was Lindskog’s second
penalty kick, this one from about
40 yards out, a third of the way
through the final period. The boot
combined with the earlier one
and a conversion gave the sure
footed Card eight tallies for the
day, making him top scorer for
Stanford.
Tim Hansel scored Stanford’s
first trv 10 minutes into the first

That the win was the most sat
isfying of the season for the Card
ruggers was obvious from the
wide grins on the players’ faces
when they swarmed around Card
coach Pete Kmetovic after the
game to receive the Big Scrum
Axe.
