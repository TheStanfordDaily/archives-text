They were looking for the big
guy late last Saturday in the Pa
vilion, and when they finally
found him he didn’t let them
down.
It was a “must” shot for Tom
Dose and his Stanford teammates
with but nine seconds remaining.
And Dose hit it, giving the Cards
a dramatic, 63-62, corne-from-he
hind victory over USC.
WITH UCLA already in as
AAWU champs, Coach Howie
Dallmar’s charges were playing
for second place and were tied
with the Trojans at five victories
four defeats as the opening tip
buzzer sounded.
While the Cards looked strong
in the early going, the smooth
finesse of Trojan center John
Rudornetkin and the fine floor
play of guard Chris Appel en
abled the Southlanders to leave
the court at halftime with a 35-31
lead.
Dose, the hero in the piece,
didn't even start as ho was weak
ened by the flu.
THEN IN THE second half USC
started to pull away and always

seemed to be leading by a com
fortable five or six points.
Bui the Indians kept battling
and behind clutch shooting and
some strong rebounding by for
ward John Windsor they closed
the gap to 61-62 with just three
minutes left.
Coach Forrest Twogood’s squad
tried to stall it out to the end
and appeared to be in control, but
with 58 seconds remaining a pass
ing infraction gave the ball to
Stanford.
Till-; TRIBE worked it for the
good shot and Dose was there
when it counted.
Rudometkin hit 24 markers to
lead all scorers while the 6-8
soph, Dose, meshed 15.
For Dose it was his 404 th point
of the season and made him only
the third sophomore in Stanford
History to score 400 in one cam
paign.
