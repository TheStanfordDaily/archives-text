# New Sequoia 'Hybrid, Provocative Issue'
## 
### GEORGIANA HOWE 
The Winter Sequoia is a hybrid produet. Jts main feature,
four views on Stanford past and present, lias been crossed with
er counteracted by—two articles on the Outside World. When
combined with an excellent story by Judith Rascoe and assorted
poems, the result is a rather disconnected but provocative issue.

Lumped together under the ru
bric “Stanfordia” are a reprint
article on Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford from Sequoia (vintage 18921,
an 1899 newspaper article which
labels Stanford “a third-rate uni
versity,” and by far the most in
teresting of the three, a letter
from William James to his broth
er Henry, written in 1900 when
the former was teaching philoso
phy here.
THK ISSUE begins with a trib
ute to the late and very much la
mented James Thurber in the
form of a reprint of one short ar
ticle, “Preface to a Life.”

Among the student-written ar
ticles is a continuation from the
Autumn issue of James Morri
son's article on the Polish econ
omy. This time he reveals the re
markable ingenuity of the Poles
in adapting private enterprise to
a communist government.
RICHARD OFFUT’S eye wit
ness description of events along
the Berlin wall last Christmas is
appropriately chilling.

The third student-written ar
ticle is Raymond Prior’s “The
Wooten Papers: Autumn 1961,”
which begins with an objection to
what Prier calls “the university’s
techniques of simplistic style.” He
then goes on to discuss, with the
aid of lengthy quotations, two
themes written by one Benjamin
Wooten, a “promising” student
who purportedly left Stanford
after his freshman year because
he found that Stanford was de
voted to the sciences as opposed
to the humanities.

THE DISCUSSION of Benja
min’s Freshman English themes
which takes most of the article
presumably indicates that al
though Ben’s style is not pared
to University specifications his
perceptions are both accurate and
meaningful. In fact Ben’s themes
aren’t bad, such of them as we
see. Nor are they exceptionally
good, although the prose is usu
ally better than Frier’s own.

Frier spends too much lime la
menting the plight of paragon
Benjamin, now irretrievably lost
to this academic community, and
too little lime writing about Stan
ford to make any justifiable or
constructive criticisms.
The short stories in this issue
are happy proof of the fallacy of
Frier's thesis. Judith Rascoe’s
“Advisory Conference’’ has a
touch of Joyce Cary’s universal
female and a lucid wit besides.
E. JACK LANE’S “Love Among
the Ruins” is the story of two
healthy people and a marriage
which is conspicuously off the
rocks.
Of the poetry, the best is prob
ably Lane’s tilleless poem.
As a woman resident, thorough
ly tired of studying amidst the
clangorous building of Tresidder
Union, I am thoroughly in sym
pathy with Sonya Michel’s edi
torial objections to The Compul
sory Female Residence Campus.
Sequoia is on sale today
through Wednesday for 50 cents.
