# Coach Jordan Calls Track Meet With SCVYV 'Very Creditable'
## 
### CHUCK RISC HOFF 
Several outstanding individual
performances highlighted a total
effect which Coach Payton Jordan
called “very creditable,” consider
ing Ihe footing and the time of
year, in Saturday’s track meet
with the Santa Clara Valley

Youth Village, the Stanford Frosh
and the Varsity.
From the Stanford point of
view’, the most pleasing develop
ment was the great promise
shown by frosh spring flash Lar
ry Questad. Questad, who comes
to the Farm from Livingston,
Montana, with impressive creden
tials, including a 9.6 hundred and
a 21 flat 220, first showed his
speed in the 440-yard relay, when
he overhauled top varsity sprint
er Phil Lamoreaux on the final
leg.
IN THE 100-YAKD dash, Ques
stad came on strong to almost
catch Bobby Poynter, finishing
second in 9.9 seconds. In the 220,
however, he did manage to catch
the former San Jose star, spurt
ing past him in the final 30 yards
after Poynter made the mistake
of looking over his shoulder.
Jordan noted that Questad is
the type of competitor who is not
overawed by competition, but
puts on his best performance un
der pressure. Questad’s time of
21.3 shaved .3 second off the frosh
mark of 21.6. This mark is almost
sure to go lower as the season
progresses.
Team captain Dave Weill tossed
the discus 185 feet 9 H inches, a
performance which would rate

rave notices except that Weill has
attained such amazing consisten
cy that Farm track fans tend to
take his tremendous heaves for
granted.
WEILL CAME within an ace of
upsetting world record-holder Jay
Silvester, who came through with
a 190T” throw on his last attempt.
Stanford varsity runners won
all the flat races between 440
yards and three miles. Ken Eman
uels, in the quarter-mile, showed
that he had regained his frosh
form of two years ago by turning
on the smoothly-flowing power to
win in 48.4 seconds. The time was
his fastest, except with a running
start in a relay.
Bill Pratt, sophomore middle
distance star, pulled off a major
upset in the half mile as he over
took Olympian Jack Yerman on
the final turn and raced homo in
1:54.1.
THE MILE provided the closest
three-man finish of the day, as
Robin Ruble, freshman Harlan
Andrews, and transfer Harry Mc-
Calla finished within five yards
of each other, in the respective
times of 4:14, 4:14.5, and 4:15.3.
Andrews’ time broke Bill Pratt’s
frosh record by 1.2 seconds.
McCalla doubled in the three
mile, and took the lead after two
laps to pace out a 14:35.9 victory.
Only frosh Weym Kirkland was
able to stay with McCalla, finish
ing in 14:43.0.

second in 9.9 seconds. In the 220,
however, he did manage to catch
the former San Jose star, spurt
ing past him in the final 30 yards
after Poynter made the mistake
of looking over his shoulder.
Jordan noted that Questad is
the type of competitor who is not
overawed by competition, but
puts on his best performance un
der pressure. Questad’s time of
21.3 shaved .3 second off the frosh
mark of 21.6. This mark is almost
sure to go lower as the season
progresses.
Team captain Dave Weill tossed
the discus 185 feet 9 H inches, a
performance which would rate

rave notices except that Weill has
attained such amazing consisten
cy that Farm track fans tend to
take his tremendous heaves for
granted.
WEILL CAME within an ace of
upsetting world record-holder Jay
Silvester, who came through with
a 190T” throw on his last attempt.
Stanford varsity runners won
all the flat races between 440
yards and three miles. Ken Eman
uels, in the quarter-mile, showed
that he had regained his frosh
form of two years ago by turning
on the smoothly-flowing power to
win in 48.4 seconds. The time was
his fastest, except with a running
start in a relay.
Bill Pratt, sophomore middle
distance star, pulled off a major
upset in the half mile as he over
took Olympian Jack Yerman on
the final turn and raced homo in
1:54.1.
THE MILE provided the closest
three-man finish of the day, as
Robin Ruble, freshman Harlan
Andrews, and transfer Harry Mc-
Calla finished within five yards
of each other, in the respective
times of 4:14, 4:14.5, and 4:15.3.
Andrews’ time broke Bill Pratt’s
frosh record by 1.2 seconds.
McCalla doubled in the three
mile, and took the lead after two
laps to pace out a 14:35.9 victory.
Only frosh Weym Kirkland was
able to stay with McCalla, finish
ing in 14:43.0.
Several outstanding individual
performances highlighted a total
effect which Coach Payton Jordan
called “very creditable,” consider
ing Ihe footing and the time of
year, in Saturday’s track meet
with the Santa Clara Valley

Youth Village, the Stanford Frosh
and the Varsity.
From the Stanford point of
view’, the most pleasing develop
ment was the great promise
shown by frosh spring flash Lar
ry Questad. Questad, who comes
to the Farm from Livingston,
Montana, with impressive creden
tials, including a 9.6 hundred and
a 21 flat 220, first showed his
speed in the 440-yard relay, when
he overhauled top varsity sprint
er Phil Lamoreaux on the final
leg.
IN THE 100-YAKD dash, Ques
stad came on strong to almost
catch Bobby Poynter, finishing
