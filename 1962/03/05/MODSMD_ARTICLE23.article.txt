# PLAY MINOR LEAGUE STARS TODAY
## Baseballers Lose to San Jose 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford played about as badly
as was possible Saturday in losing
to San Jose State 10-3 on the
Sunken Diamond.
The Tribe made four errors in
the first inning, which, when com

bined with six San Jose hits, had
six Spartan runners crossing the
plate.
WHAT’S WORSE, two of the
hits were very cheap, and what
could have been a scoreless in
ning became a nightmare for Jim
Smith, the Stanford starter.
Smith started out by striking
out the first batter, but the ball
escaped catcher Bob Overman and
a runner was on base. The next
hitter beat out an infield bleeder,
and, after a walk, a bloop single
dropped in for a hit.
Understandably rattled, Smith

gave up two solid hits, and de
parted. Mark Miller wasn’t much
more effective, allowing two hits
before quelling the rally.
SAN JOSE added two runs in
each of the fourth and fifth in
nings. In the fourth, a dropped
fly ball by right-fielder Skip Law
rence brought across the second
San Jose run. Another infield
single, a drag bunt, aided in the
run production.
Three solid hits in the fifth,
plus a walk, brought in the last
two Spartan runs.
Stanford’s third pitcher, sopho
more Jim Lonborg. was about the
only encouraging Card factor in
the game. He pitched four in
nings, giving up no runs, and only
one hit. He also struck out seven,
walking one.
STANFORD’S FIRST run,
scored in the third, came without
the benefit of a hit; three walks
and an infield double play
brought Joel Shulman in with the
bacon.
Bases on trails accounted for
Stanford's last two runs also.
Overman and Rich Ferrazzano
walked, and both came home on
Shulman’s solid single.
Shulman was Stanford’s big
sticker with two for two, and the
two runs batted in. Team captain
Ferrazzano got (he Indians’ only
long poke of the day. He smashed
a double off the embankment in
left-center field.
STANFORD SEES plenty of ac
tion this week. Today at 3 p.m.,
they host the Minor-League All-
Stars in a game that was sched

uled for last Friday, but was
rained out.
Tomorrow at the same time,
San Francisco State visits the
Farm for a baseball game.
The Minor-League All-Stars
will be captained by a local boy,
catcher Harvey Koeph from Half
Moon Bay, and feature former
Stanford pitcher Marv Mecklen
berg and ex-Cal slugger Kevin
Scarpelli.

In other weekend sports
on the Farm, the Stanford
swimmers lost 34-61 to San
Jose State Friday, and
trounced California 59-36 Sat
urday. The frosh swimmers
also heat Cal, 54-40. The frosh
basketball team lost to USF
60-56 Friday, and to Santa

Friday and Saturday al

Stanford played about as badly
as was possible Saturday in losing
to San Jose State 10-3 on the
Sunken Diamond.
The Tribe made four errors in
the first inning, which, when com

bined with six San Jose hits, had
six Spartan runners crossing the
plate.
WHAT’S WORSE, two of the
hits were very cheap, and what
could have been a scoreless in
ning became a nightmare for Jim
Smith, the Stanford starter.
Smith started out by striking
out the first batter, but the ball
escaped catcher Bob Overman and
a runner was on base. The next
hitter beat out an infield bleeder,
and, after a walk, a bloop single
dropped in for a hit.
Understandably rattled, Smith

gave up two solid hits, and de
parted. Mark Miller wasn’t much
more effective, allowing two hits
before quelling the rally.
SAN JOSE added two runs in
each of the fourth and fifth in
nings. In the fourth, a dropped
fly ball by right-fielder Skip Law
rence brought across the second
San Jose run. Another infield
single, a drag bunt, aided in the
run production.
Three solid hits in the fifth,
plus a walk, brought in the last
two Spartan runs.
Stanford’s third pitcher, sopho
more Jim Lonborg. was about the
only encouraging Card factor in
the game. He pitched four in
nings, giving up no runs, and only
one hit. He also struck out seven,
walking one.
STANFORD’S FIRST run,
scored in the third, came without
the benefit of a hit; three walks
and an infield double play
brought Joel Shulman in with the
bacon.
Bases on trails accounted for
Stanford's last two runs also.
Overman and Rich Ferrazzano
walked, and both came home on
Shulman’s solid single.
Shulman was Stanford’s big
sticker with two for two, and the
two runs batted in. Team captain
Ferrazzano got (he Indians’ only
long poke of the day. He smashed
a double off the embankment in
left-center field.
STANFORD SEES plenty of ac
tion this week. Today at 3 p.m.,
they host the Minor-League All-
Stars in a game that was sched

uled for last Friday, but was
rained out.
Tomorrow at the same time,
San Francisco State visits the
Farm for a baseball game.
The Minor-League All-Stars
will be captained by a local boy,
catcher Harvey Koeph from Half

Stanford pitcher Marv Mecklen

Scarpelli.

SAN JOSE added two runs in
each of the fourth and fifth in
nings. In the fourth, a dropped
fly ball by right-fielder Skip Law
rence brought across the second
San Jose run. Another infield
single, a drag bunt, aided in the
run production.
Three solid hits in the fifth,
plus a walk, brought in the last
two Spartan runs.
Stanford’s third pitcher, sopho
more Jim Lonborg. was about the
only encouraging Card factor in
the game. He pitched four in
nings, giving up no runs, and only
one hit. He also struck out seven,
walking one.
STANFORD’S FIRST run,
scored in the third, came without
the benefit of a hit; three walks
and an infield double play
brought Joel Shulman in with the
bacon.
Bases on trails accounted for
Stanford's last two runs also.
Overman and Rich Ferrazzano
walked, and both came home on
Shulman’s solid single.
Shulman was Stanford’s big
sticker with two for two, and the
two runs batted in. Team captain
Ferrazzano got (he Indians’ only
long poke of the day. He smashed
a double off the embankment in
left-center field.
STANFORD SEES plenty of ac

In other weekend sports
on the Farm, the Stanford
swimmers lost 34-61 to San
Jose State Friday, and
trounced California 59-36 Sat
urday. The frosh swimmers
also heat Cal, 54-40. The frosh
basketball team lost to USF
60-56 Friday, and to Santa

Stanford played about as badly
as was possible Saturday in losing
to San Jose State 10-3 on the
Sunken Diamond.
The Tribe made four errors in
the first inning, which, when com

bined with six San Jose hits, had
six Spartan runners crossing the
plate.
WHAT’S WORSE, two of the
hits were very cheap, and what
could have been a scoreless in
ning became a nightmare for Jim
Smith, the Stanford starter.
Smith started out by striking
out the first batter, but the ball
escaped catcher Bob Overman and
a runner was on base. The next
hitter beat out an infield bleeder,
and, after a walk, a bloop single
dropped in for a hit.
Understandably rattled, Smith

gave up two solid hits, and de
parted. Mark Miller wasn’t much

before quelling the rally.
