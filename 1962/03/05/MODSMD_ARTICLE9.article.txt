# Modern Operas Draw Approval
## 
### SALLY PAYTON RAGNAR NUESS 
Luigi Dallapiccola’s opera
“Night Flight” had its American
premiere this weekend as the first
production of the also-premiering
Stanford Opera Company. The
delicate musical balance between
singers and the elements of a full
orchestra makes this drama-opera
a credit to its director.
The 12-tone technique and Exu
pery’s plot enabled Dallapiccola
to evoke a feeling of the austeri
ty. discipline and isolation of the
pioneer night mail carriers of the
thirties without sacrificing tra
ditional lyric singing.
Singers and orchestra vied suc
cessfully with trying intervals
and alternating instrumental and
vocal solos to produce the re
quired lyric as well as severe
moods.

Riviere is the strong man whose
will must withstand the attacks
of those who allow personal hap
piness to conflict with progress.
It is the struggle of the two
worlds: lone Riviere, who forces
men to go beyond themselves to
make progress, and Mrs. Fabien,
the lost flyer’s wife.
Mrs. Fabien’s cause recalls
much of the older opera’s ro
mance as she pleads with Riviere
on behalf of the sheltered peace
ful love she has scarcely known.
She is supported by the chorus

and a lyric woman’s voice, back
stage. They compose the hostile
and weaker world opposing Ri
viere’s efforts.
JOHN ROBERT DUNLAP and
Gretta Harden, playing these two
parts are involved in roles de
manding both export setting and
singing. Much of the drama’s
tension is carried in their nervous
stage presence.
Champion of discipline and
doomed by the world to the
“chains of his own victory,” Dun
lap portrays hidden compassion
in mentioning his philosophy of
undeclared love for those under
his orders.
Miss Harden, a threatened for
eigner in the airport office, strug
gles with Dunlap, whoso position
of authority isolates him in his
own territory and makes it impos
sible for him to reach out to her.

Robineau, the inspector, is
played by David Giosso, in the
shadow of these two strong char
acters. Pellcrin, who sings a long
exposition of the dangers of night
flying, was well-played by Orva
Hoskinson.
Radioman Patrick Daugherty's
tenor voice, transmitting the
doomed pilot’s last words, was
used neatly against the back
ground of radio equipment and
peaceful stars.
UNDER SALGO’S direction, the
orchestra responded with brilliant

solos and precise control despite
numerous opportunities for dis
aster in their interplay with the
singers on stage.
ALL THE CLICHES of the tra
ditional stage marital squabble
are blown up to monstrous pro
portions in Paul Hindemith’s
farce “There and Back,” the sec
ond selection in the program of
two operas. The modern music
lends itself to the humour of the
ludicrous. The difficult, stylized
movements, exacting score and
satirical costuming and set de
sign are competently combined to
make this a delightful curtain
raiser.
The Stanford Opera Company
has come up with an exciting be
ginning in this modern produc
tion. Serious music drama form is
often ignored by the general pub
lic. It is only in the collaboration
of University Drama and Music
departments whose members
have a chance to discover and ex
periment with new works that we
can hope to sec growing diversity
in opera. Stanford’s performing
arts departments appear to have
taken up the challenge admirably.
“Night Flight” and “There and
Back” will be performed in Din
kelspiel Auditorium Thursday,
Friday, Saturday at 8:30 p.m. For
ticket information call Dinkel
spiel Auditorium, DAvenport 6-
3691.

Robineau, the inspector, is
played by David Giosso, in the
shadow of these two strong char
acters. Pellcrin, who sings a long
exposition of the dangers of night
flying, was well-played by Orva
Hoskinson.
Radioman Patrick Daugherty's
tenor voice, transmitting the
doomed pilot’s last words, was
used neatly against the back
ground of radio equipment and
peaceful stars.
UNDER SALGO’S direction, the
orchestra responded with brilliant

solos and precise control despite
numerous opportunities for dis
aster in their interplay with the
singers on stage.
ALL THE CLICHES of the tra
ditional stage marital squabble
are blown up to monstrous pro
portions in Paul Hindemith’s
farce “There and Back,” the sec
ond selection in the program of
two operas. The modern music
lends itself to the humour of the
ludicrous. The difficult, stylized
movements, exacting score and
satirical costuming and set de
sign are competently combined to
make this a delightful curtain
raiser.
The Stanford Opera Company
has come up with an exciting be
ginning in this modern produc
tion. Serious music drama form is
often ignored by the general pub
lic. It is only in the collaboration
of University Drama and Music
departments whose members
have a chance to discover and ex
periment with new works that we
can hope to sec growing diversity
in opera. Stanford’s performing
arts departments appear to have
taken up the challenge admirably.
“Night Flight” and “There and

Luigi Dallapiccola’s opera
“Night Flight” had its American
premiere this weekend as the first
production of the also-premiering
Stanford Opera Company. The
delicate musical balance between
singers and the elements of a full
orchestra makes this drama-opera
a credit to its director.
The 12-tone technique and Exu
pery’s plot enabled Dallapiccola
to evoke a feeling of the austeri
ty. discipline and isolation of the
pioneer night mail carriers of the
thirties without sacrificing tra
ditional lyric singing.
Singers and orchestra vied suc
cessfully with trying intervals
and alternating instrumental and
vocal solos to produce the re
quired lyric as well as severe
moods.

Riviere is the strong man whose
will must withstand the attacks
of those who allow personal hap
piness to conflict with progress.
It is the struggle of the two
worlds: lone Riviere, who forces
men to go beyond themselves to
make progress, and Mrs. Fabien,
the lost flyer’s wife.
Mrs. Fabien’s cause recalls
much of the older opera’s ro
mance as she pleads with Riviere
on behalf of the sheltered peace
ful love she has scarcely known.
She is supported by the chorus

and a lyric woman’s voice, back
stage. They compose the hostile
and weaker world opposing Ri
viere’s efforts.
JOHN ROBERT DUNLAP and
Gretta Harden, playing these two
parts are involved in roles de
manding both export setting and
singing. Much of the drama’s
tension is carried in their nervous
stage presence.
Champion of discipline and
doomed by the world to the
“chains of his own victory,” Dun
lap portrays hidden compassion
in mentioning his philosophy of
undeclared love for those under
his orders.
Miss Harden, a threatened for
eigner in the airport office, strug
gles with Dunlap, whoso position
of authority isolates him in his
own territory and makes it impos
sible for him to reach out to her.
