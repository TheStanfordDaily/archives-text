INDIANS^
As the bard said
(he must haves said
this once), Neither
borrower nor lender
be, and if you wear
other than R A crew
socks I’ll strike you
one time sharply on
the knee (at least if
rhymes). What the
man from Avon (you
know, Avon calling)
was trying to say was
that our crew socks
are best and only
cost $l. Forsooth!
