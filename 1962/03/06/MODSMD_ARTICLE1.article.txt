# Two Geography Profs Retired, Department to Close

### BILL REPPY 
(Editor’s Note: This is the first of two
articles on the tale of Stanford’s geography
department.)

Joseph E. Williams and C. Langdon White
retiring at the end of the year- is the main
reason, he said. "Getting decent replacements
is a very difficult problem,” he said.

Stanford's Department of Geography will
go on short staff next year and cease to exist
in September. 1963. This means no more un
dergraduate majors in geography and no
graduate studies for degrees in the field.

Williams and White came together to
Stanford in 1943 and were instrumental in
building up the Department of Geography,
Williams is currently department head, and
White established the department and served
as its head from 1950-54.

The decision to dissolve the department
was made irrevocable in January upon action
of the University’s Board of Trustees. How
ever, some geography courses will continue
to be part of the curriculum.

WERT STATED that the decision was not
based on financial considerations, but quali
fied this saying, “Money for replacements
could be more usefully spent to bring in pro
fessors in other departments.” He said there
were few outstanding geographers teaching
in the United States, and that it would be
very costly to induce one or more of them to
some to Stanford.

“Geography will continue to be taught on
a ‘service basis,’ that is, courses essential to
other repartments and General Studies will
not be dropped,” said Robert J. Wert, Uni
versity Vice Provost, (Wort said he was one
of the administrators most involved in the
decision to do away with the department.)
Not all of the considerations leading to
the dissolution of the department have been
revealed. However, Wert has offered some
of the administration’s reasons in defense of
the move.

A third reason offered by Wort was:
“Geography is not a strong discipline across
the country.”
Williams said that geography was a
young discipline, but, he said, it is growing
rapidly and has been particularly well re
ceived in Europe where it has become a
popular field of study.
The coincidence of having both professors According to White, geography is the

newest of Stanford's departments.
Wert implied it was doubtful if geography
had caught on as a discipline. Although this
point can only be a matter of opinion, figures
indicate that geography courses are indeed
popular at Stanford. Enrollment in geogra
phy courses on the Farm in 1960 was 1001,
according to the Directory of College Geog
raphy of the United States.
ASKED IF any weakness within the de
partment was responsible for the decision,
Wert said he did not want to comment. He
did say he believed White and Williams had
done a commendable job in building up geog
raphy at Stanford.
Wert added to the discussion the fact that
Harvard dropped its geography major a few
years ago.

The decision here was definitely not made
lightly or quickly, he said. Professor Philip
Rhinelander, when Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, mot with members of the geogra
phy department many times over a period of
two years. Wert stated. He himself was pres
ent at two meetings held in President Wal
lace Sterling’s office.
“The department had every opportunity
to give proposals for the future of geography
at Stanford,” Wert said. But the plans for-

mulated by the department were not felt to
be the most advisable.
PROFESSOR KIMBALL of Indiana Uni
versity, head of the geography department
there and an authority in the field, visited
Stanford to study the role of geography here,
Wert said. Kimball recommended concen
trating the graduate program. But the Stan
ford department was not in complete agree
ment with the report, according to Wert.
They did not want such a de-emphasis on
undergraduate study.
Wert said geography is a great enterprise
in public colleges which specialize in educat
ing teachers. Schools of educatoin, including
the Stanford school, require geography for
students working for the elementary teach
ing credential. But, said Wert, private uni
versities like Stanford, which do not special
ize in producing teachers, do not require a
broad geography curriculum.

HE POINTED to Cal as an institution
which found it necessary to offer a compre
hensive geography program. The Directory
of College Geography reported enrollment in
geography courses at Cal in 1960 at 1193,
exceeding the Stanford total by 192.
After long and serious study the adminis
tration decided to dissolve the department.

Wert was asked why there was no stu
dent discussion of the issue. “There might
well have been student opinion solicited,” ho
answered; “It wasn’t because nobody thought
of it.”

Robert Sears, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, took a stronger stand. It is “not a
matter for students to discuss,” he said. It is
part of University planning.
Secrecy continues to be the administra
tion’s policy on the matter. Sears said he
“was not at liberty to say” what plans were
being considered to continue geography in
struction for other departments after 1963.
Sears explained he could only reveal this
after a final decision was made.

“IT IS not decided yet how many staff
members there should be teaching geogra
phy.” he said. Inquiries are now being made
as to what kinds of course work in geogra
phy other departments feel is essential.
What about current geography majors
and graduate students? “Special programs
have been arranged to provide them with
work to complete their programs without
handicap,” Sears said.

members.)
