# Nixon and the JBS: A Fine Performance
## 
### 
Richard Nixon, A. |. Leibling once wrote, is a politician who
parlayed a two-dollar bet on Alger Hiss into a career that “landed
him within a heartbeat, a yard of intestine and 112,000 votes of the
White House on three separate occasions and in that order.”
Rut in the more recent days of his political wanderings there
was much talk of a “new” Nixon. Nobody was more concerned
with the harm that Nixon’s reputation might do him at the ballot
box than Nixon himself and nobody more carefully cultivated
the “new Nixon image.
But many commentators expressed sorrow at being unable to
find any substantial difference between the Nixon of the Alger
Hiss and Helen Gahagan Douglas days and the Nixon of the cloth
coat and checkers days, Herblock, The Daily’s cartoonist, for ex
ample, drew Nixon as crawling through the gutter grabbing at
the coat of John (). Voter and saying, “Of course, if 1 had the top
spot I’d act differently." This type of attack wounded Nixon deeply
according to some reports.
But Californians have in the past few days witnessed a per
formance by Nixon that max rank as the most (or only) states
manlike act of his career—his stand on the Birch Society. At the
California Republican Assembly Nixon has brought upon himself
the untempered wrath of the important conservatix e segment of
the state Republican Party,
Among other statements and proposals made by Nixon xvere
xvords to the effect that any member of the John Birch Society
should quit either that organization or the Republican Party and
that Robert Welch, the Birch leader, ran a dictatorial organization.
These statements opened up a great debate xvithin Republican
ranks and Nixon came in for bitter attack from many conservatives,
including his opponent in the gubernatorial primary, Joseph Shell.
Nixon’s proposals xvere xx atered doxvn by the assembly, which
agreed only to castigate Welch but not to announce that the prin
ciples of the Republican Party xxere incompatible xvith those of
the Birch Society. That Murray Chotiner, Nixon’s campaign man
ager in the “old" days and noxv campaign director for Loyd
W right, conserxatix e candidate for Sen. Thomas Kuchel’s seat,
should hax e introduced the measure to xveaken the stand asked by
Nixon, xvas, perhaps, the unkindest cut of all.
Nixon, we think, deserves great credit as the leader of the Re
publicans in California, for refusing to compromise with the ex
treme right and for dealing a blow to its respectability from xxhich
it may be difficult to recover. This may be the one positive thing
for xxhich the career of Richard Nixon eventually will be known.
He has done California a sendee and we hope that this action
truly marks the (‘mergence of a “nexx ” Nixon.

Richard Nixon, A. |. Leibling once wrote, is a politician who
parlayed a two-dollar bet on Alger Hiss into a career that “landed
him within a heartbeat, a yard of intestine and 112,000 votes of the
White House on three separate occasions and in that order.”
Rut in the more recent days of his political wanderings there
was much talk of a “new” Nixon. Nobody was more concerned
with the harm that Nixon’s reputation might do him at the ballot
box than Nixon himself and nobody more carefully cultivated
the “new Nixon image.
But many commentators expressed sorrow at being unable to
find any substantial difference between the Nixon of the Alger
Hiss and Helen Gahagan Douglas days and the Nixon of the cloth
coat and checkers days, Herblock, The Daily’s cartoonist, for ex
ample, drew Nixon as crawling through the gutter grabbing at
the coat of John (). Voter and saying, “Of course, if 1 had the top
spot I’d act differently." This type of attack wounded Nixon deeply
according to some reports.
But Californians have in the past few days witnessed a per
formance by Nixon that max rank as the most (or only) states
manlike act of his career—his stand on the Birch Society. At the
California Republican Assembly Nixon has brought upon himself
the untempered wrath of the important conservatix e segment of
the state Republican Party,
Among other statements and proposals made by Nixon xvere
xvords to the effect that any member of the John Birch Society
should quit either that organization or the Republican Party and
that Robert Welch, the Birch leader, ran a dictatorial organization.
These statements opened up a great debate xvithin Republican
ranks and Nixon came in for bitter attack from many conservatives,
including his opponent in the gubernatorial primary, Joseph Shell.
Nixon’s proposals xvere xx atered doxvn by the assembly, which
agreed only to castigate Welch but not to announce that the prin
ciples of the Republican Party xxere incompatible xvith those of
the Birch Society. That Murray Chotiner, Nixon’s campaign man
ager in the “old" days and noxv campaign director for Loyd
W right, conserxatix e candidate for Sen. Thomas Kuchel’s seat,
should hax e introduced the measure to xveaken the stand asked by
Nixon, xvas, perhaps, the unkindest cut of all.
Nixon, we think, deserves great credit as the leader of the Re
publicans in California, for refusing to compromise with the ex
treme right and for dealing a blow to its respectability from xxhich
it may be difficult to recover. This may be the one positive thing
for xxhich the career of Richard Nixon eventually will be known.
He has done California a sendee and we hope that this action
truly marks the (‘mergence of a “nexx ” Nixon.
