THE SCREEN
The Hustler Fine Arts (Palo
Alto).
Sixteen balls, a felt-covered ta
ble and four magnificent pieces of
acting combined to make this
flick one of the two or three best
of last year. Paul Newman, Piper
Laurie, Jackie Gleason and
George C. Scott have all been
nominated for Academy Awards.
So was Robert Rossen whose di
rection made the world of the
pool shark seem like the most
nerve-wracking on earth.
Compulsion Memorial Auditori
um (Sunday).
Dean Stockwell turns in a sen
sitive performance as Leopold of
Loeb and Loepold, inventors of

The career and philosophy of
Barry Goldwater will occupy the
time of this excellent news docu
mentary this week. Just what you
wanted, no doubt.
Phil Silvers Thurs., 7:30 p.m.
(NBC).
These Sergeant Bilko re-runs
are far funnier the second time
around than any other situation

Liberty —March-April.
A close look at the idiocy of
Sunday blue laws tops the offer

25 (Which Theater Is the Ab

Playwright Edward Albee’s
biting indictment of Broadway
(“It panders to the public need

for self-congratulation and reas
surance and presents a false pic
ture of ourselves to ourselves”)
and the American theater-going
public (“a lazy public which pro
duces a slothful and irresponsible
theater”) is an exciting statement
of the notion of the Theater of |
the Absurd in the context of the j
theater of today.
The Nation March.
A Harvard Crimson Editor and
participant in the recent Wash
ington, D.C., “T urn Toward
Peace” rally provides an analysis |
(“Something Had to Be Done”) !
of the Peace marchers. His pro- 1

Martin Luther King comments ]
in “Fumbling on the New From I
tier” that 1961 saw the Kennedy j
Administration wage an “essen

Pete Seeger Wed., 8:15 (Memori

Few people can witness a See
ger concert and not come away
with the feeling that he is one of
America’s great entertainers. Pos
sessor of a voice that has little to
recommend it besides great joy
and warmth, Seeger is an extraor
dinary banjo player and has the
best folk repertoire in existence.
Our spy says he encored for half
an hour in Berkeley this week
end.
Oscar Brand Saturday, Garfield
Junior High School (Berkeley).
The folksinger of bawdy songs
