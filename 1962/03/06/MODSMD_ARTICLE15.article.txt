# EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
## Right-Wing SJS Prof: 'They're Telling Lies About Me' 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
(Editor's note: Sunday an
exclusive interview was given The
Dally by San .lose Slate professor
Edward Carmiek, the object of
the recent San .lose Stale faculty
council’s .charges, of student
“spies." This is the second of a
series on the San .lose incident of
last week.)
The living-room of San Jose as
sociate professor of industrial en
gineering Edward Carmiek re
flected the life of a military man.
Two antique pistols and a sword,
and a rifle over the hearth adorn
ed the fireplace of the former
Navy Rear-Admiral; to the right
of it was a distinguished portrait
of the man in dress uniform.
And over coffee, the navy man
turned educator portrayed with
an intensity the role of professors
as “area and theater commanders
in a war.”
CARMIEK began, in response to
questions, by denying any part in
“asking students to come to me
with lists of professors. Whoever
made these charges art* simply
telling lies.”
The professor said the source
of the allegations against him
were editorial comments which
appeared recently in the Spartan
Daily charging that organized
groups were spying on professors
by taking notes on lectures held
to be subversive. The statement
was later retracted for lack of
proof.

In reference to the charges later
being articulated by the faculty
council, Carmick saw “people out
to get me” or “professors with
guilty consciences.”
AS FACULTY adviser to the
San Jose “Students Against Com
munism” (“SAC”), whose consti
tution says its purpose is “To op
pose the communist conspiracy
and to foster national pride and
patriotism of America through
education,” Carmick was queried
as to the possible activities of
this group. “I don’t believe in tak
ing things to a student forum,”
he replied. “SAC’s only purpose
is to conduct anti-communist
speeches and programs.”
“I am interested in preserving
our freedoms and in the cause of
liberty. I am a libertarian.”
Carmick sees a line “between
freedom and security. We are in
war now. This is not the time to
push back the line. There are cer
tain things we shouldn’t peddle in
wartime.”

What are the bounds academic
freedom shouldn’t transcend in
“this time of war?”
“SUCH THINGS as world fed
eration should not be pushed now.
We need national determination.
We have a fine weapons system;
our national determination is not

up (o it.
“There’s an urgency In this
thing, a great urgency.
“We shouldn’t peddle the vari
ous types of socialism. The cor
relation between socialism and
those soft on communism is at
least 85 per cent. They are put
ting over ideas that are the same
as those of Soviet Russia’s, even
though they would bring them
about differently. We can’t put
up a defense with our people
against something that is persist
ently being taught to them.
“WE MUST stop the great pres
sure's for Keynesian socialism. If
people are sincere on socialism,
they should get behind our coun
try now as it is. After the war is
over, maybe they will get their
way. I hope to God they don’t."
Carmick saw a great personal
responsibility falling upon the
“theatre and area commanders,"
the educators, as, “Our enemy
gave us a choice: war or peace
ful co-existence. We chose peace
ful co-existence surrender on a
peicemeal style.
“All it says is we can’t win, just
contain the enemy. We can’t teach
the nature of the enemy with this
limited objective; we can’t teach
a positive Americanism under
such a framemork.
“I FIRMLY believe no bomb
will ever be dropped; we will just
slowly be eased out.
There are four fronts of commu
nist infiltration: education, labor,
government, and the mass com
munication media. Education
heads the list. But the conserva
tive professors leave the field
open to the lefties.
“Many of your engineering pro
fessors are conservative, but they
can’t even stretch a point in the
context of their lectures. I warn
my students not to be carried
away by the cleverness of the
word, to think long and twice.”
CARMICK NOTED several rea
sons for conservative silence in
(he academic community: “fear,
stuffy conceit, and unresponsive
ness to their position as public
servants; the tendency of many
to feel it just isn’t their responsi
bility.”
The professor had several rec
ommendations for what is to be

done to counteract our present
situation.
“WE MUST TEACH the enemy
for what he is. There are many
professors who could do this; the
president of the college could do
this; the president of Stanford
could do this. He could come to
pro-American speeches, stay away
from the others. This would be
noticed. He could send notes to
the sponsors of the communist
and lefty speeches asking, What
do you think you have accom
plished?
“You don’t take troops in battle
and let them hear enemy speakers
two-thirds of the time, day after
day. This generation of youth is
far more tolerant, meeting great
er challenges, hut it has lost a
great deal of respect for our
country.
“Patriotism is affection for the
country, and like love, it has to be
manifested. We must go back to

the old verities ... If I were
asked to take a loyalty oath 100
times a day, 200 times a day, I’d
be proud. I lox’e my country.
LARMIER EXHIBITS a xery
specific approach for the educator
to assume his personal leadership.
“A council of educators, J. Edgar
Hoover, and others should get to
gether - and close ranks in an ad
hoc council, define the tactical
problem and assign tasks and mis
sions. I don’t think we would
need to take away our freedoms;
they would still he there for us
after the war.
When queried as to whether he
ever feared extremist movements
on the right in their methods,
(Carmiek stated he was not a
member of the Birch Society or
any other organization. “I have
a personal code: not getting
mixed up with individual issues;
I just do what I can do to
strengthen national determina

tion.”), Carmick stated:
“It is utterly ridiculous, most
absurd, and irresponsible to say
that there is as much danger
from the right as from the left.
I am for anyone who fights com
munism. They are Americans;
they have the same enemy 1 have.
“I am more scared now than
when, on December 7, 1941, I
1 watched from the bridge of a sub
marine, our fleet destroyed. I
knew then we had national deter
mination. we would fight back.
We don’t now.
“Am I a fanatic? I’ve come al
most to accept the title, I don’t
think I’m a fanatic. I just started
talking too late. 1 kept quiet on
campus for four years."

exclusive interview was given The

“spies." This is the second of a
series on the San .lose incident of
last week.)
The living-room of San Jose as
sociate professor of industrial en
gineering Edward Carmiek re
flected the life of a military man.
Two antique pistols and a sword,
and a rifle over the hearth adorn
ed the fireplace of the former
Navy Rear-Admiral; to the right
of it was a distinguished portrait
of the man in dress uniform.
And over coffee, the navy man
turned educator portrayed with
an intensity the role of professors
as “area and theater commanders
in a war.”
CARMIEK began, in response to
questions, by denying any part in
“asking students to come to me
with lists of professors. Whoever
made these charges art* simply
telling lies.”
The professor said the source
of the allegations against him
were editorial comments which
appeared recently in the Spartan
Daily charging that organized
groups were spying on professors
by taking notes on lectures held
to be subversive. The statement
was later retracted for lack of
proof.

In reference to the charges later
being articulated by the faculty
council, Carmick saw “people out
to get me” or “professors with
guilty consciences.”
AS FACULTY adviser to the
San Jose “Students Against Com
munism” (“SAC”), whose consti
tution says its purpose is “To op
pose the communist conspiracy
and to foster national pride and
patriotism of America through
education,” Carmick was queried
as to the possible activities of
this group. “I don’t believe in tak
ing things to a student forum,”
he replied. “SAC’s only purpose
is to conduct anti-communist
speeches and programs.”
“I am interested in preserving
our freedoms and in the cause of
liberty. I am a libertarian.”
Carmick sees a line “between
freedom and security. We are in
war now. This is not the time to
push back the line. There are cer
tain things we shouldn’t peddle in
wartime.”

What are the bounds academic
freedom shouldn’t transcend in
“this time of war?”
“SUCH THINGS as world fed
eration should not be pushed now.
We need national determination.
We have a fine weapons system;
our national determination is not

up (o it.
“There’s an urgency In this
thing, a great urgency.
“We shouldn’t peddle the vari
ous types of socialism. The cor
relation between socialism and
those soft on communism is at
least 85 per cent. They are put
ting over ideas that are the same
as those of Soviet Russia’s, even
though they would bring them
about differently. We can’t put
up a defense with our people
against something that is persist
ently being taught to them.
“WE MUST stop the great pres
sure's for Keynesian socialism. If
people are sincere on socialism,
they should get behind our coun
try now as it is. After the war is
over, maybe they will get their
way. I hope to God they don’t."
Carmick saw a great personal
responsibility falling upon the
“theatre and area commanders,"
the educators, as, “Our enemy
gave us a choice: war or peace
ful co-existence. We chose peace
ful co-existence surrender on a
peicemeal style.
“All it says is we can’t win, just
contain the enemy. We can’t teach
the nature of the enemy with this
limited objective; we can’t teach
a positive Americanism under
such a framemork.
“I FIRMLY believe no bomb
will ever be dropped; we will just

(Editor's note: Sunday an
exclusive interview was given The
Dally by San .lose Slate professor
Edward Carmiek, the object of

council’s .charges, of student
“spies." This is the second of a
series on the San .lose incident of
last week.)
The living-room of San Jose as
sociate professor of industrial en
gineering Edward Carmiek re
flected the life of a military man.
Two antique pistols and a sword,
and a rifle over the hearth adorn
ed the fireplace of the former
Navy Rear-Admiral; to the right
of it was a distinguished portrait
of the man in dress uniform.
And over coffee, the navy man
turned educator portrayed with
an intensity the role of professors
as “area and theater commanders
in a war.”
CARMIEK began, in response to
questions, by denying any part in
“asking students to come to me
with lists of professors. Whoever
made these charges art* simply
telling lies.”
The professor said the source
of the allegations against him
were editorial comments which
appeared recently in the Spartan
Daily charging that organized
groups were spying on professors
by taking notes on lectures held
to be subversive. The statement
was later retracted for lack of
proof.

In reference to the charges later
being articulated by the faculty
council, Carmick saw “people out
to get me” or “professors with
guilty consciences.”
AS FACULTY adviser to the
San Jose “Students Against Com
munism” (“SAC”), whose consti
tution says its purpose is “To op
pose the communist conspiracy
and to foster national pride and
patriotism of America through
education,” Carmick was queried
as to the possible activities of
this group. “I don’t believe in tak
ing things to a student forum,”
he replied. “SAC’s only purpose
is to conduct anti-communist
speeches and programs.”
“I am interested in preserving
our freedoms and in the cause of
liberty. I am a libertarian.”
Carmick sees a line “between
freedom and security. We are in
war now. This is not the time to
push back the line. There are cer
tain things we shouldn’t peddle in
wartime.”

What are the bounds academic
freedom shouldn’t transcend in
“this time of war?”
“SUCH THINGS as world fed
eration should not be pushed now.
We need national determination.
We have a fine weapons system;
our national determination is not

up (o it.
“There’s an urgency In this
thing, a great urgency.
“We shouldn’t peddle the vari
ous types of socialism. The cor
relation between socialism and
those soft on communism is at
least 85 per cent. They are put
ting over ideas that are the same
as those of Soviet Russia’s, even
though they would bring them
about differently. We can’t put
up a defense with our people
against something that is persist
ently being taught to them.
“WE MUST stop the great pres
sure's for Keynesian socialism. If
people are sincere on socialism,
they should get behind our coun
try now as it is. After the war is
over, maybe they will get their
way. I hope to God they don’t."
Carmick saw a great personal
responsibility falling upon the
“theatre and area commanders,"
the educators, as, “Our enemy
gave us a choice: war or peace
ful co-existence. We chose peace
ful co-existence surrender on a
peicemeal style.
“All it says is we can’t win, just
contain the enemy. We can’t teach
the nature of the enemy with this
limited objective; we can’t teach
a positive Americanism under
such a framemork.
“I FIRMLY believe no bomb
will ever be dropped; we will just
slowly be eased out.
There are four fronts of commu
nist infiltration: education, labor,
government, and the mass com
munication media. Education
heads the list. But the conserva
tive professors leave the field
open to the lefties.
“Many of your engineering pro
fessors are conservative, but they
can’t even stretch a point in the
context of their lectures. I warn
my students not to be carried
away by the cleverness of the
word, to think long and twice.”
CARMICK NOTED several rea
sons for conservative silence in
(he academic community: “fear,
stuffy conceit, and unresponsive
ness to their position as public
servants; the tendency of many
to feel it just isn’t their responsi
bility.”
The professor had several rec
ommendations for what is to be

done to counteract our present
situation.
“WE MUST TEACH the enemy
for what he is. There are many
professors who could do this; the
president of the college could do
this; the president of Stanford
could do this. He could come to
pro-American speeches, stay away
from the others. This would be
noticed. He could send notes to
the sponsors of the communist
