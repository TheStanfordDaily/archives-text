Windsor has berm a key man in
the Stanford attack this season,
averaging above 12 points and
snagging about 10 rebounds per
game. But his true worth can’t be
seen in plain statistics. Several
times, particularly against USC,
Santa Clara, and Washington, he
has come through when the
points or rebounds were needed
for victory.
Dose has been Stanford’s high
scorer for the year. He has a 17-
point per game average and
along with Windsor has collected
most of Stanford's rebounds. His
401 points with two games left
make him likely to become Stan
ford’s second highest scoring
sophomore.
St. Mary’s and Santa Clara also
placed two players apiece on the
first and second teams. USF, Ala
meda State, and University of the
Pacific had one each.
Steve Gray, forward for St,
Mary’s, was named player of the
year by the writers.
