# Stanford Frosh Cagers Lose Two to USF Dons, Santa Clara Broncos
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
A smooth-operating Santa Clara
frosh loam outclassed the Stan
ford frosh, 63-55, in the Pavilion,
Saturday night.
The Papooses, accustomed to
playing with a substantial height
advantage, lost most of their poise
against the equally tall Broncos,
making several hall control errors
and continually missing open
shots. They shot a mediocre 33
per cent from the floor and failed
similarly on free throws, 56 per
cent.
IN COMPARISON, 1 lie Broncos
engineered several skillful fast
breaks and consistently made the
important baskets to maintain a
comfortable lead. They made 44
per cent from the floor and 93
per cent from the line, both ad
mirable marks.
Stanford managed only one
serious rally, and that occurred
mid-way through the first period.
After the Broncos had opened up
a 19-8 lead, mainly due to forward
Bruce Asch’s agile faking and ac
curate shooting, the Indians com
bined for nine straight points in
two minutes. Rod Young and
Frank Olrich each hit two baskets
and Craig Cordes scored a free
throw to make it 19-17, but goals
by Asch and Jim Anderson moved
Santa Clara out of the danger
zone and eventually to a 37-26 half
time lead.
STANFORD’S brightest spot
was the play of guard Dick Rags
dale in the second half. With
Stanford trailing by more than 10
points after the intermission,
Ragsdale, a reserve, made three
driving lay-ups, futilely dragging
his team up to 58-51 with about
four minutes remaining.
Santa Clara’s scoring was even
ly distributed among its starters,
who all scored in low double fig
ures.
John Murray led Stanford with
14 points, Ragsdale had eight, and
Young, Olrich, and Boh Garner
all had seven.

USF unveiled a center worthy
to follow in the line of past groat
basketball players from that
school, in edging Stanford GO-56,
Friday.
His name is Ollio Johnson, and
he poured 27 points through the
nets on every conceivable kind of
maneuver around the basket.
Stanford led most of the first
half, but tips by Johnson and
long one-handers by diminutive
(5-6) USF guard A1 Yerkovich
gave to Dons a 31-27 lead at the
half.
Fancy shooting by Rob Garner
pulled the Tribe from a 7-point
deficit back within range, but
USF went into a stall, forcing
Stanford to foul.
Nevertheless, Stanford slowly
came back, until with less than
three minutes remaining, John
son two-hand dunked a missed
UJ3F shot, and that ended the
game for all intents and purposes.
Garner was Stanford's high
scorer with 15, followed by Rod
Young with nine,

time lead.
STANFORD’S brightest spot
was the play of guard Dick Rags
dale in the second half. With
Stanford trailing by more than 10
points after the intermission,
Ragsdale, a reserve, made three
driving lay-ups, futilely dragging
his team up to 58-51 with about
four minutes remaining.
Santa Clara’s scoring was even
ly distributed among its starters,
who all scored in low double fig
ures.
John Murray led Stanford with
14 points, Ragsdale had eight, and
Young, Olrich, and Boh Garner
all had seven.

USF unveiled a center worthy
to follow in the line of past groat
basketball players from that
school, in edging Stanford GO-56,
Friday.
His name is Ollio Johnson, and
he poured 27 points through the
nets on every conceivable kind of
maneuver around the basket.
Stanford led most of the first
half, but tips by Johnson and
long one-handers by diminutive
(5-6) USF guard A1 Yerkovich
gave to Dons a 31-27 lead at the
half.
Fancy shooting by Rob Garner
pulled the Tribe from a 7-point
deficit back within range, but
USF went into a stall, forcing
Stanford to foul.
Nevertheless, Stanford slowly
came back, until with less than
three minutes remaining, John
son two-hand dunked a missed
UJ3F shot, and that ended the
game for all intents and purposes.
Garner was Stanford's high
scorer with 15, followed by Rod
Young with nine,

The Papooses, accustomed to
playing with a substantial height
advantage, lost most of their poise
against the equally tall Broncos,
making several hall control errors
and continually missing open
shots. They shot a mediocre 33
per cent from the floor and failed
similarly on free throws, 56 per
cent.
IN COMPARISON, 1 lie Broncos

Stanford managed only one
serious rally, and that occurred
mid-way through the first period.
After the Broncos had opened up
a 19-8 lead, mainly due to forward
Bruce Asch’s agile faking and ac

bined for nine straight points in
two minutes. Rod Young and

and Craig Cordes scored a free
