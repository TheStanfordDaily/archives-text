# Foreign Ministers Meet at Geneva; French Boycott
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPH- Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev has
accepted an Anglo-American pro
posal to hold a foreign ministers
meeting in Geneva this month in
an attempt to break the deadlock
over disarmament and nuclear

testing.
The White House said yester
day that President Kennedy has
received a message on the subject
of the disarmament conference.

Although the White House de
clined to comment, other sources
said that in the message which
arrived Sunday Khrushchev reluc
tantly agreed to send Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko to Ge
nova for the disarmament ses
sions starting March 14.
Although Khrushchev luul want
ed a summit meeting to open the
Geneva conference, he was faced
with opposition from Kennedy
and British Prime Minister Har
old Macmillan. Reports from Mos
cow said that the premier appar
ently now has discarded any plan

| to personally attend the start of
| the meeting.
Instead, ho agreed to Kennedy’s
proposal of Feb. 24 urging that
; the U.S., British and Soviet for
: eign ministers meet in advance of
the Geneva conference to help
j pave the way for success of dis
'armament negotiations. This, in
turn, could conceivably lead to a
summit conference before June
1.
The new Soviet message said
■ Gromyko is willing to meet be
forehand with Secretary of State
i Dean Rusk and British Foreign
| Secretary Lord Home.
J French government sources said
a short time later that, France
will boycott the whole 18-nation
disarmament, conference, and will
' not even send an observer.
Kennedy’s hope is that suffici
ent progress can be made on a
fool-proof nuclear test ban treaty
at lower diplomatic levels so that
a summit conference could be
hold in Geneva and the agreement
I ratified.
If this happened, the President
| has said he would agree to call off
j the resumption of U.S. atmos
j pheric nuclear tests, now set for
late in April.
Rusk tentatively plans to leave
| here for Geneva on March 10.
j Diplomats said he hoped to meet
•with Lord Home the next day. A
meeting with Gromyko could take
place on March 12.
