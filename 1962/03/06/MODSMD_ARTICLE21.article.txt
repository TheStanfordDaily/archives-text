STILLWATER. Okla (UPI)
Oklahoma State upset third
ranked Kansas State. 78-68, last
night to dim the Wildcatsâ€™ hopes
of a Big Eight Conference cham
pionship and a trip to the NCAA
playoffs.
Oklahoma State jumped into an
early lead and nursed a four-to-

six point margin until finally
opening a 14-point bulge in the
second half. After they widened
(he margin, the Cowboys were
never seriously threatened.
Ken Charlton scored a career
high of 35 points to lead Colo
rado to a 73-64 victory over Mis
souri and give the Buffs the Big
Eight Conference basketball lead.
The win clinched at least a tie
for the title for Colorado, which
has only one more game remain
ing on its conference schedule.
