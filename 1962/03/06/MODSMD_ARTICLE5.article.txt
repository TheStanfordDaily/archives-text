# 'Shoeless Songs' On Seeger Folk Program
## 
### 
Pete Seeger comes to Stanford
tomorrow night. He brings his
guitar, banjo and his folk songs to
Memorial Auditorium at 8:15 p.m.

Instrumental in the revival of
folk music in the 40’s, Seeger left
Harvard after two years in 1939
to find a job as a journalist. Jobs
were hard to find, and Seeger
found himself making a living
by singing. His teachers included
Burl Ives, Josh White and Lead
belly.
Although Seeger is the son of a
Harvard graduate musicologist,
he couldn’t read enough music to
get into the Harvard jazz band.
But the folk song “Cindy” which
his father and folklorist Alan Lo
max put into a collection started
his career in 1937. “What’s that?”,
his friends at Harvard asked upon
hearing the tune. “That’s folk
music.” “Never heard of it,” they
told him.
But an increasing number of
I Americans have heard it. As
I Newsweek put it, "Never before
j have the songs of the shoeless
i enjoyed s'o much popularity with
I the well-shod.”
! Tickets are still available at the
; Memorial Auditorium box office.


FOLKSINGER and former Harvard student Pete Seeger will sing his
repertoire of work, play, and protest songs Wednesday night in
