# Khrushchev Blasts Agrarian Leaders
## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPD- Premier Ni
kita S. Khrushchev devoted near
ly six hours yesterday to a detail
ed failure-after-failure report on
Soviet agricultural production, for
which he blamed “the leadership’’
in part.
Khrushchev’s speech to the
opening session of a closed-door
meeting of the powerful Commu
nist party Central Committee
dealt solely with farm problems,
as reported by Radio Moscow.
During the report, Khrushchev
noted that the United States had
a farm surplus problem but he

said it was “not because there is
nobody to consume these products
in America.” He said “there are
millions of unemployed there who
do not eat enough, and others
who simply starve.”
He made no reference to inter
national issues such as the United
States decision to resume nuclear
testing or the Western rejection
of his bid for an 18-nation sum
mit coference in Geneva on
March 14. Neither did he mention
differences in the Communist
camp, or the ideological dispute
between Moscow and Peiping.

But Khrushchev tentatively is
scheduled to make another speech
on March 15, the day after the 18-
nation disarmament conference
opens in Geneva. He is expected
to discuss the current election
campaign for the Supreme Soviet
Parliament, and observers be
lieve Khrushchev will touch on
foreign affairs then.
In his sharply critical appraisal
of the country’s agricultural prob
lems, Khrushchev cited lagging
production in meat, grain and
dairy products in many farming
areas—including his own pet pro
ject. the virgin lands, Radio Mos
cow reported.
He warned that the agricultural
goals of the Soviet Union’s am
bitious seven-year plan might not
be met. The original target was a
70 per cent increase over the sev
en year period, a goal that had
been considered completely out of
reach by Western experts. These
experts noted that production had
been increased only by five per
cent during the first three years
of the plan.
Among the farm failures, for
which he put part of the blame on
“th e leadership,” Khrushchev
said:
-—The Russian federation could
not fulfill its own meat and dairy
products needs and had to import
vast quantities from the other re
publics.
—The other republics were hav
ing their troubles, too, he said.
The Ukraine ‘‘is lagging behind
the seven-year plan tasks” with a
production of 2.1 million tons of
meat and 14.4 million tons of milk
in 1961, against the target of 3
million and 9 million tons.
—The situation in Kazakhstan
main region of Khrushchev’s
“virgin land” program—is caus
ing “serious concern . . . through
bad utilization of possibilities.”
Specifically, he said, grain pro
duction fell short by nearly 25
per cent in 1961; meat production
was one-sixth helow the goal and
milk producers missed the target
by 10 per cent.
