H You've got to expect punishment out there. Some days it’s
worse than others. You get it from all sides. When you're hit, you
know it—especially in the face. I learned a long time ago not to
trust anything but a remington. Those roller combs suit me fine.
Give me the closest shave I ever got without ruffling the bruises. JJ
The closer you try to shave, the more irritated you’re likely to
get. Only Remington" —because of its adjustable roller combs—
allows you to shave closer more comfortably, more safely. Try it.
