# Geography Department's Close Draws Remarks
## 
### 
(Editor’s Note: This is the second of two
articles on the Geography Department,
which will go on short staff next year and
will cease to exist the following year.)
Dr. John Thompson will be acting depart
ment head next year. On his staff will be
Colonel Harold M. Forde, now with the de
partment as acting instructor. Captain Ste
phen Jurika, Professor of Naval Science,
who teaches Asian geography and political
geography, will also be retired next. year.
“The administration has promised to keep
Thompson on the staff after 1963 by com
bining him with another department,” Wil
liams said.
Courses to be offered next year by the
department on short staff are the following:
Human Geography, Economic Geography,
Physical Geography (landforms), Physical
Geography (weather and climate), Global Ge
ography, Physical Geography (soils and vege

tation), Geography of Anglo-America, Geog
raphy of California, Geography of South
America, Geography of Middle America,
Special Work, Field Methods, Seminars in
Geography of Manufactures and Latin Amer
ica and Thesis Laboratory.
Some courses such as Geography of Afri
ca, now being taught, may never again be
offered.
Both Professor Williams and White admit
they are disappointed that Stanford is to lose
its geography department.
“Many people on campus think certain
small departments ought to bo closed and the
money put into other endeavors,” Williams
said, “Because of the action of the Board of
Trustees it is definitely too late to save the
department,” ho added.
WILLIAMS SAID it was “entirely an ad
ministrative decision.”
Other professors were also displeased.

Ronald Hilton, director of the Department of
Hispanic American Studies, said he felt los
ing the geography department was “most un
fortunate.”
“In the United States generally geogra
phy is grossly under-rated,” Hilton said, “par
ticularly in comparison to Europe.”
“For reasons of internal politics Harvard
destroyed its geography major and set the
bad example," he continued.
As far as the Hispanic American Institute
is concerned, area studies in geography are
essential,” Hilton said.
(According to the Association of Ameri
can Geographers, area studies have grown in
student popularity three times faster than
geography study as a whole. Most of these
courses now offered will probably be discon
tinued unless other departments deem them
essential, according to Wert.)
“The fact that the social sciences have
frequently failed to support geography and

area studies is a manifestation of a lack of
respect which may ultimately bring about
the downfall of the United States!” Hilton
exclaimed. “It’s as serious as that!”
THE GEOGRAPHY department, historic
ally, was created by the School of Humani
ties, Hilton said. “To me it is paradoxical
geography is more keenly supported by hu
manists rather than social scientists.
“White was one of the finest teachers we
have had at Stanford, one who is virtually
irreplaceable,” Hilton said.
PROFESSOR Anthony Sokol of the Po
litical Science department said he was “very
much in favor” of geography courses in the
study of political science. "International Re
lations particularly needs a strong program
in geography,” he added.
Sokol said as far as Political Science was
concerned it did not matter if geography
was a separate department, so long as “geog
raphy was taught and taught properly.”

PROFESSOR Anthony Sokol of the Po

who teaches Asian geography and political

“The administration has promised to keep
Thompson on the staff after 1963 by com

Courses to be offered next year by the
department on short staff are the following:
Human Geography, Economic Geography,
Physical Geography (landforms), Physical
Geography (weather and climate), Global Ge

Special Work, Field Methods, Seminars in
Geography of Manufactures and Latin Amer

Some courses such as Geography of Afri

offered.
Both Professor Williams and White admit
they are disappointed that Stanford is to lose
its geography department.
“Many people on campus think certain
small departments ought to bo closed and the
money put into other endeavors,” Williams
said, “Because of the action of the Board of

department,” ho added.
WILLIAMS SAID it was “entirely an ad
ministrative decision.”
Other professors were also displeased.

Ronald Hilton, director of the Department of
Hispanic American Studies, said he felt los
ing the geography department was “most un
fortunate.”
“In the United States generally geogra

ticularly in comparison to Europe.”
“For reasons of internal politics Harvard
destroyed its geography major and set the
bad example," he continued.

essential,” Hilton said.
