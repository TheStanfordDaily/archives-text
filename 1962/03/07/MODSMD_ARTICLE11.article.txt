# ON NUCLEAR TESTING
## Walter Lippmann 
### 
Since the middle ’fifties we I
have all supposed, and this in
cluded the Soviets, that the easi
est and simplest of the steps to
wards better relations would be i
a treaty to ban nuclear testing. ;
This is no longer 1 hr* case. On the
contrary, it must now be said
that on a test ban the deadlock is
complete, and without some kind
of scientific or diplomatic break
through file issue is not at pres
ent negotiable.
THIS is a bitter conclusion to
have to come to. But the contro
versy has evolved to the point
where a treaty is possible only if
one side is willing to concede nu
clear superiority to the other and ,
to accept nuclear inferiority for
itself. If the Soviet Union would i
agree to the treaty we are de
manding, it would have to accept :
as permanent, enforced by in
spection. the existing American
superiority in nuclear power. The
Soviet Union would have to give ;
up the attempts to overtake us.
And if we were to accept tile
kind of treaty the Soviet Union
is proposing, we would have to
accept the risk that they could
prepare in secret to overtake us
while we could not prepare to i
keep ahead of them.
The deadlock has developed
over the fact that neither of the
two governments will trust the
other with nuclear superiority;
neither believes it can he secure
unless it has nuclear superiority.
There is no prospect of a treaty
because each side feels compelled
to ask the impossible of the i
ot her.
AS IT is impossible for both
sides to be superior, a treaty I
would be negotiable only if there I
were an equality which both sides ;
believed was real and lasting. We
are a long way from that the-1
metical situation. The nuclear art
is young and new and this (level- I
opment is as yet not only unre-1
alized but not predictable.
At bottom this is why the Sovi
et Union has not only done its
series of tests, but is rejecting
I he very idea of the kind of treaty
that we would like to have. With
out testing, the Soviet Union can
not expect to overtake the United
States, and with testing it might
be able to gain a decisive lead
over the United Stales at least
for a time.
We. for our part, will not ac- i
cept the risk of being overtaken,
and wo are asking for a treaty
which will in fact freeze the nu
clear art where it is today. We
are asking that the Soviet Union !
should not test while we have !
the lead, and that it should not

I be able to prepare to test in the
future. The Soviet Union, for its ,
part, is asking us not to test any ’
more and is asking us to allow
i our scientists and technicians to i
work without being allowed to
test their work by experimenta
ition.
I\ THK nuclear race the stakes
| are so high that both sides ape
convinced that they must win the
race There may have been a mo
ment in 1938 we cannot know
for sure when Mr. Khrushchev
t was strong enough politically to
agree to a treaty with some in
spection which would in fact ac
! cept American nuclear superiori
ty. That moment, if it ever ex
isted, passed and since the spring
of Itttit), since the U-2 revealed the
effectiveness of our knowledge
jof Soviet bases, the Soviet gov
ernment has wanted no treaty
: and has devoted itself to prepar
ing to overcome our nuclear lead.
The President’s decision to re
sume testing is intended to pre
vent the Soviet Union from get
ting the lead, and it is based on
the conviction which is also the
Soviets' conviction that there
can lie no security without su
| premacy. While those convictions
exist, there can be no nuclear
test ban treaty.
THI S THK race goes on, and I
we ask ourselves whether it can
ever be brought to an end. To
answer that question, we must
enter the field of speculation.
If we say that the race will end
when there is nuclear equality
which both sides can accept, then
iit may be that this condition
would exist it both sides invented
and discovered an effective antl
i missile defense. The prevailing
scientific opinion is that this is
improbable if not impossible and
i il would, of course, he a spectacu
lar breakthrough. A workable
equality might also prevail if
each side were able to construct
|an invulnerable retaliatory or
second strike force, one which
would survive any kind of pre
emptive attack.
Il is also conceivable that some
time in the future there will be a
i diplomatic breakthrough which
! would stabilize Germany and the
i whole of Europe to the Urals and
beyond. Nothing like that is now
in sight, but it would be a mis
take to say that il is inconceiv
able. We know from history that
ideological and religious wars
usually end not in victory and 1
defeat tun in stalemate and de
flation and disintoxication, and

over the fact that neither of the
two governments will trust the
other with nuclear superiority;
neither believes it can he secure
unless it has nuclear superiority.
There is no prospect of a treaty
because each side feels compelled
to ask the impossible of the i
ot her.
AS IT is impossible for both
sides to be superior, a treaty I
would be negotiable only if there I
were an equality which both sides ;
believed was real and lasting. We
are a long way from that the-1
metical situation. The nuclear art
is young and new and this (level- I
opment is as yet not only unre-1
alized but not predictable.
At bottom this is why the Sovi
et Union has not only done its
series of tests, but is rejecting
I he very idea of the kind of treaty
that we would like to have. With
out testing, the Soviet Union can
not expect to overtake the United
States, and with testing it might
be able to gain a decisive lead
over the United Stales at least
for a time.
We. for our part, will not ac- i
cept the risk of being overtaken,
and wo are asking for a treaty
which will in fact freeze the nu
clear art where it is today. We
are asking that the Soviet Union !
should not test while we have !
the lead, and that it should not

more and is asking us to allow

work without being allowed to

ition.
I\ THK nuclear race the stakes

race There may have been a mo
ment in 1938 we cannot know
for sure when Mr. Khrushchev
t was strong enough politically to
agree to a treaty with some in
spection which would in fact ac

of Itttit), since the U-2 revealed the
effectiveness of our knowledge
jof Soviet bases, the Soviet gov
ernment has wanted no treaty
: and has devoted itself to prepar
ing to overcome our nuclear lead.
The President’s decision to re
sume testing is intended to pre
vent the Soviet Union from get
ting the lead, and it is based on
the conviction which is also the
Soviets' conviction that there
can lie no security without su

exist, there can be no nuclear
test ban treaty.
THI S THK race goes on, and I
we ask ourselves whether it can
ever be brought to an end. To
answer that question, we must
enter the field of speculation.
If we say that the race will end
when there is nuclear equality
which both sides can accept, then
iit may be that this condition
would exist it both sides invented
and discovered an effective antl
i missile defense. The prevailing
scientific opinion is that this is
improbable if not impossible and
i il would, of course, he a spectacu
lar breakthrough. A workable
equality might also prevail if
each side were able to construct
|an invulnerable retaliatory or
second strike force, one which
would survive any kind of pre
emptive attack.
Il is also conceivable that some
time in the future there will be a
i diplomatic breakthrough which
! would stabilize Germany and the
i whole of Europe to the Urals and
beyond. Nothing like that is now
in sight, but it would be a mis
take to say that il is inconceiv

where a treaty is possible only if

to accept nuclear inferiority for

I\ THK nuclear race the stakes

convinced that they must win the
race There may have been a mo
ment in 1938 we cannot know
for sure when Mr. Khrushchev
t was strong enough politically to
agree to a treaty with some in
spection which would in fact ac
! cept American nuclear superiori
ty. That moment, if it ever ex
isted, passed and since the spring
of Itttit), since the U-2 revealed the
effectiveness of our knowledge
jof Soviet bases, the Soviet gov
ernment has wanted no treaty
: and has devoted itself to prepar
ing to overcome our nuclear lead.
The President’s decision to re
sume testing is intended to pre
vent the Soviet Union from get
ting the lead, and it is based on
the conviction which is also the
Soviets' conviction that there
can lie no security without su
| premacy. While those convictions
exist, there can be no nuclear
test ban treaty.
THI S THK race goes on, and I
we ask ourselves whether it can
ever be brought to an end. To
answer that question, we must
enter the field of speculation.
If we say that the race will end
when there is nuclear equality
which both sides can accept, then
iit may be that this condition
would exist it both sides invented
and discovered an effective antl
i missile defense. The prevailing
scientific opinion is that this is
improbable if not impossible and
i il would, of course, he a spectacu
lar breakthrough. A workable
equality might also prevail if
each side were able to construct
|an invulnerable retaliatory or
second strike force, one which
would survive any kind of pre
emptive attack.
Il is also conceivable that some
time in the future there will be a
i diplomatic breakthrough which
! would stabilize Germany and the
i whole of Europe to the Urals and
beyond. Nothing like that is now
in sight, but it would be a mis
take to say that il is inconceiv
able. We know from history that

Since the middle ’fifties we I
have all supposed, and this in
cluded the Soviets, that the easi
est and simplest of the steps to
wards better relations would be i
a treaty to ban nuclear testing. ;
This is no longer 1 hr* case. On the
contrary, it must now be said
that on a test ban the deadlock is
complete, and without some kind
of scientific or diplomatic break
through file issue is not at pres
ent negotiable.
THIS is a bitter conclusion to
have to come to. But the contro
versy has evolved to the point
where a treaty is possible only if
one side is willing to concede nu
clear superiority to the other and ,
to accept nuclear inferiority for
itself. If the Soviet Union would i
agree to the treaty we are de
manding, it would have to accept :
as permanent, enforced by in
spection. the existing American
superiority in nuclear power. The
Soviet Union would have to give ;
up the attempts to overtake us.
And if we were to accept tile
kind of treaty the Soviet Union
is proposing, we would have to
accept the risk that they could
prepare in secret to overtake us
while we could not prepare to i
keep ahead of them.
The deadlock has developed
over the fact that neither of the
two governments will trust the
other with nuclear superiority;
neither believes it can he secure
unless it has nuclear superiority.
There is no prospect of a treaty
because each side feels compelled
to ask the impossible of the i
ot her.
AS IT is impossible for both
sides to be superior, a treaty I
would be negotiable only if there I
were an equality which both sides ;
believed was real and lasting. We
are a long way from that the-1
metical situation. The nuclear art
is young and new and this (level- I
opment is as yet not only unre-1
alized but not predictable.
At bottom this is why the Sovi
et Union has not only done its
series of tests, but is rejecting
I he very idea of the kind of treaty
that we would like to have. With
out testing, the Soviet Union can
not expect to overtake the United
States, and with testing it might
be able to gain a decisive lead
over the United Stales at least
for a time.
We. for our part, will not ac- i
cept the risk of being overtaken,
