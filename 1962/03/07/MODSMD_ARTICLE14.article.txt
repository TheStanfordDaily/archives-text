Student at Stan
ford is not only "innocuous” but
an outright insult to the intellec
tual and ethical potential of litis
student body; one hopes that the
new Constitution for ASSt', and
its corollary membership in NSA,
will receive from a concerned
student body an approbation in
dicative of its refusal to continue
its aquiescence to a vapid suitus
quo.
The proposed Constitution,
though not without some defects,
embodies the belief that the
terms “education" and “moral
growth” are synonomous with an
awareness and acceptance of re
sponsibility: responsibility with
in and beyond the college situa
tion; responsibility accepted by
each student of this campus to
ward the University its policies,
its methods of teaching and grad
ing, its defective areas in which
students alone can implement
necessary changes and toward
the Nation the events, which,
whether we are aware or no, im
pinge upon our lives.
In these terms of increased re
sponsibility, Stanford’s member
ship in NSA can be seen not as
merely supplementary, but inti
mately related to, the proposed
Constitution. Membership in NSA
would provide a channel through
which students could influence
contemporary events within and
outside of the University,
It could work in this fashion:
LASSU must be urged to fake
the responsibility for mandating
the NSA representatives elected
by the student body the issues

in question will range from aca
dernic freedom to the admission
of Red China into the UN and
to do this, LASSU will, in turn,
have to receive a mandate from
the students. Kach student will
have to take the responsibility
lor learning about and deciding
upon each of these issues.
It may work; it must work, if
Stanford, if the student body, if
student government, are to be
come someday more than the cyn
ical remnants of an ideal.

student body; one hopes that the
new Constitution for ASSt', and
its corollary membership in NSA,
will receive from a concerned
student body an approbation in
dicative of its refusal to continue
its aquiescence to a vapid suitus
quo.
The proposed Constitution,
though not without some defects,
embodies the belief that the
terms “education" and “moral
growth” are synonomous with an
awareness and acceptance of re
sponsibility: responsibility with
in and beyond the college situa
tion; responsibility accepted by
each student of this campus to
ward the University its policies,
its methods of teaching and grad
ing, its defective areas in which
students alone can implement
necessary changes and toward
the Nation the events, which,
whether we are aware or no, im
pinge upon our lives.
In these terms of increased re
sponsibility, Stanford’s member
ship in NSA can be seen not as
merely supplementary, but inti
mately related to, the proposed
Constitution. Membership in NSA
would provide a channel through
which students could influence
contemporary events within and
outside of the University,
It could work in this fashion:
LASSU must be urged to fake
the responsibility for mandating
the NSA representatives elected
by the student body the issues

in question will range from aca
dernic freedom to the admission
of Red China into the UN and
to do this, LASSU will, in turn,
have to receive a mandate from
the students. Kach student will
have to take the responsibility
lor learning about and deciding
upon each of these issues.
It may work; it must work, if
Stanford, if the student body, if
student government, are to be
come someday more than the cyn
ical remnants of an ideal.
