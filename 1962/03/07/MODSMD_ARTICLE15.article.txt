## Basis for 'Spy,' 'Subversive' Charges Cited 
### ILKNE H. ST RE LI TZ Staff Editor 
(editor’s Note: This is the
tlilrd in a series of articles deal
ing with charges of “student
spies” on allegedly “subversive”
professors that have rocked San
Jose State College in the past
seven weeks.)
Conversations with a student
editor, a student who feels he
“might bo accused of auditing in
that way,” and three San Jose
State professors who an “offend
ed student” termed “failures” on
the 10-point subversion list, have
added to the complexity of the
state college academic freedom
controversy.
Supplemented by a statement
of College President John T.
Wahlquist and a copy of the re
port of the investigating sub-com
mittee of the SJS Faculty Coun

cil, some of the past week’s ac
tivity has been put into perspec
tive.

AFTER MORE than a year’s
duration of rumors as to right
wing activity against liberal
statements of professors on the
San Jose campus, controversy
came to a head with a January
15 statement by Professor Ed
ward S. Carmick. Testifying be
fore a legislative interim com
mittee in San Francisco, Car
mick charged that 30 members
of the San Jose State College
faculty and 150 other college and
university teachers in California
had “subversive affiliations.”

The committee was dealing
with Assembly Constitutional
Amendment 38, which forbids
public office or stale employment
to anyone who is a member of
an organization advocating the
forceful overthrow of the gov

ernment.
Last Thursday a sub-committee
of the Faculty Council queried
Carmick on the statements he
had made and the evidence he
had for them. Carmick read to
the Council a statement he had
presented to the San Francisco
Committee:
“I estimate that at least 30 of
our teachers violate their aca
demic freedom continuously by
using the classes to spread their
own convictions such as depre
cating anti-communist efforts, ex
tolling socialism, attacking many
aspects of our free enterprise
economy, ridiculing patriotism,
undermining religion, attacking
national goals and otherwise
weakening our national deter
mination. I doubt if more than
10 made similar efforts on be
half of our country.”

AS TO THE basis for this
statement “The Campus Digest,”
a publication for College faculty
and staff, stated last Friday, “In
commenting on the above state
ment to the sub-committee of the
Faculty Council, Mr. Carmick
said that students who are of
fended by remarks made by pro
fessors in the classroom fre
quently report such cases to him.

The number “30,” he said
was a calculation. He had made
special note of 16 cases, reported
by students, of faculty expres
sions of opinion which in his
judgment were contrary to the
national interest, and there were
other cases that had been report
ed to him of which he had not
taken special note.

And from these statements,
and the controversy surrounding
them, Carol Perkio (editor of the
San Jose student paper. The
Daily Spartan) charged in an
editorial that an organized cam
pus group “of red-hunters” was
recording lectures as evidence of
subversion. At the appearance of
letters from conservative stu
dents, Miss Perkio I’etracted her
statement that an organized cam
pus group was responsible for
the activity. She stated that it
was, instead, the product of in
dividual efforts.
IN A PHONE conversation
Monday night, the “Daily Spar
tan” news editor told The Daily,
“The editorial was in reference
to a group of students, not their
organization, all of whom are
members of the same organiza
tion (“Students Against Commu
nism”) of which Mr. Carmick
just happens to be the sponsor.
“These students use their notes
in efforts to get professors fired,
accuse them of pro-communist
leanings and confront them with
statements they made some time
ago when they make campus
speeches.”
While the news editor stated,
“There was administration and
faculty pressure about the edi
torial,” she said the retraction
was printed only because Miss
Perkio realized “she had made a
mistake by charging this was the
work of an organization.”
IN THE MEANTIME. College
President John T. Wahlquist is
sued a statement on March 2 to
all faculty and staff, prompted by
the editorial. The President
noted:
“The editorial “Of Red-Hunt
ers” . . . disturbed many of us.
.. . After thorough investiga
tion of the sources of rumors up
on which the editorial was based,
I am pleased to report that the
story is not true. No campus or
ganization, and certainly no fac
ulty adviser, was involved in
whatever incidents prompted the
editorial.”
TWO CONTROVERSIAL San
Jose professors, Drs. Hutchison
and Stanton of the Department of
Economics, wore questioned by
this reporter.

Stanton remarked, “Charges of
this sort tend to scare people off.
and we already have a climate
that is not always conducive to

academic freedom.” Stanton felt
there probably were students
taking notes for the charged pur
poses, but he was not concerned
with them.

Said Hutchison, “There are
three or four or five students
who very frequently are outside
the classroom taking notes. I just
close the door.

“I have suspicions about peo
ple from the outside,” said the
professor. “These students are
in constant contact with the same
group of non-student adults.
“Whether this is merely a re
flection of seeing eye-to-eye ide
ologically, or a formal funneling
of information, I don’t know.”
What efficacy do these stu
dents have?

“I am satisfied in my own mind
that the administration keeps
dossiers of these matters. In
terms of promotion, retention
and other crucial matters, they
are taken into consideration.
“THE FACULTY knows this.
It tempers its teaching; it tem
pers its approach; it tempers its
curriculum and the entire aca
demic atmosphere we should
have.

“Some professors move into
other fields under this; others go
to other schools. Some just stay
and take it.”

In addition to student reports,
Carmick had cited as evidence of
his statements a Circuit Riders
publication of 1959: “A Compila
j tion of 6000 Educators.” “The
Campus Digest” notes Mr. Car
mick told the sub-committee of
I the Faculty Council that the
names listed in this book included
people who allegedly belonged to
organizations listed by the At
torney General as subversive and
people whose signatures had ap
peared on “inflammatory” peti
tions.

In light of the charges and its
investigation, the sub-committee
made several recommendations.
While its original report urged
restraint and named Carmick,
citing examples of his activities,
the official report was a revised
edition—the product of confer
ence with the College president
and Carmick.
ACCORDING to Dr. Dean Cre
sap. the revised report contained
the “same emphasis and recom
mendations as the original.”
The committee recommenda
tions 1) recognized “academic
freedom carries with it the con
comitant obligation on the part
of the teacher not to use the class
room as a forum to express per
sonal opinions unrelated to the
purposes of his assigned courses
...” 2) “Subversion” was held
to mean “to destroy or to over
throw the government. Thus to
include in its meaning open criti
cism of the economic system or
of committees of the national
government is to extend the
meaning of the term far beyond
its usual limits.”
Thirdly, the danger of bringing
charges into a subversive activi
ties hearing was held to be “that
the public is led to assume that
the violators involved are ‘sub
versive’ or even ‘communistic.’ ”
The report concluded with the
recommendation to a teacher
speaking or writing as a citizen:
“He should be free from institu
tional censorship or discipline.
However, particularly when he
makes allegations of disloyalty or
subversion, ho should always re
quire of himself the high stand
ards of evidence and verification
consistent with his position as a
member of a learned profession.”

spies” on allegedly “subversive”
professors that have rocked San

seven weeks.)
Conversations with a student
editor, a student who feels he
“might bo accused of auditing in
that way,” and three San Jose
State professors who an “offend
ed student” termed “failures” on
the 10-point subversion list, have
added to the complexity of the
state college academic freedom
controversy.
Supplemented by a statement
of College President John T.
Wahlquist and a copy of the re
port of the investigating sub-com
mittee of the SJS Faculty Coun

cil, some of the past week’s ac
tivity has been put into perspec
tive.

AFTER MORE than a year’s
duration of rumors as to right
wing activity against liberal
statements of professors on the
San Jose campus, controversy
came to a head with a January
15 statement by Professor Ed
ward S. Carmick. Testifying be
fore a legislative interim com
mittee in San Francisco, Car
mick charged that 30 members
of the San Jose State College
faculty and 150 other college and
university teachers in California
had “subversive affiliations.”

The committee was dealing
with Assembly Constitutional
Amendment 38, which forbids
public office or stale employment
to anyone who is a member of
an organization advocating the
forceful overthrow of the gov

ernment.
Last Thursday a sub-committee
of the Faculty Council queried
Carmick on the statements he
had made and the evidence he
had for them. Carmick read to
the Council a statement he had
presented to the San Francisco
Committee:
“I estimate that at least 30 of
our teachers violate their aca
demic freedom continuously by
using the classes to spread their
own convictions such as depre
cating anti-communist efforts, ex
tolling socialism, attacking many
aspects of our free enterprise
economy, ridiculing patriotism,
undermining religion, attacking
national goals and otherwise
weakening our national deter
mination. I doubt if more than
10 made similar efforts on be
half of our country.”

AS TO THE basis for this
statement “The Campus Digest,”
a publication for College faculty
and staff, stated last Friday, “In
commenting on the above state
ment to the sub-committee of the
Faculty Council, Mr. Carmick
said that students who are of
fended by remarks made by pro
fessors in the classroom fre
quently report such cases to him.

The number “30,” he said
was a calculation. He had made
special note of 16 cases, reported
by students, of faculty expres
sions of opinion which in his
judgment were contrary to the
national interest, and there were
other cases that had been report
ed to him of which he had not
taken special note.

And from these statements,
and the controversy surrounding
them, Carol Perkio (editor of the
San Jose student paper. The
Daily Spartan) charged in an
editorial that an organized cam
pus group “of red-hunters” was
recording lectures as evidence of
subversion. At the appearance of
letters from conservative stu
dents, Miss Perkio I’etracted her
statement that an organized cam
pus group was responsible for
the activity. She stated that it
was, instead, the product of in
dividual efforts.
IN A PHONE conversation
Monday night, the “Daily Spar
tan” news editor told The Daily,
“The editorial was in reference
to a group of students, not their
organization, all of whom are
members of the same organiza
tion (“Students Against Commu
nism”) of which Mr. Carmick
just happens to be the sponsor.
“These students use their notes
in efforts to get professors fired,
accuse them of pro-communist
leanings and confront them with
statements they made some time
ago when they make campus
speeches.”
While the news editor stated,
“There was administration and
faculty pressure about the edi
torial,” she said the retraction
was printed only because Miss
Perkio realized “she had made a
mistake by charging this was the
work of an organization.”
IN THE MEANTIME. College
President John T. Wahlquist is
sued a statement on March 2 to
all faculty and staff, prompted by
the editorial. The President
noted:
“The editorial “Of Red-Hunt
ers” . . . disturbed many of us.
.. . After thorough investiga
tion of the sources of rumors up
on which the editorial was based,
I am pleased to report that the
story is not true. No campus or
ganization, and certainly no fac
ulty adviser, was involved in
whatever incidents prompted the
editorial.”
TWO CONTROVERSIAL San
Jose professors, Drs. Hutchison
and Stanton of the Department of
Economics, wore questioned by
this reporter.

Stanton remarked, “Charges of
this sort tend to scare people off.
and we already have a climate
that is not always conducive to

academic freedom.” Stanton felt
there probably were students
taking notes for the charged pur
poses, but he was not concerned
with them.

Said Hutchison, “There are
three or four or five students
who very frequently are outside
the classroom taking notes. I just
close the door.

“I have suspicions about peo
ple from the outside,” said the
professor. “These students are
in constant contact with the same
group of non-student adults.
“Whether this is merely a re
flection of seeing eye-to-eye ide
ologically, or a formal funneling
of information, I don’t know.”
What efficacy do these stu
dents have?

“I am satisfied in my own mind
that the administration keeps
dossiers of these matters. In
terms of promotion, retention
and other crucial matters, they
are taken into consideration.
“THE FACULTY knows this.
It tempers its teaching; it tem
pers its approach; it tempers its
curriculum and the entire aca
demic atmosphere we should
have.

“Some professors move into
other fields under this; others go
to other schools. Some just stay
and take it.”

In addition to student reports,
Carmick had cited as evidence of
his statements a Circuit Riders
publication of 1959: “A Compila
j tion of 6000 Educators.” “The
Campus Digest” notes Mr. Car
mick told the sub-committee of
I the Faculty Council that the
names listed in this book included
people who allegedly belonged to
organizations listed by the At
torney General as subversive and
people whose signatures had ap
peared on “inflammatory” peti
tions.

In light of the charges and its
investigation, the sub-committee
made several recommendations.
While its original report urged
restraint and named Carmick,
citing examples of his activities,
the official report was a revised
edition—the product of confer

“I am satisfied in my own mind

“Some professors move into

In addition to student reports,
Carmick had cited as evidence of
his statements a Circuit Riders
publication of 1959: “A Compila

Campus Digest” notes Mr. Car

I the Faculty Council that the
names listed in this book included
people who allegedly belonged to
organizations listed by the At
torney General as subversive and
people whose signatures had ap
peared on “inflammatory” peti

In light of the charges and its
investigation, the sub-committee
made several recommendations.
While its original report urged
restraint and named Carmick,
citing examples of his activities,
the official report was a revised
edition—the product of confer

and Carmick.
ACCORDING to Dr. Dean Cre
sap. the revised report contained
the “same emphasis and recom
mendations as the original.”
The committee recommenda
tions 1) recognized “academic
freedom carries with it the con
comitant obligation on the part
of the teacher not to use the class
room as a forum to express per
sonal opinions unrelated to the
purposes of his assigned courses
...” 2) “Subversion” was held
to mean “to destroy or to over
throw the government. Thus to
include in its meaning open criti
cism of the economic system or
of committees of the national
government is to extend the
meaning of the term far beyond
its usual limits.”
Thirdly, the danger of bringing
charges into a subversive activi
ties hearing was held to be “that
the public is led to assume that
the violators involved are ‘sub
versive’ or even ‘communistic.’ ”
The report concluded with the
recommendation to a teacher
speaking or writing as a citizen:
“He should be free from institu
tional censorship or discipline.
However, particularly when he
makes allegations of disloyalty or
subversion, ho should always re
quire of himself the high stand
ards of evidence and verification
consistent with his position as a
member of a learned profession.”

(editor’s Note: This is the
tlilrd in a series of articles deal

spies” on allegedly “subversive”
professors that have rocked San
Jose State College in the past
seven weeks.)
Conversations with a student
editor, a student who feels he
“might bo accused of auditing in
that way,” and three San Jose
State professors who an “offend
ed student” termed “failures” on
the 10-point subversion list, have
added to the complexity of the
state college academic freedom
controversy.
Supplemented by a statement
of College President John T.
Wahlquist and a copy of the re
port of the investigating sub-com
mittee of the SJS Faculty Coun

cil, some of the past week’s ac
tivity has been put into perspec
tive.

AFTER MORE than a year’s
duration of rumors as to right
wing activity against liberal
statements of professors on the
San Jose campus, controversy
came to a head with a January
15 statement by Professor Ed
ward S. Carmick. Testifying be
fore a legislative interim com
mittee in San Francisco, Car
mick charged that 30 members
of the San Jose State College
faculty and 150 other college and
university teachers in California
had “subversive affiliations.”

The committee was dealing
with Assembly Constitutional
Amendment 38, which forbids
public office or stale employment
to anyone who is a member of
an organization advocating the
forceful overthrow of the gov

ernment.
Last Thursday a sub-committee
of the Faculty Council queried
Carmick on the statements he
had made and the evidence he
had for them. Carmick read to
the Council a statement he had
presented to the San Francisco
Committee:
“I estimate that at least 30 of
our teachers violate their aca
demic freedom continuously by
using the classes to spread their
own convictions such as depre
cating anti-communist efforts, ex
tolling socialism, attacking many
aspects of our free enterprise
economy, ridiculing patriotism,
undermining religion, attacking
national goals and otherwise
weakening our national deter
mination. I doubt if more than
10 made similar efforts on be
half of our country.”

AS TO THE basis for this
statement “The Campus Digest,”
a publication for College faculty
and staff, stated last Friday, “In
commenting on the above state
ment to the sub-committee of the
Faculty Council, Mr. Carmick
said that students who are of
fended by remarks made by pro
fessors in the classroom fre
quently report such cases to him.

The number “30,” he said
was a calculation. He had made
special note of 16 cases, reported
by students, of faculty expres
sions of opinion which in his
judgment were contrary to the
national interest, and there were
other cases that had been report
ed to him of which he had not
taken special note.

And from these statements,
and the controversy surrounding
them, Carol Perkio (editor of the
San Jose student paper. The
Daily Spartan) charged in an
editorial that an organized cam
pus group “of red-hunters” was
recording lectures as evidence of
subversion. At the appearance of
letters from conservative stu
dents, Miss Perkio I’etracted her
statement that an organized cam
pus group was responsible for
the activity. She stated that it
was, instead, the product of in
dividual efforts.
IN A PHONE conversation
Monday night, the “Daily Spar
tan” news editor told The Daily,
“The editorial was in reference
to a group of students, not their
organization, all of whom are
members of the same organiza
tion (“Students Against Commu
nism”) of which Mr. Carmick
just happens to be the sponsor.
“These students use their notes
in efforts to get professors fired,
accuse them of pro-communist
leanings and confront them with
statements they made some time
ago when they make campus
speeches.”
While the news editor stated,
“There was administration and
faculty pressure about the edi
torial,” she said the retraction
was printed only because Miss
Perkio realized “she had made a
mistake by charging this was the
work of an organization.”
IN THE MEANTIME. College
President John T. Wahlquist is
sued a statement on March 2 to
all faculty and staff, prompted by
the editorial. The President
noted:
“The editorial “Of Red-Hunt
ers” . . . disturbed many of us.
.. . After thorough investiga
tion of the sources of rumors up
on which the editorial was based,
I am pleased to report that the
story is not true. No campus or
ganization, and certainly no fac
ulty adviser, was involved in
whatever incidents prompted the
editorial.”
TWO CONTROVERSIAL San
Jose professors, Drs. Hutchison
and Stanton of the Department of
Economics, wore questioned by
this reporter.

Stanton remarked, “Charges of
this sort tend to scare people off.
and we already have a climate
that is not always conducive to

academic freedom.” Stanton felt
there probably were students
taking notes for the charged pur
poses, but he was not concerned
with them.

Said Hutchison, “There are
three or four or five students
who very frequently are outside
the classroom taking notes. I just
close the door.

“I have suspicions about peo
ple from the outside,” said the
professor. “These students are
in constant contact with the same
group of non-student adults.
“Whether this is merely a re
flection of seeing eye-to-eye ide
ologically, or a formal funneling
of information, I don’t know.”
What efficacy do these stu

“I am satisfied in my own mind

IN THE MEANTIME. College
President John T. Wahlquist is
sued a statement on March 2 to
all faculty and staff, prompted by
the editorial. The President
noted:
“The editorial “Of Red-Hunt
ers” . . . disturbed many of us.
.. . After thorough investiga
tion of the sources of rumors up
on which the editorial was based,
I am pleased to report that the
story is not true. No campus or
ganization, and certainly no fac
ulty adviser, was involved in
whatever incidents prompted the
editorial.”
TWO CONTROVERSIAL San
Jose professors, Drs. Hutchison
and Stanton of the Department of
Economics, wore questioned by
this reporter.

Stanton remarked, “Charges of
this sort tend to scare people off.
and we already have a climate
that is not always conducive to

academic freedom.” Stanton felt
there probably were students
taking notes for the charged pur
poses, but he was not concerned
with them.

Said Hutchison, “There are
three or four or five students
who very frequently are outside
the classroom taking notes. I just
close the door.

“I have suspicions about peo
ple from the outside,” said the
professor. “These students are
in constant contact with the same
group of non-student adults.
“Whether this is merely a re
flection of seeing eye-to-eye ide
ologically, or a formal funneling
of information, I don’t know.”
What efficacy do these stu
dents have?

“I am satisfied in my own mind
that the administration keeps
dossiers of these matters. In
terms of promotion, retention
and other crucial matters, they
are taken into consideration.
“THE FACULTY knows this.
It tempers its teaching; it tem
pers its approach; it tempers its
curriculum and the entire aca
demic atmosphere we should
have.

“Some professors move into
other fields under this; others go
to other schools. Some just stay
and take it.”

In addition to student reports,
Carmick had cited as evidence of
his statements a Circuit Riders
publication of 1959: “A Compila
j tion of 6000 Educators.” “The
Campus Digest” notes Mr. Car
mick told the sub-committee of
I the Faculty Council that the
names listed in this book included
people who allegedly belonged to
organizations listed by the At
torney General as subversive and
people whose signatures had ap
peared on “inflammatory” peti
tions.

In light of the charges and its
investigation, the sub-committee
made several recommendations.
While its original report urged
restraint and named Carmick,
citing examples of his activities,
the official report was a revised
edition—the product of confer
ence with the College president
and Carmick.
ACCORDING to Dr. Dean Cre
sap. the revised report contained
the “same emphasis and recom
mendations as the original.”
The committee recommenda
tions 1) recognized “academic
freedom carries with it the con
comitant obligation on the part
of the teacher not to use the class
room as a forum to express per
sonal opinions unrelated to the
purposes of his assigned courses
...” 2) “Subversion” was held
to mean “to destroy or to over
throw the government. Thus to
include in its meaning open criti
cism of the economic system or
of committees of the national
government is to extend the
meaning of the term far beyond
its usual limits.”
Thirdly, the danger of bringing
charges into a subversive activi
ties hearing was held to be “that
the public is led to assume that
the violators involved are ‘sub
versive’ or even ‘communistic.’ ”
The report concluded with the
recommendation to a teacher
speaking or writing as a citizen:
“He should be free from institu
tional censorship or discipline.
However, particularly when he
makes allegations of disloyalty or
subversion, ho should always re
quire of himself the high stand
ards of evidence and verification
consistent with his position as a
member of a learned profession.”

tlilrd in a series of articles deal

spies” on allegedly “subversive”
professors that have rocked San
Jose State College in the past
seven weeks.)
Conversations with a student
editor, a student who feels he
“might bo accused of auditing in
that way,” and three San Jose
State professors who an “offend
ed student” termed “failures” on
the 10-point subversion list, have
added to the complexity of the
state college academic freedom
controversy.
Supplemented by a statement
of College President John T.
Wahlquist and a copy of the re
port of the investigating sub-com

cil, some of the past week’s ac
tivity has been put into perspec

AFTER MORE than a year’s
duration of rumors as to right
wing activity against liberal
statements of professors on the
San Jose campus, controversy
came to a head with a January
15 statement by Professor Ed
ward S. Carmick. Testifying be
fore a legislative interim com
mittee in San Francisco, Car
mick charged that 30 members
of the San Jose State College
faculty and 150 other college and
university teachers in California
had “subversive affiliations.”

The committee was dealing
with Assembly Constitutional
Amendment 38, which forbids
public office or stale employment
to anyone who is a member of
an organization advocating the
forceful overthrow of the gov

ernment.
Last Thursday a sub-committee
of the Faculty Council queried
Carmick on the statements he
had made and the evidence he
had for them. Carmick read to
the Council a statement he had
presented to the San Francisco
Committee:
“I estimate that at least 30 of
our teachers violate their aca
demic freedom continuously by
using the classes to spread their
own convictions such as depre
cating anti-communist efforts, ex
tolling socialism, attacking many
aspects of our free enterprise
economy, ridiculing patriotism,
undermining religion, attacking
national goals and otherwise
weakening our national deter
mination. I doubt if more than
10 made similar efforts on be
half of our country.”

AS TO THE basis for this
statement “The Campus Digest,”
a publication for College faculty
and staff, stated last Friday, “In
commenting on the above state
ment to the sub-committee of the
Faculty Council, Mr. Carmick
said that students who are of
fended by remarks made by pro
fessors in the classroom fre
quently report such cases to him.

The number “30,” he said
was a calculation. He had made
special note of 16 cases, reported
by students, of faculty expres
sions of opinion which in his
judgment were contrary to the
national interest, and there were
other cases that had been report
ed to him of which he had not
taken special note.

And from these statements,
and the controversy surrounding
them, Carol Perkio (editor of the
San Jose student paper. The
Daily Spartan) charged in an
editorial that an organized cam
pus group “of red-hunters” was
recording lectures as evidence of
subversion. At the appearance of
letters from conservative stu
dents, Miss Perkio I’etracted her
statement that an organized cam
pus group was responsible for
the activity. She stated that it
was, instead, the product of in
dividual efforts.
IN A PHONE conversation
Monday night, the “Daily Spar
tan” news editor told The Daily,
“The editorial was in reference
to a group of students, not their
organization, all of whom are
members of the same organiza
tion (“Students Against Commu
nism”) of which Mr. Carmick
just happens to be the sponsor.
“These students use their notes
in efforts to get professors fired,
accuse them of pro-communist
leanings and confront them with
statements they made some time
ago when they make campus
speeches.”
While the news editor stated,
“There was administration and
faculty pressure about the edi
torial,” she said the retraction
was printed only because Miss
Perkio realized “she had made a
mistake by charging this was the
work of an organization.”

taken special note.

And from these statements,
and the controversy surrounding
them, Carol Perkio (editor of the
San Jose student paper. The
Daily Spartan) charged in an
editorial that an organized cam
pus group “of red-hunters” was
recording lectures as evidence of
subversion. At the appearance of
letters from conservative stu
dents, Miss Perkio I’etracted her
statement that an organized cam
pus group was responsible for
the activity. She stated that it
was, instead, the product of in
dividual efforts.
IN A PHONE conversation
Monday night, the “Daily Spar
tan” news editor told The Daily,
“The editorial was in reference
to a group of students, not their
organization, all of whom are
members of the same organiza
tion (“Students Against Commu
nism”) of which Mr. Carmick
just happens to be the sponsor.
“These students use their notes
in efforts to get professors fired,
accuse them of pro-communist
leanings and confront them with
statements they made some time
ago when they make campus
speeches.”
While the news editor stated,
“There was administration and
faculty pressure about the edi
torial,” she said the retraction
was printed only because Miss
Perkio realized “she had made a
mistake by charging this was the
work of an organization.”
IN THE MEANTIME. College
President John T. Wahlquist is
sued a statement on March 2 to
all faculty and staff, prompted by
the editorial. The President
noted:
“The editorial “Of Red-Hunt
ers” . . . disturbed many of us.
.. . After thorough investiga
tion of the sources of rumors up
on which the editorial was based,
I am pleased to report that the
story is not true. No campus or
ganization, and certainly no fac
ulty adviser, was involved in
whatever incidents prompted the
editorial.”
TWO CONTROVERSIAL San
Jose professors, Drs. Hutchison
and Stanton of the Department of
Economics, wore questioned by
this reporter.

Stanton remarked, “Charges of
this sort tend to scare people off.
and we already have a climate
that is not always conducive to

academic freedom.” Stanton felt
there probably were students
taking notes for the charged pur
poses, but he was not concerned
with them.

Said Hutchison, “There are
three or four or five students
who very frequently are outside
the classroom taking notes. I just
close the door.

“I have suspicions about peo
ple from the outside,” said the
professor. “These students are
in constant contact with the same
group of non-student adults.
“Whether this is merely a re
flection of seeing eye-to-eye ide
ologically, or a formal funneling
of information, I don’t know.”
What efficacy do these stu
dents have?

“I am satisfied in my own mind
that the administration keeps
dossiers of these matters. In
terms of promotion, retention
and other crucial matters, they
are taken into consideration.
“THE FACULTY knows this.
It tempers its teaching; it tem
pers its approach; it tempers its
curriculum and the entire aca
demic atmosphere we should
have.

“Some professors move into
other fields under this; others go
to other schools. Some just stay
and take it.”

In addition to student reports,
Carmick had cited as evidence of
his statements a Circuit Riders
publication of 1959: “A Compila
j tion of 6000 Educators.” “The
Campus Digest” notes Mr. Car
mick told the sub-committee of
I the Faculty Council that the
names listed in this book included
people who allegedly belonged to
organizations listed by the At
torney General as subversive and
people whose signatures had ap
peared on “inflammatory” peti
tions.

In light of the charges and its
investigation, the sub-committee
made several recommendations.
While its original report urged
restraint and named Carmick,
citing examples of his activities,
the official report was a revised
edition—the product of confer
ence with the College president
and Carmick.
ACCORDING to Dr. Dean Cre
sap. the revised report contained
the “same emphasis and recom
mendations as the original.”
The committee recommenda
tions 1) recognized “academic
freedom carries with it the con
comitant obligation on the part
of the teacher not to use the class
room as a forum to express per
sonal opinions unrelated to the
purposes of his assigned courses
...” 2) “Subversion” was held
to mean “to destroy or to over
throw the government. Thus to
include in its meaning open criti
cism of the economic system or
of committees of the national
government is to extend the
meaning of the term far beyond
its usual limits.”
Thirdly, the danger of bringing
charges into a subversive activi
ties hearing was held to be “that
the public is led to assume that
the violators involved are ‘sub
versive’ or even ‘communistic.’ ”
The report concluded with the
recommendation to a teacher
speaking or writing as a citizen:
“He should be free from institu
tional censorship or discipline.
However, particularly when he
makes allegations of disloyalty or
subversion, ho should always re
quire of himself the high stand
ards of evidence and verification
consistent with his position as a
member of a learned profession.”

(editor’s Note: This is the
tlilrd in a series of articles deal
ing with charges of “student
spies” on allegedly “subversive”
professors that have rocked San
Jose State College in the past
seven weeks.)
Conversations with a student
editor, a student who feels he
“might bo accused of auditing in
that way,” and three San Jose
State professors who an “offend
ed student” termed “failures” on
the 10-point subversion list, have
added to the complexity of the
state college academic freedom
controversy.
Supplemented by a statement
of College President John T.
Wahlquist and a copy of the re
port of the investigating sub-com
mittee of the SJS Faculty Coun

cil, some of the past week’s ac
tivity has been put into perspec
tive.

AFTER MORE than a year’s
duration of rumors as to right
wing activity against liberal
statements of professors on the
San Jose campus, controversy
came to a head with a January
15 statement by Professor Ed
ward S. Carmick. Testifying be
fore a legislative interim com
mittee in San Francisco, Car
mick charged that 30 members
of the San Jose State College
faculty and 150 other college and
university teachers in California
had “subversive affiliations.”

The committee was dealing
with Assembly Constitutional
Amendment 38, which forbids
public office or stale employment
to anyone who is a member of
an organization advocating the
forceful overthrow of the gov

ernment.
Last Thursday a sub-committee
of the Faculty Council queried
Carmick on the statements he
had made and the evidence he
had for them. Carmick read to
the Council a statement he had
presented to the San Francisco
Committee:
“I estimate that at least 30 of
our teachers violate their aca
demic freedom continuously by
using the classes to spread their
own convictions such as depre
cating anti-communist efforts, ex
tolling socialism, attacking many
aspects of our free enterprise
economy, ridiculing patriotism,
undermining religion, attacking
national goals and otherwise
weakening our national deter
mination. I doubt if more than
10 made similar efforts on be
half of our country.”

AS TO THE basis for this
statement “The Campus Digest,”
a publication for College faculty
and staff, stated last Friday, “In
commenting on the above state
ment to the sub-committee of the
Faculty Council, Mr. Carmick
said that students who are of
fended by remarks made by pro
fessors in the classroom fre
quently report such cases to him.

The number “30,” he said
was a calculation. He had made
special note of 16 cases, reported
by students, of faculty expres
sions of opinion which in his
judgment were contrary to the
national interest, and there were
other cases that had been report
ed to him of which he had not
taken special note.

And from these statements,
and the controversy surrounding
them, Carol Perkio (editor of the
San Jose student paper. The
Daily Spartan) charged in an
editorial that an organized cam
pus group “of red-hunters” was
recording lectures as evidence of
subversion. At the appearance of
letters from conservative stu
dents, Miss Perkio I’etracted her
statement that an organized cam

the activity. She stated that it
