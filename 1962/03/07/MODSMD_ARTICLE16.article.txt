EXPEDIENCY
Editor, Tile Daily:
The reason that Mr. Nixon re
fuses, as you editorially put it,
“to compromise with the extreme
right” is that he also refuses to
compromise with inexpediency.
If you carefully look at Nixon’s
public statements on this ques
tion, you will see that at no time
does he question the fundamental
principles underlying the Birch
/society. He rather directs his
charges to the most extreme dec
larations of the society’s founder;
one of these, if you recall, is that
Nixon’s immediate superior in
the last administration (namely,
Eisenhower) served as a consci
ous agent of the communist con
spiracy.
As a matter of pure expedi
ency, do you really believe Nixon
has a choice? Nixon, the great
"character assassinator” of the
past, has, if you will notice,
screamed “character assassina
tion” only after those of his own
“conservative” persuasion have
become subjected to the same
kind of attacks that he himself
has been so instrumental in per
petuating.
Only when (or if) Nixon re
pudiates the basic philosophy of
those rightists which is that every
step taken in the direction of so
cial betterment through govern
mental action is a step toward
communism—will it be correct
to say that a “new Nixon” has
emerged.
It is clear you are leaning over
backward to bring into your lib
eral pale men of the stripe of
Nixon; you should be sure, how
ever, that these are reciprocating
in principle as well as in outer
appearance to your expressed de
sires.

(Editor’s Note: The possibility
that political expedience dictated
Nixon’s Birch Society stand has
not escaped us. In fact, that was
our major reason for merely
“hoping” a new Nixon lias
emerged rather than welcoming
him “into our liberal pale.” The
fact remains, however, that, for
whatever reasons, Nixon’s stand
was a strong one and it will, we
think, hurt the radical right in
California greatly.)
MISGUIDED
Editor, The Daily:
Last year, at about this time,
The Daily printed a stupid edi
torial written as I recall by May
nard Parker on the subject of
Founder’s Day. Steve Zousmer’s
article failed to present another
side of the story; rather it re
peated the some vein of sopho
moric ridicule which the univer
sity community found so objec
tionable last year.
Founder’s Day stresses the tra
ditional aspect of Stanford as an
institution founded and nourish
ed in its growth by the dedication
of many worthy people, some of
whom, though aged, are still
around today in attendance at
these ceremonies.
I wish to separate myself from
that “expression of student opin
ion” which is based on a preoccu
pation with the re-use of last
years’ wreath and fails to note
the number and quality of those
fine people. I contend that at

tendance at Founder's Day serv-1
ices would be high without "con-!:
nivance” on the part of the acl- i;
ministration.
There are a good number of
students who prefer to respect
age and a worthy heritage, if not |
revere it. Certainly, only a mis |
guided few choose to ridicule it. I

DISAPPROBATION
Editor, The Daily;
We have noted with great sat
isfaction, though considerable |
surprise, that a portion of the]
student body at San Jose State I
has acquired the hahit of taking :
notes on lectures given hy pro i
lessors at said institution. Start |
ling as this practice may be, it is I
not without merit.
Wo note with some disapproba
tion that the faculty council at
State does not condone the stu
dents’ taking of notes in their
classes. We had rather assumed
that this procedure was widely
acclaimed by most professors,

but admit that the vagaries of
some faculty councils are incom
prehensible,
