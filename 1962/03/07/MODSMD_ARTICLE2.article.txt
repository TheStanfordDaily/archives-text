# Banjo Picker Seeger At Mem Aud Tonight
## 
### 
Pctc Seeger, rated In many as America’s No. I folk singer,
will sing at Memorial Auditorium tonight at 8:15.
I,caving Harvard in 1938 to look for a job as a journalist,
Seeger came into contact with such balladeers as Burl Ives,
Woodies Guthrie, and Josh White, and took up folk singing

instead. Until the war began he"
travelled and learned music in
eastern Kentucky and Tennessee.
He served with the Army Spe
cial Services in the South Pacific,
organizing hospital recreation
"jazz, hill-billy music, whatever
it is soldiers sing.” After the war
he did solo work for a while, then
helped form the Weavers, a group
which has been instrumental in
introducing America to folk mu
sic; in the early 50’s they made
the hit parade with “On Top of
Old Smoky” and “Goodnight,
Irene” -songs which had formerly
been sung only by folk artists.
PETE eventually left the Weav
ers to sing on his own. In 1955 he
was called before the House Un-
American Activities Committee as
pai l of its alleged “investigations
of subversive activities in the
entertainment industry.”
Being questioned on the content
of his songs as well as on his per
sonal political beliefs and associa
tions, he refused to answer ten of
the Committee’s questions on the
grounds of his basic right of free
speech and free association. Cited
for contempt of Congress, he was
tried in Federal court and sen
tenced to a year in prison for each
of the ten questions.
He WAS FREED on hail to con
tinue his concert tours; his appeal
will be heard this month. Since
the first trial hundreds of letters
of support have poured in to Pete
from all over the world, bringing
the legal costs. In the meantime
thousands of dollars to help pay
he has continued to sing to capac
ity crowds at colleges and univer
sities across the nation.
Pete sees the present nation
wide interest in folk singing as an
important cultural tread; "that of
wanting to do something more
creative with your time.”

Sings Folk Songs Tonight
Pctc Seeger, rated In many as America’s No. I folk singer,
will sing at Memorial Auditorium tonight at 8:15.
I,caving Harvard in 1938 to look for a job as a journalist,
Seeger came into contact with such balladeers as Burl Ives,
Woodies Guthrie, and Josh White, and took up folk singing

instead. Until the war began he"
travelled and learned music in
eastern Kentucky and Tennessee.
He served with the Army Spe
cial Services in the South Pacific,
organizing hospital recreation
"jazz, hill-billy music, whatever
it is soldiers sing.” After the war
he did solo work for a while, then
helped form the Weavers, a group
which has been instrumental in
introducing America to folk mu
sic; in the early 50’s they made
the hit parade with “On Top of
Old Smoky” and “Goodnight,
Irene” -songs which had formerly
been sung only by folk artists.
PETE eventually left the Weav
ers to sing on his own. In 1955 he
was called before the House Un-
American Activities Committee as
pai l of its alleged “investigations
of subversive activities in the
entertainment industry.”
Being questioned on the content
of his songs as well as on his per
sonal political beliefs and associa
tions, he refused to answer ten of
the Committee’s questions on the
grounds of his basic right of free
speech and free association. Cited
for contempt of Congress, he was
tried in Federal court and sen
tenced to a year in prison for each
of the ten questions.
