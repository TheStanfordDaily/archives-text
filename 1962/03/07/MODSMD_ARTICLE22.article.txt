## 
### 
Prof. Joseph Katz of Stanford
Institute for the Study of Human
! Problems yesterday scored pres
ent teaching of “introductory”
phychology courses and suggest
ed wide application of psychologi
j cal methods in both college life
and learning.
He spoke at the 17th National
Conference on Higher Education
meeting (March 4-7) in Chicago
j during a discussion of “New Per
spectives on Teaching the Disci
plines.” His subject was “Psy
chology in the Undergraduate
Curriculum.”
Emphasizing that his remarks
applied only to “students who are
not going on to major in psychol
j ogy and are likely to take only

one course in Iho field,” he said
the problems nevertheless are
common to introductory courses
in other fields as well.

“MOST OF the students who
elect an introductory course in
psychology come to it with the
desire to find out both about
their own selves and those of
other people.” said Prof. Katz.
“Much of the disappointment and
criticism that undergraduates
often express about their psy
chology courses seems due to
their disappointment at not get
ting out of these courses what
they had come for.
“On the whole, teachers tend
to disregard students’ altitudes
and rest content with some sort
of conceptual grasp of the sub
ject matter. The result, of course,
often is that what is actually
taught is either superficial or is
efficiently removed from psycho
logical reality.
“The particular genius or psy
chology in the twentieth century
has been not only its opening up
of many realms of the human
psyche to a fuller understanding,
but also its providing methods
for the education of impulse,
feeling, and attitudes.
