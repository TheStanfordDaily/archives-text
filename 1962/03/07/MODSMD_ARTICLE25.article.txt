# Powers Tells of Flight Over USSR
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Fran
cis Gary Powers appeared in a
public Senate hearing yesterday
to tell about his ill-starred U2
flight over Russia in May of 1960.
When Powers began speaking,
he plunged immediately into the
tale of his flight, beginning with
his takeoff at 5:30 a.m., following
a last-minute briefing which in
cluded instructions on what to do
for a “forced landing over enemy
territory."
HE DESCRIBED how his
glider-winged U2 soared high in
to Russian territory. He told of
seeing a Russian jet aircraft far
below him, and how he felt “fair
ly good” that they apparently had
not seen him.
Then he told what happened
that fateful moment at 68,000
feet as he approached the Soviet
city of Sverdlovsk.
Near the city, he said, he made
a prescribed turn to the left of
90 degrees, “rolled out on course,”
and lined up on his next objec
tive which was to go over the
southwest edge of tho city.
HE REMEMBERED seeking an
airfield which was “not on my
map.”
Then, while checking his in
struments, he “heard, felt and
sensed” an explosion and “just a
slight acceleration of the air
craft.” He was then at 68,000 feet
—or nearly 13 miles above the
earth.
“Everywhere I looked it was
orange,” he said.

The CIA and other experts
think the explosion was a Rus
sian surface-to-air missile. They
believe it did not actually hit the
plane, but did come close enough
to disable it. He felt no reaction
to his controls and said he
thought the tail section had come
off.
I‘OYERS TOED the senators
that as ho floated to a landing
on Russian soil, “I had a lot of
thoughts.”
On his person was a poison pin,
which the CIA had supplied him
in case it was necessary to use
it to avoid torture.
While coming down, Powers
said, he debated whether or not
to use the pin. He took it from
his container and put it loose in
his pocket.
He landed in an open field

, about 25 feet from a tractor. One
1 man was on the tractor, and
another was standing nearby.
They rushed over to him, helped
collapse his parachute, and as
sisted him to his feet.
At this point Powers discovered
another of the mysteries of his
mission. One of the men held up
two fingers, as if to ask if any
one else was on the plane. Pow
ers shook his head no, then
glanced towards the sky and saw
what appeared to he another
parachute drifting towards the
ground. He said he still does not
know what this was.
THE PILOT’S captors took him
to Sverdlovsk for questioning. At
first, he said, he “tried to invent
a story,” saying his plane got
lost and he didn’t know where he
was.
