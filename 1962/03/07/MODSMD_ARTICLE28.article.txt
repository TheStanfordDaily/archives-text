What dot's the Stanford basketball team have to do to get space
in the “San Francisco Chronicle”?
Saturday, Stanford defeated USC by a single point in one of the
most exciting games of this or any other year, but what did the
Chronicle say about it?
A .MMASMMV SIX INCH MS of space on page four. This is even
worse than usual. Before, we were at least on page three.
I realize that the newspaper business calls for stories to he in
by deadline, and the basketball stories must be rushed through
ehannnels rapidly so as to get them in the paper. The space for the
stories must he reserved ahead of time, so the finished material
can be dropped into place and the type rushed to (he composing
room so the page can he printed.
So why does the Chronicle reserve us such a small space?
IT’S HARD TO figure. Rill Leiser, Chronicle Sports Editor, is
a Stanford graduate. Dick Friendlich, one of the better sports writers
on the Coast, went to Stanford, so Stanford sentiment in the “Sport
ing Green” should get Stanford basketball some publicity.
But it doesn’t. My memory may be faulty, but the only satisfying
Stanford basketball publicity in the Chronicle this year was on the
occasion of Stanford’s victories over Cal.
And even the story about the Pepperdine-St. Mary's basketball
game last weekend eclipsed that. Granted it was the occasion of the
clinching of the WCAC title, but is the WCAC more important than
the AAWU?
TAKING THIS ONE STEP further, the story of the clinching
of the AAWU title was virtually non-existent. UCLA beat Washing
ton on the Huskies’ home court, a superhuman feat, and the Chroni
cle busies a three-inch story on the back pages.
Clearly the AAWU is a better league than the WCAC. Stanford,
a solid choice for second in the Big Five, defeated St. Mary’s, second
in Ihe WCAC, handily, running up a hig lead before putting in the
reserves. USF was an easy victim.
And to cap it off, Stanford edged Santa Clara despite shooting
a mere 20 per cent.
A STANMOKD-I’MI’PMRDINM game would be a dandy, and my
money would back Stanford.
So the calibre of play in the two leagues can't be the reason why
Stanford is given the hack seat. Maybe when Stanford wins an
AAWU title, say in football or basketball next year, the Indians will
get the publicity they deserve.

ing Green” should get Stanford basketball some publicity.
But it doesn’t. My memory may be faulty, but the only satisfying
Stanford basketball publicity in the Chronicle this year was on the
occasion of Stanford’s victories over Cal.
And even the story about the Pepperdine-St. Mary's basketball
game last weekend eclipsed that. Granted it was the occasion of the
clinching of the WCAC title, but is the WCAC more important than
the AAWU?
TAKING THIS ONE STEP further, the story of the clinching
of the AAWU title was virtually non-existent. UCLA beat Washing
ton on the Huskies’ home court, a superhuman feat, and the Chroni
cle busies a three-inch story on the back pages.
Clearly the AAWU is a better league than the WCAC. Stanford,
a solid choice for second in the Big Five, defeated St. Mary’s, second
in Ihe WCAC, handily, running up a hig lead before putting in the
reserves. USF was an easy victim.
And to cap it off, Stanford edged Santa Clara despite shooting
a mere 20 per cent.
A STANMOKD-I’MI’PMRDINM game would be a dandy, and my
money would back Stanford.
So the calibre of play in the two leagues can't be the reason why
Stanford is given the hack seat. Maybe when Stanford wins an
AAWU title, say in football or basketball next year, the Indians will
get the publicity they deserve.
What dot's the Stanford basketball team have to do to get space
in the “San Francisco Chronicle”?
Saturday, Stanford defeated USC by a single point in one of the
most exciting games of this or any other year, but what did the
Chronicle say about it?
A .MMASMMV SIX INCH MS of space on page four. This is even
worse than usual. Before, we were at least on page three.
I realize that the newspaper business calls for stories to he in
by deadline, and the basketball stories must be rushed through
ehannnels rapidly so as to get them in the paper. The space for the
stories must he reserved ahead of time, so the finished material
can be dropped into place and the type rushed to (he composing
room so the page can he printed.
So why does the Chronicle reserve us such a small space?
IT’S HARD TO figure. Rill Leiser, Chronicle Sports Editor, is
a Stanford graduate. Dick Friendlich, one of the better sports writers
on the Coast, went to Stanford, so Stanford sentiment in the “Sport
ing Green” should get Stanford basketball some publicity.
