# Devil Helps Novelists; Guerard
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
Andie Gide once said, “There is
no true work of art without a
compact with ihe devil."
Distinguished Stanford alum
nus, noted novelist, scholar, and
Professor of English Alberl J.
Guerard used this as the theme
for his Tuesday Evening Series
address last night, “The Novelist’s
Compact with the Devil.”
“The devil’s share of uncon
scious creation is the basis of a
novel. Even the most rational
novelists have had to draw them
selves up and say. ‘who wrote
that? Not I’ ” noted Guerard.
One of the first signs of crea
tion, according to the Stanford
professor, is to “write what you
didn’t intend to write, to dream
what you didn’t intend to dream.”
“Diabolical collaboration" is
evidenced by the presence of the
novelist’s “timid conscious mind”
counterposed by his “teeming, pol
lenous unconscious mind.”
With wit and depth, Guerard
cited the dichotomy of the lives
and works of authors. “A seclud
ed spinster,” Emily Bronte, pro
duced in “Wuthering Heights”
“one of the most passionate nov
els” ever written.
Meek Nathaniel Hawthorne
“dreamed more darkly” than most
men ever do. Few novelists, said
Guerard in reference to the excep
tion of Henry Miller, “live the
lives they write, or write the hor
rible lives they live.”
Guerard saw the devil-novelist
compact emerging by virtue of
their roles. The devil is the one
who denies, the “destroyer.” The
novelist is the “destroyer of the
establishment;” he tries to “de
molish the existing structure.”
Guerard noted that the novelist
may assume his compact uncon

sciously, or, as did the psycholog
ical novelists, ‘‘quite consciously
play the devil’s game.” After the
advent of Freud and Einstein, the
“French anti-novelists and the
American anti-realists” were “in
tent to destroy ego and earth.”
“I regard the devil ... as dan
gerous and useful, “noted Guer
ard. “I am compelled to admire
the devil . . . eternal critic of the
secure status quo.
At one point, I think the devil’s
work is subtley beneficent, able to
create sympathy,” at qnexpected
points. A sudden change in sym
pathy is “one of the true signs of
great novelists.”
After stating “the conditions of
real life and fictional life are not
the same,” Guerard told of his
recent questions at alumni con
ference addresses. He asks the
alumni how they would react to
the great heroes of fiction if they

stepped out of the book into real
life.

Guerard noted the sympathy
evoked by Heathcliff, Lord Jim,
Gatsby and Joe Christmas. The
novelists “take repulsive charac
ters, put them in the most inhu
mane situation possible, then try
to create sympathy for them.”
Though the novel is “not the
situation of reai life, it may still
discipline the mind.” The novel,
"far more than in a play ... in a
biography” permits one to “enter
into anothers’ mind.”
“The reader of a great novel is
less likely to assume that every
one’s thought processes are the
same.”
According to Guerard, “The ex
treme achievement in a novel is
what Blake attributes to Milton.”
Said Blake, Milton is “a true poet
and in the devil’s force without
knowing it.”
