# 'Vagabond' Provides Helpful Tips On Travel for the Inexperienced
## 
### CAROL GARDNER 
The “Vagabond”, a magazine on student travel,
provides basic information on traveling in Europe,
Asia, Africa, and Latin America that helps an in
experienced traveler avoid some of the problems
of ignorance in a foreign country.
The booklet offers suggestions which can help
the traveler escape the tourist traps and lake ad
vantage of the opportunity to live as the natives
of the country.

EDITOR DEAN Savage explains in the “Vaga
bond’s” Introduction that the booklet is not de
signed to be a comprehensive tour guide with de
tailed information about countries and places to
visit.

“Tlie ‘Vagabond’ is a set of general information
on transportation, lodging and food,” he says. The
booklet also includes suggestions for obtaining
visas, staying healthy, dealing with officials, wear
ing suitable clothes, and taking advantage of oppor
tunities to meet people who will make the trip more
interesting.

The section on European travel includes general
information on means of transportation, inexpen
sive lodging, cheap restaurants, and suggests a
few interesting places to visit in each country.
This information provides the student who has
never traveled in Europe with the general knowl
edge that others have learned and preserved from
experience.

SINCE THE information is generalized to apply
to conditions in an entire country, the general facts
might not apply to a traveler’s particular situation.
Although food in the student cafeterias is inexpen
sive, the meals do not always satisfy a hungry
traveler. The information on buying certain cards
in the United Slates, to save money on transporta
tion and get reductions on entrance fees in Europe

is particularly worthwhile.
The listed European student organizations which
provide travel information can give a traveler
many suggestoins for a more interesting trip.
THE SECTIONS on travel in Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union provide helpful suggestions
on visas, means of transportation, and lodging,
which one might not learn in a travel bureau or a
travel guide.
The “Vagabond’’ roams to Africa and Asia tell
ing about some ways to travel, places to spend the
night, and things to eat which contrast sharply
with (raveling situations in Europe.

The author describes the unusual discomforts
of traveling in these areas, and stresses the thrill
of overcoming the difficulties and the enjoyment
from seeing different cultures and lands.

He suggests particular routes through the
Asian and African countries which are economi
cally and physically feasible for a student. These
routes offer a basic travel plan; the student’s in
genuity has to discover the particular incidents
which make the trip worth the effort.
The sections on Latin America provide general
and specific information that can be very helpful
to an experienced traveler in these countries. The
author emphasizes that a traveler in Latin Amer
ica should be able to speak Spanish. Being able to
speak the native language was not stressed enough
in the other sections of the booklet.

TRAVELING in Latin America presents many
of the same discomforts to the traveler tHat are
mentioned in the sections on Asia and Africa.
Nevertheless, the author says that the satisfactions
of bumming around are greater than the diffi
culties. The booklet is certainly worth the $1 which
future travelers will have to pay for a copy today
at either Engineering Corner or the Post Office.

sive, the meals do not always satisfy a hungry

of the same discomforts to the traveler tHat are
mentioned in the sections on Asia and Africa.
Nevertheless, the author says that the satisfactions
of bumming around are greater than the diffi
culties. The booklet is certainly worth the $1 which
