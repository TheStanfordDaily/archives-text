### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Presi
dent Kennedy urged Soviet Pre
mier Nikita Khrushchev Tuesday
to forego sterile propaganda and
join him in close personal support
of efforts to reach a genuine dis
armament agreement.
In a note running only about
170 words, the President ex
pressed gratification that Khrush
chev had dropped his demand for
an immediate summit conference
and had agreed to a U.S.-British
proposal to open the March 14
Geneva disarmament talks at the
foreign ministers level.
Kennedy said ho was particu
larly glad that Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko would
meet Secretary of State Dean
Rusk and British Foreign Secre
tary Lord Home before the formal
opening of the 18-nation talks.
The President said he hoped
these preliminary discussions
could begin next Monday.
In his note, dated Monday and
delivered to the Kremlin yes
terday, the President ignored
Khrushchev’s threat to resume
nuclear testing if Kennedy goes
through with his decision to start
U.S. atomic tests in the atmos
phere in late April.

The Chief Executive said he did
not wish to answer Khrushchev’s
latest charges against the United
States, including the assertion
that Kennedy is indulging in
“atomic blackmail” by going
ahead with the tests unless Rus
sia signs an effective test ban
treaty.

The goal of the world must bo
to make real progress toward dis
armament and “not to engage in
sterile exchanges of propaganda,”
Kennedy wrote.
“In that spirit, I shall not un
dertake at this time to comment
on the many sentiments in your
latter with which, as I am sure
you know, the United States gov
ernment cannot agree,” the Pres
ident continued.
Instead, he said, “lot us . . .
join in giving our close personal
support and direction to the work
of our representatives and let us
join in working for their success.”
