news agency Tass said yesterday,
were made in Khrushchev s reply
to Kennedy accepting the Anglo-
American proposal lor opening
talks at the Geneva disarmament
conference at the foreign minis
ters level instead of at the sum
mit as the Soviet premier wanted.

But in accepting the proposal
“with regret” according to his
reply to British Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan Khrushchev
indicated he felt the U.S. test pro
posal advanced by Kennedy
would virtually doom the confer
ence before it started.

Khrushchev did not specify
what new types of nuclear weap
ons Russia would test. But he
told Kennedy;
“You arc opening another round
in the contest in creating the
most death-dealing types of nu
clear weapons and are starting

. . . a chain reaction which will
become ever more tempestous.”
Kennedy announced last Friday
that the United States would re
sume atmospheric nuclear tests
unless an agreement for a test
ban with adequate controls could
be reached by late April.

KENNEDY stressed that his
decision was based solely on the
interests of security of the United
States and its Western allies. He
said the decision was made after
careful analysis of the Soviet at
mospheric nuclear test series last
fall and was aimed at preventing
the West from falling behind
Russia in nuclear weapons devel
opment.

Khrushchev said Kennedy’s de
cision was “an aggressive force
in foreign affairs” and a blow to
the Geneva talks.

The Soviet premier said Ken
nedy committed something that
“would look too much like atomic
blackmail” by offering to cancel
the American tests if the Soviet
Union would agree to a test ban
treaty.

“IS IT, perhaps, expected of
the Soviet Union to reply if it is
ready, even before the United
States begins its nuclear tests in
April, to agree to the terms—
which we have already rejected -
of a treaty which would in the
guise of international control
over the ending of tests, lead to
the establishment of a ramified
network of intelligence and es
pionage.” Khrushchev asked.
