The reason: to find the shape of the
future—future cars, that is. By creat
ing man-made monsoons in labora
tory wind tunnels, Ford Motor
Company scientists and engineers
are able to test the effects of aero
dynamic designonthefuel economy,
passing ability and stability of pas
senger cars.
They use %-scale model cars and
blow gales past them up to 267 mph
—to simulate 100-mph car speeds.
In addition to analyzing shapes with
an eye to reducing air drag, our
scientists and engineers are study
ing means of improving vehicle con
trol through proper aerodynamic
design.
Experimental projects like this are
helping pave the way for major
advances in tomorrow's cars . . .
advances which could bring even
better fuel economy, better perform
ance with less engine effort and
safer driving at higher cruising
speeds. This is just one more
example of how Ford is gaining
leadership through scientific re
search and engineering.
