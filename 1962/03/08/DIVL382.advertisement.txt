We need men with open minds
The Underwood Corporation,
long the best-known name in
typewriters, intends to be an
increasingly important factor in
the business-machine sector of
the world's economy.
To do so, we must enlist young
men of vision, courage and
intelligence, eager to fulfill their
highest potential and capable
of assuming major responsibili
ties in the near future.
After completing Underwood's
management training program,
the men we choose will be
assigned to sales and marketing
work, mainly in the United
States but in some cases over
seas. From this area they may
progress to key management
positions, at a rate dictated by
their individual performances.
Because Underwood's activities
ore international in scope, an
intelligent world outlook is high
among the qualifications we
emphasize. For this same rea
son, and because the opportuni
ties for individual achievement
are so varied, we seek men
majoring in liberal arts and the
humanities, as well as marketing
and business majors.
Our goal is long-range. Our
reed is immediate. Interested
students should contact the
Placement Director for an inter
view appointment. The Under
wood representative will be on
campus Thursday, April 12th.
