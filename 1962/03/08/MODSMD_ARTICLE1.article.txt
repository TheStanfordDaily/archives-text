# 'Dour Old Men' Wrong Image of Stanford Trustees Says Pike
## 
### THOMAS P. PIKE, ’31 President, Stanford University Board of Trustees 
Since I received the request for an article
about the University Board of Trustees I
have been trying to recall how we visual
ized the Trustees and their function when I
was a student. Although I am well aware
that Stanford students of this generation
are more seriously interested and bettor in
formed about the University, I wonder if
your image of the Trustees is really much
different from the one we held.

It seems safe to say that we did not give
the Board much thought. They seemed com
pletely divorced from the “real” University

—the one in which we lived. Most of us, I
think, visualized the Trustees as a group of
dour old men in stiff collars who were
absorbed only in Stanford’s financial opera
tions and whose interest in students stopped
when they had paid their tuition and fees.
We did not credit them with having much of
an understanding of education and wo sup
posed that they looked upon their role as
University Trustees in the same way they
viewed their positions on the boards of di
rectors of corporations; "Stanford is busi
ness.”

THAT IMAGE of the Trustees was
wrong. How wrong it was I discovered long
before I was ever closely associated with the
Board. Working with alumni groups and in
the various programs that comprised The
Stanford Fund, I soon learned that our suc
cesses were directly proportionate to the de
gree of Trustee interest that had been en
gaged. The qualities of individual leadership
that I had not recognized in the Board when
I was a student, were basic to our ability to
organize and stimulate alumni activities in

the University’s interest.
When I joined the Board of Trustees in
1957, I learned something more. Stanford’s
Trustees are deeply and personally dedicated
to the institution for which they are respon
sible. No corporation could command any
thing like this devotion from a board of
directors.
THE STANFORD BOARD is also a work
ing board. This I know, hut what I did not
know was how hard it works. Preparation
for the regular monthly meeting involves
hours of study and review for each Trustee.
Absorbing the background information lead
ing up to the point of a major decision by
the Trustees may (and frequently does) re
quire a full day’s work.
The program for a typical Board meeting
is set out in 60 to 80 single-spaced, mimeo
graphed pages prepared by President Ster
ling’s staff. The agenda normally includes
20 or more items requiring Board action and
an additional list of report matters to be
presented by the University’s president and
three vice-presidents.

Each of the Board’s committees convenes
prior to the formal meeting of the full
Board. Some matters, of course, call for
special meetings of committees. These com
mittees are; Academic Affairs, Buildings and
Grounds, Finance, Investments, Land Devel
opment, and Planning and Development.
Committee appointments are made by the
president of the Board of Trustees, but any
Trustee may participate in the deliberations
of any committee.

I WOULD CONVEY an erroneous impres
sion. if I led you to believe that the Board
glides through its sessions with unanimity
of opinion in all things. It does not. The vari
ety of individualism personified in the Stan
ford Board is enough in itself to guarantee

debate. The professional training and aca
demic experience represented is a further
guarantee. But it is the seriousness with
which these men and women accept their
roles as Trustees that underlies their critical
attention to the details of operating a major
university that is self-sustaining and cher
ishes its independence.

When I was a student, the Board was
composed of 12 members. There were no
women among them, nor had there ever
been. Today there are three women Trustees
and no one will dispute that they are effec
tive well beyond their number. A court
decree issued in 1954 enabled an increase in
(ho Board to 23 members. At the present
time there are 22 active Trustees and 7
emeriti. There are Alumni Trustees, elected
for five-year terms, while the other members
of the Board are elected for terms of ten
years. All serve without compensation.
Eighteen of the Trustees are Stanford
alumni. Their class years range from 1913
to 1951. Six Trustees hold advanced degrees
from Stanford, seven hold advanced degrees
from Harvard, and one earned his Ph.D. at
Cornell.
THE RESPONSIBILITIES of the Stan
ford Board of Trustees are deeper and in
many ways broader than the governing
boards of other American Universities. As
an economic entity, for example, Stanford
is not only an important enterprise in terms
of its own annual volume of “business”
(which is very close to $5O million a year),
but its economic influence upon the San
Francisco Peninsula and, in fact, upon the
whole State of California has been far great
er than its own physical worth in dollars
and cents.

That portion of the electronics industry
alone which was spawned in the University’s

laboratories easily exceed Stanford’s dollar
worth. The development of Stanford’s en
dowment lands, which are unique among
private university assets, presents the Trus
tees a responsibility in itself to equal that
of a corporate board of directors. The man
agement of an endowment that is greater
than the assets of some well-advertised
banking and insurance companies is another
economic responsibility the Trustees cannot
take lightly.

Of course the total value of a university
cannot be translated into dollars. No group
of persons associated with Stanford is more
keenly aware of this fact than the Trustees.
The point I would emphasize, however, is
that no other group of persons is legally
charged with the ultimate responsibility for
the University’s economic welfare. There
fore, the Board of Trustees must devote an
important share of its energies to this end.

THE POWERS of the Trustees are derived
from the Founding Grant and from the State
Constitution. These powers are actually far
greater than I might have supposed when
I was an undergraduate. The Founding
Grant, for instance, designates these duties
to the Trustees:

To manage and control the insti
tution hereby founded.
To manage and control the trust
property, care for and improve the
same, operate or lease it, and apply
the net proceeds or profits thereof to
the purposes of the trust hereby cre
ated.

To, in their discretion, receive
grants of property from others in aid
of the Institution founded. . . .
To appoint a President of the Uni
versity. . . .
To employ professors and teachers

at the University.
To fix the salaries of the President,
professors, and teachers, and to fix
them at such rates as will secure to
the University the services of men of
the very highest attainments.
To prohibit sectarian instruction,
but to have taught in the University
the immortality of the soul, the exist
ence of an all-wise and benevolent Cre
ator, and that obedience to His laws
is the highest duty of man.
To establish and maintain at such
University an educational system
which will, if followed, fit the gradu
ate for some useful pursuit. . . .
OVER THE YEARS my respect for the
wisdom of the Founders has deepened, not
because of the specific powers they entrust
ed to the Board or to the officers of the Uni
versity but because so much of my experi
ence within Stanford as a student, as an
alumnus, and finally as a Trustee has dem
onstrated how truly wise they were. Much
of that wisdom has been transmitted from
generation to generation of Trustees. There
is in this Board a spirit of faith in the Uni
versity’s future that was implanted by the
Founders.
There is a respect for the men and wTom
en who have served Stanford’s students and
for the students who as alumni have brought
honor to their Alma Mater as responsible
citizens in free society. There is much more,
but I will be explicit about only one other
force I did not recognize when I was an
undergraduate. This is the respect which the
Trustees have for Stanford students, their
pride in your accomplishments and their
constant concern that the opportunities af
forded you will exceed the opportunities
obtainable in any other university.
