# I-Center Vital to Foreign Students

(Editor's Note: Silloo Mistry of Bombay,
India, is one of last, year’s ASSU and Cap
and Gown Scholars. She is currently a resi
dent assistant at Lagunita. The following
article tells her feelings about the I-Center
and the current Winter Drives campaign.)

It was a cold morning. I had been at the
Library for a couple of hours and still had
half an hour to kill before my next class.
I toyed with the idea of going to the Cellar,
but having to wait in a long line for a tepid
cup of coffee, then elbow my way to a table
still bearing the ruins of somebody’s late
breakfast, and sit in splendid isolation in
the noise and crowd, decided against that.
Instead, I turned to the I-Center’s tempo
rary home in the Women’s Clubhouse base
ment.
The lady at the desk met me with a
friendly smile, and helped out with change
for the coffee machine. For a nickel (yes, a
nickel) I was fortified with a cup of piping
hot coffee.

I SANK into one of the comfortable
chairs, admired the floral arrangements, and
tried to decide whether I should join the dis
cussion on the Indian political scene or the
group talking about the Japanese No Plays,
or listen to an American student defending
the Twist against all comers.
There were also the alterntaives of play
ing the phonograph (the record pile is much
diminished, but still attractive) or reading
international and local newspapers and
magazines.
AT THIS POINT, let me destroy two
well-cherished stereotypes attributed to the
I-Center habitue- he is not a lonely, intro
verted (accent on the introverted) foreign
student, nor is he the American who can’t
get on with his own kind. On the contrary,
you can always count on finding someone
with whom to chat casually, or discuss in
tensely matters ranging from cabbages to
kings.
The American students who frequent the
I-Center are a lively well-informed bunch.
THK I-CLUB programming discussion
groups, coffee hours, evenings abroad and

dances—is efficient, fun and designed for
the student who likes to participate. The
atmosphere is relaxed, the tensions of social
pressure are removed (to start a conversa
tion with your neighbor is not regarded as
‘hustling’ in the I-Center) and the oppor
tunities for individual expression myriad.
The I-Center is an integral part of the
foreign student’s life. It is his information
bureau inquiries range from “Where can
I get my shoes heeled?” to “What can I do
over vacation?” It is his chance to catch up
with home news, but most of ail it is his op
portunity to meet and converse with people.
TO ALL of you who give so generously
of your money, do spare us a little of your
time. Come and see where your contributions
are used, and to what purpose. With a few
minutes of conversation with a foreign stu
dent you can remove his stereotype of the
self-centered, insincere American.
The I-Center is the hub of the foreign
student’s social life. It is his country club,
ball room, coffee house and meeting ground
with that rare species “the American un
dergrad.”
