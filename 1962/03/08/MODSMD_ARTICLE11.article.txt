# New Cuts in Tariff Announced by U.S.

### 
WASHINGTON (DPI) American tariff-cutting agreements
with 31 non-Communist nations were made public yesterday and
President Kennedy promptly hailed them as an indication that
this country and the European Common Market can bargain
together. The agreements provided for reciprocal lowering of
tariffs on many industrial items | _________________

and some farm products.
The President told his news con
ference the United States obtained
concessions “on those very items
which are most essential” for
boosting American exports and to
curb losses of gold and dollars to
other countries.
Because American negotiators
had “limited bargaining author
ity” under present law, Kennedy
said, “it was necessary to breach
the peril points” on some items
“to avoid a complete breakdown
in negotiations and to obtain
worthwhile concessions for our
own businessmen and farmers.”
It was the first time peril points
had been breached. They are
tariff levels, as determined by the
tariff commission, below which
American industry would suffer,
or be likely to suffer, serious in
jury from imports.
The President said the new
agreements marked the limit of
tariff reduction possible under
present legislation. He appealed
to Congress for a “strong” trade
expansion act with new tariff
cutting authority, such as he has
proposed, to bring within reach of
American enterprise “the real
opportunities offered us by the
Common Market.”
Administration officials said the
need to undercut some peril points
supported the President’s position
that the entire peril point pro
cedure needs to be modified. Modi
fication is part of Kennedy’s broad
request for new tariff-cutting
authority.
