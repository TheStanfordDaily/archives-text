# The 						Growing Folk Music Capacity
## 
### 
The folk-singer market is picking up tin's season.
Last night’s Pete Seeger concert, last of a series of three folk
concerts this quarter, again brought out a growing group of folk
devotees to hear one of the country’s most outstanding folk
musicians.
Seeger’s reception was the third enthusiastic one of the series.
And although the kind of entertainment has varied, the excited
reaction has not.
The impact of folk-type music has been increasing steadily
ever since the Kingston Trio. Taste is becoming more sophisti
cated; the emphasis recently has been on quality.
Two years ago Odetta and Seeger both appeared at Palo Alto
High School. Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry played at Cnb
berley.
But this quarter, the Limeliters, Miriam Makeba and Seeger
have all performed in Memorial Auditorium, and they have all
filled it. Large numbers of Stanford students went up to Berkeley
to hear Joan Baez.
Stanford’s capacity for folk entertainment is growing rapidly.
It is our hope that it will be pampered, expanded, and finallv
allowed to thrive on an increasing list of artists in performance at
Memorial Auditorium.
