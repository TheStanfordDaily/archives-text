## 'Nuremberg' Is Hurt By Lack Of Conflict, Character Depth 
### ALAN ROSENTHAL 
“Judgment at Nuremberg” has
been nominated for 11 Academy
Awards. “It’s “star-studded” as
they say. It’s big. You’ll have to
see it sooner or later or be a so
cial outcast. O.K. So let’s try and
get it in perspective.
"Who is responsible?” At what
point does national interest over
ride personal responsibility?
What guides the state morality
or the individual conscience?
These are the themes.
THE SETTING in Nuremberg
in 1948. An American Judge
(Spencer Tracy) is in the process
of trying four Nazi judges, who
stand as symbols for the crimes
committed between 1933 and
1945. In the course of the trial
the judges are confronted with
some of their victims a girl
(Judy Garland) whom they sen
tenced for race pollution, a sim
ple-minded baker (Montgomery
Clift) w'hom they had sterilized.
The prosecution shows pictures
of the concentration camps and
the ovens. The defense counsel
retorts by implicating the whole
world in the Nazi guilt, and fi
nally throws the horrors of Hiro
shima into the faces of the ac
cusers. Who has the right to
judge? “You judge us today,”
says one of the Germans, “to
morrow the Bolsheviks will judge
you.”
POLITICAL pressures appear
in the midst of the trial. Berlin
is blockaded. German sympathy
is needed against the Russians.
The prosecution and the court
are told to soft pedal the issue.
The American judges are now
faced with a moral dilemma
somewhat akin to that of the Ger
mans they are trying.
This then is the framework.
It can he viewed from many
levels and I just want to touch
on a few that I feel concerned
about.
Firstly the film suffers from a
lack of conflict. We have not the
slightest doubt that Tracy will
find the judges guilty. Why? Be
cause he is established early in
the film as kind, honest, sincere.
In fact he is the passionately
honest all-American boy grown
up. It is impossible for him to
follow anything other than the

path of true justice. Therefore
we are aware that the film con
flicts are merely dramatic con
trivances which will not effect
the issue.
WITHOUT conflict the film re
solves itself as a series of alter
nately interesting and ridiculous
character studies and a mass of
polemical arguments.
Tracy lacks depth. So do his
German counterparts. Three are
straight caricatures, the money
grabber, the coward and the sad
ist. The fourth, woodenly played
by Bert Lancaster, represents
the foremost legal mind of his
day, an honourable man gone
wrong. We are interested in him
but never satisfied by the filmic
explanation of his character.
THE VICTIMS are well played
and Maximilian Schell as the de
fense counsel gives a perform
ance of high conviction and in
telligence. However, I found the
scenes with Marlene Dietrich por
traying the wife of an executed
General absolutely ludicrous.
Her self-appointed task is to
persuade the American Judge
that not all Germans are bad.
which she does in “kitsch” cos
tumes, soft focus, and by croon
ing “Lilli Marlene.” Here I must
admit that many friends whose
opinion I value disagree with me.
How can one discuss Kramer?
As a director? as a moralist?
Both have their places. As a di
rector Kramer is pedestrian, and
in “Nuremberg” downright crude
at times. In fact it seems to me
that his nomination for an Oscar
is just added proof of the farci
cality of the whole institution.
WHAT ARE we left with? A
film that is an hour too long,
lacks conflict and is too diverse
in its moral probings. On the bal
ance side there is some versatile
acting and the film has a certain
immediacy for which one com
mends Kramer and scriptwriter
Abby Mann.
Together Kramer and Mann
have had the courage to tackle
issues that have long been at the
hack of the minds of many of us.
unfortunately courage is not
enough, and Kramer lacks the
sensitivity and imagination that
would have made this a really
good film instead of merely an
interesting one.
