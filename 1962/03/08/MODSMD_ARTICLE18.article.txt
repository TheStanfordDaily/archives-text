THE HOUR
Editor, The Daily:
In the most recent edition of
the Chaparral, the coveted Ed
Cutter Memorial Award for
Legislative Interference (the
“Eddy” as it is affectionately
known around our campus) was
awarded to Mr. Jock Mcßaine,
legislative assistant to Bob Say
ler. Unfortunately, Mr. Mcßaine
now admits that he did NOT per
form the outstandingly ingenious i
feat of bureaucratic pettifogging !
for which he was so honored. Let
it be known therefore, that Jock
Mcßaine is stripped of the Ed
Cutter Memorial Award, and de
prived of the honorary title “Liv- |
ing Legend,” attendant upon that
award.
To the campus in general, our |
apologies for any inconvenience
this unfortunate but necessary I
reversal may have caused. (Dis- 1
putes over wagers should be j
settled either personally or with j
the Dean. Please do not come

over to the Chaparral shack.) To
Mr. Mcßaine, a stern warning
the Ed Cutter Award can be won
only by self-sacrifice and a genu
ine desire to resist innovation

and creativity on the Stanford
Campus. Duplicity may win the
hour, but it will never win the
day.
The Old Boy
