# Psych Revision Needed
## 
### JOHN CHIORINI For the .Sub-committee on Academic Review 
The Stanford Psychology De
partment attracts many non-ma
jors as well as majors to most of
its courses, and it therefore has
difficulty in deciding to which
group, major or non-major, its
presentation should be aimed.
The department can offer
either general lectures providing
a broad background of under
standing, or it can deal with spe
cific areas at the risk of confus
ing students who lack the neces
sary background.
At present the department has
no consistent policy regarding
this choice. As a result, its ad
vanced courses in widely diversi
fied areas often involve over
lapping material, so that the
psychology major is subjected to

courses which are more general
and superficial than his exten
sive background warants.
ANOTHER possible criticism
is that the department lacks close
contact between student and in
structor; failure to provide
enough class discussion results
in, at best, a shallow investiga
tion of the material covered.
Many psychology courses in
clude weekly section meetings,
but those too often deteriorate
into mere question and answer
sessions for the benefit of the
non-majors, who often comprise
25 to 30 per cent of the class.
Such sessions are doubly waste
ful: first, they are too shallow to
interest or stimulate the major
student, and second, they do not
utilize the potentials of the sec
tion leaders, an exceptionally tal
ented group of graduate students.

HOW SHOULD the Psychology
Department solve this problem?
It should institute a number of
upper-division seminars—limited
to psychology majors—in which
discussion in depth could replace
lecture presentation.
The major student could thus
profit by exposure to the theo
retical approaches of different
members of the department, both
professors and graduate students,
and would feel more a part of a
program concentrating on his de
velopment as a psychology ma
jor.
In order to offer seminars, the
department should be structural
ly reorganized by the creation of
a hierarchy of courses. At the
first level would remain Psychol
ogy I and 60, the beginning, Gen
eral Sudies courses.
AT THE second level should be
those courses dealing with the
specific areas of psychology, i.e.,
child and abnormal, which were
introduced by Psych I. This level
should also include the introduc
tory laboratory courses in these
specific areas.
Such a structuring would not
radically depart from the exist
ing system, except that it would
build upon the material of Psy
chology I much more than is
presently done.
The difference would occur at
the third level, which would con
sist of intensive seminars offered
to psych majors only. In these
seminars, the student could fur
ther pursue some areas of special
interest to him out of those intro
duced in the second level.

This reorganization would have
two-fold results: first, more
structure and direction would be
given to the program of the ma
jor, and second, more of his con
tact with psychology would be on
the level of detailed study and
small discussion groups.

Whether this can be accom
plished in a school where many
students in other departments
want more than an introduction
to psychology remains to be seen.
With the growing interest of the
student body in psych as a major,
however, the department will
have to recognize its obligation to
provide a program oriented to
ward the needs of the psychology
major, not those of the survey
student.

THK FACULTY of tho Psychol
ogy Department is outstanding.
Some of its men and women are
so renowned nationally that the
possibility of working with them
attracts an unusually high caliber
of graduate student.
If the department was reor
ganized to include more small
seminars, the presence of those
so distinguished in their fields
could bo better utilized by under
graduates. Rather than giving in
troductory courses which sum
marize the general field, the fac
ulty could give to the major with
sufficient background, a deeper
knowledge of their own research
and of theoretical approaches to
psychology.
