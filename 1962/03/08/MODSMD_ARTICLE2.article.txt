# Algerians, French Enter Final Round
## 
### 
EVIAN, France (UPl)â€”French and Algerian rebel negoti
ators opened a final round of peace talks here yesterday under
protection of machine guns. The rebels promptly demanded that
France pledge to launch all-out war against the Secret Army
Organization (OAS) if it tried to sabotage a cease-fire. Reliable

French sources, however, said
holh sides exchanged assurances
at the start of the talks that nei
ther would go back on the draft
cease-fire accord already worked
out in secret negotiations last
month.

THE TWO delegations met in]
morning and afternoon sessions 1
in their drive to end the 7-year
old Algerian War before terrorist
violence in Algeria rages out of
control. To guard against any at
tempt by the outlawed OA3 to
wreck the Evian talks, French au
thorities virtually sealed off this
Lake Geneva resort town with a
tight security cordon.
The Algerian delegation, which
is living on the Swiss side of the
lake opposite Evian, arrived
aboard three Swiss army heli
copters that touched down on the
lawn just in front of the Hotel
Du Parc, site of the conference.
TWO FRENCH army half
tracks, with heavy anti-aircraft
machine guns mounted on them,
kept guard over the landing strip,
and strong forces of blue-uni
formed Republican security
guards surrounded the hotel
grounds.
The talks were expected to last
eight to 10 days. Both sides pro
claimed their determination, de
spite the prospect of tough bar
gaining, to reach agreement on
a cease-fire that was expected
to lead to full independence for
Algeria by the end of this year.
BECAUSE of the touchy nature
of tlic talks, both French and Al
gerian delegates agreed on a
policy of secrecy, and newsmen
were kept at a distance.
The program starts at 7:15 p.m.
and includes a television docu
mentary on the problems and
prospects of Brazil. All those in
terested in Brazil are invited.
