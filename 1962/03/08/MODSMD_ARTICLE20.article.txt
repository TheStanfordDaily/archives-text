PRINCIPLES
Editor, The Daily;
The Stanford students in a re
cent poll indicated that they
would rather die than relinquish
their principles.
We are calmly rational; we do
not hesitate in the face of war—
after all, we have our principles
to stand by. But death for the
sake of “principles” means death
to everyone. And where will our
principles bo when our families
are dead, when we grope along
the twisted trunks and charred
branches, when we grovel on the
ground and pray, pray for one
more bomb to complete this rout
of mankind, pray to end the
throat’s parchness and the bone’s
ache, to end the sudden thought
that without life principles do
not exist?
Individual men make princi
ples, not the newspapers or the
blaring of radios. Men with prin
ciples die in the doorways of
dark streets; their bodies lie in
the ditches and crags of hills, or
hang like tattered rags on barbed
wire.
Where are the Stanford stu
dents? Where are their voices?
Where is their love of life? We
look and find nothing. We dis
miss the death of 50 million
breathing, striving, loving hu
mans in the name of principles,
dry, cold, intelloctualized prin
ciples.
But Ihe true principles spring
from the inner heart of life itself.
Donald King
A FRACTION
Editor, The Daily:
Since student housing seems to
have aroused considerable inter
est on campus recently, we would
like to bring up a much neglected
aspect of the problem, housing
for graduate women.
Stanford has nearly 600 gradu
ate women students, and provides
housing for exactly 22 of them.
Graduate women arrive, often
from foreign countries, with no
idea about how they are to bo ac
commodated, and are obliged to
go room hunting on very short
notice, usually with no means of
transportation, at the same time
as they are being faced with the
many more important problems
of starting graduate work at a

strange university.
Housing accommodations in
and around Palo Alto are char
acterized, with a few rare excep
tions, by exorbitant rents and in
adequate facilities. Most gradu
ate students can no longer count
on the financial support of their
parents, and are thus in special
need of inexpensive but comfort
able housing, especially if they
are to carry on their work effici
ently.

We fail to understand why
large sums of money are being
spent on such projects as the re
decoration of Stern Hall, a rela
tively new building, which re
sembles a luxury hotel when com
pared with Mariposa House,
while all but a fraction of Stan
ford’s graduate women remain
unhoused.

Although living conditions in
Mariposa House are far from
ideal, we consider ourselves very
lucky to be living there. Natural
ly there are improvements we
would like to see: we wish we
could have private roms; we wish
wo didn’t have to pay a dime for
each phone call; we wish we had
more than one bathtub, etc.; but
most of all. we wish there were
some kind of university-provided
housing that would accommodate
all, or at least most of our fellow
graduate women.
Promises from the administra

tion are encouraging, but of very
little help to the women whose
pocket-books are now being
strained by Palo Alto rents and
whose social contacts are ex
tremely limited, and even loss
to the many women who will be
arriving as new students next
September, only to find they have
no place to go. When will we see
some concrete action?

RECOGNITION
Editor, The Daily:
There are many students on
campus who receive little recog
nition and praise for their work.
To alter this situation, at least in
one case, I am writing this letter.
The performance given by the
group from Adelfa in the Serra
lounge on Tuesday evening was
remarkably enter taining and
well received. For those who did
not have an opportunity to see
the play, perhaps the group can
be persuaded to continue the run
of “The Bald Soprano.” The di
rection and acting was much bet
ter than one would expect from
such an informal cast.
The fact that close to 100 peo
ple were crowded into the lounge
is reason for hoping that more
student groups will be encourag
ed to come out of their hiding
places and that such groups will
continue to find appreciative
audiences. Though the amount of
time spent by Adelfa in preparing
the production was undoubtedly
prohibitive, those who saw their
performance will certainly agree
that it was time well spent.

spent on such projects as the re
decoration of Stern Hall, a rela
tively new building, which re
sembles a luxury hotel when com
pared with Mariposa House,
while all but a fraction of Stan
ford’s graduate women remain
unhoused.

Although living conditions in
Mariposa House are far from
ideal, we consider ourselves very
lucky to be living there. Natural
ly there are improvements we
would like to see: we wish we
could have private roms; we wish
wo didn’t have to pay a dime for
each phone call; we wish we had
more than one bathtub, etc.; but
most of all. we wish there were
some kind of university-provided
housing that would accommodate
all, or at least most of our fellow
graduate women.
Promises from the administra

tion are encouraging, but of very
little help to the women whose
pocket-books are now being
strained by Palo Alto rents and
whose social contacts are ex
tremely limited, and even loss
to the many women who will be
arriving as new students next
September, only to find they have
no place to go. When will we see
some concrete action?

RECOGNITION
Editor, The Daily:
There are many students on
campus who receive little recog
nition and praise for their work.
To alter this situation, at least in
one case, I am writing this letter.
The performance given by the
group from Adelfa in the Serra
lounge on Tuesday evening was
remarkably enter taining and
well received. For those who did
not have an opportunity to see
the play, perhaps the group can
be persuaded to continue the run
of “The Bald Soprano.” The di
rection and acting was much bet
ter than one would expect from
such an informal cast.
The fact that close to 100 peo
ple were crowded into the lounge
is reason for hoping that more
student groups will be encourag
ed to come out of their hiding
places and that such groups will
continue to find appreciative
audiences. Though the amount of
time spent by Adelfa in preparing
the production was undoubtedly
prohibitive, those who saw their
performance will certainly agree
that it was time well spent.

PRINCIPLES
Editor, The Daily;
The Stanford students in a re
cent poll indicated that they
would rather die than relinquish
their principles.
We are calmly rational; we do
not hesitate in the face of war—
after all, we have our principles
to stand by. But death for the
sake of “principles” means death
to everyone. And where will our
principles bo when our families
are dead, when we grope along
the twisted trunks and charred
branches, when we grovel on the
ground and pray, pray for one
more bomb to complete this rout
of mankind, pray to end the
throat’s parchness and the bone’s
ache, to end the sudden thought
that without life principles do
not exist?
Individual men make princi
ples, not the newspapers or the
blaring of radios. Men with prin
ciples die in the doorways of
dark streets; their bodies lie in
the ditches and crags of hills, or
hang like tattered rags on barbed
wire.
Where are the Stanford stu
dents? Where are their voices?
Where is their love of life? We
look and find nothing. We dis
miss the death of 50 million
breathing, striving, loving hu
mans in the name of principles,
dry, cold, intelloctualized prin
ciples.
But Ihe true principles spring
from the inner heart of life itself.

A FRACTION
Editor, The Daily:
Since student housing seems to
have aroused considerable inter
est on campus recently, we would
like to bring up a much neglected
aspect of the problem, housing
for graduate women.
Stanford has nearly 600 gradu
ate women students, and provides
housing for exactly 22 of them.
Graduate women arrive, often
from foreign countries, with no
idea about how they are to bo ac
commodated, and are obliged to
go room hunting on very short
notice, usually with no means of
transportation, at the same time
as they are being faced with the
many more important problems
of starting graduate work at a

strange university.
Housing accommodations in
and around Palo Alto are char
acterized, with a few rare excep
tions, by exorbitant rents and in
adequate facilities. Most gradu
ate students can no longer count
on the financial support of their
parents, and are thus in special
need of inexpensive but comfort
able housing, especially if they
are to carry on their work effici
ently.

The Stanford students in a re
cent poll indicated that they
would rather die than relinquish
their principles.
We are calmly rational; we do
not hesitate in the face of war—
after all, we have our principles
to stand by. But death for the
sake of “principles” means death
to everyone. And where will our
principles bo when our families
are dead, when we grope along
the twisted trunks and charred
branches, when we grovel on the
ground and pray, pray for one
more bomb to complete this rout
of mankind, pray to end the
throat’s parchness and the bone’s
ache, to end the sudden thought
that without life principles do
not exist?
Individual men make princi
ples, not the newspapers or the
blaring of radios. Men with prin
ciples die in the doorways of
dark streets; their bodies lie in
the ditches and crags of hills, or
hang like tattered rags on barbed
wire.
Where are the Stanford stu
dents? Where are their voices?
Where is their love of life? We
look and find nothing. We dis
miss the death of 50 million
breathing, striving, loving hu
mans in the name of principles,
dry, cold, intelloctualized prin
ciples.
But Ihe true principles spring
from the inner heart of life itself.

A FRACTION
Editor, The Daily:
Since student housing seems to
have aroused considerable inter
est on campus recently, we would
like to bring up a much neglected
aspect of the problem, housing
for graduate women.
Stanford has nearly 600 gradu
ate women students, and provides
housing for exactly 22 of them.
Graduate women arrive, often
from foreign countries, with no
idea about how they are to bo ac
commodated, and are obliged to
go room hunting on very short
notice, usually with no means of
transportation, at the same time
as they are being faced with the
many more important problems
of starting graduate work at a

strange university.
Housing accommodations in
and around Palo Alto are char
acterized, with a few rare excep
tions, by exorbitant rents and in
adequate facilities. Most gradu
ate students can no longer count
on the financial support of their
parents, and are thus in special
need of inexpensive but comfort
able housing, especially if they
are to carry on their work effici
ently.

We fail to understand why
large sums of money are being
spent on such projects as the re
decoration of Stern Hall, a rela
tively new building, which re
sembles a luxury hotel when com
pared with Mariposa House,
while all but a fraction of Stan
ford’s graduate women remain
unhoused.

Although living conditions in
Mariposa House are far from
ideal, we consider ourselves very
lucky to be living there. Natural
ly there are improvements we
would like to see: we wish we
could have private roms; we wish
wo didn’t have to pay a dime for
each phone call; we wish we had
more than one bathtub, etc.; but
most of all. we wish there were
some kind of university-provided
housing that would accommodate
all, or at least most of our fellow
graduate women.
Promises from the administra

tion are encouraging, but of very
little help to the women whose
pocket-books are now being
strained by Palo Alto rents and
whose social contacts are ex
tremely limited, and even loss
to the many women who will be
arriving as new students next
September, only to find they have
no place to go. When will we see
some concrete action?

RECOGNITION
Editor, The Daily:
There are many students on
campus who receive little recog
nition and praise for their work.
To alter this situation, at least in
one case, I am writing this letter.
The performance given by the
group from Adelfa in the Serra
lounge on Tuesday evening was
remarkably enter taining and
well received. For those who did
not have an opportunity to see
the play, perhaps the group can
be persuaded to continue the run
of “The Bald Soprano.” The di
rection and acting was much bet
ter than one would expect from
such an informal cast.
The fact that close to 100 peo
ple were crowded into the lounge
is reason for hoping that more
student groups will be encourag
ed to come out of their hiding
places and that such groups will
continue to find appreciative
audiences. Though the amount of
time spent by Adelfa in preparing
the production was undoubtedly
prohibitive, those who saw their
performance will certainly agree
that it was time well spent.
