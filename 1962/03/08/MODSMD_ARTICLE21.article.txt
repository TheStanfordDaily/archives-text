“To me academic freedom
moans academic anarchy. Any
thing goes. The San Jose (audit
ing) ruling ... is a serious in
fringement of academic free
dom.”
This was the analysis offered
Tuesday afternoon by Stanford
student and conservative Ross
Hermann, chairman of the Con
servative Caucus of the Political
Union.

AND IN days that see San Jose
faculty members reminding each
other to exercise profesional in
tegrity in the classroom as well
as before state legislative com
mittees, when Contra Costa Jun
ior College District is forced to
hold closed door meetings with
all sides represented by legal
counsel to delve into the presence
of “super-patriots” and “infiltra
tion” of the faculty by “extreme
leftists,” the impact of any given
incident extends beyond the boun
daries of one campus.

OVER THE space of Ihc past
year, Stanford professors have
had reports that students were

“keeping files on them”; tape re
corders have been spotted at
classroom lecturs dealing with
controversial subjects; a student
remarks, “If someone isn’t taking
notes on him tin reference to a
Stanford professor), they should
start.”

Stanford professors approach
ed on manifestations of “non-aca
demic note-takers, reply that (hey
have heard about them” but are

not worried or concerned. These
students have not approached
them; professors have only, in
the words of one, “heard rumbl
ings of their wasted activities.”
In the “academic anarchy” of
San Jose State, a lecturer at a
meeting a few nights ago was
confronted with a classroom
statement of his and asked to
justify it in relation to “subver
sive” content. SJS professors see
1 his as “tempering academic
freedom.”
At Stanford, a professor in a
recent campus address was asked
to justify a statement made in a
public lecture, as a “test” of his
objectivity in undertaking an aca
demic project.
AT STANFORD, a relatively
unafraid faculty and level headed
administrative approach could
destroy any efficacy in undercur
rent activity.

The crucial factor remains:
student opinion and approach to
what the Palo Times called “vigi
lante packs” and the Spartan
Daily "red-hunters.” The Stanford
faculty doesn’t appear to have
among its ranks anyone crusad
ing to rid the school of the hold
ers of certain political views.
The student body houses advo
cates of academic anarchy and,
possibly, “spies.” Students are
now left to decide if anarchy is to
be equated with freedom.

“To me academic freedom
moans academic anarchy. Any
thing goes. The San Jose (audit
ing) ruling ... is a serious in
fringement of academic free
dom.”
This was the analysis offered
Tuesday afternoon by Stanford
student and conservative Ross
Hermann, chairman of the Con
servative Caucus of the Political
Union.

AND IN days that see San Jose
faculty members reminding each
other to exercise profesional in
tegrity in the classroom as well
as before state legislative com
mittees, when Contra Costa Jun
ior College District is forced to
hold closed door meetings with
all sides represented by legal
counsel to delve into the presence
of “super-patriots” and “infiltra
tion” of the faculty by “extreme
leftists,” the impact of any given
incident extends beyond the boun
daries of one campus.

OVER THE space of Ihc past
year, Stanford professors have
had reports that students were

“keeping files on them”; tape re
corders have been spotted at
classroom lecturs dealing with
controversial subjects; a student
remarks, “If someone isn’t taking
notes on him tin reference to a
Stanford professor), they should
start.”

Stanford professors approach
ed on manifestations of “non-aca
demic note-takers, reply that (hey
have heard about them” but are

not worried or concerned. These
students have not approached
them; professors have only, in
the words of one, “heard rumbl
ings of their wasted activities.”
In the “academic anarchy” of
San Jose State, a lecturer at a
meeting a few nights ago was
confronted with a classroom
statement of his and asked to
justify it in relation to “subver
sive” content. SJS professors see
1 his as “tempering academic
freedom.”
At Stanford, a professor in a
recent campus address was asked
to justify a statement made in a
public lecture, as a “test” of his
objectivity in undertaking an aca
demic project.
AT STANFORD, a relatively
unafraid faculty and level headed
administrative approach could
destroy any efficacy in undercur
rent activity.

The crucial factor remains:
student opinion and approach to
what the Palo Times called “vigi
lante packs” and the Spartan
Daily "red-hunters.” The Stanford
faculty doesn’t appear to have
among its ranks anyone crusad
ing to rid the school of the hold
ers of certain political views.
