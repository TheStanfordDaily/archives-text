# Strong Frosh Track Team Threatens Several Records
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Stanford’s frosh track team,
faced with the tough job of try
ing to match last year’s best ever
squad, features a number of
bright prospects who more than
make up for the unbalance
caused by several weak events.
The Papoose tracksters, under
the guidance of Coach Jim Ter
rill, seem certain to break at
least five all-time Stanford frosh
records, including every running
event from 100 yards to 2 miles,
with the possible exception of the
880. Two of the marks have al
ready fallen by the wayside, with
only a week gone in the season.
IN THE SPRINTS, the Frosh
lack depth, but the one star they
have is outstanding. Larry Que
stad has already lowered the 220
mark, and the 100-yard record of
9.8 seconds, set by Bob Waters
in 1941. should he next. Quest ad
owns a best clocking of 9.6, and
last Saturday ran a 9.9 under loss
than perfect conditions. He needs
only a fast track and tough com
petition to push him to the rec

ord.
Tops in the quarter-mile is co
captain Bob Mclntyre, Oregon
champion in the event. Mclntyre
Saturday raced to 3rd place with
a 48.7 effort, half a second faster
than his previous best. Ho also
shone in the mile relay, bringing
the frosh from last place to a
temporary lead on his leg.
IN THE MILE and two-mile,
however, the records should take
the greatest beating. Harlan An
drews, co-captain from Oregon,
broke the mile record without
any fanfare in finishing right be
hind Robin Ruble in 4:14.5. Paul
Schlicke, Washington State
champ, was light behind in
4:19,6.

Two other top distance run
ners, Illinois champion Weym
Kirkland and Dave Stinebeck,
also from Illinois, have mile
limes of less than 4:20, hut will
concentrate on the two-mile.
Kirkland, Andrews, and Stine
beck all have two-mile limes
which better the existing mark
of 9:24.4.

ALL FOUR frosh distance men
were among ihe top five on the
varsity cross country team,
showing the great depth in these
events.
Among the field events, the
best should be the shot put. Jack
Chappie is the New Mexico cham
pion, while Lome Peterson set a
Canadian high school record last
year. Both have been around 51
feet in practice, and should chal
lenge Steve Arch’s 54’Vi” mark.
Hurdlers Phil Arnaudo, from
Mountain View, and Rick Scher-

or, from Long Beach, give the
frosh depth in this event. Arnau
do was right behind Steve Cort
right of the varsity in both of
Saturday’s races.
HIGH JUMPER Jay Marik is
consistently around 6T”. Russell
Peterson and Jim Tederman lop
the broad jumpers. The pole
vault is weak, as Doug Bruce,
while improving, has an all-time
best of 12 feet. Lome Peterson
tops the discus throwers, but all
of the javelin men are as yet un
tested.
Jim Johnson and Ron Kelly are
both around 1:58 in the 880,
though Andrews may move down
to strengthen the event.
' The frosh participate in two
meets this weekend, the first be
ing against Rcedley and Menlo
Colleges on Friday. On Saturday
the frosh participate in the San
Jose Relays. They look strong,
but, with rumors of another pow
erhouse at San Jose, they will
have to be.

Saturday raced to 3rd place with
a 48.7 effort, half a second faster
than his previous best. Ho also
shone in the mile relay, bringing
the frosh from last place to a
temporary lead on his leg.
IN THE MILE and two-mile,
however, the records should take
the greatest beating. Harlan An
drews, co-captain from Oregon,
broke the mile record without
any fanfare in finishing right be
hind Robin Ruble in 4:14.5. Paul
Schlicke, Washington State
champ, was light behind in
4:19,6.

Two other top distance run
ners, Illinois champion Weym
Kirkland and Dave Stinebeck,
also from Illinois, have mile
limes of less than 4:20, hut will
concentrate on the two-mile.
Kirkland, Andrews, and Stine
beck all have two-mile limes
which better the existing mark
of 9:24.4.

ALL FOUR frosh distance men
were among ihe top five on the
varsity cross country team,
showing the great depth in these
events.
Among the field events, the
best should be the shot put. Jack
Chappie is the New Mexico cham
pion, while Lome Peterson set a
Canadian high school record last
year. Both have been around 51
feet in practice, and should chal
lenge Steve Arch’s 54’Vi” mark.
Hurdlers Phil Arnaudo, from
Mountain View, and Rick Scher-

or, from Long Beach, give the
frosh depth in this event. Arnau
do was right behind Steve Cort
right of the varsity in both of
Saturday’s races.
HIGH JUMPER Jay Marik is
consistently around 6T”. Russell
Peterson and Jim Tederman lop
the broad jumpers. The pole
vault is weak, as Doug Bruce,
while improving, has an all-time
best of 12 feet. Lome Peterson
tops the discus throwers, but all
of the javelin men are as yet un
tested.
Jim Johnson and Ron Kelly are
both around 1:58 in the 880,
though Andrews may move down
to strengthen the event.

Leads the Frosh trackmen
Stanford’s frosh track team,
faced with the tough job of try
ing to match last year’s best ever
squad, features a number of
bright prospects who more than
make up for the unbalance
caused by several weak events.
The Papoose tracksters, under
the guidance of Coach Jim Ter
rill, seem certain to break at
least five all-time Stanford frosh
records, including every running
event from 100 yards to 2 miles,
with the possible exception of the
880. Two of the marks have al
ready fallen by the wayside, with
only a week gone in the season.
IN THE SPRINTS, the Frosh
lack depth, but the one star they
have is outstanding. Larry Que
stad has already lowered the 220
mark, and the 100-yard record of
9.8 seconds, set by Bob Waters
in 1941. should he next. Quest ad
owns a best clocking of 9.6, and
last Saturday ran a 9.9 under loss
than perfect conditions. He needs
only a fast track and tough com
petition to push him to the rec

ord.
Tops in the quarter-mile is co
captain Bob Mclntyre, Oregon
champion in the event. Mclntyre

Hurdlers Phil Arnaudo, from
Mountain View, and Rick Scher-

or, from Long Beach, give the
frosh depth in this event. Arnau
do was right behind Steve Cort
right of the varsity in both of
Saturday’s races.
HIGH JUMPER Jay Marik is
consistently around 6T”. Russell
Peterson and Jim Tederman lop
the broad jumpers. The pole
vault is weak, as Doug Bruce,
while improving, has an all-time
best of 12 feet. Lome Peterson
tops the discus throwers, but all
of the javelin men are as yet un
tested.
Jim Johnson and Ron Kelly are
both around 1:58 in the 880,
though Andrews may move down
to strengthen the event.
' The frosh participate in two
meets this weekend, the first be
ing against Rcedley and Menlo
Colleges on Friday. On Saturday
the frosh participate in the San
Jose Relays. They look strong,
but, with rumors of another pow
erhouse at San Jose, they will
have to be.
