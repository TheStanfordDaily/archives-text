# OUR MAN ON THE FARM

A gripe of mine is (he selection of teams for the NIT. The NIT
is a post-season basketball tournament, run, not in competition with
the NCAA playoffs, hut just as what it is, a tourney much like the
Los Angeles Classic, only run after the season is over, with the best
of the second place teams of various leagues in competition.
I DON’T KNOW HOW many West Coast teams have partici
pated in the NIT in the past ten years, but I would venture to say
that you could count them on the fingers of one hand.
In fact Seattle University may he the only Western team to go
to that tournament this decade. If the NIT is trying to have a repre
sentative tourney, they aren’t succeeding.
In practice, the NIT is like most all east coast athletics. The
West isn’t given recognition unless a great team comes along.
SUCH A GREAT TEAM was the Washington football squad that
dismantled Wisconsin and Minnesota in the Rose Bowl. Yet when
the Huskies polished off the Go
phers, who had been number one
in the U.S., they were no better
than fourth.

If you think this is leading up
to a plug for the Stanford basket
ball team you’re right.
Stanford is 18-6, including vic
tories over four service teams.
Included in this are wins over
Southern Cal twice after SC had
been second in the nation one
week, a victory over Santa Clara,
once up to fourteenth, and a cou
ple of very close losses to Oregon
Slate, a lop ten fixture until re
cently.
STANFORD is in the top ten
defensively, and averages close to
65 points a game.
It possesses good perimeter
shooting from John Windsor,
Hollis Moore, Darrell Sutherland
and Don and Doug Clemetson.
Tom Dose and Windsor are tough

close to the bucket, and Phil Kelly leads a deep Stanford bench.
Yet, this team, with a better won-loss record than many of the
teams in the press services’ top twenty, is unranked. Even after a
victory over USC last week, Stanford isn't in the top twenty.
THAT STANFORD WOULD be a good bet for the NIT is ob
vious to any team that has faced Stanford this year. What do the
Indians have to do to convince the NIT committee?
No Big Five rule prevents Stanford from going to post-season
basketball tournaments.
Coach Howie Dallmar and the team can not be blamed for
feeling a trifle frustrated. Here’s hoping they take their frustrations
out on UCLA and USC this weekend in an all-out attempt to get the
national recognition they deserve.
