# Balanced Golfers Loom Title Threat
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
A well-balanced golf team will
represent Stanford in intercol
legiate competition this year.
Coach Bud Finger says that
there is no star, just a great
many golfers with enough skill
to give any college golf team in
the country trouble.
TOP GOLFER is expected to be
Pete Choate, who was AAWU
champ in 1960, but sat out last
season’s competition. Coach Fin
ger says he has as much ability
as any man who ever picked up a
club.
The next two men seem of
about equal ability at this point.
Bill Farrish and Jeff Johnson
are neck and neck with Choate
to be first through third on the
ladder of the top eight.
Farrish is especially rugged in
match play. The hours that John
son practices could be expected to
bite into his GPA, but that they
don’t is evidenced by his almost
straight A average.
THERE IS A succession of
good players after the top three.
Pete James, also a good stu
dent, rates high, as do Bill Se
chrest and Hugh Skinner.
A golfer who is ineligible be
cause of the transfer rule is Jim
Langley, who came to Stanford
from Dartmouth. He will be able
to compete spring quarter.
Jerry Hanweck and Kim Cor
bin are up from the frosh team,
A LETTERMAN from last
year,, Dave Munro, hasn’t gotten
info shape yet, but when he does
will doubtless see action.
Bill Welch, who was figured
for around third or fourth man.
died in an auto accident during

Christmas vacation, and another
well-regarded golfer, Ralph Mar
ron, is in a hip to ankle cast as
a result of a toboggan accident
during Christmas vacation.
STANFORD’S FIRST test is
this weekend, with matches to
morrow and Saturday. Tomor
row, Stanford opposes San Fran
cisco State and Los Angeles State
at 1 p.m. on the Stanford course.
Saturday, the opponent is the
Stanford alumni team, same time,
same place.
