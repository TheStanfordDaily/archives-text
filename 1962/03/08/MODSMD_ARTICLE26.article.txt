# FIRST LOSS FOR CARDS
## Scrappy New Zealand Ruggers Power Past Stanford, 29-9 
### ART ROBINSON 
The touring New Zealand Uni
versities (cam more Ilian lived up
to its advance notices in handing
Stanford’s previously undefeated
ruggers their first loss of the sea
son by a whopping big 29-9 score
on the Card rugby filed yesterday.
The battling Tribe was in the
contest until the last 15 minutes
of the game when the offensively

minded visitors quickly ran up 15
points to seal the Indians’ doom.
STANFORD KAO the score
knotted at 6-fi at the halfway
mark, but wilted under the con
stant pressure of the New Zea
landers in the second halt.
Leading the way for the New
Zealand triumph was fullback
Mick Williment, who scored a
total of 17 points on three penalty

I kicks and four conversions.
The unerring Williment had a
perfect day kicking-wise, not mis
! sing a single boot he attempted.
I Besides his point-making, the big
New Zealander played a near per
| feet game at fullback, constantly
putting the Indians into trouble
i with his long punts into touch and
[coming up from his defensive posi
tion to put the New Zealand of
fense into high gear on occasion.

STANFORD STARTED out sur
i prisingly well, when Stan Lind-
I skog’s 35 yeard penalty kick mid
way through the first half sent
the Cards into an early 3-0 lead.
When the visitors quickly re
taliated with two penalty kicks
j of their own, both by Williment,
i the Indians went back to work for
1 the equalizing score.
Lindskog booted a long 40 yard
penalty kick perfectly through the
uprights, after expertly gauging
i a strong cross wind that would
| have foiled most kickers.
THE SCORK STOOD until half
time, and as the teams came off
the field for the intermission, the
audience cheered a possible upset
I in the making.
, But it was not to ho. Only a
minute into the second period.
I Williment added his third penalty
kick in three tries. The score
' stood at 9-H for the visitors.
, Then five minutes later, a New
i Zealand pop kick bounced wrong
l for the Indians and the visitors’
Peter Bark, playing hieakaway,
I grabbed the ball out of the air.
BARK FLEW down the field
but was caught just before cross
ing the goal. However, the New
Zealand captain, Kelvin Tremain,
was there and took the short toss
and set the ball down for a try.
Williment’s conversion w'as good
and the Indians’ cause seemed
lost.
A third of the way through the
contest. Stanford got back a try
when John Butler dashed across
the goal after the Indians tried
a quick lineout. The conversion
attempt was no good as the ball
fell down before Lindskog could
kick it.
At this point the New Zealand
team sewed up the match for
good. With the slickest bunch of
backs the Farm has seen in a
good many years, the visitors
roared down the field practically
at will.
That the Indian ruggers were
tired and slowed down consider
ably by the fast pace of the game
j was evident. It will probably be
! a long time before the Cards ah-
I sorb another loss like this one.
