## 
### 
USC, seeking its second national
swimming crown in three years,
threatens to run away with the
A.A.W.U. championships held at
Stanford today through Saturday.
The Indians and Washington are
expected to fight it out for second
behind the powerful Trojans.

The Trojans are led by Olym
pian Murray Rose, who holds the
fastest conference qualifying
limes in the 440-yard freestyle, the
1500-meter freestyle, and the 220-
yard freestyle. In one of Rose’s
events, the 1500-meter freestyle,
USC has the five fastest qualify

ing times: Rose, 17:49.1, Brian
Foss, 17:55.8, Dennis Rounsavelie,
18:28.1, Hal Coulslon, 18:34,1, and
John House, 18:304)

In other events, the Trojans are
also superior. Rounsevelle and
Coulston are one-two in the 200
yard individual medley. Foss,
Dennis Devine of USC, and Roun
sevelle are the fastest in the 200
yard butterfly. Bobby Moulton of
USC has a two second edge on
Stanford’s Tom Redfern in the
200-yard backstroke. Rose and
Coulston are one-three in the 220-
yard freestyle with Bobby Cries
ser holding the fastest time by
far in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Griesser and Moulton hold the
fastest times in the 100-yard
breaststroke and 100-yard back
stroke, and in the 440-yard free
style USC monopolizes the top
four times: Rose, House, Foss,
and Rounsavelle.
Stanford bases most of its sec
ond place hopes on the perform
ances of Pete Pettigrew and Tom
Redfern, two-three in the 200-yard
backstroke, and two and five in
the 100-yard backstroke. Booth
Hartley has the fastest time in the

100-yard butterfly, a half second
better than USC’s Mike Mealiffe,
and Steve Hull is second to J. D.
Brown of Washington in the 100-
yard freestyle. Brown, a double
winner last year, has the fastest
times in both the 100- and 50-yard
freestyle. Stanford also runs be
hind USC in the 400-yard medley
relay, with the Trojans’ 3:48.8
fastest by far in the conference.
The frosh yesterday swept a tri
angular meet with the San Jose
frosh and San Jose City Club, the
frosh beating San Jose 63-29 ami
the city club, 68-21.
Illka Suvanto paced the frosh
attack, picking up two wins, the
440-yard freestyle and the 200-yard
butterfly. Dave Gildea took the
200-yard breaststroke and Mike
Doscher won the 200-yard free
style. Varsity swimmer Steve
Hull's younger brother Marty took
another Stanford first, winning
the 200-yard individual medley in
a quick 2:10.9.
San Jose’s frosh did produce one
surprise, Nick Schoenmann. He
swept both the 100 and 50-yard
freestyles in 49.2 and 21.9, respec
tively.


MIKE LEDGERWOOD has earned a reputation as the best second
string center on the Coast. He's called the Whale by his team mates
and Ledge by Everyone else. He is a graduating Senior, with two
games this weekend against UCLA and USC, his last for Stanford.
