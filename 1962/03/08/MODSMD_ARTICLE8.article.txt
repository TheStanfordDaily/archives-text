# Help Needed Now For Spring Show
## 
### 
Tom Cruse, Technical Director
for Ram’s Head’s 1962 Spring
Show. “Oh Captain!” has issued
a plea for technical help on the
show.

“The show is going to be ex
tremely elaborate from the tech
nical point of view, so we will
need at least fifty people to work
on set construction and painting.
No experience is necessary; you
don't have to be a carpenter or an
art major. We’ll also need some
girls to setw costumes.”

Any students interested in earn
ing an activity credit by working
on “Oh Captain!” may sign up
this week in the Ram’s Head Of
fice in the Old Union Building. The
work will not start until the first
week of Spring Quarter.
