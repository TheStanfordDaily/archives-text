THE GRASS IS ALWAYS COLDER
The academic world, as we all know, is loaded with dignity and
ethics, with lofty means and exalted ends, with truth and beauty.
In such a world a heinous thing like faculty raiding—colleges en
ticing teachers away from other colleges—is not even thinkable.
However, if the dean of one college happens—purely by
chance, mind you—to run into a professor from another college,
and the professor happens to remark—just in passing, mind you
—that he is discontented with his present position, why, what’s
wrong with the dean making the professor an offer? Like the
other afternoon, for instance, Dean Sigafoos of (Transmire
Polytech, finding himself in need of a refreshing cup of oolong,
dropped in quite by chance at the Discontented Professors
Exchange where he discovered Professor Stuneros from the
English Department of Kroveny A and M sitting over a jx)t of
lapsang soochong and shrieking “I Hate Kroveny A and M!”
Surely there was nothing improper in the dean saying to the
professor, “Leander, perhaps you’d like to come over to us. I
think you’ll find our shop A-OK.”
(It should lx* noted here that all English professors are named
Leander, just as all psychics professors are named Fred. All
sociology professors are, of course, named Myron, all veterinary
medicine professors are named Rover, and all German professors
are named Hansel and Gretel. All deans, are, of course, named
Attila.)
Hut I digress. Leander, the professor, has just been offered a
job by Attila, the dean, and he replies, “Thank you, but 1
don’t think so.”
“And I don’t blame you,” says Attila, stoutly. “I under
stand Kroveny has a fine little library.”
“Well, it’s not too bad,” says Leander. “We have 28 volumes
in all, including a mint copy of Xnncy Drew, dirt Detective."
“V ery impressive,” says Attila. “Us now, we have 30 million
volumes, including all of Shakespeare’s first folios and the I )ead
Sea Scrolls.”
“Golly whiskers,” says Leander.
“But of course,” says Attila, “you don’t want to leave
Kroveny where, I am told, working conditions arc tickety-boo,”
“Oh, they’re not too bad,” says leander. “I teach 18 hours
of English, 11 hours of optometry, 6 hours of forestry, coach the
fencing team, and walk Proxy's cat twice a day.”
“A full, rich life,” says Attila. “At our school you’d be some
what less active. You’d teach one class a week, limited to four A
students. As to salary-, you’d start at *50,000 a year, witti
retirement at full pay upon reaching age 29.”

“Sir,” says leander, “your offer is most fair but you must
understand that I owe a certain loyalty to Kroveny.”
“I not only understand, I applaud,” says Attila. “Hut before
you make a final decision, let me tell you one thing more. We
supply Marlboro cigarettes to our faculty—all you want at all
times.”
“Gloryosky!” cries Leander, bounding to his feet. “You mean
Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste—
Marlboro, the cigarette with lictter makin’s —Marlboro that
comes to you in pack or box—Marlboro that gives you such a
lot to like?”
“Yep,” says Attila, “that’s the Marlboro I mean.”
“I am yours,” cries Leander, wringing the Dean’s hand.
“Where do I sign?”
“At the quarry,” replies Attila, “Frankly, we don’t trust
pa|)er contracts any more. We chisel them in marble.”

Stonecutters cut it in stone, woodcutters cut it in wood,
seamstresses embroider it in doilies: you gel a lot to like
in a Marlboro — filter, flavor, pack or box.

stand Kroveny has a fine little library.”
“Well, it’s not too bad,” says Leander. “We have 28 volumes
in all, including a mint copy of Xnncy Drew, dirt Detective."
“V ery impressive,” says Attila. “Us now, we have 30 million
volumes, including all of Shakespeare’s first folios and the I )ead
Sea Scrolls.”
“Golly whiskers,” says Leander.
“But of course,” says Attila, “you don’t want to leave
Kroveny where, I am told, working conditions arc tickety-boo,”
“Oh, they’re not too bad,” says leander. “I teach 18 hours
of English, 11 hours of optometry, 6 hours of forestry, coach the
fencing team, and walk Proxy's cat twice a day.”
“A full, rich life,” says Attila. “At our school you’d be some
what less active. You’d teach one class a week, limited to four A
students. As to salary-, you’d start at *50,000 a year, witti
retirement at full pay upon reaching age 29.”

“Sir,” says leander, “your offer is most fair but you must
understand that I owe a certain loyalty to Kroveny.”
“I not only understand, I applaud,” says Attila. “Hut before
you make a final decision, let me tell you one thing more. We
supply Marlboro cigarettes to our faculty—all you want at all
times.”
“Gloryosky!” cries Leander, bounding to his feet. “You mean
Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste—
Marlboro, the cigarette with lictter makin’s —Marlboro that
comes to you in pack or box—Marlboro that gives you such a
lot to like?”
“Yep,” says Attila, “that’s the Marlboro I mean.”
“I am yours,” cries Leander, wringing the Dean’s hand.
“Where do I sign?”
“At the quarry,” replies Attila, “Frankly, we don’t trust
pa|)er contracts any more. We chisel them in marble.”

THE GRASS IS ALWAYS COLDER
The academic world, as we all know, is loaded with dignity and
ethics, with lofty means and exalted ends, with truth and beauty.
In such a world a heinous thing like faculty raiding—colleges en
ticing teachers away from other colleges—is not even thinkable.
However, if the dean of one college happens—purely by
chance, mind you—to run into a professor from another college,
and the professor happens to remark—just in passing, mind you
—that he is discontented with his present position, why, what’s
wrong with the dean making the professor an offer? Like the
other afternoon, for instance, Dean Sigafoos of (Transmire
Polytech, finding himself in need of a refreshing cup of oolong,
dropped in quite by chance at the Discontented Professors
Exchange where he discovered Professor Stuneros from the
English Department of Kroveny A and M sitting over a jx)t of
lapsang soochong and shrieking “I Hate Kroveny A and M!”
Surely there was nothing improper in the dean saying to the
professor, “Leander, perhaps you’d like to come over to us. I
think you’ll find our shop A-OK.”
(It should lx* noted here that all English professors are named
Leander, just as all psychics professors are named Fred. All
sociology professors are, of course, named Myron, all veterinary
medicine professors are named Rover, and all German professors
are named Hansel and Gretel. All deans, are, of course, named
Attila.)
Hut I digress. Leander, the professor, has just been offered a
job by Attila, the dean, and he replies, “Thank you, but 1
don’t think so.”
“And I don’t blame you,” says Attila, stoutly. “I under

THE GRASS IS ALWAYS COLDER
The academic world, as we all know, is loaded with dignity and
ethics, with lofty means and exalted ends, with truth and beauty.
In such a world a heinous thing like faculty raiding—colleges en
ticing teachers away from other colleges—is not even thinkable.
However, if the dean of one college happens—purely by
chance, mind you—to run into a professor from another college,
and the professor happens to remark—just in passing, mind you
—that he is discontented with his present position, why, what’s
wrong with the dean making the professor an offer? Like the
other afternoon, for instance, Dean Sigafoos of (Transmire
Polytech, finding himself in need of a refreshing cup of oolong,
dropped in quite by chance at the Discontented Professors
Exchange where he discovered Professor Stuneros from the
English Department of Kroveny A and M sitting over a jx)t of
lapsang soochong and shrieking “I Hate Kroveny A and M!”
Surely there was nothing improper in the dean saying to the
professor, “Leander, perhaps you’d like to come over to us. I
think you’ll find our shop A-OK.”
(It should lx* noted here that all English professors are named
Leander, just as all psychics professors are named Fred. All
sociology professors are, of course, named Myron, all veterinary
medicine professors are named Rover, and all German professors
are named Hansel and Gretel. All deans, are, of course, named
Attila.)
Hut I digress. Leander, the professor, has just been offered a
job by Attila, the dean, and he replies, “Thank you, but 1
don’t think so.”
“And I don’t blame you,” says Attila, stoutly. “I under
stand Kroveny has a fine little library.”
“Well, it’s not too bad,” says Leander. “We have 28 volumes
in all, including a mint copy of Xnncy Drew, dirt Detective."
“V ery impressive,” says Attila. “Us now, we have 30 million
volumes, including all of Shakespeare’s first folios and the I )ead
Sea Scrolls.”
“Golly whiskers,” says Leander.
“But of course,” says Attila, “you don’t want to leave
Kroveny where, I am told, working conditions arc tickety-boo,”
“Oh, they’re not too bad,” says leander. “I teach 18 hours
of English, 11 hours of optometry, 6 hours of forestry, coach the
fencing team, and walk Proxy's cat twice a day.”
“A full, rich life,” says Attila. “At our school you’d be some
what less active. You’d teach one class a week, limited to four A
students. As to salary-, you’d start at *50,000 a year, witti
retirement at full pay upon reaching age 29.”

“Sir,” says leander, “your offer is most fair but you must
understand that I owe a certain loyalty to Kroveny.”
“I not only understand, I applaud,” says Attila. “Hut before
you make a final decision, let me tell you one thing more. We
supply Marlboro cigarettes to our faculty—all you want at all
times.”
“Gloryosky!” cries Leander, bounding to his feet. “You mean
Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste—
Marlboro, the cigarette with lictter makin’s —Marlboro that
comes to you in pack or box—Marlboro that gives you such a
lot to like?”
“Yep,” says Attila, “that’s the Marlboro I mean.”
“I am yours,” cries Leander, wringing the Dean’s hand.
“Where do I sign?”
“At the quarry,” replies Attila, “Frankly, we don’t trust
pa|)er contracts any more. We chisel them in marble.”

Stonecutters cut it in stone, woodcutters cut it in wood,
seamstresses embroider it in doilies: you gel a lot to like
in a Marlboro — filter, flavor, pack or box.
