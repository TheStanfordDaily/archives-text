LOS ANGELES (UPII “I
thought it was very dangerous to
have neighbors spying upon
neighbors with untrained people.”
That was why Helen Wysong,
an Alhambra real estate woman,
said she reported a secret meet
ing to establish a network of in
formants to the FBI.
Mrs. Wysong said she was in
vited to attend a meeting Sept. 15,
1961, in a minister's homo by Dr.
Robert Lord, minister of the
Church of Faith.
She understood the group would
act as informants for the Cali
fornia National Guard Reserve.
“I was told it was to he a volun
teer anti-Communist organization
to be on the lookout for subver
sive activities and to report
them.” Mrs. Wysong said.
“We were told we were to have
some training and that we were
to be brought into the armory
and taught to use firearms.”
“We were sworn in under the
National Guard oath.” she said.
Mrs. Wysong said as far as she
knew the Sept. 15 meeting was
the only gathering of the organi
zation.
“At least it was the only one I
was told about.”
After Mrs. Wysong’s story was
revealed, Maj. Dana Robert
Backus, commander of the Ist
Battalion of the California Na
tional Guard Reserve, confirmed
he had atempted to construct an
informants’ network. Backus
denied it was to be a civilian
affiliate of the guard.
The purpose of the group “was
to find a group of individuals
strategically placed in industry
and elsewhere who might have
access to certain bits of informa
tion that would aid the military
in performing its work in case of
disaster,” Said Backus.
He stressed that organization
of the group was on his own and
that superiors wore not consult
ed.
Mrs. Wysong said she thought

the group hoped to find key per
sonnel in business and industry
out -“had not succeeded.”

“The few persons I saw didn’t
appear to bo community leaders,”
said Mrs. Wysong.
