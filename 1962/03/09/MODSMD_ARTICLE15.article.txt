# 120-Man LASSU Proposed by Sayler
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
Every living group would elect
a representative to a greatly ex
panded legislature under the new
constitution, according to a plan
suggested by ASSU President
Bob Sayler at last night’s LASSU
meeting.
Sayler, describing the idea as
“the most radical innovation in
the new constitution,” said it
would have obvious disadvan
tages in decision making, but that
it is vital to make the student
legislature represent the student
body.
“LASSU at present represents
only a clique, and misses 95 per
cent of the student body.” he de
clared. “We are not doing any
thing that is leally respected by
the students or the administra
tion.” ,

LASSU IS a great education
for participants, but a failure as
a representative, communicating
body, Sayler maintained. It is re
spected by neither the students
nor the administration, he said.
The new system would provide
for good communication with the
students and encourage people
to run who would not face an all
campus election, Sayler hoped.
A powerful speaker would be
necessary to keep order in the
120-135-member legislature Say
ler said, but claimed larger na
tional and high school legisla
tures work effectively. He felt
this could be helped by wide use
of sub-committees and use of a
cabinet system.
LASSU received the plan in a
wait-an-see manner. A number of
questions were raised:
• How would electoins be con
trolled to prevent, for example,
an off-campus fraternity member
from voting for both his frater
nity and off campus representa
tives?
• How would one allow for
differences in sizes of living
groups, ranging from 25 in Roble
corridors to 90 in four Stern and
the eight Wilbur houses?
• How would the graduate stu
dent vote, 41 per cent of the stu
dent body, be apportioned, as
many representatives said there
is little interest or organization
among grad students.
SAYLER termed these only
technical problems to be solved
later and asked the representa
tives to think over and discuss
the idea itself. He said he had al
ready discussed it with several
deans, President Wallace Ster
ling and several representatives.
This matter, and the entire con
stitution, will be thrashed out in
a meeting April 4. Sayler prom
ised to keep LASSU in session
that night until the constitution
is completed.
In other action last night, the
AWS By-Laws were certified to
be technically correct by Jock
Mcßaine, and AWS President Lin
da Gogins stated the changes
were necessary for AWS “to be
more than a cabinet, to I’epresont
women on campus.” The by-laws
were unanimously approved.
McBAINE recommended re
jecting the Jordan house consti
tution on two grounds. The con
stitution had no provision lor
extra-house approval of constitu
tional amendments, and it placed
sole control of funds in the house
hands; both practices are con
trary to ASSU policy. The consti
tution was tabled.
