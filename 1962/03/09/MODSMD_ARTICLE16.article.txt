# The
						YAF's Logical Method of Attack
## 
### 
The Young Americans for Freedom, a national conservative
organization, held a rally in Madison Square Carden in New York
this week, It wasn’t as good as it was supposed to he hut it still
had plenty to recommend it.
Invited to the rally as honored guest was Moise Tshomhe,
leader of Katanga Province and a newly-discovered darling of
American conservatives. The State Department, however, wouldn’t
let Tshomhe into the country. No honored guest.
Also invited were Herbert Hoover (he didn’t come), Thomas
Dodd (neither did he), John Dos Passes (how the mighty have
fallen) and Barry Goldwater (he came).
After Coldwater said we should try to heat Communism, a
major address was given hy L. Brent Hozell, an editor of The
National Review who reportedly is the only man alive who has
hosted William F. Buckley, the conservatives’ master logician,
in dehate.
Bozell said, “To the Joint Chiefs of Staff: prepare for an im
mediate landing in Havana. To the commander in Berlin: tear
down the wall. To our chief of mission in the Congo: change sides.
To the chief of the CIA: you are to encourage liberation move
ments in every nation of the world under Communist domination,
including the Soviet Union itself.”
Logical plan of attack, conservative style. The next time some
body tells you that it’s the liberals who are leading ns down the
path toward war, ask him if he’s been to Madison Square Garden
lately.
