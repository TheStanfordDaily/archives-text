Why did the Communists
choose to fence in East Berlin?
This strange and unexpected out
come of the Berlin crisis reveals
a great deal about Communist
intentions and, I believe, allows
optimistic predictions about the
future of Berlin.
Most Western observers were
bewildered by the Communists’
choice of tactics; building that
wall was a move so defensive,
so defeatist, so utterly embar
rassing, that practically no one
had anticipated it. Both Christian
Herter and Theodore Achilles,
when they visited Stanford last
month, admitted that the State
Department had not considered
such a wall even a remote possi
bility.
WE WERE well prepared for
another blockade, or for troop
movements against West Berlin;
these ■ tactics would have been
well suited to aggressive designs
against West Berlin itself. But
surely the choice of the wall-tac
tic reveals that the single, over
riding reason for the whole Ber
lin crisis was the flow of refugees
through this hole in the iron cur
tain. The “thorn in Khrushchev’s
side” was not so much the physi
cal presence of West Berlin as
the loss of nearly a quarter of
East Germany’s population.
Nor was it a question of propa
ganda; the wall is more damag
ing propaganda-wise than the
refugees themselves. It was cer
tainly the economic damage of
the refugee flow which caused
the crisis.
THIS ECONOMIC damage was
enormous. The Communists have
lost about three and a half mil
lion citizens through Berlin
since 1949, half of whom were
“youth” under 25 years old. In

dustrial workers, trained tech
nicians, administrators, artists,
lawyers; the most valuable mem
bers of society were rapidly
leaving, causing a severe man
power shortage in East Germany.
And no end was in sight.
This situation simply could not
go on if East Germany was to
survive. Sooner or later, the
Communists had to cut off the
flight. They could have solved
the problem by seizing West Ber
lin but, like most rational people,
they wanted to minimize risks,
and building the wall was the
safest way to accomplish the un
pleasant necessity. It was a con
servative action, not an aggres
sive one.
AMERICAN POLICY toward
the wall was thoroughly sound.
If we had sent in tanks and bull
dozers, as some have suggested,
we might have won a temporary
victory. But in the long run we
would have forced the Commu
nists to more violent measures
against the refugee flow, mean
ing probably military seizure of
West Berlin, even at the risk of
nuclear war.
By remaining “hard” on the
rights of West Berlin and “soft”
on Communist action toward
East Berlin, we maintained peace
and encouraged the Communists
to choose this conservative, em
barrassing solution to their prob
lem.
Because the refugee flow has
almost stopped, and because the
West remained firm on West
Berlin rights, I consider Berlin
far more stable now than before
the wall. Peaceful coexistence in
the sense of harmony and broth
erhood between East and West
has failed indeed, but in its place
we have another kind of peaceful
coexistence, the kind which comes
from a healthy, rational under
standing of your neighbor’s mo
tives and interests without too
close a contact. In Robert Frost’s
words, “good fences make good
neighbors.”
