FALLACIOUS
Editor, The Daily:
As editors, you have the re
sponsibility of approving the ar
ticles printed in The Daily. We
find it hard to believe that you
would use your positions to ap
prove a personal grudge.
However, the front page of yes
terday’s Daily, usually reserved
for objective, constructive news,
was used as a medium to present
Mr. Padulo’s grudge against Sue
Davidson.
The reporter who wrote this
article was also responsible for
writing the fallacious, mislead
ing caption under a picture of
Miss Davidson and Bob Philibo
sian printed in The Daily after a
Legislature discussion on coed
housing. It is significant that the
reporter is a resident of Stern
and that Mr. Padulo is his R.A.
Did anyone on the editorial
staff read and approve this ar
ticle? If so, is it new policy that
personal antagonism be promoted
from the “Letters to the Editors”
to the front page, giving editorial
sanction to such bad taste?
If the article was not approved,
how did it appear in The Daily?
The Daily owes Miss Davidson
an explanation and an apology.
