DECEIT
Editor, The Daily;
The arguments used by Rus
sian geologists in discussing vari
ous questions reported in the ar
ticle by Prof. Konrad B. Kraus
kopf in the Winter 1991 issue of
Stanford Today are the very
same standard arguments I heard
again and again from communist
functionaries at (he University of
Vilnius (Lithuania) where I was
teaching mathematics from 1940
til 1944. Such propaganda materi
al issued by the Central Com
mittee of the Communist Party
was regularly distributed to the
faculty for usage in classroom
and on other occasions.
During those years I had plen
ty of opportunity to see ‘free
elections’ and witness many an
action of a totalitarian dictator
ship. Life under Communism
was a nightmare indeed. I fled

the country during the German
retreat in 1944.
The chances for a non-commu
nist to flee Russia today are the
very same as for a prisoner to es
cape from Alcatraz. Even for a
communist it is not easy to defect.
If after rigid screening he suc
ceeds in getting a passport for
travel abroad ho has to think of
his family which is held responsi
ble for his ‘treason’ and many
other things.
If there had been more ‘Berlin
openings’ and a country willing
to accept refugees the perform
ance of East Germans could have
been repeated.
The article of Dr. Klochko (see
Week Magazine for Jan. 21, 1962
or the article by Mr. C. Setbacks
in the Stanford Daily Jan. 25),
the recent communist defector,
describes exactly the feelings of
the majority of the former fac

ulty of the University of Vilnius
of 1941. The facts of the article
agree with information received
recently from people who after
Khrushchev’s visit to the U.S.A.
were permitted to join their fam
ilies abroad.
Russian propaganda tries hard
to make people believe that after
Stalin’s death the situation in
Russia has been considerably im
proved. Of course, there have
been slight changes, for example,
the anecdotes told by Dr. Kloch
ko differ slightly from the popu
lar anecdotes of 1941, and today
one has not to leap to his feet
when at a faculty meeting Sta
lin’s name is mentioned. How
ever, there have been no essential
changes in aims and methods.
If one takes into account that
scientists in Russia belong to a
privileged class of people, defec
tion of a communist points to
weak spots of a dictatorship.
However, it would be naive to as
sume that as time goes on people,
without help from outside, would
get rid of this tyranny.
Having had no experience or
deeper insight into the true na
ture of communism, a Westerner
cannot grasp frightening reports
of life under a communist regime.
Furthermore, he does not know
that there is nothing left to
chance in Russia when the visit
or is a distinguished scientist
from a great university. Years
ago Russians used to impress
foreign visitors by showing them
especially built collective farms.
Today they still are masters in
deceit.

UTILIZE
Editor, The Daily:

The gist of Professor Stokes’
argument for the establishment
of the semester system at Stan
ford is that ‘‘under the semester
system, a student could stay a
little longer with a subject, learn
more about it, have time to im
prove himself with less haste,
write a solid examination and be
judged with more consideration.”
As a graduate student who has
studied under both the semester
and quarter systems, I feel that
while each system has certain
points in its favor, overall the
quarter system is at least equally
as conducive to learning and is
definitely more flexible to the
needs of the many typos of
courses that are given in a major
university.
Professor Stokes’ assertion
that moi’c time is available under
the semester system for study of
a given course does not hold
water.
If a student is likely to learn
moi’e from a 14-week course than
one lasting 10 weeks, then so will
he learn more from a 20-week
(two-quarter) course than from a
14-weck semester course. The
j professor’s complaint that Har
vax-d’s English Constitutional
History course lasts a full school
j year while Stanford’s equivalent
j is given in a single quarter is not
an indictment of the quarter sys
tem itself but a (probably valid)
I criticism of Stanford’s scheduling
j of that particular course in only
one quarter. It could just as easi
ly be given as a lull-year course
| under the quarter system.
The same is true of any course,
I but under the quarter system a
j university can choose between
j devoting one, two, or three quar
j ters to a course; under the se
i mester system the choice is re
stricted to either a semester or a
I full year. Adequate time caxx be
j allocated for leading periods and
examinations in either case.
I There are many courses which
can be taught quite successfully
| in one quarter; there are others
for which two quarters would be
I ideal. I would agxee that Stan

tor'd probably compresses too
many courses into one quarter
that could better be given in two.
(A full-year course obviously is
equally compatible with either
system.)
But the point here is that Stan
ford could better improve its aca
demic pxogxam by more fully
utilizing the potentialities of the
quarter system than by junking
it in favor of the less flexible
semester system.

ACADEMIC FREEDOM
Editor, The Daily:
One heai-s much about aca
demic freedom these days the
right to teach beliefs, however'
controversial, and the right to
hear all sides of the question
from anyone. With regard to this
sort of academic freedom, Stan
ford has a good record.
However', our university has
just witnessed a serious viola
tion of academic freedom of an
other kind: the student’s freedom
to be able to select courses from
a wide range of disciplines and
to obtain as diversified and thor
ough a preparation for' future
life and chosen profession as he
deems beneficial and necessary.
Specifically, this second violation
of academic freedom is the Uni
versity's decision to abolish the
Geography Department.
The assumption underlying the
University’s decision is that Stan
ford students are to have no say
whatsoever in what courses they
may or may not be offered. Anri
it is this assumption which is

dangerous.
A dangerous precedent has
been set; a form of academic free
dom has been violated in a most
cavalier manner (remarks about
‘‘the way Harvard does it” have
no relevance to the question of
geography at Stanford), and an
important, vital, and very essen
tial discipline has been abruptly
thrown onto the scrap heap.
It is, annoyingly, too late now
for student action to save the
Geography Department as a sep
arate academic entity. The most
that undergraduates, graduates,
and faculty can hope for is to
save the majority of presently
offered geography courses by de
manding (and seeing to it that

their demand be met i that such
courses be included as a subdi
vision under the jurisdiction of
one of the other Social Science
departments.
To see to it that the University
does this, 1 suggest that a com
mittee, including undergrads,
grads and faculty, be set up im
mediately to begin exerting pres
sure on the University. This is
one area of American life where
“student protest” should, must,
and CAN be effective. For how
can a University justify vast
plans for physical improvement,
gargantuan efforts at fund-rais
ing, and, in (he same breath, mas
sive academic cut-backs?
