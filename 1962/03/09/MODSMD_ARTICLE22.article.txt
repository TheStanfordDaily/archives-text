# THE 						TWO ALLIANCES
## Walter Lippmann 
### 
For the time being the pending
negotiations on Berlin, a nuclear
test ban, and disarmament, are
stalled. There is little immediate
prospect of a useful result. Al
most certainly this is due to the
fact that there exists a nuclear
stalemate and that within that
stalemate neither of the two
great alliances has been able to
agree within itself on a negoti
ating position. Both alliances are
stalled by their internal conflicts
and controversies.

It may well be that Mr. Khrush
chev’s insistence on meeting Mr.
Kennedy face to face derives
from the wishful idea that if the
two chiefs of the two superpow
ers could talk to each other, they
could make a deal which would
submerge the discords in their
alliances. Such a deal is, of

course, out of the question. For
while Mr. Khrushchev might con
ceivably override his Chinese
ally, Mr. Kennedy will not and
cannot proceed without the ad
vice and consent of his allies.
Mr. Kennedy is in some respects
the leader but in no respect is he
the master of the Western world.
THKRK MUST he no illusions
about this. It is for us a fixed
point of vital interest and of
honor. But it follows that we
shall be living in a time of pause,
when the problems within each
alliance will come ahead of the
international policy of the alli
ance. Experienced observers, who
watch these things closely, are
agreed that hesitation and un
certainty pervade Soviet foreign
policy at the moment, and that
Moscow does not know how far
it dares to go forward toward
agreements with the West, and
how far it must go back into a
rough rivalry.
It may be, as Mr. Alsop has
been suggesting, that the Com
munist world is on the eve of a
showdown. In the next few days
there will be Communist meet
ings in Moscow and in Peiping,
and there are indeed many signs
that they will be concerned with
the high policy of the Communist
movement.

THERE IS nothing we can do
about this internal Communist
controversy except to keep our
eyes and ears open and our
mouths shut. In the meantime we
need to address ourselves to the
problems of the Western alli
ance.

In view of what is possible, in
deed within our reach, the pros
pects of the West are extremely
good. Wo are already in Ihe
midst of intense and elaborate
negotiations which are designed
to bring together in one great
trading area and in a closer po
litical partnership Western Eu
rope. the United States, the Com
monwealth, Latin America, much
of Africa, and Japan. If this
great project can be carried out,
we shall have secured firmly a
favorable balance of power be
tween the Communist world and
our own.
There is reason for hoping that
by the end of the summer Great
Britain will have joined the Eu
ropean Economic Community,
and that serious negotiations for
an association with it will have
begun for the West European
neutrals and for the United
States.
BUT VVE cannot be sure that

the great project will be carried
out. For the leading West Euro
pean powers, France and the Ger
man Federal Republic, and in a
measure also Great Britain, are
each, for different reasons, near
ing the end of a regime and in
deed a political era. There are as
yet no clear signs of what is to
follow.

If all goes as well as it can go,
the Algerian war will he formally
terminated. Presumably, the
French government will be so
firm that the settlement agreed
to will he accepted hy the Euro
pean colony in Algeria without
a major rebellion. But after that
or indeed along with it there will
arise the exceedingly difficult
problem of restoring some kind
of parliamentary government to
replace the personal aulhoritari
anism of Gen. de Gaulle. Many
combinations are conceivable and
many are rumored. We shall see
anxious days in France, and our
alliance with her may remain for
some time to come in its present
state of uncomfortable uncom
municativeness.

GREAT changes are impend
ing in West Germany. The old
Chancellor is not growing strong
er- or younger and with his pow
ers failing, if a successor were
clearly in sight, the change would
not be long in coming. As it is, it
will not be easy to govern Ger
many with so much uncertainty
about the future.

Great Britain is moving to
wards a general election, and in
foreign policy no country, as we
ourselves know only too well, is at
its best and strongest and clear
est in an election year. Great
Britain, moreover, is in the last
and most difficult stage of the
liquidation of empire. This is the
stage, which France is passing
through in Algeria, where there
is a substantial colonial settle
ment of Europeans who are
faced with the prospect of being
ruled by an overwhelming native
majority. Until the British find a
solution in the Central African
Federation, they will not be able
to play the part the world needs
to have them play in the under
developed territories.

ALGERIA and the British set
tlements in central Africa are the
two most important remnants of
empire held by any Western
great power. There are, of course,
Angola and Ruanda-Urundi but
neither Portugal nor Belgium is
a great power.
Our best role in the difficult
final stages of liquidation is to
help the French and the British
to work out the transitional solu
tion to which both are now com
mitted. We should avoid anything
which would put us in the role of
trying to hasten a process of
liberation which will turn out
best if it is carried forward slow
ly, with magnanimity and delib
eration.

If all goes as well as it can go,

terminated. Presumably, the

GREAT changes are impend
ing in West Germany. The old
Chancellor is not growing strong

Great Britain is moving to

foreign policy no country, as we
ourselves know only too well, is at
its best and strongest and clear
est in an election year. Great
Britain, moreover, is in the last
and most difficult stage of the
liquidation of empire. This is the
stage, which France is passing
through in Algeria, where there
is a substantial colonial settle
ment of Europeans who are
faced with the prospect of being
ruled by an overwhelming native

solution in the Central African
Federation, they will not be able
to play the part the world needs
to have them play in the under
developed territories.

ALGERIA and the British set
tlements in central Africa are the
two most important remnants of
empire held by any Western
great power. There are, of course,
Angola and Ruanda-Urundi but
neither Portugal nor Belgium is
a great power.
Our best role in the difficult
final stages of liquidation is to
help the French and the British
to work out the transitional solu
tion to which both are now com
mitted. We should avoid anything
which would put us in the role of
trying to hasten a process of
liberation which will turn out
best if it is carried forward slow
ly, with magnanimity and delib

For the time being the pending
negotiations on Berlin, a nuclear
test ban, and disarmament, are
stalled. There is little immediate
prospect of a useful result. Al
most certainly this is due to the
fact that there exists a nuclear
stalemate and that within that
stalemate neither of the two
great alliances has been able to
agree within itself on a negoti
ating position. Both alliances are
stalled by their internal conflicts
and controversies.

It may well be that Mr. Khrush
chev’s insistence on meeting Mr.
Kennedy face to face derives
from the wishful idea that if the
two chiefs of the two superpow
ers could talk to each other, they
could make a deal which would
submerge the discords in their
alliances. Such a deal is, of

course, out of the question. For
while Mr. Khrushchev might con
ceivably override his Chinese
ally, Mr. Kennedy will not and
cannot proceed without the ad
vice and consent of his allies.
Mr. Kennedy is in some respects
the leader but in no respect is he
the master of the Western world.
THKRK MUST he no illusions
about this. It is for us a fixed
point of vital interest and of
honor. But it follows that we
shall be living in a time of pause,
when the problems within each
alliance will come ahead of the
international policy of the alli
ance. Experienced observers, who
watch these things closely, are
agreed that hesitation and un
certainty pervade Soviet foreign
policy at the moment, and that
Moscow does not know how far
it dares to go forward toward
agreements with the West, and
how far it must go back into a
rough rivalry.
It may be, as Mr. Alsop has
been suggesting, that the Com
munist world is on the eve of a
showdown. In the next few days
there will be Communist meet
ings in Moscow and in Peiping,
and there are indeed many signs
that they will be concerned with
the high policy of the Communist
movement.

THERE IS nothing we can do
about this internal Communist
controversy except to keep our
eyes and ears open and our
mouths shut. In the meantime we
need to address ourselves to the
problems of the Western alli
ance.

In view of what is possible, in
deed within our reach, the pros
pects of the West are extremely
good. Wo are already in Ihe
midst of intense and elaborate
negotiations which are designed
to bring together in one great
trading area and in a closer po
litical partnership Western Eu
rope. the United States, the Com
monwealth, Latin America, much
of Africa, and Japan. If this
great project can be carried out,
we shall have secured firmly a
favorable balance of power be
tween the Communist world and
our own.
There is reason for hoping that
by the end of the summer Great
Britain will have joined the Eu
ropean Economic Community,
and that serious negotiations for
an association with it will have
begun for the West European
neutrals and for the United
States.
BUT VVE cannot be sure that

the great project will be carried
out. For the leading West Euro
pean powers, France and the Ger
man Federal Republic, and in a
measure also Great Britain, are

submerge the discords in their
alliances. Such a deal is, of

course, out of the question. For
while Mr. Khrushchev might con
ceivably override his Chinese
ally, Mr. Kennedy will not and
cannot proceed without the ad
vice and consent of his allies.
Mr. Kennedy is in some respects
the leader but in no respect is he
the master of the Western world.
THKRK MUST he no illusions
about this. It is for us a fixed
point of vital interest and of
honor. But it follows that we
shall be living in a time of pause,
when the problems within each
alliance will come ahead of the
international policy of the alli
ance. Experienced observers, who
watch these things closely, are
agreed that hesitation and un
certainty pervade Soviet foreign
policy at the moment, and that
Moscow does not know how far
it dares to go forward toward
agreements with the West, and
how far it must go back into a
rough rivalry.
It may be, as Mr. Alsop has
been suggesting, that the Com
munist world is on the eve of a
showdown. In the next few days
there will be Communist meet
ings in Moscow and in Peiping,
and there are indeed many signs
that they will be concerned with
the high policy of the Communist
movement.

THERE IS nothing we can do
about this internal Communist
controversy except to keep our
eyes and ears open and our
mouths shut. In the meantime we
need to address ourselves to the
problems of the Western alli
ance.

In view of what is possible, in
deed within our reach, the pros
pects of the West are extremely
good. Wo are already in Ihe
midst of intense and elaborate
negotiations which are designed
to bring together in one great
trading area and in a closer po
litical partnership Western Eu
rope. the United States, the Com
monwealth, Latin America, much
of Africa, and Japan. If this
great project can be carried out,
we shall have secured firmly a
favorable balance of power be
tween the Communist world and
our own.
There is reason for hoping that
by the end of the summer Great
Britain will have joined the Eu
ropean Economic Community,
and that serious negotiations for
an association with it will have
begun for the West European
neutrals and for the United
States.
BUT VVE cannot be sure that

the great project will be carried
out. For the leading West Euro
pean powers, France and the Ger
man Federal Republic, and in a
measure also Great Britain, are
each, for different reasons, near
ing the end of a regime and in
deed a political era. There are as
yet no clear signs of what is to
follow.

If all goes as well as it can go,
the Algerian war will he formally
terminated. Presumably, the
French government will be so
firm that the settlement agreed
to will he accepted hy the Euro
pean colony in Algeria without
a major rebellion. But after that
or indeed along with it there will
arise the exceedingly difficult
problem of restoring some kind
of parliamentary government to
replace the personal aulhoritari
anism of Gen. de Gaulle. Many
combinations are conceivable and
many are rumored. We shall see
anxious days in France, and our
alliance with her may remain for
some time to come in its present
state of uncomfortable uncom
municativeness.

GREAT changes are impend
ing in West Germany. The old
Chancellor is not growing strong
er- or younger and with his pow
ers failing, if a successor were
clearly in sight, the change would
not be long in coming. As it is, it
will not be easy to govern Ger
many with so much uncertainty
about the future.

Great Britain is moving to
wards a general election, and in
foreign policy no country, as we
ourselves know only too well, is at
its best and strongest and clear
est in an election year. Great
Britain, moreover, is in the last
and most difficult stage of the
liquidation of empire. This is the
stage, which France is passing
through in Algeria, where there
is a substantial colonial settle
ment of Europeans who are
faced with the prospect of being
ruled by an overwhelming native
majority. Until the British find a
solution in the Central African
Federation, they will not be able
to play the part the world needs
to have them play in the under
developed territories.

ALGERIA and the British set
tlements in central Africa are the
two most important remnants of
empire held by any Western
great power. There are, of course,
Angola and Ruanda-Urundi but
neither Portugal nor Belgium is
a great power.
Our best role in the difficult
final stages of liquidation is to
help the French and the British
to work out the transitional solu
tion to which both are now com
mitted. We should avoid anything
which would put us in the role of
trying to hasten a process of
liberation which will turn out
best if it is carried forward slow
ly, with magnanimity and delib
eration.

For the time being the pending

prospect of a useful result. Al
most certainly this is due to the

alliance with her may remain for
some time to come in its present
state of uncomfortable uncom
municativeness.

GREAT changes are impend
ing in West Germany. The old
Chancellor is not growing strong
er- or younger and with his pow
ers failing, if a successor were
clearly in sight, the change would
not be long in coming. As it is, it
will not be easy to govern Ger
many with so much uncertainty
about the future.

Great Britain is moving to
wards a general election, and in
foreign policy no country, as we
ourselves know only too well, is at
its best and strongest and clear
est in an election year. Great
Britain, moreover, is in the last
and most difficult stage of the
liquidation of empire. This is the
stage, which France is passing
through in Algeria, where there
is a substantial colonial settle
ment of Europeans who are
faced with the prospect of being
ruled by an overwhelming native
majority. Until the British find a
solution in the Central African
Federation, they will not be able
to play the part the world needs
to have them play in the under
developed territories.

ALGERIA and the British set
tlements in central Africa are the
two most important remnants of
empire held by any Western
great power. There are, of course,
Angola and Ruanda-Urundi but
neither Portugal nor Belgium is
a great power.
Our best role in the difficult
final stages of liquidation is to
help the French and the British
to work out the transitional solu
tion to which both are now com
mitted. We should avoid anything
which would put us in the role of
trying to hasten a process of
liberation which will turn out
best if it is carried forward slow
ly, with magnanimity and delib
eration.
