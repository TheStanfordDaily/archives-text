# CONCERT REVIEW
## Folk Singer Pete Seeger Gets Standing, Cheering Ovation 
### 
An amazing thing happened in
Memorial Auditorium Wednes
day night.
After folk singer Peter Seeger
had sung five encores, they
turned on the house lights. But
the audience, which by long ex
perience had been conditioned to
head for the exits when this hap
pens, instead stood in their places
and cheered.

After a time Seeger wandered
back onto the stage, gave a boy
ish grin, and raised his hands
trying to quiet the audience.
Then he made a graceful little
speech of gratitude and walked
off the stage. Only then did peo
ple realize the concert was over
and start going home.
Seeger sang bits and pieces of
everything; old songs and new,
American and foreign, serious
and funny, children’s songs and
some a little more adult and of
war and of peace. Interspersed
with this was the accompaniment
on the banjo as only Seeger plays
it and the 12-string guitar.
From a recent trip to England
and Scotland, Seeger has added a
few modern songs of protest to his
repertoire. One was an exchange
between a Scottish policeman and
the picketer of an American nu
clear submarine which was using
Scotland as a base. Another was
called “You Cannot Spend a Dol
lar When You’re Dead” and, goes
to the tune of “She’ll Be Coming
Round the Mountain.”

On almost every song part of
the audience joined in. It's almost
become a measure of status in
folk audiences to know all the
words to all the songs. But the
most successful of those songs in
which Seeger made an especial
point of audience participation,
were “We Shall Overcome,” an
old hymn which is now the theme
song of the Southern sit-in move
ment, and “Wimoweh.” Nobody
is better at relaxing an audience
and making it sing than Seeger,

and he got the crowd singing four
different parts on “Wimoweh”
while he sang the high narrative
part.
Of the several songs of peace
he sang perhaps the prettiest was
one called “The Flowers of
Peace” which he bet the audience
it hadn’t heard before. He un
doubtedly wrote it.
Seeger seems to he going in
much more for songs that every
body can sing at least parts of
these days and, as a result, those
who have come to hear the latest
parody on (he John Birch Soci
ety or Sen. Thurmond are disap
pointed. On the other hand, no
matter what he sang there would
be disgruntled elements in the
audience who could claim that he
had left out some standard “See
ger” songs. They’d be right.
There are just too many of them.

An amazing thing happened in
Memorial Auditorium Wednes
day night.
After folk singer Peter Seeger
had sung five encores, they
turned on the house lights. But
the audience, which by long ex
perience had been conditioned to
head for the exits when this hap
pens, instead stood in their places
and cheered.

After a time Seeger wandered
back onto the stage, gave a boy
ish grin, and raised his hands
trying to quiet the audience.
Then he made a graceful little
speech of gratitude and walked
off the stage. Only then did peo
ple realize the concert was over
and start going home.
Seeger sang bits and pieces of
everything; old songs and new,
American and foreign, serious
and funny, children’s songs and
some a little more adult and of
war and of peace. Interspersed
with this was the accompaniment
on the banjo as only Seeger plays
it and the 12-string guitar.
From a recent trip to England
and Scotland, Seeger has added a
few modern songs of protest to his
repertoire. One was an exchange
between a Scottish policeman and
the picketer of an American nu
clear submarine which was using
Scotland as a base. Another was
called “You Cannot Spend a Dol
lar When You’re Dead” and, goes
to the tune of “She’ll Be Coming
Round the Mountain.”

On almost every song part of
the audience joined in. It's almost
become a measure of status in
folk audiences to know all the
words to all the songs. But the
most successful of those songs in
which Seeger made an especial
point of audience participation,
were “We Shall Overcome,” an
old hymn which is now the theme
song of the Southern sit-in move
ment, and “Wimoweh.” Nobody
is better at relaxing an audience
and making it sing than Seeger,

and he got the crowd singing four
different parts on “Wimoweh”
while he sang the high narrative
part.
Of the several songs of peace
he sang perhaps the prettiest was
one called “The Flowers of
Peace” which he bet the audience
it hadn’t heard before. He un
doubtedly wrote it.
Seeger seems to he going in
much more for songs that every
body can sing at least parts of
these days and, as a result, those
who have come to hear the latest
parody on (he John Birch Soci
ety or Sen. Thurmond are disap
pointed. On the other hand, no
