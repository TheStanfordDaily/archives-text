COMPLACENCY
Editor, The Daily:
A letter printed in a recent
Daily contained the statement:
“As long as no one is offended,
why shouldn’t the groups be al
lowed to create an atmosphere in
which any kind of behavior is
tolerated?”
If this is the prevalent attitude
on this campus, then let the Fun
damental Standard at Stanford
be abolished! The purpose of the
Fundamental Stanford is not to
enforce the minimum rules nec
essary to ensure every person’s
well-being, but to instill in every
individual the authentic desire to
be responsible for his own acts.
Or perhaps, since everything
is taken care of for us in Ameri
ca, we should sit back compla
cently and take it easy, and allow
others to assume our responsi
bility, our maturity, our minds,
our way of life.

DISTURBANCE
Editor, The Daily:
The noise accompanying con
struction opposite Engineering
Corner is of such volume and
duration as to make effective in
struction impossible. On many
occasions since the beginning of
winter quarter, I have been un
able to hear a lecturer (in Room
268) despite sitting in the front
of the classroom.
At the risk of seeming to be
Eastern-snobbish, I shall describe
a similar incident which occurred
at Harvard in 1958. A senior (not
myself), writing his honors the
sis, found himself unable to study
in his dormitory due to the noise
accompanying construction of a
garage for faculty cars. He com
plained in a letter to the Crim
son, and construction thenceforth
was completed at a slower—and
quieter—pace.

The current disturbance at En-1
gineering Corner seems to me to
be an indication of the adminis
tration’s concern for the physical |

I growth of Stanford University at
I the expense of its intellectual ex
cellence.
