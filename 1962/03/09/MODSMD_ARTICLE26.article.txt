## 
### 
By GLENN ALFORD
Stanford (18-(B will close out its
most successful basketball season
in many a moon tonight and to
morrow against USC and UCLA.
Stanford takes on the Bruins to
night and USC tomorrow, in the
Pavilion, with the tip-off sched
uled for 8 p.m.
The Indians will be in top physi
cal shape, with all the walking
wounded and ill returned to ac
tion.
GUARD DOUG Clemelson, out
for exactly a month, has recovered
sufficiently from a broken meta
tarsal to have the cast removed
to enable him to play. This will
help the Cards immensely, as
guards Darrel Sutherland and Don
Clemetson have been forced to go
almost the entire game.
Last week, when Stanford nosed
out USC til the wire, Phil Kelly
played an outstanding game as a
guard in relief for the two start
ers, but he is needed at forward.
Kelly and Tom Dose, who were
both supposed to be sick last
weekend and see little action were
the ones who did the most damage
to the Trojans, and both are now
fully recovered from the flu.
STANFORD COACH Howie
Dalmar will start Hollis Moore
and John Windsor at forwards,

Dose at center, and Don Clemet
son and Sutherland at guards.
In the event that Doug Clemet
son foot doesn't come around,
Fred Pegelow and Kelly can sub
at guard. Mike Ledgerwood and
Boh Sommers are other members
of strong Stanford bench strength.
This weekend will mark the
close of the collegiate careers of
seniors Windsor and Kelly, the co
captains of the basketball team,
and Pegelow 7 and Ledgerwood.
THE BRUINS and Trojans
should come out with the same
lineups that they used all year,
with varying success.
UCLA, w 7 ho flopped miserably
in the early going, should start
Garry Cunningham and Pete
Blackman at forwards, F re d
Slaughter at center and Johnny
Green and W a 11 Hazzard at
guards.
In case Bruin Coach John Wood
en wants to give the other Bruins
a chance, now that the crowm has
been clinched, others like Dave
Waxman and Rich Gugat at for
wards, Kim Stewart at center and
Bill Hicks, Jim Milhorn, Jim Ros
vall, Mike Huggins and Larry
Gower at guards will see action.
THE TROJANS, who fizzled
like a dead skyrocket after a
flashy beginning, should start

Gordie Martin and Ken Stanley at
forwards, John Rudometkin at
center, and Chris Appel and Neil
Edwards at guards.

Others who may play are for
wards Verne Ashby, Bill Parsons
and Ron Wey, centers Bob Bene
detti and Dan Weir, and guards
Wells Sloniger and Pete Hillman.
Stanford has a chance to clinch
second place in the AAUW. with
a win in either game, and actually
could end up only one game nut of
first place in the final learn stand
ings, providing Cal knocks off
UCLA, and Stanford wins both its
games.

An unlikely occurrance, but nice
to think of.

Senior Guard
