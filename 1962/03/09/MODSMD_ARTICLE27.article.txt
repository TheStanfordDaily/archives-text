# Frosh vs. JV's
## 
### 
The preliminary action before
this weekendâ€™s varsity basketball
tilts will be all in the family, as
the Stanford frosh and the Braves
meet twice. Game time will he
6:05 p.m. in the Pavilion both to
night and tomorrow.

Frosh Coach Bill Turner will
probably start the same crew that
upset Cal twice and then was
swamped by the San Francisco
Presidio and lost two close ones
to improved USF and Santa Clara
teams.

John Murray and Craig Cordes j
should split playing time at cen- ;
ter almost evenly. Forwards Jack 1
Gilbert, Bob Garner and Frank j
Olrieh should all play equal time
as forwards, and co-captains Rod
Young and Mike Priesler will start
as guards. Dick Ragsdale will be
the lop guard replacement.
The Braves have been crippled
by an injury to leading-scorer cen
ter A1 Simila, but have a capable
replacement in 6-7 Bernie Butcher.
Other starters are at forwards
Pete Rowe and Bruce Loughner,
and at guards Lew Shupe and
Paid Lindfors. The Braves have
strong guard subs in Bob Ewing
and Chuck Wilson.
