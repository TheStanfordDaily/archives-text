# Baseballers Play Two
## 
### 
Stanford will try to get back
on the winning ways on the dia
mond this weekend when the var
sity baseball team opposes Cal
Aggies and San Jose Slate.
Today’s game with the Cal Ag
gies is on the Sunken Diamond,
with game time 3 p.m., while to
morrow’s San Jose State game
is on the Spartan field at f p.m.
NOT MUCH IS known about
this year’s version of the Cal Ag
gies, except that they have a cou
ple of sophomores that Stanford
tried hard to get to play here.
Last year, Stanford defeated
the Aggies 8-3.
San Jose holds (he only victory
over Stanford this year, a 10-3
nightmare. Needless to say, Stan
ford will be out for revenge. The
loss left Stanford at 1-1 for the
season.
STANFORD BASEBALL Coach
Dutch Fehring will have right
handed hinders Pete Dixon and
John LeCompte pitch today, with

lefty Mark Miller ready for relief
duty.
Tomorrow, Jim Lonborg and
Jim Smith will share mound
chores, with Joe Schultz in the
bull pen. Lonborg pitched four
scoreless innings against San Jose
in the previous meeting, while
Smith was taken out in the first
inning after a combination of er
rors, cheap hits, and a couple of
solirl smashes rattled him.
If a right-hander throws for the
Spartans. Fehring will give John
Orchard his first start of the sea
son behind the plate, and Jim
Chenu will start his first game in
the outfield.
IF A LEFTV is hulling, Bob
Hensler will replace Chenu, and
Boh Overman will catch.
In any case, Jack Allen will play
first base; Skip Lawrence, second:
Rich Ferrazzano, third; and Joel
Shulman, shortstop. The other
outfielders will he Greg Post and
Tom May.
