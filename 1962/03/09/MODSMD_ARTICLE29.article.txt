# Indians Host San Jose, in Relays
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Stanford’s varsity tracksters
will meet San Jose State and
Occidental, while the frosh take
on San Jose State, tomorrow aft
ernoon in the Third Annual Stan
ford Invitational Track and Field
Relays, starting at 1:30 in the
Stadium,
The Indians should be able to
compete on equal terms with both
of their oopponents according to
Assistant Coach Jim Terrill. He
states that none of the events
should he run-aways. not even the
440-relay, traditionally a weak

event for Stanford and a strong |
one for San Jose.
THK TOP San Jose sprinter this
year, African Jimmy Omagbeni, |
is no Ray Norton; thus Terrill
says that if the Stanford sprinters
can execute some fast passes, they
will have a good chance.
Top events for the Cards should
include the Distance Medley, the
Two-Mile Relay, the Weightman’s i
Relay, and the Discus Throw. Six :
relays, two individual races, and j
six field events (on a three-man |
team basis) will count in the scor- I
ing.
Top individual attraction in the

meet figures to be all-around star
Dixon Farmer of Oxy, the Na
tional AAU 400 meter hurdles
champion. Farmer, is set to go
in four events; the Distance Med
ley, Shuttle Hurdles, Two-Miles
and Mile Relays.
OTHER OCCIDENTAL stand
outs include 9.3 sprinter Steve
Haas, fifth in the National AAU
220, and pole vaulter Dave Servis,
with an indoor best of 14’ 11'4”.
San Jose is led by Omagbemi,
a sophomore with 9.7 and 21 flat
clockings in (he 100 and 220 last
week, top 440-man Willie Wil
liams, and outstanding sophomore
miler Ben Tucker.
Dan Studney is a tower of
strength in the weight events,
throwing the javelin over 230 feet,
the discus more than 160, and also
an excellent shot putter. Jeff Fish
back, Spartan distance man. was
3rd in last fall’s NCAA Cross
Country championships.
Adding to the interest is the
fact that San Jose is out for re
venge against Occidental, having

lost to the Tigers in a triangular
meet at Stanford last year.
THE FROSH also meet Menlo
and Reedley junior colleges this
afternoon at 4:00, at Angell Field.
Farm track fans will get anoth
er chance to look at some of the
outstanding Stanford yearling, in
cluding sprinter Larry Questad,
quarter miler Bob Mclntyre, and
miler Harlan Andrews.
The three man discus team of
David Weill, Don Bell and Steve
Arch should turn in a top-flight
performance. Art Bat (holder,
Chuck Barth, and Stove Cortright
are consistently excellent.
BUT FOR MANY, the highlight
of the day will come in the
Weightman's Relay, a non-scoring
event. Arch, Batchelder, Weill,
and anchor-man Bell will be gun
ning for the unofficial world’s
record of 44.8, set by Stanford last
year. Last week the four were
times in 45.4 seconds for the 440
yards, an excellent time when one
considers that the varsity sprint
ers ran a 43.8.

meet figures to be all-around star
Dixon Farmer of Oxy, the Na
tional AAU 400 meter hurdles
champion. Farmer, is set to go
in four events; the Distance Med
ley, Shuttle Hurdles, Two-Miles
and Mile Relays.
OTHER OCCIDENTAL stand
outs include 9.3 sprinter Steve
Haas, fifth in the National AAU
220, and pole vaulter Dave Servis,
with an indoor best of 14’ 11'4”.
San Jose is led by Omagbemi,
a sophomore with 9.7 and 21 flat
clockings in (he 100 and 220 last
week, top 440-man Willie Wil
liams, and outstanding sophomore
miler Ben Tucker.
Dan Studney is a tower of
strength in the weight events,
throwing the javelin over 230 feet,
the discus more than 160, and also
an excellent shot putter. Jeff Fish
back, Spartan distance man. was
3rd in last fall’s NCAA Cross
Country championships.
Adding to the interest is the
fact that San Jose is out for re
venge against Occidental, having

lost to the Tigers in a triangular
meet at Stanford last year.
THE FROSH also meet Menlo
and Reedley junior colleges this
afternoon at 4:00, at Angell Field.
Farm track fans will get anoth
er chance to look at some of the
outstanding Stanford yearling, in
cluding sprinter Larry Questad,
quarter miler Bob Mclntyre, and
miler Harlan Andrews.
The three man discus team of
David Weill, Don Bell and Steve
Arch should turn in a top-flight
performance. Art Bat (holder,
Chuck Barth, and Stove Cortright
are consistently excellent.
BUT FOR MANY, the highlight
of the day will come in the
Weightman's Relay, a non-scoring
event. Arch, Batchelder, Weill,
and anchor-man Bell will be gun
ning for the unofficial world’s
record of 44.8, set by Stanford last
year. Last week the four were
times in 45.4 seconds for the 440
yards, an excellent time when one
considers that the varsity sprint
ers ran a 43.8.
Stanford’s varsity tracksters
will meet San Jose State and
Occidental, while the frosh take
on San Jose State, tomorrow aft
ernoon in the Third Annual Stan
ford Invitational Track and Field
Relays, starting at 1:30 in the
Stadium,
The Indians should be able to
compete on equal terms with both
of their oopponents according to
Assistant Coach Jim Terrill. He
states that none of the events
should he run-aways. not even the
440-relay, traditionally a weak

event for Stanford and a strong |
one for San Jose.
THK TOP San Jose sprinter this
year, African Jimmy Omagbeni, |
is no Ray Norton; thus Terrill
says that if the Stanford sprinters
can execute some fast passes, they
will have a good chance.
Top events for the Cards should
include the Distance Medley, the
Two-Mile Relay, the Weightman’s i
Relay, and the Discus Throw. Six :
relays, two individual races, and j
six field events (on a three-man |
team basis) will count in the scor- I
ing.
