### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) With
only four flays to go before their
foreign ministers meet Russiaâ€™s
Andrei Gromyko in Geneva Mon
day, the United States and Brit
ain yesterday were still trying to
align their own positions on a
nuclear test ban.
Officials said intensive U.S.-
British meetings going on here in
past days still had not completed
details of how the two allies will
approach the testing issue with
the Soviet.
Informed sources said chances
were remote that the two coun
tries would be able to lay a com
pleted, revised nuclear test ban
treaty before the Russians next
week, ready for signing.
Rather, they said, Secretary of
Slate Dean Rusk and British For
eign Secretary Lord Home, prob
ably will try to discuss with
Gromyko only in general terms
how such a treaty should be ne
gotiated later in the 18-nation
disarmament conference begin
ning in Geneva Wednesday.
Rusk, Home and Gromyko are
to begin separate conferences
Monday.
