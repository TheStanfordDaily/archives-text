ALGIERS (UPIi Right-wing
terrorists exploded I wo big bombs
inside the Oran fortress head
quarters of the regional army
corps yesterday 15 minutes after
French Defense Minister Pierre
Messmer was reported to have
arrived there.
Military sources said the bombs
caused considerable damage but
no injuries.
The explosions apparently were
caused by booby-trapped gasoline
barrels which blew up inside the
Vieux Chateau where the Oran
army corps has its headquarters.
THE TIMING of the explosions
at 7:15 p.m. was 15 minutes after
Messmer was reported unofficial
ly to have arrived there on a top
security tour of army command
headquarters in Algeria. But for
security reasons Messmer’s
movements were kept secret.
Messmer was understood to be
issuing orders to army command

ers for suppressing Secret Army
Organization (OAS) terrorist ac
tivities before and after the im
pending French-rebel cease-fire
is announced.
At Mascar, 13 miles outside
Oran, erroneous reports that a
Moslem mob had lynched a Jew
ish rabbi touched off rioting be
tween European Jews and Mos
lems.
THE BOMB attack on the Oran
headquarters came at the end of
a day in which terror attacks in
Algeria’s cities killed 12 persons
and wounded 39. It brought the
total since Jan. 1 to 1,487 killed
and 3,593 wounded.

In Bone, in eastern Algeria, the
local prefecture announced that
jot fighter planes and 826 bomb
ers wont into action during the
day against rebels who have been
'bombarding frontier villages
from Tunisia for the past three
nights.
The prefecture did not say the
planes were hitting targets in Tu
nisia, but an earlier army com
munique said none of the rebel
forces had crossed the electrified
barbed wire frontier barrier just
inside Algeria.
Meanwhile police were report
ed to be investigating the possi
bility that Secret Army Organi
zation (OAS) terrorists had
planned a new attack on the life
of President Charles de Gaulle
last Monday.
