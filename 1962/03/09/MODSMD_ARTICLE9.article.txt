“All people have the potential
to be creative,” said Professor
John Arnold at the Alpha Delta
Phi House last night.

Professor Arnold defines cre
ativity as not only thought on an
idea but also development of the
idea into a novel and tangible
result belter than any before
created. “Idea generation is not
creativity,” believes Arnold.

The curiosity and problem sen
sitivity of a child exemplify the
key to ci'eativity. An adult de
velops blocks which deter his
creativity; perceptual, emotional,
and cultural detriments are the
divisions Arnold chooses. The cre
ative person has the ability to re
move the blocks and attain a
flexibility and fluency in his
ideas. In order to perceive and
create in a complex society, the
artist must observe himself in
his surroundings not looking
through himself but at himself.
The ability and passionate de
sire to ask questions must be de
v e 1 op e d. “How?," “When?,”
“Where?,” the creative person is

always asking himself. The most
important question, much forgot
ten with age. is “If . . . ?”.
Imagination, calculation, and pos
sible failure all have to be re
alized in the creative process.
The creative person must be
trained intellectually and emo
tionally. A broad academic cur
riculum is best with high pre
cision developed in one field. It
is in correlating and interpreting
data in new ways, that we are
creative.

Flexibility is supremely impor
tant, and a broad educational
background helps prevent us
from becoming rigid and narrow.
