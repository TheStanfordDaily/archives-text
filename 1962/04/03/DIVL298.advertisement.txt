GO NEAR THE WATER. Spring is the time when students start thinking about
water fun. We say: Splash up a storm. Have a lark. But please be careful. Each
year, a few careless students get water on their Luckies. Imagine their remorse!
Imagine yours if you were to spoil a Lucky—that great cigarette that college
students smoke more of than any other regular. So have a swell time at your
favorite watering hole this spring. And keep your Luckies dry.
CHANGE TO LUCKIES and get some fosfe for a chonge!
