# Neutrals Press for Nuclear Test Ban
## 
### 
GENEVA (UPI )•—Non-aligned nations started pressuring East
and West yesterday to compromise on inspection and control of
a nuclear test ban treaty. Most of the pressure appeared to be
against the West.
Ethopia, Sweden, Indian and Burma called for a relaxation by

both sides of the rigid positions
which have kept the test ban
talks deadlocked for three and a
half years.
But it seemed they were asking
more of the United States and
Britain than of the Soviet Union.
All four said they thought the

United States would have to lower
its demands for international con
trols on Soviet territiory.
They gave the 17-nation disar
mament conference several sug
gestions for compromise but none
seemed to provide the ironclad
guarantees against cheating on
which the United States has in
sisted.
Nevertheless, the American
delegation treated the sugges
tions cautiously. A spokesman
said it was too early to comment
but “we know that spirit of com
promise in which they were of
fered, and they will be looked at
in tlie same spirit.’’
U.S, delegate Arthur H. Dean
renewed the United States offer
to call off its nuclear tests in the
atmosphere this month if the
Soviet will sign a treaty with “ob
jective and effective” controls.
But he said that in the light of
the series of Soviet nuclear tests
of last fall in violation of its own
moratorium pledge.
Soviet delegate Valerian Zorin,
in the sharpest speech he has
made since the conference open
ed, warned again that if the Unit
ed States goes through with its
tests “our own tests will surely
follow.”

Dean had challenged Zorin on
the fact that the Soviets, at one
point in the three-power Geneva
nuclear talks which now are in
recess, agreed to the principle of
international controls and then
reversed itself.
