# Physics Award Given to Flory
## 
### 
The first High-Polymer Physics
Prize of the American Physical
Society was awarded in Baltimore
to Stanford Physical Chemist
Prof. Paul J. Flory.
The $lOOO prize, to be given
annually “for outstanding accom
plishment and excellence of con
tributions to research in high
polymer physics,” is sponsored
by the Ford Motor Company.
It was the second major award
within a month for Flory, who
received the William H. Nichols
Medal of the American Chemical
Society on March 9. The Nichols
Medal is the ACS’s oldest award
for achievement, and one of the
highest awards in chemistry.
Flory is best known for his pi
oneer work in polymers, or giant
molecules, of such materials as
natural and synthetic rubber, fi
bers, and plastics. He originated
many of the statistical mathe
matical concepts now used in
polymer research by scientists
throughout the world.
