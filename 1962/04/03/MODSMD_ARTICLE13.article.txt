# Court Decision May Not Solve Problem
## 
### 
Tilt* Supreme's Court's decision last week in the Tennessee re
apportionment case is the most important ruling which that both
has made since the 195-1 school desegregation case. As in the school
decision, the Tennessee opinion will mark American life for a
long while.
The Tennessee decision is not, however, the end to the prob
lem. It rnereh gave it a new dimension. The 1 Court did not say
that tin* Tennessee voters w ho are not proportionally represented
in their state legislature are entitled to more equitable representa
tion. It did not order tin* Tennessee legislature or courts to redis
trict the states. It mereK said that voters should be allowed to
present their cases before a federal court. This, obviously, doesn’t
neeessarib correct the situation.
What will happen in Tennessee is that the voters will show the
injustices of the present situation and the court w ill say it is bad
and will direct someboib to fix it up. But the court will not say
how this is to be done. This, clearly, would be an infringement on
the legislative process. The case 1 will go back to the Tennessee
legislature which may or may not correct the situation, it mav
even make some kind of “token redistricting (a la the Southern
school boards) which might satisfy the court without solving the
problem. The case and others like it will quite likelv become a
sort ol judicial legislative volleyball being slapped back and forth
between the courts and the state legislature with little real remedv
forthcoming.
The important thing about the Tennessee decision is not that
the problem of unequal representation is going to be solved right
away, but rather that another recourse for those making an at
tempt to solve it has been opened. The possibility remains, how
ever, that this new recourse will prove as ineffective as all the old
ones have been.
