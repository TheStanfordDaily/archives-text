Two Women Guild (Menlo
Park*.
All you have to do is get Sophia
Loren out of Hollywood, give her
Vittorio De Siea for a director
and she becomes a fine actress.
Jean Paul Belmondo also gives a
good performance in this excel
lent movie based on a story by i
Alberto Moravia.

Saturday livening Post April T.
Yes. Virginia, there is indeed a
Scotty Thompson, and for life
sized (and eyebrow raising) proof
you need but turn to page 28. In
fpll detail are told Our Boy’s ex
ploits such as reorganizing Poli
Union and the fraternity system,
getting JFK’s endorsement for
President of the U.S., playing |
touch football and reluctantly |
charming two-doZen (count ’em) I
volunteer females. If the Cellar I
is sold out you might try the
Sigma Nu House. Or you could
come by and play darts with our
copy.
Saturday Review March 21.
John Ciardi, noted poet, critic
and until last June professor at
Rutgers, contends that deans are
"fungi” blighting American uni
versities and that faculties have
abdicated their responsibility by
letting these “ignorant” men de-j
termine educational policy.
He asserts that even if a “good”
man is promoted to dean at any i
university, his new job will con
dition him, that is make him ig
norant. Ciardi’s attack on the Ad
ministration should be seen in the
perspective of the long and glori
ous tradition of class warfare be
tween teachers and administra
tors.

The Play of the Week, Wed., S
p.m. (Channel 2).
A two-hour presentation of
Samuel Becket’s far-out “Waiting
for Godot” with Burgess Mere
dith is one of the best things this
always good show has done in a
while.
HOOKS
Among some new paperback
releases worth checking into are;
To Kill A Mockingbird, by Harper
Lee Popular Library, 60 cents.
A wondrous warmth (if not
corresponding depth) of charac
terization marks this splendid
first no\-el which is still on the
best seller lists a year and a half
after its release.
Therefore Be Bold, by Herbert
i Gold Lancer, 40 cents.
Adolescent boys who spend one
I half of their time quoting Thom
as Wolfe and Omar Khayyam and
the other half mooning over ado
lescent girls are given a touching
treatment in this slender volume.
Nobody writes quite the way
i Gold does.
The Jollity Building', by A. J.
Leibling Ballantine, 60 cents.
Old New Yorker profiles of the
con-men who used telephone
booths for offices and their wits
to stay alive make delightful
reading.
The Shark and the Sardines, by
Arevalo Lyle Stuart. $4.50.
One of the most controversial
publishers in America. Lyle Stu
art, offers a book billed as a
“bitter unmasking of the real
friendship between the United
States and the republics of Latin
America.” Recommended by the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
