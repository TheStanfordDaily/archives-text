The approach through the Ba
hia de Guananbara with the mag
nificent panorama of Rio is leg
endary and needs no qualifica
tion, but if the beauty and charm
of Rio are attributed solely to this
splendor, they remain transitory
and insignificant. Upon disem
barking the filth and heat, the
crowded streets and overfilled
buses, and the clattering mu
seum pieces, which serve as
streetcars, do their best to con
vince oik 1 that the view from the
harbor was merely a pleasant
dream.
This initial shock, however,
while disordering any naive pre
conceptions, does not negate
Rio’s attractiveness. The beauty
persists. For a time the essence
of this beauty remains vague,
and this absti useness is a stimu
lus to further investigation.
IT is appalling to walk from
the exclusive Copacabana to the
equally exclusive Flamenco area
and pass through an area of
slums or “Favellas,” sprawling
with prostitutes and beggars and
overrun by disease-carrying rats,
hungry dogs, and tropical insects
of every size* and description.
But that is all part of Rio. anti
one still cannot escape from the
impression that Rio is beautiful.
The equivocation of “beautiful”
and “interesting” does not arise,
as in Colombo or Hong Kong,
where the filth and insufferable
heat force a sane visitor to retire
to a quiet place and collect his
senses after a few preliminary
glances.
Even before the terrible odor !
of rotten fruit and uncleanliness, j
one does not feel obligated to
seek solace in an air-conditioned
bar. Rio is beautiful and charm
ing, and these qualities capture
tourists in a recondite fashion.
WHV? Rio’s abstruse beauty
emanates from her citizens. It is |
intrinsic and vital. Everybody in
Rio lives to the fullest extent
possible and enjoys living. In the
dreadful “Favellas,” groups of
doorless, windowless, mud-thatch
ed huts pasted to the rocky hills
in the middle of the city, children
laugh and play with incompar

able energy, children who have
never had a full stomach in then
life.
The street-car conductor, soak
ed in sweat and undoubtedly pre
occupied with the problems of
supporting his 13 odd children on
$3O a month, sings as he controls
the milling passengers with an
admirable courtesy. The female
population, those brown-skinned
beauties so wonderfully depicted
in the film "Orfeu Negro,” pa
rade through the streets in
dresses which they made them
selves out of a piece of cloth
costing no more than a few cents
and possess all the dignity and
poise of a European princess
combined with tlie supple move
ments of the sari-clad women in
New Delhi.
Rio smiles, and this smile
unites the erotic picturesqueness
of a. Paris park in the afternoon
with the boisterous friendliness
of an African city such as Khar
toum or Dares Salam.
I STOPPED at a small open
air music shop to buy some re
cordings of typical Brazilian
rhythms. Not being familiar with
the titles I asked the salesgirl to
play them for me. As soon as the
first notes echoed into the street,
a group of workers arose from
their siesta on the side-walk and
surrounded me. 1 felt as if the
famous “Carnevai” were in full
swing.
With tin helmets, hammers and
pliers they easily surpassed the
record with their interpretation.
The street was at once blocked
with dancing couples. Several po
licemen ran up from the right,
and I thought they w-ere going
to clear the street, but instead
they joined the dancers.
“Carnevai” occupies only a
small space in the tourist calen
dar but it is away of life in Rio.
Nevertheless, watching this
throng, many of whom had prob
ably not had the necessary three
cruzieros to buy the typical Bra
zilian lunch of black beans and
rice, it occurred to me that this
passionate joy in life has an
equally important reverse side.

THIS rambunctious happiness
seems closely related to resigna
tion and melancholia. Perhaps
the immeasurable vivacity is only
an escape mechanism, camouflag
ing the deeper emotions, tin* mel
ancholia resulting from poverty
and hunger.
Be that as it may, Rio’s beauty
and charm remain undistorted.
These qualities originate neither
in the architecture nor in the
marvelous landscape.
They emanate from a quiet tol
erance expressed in the unpreju
diced blending of racial, cultural
and environmental factors, and
from a hopeful smile, the smile
of Rio. which radiates through
the streets from the squalor of
(he “Favellas,” from the heart of
Rio.

intrinsic and vital. Everybody in
Rio lives to the fullest extent
possible and enjoys living. In the
dreadful “Favellas,” groups of
doorless, windowless, mud-thatch
ed huts pasted to the rocky hills
in the middle of the city, children
laugh and play with incompar

able energy, children who have
never had a full stomach in then
life.
The street-car conductor, soak
ed in sweat and undoubtedly pre
occupied with the problems of
supporting his 13 odd children on
$3O a month, sings as he controls
the milling passengers with an
admirable courtesy. The female
population, those brown-skinned
beauties so wonderfully depicted
in the film "Orfeu Negro,” pa
rade through the streets in
dresses which they made them
selves out of a piece of cloth
costing no more than a few cents
and possess all the dignity and
poise of a European princess
combined with tlie supple move
ments of the sari-clad women in
New Delhi.
Rio smiles, and this smile
unites the erotic picturesqueness
of a. Paris park in the afternoon
with the boisterous friendliness
of an African city such as Khar
toum or Dares Salam.
I STOPPED at a small open
air music shop to buy some re
cordings of typical Brazilian
rhythms. Not being familiar with
the titles I asked the salesgirl to
play them for me. As soon as the
first notes echoed into the street,
a group of workers arose from
their siesta on the side-walk and
surrounded me. 1 felt as if the
famous “Carnevai” were in full
swing.
With tin helmets, hammers and
pliers they easily surpassed the
record with their interpretation.
The street was at once blocked
with dancing couples. Several po
licemen ran up from the right,
and I thought they w-ere going
to clear the street, but instead
they joined the dancers.
“Carnevai” occupies only a
small space in the tourist calen
dar but it is away of life in Rio.
Nevertheless, watching this
throng, many of whom had prob
ably not had the necessary three
cruzieros to buy the typical Bra
zilian lunch of black beans and
rice, it occurred to me that this
passionate joy in life has an
equally important reverse side.

THIS rambunctious happiness
seems closely related to resigna
tion and melancholia. Perhaps
the immeasurable vivacity is only
an escape mechanism, camouflag
ing the deeper emotions, tin* mel
ancholia resulting from poverty
and hunger.
Be that as it may, Rio’s beauty
and charm remain undistorted.
These qualities originate neither
in the architecture nor in the
marvelous landscape.
They emanate from a quiet tol
erance expressed in the unpreju
diced blending of racial, cultural
and environmental factors, and
from a hopeful smile, the smile
of Rio. which radiates through
the streets from the squalor of
(he “Favellas,” from the heart of
Rio.

The approach through the Ba
hia de Guananbara with the mag
nificent panorama of Rio is leg
endary and needs no qualifica
tion, but if the beauty and charm
of Rio are attributed solely to this
splendor, they remain transitory
and insignificant. Upon disem
barking the filth and heat, the
crowded streets and overfilled
buses, and the clattering mu
seum pieces, which serve as
streetcars, do their best to con
vince oik 1 that the view from the
harbor was merely a pleasant
dream.
This initial shock, however,
while disordering any naive pre
conceptions, does not negate
Rio’s attractiveness. The beauty
persists. For a time the essence
of this beauty remains vague,
and this absti useness is a stimu
lus to further investigation.
IT is appalling to walk from
the exclusive Copacabana to the
equally exclusive Flamenco area
and pass through an area of
slums or “Favellas,” sprawling
with prostitutes and beggars and
overrun by disease-carrying rats,
hungry dogs, and tropical insects
of every size* and description.
But that is all part of Rio. anti
one still cannot escape from the
impression that Rio is beautiful.
The equivocation of “beautiful”
and “interesting” does not arise,
as in Colombo or Hong Kong,
where the filth and insufferable
heat force a sane visitor to retire
to a quiet place and collect his
senses after a few preliminary
glances.
Even before the terrible odor !
of rotten fruit and uncleanliness, j
one does not feel obligated to
seek solace in an air-conditioned
bar. Rio is beautiful and charm
ing, and these qualities capture
tourists in a recondite fashion.

throng, many of whom had prob
ably not had the necessary three
cruzieros to buy the typical Bra
zilian lunch of black beans and
rice, it occurred to me that this
passionate joy in life has an
equally important reverse side.

THIS rambunctious happiness
seems closely related to resigna
tion and melancholia. Perhaps
the immeasurable vivacity is only
an escape mechanism, camouflag
ing the deeper emotions, tin* mel
ancholia resulting from poverty

Be that as it may, Rio’s beauty

These qualities originate neither
in the architecture nor in the

from a hopeful smile, the smile
of Rio. which radiates through
the streets from the squalor of

The approach through the Ba
hia de Guananbara with the mag
nificent panorama of Rio is leg
endary and needs no qualifica
tion, but if the beauty and charm
of Rio are attributed solely to this
splendor, they remain transitory
and insignificant. Upon disem
barking the filth and heat, the
crowded streets and overfilled
buses, and the clattering mu
seum pieces, which serve as
streetcars, do their best to con
vince oik 1 that the view from the
harbor was merely a pleasant
dream.
This initial shock, however,
while disordering any naive pre
conceptions, does not negate
Rio’s attractiveness. The beauty
persists. For a time the essence
of this beauty remains vague,
and this absti useness is a stimu
lus to further investigation.
IT is appalling to walk from
the exclusive Copacabana to the
equally exclusive Flamenco area
and pass through an area of
slums or “Favellas,” sprawling
with prostitutes and beggars and
overrun by disease-carrying rats,
hungry dogs, and tropical insects
of every size* and description.
But that is all part of Rio. anti
one still cannot escape from the
impression that Rio is beautiful.
The equivocation of “beautiful”
and “interesting” does not arise,
as in Colombo or Hong Kong,
where the filth and insufferable
heat force a sane visitor to retire
to a quiet place and collect his
senses after a few preliminary
glances.
Even before the terrible odor !
of rotten fruit and uncleanliness, j
one does not feel obligated to
seek solace in an air-conditioned
bar. Rio is beautiful and charm
ing, and these qualities capture
tourists in a recondite fashion.
WHV? Rio’s abstruse beauty
emanates from her citizens. It is |
intrinsic and vital. Everybody in
Rio lives to the fullest extent
possible and enjoys living. In the
dreadful “Favellas,” groups of
doorless, windowless, mud-thatch
ed huts pasted to the rocky hills
in the middle of the city, children
laugh and play with incompar

able energy, children who have
never had a full stomach in then
life.
The street-car conductor, soak
ed in sweat and undoubtedly pre
occupied with the problems of
supporting his 13 odd children on
$3O a month, sings as he controls
the milling passengers with an
admirable courtesy. The female
population, those brown-skinned
beauties so wonderfully depicted
in the film "Orfeu Negro,” pa
rade through the streets in
dresses which they made them
selves out of a piece of cloth
costing no more than a few cents
and possess all the dignity and
poise of a European princess
combined with tlie supple move
ments of the sari-clad women in
New Delhi.
Rio smiles, and this smile
unites the erotic picturesqueness
of a. Paris park in the afternoon
with the boisterous friendliness
of an African city such as Khar
toum or Dares Salam.
I STOPPED at a small open
air music shop to buy some re
cordings of typical Brazilian
rhythms. Not being familiar with
the titles I asked the salesgirl to
play them for me. As soon as the
first notes echoed into the street,
a group of workers arose from
their siesta on the side-walk and
surrounded me. 1 felt as if the
famous “Carnevai” were in full
swing.
With tin helmets, hammers and
pliers they easily surpassed the
record with their interpretation.
The street was at once blocked
with dancing couples. Several po
licemen ran up from the right,
and I thought they w-ere going
to clear the street, but instead
they joined the dancers.
“Carnevai” occupies only a
small space in the tourist calen
dar but it is away of life in Rio.
