# TENNESSEE CASE
## Walter Lippmann 
### 
In his brilliant and moving dis
senting opinion Mr. Justice
Frankfurter called the decision of
the Supreme Court in the Tennes
see apportionment case “a mas
sive repudiation of the experience
of our whole past in asserting de
structively novel judicial power.”
Coming from him, the most learn
ed of the judges, and supported
by Mr. Justice Harlan with his
great legal wisdom, this strong
language is enough to give pause
not only to the layman but to the
judges who will for a long time to
come be working under this new
finding.
Being a layman myself, I find
it useful as a beginning to fix in
mind the facts of the case which
was started on its way to the Su
preme Court by a group of citi
zens of Tennessee. The heart of
the complaint was that the con
stitution of Tennessee has been
violated over a period of half a
century, and that they are unable
to obtain a lemedy from the Ten
nessee courts, the Tennessee leg
islature, or by an election under
the existing apportionment.
Till; CONSTITUTION of Ten
nessee says that there are to be
not more than 99 members of the
House of Representatives and 33
members of the Senate. The
General Assembly, which is the
name of the whole legislature, is
to allocate, at least every ten
years, the seats among the coun
ties or districts “according to the
number of qualified voters in
each.”
Although that is what the con
stitution says, there has been no
reapportionment since 1901. In
the intervening sixty years the
legislature has rejected all bills
to carry out the mandate of the
constitution requiring a realloca
tion every ten years. In Tennes
see only the General Assembly
oan pass the legislation to carry
out the law’ of the constitution.
But the legislature, as now con
stituted, will not pass these laws.
It nullifies the constitution, and
no majority of the voters in Ten
nessee can make it obey the con
stitution. Fifty representatives
elected by one-third of the voters
control the Lower House and if
there w’ere a reapportionment ac
cording to the Tennessee consti
tution, 17 out of those 50 would
lose their seats.
Inside of Tennessee there is no
remedy and the state is in the
grip of a self-perpetuating rural
minority. I

THIS SITUATION, which ox- 1
ists in several other states, means j
that there is no legal remedy for
a very serious wrong. It is a very
serious wrong that in the Ten
nessee Senate 20 out of 33 mem
bers are elected by 37 per cent
of the voters, and that in the
House of Representatives 63
members out of 99 are elected by |
40 per cent of the voters. It is a I
serious wrong because such a j
state legislature is not and can
not be sufficiently interested to
deal with the mounting problems
of the growing cities.
Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s com-1
ment on this crucial point is that j
“there is not under our const it u- j
lion a judicial remedy for every |
political mischief, for every un- j
desirable exercise of legislative I
power. The Framers carefully
and with deliberate forethought |
refused so to enthrone the judi
ciary. In this situation, as in |
others of like nature, appeal for
relief does not belong here (that
is, in the Supreme Court). Ap
peal must be to an informed, civ
ically militant electorate.”
If there is no judicial remedy i
for a serious wrong affecting the ]
welfare of the urban masses, and |
if, as is in fact (he case in Ten
nessee, relief cannot be had from j
the electorate, however informed
k 1,1 ■ n.1.1 .

and civically militant the major
ity may be, what happens then?
If all the doors are closed, how do
the city people of Tennessee get
relief? It is always a dangerous
situation when the doors are
closed against judicial or public
or political relief and against
peaceable change.
WHAT HAS actually happened
is that the six justices, the ma
jority of the court, have opened
a little the one door of Federal
judicial relief. They have opened
it only a crack at the moment
but there is no doubt that the
two dissenting justices are fully [
justified in warning the country j
that if the door is opened wide, j
the courts may become danger
ously involved in state politics j
all over the nation. This would
be an appalling thing to contem- j
plate, to have Federal judges
drawn into becoming the arbiters
of the political affairs of each |
state.
One must conclude, I think that
this “novel judicial power” will
be “destructive” or will not be [
destructive, depending upon the J
wisdom and restraint with which j
it is exercised. That, of course, is !
true of all power. But in such a I
novel power it is especially im
portant to be aware of it.
For the remedy is a highly
dangerous drug and it will have
to be administered most cautious- j
ly. That means, 1 think, that we
must not do again what was done
after the 1954 decision in the
school segregation case. We must
not leave the application of the
new rule to haphazard local law |
suits. There must be national j
leadership this time, and it should )
come from the President and I
from the Republican and Demo- |
cratic leaders. The burden of j
working out the strategy and the
tactics of the movement for fair
er and more realistic representa
tion should be on the politicians
and not on the judges.

serious wrong because such a j
state legislature is not and can
not be sufficiently interested to
deal with the mounting problems
of the growing cities.
Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s com-1
ment on this crucial point is that j
“there is not under our const it u- j
lion a judicial remedy for every |
political mischief, for every un- j
desirable exercise of legislative I
power. The Framers carefully
and with deliberate forethought |
refused so to enthrone the judi
ciary. In this situation, as in |
others of like nature, appeal for
relief does not belong here (that
is, in the Supreme Court). Ap
peal must be to an informed, civ
ically militant electorate.”

for a serious wrong affecting the ]
welfare of the urban masses, and |
if, as is in fact (he case in Ten
nessee, relief cannot be had from j
the electorate, however informed
k 1,1 ■ n.1.1 .

and civically militant the major
ity may be, what happens then?
If all the doors are closed, how do
the city people of Tennessee get
relief? It is always a dangerous
situation when the doors are
closed against judicial or public
or political relief and against
peaceable change.
WHAT HAS actually happened
is that the six justices, the ma
jority of the court, have opened
a little the one door of Federal
judicial relief. They have opened
it only a crack at the moment
but there is no doubt that the
two dissenting justices are fully [
justified in warning the country j
that if the door is opened wide, j
the courts may become danger
ously involved in state politics j
all over the nation. This would
be an appalling thing to contem- j
plate, to have Federal judges
drawn into becoming the arbiters
of the political affairs of each |
state.
One must conclude, I think that
this “novel judicial power” will
be “destructive” or will not be [
destructive, depending upon the J
wisdom and restraint with which j
it is exercised. That, of course, is !
true of all power. But in such a I
novel power it is especially im
portant to be aware of it.
For the remedy is a highly
dangerous drug and it will have
to be administered most cautious- j
ly. That means, 1 think, that we
must not do again what was done
after the 1954 decision in the
school segregation case. We must
not leave the application of the
new rule to haphazard local law |
suits. There must be national j
leadership this time, and it should )
come from the President and I
from the Republican and Demo- |
cratic leaders. The burden of j
working out the strategy and the
tactics of the movement for fair
er and more realistic representa
tion should be on the politicians

In his brilliant and moving dis
senting opinion Mr. Justice
Frankfurter called the decision of
the Supreme Court in the Tennes
see apportionment case “a mas
sive repudiation of the experience
of our whole past in asserting de
structively novel judicial power.”
Coming from him, the most learn
ed of the judges, and supported
by Mr. Justice Harlan with his
great legal wisdom, this strong
language is enough to give pause
not only to the layman but to the
judges who will for a long time to
come be working under this new
finding.
Being a layman myself, I find
it useful as a beginning to fix in
mind the facts of the case which
was started on its way to the Su
preme Court by a group of citi
zens of Tennessee. The heart of
the complaint was that the con
stitution of Tennessee has been
violated over a period of half a
century, and that they are unable
to obtain a lemedy from the Ten
nessee courts, the Tennessee leg
islature, or by an election under
the existing apportionment.
Till; CONSTITUTION of Ten
nessee says that there are to be
not more than 99 members of the
House of Representatives and 33
members of the Senate. The
General Assembly, which is the
name of the whole legislature, is
to allocate, at least every ten
years, the seats among the coun
ties or districts “according to the
number of qualified voters in
each.”
Although that is what the con
stitution says, there has been no
reapportionment since 1901. In
the intervening sixty years the
legislature has rejected all bills
to carry out the mandate of the
constitution requiring a realloca
tion every ten years. In Tennes
see only the General Assembly
oan pass the legislation to carry
out the law’ of the constitution.
But the legislature, as now con
stituted, will not pass these laws.
It nullifies the constitution, and
no majority of the voters in Ten
nessee can make it obey the con
stitution. Fifty representatives
elected by one-third of the voters
control the Lower House and if
there w’ere a reapportionment ac
cording to the Tennessee consti
tution, 17 out of those 50 would
lose their seats.
Inside of Tennessee there is no
remedy and the state is in the
grip of a self-perpetuating rural
minority. I

THIS SITUATION, which ox- 1
ists in several other states, means j
that there is no legal remedy for
a very serious wrong. It is a very
serious wrong that in the Ten
nessee Senate 20 out of 33 mem
bers are elected by 37 per cent
of the voters, and that in the
House of Representatives 63
members out of 99 are elected by |
40 per cent of the voters. It is a I

In his brilliant and moving dis
senting opinion Mr. Justice
Frankfurter called the decision of
the Supreme Court in the Tennes
see apportionment case “a mas
sive repudiation of the experience
of our whole past in asserting de
structively novel judicial power.”
Coming from him, the most learn
ed of the judges, and supported
by Mr. Justice Harlan with his
great legal wisdom, this strong
language is enough to give pause
not only to the layman but to the
judges who will for a long time to
come be working under this new
finding.
Being a layman myself, I find
it useful as a beginning to fix in
mind the facts of the case which
was started on its way to the Su
preme Court by a group of citi
zens of Tennessee. The heart of
the complaint was that the con
stitution of Tennessee has been
violated over a period of half a
century, and that they are unable
to obtain a lemedy from the Ten
nessee courts, the Tennessee leg
islature, or by an election under
the existing apportionment.
Till; CONSTITUTION of Ten
nessee says that there are to be
not more than 99 members of the
House of Representatives and 33
members of the Senate. The
General Assembly, which is the
name of the whole legislature, is
to allocate, at least every ten
years, the seats among the coun
ties or districts “according to the
number of qualified voters in
each.”
Although that is what the con
stitution says, there has been no
reapportionment since 1901. In
the intervening sixty years the
legislature has rejected all bills
to carry out the mandate of the
constitution requiring a realloca
tion every ten years. In Tennes
see only the General Assembly
oan pass the legislation to carry
out the law’ of the constitution.
But the legislature, as now con
stituted, will not pass these laws.
It nullifies the constitution, and
no majority of the voters in Ten
nessee can make it obey the con
stitution. Fifty representatives
elected by one-third of the voters
control the Lower House and if
there w’ere a reapportionment ac
cording to the Tennessee consti
tution, 17 out of those 50 would
lose their seats.
Inside of Tennessee there is no
remedy and the state is in the
grip of a self-perpetuating rural
minority. I

THIS SITUATION, which ox- 1
ists in several other states, means j
that there is no legal remedy for
a very serious wrong. It is a very
serious wrong that in the Ten
nessee Senate 20 out of 33 mem
bers are elected by 37 per cent
of the voters, and that in the
House of Representatives 63
members out of 99 are elected by |
40 per cent of the voters. It is a I
serious wrong because such a j
state legislature is not and can
not be sufficiently interested to
deal with the mounting problems
of the growing cities.
Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s com-1
ment on this crucial point is that j
“there is not under our const it u- j
lion a judicial remedy for every |
political mischief, for every un- j
desirable exercise of legislative I
power. The Framers carefully
and with deliberate forethought |
refused so to enthrone the judi
ciary. In this situation, as in |
others of like nature, appeal for
relief does not belong here (that
is, in the Supreme Court). Ap
peal must be to an informed, civ
ically militant electorate.”
If there is no judicial remedy i
for a serious wrong affecting the ]
welfare of the urban masses, and |
if, as is in fact (he case in Ten
nessee, relief cannot be had from j
the electorate, however informed
k 1,1 ■ n.1.1 .

and civically militant the major
ity may be, what happens then?
If all the doors are closed, how do
the city people of Tennessee get
relief? It is always a dangerous
situation when the doors are
closed against judicial or public
or political relief and against
peaceable change.
WHAT HAS actually happened
is that the six justices, the ma
jority of the court, have opened
a little the one door of Federal
judicial relief. They have opened
it only a crack at the moment
but there is no doubt that the
two dissenting justices are fully [
justified in warning the country j
that if the door is opened wide, j
the courts may become danger
ously involved in state politics j
all over the nation. This would
be an appalling thing to contem- j
plate, to have Federal judges
drawn into becoming the arbiters
of the political affairs of each |
state.
One must conclude, I think that
this “novel judicial power” will
be “destructive” or will not be [
destructive, depending upon the J
wisdom and restraint with which j
it is exercised. That, of course, is !
true of all power. But in such a I
novel power it is especially im
portant to be aware of it.
For the remedy is a highly
dangerous drug and it will have
to be administered most cautious- j
ly. That means, 1 think, that we
must not do again what was done
after the 1954 decision in the
school segregation case. We must
not leave the application of the
new rule to haphazard local law |
suits. There must be national j
leadership this time, and it should )
come from the President and I
from the Republican and Demo- |
cratic leaders. The burden of j
working out the strategy and the
tactics of the movement for fair
er and more realistic representa
tion should be on the politicians
and not on the judges.

40 per cent of the voters. It is a I
serious wrong because such a j
state legislature is not and can
not be sufficiently interested to
deal with the mounting problems
of the growing cities.
Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s com-1
ment on this crucial point is that j
“there is not under our const it u- j
lion a judicial remedy for every |
political mischief, for every un- j
desirable exercise of legislative I
power. The Framers carefully
and with deliberate forethought |
refused so to enthrone the judi
ciary. In this situation, as in |
others of like nature, appeal for
relief does not belong here (that
is, in the Supreme Court). Ap
peal must be to an informed, civ
ically militant electorate.”
If there is no judicial remedy i
for a serious wrong affecting the ]
welfare of the urban masses, and |
if, as is in fact (he case in Ten
nessee, relief cannot be had from j
the electorate, however informed
k 1,1 ■ n.1.1 .

and civically militant the major
ity may be, what happens then?
If all the doors are closed, how do
the city people of Tennessee get
relief? It is always a dangerous
situation when the doors are
closed against judicial or public
or political relief and against
peaceable change.
WHAT HAS actually happened
is that the six justices, the ma
jority of the court, have opened
a little the one door of Federal
judicial relief. They have opened
it only a crack at the moment
but there is no doubt that the
two dissenting justices are fully [
justified in warning the country j
that if the door is opened wide, j
the courts may become danger
ously involved in state politics j
all over the nation. This would
be an appalling thing to contem- j
plate, to have Federal judges
drawn into becoming the arbiters
of the political affairs of each |
state.
One must conclude, I think that
this “novel judicial power” will
be “destructive” or will not be [
destructive, depending upon the J
wisdom and restraint with which j
it is exercised. That, of course, is !
true of all power. But in such a I
novel power it is especially im
portant to be aware of it.
For the remedy is a highly
dangerous drug and it will have
to be administered most cautious- j
ly. That means, 1 think, that we
must not do again what was done
after the 1954 decision in the
school segregation case. We must
not leave the application of the
new rule to haphazard local law |
suits. There must be national j
leadership this time, and it should )
come from the President and I
from the Republican and Demo- |
cratic leaders. The burden of j
working out the strategy and the
tactics of the movement for fair
er and more realistic representa
tion should be on the politicians
and not on the judges.
