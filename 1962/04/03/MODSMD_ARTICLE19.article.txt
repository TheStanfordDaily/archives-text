# 'West Side Story' Film Called Outstanding; Improves on Play
## 
### 
By MARY LOU GREENBERG
An American boy, a Puerto
Rican girl and two rival gangs on
New York’s West Side. These are
the characters in the modern-day
film version of “Romeo and Ju
liet,” “West Side Story.”
A simple and familiar plot. Yet
with Leonard Bernstein’s music,
Jerome Robbins’ choreography
and some of the best photography
yet seen on the screen, it has be
come an outstanding motion pic
ture.
The play “West Side Story’’
was a milestone in the field of
musical theater, successfully
blending dancing, singing and the
spoken word to advance a serious
theme, something no other musi
cal had done before.
The film version is equally im
portant. Through imaginative
use of the camera and atr excel
lent sound track, it shows how a
motion picture can improve on a
remarkable play. None of the
original’s vitality is lost, and the
plot line has been sharpened by
including more social criticism.
Both versions sympathize with
the frustrated, frightened, inse
cure youth who find themselves
caught involuntarily in a web of
hatred, poverty and prejudice.
These youths find little under
standing among those who are
primarily responsible for this
constricting environment, the
adults.
The film, however, is more
critical of society than is the play.
This is best indicated by the
change of lyrics in the song,
“America.”
In the original Broadway pro
duction this number was merely
an exchange between several
Puerto Rican girls comparing
life back homo and in Manhat
tan. In the film however, the
song spells out the inequalities of
opportunity which exist for non
whites and foreigners in “the
land of the free.”
“West Side Story” could be
described as a drama through
movement rather than words. As
such, the play is enhanced
through the film medium which
gives a much wider range for the
many dance sequences.
The saunters through the city
j streets, the rumble under the
highv.'ay. these all are danced
1 rather than “acted.” Here, dance

and music become the logical
and inevitable vehicle of expres
sion: there are no awkward trans
itions from the story to the dance.
None is needed as there are
neither songs nor dances which
can be called mere musical inter
ludes or plot interruptions.
Much of the picture is filmed
in the streets of New York which
lends excitement as well as au
thenticity to the setting. The
film’s opening, New York as seen
from a helicopter flying over the
city, is stunning.
While the film as a whole is
more memorable than are individ
ual performances, Natalie Wood
gives a sensitive performance as
j Maria, the heroine, and Rita Mo
reno is very good as her friend
Anita.
The one really outstanding per

formance is given by George Cha
kiris as Bernardo, Maria’s broth
er and the leader of the Puerto
Rican “Sharks.”
Unfortunately, the Romeo role
of Tony Is played by Richard
Beymer who is not convincing.
Russ Tamblyn does a good job
as Riff, the leader of the Ameri
can “Jets.” He, Chakiris and
Miss Moreno are excellent danc
ers whose performances add to
the picture’s success.
While there are several hu
morous sequences and many
lighthearted scenes, the picture
sustains the mood of impending
tragedy throughout.
; “West Side Story” is now play
j ing at the United Artists The
-1 j ater, Market St. opposite Jones,
in San Francisco. Tickets may be
1 reserved by calling UN 1-5678.

By MARY LOU GREENBERG
An American boy, a Puerto
Rican girl and two rival gangs on
New York’s West Side. These are
the characters in the modern-day
film version of “Romeo and Ju
liet,” “West Side Story.”
A simple and familiar plot. Yet
with Leonard Bernstein’s music,
Jerome Robbins’ choreography
and some of the best photography
yet seen on the screen, it has be
come an outstanding motion pic
ture.
The play “West Side Story’’
was a milestone in the field of
musical theater, successfully
blending dancing, singing and the
spoken word to advance a serious
theme, something no other musi
cal had done before.
The film version is equally im
portant. Through imaginative
use of the camera and atr excel
lent sound track, it shows how a
motion picture can improve on a
remarkable play. None of the
original’s vitality is lost, and the
plot line has been sharpened by
including more social criticism.
Both versions sympathize with
the frustrated, frightened, inse
cure youth who find themselves
caught involuntarily in a web of
hatred, poverty and prejudice.
These youths find little under
standing among those who are
primarily responsible for this
constricting environment, the
adults.
The film, however, is more
critical of society than is the play.
This is best indicated by the
change of lyrics in the song,
“America.”
In the original Broadway pro
duction this number was merely
an exchange between several
Puerto Rican girls comparing
life back homo and in Manhat
tan. In the film however, the
song spells out the inequalities of
opportunity which exist for non
whites and foreigners in “the
land of the free.”
“West Side Story” could be
described as a drama through
movement rather than words. As
such, the play is enhanced
through the film medium which
gives a much wider range for the
many dance sequences.
The saunters through the city
j streets, the rumble under the
highv.'ay. these all are danced
1 rather than “acted.” Here, dance

and music become the logical
and inevitable vehicle of expres
sion: there are no awkward trans
itions from the story to the dance.
None is needed as there are
neither songs nor dances which
can be called mere musical inter
ludes or plot interruptions.
Much of the picture is filmed
in the streets of New York which
lends excitement as well as au
thenticity to the setting. The
film’s opening, New York as seen
from a helicopter flying over the
city, is stunning.
While the film as a whole is
more memorable than are individ
ual performances, Natalie Wood
gives a sensitive performance as
j Maria, the heroine, and Rita Mo
reno is very good as her friend
Anita.
The one really outstanding per

formance is given by George Cha
kiris as Bernardo, Maria’s broth
er and the leader of the Puerto
Rican “Sharks.”
Unfortunately, the Romeo role
of Tony Is played by Richard
Beymer who is not convincing.
