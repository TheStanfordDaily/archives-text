# Left Wingers To Clash Here
## 
### 
A public debate between a Com
munist and a Socialist, “Ways to
a Better Society.” will be present
ed by the Socialist Caucus to
morrow at 8 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium.
The Socialist speaker, Bogdan
Denitch, is Bay Area leader of the
Socialist Party of America.
Mickey Lima, the Communist
speaker, is executive officer of
the Communist Party of North
ern California.
Denitch is a follower of Nor
man Thomas’s brand of demo
cratic socialism and is opposed
to any totalitarian solution to so
cial and economic problems. He
has been active in organizing
Freedom Rides to the South, in
championing the cause of the mi
gratory farm workers, and in
the campaign to abolish HUAC.
Representing the Socialist view.
Denitch debated here in February
against a member of the John
Birch Society and last spring
against Professor Paul Sweezey.
Debating the question, “Is the
Soviet Union a Socialist Society?”
Denitch maintained that it is not
because of the absence of civil
liberties in that country.
Lima, who defends the Moscow
Party Lino, has debated at many
colleges in northern California,
but was forbidden to speak at
Berkeley.
