# Baseballers Lose Twice to Trojans
## 
### 
Sloppy defense hurt Stanford,
and the baseballers lost two
games to USC over the weekend.
USC was .ranked first in college
baseball ratings preceding the
games.
Both Darrell Sutherland and
Jim Lonborg pitched well, but
eight un-earned runs hurt in the
8-2 and 4-1 losses.
ON SATURDAY Sutherland
went six innings, allowing two
earned runs, hut left with Stan
ford behind 7-2.
The only bright spot for Stan
ford was the hitting of Rich Fer
razzano and Joel Shulman. Both
doubled and singled, with Shul
man’s two-base hit driving in
both Stanford runs.
Lonborg went the distance on
Friday, giving up just one earned
run over eight innings. However
seven Stanford errors betrayed
him, three by Ferrazzano.
SC ItKOKU THE game wide
open in the sixth inning without
benefit of a hit, scoring three
runs. Five errors, awild pitch, a
hit batter and two bases on balls
did the damage.
