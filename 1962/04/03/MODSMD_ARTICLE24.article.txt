# DOMINATE FIELD EVENTS
## Trackmen Lose Triangular 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
Excellence in the field events
could not save Stanford from de
feat at the hands of San Jose
State and Kansas in a close tri
angular meet held Saturday at
Stanford.
The Spartans won the meet
56* i». to 54 for Kansas and 51 Is
for Stanford.
THE TRIBE WON five of six
field events, but could do no bet
ter than three second places in
the running contests.
Steve Arch, who seems to in
crease his shot put range by a
foot every meet, went out to 58-
1 'j to win his specialty.
In the discus, perhaps Stan
ford’s best event, Dave Weill did
what he has been doing with
regularity, getting close to the
190-foot mark. He threw 187-6.
Dave should soon break the col
legiate disk record held by USC’s
Jim Wade.
DON BELL DAVE Stanford a
1-2 in the disk with a heave of
162-feet.
Art Batchelder again went over

the 240 mark in the javelin at
24(1-11edging San Jose’s Dan
Studney by three feet.
Charles Barth and Dan Moore
gave Stanford 1-2 in the broad

jump. Barth, vvhe seems to jump

just tar enough to win, jumped
23-6 ’i to Moore's 23-5 *i.
In the pole vault. Phil White
went up to 14-6 for an easy win.
STANFORD’S LACK of wins
in the running events was an un-

fortunate result of a star-studded
field, not bad performances.
For example, Harry McCalla
ran a 4:08.9 best-of-life mark in
the mile, and squeaked by with
a fourth place finish. Rich Klier
was fourth in the 880 with a good
1:52.3. Ken Emmanuels ran a
very good 47.9 440, and finished
second.
EMMANUELS WAS Stanford's

besl track performer, adding an
excel lent anchor leg on the mile
relay team to his 440. The other
two Stanford second places were
by Phil Lamoreaux in the 220,
and Steve Cot-fright in (he low
hurdles.
Kansas had most of the out
standing runners, hut San Jose
l ad enough clutch performances
to win. The only double winner
was Kansas’ Charles Smith, who
won both hurdles. Distance man
Bill Dotson turned in an excellent
double for the Jayhawks, 4:04.3
in the mile for second place, and
a 9:0 i.l winning two mile.
San Jose got top results from
miler Ben Tucker. 4:03.6. high
jumper Vance Barnes, 6-10. and
weight man Studney. Studney,
taped up with a cracked verte
brae, torn back muscles and a
bad knee, got his Important sec
ond in the javelin at 237-10 and
threw the discus 158-8 to finish
fourth, as every point was im
portant in the area’s closest tri
angular meet within memory.
Stanford was never out of the
meet all the way, until eliminated
when Kansas was 1-2 in the two
mile, and San Jose 3-4. Still, it
was Stanford that prevented the
Jayhawks from winning. If San
Jose won the relay, all Kansas
needed to do was finish second
to take the meet by D-point.
BUT THE CARDS ran a 3:14.8
to better their season’s best by
2.5 seconds to shut the Kansans
out and win the meet for San
Jose.
San Jose w-on the triangular
meet, and both its dual meets.
Kansas defeated Stanford 67-64
in their dual meet.
