# Ruggers Lose To SC in Finale
## 
### 
Stanford closed out its rugby
season on a dismal note, being
decisioned by USC in the Mon
terey Rugby Tournament.
Neither team scored in the
thirty minutes of regulation play,
and a five-minute overtime period
likewise produced no scoring, so
SC was given the game on the
referee’s decision that their of
fense was better than the Cards’.
The tournament was won by
the Universities Club of Berke
ley, a team that Stanford easily
defeated in the regular season.
In fact, either the Stanford
varsity or JV’s defeated most of
the 16 teams competing in the
tourney, at one time or the other,
and had edged USC earlier this
year.
Stanford rugby coach Pete
Kmetovic accepted the decision
gracefully.
