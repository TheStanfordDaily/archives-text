# Student Financial Manager Chosen
## 
### 
Frederick Nelson, a sophomore,
was appointed the student finan
cial manager for next year. Nel
son was selected from a group of
four applicants by Dean of Stu
dents H. D. Winbigler, who acted
as advisor to ASSU, after a meet
ing of a selecting committee of
deans and student officers at the
end of winter quarter.

In a statement prepared for
The Daily, Nelson said;
“The Student Financial Man
ager’s office is at the focus of
the diverse activities of the stu
dent body, in a sort of crossfire
between the legislature, the uni
versity, the student organizations
and outside groups and individu
als. To me, this is a challenge.
I’m extremely grateful for the
chance to work here, and I hope
this will be an enjoyable—and
rewarding—year for ASSU.”
