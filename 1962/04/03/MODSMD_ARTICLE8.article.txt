# Revolt Spreads in Syria; New Regime Loses Ground
## 
### 
DAMASCUS, Syria (UPD- An
army revolt against the new mili
tary regime in Damascus spread
through northern Syria yester
day. Insurgent leaders openly de
clared their allegiance to Presi
dent Gamal Abdel Nasser of the
United Arab Republic.

All indications were the rebels
were winning. The military re
gime which seized power live
days ago from President Nazem
El Kudsi countered with an offer
of its own for friendship with
Nasser —a plebiscite on the rebel
demands for reunion with Egypt.
In Beirut, Lebanon, reports
said that Kudsi and the military
junta in Damascus had reached
an agreement under which the
former president would resume
his office. The reports said the
fate of members of the former
Kudsi cabinet would be decided
in further negatiations.
WESTERN diplomatic sources

in Jerusalem, Israel, said Mon
day the army split in Syria could
develop into a civil war. They
rated the Damascus faction
stronger than the insurgents in
the north but said the outcome of
a struggle—if it comes—would
bo problematical.
The declaration of allegiance to
Nasser came first in the big north
ern city of Aleppo. By nightfall
the revolt had spread to the ma
jor population centers of Lat
takia, Homs, Hama and Delrez

zor and there were renewed de
mands the U.A.R. be reestablish
ed.
Last night Radio Aleppo in
northern Syria opened its broad
cast by calling itself “The UAR
broadcasting station in Aleppo.”
It followed this with praise for
Nasser and a pledge to defend
UAR unity “to the last drop of
blood.” It played patriotic UAR
signs.
Cairo radio said the Aleppo
broadcast showed “the masses of

the people have organized them
selves” around the officers in the
north.

Damascus Radio, speaking for
the ruling army command, broad
cast a communique advocating
“unity with the liberated Arab
powers, especially Egypt . . . pro
vided such unity ensures the dig
nity and status of this country
and avoids past mistakes.”
Earlier the Damascus regime
had disclaimed any plans to re
unite Syria with Egypt.
No major fighting was reported
although five persons were re
ported killed in weekend clashes
that, followed pro-Nasser demon
strations. However Turkey, Iraq,
and Jordan were reported to have
moved troops to their borders in
case there is trouble in Israel.
Syria and Egypt formed the
United Arab Republic in 1958.
That union was splintered last
Sept. 28 by a military coup led
by army men who believed Syria
was getting the short end in its
dealings with Nasser. That gave
way to a civilian regime under
Kudsi.
LAST WEDNESDAY military
officers again toppled the civilian
government. But officers at Alep
po called on army units to obey
only their orders and condemned
the soldiers who broke up the
union with Egypt in last Septem
ber’s revolt.

Damascus-based army units
surrounded the capital Monday
morning, leaving police armed
with rifles and machineguns to
maintain order in the city itself.
By order of the army command
meetings of more than five per
sons were banned and an 8 p.m.
to 5 a.m. curfew was imposed.
Borders, harbors and airports
were closed.
