INDIANS
They laughed when I
sat down to play the
piano, but their
laughs turned to
cheers of amazement
on noting I was
wearing my new ski
knit sweater with
zipper front and
cardigan neck from
R A. Only 23.95,
they come in white,
black & green, and
though I still can't
play the piano, Iâ€™m
the key to every party.
