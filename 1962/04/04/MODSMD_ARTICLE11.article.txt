# Terrorists Besiege Algerian Hospital
## 
### 
ALGIERS ( UPl)—European Secret Army Organization (OAS)
terrorists raided a Moslem hospital in suburban Algiers yesterday
and machinegunned helpless, screaming patients in their beds.
They then exploded a bomb that gutted the bullet-riddled hospital.
At least 10 Moslems were killed and eight wounded, most of

them seriously, in one of the
bloodiest attacks yet staged by
the OAS in its last-ditch drive to
upset the Algerian cease-fire.
It appeared to be part of a de
liberate OAS campaign to goad
the Moslem population into mass
revenge attacks on Europeans in
which the French army would
have to intervene against the
Moslems.
Five more explosions attributed
to the OAS rocked Algiers at 10-
second intervals Tuesday night
and several others were reported
minutes later from suburban
areas.
THE FIRST five blasts caused
heavy damage in the downtown
section of the city but there were
no immediate reports of casual
ties.
Other terrorist killings through
out Algeria sent the death toll for
the year soaring near the 3,400
mark. Nevertheless, President
Abderrahamane Fares of the new
mixed Moslem-European provi
sional executive body, said his
aim is to bring peace to this tor
tured country.
“I emphasize that the hand
proffered to our European com
patriots is a sincere and loyal
hand,” the Moslem president said
in a news conference at his Roch
er Noir headquarters east of Al
giers.
EYEWITNESSES said some 15
OAS men wearing stolen uni
forms of the Republican Security
Guards CRS'*- 1 invaded the hos
pital at 6:35 a.m. while many of
the patients were still sleeping
and nurses were preparing break
fasts for the sick.
