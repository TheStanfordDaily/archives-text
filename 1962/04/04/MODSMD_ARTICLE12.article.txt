# Leftists Debate Social Reform
## 
### 
Divergent “Ways to a Better So
ciety” will be presented in a public
debate tonight at 8 p.m., Cubber
ley Auditorium, between Bogdan
Denitch, Bay Area leader of the
Socialist Party of America and
Mickey Lima, head of the Com
munist Party in Northern Cali
fornia.
Denitch has made two previous
appearances at Stanford, in which
he defended democratic socialism
and supported the maintenance of
civil liberties. In last spring’s de
bate with Professor Paul Sweezey,
he insisted that the Soviet Union
is not a socialist society because
totalitarian means are used to
solve social and economic prob
lems.
In addition to bolstering the
campaign against the HUAC, Den
itch has also joined in organizing
Freedom Rides to the South and
in championing the cause of the
migratory farm workers.
Mickey Lima, who was not al
lowed to speak at Berkeley, stands
by the Moscow version of social
reform and has debated elsewhere
in Northern California.
The debate has been organized
under the auspices of the Socialist
Caucus.
