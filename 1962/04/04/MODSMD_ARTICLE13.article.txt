THOMPSON ATTACKED
Editor, The Daily:
I have a former fellow gradu
ate student at Stanford to thank
for the article, "Classics Depart
ment Has Undergone Rebirth” by
Scott Thompson (March I). I am
forwarding photostats of it to
members of the Yale and Brown
Classics Departments. Having
been in this department for two
years I share the majority of
Thompson’s views, but would, un
like Thompson, place the laurels
for the renaissance upon the
heads of Professors Otis and
Pearson.

Stanford’s undergraduate pro
gram may be sterling, but beyond
the San Francisco Airport no one
knows whether there are one or
100 undergrad majors. Otis and
Pearson have formulated an ex
cellent graduate program and
have brought outstanding schol
ars to do the teaching, namely
Professors Waszink and Frankel.
This is the basis of increased
awareness in academic circles
that Stanford has a thriving de
partment, not, Mr. Thompson’s
numbers game.

ME. THOMPSON falls to the
level of “yellow journalism”
when he writes, "Too many de
partments, like those of Prince
ton, Yale, and Brown have fallen
into the rut of teaching courses
primarily in translation for lack
of majors.” This statement is not
only in bad taste it is incorrect.
It mystifies me as to how an un
dergraduate, saddled at one insti
tution, deems himself fit critic
of three departments 3000 miles
away, at institutions he has never
attended.
If he had a source of informa
tion he should have stated who
the source is and what the nature
of his connection with these three
institutions was. As one who
studied at Brown, then Stanford,
and is now completing his pro
gram at Yale, I consider the state
ment an insult to two outstand
ing, in fact prominent, depart
ments. Mr. Thompson has em
ployed ‘the half-truth’ in this
slanderous charge. The Brown
department does teach a larger
number of courses in translation
than does the Stanford depart
ment (which he later says teaches
too few!). But what Mr. Thomp
son does not inform his readers
is that the Brown department
also teaches a larger number of
courses in the original.
The charge against Brown is
reduced to the absurd when one
considers that large numbers of
its students have preceded to
graduate work at the finest insti-

I tut ions, and they most assuredly
read Latin and Greek. And Brown
has no need of a renaissance in
that the Classics there have en
joyed an unbroken period of im
portance and the tradition of das
-1 sical learning has sent scores of
its students to do archaeological
work abroad, while the Universi
ty is the main financial supporter
I of the American School ‘dig’ at
Corinth. All this from an institu
tion one-half Stanford’s size.

THE CHARGE of "dying de
partment” is equally ridiculous
when leveled at Yale. This letter
j is typed in Phelps Hall (Classics
Department), Yale, and I assure
you that I cannot locate the large
number of courses in translation
which Mr. Thompson refers to.
j There is one: Classical Civiliza
j tion 10, and it in no way counts
J towards a major in this depart
j ment. As to reading in the origin
al, the preppies having started
both languages before reaching
j Yale’s portals, are able to hold
j their own against any in the
i country. To be blunt, I have never
j met undergrads who could read
both languages with such facility.
Both Brown and Yale are deserv
ing of a Daily retraction and apol
ogy-

This incident reveals a certain
naivete on the part of Thompson
and a large number of Stanford
undergraduates. Stanford is mak
ing progress, but the goals to
which you are aspiring will not
be attained through callously in
sulting those institutions whose
long traditions have supplied the
ideals of American higher educa
tion. Statements from faculty
members that Stanford is the
“second-best” institution in the
country are of no avail either.
That you wish to be the “Har
vard of the West” demonstrates
the provincial attitude of “first
in the bush league,” and the
cringing awkwardness of the
Stanford undergrad when he
meets his Princeton. Yale, or
Brown counterpart w'ho suppos
edly cannot read Greek. While
Stanford has made great progress
the rest of the world has not
stood still, struck with awe.
Where Stanford has made great
progress, as in its classics depart
ment, it has not been achieved
through slander but by original
programs and by securing the
outstanding scholars in the field.
Behind Mr. Thompson’s article
lies the desire to be Harvard. As
a good classicist Mr. Thompson
should know that a Roman for
gery never quite has the quality
of the Greek original.
