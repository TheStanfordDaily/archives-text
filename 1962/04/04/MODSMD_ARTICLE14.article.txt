# Opposition of Britain to UN Southern Rhodesia Resolution
## 
### 
By RICHARD F. VAX HORN
Recently the United Nations
voted to send a UN investigating
committee to Southern Rhodesia
to study alleged abuses in African
rights. The United States and
Great Britain voted against the
measuie.

The UN action under the lead
ership of the Afro-Asian bloc
seems to have been prompted by
the speeches of Joshua Nkomo.
leader of the African Nationalist
Party in Southern Rhodesia. Nko
mo paints a picture of European
abuses against the Africans
which is distorted.
WHY DID Britain so vehement
ly oppose the UN resolution? Two
reasons are given. The first in
volves the timing of the UN ac
tion.

Southern Rhodesia is a self
governing British colony within
the Federation of Rhodesia and
Nyasaland. In the past, she has
had the dominant voice in the
Federation, more so than even
Britain. Northern Rhodesia and
Nyasaland, the other two mem
bers in the Federation, are Brit
ish territories. As such, final au
thority concerning the two terri
tories comes from Britain. Right
now’ the British Commonwealth
Office is negotiating a new con
titution for Northern Rhodesia
which is expected to call for an
African majority.
IX NYASALAND, Dr. Banda,
the African leader who is now the
most influential man in the gov
ernment, is adamantly demand
ing Nyasaland’s secession from
the Federation. Even in Southern
Rhodesia there is talk of a new
constitution which cannot be
adopted without British approval.
In short, the political situation is
tense. The presence of a UN fact

finding committee would do much
to heighten the friction.

A second reason Britain fears
UN investigation is that it could
trigger a showdown.
There are two main political
bodies within the European popu
lation in Southern Rhodesia. The

first group are (he Conservatives
who believe racial integration
should take place gradually, if it
must lake place at all. The other
group are the Liberals wdio see
a need to promote educated Afri
cans into positions of responsi
bility and a need for rapid inte
gration of the races.
BOTH SIDES have strong
points to make and most Euro
peans, it seems, fall into the no
man’s land between these two ex
tremes.

Over against these policies are
the African Nationalists who be
lieve Africans should be given the
authority of government immedi
ately.
If a UN committee were to
come and investigate, and if it
were to make itself unpopular
with the Europeans (they hate
outsiders telling them how to run
their country), it might polarize
(he political views of the people.
IF THE European people begin
to take more definite stands than
they have at present, the Con
servatives will gain. If the Con
servatives come to power and
anti-integration laws are passed,
the African Nationalists would
certainly react. Open rebellion is
likely to result.

Britain sees the necessity of
retaining the present situation.
As long as the party in power is
willing to make concessions,
which is the situation now, hope
for peaceful settlement of the
problem still exists.
