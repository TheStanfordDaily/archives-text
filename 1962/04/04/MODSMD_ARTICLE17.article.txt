# GO TO CLASS
## Sorbonne Beseiged in Zeal Strike 
### 
PARIS In American college
cities, students are disciplined for
cutting classes. But in Paris go
ing to class can be one of the
worst things a student can do.
Students at the University of
Paris tried to prove this point re
cently by staging a “strike of
zeal.” The “strike” consisted of
everyone’s going to classes.
IF THE strike called by the
National Union of Students had
received anything but indiffer
ent response there would prob
ably have been an unmanageable
crush that could have paralyzed
higher education for the day.
The strike was called to protest
overcrowding in the university.
An inkling of what could hap
pen was given when the universi
ty library was beseiged. It is the
only library in the world-famous
Sorbonne, which is the seat of
the Faculties of Arts and Letters
and of Science.
THERE ARE 500 seats in the
library and almost 50,000 students
registered in the two faculties.
Only a small percentage of the
total registration was needed to
produce long lines that began at
the library doors, spiraled down
staircases and stretched through
the long halls.
In general, however, the strike
leaders failed to produce a crush
in the lecture halls. This crush
can be seen best at the beginning
of the school year, they explained.
Then, after the students fight
to get in to hear a professor,
apathy sets in and most students
just stay home or sit in cafes for
the rest of the year and study
notes made by others.
AS IN MOST European univer
sities, the lecture system by
which a professor gives his
course to several hundred stu
dents at a time is the usual meth
od of instruction at the Sorbonne.
The Sorbonne building was
completed in 1901 and was much
admired at the time. But; the
student population has increased
tenfold since then while the fa
cilities have remained much the
same.
A NEW science building is be
ing finished at the site of the
Paris Wine Market and this has
helped somewhat to ease the
strain on facilities.
But students milling about in
the Sorbonne halls today report
ed that lecture halls built to hold
250 students often had 500 or
more registered for the courses
given there. The students also
said that there were no study
halls.
The library is used by many
for study purposes while those
trying to get at one of its books
must wait vainly outside. Books
cannot be checked out.
SOME professors, knowing
they are lecturing to half their
students, have allowed their lec
tures to be printed and distribut
ed. For those who do not permit
this system, students must have
recourse to others’ notes.
The professors check on their
printed reports for errors but
many students must go through
a whole year depending on the
i unverified accuracy of their fel
low-students.

PARIS In American college
cities, students are disciplined for
cutting classes. But in Paris go
ing to class can be one of the
worst things a student can do.
Students at the University of
Paris tried to prove this point re
cently by staging a “strike of
zeal.” The “strike” consisted of
everyone’s going to classes.
IF THE strike called by the
National Union of Students had
received anything but indiffer
ent response there would prob
ably have been an unmanageable
crush that could have paralyzed
higher education for the day.
The strike was called to protest
overcrowding in the university.
An inkling of what could hap
pen was given when the universi
ty library was beseiged. It is the
only library in the world-famous
Sorbonne, which is the seat of
the Faculties of Arts and Letters
and of Science.
THERE ARE 500 seats in the
library and almost 50,000 students
registered in the two faculties.
Only a small percentage of the
total registration was needed to
produce long lines that began at
the library doors, spiraled down
staircases and stretched through
the long halls.
In general, however, the strike
leaders failed to produce a crush
in the lecture halls. This crush
can be seen best at the beginning
of the school year, they explained.
Then, after the students fight
to get in to hear a professor,
apathy sets in and most students
just stay home or sit in cafes for
the rest of the year and study
notes made by others.
AS IN MOST European univer
sities, the lecture system by
which a professor gives his
course to several hundred stu
dents at a time is the usual meth
od of instruction at the Sorbonne.
The Sorbonne building was
completed in 1901 and was much
admired at the time. But; the
student population has increased
tenfold since then while the fa
cilities have remained much the
same.
A NEW science building is be
ing finished at the site of the
Paris Wine Market and this has
helped somewhat to ease the
strain on facilities.
But students milling about in
the Sorbonne halls today report
ed that lecture halls built to hold
250 students often had 500 or
more registered for the courses
given there. The students also
said that there were no study
halls.
The library is used by many
for study purposes while those
trying to get at one of its books
must wait vainly outside. Books
cannot be checked out.
SOME professors, knowing
they are lecturing to half their
students, have allowed their lec
tures to be printed and distribut
ed. For those who do not permit
this system, students must have
recourse to others’ notes.
