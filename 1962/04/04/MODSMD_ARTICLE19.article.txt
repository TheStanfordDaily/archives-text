Since Benny (Kid) Paret was knocked into a fatal coma by
Emile Griffith, everyone from Governor Edmund G. Brown on down
has advocated the abolition of boxing.
This is merely a buck-passing solution of what isn’t necessarily
a problem. Boxing doesn’t have to be abolished, and shouldn’t be.
ACTUALLY, boxing is one of the most natural sports in the
world. Much more natural than five men throwing an inflated
rubber ball through a steel hoop, or 11 heavily armored athletes
pounding each ather to advance a bladder 100 yards.
The abolition of boxing would be comparable to amputating an
arm at the shoulder because of an infected hand.
Treat the Infected Part
Only the infected part of boving should be treated, hut which
part is the infected one?
GRIFFITH HAS been blamed for the Paret tragedy, but was it
his fault? He was within his rights in pounding Paret. The Kid
wasn’t on the canvas and the fight hadn’t been stopped. It was his
job to make sure that Paret didn’t come back and beat him.
Referee Ruby Goldstein was likewise carrying out his job. Paret
was known to have an iron jaw, and had rescued himself from
trouble before. How could Goldstein tell that he wouldn’t do it again?
Goldstein’s part was one of pure judgment, and it turns out that
his judgment was incorrect. According to the rules of boxing, Gold
stein did his job adequately.
Then where does the fault He?
When Paret went into the ring, it was scarcely four months
since he had taken a fearful beating from Gene Fullmer. Paret lasted
10 rounds against the middleweight champ before being KO’ed.
Paret Fought Griffith Twice Before
Before that, Paret had been belted hard by Griffith in (wo dif
ferent fights. In one, he regained the title from the New Yorker,
and in the other was knocked out.
IN OTHER words, Paret had been KO’ed two times in his last
three fights, and in the fight in which he lasted the distance, he
absorbed abnormal punishment.
I wonder how carefully Pare! was examined by doctors before
being allowed to fight Griffith. No matter how carefully he was
examined, it is obvious that somehow the doctors missed a serious
brain injury, or an injury which could become serious indeed if
exposed to continued punishment.
Perhaps the various organizations which govern boxing in dif
ferent states should make a better attempt to care for their own.
Certainly no precaution is too great where a man’s life is at stake.
BOXING MUST he operated on and nursed to health, not killed
by thoughtless legislation.

BOXING MUST he operated on and nursed to health, not killed
by thoughtless legislation.
Since Benny (Kid) Paret was knocked into a fatal coma by
Emile Griffith, everyone from Governor Edmund G. Brown on down
has advocated the abolition of boxing.
This is merely a buck-passing solution of what isn’t necessarily
a problem. Boxing doesn’t have to be abolished, and shouldn’t be.
ACTUALLY, boxing is one of the most natural sports in the
world. Much more natural than five men throwing an inflated
rubber ball through a steel hoop, or 11 heavily armored athletes
pounding each ather to advance a bladder 100 yards.
The abolition of boxing would be comparable to amputating an
arm at the shoulder because of an infected hand.
Treat the Infected Part
Only the infected part of boving should be treated, hut which
part is the infected one?
GRIFFITH HAS been blamed for the Paret tragedy, but was it
his fault? He was within his rights in pounding Paret. The Kid
wasn’t on the canvas and the fight hadn’t been stopped. It was his
job to make sure that Paret didn’t come back and beat him.
Referee Ruby Goldstein was likewise carrying out his job. Paret
was known to have an iron jaw, and had rescued himself from
trouble before. How could Goldstein tell that he wouldn’t do it again?
Goldstein’s part was one of pure judgment, and it turns out that
his judgment was incorrect. According to the rules of boxing, Gold
stein did his job adequately.
Then where does the fault He?
When Paret went into the ring, it was scarcely four months
since he had taken a fearful beating from Gene Fullmer. Paret lasted
10 rounds against the middleweight champ before being KO’ed.
Paret Fought Griffith Twice Before
Before that, Paret had been belted hard by Griffith in (wo dif
ferent fights. In one, he regained the title from the New Yorker,
and in the other was knocked out.
IN OTHER words, Paret had been KO’ed two times in his last
three fights, and in the fight in which he lasted the distance, he
absorbed abnormal punishment.
I wonder how carefully Pare! was examined by doctors before
being allowed to fight Griffith. No matter how carefully he was
examined, it is obvious that somehow the doctors missed a serious
brain injury, or an injury which could become serious indeed if
exposed to continued punishment.
Perhaps the various organizations which govern boxing in dif
ferent states should make a better attempt to care for their own.
Certainly no precaution is too great where a man’s life is at stake.
