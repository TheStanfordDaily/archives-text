SACRAMENTO (UPD—Gov.
Edmund G. Brown yesterday re
sponded to the death of Bonny
Kid Paret by asking for a review
of California boxing rules cover
ing prevention of injury or death.
Brown, who last week said that
he would like to see boxing out
lawed in California, said; “I have
asked Doug Hayden, chairman
of the slate Athletic Commission,
to review our rules in California
to bo sure we have done every
thing possible to prevent such
tragedy in the ring of this state."
He said he was confident the
commission had done all possible,
“but Mr. Hayden and I wanted
to bo doubly sure of that.”

Brown said March 27, three
days after Paret was injured, that
he was turned against boxing 30
years ago by witnessing the Max
Baer-Frankie Campbell fight in
San Francisco, after which Camp-

boll died.
The Governor railed the sport
“dirty, rotten and brutalizing,”
and said that he expected that
measures to outlaw professional
boxing would be introduced in
the 1963 Legislature. But he said
he had no plans to initiate the
action.

Mondy, the Assembly approved
a resolution calling for an interim
study of boxing in California.
