# Neutralists Ask To Inspect for Bomb Test Ban
## 
### 
GENEVA (UPl)—Three more
non-aligned nations called yester
day for neutral, third-party polic
ing of a nuclear - test ban treaty.

British Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Joseph Godber
told the 17-nation disarmament
conference that if the Soviet
Union continues to reject interna
tional inspection, “it is highly im
probable that any progress can
be made.”

He supported fully the case for
"objective and effective” controls
to prevent cheating as outlined
Monday by U.S. disarmament ex
pert Arthur H. Dean,

“The Soviet claims that the
West wants international inspec
tion merely for espionage pur
poses do not bear scrutiny,” God
ber said. “National detection sys
tems are not good enough to solve
the arguments which might arise
over them.”
The Soviet Union claims that
present long-distance detections
systems maintained by each coun
try are enough to monitor a test
ban treaty. The West insists they
are not adequate to detect, ana
lyze and locate all suspected ex
plosion and that on-site inspec
tions are needed to supplement
them.

The United Arab Republic. Bra
zil and Mexico nevertheless
pressed the points made Monday
by India, Burma, Ethiopia and
Sweden calling for concessions by
both sides to got a test ban treaty
signed. Again the pressure seem
ed to be more on the West than
the East.
Mexico's Luis Padillo Nervo
and Brazil's Sen. Alfonso Arinos
de Mello-Franco both supported
Sweden’s proposal that a neutral
arbitration board rule on disputes
over whether a nuclear explosion
had taken place.
Together with the United Arab
Republic they appealed for all
sides to make some progress on
the nuclear test ban treaty and
to abstain from testing while the
talks are going on.
