How can the teacher effectively make his students appreciate
literature? This questioned was answered last night by Professor
Reuben Brower in his Tuesday Evening Series lecture.
Above all, the student must be taught to read perceptively,
said Brower. In an age w hen everyone is deluged with an endless

is made the criterion of good
reading, the student must be
taught the techniques of “read
ing in slow motion.” he explained.
Literature and humanities
courses must be organized in
such away that the student will
become thoroughly acquainted
with the techniques of effective
reading—and, as a corollary, ef
rective writing, stated Brower.

IN FORMER times, said Brow
er, students gained valuable ex
perience in reading and writing
from their study and translation
of the classics. Study of the clas
sics is important for modern stu
dents.

To describe the teaching tech
niques of an ideal literature class,
Brower outlined an imaginary
course called “Literature X,”
Such a course would teach the
techniques of good reading and
writing and endow the student
with a lasting appreciation for,
and ability to understand, good
literature, he stated.
The “Literature X” instructor
must above all be concerned with
what is happening to the student.
He must be concerned with what
the student learns, and he must
not design the course merely as
a demonstration of his own pro
fessional stature, warned Brower.
In addition, the teacher must en
courage the student to tackle
works of great literature: he
should not simply encourage
them to read the “end products
of literary commentary.”

“LITERATURE X” would be
organized as a discussion group,
not as lecture, because classes in
humanities and literature can
never be mass production opera
tions he explained. In addition,
the course must be small enough
that the instructor would always
have time to evaluate the stu
dents’ work fairly.

“LITERATURE X” would be
organized as a discussion group,
not as lecture, because classes in

never be mass production opera

the course must be small enough
that the instructor would always
have time to evaluate the stu
dents’ work fairly.
