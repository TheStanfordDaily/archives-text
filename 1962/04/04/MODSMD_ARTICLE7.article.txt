## 
###

ect in Venezuela. They are Tal
Ray, who received a B.A. in his
tory last year, Stan Morris a
graduate student in economics
and Marilyn Moyle, who received
a B.A. in international relations
last year.
The three are serving with AC

ca. ACCION was founded by a
law student at the University of
California, Joe Blatchford, and is
financed by individual Americans
and Venezuelans.
Tal Ray has moved into the
mining district of the state of
Bolivar and has nearly completed
a community center. Materials

] and assistance have come from
j the mining companies but all the
| work has been done by the people
themselves.
Stan Morris has taken on the
i task of revitalizing the entire in
j dUstry of the island of Marga
j rita. For 200 years the artisans
j have not changed their method of
{ making pottery. Morris has en
j listed professional pottery makers
] from the mainland as instructors,
! built a community center to use
as a shop and classi'oom and be
gun marketing t lie improved
product.
Marilyn Moyle has organized
j classes in English, political sci
ence, sanitation and nutrition in
Maracaibo, enlisted American
| women to teach English in the
i public schools and attends the
j University of Zulia part time.
[ “From this you can see why

ACCION seeks students who are
mature, imaginative and able to
work independently,” Brady said.
"When people work in widely
separated areas on greatly dis
similar problems, sometimes un
der conditions of extreme pover
ty, imaginative leadership is es
sential,” Brady added.
Accion is recruiting ten men
or married couples for departure
in late June and approximately
50 more, including women, for
next December. Participants
serve for 15 months and are paid
all expenses.
Knowledge of Spanish is re
quired for Juno departure and is
an important factor in the selec
tion of those going in December.
Selection will be made shortly
after Easter.
ACCION Director Brady will
speak at Stanford Friday.

tory last year, Stan Morris a
graduate student in economics
and Marilyn Moyle, who received
a B.A. in international relations
last year.
The three are serving with AC

law student at the University of
California, Joe Blatchford, and is
financed by individual Americans
and Venezuelans.
Tal Ray has moved into the
mining district of the state of
Bolivar and has nearly completed
a community center. Materials

] and assistance have come from
j the mining companies but all the
| work has been done by the people
themselves.
Stan Morris has taken on the
i task of revitalizing the entire in
j dUstry of the island of Marga
j rita. For 200 years the artisans
j have not changed their method of
{ making pottery. Morris has en
j listed professional pottery makers
] from the mainland as instructors,
! built a community center to use

gun marketing t lie improved
product.
Marilyn Moyle has organized
j classes in English, political sci
ence, sanitation and nutrition in
Maracaibo, enlisted American
| women to teach English in the
i public schools and attends the
j University of Zulia part time.
[ “From this you can see why

ACCION seeks students who are
mature, imaginative and able to
work independently,” Brady said.
"When people work in widely
separated areas on greatly dis
similar problems, sometimes un
der conditions of extreme pover
ty, imaginative leadership is es
sential,” Brady added.
Accion is recruiting ten men
or married couples for departure
in late June and approximately
50 more, including women, for
next December. Participants

all expenses.
