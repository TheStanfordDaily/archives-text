scientific and medical research.
Dr. Joshua Lederberg, a 1958
winner of the Nobel Prize and
head of the Department of Genet
ics at Stanford, will coordinate the
research and educational activi
ties of the Laboratories. Many
disciplines will be represented in
the research program, including
biochemistry and genetics, as
well as pediatrics, obstetrics, neu
rology and psychiatry.
In announcing the gift, Shriver
said, “Mental retardation is one
of the most pressing medical and
social problems in the United
Slates today. Three per cent of
