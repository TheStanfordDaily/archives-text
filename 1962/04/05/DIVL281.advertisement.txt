“An interest in student
activities can pay you
dividends later on!”
Gibson F. Dailey, Asst, to the President
George A. Fuller Company
“Extracurricular activities never really interested me...
architecture and construction always did. It’s a paradox,
though, because as it turned out student activities gave me
a big jump on my career in construction.
“Studies educated me. But college activities provided
the confidence I needed to approach the business world.
Looking back, it was these activities that really gave me
my first knowledge of people, administration, leadership.
“Working for the college newspaper, fun magazine, and
engineering bulletin taught me writing —a gift I use today
in the promotion and getting of new business. Student
Council brought the chance to work with other men —a
daily occurrence now. Penn’s theatrical group and engi
neering shows helped me relax in front of an audience
then and help me find my voice when I’m talking to
large groups now.
“True, today's heavy college curriculum doesn’t allow
much time for activities. There wasn’t much time for them
in my day either. I burned a lot of midnight oil on archi
tectural studies, but difficult as they were I still found
time for student activities, —l’m mighty happy that I did.
“If you have time during the rest of your years in school
to take an interest in activities —do it! It’s certain to pay
big dividends in an inspiring future in the business of
your choice.”

my first knowledge of people, administration, leadership.
“Working for the college newspaper, fun magazine, and
engineering bulletin taught me writing —a gift I use today
in the promotion and getting of new business. Student
Council brought the chance to work with other men —a
daily occurrence now. Penn’s theatrical group and engi
neering shows helped me relax in front of an audience
then and help me find my voice when I’m talking to
large groups now.
“True, today's heavy college curriculum doesn’t allow
much time for activities. There wasn’t much time for them
in my day either. I burned a lot of midnight oil on archi
tectural studies, but difficult as they were I still found
time for student activities, —l’m mighty happy that I did.
“If you have time during the rest of your years in school
to take an interest in activities —do it! It’s certain to pay
big dividends in an inspiring future in the business of
your choice.”

“Extracurricular activities never really interested me...
architecture and construction always did. It’s a paradox,
though, because as it turned out student activities gave me
a big jump on my career in construction.
“Studies educated me. But college activities provided
the confidence I needed to approach the business world.
Looking back, it was these activities that really gave me
my first knowledge of people, administration, leadership.
