that he had been made “a scape-4-

goat of an unwritten policy of
collaboration and collusion with
the international Communist con
spiracy.”
WALKER, who resigned from
the Army last year after being
removed as head of the 24th In
fantry Division in Germany, an
grily condemned present Defense
Department information and edu
cation policies.
Ho said civilian control of the
military "has been perverted and
extended into a commissar-like

way and convince the military
(hat they support collusion are
individuals whose actions endan
ger the security of our country,”
he said.

cision to resign and fight com
munism his own way.

dent Kennedy of acting as both
prosecutor and judge in his case.
Ho also charged that McNamara

doctrination program to slander
and defame him.
“Secretary McNamara mi s
used the report of investigation

Hatch Act,” Walker said. “This
was slander and defamation of
character and reputation in the
privileged sanctuary of a Senate
committee.”
THE REPORT found that the
general had attempted improper
ly to influence the 1960 congres
sional voting of his troops and
included a statement by an Army
judge advocate that there was
“an over-all indication of Hatch
Act and related violations.” The
Hatch Act prohibits political ac
tivity by government officials, in
cluding military loaders.
Walker testified that he was
never legally charged with any
Hatch Act violation.
WALKER TOLD Senate inves
tigators that the McNamara aide,
Adam Yarmolinsky, a former
Washington lawyer, played a big
part in his removal last year as
commander of the 24th Infantry
Division in Germany.
Yarmolinsky, asked for com
ment on Walker’s reference to
“aiding communism,” said: “My
whole public record points in the
opposite directoin.”

Under questioning by Sen.
Strom Thurmond, DS.C., Walker
further testified that Arthur Syl
vester, assistant defense secre
tary for public affairs, had a hand
in his ouster from the post in
Germany.
