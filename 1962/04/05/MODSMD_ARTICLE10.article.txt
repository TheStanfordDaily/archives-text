# Denitch and Lima Agree: Democracy Way to Socialism
## 
### VIVI BOZMAN 
Both Bogdan Denitch, Bay Area leader of the Socialist Party
of America, and Mickey Lima, head of the Communist Party in
Northern California, termed the expansion of democracy as the
only means by which America can reach socialism.
Denitch, however, charged that communism as illustrated by

Uhe “social monstrosity" existing
in the Soviet Union means not
democracy, but totalitarianism.
C RITK IZING SOV lET society,
Denitch assorted that the image
presented by Russia and accepted
by the capitalist world as social
ism, has been the “monkey on the
back of American radicals.
“Americans reject a socialism
which makes the activities of the
House Un-American Activities
Committee look like a model of
Jeffersonian democracy,” Denitch
stated.
“Not any actions of the commu
nist party or the Soviet Union,
but the success of capitalism, has
been the force which has hurt
socialism in the United States,”
Lima answered.
DEFINING THE means by
which socialism will conquer
capitalism in America, Lima cited
the first step as a period of radi
cal reform and the creation of an
anti-monopoly coalition composed
of trade unions, Negro move
ments, liberal students, workers,
farmers, and some capitalists.
Its activities would mean the
destruction of (he present two
party system essentially control
led by big business and the broad
ening of democracy.
DENITCH AGREED that such
opposition as an anti-monopoly
coalition is needed, but asserted
that opposition is needed not only
to the American system, but to
both the Soviet and American so
cial systems.
He described the American
road to socialism as the strength
ening of democracy, which in
cludes as the right of opposition
parties to organize, the right of
trade unions to oppose the'state,
and freedom of speech.
“WHEN WILE the people of
eastern Germany get the right to
vote?” he asked. “Why doesn’t
the Soviet Union permit an oppo
sition? What harm would it do to
let a few socialists out of jail?
The problem is the movement
they call socialism is totalitarian
ism.”
Lima answei’ed Denitch’s charge
that the Soviet Union has made
irredeemable errors, such as the
murder of millions of people, by
noting that communism has pro
duced a socialist society, while
socialism was unable to do this,
and thus has made no errors in
the move toward socialism, be
cause it has not been able to
begin t his move.
“There are no shortcuts that
bypass democracy,” Denitch an
swered. “I prefer the hard road
to change societies, and I think
you should too.”
Denitch criticized the restric
tion of communist speakers in
America today and praised Stan
ford’s position in allowing the de
bate. The debate was taped to be
sent to Berkeley, where commu
nist speakers are prohibited.
