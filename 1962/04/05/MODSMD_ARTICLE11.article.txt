on: Douhlcday, $3.95, Kid pp

If you can forgive Nixon his
occasional grammatical errors
and lapses into sentimentality,
his book, “Six Crises” is a dra
matic account of his conduct in
the six greatest crises in his po
litical life.
He recounts in detail and jus
tifies his conduct in the Alger
Hiss affair, the “secret expense
fund” uproar, the period after
Eisenhower’s heart attack, the
Caracas riots, the kitchen debate
with Khrushchev, and the 1960
presidential campaign.
“THE HISS case,” Nixon
writes, “brought me national
fame. But it also left a residue of
hatred and hostility toward me
• not only among the Commu
nists hut also among substantial
segments of the press and the
intellectual community a hos
tility which remains even to
day . . . .”
The significance of this quote
is Nixon’s admitting that not only
Communists but also the press
and many intellectuals resented
him.
Despite this admission Nixon’s
reaction to the charge in 1952
that he had benefited unethically
from a secret expense fund was
to say that “over since I have
done that work [against Hiss[
(he Communists and the left
wingers have been fighting me
with every possible smear. When
I received the nomination for the
vice presidency I was warned
that if I continued to attack the
Communists in this government
they would continue to smear me.
And believe me, you can expect
that they will continue to do so.
They started it yesterday. They
have tried to say that I had
taken $16,000 for my personal
use.”
His reaction, which was to
smear critics for their criticism
by calling it Communist-inspired,
is an example of what many Dem
ocrats call “the old Nixon.”
THE MOST dramatic incident
in “Six Crises” and the one in
which Nixon seems most coura
geous and resourceful is the 1958
riot in Caracas where mobs yell
ing “Death to Nixon” nearly kill
ed him. He describes the mob
smashing with rocks and lead
pipes the window of the car tak
ing him and the Venezuelan For
eign Minister to a wreath-laying
ceremony at the Bolivar Tomb.

With the Foreign Minister
blinded by splinters of glass and

the car being rocked so that it
might be overturned and set
afire, Nixon’s Secret Service man
“pulled his revolver and said,
‘Let's get some of these sons-of-
At this crucial point Nixon re
strained the Secret Service men
in fear of the crowd’s being fur
ther aroused by the sound of gun
shots. His car finally broke free
of the mob. and Nixon escaped
unharmed; his political populari
ty in the U.S. was at, its zenith.
' NIXON SUGGESTS that his
popularity suffered during Ihe
campaign because of the econom
} ic slump in October when unem
| ployment rose by 452,000: “All
the speeches, television broad
casts, and precinct work in the
world could not counteract that
one hard fact.”
Since he lost the popular vote
by only 113,000 votes out of 68
| million cast, Nixon might well
| have won the election if Eisen
hower had been willing to create
new jobs by government spend
ing. Nixon writes that at the time
lie had urged such a spending
program but failed to convince
j Ihe President.
In analyzing the causes for his
defeat, Nixon refers to the first
debate with Kennedy on tele
| vision. He believes that during
the debate he had “concentrated
too much on substance and not
| enough on appearance.”
Although Nixon does not blame
| Ins defeat on the religious issue,
|he does write that “Kennedy’s
> key associates wei'e pushing the
I religious issue, seeing to it that
it stayed squarely in the center
of the campaign, and even accus
ing me of deliberate religious
bigotry. They were, in short, con
-1 tributing all they could to make
religion <m Issue while piously in
sisting that to do so was evidence
of bigotry.”
ALTHOUGH he told his daugh
1 ter Tricia that the people did not
! vote for a man because of his re
| ligion, his frank concern for the
religious issue implies a different
belief.
Nixon also appears to be an
idealist in stating that he, in ef
fect, lied to the American people
in saying that it would be irre
sponsible for the U.S. to give aid
to forces preparing to invade
Cuba.
He was forced to say this after
Kennedy had declared that the
U.S. should give such aid. Only
by taking the stand he did could
Nixon keep the operation secret.
He does not' raise the question of
the extent to which a politician
can deceive the electorate for its
own good.
