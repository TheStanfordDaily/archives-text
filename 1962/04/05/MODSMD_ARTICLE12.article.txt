CLARIFICATION
Editor, The Daily:
In The Stanford Daily of Mon
day, Feb, 26, you state, and I
quote: “It concerns whether a
hook, “Race or Reason. A Yankee
View” shall be made compulsory
reading in Virginia schools. Writ
ten by Carleton Putnam, ‘Race
and Reason’ provides ‘proof’ that
Negroes as a race are inherently
inferior to whites. The hook is now
required reading in Louisiana
schools.”
In which schools is this book
required reading?
For your clarification I am en
closing a copy of the minutes con
cerning the resolution dealing
with the book “Race and Reason,
A Yankee View.” Nowhere does
it say that Carleton Putnam’s
book is required reading in Lou
isiana public schools.
Mrs. Jimmy Heymami
Excerpt from Minutes of the
Louisiana State Board of
Education
July 25, 1961
On motion of Mrs. Meade, sec
onded by Mr. Waggonner, the

View” shall be made compulsory
reading in Virginia schools. Writ
ten by Carleton Putnam, ‘Race
and Reason’ provides ‘proof’ that
Negroes as a race are inherently
inferior to whites. The hook is now
required reading in Louisiana
schools.”
In which schools is this book
required reading?
For your clarification I am en
closing a copy of the minutes con
cerning the resolution dealing
with the book “Race and Reason,
A Yankee View.” Nowhere does
it say that Carleton Putnam’s
book is required reading in Lou
isiana public schools.
