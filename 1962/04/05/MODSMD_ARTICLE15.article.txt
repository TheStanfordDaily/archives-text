USED
Editor, The Daily:
I question the wisdom of The
Daily in accepting an advertise
ment from a person wishing to
obtain a “used English girl’s
bike.” It is a foul and heartless
thing to take advantage of any
used girl, but we should be es
pecially cautious with our Eng
lish allies.
And certainly at such a homey
institution as Stanford, care is ;

provided for used girls so that
they do not have to submit to
the indignity of selling their bi
cycles. I, for one, should be hap
py to contribute a small amount
to the care of any used girl, be

she English or not.
John Hatton
