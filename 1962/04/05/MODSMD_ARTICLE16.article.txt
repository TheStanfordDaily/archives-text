# GENEVA
## Walter Lippmann 
### 
Looking back, it can be said, I
think, that in the first round at
Geneva, which ended last week
when the three foreign ministers
went home, all was accomplished
by diplomacy that diplomacy
could accomplish. There was a
recognition on both sides that the
existing balance of forces pre
vents them from making war
and from making peace. Neither
side is strong enough to impose
its own terms on the other, and
there is no compromise in sight
which both sides can afford to
sign. Both the Soviet Union and
the Western powers are living in
a military stalemate in Germany
and in a political standstill.
From our point of view the sit
uation has improved during the
past year. The big difference is
that as late as last June, when
the President saw Chairman
Khrushchev in Vienna, the crisis
in Berlin had a time limit, in the
nature of an ultimatum. Unless
by the end of 1961 the West
agreed to the Soviet proposals
for West Berlin and East Ger
many, Mr. Khrushchev would
sign a separate treaty with East
Germany, and then we would be
faced with the ugly task of deal
ing with Herr Ulbricht about ac
cess to West Berlin, This was the
threat w'hieh confronted us last
summer.
THE THKEAT was withdrawn
during the Rusk-Gromyko con
versations in September. There
were, I think, two reasons. One
is that the President had con
vinced Mr. Khrushchev that he
would retaliate if Mr. Ulbricht
interfered with access and that,
therefore, the Soviet Union could
not divest itself of the risks in
Berlin by signing a separate
treaty. In fact, it would merely
place its most vital interests in
Mr. Ulbricht’s hands. The other
reason is that by building the
wall Mr. K., although it cost him
dearly in the propaganda contest,
reduced drastically the threat of
West Berlin to the East German
satellite. It ceased to be an escape
hatch, it ceased to be a show
window, and it has become a
much less efficient place for in
telligence work and political op
erations.
The net result is that for the
time being the status quo in West
Berlin is one that both sides can
live with. But not forever, and al
most certainly not for very long.
West Berlin remains, as Gen. Ei
senhower once called it, “abnor
mal.” It is surrounded by the
East German Communists who
have the power to make life very
difficult indeed for the inhabit
ants. West Berlin has no settled
and clearly defined juridical ba
sis. The best proof of this is that
the West Germans and the peo
ple of West Berlin require con
stant public assurance that we
are still standing with them.
They need this in order to con
tinue to live and work and invest
in West Berlin. But though this
kind of thing can go on for a
while, it cannot go on forever.
We have only one Vice-President
to send to Berlin and he has been
there. The President has no more
brothers, and that leaves him
with three brothers-in-law and a
wife. Gen. Clay cannot be asked
to spend the rest of his life in
West Berlin.
Sooner or later, (ho freedom of
West Berlin will have to be guar
anteed in an international cove
nant which makes it an interna
tional city under the specific pro
tection of the great powers, the
general protection of the NATO
and the Warsaw alliance, and of
the United Nations.
BUT THAT eventual solution,
although both sides know that it
is coming, cannot now be spelled
out in a treaty which everyone
concerned with Germany could
sign. The Soviet government can
not sign a paper which recognizes
that West Berlin and the corri
dors to it are not under the sov
ereignty of the East German
state. And wc cannot sign a pa
per which says in black and
white that there are two German
states.
All that both sides can now do
is what they appear to have done,
which is to deflate the Berlin
crisis without reaching a Berlin
settlement.
It has long been clear that no
general disarmament policy can

be negotiated unless and until
there is a settlement of the Ger
man question. Neither side dares
to disarm while there is an unre
solved vital conflict that could
lead to a world war. At the most,
there may be possible some paci
fying agreements on the fringes
of the East-West problem, as for
example a non-aggression pact
between the NATO and Warsaw
alliances, an agreement about
outer space, a tacit agreement
about spheres of influence in
Southeast Asia built around the
neutralization of Laos.
AS FOB nuclear testing, it has
been evident for at least a year
that there could bo no agreement
because both sides want to make
more tests—tho Soviet Union be
cause they are behind us in the
nuclear art. we because we want
to stay ahead of them. There is,
as the papers have been saying
in the past few days, some reason
to hope that the time may not be
too far off when both sides feel
that they have learned about all
that can be learned from testing
in the atmosphere. There are sci
entists of the greatest competence
who think that that time is very
near.

The general situation—no war,
no peace—is tolerable but un
comfortable. It is very messy and
for anyone who insists that things
should be black and white it is
nerve-wracking. And yet, consid
ering that the struggle we are
engaged in is the mightiest
which has appeared in the mod
ern centuries, our own position
is sufficiently good that, while

we must be wary, we are entitled
to be confident.

In arms we are not omnipotent
but we are superior and we are
much too strong to be attacked.
In wealth, the Western communi
ty is indisputably advancing fast
er than its rivals. In the contest
of influence, we can hold up our
heads. For the crucial question
in the emerging countries is not
whether they w’ant the freedom
which distinguishes us from a
totalitarian state, but how soon
they will be able to grow' up to it.
