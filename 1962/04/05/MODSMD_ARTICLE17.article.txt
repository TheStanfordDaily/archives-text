Editor, Tin* Daily:
It would like to stress that this
is my personal opinion. I am very
tired of Master Scotty Thompson
passing himself off as the Voice
of Stanford both in the faculty
and undergraduate student body.
I have no personal hate of “red
hotism” and, up to date, I have
not minded the noise that Scotty
makes.
However, when his activities
bring about an attitude toward
our school (which I am very in
terested in) such as the one from
Mr. Lazzatti in yesterday’s Daily,
I become very concerned.
There is a wide gulf between
Stanford and the ivy league
schools and uninformed, antag
onistic approaches, such as the
one made most recently by Scotty
which affect the school and the
whole student body, are sheer
idiocy.

What I'm getting at is that
Scotty ought to start thinking
before he talks, or at least stress
the fact that his opinions are only
his and not those of the entire
student body and faculty. I, for
one, do not wish to have him rep
resent me and my viewpoints.
