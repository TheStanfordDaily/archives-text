# Sigma Chi Favorite to Win Campus Basketball Playoffs
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Although the All-American
teams have been picked, the
NCAA and NIT tournaments
have been decided, and the Col
legiate All-Star game lias boon
played, the basketball season is
still incomplete with the Stanford
University intramural basketball
playoffs. This year so many intra
mural teams were entered that
the regular league games lasted
to the end of winter quarter and
the playoffs had to be scheduled
this spring.
Sigma Chi I has won the play
offs for the last two years, going
undefeated in all their games this
period, and is once again the out
standing team of the intramural
leagues. From the influence of
Bay Area basketball and the
coaching of varsity guard Doug
Clemetson, the Sigma Chis have
developed a deliberate style of
offense, trying to set up one good,
open shot. This strategy has re

suited in an impressive 53 points
per game in probably the tough
est of the intramural leagues.
Nels Christensen, former frosh
and JV eager, leads this experi
enced band of players in scoring,
while Bill Cover and Chris Jessen
are the top rebounders. A back
court trio of Skip Glenn, Bill
Whiting, and Rich Hudkins leads
an aggressive, pressing defense.
After a first round bye, Sigma
Chi opens against the' Studs.
ANOTHER HIGHLY rated
team is Delt I. Handicapped by
the loss of Bill Wakefield, most
of their scoring must now be ac
complished by guards Don Bry
ant and John Issacs. Both were
members of last year’s frosh
team.
The front line features the
height and muscle of footballers
A1 Hildebrand, Steve Thurlow,
and Dick Zinn. These players are
the main proponents of the Delt’s
“survival of the fittest” style of
play, which should survive
through their opening game, a
second round contest against
Alpha Sig 11.
The Theta Delts have estab
lished themselves as a strong

team, losing only to Sigma Chi
this season. Their fast-breaking
offense has continually fatigued
their opponents while they regu
larly substituted from their deep
reserve of players. Guards Munn
Chin and John Wells will lead
their speedy attack against Phi
Delt II in the first round.
Other important first round
games include high-scoring Sig
ma Chi II against Neutrinos. Jim
Shroyer’s 22-point average led the
Sigma Chis as they consistently
scored above 65 points, including
an intramural high of 95 in one
game.
Breakers, 6-0 in Eating Club
play, will meet by far its tough
est competition in a short, well
balanced ATO I team.
THE TOI* graduate team, Cro
Mem I, will depend on its height
and rebounding to get them past
Theta Xi 11.
The remaining first round
games are SRAC vs. Normans,
Theta Xi I vs. Juniporo 11, Cro
thers vs. Geats, Fiji I vs. Rincon
ada I, Alpha Biz I vs. Serra 11, El
Tigre vs. Theta Chi I, and Junip
ero I vs. Burbank I; Medics HI,
replacing Beta Biz I, draws a bye.
