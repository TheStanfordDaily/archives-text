two CTBA games, the Cards have

pected to be more than adequate.
But Shulman is fielding only
.769, and averaging an error a
game. Ferrazzano has seven er
rors and .821 fielding average.

However both have held up
their end in the batting depart
ment. Ferrazzano is Stanford’s
leading batter among the regu
lars at .343. Shulman is hitting
.303, and has a pair of homers.
Jim Chenu leads the club at
.375 in seven games. Jack Allen
is batting ,294, and has driven in
eight runs.
Skip Lawrence is a mystery.
He was counted on to be the lop
hitter, but is batting a low ,175.

His career average at Stanford
is .354.
Three pitcher's have won one
game and lost none. Pete Dixon,
John LeCompte and Bernle
Butcher all have done that. Dix
on has the lowest earned run
average, 1.00. LeCompte and Jim
Lonborg both trail at 1.80.
Lonborg has pitched the most
innings, 30, and also leads with
30 strikeouts, and 16 bases on

lars at .343. Shulman is hitting
.303, and has a pair of homers.
Jim Chenu leads the club at
.375 in seven games. Jack Allen
is batting ,294, and has driven in
eight runs.
Skip Lawrence is a mystery.
He was counted on to be the lop
hitter, but is batting a low ,175.

His career average at Stanford
is .354.
Three pitcher's have won one
game and lost none. Pete Dixon,
John LeCompte and Bernle
Butcher all have done that. Dix
on has the lowest earned run
average, 1.00. LeCompte and Jim
Lonborg both trail at 1.80.
Lonborg has pitched the most
innings, 30, and also leads with
30 strikeouts, and 16 bases on
balls.
Though Stanford lost its first
two CTBA games, the Cards have
two men tied for the conference
batting leadership. Rich Ferraz
zano and Joel Shulman are hit
ting .429, good enough for a tie
with USC catcher Bud Hollowell.
Over-all, Stanford’s won-loss
record is 6-5, with wins over' the
Alumni and California Western
(21, coming over the vacation.
Stanford is batting only ,238 as
a team, but that isn’t what is
hurting Stanford in the won-loss
column. As a team, Stanford is
fielding only .907. At the start of
the year, the one solid thing in
the Card prospectus appeared to
bo defensive play.
In particular, the work of Joel
Shulman at shortstop and Rich
Ferrazzano at third base was ex
pected to be more than adequate.
But Shulman is fielding only
.769, and averaging an error a
game. Ferrazzano has seven er
rors and .821 fielding average.

However both have held up
their end in the batting depart
ment. Ferrazzano is Stanford’s
leading batter among the regu
lars at .343. Shulman is hitting
.303, and has a pair of homers.
Jim Chenu leads the club at
.375 in seven games. Jack Allen
is batting ,294, and has driven in
eight runs.
Skip Lawrence is a mystery.

hitter, but is batting a low ,175.
