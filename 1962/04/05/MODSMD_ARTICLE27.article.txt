# Strong Pitchers Lead '62 Frosh Ball Team
## 
### 
This year’s freshman baseball
team is stocked with a group of
hustling, competitive players
whose prospects, according to
Coach Ray Young, are better than
those of the 1961 team, which
had a 15-4 record.
The team is blessed by a deep
pitching staff, led hy three versa
tile righthanders. Dave Dickson,
a high school all-leaguer from
South Pasadena, is the number
one starting pitcher. In a prac
tice game against the varsity, he
allowed only two runs, going the
full nine innings. When he isn't
subduing batters with his fast
ball and knuckler, Dick’s con
sistent hitting keeps him in the
lineup, as an outfielder.
RICH KOVACKVICH, a 6-3
righthander, also alternates as a
starting pitcher and an outfielder.
Rich’s best performance was his
5-3 win over the San Jose State
Frosh, striking out eleven while
walking only two.
The third outstanding starter
is co-captain Rich Sammons. His
strong arm is also an asset at
third base, where he is a com
petent defensive player.
The relief staff consists of Rich
Brear, a 6-4, 200-pounder with a
good fast ball, and two lefties,
Jerry German and George Ash
more, both of whom emphasize
control pitching.
AT CATCHER, Carter Riegel
is an accomplished fielder with
a strong arm. Behind Riegel are
Carey Cook and Bob Wall, who
is more experienced as an out
fielder.

The offensive power of the
team centers mainly around first
basemen Bill Cox and Dave Ash
worth. Cox, an all-CIF switch hit
ter from Whittier, has whacked
three triples against the varsity.
However, he will start in the out
field due to the defensive ability
of Ashworth, who also hits the
long ball.
THE REST of the infield fea
tures tight defense, strong throw
ing, and good speed. Third base
man Dave Stout’s two stolen
bases against the varsity indicate
his base running ability. He is
backed up by Larry Anderson,
the team’s best defensive infield
er.
At second base are Rich Berra,
an impressive fielder and an ade
quate hitler, and 5-6 Bob Maslow,
who is the “toughest man to
pitch to” according to the frosh
hurlers.
The best batter in the infield
is George Thacher, tin all-league
shortstop from Los Altos, where
he hit nearly .500 for two years.
ALONG WITH pitchers Dick
son and Kovacevich, and catcher
Wall, the top men in the outfield
are Craig Crockwell and Bob
Hartwig. Craig, the 5-5 leadoff
hitler, is a converted infielder
with good speed and throwing
ability. Hartwig’s main asset is
his power hitting. Backing up
these men are Rich Forster, the
team’s top pinch hitter, Steve
Breneman, and Bob Garncro.
Saturday, the team will play
its first spring game, at Jet Field
against Bishop Armstrong High
School.

those of the 1961 team, which
had a 15-4 record.
The team is blessed by a deep
pitching staff, led hy three versa
tile righthanders. Dave Dickson,
a high school all-leaguer from
South Pasadena, is the number
one starting pitcher. In a prac
tice game against the varsity, he
allowed only two runs, going the
full nine innings. When he isn't
subduing batters with his fast
ball and knuckler, Dick’s con
sistent hitting keeps him in the
lineup, as an outfielder.
RICH KOVACKVICH, a 6-3
righthander, also alternates as a
starting pitcher and an outfielder.
Rich’s best performance was his
5-3 win over the San Jose State
Frosh, striking out eleven while
walking only two.
The third outstanding starter
is co-captain Rich Sammons. His
strong arm is also an asset at
third base, where he is a com
petent defensive player.
The relief staff consists of Rich
Brear, a 6-4, 200-pounder with a
good fast ball, and two lefties,
Jerry German and George Ash
more, both of whom emphasize
control pitching.
AT CATCHER, Carter Riegel
is an accomplished fielder with
a strong arm. Behind Riegel are
Carey Cook and Bob Wall, who
is more experienced as an out
fielder.

The offensive power of the
team centers mainly around first
basemen Bill Cox and Dave Ash
worth. Cox, an all-CIF switch hit
ter from Whittier, has whacked
three triples against the varsity.
However, he will start in the out
field due to the defensive ability
of Ashworth, who also hits the
long ball.
THE REST of the infield fea
tures tight defense, strong throw
ing, and good speed. Third base
man Dave Stout’s two stolen
bases against the varsity indicate
his base running ability. He is
backed up by Larry Anderson,
the team’s best defensive infield
er.
At second base are Rich Berra,
an impressive fielder and an ade
quate hitler, and 5-6 Bob Maslow,
who is the “toughest man to
pitch to” according to the frosh
hurlers.
The best batter in the infield
is George Thacher, tin all-league
shortstop from Los Altos, where
he hit nearly .500 for two years.
ALONG WITH pitchers Dick
son and Kovacevich, and catcher
Wall, the top men in the outfield
are Craig Crockwell and Bob
Hartwig. Craig, the 5-5 leadoff
hitler, is a converted infielder
with good speed and throwing
ability. Hartwig’s main asset is
his power hitting. Backing up
these men are Rich Forster, the
team’s top pinch hitter, Steve
Breneman, and Bob Garncro.
Saturday, the team will play
its first spring game, at Jet Field
against Bishop Armstrong High
School.
This year’s freshman baseball
team is stocked with a group of
hustling, competitive players
whose prospects, according to
Coach Ray Young, are better than
