BEIRUT, Lebanon (UPl)—The
I military rulers of Syria relaxed
j some of their internal travel re
j strictions yesterday, apparently
j confident they were in full con
i troi of the country once again.
Damascus Radio reported that
j I he ban on travel between towns
j had been lifted and the Syrian
j airline service resumed flights
within the country.
BUT THE BORDERS still were
sealed and communications to
j other countries severely restrict
ed. Scant information leaked out
through Damascus radio or diplo
matic channels.
Military leaders were reported
conferring in Damascus on forma
tion of a new civil government.
The picture put together from
! sources in several Middle East
| capitals suggested that when and
| if Syria is returned to civil rule
| the military will retain a strong
j hand in the government.
THEY SAID there was little
j chance a new government would
j be as conservative as the one top
i pled a week ago by the military
| coup. There also seemed little
1 prospect for reunion between Sy
-1 ria and President Gamal Abdel
j Nasser’s United Arab Republic.
I The central military command
| appeared to be in full control of
[ Aleppo, heart of a two-day norlh
j ern Syrian military revolt seeking
j to take Syria back into the U.A.R.
DAMASCUS RADIOS first an
nouncement yesterday was a
I communique signed by the army
j commander for northern Syria
j lolling the people of Aleppo that
! any disorders would be met with

“drastic penalties.”
A later communique banned
gatherings of more than three
persons.
An hour and a half later the
general army command announc
ed the relaxing of internal travel
restrictions “in view of the re
turn of normal conditions to the
country and out of concern over
(he interests of the inhabitants.”
