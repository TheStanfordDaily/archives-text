NEW ORLEANS ( UPI i A

Dist. Judge J. Skelly Wright yes
terday to enforce his order out
lawing limited stairstep integra
tion in New Orleans schools.
Wright ruled Tuesday that the
Louisiana pupil placement law is
illegal, and ordered New Orleans
public schools to admit children
without regard to race from the
first through the sixth grades.
“Judge Wright, you have made
your decision; now, let’s see you
enforce it,” State Rep. John S.
Garrett said. Garrett is chairman
of the Louisiana joint legislative
committee on segregation.
New Orleans, as well as other
Southern cities, has integrated by
putting a limited number of Ne
gro students into selected while
public elementary schools in the
first grade. An additional grade
a year is integrated.
By next September under the
placement plan, a few New Or
leans public elementary schools
would have been integrated into
the third grade.
Rep. E. W. Gravelet Jr., vice
chairman of the segregation com
mittee, said the group “now
thinks we have the answer which
will ultimately solve this problem
and help the people thwart this
so-called sociological experiment.”
He declined to say what the
answer is. but announced that the
committee will meet soon to dis
cuss it.
Wright's order was the third
setback for New Orleans segre
gationists in a week. It may have
endangered the south’s biggest
bulwark against immediate and
massive public school desegre
gation.
In his decision, Wright said that
no matter how valid a pupil
placement act may be on its face,
“it may not be selectively ap
plied.”
Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Flor
ida and Tennessee have such
laws. Several of the states have
used the laws to embark on limi
j ted token integration.
Mississippi has no pupil place
ment law, and instead has direct
ed its statutes on integration to
ward closing down public schools.

Wright's order was the third
setback for New Orleans segre
gationists in a week. It may have
endangered the south’s biggest
bulwark against immediate and
massive public school desegre

In his decision, Wright said that
no matter how valid a pupil
placement act may be on its face,
“it may not be selectively ap
plied.”
Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Flor

NEW ORLEANS ( UPI i A
j Louisiana segregationist and leg
| islative loader challenged U.S.
Dist. Judge J. Skelly Wright yes
terday to enforce his order out
lawing limited stairstep integra
tion in New Orleans schools.
Wright ruled Tuesday that the
Louisiana pupil placement law is
illegal, and ordered New Orleans
public schools to admit children
without regard to race from the
first through the sixth grades.
“Judge Wright, you have made
your decision; now, let’s see you
enforce it,” State Rep. John S.
Garrett said. Garrett is chairman
of the Louisiana joint legislative
committee on segregation.
New Orleans, as well as other
Southern cities, has integrated by
putting a limited number of Ne
gro students into selected while
public elementary schools in the
first grade. An additional grade
a year is integrated.
By next September under the
placement plan, a few New Or
leans public elementary schools
would have been integrated into
the third grade.
Rep. E. W. Gravelet Jr., vice
chairman of the segregation com
mittee, said the group “now
thinks we have the answer which
will ultimately solve this problem
and help the people thwart this
so-called sociological experiment.”
He declined to say what the
answer is. but announced that the
committee will meet soon to dis
cuss it.
