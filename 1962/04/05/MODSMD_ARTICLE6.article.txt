FRATERNITY OPEN HOUSES CONTINUED last night as part of rush
week activities. Eating Clubs are holding open houses tonight and
Friday night, with parties afterward. They will also have parties
Saturday and Sunday nights. The Fraternities schedule is similar,
including parties over the weekend at the discretion of the individual
fraternity. Rush culminates with the Monday night pledge dinners,
during which the Frosh men will receive their pledge cards.
