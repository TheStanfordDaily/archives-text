EDUCATIONAL TV: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE
A great deal of nonsense lias been written about educational
television. Following is my contribution:
It lias been said that television allots no desirable viewing
hours to educational and intellectual programs. This is simply
not so. For instance, you can see “The Kant and Hegel Hour"
every day at 4 a.m. This excellent show is followed at 5 a.in.
by “Kierkegaard Can He Fun,” For such lazy scamps as lie
abed beyond that hour, there is a splendid program on Sunday
mornings at 7:15 called “Birds of Minnesota, Except Duluth. ’
So much for the myth that TV gives no prime time to educa
tional programs. Xow let us deflate another canard: that T\
is not eager to inject intellectual content in all its programs.
If you have sat, as I have sat, with a television planning
board, you would know that the opposite is true. I was priv
ileged recently to witness a meeting of two of TVs topmost
program developers—both named Binkie Tattersall.
“Hinkle,” said Binkie to Binkie, “if there is one thing I
am bound and determined, it’s that we’re going to have intel
lectual content in next season's programs.”
“Bight!” replied Binkie. “So let us put on our thinking
caps and go to work.”
■•] forgot my thinking cap in Westport,” said Binkie, “hut
1 have a better notion: let us light a Marlboro.”
“But of course!” cried Binkie. “Because the best way to
think is to settle back and get comfortable, and what is the
cigarette that lets you settle back and get comfortable?”
“1 said Marlboro,” answered Binkie. “Weren’t you listening'.”’
“A full-flavored smoke is Marlboro,” declared Binkie.
“Rich tobacco, pure white filter, a choice of pack or hox.
W hat is better than a Marlboro?”
“A Marlboro and a match,” replied Binkie. “Got one?”
Binkie had, and so they lit their good Marlboros and settled
back and got comfortable and proceeded to cerebrate.
“First of all,” said Binkie, “we are going to avoid all the old
cliches. We will have no domestic comedies, no westerns, no
private eyes, no deep sea divers, no doctors, and no lawyers.’
“Bight!” said Binkie. “Something offbeat.’!
“That’s the word—offbeat,” said Binkie.
They smoked and cerebrated.
“You know,” said Binkie, "there has never been a scries
about the Coast and Geodetic Survey.”
“()r about glass blowers,” said Binkie.
They fell into a long, torpid silence.
“You know,” said Binkie, “there’s really nothing wrong with
w-
OCD
■J kl% shfaf)
a cliclid situation—provided, of course, it's offbeat.”
“Right!” said Binkie. “So let’s say we do a series about a
guy who’s a family man with a whole bunch of lovable kids
who play merry pranks on him.”
“Yeah, and he’s also a cowboy” said Binkie.
“And a deep sen direr,” said Binkie.
“With a law degree,” said Binkie.
“Plus an M.D.,” said Binkie.
“And he runs a detective agency,” said Binkie.
“Binkie,” said Binkie to Binkie, “we've done it again!”
They shook hands silently, not trusting themselves to speak,
and lit Marlboros and settled back to relax, for Marlboro is a
cigarette not only for cerebration, but for settling back with
in fact, for all occasions and conditions, all times and climes,
all seasons and reasons, all men and women. $■ losa simim»n

EDUCATIONAL TV: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE
A great deal of nonsense lias been written about educational
television. Following is my contribution:
It lias been said that television allots no desirable viewing
hours to educational and intellectual programs. This is simply
not so. For instance, you can see “The Kant and Hegel Hour"
every day at 4 a.m. This excellent show is followed at 5 a.in.
by “Kierkegaard Can He Fun,” For such lazy scamps as lie
abed beyond that hour, there is a splendid program on Sunday
mornings at 7:15 called “Birds of Minnesota, Except Duluth. ’
So much for the myth that TV gives no prime time to educa
tional programs. Xow let us deflate another canard: that T\
is not eager to inject intellectual content in all its programs.
If you have sat, as I have sat, with a television planning
board, you would know that the opposite is true. I was priv
ileged recently to witness a meeting of two of TVs topmost
program developers—both named Binkie Tattersall.
“Hinkle,” said Binkie to Binkie, “if there is one thing I
am bound and determined, it’s that we’re going to have intel
lectual content in next season's programs.”
“Bight!” replied Binkie. “So let us put on our thinking
caps and go to work.”
■•] forgot my thinking cap in Westport,” said Binkie, “hut
1 have a better notion: let us light a Marlboro.”
“But of course!” cried Binkie. “Because the best way to
think is to settle back and get comfortable, and what is the
cigarette that lets you settle back and get comfortable?”
“1 said Marlboro,” answered Binkie. “Weren’t you listening'.”’
“A full-flavored smoke is Marlboro,” declared Binkie.
“Rich tobacco, pure white filter, a choice of pack or hox.
W hat is better than a Marlboro?”
“A Marlboro and a match,” replied Binkie. “Got one?”
Binkie had, and so they lit their good Marlboros and settled
back and got comfortable and proceeded to cerebrate.
“First of all,” said Binkie, “we are going to avoid all the old

am bound and determined, it’s that we’re going to have intel

“But of course!” cried Binkie. “Because the best way to
think is to settle back and get comfortable, and what is the
cigarette that lets you settle back and get comfortable?”
“1 said Marlboro,” answered Binkie. “Weren’t you listening'.”’
“A full-flavored smoke is Marlboro,” declared Binkie.
“Rich tobacco, pure white filter, a choice of pack or hox.
W hat is better than a Marlboro?”
“A Marlboro and a match,” replied Binkie. “Got one?”
Binkie had, and so they lit their good Marlboros and settled
back and got comfortable and proceeded to cerebrate.
“First of all,” said Binkie, “we are going to avoid all the old
cliches. We will have no domestic comedies, no westerns, no
private eyes, no deep sea divers, no doctors, and no lawyers.’
“Bight!” said Binkie. “Something offbeat.’!
“That’s the word—offbeat,” said Binkie.
They smoked and cerebrated.
“You know,” said Binkie, "there has never been a scries
about the Coast and Geodetic Survey.”
“()r about glass blowers,” said Binkie.
They fell into a long, torpid silence.
“You know,” said Binkie, “there’s really nothing wrong with

a cliclid situation—provided, of course, it's offbeat.”
“Right!” said Binkie. “So let’s say we do a series about a
guy who’s a family man with a whole bunch of lovable kids
who play merry pranks on him.”
“Yeah, and he’s also a cowboy” said Binkie.
“And a deep sen direr,” said Binkie.
“With a law degree,” said Binkie.
“Plus an M.D.,” said Binkie.
“And he runs a detective agency,” said Binkie.
“Binkie,” said Binkie to Binkie, “we've done it again!”
They shook hands silently, not trusting themselves to speak,
and lit Marlboros and settled back to relax, for Marlboro is a
cigarette not only for cerebration, but for settling back with

all seasons and reasons, all men and women. $■ losa simim»n

EDUCATIONAL TV: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE
A great deal of nonsense lias been written about educational
television. Following is my contribution:
It lias been said that television allots no desirable viewing
hours to educational and intellectual programs. This is simply
not so. For instance, you can see “The Kant and Hegel Hour"
every day at 4 a.m. This excellent show is followed at 5 a.in.
by “Kierkegaard Can He Fun,” For such lazy scamps as lie
abed beyond that hour, there is a splendid program on Sunday
mornings at 7:15 called “Birds of Minnesota, Except Duluth. ’
