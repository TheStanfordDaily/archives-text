# Moslems Seek Own Anti-OAS Force
## 
### 
ALGIKRS ( UPI )—Moslem members ol the Algerian provision
al executive were reported pressing yesterday for an early instal- [
lation of Moslem-dominated “local forces’ to wipe out the Secret j
Anns Organization (OAS) before it sabotages the uease-tire
agreement. The OAS campaign of terror is aimed at provoking

Moslems into mass violence- 1
which would bring French army
intervention and block independ
ence. It almost succeeded Thurs
day in Sidi-Bel-Abbes, near Oran,
when two OAS gunmen killed
two Moslems.
THK SLAVINtiS brought an
angry mob of 1,000 Moslems
seething into the streets. Police,
mobile gendarmes and members
of the Foreign Legion brought
the crowd under control with
tear gas and the demonstrators
returned to the Moslem quarter
before major violence broke out.

Moslem leaders have urged I
t heir people to remain calm in ]
the face of the wanton OAS mur-1
ders and in most cases they have.
But in Sidi-Bel-Abbes their sup
pressed feelings erupted when the
OAS shot two men, one a politi
cal prisoner freed a few hours
earlier.
The OAS terror campaign has i
included a series of plastic bomb- j
ings, random slayings, the firing j
of mortar shells into the densely
populated Casbah in Algiers and
kidnaping and presumably mur
der. Four Europeans and three
Moslems were kidnoped in Oran
Wednesday night and were be
lieved killed.
IN ALGIERS, banks closed ■
their branch offices yesterday in j
the face of a wave of holdups by j
gunmen seeking money for the j
OAS. But even then a gang stole
an estimated $17,600 from the
post and telegraph office in the j
city of Oran. Robbers took $23,-}
218 in seven Algiers holdups j
Wednesday and $3,000 from a I
land bank credit office Thursday, j
Authorities emphasized the
steady tightening of the noose
around the OAS by announcing j
the arrest of Pierre Sultana, said [
to be a member of the OAS com
mando group headed by ex-Col. |
Jean Gardes, the object of an in
tensive search.
