## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) For
mer Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker
wound up a hectic congressional
appearance yesterday by hurling
soft-on-communism charges at
Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
criticizing the CIA and taking a
punch at a reporter.
He said he questioned Rusk and
Walt W. Rostow. head of the
| State Department’s Policy Plan
ning Staff, “with respect to our
constitutional system, our sover
eignty and our independence.”
He also said Rostow controlled
(he “operating arm” of the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency.
KUSH PROMPTLY dismissed
the charges as “not worthy of
comment.” He made the state
ment after a Senate committee
appearance on foreign aid during
which Sen. Stuart Symington, D-
Mo., said Walker made the
charges “without any substantia
tion.”
At the same time Defense Sec
retary Robert S. McNamara him
self a Walker target—issued a
statement defending the loyalty
and competence of Adam Yaxmo-

linsky and Arthur Sylvester -two
Defense Department officials at
tacked Wednesday by the ex-gen
eral.
WALKER, WHO earlier pep
pered such officials as Pxesident
Kennedy and former Pi'esident
Eisenhower, levelled his new
wide-ranging allegations in a sec
ond and final appearance before
the Senate subcommittee investi
gating alleged muzzling of mili
tary officials.
Walker told the subcommittee
that Rusk and Rostow were “very
influential” in framing what he
had called a “no-win” soft-on
communism policy.
He said he understood Rusk
served on the staff of Gen. Jo
seph (Vinegar Joe) Stilwell in
China in the 1940’s during a peri
od Walker referred to as “the
agrarian reformer highlights.”
He said Rusk also was a member
of the Institute of Pacific Rela
tions, an organization that was
investigated by the Senate inter
nal security subcommittee.
WALKER MENTIONED Rusk
and Rostow after Bartlett asked
him what he meant when he had
complained that “the real control
apparatus will not tolerate mili
tant anti-Communist leadership
by a division commander.”
Walker said he covld not identi
fy those in “complete control.”
But ho said “the apparatus” could
be identified “by its effects—
what it did in Cuba—what it is
doing in the Congo—what it did
in Korea.”
Then he added that he could
name some who think along the
same lines as those in “the ap
paratus.” He named Rusk and
Rostow.
AFTER LEAVING the Senate
committee room, Walker struck
newsman Tom Kelly rather light
ly in the left eye. Kelly’s head
rapped against a camera held by
a photographer behind him.
The reporter said he wanted to
ask Walker about a statement by
George Lincoln Rockwell, head
of tfxe American Nazi paxty.
Rockwell praised Walker Wednes
day as he was being ejected from
the hearing room for wearing a
swastika emblem.
