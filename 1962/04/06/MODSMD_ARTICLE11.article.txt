# Organ Recital To Feature Bach
## 
### 
“The German Organ Mass,”
Bach’s inspired conception in mu
sic of the spirit and form of Lu
ther’s basic dogma, will be played
by Kenneth Ahrens, assistant uni
versity organist, on the Memorial
Church organ at 3:30 p.m. Sun
day.
This Mass includes several of
Bach’s greatest chorale preludes.
The introduction, grand and no
ble, and the closing fugue in E
flat match these “Catechism Cho
rales” in the full strength of
Bach’s vivid musical imagination.
Ahrens, presently a student of
University Organist Herbert Nan
ney, also is organist at the First
Christian Church of Palo Alto.
He is a native of Now York, holds
his Master of Music degree from
Indiana University, and has also
studied organ with Dr. Heinrich
Fleischer, Jan Bender, Willem
Mudde, and Philip Gebring.
