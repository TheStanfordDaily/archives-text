# Campus Unions Booming
## 
### 
The fastest-growing academic
institution in America these days
is the student union, a campus
pleasure dome that combines the
best features of the USO, the PX,
and New York’s Lincoln Center
for the Performing Arts. Fifteen
years ago there were only 90
unions in the country. Today
there are more than 600, with
another 200 on the drawing
boards or in the bricks and-mortar
stage.
Across the land there is hardly
a campus union worth the name
without some bowling alleys, bil
liard tables, browsing libraries,
student lounges, meeting rooms,
restaurants, cafeterias, and art
galleries. Other unions have rifle
ranges, theaters, ballrooms, beau
ty and barber shops, and travel
agencies.
FOR SUPKR PLUSH centers
one can look at the vast art sand
crafts center at the University of
Minnesota (where students build
everything from boats to bongo
drums); the swimming pool at
Tulane which features push-but
ton poolside snack service; the
eight-store shopping center at
Oklahoma State; the 1,000-car
parking garage at (he University
of California Medical Center in
San Francisco; the spectacular
views of the Rockies and Great
Salt Lake from the Panorama
dining room at the University of
Utah, and the marble-pillared
main lounge at Pittsburgh, which
is actually the remodeled lobby
of the old Hotel Schenley.
Probably the best evidence that
student unions are coming of age
is the fact that New York Uni
versity last fall began offering a
two-year program leading to a
master’s degree in college-union
management. “Years ago when
unions were primarily exclusive
men's eating clubs, you didn’t

have to know much to run one,”
says Max Andrews, director of
NYU's union. "But today you
have to la 1 a combination edu
cator, publicist, social director,
businessman, and Dutch uncle to
thousands of students. One min
ute you may be worrying about
a youngster who has lost $l,BOO
in a card game |banned at NYU]
and the next wondering what to
do about the doughnuts that a
student forgot to order for a Sat
urday-night party.” (There are
also unexpected crises. When the
Loeb Center opened three years
ago. the festivities were tempo
rarily interrupted by a thinly clad
blonde who had somehow man
aged to make her way into the
building and up to the receiving
line, i
ONTI ISTIMATi: is that unions
cost the nation’s colleges $6O mil
lion a year to operate. At some
schools, the bulk of this comes
from student fees (ranging from
$-1 to $3O annually). But Purdue’s
24-hour-a-day, $l5 million Me
morial Union complex (almost
nine times as large as the White
House) grosses about $2 million
a year from its 257-room hotel,
21 billiard tables, fourteen howl
ing alleys, two theaters, food fa
cilities. and barber shop.
Some colleges, particularly in
the Ivy League, prefer to spread
their social and cultural facilities
all over the campus, rather than
concentrate them in one building.
(Harvard, which opened Ameri
ca’s first union in 1901, has been
using it as a dining hall since
1930.) “Students at Harvard just
aren’t interested in bowling,” says
Frederic Ballard Jr., 20, president
of the Crimson. “The only reason
I can think of for going to a un
ion is to read a magazine or play
pool. And who is going to walk
a half mile to play pool?”
