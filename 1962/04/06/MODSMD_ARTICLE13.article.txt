## Quadros' Support Remains At Fever Pitch In Brazil 
### RICHARD G. OFFUTT 
(Editor's Mote: This is the sec
ond of a series of reports from
Latin America.)

My first discussions with Bra
zilian students centered around
one topic: Janio Quadros and his
significance for Brazil. When
“Janio” or “our President,” as
every Brazilian calls him, resign
ed under governmental pressure
after a hectic period in office, the
international press was filled with
reports of loss of popularity and
prestige.
These rumors must have re
sulted from a poll conducted in
the lobby of the U.S. Embassy.
According to students and other
citizens Quadros lost only the
support of the army, due to his
campaign against wealthy land
owners, whose sons make up the
nucleus of the military officers.
His undiminished fanatic support
is a direct result of his erratic
methods.
As ONE Argentine student,
who has been in Brazil for almost
two years, put it. “Everything in
Brazil is done with improvisation.
I am astounded everyc lay with
new trends and ideas.”
Brazil has been suffering for
years under a rampant inflation,
but the population did not notice
the increasing worthlessness of
the money due to an artificial
price scale, “Janio was the first
to tell us the truth,” said a Bra
zilian law student. “He destroyed
the artificial exchange rate at the
risk of losing popularity. This
move was healthier than it was
speculative.”
For the almost 50 per cent illit
erates in Brazil, who neither
know what the national debt is,
nor are able to read his autobi
ography, Quadros maintains an
equal appeal, especially by virtue
of his “Bilhetos,” short instruc
tions sent in duplicate to the re
spective state official and the
press, and in addition, dispersed
among the non-readers in cartoon
form. Everybody knew for the
first time who was responsible
for unfinished projects, and the

uncomfortable and embarrassed
statesmen were the main topic of
every lunch-hour discussion in
Brazil.
MORE important for the United
States was Quadros’ intention to
take up diplomatic and trade re
lations with the complete Soviet
block. This is, however, easily ex
plained with a cursive glance at
the Brazilian mentality. Brazil
considers herself a continent, geo
graphically and in respect to pop
ulation, and this conviction is
slowly being coupled with politi
cal awareness. Cooperating with
U.S. policy to the letter appears
a sign of utter dependence, “a
U.S. satellite.” Tired of playing
second fiddle in this scheme,
"Janio” saw this “solo” as the
only way to advance to first vi
olin.
“We want to be neither an in
directly dependent partner nor a
directly dependent “peon” of our
big brother in the north, hut in
stead an independent friend.”
“We wish to normalize our rela
tions with Russia and the rest of
the East European nations.”
Quadros’ reluctance to criticize
Fidel Castro was readily explain
ed by the students. Castro re
mains a Marxist and not a com
munist for the Brazilians, despite
all his declarations of alliance
wilh Russia. “We hold depend
ence on Russia as a worse con
dition than dependence on the
U. 5.,” was a unanimous opinion
among the students.
“QUADROS is too smart for
the Russians.” These students are
well-informed about the commu
nist methods in Hungary. Poland,
and East Germany, as well as in
almost forgotten satellites such
as Estonia. I tried, however, to
explain cautiously that, while the
oretically aware of the dangers
in coquetting with Moscow, their
impassioned tactics neglected or
distorted certain practical and
historical lessons. “But you do not
have our problems” was the com
mon answer.

One more important aspect of
Quadros’ policies is his use of
national consciousness. Every

Brazilian is extremely proud to
be a Brazilian, whether a transi
ent laborer in the impoverished
northeast or a socialite from Sao

Paulo. Despite this fact voices
have been heard in the political
arena in favor of dividing Brazil
for economic or political reasons.
This national pride embodied in a
readily evident “national superi

ority-complex” became a parole
for Quadros. This perhaps ex
plains his unprecedented majority
in the last election. His next of
fice is not yet determined, but
looks like prime minister.

price scale, “Janio was the first
to tell us the truth,” said a Bra
zilian law student. “He destroyed
the artificial exchange rate at the
risk of losing popularity. This
move was healthier than it was
speculative.”
For the almost 50 per cent illit
erates in Brazil, who neither
know what the national debt is,
nor are able to read his autobi
ography, Quadros maintains an
equal appeal, especially by virtue
of his “Bilhetos,” short instruc
tions sent in duplicate to the re
spective state official and the
press, and in addition, dispersed
among the non-readers in cartoon
form. Everybody knew for the
first time who was responsible
for unfinished projects, and the

uncomfortable and embarrassed
statesmen were the main topic of
every lunch-hour discussion in
Brazil.
MORE important for the United
States was Quadros’ intention to
take up diplomatic and trade re
lations with the complete Soviet
block. This is, however, easily ex
plained with a cursive glance at
the Brazilian mentality. Brazil
considers herself a continent, geo
graphically and in respect to pop
ulation, and this conviction is
slowly being coupled with politi
cal awareness. Cooperating with
U.S. policy to the letter appears
a sign of utter dependence, “a
U.S. satellite.” Tired of playing
second fiddle in this scheme,
"Janio” saw this “solo” as the
only way to advance to first vi
olin.
“We want to be neither an in
directly dependent partner nor a
directly dependent “peon” of our
big brother in the north, hut in
stead an independent friend.”
“We wish to normalize our rela
tions with Russia and the rest of
the East European nations.”
Quadros’ reluctance to criticize
Fidel Castro was readily explain
ed by the students. Castro re
mains a Marxist and not a com
munist for the Brazilians, despite
all his declarations of alliance
wilh Russia. “We hold depend
ence on Russia as a worse con
dition than dependence on the
U. 5.,” was a unanimous opinion
among the students.
“QUADROS is too smart for
the Russians.” These students are
well-informed about the commu
nist methods in Hungary. Poland,
and East Germany, as well as in
almost forgotten satellites such
as Estonia. I tried, however, to
explain cautiously that, while the
oretically aware of the dangers
in coquetting with Moscow, their
impassioned tactics neglected or
distorted certain practical and
historical lessons. “But you do not
have our problems” was the com
mon answer.

One more important aspect of
Quadros’ policies is his use of
national consciousness. Every

Brazilian is extremely proud to
be a Brazilian, whether a transi
ent laborer in the impoverished
northeast or a socialite from Sao

Paulo. Despite this fact voices
have been heard in the political
arena in favor of dividing Brazil
for economic or political reasons.
This national pride embodied in a
readily evident “national superi

ority-complex” became a parole
for Quadros. This perhaps ex
plains his unprecedented majority
in the last election. His next of
fice is not yet determined, but
looks like prime minister.

My first discussions with Bra

one topic: Janio Quadros and his
significance for Brazil. When
“Janio” or “our President,” as
every Brazilian calls him, resign
ed under governmental pressure
after a hectic period in office, the
international press was filled with
reports of loss of popularity and
prestige.
These rumors must have re
sulted from a poll conducted in
the lobby of the U.S. Embassy.
According to students and other
citizens Quadros lost only the
support of the army, due to his
campaign against wealthy land
owners, whose sons make up the
nucleus of the military officers.
His undiminished fanatic support
is a direct result of his erratic
methods.

Brazil has been suffering for

U.S. policy to the letter appears
a sign of utter dependence, “a
U.S. satellite.” Tired of playing
second fiddle in this scheme,
"Janio” saw this “solo” as the
only way to advance to first vi
olin.
“We want to be neither an in
directly dependent partner nor a
directly dependent “peon” of our
big brother in the north, hut in
stead an independent friend.”
“We wish to normalize our rela
tions with Russia and the rest of
the East European nations.”
Quadros’ reluctance to criticize
Fidel Castro was readily explain
ed by the students. Castro re
mains a Marxist and not a com
munist for the Brazilians, despite
all his declarations of alliance
wilh Russia. “We hold depend
ence on Russia as a worse con
dition than dependence on the
U. 5.,” was a unanimous opinion
among the students.
“QUADROS is too smart for
the Russians.” These students are
well-informed about the commu
nist methods in Hungary. Poland,
and East Germany, as well as in
almost forgotten satellites such
as Estonia. I tried, however, to
explain cautiously that, while the
oretically aware of the dangers
in coquetting with Moscow, their
impassioned tactics neglected or
distorted certain practical and
historical lessons. “But you do not
have our problems” was the com
mon answer.

One more important aspect of
Quadros’ policies is his use of
national consciousness. Every

Brazilian is extremely proud to
be a Brazilian, whether a transi
ent laborer in the impoverished
northeast or a socialite from Sao

Paulo. Despite this fact voices
have been heard in the political
arena in favor of dividing Brazil
for economic or political reasons.
This national pride embodied in a
readily evident “national superi

ority-complex” became a parole
for Quadros. This perhaps ex
plains his unprecedented majority
in the last election. His next of
fice is not yet determined, but
looks like prime minister.

My first discussions with Bra
zilian students centered around
one topic: Janio Quadros and his
significance for Brazil. When
“Janio” or “our President,” as
every Brazilian calls him, resign
ed under governmental pressure
after a hectic period in office, the
international press was filled with
reports of loss of popularity and
prestige.
These rumors must have re
sulted from a poll conducted in
the lobby of the U.S. Embassy.
According to students and other
citizens Quadros lost only the
support of the army, due to his
campaign against wealthy land
owners, whose sons make up the
nucleus of the military officers.
His undiminished fanatic support
is a direct result of his erratic
methods.
As ONE Argentine student,
who has been in Brazil for almost
two years, put it. “Everything in
Brazil is done with improvisation.
I am astounded everyc lay with
new trends and ideas.”
Brazil has been suffering for
years under a rampant inflation,
but the population did not notice
the increasing worthlessness of
the money due to an artificial
price scale, “Janio was the first
to tell us the truth,” said a Bra
zilian law student. “He destroyed
the artificial exchange rate at the
risk of losing popularity. This
move was healthier than it was
speculative.”
For the almost 50 per cent illit
erates in Brazil, who neither
know what the national debt is,
nor are able to read his autobi
ography, Quadros maintains an
equal appeal, especially by virtue
of his “Bilhetos,” short instruc
tions sent in duplicate to the re
spective state official and the
press, and in addition, dispersed
among the non-readers in cartoon
form. Everybody knew for the
first time who was responsible
for unfinished projects, and the

uncomfortable and embarrassed
statesmen were the main topic of
every lunch-hour discussion in
Brazil.
MORE important for the United
States was Quadros’ intention to
take up diplomatic and trade re
lations with the complete Soviet
block. This is, however, easily ex
plained with a cursive glance at
the Brazilian mentality. Brazil
considers herself a continent, geo
graphically and in respect to pop
ulation, and this conviction is
slowly being coupled with politi
cal awareness. Cooperating with
U.S. policy to the letter appears
a sign of utter dependence, “a
U.S. satellite.” Tired of playing
