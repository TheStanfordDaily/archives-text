# PROMISE KENNEDY THEIR SUPPORT
## Stanford Profs Oppose AMA Stand on Medicare 
### NILS WESSELL Associate Editor 
Three Stanford professors are
leading a nationwide attack
against the American Medical As
sociation’s fight against President
Kennedy’s proposed bill for med
ical care for the aged.
Dr. Robert Alway, dean of the
medical school, Dr. Arthur Korn
berg, Nobel prize winning profes
sor of biochemistry, and Dr. Phil
ip Lee, assistant professor of
medicine, joined 24 other physi
cians in supporting the Social
Security system as the “most
practical method of financing the
program of health insurance.
Alway and Lee have just re
turned from Washington where
they conferred with Kennedy and
promised to work for his bill.
According to the leader of the
group, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, 75
per cent of the doctors joining in
support of the President are
members of the AMA, which is
unalterably opposed to the King-
Anderson bill, the one the Presi
dent is backing.
LEE IS “very optimistic” that
the King-Anderson bill will pass
in this session of Congress. He
believes that once a few more
members of the Ways and Means
Committee swing over, the House
is certain to pass the bill.
Lee estimates that of the 220,-
000 physicians in practice approx
imately 15 per cent support the
President’s program. 180,000 doc
tors belong to the AMA, and Lee
figures that only 10 per cent of
this number supports the bill.
Lee charges the AMA with
“distortion of the facts” in call
ing King-Anderson “socialized
medicine.” “King-Anderson has
nothing to do with socialized
medicine,” Lee says. “The AMA’s
charge is accurate only in terms
of its own distorted definition.

“If King-Anderson passes, the
government will be an insurance
company, and that’s all; I can’t
believe that it will lead to gov
ernment control. ’’
REPRESENTING A committee
of 43, the physicians who visited
Kennedy intend to provide other
doctors with the facts on the
present bill. The 43 doctors agree
with neither the material being

distributed by the AMA nor that
coming from the AFL-CIO, said
Lee.

The committee is also trying to
enlist the support of physicians
for the general principle of fi
nancing old age health benefits
by the Social Security system.

“We aren’t absolutely committed
to King-Anderson,” Lee said, “but
it’s a good start. We expect it can
be improved on the floor of the
House.”
Another activist at the medical
school, Dr. Robert Mishell, says
that “at least 100 doctors at Stan
ford and in Palo Alto have come
out publicly for King-Anderson.
The response to this leadership
has been coming in from many
areas in the country.”
Mishell recently co-authored an
article in The Nation magazine
which described the Bay Area
group’s fight against the AMA
stand and how the AMA is
fighting the Kerr-Mills bill.
TO COUNTER THE AMA’s
lobby, the biggest one in the
country, the committee will have
its own men lobbying directly
with Congressmen.
The basis for much of the op
position to King-Anderson comes
from people saying that the Kerr-
Mills bill, which is now law,
ought to be given a chance for
the next couple years.
Kerr-Mills, passed by Congress
but adopted by only a few states,
calls for matching Federal and
State funds and requires the ie
cipient of benefits to have an
extremely low income. Leo called
it “a welfare, public assistance
program for which it is difficult
to qualify.
“Kerr-Mills has done little to
correct the problem nationwide.
It has added only one per cent
more to those covered by insur
ance already.”
SECRETARY OF Health, Edu
cation and Welfare Abraham Rib
icoff insists that the present pro
gram fails to cover all those
needing insurance and that it is
too costly.

Under Lee the “Bay Area Com
mittee for Medical Aid to the
Aged Through Social Security”
has been organized to show Con
gress that there is grass-roots
support for King-Anderson

among doctors.
This committee points out that
the proposed bill provides:
• FULL HOSPITAL costs
(other than private physician
services) for up to 90 days, after
a deductible amount of $lO a day
for up to nine days, with a mini
mum of $2O.
• Costs of skilled nursing home
services following hospitalization
for up to 180 days.
• Costs of outpatient diagnos
tic services, including X-ray and
laboratory services, after a de
ductible amount of $2O.
• Costs of home health serv
ices for up to 240 visits a year,
including nursing care, physical
therapy and part-time home
maker services.
The bill will not interfere with
the patient-physician relationship
or the kind of care the physician
prescribes. Nor will it interfere
with the patient’s choice of phy
sician or hospital, Lee said.
According to the committee
King-Anderson will allow all bene-

ficiaries of social security to be
eligible for aid (Approximately
90 per cent of persons over 65. or
14Vu million people).
THE COSTS OF the program
will be met by a one-quarter of
one per cent increase in the social
contribution of both employers
and employees (at maximum, this
is $1.05 per month per wage earn
er) with no drain on any tax
funds.

The AMA insists in contradic
tion to the claims of King-Ander
son supporters that “your free
dom is a stake. Freedom is what
we all stand to lose. Your free
dom to choose the doctor you be
lieve is best for you.
“And your doctor’s freedom—

his freedom to treat you in an in
dividual way, adapting his knowl
edge and skills to your particular
problems—” is in danger.
“The time has come,” urges
the AMA, “tor us all to stand up

imately 15 per cent support the
President’s program. 180,000 doc
tors belong to the AMA, and Lee
figures that only 10 per cent of
this number supports the bill.
Lee charges the AMA with
“distortion of the facts” in call
ing King-Anderson “socialized
medicine.” “King-Anderson has
nothing to do with socialized
medicine,” Lee says. “The AMA’s
charge is accurate only in terms
of its own distorted definition.

“If King-Anderson passes, the
government will be an insurance
company, and that’s all; I can’t
believe that it will lead to gov
ernment control. ’’
REPRESENTING A committee
of 43, the physicians who visited
Kennedy intend to provide other
doctors with the facts on the
present bill. The 43 doctors agree
with neither the material being

distributed by the AMA nor that
coming from the AFL-CIO, said
Lee.

The committee is also trying to
enlist the support of physicians
for the general principle of fi
nancing old age health benefits
by the Social Security system.

“We aren’t absolutely committed
to King-Anderson,” Lee said, “but
it’s a good start. We expect it can
be improved on the floor of the
House.”
Another activist at the medical
school, Dr. Robert Mishell, says
that “at least 100 doctors at Stan
ford and in Palo Alto have come
out publicly for King-Anderson.
The response to this leadership
has been coming in from many
areas in the country.”
Mishell recently co-authored an
article in The Nation magazine
which described the Bay Area
group’s fight against the AMA
stand and how the AMA is
fighting the Kerr-Mills bill.
TO COUNTER THE AMA’s
lobby, the biggest one in the
country, the committee will have
its own men lobbying directly
with Congressmen.
The basis for much of the op
position to King-Anderson comes
from people saying that the Kerr-
Mills bill, which is now law,
ought to be given a chance for
the next couple years.
Kerr-Mills, passed by Congress
but adopted by only a few states,
calls for matching Federal and
State funds and requires the ie
cipient of benefits to have an
extremely low income. Leo called
it “a welfare, public assistance
program for which it is difficult
to qualify.
“Kerr-Mills has done little to
correct the problem nationwide.
It has added only one per cent
more to those covered by insur
ance already.”
SECRETARY OF Health, Edu
cation and Welfare Abraham Rib
icoff insists that the present pro
gram fails to cover all those
needing insurance and that it is
too costly.

Under Lee the “Bay Area Com
mittee for Medical Aid to the
Aged Through Social Security”
has been organized to show Con
gress that there is grass-roots
support for King-Anderson

among doctors.
This committee points out that
the proposed bill provides:
• FULL HOSPITAL costs
(other than private physician
services) for up to 90 days, after
a deductible amount of $lO a day
for up to nine days, with a mini
mum of $2O.
• Costs of skilled nursing home
services following hospitalization
for up to 180 days.
• Costs of outpatient diagnos
tic services, including X-ray and
laboratory services, after a de
ductible amount of $2O.
• Costs of home health serv
ices for up to 240 visits a year,
including nursing care, physical
therapy and part-time home
maker services.
The bill will not interfere with
the patient-physician relationship
or the kind of care the physician
prescribes. Nor will it interfere
with the patient’s choice of phy
sician or hospital, Lee said.
According to the committee
King-Anderson will allow all bene-

ficiaries of social security to be
eligible for aid (Approximately
90 per cent of persons over 65. or
14Vu million people).
THE COSTS OF the program
will be met by a one-quarter of
one per cent increase in the social
contribution of both employers
and employees (at maximum, this
is $1.05 per month per wage earn
er) with no drain on any tax
funds.

The AMA insists in contradic

school, Dr. Robert Mishell, says
that “at least 100 doctors at Stan

ought to be given a chance for

Kerr-Mills, passed by Congress

calls for matching Federal and
State funds and requires the ie
cipient of benefits to have an
extremely low income. Leo called
it “a welfare, public assistance
program for which it is difficult
to qualify.
“Kerr-Mills has done little to

SECRETARY OF Health, Edu

Under Lee the “Bay Area Com
mittee for Medical Aid to the
Aged Through Social Security”
has been organized to show Con
gress that there is grass-roots
support for King-Anderson

among doctors.
This committee points out that
the proposed bill provides:
• FULL HOSPITAL costs
(other than private physician
services) for up to 90 days, after
a deductible amount of $lO a day
for up to nine days, with a mini
mum of $2O.
• Costs of skilled nursing home
services following hospitalization
for up to 180 days.
• Costs of outpatient diagnos
tic services, including X-ray and
laboratory services, after a de
ductible amount of $2O.
• Costs of home health serv
ices for up to 240 visits a year,
including nursing care, physical
therapy and part-time home
maker services.
The bill will not interfere with
the patient-physician relationship
or the kind of care the physician
prescribes. Nor will it interfere
with the patient’s choice of phy
sician or hospital, Lee said.
According to the committee
King-Anderson will allow all bene-

ficiaries of social security to be
eligible for aid (Approximately
90 per cent of persons over 65. or
14Vu million people).
THE COSTS OF the program
will be met by a one-quarter of
one per cent increase in the social
contribution of both employers
and employees (at maximum, this
is $1.05 per month per wage earn
er) with no drain on any tax
funds.

The AMA insists in contradic

imately 15 per cent support the
President’s program. 180,000 doc

figures that only 10 per cent of
this number supports the bill.
Lee charges the AMA with
“distortion of the facts” in call

gram fails to cover all those
needing insurance and that it is
too costly.

Under Lee the “Bay Area Com
mittee for Medical Aid to the
Aged Through Social Security”
has been organized to show Con
gress that there is grass-roots
support for King-Anderson

among doctors.
This committee points out that
the proposed bill provides:
• FULL HOSPITAL costs
(other than private physician
services) for up to 90 days, after
a deductible amount of $lO a day
for up to nine days, with a mini
mum of $2O.
• Costs of skilled nursing home
services following hospitalization
for up to 180 days.
• Costs of outpatient diagnos
tic services, including X-ray and
laboratory services, after a de
ductible amount of $2O.
• Costs of home health serv
ices for up to 240 visits a year,
including nursing care, physical
therapy and part-time home
maker services.
The bill will not interfere with
the patient-physician relationship
or the kind of care the physician
prescribes. Nor will it interfere
with the patient’s choice of phy
sician or hospital, Lee said.
According to the committee
King-Anderson will allow all bene-

ficiaries of social security to be
eligible for aid (Approximately
90 per cent of persons over 65. or
14Vu million people).
THE COSTS OF the program
will be met by a one-quarter of
one per cent increase in the social
contribution of both employers
and employees (at maximum, this
is $1.05 per month per wage earn
er) with no drain on any tax
funds.

The AMA insists in contradic
tion to the claims of King-Ander
son supporters that “your free
dom is a stake. Freedom is what
we all stand to lose. Your free
dom to choose the doctor you be
lieve is best for you.
“And your doctor’s freedom—

his freedom to treat you in an in
dividual way, adapting his knowl
edge and skills to your particular
problems—” is in danger.
“The time has come,” urges
the AMA, “tor us all to stand up
and be counted on the question of
Socialized Medicine.”

Three Stanford professors are
leading a nationwide attack
against the American Medical As
sociation’s fight against President
Kennedy’s proposed bill for med
ical care for the aged.
Dr. Robert Alway, dean of the
medical school, Dr. Arthur Korn
berg, Nobel prize winning profes
sor of biochemistry, and Dr. Phil
ip Lee, assistant professor of
medicine, joined 24 other physi
cians in supporting the Social
Security system as the “most
practical method of financing the
program of health insurance.
Alway and Lee have just re
turned from Washington where
they conferred with Kennedy and
promised to work for his bill.
According to the leader of the
group, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, 75
per cent of the doctors joining in
support of the President are
members of the AMA, which is
unalterably opposed to the King-
Anderson bill, the one the Presi
dent is backing.
LEE IS “very optimistic” that
the King-Anderson bill will pass
in this session of Congress. He
believes that once a few more
members of the Ways and Means
Committee swing over, the House
is certain to pass the bill.
Lee estimates that of the 220,-
000 physicians in practice approx
imately 15 per cent support the
President’s program. 180,000 doc
tors belong to the AMA, and Lee
figures that only 10 per cent of
this number supports the bill.
Lee charges the AMA with
“distortion of the facts” in call
ing King-Anderson “socialized
medicine.” “King-Anderson has
nothing to do with socialized
medicine,” Lee says. “The AMA’s
charge is accurate only in terms
of its own distorted definition.

“If King-Anderson passes, the
government will be an insurance
company, and that’s all; I can’t
believe that it will lead to gov
ernment control. ’’
REPRESENTING A committee
of 43, the physicians who visited
Kennedy intend to provide other
doctors with the facts on the
present bill. The 43 doctors agree
with neither the material being

distributed by the AMA nor that
coming from the AFL-CIO, said
Lee.

The committee is also trying to
enlist the support of physicians
for the general principle of fi
nancing old age health benefits
by the Social Security system.

“We aren’t absolutely committed
to King-Anderson,” Lee said, “but
it’s a good start. We expect it can
be improved on the floor of the
House.”
Another activist at the medical
school, Dr. Robert Mishell, says
that “at least 100 doctors at Stan
ford and in Palo Alto have come
out publicly for King-Anderson.
The response to this leadership
has been coming in from many
areas in the country.”
Mishell recently co-authored an
article in The Nation magazine
which described the Bay Area
group’s fight against the AMA
stand and how the AMA is
fighting the Kerr-Mills bill.
TO COUNTER THE AMA’s
lobby, the biggest one in the
country, the committee will have
its own men lobbying directly
with Congressmen.
The basis for much of the op
position to King-Anderson comes
from people saying that the Kerr-
Mills bill, which is now law,
ought to be given a chance for
the next couple years.
Kerr-Mills, passed by Congress
but adopted by only a few states,
calls for matching Federal and
State funds and requires the ie
cipient of benefits to have an
extremely low income. Leo called
it “a welfare, public assistance
program for which it is difficult
to qualify.
“Kerr-Mills has done little to
correct the problem nationwide.
It has added only one per cent
more to those covered by insur
ance already.”
