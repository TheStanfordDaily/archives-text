brother, Antonio Paret, and Mrs.

boxer’s 2-year-old son.
THE BOXER’S WIFE and his
mother were reported at odds
over where Paret should be

Mrs. Paret maintained her hus

posed Fidel Castro. She insisted
he be interred in Miami.
Mrs. Paret said she hold no
ill feeling for anyone in connec

“I suppose it’s all part of the
fight business. I don't feel any
thing anymore,” she said.

on Paret in a beating that aroused
protests against the brutality of
boxing across the country. He
was taken to the hospital after
the fight but never regained con
sciousness.
Fingering a large gold cross
and a gold ring on a chain around
her neck, the widow said she
planned to go on living at the
Miami home Paret had paid for in
cash with fight winnings.
The body of the former cham
pion was flown from New York
later in the day and was sched
uled to arrive in Miami at fi;4!s
p.m. EST.
PARET’S CASKET originally
was scheduled to leave New York
at 12:01 a.m. Friday, but plans
were changed when it was found
there was room aboard a jet
leaving in the afternoon.
Paret’s family had wanted the
body to reach Miami as soon as
possible. High Mass was schedul
ed for 9:30 a.m. Saturday at Cor
pus Christi Roman Catholic
Church. Burial will follow at Our
Lady of Mercy Cemetery.

cash with fight winnings.

body to reach Miami as soon as
possible. High Mass was schedul
ed for 9:30 a.m. Saturday at Cor
