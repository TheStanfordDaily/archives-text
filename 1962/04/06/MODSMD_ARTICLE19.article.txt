# Gary Player Tops Masters
## 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (UPI) De
fending champion Gary Player
bolted from the barrier in front
of the entire Masters’ field with
a five-under-par 67 first round
yesterday that put him in a po
sition to become the first man
ever to win this golf classic two
years in a row.

Playing in a cold, bone-chilling
rain and winding up his 34-33
round in the gathering dusk, the
calm, 26-ycar-old Player finished
two strokes in front of veteran
Julius Boros, who shot a 69, and
three strokes ahead of favored
Arnold Palmer, Mike Souchak,
Dave Ragan and Gardner Dickin
son Jr„ all of whom fired two
under par 70s.

“THE LIGHT WAS so bad out
there near the end,” said the
weary but jubilant Player, “that
I had a bit of trouble following
some of my drives.”
Player, whose 67 yesterday was
two strokes better than his first
round 69 last year, collected six
birdies and had only one bogey
in one of the most brilliant rounds
in the history of this event.
“Considering the conditions and
the fact that the greens were
hard as stone, I have no com
plaints whatsoever,” said the five
foot-seven South African who
now plays out of Ponte Vedra,
Fla.

“I'VE BEEN reading in the
papers about what a bad year
I’ve been having, but I think I’m
hitting the ball tremendously.”
Player, attired in his customary
black shirt and white cap and
munching on raisins as usual as
he trod from hole to hole, started
off Thursday’s round “with as
good a drive as I’ve ever hit” and,
after getting his par on the 400-
yard first, promptly birdied the
par five 535-yard second for the
first of his six birdies.
