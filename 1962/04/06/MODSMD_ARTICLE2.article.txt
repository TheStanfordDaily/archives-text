# WUS Drive Closes Today
## 
### 
Today is the last day to give
books and clothing to the jointly
sponsored YWCA and World Uni
versity Service drive. Students of
Pope Pius XII College in Basuto
land. South Africa, some of whom
are remarkably poor, await
clothes. These must bo clean and
in good repair.
The Asia foundation will dis
tribute acutely needed books to
Hong Kong and India. There is a
special need in Asia for education
al matter from the West. Second
ary level texts published after
1945 on any subject except for
eign languages are needed. Clas
sics published before that date
are equally desirable.
Spring cleaning must have
yielded quantities of unused
clothing and books. Boxes, if put
out by the representatives in each
living group this morning, could
be filled by tonight. Such dona
tions can augment considerably
attempts to raise education levels
in these Asian and South African
areas.
