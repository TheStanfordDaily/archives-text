# Trackmen in Rugged Competition
## 
### 
Arch is five feet in front r,f the
nearest Bruin in the shot put,
while Art Batchelder, fourth best
spear man in the country, is a
heavy favorite in the javelin.
THE TRIBE IS favored in only
four of the nine track events.
Rich Klier, ninth best 880 man in
(he nation, should win that event.
Steve Cortright has a two second
edge over the nearest contender
in the low hurdles, and Ken
Emanuels is a slight favorite in
the 440.
The mile relay should be quite
close, but Stanford has a slightly
better time than the Uclans. ’
Coach Payton Jordan of Stan
ford rates the meet a toss-up and
considers the mile relay to be the
event that could decide the win
ner. Jordan reports that the
team is “hale and hearty” and
quite anxious to avenge last
year’s 95-36 loss to the Bruins.
To counteract the bad effects
which rush week always has on
the team’s performance, the team
has scheduled nightly team meet
ings during the week.
