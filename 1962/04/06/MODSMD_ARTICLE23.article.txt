Stanford and UCLA will bo
battling flown to tho wire tomor
row at 1:30 p.m. in what figures
to be as close a track meet at the
Indians have had recently. The
meet will be hold in tho Stanford
stadium.
A preliminary dope sheet based
on the contenders' best perform
ances of the year shows the In
dians winning, (58-63, but the
meet could go either way.
TOP THREAT FOB the Bruins
is C. K. Yang, who is considered
to bo tho world’s best decathlon
performer. Yang is figured to
finish first in tho high hurdles
and second in (he javelin, high
jump, and pole vault.
Two probable double winners
are Mil Dahl and Arnold Tripp,
both from UCLA. Dahl has run

tho best mile and the third fast
est two-mile in the Big Five this
season. Trip has a 9.8 clocking
in the 100-yard dash, better than
any Stanford entrant, and is also
favored to take the 220.
As usual, the Indians should
dominate the field events. Chuck
Barth and Dan Moore are 1-2 in
tho Big Five in the broad jump,
both having gone over 24 feet.
BIG DAVE WEILL, the na
tion’s best collegiate discus throw
er, will bo out to break his Stan
ford record of 188-6 D, set earlier
in the season.
Another record-breaker for the
Indians is Phil White, favored to
win the pole vault. White’s 11-9
vault two weeks ago was a new
Stanford mark.
The Cards should also take the
shot pul and javelin events. Steve
