## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD The
j Senate overwhelmingly approved
j last night a bipartisan bill giving
| President Kennedy flexible au
j thority to advance $lOO million i
j for the financially hard-pressed
United Nations.
The vote was 70 to 22 and came !
after a dramatic assist by Repub- '
lican Leader Everett M. Dirksen j
who warned his colleagues |
against doing anything that
might cause the United Nations
to founder.
THE ILLINOIS Republican’s!
appeal, which included fire aimed
j at some on the Republican side, [
preceded defeat of a GOP substi-1
| tute to put the U.N. aid on a
j three-year loans basis. This vote j
I was 70 to 20.
Within minutes, the Senate j
i gave voice vote approval to the j
j compromise that had been work- j
jed out by Kirksen and Senate
I Democratic Leader Mike Mans
j field. Mont., and permits the j
President to fix the terms of fi- j
nancial help to the world organi
; zation.
NOTING PRESIDENT Ken |
j nedy's assurance to the Senate
| that he would “minimize” the out-
I lay for (he United Nations, Dirk
| sen emotionally told the Senate:
“I haven’t forfeited my faith in
j John Fitzgerald Kennedy. I’m
i willing as always to trust my
President, because he is my Presi
[ dent.”
AT THE SAME time, the Re-
I publican leader bitterly rebuked
j a follow Republican, whom he did
j not name for having referred to
I the bipartisan compromse as
I “specious”—or something decep-
I lively fair.
Dirksen's warm defense of the
two-party compromise worked
j out last weekend by the respec
j live floor leaders and others with
j the White House came as a final
j vote neared on the U.N. bond-
I loan bill.
