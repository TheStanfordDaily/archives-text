# Satire on Heaven, Hell To be Staged in Church
## 
### 
C. S. Lewis’ “The Great Di
vorce” will bo presented the
atrically by the professional ac
tors and actresses of The Bishop’s
Company tomorrow night at 8:30
p.m. in Memorial Church.
According to C. S. Lewis, once
a year the residents of Hell are
invited to become passengers on
an excursion bus that will take
them to the borders of Heaven.
This trip’s passengers include the
cynic, who expects mismanage
ment wherever he is; the artist
who paints for art’s sake; the
nagging wife who wants another
chance to ‘make something’ out
of her husband.
WHEN THE BUS arrives al its
destination, the residents of Hell
are met by their Heavenly coun
terparts who want to show them
the way to eternal happiness. Yet
each passenger returns to the
bus for the ride back to Hell, un
willing to make ihe sacrifice nec
essary for eternal happiness.
There can be no marriage be
tween Heaven and Hell, they dis
cover: only “the great divorce.”
AS THE ENGLISH theatre was
born before the altar of the
church, the Bishop’s Company
will present “The Great Divorce”

| before the high altar of the Stan
ford chapel and will thus show
I that there need be no separation
j between church and stage.
Sponsored by the student Me
morial Church Committee, there
will be no admission charged for
“The Great Divorce.”
President of the Committee
Randy Dales recommends that
everyone arrive early as only
part of the Memorial Church will
be available for seating.


ELIZABETH OFFICER, a native of Texas, is leading actress with The
Bishop's Company and has been active in Company productions
for five years.
