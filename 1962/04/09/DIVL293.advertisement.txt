TENNIS
SEASON
IS HERE AGAIN
To celebrate I am offering for the first
time n spring special sale of tennis rackets.
These are not the usual factory jobs but
rackets strung in my shop os only we can
string them. We have the largest stock of
tennis rackets, in the greatest variety, in
Northern California or perhaps anywhere,
and many bargains. I especially call to
your attention an Italian frame of a make
and model used by the Italian Davis Cup
Stars, the Maxima, strung with a $7.50
nylon, cit only $15.50; a T. A. Davis racket
strung with an $11.50 gut at only 522.00,
or with a 57.50 nylon at $18.00; a Wilson
Trabert, or Slagenqer Challenge 61 model,
at 25 00 strung with the $11.50 gut, or less
accordingly with a cheaper gut or nylon.
