THE MENNINGER APPROACH TO
MENTAL ILLNESS: NO PATIENT IS
A patient at the Menninger Hospital
had been hate-ridden for years. So

anger by hitting golf balls. And it
worked! In this week’s Post, you’ll
learn why the Menningers feel no
patient is hopeless. And you’ll read
case histories from their files.
