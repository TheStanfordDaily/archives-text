# Home from Africa, Prof Saw Revolt
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor DR. JOHN MARCUM Speaker on Angola 
‘‘lt’s part of the system,” stated
first-hand observer of the Ango
lan revolt John Marcum as he
brandished a mallet of about 12
inches, shaped like a crude soup
spoon.

The stick was a weapon, a “pal
matorio.” once used by the Por
tuguese in “civilizing” the Afri
cans and now distributed by them
to he used against the guerrilla
nationalists,
MARCUM, who will address
Stanford students today at 4:15
in Room 320, is Director of the
Africa Program and professor of
political science at the U.S. pre
dominately Negro Lincoln Uni
versity.

A personal friend of rebel lead
er Holden Roberto, Marcum spent
12 days in mid-January in Angola
with George Houser, Director of
the American Committee on Af
rica observing what he termed
“the birth of a nation.”

The Angolese revolt broke out
March 15, 1961, its main impetus
coming from Roberto’s Union of
the Populations of Angola (UPA).
The Portuguese soon declared the
revolt ended. After the announce
ment, no outsiders entered the
area until Marcum and Houser
who found the x’evolt anything
but ended.
“THEY WILL NEVER return
to ante-bellum status without be
ing utterly crushed, exterminated.
1 don’t think the Portuguese have
the where-with-all to do it.” said
Marcum.

"The Nationalists are often pic
tured by the Portuguese as dope
smoking fanatics ... no signs
of this. The people are in villages,

locations unknown to the Portu
guese, moved back from the main
roads where they were original
ly located ... we were wel
comed with open arms, listened
to the people singing hymns, and
leaders giving speeches not only
on victory but the work that must
be done once independence is
achieved.”

Marcum saw organized youth
and labor movements, councils,
medical centers among the na
tionalists, the “beginning of a po
litical state.”

The Angolese army is organiz
ed into small bands of ten to
twenty, with arms coming in
through Congo posts and walked
to bases up to 200 miles inland.
“THE AMATEUR aspects of
the nationalist army will begin
to disappear. Leaders are being
trained by the FLN in Algeria.
The leaders are young. It is a
populist agrarian reform senti
ment with Christian underlyings.”
. . . Missionaries had brought in
ideas and aspirations.
“The theory of the Portuguese
regime was that the Africans are
lazy. To make them work, to civi
lize them the whip or palmatorio

was necessary. In spite of all
their work, the Angolese never
got to say anything about their
lives.”
Leader Roberto is a strong
Baptist and has been cited as a
pacifist. “He's not a pacifist any
longer. .. . Having been con
fronted involuntarily with revo
lution, he feels he might as well
use it to bring about unity.
“THK ANGOLESE have two
objects militarily: to change An
gola from a profit to a deficit
factor for Portugal, cut roads,
destroy plantations; to attack
armed installations, capture arms,
cripple the military, cut the mo
rale of the conscript Portuguese
soldier who isn’t convinced of
what he’s fighting against.”
“I went with Holden, with the
leader of the Angolan terrorists
to an American Protestant
Church during the trip. This is
one of the things that makes him
different from Lumumba. He
knows what he believes, avoided
violence as long as possible.”
Most of the territory appeared
to Marcum to be controlled by
Roberto’s UPA. The other party
in the news, the MPLA of seem
ing Marxist Mario Andreade, has
received Kazenga backing, is “mu
latto rather than African in com
position. No group other than
the UPA has shown an outside
observer evidence of control of
territory. I don’t sec how any
other could get in arms. The Con
go government is sympathetic to
the UPA.
“WE SAW BOMB carcasses
reading ‘Property of the United
States Air Force,’ yet there was
no hostility to America. The
NATO agreement would mean
Portugal could use NATO equip
ment only for European defense.
There was precoriousness, then,
to the open arms that received
us.
“The Soviet Union is playing
this one much smoother than the
Congo. Holden’s party has reject
ed all Soviet aid.”
As of January 13, the UPA unit
ed with Guinea’s nationalist party
into the FACCP, the African
Front Agianst Portuguese Na
tionalism. “Guinea is already in a
prerevolutionary situation. Mo
zambique is next. The FACCP’s
objectives are to a) intensify the
Angolese war effort, b) to plan
and execute armed action in
Guinea, c) to set up provisional
government in the two areas.
THE PROBLEM now centers
around the possibilities of an in
ternal coup in Portugal, which
would make the difference in who
gets the nod in Angola,” explain
ed Marcum.

“Unlike the Belgians, the Por
tuguese will hold on until the
bitter end.”

MARCUM, who will address
Stanford students today at 4:15
in Room 320, is Director of the
Africa Program and professor of
political science at the U.S. pre
dominately Negro Lincoln Uni
versity.

A personal friend of rebel lead
er Holden Roberto, Marcum spent
12 days in mid-January in Angola
with George Houser, Director of
the American Committee on Af
rica observing what he termed
“the birth of a nation.”

The Angolese revolt broke out
March 15, 1961, its main impetus
coming from Roberto’s Union of
the Populations of Angola (UPA).
The Portuguese soon declared the
revolt ended. After the announce
ment, no outsiders entered the
area until Marcum and Houser
who found the x’evolt anything
but ended.
“THEY WILL NEVER return
to ante-bellum status without be
ing utterly crushed, exterminated.
1 don’t think the Portuguese have
the where-with-all to do it.” said
Marcum.

"The Nationalists are often pic
tured by the Portuguese as dope
smoking fanatics ... no signs
of this. The people are in villages,

locations unknown to the Portu
guese, moved back from the main
roads where they were original
ly located ... we were wel
comed with open arms, listened
to the people singing hymns, and
leaders giving speeches not only
on victory but the work that must
be done once independence is
achieved.”

Marcum saw organized youth
and labor movements, councils,
medical centers among the na
tionalists, the “beginning of a po
litical state.”

The Angolese army is organiz
ed into small bands of ten to
twenty, with arms coming in
through Congo posts and walked
to bases up to 200 miles inland.
“THE AMATEUR aspects of
the nationalist army will begin
to disappear. Leaders are being
trained by the FLN in Algeria.
The leaders are young. It is a
populist agrarian reform senti
ment with Christian underlyings.”
. . . Missionaries had brought in
ideas and aspirations.
“The theory of the Portuguese
regime was that the Africans are
lazy. To make them work, to civi
lize them the whip or palmatorio

was necessary. In spite of all
their work, the Angolese never
got to say anything about their
lives.”
Leader Roberto is a strong
Baptist and has been cited as a
pacifist. “He's not a pacifist any
longer. .. . Having been con
fronted involuntarily with revo
lution, he feels he might as well
use it to bring about unity.
“THK ANGOLESE have two
objects militarily: to change An
gola from a profit to a deficit
factor for Portugal, cut roads,
destroy plantations; to attack
armed installations, capture arms,
cripple the military, cut the mo
rale of the conscript Portuguese
soldier who isn’t convinced of
what he’s fighting against.”
“I went with Holden, with the
leader of the Angolan terrorists
to an American Protestant
Church during the trip. This is
one of the things that makes him
different from Lumumba. He
knows what he believes, avoided
violence as long as possible.”
Most of the territory appeared
to Marcum to be controlled by
Roberto’s UPA. The other party
in the news, the MPLA of seem
ing Marxist Mario Andreade, has
received Kazenga backing, is “mu
latto rather than African in com
position. No group other than
the UPA has shown an outside
observer evidence of control of
territory. I don’t sec how any
other could get in arms. The Con
go government is sympathetic to
the UPA.
“WE SAW BOMB carcasses
reading ‘Property of the United
States Air Force,’ yet there was
no hostility to America. The
NATO agreement would mean
Portugal could use NATO equip
ment only for European defense.
There was precoriousness, then,
to the open arms that received
us.
“The Soviet Union is playing
this one much smoother than the
Congo. Holden’s party has reject
ed all Soviet aid.”
As of January 13, the UPA unit
ed with Guinea’s nationalist party
into the FACCP, the African
Front Agianst Portuguese Na
tionalism. “Guinea is already in a
prerevolutionary situation. Mo
zambique is next. The FACCP’s
objectives are to a) intensify the
Angolese war effort, b) to plan

government in the two areas.
THE PROBLEM now centers
around the possibilities of an in
ternal coup in Portugal, which
would make the difference in who

MARCUM, who will address
Stanford students today at 4:15
in Room 320, is Director of the
Africa Program and professor of
political science at the U.S. pre
dominately Negro Lincoln Uni
versity.

A personal friend of rebel lead
er Holden Roberto, Marcum spent
12 days in mid-January in Angola
with George Houser, Director of
the American Committee on Af
rica observing what he termed
“the birth of a nation.”

The Angolese revolt broke out
March 15, 1961, its main impetus
coming from Roberto’s Union of
the Populations of Angola (UPA).
The Portuguese soon declared the
revolt ended. After the announce
ment, no outsiders entered the
area until Marcum and Houser
who found the x’evolt anything
but ended.
“THEY WILL NEVER return
to ante-bellum status without be
ing utterly crushed, exterminated.
1 don’t think the Portuguese have
the where-with-all to do it.” said
Marcum.

"The Nationalists are often pic
tured by the Portuguese as dope
smoking fanatics ... no signs
of this. The people are in villages,

locations unknown to the Portu
guese, moved back from the main
roads where they were original
ly located ... we were wel
comed with open arms, listened
to the people singing hymns, and
leaders giving speeches not only
on victory but the work that must
be done once independence is
achieved.”

Marcum saw organized youth
and labor movements, councils,
medical centers among the na
tionalists, the “beginning of a po
litical state.”

The Angolese army is organiz
ed into small bands of ten to
twenty, with arms coming in
through Congo posts and walked
to bases up to 200 miles inland.
“THE AMATEUR aspects of
the nationalist army will begin
to disappear. Leaders are being
trained by the FLN in Algeria.
The leaders are young. It is a
populist agrarian reform senti
ment with Christian underlyings.”
. . . Missionaries had brought in
ideas and aspirations.
“The theory of the Portuguese
regime was that the Africans are
lazy. To make them work, to civi
lize them the whip or palmatorio

was necessary. In spite of all
their work, the Angolese never
got to say anything about their
lives.”
Leader Roberto is a strong
Baptist and has been cited as a
pacifist. “He's not a pacifist any
longer. .. . Having been con
fronted involuntarily with revo
lution, he feels he might as well
use it to bring about unity.
“THK ANGOLESE have two
objects militarily: to change An
gola from a profit to a deficit
factor for Portugal, cut roads,
destroy plantations; to attack
armed installations, capture arms,
cripple the military, cut the mo
rale of the conscript Portuguese
soldier who isn’t convinced of
what he’s fighting against.”
“I went with Holden, with the
leader of the Angolan terrorists
to an American Protestant
Church during the trip. This is
one of the things that makes him
different from Lumumba. He
knows what he believes, avoided
violence as long as possible.”
Most of the territory appeared
to Marcum to be controlled by
Roberto’s UPA. The other party
in the news, the MPLA of seem
ing Marxist Mario Andreade, has
received Kazenga backing, is “mu
latto rather than African in com
position. No group other than
the UPA has shown an outside
observer evidence of control of
territory. I don’t sec how any
other could get in arms. The Con
go government is sympathetic to
the UPA.
“WE SAW BOMB carcasses
reading ‘Property of the United
States Air Force,’ yet there was
no hostility to America. The
NATO agreement would mean
Portugal could use NATO equip
ment only for European defense.
There was precoriousness, then,
to the open arms that received
us.
“The Soviet Union is playing
this one much smoother than the
Congo. Holden’s party has reject
ed all Soviet aid.”
As of January 13, the UPA unit
ed with Guinea’s nationalist party
into the FACCP, the African
Front Agianst Portuguese Na
tionalism. “Guinea is already in a
prerevolutionary situation. Mo
zambique is next. The FACCP’s
objectives are to a) intensify the
Angolese war effort, b) to plan
and execute armed action in
Guinea, c) to set up provisional
government in the two areas.
THE PROBLEM now centers
around the possibilities of an in
ternal coup in Portugal, which
would make the difference in who
gets the nod in Angola,” explain
ed Marcum.

“Unlike the Belgians, the Por
tuguese will hold on until the
bitter end.”

first-hand observer of the Ango
lan revolt John Marcum as he
brandished a mallet of about 12
inches, shaped like a crude soup
spoon.

The stick was a weapon, a “pal
