# DeGaulle Algerian Settlement Backed
## 
### 
PARIS (UPl)—France hacked
President Charles de Gaulle’s Al
gerian peace settlement by an
overwhelming 90 per cent in yes
terday’s referendum, final unoffi
cial returns showed today.
The nationwide referendum ap
proved De Gaulle’s cease-fire end
ing the seven-year Algerian war
and gave him full powers to bring
Algeria completely along the road
to independence as a republic
The returns showed that 20,-
402,503 of France’s 26,983,275
registered voters took part in the
referendum, a turnout of 75.6 per
cent.
A total of 19,300,026 valid votes
were cast, and 17,505,473 of them
supported De Gaulle, or 90.7 per

cent. No votes totaled 1,794.553,
or 9.3 per cent of the valid votes.
An additional 1,102,477 invalid
votes were cast.

In Algeria, the Moslems who
will govern the territory after in
dependence heard the results with
delight. The Europeans listened
to the reports in bitter silence.
Because of curfews throughout
the territory, there were no dem
onstrations after dark, although
the toll of terrorist killings Sun
day reached 26.

THE HEAVY showing at the
polls was in itself an indication
of the broad support given De
Gaulle. It was the third succes
sive time since 1958 that the na
tion had shown its confidence in
the man it swept into power on
his promise to end the Algerian
war.

Since the result was all but a
foregone conclusion, there was
nothing resembling election night
fever in Paris.

More than 27 million registered
voters in metropolitan France and
the overseas departments of Gua
deloupe, Martinique, Reunion and
French Guiana were called on to
ballot in a nationwide referendum
on De Gaulle’s Algerian indepen
dence policies. Algeria did not
take part.
A CRUSHING majority of
“yes” votes was a foregone con
clusion.

The only real issue was wheth
er there would be a sizeable pro
portions of abstentions or spoiled
ballots by voters who welcome
the end of the 7 3 /2-year-old Al
gerian war but oppose further ex
tension of De Gaulle’s already
considerable powers.
Aside from scattered plastic
bomb explosions Saturday night
and early yesterday morning at
a number of Paris suburban poll
ing stations, the voting took place
in calm. The terrorist European
Secret Army Organization (OASI,
which is fighting against Algeri
an independence, made no at
tempt to interrupt the voting.
THIS CONTRASTED sharply
with renewed violence and blood
sher in Algeria.
In an obvious demonstration
against the referendum, the OAS
launched a vicious new terrorist
offensive across the violence
racked territory with mortars,
machinegun fire and isolated kill
ings of Moslems.
