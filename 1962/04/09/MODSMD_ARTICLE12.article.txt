# Lewis Play Slowed by Trite Spots
## 
### 
“The Great Divorce” by C. S.
Lewis was presented last night
in Memorial Church by the pro
fessional actors and actresses of
the Bishop’s Company of Santa
Barbara, In spite of an intriguing
theme, the play, a satire on
heaven and hell, bogged down too
often in trite dialogue and fa
miliar situations.

The plot concerned an annual
excursion to the border of heaven
offered to the residents of hell.
Once there, they had the oppor
tunity of staying, but none want
ed to make this choice, and they
all returned.

Unfortunately the acting was
on the whole stiff and unconvinc
ing. Tom Mills turned in an ac
ceptable performance as The Ec
clesiastic and as George Mac Do
nald, and Elizabeth Officer was in
places quite convincing as the
doting mother and the ambitious
wife. But Elliot Pugh was often
too stiff, especially in the role of
Dick, the heavenly ecclesiastic
wha was trying to covince Tom
Mills of the error of his ways.
Hal Bokar was also sometimes
unconvincing in the role of the
narrator.
‘‘The Great Divorce” was actu
ally more of a church service
than a play. It was opened with
several hymns and prayers and
closed by a blessing. In between
came the sermon, spoken by sev
eral actors instead of one minis
ter.

The speeches of the heavenly
characters, as they tried to con
vince the damned to remain in
heaven furnished Lewis with his
opportunity for preaching. This
ws especially evident in the
speeches of George Mac Donald,
the Scottish philosopher, who at
tempted to explain love, happi
ness, and eternity among other
subjects.
Some of the ideas presented in
the play were interesting and
thought-provoking, but they were
hampered by the all-too-familiar
characterizations such as the dot
ing mother and the ambitious
wife. Some lines in these two
segments wore amusing, but on
the whole they had little to say.

often in trite dialogue and fa
miliar situations.

The plot concerned an annual
excursion to the border of heaven
offered to the residents of hell.
Once there, they had the oppor
tunity of staying, but none want
ed to make this choice, and they
all returned.

Unfortunately the acting was
on the whole stiff and unconvinc
ing. Tom Mills turned in an ac
ceptable performance as The Ec
clesiastic and as George Mac Do
nald, and Elizabeth Officer was in
places quite convincing as the
doting mother and the ambitious
wife. But Elliot Pugh was often
too stiff, especially in the role of
Dick, the heavenly ecclesiastic
wha was trying to covince Tom
Mills of the error of his ways.
Hal Bokar was also sometimes
unconvincing in the role of the
narrator.
‘‘The Great Divorce” was actu
ally more of a church service
than a play. It was opened with
several hymns and prayers and
closed by a blessing. In between
came the sermon, spoken by sev
eral actors instead of one minis
ter.

The speeches of the heavenly
characters, as they tried to con
vince the damned to remain in
heaven furnished Lewis with his
opportunity for preaching. This
ws especially evident in the
speeches of George Mac Donald,
the Scottish philosopher, who at
tempted to explain love, happi
ness, and eternity among other
subjects.
Some of the ideas presented in
the play were interesting and
thought-provoking, but they were
hampered by the all-too-familiar
characterizations such as the dot
ing mother and the ambitious
wife. Some lines in these two
segments wore amusing, but on
the whole they had little to say.
