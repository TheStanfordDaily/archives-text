Todav The Daily is beginning a five-part series about pressures
exerted on Stanford bv right-wing elements among its alumni.
The articles are fully documented and have been written largely
from University files.
The first two articles consist almost entirely of excerpts from
letters from alumni complaining about various activities at Stan
ford and from answers they received from the administration.
Names ol the alumni will not, of course, be used. The third and
fourth articles w ill be concerned with one specific incident which
is both recent and controversial. The last article will lie an inter
view with several members of the administration.
No editorial opinion is expressed in any of the articles, and
interpretation and explanation have been kept to a minimum. We
feel the letters and statements speak for themselves and urge yon
to read them carefully.
The Daily is in great debt to several people in the administra
tion and on the faculty who gave their complete cooperation in
the preparation of this series, Kspecial thanks must go to Lyle
Nelson, Director of Universih Relations, and to Donald Carlson
and Robert Miller, Associate Directors of University Relations.
