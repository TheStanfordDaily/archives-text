# STANFORD AND THE RIGHT-WING
## Alumna's Objections to Left-Wing Influences on Campus 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is (he first
of five articles. See Editorial.)
Perhaps the longest corre
spondence that (he Stanford ad
ministration has ever had with an
alumnus who was concerned with
alleged Communist and left-wing
influences on the University be
gan last year.
Mrs. A. of Los Angeles last
June wrote a three-page, single
spaced letter to Stanford Presi
dent Wallace Sterling and sent a
copy to Thomas Pike, president of
the Board of Trustees.
IN THE letter Mrs. A. said she
was upset “to realize . . . that
Stanford today stands with Har
vard in leadership of reactionary
thought and teaching in our coun
try.” She goes on to explain that
by “reactionary” she means the
economics of Keynes and the pol
itics of the Welfare State.
Of the Ford Foundation. Stan
ford’s $25 million benefactor, she
says, “|it) influences nearly every
aspect of American life, and
. . . appears to have probed, par
ticipated and subtly directed
many facets . . .” Stanford, she
says, is “inextricably involved”
with the Foundation. Then she
becomes more specific.
“Some time ago I bumped
abruptly into the present version
of some of these truths | being
taught at Stanford | via the per
versions of educationists who
plan and prepare for the instruc
tion of our youth. Note I did not
say education.
“MV OWN children were receiv
ing a distorted view of American
and United States history and the
unique factors which made our
country great, efficient, rich,
ever-Godfearing and God-loving.
I couldn't effectively point out
what was wrong because recogni
tion of the subtleties of misdirec
tion was made deliberately diffi
cult for the average parent, un
less alerted to the slant.
“Analyzing my own deficien
cies, I realized my own attitudes
had been similarly though more
thoroughly tainted. My father
gently pointed out that: despite
my Phi Beta Kappa key he had
considered me a pinko for many
years after my graduation from
Stanford. There and then I under
took a personal brainwash of my
self in conjunction with a study
of the historical setting, the peo
ple and the influences which have
brought our country and its peo
ple to heel.”
Mrs. A. then spends a long
paragraph describing the state
she dislikes. It is “typically Eu
ropean," guided by man, not God.
scientifically planned not free en
terprise, stresses democracy not
“our own representative repub
lic,” propounds the philosophy
that nothing is constant but
change, and so on.
“IT is my impression,” she con
tinues, “ . . . that this secular
approach, Marxian philosophy,
economic determinism, and the
preachment of the inevitability of
World Government continue to
be reflected in the present teach
ing at Stanford. Small wonder if
there is so far no effective alum
ni protest, since most of us would
not recognize the fallacies in

volved because we were well in
doctrinated in (hem during our
own years at Stanford.”
The rest of the letter Mrs. A.
devotes to hoping that Stanford
will clean house.
"May 1 suggest an ‘antidote’
course in every department of
learning, where feasible, to pre
sent brilliantly and factually the
‘other side of the coin’ and then
let the chips fall where they may.
“FOR INSTANCE: “Constitu
tion vs. U.N. Charter Why They
Are Totally Incompatible.' ‘Social
ism vs. Private Free Enterprise -
Why They Are Totally Incompati
ble' ...”
The letter is signed “Hopefully
and sincerely.”
President Sterling was in Lon
don when Mrs. A.’s letter was re
ceived. A four and one-half-page
answer was written by presiden
tial assistant, Frederic O. Glover.
In it he quoted extensively from
a letter Sterling had written ear
lier in answer to a letter similar
to Mrs. A.’s.
IN PART the letter says, “We
aspire always, of course, to ob
jectivity in performance of both
teaching and research. In teach
ing, we do not and should not pro
hibit the instructor from present
ing his conclusions and interpre
tations of factual material: but
we can, and we try to, insist that
he shall not oblige the student
to accept his conclusions as the
valid interpretation.
“If society, through govern
ment, group or individual pres
sures were to curtail or destroy
this freedom to teach fairly and
to investigate adventurously, our
colleges and universities would
cease to serve society as they
should and can.
“One of the great difficulties
is this; Society at large has vir
tually no quarrel with that phase
of university activities which
deals with engineering and sci
ence. And this is not necessarily
because society understands the
code and method by which scien
tists work, but lather because so
ciety gains, from the end prod
ucts of science, gadgets of all
sorts which society finds useful
.. . and concludes, therefore,
that science is good.
“BUT WHEN the economist,
political scientist or sociologist
working by the same code and
method advances a new theory or
interpretation, he is likely to be
characterized as a radical. And
the reason is this: that he cannot
test his theory in a laboratory
except society itself, and society
normally reacts adversely to sug
gested changes in its own culture
and organization ...”
The letter goes on at length in
defense of the presentation of
various ideas with the censorship
of none and it closes with a plea
for the private university in gen
eral.
Trustee Chairman Thomas
Pike also wrote an answer to
Mrs. A. It was much shorter, less
than a page, and said, “I want
to add a personal word of assur
ance that the Board of Trustees
is alert to the dangers of possible
Communist infiltration in these
difficult days in which we live.

“THE BOARD is aware also
l hat what President Sterling often
refers to as ‘honest dissent’ can
easily be misinterpreted by people
who disagree with positions taken
on any given issue; this right to
honest disagreement needs the
defense of all of us who believe
in the personal liberties guaran
teed by the U.S. Constitution.”
Mrs. A. was far from satisfied
with the letters she received from
Glover and Pike. Another letter
to Pike came soon after.
After saying she must have
been misunderstood, Mrs. A. says,
“The ‘reprint letter’ of Dr. Ster
ling’s is not an adequate response
Furthermore I was shocked at
the issue of Stanford Today (an
alumni magazine) in which Dr.
(Ralphi Bunche (UN official and
Nobel Peace Prize winner) was
virtually adulated! I have sent

| that magazine an extensive docu
mentation of Dr. Bunche. His re
] cent utterances are reverse rac
ism. ...”
PIKE ASKED for another let
ter to be drafted above his name.
This one said. “Teachers do not
advocate in the classroom; we
have no one teaching partisan
politics from the classroom plat
form. Of course, a teacher has
the right of any citizen, outside
the classroom, to speak his mind
on matters of national interest;
this is a constitutional right
which I am sure you would not
want to curtail. Certainly you are
exercising your own right to ex
press your views as a citizen,
and more power to you.”
Pike also defended Bundle's ap
pearance at Stanford and the ar
ticle in Stanford Today, saying,
“We have received many favor
able alumni comments. ...” He
closed by saying that Christian

Mentor, then Secretary of State,
would ho speaking at Stanford
tins year.
Two weeks later, Mrs. A. wrote
for the last time. In a letter to
Pike, she asked for a letter from
President Sterling, refuted Pike’s
defense of Bundle and attacked
the University for allowing Sen.
William Fulbright to speak on
campus and for inviting Herter.
AT THIS point nobody in the
administration knew what to do.
Pike was puzzled and ready to
give up, Glover was out of ideas.
Lyle Nelson. Director of Univer
sity Relations, being new, came
up with the answer and saved
the day.
At Nelson’s suggestion. Pike
and Sterling both sent Mrs. A.
letters asking her to come up to
the University to talk about it.
She was never heard from again.
