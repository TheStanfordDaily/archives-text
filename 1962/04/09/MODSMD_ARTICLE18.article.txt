# YANG SCORES 19 FOR BRUINS
## Card Harriers Edge UCLA 
### PETE KING 
The* season’s host time by (ho
mile relay team and a couple of
key upsets in the other running
events gave Stanford a narrow
68-63 victory over UCLA and C. K.
Yang in a track moot here Satur
day.
The Indians had to overcome a
19-point performance by (he ver-

Tieket applications for the
IJSA-IJSSK track moot may

ment of Athletics. Tickets are
.S<> for the two-day reserved

satile Yang, who entered seven
events, won three, and placed
second and third in two others.
The mile relay team of Phil
Latnoreaux, Rich Klier, Rich
Chesarek, and Ken Emanuels ran
completely away from the help
less Bruins, winning by more
than six seconds in their best
lime of the year, 3:14.6. Klier,
who was voted to the second spot
on the relay team by his team
males, ran a 15-foot lead into a
25-yard gap and UCLA could
never catch up.
IT TOOK TWO outstanding ef
forts by Phil Lamoreaux and Hai -
ry McCalla to turn the tide for
Stanford. Lamoreaux, picked to
finish second to the Bruins’ Ar
nold Tripp in the 220-yard dash,
poured on a tremendous hurst of
speed in the final 10 yards to
squeeze past a startled Tripp anti
win in 22 seconds flat. Winston

Doby of UCLA edged out his
teammate for second place.
McCalla. who was expected to
finish second to UCLA's Mil Dahl
in the two-mile, furnished the

crowd of 4000 with one of the
most thrilling races of the after
noon. After dueling with Dahl for
seven and a half laps, McCalla
fell behind in the final turn, but
extracted an extra ounce of en
ergy to pull abreast of Dahl and
win by a foot.
Earlier, Yang had pulled an
upset by besting Stanford’s Art
Hatchelder in the javelin with a
heave of 221-u'l'. He followed
that with a surprise victory in
the 220-yard low hurdles, an
event which he had not run pre
viously this year. Yang’s time
was 23,9, just beating teammate
Mike Tisdale’s 21 flat. Steve
Cortright took third for the In
dians.

Tin: AMAZING YANG also
won the 120-yard high hurdles in
14.4, with Cortrighl and Tisdale
coming in second and third, re
spectively.
Pole vaulter Phil White soared
over the bar at half an inch over
15 feet, ;t new Stanford record.
He made an attempt at 15-4, but
barely knocked the bar off on his
way down. UCLA’s Yang vaulted
14-6, best of his life, for second
place. Roger Rhoads of Stanford
cleared 12-6, his best, for third.
