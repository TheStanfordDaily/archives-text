Flanagan beat the Cards.
In the seeond game, Santa
Clara broke to a 7-0 lead after
five innings, mainly on the hitting
of John Giavanola, who got three
hits, including a homer. Stanford
scored four in the sixth and had
Santa Clara starting pitcher Mar
cenero on the ropes in the last
inning, hut relief pitcher Dan
Korhel put the Cards down on a
strikeout and a double play.
Friday, Stanford went behind
1-0 on UCLA freshman first-base
man Gale Goodrich’s run scoring
single, hut lied it up in the eighth
on Jim Chenu's double. The

Bruins got two in the eleventh
to end it.
STANFORD'S WEAK hitting
wasted beautiful hurling by Jim
Lonhorg, who pitched all 11 in
nings, giving up only seven hits
and striking out 13.
Stanford’s sloppy baseruning
didn’t help either. Two men weir l
picked off third, once with the
bases loaded.
Tragedy almost marred the
UCLA game, when a foul ball
landed in the crib of Stanford
pitcher John LeCompte’s baby.
The ball missed the child by
inches.
