# LASSU Checks New Constitution
## 
### 
LASSU will meet tonight to
consider the proposed ASSU Con
stitution for the last time. The
session is expected to last into
the morning hours.
Each section except the legis
lative section of the constitution
has been passed by a majority of
LASSU. The complete constitu
tion must be passed by a two
thirds vote of LASSU, then ap
proved by the student body in
spring elections.
Bob Sayler, ASSU President,
expected the legislative section
and the judicial section, among
others, to cause controversy. The
problem in the judicial section is
in selecting the judicial board.
The legislative section contains
the most radical change, accord
ing to Sayler. It would have
LASSU representatives elected
from living groups, making a
120-man body.
Graduates, 40 per cent of the
student body, would be allotted
40 per cent, of the representatives.
If fewer graduates than that were
interested, the extra seats would
remain vacant. No one would
have more than one vote.

Sayler declined to predict the
meeting’s outcome, professing in
ability as a prophet.
