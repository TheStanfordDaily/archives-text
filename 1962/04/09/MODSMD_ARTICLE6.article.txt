# SHRIVER:
## Corps Sets New Visions 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
Peace Corps volunteers return
ing from their two-year tours
“can open up a whole new vision
of the world as it really is” and
have a great effect on commerce,
education, labor and government,
Director Sargent Shriver predict
ed Friday night.
Shriver said the Peace Corps is
a success because “it’s a volun
teer operation”—made up of peo
ple who will serve under difficult
conditions, hard work and health
hazards for $75 a month.
In spite of the hardships, the
Corps is getting more volunteers
than when it was first announced,
and they are higher in quality,
Shriver told a capacity audience
in Dinkelspiel.
We have to learn the language
of people in other countries to get
close to them and show them our
way of life and ideals of the dig
nity of man, Shriver explained.
He called the volunteers “real
patriots” who realize the United
States is in a difficult situation
in the world today.
“THESE Americans are loved
and liked,” Shriver declared.
Wherever the Peace Corps has
gone, every country has asked
the number of people to be
doubled or tripled, he said.
“You can expect great things
for our country.” when returning
Peace Corps volunteers transmit
their knowledge of other coun
tries to Americans here, Shriver
promised.
Shriver said Peace Corps vet
erans, as well as being sought by
the State Department and U.S.
Information Agency, will be valu
able in business by knowing how
to present American business
properly in other countries. “The
president of Pepsi Cola wants to
know how to get them,” ho quip
ped.
Asserting Peace Corps austeri
ty, Shriver said they bought only
one passenger car and spent
$l6OO on entertaining Washing
ton dignitaries although Congress
authorized 17 cars and $8,500.
CONGRESSMEN "couldn’t be
lieve a federal bureaucracy could
have all that money and not spend
it,” Shriver remarked.
Shriver said no Peace Corps
members have access to P.X.,
commissary or fancy cars. Ameri
cans living in wealth abroad
“don’t create the impression we
want, so we outlaw all that,” he
said.
Shriver announced Stanford
senior Lucy Ames will be as
signed to permanent staff duty
with the Corps in Puerto Rico
after June graduation.
Shriver, whose wife Eunice is
a Stanford graduate, claimed the
Corps is really a success because
it started with more graduates
from Stanford than any place
else.
“THE PEACE Corps is one of
the greatest opportunities for
women this country has over
had,” giving them a chance to do
constructive work where they
are really needed, Shriver as
serted.

The Corps has “the Stanford
Ratio,” one-third of its members
women, he noted.
