# Sponsor Recruiting Starts
## 
### 
Men and women interested in
being sponsors next year in one
of the freshman halls may now
apply. Anyone who will be a jun
ior or senior next year is eligible
for application.
The sponsor selection commit
tees wish to emphasize the im
portance of sponsoring in the
freshman program and encour
age all interested students to ap
ply.
Says head Wilbur sponsor Jer
ry Puttier, “The sponsor’s task
is a difficult one to define. His
goal is to aid in acquainting
freshmen with all of the oppor
tunities of the Stanford commu
nity intellectual, social, and cul
tural- -and assist, where possible,
their personal growth in the uni
versity environment.
lIIS MAJOR contribution is in
the construction each year of a
framework for the freshman pro
gram in which the incoming stu
dents may find their first year at
Stanford a challenging and pro
ductive one.

“The application and an inter
view are the first steps in the
selection of next year’s sponsors.
During the interview the selec
tion committee, composed of a

group of the present sponsor’s,
looks for men and women with a
grasp of the goals and purposes
of the university, who are ap
proachable and can work on close
terms with a wide variety of stu
dents, and who will be willing to
devote a good deal of time to the
job.

“THE SPONSORS who are se
lected are notified by mail during
the last week of April. Several
orientation sessions to acquaint;
the new sponsors with their re
sponsibilities are held during the
latter half of spring quarter,
headed by a weekend hostel in
the Santa Cruz mountains with
the rest of the coming year’s
sponsors. The following year 1
sponsors return to campus a few
days before the freshmen arrive
for additional preliminary prep
aration.

“Sponsoring is a challenging
and demanding endeavor; it is
also one of the most rewarding
experiences a student can have
at Stanford. All interested stu
dents are encouraged to apply.”
