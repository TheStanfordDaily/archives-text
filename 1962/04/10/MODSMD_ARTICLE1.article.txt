# Campus Is Awakening to Foreign Student's Problems
## 
### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
(Editor’s Note: This is the first
of a four-part series on campus
activities and problems concern
ing foreign students.)

As tensions mount in the inter
national scene, the U.S. is being
jolted out of its complacent atti
tude toward foreign students.
The Stanford campus, along
with the nation, is slowly, pain
fully awakening to its many un
solved problems concerning for
eign students.

What are these problems, what
are we doing to meet them, and
what do we need to do will bo dis
cussed in this and the following
three articles.

Five months ago a Special For
eign Student Scholarship Com
mute was formed to help the
President’s committee on Foreign

Students and Visitors find out
where Stanford was spending
money on foreign scholars, who
was receiving this money and
what were the results.

THE COMMITTEE, comprised
of administration, faculty and
students included Dean Albert
Bowker, Dean William Craig,
Prof. Ray Linsley, Prof. George
Spindler, Fred Glover, Robert
Rehder, Pete Millini, Don Light,
Pat Falk, Joel Meister, Marie
Prior, and Bob Sayler.
As they started their investiga
tion, they found they had no one
to turn to for the answers. They
found no policy, purpose or direc
tion to the foreign student pro
gram. Although a large variety of
scattered foreign student pro
grams existed, no one seemed to
know about them all.

Stanford is by no moans alone
in its struggle to coordinate the
efforts of the variety of people
who have sprung to meet the
needs which a large foreign stu

dent population presents.
The foreign demand for educa
tion has risen sharply in the past
few years and has caught our
universities unprepared to meet
the challenge of educating more
than Americans.

FORTUNATELY, Stanford has
recognized that it has a problem
to meet which will grow by leaps
and bounds in the near future.
The Committee decided to find
out everything it could about
what Stanford now has for a for
eign student program in order to
lay the groundwork for a more
coordinated, directed policy which
will enable the University to cope
with the challenge ahead.
The first step was to take a
departmental survey to find out
what foreign students were study
ing. where they were from, and
what some of their problems
were. The survey revealed that
29 departments had over 5 foreign
students enrolled, and 8 were
planning programs for the near

future.
THE COMMITTEE discovered
programs which many people
have never heard of such as the
Russian Exchange Program
which offers a full travel, tuition
and expense scholarship for
American students to go to Rus
sia, and Russian students to come
to America. Although three Rus
sians are studying at Stanford on
this program, no Stanford stu
dents have applied to study in
Russia, according to Dr. David
Heebink, recently appointed co
ordinator for the program.

The Committee found much du
plication of efforts between the
departments with the same com
plaints issuing from many areas.
For instance, every department
complained of the need for better
criteria for selection of foreign
students, since letters of recom
mendation and grades are mean
ingless when coming from an un
known school.
EACH DEPARTMENT has had

to meet this problem in its own
way, apparently with unsatisfy
ing results. One department sim
ply “rejects all Indians since it
has found it cannot evaluate
them.”

One suggestion for alleviating
this problem was to make a cen
tral adviser available to the vari
ous departments who would know
more about how to evaluate the
records of foreign students.
The evidence points to the need
for more and better coordination
of the variety of programs. Pri
vate foundations and governmen
tal agencies, which are devoting
an ever-increasing amount of
money and attention to foreign
student scholarships, demand to
know what programs a school
has; Stanford students need to
know the exchange opportunities
available; several departments
mentioned their need to know
what services are available to
foreign students; and most of all,
the University needs to look at

what problems the foreign stu
dent has and what it can do to
remedy them.
ONE THING WK know for sure
—the foreign student population
is bound to grow. We now have
534 registered foreign students,
450 graduates and 84 undergradu
ates. Bob Rehder. Assistant to the
Office of the President, estimated
this number may grow to over
1,000 in the next 10 years. ‘‘With
the amount of support coming
from governmental and private
agencies, which will undoubtedly
expand tremendously in the fu
ture, our foreign student popula
tion will swell, “Rehder said.
Programs involving approxi
mately 100 foreign students are
now in the planning stages of
specific departments. Rehder also
mentioned there are "many ex
change programs in the wind.”
Next year one will start between
Germany and Stanford. Others,
often between a foreign govern
ment and Stanford, will follow.

WITH THE PAST and project
ed rapid growth of the foreign
student population, the University
badly needs to establish some
kind of policy about foreign stu
dents by answering such ques
tions as “what are our selection
criteria?” “Do we want to estab
lish courses especially for for
eign students?” “Are our English
programs adequate?” “Are we
concentrating on any geographi
cal area—do we want to?”

“At this point,” Rehder com
mented, “we simply don’t know
the answers to these questions.”
The Special Foreign Student
Scholarship Committee is explor
ing these questions, an explora
tion which will hopefully result in
a purposeful policy on foreign
students based on adequate
knowledge of our present pro
gram.
