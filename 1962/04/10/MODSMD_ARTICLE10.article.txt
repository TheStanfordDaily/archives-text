# Lagunita Dance Set for Friday
## 
### 
Lagunita girls defy the curses
of Friday the 13th with the “13th
Thing” in Lagunita Courtyard
this Friday night. Just what the
“thing” is, remains an enigma,
but it includes dancing to “The
Invaders,” a 10-piece band with
four singers, and free refresh
ments.

To escape the bad luck of black
eats, leaning ladders and other
fatal signs, be in the Lagunita
Courtyrd from 8:30 p.m. to 1 a.m.
this Friday-the-13th. Call Janis
Fossette or Joan Spickleman at
Lagunita, DA 6-2200, for further
information.
