# French Communists Demand Election; DeGaulle Hesitates
## 
### 
PARIS (UPl)—The powerful French Communist party last
night demanded new parliamentary elections in the wake of Sun
day’s sweeping new confidence vote for the nation on President
Charles de Gaulle’s plans for an independent Algeria.
De Gaulle was reported considering whether to dissolve par-

liament and call general elections.
Informed sources said he was re
luctant for fear the Communists
would make gains that once again
would make them a major factor
in French politics.
THE COMMUNISTS issued a
communique demanding new elec
tions to be held under the propor
tional representation system in
vogue under the Fourth Republic.
In the last elections of Novem
ber, 1958, De Gaulle introduced a
majority system which reduced
the Communist party to 10 seats
in the National Assembly al
though the party received nearly
one-quarter of the popular vote.
THE COMMUNISTS stressed
that the party “yes” vote was
only for a policy of peace with the
Algerian people and not the Gaul
list regime. It said that since the
Socialists and other factions
made the same stipulation the
referendum showed De Gaulle no
longer had a majority.
“The Communist party will con
tinue its fight for the election of
a sovereign constituent assembly,
charged with drawing up a demo
cratic constitution,” the commu
nique said.
MEANWHILE, DELAYED re
sults of the referendum from the
Indian Ocean island of Reunion
showed that 96.16 per cent of the
84,730 valid votes were “yes” and
only 3.84 per cent “no.” This
compared with 90.70 and 9.30 per
cent in metropolitan France.
DE GAULLE conferred for 85
minutes at the Elysee Palace
with Premier Michel Dobre and
one well-informed government
source said Debre offered his
resignation to prepare the way
for elections and that De Gaulle
asked time to think this over.
But a spokesman for Debre de
nied later that the Premier ac
tually had offered his resigna
tion. He said De Gaulle and Debre
merely reviewed the referendum
result and the political situation
stemming from it.
THE THREE MEN most wide
ly mentioned as Debre’s succes
sor are banker Georges Pompi
dou, a years-long De Gaulle con
fident; Algerian Affairs Minister
Louis Joxe, who conducted the
Algerian peace talks, and Nation
al Assembly President Jacques
Chaban-Delmas.
Government sources said De
Gaulle is doubtful about the wis
dom of dissolving the present par
liament for several reasons.
No final decision on Debre’s fu
ture or on holding early elections
is expected before the next cab
inet meeting tomorrow.
