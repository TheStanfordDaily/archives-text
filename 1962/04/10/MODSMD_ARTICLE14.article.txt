# STANFORD AND THE RIGHT-WING
## 'Education In What? Socialism?' 
### 
(Editor’s Note: This is (lie sec
ond of five articles.)
Last summer, Stanford pre
sented a conference on education.
Among the speakers were Arkan
sas Senator William Fulbright
and educator and columnist Max
Lerner. Stanford Today, a period
ical published by the University
and sent to alumni carried a full
report on the conference. Corre
spondence was not long in com
ing.
In July, Mr. and Mrs. B. of Lan
caster sent a short letter to Stan
ford President Wallace Sterling
which said, “ . . . the speaker’s
roster at the (conference) pre
sents the ’ol Stanford grads with
the question:
“‘Education in what? Social
ism?’
“THIS LIST of speakers could
not help but present their very
vocal views of internationalism
and socialism. Is Stanford to join
Harvard in producing more ‘ln
tellectuals without Honor?’
“Stanford, because of its pri
vate support, was to us a symbol
of truthful and independent
thought. The men you are grac
ing with the prestige of Stan
ford, by asking them to speak at
this conference, have advocated
and are advocating not only na
tional control of education, but
international control of our stu
dents’ minds th ugh the social
ist-ridden UNESCO.
“As Stanford alumni and as
Americans we vigorously protest
this biased program.”
VY’ITH THE letter was enclosed
a column by Los Angeles Times’
columnist, Henry J. Taylor which
told how the White House was
ridden with "Intellectuals without
Honor” who had formerly been
members of the Harvard faculty.
Two weeks later, Sterling
wrote a reply thanking Mr. and
Mi\s. B. for their interest and say
ing, “A major theme of the Con
ference was the contribution edu
cation could make to the strength
ening of (he United States in the
struggle against Communism.”
Sterling then listed the themes
of three of the conference speak
ers, Frank Pace, former Secre

tary of the Army, Neil H. Jacoby,
a former member of President
Eisenhower’s Council of Econom
ic Advisors, and James R. Killian,
Eisenhower’s special assistant for
science and technology. Sterling
said their speeches had been
strongly anti-Communist.
TEX DAY’S later, Sterling re
ceived a three-page letter from
Mr. and Mrs. B. which asked nine
questions about specific speakers
at the Conference.
One of them was, “Was the
struggle (against Communism)
pictured as one with forces from
without or within the country?”
Another asked, "Did anyone of
the speakers at the Conference
picture the Welfare State as our
greatest defense against Commu
nism? If so, who?” Then came
the heart of the matter.
“The announcement of this ros
ter of speakers for a conference
which would, as is the purpose of
any conference, give those speak
ers the opportunity to impress
their views upon the vei'y edu
cators of our nation’s youth, by
using Stanford’s reputation for
the truth (whence comes any
great scholarship) to enhance
their arguments this announce
ment indeed shocked us and. com
ing so soon after the Ford Foun
dation funds had been contributed
to Stanford, we cannot help but
ask: Has the Ford Foundation,
using its funds as its right to in
fluence, by implication, gentle
men's agreement, or merely sug
gestion, interfered in some way
with the cherished independence
of Stanford?
“WHO, for instance, picked the
speakers for this program? Why
was not the traditional American
spirit of freedom from govern
mental interference with educa
tion and free enterprise at home
and freedom from endless en
tanglements abroad allowed an
effective voice at this conference
designed to, by remote control,
educate the future leaders of the
country?
“Are we to believe that Stan
ford has, of herself, taken a place
along side Harvard in promoting
the fortes that, quite admittedly,
as is evidenced by Senator Ful

bright’s statements, wish to de
stroy our Constitutional Repub
lic (which has indeed born the
fruit of freedom and prosperity—
and of which Mr. Stanford him
self, and thus his University so
greatly benefitted) and replace it
with socialism (which, of its na
ture controls, discourages free
dom’s great force; enthusiasm for
reward of good work, by ‘sharing
the wealth,’ and eventually de
stroys) and then dissolve what is
left of cur country into an amor
phous, socialistic dictatorship
. . . ? (sic)
“Senator Fulbright's convic
tions were represented in the
L.A. Times as wholly consistent
with the tenor of the 1961 Confer
ence on education. If this image
was false, it should bo corrected.
If true but not consistent with the
basic Stanford philosophy, this
fact should be publicly pro
nounced.
“IF TRUK and consistent with
Stanford’s present values, this
new set of values should be, in all
fairness, presented when funds
are solicited from the alumni, so
they will know what they are
getting for their money and sup
port. If the Ford Foundation has
indeed influenced Stanford, she
has lost more by far than she has
gained!”
Robert Miller, Associated Di
rector of University Relations, re
plied to this letter as Sterling was
on vacation. Miller recommended
that Mr. and Mrs. B. read the full
texts of all the speeches which
would be published in December.
No more was heard from them.

Last summer, Stanford pre
sented a conference on education.
Among the speakers were Arkan
sas Senator William Fulbright
and educator and columnist Max
Lerner. Stanford Today, a period
ical published by the University
and sent to alumni carried a full
report on the conference. Corre
spondence was not long in com
ing.
In July, Mr. and Mrs. B. of Lan
caster sent a short letter to Stan
ford President Wallace Sterling
which said, “ . . . the speaker’s
roster at the (conference) pre
sents the ’ol Stanford grads with
the question:
“‘Education in what? Social
ism?’
“THIS LIST of speakers could
not help but present their very
vocal views of internationalism
and socialism. Is Stanford to join
Harvard in producing more ‘ln
tellectuals without Honor?’
“Stanford, because of its pri
vate support, was to us a symbol
of truthful and independent
thought. The men you are grac
ing with the prestige of Stan
ford, by asking them to speak at
this conference, have advocated
and are advocating not only na
tional control of education, but
international control of our stu
dents’ minds th ugh the social
ist-ridden UNESCO.
“As Stanford alumni and as
Americans we vigorously protest
this biased program.”
VY’ITH THE letter was enclosed
a column by Los Angeles Times’
columnist, Henry J. Taylor which
told how the White House was
ridden with "Intellectuals without
Honor” who had formerly been
members of the Harvard faculty.
Two weeks later, Sterling
wrote a reply thanking Mr. and
Mi\s. B. for their interest and say
ing, “A major theme of the Con
ference was the contribution edu
cation could make to the strength
ening of (he United States in the
struggle against Communism.”
Sterling then listed the themes
of three of the conference speak
ers, Frank Pace, former Secre

tary of the Army, Neil H. Jacoby,
a former member of President
Eisenhower’s Council of Econom
ic Advisors, and James R. Killian,
Eisenhower’s special assistant for
science and technology. Sterling
said their speeches had been
strongly anti-Communist.
TEX DAY’S later, Sterling re
ceived a three-page letter from
Mr. and Mrs. B. which asked nine
questions about specific speakers
at the Conference.
One of them was, “Was the
struggle (against Communism)
pictured as one with forces from
without or within the country?”
Another asked, "Did anyone of
the speakers at the Conference
picture the Welfare State as our
greatest defense against Commu
nism? If so, who?” Then came
the heart of the matter.
“The announcement of this ros
ter of speakers for a conference
which would, as is the purpose of
any conference, give those speak
ers the opportunity to impress
their views upon the vei'y edu
cators of our nation’s youth, by

ask: Has the Ford Foundation,
using its funds as its right to in

Last summer, Stanford pre
sented a conference on education.
Among the speakers were Arkan
sas Senator William Fulbright
and educator and columnist Max
Lerner. Stanford Today, a period
ical published by the University
and sent to alumni carried a full
report on the conference. Corre
spondence was not long in com
ing.
In July, Mr. and Mrs. B. of Lan
caster sent a short letter to Stan
ford President Wallace Sterling
which said, “ . . . the speaker’s
roster at the (conference) pre
sents the ’ol Stanford grads with
the question:
“‘Education in what? Social
ism?’
“THIS LIST of speakers could
not help but present their very
vocal views of internationalism
and socialism. Is Stanford to join
Harvard in producing more ‘ln
tellectuals without Honor?’
“Stanford, because of its pri
vate support, was to us a symbol
of truthful and independent
thought. The men you are grac
ing with the prestige of Stan

this conference, have advocated
and are advocating not only na

international control of our stu

“As Stanford alumni and as
Americans we vigorously protest
this biased program.”
VY’ITH THE letter was enclosed
a column by Los Angeles Times’
columnist, Henry J. Taylor which
told how the White House was
ridden with "Intellectuals without
Honor” who had formerly been
members of the Harvard faculty.
Two weeks later, Sterling
wrote a reply thanking Mr. and
Mi\s. B. for their interest and say
ing, “A major theme of the Con
ference was the contribution edu
cation could make to the strength
ening of (he United States in the
struggle against Communism.”
Sterling then listed the themes
of three of the conference speak
ers, Frank Pace, former Secre

tary of the Army, Neil H. Jacoby,
a former member of President
Eisenhower’s Council of Econom
ic Advisors, and James R. Killian,
Eisenhower’s special assistant for
science and technology. Sterling
said their speeches had been
