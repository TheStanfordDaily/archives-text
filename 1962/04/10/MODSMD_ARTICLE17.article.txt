# Segregation Problems In Washington Men's Clubs
## 
### 
United Press International
WASHINGTON--There was a
time when a Washington club
was a snug harbor for a man
seeking safety from family strife.
No more. Nowadays he can be
come involved in an argument at
his club just as quickly as he can
in his own living room.
The integration issue has set
member against member, caused
a rash of resignations and made
membership in clubs a matter of
White House concern.
ONE OF the by-laws of the
Cosmos Club here reads: “No
person shall be permitted to re
cline at length in the public rooms
of the club.’’ There is no enforce
ment problem. The conversational
buzz is too loud to permit naps in
the big building on Massachusetts
Avenue. An architect modeled it
after the Petit Trianon at Ver
sailles where Queen Marie An
toinette held court. The Queen is
best remembered for her reaction
when informed that the people of
Paris were in an ugly mood be
cause they had no bread. “Let
them eat cake,” she said.
The Cosmos Club took no such
high-handed attitude when it re
jected a Negro for membership.
He could eat anything he chose,
but not on the premises of the
club. His name is Carl Rowan,
deputy assistant secretary of
state for public affairs, a well
known newspaperman and author
of several books.
IMMEDIATE results of Ro
wan’s rejection: President Ken
nedy’s application for member
ship in the Cosmos was with
drawn. Resignations were re
ceived from Edward R. Murrow,
director of the U.S. Information
Agency, historian Bruce Catton
and U.S. Ambassador to India
J. K. Galbraith who had sponsor
ed Kennedy’s name.

There are a dozen top-flight
clubs in Washington and the heat
now is on all of them. This is the
city in which the Supreme Court

ordered the racial integration of
(he nation’s schools and a Presi
dent of the United States sent
federal troops into Little Rock,
Ark., to enforce the decision.
There is no doubt where the
Kennedy Administration stands.
Last fall George Cabot Lodge
sounded out fellow members of

the Metropolitan Club, the oldest
in Washington, about extending a
luncheon invitation to L. P. Weav
er, a Negro who was going to suc
ceed him as under secretary of la
bor for international affairs. He
was told that some of the mem
bers might consider it offensive.
ANOTHER resignation came
from Ambassador Angier Biddle
Duke, the State Department’s
chief of protocol. His duties in
volve the entertainment of diplo
mats, including Africans.
That’s the way things stood
when the Cosmos rejected Rowan
last January. The reaction shook
the walls of the Massachusetts
Avenue branch of the Petit Tri
anon.

OF ALL tho exclusive clubs
here, the Cosmos would seem to
be the least likely to bar a Negro.
It’s membership is heavily loaded
with liberal eggheads and, in
fact, intellectual achievement is a
prime test for admittance. Most
of the stories about its members
fall into the absent minded-pro
fessor category.
After the reaction to the Rowan
rejection reached gale force, the
Cosmos Club promptly approved
a resolution to the effect that ex
clusion of any person “on account
of religion, color, race or national
origin is incompatible with the
principles of the Cosmos Club.”
In the election for the admissions
committee the five newest mem
bers privately were pledged
against segregation. The prevail
ing opinion is that (he next Negro
proposed for membership will
make it, although the club may
proceed with what the Supreme
Court integration decision called
“deliberate speed.”

OF ALL tho exclusive clubs
here, the Cosmos would seem to
be the least likely to bar a Negro.
It’s membership is heavily loaded
with liberal eggheads and, in
fact, intellectual achievement is a
prime test for admittance. Most
of the stories about its members
fall into the absent minded-pro
fessor category.
After the reaction to the Rowan
rejection reached gale force, the
Cosmos Club promptly approved
a resolution to the effect that ex

ONE OF the by-laws of the
Cosmos Club here reads: “No

buzz is too loud to permit naps in
the big building on Massachusetts
Avenue. An architect modeled it
after the Petit Trianon at Ver
sailles where Queen Marie An
toinette held court. The Queen is
best remembered for her reaction
when informed that the people of
Paris were in an ugly mood be
cause they had no bread. “Let
them eat cake,” she said.
The Cosmos Club took no such
high-handed attitude when it re
jected a Negro for membership.
He could eat anything he chose,
