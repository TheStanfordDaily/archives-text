# Cards Butcher Gaels 18-4 on Seven Hits
## 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
The Stanford baseball team is
exhausted from running around
the bases so many times yester
day in their IS-1 cakewalk over
St. Mary’s College at Sunken Di
amond.
Stanford meets Claremont
Men’s College on Sunken Dia
mond today, starting at 3 p.m.
Till; CARDS DID all their
scoring with the benefit of only
seven hits, as eight St. Mary’s
errors and 14 walks aided the
cause immeasurably. In all, only
two Stanford runs were earned.
From the Stanford viewpoint,
the* brightest factor of the game
wasn't the prolific scoring, it was
the piiching of secondary start
ers John LeCompte and Jack
Wood.
LeCompte in particular looked
effective, allowing one earned run
in six innings, allowing only four
hits and walking only one. Wood
threw three innings and also al
lowed only one earned run, but
was wild and walked four in his
stint.
Creg Post, Jim Chenu and O. J.
Solander were leading Card slick
ers, each with two hits. Post en
tered the game as a pinch hitter
in the sixth inning anti lined out
to left field, lie got to hat again
in that inning anti blooped a two
run single to cap the inning. Post
drove in three runs in the seventh
