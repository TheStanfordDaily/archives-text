# U.S., Britain Plan Nuclear Ban Appeal
## 
### 
LONDON (UPI) President Kennedy and Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan aÂ»e considering a dramatic, last minute appeal
to Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev for an internationally controlled
nuclear test ban, diplomatic sources said yesterday.
Soviet acceptance of such an appeal, the sources said, would

signify Russian approval of the
inspection and controls asked by
the West and avert resumption of
American nuclear testing in the
atmosphere this month at Christ
mas Island in the Pacific.
SHOULD KHRUSHCHEV re
ject the Kennedy-Macmillan ap
peal, the Western position on nu
clear testing would be strength
ened in world public opinion, the
diplomatic sources believed.

The sources said the merits
and pitfalls of the idea for an ur
gent Anglo-American appeal to
Moscow still are under considera
tion and the final decision has not
been taken.
SO FAR the Russians have re
jected the Western demands for
measures for international con
trol and verification of a nuclear
test ban on grounds the West
wants such inspections only for
the purpose of sabotage.
The same impasse was reported
in Geneva during the recent big
three foreign ministers confer
ence of Dean Rusk, Lord Home
and Andrei Gromyko. Since then
the Russians have remained
equally adamant.
KHRUSHCHEV, in a letter last
week to Japanese Premier Haya
to Ikeda, was just as rigid in re
jecting test ban controls.
Despite this rigid stand diplo
matic sources said a last minute
direct appeal might sway Khrush
chov toward a more compromis
ing stand since his rejection
would put much of the blame for
renewed testing on the Kremlin.

Soviet affairs and nuclear ex
perts said there is little chance
Russia will relax its opposition
sine they believe Russia itself
wants to hold a now series of nu
clear tests.
