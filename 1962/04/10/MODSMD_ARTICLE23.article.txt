AUGUSTA, Ga. (UPD Amaz
j ing Arnold Palmer wore down
Gary Player and Dow Finster
wald yesterday with another one
of his fantastic finishes to cap
ture his third Masters' golf title
i with a spectacular four-under-par
j 68 windup in a three-way playoff.
Down three strokes after the
| first nine, the indomitable, 32-
j year-old Palmer turned it on over
j the hack nine by shooting five
I birdies against his frustrated two
competitors to fashion a 37-31-68
; that beat runnerup Player by
j three strokes and earned him the
I $20,000 first prize money.
