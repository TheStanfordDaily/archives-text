# S.F. Group to Perform 'Becket' at Mem Aud
## 
### 
Jean Anouilh’s witty play
"Becket” about the sinner-turned
saint, Thomas a Becket, and his
liege lord, the 12th century King
Henry 11, will come to Memorial
Auditorium Thursday at 8 p.m.

The San Francisco Actor’s
Workshop production is richly
costumed and effectively and sim
ply staged. The cast of 40 includes
the royalty of court and church
of the period.

In the lead roles are Malachi
Thrt ue as Henry and Tom Rosqui
as Becket.
THE PLAY TELLS of the dra
ma between two friends turned
political enemies. As the Examin
er put it, “It is war of willfulness,
selfishness, duty and paradoxical
friendship. Through all its bitter
ness, a memory of devotion and
love nags inwardly at both men
without respite.”

Throughout the play is sprin
kled with the delightful irony of
the French author. Suggestive of
his wit is this excerpt from a
comment on the play he wrote
for the original production; “It
seems that Becket was not oven
of Saxon origin—this was one of
the mainsprings of my play—he
was a Norman. Who know if he
was really the son of the beauti
ful Saracen who had saved his
father made captive by some
pasha during the Second Cru
sade Who knows if the song I
hd written on that subject was
true? A song that isn’t even
true! . . . Horrors!
Anouilh’s drama is fictional and
some say it is not very profound,
but it is witty and powerful.

Tickets are on sale at Memorial
Box Office for $3. $2.50, $2 and
$1.50.
