# Wilbur Sponsor's Role
## 
### JERRY PUTTEER Wilbur Head Sponsor 
(Editor’s Note: This is the
second in a series of articles about
the sponsor program.)

The house system has become
well-established at Wilbur Hall
since its adoption two years ago
in the fall of 1959, and within the
context of the house system the
sponsor’s job has become at the
same time more challenging and
more rewarding. The changes
which have come about in the
Wilbur program itself have
meant an increasingly more pro
gressive and productive fresh
man year for incoming students.
THE HOUSE SYSTEM seeks to
provide both a greater degree of
autonomy and individuality
among the eight houses, and
closer personal association and
unity within each group. Each
house is regarded as an independ
ent unit of approximately 100

men, with (ho responsibility for
setting up its own social and cul
tural programs and conducting
house government in accordance
with the wishes of the members
of the house.
IN PRACTICE, the 100-man
house has proved to be a flexible
unit for freshman activity—small
enough to identify with effective
ly and yet large enough to pro
vide the resources for an active
program.
Such a system has increased
the responsibilities of the spon
sors. Their immediate task at the
beginning of the year is to estab
lish the framework upon which
the house system is to be erected.
THE SPONSOR’S JOB thus re
quires him to work capably in
several areas, as part of a team
of 25 sponsors, in particularly
close association with the two
other sponsors and faculty resi
dent of his house, and on the in
dividual level. As the year passes.

the success of a sponsor can bo
measured in the degree to which
his responsibilities can be effec
tively transferred to freshmen.
There is no stereotyped pattern
for the successful sponsor, but
those selected must be willing to
devote a considerable amount of
time and effort to the job. They
must be capable of independent
and intelligent thought, of active
and mature leadership, and of
dealing competently with the
problems of others.
Sponsoring can provide upper
classmen with an opportunity un
matched in any other campus ac
tivity. Those interested are en
couraged to attend a meeting for
prospective men sponsor appli
cants tonight in the Trancos
House lounge at 7:30 p.m. Appli
cations are available this week in
the Wilbur office and may be sub
mitted through Friday, April 13.
Tomorrow: The Woman Spon
sor’s Role.
