# Housing: Stanford's Biggest Foreign Student Problem
## 
### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
(Editor’s Note: This is the second of a
four-part series on campus activities and
problems concerning foreign students.)
Stanford’s biggest single problem con
cerning foreign students is providing them
adequate housing. The large majority of for
eign students, 346, live off-campus, 50 in
Stanford Village, the rest scattered through
out the area surrounding Stanford.
Often the housing is unsatisfactory, al
ways it tends to isolate the students from
campus life. The student arrives at Stanford
less than two weeks before the quarter be
gins, usually brand now to American life,
and is plunked in the middle of the scramble
for off-campus housing.
On top of any anxieties ho may feel about
living in a new culture he is faced with the
insecurity of not knowing whore he will live
as soon as school begins. No wonder most
foreign students have only two things upper
most in their minds upon arrival—"Where
am I going to live?” and "Where is my ad

viser?"
Probably no other single factor affects a
student’s study, his activity in campus life
and his general impression of America as
much as the place where he lives. Making
friends is a crucial part of adjusting to a
new culture, and where a student lives tends
to define whom he knows. The isolation of
off-campus living presents a serious obstacle
to the formation of friendships with Ameri
cans.
In an attempt to help the foreign student
find his off-campus housing, the Community
Committee, a group of over 200 citizens of
the area surrounding Stanford, has helped
by providing rides for the newly arrived
foreign student in his hunt for a residence.
To the foreign student, who seldom has a
car and is completely unfamiliar with the
area, the task of finding housing is tre
mendous. More people are needed to provide
rides, to screen prospective residences in
hope of avoiding a run-in with a battle-axe
landlady—and to find places where foreign
students are welcomed.

RACIAL discrimination is an ugly prob
lem which occasionally confronts a foreign

student in his search for housing. The prob
lem came to the fore last spring when an in
stance of discrimination was widely publi
cized. When Dean Winbigler stipulated that
all persons listing residences with the hous
ing office must agree to practice no discrim
ination, most people felt the problem was
solved. However, in the scramble for housing,
the foreign student goes many places, some
listed with the housing office, others not.
Occasionally he is bound to meet discrimina
tion if he looks quite “different" from an
American. Everything possible should be
done to prevent such an ugly mar on a
student’s first impression of America.
THE ATTENTION focused on integrated
housing for undergraduates brought several
comments from graduate students last quar
ter on the general lack of facilities for grad
uate students. And here is the crux of the
problem. Four hundred and thirty-six for
eign students are graduates—their average
age—26. Undergraduate dormitory living is
simply not appropriate for many of these
students. Much thought needs to bo put into
the kind of housing to be provided for these
mature students.

The Committee on Undergraduate Hous
ing seems to have benefitted greatly by sur
veying other colleges to find out how inte
grated housing has worked in other schools.
Perhaps a survey is in order to find out how
other schools have met their foreign student
housing problem.
VIC AFFOLTER, head of the HR Pre-
Registration Committee, has suggested lan
guage houses as a partial solution. This plan,
which has been tried at other universities,
allows foreign and American students to live
together under a cooperative system, speak
ing a certain foreign language. He feels that
with the overseas campuses, interest should
run high for such a plan. He noted that the
fraternity houses to be vacated when the
clusters are completed seem ideal for such
a system.
Weiner Warmhrunn, Foreign Student Ad
viser, would like to see housing provided
which would allow the foreign student to
do some of his own cooking. “Privacy and
flexibility are need in any plan for foreign
student housing,” he stated. He suggested
as an ideal living plan a suite of four rooms
surrounding a central kitchen and living

area and accommodating four or five foreign
students.

Fortunately the University is moving in
this direction. Currently Dean Albert Bow
ker and his staff are considering plans for
graduate, unmarried students. The next ap
plication for a Housing and Home Finance
Agency loan may include this project.
TENTATIVE plans include suites such as
described by Warmbrunn in an Escondido
project located somewhere between the mar
ried students and the dormitories, according
to Robert Redder of the Office of the Presi
dent. Their location will reflect the philoso
phy behind their design, being somewhere
between married student type of accommo
dations and dormitory living, Redder com
mented.

Such accommodations should make a big
difference in a foreign student’s life at Stan
ford. It will be a big step in the right direc
tion: but it is still in the future, and much
more needs to be done now.

new plan for dormitory eating for foreign
students.)
