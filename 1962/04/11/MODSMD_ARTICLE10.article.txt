# LASSU Approves New Constitution For Student Vote
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
LASSU produced a new ASSU Constitution Monday night
from six months of ground work and six hours of intensive dis
cussion. The student body will vote on the proposal in a referen
dum Monday.
ASSU President Bob Sayler opened the meeting by stating
,. ... - — — -4lhaf T urac ♦ i f or

’that LASSU was not ratifying
the proposed constitution. LASSU
is only to produce the best it can,
then turn the product over to the
student body for ratification, he
said.
The Executive Article was con
sidered first. There was debate
about the presidential veto, which
stayed in, and about provisions
for a regular State of the Student
Body report by the ASSU presi
dent. Rules concerning head cheer
leader stayed out, as they could
be covered by bylaws or custom.
THE JUDICIARY Article was
amended to provide for graduate
organization judicial councils.
The only other problem was se
mantic — how does one say the
IFC loses jurisdiction if anything
outside a fraternity is involved in
a violation? This was clarified,
the article was passed.
A declaration of Student Rights
and Responsibilities was passed
as Article I, the Preamble. This is
a document covering rights to off
campus activities, to information,
and to uncensored student publi
cations. The anti-discrimination
clause, No. 3 under “Rights,” was
not expected to apply to fraterni
ties. as the inclusion of alumni in
fraternities makes them not just
student organizations.
Though considered last, the
Legislative Article caused the
most conflict. By the first draft,
the Student Legislature could im
peach and remove any elected
student official by a two-thirds
vote. Some said this was too
much power. The Daily was used
as a case in point.
Ron Rapoport, Editor, stated
that the provision would greatly
curtail freedom of the press, and
that it gave the Student Legisla
ture too much power over all or
ganizations. He suggested a refer
endum was needed.
THE IMPEACHMENT section
was then changed to its present
form; the Student Legislature
will be able by a two-thirds vote
to remove any appointed student
official, and to recommend that
elected officers be recalled by
their constituents and to require
an election for this purpose. A
special phrase was added that The
Daily editor be recalled by the
student body and not The Daily
staff, which elects him.
Sayler then turned the chair
over to Budd Ratts and presented
the case for the 120-member stu
dent legislature. Bob stated,
“LASSU has the respect of neither
i the students nor the administra
tion; LASSU is a representative
i and communicating body that
j neither represents nor communi
j cates; until these conditions are
solved, as they would be by the
| larger body. I don’t think any
| body cares if we are workable,”
he said.
THE QUESTION of whether
LASSU’s lack of accomplishment
was due to lack of communica
tion. which could be helped, or
lack of power, which is in the ad
j ministration’s hands so cannot be
helped, was answered by John
Steinbruner.
Students would not have a
greater direct voting power, but
by setting up organizations paral
lelling the administration, they
could investigate and present
their thoughts to the administra
tion, which would listen to a stu
dent-representing body, Stein bru
ner said.
Sayler added that while LASSU
I certainly has done something this
i year, “if it can’t be more effective
I than it it now, it shouldn’t be.”
I He met yesterday with President
I Sterling’s committee on under
graduate education to explore po
| tential areas of power.
It was argued that LASSU
j could bo more communicating in
I its present framework. It might
be improved, but “can we ever
expect the 26 members of this
! legislature to get to the stu-
I dents?” Sayler countered.
I This section was passed, then
| proxy voting was written in and
j a section was added insuring
| graduate access to ASSU funds,
j which they so far have not had.
: This passed, and after the fourth
i call for the question, the Legisla
■ live Article was passed. A cheer
I went up, and the tired legislators
I went home.

a document covering rights to off
campus activities, to information,
and to uncensored student publi
cations. The anti-discrimination
clause, No. 3 under “Rights,” was
not expected to apply to fraterni
ties. as the inclusion of alumni in
fraternities makes them not just
student organizations.
Though considered last, the
Legislative Article caused the
most conflict. By the first draft,
the Student Legislature could im
peach and remove any elected
student official by a two-thirds
vote. Some said this was too
much power. The Daily was used
as a case in point.
Ron Rapoport, Editor, stated
that the provision would greatly
curtail freedom of the press, and
that it gave the Student Legisla
ture too much power over all or
ganizations. He suggested a refer
endum was needed.
THE IMPEACHMENT section
was then changed to its present
form; the Student Legislature
will be able by a two-thirds vote
to remove any appointed student
official, and to recommend that
elected officers be recalled by
their constituents and to require
an election for this purpose. A
special phrase was added that The
Daily editor be recalled by the
student body and not The Daily
staff, which elects him.
Sayler then turned the chair
over to Budd Ratts and presented
the case for the 120-member stu
dent legislature. Bob stated,
“LASSU has the respect of neither
i the students nor the administra
tion; LASSU is a representative
i and communicating body that
j neither represents nor communi
j cates; until these conditions are
solved, as they would be by the
| larger body. I don’t think any
| body cares if we are workable,”
he said.
THE QUESTION of whether
LASSU’s lack of accomplishment
was due to lack of communica
tion. which could be helped, or
lack of power, which is in the ad
j ministration’s hands so cannot be
helped, was answered by John
Steinbruner.
Students would not have a
greater direct voting power, but
by setting up organizations paral
lelling the administration, they
could investigate and present
their thoughts to the administra
tion, which would listen to a stu
dent-representing body, Stein bru
ner said.
Sayler added that while LASSU
I certainly has done something this
i year, “if it can’t be more effective
I than it it now, it shouldn’t be.”
I He met yesterday with President
I Sterling’s committee on under
graduate education to explore po

It was argued that LASSU

be improved, but “can we ever
expect the 26 members of this
! legislature to get to the stu-
I dents?” Sayler countered.
I This section was passed, then

Sayler then turned the chair
over to Budd Ratts and presented
the case for the 120-member stu
dent legislature. Bob stated,
“LASSU has the respect of neither
i the students nor the administra
tion; LASSU is a representative
i and communicating body that
j neither represents nor communi
j cates; until these conditions are
solved, as they would be by the
| larger body. I don’t think any
| body cares if we are workable,”
he said.
THE QUESTION of whether
LASSU’s lack of accomplishment
was due to lack of communica
tion. which could be helped, or
lack of power, which is in the ad
j ministration’s hands so cannot be
helped, was answered by John
Steinbruner.
Students would not have a
greater direct voting power, but
by setting up organizations paral
lelling the administration, they
could investigate and present
their thoughts to the administra
tion, which would listen to a stu
dent-representing body, Stein bru
ner said.
Sayler added that while LASSU
I certainly has done something this
i year, “if it can’t be more effective
I than it it now, it shouldn’t be.”
I He met yesterday with President
I Sterling’s committee on under
graduate education to explore po

It was argued that LASSU

I its present framework. It might
be improved, but “can we ever
expect the 26 members of this
! legislature to get to the stu-
I dents?” Sayler countered.
I This section was passed, then

■ live Article was passed. A cheer
I went up, and the tired legislators
I went home.
LASSU produced a new ASSU Constitution Monday night
from six months of ground work and six hours of intensive dis
cussion. The student body will vote on the proposal in a referen
dum Monday.
ASSU President Bob Sayler opened the meeting by stating
,. ... - — — -4lhaf T urac ♦ i f or

’that LASSU was not ratifying
the proposed constitution. LASSU
is only to produce the best it can,
then turn the product over to the
student body for ratification, he
said.
The Executive Article was con
sidered first. There was debate
about the presidential veto, which
stayed in, and about provisions
for a regular State of the Student
Body report by the ASSU presi
dent. Rules concerning head cheer
leader stayed out, as they could
be covered by bylaws or custom.
THE JUDICIARY Article was
amended to provide for graduate
organization judicial councils.
The only other problem was se
mantic — how does one say the
IFC loses jurisdiction if anything
outside a fraternity is involved in
a violation? This was clarified,
the article was passed.
A declaration of Student Rights
and Responsibilities was passed
as Article I, the Preamble. This is
a document covering rights to off
campus activities, to information,
and to uncensored student publi
cations. The anti-discrimination
clause, No. 3 under “Rights,” was
not expected to apply to fraterni
ties. as the inclusion of alumni in
fraternities makes them not just
student organizations.
Though considered last, the
Legislative Article caused the
most conflict. By the first draft,
the Student Legislature could im
peach and remove any elected
student official by a two-thirds
vote. Some said this was too
much power. The Daily was used
as a case in point.
Ron Rapoport, Editor, stated
that the provision would greatly
curtail freedom of the press, and
that it gave the Student Legisla
ture too much power over all or
ganizations. He suggested a refer
endum was needed.
THE IMPEACHMENT section
was then changed to its present
form; the Student Legislature
will be able by a two-thirds vote
to remove any appointed student
official, and to recommend that
elected officers be recalled by
their constituents and to require
an election for this purpose. A
special phrase was added that The
Daily editor be recalled by the
student body and not The Daily
staff, which elects him.
Sayler then turned the chair
over to Budd Ratts and presented
the case for the 120-member stu
dent legislature. Bob stated,
