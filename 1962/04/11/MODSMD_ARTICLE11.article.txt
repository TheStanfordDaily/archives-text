# STANFORD AND THE RIGHT-WING
## Baran's Speech Praising Castro Kept Letter-Writers Occupied 
### 
(Editor’s Note; This is the j
third of five articles.)
Stanford economics professor I
Paul Baran is an avowed Marxist, j
As such he is the major target for |
right wing attacks on the Univer
sity.
in the fall of 1960 Baran visited
Cuba for three weeks as a guest
of the Cuban government. On {
Nov. 16, he told a Stanford audi-1
ence that Castro is one of the
groat men of this century and [
that ho feared an invasion of |
Cuba by the U.S. Marines or by a j
U.S.-financed band of Cuban ex
iles.
BOH fONSmiNE, nationally
syndicated Hearst columnist, men- j
tinned Baran's speech in a col
umn. Several newspapers ran J
editorials expressing amazement
at Baran’s statements and at the
fact that he was on the Stanford
faculty.
Letters from alumni and from
several patriotic organizations i
were received by the University |
in vast quantities. Some threaten- |
ed not to contribute to Stanford
as long as Baran was on the fac-1
ulty. Some expressed fear for the
University’s “prestige.” Some
went into a long discussion of
Marxism and came to the conclu
sion that no Marxist should be
allowed to teach. Some expressed
amazement that anyone could
think well of Castro. One ex- j
pressed confidence that the Uni- \
versity would fire Baran for his
remarks.
All these letters were answered. [
and, though the job was spread j
around within the administration, j
a relatively pat formula was j
used. To quote at length from one j
letter written to an alumnus:
“IN' YOUR note you expressed
misgivings with regard to the j
presence of Professors Sweezy
(Paul Sweezy was a visiting pro-1
lessor in economics last year and
is also a Marxist) and Baran on!
the Stanford faculty.
“You will be happy to know |
that Prof. Sweezy is no longer at
Stanford. . . . Also, I should like
to reassure you at the outset that ;
the Administration and Trustees i
of the University are also con- j
cerned about some of the public
statements made by Prof. Baran. |
“As you surmised. Prof. Baran i
is an admitted member of the So
cialist Party (Baran denies this).

11c has made disturbing remarks
in public and in his capacity as a
private citizen.
“NEITHER the Board of Trus
tees nor the University Adminis
tration agrees with his senti
ments, but we must support his
right to express his views in a
public forum. Prof. Baran has
been at Stanford since 1949 and
has acquired academic tenure.
But under tenure regulations he
cannot be dismissed because he
has expressed ideas that are dis
tasteful to you or to me.”
The letter goes on to say that
Baran is challenged continually
by students and faculty and that
the free exchange of ideas is
healthy.
“Prof. Baran was employed by
Stanford because there was a
need for an expert in the econ
omic history of Europe and in the
analysis and interpretation of the
current economic thought in the
socialist sphere of the world. He
is a stimulating teacher.
“ALTHOUGH there is invari
ably disagreement with some of
his ideas, there has been no indi
cation that any of the other mem
bers of the faculty have question
ed his integrity or his intellectual
capabilities.”

| There were many variations on
I his theme. One letter to an alum
na said in part, “Before a student
engages in a course offered by
Dr. Baran at Stanford, he has to
have completed elementary econ
omics and other courses that
| cover classical and neo-classical
economics, price theory and prac
j lice, and income and employ-
I rnent . . .
“In other words, students who
are exposed to Prof. Baran’s
I teachings are not the type to be
j easily taken in, and they have
all had previous courses designed
to facilitate an understanding of
| world economic problems.”
THE NEXT sentence repeats
that there have been no com-
I plaints against Baran’s classroom
activities and continues that no
one has “said to us that he felt
he was being indoctrinated with
j Marxism.”
In a letter to another alumnus,
; obviously an important one, Ster
ling wrote that he was going to
| have Baran in for a talk and that,
i “If I’m to defend his freedom of
j speech. I want him to exercise
that freedom responsibly.” (That
meeting will be described tomor
row. )
Another alumnus who said he
was discontinuing contributions
to the University and he had per
suaded a friend to do the same,
was answered by Associate Direc
! lor of University Relations Don
ald Carlson with this reply:
“I CAN assure you (hat Dr.
Sterling deeply regrets that you
| no longer have confidence in the
| University and the desire to sup

port it.
“In my opinion your opinions l
of the University are wrong and
Prof. Baran’s opinions about Cas
tro are wrong, but I submit that
you are both entitled to express
your opinions and 1 respect your
right to them. I hope you will
also respect my right to mine.”
In another letter to an alumnus
Sterling quoted the University’s
policy on Communists on the fac
ulty:
“THAT WHILE membership in
any lawful organization is not, in
itself, grounds for disciplinary ac
tion by the University, it must be
recognized that a present mem
ber of the Communist Party of
j the United States is subject to a
discipline that is inconsistent
with professional integrity and
competence, and with academic
freedom and responsibility as
herein defined, and is. therefore,
unfit to serve on the Stanford
Faculty.”
The letter then went on to say
I that Baran is not a Communist
j but is a Socialist (He denies
membership in either party).
On Dec. 11, the administration
began trying to get a speaker on
Cuba who would oppose Baran’s
- views. For a while it looked as if
; the speaker might be Philip Bon
sall, then Ambassador to Cuba.
BON'sall, couldn’t make it. but

Stanford economics professor I
Paul Baran is an avowed Marxist, j
As such he is the major target for |
right wing attacks on the Univer
sity.
in the fall of 1960 Baran visited
Cuba for three weeks as a guest
of the Cuban government. On {
Nov. 16, he told a Stanford audi-1
ence that Castro is one of the
groat men of this century and [
that ho feared an invasion of |
Cuba by the U.S. Marines or by a j
U.S.-financed band of Cuban ex
iles.
BOH fONSmiNE, nationally
syndicated Hearst columnist, men- j
tinned Baran's speech in a col
umn. Several newspapers ran J
editorials expressing amazement
at Baran’s statements and at the
fact that he was on the Stanford
faculty.
Letters from alumni and from
several patriotic organizations i
were received by the University |
in vast quantities. Some threaten- |
ed not to contribute to Stanford
as long as Baran was on the fac-1
ulty. Some expressed fear for the
University’s “prestige.” Some
went into a long discussion of
Marxism and came to the conclu
sion that no Marxist should be
allowed to teach. Some expressed
amazement that anyone could
think well of Castro. One ex- j
pressed confidence that the Uni- \
versity would fire Baran for his
remarks.
All these letters were answered. [
and, though the job was spread j
around within the administration, j
a relatively pat formula was j
used. To quote at length from one j
letter written to an alumnus:
“IN' YOUR note you expressed
misgivings with regard to the j
presence of Professors Sweezy
(Paul Sweezy was a visiting pro-1
lessor in economics last year and
is also a Marxist) and Baran on!
the Stanford faculty.
“You will be happy to know |
that Prof. Sweezy is no longer at
Stanford. . . . Also, I should like
to reassure you at the outset that ;
the Administration and Trustees i
of the University are also con- j
cerned about some of the public
statements made by Prof. Baran. |
“As you surmised. Prof. Baran i
is an admitted member of the So
cialist Party (Baran denies this).

11c has made disturbing remarks
in public and in his capacity as a
private citizen.
“NEITHER the Board of Trus
tees nor the University Adminis
tration agrees with his senti
ments, but we must support his
right to express his views in a
public forum. Prof. Baran has
been at Stanford since 1949 and
has acquired academic tenure.
But under tenure regulations he
cannot be dismissed because he
has expressed ideas that are dis
tasteful to you or to me.”
The letter goes on to say that
Baran is challenged continually
by students and faculty and that
the free exchange of ideas is
healthy.
“Prof. Baran was employed by
Stanford because there was a
need for an expert in the econ
omic history of Europe and in the
analysis and interpretation of the
current economic thought in the
socialist sphere of the world. He
is a stimulating teacher.
“ALTHOUGH there is invari
ably disagreement with some of
his ideas, there has been no indi
cation that any of the other mem
bers of the faculty have question
ed his integrity or his intellectual
capabilities.”

| There were many variations on
I his theme. One letter to an alum
na said in part, “Before a student
engages in a course offered by
Dr. Baran at Stanford, he has to
have completed elementary econ
omics and other courses that
| cover classical and neo-classical
economics, price theory and prac
j lice, and income and employ-
I rnent . . .
“In other words, students who
are exposed to Prof. Baran’s
I teachings are not the type to be
j easily taken in, and they have
all had previous courses designed
to facilitate an understanding of
| world economic problems.”
THE NEXT sentence repeats
that there have been no com-
I plaints against Baran’s classroom
activities and continues that no
one has “said to us that he felt
he was being indoctrinated with
j Marxism.”
In a letter to another alumnus,
; obviously an important one, Ster
ling wrote that he was going to
| have Baran in for a talk and that,
i “If I’m to defend his freedom of
j speech. I want him to exercise
that freedom responsibly.” (That
meeting will be described tomor
row. )
Another alumnus who said he
was discontinuing contributions
to the University and he had per
suaded a friend to do the same,
was answered by Associate Direc
! lor of University Relations Don
ald Carlson with this reply:
“I CAN assure you (hat Dr.
Sterling deeply regrets that you
| no longer have confidence in the
| University and the desire to sup

port it.
“In my opinion your opinions l
of the University are wrong and
Prof. Baran’s opinions about Cas
tro are wrong, but I submit that
you are both entitled to express
your opinions and 1 respect your
right to them. I hope you will
also respect my right to mine.”
In another letter to an alumnus
Sterling quoted the University’s
policy on Communists on the fac
ulty:
“THAT WHILE membership in
any lawful organization is not, in
itself, grounds for disciplinary ac
tion by the University, it must be
recognized that a present mem
ber of the Communist Party of
j the United States is subject to a
discipline that is inconsistent
with professional integrity and
competence, and with academic
freedom and responsibility as
herein defined, and is. therefore,
unfit to serve on the Stanford
Faculty.”
The letter then went on to say
I that Baran is not a Communist
j but is a Socialist (He denies
membership in either party).
On Dec. 11, the administration
began trying to get a speaker on
Cuba who would oppose Baran’s
- views. For a while it looked as if
; the speaker might be Philip Bon
sall, then Ambassador to Cuba.

Stanford economics professor I
Paul Baran is an avowed Marxist, j
As such he is the major target for |
right wing attacks on the Univer
sity.
in the fall of 1960 Baran visited
Cuba for three weeks as a guest
of the Cuban government. On {
Nov. 16, he told a Stanford audi-1
ence that Castro is one of the
groat men of this century and [
that ho feared an invasion of |
Cuba by the U.S. Marines or by a j
U.S.-financed band of Cuban ex
iles.
BOH fONSmiNE, nationally
syndicated Hearst columnist, men- j
tinned Baran's speech in a col
umn. Several newspapers ran J
editorials expressing amazement
at Baran’s statements and at the
fact that he was on the Stanford
faculty.
Letters from alumni and from
several patriotic organizations i
were received by the University |
in vast quantities. Some threaten- |
ed not to contribute to Stanford
as long as Baran was on the fac-1
ulty. Some expressed fear for the
University’s “prestige.” Some
went into a long discussion of
Marxism and came to the conclu
sion that no Marxist should be
allowed to teach. Some expressed
amazement that anyone could
think well of Castro. One ex- j
pressed confidence that the Uni- \
versity would fire Baran for his
remarks.
All these letters were answered. [
and, though the job was spread j
around within the administration, j
a relatively pat formula was j
used. To quote at length from one j
letter written to an alumnus:
“IN' YOUR note you expressed
misgivings with regard to the j
presence of Professors Sweezy
(Paul Sweezy was a visiting pro-1
lessor in economics last year and
is also a Marxist) and Baran on!
the Stanford faculty.
“You will be happy to know |
that Prof. Sweezy is no longer at
Stanford. . . . Also, I should like
to reassure you at the outset that ;
the Administration and Trustees i
of the University are also con- j
cerned about some of the public
statements made by Prof. Baran. |
“As you surmised. Prof. Baran i
is an admitted member of the So
cialist Party (Baran denies this).

11c has made disturbing remarks
in public and in his capacity as a
private citizen.
“NEITHER the Board of Trus
tees nor the University Adminis
tration agrees with his senti
ments, but we must support his
right to express his views in a
public forum. Prof. Baran has
been at Stanford since 1949 and
has acquired academic tenure.
But under tenure regulations he
cannot be dismissed because he
has expressed ideas that are dis
tasteful to you or to me.”
The letter goes on to say that
Baran is challenged continually
by students and faculty and that
the free exchange of ideas is
healthy.
“Prof. Baran was employed by
Stanford because there was a
need for an expert in the econ
omic history of Europe and in the
analysis and interpretation of the
current economic thought in the
socialist sphere of the world. He
is a stimulating teacher.
“ALTHOUGH there is invari
ably disagreement with some of
his ideas, there has been no indi
cation that any of the other mem
bers of the faculty have question
ed his integrity or his intellectual
capabilities.”

| There were many variations on
I his theme. One letter to an alum
na said in part, “Before a student
engages in a course offered by
Dr. Baran at Stanford, he has to
have completed elementary econ
omics and other courses that
| cover classical and neo-classical
economics, price theory and prac
j lice, and income and employ-
I rnent . . .
“In other words, students who
are exposed to Prof. Baran’s
I teachings are not the type to be
j easily taken in, and they have
all had previous courses designed
to facilitate an understanding of
| world economic problems.”
THE NEXT sentence repeats
that there have been no com-
I plaints against Baran’s classroom
activities and continues that no
one has “said to us that he felt
he was being indoctrinated with
j Marxism.”
In a letter to another alumnus,
; obviously an important one, Ster
ling wrote that he was going to
| have Baran in for a talk and that,
i “If I’m to defend his freedom of
j speech. I want him to exercise
that freedom responsibly.” (That
meeting will be described tomor
row. )
Another alumnus who said he
was discontinuing contributions
to the University and he had per
suaded a friend to do the same,
was answered by Associate Direc
! lor of University Relations Don
ald Carlson with this reply:
“I CAN assure you (hat Dr.
Sterling deeply regrets that you
| no longer have confidence in the
| University and the desire to sup

“In my opinion your opinions l
of the University are wrong and
Prof. Baran’s opinions about Cas
tro are wrong, but I submit that
you are both entitled to express
your opinions and 1 respect your
right to them. I hope you will
also respect my right to mine.”
In another letter to an alumnus
Sterling quoted the University’s
policy on Communists on the fac
ulty:
“THAT WHILE membership in
any lawful organization is not, in
itself, grounds for disciplinary ac
tion by the University, it must be
recognized that a present mem

Stanford economics professor I
Paul Baran is an avowed Marxist, j
As such he is the major target for |
right wing attacks on the Univer
sity.
in the fall of 1960 Baran visited
Cuba for three weeks as a guest
of the Cuban government. On {
Nov. 16, he told a Stanford audi-1
ence that Castro is one of the
groat men of this century and [
that ho feared an invasion of |
Cuba by the U.S. Marines or by a j
U.S.-financed band of Cuban ex
iles.
BOH fONSmiNE, nationally
syndicated Hearst columnist, men- j
tinned Baran's speech in a col
umn. Several newspapers ran J
editorials expressing amazement
at Baran’s statements and at the
fact that he was on the Stanford
faculty.
Letters from alumni and from
several patriotic organizations i
were received by the University |
in vast quantities. Some threaten- |
ed not to contribute to Stanford
as long as Baran was on the fac-1
ulty. Some expressed fear for the
University’s “prestige.” Some
went into a long discussion of
Marxism and came to the conclu
sion that no Marxist should be
allowed to teach. Some expressed
amazement that anyone could
think well of Castro. One ex- j
pressed confidence that the Uni- \
versity would fire Baran for his
remarks.
All these letters were answered. [
and, though the job was spread j
around within the administration, j
a relatively pat formula was j
used. To quote at length from one j
letter written to an alumnus:
“IN' YOUR note you expressed
misgivings with regard to the j
presence of Professors Sweezy
(Paul Sweezy was a visiting pro-1
lessor in economics last year and
is also a Marxist) and Baran on!
the Stanford faculty.
“You will be happy to know |
that Prof. Sweezy is no longer at
Stanford. . . . Also, I should like
to reassure you at the outset that ;
the Administration and Trustees i
of the University are also con- j
cerned about some of the public
statements made by Prof. Baran. |
“As you surmised. Prof. Baran i
is an admitted member of the So
cialist Party (Baran denies this).

11c has made disturbing remarks
in public and in his capacity as a
private citizen.
“NEITHER the Board of Trus
tees nor the University Adminis
tration agrees with his senti
ments, but we must support his
right to express his views in a
public forum. Prof. Baran has
been at Stanford since 1949 and
has acquired academic tenure.
But under tenure regulations he
cannot be dismissed because he
has expressed ideas that are dis
tasteful to you or to me.”
The letter goes on to say that
Baran is challenged continually
by students and faculty and that
the free exchange of ideas is
healthy.
“Prof. Baran was employed by
Stanford because there was a
need for an expert in the econ
omic history of Europe and in the
analysis and interpretation of the
current economic thought in the
socialist sphere of the world. He
is a stimulating teacher.
“ALTHOUGH there is invari
ably disagreement with some of
his ideas, there has been no indi
cation that any of the other mem
bers of the faculty have question
ed his integrity or his intellectual
capabilities.”

| There were many variations on
I his theme. One letter to an alum
na said in part, “Before a student
engages in a course offered by
Dr. Baran at Stanford, he has to
have completed elementary econ
omics and other courses that
| cover classical and neo-classical
economics, price theory and prac
j lice, and income and employ-
I rnent . . .
“In other words, students who
are exposed to Prof. Baran’s
I teachings are not the type to be
j easily taken in, and they have
all had previous courses designed
to facilitate an understanding of
| world economic problems.”
THE NEXT sentence repeats
that there have been no com-
I plaints against Baran’s classroom
activities and continues that no
one has “said to us that he felt
he was being indoctrinated with
j Marxism.”
In a letter to another alumnus,
; obviously an important one, Ster
ling wrote that he was going to
| have Baran in for a talk and that,
i “If I’m to defend his freedom of
j speech. I want him to exercise
that freedom responsibly.” (That
meeting will be described tomor
row. )
Another alumnus who said he
was discontinuing contributions
to the University and he had per
suaded a friend to do the same,
was answered by Associate Direc
! lor of University Relations Don
ald Carlson with this reply:
“I CAN assure you (hat Dr.
Sterling deeply regrets that you
| no longer have confidence in the
| University and the desire to sup

port it.
“In my opinion your opinions l
of the University are wrong and
Prof. Baran’s opinions about Cas
tro are wrong, but I submit that
you are both entitled to express
your opinions and 1 respect your
right to them. I hope you will
also respect my right to mine.”
In another letter to an alumnus
Sterling quoted the University’s
policy on Communists on the fac
ulty:
“THAT WHILE membership in
any lawful organization is not, in
itself, grounds for disciplinary ac
tion by the University, it must be
recognized that a present mem
ber of the Communist Party of
j the United States is subject to a
discipline that is inconsistent
with professional integrity and
competence, and with academic
freedom and responsibility as
herein defined, and is. therefore,
unfit to serve on the Stanford
Faculty.”
