# 'Queen' Earns Her Title in Folk Ballad Concert
## 
### 
By -MARY LOU GREENBERG
Joan Baez more than lived up
to the title “Queen of American
folk singers” Monday night as
she performed to a capacity
crowd in Memorial Auditorium.
Conferred by Life magazine
last month, the title alone cannot
convey the clarity and simplicity
of expression and beautifully lilt-
I ing voice which give depth and
i meaning to every song she sings.
WHETHER singing spirituals,
"peace songs,” or love ballads
i (Monday’s program consisted pri
marily of the latter), Miss Baez
| is outstanding. And she can be
I equally good at comedy; her par
| ody on the rock-and-roll number,
j "Little Darlin,’ ” was hilarious
j and very well done.
Barefoot, wearing a plain blue
skirt, white blouse, and with her
long black hair hanging straight,
Miss Baez at time looked much
| younger than her 20 years, ap
j pearing shy and awkward. But
these moments came only be
tween numbers, as once she be
gan to play her guitar and sing,
she was as polished and profes
sional as the most experienced
stage performer. And more genu
ine and less commercial than
many.
Her songs are completely un
cluttered, and she uses no “audi
ence appeal” gimmicks. Yet Mon
day’s huge crowd sat in rapt at
tention throughout the program
and brought her back for three
curtain calls.
A SURPRISE came after inter
mission when Miss Baez asked
Ira Sandperl, local pacifist, to say
i a few words for her. He related

the following incident;
When Joan was going to Palo
Alto High School a district air
raid drill was scheduled, and that
day school was let out early.
In protest against this drill,
which she thought would only in
crease war fever rather than help
preserve peace, she staged a sit
down by herself and remained at
school despite entreaties by her
teachers and principal to leave.
SHE EVOKED admiration from
her peers for this act as she now
evokes admiration from all ages
for her voice. Instead of sitting
she now sings, and wo hope she’ll
he around for a long time.
