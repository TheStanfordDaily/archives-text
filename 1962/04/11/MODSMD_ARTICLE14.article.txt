CAMPUS DYNAMO
Editor, Tin* Daily:
Brad Efron’s article, “Campus
Dynamo Department,” is a typi
cal symptom of the disease which
affects the editorial page of The
Daily and, as such, has provoked
a discussion about the advisabili
ty of a comprehensive revision of
this department.
A section of the newspaper
which should and could be de
voted to well-expressed, intelli
gent student body opinion has be
come a vehicle in which a discon
tented few can air a variety of
gripes and grievances, often by
attacking personalities instead of
issues. This grows to frightening
proportions when one person is
consistently shown in an unfavor
able light so as to evoke “humor”
or assuage wounded egos.
Let's take the well-worn “Scot
ty Thompson Case” for an exam
ple. The great number of stu
dents on this campus who do not
know Mr. Thompson will certain
ly not he able to judge him fairly
if they read The Daily. If The
Daily intends to pursue the ques
tionable course of emphasizing
personalities, it would accomplish
more by running a controlled
series of articles.
“Scotty Thompson: Devil or
Angel” is not the issue here. But
should an alert student body have
to wake up each morning to a
continuous stream of immature
personal attacks which amount to
just so much wasted copy? If so,
I, for one. would enjoy reading a
two-week report on President
Sterling's dog. I hear he is a nice
fellow.

(Editor’s Note; The Daily’s
comments on Scotty Thompson's
recent national publicity have
been entirely free from malicious
intent. Our only interest has berm
for the entertainment and humor
value of the incident. It appears
from the reaction, however, (hat
one of the very few persons who
enjoys these carryings-on is S»-ot
ty Thompson.)

PEACE PITCH
Editor, The Daily;
Ira Sandperl’s “peace pitch” at
the Joan Baez concert Monday
evening was too similar to the so
liciting for (lie aged actors’ fund
by the movie industry. The cap
tive audience was extremely un
comfortable.

ple. The great number of stu
dents on this campus who do not
know Mr. Thompson will certain
ly not he able to judge him fairly
if they read The Daily. If The
Daily intends to pursue the ques
tionable course of emphasizing
personalities, it would accomplish
more by running a controlled
series of articles.
“Scotty Thompson: Devil or
Angel” is not the issue here. But
should an alert student body have
to wake up each morning to a
continuous stream of immature
personal attacks which amount to
just so much wasted copy? If so,
I, for one. would enjoy reading a
two-week report on President
Sterling's dog. I hear he is a nice
fellow.

comments on Scotty Thompson's
recent national publicity have
been entirely free from malicious

for the entertainment and humor
value of the incident. It appears
from the reaction, however, (hat
one of the very few persons who
enjoys these carryings-on is S»-ot

PEACE PITCH
Editor, The Daily;
Ira Sandperl’s “peace pitch” at
the Joan Baez concert Monday
evening was too similar to the so
liciting for (lie aged actors’ fund
by the movie industry. The cap

comfortable.

CAMPUS DYNAMO
Editor, Tin* Daily:
Brad Efron’s article, “Campus
Dynamo Department,” is a typi
cal symptom of the disease which
affects the editorial page of The
Daily and, as such, has provoked
a discussion about the advisabili
ty of a comprehensive revision of
this department.
A section of the newspaper
which should and could be de
voted to well-expressed, intelli
gent student body opinion has be
come a vehicle in which a discon
tented few can air a variety of
gripes and grievances, often by
attacking personalities instead of
issues. This grows to frightening
proportions when one person is
consistently shown in an unfavor
able light so as to evoke “humor”
or assuage wounded egos.
Let's take the well-worn “Scot
ty Thompson Case” for an exam
