# Chicago Cookie Crumblings
## 
### 
April Fool's Day is a popular
time for campus humor maga
zines and newspapers to revel in
parody. But the faculty at the
University of Chicago jumped the
gun recently with a special issue
of The Chicago Macaroon in hon
or of George Wells Beadle’s first
anniversary as Chancellor. The
real campus paper is called The
Maroon.

The Macaroon, which claims to
be “for smart cookies,” bears the
Latin motto, “Sic Frita Crust il
ium," translated as “That’s the
way the cookie crumbles.” Its
credo: “The college newspaper is
an institution developed by me
dieval civilization to distort the
news of the day, to foster discon
tent and disorder, to misinform
and to beguile public opinion and
to provide a superior level of
judgment and knowledge to that
of the faculty or the administra
tion.”
The lead story in the paper de
scribes the purchase by Chancel
lor Beadle, for some $600,000,000,
, of Harvard University—“includ
, ing libraries, Arthur Schlesinger
i Jr., Nathan Pusey and the Har
, vard Yard, which soon will have
. grass”—with the intention of
, moving it to Chicago.
