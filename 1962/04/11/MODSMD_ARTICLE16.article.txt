# OUR MAN ON THE FARM

Stanford started spring football practice last Monday, and from
information gleaned from press releases issued by Stanford Athletic
Publicity and the Big Five News Bureau, the Cards and Southern
California will be co-favored in the race for the AAWU champion
ship next season.
STANFORD, CALIFORNIA and UCLA have already begun
drills. SC starts April 23, and Washington, April 19.
SC is led by three of last year’s all-conference choices, plus the
swiftest backfield in the conference.
QUARTERBACK PETE BEATHARD, end Hal Bedsole, and full
back Ben Wilson were all-AAWU choices last year, and also return
ing is speedy Willie Brown, hampered last year by a foot injury. In
all, SC has 17 lettermen returning.
SC gets needed line help from JC transfers and a good frosh
team.
Washington is a solid club, with the exception of the key quar
terback spot. Kermit Jorgenson graduated, leaving Pete Older in
command of that position. Ohler was erratic, though at best is good.
CHARLIE MITCHELL, ONE of the best halfbacks in the coun
try, and linemen Ray Mansfield and Rod Scheyer could lead Wash
ington to the Big Five title.
UCLA has 20 lettermen. but loses 10 of 11 Rose Bowl starters.
The Bruins are also instituting the “T,” thus killing the single wing
on the Coast.
Kermit Alexander Returns
Kermit Alexander, shifted to fullback, is the only Rose Bowl
starter returning, but Mike Haffner at left half and quarterbacks
E/ell Singleton and Rob Smith can hardly he called inexperienced.
UCLA HAS FIRST STRING talent, but no depth. Five of (heir
lettermen are fullbacks, hut that’s their only deep position.
At Cal, the schedule is easier, and the team is better. Also, the
best Cal frosh team in a long time is expected to push a dozen men
to the varsity in key roles. The Bears also have quarterbacks Randy
Gold and Larry Balliet back, but both could he benched by soph
Craig Morton.
Cal reaped a harvest of good frosh halfbacks. Tom Blanchfield,
Tyrone Price, Greg Palamountain and Dennis Peacocke are likely to
fight it out for the starting berths.
GUARD-PUNTER ROGER Stull is the top Bear lineman.
As for Stanford, depth is possibly the Cards’ greatest attribute.
Coach Jack Curtice saw 83 turn out for spring practice, 28 of whom
are letter winners.

Ends, tackles and guards in
great number and quality will
make the Stanford line tough to
penetrate. Center may be a weak
spot, but three good frosh centers
could turn it into another strong
point.
STANFORD WILE he strong at
quarterback, with Steve Thurlow,
Jim Smith. Dick Ragsdale and
Clark Weaver; and in the defens
ive hackfield. Jim Shroyer. Gary
Sargent, Tim Hansel and Ed
Cummings.
As has been the case for years,
the Stanford bugaboo will he lack
of speed. The frosh had a little
more team speed than last year’s
varsity, but not enough to make
any significant contributions.
A good Stanford frosh team
adds even more riches to an al
ready wealthy defense.

Trojans Are the Team to Beat
Taking a look at Stanford title prospects, it appears that South
ern Cal is the team to beat. The Trojans have depth and speed, and
should be able to move the ball well against almost anyone.
WASHINGTON HAS the quarterback problem, but a solid line
and swift running backs.
UCLA has no depth, and must adjust to the “T”. Those who re
member what Stanford did to an Oregon State team not yet adjusted
to the “T” know that this is an important factor.
Cal has a number of fine frosh, but the returning lettermen
must still form the nucleus of the 1962 Cal football squad. Any team
that must depend as much as Cal does on untried sophs is not funda
mentally sound.
THAT LEAVES STANFORD. The Cards can stack their line
against anyone, with ends George Honore, Frank Patitucci, Steve
Pur sell, Chris Jossen and Chuck McCormick; tackles Charlie Buehier,
Frank Atkinson, C. B. Simons, A1 Hildebrand and Randy Vahan; and
guards Frank Dubrofsky, Steve Player, Marv Harris and Wayne
Pavlic.
The enemy can’t pass with Stanfords’ defensive backfield on the
hall. It will surprise me if Stanford gives up more than three touch
downs in any game, and I doubt if anyone will score even that many.
Can Stanford Score?
The only question is “Can Stanford score?” The feeling here is
that they will, with quarterbacks Thurlow and Ragsdale directing a
diversified attack and throwing enough passes to a talented group of
ends to break open the middle for a strong line-pounding attack
featuring Ed Cummings, Tony DeLellis and Ken Babajian carrying
the ball. Stanford will score the three touchdowns a game they need
to win.

THK PREDICTION here is that
Stanford will win the AAVVU
football title.


COACH JACK CURTICE
His team may win it all
