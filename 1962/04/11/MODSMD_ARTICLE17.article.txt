### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford boat Claremont Men’s
College 19-2 yesterday on Sunken
Daimond, and they earned every
one of their runs. When the
smoke had cleared from the aw
ful coinage. Stanford had belted
17 hits, including a grand slam
homer, two doubles and three
triples.
To make matters even worse
for the Stags, Stanford pitchers
Darrell Sutherland. Mark Miller
and Jim Lonhorg allowed only
one hit and struck out sixteen
in the three hour fifteen minute
marathon.
Things started off modestly
enough, when starter Sutherland
gave up two runs in the top of
the first inning on a walk, Clare
mont's only hit of the game, a
triple, and a wild pitch.
Stanford got one run back on
a walk to O. J. Solander, an in
field hit by Greg Post, and a
throwing error by the Stag short
stop.
However things picked up for
the Cards in the second on an
RBI double by Skip Lawrence and
a two-run single by Post.
Stanford didn’t score in the
first, but made the run column
in every inning after that. In the
fourth, they tallied four, with the
big blows a triple by Solander
and a double by Jim Chenu, each
of which drove in a run.
In the fifth, Stanford got two
more, mainly on Jack Allen’s
triple over the center fielder’s
head to straight away center.
Four more runs came in the
sixth, as with two out and a Stan
ford runner on first, Warren
Newell singled, Horn May walked.
Chuck French was hit by a pitch,
Bob Hensler walked, and Bob
Hollman singled, the latter hit
driving in two runs.
The eighth was all Hollman’s

as he blasted a grand slam home
run inside the park for Stanford’s
four runs.

Things started off modestly
enough, when starter Sutherland
gave up two runs in the top of
the first inning on a walk, Clare
mont's only hit of the game, a
triple, and a wild pitch.
Stanford got one run back on
a walk to O. J. Solander, an in
field hit by Greg Post, and a
throwing error by the Stag short
stop.
However things picked up for
the Cards in the second on an
RBI double by Skip Lawrence and
a two-run single by Post.
Stanford didn’t score in the
first, but made the run column
in every inning after that. In the
fourth, they tallied four, with the
big blows a triple by Solander
and a double by Jim Chenu, each
of which drove in a run.
In the fifth, Stanford got two
more, mainly on Jack Allen’s
triple over the center fielder’s
head to straight away center.
Four more runs came in the
sixth, as with two out and a Stan
ford runner on first, Warren
Newell singled, Horn May walked.
Chuck French was hit by a pitch,
Bob Hensler walked, and Bob
Hollman singled, the latter hit
driving in two runs.
The eighth was all Hollman’s

as he blasted a grand slam home
run inside the park for Stanford’s
four runs.
