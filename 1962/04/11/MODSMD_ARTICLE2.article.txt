(Editor’s Note; This Is the last in a series of three articles about
the sponsor program.)
The Women’s Sponsor Choosing Committee 1961-1962 has
asked Dean of Women Lucille Allen to comment on Stanford’s
sponsor system. The following observations reflect her views of

the challenge and value of the s
“Selection and election time

ponsor system.
s are almost here, and men and
♦■women students are asking them
selves the questions, shall I run?
Is it worth it to me? Can I make
a contribution to the campus?
Will my academic program stand
it? What does it add up to any
way?
“It is comparatively easy for a
student to dream of what he will
do in the future; it is harder to
respond to the necessity of the
here and now on this campus in
1962-63. This is a challenge. The
chief difference between the
brave and the cow'ardly is that
when both see the challenge, the
bravo meet it; the cowardly with
draw' to a safe position.
“One of the best ways to learn
the necessary skills in human re
lations is through experience.
Santayana says though man calls
himself rational, he is, of all ani
mals, the ‘most inconsistent in
his will and most distracted in his
thoughts . . . ’ Students who are
concerned, who are self-question

nature, who w'ant to contribute
as well as to receive from Stan
ford, can consider some student
posts in this light.
"THE FRESHMAN sponsor is
challenged to think of the fresh
man as a person of potential
greatness. He is challenged also
to come out of himself, his seli
centeredness and to meet with
stature the problems that need
clarification as the freshman en
ters Stanford and proceeds
through his first year.
“The sponsor is to the fresh
man the most important person
in the university, and for this
reason it is almost impossible for
a sponsor not to recognize his
own prejudices, prides, envies,
and hates. Often he is a better
per son, a better scholar, a happier
member of the family because he
has learned to face up to respon
sible living.
“In all of us there are seeds of
greatness. It is only through the
1 use of our best ideas and
thoughts that they have a chance
to grow. The sponsor program is
important to the freshman, to the
sponsor, and to Stanford. It is of
value in the present but especial
ly, it is also a part of the spon
sor’s equipment for future ac
complishment and leadership.”
