From Bagdad, Guam, Chili, Sa
moa. the Philippines, Nevada,
Arizona, but especially from
northern and central California
come children for treatment at
the Stanford Convalescent Home.
Their parents pay for the cost of
care and rehabilitation as they
can (about 6 per cent of the
Home’s 1961 income). The Con
Homo depends on private con
tributors to support its one hun
dred-man staff of medical special
ists, nurses, physical and occu
pational therapists, and teachers.
$12,000.00 is the goal Stanford
students have set for next week’s
Con Home Drive. This will give
the Home 2 per cent of its oper
ating expenses of $600,000.00 a
year. It costs $l,OOO a month to
keep a child in the Home. The
child’s average stay is 55 days.
Stanford’s connection with the
Con Home is not only a financial
one. Two of the staff doctors
teach on the Medical School fac
ulty. The Home uses University
facilities for some of its treat
ment and consults school doctors
on cases. In turn University pedi
atrics students study the 40 to 65
patients at the home, and nursing
students fulfill part of their train
ing there.
Founded in 1917 as a summer
camp for convalescent children of
the Stanford Clinic?, the Con
Home has developed its present
function in the last decade as a
rehabilitation center for children
with neuromuscular and ortho
pedic diseases. Once purely a
nursing institution it now has an
expanded study program of
chronic childhood diseases and
their treatment.
