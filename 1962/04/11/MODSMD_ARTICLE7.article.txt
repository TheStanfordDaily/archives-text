# Proposed Judiciary Praised
## 
### JIM WOOLSEY 
Any successful judicial system must have
two principal features: it must be clearly
structured and it must enjoy the confidence
of those over whom it has jurisdiction. The
revision of the Stanford judicial system was
undertaken in order to create the first of
these vital conditions and to significantly
improve the second.
The structure of the A.S.S.U. judicial sys
tem has been a constant source of befuddle
ment to those connected with it. Students
have long been confused about and unduly
suspicious of the deans’ role in the judicial
process. Since in many cases it was the job
of the deans' office to determine which ju
dicial council had jurisdiction students often
felt that the deans always led council mem
bers by the hand through mazes of some
times-followed precedent and expediently
flexible university policy.
STUDENT CONFIDENCE in the judicial
system was also weakened by its lack of
formal structure, or, less euphemistically, by
the fact that it was not really a system at
all. Although the old constitution made it
possible for a higher council to review the
decisions of lower councils, no formal ma
chinery for such review was provided; even
had the machinery existed, it is doubtful
whether men’s and women's council, already
overworked, would have had the time to
review all reports from subordinate coun
cils.

Unclear structure and confusing paths of
appeal and recall were not, however, the
only sources of student and administration
criticism. II was generally agreed that as a
process of choosing judicial council mem
bers, all-campus elections were more than
unsatisfactory. Many potentially-excellent
judicial council members hesitated to subject
themselves to the pressure and the political
rat-race of an election.
THE OLD adage, “The judicial mind does
not seek election,” has here contained more
than a kernel of truth. This reluctance was
clearly evidenced by the dearth of candidates
for judicial positions from many living areas;
off campus residents, for example, often felt
it useless to oppose a candidate having the
financial and political backing of an entire
fraternity. It was felt that some sort of pro
cedure could be found which would make it
equally possible for all capable students to
serve in this important and theoretically non
political capacity.
SEVERAL CHANGES, which should go
far toward eliminating these difficulties, are
being submitted to you for approval in the
new constitution. First of all, the office of
student judicial coordinator is created. This
person, appointed by the ASSU president,
| will be responsible for keeping records, de
j termining jurisdiction, assisting those ac
| cused of Fundamental Standard and Honor
I Code violations, and assisting the principal
j councils in reviewing the cases of subordi
-1 nate councils.

Most all of his functions will be advisory:
he has little real power but a great deal of
responsibility, for without him, the judicial
system cannot function smoothly and effici
ently. Since complaints and questions will be
referred to him, there will be no more basis
for the charge that the deans are the major
domos behind the student councils.
Secondly, jurisdiction has been clarified
in certain areas where it was hertofore un
clear. The procedure under which the higher
councils referred cases to subordinate coun
cils is retained, but reports must bo submitted
to be scrutinized by the higher council and
the student judicial co-ordinator.
SUCH A PROCEDURE should insure that
cases will be referred to living group coun
cils and other subordinate councils only as
long as these councils act in a responsible
manner.
Finally, men’s council wall be appointed
by a board consisting of the ASSU presi
dent, the president of men’s council, and the
student judicial co-ordinator; women's coun
cil will be appointed by a similar board con
sisting of the president of the AWS, the
president of women’s council, and the stu
dent judicial co-ordinator. All will be given
the opportunity to try out.
It is hoped that these and other minor re
visions in the judicial structure will provide
Stanford with a judicial system which is
clearly defined and which enjoys the fullest
confidence of the administration and all stu
dents.

structured and it must enjoy the confidence
of those over whom it has jurisdiction. The
revision of the Stanford judicial system was
undertaken in order to create the first of
these vital conditions and to significantly
improve the second.
The structure of the A.S.S.U. judicial sys
tem has been a constant source of befuddle
ment to those connected with it. Students
have long been confused about and unduly
suspicious of the deans’ role in the judicial
process. Since in many cases it was the job
of the deans' office to determine which ju
dicial council had jurisdiction students often
felt that the deans always led council mem
bers by the hand through mazes of some
times-followed precedent and expediently
flexible university policy.
STUDENT CONFIDENCE in the judicial
system was also weakened by its lack of
formal structure, or, less euphemistically, by
the fact that it was not really a system at
all. Although the old constitution made it
possible for a higher council to review the
decisions of lower councils, no formal ma
chinery for such review was provided; even
had the machinery existed, it is doubtful
whether men’s and women's council, already
overworked, would have had the time to
review all reports from subordinate coun
cils.

Unclear structure and confusing paths of
appeal and recall were not, however, the
only sources of student and administration
criticism. II was generally agreed that as a
process of choosing judicial council mem
bers, all-campus elections were more than
unsatisfactory. Many potentially-excellent
judicial council members hesitated to subject
themselves to the pressure and the political
rat-race of an election.
THE OLD adage, “The judicial mind does
not seek election,” has here contained more
than a kernel of truth. This reluctance was
clearly evidenced by the dearth of candidates
for judicial positions from many living areas;
off campus residents, for example, often felt
it useless to oppose a candidate having the
financial and political backing of an entire
fraternity. It was felt that some sort of pro
cedure could be found which would make it
equally possible for all capable students to
serve in this important and theoretically non
political capacity.
SEVERAL CHANGES, which should go
far toward eliminating these difficulties, are
being submitted to you for approval in the
new constitution. First of all, the office of
student judicial coordinator is created. This
person, appointed by the ASSU president,
| will be responsible for keeping records, de
j termining jurisdiction, assisting those ac
| cused of Fundamental Standard and Honor
I Code violations, and assisting the principal
j councils in reviewing the cases of subordi
-1 nate councils.

Most all of his functions will be advisory:
he has little real power but a great deal of
responsibility, for without him, the judicial
system cannot function smoothly and effici
ently. Since complaints and questions will be
referred to him, there will be no more basis
for the charge that the deans are the major
domos behind the student councils.
Secondly, jurisdiction has been clarified
in certain areas where it was hertofore un
clear. The procedure under which the higher
councils referred cases to subordinate coun
cils is retained, but reports must bo submitted
to be scrutinized by the higher council and
the student judicial co-ordinator.
SUCH A PROCEDURE should insure that
cases will be referred to living group coun
cils and other subordinate councils only as
long as these councils act in a responsible
manner.
Finally, men’s council wall be appointed
by a board consisting of the ASSU presi
dent, the president of men’s council, and the
student judicial co-ordinator; women's coun
cil will be appointed by a similar board con
sisting of the president of the AWS, the
president of women’s council, and the stu
dent judicial co-ordinator. All will be given
the opportunity to try out.
It is hoped that these and other minor re
visions in the judicial structure will provide
Stanford with a judicial system which is
clearly defined and which enjoys the fullest
confidence of the administration and all stu
dents.

revision of the Stanford judicial system was
undertaken in order to create the first of
these vital conditions and to significantly
improve the second.
The structure of the A.S.S.U. judicial sys
tem has been a constant source of befuddle
ment to those connected with it. Students
have long been confused about and unduly
suspicious of the deans’ role in the judicial
process. Since in many cases it was the job
of the deans' office to determine which ju
dicial council had jurisdiction students often
felt that the deans always led council mem
bers by the hand through mazes of some
times-followed precedent and expediently
flexible university policy.
STUDENT CONFIDENCE in the judicial
system was also weakened by its lack of
formal structure, or, less euphemistically, by
the fact that it was not really a system at
all. Although the old constitution made it
possible for a higher council to review the
decisions of lower councils, no formal ma
chinery for such review was provided; even
had the machinery existed, it is doubtful
whether men’s and women's council, already
overworked, would have had the time to
review all reports from subordinate coun
cils.

Unclear structure and confusing paths of
appeal and recall were not, however, the
only sources of student and administration
criticism. II was generally agreed that as a
process of choosing judicial council mem
bers, all-campus elections were more than
unsatisfactory. Many potentially-excellent
judicial council members hesitated to subject
themselves to the pressure and the political
rat-race of an election.
THE OLD adage, “The judicial mind does
not seek election,” has here contained more
than a kernel of truth. This reluctance was
clearly evidenced by the dearth of candidates
for judicial positions from many living areas;
off campus residents, for example, often felt
it useless to oppose a candidate having the
financial and political backing of an entire
fraternity. It was felt that some sort of pro
cedure could be found which would make it
equally possible for all capable students to
serve in this important and theoretically non
political capacity.
SEVERAL CHANGES, which should go
far toward eliminating these difficulties, are
being submitted to you for approval in the
new constitution. First of all, the office of
student judicial coordinator is created. This
person, appointed by the ASSU president,
| will be responsible for keeping records, de
j termining jurisdiction, assisting those ac
| cused of Fundamental Standard and Honor
I Code violations, and assisting the principal
j councils in reviewing the cases of subordi
-1 nate councils.

Most all of his functions will be advisory:
he has little real power but a great deal of
responsibility, for without him, the judicial
system cannot function smoothly and effici
ently. Since complaints and questions will be
referred to him, there will be no more basis
for the charge that the deans are the major
domos behind the student councils.
Secondly, jurisdiction has been clarified
in certain areas where it was hertofore un
clear. The procedure under which the higher
councils referred cases to subordinate coun
cils is retained, but reports must bo submitted
to be scrutinized by the higher council and
the student judicial co-ordinator.
SUCH A PROCEDURE should insure that
cases will be referred to living group coun
cils and other subordinate councils only as
long as these councils act in a responsible
manner.
Finally, men’s council wall be appointed
by a board consisting of the ASSU presi
dent, the president of men’s council, and the
student judicial co-ordinator; women's coun
cil will be appointed by a similar board con
sisting of the president of the AWS, the
president of women’s council, and the stu
dent judicial co-ordinator. All will be given
the opportunity to try out.
It is hoped that these and other minor re
visions in the judicial structure will provide
Stanford with a judicial system which is
clearly defined and which enjoys the fullest
confidence of the administration and all stu
dents.
