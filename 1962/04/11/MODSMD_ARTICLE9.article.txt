“We no longer treat opera pro
duction as a form of art which
has to deal with idiots,” said Bor
is Goldovsky, opera producer, in
last night’s Tuesday Evening
Series’ lecture-recital.
"The new approach to opera
is to train the young singer to
synchronize acting and singing,”
continued pianist Goldovsky. The
versatile lecturer-teacher discuss
ed the new trends in Opera The
ater which combines the stage
crafts with musical composition.
Goldovsky illustrated the regu
lization of instrumental sense to
the human sense of a stage play
by playing excerpts from the
“Marriage of Figaro” by Mozart.
He explained that the new type
of conductor and director of
Opera Theater attempts to “de
code the musical argument in or
der to justify the stage play,”
Some of the problems of syn
chronization of music and stage
action are met by new electronic
devices, said Goldovsky. The tolo
tact is worn inside the clothes of
the performer to give him a tac
tile cue to the beat of the opera’s
music. Acoustical scenery made
of fiber glass is used to overcome
the problems of poorly built audi
toriums, explained Goldovsky.
Goldovsky concluded the lec
ture with a piece written by Cho
pin to illustrate the operatic de
vice of embellishment.
Goldovsky received the Pea
body award for his radio pro
gram, “Metropolitan Opera News
of the Air.” He is head of the
Opera departments of the New
England Conservatory and the
Berkshire Music Festival and con
ducts touring opera companies
throughout the nation.
