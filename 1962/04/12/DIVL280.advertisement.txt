CRAM COURSE NO. If
MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORY
The school year draws rapidly to a close, and it’s been a fnn
year, wbat with learning the twist, attending public executions,
and walking our cheetahs—but are we ready for final exams?
Some of us, I fear, are not. Therefore, in these few remaining
columns, I propose to forego levity and instead offer a series
of cram courses so that we may all be prepared at exam time.
We will start with Modern European History. Strictly de
fined, Modern European History covers the history of Europe
from January 1, 19112, to the present. However, in order to
provide employment for more teachers, the course has been
moved back to the Age of Pericles, or the Renaissance, as it is
jocularly called.
The single most important fact to remember about Modern
European History is the emergence of Prussia. As we all know,
Prussia was originally called Russia. The “P” was purchased
from Persia in 1X74 for $24 and Manhattan Island. This later
became known as Guy Fawkes Day.
Persia, without a “P” was, of course, called Ersia. This so
embarrassed the natives that they changed the name of the
country to Iran. This led to a rash of name changing. Mesopo
tamia became Iraq, Schleswig-Holstein became Saxe-Coburg,
Bosnia-Herzegovina became Cleveland. There was even talk in
stable old England about changing the name of the country,
but it was forgotten when the little princes escaped from the
Tower and set fire to Pitt, the Elder.
Meanwhile Johannes Gutenberg was quietly inventing the
printing press, for which we may all be grateful, believe you
me! Why grateful? I’ll tell you why grateful. Because without
Gutenberg’s invention, there would be no printing on cigarette
packs. You would not know when you bought cigarettes whether
you were getting good Marlboros or some horrid imitation. You
could never be sure that you were buying a full-flavored smoke
with a pure white filter, a cigarette that lets you settle back
and get comfortable—in short, a Marlboro. It is a prospect to
chill the bones and turn the blood to sorghum—so if you are
ever in Frank-furt am Main, drop in and say thanks to Mr.
Gutenberg. He is elderly—408 years old last birthday—but
still quite active in his laboratory. In fact, only last Tuesday he
invented the German short-haired pointer.
But I digress. Bark to Modern European History. Let us
turn now to that ever popular favorite, France.
France, as we all know, is divided into several departments.

There is the Police Department, the Fire Department, the
* Gas and Water Department, and the Bureau of Weights and
Measures. There is also Madame Pompadour, but that need
not concern us because it is a dirty story and is only taught to
graduate students.
Finally, let us take up Italy—the newest European nation,
Italy did not become a unified state until 1848 when Garibaldi,
favour, and Victor Emmanuel threw three coins in the Trevi
Fountain. This lovely gesture so enchanted all of Europe that
William of Orange married Mary Stuart and caused a potato
famine in Ireland. This, in turn, resulted in Pitt, the Younger.
All of this may seem a bit complicated, but be of good cheer.
Everything was happily resolved at the Congress of Vienna
where Metternich traded Parma to Talleyrand for Mad Ludwig
of Bavaria. Then everybody waltzed till dawn and then, tired
but content, they started the Thirty Years’ War. © isea Maxsuuiman
