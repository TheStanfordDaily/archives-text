# IIR Initiates Dining Program for Foreign Students
## 
### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
(Editor’s Note: This is the third of a four
part series on foreign students at Stanford.)
For years students have discussed the ad
vantages of having foreign students eat in
the dormitories. However, no action was car
ried through on the idea.
Now, after a year of concentrated effort,
the HR has established an organized pro
gram allowing foreign students to eat in the
dormitories.
The idea is simple. Foreign students and
Americans are often anxious to get to know
one another, yet the pressures of studies
sometimes inhibit such contact. Meals are
an activity necessary for everyone. Why not
provide the situation where foreign and
American students can meet at meals? And
this is exactly what the HR has done through
a year of effort.
The program is flexible. The HR realizes

that houses will want different kinds of ar
rangements. Some will want to practically
“adopt” a foreign student. Others will want
a weekly meal or simply an occasional meal
with foreign students. The houses may
choose among three types of programs, in
cluding 1) an invitation to a foreign student
on a single occasion; 2) an invitation for a
foreign student to eat either lunch or dinner
weekly with a residence; and 3) an invitation
for the foreign student to eat either lunch
or dinner five or seven days a week at the
dormitory.
THE FINANCIAL arrangements will de
pend both on the student and the house. For
those students who now eat at Encina, the
meal ticket is transferrable to any Universi
ty dormitory, provided they make the proper
arrangements. Previously, a foreign student
eating at a dormitory had to pay double for
his meal if he had an Encina meal ticket
since he had to pay again at the dormitory.
Those eating at places other than Encina will
need to buy the kind of meal ticket they

want. The house may pay any part of this,
but need not feel obligated to do so.
Vic Affolter, who has spearheaded this
project, expects that the change in financial
arrangements and the establishment of a
structure through which students can ar
range for a foreign student to eat in the
dorms will greatly increase foreign and
American students’ contact.

IN THE PAST individuals have struggled
to introduce some kind of eating program
in their dorms. Their efforts have been frus
trated, however, by the lack of any coordi
nating agency.
But the HR’s work is just beginning. The
success of the program will depend on the
officers and individuals in each of the houses.
As minimum essentials for having a foreign
student in the dormitory, a house must in
vite the student in writing, act as a host, and
assume definite responsibility for carrying
out the objectives of the program. Affolter,
in his memorandum to house officers, sug
gests that each living group have a commit

tee responsible for hosting the foreign stu
dent.

The program will involve responsibility
for many people. Affolter expects to have
two to three people in every house as active
participants in the program. They will need
to meet foreign students, suggest one to
their houses and initiate the action neces
sary for participating in the program.

SOME STUDENTS will feel it is difficult
to meet foreign students and hard to know
whom to invite. Affolter has suggested the
Friday afternoon coffee hours as an ideal
means for informal contact. Single or weekly
meal invitations also afford an opportunity
for such contact.

Before a student “joins” the house on the
five- or seven-day program, the HR hopes
that he and the members of the house will
become well acquainted with each other.
Affolter and the 20 students working ac
tively with him, as well as the Director of
Dining Halls, Mrs. Dorothy 8011, Foreign
Student Advisor, Werner Warmbrunn and

Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigles have
expended their efforts on this program in the
hope that it will help to integrate the for
eign students into Stanford life.
AFFOLTER feels, “Basically foreign stu
dents on our campus are interested in more
than just studying. They are generally very
interested in learning about our culture and
customs about us.” For the Americans,
also, there is much to be learned. Affolter
noted that paradoxically although Americans
are willing to spend hours reading about for
eign countries, they ignore the foreign stu
dents around them who may be just as in
formative as the New York Times.

Affolter, his committee, and the many stu
dents indirectly involved with this program
hope that the new dining situation will en
courage more exchange between American
and foreign students. They feel the potential
benefit is great to all concerned.

eign students.
(Editor’s Note: This is the third of a four
part series on foreign students at Stanford.)
For years students have discussed the ad
vantages of having foreign students eat in
the dormitories. However, no action was car
ried through on the idea.
Now, after a year of concentrated effort,
the HR has established an organized pro
gram allowing foreign students to eat in the
dormitories.
The idea is simple. Foreign students and
Americans are often anxious to get to know
one another, yet the pressures of studies
sometimes inhibit such contact. Meals are
an activity necessary for everyone. Why not
provide the situation where foreign and
American students can meet at meals? And
this is exactly what the HR has done through
a year of effort.
The program is flexible. The HR realizes

that houses will want different kinds of ar
rangements. Some will want to practically
“adopt” a foreign student. Others will want
a weekly meal or simply an occasional meal
with foreign students. The houses may
choose among three types of programs, in
cluding 1) an invitation to a foreign student
on a single occasion; 2) an invitation for a
foreign student to eat either lunch or dinner
weekly with a residence; and 3) an invitation
for the foreign student to eat either lunch
or dinner five or seven days a week at the
dormitory.
THE FINANCIAL arrangements will de
pend both on the student and the house. For
those students who now eat at Encina, the
meal ticket is transferrable to any Universi
ty dormitory, provided they make the proper
arrangements. Previously, a foreign student
eating at a dormitory had to pay double for
his meal if he had an Encina meal ticket
since he had to pay again at the dormitory.
Those eating at places other than Encina will
need to buy the kind of meal ticket they

want. The house may pay any part of this,
but need not feel obligated to do so.
Vic Affolter, who has spearheaded this
project, expects that the change in financial
arrangements and the establishment of a
structure through which students can ar
range for a foreign student to eat in the
dorms will greatly increase foreign and
American students’ contact.

IN THE PAST individuals have struggled
to introduce some kind of eating program
in their dorms. Their efforts have been frus
trated, however, by the lack of any coordi
nating agency.
But the HR’s work is just beginning. The
success of the program will depend on the
officers and individuals in each of the houses.
As minimum essentials for having a foreign
student in the dormitory, a house must in
vite the student in writing, act as a host, and
assume definite responsibility for carrying
out the objectives of the program. Affolter,
in his memorandum to house officers, sug
gests that each living group have a commit

tee responsible for hosting the foreign stu
dent.

The program will involve responsibility
for many people. Affolter expects to have
two to three people in every house as active
participants in the program. They will need
to meet foreign students, suggest one to
their houses and initiate the action neces
sary for participating in the program.

SOME STUDENTS will feel it is difficult
to meet foreign students and hard to know
whom to invite. Affolter has suggested the
Friday afternoon coffee hours as an ideal
means for informal contact. Single or weekly
meal invitations also afford an opportunity
for such contact.

Before a student “joins” the house on the
five- or seven-day program, the HR hopes
that he and the members of the house will
become well acquainted with each other.
Affolter and the 20 students working ac
tively with him, as well as the Director of
Dining Halls, Mrs. Dorothy 8011, Foreign
Student Advisor, Werner Warmbrunn and

Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigles have
expended their efforts on this program in the
hope that it will help to integrate the for
eign students into Stanford life.
AFFOLTER feels, “Basically foreign stu
dents on our campus are interested in more
than just studying. They are generally very
interested in learning about our culture and
customs about us.” For the Americans,
also, there is much to be learned. Affolter
noted that paradoxically although Americans
are willing to spend hours reading about for
eign countries, they ignore the foreign stu
dents around them who may be just as in
formative as the New York Times.

Affolter, his committee, and the many stu
dents indirectly involved with this program
hope that the new dining situation will en
courage more exchange between American
and foreign students. They feel the potential
benefit is great to all concerned.

For years students have discussed the ad
vantages of having foreign students eat in
the dormitories. However, no action was car
ried through on the idea.
Now, after a year of concentrated effort,
the HR has established an organized pro
gram allowing foreign students to eat in the
dormitories.
The idea is simple. Foreign students and
Americans are often anxious to get to know
one another, yet the pressures of studies
sometimes inhibit such contact. Meals are
an activity necessary for everyone. Why not
provide the situation where foreign and
American students can meet at meals? And
this is exactly what the HR has done through
a year of effort.
The program is flexible. The HR realizes

that houses will want different kinds of ar
rangements. Some will want to practically
“adopt” a foreign student. Others will want
a weekly meal or simply an occasional meal
with foreign students. The houses may
choose among three types of programs, in
cluding 1) an invitation to a foreign student
on a single occasion; 2) an invitation for a
foreign student to eat either lunch or dinner
weekly with a residence; and 3) an invitation
for the foreign student to eat either lunch
or dinner five or seven days a week at the
dormitory.
THE FINANCIAL arrangements will de
pend both on the student and the house. For
those students who now eat at Encina, the
meal ticket is transferrable to any Universi
ty dormitory, provided they make the proper
arrangements. Previously, a foreign student
eating at a dormitory had to pay double for
his meal if he had an Encina meal ticket
since he had to pay again at the dormitory.
Those eating at places other than Encina will
need to buy the kind of meal ticket they

want. The house may pay any part of this,
but need not feel obligated to do so.
Vic Affolter, who has spearheaded this
project, expects that the change in financial
arrangements and the establishment of a
structure through which students can ar
range for a foreign student to eat in the
dorms will greatly increase foreign and
American students’ contact.

IN THE PAST individuals have struggled
to introduce some kind of eating program
in their dorms. Their efforts have been frus
trated, however, by the lack of any coordi
nating agency.
But the HR’s work is just beginning. The
success of the program will depend on the
officers and individuals in each of the houses.
As minimum essentials for having a foreign
student in the dormitory, a house must in
vite the student in writing, act as a host, and
assume definite responsibility for carrying
out the objectives of the program. Affolter,
in his memorandum to house officers, sug
gests that each living group have a commit

tee responsible for hosting the foreign stu
dent.

The program will involve responsibility
for many people. Affolter expects to have
two to three people in every house as active
participants in the program. They will need
to meet foreign students, suggest one to
their houses and initiate the action neces
sary for participating in the program.

SOME STUDENTS will feel it is difficult
to meet foreign students and hard to know
whom to invite. Affolter has suggested the
Friday afternoon coffee hours as an ideal
means for informal contact. Single or weekly
meal invitations also afford an opportunity
for such contact.

Before a student “joins” the house on the
five- or seven-day program, the HR hopes
that he and the members of the house will
become well acquainted with each other.
Affolter and the 20 students working ac
tively with him, as well as the Director of
Dining Halls, Mrs. Dorothy 8011, Foreign
Student Advisor, Werner Warmbrunn and

Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigles have
expended their efforts on this program in the
hope that it will help to integrate the for
eign students into Stanford life.
AFFOLTER feels, “Basically foreign stu
dents on our campus are interested in more
than just studying. They are generally very
interested in learning about our culture and
customs about us.” For the Americans,
also, there is much to be learned. Affolter
noted that paradoxically although Americans
are willing to spend hours reading about for
eign countries, they ignore the foreign stu
dents around them who may be just as in
formative as the New York Times.

Affolter, his committee, and the many stu
dents indirectly involved with this program
hope that the new dining situation will en
courage more exchange between American
and foreign students. They feel the potential
benefit is great to all concerned.
