# STANFORD AND THE RIGHT-WING
## Fund Drives, Academic Freedom and Paul Baran 
### 
(Editor's Note: Tltis is the |
fourth of five articles.)
The fall of 19(!0 was a tumultu-!
ous period in the life of Paul i
Baran, Stanford economics pro
fessor and Marxist.
Baran returned from a three-|
week trip to Cuba and gave a |
speech praising Castro before the
student body. Then, Baran says. !
the uproar started.
“I GOT ill and went to the hos- :
pital. The storm started while 11
was there. When I got out a ;
couple of months later, I received I
a call to see Dr. Sterling.” The
meeting was March 14.
“It was hard to pin down his
position. His main point was to }
ask me if I was a member of the 1
Communist Party. I repeated to |
him that I wasn’t. I had told him I
so before.
“He said he often has a hard
time defending academic freedom
and that he wanted my help. I j
(old him I couldn’t promise any-1
thing except to speak what I
thought was the truth.
“I DON'T know whether I said
it then, hut I have felt all the time !
that the University should get }
money but money should be for j
the University; the University |
shouldn’t be for money,”
More so than most professors, j
Baran is concerned with academic
freedom. This is probably because |
he is one of a very few who uses |
it to say things with which a vast j
majority of his listeners violent- j
ly disagree.
“There is a more serious prob- i
lem than with old fuddy-duddies
like me. There is more trouble
with young people who haven’t
got tenure. What happens to
younger people if they want to
get ahead or get an academic ap
pointment?
“I KNOW a young scientist
who worked for the Standard Oil
Co. He wrote an article showing
that underdeveloped countries
don't benefit from their own oil.
He was fired and now he works
for the UN.
“Stories like this spread like
wildfire. Kids start scratching

their heads and asking, ‘Tr this
what I want to do?’
“It’s a phony issue anyhow. |
There is no trouble with scientists
as long as their political and phil
osophical beliefs don’t interfere
with academic work and as long
as (hey keep their mouths shut.
Only in the social sciences and
humanities do they know or care
if you’re a Marxist or a socialist.” [
BARAN IS obviously displeased
by some of the statements writ-j
ten by the administration to com-1
plaining alumni. He thinks the 1
University should defend his right |
to his opinions in terms of aca- j
demic freedom and not in terms
of tenure.
He says that by bringing up the ;
point of tenure the administration
implies he would be fired if he !
didn’t have it.
“Bringing up tenure is bad. I
What about the academic free-1
rom of all those people without j
tenure? Can academic freedom
only apply to those who have ten
ure? What about instructors, as
sistant professors and others J
without tenure?
“SOMETIMES the University I
can brag about having someone
controversial on the faculty. They I
can say, ‘Look, we keep a guy \
like him around.’ It’s more trou-1
hie sometimes to fire you.”
Last year was the first time I
since he’s been at Stanford that!
Baran did not receive a raise in j
salary. He was proposed for such
a raise by his own department
and it was refused by the admin
istration. Baran says he has rea
son to believe that it was because
of his statements on Cuba.
“A discriminatory atmosphere
undoubtedly exist,” Baran says.
“It expresses itself in many ways:
in my being ineligible for various
foundation grants, in my teaching
assignments and the like. One
feels, after all,” he added, “when
one is not wanted.
“IF I WERE to go, I am sure
no one in the administration
woidd be sorry about my leaving.
The administration would retire
for a drink.”

The fall of 19(!0 was a tumultu-!
ous period in the life of Paul i
Baran, Stanford economics pro
fessor and Marxist.
Baran returned from a three-|
week trip to Cuba and gave a |
speech praising Castro before the
student body. Then, Baran says. !
the uproar started.
“I GOT ill and went to the hos- :
pital. The storm started while 11
was there. When I got out a ;
couple of months later, I received I
a call to see Dr. Sterling.” The
meeting was March 14.
“It was hard to pin down his
position. His main point was to }
ask me if I was a member of the 1
Communist Party. I repeated to |
him that I wasn’t. I had told him I
so before.
“He said he often has a hard
time defending academic freedom
and that he wanted my help. I j
(old him I couldn’t promise any-1
thing except to speak what I
thought was the truth.
“I DON'T know whether I said
it then, hut I have felt all the time !
that the University should get }
money but money should be for j
the University; the University |
shouldn’t be for money,”
More so than most professors, j
Baran is concerned with academic
freedom. This is probably because |
he is one of a very few who uses |
it to say things with which a vast j
majority of his listeners violent- j
ly disagree.
“There is a more serious prob- i
lem than with old fuddy-duddies
like me. There is more trouble
with young people who haven’t
got tenure. What happens to
younger people if they want to
get ahead or get an academic ap
pointment?
“I KNOW a young scientist
who worked for the Standard Oil
Co. He wrote an article showing
that underdeveloped countries
don't benefit from their own oil.
He was fired and now he works
for the UN.
“Stories like this spread like
wildfire. Kids start scratching

their heads and asking, ‘Tr this
what I want to do?’
“It’s a phony issue anyhow. |
There is no trouble with scientists
as long as their political and phil
osophical beliefs don’t interfere
with academic work and as long
as (hey keep their mouths shut.
Only in the social sciences and
humanities do they know or care
if you’re a Marxist or a socialist.” [
BARAN IS obviously displeased
by some of the statements writ-j
ten by the administration to com-1
plaining alumni. He thinks the 1
University should defend his right |
to his opinions in terms of aca- j
demic freedom and not in terms
of tenure.
He says that by bringing up the ;
point of tenure the administration
implies he would be fired if he !
didn’t have it.
“Bringing up tenure is bad. I
What about the academic free-1
rom of all those people without j
tenure? Can academic freedom
only apply to those who have ten
ure? What about instructors, as
sistant professors and others J
without tenure?
“SOMETIMES the University I
can brag about having someone
controversial on the faculty. They I
can say, ‘Look, we keep a guy \
like him around.’ It’s more trou-1
hie sometimes to fire you.”
Last year was the first time I
since he’s been at Stanford that!
Baran did not receive a raise in j
salary. He was proposed for such
a raise by his own department
and it was refused by the admin
istration. Baran says he has rea
son to believe that it was because
of his statements on Cuba.
