DANGEROUS TENDENCY
Editor, The Daily:
Thank you for printing Mr.
Goldmar’s clarification of Miss
Baez’s brazen attempt to sell
peace along with her folksongs.
This dangerous tendency among

paid entertainers to have opinions
should be stifled before it gets out
of control. Who knows if this
sort of behavior is allowed to con
tinue it could endanger the all
important, arms race.
James Fadiman
