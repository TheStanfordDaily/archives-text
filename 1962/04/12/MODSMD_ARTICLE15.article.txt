## Brasilia Deeply Rooted in Country's History 
### RICHARD G. OFFUTT 
Brasilia forms a federal district,
but was not born as Washington,
D.C., out of a desire for isolation,
freeing it from the influences of
political passions. A better paral
lel in the founding of new capi
tals was the removal of Austra
lia’s capital to Canberra to negate
the dispute between two cities for
metropolitan privileges, in the
one case Sydney and Melbourne
and in the other Rio de Janiero
and Sao Paulo.
Brasilia’s primary stimulus,
however, is deeply rooted in
Brazilian history. As early as 1789
the first independence movements
championed the idea: a capital
founded by Brasilians and not
Portuguese.
THEN IN the early 19th cen
tury the necessity of an inland
capital graduated from a revolu
tionary dream to a republican
opinion and was included in the
early constitutions. It was sanc
tioned by law and appeared on
maps in various locations but
first reached the construction
stage under President Kubits
check in 1955.
He presented the governmental
sentiments toward Brasilia in the
following statement inscribed on
the golden wall in the Palace of
the Dawn: “From this central
plateau, from this solitude which
will soon be transformed into the
brain of all high national de
cisions, I cast once more my
glance on the morrow of my coun
try and see the dawn with un
breakable faith and unlimited

confidence in its destiny.”
Faith in the Sertao, Brasil’s im
mense undeveloped interior, was
the key to Kubitscheck's energet
ic efforts. Ninety-three per cent
of the population lives in thirty
six per cent of the territorial sur
face. and the chief developmental
problems lie in these practically
uninhabited hinterlands which
were easily forgotten or neglect
ed, as long as the legislative ses
sions were held in the sanctuary
of Rio.
TDK FUTURE beckons in Bra
zil’s move to the West, but it has
not been easy to “force” the gov
ernment officials to give up the
relative comfort and charm of
Rio and take up permanent resi
dence in Brasilia. Many still fly
home at the close of the daily ses
sions, and the “full session” has
been the exception rather than the
rule.
On the other hand many initial
difficulties have been erased by
zeal in other spheres. Road and
railway connections deemed im
possible are almost completed
linking the new capital with all
important points from Belem to
Sao Paulo and from Cuiaba to
Recife. This eases the transporta
tion problems, which left Brasilia
a child and victim of the air-age
in the beginning. Moreover most
of t he foreign embassies are now
under construction in the new
capital.
The building costs have pre
sented another obstacle, and even
though the finances are held in
strict secrecy, rumors leaked out
that the Brasilian government al

loted $6O million in 1961 for the
project. Upon hearing this astro
nomical sum and looking at the
more urgent problems of his
land, the average citizen merely
shrugs his shoulders and repeats
Quadros’ statement: “It may
have been insane to start, but it is
impossible to stop.”
P II B L I C opinion concerning
Brasilia is best described in re
spect to a myth. Brasilia is the
foundation of a modern Brazilian
mythology. Indians occasionally
get their ears boxed for playing
on the escalators in the bus ter
minal, but the policemen smile as
they chase them in the direction
of another escalator. The city

buses halt and the passengers j
get out to watch wild animals
running through the brush.
Shoeless farmers with scrubby |
beards surrounded by their
hordes of children gasp in awe ;
at the new buildings, and busi- i
nessmen in coat and tie stop and j
chat with country women nurs
ing their children on the Avenida
Monumental.
All the formerly separated ele
ments of this huge nation meet
and seek understanding in Brasil
ia. Some criticism exists due to
an occasional power failure or
other details, but nobody criti
cizes the project itself. Who criti
cizes a myth?

Brasilia forms a federal district,
but was not born as Washington,
D.C., out of a desire for isolation,
freeing it from the influences of
political passions. A better paral
lel in the founding of new capi
tals was the removal of Austra
lia’s capital to Canberra to negate
the dispute between two cities for
metropolitan privileges, in the
one case Sydney and Melbourne
and in the other Rio de Janiero
and Sao Paulo.
Brasilia’s primary stimulus,
however, is deeply rooted in
Brazilian history. As early as 1789
the first independence movements
championed the idea: a capital
founded by Brasilians and not
Portuguese.
THEN IN the early 19th cen
tury the necessity of an inland
capital graduated from a revolu
tionary dream to a republican
opinion and was included in the
early constitutions. It was sanc
tioned by law and appeared on
maps in various locations but
first reached the construction
stage under President Kubits
check in 1955.
He presented the governmental
sentiments toward Brasilia in the
following statement inscribed on
the golden wall in the Palace of
the Dawn: “From this central
plateau, from this solitude which
will soon be transformed into the
brain of all high national de
cisions, I cast once more my
glance on the morrow of my coun
try and see the dawn with un
breakable faith and unlimited

confidence in its destiny.”
Faith in the Sertao, Brasil’s im
mense undeveloped interior, was
the key to Kubitscheck's energet
ic efforts. Ninety-three per cent
of the population lives in thirty
six per cent of the territorial sur
face. and the chief developmental
problems lie in these practically
uninhabited hinterlands which
were easily forgotten or neglect
ed, as long as the legislative ses
sions were held in the sanctuary
of Rio.
TDK FUTURE beckons in Bra
zil’s move to the West, but it has
not been easy to “force” the gov
ernment officials to give up the
relative comfort and charm of
Rio and take up permanent resi
dence in Brasilia. Many still fly
home at the close of the daily ses
sions, and the “full session” has
been the exception rather than the
rule.
On the other hand many initial
difficulties have been erased by
zeal in other spheres. Road and
railway connections deemed im
possible are almost completed
linking the new capital with all
important points from Belem to
Sao Paulo and from Cuiaba to
Recife. This eases the transporta
tion problems, which left Brasilia
a child and victim of the air-age
in the beginning. Moreover most
of t he foreign embassies are now
under construction in the new
capital.

Brasilia forms a federal district,
but was not born as Washington,
D.C., out of a desire for isolation,
freeing it from the influences of
political passions. A better paral
lel in the founding of new capi
tals was the removal of Austra
lia’s capital to Canberra to negate
the dispute between two cities for
metropolitan privileges, in the
one case Sydney and Melbourne
and in the other Rio de Janiero
and Sao Paulo.
Brasilia’s primary stimulus,
however, is deeply rooted in
Brazilian history. As early as 1789
the first independence movements
championed the idea: a capital
founded by Brasilians and not
Portuguese.
THEN IN the early 19th cen
tury the necessity of an inland
capital graduated from a revolu
tionary dream to a republican
opinion and was included in the
early constitutions. It was sanc
tioned by law and appeared on
maps in various locations but
first reached the construction
stage under President Kubits
check in 1955.
He presented the governmental
sentiments toward Brasilia in the
following statement inscribed on
the golden wall in the Palace of
the Dawn: “From this central
plateau, from this solitude which
will soon be transformed into the
brain of all high national de
cisions, I cast once more my
glance on the morrow of my coun
try and see the dawn with un
breakable faith and unlimited

confidence in its destiny.”
Faith in the Sertao, Brasil’s im
mense undeveloped interior, was
the key to Kubitscheck's energet
ic efforts. Ninety-three per cent
of the population lives in thirty
six per cent of the territorial sur
face. and the chief developmental
problems lie in these practically
uninhabited hinterlands which
were easily forgotten or neglect
ed, as long as the legislative ses
sions were held in the sanctuary
of Rio.
