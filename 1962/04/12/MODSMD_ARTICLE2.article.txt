# Work Started On Second Fraternity Cluster Monday
## 
### 
Work started Monday on a second cluster of four new frater
nity houses.
Contractor is the F. P. Lathrop Construction Co. of Berkeley,
whose $1,289,000 offer was the lowest of six furnished by Bay
Area construction firms. The Lathrop contract brought to a total

of nearly $7,300,000 the amounts
of construction launched in the
last four days by the University.
The second group of fraterni
ties—Kappa Alpha, Zeta Psi, Al
pha Delta Phi and Alpha Kappa
Lambda is located near the orig
inal cluster now nearing comple
tion between the Music Depart
ment building on The Knoll and
Mayfield Avenue.

FRATERNITIES IN the first
new group are Phi Delta Theta,
Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Ep
silon and Theta Delta Chi. These
will bo ready for occupancy by
late September. Occupancy of the
second fraternity cluster is an
ticipated by March 1963.
Plans for a new Stanford pat
tern in undergraduate men’s
housing were laid in 19157, design
ed to integrate more closely the
social and residential with the
cultural and academic life of the
University.
Construction funds come from
a variety of sources—a fund
drive among the alumni of Stan
ford’s 24 fraternities, other gifts,
and a loan from the Federal
Housing and Homo Finance
Agency, which will be repaid
through rental fees.
ARCHITECT FOR both clus
ters is John Carl Warnecke and
Associates, San Francisco.
The two-story fraternities are
built to residential scale, using
materials to blend with nearby
faculty residences.
Features include study-bedroom
suites for two men, individual
house libraries and study rooms,
and a ‘‘master’s house” adjoining
each group of four. These will be
occupied by a senior faculty
member and his family.
While each house will harmo
nize with its neighbors, individu
ality will be expressed in differ
ing elevations, floor plans, and
decoration.
Each house will have its own
dining room and kitchen. There
will be social areas, largo out
door patios, and recreation areas.
