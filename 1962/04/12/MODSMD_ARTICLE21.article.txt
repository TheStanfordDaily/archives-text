Arch’s frosh record with a heave
of 54-3.
The Stanford frosh track team will be out to get back on the
winning path this afternoon, when it hosts City College of San
Francisco and Modesto junior College. The meet will be held on
Angell Field, with the first event starting at 4 p.m.
The frosh were upended for the first time this year in a dual

►and triangular meet competition
by Foothill College last week.
COACH JIM Terrill has a dif
ferent strategy planned than he
used last week, when all distance
limners were doubling in either
880, mile and two-mile. Harlan
Andrews even ran all three
events.
Today, Andrews will stick
completely to the mile, where he
is the Stanford frosh record hold
er.
Weym Kirkland will run ex
clusively the two-mile, backed up
by Dave Stinehack and Cliff
Treese. Andrews will have team
mates Dave Reese and Paul
Schlicke with him in the mile.
John Beck, with a best of 1:56
in the 880, will team up with Jim
Johnson, 1:58.6, for a strong 1-2
punch in that event.
JIM HUTCHINSON and Russ
Peterson, both with bests of 51.3,
are strong in the 440.
Sprinter Larry Questad will
confine his efforts to the 100 and
220, despite winning the low hur
dles last week. Questad will also
high jump.
Stanford will be well repre
sented in the hurdles however, as
Phil Arnaudo has run the high
hurdles in 15 flat, and the lows in
24.5.
Stanford will be hurt by the
loss of co-captain Bob Maclntyre
with a hamstring muscle pull, but
otherwise are strong in the run
ning events.
A feature of the meet will he
the shotputting of Jack Chappie,
who has already broken Steve
Arch’s frosh record with a heave
of 54-3.
