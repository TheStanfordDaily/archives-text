# Library Installs Inspection System
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
“All books and briefcases shall
be shown to the desk attendant
upon leaving the stack area (or
Reserve Book Room). Request of
the Faculty Committee on the Li
brary.”

As a result of the March 16
meeting of the Faculty Commit
tee on the Library, the above no
tice has been posted throughout
the main library. Beginning ap
proximately fall quarter, an in
spection desk will be placed out
side the stack area, while inspec
tion procedure in the RBR is cur
rently fully underway.
“WE ARK -JUST enforcing the
things wo are trying to do al
ready,” explained Acting Director
of Libraries Elmer Grieder yes
terday. “The faculty said tighten
up inspection, but gave no recom
mendations as to mechanics.”

According to D. C. Weber, As
sistant Director of the libraries

the problem is one of "maximum
availability" of books through
“maximum security” as opposed
to "maximum accessibility” of
the books.
According to a memorandum
circulated to the staff by Weber
in reporting the Committee meet
ing, "It was felt that the honor
code had no relevance to the
problem of inspecting books as
persons leave the building.”
The subject came up at an ear
lier Library Committee meeting
upon the complaint of a faculty
member that, due to the imper
fect inspection system, needed
books can’t be located. In rela
tion to this, a report "The Extent
of Book Losses in the Main Li
brary” was distributed at the
March 16 meeting.
NOTED THE report, the last
Stack inventory (1958) showed
7,212 books were missing, 841.
serial articles had missing items,
and 1,327 document titles had
missing items, out of a total
count of 542,217 books.

The library administrators
noted that the inspection system
is “not a sign of distrust of Stan
ford students. We are suffering
now from problems urban univer
sities have been facing for thirty
years, for instance the Strucinski
theft last year.”
The “battery of turnstiles” at
the Cal libraries was noted as in
dicative of the situation in most
university libraries. The Stanford
stacks themselves were not open
ed to all undergraduates until
1953.

THE MEMBERS of the Faculty
Library Committee which made
the recommendation are G. Sen
sebaugh, (English); A. Bowkor
(Doan, Graduate Division); P.
Ehrlich (Biology): E. Farmer
(Art); J. Godier (Engineering);
J, Horriot (Mathematics); K.
Mueller-Vollmer (German); B.
Otis (Classics); O. Pease (His
tory); L. Ratner (Music); R.
Sears (Dean, Humanities and Sci
ences); L. Seltzer (Press); and
R. Swank (library).
