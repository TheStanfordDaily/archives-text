# New Legislature to Be , Better
## 
### JOHN STEINBRUNER 
The proposed new student constitution
has been approved by LASSU and is ready
for the student referendum. In the interests
of intelligent voting, I would like to present
some of the considerations behind the
changes made in the Legislative article of
this new constitution.
The most radical change is the basis of
representation and the method of election.
Each living group on the campus will have
its own representative, with the ideal ratio
of one to every seventy-five students.
THE SAME RATIO will hold for off
campus at large representatives, and gradu
ate representatives by academic division.
This will yield about 120 members of LASSU,
including about 50 graduates, each with one
vote.
The reasons for this proposal involve the
underlying reasons for rewriting the consti
tution. If there is any one thing which is es
sential to the operation of this new consti
tution, it is a student body which is deter
mined to act on the problems facing students
at Stanford, problems student government
has heretofore left solely to the attention of
the administration.
It is the intention of the new constitution
for students to cooperate to some degree in
the formation of University policy. We can
not participate directly in the process at this

point, but must rely on student government
to consolidate views and to state student
opinion forcibly and effectively. Thus, two
things are necessary: 1) students must for
mulate their problems and be aware of pos
sible solutions; 2) students must participate
directly in some association which will give
student opinion the force of unity.
THE NEW STUDENT government should
be an important part of the operation of
student government along these lines. If it
is to reflect student opinion and to take of
ficial student positions on University matters,
then the representatives must reflect the
opinions of their constituents, and those con
stituents must bo enough aware of the oper
ations of the student government to have
opinions. This means that there must be
effective communication between students
and legislature.
It is reasonable that the scheme of repre
sentation should be related to the way in
which the living group governments are con
stituted. Each house in each area is distinct
from the others, with separate interests. It
is only natural that the house should be rep
resented as distinct. Also, the fact that a
representative will know personally 90-100
per cent of his constituents should greatly
increase communication.
FINALLY, the increased si/.e of the legis
lature should help control irrelevant and
repetitious debate, and it enables the legis
lature to be organized in sub-committees,

thus giving specialized attention to specific
issues. By means of increased manpower, the
legislature can give more careful and re
sponsible attention to these issues.
There is also another major change in
that the legislature will not have to approve
every group which wishes to form on the
campus. Student government should protect,
not regulate, the rights of such groups to
form. The legislature will form a sub-com
mittee to advise such groups as to relevant
parts of the constitution and the policies and
regulations of the University which the
group must observe. Legislature will con
tinue to approve any group using the name
“Stanford” or claiming to represent the
views of the student body.
THK NEW CONSTITUTION contains two
provisions which the present graduate rep
resentatives see as being particularly bene
ficial to graduate interests, one providing
for proxy voting and another enabling legis
lature to appropriate funds for special gradu
ate interests.
Proxy voting is seen as a necessary device
for graduate representatives who have con
flicting time commitments when issues of
particular interest arise. The entire purpose
of the new constitution coincides with gradu
ate needs since it enables them to deal in a
positive fashion with the specific issues
which are so hotly debated now in the gradu
ate school and it gives them the possibility
of student body support for their views.

opinions. This means that there must be
effective communication between students
and legislature.
It is reasonable that the scheme of repre
sentation should be related to the way in
which the living group governments are con
stituted. Each house in each area is distinct
from the others, with separate interests. It
is only natural that the house should be rep
resented as distinct. Also, the fact that a
representative will know personally 90-100
per cent of his constituents should greatly
increase communication.
FINALLY, the increased si/.e of the legis
lature should help control irrelevant and
repetitious debate, and it enables the legis
lature to be organized in sub-committees,

thus giving specialized attention to specific
issues. By means of increased manpower, the
legislature can give more careful and re
sponsible attention to these issues.
There is also another major change in
that the legislature will not have to approve
every group which wishes to form on the
campus. Student government should protect,
not regulate, the rights of such groups to
form. The legislature will form a sub-com
mittee to advise such groups as to relevant
parts of the constitution and the policies and
regulations of the University which the
group must observe. Legislature will con
tinue to approve any group using the name
“Stanford” or claiming to represent the
views of the student body.
THK NEW CONSTITUTION contains two
provisions which the present graduate rep
resentatives see as being particularly bene
ficial to graduate interests, one providing
for proxy voting and another enabling legis
lature to appropriate funds for special gradu
ate interests.
Proxy voting is seen as a necessary device
for graduate representatives who have con
flicting time commitments when issues of
particular interest arise. The entire purpose
of the new constitution coincides with gradu
ate needs since it enables them to deal in a
positive fashion with the specific issues
which are so hotly debated now in the gradu
ate school and it gives them the possibility
of student body support for their views.
The proposed new student constitution
has been approved by LASSU and is ready
for the student referendum. In the interests
of intelligent voting, I would like to present
some of the considerations behind the
changes made in the Legislative article of
this new constitution.
The most radical change is the basis of
representation and the method of election.
Each living group on the campus will have
its own representative, with the ideal ratio
of one to every seventy-five students.
THE SAME RATIO will hold for off
campus at large representatives, and gradu
ate representatives by academic division.
This will yield about 120 members of LASSU,
including about 50 graduates, each with one
vote.
The reasons for this proposal involve the
underlying reasons for rewriting the consti
tution. If there is any one thing which is es
sential to the operation of this new consti
tution, it is a student body which is deter
mined to act on the problems facing students
at Stanford, problems student government
has heretofore left solely to the attention of
the administration.
It is the intention of the new constitution
for students to cooperate to some degree in
the formation of University policy. We can
not participate directly in the process at this

point, but must rely on student government
to consolidate views and to state student
opinion forcibly and effectively. Thus, two
things are necessary: 1) students must for
mulate their problems and be aware of pos
sible solutions; 2) students must participate
directly in some association which will give
student opinion the force of unity.
THE NEW STUDENT government should
be an important part of the operation of
student government along these lines. If it
is to reflect student opinion and to take of
ficial student positions on University matters,
then the representatives must reflect the
opinions of their constituents, and those con
stituents must bo enough aware of the oper
ations of the student government to have
opinions. This means that there must be
effective communication between students
and legislature.
