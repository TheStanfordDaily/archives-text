# KZSU to Broadcast Con Home Marathon
## 
### JOYCE E. FIELDING 
“Fantastic 60” will be KZSU’s contribution to the approaching
Con Home Week activities. For those of you who like to listen
to sixty hours of music and chat, or for those who study to the
wee hours of the night and like a radio for company, KZSU (880
on your radio dial) will be broadcasting for sixty straight hours

•for the benefit of Con Home. This
sixty-hour marathon (if every
thing holds together) will begin
on Friday at noon and will con
tinue until Sunday at midnight.
KZSU will also be broadcasting
from such well-populated places
as Lake Lag, in front of the
Union, the AKL house and Lagu
nita Court, in front of Mem Aud,
Memorial Church, ar d even from
Hoover Tower. KZSU does not
feel it is quite fair to broadcast
from these places, however, and
not let the students participate,
so the announcer’s will be inter
viewing students at these various
places around campus.
EVERYONE is invited to stop
by and say what comes to mind
. . . provided it’s up to FCC stan
dards. that is. You may exchange
remarks with Hal Williams at the
(op of Hoover Tower (if you hap
pen to be on top of Hoover Tower
for any reason), or you may ex
press your thoughts on the world
situation to Ken Byram and Carol
Howard while you soak up the
sun at Lake Lag. For anyone who
can’t fight his way to the micro
phone during one of KZSU’s ap
pearances on campus, you may
call KZSU at any time of night or
day and hear yourself on the ra
dio.
Sunday Jeff Skov will be on
hand to broadcast for KZSU on
the action at the Hydrofollies
which start at 12:30. On Sunday
morning KZSU will broadcast
the service from Memorial
Church. And whenever the stu
dents run out of things to say or
the announcer gets tired of lis
tening to them, KZSU will play
all sorts of assorted music: every
thing from Beethoven to the
twist.
For those of you who feel so
inclined, (and KZSU feels sure
that no Stanford student would
want to miss a chance to do his
part), KZSU will furnish a con
tainer for contributions to the
Con Home.
