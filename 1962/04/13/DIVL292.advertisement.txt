No Quorum Shows
For LASSU Meet
LASSU tried to meet last
night, but only half the rep
resentatives showed up. Half
is not a quorum. So . . .
there was a “strategy meet
ing.” not a LASSU session.
The referendum will he
held on Tuesday, not Mon
day, as The Daily reported,
and a few technical changes
were announced in the con
stitution. These will appear
in the full text in Monday's
Daily.
