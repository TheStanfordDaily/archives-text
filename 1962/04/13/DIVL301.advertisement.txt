SUM PAIS
AT YOUR CHEVROLET DEALERS
(where you*ll find the
nicest ways to get away!)
You won’t find a vacation
brightening variety like this any
where else. And now that spring
has sprung, the buys are just as
tempting as the weather. Your
choice of 11 new-size Chevy II
models. Fourteen spacious,
spirited Jet-smooth Chevrolets.
And a nifty, nimble crew of
rear-engine Corvairs. Three
complete lines of cars—and we
mean complete—to cover just
about any kind of going you
could have in mind. And all
under one roof, too! You just
won’t find better pickings in size,
sizzle and savings anywhere
under the sun. And you couldn’t
pick a better time than now—
during your Chev
rolet dealer’s Fun
and Sun Days.
NEW BEL AIR 4-DOOR STATION WAGON
Jet-smoothie that rides just right, loaded or light—
with 97.5-cu.-ft. cargo cave and Full Coil suspension.
CORVAIR MONZA 4-DOOR SEDAN
From snappy interiors to sure-footed seat, this one’s
got the gift of making sport of most any trip.

NEW CHEVY H NOVA STATION WAGON
Here’s a wagon that sells at a compact
price, yet totes in a big way with a longer
load floor than any compact—over 9 ft.
with second seat and tailgate down.
