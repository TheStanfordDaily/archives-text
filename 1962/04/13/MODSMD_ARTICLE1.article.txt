# 'Dynamic' IIR Pre-Reg Committee Expands Activities

(Editor’s Note: This is the last of a four
part series on foreign students at Stanford.)
How is a foreign student greeted when
he arrives at Stanford? A few years ago a
small group of nonchalant Stanford students
would have met him a few days before
school started, ushered him to a few activities,
speeches and tours and left him to find his
way.
But interest in foreign students is grow
ing and with it a dynamic group of students
have found the HR Pre-Registration Commit
tee their place to contribute to Stanford.
Under the direction of Vic Affolter, 17
students participated in (he Pre-Registration
Program last fall, greeting foreign students
on the Wednesday of Pre-reg. Coffee hours,
a picnic and lunches were part of the activi
ties. They planned an open-house at the I-
Center to which freshmen were invited. They

found a heartening interest in foreign stu
dents when over 1,000 freshmen poured into
the I-Center, spiling out ont tothe street. To
wind up the activities, the Committee pre
sented an “American Evening Abroad” as a
kick off to the evening abroad programs
which foreign students present on Saturday
evenings during the academic year.
But the Committee had many problems.
All of the activities described, which included
several meals, were carried out on a budget
of $l5O. As Fred Nelson, financial manager
for the HR put it, “Watercress was a big
item in our meal planning.” The $l5O budget
becomes more meaningful when compared
to the $3,077 provided for the Freshman Pre-
Reg Committee, which needed to supply no
meals with the money.
NEXT YEAR the Committee under the
direction of Pat Falk, hopes to get more
money to expand its activities. Applications
for this Committee are available today in the

ASSU office. A problem the Committee faces
is getting enough graduates in on the pro
gram. Eighty-four per cent of the foreign
students at Stanford this year are graduates.
These students would often prefer to meet
students near their own age.
One of the biggest problems facing the
Pre-Reg Committee has been how to keep
up contact between American and foreign
students. When the foreign student first ar
rives in Palo Alto, he is taken into an Ameri
can home for 10 days. The Community Com
mittee, composed of over 200 residents of the
Palo Alto area, arranges a variety of activi
ties for them including trips to San Fran
cisco, barbecues and tours of local industries.
Five days before school starts, the HR Pre-
Reg Committee takes over, helping to ac
quaint the students with Stanford. The for
eign student is greeted with open arms. Then
Sunday comes and suddenly the warm
friends float away, and many foreign stu-

dents are left alone without American con
tacts.

HANK BARTIZAE OF the HR Host Com
mittee has faced this problem. She noted that
one obstacle to contact between American
and foreign students was that Americans
dropping by the I-Center some times found
it difficult to meet foreign students. She or
ganized a group of hostesses, scheduling
their hours so that someone, and usually two
hostesses would be at the I-Center every
evening to help Americans get acquainted
with foreign students. Gail and Yates Hafner
have also helped by acting as hosts at the
Center.

The I-Club has organized a large number
of activities for both American and foreign
students. There are waiting lists for the
luncheon seminars which meet weekly to
discuss everything from foreign policy to
American dating customs.
BUT MORE efforts are needed. Next year

the old Union building which now houses the
ASSU offices will probably become the I-
Center. The ladies of the Community Com
mittee will set to work making it livable.
But its effectiveness depends on the stu
dents—whether they make it habit to drop
by. More informal contact between American
and foreign students is needed. Hopefully
the new HR dormitory eating program will
help. The Special Foreign Student Scholar
ship Committee should help in the improve
ment of our program. When new housing is
built for graduate students another obstacle
will be passed.
People are swinging into action. As Vic
Affolter remarked, "A new spirit seems to
be generating on this campus. Students are
finally realizing what an asset it is to have
foreign students here.” Slowly the campus
is becoming aware of its large foreign stu
dent population. It needs to—there is much
to be done.
