# ASSU RACE
## Two Nominees For President; Posts Lacking 
### 
Steve Corker and Bill Johnson
are first nominees for ASSU
president, but other nominations
are slow in coming forth, said
Elections Com Chairman Melinda
Gartzman yesterday.
Part of the lag, she thinks, is
the confusion over the status of
some offices in the event of the
passage of the proposed new
ASSU constitution next Tuesday.

If the new constitution passes,
there will be no elections this
spring for either Men’s or Wom
en’s councils or for any LASSU
reps. However, Melinda said, in
real possibility that the constitu
tion fails, candidates will be
needed for three spots on both
Men’s and Women’s Councils and
for the following LASSU seats:
Men’s Row (2), Stern (2), off
campus (2), sophomore class
(2 • and one each from Lag, Toy
on, Flo Mo, Union and Women’s
Row.

Melinda urged students to file
for these offices in the event of
the constitution’s failure so there
will be an orderly way of carry
ing on the ASSU government.
