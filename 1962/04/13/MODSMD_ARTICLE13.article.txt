# New Executive Role Proposed
## 
### BOB SAYLER ASSU President 
The shortcomings of the Execu
tive Article of the 1932 ASSU
Constitution consistently have
been a target for many sorts of
marksmen. So much so, in fact,
that the executive section merited
the initial consideration of the
Committee on Student Goals.
During the past five months
the five changes discussed below,
among others, have received our
conscientious study. With the ex
ception of one substitute Legis
lature member, both the Legisla
ture and the Committee have
unanimously endorsed the re-de
fined role of the executive in stu
dent government.
• THE PRESIDENT of the As
sociated Students will bo relieved
of his duties as “President of the
Legislature.” As we have indi
cated. our profound hope is that
the students can begin to partici
pate actively in the University
community and the University de
cision-making process. To accom
plish this, the Legislature must
effectively communicate with the
students and the executive must
communicate these views to the
administration and faculty.
The executive cannot perform
his expanded function if he must
simultaneously shoulder the re
sponsibility of an expanded Legis
lature. The legislative duties of
the President currently occupy
well over one-third of his time;
chairing the proposed Legislature
with substantial increases in num
bers as well as issues, will be, as

wo see it, a full-time task.
A chairman elected by Legisla
ture from their membership is
necessary if the President is to bo
permitted to execute policy and
to guarantee the direction of a
student government which is pre
paring abruptly to change its
course. In short, standing square
ly between the student body and
an adequate representation of
their views, is an executive with
too little time to act effectively.
• THE ARGUMENTS support
ing an executive veto are cut
from the same bolt of cloth as
those which have called for exec
utive in separation from the
Legislature. The executive is the
liaison between the Legislature
on the one hand and the adminis
tration. faculty, student judiciary,
and all other official agencies of
the ASSU on the other.
While it is likely that a presi
dential veto will be used sparing
ly, it is fair to assert that the in
dividual members of the Legisla
ture coidd not reasonably be ex
pected to have acquired the same
unbiased objectivity or thorough
knowledge that the President has
gained. It is our feeling that the
President should be empowered
with a veto on all non-budgetary
items unless two-thirds of the
Legislature elects to override the
presidential negative.
• A provision for the estab
lishment of presidential investiga
tory commissions has been writ
ten into the Constitution. It is
axiomatic, I think, that if the
President intends to broaden the

base of his activities, he must ac
cordingly gain a confident grasp
on the more complicated issues
with which he will be dealing. As
a means to this end the President
has been given the power to es
tablish committees with which to
determine student opinion.
• THE PRESIDENT will be
empowered to appoint a student
judicial co-ordinator, and along
with the president of Men’s Coun
cil and the Judicial Co-ordinator,
appoint the members of Men’s
Council. Both of these duties were
carefully outlined in the article
which discussed the proposed ju
dicial section, which appeared in
The Daily on Wednesday.
• The President’s Cabinet will
be eliminated. Experience has in
dicated that there are few issues
which concurrently involve the
president of Political Union, the
Head Yell Leader, and president
of the sophomore class. As a con
sequence it has become increas
ingly apparent that Cabinet
meetings are a waste of time.
For this reason the Cabinet has
been called only once this year.
Rather than dealing with 15 of
ficers in one meeting, the Presi
dent can more expeditiously work
with only those officers to whom
specific issues apply at specific
times.
We hope that this series of ar
ticles on the proposed changes in
the Constitution has merited seri
ous consideration by the Student
Body. We urge everyone to vote
next Tuesday to make meaning
ful St udent Government a reality.
