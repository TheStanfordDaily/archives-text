# Freedom of Dissent In American Society
## 
### 
“The students of the professions should early come to know
the significance of dissent. They should he exposed to an
intellectual atmosphere where vital differences of opinion are
not merely tolerated hut encouraged, where at least one battle
royal of ideas has captured the attention of the community of
scholars,”
—James B. Conant

Elsewhere on this page is the last part of a series of Stanford’s
relationship with the right-wing portion of its alumni. Of the
large amount of material presented in these articles much could
he said. No explanatory matter was inserted in any of the articles
and the temptation to go hack and analyze portions of what has
.appeared is great.
However, most of the material was easily interpreted hy the
reader for himself. It must he obvious that alumni who ask if
various speakers appearing on campus represent the “Universi
ty's position” on certain topics have a faulty concept of the mean
ing of education. A conservative friend of ours says that these
alumni opinions and their inarticulate expression are indictments
of the generally liberal professors who taught them. We leave all
this to your own contemplations of the vagaries of the American
political scene and some of the lunatics who are to he found in it.
But a greater problem arises and it is not at all connected with
lunatics, hut rather with intelligent and thoughtful men. It is the
problem of freedom in an academic institution and in a society.
Yesterday Stanford economics professor Paul Baran on this
page delivered himself of a challenging indictment of what aca
demic freedom has come to mean at Stanford (and there is no
reason to believe that this university is different in this respect
from most others in this country), Baran, it is obvious, daily pays
the price in many ways for his Marxist views.
When an alumnus wants to know why Stanford doesn’t fire
Baran, the University, in effect, says, “We can’t.” (Baran is un
doubtedly correct when he says that the University’s constant
references to tenure imply he would he fired if he didn’t have it.)
\\ hen Baran issues a challenging statement, the University (with
a worried eye cast toward the inevitable alumni reaction) hur
riedly arranges a speaker to oppose him. When Baran writes a
letter to The Daily, the administration encourages his colleagues,
silent on other occasions, to write letters in opposition. Baran is
a member of no University committee, though he is eminently
qualified for several. His social relations with his contemporaries
are minimal and often antagonistic. Although he is a brilliant,
engaging and friendly personality, student-faculty gatherings with
him are not encouraged hy University organizations.
I his list could he extended, hut the tragedy is not the personal
one of Paul Baran. He realizes, perhaps better than anx’one, the
price that is paid for real, furious dissent in American society.
That his choice has been what it is, is his own greatest tribute.
The tragedy is our own. Few people can he expected willfully to
alienate themselves from society and the personally satisfying
material things of life. As long as this kind of requirement is
placed upon those w ho dissent we can expect our critics to he few
in number and ineffective. The had results of this are obvious,
A society should cherish its critics. As long as it is afraid and
ashamed of them it is not mature. The same must he said of a
university which is afraid and ashamed.

However, most of the material was easily interpreted hy the
reader for himself. It must he obvious that alumni who ask if
various speakers appearing on campus represent the “Universi
ty's position” on certain topics have a faulty concept of the mean
ing of education. A conservative friend of ours says that these
alumni opinions and their inarticulate expression are indictments
of the generally liberal professors who taught them. We leave all
this to your own contemplations of the vagaries of the American
political scene and some of the lunatics who are to he found in it.
But a greater problem arises and it is not at all connected with
lunatics, hut rather with intelligent and thoughtful men. It is the
problem of freedom in an academic institution and in a society.
Yesterday Stanford economics professor Paul Baran on this
page delivered himself of a challenging indictment of what aca
demic freedom has come to mean at Stanford (and there is no
reason to believe that this university is different in this respect
from most others in this country), Baran, it is obvious, daily pays
the price in many ways for his Marxist views.
When an alumnus wants to know why Stanford doesn’t fire
Baran, the University, in effect, says, “We can’t.” (Baran is un
doubtedly correct when he says that the University’s constant
references to tenure imply he would he fired if he didn’t have it.)
\\ hen Baran issues a challenging statement, the University (with
a worried eye cast toward the inevitable alumni reaction) hur
riedly arranges a speaker to oppose him. When Baran writes a
letter to The Daily, the administration encourages his colleagues,
silent on other occasions, to write letters in opposition. Baran is
a member of no University committee, though he is eminently
qualified for several. His social relations with his contemporaries
are minimal and often antagonistic. Although he is a brilliant,
engaging and friendly personality, student-faculty gatherings with
him are not encouraged hy University organizations.
I his list could he extended, hut the tragedy is not the personal
one of Paul Baran. He realizes, perhaps better than anx’one, the
price that is paid for real, furious dissent in American society.
That his choice has been what it is, is his own greatest tribute.
The tragedy is our own. Few people can he expected willfully to
alienate themselves from society and the personally satisfying
material things of life. As long as this kind of requirement is
placed upon those w ho dissent we can expect our critics to he few
in number and ineffective. The had results of this are obvious,
A society should cherish its critics. As long as it is afraid and
ashamed of them it is not mature. The same must he said of a
university which is afraid and ashamed.
“The students of the professions should early come to know
the significance of dissent. They should he exposed to an
intellectual atmosphere where vital differences of opinion are
not merely tolerated hut encouraged, where at least one battle
royal of ideas has captured the attention of the community of
scholars,”
