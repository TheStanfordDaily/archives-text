# Sobell Tries for Parole
## 
### NILS WESSELL Associate Editor 
Morton Sobell, convicted with |
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1
1951 for espionage, will be eligible
for parole from jail in Atlanta on j
July 27.
Anticipating his request for j
parole, Mrs. Sobell has been try
ing to enlist prominent individuals j
throughout the world to aid in |
freeing her husband.
PROfLAMING their innocence,
the Rosenbergs were electrocuted |
for passing secrets of the atomic !
bomb to the Russians while Sobell
w’as sentenced to 30 years with a j
recommendation from J u d g e j
Kaufman against parole.
Since federal law allows Sobell ;
to be eligible for parole after serv- j
ing one third of his sentence, he |
will apply for parole in July.
Although Mrs. Sobell is now j
working chiefly to gain parole for j
her husband, she intends to seek
his legal vindication too. As for
the Rosenbergs, Mrs. Sobell be
lieves that “history will vindicate
them.”
“WE ARE fighting the legal
battle because vindication is im
portant to us,” Mrs. Sobell told
the Daily, “but we have to face
the fact that executive clemency
may be the only way." Accord
ingly, a clemency petition to Pres- j
ident Kennedy is pending.
Sobell’s conviction during the
McCarthy era of popular concern
over Communist infiltration pro
ceeded from the uncorroborated
testimony of Max Elitcher.
Elitcher told the court that So
bcll had recruited him into the
Communist party in 1939 and that
Julius Rosenberg had frequently
mentioned Sobell’s name in con- j
nection with espionage. He also
said that Sobell had one day de

livered what looked like a 35mm
film can to Julius .Rosenberg.

After the jury interpreted Elit
i cher’s testimony to be honest,
accurate, and incriminating, Judge
Kaufman gave Sobell a sentence
.that his defenders call extrava
i gant. Even now Sobell’s parole is
j uncertain since only 14 per cent
of federal prisoners applying re
i ceive parole.
Some of Mrs. Sobell’s efforts
to enlist support have been suc
cessful. The Queen of Belgium
j has written a letter to President
I Kennedy asking that Sobell be
| granted clemency, and 30 MP's in
j the House of Commons have also
urged the President to grant clem-
| ency.
LORD Bertrand Russell and Dr.
I Martin Buber have said they are
j “convinced of the innocence of
I Morton Sobell.” Rev. Martin
; Luther King appealed to Attorney
General Robert Kennedy saying
that his 30 year sentence consti
tuted a “cruel and unusual pun
ishment.”
Reinhold Niebuhr of the Union
Theological Seminary is part of a
special panel of law professors
and educators who reached the
following conclusions:
• Sobell was never implicated
with atomic espionage for which
j the Rosenbergs were convicted.
• THE CASE against Sobel is
“vague in content and slender in
j proof.”
• We ought to recognize that
the emotions surrounding the
j trial of the Rosenbergs and the
j fact that Sobell’s case was tried
with theirs made it difficult to
separate the two cases and to rec
ognize the very difficult character
j of the two charges and the evi
dence Introduced to support them
respectively.

her husband, she intends to seek
his legal vindication too. As for
the Rosenbergs, Mrs. Sobell be
lieves that “history will vindicate
them.”
“WE ARE fighting the legal
battle because vindication is im
portant to us,” Mrs. Sobell told
the Daily, “but we have to face
the fact that executive clemency
may be the only way." Accord
ingly, a clemency petition to Pres- j
ident Kennedy is pending.
Sobell’s conviction during the
McCarthy era of popular concern
over Communist infiltration pro
ceeded from the uncorroborated
testimony of Max Elitcher.
Elitcher told the court that So
bcll had recruited him into the
Communist party in 1939 and that
Julius Rosenberg had frequently
mentioned Sobell’s name in con- j
nection with espionage. He also
said that Sobell had one day de

livered what looked like a 35mm
film can to Julius .Rosenberg.

After the jury interpreted Elit
i cher’s testimony to be honest,
accurate, and incriminating, Judge
Kaufman gave Sobell a sentence
.that his defenders call extrava
i gant. Even now Sobell’s parole is
j uncertain since only 14 per cent
of federal prisoners applying re
i ceive parole.
Some of Mrs. Sobell’s efforts
to enlist support have been suc
cessful. The Queen of Belgium
j has written a letter to President
I Kennedy asking that Sobell be
| granted clemency, and 30 MP's in
j the House of Commons have also
urged the President to grant clem-
| ency.

ishment.”
Reinhold Niebuhr of the Union
Theological Seminary is part of a
special panel of law professors
and educators who reached the
following conclusions:
• Sobell was never implicated
with atomic espionage for which
j the Rosenbergs were convicted.
• THE CASE against Sobel is
“vague in content and slender in
j proof.”
• We ought to recognize that
the emotions surrounding the
j trial of the Rosenbergs and the
j fact that Sobell’s case was tried
with theirs made it difficult to
separate the two cases and to rec
ognize the very difficult character
j of the two charges and the evi

respectively.

the Rosenbergs were electrocuted |
for passing secrets of the atomic !
bomb to the Russians while Sobell
w’as sentenced to 30 years with a j

to be eligible for parole after serv- j
