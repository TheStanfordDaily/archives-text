# STANFORD AND THE RIGHT-WING
## The 						Dept, that Answers the Alums

(Editor’s note: This is the last of

Stanford maintains a well
staffed and well-budgeted public
relations department. Between 10
and 15 per cent of its time is spent
answering letters from alumni
who are worried or irate about
Communist, Marxist, Socialist,
Welfare State or Left Wing influ
ences at the University.
“What worries you is spending
so much time on this stuff,” says
Lyle Nelson, Director of Univer
sity Relations. “I’ve got so many
positive things to do. We try to
pass the letter-writing around. If
one of us tried to do if all, he’d
go crazy. You have to feel you're
doing something constructive.”
NELSON SAYS that the best
method to combat extremist opin
ion about the University is to get
as much positive information
about the campus known as pos
sible.
“Alumni conferences are great
for that kind of thing. Having
professors and students going
around talking about the Univer
sity is better than putting out
fires all the time.
“The directors of the alumni
association are brought here three
times a year. They get a feeling
of excitement on the campus and
spread it around when they get
home.”
ROBERT PIERCE, director of
the Stanford Alumni Association,
also stresses the importance of
alumni conferences.
“Usually when we go to a place
where there has been a lot of
noise, we find it’s only from a
handful of people. The rest are
very friendly. I think we're all
kind of afraid of what’s happen
ing,” says Pierce, “The Univer
sity is overly sensitive to this kind
of pressure. We’re 100 anxious to
worry about the worst.”
Pierce also says that the alumni
know that Stanford President
Wallace Sterling is (he vulnerable
person and they want an answer
from him. As a result, Pierce
says, the alumni office gets vir
tually no correspondence from
alumni along this line.
Robert Miller. Associate Direc
tor of University Relations, says
that most of the letters from
alumni are responsible and de
serve an answer.
“THE FLOW increases and de
creases with political activity on
campus,” Miller says. “They have
to have something to hang their
hats on, such as the Cubberley
• education) Conference or Ba
ran's speech on Cuba.”
Miller says the quantity of let
ters has decreased lately which
he takes to mean that the Univer
sity has been moderately effective
in disseminating correct informa
tion.
I’m certain alumni conferences
help,” Miller said.
NELSON .SAYS that another
kind of effective rebuttal to letter
writers is the “Report from Cam
pus” which is printed monthly.
This lists every extra-curricular
event held on campus and is en
closed in answers to alumni from
the University to show the leftist
i

viewpoint is not the only one pre- (
sented.
Photostats of newspaper arti- ;
cles showing non-political activity I
on campus, such as Nobel Prize
winners, are also often enclosed
in letters to alumni.
Nelson says he finds that an-'
swering all the letters positively I
pays benefits in terms of contri
butions as well as University rela
tions.
“YOU’D LOSE more money in :
the long run by giving in,” he I
says. "It’s better to take a forth- I
right, stand.” Miller agrees with I
this.
Nelson says that the pressure j
from alumni often takes strange
forms. One letter-writer enclosed 1
a donation and then recommended
that the “Administration demon
strate some courage and rid our
faculty of socialistically inclined
professors. Also the editor of the
Stanford Daily is still a disgrace •
to the University.”
“Someone once wrote that the
Daily is like the Daily Worker,” j
Nelson said laughing. “I com
posed a letter saying I wouldn’t
know because I don’t read the
Daily Worker and you’d better i
watch those Commie papers!
you’re reading. I didn’t send that
one though.”
PIERCE AND Miller say that
there are definite patterns to the |
letters the University receives.
"Strangely enough,” Pierce I
says, “The most vocal people are
those who are the most anxious
to get their kids into Stanford. I
never could figure it out.
“And you can always identify I
someone from the John Birch
Society. They always use the
terms “Constitutional Republic"!
and Fabian Socialism.” Sometimes
they get mixed up. I once heard !

someone say ‘Freudian Socialism’
and ‘Diabolical Materialism.’ ”
Miller says that much of the
abuse that Stanford's benefactor,
the Ford Foundation, receives
comes straight out of material
distributed by Veritas Foundation,
Inc., a right-wing group estab
lished by some Harvard alumni.
Veritas claims that the Ford
Foundation is Communist domi
nated.
Nelson says that a sense of
humor is indispensihle when deal
ing with this problem. Some
times, however, he gets discour
aged.
“A FRIEND of mine sent me a
clipping from the New York
Times announcing the proposed
merger of all right-wing groups.
I wrote him back, ‘Often when
grappling with this problem, I
get the urge to pick a lime off
President Sterling's lime tree the
has one next to his office) and to
take it home to put in a gin and
tonic. When I hear news like
yours, I want to pick two limes.’ ”

"Strangely enough,” Pierce I
says, “The most vocal people are
those who are the most anxious

never could figure it out.

someone from the John Birch
Society. They always use the

Miller says that much of the
abuse that Stanford's benefactor,
the Ford Foundation, receives
comes straight out of material
distributed by Veritas Foundation,
Inc., a right-wing group estab
lished by some Harvard alumni.
Veritas claims that the Ford
Foundation is Communist domi
nated.
Nelson says that a sense of

“A FRIEND of mine sent me a

merger of all right-wing groups.
I wrote him back, ‘Often when

take it home to put in a gin and

Stanford maintains a well
staffed and well-budgeted public
relations department. Between 10
and 15 per cent of its time is spent
answering letters from alumni
who are worried or irate about
Communist, Marxist, Socialist,
Welfare State or Left Wing influ
ences at the University.
“What worries you is spending
so much time on this stuff,” says
Lyle Nelson, Director of Univer
sity Relations. “I’ve got so many
positive things to do. We try to
pass the letter-writing around. If
one of us tried to do if all, he’d
go crazy. You have to feel you're
doing something constructive.”
NELSON SAYS that the best
method to combat extremist opin
ion about the University is to get
as much positive information
about the campus known as pos
sible.
“Alumni conferences are great
for that kind of thing. Having
professors and students going
around talking about the Univer
sity is better than putting out
fires all the time.
“The directors of the alumni
association are brought here three
times a year. They get a feeling
of excitement on the campus and
spread it around when they get
home.”
ROBERT PIERCE, director of
the Stanford Alumni Association,
also stresses the importance of
alumni conferences.
“Usually when we go to a place
where there has been a lot of
noise, we find it’s only from a
handful of people. The rest are
very friendly. I think we're all
kind of afraid of what’s happen
ing,” says Pierce, “The Univer
sity is overly sensitive to this kind
of pressure. We’re 100 anxious to
worry about the worst.”
Pierce also says that the alumni
know that Stanford President
Wallace Sterling is (he vulnerable
person and they want an answer
from him. As a result, Pierce
says, the alumni office gets vir
tually no correspondence from
alumni along this line.
Robert Miller. Associate Direc
tor of University Relations, says
that most of the letters from
alumni are responsible and de
serve an answer.
“THE FLOW increases and de
creases with political activity on
campus,” Miller says. “They have
to have something to hang their
hats on, such as the Cubberley
• education) Conference or Ba
ran's speech on Cuba.”
Miller says the quantity of let
ters has decreased lately which
he takes to mean that the Univer
sity has been moderately effective
in disseminating correct informa
tion.
I’m certain alumni conferences
help,” Miller said.
NELSON .SAYS that another
kind of effective rebuttal to letter
writers is the “Report from Cam
pus” which is printed monthly.
This lists every extra-curricular
event held on campus and is en
closed in answers to alumni from
the University to show the leftist
i

viewpoint is not the only one pre- (
sented.
Photostats of newspaper arti- ;
cles showing non-political activity I
on campus, such as Nobel Prize
winners, are also often enclosed
in letters to alumni.
Nelson says he finds that an-'
swering all the letters positively I
pays benefits in terms of contri
butions as well as University rela
tions.
“YOU’D LOSE more money in :
the long run by giving in,” he I
says. "It’s better to take a forth- I
right, stand.” Miller agrees with I
this.
Nelson says that the pressure j
from alumni often takes strange
forms. One letter-writer enclosed 1
a donation and then recommended
that the “Administration demon
strate some courage and rid our
faculty of socialistically inclined
professors. Also the editor of the
Stanford Daily is still a disgrace •
to the University.”
“Someone once wrote that the
Daily is like the Daily Worker,” j
Nelson said laughing. “I com
posed a letter saying I wouldn’t
know because I don’t read the
Daily Worker and you’d better i
watch those Commie papers!
you’re reading. I didn’t send that
one though.”

Miller says that much of the
abuse that Stanford's benefactor,

comes straight out of material
distributed by Veritas Foundation,

Veritas claims that the Ford
Foundation is Communist domi

Nelson says that a sense of

“A FRIEND of mine sent me a

I wrote him back, ‘Often when

take it home to put in a gin and
tonic. When I hear news like
yours, I want to pick two limes.’ ”

Stanford maintains a well
staffed and well-budgeted public
relations department. Between 10
and 15 per cent of its time is spent
answering letters from alumni
who are worried or irate about
Communist, Marxist, Socialist,
Welfare State or Left Wing influ
ences at the University.
“What worries you is spending
so much time on this stuff,” says
Lyle Nelson, Director of Univer
sity Relations. “I’ve got so many
positive things to do. We try to
pass the letter-writing around. If
one of us tried to do if all, he’d
go crazy. You have to feel you're
doing something constructive.”
NELSON SAYS that the best
method to combat extremist opin
ion about the University is to get
as much positive information
about the campus known as pos
sible.
“Alumni conferences are great
for that kind of thing. Having
professors and students going
around talking about the Univer
sity is better than putting out
fires all the time.
“The directors of the alumni
association are brought here three
times a year. They get a feeling
of excitement on the campus and
spread it around when they get
home.”
ROBERT PIERCE, director of
the Stanford Alumni Association,
also stresses the importance of
alumni conferences.
“Usually when we go to a place
where there has been a lot of
noise, we find it’s only from a
handful of people. The rest are
very friendly. I think we're all
kind of afraid of what’s happen
ing,” says Pierce, “The Univer
sity is overly sensitive to this kind
of pressure. We’re 100 anxious to
worry about the worst.”
Pierce also says that the alumni
know that Stanford President
Wallace Sterling is (he vulnerable
person and they want an answer
from him. As a result, Pierce
says, the alumni office gets vir
tually no correspondence from
alumni along this line.
Robert Miller. Associate Direc
tor of University Relations, says
that most of the letters from
alumni are responsible and de
serve an answer.
“THE FLOW increases and de
creases with political activity on
campus,” Miller says. “They have
to have something to hang their
hats on, such as the Cubberley
• education) Conference or Ba
ran's speech on Cuba.”
Miller says the quantity of let
ters has decreased lately which
he takes to mean that the Univer
sity has been moderately effective
in disseminating correct informa
tion.
I’m certain alumni conferences
help,” Miller said.
NELSON .SAYS that another
kind of effective rebuttal to letter
writers is the “Report from Cam
pus” which is printed monthly.
