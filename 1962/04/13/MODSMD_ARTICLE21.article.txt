## Lonborg to Hurl In UCLA Opener 
### PETE KING 
It’s getting down to cases for
Stanford’s baseball team, which
has lost five straight in CIBA
play. This weekend they seek to
both better their 0-5 record and
gain fourth place when they take
on UCLA twice in Los Angeles.
STARTING PITCHER for Fri
day’s game will be Jim Lonborg,
whose 1-3 record belles his true
ability. Jim went 11 full innings
against the Bruins in a game here

a week ago, striking out 13 and
giving up just four hits in 10
innings before UCLA’s hitting
and Stanford’s lack of it handed
him a heartbreaking. 3-1 loss.
Saturday’s starting hurler will
be Darrell Sutherland (2-3 i, who
recently allowed Claremont
Men's College only one hit in the
three innings he pitched.
STANFORD’S TWO recent lop
sided victories over St, Mary’s
and Claremont came at just the
light time, according to coach
Dutch Fehring. After losing five
straight league contests, the com
bined, 37-run spree has given sev
eral team members renewed con
fidence in their hitting ability.
Such a boost in team morale
could spell the difference between
victory and defeat in future tight
games.
Although the team has a low
.239 balling average, there are
several standouts. Outfielder Jim
Chenu currently leads all hitters
with a hefty ,353 average, while
third baseman Rich Ferrazzano
leads in “come-through” perform
ances with 13 RBl’s. Encouraging
improvement has been shown
lately by left-fielder O. J. Soland
er, and Fehring feels that the
team as a whole should improve
its hitting soon.
UCLA, WHICH HAS won two
and lost four in the CIBA, recent
ly lost to Cal, 3-2, and was In the
process of losing the second game
before It was called.
