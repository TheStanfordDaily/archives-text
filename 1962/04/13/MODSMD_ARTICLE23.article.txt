It’s “Big Game” time for the |
Stanford netters, as they take on I

and frosh get into the act, as the i
tennis season can be made a suc
cess by beating the Bears from
Berkeley.
Stanford will be led into the
matches by diminutive Yoshi j

squad, and San Jose scored an
upset.
Other top Stanford tennis men j
are George Bates, John Minna, j
and John Isaacs. Isaacs and Mini-1
gishi are the top Card doubles
team.
California will be led by Bill i
Hoogs anti surprise sophomore {
Edgie Scott.
