Great Romances
Week. Our first great
romance is the story
of Cinderella. She
was just sitting
around in her old
clothes, as you know
—when suddenly her
fairy godmother
appeared and told
her ail about Super/
Charge. Nothing down
... 12 months to
pay. Just get there
before midnight.
Don’t be a pumpkin
open your own S/C.
All you need is
your reg.card.
