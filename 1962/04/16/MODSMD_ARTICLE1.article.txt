# Humanism Revival Vital, Says Fromm
## 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
Man must revive humanism or face barbarism brought on by
nuclear war, according to famous author-psychoanalyst Erich
Fromm.
Man has become a prisoner of his creation, nuclear weapons,
Fromm told a near-capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium

Friday afternoon. “The future oH
our Western civilization is not
dependent on economic and mili
tary strength, but on the strength I
of the ideas that make men |
strong,” Fromm said.

He advocated humanism for its
assumption that all men share
the same humanity, making divi
sions of culture, society or race
insignificant in comparison.
Fromm decried rampant na
tionalism, which he said has
taken precedence over humanism
since the French Revolution.
The nation-state, not the com
monwealth of man, has been con
sidered sacred, he complained.
Economic interests and “national
tribalism” are still considered
first today, Fromm declared.
THROUGH industrialization
which shapes man similarly and
modern communications, "there
is no doubt that one world is
coming into being,” Fromm said.
But the world will be livable only
if man becomes a citizen of the
world, Fromm insisted.
Emotionally man is in the Stone
Age, with tribal feelings, fear
and hate of others, Fromm said.
Today’s man is “the missing link
between the apes and man,”
Fromm remarked.
Fromm considers the task of
life “to develop what is specifical
ly human.” Men must realize that
in every human being is humani
ty and that “in every man is all
of man,” he said.
“I CAN’T LOOK down on any
one as a sinner or criminal, be
cause I am the same; it is only a
matter of degree,” Fromm ex
plained. “We are all the same—
with all the good and all the evil
possibilities.”
Man must get in touch with his
unconscious, because that way he
will experience what is within
every man. Fromm said. “Only
then can I love my enemy, be
cause the enemy is in me.”
People have become brutalized
since World War I, so that now
they can road books soberly say
ing that 60 million Americans
dead is acceptable and 80-100 mil
lion is inacceptable, Fromm
charged.
“VVE ARE FAR away from the
command ‘love thine enemy’.” As
individuals or a culture, we are
not the same men we used to bo,
hut most aren’t sensitive enough
to see wo have changed, Fromm
said. “Hatred has diminished our
conscience.”
Fromm said he believes man
must choose humanism over bar
barism because “I have faith that
man is not destined to destroy
himself.”
“I am just flightened that in a
state of panic and stupidity he
might do things which prevent
mankind from ever reaching the
future,” he added.
Unconsciously “most people
have very little belief that there’s
anything good in man,” though
“consciously we say how wonder
ful be are,” Fromm said.

But the world will be livable only
if man becomes a citizen of the
world, Fromm insisted.
Emotionally man is in the Stone
Age, with tribal feelings, fear
and hate of others, Fromm said.
Today’s man is “the missing link
between the apes and man,”
Fromm remarked.
Fromm considers the task of
life “to develop what is specifical
ly human.” Men must realize that
in every human being is humani
ty and that “in every man is all
of man,” he said.
“I CAN’T LOOK down on any
one as a sinner or criminal, be
cause I am the same; it is only a
matter of degree,” Fromm ex
plained. “We are all the same—
with all the good and all the evil
possibilities.”
Man must get in touch with his
unconscious, because that way he
will experience what is within
every man. Fromm said. “Only
then can I love my enemy, be
cause the enemy is in me.”
People have become brutalized
since World War I, so that now
they can road books soberly say
ing that 60 million Americans
dead is acceptable and 80-100 mil
lion is inacceptable, Fromm
charged.
“VVE ARE FAR away from the
command ‘love thine enemy’.” As
individuals or a culture, we are
not the same men we used to bo,
hut most aren’t sensitive enough
to see wo have changed, Fromm
said. “Hatred has diminished our
conscience.”
Fromm said he believes man
must choose humanism over bar
barism because “I have faith that
man is not destined to destroy
himself.”
“I am just flightened that in a
state of panic and stupidity he
might do things which prevent
mankind from ever reaching the
future,” he added.
Unconsciously “most people
have very little belief that there’s
anything good in man,” though
“consciously we say how wonder
ful be are,” Fromm said.
Man must revive humanism or face barbarism brought on by
nuclear war, according to famous author-psychoanalyst Erich
Fromm.
Man has become a prisoner of his creation, nuclear weapons,
Fromm told a near-capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium

Friday afternoon. “The future oH
our Western civilization is not
dependent on economic and mili
tary strength, but on the strength I
of the ideas that make men |
strong,” Fromm said.

He advocated humanism for its
assumption that all men share
the same humanity, making divi
sions of culture, society or race
insignificant in comparison.
Fromm decried rampant na
tionalism, which he said has
taken precedence over humanism
since the French Revolution.
The nation-state, not the com
monwealth of man, has been con
sidered sacred, he complained.
Economic interests and “national
tribalism” are still considered
first today, Fromm declared.
THROUGH industrialization
which shapes man similarly and
modern communications, "there
is no doubt that one world is
coming into being,” Fromm said.
