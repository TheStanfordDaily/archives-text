KEEPING TRACK of the latest arrivals at the newly formed Stanford Authors' Corner of the Bookstore
are llene Strelitz, Linda Verlee and Kathy Norris of the Student-Faculty Board. The Author's Corner
is part of a multi-pronged Stu-fac program initialed by co-chairmen Miss Strelitz and William Loitz
last quarter. Each new non-technical publication by a Stanford faculty member is put on main dis
play as it arrives at the bookstore. It is then reviewed in the Daily by another Stanford faculty mem
ber or outside colleague of the author. When possible, Student-Faculty Board arranges a fireside at
one of the campus residences with the author. The recent books are kept in the Authorsâ€™ corner. This
quarter will feature such works as Leon Festinger's "Deterrents and Reinforcements", Don Feheren
bachers' "Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850's", and Irving Howe's "History of the Commu
nist Party". Misses Verlee and Norris are the newly elected co-chairmen of the Student-Faculty Board,
replacing Miss Strelitz and Loitz.
