# Berlin Strains U.S. W. German Alliance
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Allied
discord threatened yesterday to
undermine new American efforts
to solve the Berlin problem. Of
ficials here said they feared even
wider damage within the Western
alliance.
The crisis in the allied camp
stemmed from a disagreement be
tween the United States and West
Germany over how to deal with
Russia on Berlin. It reached epic
proportions this weekend after
the premature disclosure in Bonn
of the details of a confidential
new American proposal to be sub
mitted to the Soviet Union.
PRESIDENT KENNEDY was
described as "furious.” U.S. of
ficials said the affair went far
beyond the Berlin issue. They as
serted that what they described as
a German “breach of confidence”
struck at the heart of action
within NATO because it under
mined the policy of mutual trust
in consultations among the allies.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
his aides said, still planned to
present the new American pro
posals at a meeting this afternoon
with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly
F. Dobrynin. But its was clear he
felt the West Germans had badly
damaged the allied negotiating
position.
THE U.S. proposal envisages
some increase in status for Com
munist East Genrany and a
NATO non-aggression pledge in
return for renewed Soviet guar
antees of the allied position in
West Berlin and access to it
through Red territory. It calls for
internationalization of the access
routes and proposes an exchange
of Soviet-American pledges
against spreading nuclear weap
ons or know-how to other coun
tries.
The plan does not involve any
retreat from Kennedy’s basic in
sistence that there will be no sur
render to Soviet demands that the
Allies give up their occupation of
beleaguered West Berlin.
WEST GERMAN Chancellor
Konrad Adenauer has advised the
United States he dislikes the
American suggestion that Com
munist East Germany be given a
voice in the proposed internation
al group controlling access, and is
unhappy about another feature of
the plan calling for creation of
East-West German committees to
deal with trade and other matters.
The West German government
denies any “official leak” of the
American plan. But State Depart
ment officials say the fulsome de
tails reported by newsmen in
Bonn could have come only from
two confidential documents sent
to the foreign office there last
Tuesday.
THE ASSUMPTION among
U.S. officials is that members of
Adenauer’s government, dis
pleased with some aspects of the
plan, released it deliberately 1o
sabotage U.S. negotiating efforts.
The State Department Saturday
called in German Ambassador
Wilhelm Grewe to protest the
matter.

The affairs has strengthened
the feeling of those American of
ficials who have contended pri
vately, for some time, that the
United States was encouraging
West German obstruction by pay
ing too much attention to pres
sure from Bonn.
