# ASSU Constitution Deserves Passage
## 
### 
The mtv existence of a new constitution ready for submission
to the student body is a significant sign that a change in thinking
about student government has taken place tins year.
The constitution show s six months of careful work by some of
the most capable student minds in the University. The document
is not flaw less, but it is considerably better than the one now in
use. And the psychological effects of its institution can only add
to the constitution's inherent strength.
The assumption of its framers is that student government can
and should do something worthwhile. It is designed to give stu
dents a greater voice in deciding problems of crucial interest to
students. Its provisions for paralleling existing faculty committees
with student committees which will consider the same issues, and
for the expanded legislature, whose decisions will be more fnllv
representative of the students of the University, should carry a
great deal more weight with the decision-making agencies of the
University.
The present legislature supposedly has three functions: it rep
resents students, it communicates with them, and it makes de
cisions for them. Its decisions are negligible, and at present it can
claim neither to represent nor to communicate.
The new legislature, with members from every house on campus
and a proportionate number of off-campus and graduate repre
sentatives, will institute communication and representation im
mediately. It will represent the character of each bouse, and it
w ill demand that the members of each house listen to the issues
before the legislature. The hope is that interest will be generated
in the fellow sitting in front of the TV eating popcorn, and that
the interest itself w ill then demand that issues of importance be
discussed.
The real work of the body will be done in subcommittees,
which should increase the efficiency of its functioning. With a
strong leader, the body should be easily manageable.
I he biggest weakness of the constitution lies in the proxy vote
provision of the legislature, which could give 40 per cent of the
total vote to three or four members. Its insertion was a purely
political maneuver to put the constitution on the ballot. Although
the proxy is a weakness, it is not a fatal flaw, and it is not suffi
cient reason to reject the entire constitution.
The judicial article seems to be an immeasurable improvement.
Current judicial functioning is hazy at best. The new' constitution
" ill provide a strong and clearly defined structure and a consider
ably more equitable manner of choosing judges.
The constitution has already caused great interest among the
faculty and administration. Recently several framers of the docu
ment were asked to meet with the Presidentâ€™s Committee on Un
dergraduate Education, and their reaction was extremely positive.
It is our hope that the student body will place its confidence
in student government with as much strength. The new constitu
tion deserves to be passed.
