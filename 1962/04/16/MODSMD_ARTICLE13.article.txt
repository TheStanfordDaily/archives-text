# McCORD SAYS
## Mills Was 'Creative' 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
“Stand for the primacy of the
individual scholar.” wrote C.
Wright Mills in his book “The So
ciological Imagination.”
The 46-year-old author and
teacher, who died on March 20 of
a heart attack, followed his own
advice and was perhaps the most
“individual” of contemporary
American sociologists.
Mills was pulled into Ihe nation
al spotlight when his book,
“White Collar” became a best sel
ler. This incisive analysis of the
American middle-class establish
ed Mills as a popular author, and
strikingly illustrated his own par
ticular brand of sociology,
“WHETHER I have written of
labor leaders or farmers, of busi
ness executives of Puerto Rican
migrants, of office workers,
housewives or working men —I
have tried to see them as actors
in the drama of 20th century
U.5.A.,” he wrote.
This view of his discipline was
definitely at odds with the main
stream of American sociology.
Dr. William McCord of Stan
ford’s sociology department is one
of the few sociologists who would
agree with Mills’ attitudes. Ac
cording to McCord, Mills was one
of the three most creative minds
in American sociology of the post
war period.
HE WAS, McCord says, a
‘Prickly Pear’ who never minced
words and made a lot of personal
enemies. As a result, he missed a
lot of the rewards of the social
sciences.”

At Columbia University, where
Mills was teaching, he was doing
work only with undergraduates,
a result, McCord says, of being
intensely disliked by the Colum
bia sociology department.
Mills was extremely active in
international sociology, an area
in which he was accepted. He
helped to establish in Warsaw
the first institute for social re
search in the Communist bloc.
AT THE TIME of his death he
was working on a comprehensive
book concerned with intellectuals
in the contemporary world, for
which he spent a lot of time in
the underdeveloped countries of
Asia.

Mills approach was impression
istic and he believed that every
sociologist should establish his
own methodology.
“Be a good craftsman,” he
wrote. “Avoid any rigid set of
procedures. Above all, seek to de
velop and to use the sociological
imagination.”
MILLS HAD a lot of "Socio
logical Imagination.” His sweep
ing indictment of the “Power
Elite” which he conceived of as
in control in America, and his ver
sion of the Cuban view of United
States policy (“Listen, Yankee”)
were not the kind of accurate em
pirical study which would endear
him to sociologists.
But he captured the imagina
tion of a good many others with
his “revolutionary” approach, and
must be counted as having con
tributed much to understanding
American society.
