SHOULD KNOW MORE
Editor, The Daily:
There is more to the Baran in
cident, and students should know
more. As Conference Vice-Presi
dent of the HR last year. I was
responsible for the sponsorship
of both of Prof. Baran’s speeches.
(When LASSU failed to approve
the constitution of the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee, that group
was offered the support of the
HR for any programs which the
HR deemed appropriate. In this
way, Prof. Baran was prevailed
upon to speak.)
I am now referring to his sec
ond speech, delivered three days
after the unsuccessful Bay of
Pigs invasion during one of the
initial public introductions of
PACE.
The morning of the speech I
received a telephone call from (he
Director of Public Exercises,
Agnes Nohrnberg, who is neither
a scholar nor an expert and who,
above all, is not a policy maker.
She had the following to say:
1. This speech would lose the
University $750,000 ; 2. Trustees
were on campus; 3. Wire services
were on campus covering PACE;
4. The Fair Play Committee was
subversive; 5. Two of its leaders
were as good as “Reds”; 6. What
was I doing at Stanford?
