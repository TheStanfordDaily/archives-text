# Cards Get One of Two
## 
### 
Stanford’s varsity baseball
forces came through with what
regrettably must be termed their
"biggest weekend’’ in league play
last Friday and Saturday.
Truth to tell, the Indians
haven't been exactly burning up
the league this year, and it looked
like another double pasting on the
way when UCLA breezed hit less
i to a 6-4 victory in Friday’s game
j played at Westwood,
i That was a sorry affair, with
j the Stanford hurlers yielding nine
i walks, and the infield committing
I five errors. The loss dropped the
! Indians to 0-5 for the league sea
i son.
Saturday was a different story,
I though, as Darrell Sutherland
| scattered three hits and struck
out five Bruins while getting
nearly flawless fielding support.
Indian batters tabbed UCLA
hurlers for eight hits, and the re
j suit was a 4-0 victory for the
j Cards, their first in league play.

Stanford’s varsity baseball
forces came through with what
regrettably must be termed their
"biggest weekend’’ in league play
last Friday and Saturday.
Truth to tell, the Indians
haven't been exactly burning up
the league this year, and it looked
like another double pasting on the
way when UCLA breezed hit less
i to a 6-4 victory in Friday’s game
j played at Westwood,
i That was a sorry affair, with
j the Stanford hurlers yielding nine
i walks, and the infield committing
I five errors. The loss dropped the
! Indians to 0-5 for the league sea
i son.
Saturday was a different story,
I though, as Darrell Sutherland
| scattered three hits and struck
out five Bruins while getting
nearly flawless fielding support.
Indian batters tabbed UCLA
hurlers for eight hits, and the re
j suit was a 4-0 victory for the

Stanford’s varsity baseball
forces came through with what
regrettably must be termed their
"biggest weekend’’ in league play
last Friday and Saturday.
Truth to tell, the Indians
haven't been exactly burning up
the league this year, and it looked
like another double pasting on the
way when UCLA breezed hit less
i to a 6-4 victory in Friday’s game
j played at Westwood,
i That was a sorry affair, with
j the Stanford hurlers yielding nine
i walks, and the infield committing
I five errors. The loss dropped the
! Indians to 0-5 for the league sea
i son.
Saturday was a different story,
I though, as Darrell Sutherland
| scattered three hits and struck
out five Bruins while getting
nearly flawless fielding support.
Indian batters tabbed UCLA
hurlers for eight hits, and the re
j suit was a 4-0 victory for the
