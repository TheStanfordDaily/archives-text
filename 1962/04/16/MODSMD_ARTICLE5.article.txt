balmy Sunday with splashy ex

Despite organized planning by
frosh chairmen Ann Brown and
Carey Cook the show went wild
like a loose water ski. The left
side of the boat dock caved in
under an overload of spectators.
The canoes hysterically sank be
fore the canoe sinking contest
ever got started. The Delts
drowned Eucalypto’s raft. The re
maining rafts, waterlogged and
groggy, just were not up to their
scheduled race. The Phi Kaps
blistered the hillside with water
bombs from a rumored store of
800. Little old ladies and protec
tive policemen dodged about edgi
ly, trying to keep dry and calm.
THE NOBLE “Aquawazoo II,”
the Phi Kaps’ boat, sank dutifully.

be recorded. Charlie Hawkins
won the Canoe Joust for Guthrie
House with five points. Roble
out-stuffed the Delts in the Canoe
Stuffing contest for five more
points.

ing.

ing the man who did not get wet.
Despite organized planning by
frosh chairmen Ann Brown and
Carey Cook the show went wild
like a loose water ski. The left
side of the boat dock caved in
under an overload of spectators.
The canoes hysterically sank be
fore the canoe sinking contest
ever got started. The Delts
drowned Eucalypto’s raft. The re
maining rafts, waterlogged and
groggy, just were not up to their
scheduled race. The Phi Kaps
blistered the hillside with water
bombs from a rumored store of
800. Little old ladies and protec
tive policemen dodged about edgi
ly, trying to keep dry and calm.
THE NOBLE “Aquawazoo II,”
the Phi Kaps’ boat, sank dutifully.
Scores from only two events could
be recorded. Charlie Hawkins
won the Canoe Joust for Guthrie
House with five points. Roble
out-stuffed the Delts in the Canoe
Stuffing contest for five more
points.
The water skiing was a flashy
exhibition of trick skiing which
included pyramid and twisting
acts and performances on turn
around and shoe skis. A junior
and two freshmen did slalom ski
ing.
The week’s activities are well
