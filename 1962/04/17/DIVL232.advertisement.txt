P.S.
You see, I was right about the wonderful photos that you con take with
the $10.95 Starflash that KEY-BELL Cameras at 121 Stanford Shopping
Center are selling. You sent them to me so quickly too, but then they do
such fast color finishing. Do you know I take my movie film in at three in
the afternoon and collect it the next morning? The picture of baby in the
bath is priceless Aren't flash photos simple’ Fred bought a new Argus
Projector from KEY-BELL last week and it was $2O cheaper than the same
model he saw in the city. You can guess that makes him happy.
