Editor, The Daily:
The reports on the University's
public relations deserve high
praise: praise for Mr. Rapoport’s
scrupulous and controlled objec
tivity, and special praise for his
enterprise in giving us what may
well be the best sustained piece of
thoughtful journalism to have ap
peared in The Daily in the past
six years.

Praise and recognition should
go as well to the staff in Univer
sity Relations and to its new di
rector, Mr. Lyle Nelson. They are
not afraid to remind all of us
alumni, administration, trustees,
students, and faculty that the
true business of a university is
not necessarily “good business"
but responsible investigation and
fearless discussion, and that the
true function of a university is
not to tell society what it wants
to hear but to be ever ready to
tell society what it may not want
to hear.

BUT HIGHEST praise must go
to Friday’s editorial writer for
“Freedom of Dissent” in the way
he forces us to confront the cen
tral question of a free university.
It is easy to defend differences
of views which fall within that
narrow spectrum where most of
us are content to operate: Repub
licans, Democrats, welfare-stat
ists, laissez-faire-ists. A university
deserves no special praise these
days for that routine function.
The real test of university free
dom arises in a case of genuinely
radical dissent, such as is offered
by the presence of Paul Baran.
How well did Stanford University
pass this test? I would suggest
that it passed the test but with a
low enough grade as to warrant
our uneasy and watchful atten
tion.

Though tenure at Stanford car
ries no legal or contractual im
munity against dismissal, it does
carry a moral and institutional
guarantee of security that is the
virtual equivalent of contractual
immunity: dismissal must in fact
rest on one or more of several ex
plicit causes, and the character
of one’s political opinions is cer
tainly not one of them. To the de
mand of a disturbed alumni
fringe that Baran bo fired, the
University commendably pointed
to its tenure regulations and ex
pressed its faith in the right of
professors to hold unpopular
views. So far so good. But the
University was also at this point
offered a splendid chance to make
one additional and crucial conten
tion clear to its critics, and here,
it seems to me. it failed to rise
to the opportunity.
It failed to insist with suffici
ent clarity that Baran’s security
rested not on tenure alone but on
the University’s willing and vol
untary commitment to his pres
ence here, a commitment resting
on the assumption that it is their
central responsibility to provide a
hearing for his Marxist views
even as it provides a hearing for
humanists, Christians, poets, ma

terialists, Jeffersonians, mystics,
Keynesians, and disciples of Her
bert Hoover, not because all
views must be represented but
because men who are deemed re
sponsible enough to teach, think,
and write at Stanford must he
accorded a bearing for the views
they happen to hold. The Univer
sity has asserted its general will
ingness to uphold this position.
The extent to which its letters to
alumni did not uphold this posi
tion with respect to Baran must
be accounted a sign of internal
confusion over principles which
can only dishearten Stanford's
true friends and encourage its ad
versaries.

THE CONFUSION is a real
one, and it seems to me to stem
from a mistaken notion by the
University of the contingent na
ture of free discussion. Over the
past two years the administra
tion has repeatedly maintained
that free discussion can be as
sured at Stanford only where tlie
discussion is “responsible.” On
first glance this is plausible
enough in the abstract. But in
the absence of a clearly defined
procedure to determine what is
“responsible” and what is not,
this abstraction is meaningless,
and when applied to individual
cases it is apt to he mischievous
and subversive of the entire prin
ciple. Do we censor speeches in
advance? Plainly we would not.

Do we compile a blacklist of
speakers whose previous utter
ances lead us to conclude that
they will speak so irresponsibly
that we must deny them the priv
ilege of speaking at Stanford? A
case could be made for such a
list, but it would be absurd to
place a faculty member on it and
yet insist that he still continue to
teach and draw a salary. If a com
petent economic thinker who is
also an accepted member of the
faculty returns from a trip to
Cuba and speaks favorably of the
Castro revolution. I may person
ally believe his judgment uncon
vincing, and others may even
think it dead wrong.

lt would never occur to me to
consider it “irresponsible.” Rath
er, should I not assume that any
one worthy of tenure appointment
to the Stanford faculty is auto
matically “responsible” in all
those pursuits of mind, thought,
and opinion for which he was ap
pointed? Either a professor by
his actions forfeits his tenure or
he does not. If he does, he should
be dismissed. If he does not, the
University should not put itself
in (ho intolerably arbitrary and
intellectually dubious position of
subjecting his work to an unde
fined test of “responsibility.”
Along that path lies great dan
ger to the well-being of a mature
academic community.

REFERENDUM ILLEGAL
Editor, Tlie Daily;
Two years ago I was a mem
ber of the Legislature of ASSU.

Din ing the year that I served. I |
became familiar with the consti
tution. If the vote on today’s
referendum is affirmative, this j
constitution will be replaced by a
new one. This may or may not be j
a good thing; this is not the point |
I mean to make here.

The point is this: according to
our present constitution, (which
is still in effect I this referendum
is being held illegally. According
to our present constitution, Ar
ticle IX, Section 3, “Notice." “The
proposed amendment, together
with the part affected thereby,
shall be published in The Stan
ford Daily on at least two separ
ate days during the week prior to
election day.” As you can see
from page four of today’s or yes
terday’s paper, this has not been
done.
808 SAYLER, ASSU President,
said to me Monday afternoon that
"the ASSU does not have the
money to pay The Daily to print
both constitutions.” This is what
Art. IX, Section 3, stipulates: both
the old and the new Constitution
must he presenter! to the student
borly in The Daily. How many of
you, though you might want to
compare a questionable para
graph in the new Constitution
with its counterpart in the old
one, will take the trouble to go to
the ASSU office, find a copy, sit
there, and read it? If you feel
slighted, vote no, and when it is
presented again, I am sure the
constitution will he followed.
If the ASSU President cannot
follow the old constitution be
cause of lack of funds, why does
he recommend its inclusion in the
proposed constitution? This, at
least, you can check: see Article
VII, section 3, on page four.

SHAM
Editor, The Daily:
We are deeply indebted to you
for printing the proposed ASSU
Constitution, for thus it is held
up to our eyes as a sham and a
delusion. It almost appears that
the members of Legislature are
deluding themselves.
Among the rights in Article II
are statements of high idealism,
followed by qualifications robbing
them of all meaning. In good con
science I cannot give assent to a
document recognizing “acknowl
edged restraints” and “accepted
safeguards” when it fails not only
to define the restraints, but fails
even to specify who shall "safe
guard” us at some future time.
I AM IN favor of freedom of
assembly, and I am glad that
the ASSU has tile courage to give
lip service to it in paragraph 4,
but by making all who would
avail themselves of this right
“subject to compliance with
stated procedural requirements,”
the right becomes a whim of the
university administration.
In effect, we are being asked

today to approve in advance any
regulations, however arbitrary,
which may be promulgated at any
future time. A hint of things to
come may be seen in the threat
to the president of HR reported
in yesterday’s Daily.

The effect of such reservations
is to say: “All authority for
ASSU derives from the president
and administration of the Univer
sity." I am not prepared to argue
this is undesirable, I only assert
that if it is to be, it should be
clearly stated, not clouded in hy
pocracy.

IT IS unfortunate that the pro
posed constitution is published
only the day before the referen
dum, leaving hardly time for in
telligent study and discussion. It
is even more unfortunate in that
some people may think it is an
attempt at railroading, and thus
be unfavorably disposed at the
polls. But I trust Stanford stu
dents will be sufficiently impar
tial to vote on the merits of the
document itself, rather than the
highhanded manner of presenta
tion.
Lin Jensen
AGAINST NEW
( (INSTITUTION
Editor, The Daily:
At last the proposed new con
stitution has been unveiled. As
was noted in The Daily editorial,
the constitution is not a perfect
one, the main problem being in
the composition of the new legis
lature.

First it provides one represen
tative for every 75 off-campus
students, then one for every 75
graduate students, elected by aca
demic division. As if just glimps
ing the problem created here by
the fact that over S5 per cent of
graduate students live off cam
pus, the constitution provides
that each student may vote in
only one constituency—but which
one? How many off-campus or
graduate constituencies are
there?

EVEN ASSUMING that the
problem is resolved, perhaps by
an involved voter registration
plan, what happens then? As a
Daily writer noted last week,
graduate students will have about
50 out of 120 seats in LASSU.

But who is to occupy them? In
the past, grad students have
shown little or no interest in stu
dent government. One of their
representatives is currently serv
ing his third term in LASSU,
largely because no one ever both
ered to oppose him. Less than 5
per cent of the grad students usu
ally vote.
What would actually happen
under the new constitution is that
a small group of politically in
clined grad students would run
a slate of faceless candidates.

SINCE THERE would always
he more offices than candidates,

they would be elected, dutifully
sign their proxies, and then dis
appear into the obscurity from
whence they came.

The only alternative to such a
farce, which would give one or
two grad students 30 or 40 votes
in a legislature claiming to speak
for all the students of Stanford,
is to vote NO on the proposed
constitution. Let the legislators
come up with a better one.

PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily article of April 12 by
Miss Strelitz on the Library In
spection System again brings to
light an important problem that
has plagued the University re
cently. In recommending that stu
dents' briefcases and binders be
inspected upon leaving the Re
serve Book Room oi- the main
stacks of the University Library,
the Faculty Committee on the Li
brary is expressing great distrust
of Stanford students.

The committee decision that
the Honor Code has no relevance
to this inspection system is a very
disturbing one. Although there
have been problems in the func
tioning of the Honor Code in re
lation to examinations and the li
brary, it seems that by limiting the
realm of applicability of the Hon
or Code, the administration is
really defeating the purpose of
the Code.

Certainly the citing of thefts
from the Library is valid evidence
in favor of a security system.
But if a security system is insti
tuted in the library, perhaps soon
the administration will decide to
institute a security system for the
taking of examinations. Such ac
tion cannot be condemned; many
fine universities have library se
curity systems and proctored ex
aminations.
But the administration of Stan
ford University, by establishing
a desire to foster the growth of
self-discipline and honor on the
part of students. If such a system
can not function effectively at
Stanford, what is necessary is a
reevaluation of the honor princi
ple, and not a more precise and
further delineation of the applic
ability of the honor principle.
