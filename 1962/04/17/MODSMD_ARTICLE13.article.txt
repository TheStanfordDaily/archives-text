# Sigma Chi Wins Mural Title

By ROGER .MENOKI.SON
Sigma Chi threw up a vise-tight !
defense to hold Theta Dell to six j
points in the second half and go j

undefeated to their third straight
intramural basketball champion
ship, 34-27, last night in the Pa
vilion.

The Theta Delts compensated I
for their great height disadvan-1
tage by working for open shots
and taking advantage of Sigma j
Chi’s sloppy passing to lead for
three-fourths of the game.
In the first half, Steve King’s |
Jump shots had sparked them to

an 18-10 lead wdth three minutes
left. But at this point, the heavily
favored Sigma Chis began to
catch up. Nels Christensen, their |
leading scorer this season, sank
three jump shots and Bill Cover j
scored a three-point play to re
duce the margin at half to 21-17. ,
Nine minutes in the second i
half, the Sigma Chi had blown i
four chances to tie the game due
to bad passes, but finally, meaty j
Chris .lessen spotted an opening, j
drove tho baseline, and rolled in |
a three-footer to even it at 24-24. i
Munn Chin momentarily pul i
Theta Delt ahead with a 20-footer,
but Cover matched it with a lay
up. In the next 90 seconds, Chris
tensen shook loose for two crip
ples, and Sigma Chi had broken
out of the corral to romp home
with the win.
In the closing minutes, Jessen’s |
great offensive rebounding, which i
had been unrewarded throughout
the game as far as leading to j
baskets, finally paid off. Chris 1
followed two consecutive missed :
free throws by shoving the ball
through the hoop, to tie for top
scorer with 13 points. King also
had 13 while Christensen made 12. :
