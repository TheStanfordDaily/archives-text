# LASSU Approval of Non-Violence Group Negated
## Sterling's Note To Peace Group

(Editor’s Note; The following
is the text of a letter from Presi
rent Wallace Sterling to Daniel
Cohen, head of the Forum, dated
April 16, 1963.)
Dear Mr. Cohen;
Not only because of certain
constitutional obligations, but in
the interests of sound policy.
Stanford University, as an inde
pendent institution of higher edu
cation, expects to be free from in
terference by either governmental
agencies or pressure groups in
the pursuit of its educational pro
gram. It accepts a corresponding
obligation to maintain a nonparti
san position with respect to po
litical issues and to prevent its
privileged position from becom
ing a sanctuary for partisan po
litical and social action.

IN THESE self-imposed restric
tions, the University in no way
interferes with the right of stu
dents as individuals to affiliate
with partisan groups, to take part
in social and political action or
otherwise to exercise their nor
mal rights of citizenship. It must
insist, however, that such actions
avoid the involvement of the
University.
The University, of course, has
a direct and strong interest in
education in political and social
matters, and it actively encour
ages discussion about political
and social issues. In recognition
of this interest, the University
has given strong support to the
establishment and development
of the Political Union and its
program. As you know, the Po
litical Union is an administrative
board of the Associated Students,
and it is charged with fostering
discussions of political ideas and
the promotion of political educa
tion outside the classroom.
IN THE presentation of any
program of discussion of political
and social ideas, I recognize the
difficulty of maintaining the kind
of balance which is consistent
with institutional nonpartisan
ship. If competing groups wore
to be established, each with the
privilege of holding open meet
ings, the problem would be ac
centuated greatly and the privi
lege of the Associated Students
in sponsoring such programs
would be placed in jeopardy. As I
believe you know, the chartering
of the Forum For the Discussion
of Non-Violent Alternatives to
War was seriously questioned on
two grounds. The first is the
strong implication in the pro
posed constitution that its pri
mary purpose is the promotion of
a particular viewpoint. (For ex

difficulty of maintaining the kind

Dear Mr. Cohen;
Not only because of certain
constitutional obligations, but in
the interests of sound policy.
Stanford University, as an inde
pendent institution of higher edu
cation, expects to be free from in
terference by either governmental
agencies or pressure groups in
the pursuit of its educational pro
gram. It accepts a corresponding
obligation to maintain a nonparti
san position with respect to po
litical issues and to prevent its
privileged position from becom
ing a sanctuary for partisan po
litical and social action.

IN THESE self-imposed restric
tions, the University in no way
interferes with the right of stu
dents as individuals to affiliate
with partisan groups, to take part
in social and political action or
otherwise to exercise their nor
mal rights of citizenship. It must
insist, however, that such actions
avoid the involvement of the
University.
The University, of course, has
a direct and strong interest in
education in political and social
matters, and it actively encour

and social issues. In recognition
