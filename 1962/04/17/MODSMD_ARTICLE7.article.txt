# Capitol Backstage Tuesday Topic
## 
### 
Helen Hill Miller, former Wash
ington bureau chief for The Lon
don Economist, will give the
Tuesday Evening Series audience
a peek into “The Washington
Scene Backstage” tonight at 7:45
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Mrs. Miller, who has been in
Washington as a government of
ficial and professional journalist
since 1930, is a graduate of Bryn
Mawr. She earned a diploma in
economics and political science
from Oxford University and holds
a doctorate in political science
from the University of Chicago.
In 1940, she was named corre
spondent for The Economist and
from 1943 to 1950 was its chief
American editorial representative.
After a two-year stint in 1950-
52 as a member of Newsweek
Magazine's Washington Bureau
staff, Mrs. Miller resigned to de
vote her time to free-lancing.
ganization were privileged to pre
sent open meetings on the cam
pus, it would be in direct conflict
with the responsibilities of the
Political Union. The University
withheld its objection to the char
tering of your organization by
LASSU only with the understand
ing that your organization was to
be a discussion group for your
members only, and that the or
ganization would not sponsor
meetings open to the public and
to the student body at large.
I NOTE particularly the assur
ances in your letter of October
10 that the purposes of your or
ganization are nonpartisan in
every sense. In my mind this adds
weight to the argument that your
proposed activities fall within the
sphere of the Political Union. Ac
cordingly, I strongly urge that
you make use of the established
channels of the Political Union
in the accomplishment of your
purposes.
Sincerely yours,
J. E. Wallace Sterling
