# Administration and Legislature Engaged in Jurisdiction Struggle
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ 
In action extending over the
past two weeks, the University
administration has negated Legis
lature’s approval of the Constitu
tion of the Stanford peace group
Forum for the Discussion of Non-
Violent Alternatives to War as it
was passed last quarter.
Dissension arose as Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler
contacted the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises to “hold up” on ap
proval of the peace group’s spon
sorship of the Erich Fromm ad
dress on campus Friday. ASSU
had approved this sponsorship as
had. to that point, Public Exer
cises. Winbigler had understood
that the Forum would not be
sponsoring campus addresses and
felt it was a violation of Univer
sity policy for them to do so.
As Fromm was already on cam
pus visiting the freshmen, his
talk was sponsored jointly by
them and the University.
ACCORDING TO Director of
Public Events, Public Exercises
Committee, Agnes Nohrnberg,
“Normally, if a Forum has ASSU
approval, Public Exercises ap
proves it if the speaker is accept
able. Then the question was
raised if this group was chartered
to sponsor speakers. We were told
to hold it. Then Public Exercises
dropped it.
“The next, thing I heard was
that in the eyes of some of ASSU
and the administration the Forum
was not chartered to hold public
meetings. We thought that the
University better take over the
sponsorship of the speech as we
wanted the student body to hear
Fromm.”
Winbigler, who had objected to
the Forum’s original constitution
(rejected by Legislature) was un
der the understanding that the
group would not be permitted to
sponsor outside speakers for all
campus addresses, thereby, ho
felt, infringing upon the position
of Political Union.
WINBIGLER STATED, in ref
erence to the article in the group’s
constitution that allows for out
side speakers, “I understood this
was to be deleted or revised,
. . . The University withheld its
objection to chartering the group,
but reported to the Trustees that
it would not be having outside
speakers.”
According to ASSU President
Bob Sayler, an understanding had
been made between Winbigler and
ASSU administrative assistant
Jock Mcßaine that outside speak
ers were to be barred. Sayler did
not know of this agreement, but
says it has been verified to him
by Mcßaine.
Winbigler’s decision is that the
group can either go under the
■ auspices of Political Union, or
operate as a closed forum with
programs only for its own mem
bers. According to the Dean, the
group would be “exceedingly inef
fectual with these limitations un
; less it goes in with Political
1 Union.
“IN SOME RESPECTS the par-
I tisan issue is important, but it is
| not the final issue. Our belief is
j that it is partisan, but even if it
[ is not, there is all the more sup-
I port for the argument that it is
! in Political Union territory.
“There is no possibility of the
| University approving forums in
| addition to Political Union.”
Sayler stated, “This should
j have been a Legislature decision.
| After four weeks of thorough con
■ sideration, we made our decision.
It is Legislature’s position to ac
cept or reject proposals, within
the range of University policy.
i We approved the constitution of
this group. . . . We have been
overridden.

“1 spoke to Dean Winbigler be
fore the Constitution was passed,
and knew his objections. His un
derstanding was that I would
change to his views. I didn’t.
“I will actively back this group,
actively stand up lor our de
cision.”

SAYLER NOTED that Mcßaine
had told the student leader of the
Forum Dan Cohen that the Con
stitution would not pass with out

side speakers included. Mcßaine
told this to the Dean and, accord
ing to Sayler “thought that Legis
lature understood that they
couldn’t bring in speakers,” The
constitution, however, was ap
proved.
In an April 10 letter to Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling,
Cohen and Stephen Morris, also
a leader of the group, stated,
“The Cnstitution was passed by
the Legislature, establishing the
Forum as an independent student
group, not as a caucus of the
Political Union, on the basis that
it was a non-partisan organization
concerned with airing all view
points relating to non-violent al
ternatives to war.
“ . . . The position that we
have maintained is that we are
non-partisan because we do not
espouse the platform of any po
litical party or ideology. We do
not even present one viewpoint
on any specific issue. Rather, we
hope to present all viewpoints on
one very pressing and important
problem, namely, alternatives to
war.
"... The second objection
presented by the administration
concerns the maintenance of a
proper balance in the program of
campus-wide events. .. . We
must counter this argument by
pointing out that all activities,
including ours, of a campus-wide
nature need to be approved by
both the Public Exercises Com
mittee and the ASSU.”
IN A LETTER of reply to Co
hen dated yesterday, Sterling re
marks that the University accepts
an “ . . . obligation to maintain
a nonpartisan position with re
spect to political issues and to
prevent its privileged position
from becoming a sanctuary for
partisan political and social ac
tion.
“ . . . chartering of the Forum
for the Discussion of Non-Violent
Alternatives to War was seriously
questioned on two grounds. The
first is the strong implication in
the proposed constitution that its
primary purpose is the promotion
of a particular viewpoint. (Ster
ling here cites specifically Article
11, Section 2: “to maintain a co
ordinating center for the publi
city of all activities relating to
non-violence which occur within
the Stanford Community,”)
“The second is that if your or
ganization were privileged to pre
sent open meetings on the cam
pus, it would be in direct conflict
with the responsibilities of the
Political Union.

“ . . . I STRONGLY urge
that you make use of the estab
lished channels of the Political
Union in the accomplishment of
your purposes.”
The matter is now left with two
channels: Winbigler will once
again report on it to the Board
of Trustees. Sayler will bring
the matter back to LASSU in an
attempt to establish who holds
the power of decision in the mat
ter. Sayler says he plans to “try
to evolve what LASSU can do.”
