CASE HISTORIES FROM
A MENTAL HOSPITAL
Fifteen years ago, Topeka State Hos
pital was a snake pit. Today, it’s one
of the world's finest hospitals. In
this week’s Post, you’ll read case his
tories from their files. You’ll meet a
football star who wouldn’t speak for
twenty years. A “model” child who
shouted obscenities. And an old man
whose family insisted he was dead.
