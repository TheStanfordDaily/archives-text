WHERE WILL YOU BE AT AGE 30?
Will You Be Earning $15,000 A Year Or More?
Will You Have A Capital Fund of $30,000 Or More?
These are realistic goals for you in the
field of investment analysis if you have
brains and are willing to use them.
INVESTMENT ANALYSIS must fascinate any think
ing man. Whatever happens in any part of the world is
related to the value of securities a new upheaval in
Africa, development of the European Common Market,
Communist economic policies, military aggression in
the Far East all have an influence upon the value of
securities on the New York Stock Exchange and the
Over-thc-Counter markets. In no other field of investi
gation not even journalism can a man find such
quick identification with world-wide affairs as in the
slock market.
To a small number of men who arc about to graduate
from college and who have proved by their scholastic
records that they arc capable of doing hard, intelligent
work, the Value Line Investment Survey, one of the
world’s foremost investment advisory services, offers
the following;
(1) a six-months course of training in security analysis,
taught by the head of the Value Line organization
and its top editor-analysts.
(2) the following minimum salary schedules:
For three months during the tuition period from
July 15th to October 15th $300.00 per month.
For the next three months from October 15th
to January 15th $400.00 per month. And for...
the first year following ..... $6,000.00
the second year 7,000.00
the third year 8,000.00
the fourth year 9,000.00
the fifth year 10,000.00
the sixth year 12,000.00
the seventh year 13,000.00
the eighth year 14,000.00
the ninth year 15,000.00
the tenth year 16,000.00
the eleventh year 17,000.00
The increases in pay arc, of course, accompanied by
promotions in title and responsibility as well. In perhaps
no other securities research organization can the excep
tionally able analyst advance so rapidly to a position of
meaningful responsibility and stature.
If an analyst fails to receive the minimum advance
indicated by this schedule, he will be on notice that his
resignation is desired. It is probable that of those who
are accepted most can and will go ahead faster than
shown in this schedule.
In addition to the salary, the company provides a
profit sharing plan which, under the minimum salary
schedules, should result in providing a capital fund of
around $35,000 to $50,000 (as a long term capital gain)
at the end of the twelfth year of employment.
In addition, the company provides, entirely at com
pany expense, the following insurance benefits: hospi
talization, accident, major medical and life.
Only a few men will be selected for these positions.
They will be selected from the tops of their classes,
after testing that confirms our own investigation of their
aptitude for the work.
This is a challenging offer to men who seek security
as well as fortune in the relatively near future.
A security analyst with the Value Line Survey is not
precluded from investing for his own account, provided
his investments are bought or sold in a manner that is
not in conflict with the interests of the service’s sub
scribers or its clients.
Not only will the candidates receive careful instruc
tion, enjoy the opportunity to meet top corporate execu
tives of the companies whose securities they study, and
have access to all current reports and news-articles in
our library, but they will also have the benefit of
exchanging ideas with experienced and stimulating
analysts within the organization.
Those students, men or women, who feel that they
may be qualified for the positions described above and
who arc interested in careers in securities research, in
creasingly the heart of the whole investment business,
arc requested to forward brief resumes of their college
records including marks, class standing, etc., and of
any rcvclant work experience to the address below.
