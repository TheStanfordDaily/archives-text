A NIGHT WITH
THE CRIME SQUAD
Under cover of the San Francisco
fog, anything can happen: rape, rob
bery, murder. And it’s the job of the

tells how a squad of undercover cops
cracks down on hoods. Says how
they keep their activities hushed up.
And gives an hour-by-hour report of
a typical night's police work.
