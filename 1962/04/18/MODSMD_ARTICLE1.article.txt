### 
NEW ORLEANS (UPI)—An excommunicated Roman Catho
lic segregationist flung herself on hands and knees in public
before Archbishop Joseph Francis Rummel yesterday and begged
him to “admit before God” that he was wrong in ordering parochial
school integration. “Don’t listen to Satan, listen to God,” cried

Mrs. J. B. Gaillot, almost pros
trate before the churchman. He
stood in stony silence.
She pleaded for his mercy. But
there was no appeal for forgive
ness that might lift the excom
munication forbidding her most
sacraments of the church.
“I DID NOT beg his excellen
cy’s forgiveness,” the mother of
three children said later. She
maintained her belief that the
Bible teaches segregation and
that integration is the work of
the devil.
Instead, she implored God’s
mercy on Archbishop Rummel’s
soul. She said she could not be
lieve that he himself had ordered
her excommunicated, although
the order was signed by him.
“Admit in your heart (hat you
had nothing to do with excommu
nicating me,” Mrs. Gaillot told
the archbishop, “I am not ap
oligizing. I beg your mercy.
Look up to Heaven and admit you
know that God’s law is to segre
gate.”
TWENTY-FIVE men and wom
en continued to picket the arch
bishop’s residence after his en
counter with Mrs. Gaillot. One
picket carried a sign saying: “Je
sus was born of the House of
David of pure white stock in Ju
dea--a white country. It is our
sacred duty to preserve the white
race of Jesus.”
Another sign said: “Have so
cialist agents infiltrated the Cath
olic religion? Integration is part
of the international Communist
criminal conspiracy.”
Mrs. Gaillot, president of the
small segregationist organization,
Save Our Nation. Inc., (SON) was
one of three persons Rummel ex
communicated Monday for refus
ing to stop fighting the parochial
school integration order.
