stitution in yesterday’s referen
dum.)

The voters have chosen, the
idea has been chased, and David
Hume has knowingly nodded his
head.
1. IT WAS said of the proposal
that it was a political railroad.
If so, it was a railroad of a pe
culiar sort. The project was in
itiated by 40 students, mostly
seniors, ranging from the co-cap
tain of the football team to the

RA of the Zota Psi fraternity.
They were brought together by
a profound conviction that the
students fell regrettably short of
their potential to participate in
the decisionmaking process of
the University. For the authors
of the constitution, passage in
volved no political favors, no
monetary rewards, no increases
in personal power. Rather, pas
sage would have been something
left behind to a great university
which the students were obliged
to make greater.
2. IT WAS said of the proposal
that the authors acted irresponsi
bly— the document was not offi
cially submitted to the student
body until Monday morning. Cer
tainly, it is regrettable that the
document was not published until
Monday; it is regrettable that the
election had to be held in April;
it is regrettable that we had but
six months to revise a way of
thinking and to rewrite a charter
of government; it is regrettable
that despite the intensive efforts
of the Committee on Revision,
the first time that the constitu
tion could have been submitted
in final form in the Daily was
this Monday, and that the last
possible time at which the refer
endum could be held was yester
day.
Considering all of this, where
does the “responsibility” lie?
With the authors of the docu
ment? Thirteen extraordinary
and open sessions of Legislature
were called to discuss the changes
during the last six months; 14
open meetings of the Committee
on Revision have been held since
October; 11 major articles have
intermittently appeared since Oc
tober in The Daily, explaining the
nature of the changes and asking
for comments and criticisms;
speakers were sent to every liv
ing group which would give them
audience.
OR DOES THE responsibility
lie with those who did not ques
tion the speakers, read the arti
cles, attend the sessions, appeal
to t lie Chairman of the Commit
tee, drop by the ASSU President’s
Office, or contact their LASSU
representative? The inescapable
irony of the situation is that while
we tried to communicate by every
means at our disposal the most
significant shortcoming of the
status quo—that communication
is nearly impossible—and that
above all better communicative
devices must be instituted in stu
dent government, we failed to
communicate this point. In effect,
the weakness of student govern
ment became the cause of the in
abilit to strengthen it.
3) IT WAS said by the IFC
that the proposal jeopardized the
“power” of the IFC; by a faction
in Stern that the proposal gave
too much power to the fraterni
ties; by a group of gi'aduates that
it was an attempt to undermine
the graduate voice; by a group of
undergraduates that it gave too
much voice to the graduates.
The essence of the new consti
tution was that it was an attempt
to give more power to the student
body as a whole--not to one fac
tion or another. What drove the
student body apart was an under
lying assumption on the part of
each splinter of the campus com
position that somehow inside ev
ery coffe cup and under every
table was a mysterious, diaboli
cal force dedicated to the oblitera
tion of that particuar interest.
PARADOXICALLY, the short
sighted fear of each power block
prevented the student body as a
whole from establishing a frame
work by which it could gain that
strengthened voice in University
affairs which the administration
and faculty were prepared to give
it.
4. It was said of the proposal
that appointment of Council
members (by a three-man group,
with the approval or disapproval
of Legislature) is tyranny—after
all, one has a “right” to vote for
jurists. This is skullduggery.
One has, above all, a right to fair
and honest judgment. Discussing
any other right is question beg
ging. Is the inevitable Men’s
Council candidate who runs on
the ticket that “we’re going to
loosen up” giving honest judg
ments? Does the Fedei’al judici
ary, and particularly the Supreme
Court, deny the people a “right”
because they are appointed?
THE CONSTITUTION was
based on a syllogistic assumption:
• Students desire to participate
in the decision-making processes
of the University.
• Students are worthy to par
ticipate in this decision-making
process;
• Therefore, students deserve
to participate in this process. The
inveterate optimists among us
will continue to cling to these
premises.
