# Prof. Proposes Freeway Plan

Coordination of plans for the
Willow Freeway and flood con
trol on San Francisquito Creek
might result in savings to both
projects, according to Stanford’s
Professor Ray K. Linsley.
“The selected route lies very
close to San Francisquito Creek
from El Camino Real to Pope
St. and crosses the creek twice
in this distance,” noted Linsley,
head of the Department of Civil
Engineering, in an economic
study of the proposed Ladera
Dam.

Linsley further stated that re
construction of the Middlefield
Rd. and Pope St. bridges would
lead to some straightening of the
creek, that the freeway might
form an effective levee in some
places, and that many properties
which would be condemned for
the freeway would reduce land
acquisition costs for channel im
provements.
