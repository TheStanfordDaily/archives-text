# IFC Opposition Held Instrumental to Defeat
## 
### TOM COLEMAN 
The proposed ASSU constitution was defeated yesterday by a
vote of 711 to 743, far short of the two-thirds majority necessary
to win its acceptance. Out of more than 9,500 eligible voters only
1,454 went to the polls.
A spokesman for the Student Committee for Good Campus
Government, which opposed adoption of the new constitution, said

-that the committee was elated by
the good judgment shown by
Stanford students at the polls
yesterday.
Steve Dietrich. Secretary of the
committee, said the entire consti
tution was objectionable, but
parts were particularly bad.
ACCORDING TO Ed Eshbach,
IFC president, his organization
discussed the proposed constitu
tion at its meeting Monday night
and concluded that “more time
was necessary to consider it” and
recommend certain changes in its
content.
(At Monday night’s IFC meet
ing the representatives are re
ported to have voted 22-17 to rec
ommend that fraternity members
vote “no” in the referendum.)
But in reply to Eshbach"s state
ment, Jim Woolsey, one of the
principal drafters of the new con
stitution, said, “It is understand
able, even predictable, that IFC
would not desire publicity con
cerning Monday night’s meeting.
The objections seemed to be
threefold: that legislature was
taking power from them, that
they didn’t know what was going
on. Legislature almost considered
rush this fall; it could consider
rush under the old constitution
and under the new as well if the
president’s office requested it.
“THERE HAVE been six
months of open meetings of leg
islature on the constitution, all
publicized in The Daily. If the
Row fraternity representatives
and the IFC president (who was
on the committee) did not bring
any suggestions from IFC and
report Legislature’s procedings
to it, we can only conclude that
IFC’s interest in student govern
ment is of an entirely passive and
negative nature.
“THE SPIRIT of this interest
is best summed up by the fact
that one of the individuals who
castigated us most severely for
not informing him of what was
going on had refused to lot me
speak at his fraternity earlier in
the evening because of lack of
time and interest. Many mem
bers of IFC expressed a fear that
IFC would lose face if the pro
ceedings of the meeting were
made known.”
VARIOUS OBJECTIONS to the
proposed constitution have been
expressed in recent letters to the
editor. Sasha Lanz, in yesterday’s
Daily, alleged that the constitu
tion’s referendum was illegal,
since the old and new constitu
tions had not both been printed
in The Daily. In commenting on
the outcome of the referendum,
he said he was glad the new con
stitution was not accepted.

stitution, said, “It is understand
able, even predictable, that IFC
would not desire publicity con
cerning Monday night’s meeting.
The objections seemed to be
threefold: that legislature was
taking power from them, that
they didn’t know what was going
on. Legislature almost considered
rush this fall; it could consider
rush under the old constitution
and under the new as well if the
president’s office requested it.
“THERE HAVE been six
months of open meetings of leg
islature on the constitution, all
publicized in The Daily. If the
Row fraternity representatives
and the IFC president (who was
on the committee) did not bring
any suggestions from IFC and
report Legislature’s procedings
to it, we can only conclude that
IFC’s interest in student govern
ment is of an entirely passive and
negative nature.
“THE SPIRIT of this interest
is best summed up by the fact
that one of the individuals who
castigated us most severely for
not informing him of what was
going on had refused to lot me
speak at his fraternity earlier in
the evening because of lack of
time and interest. Many mem
bers of IFC expressed a fear that
IFC would lose face if the pro
ceedings of the meeting were
made known.”
VARIOUS OBJECTIONS to the
proposed constitution have been
expressed in recent letters to the
editor. Sasha Lanz, in yesterday’s
Daily, alleged that the constitu
tion’s referendum was illegal,
since the old and new constitu
tions had not both been printed
in The Daily. In commenting on
the outcome of the referendum,
he said he was glad the new con
stitution was not accepted.
The proposed ASSU constitution was defeated yesterday by a
vote of 711 to 743, far short of the two-thirds majority necessary
to win its acceptance. Out of more than 9,500 eligible voters only
1,454 went to the polls.
A spokesman for the Student Committee for Good Campus
Government, which opposed adoption of the new constitution, said

-that the committee was elated by
the good judgment shown by
Stanford students at the polls
yesterday.
Steve Dietrich. Secretary of the
committee, said the entire consti
tution was objectionable, but
parts were particularly bad.
ACCORDING TO Ed Eshbach,
IFC president, his organization
discussed the proposed constitu
tion at its meeting Monday night
and concluded that “more time
was necessary to consider it” and
recommend certain changes in its
content.
(At Monday night’s IFC meet
ing the representatives are re
ported to have voted 22-17 to rec
ommend that fraternity members
vote “no” in the referendum.)
But in reply to Eshbach"s state
ment, Jim Woolsey, one of the
principal drafters of the new con
stitution, said, “It is understand
