# Steel Price Hassle Display of Power
## 
### 
The strangest tiling about the up-again (low n-again price-jug
gling ot the steel producers is that it happened at all. With the
vast amounts ol money the steel industry spends on public rela
tions each year it is hard to understand win the original price rise
was announced in such away as to bring down the wrath ol the
government with such vehemence that the rise had to be rescinded.
'I he public image ol the companies has been seriously damaged
(they have always been their own best reason for nationalization
ol the industry anyway) and now they won t even have greater
profits to console them.
President Kennethâ€™s role in the reversal ol the original decision
must not be uudcrempbasi/ed. One television commentator said
the statement at his news conference w as the strongest Presidential
statement since Pearl Harbor. It was reported that every important
administration official called every important steel executive he
knew to urge reconsideration of the price rise. The Justice Depart
ment began an investigation in record time. All in all it was an
amazing displax ot executive power.
Phis triumph should give Kennedy food for thought. Full use
of his official and semi-official powers brought about the result
he desired, lie has been less forthright in his actions in other areas
which are as important as the price of steel. We think that if
Kennedy were publicly to get as excited about his civil rights
program or his medical care for the aged bill or his program for
Federal aid to education, he might surprise even himself at how
powerful and effective he reallv can be.
