LIQUOR
Editor, The Daily:
We believe that Stanford Uni
versity maintains a liquor policy
which is both unrealistic and con
trary to the concept of dignity
and individual responsibility upon
which a university should rest.
Students are encouraged, when
they enter this University, to con
sider themselves responsible
adults; entrusted with their own
futures; allowed to choose their
courses and careers; privileged to
study when and if they please;
encouraged to confront philosoph
ical and political conflict; and, in
particular, challenged to conduct
themselves by an Honor Code
and a Fundamental Standard.
THE FUNDAMENTAL Stand
ard says of itself; “This is the
concept of personal honor, based
on the principles of integrity,
common sense, and respect for
civil law which we students bring
with us to Stanford. ... In fol
lowing the principles of the Fun
demental Standard, the student
first of all acquires a sense of
responsibility and citizenship, as
well as moral growth.”
But under the section titled
‘Fundamental Standard in Prac
tice’ we find that “University
rules and traditions prohibit pos
session of any intoxicating liq
uors.” But we also find that the
“question of drinking is a per
sonal matter.” This is a definite
contradiction.
THE PRESENT RULE was
made long ago by the Board of
Trustees and is found today in
the By-laws of the Associated
Students. It is not included in*
the Will or the Founding Grant.
Furthermore, the rule as it now
stands is not a requirement of
state law. The Stanford regula
tion makes no differentiation as
to legal age requirements or to
the mode of use or misuse of liq
uor.
What have been the conse
quences of this rule? The rule is
obviously unenforceable. It is safe
to say that a majority of stu
dents, during their four years
here, have engaged in some form
of disobedience. These students
are generally law-abiding. But
they properly resent this incur
sion upon their privacy.
SECOND, the records of The
Daily indicate that several acci
dents and deaths have resulted
from drinking which is done at
off-campus parties. It is not un
likely that had the rule been abol
ished and these parties held on
campus, these mishaps would
have been avoided.
Drinking, per se, can be noth
ing but a personal matter.

I We recognize the responsibility
| of students to regulate and pun
j ish “disturbance of order and
! privacy and destruction of prop
i erty.” But we vigorously reject
j the assumption that students can
j not control themselves when al
lowed freedom of choice.
WITHIN THE bounds of free
j dom stated above the liquor regu
[ lation has no place. While it re
mains, who among us can view
I seriously all other protestations
jof confidence in student compe
tence? Therefore we propose that
the Student Association By-Laws,
Article I. Section iiiß. be amended
to read as follows:
; The possession, transportation,
j or use of intoxicating liquors
by Stanford students in the
University community shall be
in accordance with State Law,
and no judicial counsel of the
University shall punish a stu
dent for possession, transpor
tation, or use of intoxicating
liquors where the State Law
has not been violated.
WE HAVE submitted a petition
for a student referendum on this
proposed amendment. Under the
i ASSU By-Laws, unless this peti
! tion is rejected by the Legislature
Within 15 days, a referendum
| must be held. We ask all students
I whose views are similar to ours
j to urge strongly their Legislature
! representatives to allow the stu
dent body to vote on this issue.
We also call upon students and
; faculty to declare their agreement
by adding their names to this
resolution. A copy will be on En
gineering Corner for the next two
days.

LIQUOR
Editor, The Daily:
We believe that Stanford Uni
versity maintains a liquor policy
which is both unrealistic and con
trary to the concept of dignity
and individual responsibility upon
which a university should rest.
Students are encouraged, when
they enter this University, to con
sider themselves responsible
adults; entrusted with their own
futures; allowed to choose their
courses and careers; privileged to
study when and if they please;
encouraged to confront philosoph
ical and political conflict; and, in
particular, challenged to conduct
themselves by an Honor Code
and a Fundamental Standard.
THE FUNDAMENTAL Stand
ard says of itself; “This is the
concept of personal honor, based
on the principles of integrity,
common sense, and respect for
civil law which we students bring
with us to Stanford. ... In fol
lowing the principles of the Fun
demental Standard, the student
first of all acquires a sense of
responsibility and citizenship, as
well as moral growth.”
But under the section titled
‘Fundamental Standard in Prac
tice’ we find that “University
rules and traditions prohibit pos
session of any intoxicating liq
uors.” But we also find that the
“question of drinking is a per
sonal matter.” This is a definite
contradiction.
THE PRESENT RULE was
made long ago by the Board of
Trustees and is found today in
the By-laws of the Associated
Students. It is not included in*
the Will or the Founding Grant.
Furthermore, the rule as it now
stands is not a requirement of
state law. The Stanford regula
tion makes no differentiation as
to legal age requirements or to
the mode of use or misuse of liq
uor.
What have been the conse
quences of this rule? The rule is
obviously unenforceable. It is safe
to say that a majority of stu
dents, during their four years
here, have engaged in some form
of disobedience. These students
are generally law-abiding. But
they properly resent this incur
sion upon their privacy.
SECOND, the records of The
Daily indicate that several acci
dents and deaths have resulted
from drinking which is done at
off-campus parties. It is not un
likely that had the rule been abol
ished and these parties held on
campus, these mishaps would
have been avoided.
Drinking, per se, can be noth
ing but a personal matter.

I We recognize the responsibility
| of students to regulate and pun
j ish “disturbance of order and
! privacy and destruction of prop
i erty.” But we vigorously reject
j the assumption that students can
j not control themselves when al
lowed freedom of choice.
WITHIN THE bounds of free
j dom stated above the liquor regu
[ lation has no place. While it re
mains, who among us can view
I seriously all other protestations
jof confidence in student compe
tence? Therefore we propose that
the Student Association By-Laws,
Article I. Section iiiß. be amended
to read as follows:
; The possession, transportation,
j or use of intoxicating liquors
by Stanford students in the
University community shall be
in accordance with State Law,
and no judicial counsel of the
University shall punish a stu
dent for possession, transpor
tation, or use of intoxicating

has not been violated.

to legal age requirements or to
the mode of use or misuse of liq
uor.
What have been the conse
quences of this rule? The rule is
obviously unenforceable. It is safe
to say that a majority of stu
dents, during their four years
here, have engaged in some form
of disobedience. These students
are generally law-abiding. But
they properly resent this incur
sion upon their privacy.
SECOND, the records of The
Daily indicate that several acci
dents and deaths have resulted
from drinking which is done at
off-campus parties. It is not un
likely that had the rule been abol
ished and these parties held on
campus, these mishaps would
have been avoided.
Drinking, per se, can be noth
ing but a personal matter.

I We recognize the responsibility
| of students to regulate and pun
j ish “disturbance of order and
! privacy and destruction of prop
i erty.” But we vigorously reject
j the assumption that students can
j not control themselves when al
lowed freedom of choice.
WITHIN THE bounds of free
j dom stated above the liquor regu
[ lation has no place. While it re
mains, who among us can view
I seriously all other protestations
jof confidence in student compe
tence? Therefore we propose that
the Student Association By-Laws,
Article I. Section iiiß. be amended
to read as follows:
; The possession, transportation,
j or use of intoxicating liquors
by Stanford students in the
University community shall be
in accordance with State Law,
and no judicial counsel of the
University shall punish a stu
dent for possession, transpor
tation, or use of intoxicating
liquors where the State Law
has not been violated.
WE HAVE submitted a petition
for a student referendum on this
proposed amendment. Under the
i ASSU By-Laws, unless this peti
! tion is rejected by the Legislature
Within 15 days, a referendum
| must be held. We ask all students
I whose views are similar to ours
j to urge strongly their Legislature
! representatives to allow the stu
dent body to vote on this issue.
We also call upon students and
; faculty to declare their agreement
by adding their names to this
resolution. A copy will be on En
gineering Corner for the next two
days.

LIQUOR
Editor, The Daily:
We believe that Stanford Uni
versity maintains a liquor policy
which is both unrealistic and con
trary to the concept of dignity
and individual responsibility upon
which a university should rest.
Students are encouraged, when
they enter this University, to con
sider themselves responsible
adults; entrusted with their own
futures; allowed to choose their
courses and careers; privileged to
study when and if they please;
encouraged to confront philosoph
ical and political conflict; and, in
particular, challenged to conduct
themselves by an Honor Code
and a Fundamental Standard.
THE FUNDAMENTAL Stand
ard says of itself; “This is the
concept of personal honor, based
on the principles of integrity,
common sense, and respect for
civil law which we students bring
with us to Stanford. ... In fol
lowing the principles of the Fun
demental Standard, the student
first of all acquires a sense of
responsibility and citizenship, as
well as moral growth.”
But under the section titled
‘Fundamental Standard in Prac
tice’ we find that “University
rules and traditions prohibit pos
session of any intoxicating liq
uors.” But we also find that the
“question of drinking is a per
sonal matter.” This is a definite
contradiction.
THE PRESENT RULE was
made long ago by the Board of
Trustees and is found today in
the By-laws of the Associated
Students. It is not included in*
the Will or the Founding Grant.
Furthermore, the rule as it now
stands is not a requirement of
state law. The Stanford regula
tion makes no differentiation as
to legal age requirements or to
the mode of use or misuse of liq
uor.
