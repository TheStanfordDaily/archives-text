THE DESIGN
Editor, The Daily:
On the surface Dean Winbig
let's stand that Forum should be
incorporated in the Political Un
| ion might appear desirable from
j an administrative point of view.
Actually such a move is designed
: to kill Forum.

The Political Union is control
led by an â€œin clique" of under
graduates. redhots all the way,
and is riddled with student poli
tics stemming from a few frater
nities. To ask Forum (o try to
join forces with this group would
put an unbearable burden on its
officers like grad student Cohen.

The officers of Forum are nol
racing to the White House, keep
their partisan political views out
of the picture, and think on a
level incomprehensible to many
Political Union members.
Harvard is a long way off.
