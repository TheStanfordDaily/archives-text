SAYLER
Editor, The Daily:
Ilene Strelitz’s article in yes
terday’s issue of The Daily has
raised more issues than it has
solved. I should clarify the posi
tion of the Associated Students.
1) WE SYMPATHIZE with the
reluctance of the Forum for the
Discussion of Non-Violent Alter
natives to War to affiliate with
the Political Union.
The Forum is not analogous to
the conservative or the Socialist
Caucus. It is not, according to the
definition of the LASSU, a par
tisan group. While it concerns
itself witli an important issue of
the day, it does not necessarily
follow that the group is therefore
partisan.
War and the alternatives there
of according to the constitution
of the group, are to be discussed
from every angle and by all sides.
If, in fact, it becomes apparent
that the Forum is not airing all
views impartially, Legislature
should and will intervene.
2) THE UNIVERSITY is not
“jeopardized” by the Forum; the
ASSU and Public Exercises Com
mittee retain their veto over
speakers. Stanford is dedicated to
the principle that free discussion
of all ideas- even bad ones—is es
sential to the educational process.
The Forum is simply an attempt
to instigate thought and bring
more ideas to the campus. In this,
it well serves the educational
ideal, and fits into the scheme of
things at a University. Permitting
the Forum to sponsor guests can
do no harm: yet it can serve a
useful purpose. We should have
it.
3) NO DOUBT there was poor
communication between the As
sociated Students and the Admin
istration; to the extent that we
were responsible, an apology is
intended. I am confident that, this
clarification having been made,
the administration will conclude
that the LASSU should properly
decide (a) which student groups
are partisan, and (b) which ASSU
agencies “infringe” upon other
agencies. If these decisions are
not legitimately within the baili
wick of final LASSU power, then
very little is.
Bob Sayler
ASSU President
AND McBAINE
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to attempt to clari
fy the present controversy over
the Forum for the Discussion of

Non-Violent Alternatives to War.
When the group presented its
original constitution (under the
name of Non-Violent Action for
Peace, I opposed it on the grounds
that:
1. IT conflicted with University
policy in that no partisan action
group may be organized on the
campus and
2. It conflicted with the ASSU
by-laws in that it would infringe
upon the rights of Political Union
and the Institute of International
Relations.
My remarks on that occasion
represented my own views as
Chairman of the Legislature’s
By-Laws and Rules Committee. I
informed Dan Cohen that I would
be glad to meet with him and
work out a more acceptable con
stitution, which would then he re
introduced to the Legislature.
SUBSEQUENTLY, a number of
things happened which must be
viewed chronologically in order
to understand the present con
fusion.
First, Bob Sayler and I had a
private (now public) disagree
ment as to the advisability of
chartering the group. It was my
feeling at the time that the group
should be handled in the same
manner as was the Young Ameri
cans For Freedom. However, I
was obviously under an obliga
tion to support Bob’s position on
the matter.
My greatest mistake was in not
fully supporting Bob’s position in
my private conversations with
Dean Winbigler. I firmly believed
that the members of Legislature
would, by their own accord, and
without any guidance from the
student “administration,” refuse
to allow this group to bring
speakers to the campus.
IN MY TALKS with the Dean,
which were all held before the
eventual passage of the constitu
tion, I indicated to him that the
constitution would include the re
strictions he desired. This was my
unofficial and personal opinion.
When I finally met with Dan
Cohen, I adopted Bob’s official
position of not outlawing public
speakers and waiting to see what
the Legislature would say.
The Legislature made its deci
sion—based, I believe, on all the
available information.
IT NOW seems that the Legis
lature must re-examine this situ
ation and if it reaches the same
conclusion, fight to uphold it.
Once again, may I point up
what I consider to be one of the
major causes of the present con
fusion: the dichotomy between
by official and unofficial posi
tions.

■ ASSU Administrative Asst.
AGAINST MEDICARE BILL
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the Board of
Governors of the Stanford Alum
ni Medical Association, I was in
vited to the Student Medical Con
ference held at Stanford on Fri
day, April 6, 1962.
On the desk as we registered
was a copy of The Stanford Daily,
and on an inside page was a
large spread to the effect that
Doan Alway of the Medical
School, along with other doctors,
had endorsed President Kennedy’s
Medicare Bill tying medical care
for the aged to our Social Securi
ty System.
I WOULD like to point out to
you and other readers of The
Daily a few facts that may not be
generally well understood. In the
first place, the matter of Medi
care Bills in Congress has become
largely a matter of emotions.
What is being “batted” about in
Washington at the present itmo
is largely the matter of how it
will be financed. It is really that
simple. The doctors of this coun
try want the people who need
medical care to be taken care of,
and what is generally not known
at the present time is that we do
have a Medicare plan in effect
and it is operating in several
states—nine, I believe, California
included.

Under this plan anybody who
needs medical care can apply for

it and be taken care of. This is
provided for under the Kerr-Mills
Bill which allows the individual
states to operate in any manner
that the state feels fit. In contrast
under the King-Anderson Bill,
which ties medical care to Social
Security, hospitalization would
be provided to all people, 65 and
over, who are entitled to Social
Security with no relation to finan
cial need.
ISN’T IT silly to think that
medical care would be paid for
even though the people them
selves are wealthy and able to
take care of their own medical
needs? In England at the present
time the Medicare budget is ap
proximately that of national de
fense and has caused severe
treasury deficits.
I would urge all of you who are
interested to read the King-An
derson Bill, and you will readily
find out that this could lead to
the same type of thing in the
United States.
In summary, I would like to
point out again that the doctors
of the United States are interest
ed in the health and welfare of
the older people and that we do
have a medical assistance bill for
the aged. Again I would call to
your attention the dangers of the
King-Anderson Bill, which pro
vides medical care under Social
Security regardless of need.

WATERSKIING
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to commend to the at
tention of the readers of The
Daily a voluntary and selfless ac
tivity by a half-dozen of their fel
low students last week, namely
the sacrifice of an afternoon to
practice water-skiing on Lake
Lagunita. The occasion for this
letter is to quiet the grumbling
of those surly few among the 100
or so swimmers and canoers rele
gated to the shore who com
menced ungratefully to mutter
among themselves and refer to
the rules for the use of the lake
published in The Daily of April
4. in particular to No. 11: “Power
boats of any description are for
bidden on Lake Lagunita.”
I am sure that I speak for the
majority of those present when I
say that I was glad to do my
small part by sitting on the dock.
In fact, I was grateful for an op
portunity to observe their admir
able appearance: lithe athletic
forms, brown faces calmly ex
pressionless, and above all a nau
tical air.
Hopefully the performance will
be repeated soon for those unfor
tunates who chanced not to be
present.
