# Surgeons Perfect Heart Operation
## 
### 
Four Stanford surgeons have
reported that they have removed
dog’s heart for up to two hours,
then replaced them without ap
parent harm to the animals. This
is the first time such experiments
have been performed successfully.
The surgeons say their tech
nique may be the first step to
ward operations in which a pa
tient’s heart is cut out of his body
in order to correct serious heart

defects.
A report on the new develop
ment is to be presented today in
St. Louis at the annual meeting
of the American Thoracic Society
by Dr. Edward J. Hurley, a post
doctoral research fellow at the
Stanford University School of
Medicine. Co-authors of the re
port are Eugene Dong, Jr., also a
postdoctoral research fellow, Dr.
Richard Lower, a surgical resi
dent, and Dr. Norman E. Shum
way, associate professor of sur
gery.
THE PROCEDURE might be
used in the next few years to
treat a condition known as trans
position of the great vessels, one
of the common causes of “blue
babies.” At present there is no
satisfactory operation for the ail
ment, in which the vessels carry
ing blood from the heart to the
lungs and body are reversed.
The Stanford doctors believe
that a large number- of the 15,000
babies born each year in this
country with inoperable heart
conditions might be helped.
So far the experiments have
been successfully carried out on
four dogs which are still alive
from five to nine months after
the operations. Careful studies
show that there is no important
damage to the heart’s function.
The new technique involves
leaving part of the heart in place
instead of cutting off each vessel
separately. This section receives
all the veins leading to the heart.
With older methods, each vein
had to be sewn together individu
ally.
WHILE THE HEART is out of
the dog’s body, it is kept in a
cold salt solution. The dog is kept
alive by a heart-lung machine.
Dr. Hurley said that experi
ments have shown that hearts
kept outside the body for as long
as seven hours would still func
tion normally. But the heart-lung
machine causes chemical changes
in the dog’s blood and cannot be
used that long.
