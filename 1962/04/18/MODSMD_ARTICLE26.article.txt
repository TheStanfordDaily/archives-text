Here and there in Stanford sports.
The Stanford track team lost to Oregon, but won the admiration
of Stanford track fans. The Oregon Webfoots aren’t a track team,
but a machine.
CHURNING OUT wins with monotonous regularity in the
sprints, hurdles and distance races, Oregon won an easy 90-41 vic
tory. Stanford could get only five points out of thirty possible in
what are supposed to he its strongest running events, the 880, mile
and two-mile.
Oregon power in these events in shown by Card Harry McCalla’s
fine two-mile lime of 8:58.3, third

best in the nation this year, but
good only for second place. Ore
gon’s Keith Forman ran the sec
ond best two-mile in the nation in
the same race.
THE FINE Indian perform
ance's led San Francisco Examiner
writer Bob Brachman to call the
Indians the fourth best track
team in the nation.
Who Iho top three are, Brach
man left to the imagination, but
the lop two must be Oregon and
USC. A good bet for the third
would be San Jose Stale, a team
that edged Stanford by five
points in a triangular meel earlier
l his year.
Stanford’s continued improve
ments lead this writer to believe
that Stanford will finish in the
top five in the NCAA finals.
OF AEE THOSE improving
Cards. McCalla has moved along

fastest. In fact, Coach Payton Jordan said that in any future race
between McCalla and Forman, he expects that McCalla would win.
McCalla and Forman most certainly will meet in the NCAA
track championships.

Last year, the California Bears had what was termed the finest
freshman football team in the school’s history. These youngsters
were hailed as the white knights who would bring the Bears out of
football's wilderness into the ranks of the nation’s powerhouses.
TIIK TARNISH IS beginning to show on the armor of these
white knights.
Two first-stringers from that team have had to leave school
because of scholastic difficulties, and five more may follow shortly.
It looks like another long year in Berkeley.

About Stanford's new assistant baseball coach. Bob Bolingbroke.
COACH ItOMNdHROKK WAS one of three great pitchers who
comprised the pitching staff of the Billings. Montana learn that com
peted in the 1953 American Legion playoffs.
He was a hero in the Billings team's second place finish in the
northern regional playoffs.
Bolingbroke was a secondary hero in what was one of the
greatest baseball games played anywhere, between Billings and
Lewiston, Idaho in the 1955 playoffs.
HF WAS MATCHED against Sam Canner. a right-handed pitcher
for Lewiston who had lost only one high school baseball game in his
life and was named one of the top five American Legion players in
the nation that year.
Bolingbroke and Canner matched goose eggs for 15 scoreless
frames, but at the end of 15, Bolingbroke was exhausted, and another
Billings pitcher, Dick Montee, entered the game. In his stint. Boling
broke had struck out 25.
NOW M.ONTKK AND CANNKR dueled, pitching scoreless base
ball. Canner also struck out a few and by the 19lh inning, had sent
down 24 men on strikes. Montee struck out eight in his four innings.
In the l9lh, Canner lost the game on an error by his shortstop
with a man on third and two out. He had pitched IS 2 a innings, given
up one unearned run, and lost the game.
BOI.INCBKOKK AND MONTKK had combined to hurl 19 score
less innings, with 33 strikeouts.
Bolingbroke went on to Washington State, where he, Montee,
and Elwood Hahn pitched the Cougars to two out of three Northern
Division baseball titles while they were at Washington State.
