# Lecturer Says Court Decision Hits Rural Areas

### CAROLE CRAYNE 
A big change in America's now
agriculturally - oriented politics
can bo expected from the U.S.
Supreme Court’s recent Tennes
see reapportionment decision,
Washington newswoman Helen
Hill Miller predicted last night.
Representation today is orient
ed toward the population and in
terests of 1900, which have
changed a lot in 60 years. Mrs.
Miller said. An impact can be ex
pected from the Tennessee case
as big as the Supreme Court
school segregation decision, Mrs.
Miller told a Dinkelspiel audience
in her backstage view of Wash
ington politics.
MRS. MILLER called present
apportionment an "extremely
able method of disfranchising ur
ban dwellers.” Almost one-third
of slate constitutions say the leg
islature must reapportion regu
larly but in about half of these
slates nothing has happened for
at least a generation, she said.
Courts will bo reluctant to
carry out redistricting them
selves. but their pressure should
make legislatures do the job, Mrs.
Miller said.
A COMPROMISE of state leg
islative representation by geog
raphy in the upper house and
population in lower house like the
federal system may result, she
suggested.
Commenting on the steel price
dispute, Mrs. Miller said middle
of-the-road Democratic and Re
publican groupings will change
to divisions more to the left or
right.
She said the medical-care-to-the
aged bill was an example of legis
lation that couldn’t pass because
of rural-dominated politics.
But she sees a tendency for
Democrats to close ranks after
the steel price dispute which
might give the medical bill a
chance.
