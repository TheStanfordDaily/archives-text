constitution, four students have
declined candidacy in ASSU elec

presidency; Judy Webb, as Class
of ’(l2 vice presidential candidate;
Phil Weaver, as candidate for
LASSU off-campus representa
tive; and Phyl Jay DeWolf, as
candidate for Class of ’65 LASSU
Representative, have withdrawn.
Since no one petitioned as can
didate for Florence Moore or
Women’s Row representative, and
only one applied as Stern repre

Three new names have been
added to the list of those running
for campus offices. Peggy Rust,

and Chuck Rigg, as Vice Presi
dent, Class of ’65 will appear on
the ballots. Their petitions were

Robb Royse has been accepted
as a candidate for ASSU presi
dency. According to Melinda
Gartzman, ASSU Elections Com
mission Chairman, “Robb had not
planned to file for nomination
until yesterday, which he be
lieved to be the deadline for fil
ing nominations, duo to the incor
rect information printed in last
Friday’s Daily.
“Because the information was
incorrect, and the Daily was, until
the candidates’ meeting last night,
the only source of information for
the prospective candidates, the
Elections Commission fell that
wo had no choice but to let Royse
file his nomination.”
Ballots will be cast at the pri
maries April 25 and 26 by voting
machines, Melinda said. Through
out this week and the beginning
