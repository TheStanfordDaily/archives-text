CRAM COURSE NO. 2: BIOLOGY
The grisly shadow of final exams looms over us, so today in
this column instead of merry quips and homely saws, you will
find hard facts—quick cram courses to help you through the
ordeal ahead.
Last week I gave you a rapid survey of Modern European
History. Now let us turn to Biology.
Biology is divided into several phyla, or classes. First is
the protozoa, or one-celled animal. All life stems from the one
celled animal. Over a space of millions of years, life slowly
evolved until today we have animals with as many as 12 cells.
Some larger mammals claim they have 14 to Hi cells, hut you
know how larger mammals lie.
The second class of animals is the periphera—a shadowy
category that borders often on the vegetable. Take, for example,
the sponge. The sponge is definitely an animal. The washcloth,
on the other hand, is definitely not.
Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most jxaiplc,
of course, find insects fairly repulsive—and yet, if one will buj
look, there is exquisite beauty in the insect world. Who does
not remember the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos—such enchanting lyrics as Tumbling Along with the
Tumbling Tnmblebug, Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid, and Gnats My
Mother Taught Me. Mr. Sigafoos has heen inactive since the
invention of DDT.
Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generally found under rocky projections
on the ocean bottom. Shrimp are generally found in a circle
around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce. Marlboro Cig
arettes are generally found at any tobacco counter or vending
machine.
What have Marlboro Cigarettes got to do with biology?
Well, actually, not very much. It must be remembered, how
ever, that the makers of Marlboro pay me for writing this
column, and they are inclined to get surly if I fail to mention
their product.
Mind you, I enjoy singing the praises of Marlboro—and
so will you once you try that flavorful tobacco, that fine filter
which lets the flavor come through undiminished. It is a great
pleasure to smoke Marlboros and a great pleasure to write
about them, but sometimes, I must confess, I find it a hit
difficult to work the commercial into the column. Some years
ago, for example, I did a piece about Alexander the Great,
and, believe you me, it took a heap of stretching to drop in
a plug for Marlboro. The way I finally managed it was to have
Alexander go to the Oracle at Delphi and say, “Oracle, J have
conquered the world and tasted all its pleasures, but somehow
1 am not content. I know that somewhere there must he a
joy I have not yet experienced.” To which the Oracle replied,
w

“Yes, Alexander, there is such a joy, but, alas, the time is not
yet. I refer to Marlboro Cigarettes which will not be invented
for another 2500 years.” Whereupon Alexander fell into a sulk
from which he never recovered ... Well sir, there is no question
I sold a lot of cigarettes with this ingenious commercial, hut
the gang down at the American Academy of Arts and letters
gave me a mighty good razzing, you may be sure.
But I digress. Back to biology, and the most advanced
phylum of all—the chordata, or vertebrates. There are two
kinds of vertebrates—those whose backbones run horizontally
and those whose backbones run vertically. Generally, there is
no great difficulty in distinguishing the two varieties. A fish,
for instance, has a horizontal backbone, and a man has a vertical
backbone. Occasionally, however, you run into a problem like
a fish who swims upright and a man who spends most of his
time in the sack. How, in such a case, do you tell one from
another? Science struggled with this sticky question for cen
turies, but finally Sigafoos of M.I.T. came up with a brilliantly
simple answer. Offer the creature a Marlboro. If it is a fish, it will
refuse. If it is Homo sapiens, it will accept. In fact, the more
sapient, the quicker the acceptance.
The makers of Marlboro, upright vertebrates all, remind
you that their tine cigarettes arc available in pack or l>ox
wherever cigarettes are sold in any of the HO slates.

Some larger mammals claim they have 14 to Hi cells, hut you
know how larger mammals lie.
The second class of animals is the periphera—a shadowy
category that borders often on the vegetable. Take, for example,
the sponge. The sponge is definitely an animal. The washcloth,
on the other hand, is definitely not.
Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most jxaiplc,
of course, find insects fairly repulsive—and yet, if one will buj
look, there is exquisite beauty in the insect world. Who does
not remember the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos—such enchanting lyrics as Tumbling Along with the
Tumbling Tnmblebug, Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid, and Gnats My
Mother Taught Me. Mr. Sigafoos has heen inactive since the
invention of DDT.
Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generally found under rocky projections
on the ocean bottom. Shrimp are generally found in a circle
around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce. Marlboro Cig
arettes are generally found at any tobacco counter or vending
machine.
What have Marlboro Cigarettes got to do with biology?
Well, actually, not very much. It must be remembered, how
ever, that the makers of Marlboro pay me for writing this
column, and they are inclined to get surly if I fail to mention
their product.
Mind you, I enjoy singing the praises of Marlboro—and
so will you once you try that flavorful tobacco, that fine filter
which lets the flavor come through undiminished. It is a great
pleasure to smoke Marlboros and a great pleasure to write
about them, but sometimes, I must confess, I find it a hit
difficult to work the commercial into the column. Some years
ago, for example, I did a piece about Alexander the Great,
and, believe you me, it took a heap of stretching to drop in
a plug for Marlboro. The way I finally managed it was to have
Alexander go to the Oracle at Delphi and say, “Oracle, J have
conquered the world and tasted all its pleasures, but somehow
1 am not content. I know that somewhere there must he a
joy I have not yet experienced.” To which the Oracle replied,

“Yes, Alexander, there is such a joy, but, alas, the time is not

for another 2500 years.” Whereupon Alexander fell into a sulk
from which he never recovered ... Well sir, there is no question
I sold a lot of cigarettes with this ingenious commercial, hut
the gang down at the American Academy of Arts and letters
gave me a mighty good razzing, you may be sure.
But I digress. Back to biology, and the most advanced
phylum of all—the chordata, or vertebrates. There are two
kinds of vertebrates—those whose backbones run horizontally
and those whose backbones run vertically. Generally, there is
no great difficulty in distinguishing the two varieties. A fish,
for instance, has a horizontal backbone, and a man has a vertical
backbone. Occasionally, however, you run into a problem like
a fish who swims upright and a man who spends most of his
time in the sack. How, in such a case, do you tell one from
another? Science struggled with this sticky question for cen
turies, but finally Sigafoos of M.I.T. came up with a brilliantly
simple answer. Offer the creature a Marlboro. If it is a fish, it will
refuse. If it is Homo sapiens, it will accept. In fact, the more
sapient, the quicker the acceptance.
The makers of Marlboro, upright vertebrates all, remind
you that their tine cigarettes arc available in pack or l>ox
wherever cigarettes are sold in any of the HO slates.

CRAM COURSE NO. 2: BIOLOGY
The grisly shadow of final exams looms over us, so today in
this column instead of merry quips and homely saws, you will
find hard facts—quick cram courses to help you through the
ordeal ahead.
Last week I gave you a rapid survey of Modern European
History. Now let us turn to Biology.
Biology is divided into several phyla, or classes. First is
the protozoa, or one-celled animal. All life stems from the one
celled animal. Over a space of millions of years, life slowly
evolved until today we have animals with as many as 12 cells.

Mother Taught Me. Mr. Sigafoos has heen inactive since the
invention of DDT.
Our next category is the mollusca—lobsters, shrimp, and
the like. Lobsters are generally found under rocky projections
on the ocean bottom. Shrimp are generally found in a circle
around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce. Marlboro Cig
arettes are generally found at any tobacco counter or vending
machine.
What have Marlboro Cigarettes got to do with biology?
Well, actually, not very much. It must be remembered, how
ever, that the makers of Marlboro pay me for writing this
column, and they are inclined to get surly if I fail to mention
their product.
Mind you, I enjoy singing the praises of Marlboro—and
so will you once you try that flavorful tobacco, that fine filter
which lets the flavor come through undiminished. It is a great
pleasure to smoke Marlboros and a great pleasure to write
about them, but sometimes, I must confess, I find it a hit
difficult to work the commercial into the column. Some years
ago, for example, I did a piece about Alexander the Great,
and, believe you me, it took a heap of stretching to drop in
a plug for Marlboro. The way I finally managed it was to have
Alexander go to the Oracle at Delphi and say, “Oracle, J have
conquered the world and tasted all its pleasures, but somehow
1 am not content. I know that somewhere there must he a
joy I have not yet experienced.” To which the Oracle replied,

“Yes, Alexander, there is such a joy, but, alas, the time is not
yet. I refer to Marlboro Cigarettes which will not be invented
for another 2500 years.” Whereupon Alexander fell into a sulk
from which he never recovered ... Well sir, there is no question
I sold a lot of cigarettes with this ingenious commercial, hut
the gang down at the American Academy of Arts and letters
gave me a mighty good razzing, you may be sure.
But I digress. Back to biology, and the most advanced
phylum of all—the chordata, or vertebrates. There are two
kinds of vertebrates—those whose backbones run horizontally
and those whose backbones run vertically. Generally, there is
no great difficulty in distinguishing the two varieties. A fish,
for instance, has a horizontal backbone, and a man has a vertical
backbone. Occasionally, however, you run into a problem like
a fish who swims upright and a man who spends most of his
time in the sack. How, in such a case, do you tell one from
another? Science struggled with this sticky question for cen
turies, but finally Sigafoos of M.I.T. came up with a brilliantly
simple answer. Offer the creature a Marlboro. If it is a fish, it will
refuse. If it is Homo sapiens, it will accept. In fact, the more
sapient, the quicker the acceptance.
The makers of Marlboro, upright vertebrates all, remind
you that their tine cigarettes arc available in pack or l>ox
wherever cigarettes are sold in any of the HO slates.

CRAM COURSE NO. 2: BIOLOGY
The grisly shadow of final exams looms over us, so today in
this column instead of merry quips and homely saws, you will
find hard facts—quick cram courses to help you through the
ordeal ahead.
Last week I gave you a rapid survey of Modern European
History. Now let us turn to Biology.
Biology is divided into several phyla, or classes. First is
the protozoa, or one-celled animal. All life stems from the one
celled animal. Over a space of millions of years, life slowly
evolved until today we have animals with as many as 12 cells.
Some larger mammals claim they have 14 to Hi cells, hut you
know how larger mammals lie.
The second class of animals is the periphera—a shadowy
category that borders often on the vegetable. Take, for example,
the sponge. The sponge is definitely an animal. The washcloth,
on the other hand, is definitely not.
Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most jxaiplc,
of course, find insects fairly repulsive—and yet, if one will buj
look, there is exquisite beauty in the insect world. Who does
not remember the lovely insect poems of William Cullen
Sigafoos—such enchanting lyrics as Tumbling Along with the
Tumbling Tnmblebug, Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid, and Gnats My
Mother Taught Me. Mr. Sigafoos has heen inactive since the
invention of DDT.
