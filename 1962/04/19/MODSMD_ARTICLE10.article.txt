# ’Liquor Petition’ Has Over 1000 Names, To Go To LASSU
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
Over 675 students signed the “liquor petition” yesterday, bring
ing the total to approximately 1200 (522 students signed the peti
tion over the weekend when it was circulated in several living
groups.) Students who wish to sign can do so today at Engineer
ing Corner. The petition, which needs only approximately 500

signatures to be "official,” will be
submitted to Legislature tonight.
It asks Legislature to permit a
student referendum which, if
passed, would amend the ASSU
By-Laws to read that "possession,
transportation, or use of intoxi
cating liquors by Stanford stu
dents in the University communi
ty shall be in accordance with
State Law.”

LEGISLATURE probably will
not vote on the referendum re
quest tonight, but will submit it
to the by-laws committee for a
first reading. A simple majority
vote by LASSU next week will
put the referendum on the May 2
ballot. The by-law could be
changed without a referendum if
LASSU approves the requested
amendment by a three-fourths
majority.
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler is studying the pro
posed change and will make a for
mal statement in tomorrow’s
Daily.
The University policy states
that all students, regardless of
age, are prohibited from consum
ing alcoholic beverages on cam
pus. If LASSU approves the hold
ing of a referendum, and if the
referendum passes, persons over
21 years of age will be able to
purchase, consume, and transport
alcoholic beverages on campus
and not be subject to Student
Body action.
THE STATE Law is explicit
concerning the rights of minors.
Possession and consumption in a
private place (Stanford is con
sidered a private place) by a mi
nor is not a violation of state law.
However, the purchase of alco
holic beverages by a minor, or the
consumption of alcoholic bever
ages in a tavern or bar is punish
able.

In addition, any person who
sells, furnishes, gives, or causes
to be sold, furnished, or given
away, any alcoholic beverage to
a minor is guilty of a misdemea
nor.

Basically, then, minors are sub
ject to legal action only if they
purchase liquor themselves or if
they consume it in a public place.
Stanford is not a public place, but
possession implies purchase and
that IS punishable under state
law.
ASSUMING that the referen
dum is passed, there are two ways
misdemeanors (e.g. disturbing the
peace) could be handled. Since
Stanford would be complying with
state law, state law enforcement
agencies would have the right to
come on campus to apprehend
and try the guilty person or per
sons.

The University, however, could
handle misdemeanors on its ov/n,
probably through Judicial Coun
cil.
Joel Moister, one of the initi
ators of the proposed change,
says the amendment is concerned
with drinking and not any unde
sirable public effects. “On the
other hand, a student who is dis
turbing the peace is certainly sub
ject to Stanford’s normal regula
tions governing conduct," Meister
states.
“However,” Meister stresses, “it
must be kept in mind that such a
student is subject to these regula
tions not because he is drunk but
because he is disturbing the
peace.”

LEADERS OF the proposed
change claim they are well aware
of possible difficulties arising
from a more lenient liquor policy.
They hope students will realize
that if the by-law is amended, stu
dents will be expected to act ma
turely and responsibly.
In any case, Meister says, the
leaders of the movement arc con
vinced that some action is neces
sary since the present University
policy is unenforceable in prac
tice.

THE STATE Law is explicit
concerning the rights of minors.
Possession and consumption in a
private place (Stanford is con
sidered a private place) by a mi
nor is not a violation of state law.
However, the purchase of alco
holic beverages by a minor, or the
consumption of alcoholic bever
ages in a tavern or bar is punish
able.

In addition, any person who
sells, furnishes, gives, or causes
to be sold, furnished, or given
away, any alcoholic beverage to
a minor is guilty of a misdemea
nor.

Basically, then, minors are sub
ject to legal action only if they
purchase liquor themselves or if
they consume it in a public place.
Stanford is not a public place, but
possession implies purchase and
that IS punishable under state
law.
ASSUMING that the referen
dum is passed, there are two ways
misdemeanors (e.g. disturbing the
peace) could be handled. Since
Stanford would be complying with
state law, state law enforcement
agencies would have the right to
come on campus to apprehend
and try the guilty person or per
sons.

The University, however, could
handle misdemeanors on its ov/n,
probably through Judicial Coun
cil.
Joel Moister, one of the initi
ators of the proposed change,
says the amendment is concerned
with drinking and not any unde
sirable public effects. “On the
other hand, a student who is dis
turbing the peace is certainly sub
ject to Stanford’s normal regula
tions governing conduct," Meister
states.
“However,” Meister stresses, “it
must be kept in mind that such a
student is subject to these regula
tions not because he is drunk but
because he is disturbing the
peace.”

LEADERS OF the proposed
change claim they are well aware
of possible difficulties arising
from a more lenient liquor policy.
They hope students will realize
that if the by-law is amended, stu
dents will be expected to act ma
turely and responsibly.
In any case, Meister says, the
leaders of the movement arc con
vinced that some action is neces
sary since the present University
policy is unenforceable in prac
tice.
Over 675 students signed the “liquor petition” yesterday, bring
ing the total to approximately 1200 (522 students signed the peti
tion over the weekend when it was circulated in several living
groups.) Students who wish to sign can do so today at Engineer
ing Corner. The petition, which needs only approximately 500

signatures to be "official,” will be
submitted to Legislature tonight.
It asks Legislature to permit a
student referendum which, if
passed, would amend the ASSU
By-Laws to read that "possession,
transportation, or use of intoxi
cating liquors by Stanford stu
dents in the University communi
ty shall be in accordance with
State Law.”

LEGISLATURE probably will
not vote on the referendum re
quest tonight, but will submit it
to the by-laws committee for a
first reading. A simple majority
vote by LASSU next week will
put the referendum on the May 2
ballot. The by-law could be
changed without a referendum if
LASSU approves the requested
amendment by a three-fourths
majority.

Winbigler is studying the pro
