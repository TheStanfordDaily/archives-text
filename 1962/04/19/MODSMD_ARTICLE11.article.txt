# LASSU Agenda Long Tonight
## 
### 
Liquor at Stanford, the defeated
ASSU constitution, and the Ad
ministration’s dechartering of the
Forum for Discussion of Non-
Violent Alternatives to War will
be considered by LASSU tonight.
The move to change campus
liquor rules is covered elsewhere
on this page. The proposed amend
ment will be given its first read
ing tonight.
ASSU President Bob Sayler
will make announcements about
the defeated ASSU Constitution
and the revoking of the Forum’s
charter.

Sayler has said that the charter
revoking was due to poor com
munication between ASSU and
the Administration. "To the ex
tent that we were responsible, an
apology is offered,” Saylor said,
but he added that he felt this was
a legitimate area of ASSU au
thority.
The “Forum for Peace through
Victory over Communism” will
ask to have its name changed to
“Forum for American Strategy.”
LASSU will also vote on ap
proving the new Stu-Fac Board
Co-Chairmen, Poll Union officers,
and Foreign Scholarship Commit
tee Co-Chairmen; and it will con
sider a summer salary for the
Student Financial Manager.
