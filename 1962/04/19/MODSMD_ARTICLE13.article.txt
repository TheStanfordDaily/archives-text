# 'Underdog Psychology' Rules Farm Fraternities
## 
### JOCK McBAINE 
On Monday night the Interfra
ternity Council decided to oppose
the proposed ASSU Constitution
and on Tuesday that constitution
fell before a majority vote of the
14 per cent of the student body
which voted. Neglecting for the
present the argument that the
students did not have enough
time to study the proposals and,
therefore, either 1 voted in the neg
ative or abstained, I should like
to consider the implications of the
stand taken by the Interfraternity
Council.
It is my understanding that the
IFC’s objections to the proposed
constitution were; (1) that it gen
erally weakened the position of
the council with particular re
spect to the position of the stu
dent legislature, and (2) that it
defined the responsibilities of the
Interfraternity Judicial Council in
such away as to seriously threat
en the fraternity system at Stan
ford.
I WOULD ONLY point out, by
way of answering these objec
tions, that the present constitu
tion of the Associated Students
contains the “legislative suprem
acy’’ clause which was the basis
of the first objection, that the pro
posed legislature would have been
roughly one-sixth fraternity
spokesmen (rather than the pres
ent 1/13), that the proposed ju
dicial system would still have al
lowed the fraternities to indulge
in cleaning one’s own house, and
that the proposed judicial system
was undeniably a more legally
equitable one than that which now
governs.
Greater than my concern for
this immediate issue, however, is
my concern over the underdog
psychology which seems to crawl
through the minds of many fra

ternity leaders and members.
Change is equated with danger
and the fraternity system meets
every serious issue by displaying
a rather ironic lack of self confi
dence with which fraternities ap
proach social and athletic en
deavor - and because I believe
that the fraternity system has
the potential to take the lead in
other areas.
The situation has recently de
generated to the point where the
Faculty Advisor to the fraternity
system, Prof. James J. Watkins
IV, has used his class period to
call the proposed constitution
“corrupt’ and to imply that the I
student body was being dictated |
to by Bob Sayler and other par-1
ticipants in student government, j
THIS CHARGE is simply not
true. The constitution was pro
posed with the intention of in
creasing student participation in
student government and, conse
quently, of increasing the effec
tiveness of student government in
the community in which we live.
The proposed constitution was in
tended to join the Interfraternity
Council and other organs of
ASSU in an attempt to tackle such
problems as housing and aca- j
demic affairs. The constitution
was a chance for mature students
to work together, to accomplish
more than is presently being ac
complished.
We have temporarily lost our
chance. We are now a house di
vided, and while we shall continue
to stand, our feet shall remain
riveted to a base of fears and petty
jealousies. It does, indeed, seem
ridiculous that while our educa
tion teaches us the value of lead
ership in a self-governing com
munity, many fear to seek posi
tions of leadership and fear most
of all those who seek to lead.

“corrupt’ and to imply that the I
student body was being dictated |
to by Bob Sayler and other par-1
ticipants in student government, j
THIS CHARGE is simply not
true. The constitution was pro
posed with the intention of in
creasing student participation in
student government and, conse
quently, of increasing the effec
tiveness of student government in
the community in which we live.
The proposed constitution was in
tended to join the Interfraternity
Council and other organs of
ASSU in an attempt to tackle such
problems as housing and aca- j
demic affairs. The constitution
was a chance for mature students
to work together, to accomplish
more than is presently being ac
complished.
We have temporarily lost our
chance. We are now a house di
vided, and while we shall continue
to stand, our feet shall remain
riveted to a base of fears and petty
jealousies. It does, indeed, seem
ridiculous that while our educa
tion teaches us the value of lead
ership in a self-governing com
munity, many fear to seek posi
tions of leadership and fear most
of all those who seek to lead.
On Monday night the Interfra
ternity Council decided to oppose
the proposed ASSU Constitution
and on Tuesday that constitution
fell before a majority vote of the
14 per cent of the student body
which voted. Neglecting for the
present the argument that the
students did not have enough
time to study the proposals and,
therefore, either 1 voted in the neg
ative or abstained, I should like
to consider the implications of the
stand taken by the Interfraternity
Council.
It is my understanding that the
IFC’s objections to the proposed
constitution were; (1) that it gen
erally weakened the position of
the council with particular re
spect to the position of the stu
dent legislature, and (2) that it
defined the responsibilities of the
Interfraternity Judicial Council in
such away as to seriously threat
en the fraternity system at Stan
ford.
I WOULD ONLY point out, by
way of answering these objec
tions, that the present constitu
tion of the Associated Students
contains the “legislative suprem
acy’’ clause which was the basis
of the first objection, that the pro
posed legislature would have been
roughly one-sixth fraternity
spokesmen (rather than the pres
ent 1/13), that the proposed ju
dicial system would still have al
lowed the fraternities to indulge
in cleaning one’s own house, and
that the proposed judicial system
was undeniably a more legally
equitable one than that which now
governs.
Greater than my concern for
this immediate issue, however, is
my concern over the underdog
psychology which seems to crawl
through the minds of many fra

ternity leaders and members.
Change is equated with danger
and the fraternity system meets
every serious issue by displaying
a rather ironic lack of self confi
dence with which fraternities ap
proach social and athletic en
deavor - and because I believe
that the fraternity system has
the potential to take the lead in
other areas.
The situation has recently de
generated to the point where the
Faculty Advisor to the fraternity
system, Prof. James J. Watkins
IV, has used his class period to
call the proposed constitution
“corrupt’ and to imply that the I
student body was being dictated |
