“WE REGRET”
Editor, Hie Daily:
We regret the allegation in yes
terday’s Daily that the IFC was
mainly responsible for the defeat
of the new Constitution and main
ly opposed on grounds of special
interests. We feel that the Row
shared the general view of the
campus as shown by the insigni
ficant turnout of 1,454 ballots
(less than the turnout in last
spring’s presidential election) that
there was not time enough be
tween the publication of the en
tire text of the Constitution and
the referendum the following day
for adequate campus-wide dis
cussion.
We do favor adoption of a new
Constitution after full campus
discussion and are prepared to
work with other interested bodies
to that end.

DEATH-RATTLE
Editor, the Daily:
With all the recent news about
student government of various
sorts, I feel that one view was
overlooked, a .id I am persuaded
that this view has substantial fol
lowing. There are many students
who feel that there is no need for
student government at all.
LASSU exists, it is said, to pre
sent the unified student opinion
of Stanford University students
to whomever it may concern, and
the executive exists to run the
Association. But, in reality, what
important job does the Associa
tion do other than to perpetuate
itself? It seems that the existing
condition is simply government
for government’s sake, or perhaps

it exists to secure for its bureau
cracy an added extra-curricular
activity on their graduate tran
scripts.
I see by The Daily (4-18) that
by rejection of the proposed con
stitution, we have declined to fill
our role in cooperative decision
making with the University ad
ministration. Stanford has not
hired incompetent administrative
personnel. These people have
many years experience behind
them; they are not new at run
ning a large university. How dai’e
we, then, presume to tell these
people how to run the University?
Students tend to think only in
terms of the position they are
occupying at a given time. It is
difficult for students to see the
entire program, and often student
opinion fails to take into account
the relation of the specifics to the
general. Often, not having access
to information and other vital
data, students arrive at opinions
or conclusions which, if put into
effect, would not he beneficial. In
short, we pay the administration
good money to run the school;
let them do so.
Now it will perhaps be argued
that the administration has been
'known to make costly errors
and that an organized student
body can present view's to the
University which will save it from
error. Also, an organized student
body can present its views effec
tively whereas a simple agglomer
ation of students cannot. And too,
there is a certain amount of stu
dent business that has to be trans
acted.
How is this to be handled?
Business offices could remain as
present with one student finan
cial officer under supervision of
the dean’s office. Judicial affairs
would probably remain in the
hands of the various councils
presided over by the Student
Council sitting as a court of ap
peals. Where the services of a
representative of the student
bod are required, the chairman
of the Student Council could per
form them.

Concerning student opinion,
who wants it? The administra
tion? To them, student opinion is
usually worthless and, more often

than not, incorrect. Students
themselves? Opinion is rendered
to other students in The Daily.
The Daily would presumably con
tinue as a medium of expression
for everyone in the academic com
munity.
In fine, let LASSU conduct a
referendum to see how many ac
tually want student government
at all. The death-rattle is in the
throat of student government at
Stanford; let’s be humane and
merciful and put it out of its
misery.

A SMALL MATTER?
Editor, The Daily;
Perhaps it was a small matter,
(his proposed Constitution: its
writing, its presentation, its de
feat. After all, only 16 per cent
of the student body even voted
for or against it; and many peo
ple thought it was being “rushed
through,” and that a few' defects
in it overbalanced any essentia]
good in it.
BUT SOMEHOW one feels that
a great opportunity has been
missed. One does not regret tie
long hours spent talking about
the Constitution, or the use of
the words “representative” or
“responsibility” or “dignity” in
establishing a working philoso
phy behind it; one regrets only
that the sincerity and serious
ness that went into this endeavor
were not fully transmitted to the
voting students, that one did not
make it clear that this was really
a sort of last chance for improv
ing. let alone preserving, student
government at Stanford.
Several months ago, Columbia
and Harvard abandoned their stu
dent governments. Theirs were
somewhat different circumstances
than exist here. But it is a trend
over the United States; it will
probably continue.
Does the defeat of this Consti
tution really matter? Will it mat
ter to us 10 or 20 years from
now? Perhaps not.

I SUPPOSE all that really mat
ters is that some people really
cared about the relationship ot
students to their environment,
seriously endeavored to offer a
counter-measure to the farcical
student government we now have,
and sincerely believed that there
was an exciting alternative to that
of simply abandoning student
government altogether.
What will happen now? There
is a limit to enthusiasm even on
the part of reformers. I hope it
has not been reached. I hope
someone will keep trying to give
the students of this University a
voice in making the decisions
which affect them.
Post mortem bitters?
Maybe.
Or maybe one just gets a little
tired of trying to fight cynicism
and apathy. And losing.

BOROUGHISM
Editor, Tlie Daily:
Had the recently proposed
ASSU constitution been approved,
the “rotten borough” situation in
18th century England would have
found a ready 20th century paral
lel in graduate student represen
tation on LASSU. The parallel is
clear, but with one difference:
English “rotten boroughs” were
“owned” by political cliques be
cause these boroughs were under
populated, while the grad student
vote at Stanford would have been
easily “manipulated” because of
traditional graduate apathy to
ward campus politics.
THOSE WHO favored giving
the grad students 40 per cent of
the seats on LASSU (or roughly
50 seats) argued that if only (he
graduates received their “fair
share of campus political repre
sentation” they would suddenly
purge themselves of their time
honored disinterest and become
active, conscientious participants
in campus government.
Judging from the normal grad
student voting turnout, I feel that

what more likely would have
taken place would be the follow
ing: one or two aggressive po
litical “machines” would be as
sembled by that handful of grad
students who are actually inter
ested in campus politics; these
machines would maneuver the
party faithful onto the grad stu
dent ballot; then, because of tra
ditional disinterest among the
great majority of their fellow
grad students, these few politicos
would sweep the field, corner the
grad representative spots, and be
come the most powerful (and
dominant) bloc in LASSU.
I VOTED “NO” on Tuesday be
cause I strongly oppose precipi
tously opening the door to a situ
ation ripe for machine politics
and “rotten boroughism” when
the rise of such a situation, in
view of (he proverbial lack of in
terest among the constituents
concerned, would seem unavoid
able.
Let future constitution-makers
bear this in mind.

HAND IN GLOVE
Editor, Tlie Daily:
Perhaps if the President’s Of
fice worked more hand in glover
with the Committee on Public
Exercises, our public relations
would be more sterling.

CORRECTION
Editor, The Daily;
As President of Women’s Coun
cil I would like to correct a state
ment made in yesterday’s Daily.
I had not seen the petition con
cerning the liquor policy until
reading it in The Daily yesterday.
It can hardly be slated therefore
that mine was included among the
signatures. This letter does not
indicate either agreement or dis
agreement with the writers, mere
ly I do not believe the office of
President of Women’s Council
should be used to endorse or not
to endorse such a position.
