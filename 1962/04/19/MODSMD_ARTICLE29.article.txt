U.S. National Student Associ
ation identity cards are now
available at the Stanford Over
seas Information Service office,
according to George Corfino,
SOIS director.
The cards, which are valid any
where in the world, are especially
useful in Europe where they en
title students to discounts on cul
tural events. They also enable
students to stay in Student Hos
tels while traveling.
The cards will be passed out
today from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. and
every Tuesday. Thursday, and
Friday thereafter for as long as
they last. The cost is $1.
