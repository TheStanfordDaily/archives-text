In the spring primary of 1948
the Stanford Student Body ap
proved a plan to bring foreign
students to Stanford. By a vote
of 1858 to 963 the ASSU Foreign
Scholarship Program was born,
and the new Commission imme
diately began its work in selecting
superior students from foreign
nations.

The referendum in part reflect
ed student concern over the Com
munist seizure of power in Czech
oslovakia a few months before
and more generally over the
whole issue of World War 11. The
outcome was a positive assertion
of Stanford's position in world
affairs.
SINCE THAT time over one
hundred Foreign Scholars have
been brought to Stanford as a re
sult of the Program. In the first
year six were selected from Eu
rope and one from the Balkans.
In 1951 Asia ( Japan) was first
represented, and then in 1956
came Africa (Morocco). Next year
for (he first time a Scholar from
Latin America (Brazil) will round
out the group still further.

THE SCHOLARS are selected
by the Foreign Scholarship Com
mission on the basis of their aca
demic records, their experience as
leaders in student affairs, and
other criteria which ensure their
full participation in campus life
at Stanford. This year from ap

proximately two hundred appli
cations seven finalists were se
lecled.

Financing the Program is a
joint venture of the living groups,
the Administration, the HR, Cap
and Gown, and the ASSU. As such
it is a reflection of the broad and
genuine support the program has
enjoyed since its initiation.
In the following weeks The
Daily will print articles written
by this year’s Foreign Scholars,
in which they will air their feel
ings about their experiences of
the past year. The first, in tomor
row’s Daily, is by Poo Chung
Mar, ASSU Foreign Scholar from
Hong Kong.
