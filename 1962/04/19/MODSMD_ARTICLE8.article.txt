# 'Losing Tradition' Lightfoot Says
## 
### 
“I feel . . . that one of the
things our country is losing . . ,
is tradition, said Tim Williams,
Stanford’s “Prince Lightfoot” in
a talk on the value of tradition
and of respect for one’s fellow
men last night in Cubbcrley Au
ditorium.
Williams used many examples
from his own life and from the
Indian tradition to illustrate his
point that our upbringing is im
portant in fostering the respect
for our fellowmen which will en
able us to make our way in the
business world for which we are
preparing.
In deploring the apathy of the
student body at Stanford, Wil
liams said, “How great it would
be if this school, one of the great
est in the United States,” could
teach its students to take the good
from our tradition and to use
common sense to become the best
possible citizens of the United
States, our community, and of
Stanford University.
