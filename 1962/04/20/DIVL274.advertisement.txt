riding, more comfortable automobiles . .r?
better insulation materials for all-weather

need less care and retain their value better.
From their continuing research will come
future Ford-built cars, for example, with auto

. . . new kinds of power plants and energy
sources .. . stronger steels and plastics .. .
new aerodynamic design for greater vehicle
control. That's why Ford Motor Company is
