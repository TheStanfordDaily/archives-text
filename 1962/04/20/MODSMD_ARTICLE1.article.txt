# AT LASSU MEETING
## Action Deferred on Drinking, Pacifists 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
LASSU last night licked the wounds of the defeat of the pro
posed constitution, smiled, then burst into hilarity discussing en
tering the Spring Sing. Action on the Forum for Discussion of Non-
Violent Alternatives to War and on the proposed liquor amend
ment was deferred. ASSU President Boh Sayler proposed nothing

bo done about the rejected con
stitution. as any action would be
tampering with the newly-elected
ASSU President’s administration.

The seven presidential candi
dates approve some change in the
constitution, and several want
the proposed constitution, Sayler
said.

ONCE THE president is elected,
several courses are open. There
could be a massive change in the
By-Laws, which wouldn’t need
student approval, or there could
be a new referendum next au
tumn.

Sayler said it would be foolish
to let the constitutional experi
ence in this LASSU go unused.
Finance manager designate
Fred Nelson then moved LASSU
enter the Spring Sing. There was
light and lively discussion, and
the motion passed.

SAYLER REPORTED that the
Trustees have not yet acted on
the peace group, hut that they
will probably approve the ASSU
position. He restated his position
that the problem has only been
one of lack of communication,
which has now been clarified.

The liquor policy referendum
was referred to committee until
next week. At that time Joel
Mcister will explain the legal as
pects of the proposed change.
There is a story on the liquor
amendment elsewhere on this
page.

LASSU supported Chuck Bis
choff in his approval of the ques
tioned Poli Union elections.
