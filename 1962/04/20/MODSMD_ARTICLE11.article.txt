# Winbigler Skeptical About Change in Liquor Policy
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler told The Daily yester
day that the proposed amend
ment to the ASSU by-laws which
would alter Stanford’s liquor
policy is negative and would
mean abdication of authority by
student government.
Nearly 425 students signed the
“liquor petition” yesterday, bring
ing the total to approximately
1625. Sponsors of the petition,
trying to get 2000 signatures,
have devided to keep it on En
gineering Corner this morning.
THE PETITION was submitted
to Legislature last night for a
first reading. LASSU wall vote on
the proposed referendum next
week; a simple majority will put
it on the May 2 ballot.
Winbigler said the proposed
amendment includes two quite
separate statements. The first
part reads, “The possession,
transportation, or use ow intoxi
cating liquors by Stanford stu
dents in the University com
munity shall be in accordance
with state law.”
“To the best of my knowledge
and belief,” Winbigler says, “the
only respect in which the present
policy departs basically from the
state law is that University rules
apply to Stanford students over
21 as well as to those under 21.”
HE GOES ON to say that if the
intent of the first part of the pro
posed amendment is to urge re
peal on use of liquor on campus
by students over 21, he thinks “it
would be advisable to state this as
a specific proposition.”
Winbigler takes stronger issue
with the second part of the pro
posed amendment which reads,
“No judicial council of the Uni
versity shall punish a student for
possession, transportation, or use
of intoxicating liquors where the
state law has not been violated.”
He has three objections to this.
First, he cannot recall any “liq
uor case” handled by any one of
Stanford’s judicial councils which
did not involve a presumed viola
tion of state law. However, Win
bigler says, “our judicial coun
cils are not legally qualified to
determine whether a student has
violated the state law.
“THE EFFECT of this pro
vision would be to deny to the
ASSU jurisdiction over an al
leged liquor violation until after
there is certainty of such a viola
tion, which means conviction in
court.” After conviction, he con
tinues, action by a student judi
cial council is gratuitous.
Objection two is that the
amendment, if passed, would
mean “abdication of authority
and responsibility by student gov
ernment ...” Winbigler points
out that the University and state
authorities, working singly or in
combination, could fill the vacu
um, but ho doubts that the result
would be to the students’ satis
faction.
FINALLY, Winbigler believes
the proposed amendment is “pri
marily restrictive or negative in
its effect.” No attention what
ever, ho says, is given to the need
for a positive approach to the
very real problem of excessive
use of liquor.
Elsewhere on the liquor front,
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commissions have
endorsed the proposed by-law
change (see Letters to the Editor,
page 2.)
In addition, several faculty
members have signed a separate
petition backing the proposed
liquor amendment. They include:
Otis Pease, Thomas C. Moser,
Richard W. Lyman, John H. Bun
zel, Albert J. Guerard, Edwin J.
Doyle, Richard A. Wasserstrom.
Raymond E. Wolfinger, Edwin M.
Good, and Hubert R. Marshall.

“To the best of my knowledge
and belief,” Winbigler says, “the
only respect in which the present
policy departs basically from the
state law is that University rules
apply to Stanford students over
21 as well as to those under 21.”
HE GOES ON to say that if the
intent of the first part of the pro
posed amendment is to urge re
peal on use of liquor on campus
by students over 21, he thinks “it
would be advisable to state this as
a specific proposition.”
Winbigler takes stronger issue
with the second part of the pro
posed amendment which reads,
“No judicial council of the Uni
versity shall punish a student for
possession, transportation, or use
of intoxicating liquors where the
state law has not been violated.”
He has three objections to this.
First, he cannot recall any “liq
uor case” handled by any one of
Stanford’s judicial councils which
did not involve a presumed viola
tion of state law. However, Win
bigler says, “our judicial coun
cils are not legally qualified to
determine whether a student has
violated the state law.
“THE EFFECT of this pro
vision would be to deny to the
ASSU jurisdiction over an al
leged liquor violation until after
there is certainty of such a viola
tion, which means conviction in
court.” After conviction, he con
tinues, action by a student judi
cial council is gratuitous.
Objection two is that the
amendment, if passed, would
mean “abdication of authority
and responsibility by student gov
ernment ...” Winbigler points
out that the University and state
authorities, working singly or in
combination, could fill the vacu
um, but ho doubts that the result
would be to the students’ satis
faction.
FINALLY, Winbigler believes
the proposed amendment is “pri
marily restrictive or negative in
its effect.” No attention what
ever, ho says, is given to the need
for a positive approach to the
very real problem of excessive
use of liquor.
Elsewhere on the liquor front,
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commissions have
endorsed the proposed by-law
change (see Letters to the Editor,
page 2.)
In addition, several faculty
members have signed a separate
petition backing the proposed
liquor amendment. They include:

Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler told The Daily yester

would alter Stanford’s liquor
policy is negative and would
mean abdication of authority by
student government.
Nearly 425 students signed the
“liquor petition” yesterday, bring

violated the state law.
“THE EFFECT of this pro
vision would be to deny to the
ASSU jurisdiction over an al
leged liquor violation until after
there is certainty of such a viola
tion, which means conviction in
court.” After conviction, he con
tinues, action by a student judi
cial council is gratuitous.
Objection two is that the
amendment, if passed, would
mean “abdication of authority
and responsibility by student gov
ernment ...” Winbigler points
out that the University and state
authorities, working singly or in
combination, could fill the vacu
um, but ho doubts that the result
would be to the students’ satis
faction.
FINALLY, Winbigler believes
the proposed amendment is “pri
marily restrictive or negative in
its effect.” No attention what
ever, ho says, is given to the need
for a positive approach to the
very real problem of excessive
use of liquor.
Elsewhere on the liquor front,
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commissions have
endorsed the proposed by-law
change (see Letters to the Editor,
page 2.)
In addition, several faculty
members have signed a separate
petition backing the proposed
liquor amendment. They include:
Otis Pease, Thomas C. Moser,
Richard W. Lyman, John H. Bun
zel, Albert J. Guerard, Edwin J.
Doyle, Richard A. Wasserstrom.
Raymond E. Wolfinger, Edwin M.
Good, and Hubert R. Marshall.
