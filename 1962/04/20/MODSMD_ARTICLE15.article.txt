## Target for Partisan Criticism Becomes Apparent Success 
### DEAN SAVAGE 
In its early stages the Peace
Corps was a favorite target for
partisan criticism from a variety
of habitats. In a House sub-com
mittee meeting, Rep. Cross (R
-lowa), echoing the sentiments of
many of his colleagues, told
Sargent Shriver that he saw no
reason for the agency, and called
it a “boondoggle,” whatever that
means. The DAR voted 2,000 to
one against the corps- “a danger
to the United States” and the
National Review was pessimistic.
Even former President Eisen
hower saw fit to criticize what he
called “a .juvenile experiment.”
SINCE THE Peace Corps has
taken the field, attitudes have
taken another tack and it has be
come impolitic for most legisla
tors to oppose the project.
There is evidence that the vir
tues stressed by the corps—in
cluding hard work and dedication
■ —are precisely those which es
pecially appeal to a large number
of conservatives generally op
posed to foreign aid. Barry Gold
water, for instance, has come out
strongly in favor, and Senator
John J. Sparkman, Democrat of
Alabama, stated the Peace Corps
was so successful that he would
not be surprised to see the Soviet
bloc adopt a similar program.
Concurrently there has been a
virtually complete cessation of
the verbal pot-shotting so com
mon in earlier months.
BEHIND ALE this lies a com
mendable performance record. Of
781 volunteers sent to the field,
only six have returned to the
United States, and four of these

were for medical and personal
(death in the family) reasons.
The reactions of the host coun
tries are perhaps the best indica
tion of their success. Each of the
12 countries to which volunteers
are now assigned has requested
at least a doubling of Peace Corps
strength. Requests from the rest
of the world have brought the
total demand to more than .50,000.
STILL IT IS too early to give
unqualified approval. The pro
gram is young and although field
inspectors report the expected
decline in morale has not shown
up, no volunteer has been over
seas for even a full year.
It remains to be seen whether
the kinds of reasons which attract
volunteers to the program have a
staying power equal to the diffi
cult circumstances of life in the
underdeveloped world. It is im
possible, for example, to describe
the grinding, grimy poverty of
an Indian village to those who
have never experienced it. And,
brotherhood notwithstanding, few
volunteers will really have much
in common with the peasants of
a backward agricultural village.
To serve two years under such
conditions is a challenge, the out
come of which is not yet clear.
HOWEVER, it is gratifying to
record that, thus far, the corps
has demonstrated a real measure
of achievement, both to the host
countries and to the volunteers
themselves.
What is perhaps most clear is
that the Peace Corps does offer
one of those all too rare oppor
tunities to combine idealism and
effective action.

(death in the family) reasons.
The reactions of the host coun
tries are perhaps the best indica
tion of their success. Each of the
12 countries to which volunteers
are now assigned has requested
at least a doubling of Peace Corps
strength. Requests from the rest
of the world have brought the
total demand to more than .50,000.
STILL IT IS too early to give
unqualified approval. The pro
gram is young and although field
inspectors report the expected
decline in morale has not shown
up, no volunteer has been over
seas for even a full year.
It remains to be seen whether
the kinds of reasons which attract
volunteers to the program have a
staying power equal to the diffi
cult circumstances of life in the
underdeveloped world. It is im
possible, for example, to describe
the grinding, grimy poverty of
an Indian village to those who
have never experienced it. And,
brotherhood notwithstanding, few
volunteers will really have much
in common with the peasants of
a backward agricultural village.
To serve two years under such
conditions is a challenge, the out
come of which is not yet clear.
HOWEVER, it is gratifying to
record that, thus far, the corps
has demonstrated a real measure
of achievement, both to the host
countries and to the volunteers
themselves.
What is perhaps most clear is
that the Peace Corps does offer
one of those all too rare oppor
tunities to combine idealism and
effective action.
In its early stages the Peace
Corps was a favorite target for
partisan criticism from a variety
of habitats. In a House sub-com
mittee meeting, Rep. Cross (R
-lowa), echoing the sentiments of
many of his colleagues, told
Sargent Shriver that he saw no
reason for the agency, and called
it a “boondoggle,” whatever that
means. The DAR voted 2,000 to
one against the corps- “a danger
to the United States” and the
National Review was pessimistic.
Even former President Eisen
hower saw fit to criticize what he
called “a .juvenile experiment.”
SINCE THE Peace Corps has
taken the field, attitudes have
taken another tack and it has be
come impolitic for most legisla
tors to oppose the project.
There is evidence that the vir
tues stressed by the corps—in
cluding hard work and dedication
■ —are precisely those which es
pecially appeal to a large number
of conservatives generally op
posed to foreign aid. Barry Gold
water, for instance, has come out
strongly in favor, and Senator
John J. Sparkman, Democrat of
Alabama, stated the Peace Corps
was so successful that he would
not be surprised to see the Soviet
bloc adopt a similar program.
Concurrently there has been a
virtually complete cessation of
the verbal pot-shotting so com
mon in earlier months.
BEHIND ALE this lies a com
mendable performance record. Of
781 volunteers sent to the field,
only six have returned to the
United States, and four of these

were for medical and personal
(death in the family) reasons.
