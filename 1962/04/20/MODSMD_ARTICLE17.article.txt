NONPARTISAN?
Editor, The Daily:
In his note to the peace group
(The Daily, Tuesday), President
Sterling writes of non-partisan
ship as being the University poli
cy. As he puts it so well, "It
(Stanford U.) accepts a corre
sponding obligation to maintain
a non-partisan position with re
spect to political issues and to
prevent its privileged position
from becoming a sanctuary of
partisan political and social ac
tion.”

But, the letters written to the
alumni regarding Baran’s speech
do not seem to vindicate his posi
tion. To quote from one of the
letters (not written by the Presi
dent), "Also I should like to re
assure you at the outset that the
Administration and the Trustees
of the University are also con
cerned about some of the state
ments made by Prof. Baran.”
(The Daily. April 12).
Why, oh why, should a non-par
tisan and “independent institution
of higher learning” be concerned
about some Marxist opinions ex
pressed by one of its faculty mem
bers? Especially since his “integ
rity and intellectual capacity”
stand unquestioned.
Nay, tarry a while. The letter
goes on to say, "neither the Board
of Trustees nor the University
Administration agrees with his
(Prof. Baran’s) sentiments . . . ”
Here, if I may ask, is not the Uni
versity taking a political position,
if not for, at least against?
Though, interpreted liberally,
the statements can be made to ap
pear excusable, their intent is not
lost on the reader. And how, in
view of this fact, and with a clear
conscience, can the President say
that Stanford U. is politically non
partisan?

"RESPONSIBILITY”
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the strained rela
tionships resulting from current
questions of academic freedom,
one is prone to say to all concern
ed: peace be with you ... as
long as you are peaceful responsi
bly and in accordance with uni
versity policy.

GET THE FACTS
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter in Wednesday’s
Daily, Mr. George Laird stated:
"In England at the present time
the Medicare budget is approxi
mately that of national defense

and has caused severe treasury
deficits.”

Dr. Laird presumably refers to
the cost of the National Health
Service. In 1960-61, Britain’s ex
penditure on defense was 1,608
million pounds, 9 per cent of na
tional income, and on the Nation
al Health Service 612 million
pounds, 3V 2 per cent of national
income.

As to the question of treasury
deficits, the 1960-61 budget show
ed a surplus (i.e„ on non-capital
expenditures) of 304 million
pounds (Britain: An Official
Handbook, 1961). Even if there
were a deficit, it would be a little
sweeping to attribute it to one
item. Any Englishman here can
not help noticing the persistent
campaign of disparagement and
misrepresentation which some
members of the medical profes
sion conduct against the National
Health Service. Could they not at
least get the facts right first?

FIRST STEP
Editor, The Daily:
In regard to the proposed
amendment on liquor to the ASSU
By-Laws, we wish to clarify the
effects of the amendment on the
present situation at Stanford. If
adopted, the amendment will not.
of itself, change University policy
on liquor. That policy is to pro
hibit liquor on campus, both to
minors and students over 21.
The only direct effect of the
amendment would bo to take
from from the jurisdiction G f the
ASSU judicial councils those
cases in which state law is upheld
but in which University policy Is
violated.
Irrespective of present or fu
ture University policy on liquor,
it is, and shall remain, according
to the Alcoholic Beverages Con
trol Act, a misdemeanor for any
person to sell, furnish, give, or
cause to be sold, furnished, or
given away any alcoholic bever
age to a minor.
We advocate the passage of the
proposed amendment as the first
step toward the formulation of a
realistic liquor policy.

APOLOGIES
Editor, The Daily:
Our sincere apologies to Miss
Crawford. We confused Miss
Crawford with Marty Collins,
who is only a member of Wom
en’s Council.

RIGHT TO OBLIVION?
Editor, The Daily:
Few seem to realize that al
though the upcoming election for
Student Body President will be
decided, the victor may, indeed,
win no more than the right to
oblivion.
This election, I suggest, is great
ly overshadowed by two issues:
whether there is any need for
student government and, if there
is a need, whether the contestants
are obligated to provide the best
possible government—no matter
what the personal cost.
I feel that there is a definite
need for student government—
not so much to decide the amount
Rally Commission shall spend for
new sweaters as to present stu
dents with the opportunity to edu
cate themselves in the practice of
making meaningful public de
cisions, not so much to quibble
over the wording of the Flying
Club constitution as to facilitate
the maintenance of an intellectu
ally charged atmosphere at a
great university, not so much to
help the administration adminis
ter as to help the entire student
body make its wishes known to
the non-student community.
If you do not feel a need to pre
pare yourself to make decisions;
if you are not interested in mat
ters of the mind; or if you simply
do not have any opinions on the
conduct of the community—you
are probably opposed to student
government and, I would suggest,
are unfit to occupy a place in this
university.
If, on the other hand, you have
a commitment to self improve
ment, you are under an obligation
to voice your ideas, to vote in
elections, to seek to lead, and to
fully support the concept of good
student government. Only in this
manner can your student govern
ment survive—for there is no

value in holding an office with an
important sounding title if no
one follows when you lead.

Unless students awaken, valu
able opportunities will be lost and

those who are about to campaign
for the student body presidency
will suddenly discover that the
crowd has gone home.
