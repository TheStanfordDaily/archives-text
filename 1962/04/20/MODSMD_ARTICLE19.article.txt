Stanford hosts the touring Air Force Academy this weekend
in a pair of baseball games. The Flyhoys will he here today and
tomorrow on Sunken Diamond, with both games starting at 3 p.m.
There had been some fear earlier this week that Stanford
would have trouble scraping up a pitching staff for the weekend

series. The newly found pitching
ace, Jim “Flamingo” Lonborg,
had been suffering from a sore
arm, bui in practice Wednesday
said he fell better than he had
for a long time'.
Number I wo starter Darrell
Sutherland had 1 lie flu, but has
recovered sufficiently that Dutch
Fehring plans to let him start
tomorrow, with Lonborg throw
ing the series opener today.
AS FAB AS its other eight
starters are concerned, Stanford
is in good shape.
The catcher is Bob Overman.
In the infield are Jack Allen, first
base; second base, Skip Law
rence; shortstop, Joel Shulman;
and third base, Rich Ferrazzano.
In the outfield will be O. J. So
lander, Oreg oPst and Jim Chenu.
