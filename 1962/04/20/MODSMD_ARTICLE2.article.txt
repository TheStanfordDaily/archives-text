# Students Grade Trinity Profs
## 
### 
The faculty of Trinity College
in Hartford, Conn., has recently
come under sharp attack from
the student senate.

The senate drew up and pub
lished a report that grades pro
fesors according to their worth
as teachers. The report, 78 pages
long, names professors who earn
ed F’s for their teaching.
One professor, described as
having a “generally poor curricu
lum,” said, “It is inconceivable
that the administration should
permit publication of such a re
port.”

In general, professors were
castigated for being “not strict
enough, ineffectual.” Examining
the Fine Arts Department, the
report charged that it was main
ly interested in the “education of
the student for polite conversa
tion.”

Nor does the report stop at
criticizing the faculty. It com
plains that the typical student
“does not have any concept of
what education involves, nor does
he give any indication of wanting
to find out.”
Furthermore, most students,
having “openly flouted” the honor
system of chapel attendance,
leave Trinity "with less religious
reverence than was theirs upon
entrance,” the report said.
