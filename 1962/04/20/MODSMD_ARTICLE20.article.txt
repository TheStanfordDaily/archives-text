# Freshman Nine Plays Santa Rosa
## 
### 
A Stanford frosh baseball club
that is very successful against
college opposition but weak when
meeting high schools will play
two games this weekend.
The frosh meet Menlo College
today at 3 p.m. and Santa Rosa
High School tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Both games are scheduled for
Stanfordâ€™s Jet Field.
THE FROSH HAVE an unusual
jinx, in that they have a 3-0 rec
ord against tough college frosh
teams, but are 1-3 against high
schools. The frosh have also beat
en Stanford varsity in practice.
Wednesday, Stanford clobbered
the Santa Clara frosh 10-6, with
strong relief pitching from Rich
Brear the main factor in the
game. Brear relieved in the sec
ond inning, struck out 10, and
gave up only three hits and two

walks in his T' i innings.
THK HITTING PUNCH was
provided mainly by George Ash
more, who homered, tripled, and
singled, driving in four runs. Ash
more is now batting .462.
