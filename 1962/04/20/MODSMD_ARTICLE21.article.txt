# TOMORROW
## Spikers, Huskies Vie Here 
### PETE KING 
Several exciting duels in the j
pole vault, shot put, and hurdles)
loom for tomorrow's track meet j
against Washington at 2 p.m. in j
Stanford Stadium. A pre-meet |
dope sheet shows the Indians
winning, 77-54,
The featured event will be the
pole vault, with Stanford’s Phil
White going Washing
ton's John Cramer. Cramer is the
AAWU's best vaulter, with a sea
son’s high of 15-314, and lie is con
sistently over the 15-foot mark.
While is more inexperienced at
that height, having cleared it only
once, but he possesses great po
tential, as evidenced by his near
miss at 15-4 two weeks ago.
IN THE SHOT PUT, sopho
more Steve Arch of Stanford will
get some rough competition from
senior Tony Angell of Washing
ton. Angell’s season best is 54-4%,
while Arch threw 56-1 last week.
The two are about evenly
matched in potential.
Both hurdles races should go
right down to the wire. Stan
ford’s Steve Cortright has a half
second edge on the Huskies’ Mike
Thrall in the lows, and Thrall’s
best in the highs is just .2 second
better than Cortright’s.
The Indians would be picked
for more than 77 points, except
that coach Payton Jordan is giv
ing some of his key men a rest.
Broad jumpers Chuck Barth and
Dan Moore, both having an edge
of at least a foot and a half on
their opposition, will be inactive
in order to give recent injuries a
chance to heal.
INDIAN TWOMILER Harry
McCalla, whose 8:58,3 last week
is this year’s third best collegiate
time, will not be running in either
the mile or the two-mile, but is
favored to take the 880, an event
that ho has not run previously
this year.
In other events, Ken Emanuels
of Stanford is a favorite in the
440, while Washington’s Jerry
Plowman has a very slight edge
in the sprints over Phil Lamo
reaux of Stanford. Stanford is
heavily favored in the discus,
high jump, Javelin, and mile re
lay. The Huskies should win the
broad jump and the mile run.


CARD HURLER Jim Lonborg, who was suffering from a sore arm
last week is ready for this weekend's action with the Air Force.
