GENEVA (UPD—The Soviets
tried in Geneva and Moscow yes
terday to block scheduled U.S.
nuclear tests by proposing a new
test moratorium. But U.S. Am
bassador Arthur H. Dean turned
down the offer, saying: “We
won’t be burned twice by the
same fire.”

An official Soviet government
statement issued in Moscow said
Russia would refrain from test
ing nuclear weapons while the
conference discusses a neutral na
tion compromise inspection pro
posals “if the Western powers do
the same.”

Soviet delegate Valerian A. Zo
rin told the 17-nation disarma
ment conference that the Soviets
are willing to use the neutral pro
posal as the basis for new nego
tiations on a nuclear test ban pro
viding the United States cancels
plans for Pacific atmospheric
testing late this month.
