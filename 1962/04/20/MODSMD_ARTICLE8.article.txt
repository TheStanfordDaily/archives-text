### CHRIS WILLS 
“Southeast Asia-Contemporary
Diplomacy,” the first speech of
the series on “Southeast Asia in
Review,” was given last night by
Dr. Milton W. Meyer, Assistant
Professor of History at Los An
gelos State College.
Meyer divided the years fol
lowing W.W.11 into three phases
of Southeast Asian history. Dur
ing 1945-50 it met the problem of
gaining independence. Meyer call
ed 1950-60 the “Asian years” dur
ing which the countries struggled
to be heard in the UN. Since 1960
there has been a x-eversion of in
terest to domestic affairs.
SOUTHEAST ASIA faces four
types of intra-regional problems
today: those of territory, racial
minorities, cold war alignments,
and regional disagreements, Mey
er stated.
Many of the boundaries, such
as those of Thailand and Cam
bodia, have never been defined
clearly and are still being dis
puted.
In historic times waves of Chi
nese had spread over into South
east Asia. Those nomadic groups,
who have retained their cultures
continue to fluctuate between
countries, thus causing further
border problems, he explained.
MEYER GAVE Indonesia and
the Philippines as examples of a
cold war alignment which has
made little progress toward set
tlement during the last 17 years.
There has been little accom

plishment toward regionalism
among the nations themselves,
stated Meyer, since Southeast
Asia wants nothing to do with a
common bloc. The UN has
prompted most of the action.
SOUTHEAST ASIA’S extra-re
gional diplomatic problems, like
its intra-regional tensions, have
arisen from historical border dis
putes plus the cold war situation,
Meyer stated.
Although the US and Russia
are now being used as scapegoats
for these problems, the solutions
must come eventually from
Southeast Asia itself.
