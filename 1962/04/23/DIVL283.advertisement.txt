The mover is more of a girl scoul than a girl watcher.
DJl©@®E] D§° Watching at a beach or pool
When watching at the beach or pool it is not necessary
to keep moving. In fact, it is unwise to move at all, un*
less the watcher actually enjoys swimming. In such cases
he should swim.
At the beach it is better to stay in one place, because
the mover is more of a girl scout than a girl watcher
(see above). He is somewhat like the man who goes to
the theater to see girls. The girl watcher goes to a musical
and happens to notice the beautiful girls. The scout goes
to see the girls and, sometimes, happens to notice the
musical. (Whether you’re a watcher or a scout, you'll
find Pall Mall makes a most pleasant companion.)

Compare all three! Smoke "traveled" through line tobacco tastes list.
See the difference! With Pall Mall, you get that famous length
of the finest tobaccos money can buy. Pall Mail's famous length
travels and gentles the smoke naturally ... over, under, around
and through Pall Mall's fine, mellow tobaccos. Makes it mild
. . . but does not filter out that satisfying flavor!
Pall Mali’s
natural mildness
is so good
to your taste!
So smooth, so satisfying,
so downright smokcablc!
