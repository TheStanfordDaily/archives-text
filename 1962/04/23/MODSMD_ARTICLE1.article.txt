Editor’s Note: This Ls the first in a series
of articles on the Seattle World’s Fair. Pete
Steil attended a preview of the Fair.)

The first international exposition to be
held in the United States in 23 years opened
its doors to the world in Seattle at 11 a.m.
Saturday. Century 21 Exposition’s “Man in
Space” theme unfolds a world of the future
against the backdrop of man’s accomplish
ments in today’s space age.
What was originally to be a regional ef
fort has become in reality a World’s Fair.
Planned as a 50th year commemoration of
Seattle’s 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposi
tion, the world-wide importance of Seattle’s
World’s Fair emerged dramatically in late
1959 when the United States Government be
came the prime exhibitor and sanction was
received from the Bureau of International
Expositions. The 8.1.E.’s coveted “world’s
fair” designation will be the only one given
to a fair in the United States during the next
decade.
The advance ticket sales of over $8 million
is a dozen times greater than the most op
timistic estimate before the sale started.
Seattle is built on seven hills, some of
them so steep that the sidewalks have cleats.
But all of the hills are not there, for there

was a time when the engineers were called
in to take the tops off the worst of them.

AN INDICATION of the trouble confront
ing Seattle’s progress is found in the pattern
which its main downtown streets follow.
There are two streets, each starting with
and in the same order as the first letter of
each word in the following sentence: Jesus
Christ made Seattle under protest.
A panting complainer from the flat coun
try is unlikely to receive any sympathy from
a native. All a Seattlelite will say about his
hills is: “Oh, they aren’t bad,” or else, “True
they’re steep. But look at the view.” It might
even be said that scenery is Seattle’s sub
stitute for culture and, although this is not
entirely true, Seattle does love its scenery.
The Federal Science Pavilion has the po
tential of being the great hit of the fair. The
United States is spending $lO million for the
greatest scientific exhibit ever assembled in
this country. The two-hour, continuous walk
through show is the culmination of the com
bined efforts of almost 300 of the nation’s
leading scientists.

The Science Pavilion is made up of six
connected buildings, arranged around an
open pool-court from which arise five, lacy,
100-foot-high “Space Gothic” towers symbol
izing man’s quest for knowledge. Visitors

will travel in groups through the House of
Science, actually a 12-minute movie projected
on seven screens depicting science as the
meeting place of philosopher and workman;
the Development of Science, exhibits of sci
entific progress from man’s pioneering ex
periments to those of today; the Methods of
Science, examples of how a scientist goes
about his everyday tasks; and the Horizons
of Science, projecting how science affects—
and will affect—mankind.
THE SP*ACEAHIUM will be the highlite
of the trip. The twelve-minute simulated
rocket ride will leave the viewer grasping
for the handrails as he travels many times
the speed of light.
The Washington State Coliseum is an 11-
story structure covering three and a half
acres of post-free space, which will translate
into tangible terms modern man’s hopes for
Century 21. At first glance, the World of
Century 21 will seem to be nothing more
than an intriguing formation of cubes sus
pended in space like a mysterious floating
city. A transparent “bubbleator” will take
100 visitors at a time up an incline and with
in the mass of 3,500 four-foot cubes.

The unique cube structure is an engineer
ing marvel in itself. The fantastic cloud of
hanging cubes, underlined with music and

narration, actually gives the effect of an
animated theatrical mosaic. Each cube, as a
projection screen, is a keyhole to the future.

WITH THE SANCTION of the Bureau of
International Expositions and its 30 member
nations the Seattle fair was able to open its
world of commerce and industry to two
hemispheres—domestic and foreign.

There will be exhibits from 59 nations
and foreign cities, at least 51 of which are
official national exhibits sponsored by for
eign governments. There will also a a United
Nations exhibit. Notable firsts will include an
African Pavilian and participation by the
Common Market. Most of the foreign ex
hibits will focus their attention on life in the
future.
More than 100 companies—including the
top names in industry and commerce in the
United Stales—are on the list of domestic
exhibitors. Several firms have constructed
their own pavilions for far-ahead previews
of the 21st Century.
The fine arts exhibit is one of the greatest
art collections of all time. For a nominal fee
the visitor at the spacious, one-acre art
gallery will be able to view six exhibitions
in all. It will be one of the most ambitious
art shows ever seen and will include Master
pieces of Art, Northwest Coast Indian Art,

Art of the Ancient East, Contemporary
American and International Art (since 1950),
and a small gallery of paintings by Mark
Tobey. This array is valued at well over 20
million dollars.
THE MEMORIAE STADIUM will host
continuous performances for which no ad
mission will be charged. In three acres of
fun-packed delight, the Gayway will push
amusement to new heights. Most of the 19
rides will be making their American debut
at the Century 21 Exposition, and along with
them the principle of inducing light changes
in an entire amusement area by music which
was learned in France. The rides, which will
cost 25 to 35 cents, are all classic crowd
pleasers. Show Street will out-Vegas Las
Vegas. Although the showiest spot will be
Grade Hansen’s Paradise, a 700-seat theater
restaurant with hour-long floor shows, Show
Street will mix its attractions to even in
clude an antique automobile show.

The Performing Arts Department has put
together a program of entertainment with
a thoroughly international flavor ranging
from grand opera to the twist, from circuses
to ballet. These shows will mix serious the
ater, music, opera, and ballot about equally
with folk singing, cowboys, circuses, and
other light-hearted entertainment.

The Performing Arts Department has put
together a program of entertainment with
a thoroughly international flavor ranging
from grand opera to the twist, from circuses
to ballet. These shows will mix serious the
ater, music, opera, and ballot about equally
with folk singing, cowboys, circuses, and
other light-hearted entertainment.

The first international exposition to be
held in the United States in 23 years opened
its doors to the world in Seattle at 11 a.m.
Saturday. Century 21 Exposition’s “Man in
Space” theme unfolds a world of the future
against the backdrop of man’s accomplish
ments in today’s space age.
What was originally to be a regional ef
fort has become in reality a World’s Fair.
Planned as a 50th year commemoration of
Seattle’s 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposi
tion, the world-wide importance of Seattle’s
World’s Fair emerged dramatically in late
1959 when the United States Government be
came the prime exhibitor and sanction was
received from the Bureau of International
Expositions. The 8.1.E.’s coveted “world’s
fair” designation will be the only one given
to a fair in the United States during the next
decade.
The advance ticket sales of over $8 million
is a dozen times greater than the most op
timistic estimate before the sale started.
Seattle is built on seven hills, some of
them so steep that the sidewalks have cleats.
But all of the hills are not there, for there

was a time when the engineers were called
in to take the tops off the worst of them.

AN INDICATION of the trouble confront
ing Seattle’s progress is found in the pattern
which its main downtown streets follow.
There are two streets, each starting with
and in the same order as the first letter of
each word in the following sentence: Jesus
Christ made Seattle under protest.
A panting complainer from the flat coun
try is unlikely to receive any sympathy from
a native. All a Seattlelite will say about his
hills is: “Oh, they aren’t bad,” or else, “True
they’re steep. But look at the view.” It might
even be said that scenery is Seattle’s sub
stitute for culture and, although this is not
entirely true, Seattle does love its scenery.
The Federal Science Pavilion has the po
tential of being the great hit of the fair. The
United States is spending $lO million for the
greatest scientific exhibit ever assembled in
this country. The two-hour, continuous walk
through show is the culmination of the com
bined efforts of almost 300 of the nation’s
leading scientists.

The Science Pavilion is made up of six
connected buildings, arranged around an
open pool-court from which arise five, lacy,
100-foot-high “Space Gothic” towers symbol
izing man’s quest for knowledge. Visitors

will travel in groups through the House of
Science, actually a 12-minute movie projected
on seven screens depicting science as the
meeting place of philosopher and workman;
the Development of Science, exhibits of sci
entific progress from man’s pioneering ex
periments to those of today; the Methods of
Science, examples of how a scientist goes
about his everyday tasks; and the Horizons
of Science, projecting how science affects—
and will affect—mankind.
THE SP*ACEAHIUM will be the highlite
of the trip. The twelve-minute simulated
rocket ride will leave the viewer grasping
for the handrails as he travels many times
the speed of light.
The Washington State Coliseum is an 11-
story structure covering three and a half
acres of post-free space, which will translate
into tangible terms modern man’s hopes for
Century 21. At first glance, the World of
Century 21 will seem to be nothing more
than an intriguing formation of cubes sus
pended in space like a mysterious floating
city. A transparent “bubbleator” will take
100 visitors at a time up an incline and with
in the mass of 3,500 four-foot cubes.

The unique cube structure is an engineer
ing marvel in itself. The fantastic cloud of
hanging cubes, underlined with music and

narration, actually gives the effect of an
animated theatrical mosaic. Each cube, as a
projection screen, is a keyhole to the future.

WITH THE SANCTION of the Bureau of
International Expositions and its 30 member
nations the Seattle fair was able to open its
world of commerce and industry to two
hemispheres—domestic and foreign.

There will be exhibits from 59 nations
and foreign cities, at least 51 of which are
official national exhibits sponsored by for
eign governments. There will also a a United
Nations exhibit. Notable firsts will include an
African Pavilian and participation by the
Common Market. Most of the foreign ex
hibits will focus their attention on life in the
future.
More than 100 companies—including the
top names in industry and commerce in the
United Stales—are on the list of domestic
exhibitors. Several firms have constructed
their own pavilions for far-ahead previews
of the 21st Century.
The fine arts exhibit is one of the greatest
art collections of all time. For a nominal fee
the visitor at the spacious, one-acre art
gallery will be able to view six exhibitions
in all. It will be one of the most ambitious
art shows ever seen and will include Master
pieces of Art, Northwest Coast Indian Art,

Art of the Ancient East, Contemporary
American and International Art (since 1950),
and a small gallery of paintings by Mark
Tobey. This array is valued at well over 20
million dollars.
THE MEMORIAE STADIUM will host
continuous performances for which no ad
mission will be charged. In three acres of
fun-packed delight, the Gayway will push
amusement to new heights. Most of the 19
rides will be making their American debut
at the Century 21 Exposition, and along with
them the principle of inducing light changes
in an entire amusement area by music which
was learned in France. The rides, which will
cost 25 to 35 cents, are all classic crowd
pleasers. Show Street will out-Vegas Las
Vegas. Although the showiest spot will be
Grade Hansen’s Paradise, a 700-seat theater
restaurant with hour-long floor shows, Show
Street will mix its attractions to even in
clude an antique automobile show.

The Performing Arts Department has put

a thoroughly international flavor ranging

The first international exposition to be
held in the United States in 23 years opened
its doors to the world in Seattle at 11 a.m.
Saturday. Century 21 Exposition’s “Man in
Space” theme unfolds a world of the future
against the backdrop of man’s accomplish
ments in today’s space age.
What was originally to be a regional ef
fort has become in reality a World’s Fair.
Planned as a 50th year commemoration of
Seattle’s 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposi
tion, the world-wide importance of Seattle’s
World’s Fair emerged dramatically in late
1959 when the United States Government be
came the prime exhibitor and sanction was
received from the Bureau of International
Expositions. The 8.1.E.’s coveted “world’s
fair” designation will be the only one given
to a fair in the United States during the next
decade.
The advance ticket sales of over $8 million
is a dozen times greater than the most op
timistic estimate before the sale started.
Seattle is built on seven hills, some of
them so steep that the sidewalks have cleats.
But all of the hills are not there, for there

was a time when the engineers were called
in to take the tops off the worst of them.

AN INDICATION of the trouble confront
ing Seattle’s progress is found in the pattern
which its main downtown streets follow.
There are two streets, each starting with
and in the same order as the first letter of
each word in the following sentence: Jesus
Christ made Seattle under protest.
A panting complainer from the flat coun
try is unlikely to receive any sympathy from
a native. All a Seattlelite will say about his
hills is: “Oh, they aren’t bad,” or else, “True
they’re steep. But look at the view.” It might
even be said that scenery is Seattle’s sub
stitute for culture and, although this is not
entirely true, Seattle does love its scenery.
The Federal Science Pavilion has the po
tential of being the great hit of the fair. The
United States is spending $lO million for the
greatest scientific exhibit ever assembled in
this country. The two-hour, continuous walk
through show is the culmination of the com
bined efforts of almost 300 of the nation’s
leading scientists.

The Science Pavilion is made up of six
connected buildings, arranged around an
open pool-court from which arise five, lacy,
100-foot-high “Space Gothic” towers symbol
izing man’s quest for knowledge. Visitors

will travel in groups through the House of
Science, actually a 12-minute movie projected
on seven screens depicting science as the
meeting place of philosopher and workman;
the Development of Science, exhibits of sci
entific progress from man’s pioneering ex
periments to those of today; the Methods of
Science, examples of how a scientist goes
about his everyday tasks; and the Horizons
of Science, projecting how science affects—
and will affect—mankind.
THE SP*ACEAHIUM will be the highlite
of the trip. The twelve-minute simulated
rocket ride will leave the viewer grasping
for the handrails as he travels many times
the speed of light.
The Washington State Coliseum is an 11-
story structure covering three and a half
acres of post-free space, which will translate
into tangible terms modern man’s hopes for
Century 21. At first glance, the World of
Century 21 will seem to be nothing more
than an intriguing formation of cubes sus
pended in space like a mysterious floating
city. A transparent “bubbleator” will take
100 visitors at a time up an incline and with
in the mass of 3,500 four-foot cubes.

The unique cube structure is an engineer
ing marvel in itself. The fantastic cloud of
hanging cubes, underlined with music and

narration, actually gives the effect of an
animated theatrical mosaic. Each cube, as a
projection screen, is a keyhole to the future.

WITH THE SANCTION of the Bureau of
International Expositions and its 30 member
nations the Seattle fair was able to open its
world of commerce and industry to two
hemispheres—domestic and foreign.

There will be exhibits from 59 nations
and foreign cities, at least 51 of which are
official national exhibits sponsored by for
eign governments. There will also a a United
Nations exhibit. Notable firsts will include an
African Pavilian and participation by the
Common Market. Most of the foreign ex
hibits will focus their attention on life in the
future.
More than 100 companies—including the
top names in industry and commerce in the
United Stales—are on the list of domestic
exhibitors. Several firms have constructed
their own pavilions for far-ahead previews
of the 21st Century.
The fine arts exhibit is one of the greatest
art collections of all time. For a nominal fee
the visitor at the spacious, one-acre art
gallery will be able to view six exhibitions
in all. It will be one of the most ambitious
art shows ever seen and will include Master
pieces of Art, Northwest Coast Indian Art,

Art of the Ancient East, Contemporary
American and International Art (since 1950),
and a small gallery of paintings by Mark
Tobey. This array is valued at well over 20
million dollars.
THE MEMORIAE STADIUM will host
continuous performances for which no ad
mission will be charged. In three acres of
fun-packed delight, the Gayway will push
amusement to new heights. Most of the 19
rides will be making their American debut
at the Century 21 Exposition, and along with
them the principle of inducing light changes
in an entire amusement area by music which
was learned in France. The rides, which will
cost 25 to 35 cents, are all classic crowd
pleasers. Show Street will out-Vegas Las
Vegas. Although the showiest spot will be
Grade Hansen’s Paradise, a 700-seat theater

in an entire amusement area by music which
was learned in France. The rides, which will
cost 25 to 35 cents, are all classic crowd
pleasers. Show Street will out-Vegas Las

The Performing Arts Department has put
together a program of entertainment with
a thoroughly international flavor ranging

other light-hearted entertainment.

The first international exposition to be
held in the United States in 23 years opened
its doors to the world in Seattle at 11 a.m.
Saturday. Century 21 Exposition’s “Man in
Space” theme unfolds a world of the future
against the backdrop of man’s accomplish
ments in today’s space age.
What was originally to be a regional ef
fort has become in reality a World’s Fair.
Planned as a 50th year commemoration of
Seattle’s 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposi
tion, the world-wide importance of Seattle’s
World’s Fair emerged dramatically in late
1959 when the United States Government be
came the prime exhibitor and sanction was
received from the Bureau of International
Expositions. The 8.1.E.’s coveted “world’s
fair” designation will be the only one given
to a fair in the United States during the next
decade.
The advance ticket sales of over $8 million
is a dozen times greater than the most op
timistic estimate before the sale started.
Seattle is built on seven hills, some of
them so steep that the sidewalks have cleats.
But all of the hills are not there, for there

was a time when the engineers were called
in to take the tops off the worst of them.

AN INDICATION of the trouble confront
ing Seattle’s progress is found in the pattern
which its main downtown streets follow.
There are two streets, each starting with
and in the same order as the first letter of
each word in the following sentence: Jesus
Christ made Seattle under protest.
A panting complainer from the flat coun
try is unlikely to receive any sympathy from
a native. All a Seattlelite will say about his
hills is: “Oh, they aren’t bad,” or else, “True
they’re steep. But look at the view.” It might
even be said that scenery is Seattle’s sub
stitute for culture and, although this is not
entirely true, Seattle does love its scenery.
The Federal Science Pavilion has the po
tential of being the great hit of the fair. The
United States is spending $lO million for the
greatest scientific exhibit ever assembled in
this country. The two-hour, continuous walk
through show is the culmination of the com
bined efforts of almost 300 of the nation’s
leading scientists.

The Science Pavilion is made up of six
connected buildings, arranged around an
open pool-court from which arise five, lacy,
100-foot-high “Space Gothic” towers symbol
izing man’s quest for knowledge. Visitors

will travel in groups through the House of
Science, actually a 12-minute movie projected
on seven screens depicting science as the
meeting place of philosopher and workman;
the Development of Science, exhibits of sci
entific progress from man’s pioneering ex
periments to those of today; the Methods of
Science, examples of how a scientist goes
about his everyday tasks; and the Horizons
of Science, projecting how science affects—
and will affect—mankind.
THE SP*ACEAHIUM will be the highlite
of the trip. The twelve-minute simulated
rocket ride will leave the viewer grasping
for the handrails as he travels many times
the speed of light.
The Washington State Coliseum is an 11-
story structure covering three and a half
acres of post-free space, which will translate
into tangible terms modern man’s hopes for
Century 21. At first glance, the World of
Century 21 will seem to be nothing more
than an intriguing formation of cubes sus
pended in space like a mysterious floating
city. A transparent “bubbleator” will take
100 visitors at a time up an incline and with
in the mass of 3,500 four-foot cubes.

The unique cube structure is an engineer
ing marvel in itself. The fantastic cloud of
hanging cubes, underlined with music and

narration, actually gives the effect of an
animated theatrical mosaic. Each cube, as a
projection screen, is a keyhole to the future.

WITH THE SANCTION of the Bureau of
International Expositions and its 30 member
nations the Seattle fair was able to open its
world of commerce and industry to two
hemispheres—domestic and foreign.

There will be exhibits from 59 nations
and foreign cities, at least 51 of which are
official national exhibits sponsored by for
eign governments. There will also a a United
Nations exhibit. Notable firsts will include an
African Pavilian and participation by the
Common Market. Most of the foreign ex
hibits will focus their attention on life in the
future.
More than 100 companies—including the
top names in industry and commerce in the
United Stales—are on the list of domestic
exhibitors. Several firms have constructed
their own pavilions for far-ahead previews
of the 21st Century.
The fine arts exhibit is one of the greatest
art collections of all time. For a nominal fee
the visitor at the spacious, one-acre art
gallery will be able to view six exhibitions
in all. It will be one of the most ambitious
art shows ever seen and will include Master
pieces of Art, Northwest Coast Indian Art,

Art of the Ancient East, Contemporary
American and International Art (since 1950),
and a small gallery of paintings by Mark
Tobey. This array is valued at well over 20
million dollars.
THE MEMORIAE STADIUM will host
continuous performances for which no ad
mission will be charged. In three acres of
fun-packed delight, the Gayway will push
amusement to new heights. Most of the 19
rides will be making their American debut
at the Century 21 Exposition, and along with
