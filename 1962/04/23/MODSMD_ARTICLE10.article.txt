# Leader to Tell Why UN a 'Moral Must'
## 
### 
“The United Nations: A Moral Imperative in an Atomic Age,”
is the topic of a speech to be given today at 4:15 p.m. in Cubber
ley by Frank P. Graham. Graham is assistant to the Secretary-
General of the U.N. for the India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir
and the Dutch-Indonesia dispute. In his long career in public
service, Graham has earned a+

reputation as a leading advocate
of civil rights and equal educa
tional and work opportunities.

He was elected President of the
University of No. Carolina in
1930, and during his term there
was an ardent proponent of free
dom of thought and speech. He
defended the right of teachers to
organize and held that as long as
a professor maintained integrity
in his teaching, his position in
the university was secure.
DURING WORLD War II Gra
ham represented the general pub
lic on the National Defense Medi
ation Board and also served on
the War Labor Board. In these ca
pacities he was instrumental in
abolishing wage classification
based solely on differences in
race and fought consistently for
union security and wage stabili
zation.
In 1950 Graham fought a bitter
campaign against segregationists
in a bid for election to the Sen
ate. His defeat was called one of
the two “most crushing setbacks
Southern liberalism has suffered
since the coming of Franklin
Roosevelt,” by Sam Luboll in his
“The Future of American Poli
tics.”
GRAHAM HAS served in his
present capacity as Assistant to
the Secretary General since 1951,
although his name has been asso
ciated with great UN mediators
since 1947, when he served as the
Dutch-Indonesia Good Officer in
their dispute that year.

Graham’s visit to Stanford was
initiated by A1 Lowenstein, As
sistant Dean of Mon and Director
of Stern Hall, and Don Light,
Stanford sophomore and Western
Regional Director of the Collegi
ate Council for the United Na
tions, and is being sponsored by
the University and the CCUN.
