sits a structure with the unlikely
name of Harmony House. This
unlikely name is ironic as well,
because in this house faculty
members and students are work
ing on a project dealing with dis
harmony .
The name of the project is
"Studies in International Conflict
and Integration,” and is headed
by political science professor
Robert C. North.
IN FEBRUARY 1900 the Ford
Foundation gave the Conflict
Project $250,000 in order to en
large the research and training
program already underway.
Basically, the Conflict Project
applies social science techniques
from several fields to the study
of international relations. Moi’e
specifically, the faculty and grad
uate students working in Har
mony House have studied intent
ly the outbreak of World War I
and other crisis situations, and
are extrapolating from their
study a body of propositions
about international conflict.
An interim report of research
in progress submitted to the Ford
Foundation drew several tenta
tive conclusions. Perhaps the
most important one is that war
does not take shape as "an enor
mous contest of skill undertaken
as coolly and purposefully as a
championship game of chess.”
THE EVIDENCE that has
emerged from the project so far
suggests that “if a state’s per
ception of injury to itself (or
frustration, dissatisfaction, hos
tility, or threat) is sufficiently
great, this perception will offset
perceptions of insufficient capa
bility, making the perception of
capability much less important as
a factor of decision to go to war.”
Simply, “hard variables” such
as comparative strength in ar
mies, weapons, depth of re
sources, etc., are not the sole de
termining factors in a nation’s
decision to go to war. All of these
variables may be pushed aside if
a nation feels itself to have been
humiliatingly injured.

As if this were not serious
enough, the Conflict Project |
points out that decision makei*s
who consider themselves “realis
tic” deal solely with their own
perceptions and “perceptions of
perceptions,” and in times of cri
sis “the perceptions of the ‘real
ist’ are as subject to distortion
as those of anyone else.”
“IN SUM,” according to the
Project staff, “major decision
makers, in times of crises* tend
to formulate their decisions less
an the basis of calculation and
plan than most of them or most
of their constituents ever imag
ine, and are influenced more by
impulses, emotions, wishful think
ing and idiosyncrasies of which
they themselves may he scarcely
aware.”
Given, then, the nature and
I methods by which decision mak
| ers decide, how can one deter
| mine how wars really start and
[ how localized conflicts burgeon
into major wars?
j Conflict Project members are
I trying to arrive at an answer to
j this question by investigating, in
addition to the frantic days pre-
I ceding World War I, such events
| as the Bosnian crisis of 1908, the
I Arab-Isreali dispute, Japan’s at- s
tack on Pearl Harbor, and events '
of the cold war.
TII E INVESTIGATORS use
several methodologies, but all of
them share for comparative pur- 1
poses “a common conceptual
framework and set of highly dis-1
ciplined techniques.” This con- j
ceptual framework includes a J
complicated content analysis sys- j
tern, replete with computers and ;
IBM cards on which the investi- {
gators’ findings are recorded. !
Professor North and his associ-1
ates hope that by these disci- j
plined and systematic methods'
they will be able to predict fairly j
accurately and consistently the
probable reaction of a state to a 1
given situation.
Last fall, three computer runs j
were made which demonstrated |
to the investigators’ satisfaction !
that their methodology works.!
They are now in the process of
preparing further materials and I
of extending their conceptual!
framework.

sits a structure with the unlikely
name of Harmony House. This
unlikely name is ironic as well,
because in this house faculty
members and students are work
ing on a project dealing with dis
harmony .
The name of the project is
"Studies in International Conflict
and Integration,” and is headed
by political science professor
Robert C. North.
IN FEBRUARY 1900 the Ford
Foundation gave the Conflict
Project $250,000 in order to en
large the research and training
program already underway.
Basically, the Conflict Project
applies social science techniques
from several fields to the study
of international relations. Moi’e
specifically, the faculty and grad
uate students working in Har
mony House have studied intent
ly the outbreak of World War I
and other crisis situations, and
are extrapolating from their
study a body of propositions
about international conflict.
An interim report of research
in progress submitted to the Ford
Foundation drew several tenta
tive conclusions. Perhaps the
most important one is that war
does not take shape as "an enor
mous contest of skill undertaken
as coolly and purposefully as a
championship game of chess.”
THE EVIDENCE that has
emerged from the project so far
suggests that “if a state’s per
ception of injury to itself (or
frustration, dissatisfaction, hos
tility, or threat) is sufficiently
great, this perception will offset
perceptions of insufficient capa
bility, making the perception of
capability much less important as
a factor of decision to go to war.”
Simply, “hard variables” such
as comparative strength in ar
mies, weapons, depth of re
sources, etc., are not the sole de
termining factors in a nation’s
decision to go to war. All of these
variables may be pushed aside if
a nation feels itself to have been
humiliatingly injured.

As if this were not serious
enough, the Conflict Project |
points out that decision makei*s
who consider themselves “realis
tic” deal solely with their own
perceptions and “perceptions of
perceptions,” and in times of cri
sis “the perceptions of the ‘real
ist’ are as subject to distortion
as those of anyone else.”
“IN SUM,” according to the
Project staff, “major decision
makers, in times of crises* tend
to formulate their decisions less
an the basis of calculation and
plan than most of them or most
of their constituents ever imag
ine, and are influenced more by
impulses, emotions, wishful think
ing and idiosyncrasies of which
they themselves may he scarcely
aware.”
Given, then, the nature and
I methods by which decision mak
| ers decide, how can one deter
| mine how wars really start and
[ how localized conflicts burgeon
into major wars?
j Conflict Project members are
I trying to arrive at an answer to
j this question by investigating, in
addition to the frantic days pre-
I ceding World War I, such events

Near Bowman Alumni House
sits a structure with the unlikely
name of Harmony House. This
unlikely name is ironic as well,
because in this house faculty
members and students are work
ing on a project dealing with dis
harmony .
The name of the project is
"Studies in International Conflict
and Integration,” and is headed
by political science professor
Robert C. North.
IN FEBRUARY 1900 the Ford
Foundation gave the Conflict
Project $250,000 in order to en
large the research and training
program already underway.
Basically, the Conflict Project
applies social science techniques
from several fields to the study
of international relations. Moi’e
specifically, the faculty and grad
uate students working in Har
mony House have studied intent
ly the outbreak of World War I
and other crisis situations, and
are extrapolating from their
study a body of propositions
about international conflict.
An interim report of research
in progress submitted to the Ford
Foundation drew several tenta
tive conclusions. Perhaps the
most important one is that war
does not take shape as "an enor
mous contest of skill undertaken
as coolly and purposefully as a
championship game of chess.”
THE EVIDENCE that has
emerged from the project so far
suggests that “if a state’s per
ception of injury to itself (or
frustration, dissatisfaction, hos
tility, or threat) is sufficiently
great, this perception will offset
perceptions of insufficient capa
bility, making the perception of
capability much less important as
a factor of decision to go to war.”
Simply, “hard variables” such
as comparative strength in ar
mies, weapons, depth of re
sources, etc., are not the sole de
termining factors in a nation’s
decision to go to war. All of these
variables may be pushed aside if
a nation feels itself to have been
humiliatingly injured.

As if this were not serious
enough, the Conflict Project |
points out that decision makei*s
who consider themselves “realis
tic” deal solely with their own
perceptions and “perceptions of
perceptions,” and in times of cri
sis “the perceptions of the ‘real
ist’ are as subject to distortion
as those of anyone else.”
“IN SUM,” according to the
Project staff, “major decision
makers, in times of crises* tend
to formulate their decisions less
an the basis of calculation and
plan than most of them or most
of their constituents ever imag
ine, and are influenced more by
impulses, emotions, wishful think
ing and idiosyncrasies of which
they themselves may he scarcely
aware.”
