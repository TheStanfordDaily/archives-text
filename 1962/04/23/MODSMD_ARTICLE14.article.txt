It is widely rumored that sev-1
oral deans and administrators in
terpret the defeat of the proposed
constitution as the definitive in
dication of the unwillingness of J
students to assume responsibility. !
This interpretation is inaccu- 1
rate and misleading.
It could lead to the conclusion I
that since students are unwilling
to assume responsibility, liberal
ization of university regulations
is premature. That is, students do
not deserve a more liberal liquor
policy.
THE REJECTION of the pro
posed constitution was a highly
responsible decision for several)
reasons.
If, as some claim, there was i
not adequate discussion of the )
new document, the only response I
ble decision was rejection. Had I
there been more discussion, the I
constitution would have been re- j
jected two to one, for its many i
and fatal flaws would have been j
exposed more systematically.
The next constitution presented
to the student body, presumably
this autumn, should avoid the
flaws of the one just defeated. !

.Graduate students should be rep
! resented not in proportion to their
j numbers (40-50 per cent) but in
proportion to their interest (three
to five per cent).
THE overrepresentation of the
graduate students combined with
1 proxy voting would have under
! mined responsible student govern
i ment.
| In addition, if the next consti
j (ution proposes a 120-man legis
j lature, its increased size will have
| to be defended in greater detail.
Merely to say that increased
size will galvanize student opinion
and “should help control irrele
vant and repetitious debate” is
unsatisfactory. Neither hypothe
sis is self-evident, the latter seem
ing absurd.
THE PROPOSED constitution
(had other questionable sections.
I LASSU would have been able to
| recommend recall of any elected
j official by a two-thirds vote,
j To perpetuate this provision
I from the present constitution is
| a mistake. There is no need for
LASSU to exercise any such cen
| tralized coercive power. The Pres
j ident of HR or the Editor of The
| Daily should not be subject to the
j potential control of the Legisla
ture. The Editor, especially, must
be independent of political pres
sure.
Hopefully the next constitution
will permit students to vote a re
| sponsible “yes.”

It is widely rumored that sev-1
oral deans and administrators in
terpret the defeat of the proposed
constitution as the definitive in
dication of the unwillingness of J
students to assume responsibility. !
This interpretation is inaccu- 1
rate and misleading.
It could lead to the conclusion I
that since students are unwilling
to assume responsibility, liberal
ization of university regulations
is premature. That is, students do
not deserve a more liberal liquor
policy.
