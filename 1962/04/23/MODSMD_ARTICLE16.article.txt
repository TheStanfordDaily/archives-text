ACADEMIC FREEDOM
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduating senior and a
| recent participant in two Political
| Science courses here at Stanford, I
1 feel compelled to air my views
on the Department’s attitude re
garding academic freedom. First
of all I want to make it perfectly
clear that my criticisms are not
directed at the technical compe
tence of the members of Stan
ford’s Political Science Depart- j
ment.
As a history major it hardly
behooves me to pass judgment on
a department with which 1 have
had only a brief acquaintance; yet j
I do feel obligated and qualified \
to comment on the methods and:
biases employed by a number of
professors in presenting subjec
tive value judgments. The heart j
of any subject as imprecise as [
politics necessarily involves con-!
Dieting viewpoints, many of
which appeal’ bizarre but are nev- j
ertheless, under the aegis of aca
demic freedom, entitled to an im-,
partial and thorough canvassing. |
My experience with Messrs, j
Rogow and Bunzel have convinced
me that the Political Science De
partment here serves as a con
venient vehicle for the exposition 1
of a particular ideology, and that J
the methods employed by these!
I gentlemen in promulgating col-1
lectivism often involve ridicule, |
I slant, and innuendo, all of which 1
! are blatantly unintellectual and
quite at odds with the traditional j
! canons of academic freedom.
Ironically enough these keep-1
| ers of the liberal flame are the j
j very ones whose voices ring loud- j
I est for the unmitigated flow of all I
! persuasions, regardless of how!
! erotic or atavistic they may be.!
i Hypocrite is a pungent, oppres- j
I sively damning label, and I ap-!
proach it here with an almost cir- j
I cumspect trepidation, yet how \
else can one describe a teaching j
j method that on one hand bellows j
I with vituperative piety for un- j
I trammelled access to all points of
j view and on the other hand, by j
| either desultory allusion or out- j
j right omission, seeks to portray |
I political individualism and intel- j
i lectual enlightment as mutually
j exclusive ideals?
The "academic freedom” prac
; ticed by the Political Science De-1
| partment seems to be peculiarly 1
| selective regarding which view -
points are to be recommended on
| reading lists or tossed out from i
i the podium for undergraduate
I consumpt ion. A substantial
j chunk of political opinion, most
I of it conservative, receives only
| cursory treatment, although the
i historical peccadillos committed
| by men who lean to the right are
I held up for intricate and delicious
j scrutiny.
| It seems to me that men and
| women who sample the fare of
| Stanford's Political Science De
j partment and emerge convinced
! that the future belongs to the
] political left might base their con
| elusions on a more comprehen
| sive and fair-minded analysis
I than that presented in Political

FOREIGN STUDENTS
1 Editor, The Daily;
Your series of articles in The
Daily last week on the problems
j of the foreign students and the
j efforts being made to cope with
j them was highly illuminating.
However, after reading the series,
! 1 feel that your staff has over
looked one organization that is
making a significant contribution
to the efforts being expended on
the behalf of the foreign students
attending the University.
The International Dames Sec
tion of the Stanford Dames spon
sors a wide variety of activities
aimed at integrating the foreign
student family into student life
here at Stanford. Being a rela
tively small group, they have un
derstandably confined their activi
ties to that group of foreign stu
dents with whom they have the
most in common but which, in
many respects, is the most ne
glected group of foreign students
on campus.
THE DAMES' activities com
mence before the start of the

i school year when foreign families i
are met upon their arrival in the !
Bay Area. When possible, hous- \
ing is provided; and when none is
i available, reservations are made
at local hotels. The Dames also
engage in house hunting and pro
vide furniture, bicycles, and
household articles from their
pool for student families with
severe financial restrictions.
During the fall quarter, Dames
, invite foreign students into their
homes in an effort to become bet
ter acquainted, and foreign wives
are encouraged to join the Stan
ford Dames and to participate in
i their many activities. Transpor
| tation is provided so (hat foreign
! wives might attend evening
1 classes in English at local high
j schools, and small groups are as
! sisted in learning conversational
| English and the use of idioms.
Weekly coffees, which had been
held at the I center until the fire,
i have been continued in the homes
[ of Dames’ members. These infor
mal gatherings provide social
contacts between American and
foreign wives. International eve
| nings are held monthly during
j the winter and spring quarters in
the homes of faculty sponsors,
i Highlights of various cultures of
| the world are presented.
WHEN overwhelming problems
1 arise among the foreign student
i families, they often turn to the
S International Dames for help.
This fact points out the unique op
portunity which the Dames have.
! Because they are student wives,
| they are able to communicate
! with the foreign student families,
j and through their program make
j many friends among them, there
; by overcoming the barrier which
I often arises between the foreign
| students and the University ad
j ministration set up to help them.

GRAD STATEMENT
Editor, The Daily:
Having been called everything
' from power-hungry “manipula
tors” to apathetic, disinterested
| parties, and being blamed in some
| circles for the defeat of the new
j constitution, a statement from the
| graduate students seems to be in
1 order.
i In determining the composition
jo f the proposed legislature.
| LASSU decided that the standard
j of apportionment should be one
] representative for every 75 stu
dents. But since graduates make
i up 40 per cent of the student

I body, they were given 40 per cent
of the representatives on the new
I legislature, and many seem to :
! feel that this was too much,
j Why? Because graduate students
show less interest in campus gov
ernment. Apparently, they feel
that interest should be used ns a
! standard for political power and
! representation. Perhaps Scotty
I Thompson and other campus po
liticos should he given ten votes
j in each election rather than one.
' Or perhaps they feels that every
| voter should be given one vote for
! every activity of which he or she
] is a member. Clearly, population
| in the student body is a more ob-
I jective standard of representa
tion.
The only question remains as
|to whether the constituencies
j should be allowed to cast their
| voles on legislature as they see
[ fit. Should, for instance, the rep
resentative from Storey be al
j lowed to miss a meeting and still
cast her vole via the representa
tive from Lathrop? LASSU said
[ “yes” and wrote the proxy amend
j ment into the proposed constitu
tion, This system has three ad
vantages: (1) As noted, repre
[ sentatives may vote without with
| out being present. (2 > The system
j reduces the momentous problem
| of attaining a quorum for a 120-
| man body. (3) It reduces the size
j (and increases (he efficiency) of
j the meetings.
We sincerely feel that these
[ provisions in the proposed consti
tution were in the best interest of
the student body. We can only
i hope that they be included in any
future constitutional revision.

ACADEMIC FREEDOM

I do feel obligated and qualified \

FOREIGN STUDENTS
1 Editor, The Daily;
Your series of articles in The

j of the foreign students and the
j efforts being made to cope with
j them was highly illuminating.
However, after reading the series,
! 1 feel that your staff has over
looked one organization that is
making a significant contribution
to the efforts being expended on
the behalf of the foreign students
attending the University.
The International Dames Sec
tion of the Stanford Dames spon
sors a wide variety of activities
aimed at integrating the foreign
student family into student life
here at Stanford. Being a rela
tively small group, they have un
derstandably confined their activi
ties to that group of foreign stu
dents with whom they have the
most in common but which, in
many respects, is the most ne
glected group of foreign students
on campus.
THE DAMES' activities com
mence before the start of the

i school year when foreign families i
are met upon their arrival in the !
Bay Area. When possible, hous- \
ing is provided; and when none is
i available, reservations are made
at local hotels. The Dames also
engage in house hunting and pro
vide furniture, bicycles, and
household articles from their
pool for student families with
severe financial restrictions.
During the fall quarter, Dames
, invite foreign students into their
homes in an effort to become bet
ter acquainted, and foreign wives
are encouraged to join the Stan
ford Dames and to participate in
i their many activities. Transpor
| tation is provided so (hat foreign
! wives might attend evening
1 classes in English at local high
j schools, and small groups are as
! sisted in learning conversational
| English and the use of idioms.
Weekly coffees, which had been
held at the I center until the fire,
i have been continued in the homes
[ of Dames’ members. These infor
mal gatherings provide social
contacts between American and
foreign wives. International eve
| nings are held monthly during
j the winter and spring quarters in
the homes of faculty sponsors,
i Highlights of various cultures of
| the world are presented.
WHEN overwhelming problems
1 arise among the foreign student
i families, they often turn to the

ACADEMIC FREEDOM

the behalf of the foreign students
attending the University.
The International Dames Sec

i school year when foreign families i
are met upon their arrival in the !
Bay Area. When possible, hous- \
ing is provided; and when none is
i available, reservations are made
at local hotels. The Dames also
engage in house hunting and pro
vide furniture, bicycles, and
household articles from their
pool for student families with
severe financial restrictions.
During the fall quarter, Dames
, invite foreign students into their

1 Editor, The Daily;
Your series of articles in The

j of the foreign students and the
j efforts being made to cope with
j them was highly illuminating.
However, after reading the series,
! 1 feel that your staff has over
looked one organization that is
making a significant contribution
to the efforts being expended on
the behalf of the foreign students
attending the University.
The International Dames Sec
tion of the Stanford Dames spon

aimed at integrating the foreign
student family into student life

derstandably confined their activi
ties to that group of foreign stu
dents with whom they have the
most in common but which, in
many respects, is the most ne
glected group of foreign students
on campus.
THE DAMES' activities com
mence before the start of the

i school year when foreign families i
are met upon their arrival in the !
Bay Area. When possible, hous- \
ing is provided; and when none is
i available, reservations are made
at local hotels. The Dames also
engage in house hunting and pro
vide furniture, bicycles, and
household articles from their
pool for student families with
severe financial restrictions.
During the fall quarter, Dames
, invite foreign students into their
homes in an effort to become bet
ter acquainted, and foreign wives
are encouraged to join the Stan
ford Dames and to participate in
i their many activities. Transpor

ACADEMIC FREEDOM
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduating senior and a
| recent participant in two Political
| Science courses here at Stanford, I
1 feel compelled to air my views
on the Department’s attitude re
garding academic freedom. First
of all I want to make it perfectly
clear that my criticisms are not
directed at the technical compe
tence of the members of Stan
ford’s Political Science Depart- j
ment.
As a history major it hardly
behooves me to pass judgment on
a department with which 1 have
had only a brief acquaintance; yet j
I do feel obligated and qualified \
to comment on the methods and:
biases employed by a number of
professors in presenting subjec
tive value judgments. The heart j
of any subject as imprecise as [
politics necessarily involves con-!
Dieting viewpoints, many of
which appeal’ bizarre but are nev- j
ertheless, under the aegis of aca
demic freedom, entitled to an im-,
partial and thorough canvassing. |
My experience with Messrs, j
Rogow and Bunzel have convinced
me that the Political Science De
partment here serves as a con
venient vehicle for the exposition 1
of a particular ideology, and that J
the methods employed by these!
I gentlemen in promulgating col-1
lectivism often involve ridicule, |
I slant, and innuendo, all of which 1
! are blatantly unintellectual and
quite at odds with the traditional j
! canons of academic freedom.
Ironically enough these keep-1
| ers of the liberal flame are the j
j very ones whose voices ring loud- j
I est for the unmitigated flow of all I
! persuasions, regardless of how!
! erotic or atavistic they may be.!
i Hypocrite is a pungent, oppres- j
I sively damning label, and I ap-!
proach it here with an almost cir- j
I cumspect trepidation, yet how \
else can one describe a teaching j
j method that on one hand bellows j
I with vituperative piety for un- j
I trammelled access to all points of
j view and on the other hand, by j
| either desultory allusion or out- j
j right omission, seeks to portray |
I political individualism and intel- j
i lectual enlightment as mutually
j exclusive ideals?
The "academic freedom” prac
; ticed by the Political Science De-1
| partment seems to be peculiarly 1
| selective regarding which view -
points are to be recommended on
| reading lists or tossed out from i
i the podium for undergraduate
I consumpt ion. A substantial
j chunk of political opinion, most
I of it conservative, receives only
| cursory treatment, although the
i historical peccadillos committed
| by men who lean to the right are
I held up for intricate and delicious
j scrutiny.
| It seems to me that men and
| women who sample the fare of
| Stanford's Political Science De
j partment and emerge convinced
! that the future belongs to the
] political left might base their con
| elusions on a more comprehen
| sive and fair-minded analysis
I than that presented in Political
| Science 1 and 10.

FOREIGN STUDENTS
1 Editor, The Daily;
Your series of articles in The
Daily last week on the problems
j of the foreign students and the
j efforts being made to cope with
j them was highly illuminating.
However, after reading the series,
! 1 feel that your staff has over
looked one organization that is
making a significant contribution
to the efforts being expended on
the behalf of the foreign students
attending the University.
The International Dames Sec
tion of the Stanford Dames spon
sors a wide variety of activities
aimed at integrating the foreign
student family into student life
here at Stanford. Being a rela
tively small group, they have un
derstandably confined their activi
ties to that group of foreign stu
dents with whom they have the
most in common but which, in
many respects, is the most ne
glected group of foreign students
on campus.
THE DAMES' activities com
mence before the start of the

i school year when foreign families i
are met upon their arrival in the !
Bay Area. When possible, hous- \
ing is provided; and when none is
i available, reservations are made
at local hotels. The Dames also
engage in house hunting and pro
vide furniture, bicycles, and
household articles from their
pool for student families with
severe financial restrictions.
During the fall quarter, Dames
, invite foreign students into their
homes in an effort to become bet
ter acquainted, and foreign wives
are encouraged to join the Stan
ford Dames and to participate in
i their many activities. Transpor
| tation is provided so (hat foreign
! wives might attend evening
1 classes in English at local high
j schools, and small groups are as
! sisted in learning conversational
| English and the use of idioms.
Weekly coffees, which had been
held at the I center until the fire,
i have been continued in the homes
[ of Dames’ members. These infor
mal gatherings provide social
contacts between American and
foreign wives. International eve
| nings are held monthly during
j the winter and spring quarters in
the homes of faculty sponsors,
i Highlights of various cultures of
| the world are presented.
WHEN overwhelming problems
1 arise among the foreign student
i families, they often turn to the
S International Dames for help.
This fact points out the unique op
portunity which the Dames have.
! Because they are student wives,
| they are able to communicate
! with the foreign student families,
j and through their program make
j many friends among them, there

| students and the University ad
