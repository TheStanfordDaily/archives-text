## Washington's John Cramer Vaults 15-6½ 
### PETE KING 
Washington’s track team re
ceived a dose of Stanford’s power
ful depth last Saturday, as the
Indians outclassed the Huskies,
89-42, in a meet held in Stanford
Stadium. A total of eight meet
records were set, seven by Stan
ford.

Coach Payton Jordan got sev
ral fine performances from his
Stanford tracksters. Dave Weill,
Rich Klier, Larry Chukwudebe,
and Ken Emanuels all bettered
their best previous efforts in
winning their events.
Weill flipped the discus 189-6 1 :!
to better his old Stanford record
by a foot. Art Bachelder won the
.javelin with a toss of 228-I'L> to
break his own meet record set
last year.

KLIER, WHO HADN’T com
peted in the mile at all this sea
son spurted past Washington’s
favored Larry Seferovich in the
final turn to grab first place.
Emanuels sped around the track
in a fast 47.5 seconds to take the
440. He bettered his previous
mark by ,3 second.

The Huskies were favored to
finish 1-2 in the broad jump, with
the withdrawal of Stanford’s
Chuck Barth and Dan Moore
from competition. But Washing
ton hadn't figured on Larry Chuk
wudebe, a Nigerian exchange stu
dent who has played soccer here
and has been working out for
track for just three weeks. Larry
sailed 23-s*a on his first jump
and equalled it later to win han
dily.

Many of the crowd of 3300 had
some to watch Stanford's Phil
White and Washington’s John
Cramer battle it out in the pole
vault. Although White missed re
peatedly and finished at 14-6,
Cramer provided the crowd with
plenty of excitement as he grace
fully soared over the bar at 15-1,
15-5, and finally at 15-6’a. Follow
ing that, he tried for 15-10, barely
brushing the bar down on his
final attempt.

CRAMER’S VAULT was the
best collegiate mark of the sea
son. He is one of the most suc
cessful vaulters today using the
old steel pole. Many others, White
included, use the newer fiberglas
pole, which provides more up
ward snap for higher vaults.
The 77-54 score predicted by the
Stanford Athletic Publicity De
partment turned out to be on the
conservative side, as the Indians
pulled upsets in four events,
Harry McCalla, Card two-miler,
led a Stanford sweep in the 880
with an excellent time of 1:51.4.
Rich Parker and Jim Davis placed
2-3 for the Indians.
RICH CHESAREK ran a fine
anchor leg of the mile relay for
Stanford to win by 10 yards. Gary
Walker, Bill Pratt, Steve Cort
right, and Chesarek turned in a
3:18.1 clocking.
The victory puts the Stanford-
Washington dual track series at
nine wins for the Indians against
one for the Huskies.

PHIL WHITE KNOCKS the bar over in his last attempt at 15-feet.
White cleared 14-6 for second place in the pole vault in Saturday's
track meet with Washington.
Washington’s track team re
ceived a dose of Stanford’s power
ful depth last Saturday, as the
Indians outclassed the Huskies,
89-42, in a meet held in Stanford
Stadium. A total of eight meet
records were set, seven by Stan
ford.

Coach Payton Jordan got sev
ral fine performances from his
Stanford tracksters. Dave Weill,
Rich Klier, Larry Chukwudebe,
and Ken Emanuels all bettered
their best previous efforts in
winning their events.
Weill flipped the discus 189-6 1 :!
to better his old Stanford record
by a foot. Art Bachelder won the
.javelin with a toss of 228-I'L> to
break his own meet record set
last year.

KLIER, WHO HADN’T com
peted in the mile at all this sea
son spurted past Washington’s
favored Larry Seferovich in the
final turn to grab first place.
Emanuels sped around the track
in a fast 47.5 seconds to take the
440. He bettered his previous
mark by ,3 second.

The Huskies were favored to
finish 1-2 in the broad jump, with
the withdrawal of Stanford’s
Chuck Barth and Dan Moore
from competition. But Washing
ton hadn't figured on Larry Chuk
wudebe, a Nigerian exchange stu
dent who has played soccer here
and has been working out for
track for just three weeks. Larry
sailed 23-s*a on his first jump
and equalled it later to win han
dily.

Many of the crowd of 3300 had
some to watch Stanford's Phil
White and Washington’s John
Cramer battle it out in the pole
vault. Although White missed re
peatedly and finished at 14-6,
Cramer provided the crowd with
plenty of excitement as he grace
fully soared over the bar at 15-1,
15-5, and finally at 15-6’a. Follow
ing that, he tried for 15-10, barely
brushing the bar down on his
final attempt.

CRAMER’S VAULT was the
best collegiate mark of the sea
son. He is one of the most suc
cessful vaulters today using the
old steel pole. Many others, White
included, use the newer fiberglas
pole, which provides more up
ward snap for higher vaults.
The 77-54 score predicted by the
Stanford Athletic Publicity De
partment turned out to be on the
conservative side, as the Indians
pulled upsets in four events,
Harry McCalla, Card two-miler,
led a Stanford sweep in the 880
with an excellent time of 1:51.4.
Rich Parker and Jim Davis placed
2-3 for the Indians.
RICH CHESAREK ran a fine
anchor leg of the mile relay for
Stanford to win by 10 yards. Gary
Walker, Bill Pratt, Steve Cort
right, and Chesarek turned in a
3:18.1 clocking.
The victory puts the Stanford-
Washington dual track series at
nine wins for the Indians against
one for the Huskies.

PHIL WHITE KNOCKS the bar over in his last attempt at 15-feet.
White cleared 14-6 for second place in the pole vault in Saturday's
track meet with Washington.
Washington’s track team re
ceived a dose of Stanford’s power
ful depth last Saturday, as the
Indians outclassed the Huskies,
89-42, in a meet held in Stanford
Stadium. A total of eight meet
records were set, seven by Stan
ford.

Coach Payton Jordan got sev
ral fine performances from his
Stanford tracksters. Dave Weill,
Rich Klier, Larry Chukwudebe,
and Ken Emanuels all bettered
their best previous efforts in
winning their events.
Weill flipped the discus 189-6 1 :!
to better his old Stanford record
by a foot. Art Bachelder won the
.javelin with a toss of 228-I'L> to
break his own meet record set
last year.

KLIER, WHO HADN’T com
peted in the mile at all this sea
son spurted past Washington’s
favored Larry Seferovich in the
final turn to grab first place.
Emanuels sped around the track
in a fast 47.5 seconds to take the
440. He bettered his previous
mark by ,3 second.

The Huskies were favored to
finish 1-2 in the broad jump, with
the withdrawal of Stanford’s
Chuck Barth and Dan Moore
from competition. But Washing
ton hadn't figured on Larry Chuk
wudebe, a Nigerian exchange stu
dent who has played soccer here
and has been working out for
track for just three weeks. Larry
sailed 23-s*a on his first jump
and equalled it later to win han
dily.

Many of the crowd of 3300 had
some to watch Stanford's Phil
White and Washington’s John
Cramer battle it out in the pole
vault. Although White missed re
peatedly and finished at 14-6,
Cramer provided the crowd with
plenty of excitement as he grace
fully soared over the bar at 15-1,
15-5, and finally at 15-6’a. Follow
ing that, he tried for 15-10, barely
brushing the bar down on his
final attempt.

CRAMER’S VAULT was the
best collegiate mark of the sea
son. He is one of the most suc
cessful vaulters today using the
old steel pole. Many others, White
included, use the newer fiberglas
pole, which provides more up
ward snap for higher vaults.
The 77-54 score predicted by the
Stanford Athletic Publicity De
partment turned out to be on the
conservative side, as the Indians
pulled upsets in four events,
Harry McCalla, Card two-miler,
led a Stanford sweep in the 880
with an excellent time of 1:51.4.
Rich Parker and Jim Davis placed
2-3 for the Indians.
RICH CHESAREK ran a fine
anchor leg of the mile relay for
Stanford to win by 10 yards. Gary
Walker, Bill Pratt, Steve Cort
right, and Chesarek turned in a
3:18.1 clocking.
The victory puts the Stanford-
Washington dual track series at
nine wins for the Indians against
one for the Huskies.

PHIL WHITE KNOCKS the bar over in his last attempt at 15-feet.
White cleared 14-6 for second place in the pole vault in Saturday's
track meet with Washington.
Washington’s track team re
ceived a dose of Stanford’s power
ful depth last Saturday, as the
Indians outclassed the Huskies,
89-42, in a meet held in Stanford
Stadium. A total of eight meet
records were set, seven by Stan
ford.

Coach Payton Jordan got sev
ral fine performances from his
Stanford tracksters. Dave Weill,
Rich Klier, Larry Chukwudebe,
and Ken Emanuels all bettered
their best previous efforts in
winning their events.
Weill flipped the discus 189-6 1 :!
to better his old Stanford record
by a foot. Art Bachelder won the
.javelin with a toss of 228-I'L> to
break his own meet record set
last year.

KLIER, WHO HADN’T com
peted in the mile at all this sea
son spurted past Washington’s
favored Larry Seferovich in the
final turn to grab first place.
Emanuels sped around the track
in a fast 47.5 seconds to take the
440. He bettered his previous
mark by ,3 second.

The Huskies were favored to
finish 1-2 in the broad jump, with
the withdrawal of Stanford’s
Chuck Barth and Dan Moore
from competition. But Washing
ton hadn't figured on Larry Chuk
wudebe, a Nigerian exchange stu
dent who has played soccer here
and has been working out for
track for just three weeks. Larry
sailed 23-s*a on his first jump
and equalled it later to win han
dily.

Many of the crowd of 3300 had
some to watch Stanford's Phil
White and Washington’s John
Cramer battle it out in the pole
vault. Although White missed re
peatedly and finished at 14-6,
Cramer provided the crowd with
plenty of excitement as he grace
fully soared over the bar at 15-1,
15-5, and finally at 15-6’a. Follow
ing that, he tried for 15-10, barely
brushing the bar down on his
final attempt.

CRAMER’S VAULT was the
best collegiate mark of the sea
son. He is one of the most suc
cessful vaulters today using the
old steel pole. Many others, White
included, use the newer fiberglas
pole, which provides more up
ward snap for higher vaults.
The 77-54 score predicted by the
Stanford Athletic Publicity De
partment turned out to be on the
conservative side, as the Indians
pulled upsets in four events,
Harry McCalla, Card two-miler,
led a Stanford sweep in the 880
with an excellent time of 1:51.4.
Rich Parker and Jim Davis placed
2-3 for the Indians.
RICH CHESAREK ran a fine
anchor leg of the mile relay for
Stanford to win by 10 yards. Gary
Walker, Bill Pratt, Steve Cort
right, and Chesarek turned in a
3:18.1 clocking.
The victory puts the Stanford-
Washington dual track series at
nine wins for the Indians against
one for the Huskies.
