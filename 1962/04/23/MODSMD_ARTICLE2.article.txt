# Trial Period Asked To Study Results of New Liquor Policy
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG 
Leaders of the movement to
change Stanford’s liquor regula
tions proposed yesterday that
their new liquor policy be initi
aled on an experimental basis
and that the University’s re
sources he used to study inten
sively the results.
Believing that such a study is
not only desirable but necessary,
the leaders plan to approach with
their proposal Dr. R Nevitt San
ford of the Stanford Institute for
the Study of Human Problems,
and editor-contributor to the re
cent sociological study, "The
American College.”
WHEN CONTACTED by The
Daily, Sanford said he thought
such a study is a gofld idea.
According to the promoters of
the new liquor policy, including
Joel Meister, James Stewart,
Peter Lyman, Nils Wossell and
Dean Savage, discussion of the
new liquor policy has now broad
ened to include several important
psychological and sociological
questions.
Will a now, more liberal policy
result in more responsible be
havior? Will it reduce drunk
driving? Will it improve student
faculty relations and the campus
atmosphere in general?
The leaders believe that the an
swer to all of these questions is
“yes,” but claim they realize that
no one can be certain. They there
fore are convinced that a study
of the effects of the new policy
instituted on an experimental
basis would contribute signifi
cantly to an understanding of all
the problems involved.
“IS THERE any reason why a
research organization, such as the
Stanford Institute for the Study
of Human Problems, could not
undertake this study, on a pre-de
termined schedule, with its find
ings to be published, and the poli
cy then reviewed?” the leaders
ask.

Sponsors of the liquor amend
ment point out that they do not
advocate irresponsibility. “We ad
vocate a new policy which pre
sents its own challenges to the
student body. It demands more,
not less responsibility. Students
have expressed their willingness
to meet the challenges presented
by a more reasonable liquor pol
icy.”
