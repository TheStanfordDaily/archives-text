end.
In individual play, Choate shot
a two-under par 282 for second

STANFORD HAD a 590 to fin
ish five strokes ahead of the Az

in the top ten were Fresno 609,
Oregon State 610, USC 612, Col

Stanford Golf Coach Bud Fin
ger was understandably happy
with Stanford’s play, and in par
ticular was high on Choate. He
said of him, “Choate hits the ball
like Arnold Palmer. He’s one of

the finer prospects we’ve had a)
Stanford.”
CHOATE WAS IN contention all
the way for individual honors
until he hit two balls in the water
on hole 66. Even so, Lotz had to
chip in two halls from off the
green on the last nine to win.
Choate and Lotz will be re
matched Saturday when Stanford
meets the Spartans on tl]e San
Jose Course.
