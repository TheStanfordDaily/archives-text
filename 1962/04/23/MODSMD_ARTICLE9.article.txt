# Students' Horizons Extended

### PO CHONG MAR ASSU Foreign Scholar from Hong Kong 
(Editor's Note: This is the first
in a series by ASSU Foreign
Scholars on the Farm).

In centuries past, man was ne
cessarily confined to his native
province; his intellectual hori
zon extended no further than the
nearest mountain range or water
barrier. Today, through modern
communication and transporta
tion, these natural barriers no
longer exist for us because they
can be easily crossed, and people
from every corner of the earth
can come together, and engage In
the valuable exchange of ideas.
DURING THE course of the
year. The Daily has regularly
devoted a section of its paper to
the foreign students at Stanford.

These articles were meant to in
form Stanford students of the
various programs the university
has to bring qualified foreign
students to the campus.
Mentioned were the ASSU For-

eign Scholarship
| Commission and
I the IRR Ex-
I<■ha n g e Pro-
I gram. These pro
[grams were
[originally in-
I spired, organiz
| ed, and promoted
I by the Stanford
I students them-
I selves. The pro
-1 grams’ present
, success is truly
a compliment to

the whole Stanford student body.
It is fitting, therefore, that a
foreign student whose studies
here this year have been made
possible by the cooperative efforts
of the Stanford students offer a

few words. I happen to come here
as a recipient of one of the ten
ASSU Foreign Scholarships.
These scholarships are made
available through the contribu
tions of various university-affili
ated organizations such as Cap
and Gown, and through a collec
tion of a percentage of each Stan
ford student’s tuition.
OUB BOOM AM) board is pro
vided each quarter by a different
living group on campus. In this
way, not only are the expenses
divided but also it makes possible
a wider range of contact.
As I look back over the past
year, my debt of gratitude is
great. At my arrival in Septem
ber, I was met by a Stanford stu
dent and her family who very
graciously took care of me until
our program of activities began.
It is a privilege to be able to work
with the wonderful members on
the Foreign Scholarship Commis
sion.

In centuries past, man was ne
cessarily confined to his native
province; his intellectual hori
zon extended no further than the
nearest mountain range or water
barrier. Today, through modern
communication and transporta
tion, these natural barriers no
longer exist for us because they
can be easily crossed, and people
from every corner of the earth
can come together, and engage In
the valuable exchange of ideas.
DURING THE course of the
year. The Daily has regularly
devoted a section of its paper to
the foreign students at Stanford.

These articles were meant to in
form Stanford students of the
various programs the university
has to bring qualified foreign
students to the campus.

a compliment to

the whole Stanford student body.
It is fitting, therefore, that a
foreign student whose studies
here this year have been made
possible by the cooperative efforts
of the Stanford students offer a

few words. I happen to come here
as a recipient of one of the ten
ASSU Foreign Scholarships.
These scholarships are made
available through the contribu
tions of various university-affili
ated organizations such as Cap
and Gown, and through a collec
tion of a percentage of each Stan
ford student’s tuition.

vided each quarter by a different
living group on campus. In this
way, not only are the expenses
divided but also it makes possible
a wider range of contact.
As I look back over the past
year, my debt of gratitude is
great. At my arrival in Septem

dent and her family who very
graciously took care of me until
our program of activities began.
It is a privilege to be able to work
with the wonderful members on
the Foreign Scholarship Commis
sion.
