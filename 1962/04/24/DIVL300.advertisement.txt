Those binoculars that Key-Bell Cameras at 121 Stanford Shopping Center
have on sale are absolutely marvellous. Fred would not believe that such a
good glass cost only $23.95 and a 7x 50 too! I He paid five times that for
his and they are not as good. Key-Bell also have some movie cameras at
reduced prices so we are going to get one before going to Seattle—wouldn’t
it be silly to go there without a camera? After all it may never be repeated.
Did you hear about those automatic AGFA cameras that Key Bell are
selling? Fred says that even I could take a picture with one of those so they
must be simple to use.

Those binoculars that Key-Bell Cameras at 121 Stanford Shopping Center
have on sale are absolutely marvellous. Fred would not believe that such a
good glass cost only $23.95 and a 7x 50 too! I He paid five times that for
his and they are not as good. Key-Bell also have some movie cameras at
reduced prices so we are going to get one before going to Seattle—wouldn’t
it be silly to go there without a camera? After all it may never be repeated.
Did you hear about those automatic AGFA cameras that Key Bell are
selling? Fred says that even I could take a picture with one of those so they
must be simple to use.
