# Seattle's World Exposition—A Glimpse at the Future
## 
### PETE STEIL 
(Editor's Not* 1 : Tliis is (ho second of two
articles previewing the World’s Fair.)

Bring your camera. Even the 43-second
elevator ride to the top is worth the dollar
it will cost to reach the 550-foot level of the
needle. From the observation deck one can
view the full panorama of the snow-covered
Cascades and Olympics, Puget Sound and
Lake Washington, and Seattle, from its busy
waterfront to its changing skyline.
Theoretically, the Space Needle should
accommodate around 14,000 visitors per day;
which means that of the expected 10 million
people attending the fair, less than a quarter
of them will make the trip to the top. And
of those going to the top. even less will be
able to dine in the revolving Eye of the
Needle restaurant, for it will only be able to
seat 260 diners at one time.

Unless you enjoy standing in queues,
don’t attempt to go up the Space Needle on
a summer weekend. But if you like high,
wide, expansive (not expensive) views, Se
attle will always have them. The Smith
Tower, justly famed and previously the tall
est building west of the Mississippi, is open

daily. It’s only 288 spiral stops to the top of
the water tower at Volunteer Park. It doesn’t
cost a dime to ride the elevator to the top of
the Northern Life Tower, providing you
come by during office hours.
If heights bother you, don’t pass up the
view just because of it. You can still keep
your feet on solid ground and be 150 feet
lower than the Space Needle by going to the
top of Queen Anne Hill.
THE SPACE Needle is 600-plus feet high,
but its tripodal construction allows for only
three inches of sway. The $3 million struc
ture will house the world’s largest carillon,
which can bo heard for 10 miles in any di
rection.
Seattle’s Monorail is a magic carpet to
the fair. It is the world’s first full-scale rapid
transit system. With a maximum speed of 70
miles per hour, the Alweg Monorail trains
will travel the 1.3 miles from downtown Se
attle to the fairgrounds in 96 seconds. The
two electric trains riding atop twin concrete
beamways about 25 feet above the street are
expected to transport 10,000 passengers an
hour.

The Paul Moriuchi Mural is the largest
single work of art in the Northwest. The
enormous abstract design in ceramic and

glass tile will become a permanent feature of
the new Seattle Center. Designed and con
structed in Italy, it will be the center of
Friendship Mall.
America’s largest and possibly most spec
tacular municipally sponsored fountain is
one of the most breath-taking displays of the
fair. Basically, the $350,000 fountain repre
sents a gigantic sunflower, whose dome cen
ter contains 117 nozzles. The fountain sprays
will be “played” automatically in concrete
with the lights and recorded music as well
as in harmony with the carillon.
THE FOBEIGN FLAVOEED boulevards
of the world stretch through the heart of the
fairgrounds. Visitors can “circle” the world
in a few hours by traveling through the
thoroughfare of shops, concessions and res
taurants.
Natives never stop trying to prove that
Seattle is a friendly place to visit, and with
out half trying you’ll find native patriots
ready to sing the glories of what is now one
of the loveliest cities in America.
But at the same time, curiously enough,
you’ll find plenty of residents telling you
there's “nothing to do” in Seattle or Wash
ington.
Don’t let a native discourage you into

leaving after only seeing the fair. In Seattle,
follow any series of “Scenic View” signs and
you won’t he disappointed. Seattle is a water
city, and the waterfront is as good a place to
start as any, for it is here that Seattle’s his
tory and future meet and merge. Just head
down most any hill —you may end up explor
ing the waterfront on foot, or going across
the one-mile floating bridge whose pontoons
span Lake Washington.
The University of Washington is open
daily and guided tours are provided. Its won
derfully landscaped Arboretum, including a
Japanese Teahouse, is one of the nation’s
prettiest.
SEATTLE’S restaurants, whether atop
the Space Needle or on the waterfront, will
always provide an enjoyable atmosphere.
Seafair, from July 27 through August 5,
will be, by far, the most exciting week of the
summer, and probably the most crowded.
This s Seattle’s annual water festival, and
the week will be filled with excitement as the
city takes on a carnival air. Other points of
interest include the Seattle Art Museum,
Chinatown and the Government Locks.
You can get lodging for any period, ex
cept possibly the July 4th and Labor Day
weekends, if not in Seattle, within a 30-mile

radius of the city. The rumors may be an in
dication of the interest in the fair, but all
you have to do is write Expo-Lodging, Se
attle, enclosing the necessary information,
and they will do the rest.
A World’s Fair weather forecast is gentle
and pelasant—generally fair, with warm,
sunny days, cool night and occasional light,
refreshing “liquid sunshine.” Any native will
tell you that raincoats hang in the closets
for months on end.
If you possibly can, come early. There is
a definite saturation point, which will call
for closing the gates until enough people de
cide to leave the grounds. There are over 20
bus lines leading to the fair, and the time
and trouble avoided by parking the car away
will leave you happier in the long run.
Transportation on the fairgrounds will vary
from aerial tramway to rickshaw.
The total cost of the fair long ago passed
the $lOO million mark, but nowhere will you
be able to see more for $2. It is a big and
somplex show, yet the compact, 74-acre site
can be covered in as little as IM> hours, al
though the average visitor will spend at least
two days on the fairgrounds proper. And
likewise, the average visitor will spend $5.19
a day to see the fair.
