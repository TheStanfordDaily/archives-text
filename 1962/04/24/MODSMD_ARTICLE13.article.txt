‘NOT DIGNIFIED’
Editor, The Daily;
Early in the winter quarter
when Dr. Schwarz imparted his
insights on Communism to the
Stanford student body, I organ
ized a group of students to picket
his speech. The administration
prevented the picketing by apply
ing both direct and indirect pres
sure.
Mr. Miller tried personally to
dissuade two of the would-be
picketers. Dean Winhigler called
Bob Sayler and asked him to ex
ert his influence to prevent the
picketing because it “wouldn’t be
dignified.” Their combined ef
forts were successful.
The sequel to this story came in
the last week of the quarter when
the Daily stands appeared laden
with Dr. Schwarz’s propaganda
brochures.
President Sterling has assured
us that the winds of freedom still
blow at Stanford, but my own ex
perience makes me wonder just
how hard they blow. Perhaps our
motto for the PACE era should
read. “Die Luft der Freiheit weht,
solang sie nicts stort.”

AUTHORITARIAN
Editor, The Daily:
Although I do not mean to dis
parage the fame or notoriety with
which I have been gratuitously
presented, prospective voters
ought to recognize that 1 believe
in a rigidly authoritarian student
governmental structure, and, if
elected, would attempt to subdue
the popular will.
