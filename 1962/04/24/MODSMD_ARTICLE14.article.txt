support
Editor, Tile Daily:
We support the new "liquor I
petition" hut not on the grounds h
of one of the arguments that has |
been implied.
When it is suggested that thej
campus liquor restrictions should
be lifted because they are violated !
anyway, it could be equally well I
argued that murder should be le-1
galized because it is committed. I
Both measures would reduce the
crime rate!
We support the petition be
cause wo believe that the act of
drinking is not morally wrong
and therefore should not bo le
gally restricted.

SEPARATION
Editor, The Daily:
One point in President Ster-1
ling’s letter to Mr. Cohen (Daily, j
April 17( seems puzzling. Dr. I
Sterling acknowledges the assur
ance that “the purposes of your
organization (Forum for the Dis-!
cussion of Non-Violent Alterna-1
fives to War) are non-partisan in
every sense. In my mind this adds [
weight to the argument that your I
proposed activities fall within the I
sphere of the Political Union.”
Provided that this organization |
actually is non-partisan, is it de- j
sirable for both partisan and non- 1
partisan expression to fall under
the jurisdiction of the same gov- i
erning body? Since many of 1 ho j
issues that face students today
are broader than mere political
rivalries, I feel that these should
he considered separately from
such rivalries.
It seems that if groups intend- j
ing to present broader issues I
were to be combined with nar-1
rovvly partisan groups, the pur

poses of both would ho defeated
In my opinion, it is in the best
interests of Stanford students to
give the discussion of far-reach
ing ideological questions inde
pendent expression.
