# 68 Candidates File for ASSU, Class, Council Posts
## Aspirants to ASSU President Speak Up

Jim Andruss
Stanford students are called
apathetic. More correctly, Stan
ford student government has been
generally uninspired. The pro
posed ASSU constitution was an
attempt to correct this situation.
Though well conceived, the con
stitution was poorly handled. I
propose to draft an effective con
stitution reflecting overall stu
dent views.
CONSTITUTIONAL PROPOS
ALS: Expansion of undergradu
ate representation in Legislature.
Removal of ASSU president from
Legislature. Elimination of cur
rent confusion in the judiciary
without resorting to a student
District Attorney. ACADEMIC
AFFAIRS: There is a basic in
equity in the University’s grading
system. Stanford stands virtually
alone in grading on a standard
curve, resulting in poor grades
for outstanding students and lim
iting their chances for top gradu
ate schools. Dr. John D. Black of
the Counselling and Testing Serv
ice suggests adopting a “grade
distribution with B (rather than
C) as the mode.” The ASSU pres
ident should work closely With
faculty, administration and Leg
islature to determine the feasi
bility of adopting such a system
at Stanford. The adviser system
should be reevaluated.
HOUSING: Remodeling Stern
Hall, a coeducational Robert
Moore Hall, use of student ideas
in designing new Eating Club fa
cilities.

In the space allowed (200 words)
let me try to enumerate to you
a few points included in my plat
form and my oersonal qualifica
tions for the office of student
body president. The new consti
tution must be reanalyzed. The
judicial article calls for more rep
resentative selection of the par
ticipating members. Legislature’s
off-campus positions must be lim
bed and representation defined.
Fraternities must be given more
authority in those matters which
directly concern them. We must
evaluate the Gtudent Health Serv
ice, the present adviser system,
and the foreign student housing
problem. The honors and inde
pendent study programs must be
expanded. The Academic Affairs
Committee must be reorganized.
Academic freedom must be pie
served. Both the students and
members of the faculty must be
encouraged to state their beliefs
no matter how controversial they
may be.
I have been fortunate in having
a variety of experiences which I
believe have given me a good in
sight into the responsibilities of
the ASSU president. I would like
to relate to you a few representa
tive examples. I offer my exper
iom e as class president, an execu
tive cabinet member, Union Board
member, Political Union, a debate,
a house officer, author of the
“Undergraduate Class Constitu
tion,” President Oregon Associa
tion of Student Councils 111 and
membership on the Governor’s
Slate Committee on Children and
Youth (Oregon).

1 support the philosophy and
intent of the now constitution. One
basic reason for its defeat was
the short notice on which it was
presented. The constitution com
mittee should reconsider it, giving
attention to the specific sugges
tions which are listed below, and
it should be resubmitted to the
students as soon as possible.
Art. IV (legislative): I believe
that each house in Wilbur and
each of the four “back houses” in
Stern should have two represen
tatives in legislature instead of
one (section II).
Section IV, which allows proxy
voting in Legislature, should be
deleted.
Art. V (judicial): I favor the
provision defining the new limits
of the Inter-Fraternity Judicial
Council (section 111, clause d, par.
1). I favor changing the method
of selection of Men’s and Women’s
Councils (section 11, clauses b and
c); not less than fifteen candi
dates for each council should be
nominated by that council on the
basis of tryouts, and the two coun
cils should be elected by Legisla
ture. I fully endorse the spirit
and accomplishments of the stu
dent committees on housing, aca
demic affairs, and judicial affairs
which have been organized this
year under Legislature. I will
continue to support these commit
tees in their work of investigating
areas of student interest and mak
ing recommendations to the ad
ministration, and I will back these
recommendations with the full
weight of student government at
my command.

Student government will not
become of age until it spells out
Its rationale for existence. In the
past, student government has
either been apathetic and unim
portant or ineffectively rash. Re
cently there have been signs of
approaching maturity. Though
there are limits to student gov
ernment, before we have had
either no vision or set unrealistic
goals.
As students our main goal is
education. For this reason, I be
lieve programs of student govern
ment will have real meaning only
in so far as they relate to this
broad objective. Therefore, I be
lieve student government should
act as a sounding board for stu
dent opinion, a communication
channel between students, facul
ty and administration, and it
should try to gain a more effec
tive voice in administration poli
cy. It is rash to think we can dic
tate this policy. But I know from
experience on Political Union and
Cardinals Board that the admin
istration will respond when ap
proached maturely and intelli
gently.
Through such specifics as a re
evaluation of the strong parts of
the proposed constitution, an Aca
demic Affairs Committee to in
vestigate vital issues as the se
mester system, presidential ad
hoc committees to deal with cru
cials as the foreign student prob
lem, and a policy board of cam
pus leaders to channel programs
of topical concern, student gov
ernment can become of age.

Let me begin by giving you my
concept of the office. The job of
president is essentially two-fold:
To represent the Stanford body
in its entirety: and to be the lead
er of student government at Stan
ford.
Viewing the number of votes
cast favoring the adoption of the
new constitution, I believe we
are closer to realizing a student
government with a strengthened
voice in university affairs. I per
sonally would like to assume the
task of thrashing out the flaws
in the defeated constitution and
representing it to the student
body, allowing time for its care
ful consideration.
I have endorsed the New Liq
uor Policy. This is the kind of
student initiated action I favor
and would encourage. If elected,
I plan to throw the weight of my
office behind its adoption to in
dicate the student’s refusal to
have anything more to do with a
virtually unenforceable rule.
Among other issues: I favor
continuance of the student com
mittees which parallel those of
the administration, a true Dead
Week—not the present week,
dead in name only; and an ex
pansion of integrated dining. I
will attempt to revive the student
Scratch Sheet rating Stanford
teachers and courses.
1 am serious in my desire to be
your next student body president,
and earnestly solicit your vote.

Student government at Stan
ford appears to be in a state of
decline. The rejection of the con
titution and, worse, the small
number of students interested
enough to vote, shows that what
is needed is not a new mechanical
device but a new approach to stu
dent government.
In the past, student government
has failed to highlight issues, to
dramatize them to the students,
and has failed to adequately pro
ject the student viewpoint upon
the administration. The presi
dent’s first duty should be to
open and enlarge the channels of
communication between admin
istration and students. He should
explain his actions and viewpoints
in a weekly Daily article. Rather
than blandly accepting an in
fringement upon student free
doms by the administration, the
president should bring the pres
sure of student opinion to bear.
He should create issues and
arouse campus enthusiasm for
them.

In the past, too, student gov
ernment has been associated with
the petty regulation of every stu
dent activity and has failed to
give adequate responsibility to
those student organizations which
have proven themselves compe
tent and responsible. The presi
dent must see that the legislature
and the student financial manager
should not unduly obstruct the
activities of these organizations.
In a word, he should bo the true
leader of the students.
