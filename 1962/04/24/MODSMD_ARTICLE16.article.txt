The duties of the ASSU vice
president have traditionally been
defined as administrating and co
ordinating the social program of
Associated Students, and exercis
ing the powers and duties of the
ASSU president in his absence.
In practice, however, the second
of these duties has become the
least important.
I believe the vice-president should
plan and initiate social programs,
as well as approving the pro
grams of others. For the fresh
men especially, the vice-president
can be a source of ideas for social
functions. For upperclassmen,
she might maintain a list of fac
ulty members available to chap
erone parties and overnights. The
vice-president should work with
the Committee on Public Exer
cises to set up and maintain con
sistent criteria by which the ac
ceptability of student-sponsored
programs may be judged.
Next year, I think that the
scope of the vice-president’s duties
can and must be enlarged. As
Tresidder Union becomes a reali
ty, and as the facilities for cam
pus-wide activities become at last
available, the vice-president must
work with the Union Committee
and the Union Board to plan and
administrate a variable social and
cultural program for the Asso
ciated Students.

The ASSU vice president has
two areas of responsibility; she
serves both as a voting member
of LASSU and as administrator
and co ordinator of the University
social program.

Representing on LASSU no
particular campus group, the vice
president must consider the
varied interests of groups. She
must be aware of campus issues
such as the proposed ASSU con
stitution, which I feel has great
potentialities and should be
brought before the voters next
year after revision.
The vice president’s function as
social administrator involves pre
paring the social calendar and
approving and registering all
functions. I would also work with
the Tresidder Union Program
ming Committee in developing
the possibilities of the Union,
which should be used to integrate
and promote educational, cultural
and social activities without com
peting with individual organiza
tions.
If elected, I not only will exe
cute my specific duties, but will
also initiate actions to benefit
Stanford students and promote a
mature attitude in the continua
tion of overnights and the con
sideration of the new liquor
policy.

In the past few years Men’s
Council has not contributed as
much as it might have to Stan
ford men. It has in many in
stances been inconsistent, per
haps even unfair, in its treatment
of students who have appeared
before the Council for various
reasons. In some cases relatively
minor offenses have been punish
ed severely, while more flagrant
cases have had punishment es
sentially waived.

This is a poor way for a judi
cial body to operate. Fairness, im
partiality, tolerance, and con
sistency should be among the
principal aims of Men’s Council.
Prejudice and indifference should
never occur. Extreme caution and
thoroughness should be exercised
when a case is heard.
If elected to Men’s Council I
shall strive to emphasize these
qualities of tolerance, fairness,
consistency, thoroughness, im
partiality, and caution; I shall
work to establish a just system of
hearing and acting on cases which
come before the Council.

As a candidate for Men’s Coun
cil, I propose to support the ex
isting traditions of student dis
cipline at Stanford. Realizing full
well that sitting in judgment of
one’s peers is an awesome respon
sibility, and that it entails a lot
of time and effort, I am prepared
to carry out the job to the best of
by ability. If elected I will do my
best to make my decisions un
biased and independent of out
side pressure.
