Women s Council

To the women of Stanford; Ap
pointed this quarter to replace a
Women’s Council member who
was graduating one quarter early,
I have spent the last few weeks
learning what Women’s Council
does and thinking about what it
should do. Stanford women have
now a greater opportunity than
ever before for extending the
range and significance of student
government. I see it as the func
tion of Women’s Council to edu
cate the individual women, by
any method available, concerning
the desirability of and responsi
bility for upholding our social
system under the Fundamental
Standard. The Council, too. can
perform a valuable service as an
agent of communication between
students and the Dean of Wom
en. Therefore, I will always be
happy to discuss with any girl her
feelings about any aspect of life
at Stanford. If you share with me
a desire for a realistic and un
prejudiced Women’s Council, I
ask you to support me.
—Mavis Anne Bryant

The new social regulations
system, as we are evaluating it,
is a great success. Such a system,
however, can not be perfected in
just one year, but needs culling
down and simplifying into a co
herent policy. This takes time
and experience. It is important
that any girl understand the basic
philosophies which give rise to
the system, and the application
marie of those since it is made by
the girls and embodies a synthe
sis of their ideas and University
aims. For this reason, it is especi
ally important that a member of
women’s council go beyond just
knowing the rules. She must be
able to understand and deal with
individual situations as well as
conform to University policy.
The job is one of simplification,
explanation, understanding and
application of a just, clear inter
pretation of the social regula
tions. I am extremely interested
in working with this, and I feel
I could do a good job. I would
appreciate your support.
—Toni Williamson

Men s Council

My attitude toward student
government is not the political
idealism of the recently defeated
ASSU constitution. It is progres
sive, but it is realistic in that I
think through channels known to
be successful in a STUDENT
government.
With this way of thinking I
don’t feel I would make a good
student body president. I do feel,
however, that realistic thinking
is necessary in the office of
Men’s Council, and I also feel
that the office of Men’s Council,
through these channels, will be
strengthened in the eyes of the
administration. This is my car
dinal desire in running for this
office.
As a judiciary I strongly reject
any form of prejudice or snap
judgment. If elected I will hold
greatest respect for the responsi
bility bestowed upon me, and do
my best for the welfare of the de
f en d an t under consideration,
whatever the consequences may
be for that individual or myself.
—William W. Butler
To me the purpose of a student
judiciary group is to allow the
defendant the opportunity of be
ing judged by his own peer group.
The important point is that it is
a student council. I believe the de
cisions of the council members
should be made independently of
the dean’s office; otherwise why
have a Men’s Council?
I would like to see more minor
infractions handled at the living
group level. In this way prob
lems can be stopped before they
become serious enough for Men’s
Council. For those cases that do
come before the Council, I feel
the fundamental emphasis should
be placed on correcting rather
than just punishing the individ
ual.
—Bob Taylor

The concept of self-discipline in
student affairs is that feature
which makes Stanford student
life unique. The large degree to
which Stanford students are al
lowed to govern themselves is
demonstrated by the judicial sys
tem, of which Men’s Council is a
part. II is here that the adminis
tration has demonstrated most
completely its confidence in the
ability of the students to govern
their own affairs, by granting
them the authority to discipline
and punish themselves. Yet with
this authority goes the responsi
bility to see that it is properly
exercised. This is the function of
Men's Council. I believe that it
can best do this in light of the
following principles: Cases must
be treated individually, each judg
ed on its own set of circum
stances.
Flexibility, contained within a
framework of precedent, must
prevail. Above all, the student
judge must be impartial, seeking
to correct rather than to punish,
and to indicate wisdom in de
cision-making. It is to these prin
ciples, and to the acceptance of
these responsibilities, that I will
dedicate myself if elected.
—Peter Hoagland
I am not running on a plat
form of improvements advocated
for Men’s Council. I can only
slate what I feel to bo the cri
teria for such a body. Judgment
of guilt or innocence should bo
made on the basis of evidence
directly involved in each separate
case, not on the affiliation, repu
tation, or past record of the in
dividual or group involved. This
is tied in with the basic notion of
innocence assumed until guilt is
proven. Punishment, when meted
out. should conform as closely as
possible to the gravity and cir
cumstances of the offense.

To the women of Stanford; Ap
pointed this quarter to replace a
Women’s Council member who
was graduating one quarter early,
I have spent the last few weeks
learning what Women’s Council
does and thinking about what it
should do. Stanford women have
now a greater opportunity than
ever before for extending the
range and significance of student
government. I see it as the func
tion of Women’s Council to edu
cate the individual women, by
any method available, concerning
the desirability of and responsi
bility for upholding our social
system under the Fundamental
Standard. The Council, too. can
perform a valuable service as an
agent of communication between
students and the Dean of Wom
en. Therefore, I will always be
happy to discuss with any girl her
feelings about any aspect of life
at Stanford. If you share with me
a desire for a realistic and un
prejudiced Women’s Council, I
ask you to support me.
—Mavis Anne Bryant

The new social regulations
system, as we are evaluating it,
is a great success. Such a system,
however, can not be perfected in
just one year, but needs culling
down and simplifying into a co
herent policy. This takes time
and experience. It is important
that any girl understand the basic
philosophies which give rise to
the system, and the application
marie of those since it is made by
the girls and embodies a synthe
sis of their ideas and University
aims. For this reason, it is especi
ally important that a member of
women’s council go beyond just
knowing the rules. She must be
able to understand and deal with
individual situations as well as
conform to University policy.
The job is one of simplification,
explanation, understanding and
application of a just, clear inter
pretation of the social regula
tions. I am extremely interested
in working with this, and I feel
I could do a good job. I would
appreciate your support.

Men s Council

My attitude toward student
government is not the political
idealism of the recently defeated
ASSU constitution. It is progres
sive, but it is realistic in that I
think through channels known to
be successful in a STUDENT
government.
With this way of thinking I
don’t feel I would make a good
student body president. I do feel,
however, that realistic thinking
is necessary in the office of
Men’s Council, and I also feel
that the office of Men’s Council,
through these channels, will be
strengthened in the eyes of the
administration. This is my car
dinal desire in running for this
office.
As a judiciary I strongly reject
any form of prejudice or snap
judgment. If elected I will hold
greatest respect for the responsi
bility bestowed upon me, and do
my best for the welfare of the de
f en d an t under consideration,
whatever the consequences may
be for that individual or myself.
—William W. Butler
To me the purpose of a student
judiciary group is to allow the
defendant the opportunity of be
ing judged by his own peer group.
The important point is that it is
a student council. I believe the de
cisions of the council members
should be made independently of
the dean’s office; otherwise why
have a Men’s Council?
I would like to see more minor
infractions handled at the living
group level. In this way prob
lems can be stopped before they
become serious enough for Men’s
Council. For those cases that do
come before the Council, I feel
the fundamental emphasis should
be placed on correcting rather
than just punishing the individ
ual.

The concept of self-discipline in
student affairs is that feature
which makes Stanford student
life unique. The large degree to
which Stanford students are al
lowed to govern themselves is
demonstrated by the judicial sys
tem, of which Men’s Council is a
part. II is here that the adminis
tration has demonstrated most
completely its confidence in the
ability of the students to govern
their own affairs, by granting
them the authority to discipline
and punish themselves. Yet with
this authority goes the responsi
bility to see that it is properly
exercised. This is the function of
Men's Council. I believe that it
can best do this in light of the
following principles: Cases must
be treated individually, each judg
ed on its own set of circum
stances.
Flexibility, contained within a
framework of precedent, must
prevail. Above all, the student
judge must be impartial, seeking
to correct rather than to punish,
and to indicate wisdom in de
cision-making. It is to these prin
ciples, and to the acceptance of
these responsibilities, that I will
dedicate myself if elected.

I am not running on a plat
form of improvements advocated
for Men’s Council. I can only
slate what I feel to bo the cri
teria for such a body. Judgment
of guilt or innocence should bo
made on the basis of evidence
directly involved in each separate
case, not on the affiliation, repu
tation, or past record of the in
dividual or group involved. This
is tied in with the basic notion of
innocence assumed until guilt is
proven. Punishment, when meted
out. should conform as closely as
possible to the gravity and cir
cumstances of the offense.

Women s Council

To the women of Stanford; Ap
pointed this quarter to replace a
Women’s Council member who
was graduating one quarter early,
I have spent the last few weeks
learning what Women’s Council
does and thinking about what it
should do. Stanford women have
now a greater opportunity than
ever before for extending the
range and significance of student
government. I see it as the func
tion of Women’s Council to edu
cate the individual women, by
any method available, concerning
the desirability of and responsi
bility for upholding our social
system under the Fundamental
Standard. The Council, too. can
perform a valuable service as an
agent of communication between
students and the Dean of Wom
en. Therefore, I will always be
happy to discuss with any girl her
feelings about any aspect of life
at Stanford. If you share with me
a desire for a realistic and un
prejudiced Women’s Council, I
ask you to support me.
—Mavis Anne Bryant

The new social regulations
system, as we are evaluating it,
is a great success. Such a system,
however, can not be perfected in
just one year, but needs culling
down and simplifying into a co
herent policy. This takes time
and experience. It is important
that any girl understand the basic
philosophies which give rise to
the system, and the application
marie of those since it is made by
the girls and embodies a synthe
sis of their ideas and University
aims. For this reason, it is especi
ally important that a member of
women’s council go beyond just
knowing the rules. She must be
able to understand and deal with
individual situations as well as
conform to University policy.
The job is one of simplification,
explanation, understanding and
application of a just, clear inter
pretation of the social regula
tions. I am extremely interested
in working with this, and I feel
I could do a good job. I would
appreciate your support.

Men s Council

My attitude toward student
government is not the political
idealism of the recently defeated
ASSU constitution. It is progres
sive, but it is realistic in that I
think through channels known to
be successful in a STUDENT
government.
With this way of thinking I
don’t feel I would make a good
student body president. I do feel,
however, that realistic thinking
is necessary in the office of
Men’s Council, and I also feel
that the office of Men’s Council,
through these channels, will be
strengthened in the eyes of the
administration. This is my car
dinal desire in running for this
office.
As a judiciary I strongly reject
any form of prejudice or snap
judgment. If elected I will hold
greatest respect for the responsi
bility bestowed upon me, and do
my best for the welfare of the de
f en d an t under consideration,
whatever the consequences may
be for that individual or myself.
—William W. Butler
To me the purpose of a student
judiciary group is to allow the
defendant the opportunity of be
ing judged by his own peer group.
The important point is that it is
a student council. I believe the de
cisions of the council members
should be made independently of
the dean’s office; otherwise why
have a Men’s Council?
I would like to see more minor
infractions handled at the living
group level. In this way prob
lems can be stopped before they
become serious enough for Men’s
Council. For those cases that do
come before the Council, I feel
the fundamental emphasis should
be placed on correcting rather
than just punishing the individ
ual.
—Bob Taylor

The concept of self-discipline in
student affairs is that feature
which makes Stanford student
life unique. The large degree to
which Stanford students are al
lowed to govern themselves is
demonstrated by the judicial sys
tem, of which Men’s Council is a
part. II is here that the adminis
tration has demonstrated most
completely its confidence in the
ability of the students to govern
their own affairs, by granting
them the authority to discipline
and punish themselves. Yet with
this authority goes the responsi
bility to see that it is properly
exercised. This is the function of
Men's Council. I believe that it
can best do this in light of the
following principles: Cases must
be treated individually, each judg
ed on its own set of circum
stances.
Flexibility, contained within a
framework of precedent, must
prevail. Above all, the student
judge must be impartial, seeking
to correct rather than to punish,
and to indicate wisdom in de
cision-making. It is to these prin
ciples, and to the acceptance of
