# AWS Nominees
## 
### 
With the acceptance of the new
AWS Constitution, the AWS has
become an important potential
force as representative body of
the women students. I feel that
its real value as such will bo
determined next year; I should
like to be a participant in this
development.
In addition to her specified
duties, I think the vice president
can perform many of the routine
tasks which have overburdened
the president, this lending effi
ciency to the organization.

At the present, Stanford’s AWS
is practically non-functioning as
the voice of women students on
campus. AWS is improving: it
needs to be belter. We need a
forum for the discussion of social
rules and regulations; AWS can
and should be that forum. We
need an organization whereby
women students can present an
intelligent, consolidated opinion;
AWS can and should be this orga
nization. If elected corresponding

secretary, I will do my best to
help AWS fulfill these functions.
—Anne Osborn

During the past year AWS has
become a particularly significant
campus organization. The re-

cently adopted AWS constitution
which includes a new representa
tive hoard provides for direct com
munication with the women and
emphasizes a new role for the
organization. This progress of
AWS as a significant governing
unit is vital to Stanford women
since it is concerned with every
aspect of their campus life.
The AWS vice president has the
important capacity of adviser to
the president, and is also a mem
ber of the social regulations board.
More significant, however, is her
responsibility for organizing the
Fall and Winter Leadership Con
ferences. Thus the position calls
for a capable and sincerely inter
ested person. lam very interested
in doing this job well for the
AWS, and would be honored to be
elected AWS vice president.
