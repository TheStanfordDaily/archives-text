# Graham: UN Averted World War in Congo
## 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
The United Nations is a “moral
imperative in the Atomic age”
that has helped to cool off many
hot spots that might have started
World War 111, according to Dr.
Frank P. Graham, assistant to the
UN Secretary General.
Nations need the UN for guid
ance and restraint and eventually
sublimation of the savage nature
of absolutism of the national
slate, Graham told a Cubberley
audience yesterday afternoon.
In the evolution of states, the
next stage will either be a totali

larian world police slate or more
effective cooperation in the UN
for collective security, freedom,
justice and compassion, Graham
said.
He said UN intervention in the
Congo kept hot war out and very
likely prevented World War 111.
“IF THF UN hadn't gone into
the Congo and war had started
there it would have cost not $2OO
million but $2OO billion, and the
number of human lives lost would
be beyond calculation.” Graham
said, defending the U.S. part in a
$2OO million loan to the UN.
The extreme left in the world
and the extreme right in America
are in some kind of unconscious
alliance to destroy or at least
paralyze the UN. charged Gra
ham, now UN mediator for the
Indian-Pakistan dispute over
Kashmir.
World War I showed we lived
in the kind of world where a pull
of the trigger could set off a war
so that two million Americans
would cross the ocean and ton
million of the world’s youth
would bo killed, Graham noted.
WITH THE atomic revolution
piled on top of the commercial
and industrial revolutions, “wo
have come to live in a kind of
world where there can never
again by any isolation,” he in
sisted.
Isolation couldn’t keep the U.S.
out of World War I, and staying
out of the League of Nations
didn’t keep us out of World War
11, Graham said.
To keep the peace “the UN
must become a stronger organiza
tion;” it must have an interna
tional police force, a long-range
ecenomic program to stop pover
ty, illiteracy and disease, inter
national jurisdiction over space,
and effective universal disarma
ment, Graham advocated.
