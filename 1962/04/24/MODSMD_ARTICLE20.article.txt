# LASSU Platforms Told by Nominees
## 
### 
Class of 1965
Next year as sophomores, we
will no longer be residing together
in the same dorms. We will be
spread far and wide about the
campus. Some of us will move
into other dorms; others will mi
grate to The Row, while others
will forsake the Farm for off
campus living.
Whatever the case may be the
situation remains the same—it
well be more difficult to keep the
Class of 1963 informed of the stu
dent government’s activities. If I
am elected as your LASSU repre
sentative, I will do my best to
overcome this situation and make
you the best informed class on
campus.
—Fat Mahoney
LASSU has the mild functions
of minor decision-making and
“communication” between stu
dents and administration; LASSU
performs neither of these func
tions efficiently or adequately.
Naturally, student government
at Stanford should be greatly
strengthened if LASSU were to
carry out its functions effectually.
However. I feel student govern
ment can make its greatest strides
in the urea of formation of admin
istrative policy and philosophy.
LASSU can be made the means
whereby the student body can
voice as well-considered, intelli
gent opinion on important issues.
If elected as sophomore represen
tative, I will do my best to help
make LASSU a dynamic sound
ing-board of student opinion.
—Anne Osborn
Sfern Hall

Even with Its faults, the recent
ly defeated referendum would
have made more direct represen
tation of Stern men in LASSU
possible. However, under the
present constitution only two
men may represent all 640 Stern
independents. These two men,
therefore, have an important duty
to their constituents. They must
be articulate, experienced in stu
dent government, willing to work
hard, acquainted with the present
problems of independent living,
and be responsive to the opinions
of those they represent in order
to serve effectively the interests
of Stern men in particular, and all
the campus in general, during a
time when the entire basis of
student government may well be
questioned.
—Paul Klahaude
If elected to LASSU, I will rep
resent the Stern Houses to the
best of my ability and will always
act in a manner beneficial to
them. Although it is rather early
to speculate on the major issues
of the coming season. I will at
tempt to initiate drafting and
adoption of a new constitution,
which woidd ensure Stern Hall
adequate representation: I will
try to secure more physical im
provements for Stern Hall; I will
bring up the issue of co-ed hous
ing in the hope that campus opin
ion will finally affect the admin
istration’s decision; and I will
support any measures increasing
the effectiveness of ASSU. I in
tend to obtain the suggestions of
each Stern resident at least once
per quarter, both by visiting each
room and by attending the vari
ous house meetings, and I will
keep the men of Stern informed
about current LASSU issues by
means of a newsletter.
—Steve Stern
My election platform is based
upon a positive program for the
Stern Houses. I want to know
why the University administra
tion will put up large amounts of
money for fraternity clusters and
on the other hand grants only
token amounts for the physical
improvements of the Stern
Houses when both systems are an
integral part of the University
living plans. Why won’t the Uni
versity grant co-ed housing for
Stern Hall when the majority of
its members are in favor of this
plan? If elected I will try to find
the answers to these and other
questions and attempt to obtain
positive results toward their en
actment.
—Bill VVara
Lagunita
If any organization is to be ef
fective, there must be communi
cation among all its members.
Student government is no excep
tion. Communication is a two-way
process, requiring both efficient
ways to convey the information
from the legislature to the stu
dents and effective leadership to
represent the ideas offered by the
students. Communicative chan
nels cannot stop with Lagunita
as a whole court nor even with
each casa; instead they have to
carry the information to every
girl and provide her with oppor
tunity for expression. Admitted
ly this is difficult, but only after
we have communication can we
begin to debate the issues before
the student body. My platform is
simple: “grass roots” communica
tion two ways.
—Edith Brown

Men's Row
Stanford fraternities have a
strong influence on campus, but
their part in LASSU does not re
flect this power. It is important
that fraternities protect and fur
ther (heir interests by influencing
campus government.
For fraternities to exert this
influence, the two LASSU repre
sentatives must state the frater
nity positin forcefully and stand
behind it. I am able and willing
to do this job. By keeping in close
contact with IFC and the fraterni
ties, I will bring the full weight
of the fraternity system to bear
on LASSU issues.
—Bob Boston
Recently students who have
represented Men’s Row in LASSU
have regarded themselves as in
dividual fraternity members in
LASSU. My opinion is (hat Men’s
Row representatives should act
as a liaison between IFC and the
Legislature. They should attend
IFC meetings, reporting all per
tinent action of LASSU. and in
turn, act as IFC’s voice in Legis
lature. I believe I can give the
fraternities at Stanford the kind
of responsible repres en t at i on
which is imperative to the clear
presentation of their interests in
this period of changing conditions
on The Row.
—Jerry Jackson
There is at present no organi
zation at Stanford which can
truly say, “We represent student
opinion” no organization can
communicate quickly, effectively
and personally to every member
of the student body. LASSU must
perform these functions, but it
cannot unless it is truly repre
sentative. With slight modifica
tions, the proposed constitution
could attain these goals, and with
a little more work it could
strengthen not only the student
voice in general but also the fra
ternity system in particular.
Therefore there should be an
articulate fraternity voice in the
final changes. During the past
year I have come to realize the
great potential in the autonomy
of the fraternities, and as class
president I have seen the great
need for a reevaluation of stu
dent government. I would like to
put my experience to work.
—.John L. McCarthy
I consider the recently defeated
constitution a sincere and honest
effort to bring majority opinion
into LASSU. I think that student
government still has a place at
Stanford: I believe that the Leg
islature can be used as means
of affecting University policy
through the expression of student
views, as well as helping the stu
dents themselves through appro
priations to extra-curricular orga
nizations. If elected, I will do my
best to serve my constituency as
accurately and impartially as pos
sible, and will appreciate the sup
port of those who would like to
see significance given the actions
of LASSU.

If I’m elected I will have two
main concerns, (1) expanding the
social life provided by the class
and (2) representing the views of
our class to the University as a
whole.
I feel that the recently defeated
constitution is far superior to
what we have now as it would
give more power to the student.
To cite one case of the power of
the students, the liquor policy has
been passed by the LASSU three
times, each time being vetoed by
the administration. This is not
power. I will try to bring the
proposed constitution to the stu
dents so that they may discuss
and recognize its merits. It will
again be brought to a vote.
A good class is a tightly knit
one. If I’m elected I will tightly
knit our class.
—Charles Riggs
As a candidate for the vice pres
idency of the class of ’65,1 present
as my main qualification a desire
to help the class as students and
individuals in every way possible.
My main intention, however, is
to see formed a strong class unity.
After we graduate, we will often
remember that we are members
of the Class of ’65. Now is the
time to form the unity which will
hold us together as a class in the
following 1965. I hope that in
formal class get-togethers can
help to accomplish this.
—Jack Toney
Next year we shall suffer as
a class organization because we
are diffused among upperclass
houses on campus. In the past
many sophomore class organiza
tions have disintegrated in the
face of this problem. My plan to
unify our class in spirit is to form
a committee of one sophomore
representative from each living
group for enlisting support for
the Cotillion, parties, and dances
and for an individual class pro
gram at Tresidder. I offer you
my enthusiasm and interest. If
elected I pledge time and devotion
to your interests in the class of
’65.
