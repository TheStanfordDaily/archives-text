The senior class president’s
most important .job is to select
and co-ordinate the activities of
the executive committee. Among
other things the ex-com adminis
ters the Heritage Fund, Senior
Class Day, and (he senior happy
hours. It is my aim to select a
group of capable people who will
instill personality, imagination
and enthusiasm in their duties.
In addition, I would like to ex
pand the recently instituted cul
tural program. This program
would include a series of in
formative talks pertaining to the
opportunities available to gradu
ating seniors. In working on
Men’s Council and the ASSU Leg
islature, I have gained valuable
experience that should help me
in dealing with student govern
ment and the problems that
would confront me. I feel I have
the ability, the keen interest, and
the desire to merit the honor of
being your senior class president.
—Beaumont B. Blanch!
I am not running to change
Stanford or to solve campus prob
lems; nor do I plan to make bril
liant, radical reforms in the senior
class government. Such a plat
form would only deny or disre
gard the purposes behind class
government. Entertainment, ac
tivities and public relations for
the class are demanded, and the
responsibilities go to the class
government—or leadership.
I plan to add now social events
—both intellectual and entertain
ing to the regular schedule, and
to adopt new activities to bring
(he senior class to its new posi
tion as ‘‘head of the school.” Now
ideas and a strong representa
tive ex com should bring forth a
strong final year for ’63.
—John Bowman
The key to effective class gov
ernment lies in the composition
and accomplishments of the ex
com; this appears evident to me
after having spent a year on the
’63 ex-com. The first and most
important duty of any president
must thus be to choose an able
and experienced ex-com, where
each member is capable and will
ing to do a specific job well. Com
bining my experience with such
an ex-com, you could be sure that
you would know what the class
is doing, what activities it is plan
ning for YOU, how it is spending
YOUR money—in short, what it
is doing for YOU.
—John Fisher
My intentions are to provide
our senior class with the oppor
tunity to enjoy their senior year
as a unified class rather than
the collection of diverse interest
groups which we now are. I think
that by improving upon the pres
ent social functions, such as happy
hours, enough enthusiasm could
be generated to bring our class
together. I do not think this has
been attempted as yet, but I do
think that with the proper social
opportunities it could be accom
plished.
I would consider this, then my
responsibility as president of our
senior class: the improvement of
already existing traditions so as
to make them attractive enough
to generate the enthusiasm neces
sary to accomplish this unifica
tion. and to make it truly a senior
year worth remembering.
—Dave Henry
Although certain traditional
functions become (he duty of any
senior class president, I think that
tradition can be meaningful only
if it is imaginatively carried out.
Rather than class government,
the senior year requires effective
“class administration” to ensure
the success of its happy hours,
Heritage Fund drive, Senior Ball,
graduation, and future alumni
coordination. The senior ex-com
must be more than a string of
black faces on a page in Quad; it
needs enthusiasm, spirit, and the
ability to turn simple tradition
into exuberant senior-year activ
ity. My first and most important
duty would be the choosing of a
responsible yet imaginative ex
com. Following this, I would work
with the committee to produce a
memorable final year at Stanford.
—Marshal Turner

Besides putting on the Junior
Prom, the only OFFICIAL duty
of junior class government is to
save money for senior happy
hours. However, the talents and
interests of individual class mem
bers and the administrative or
ganizational complex of the class
officers and ex-com need not be
restricted to such limited and so
cially oriented activities. Why not
take advantage of the enthusiasm
of a large number of juniors to
work for a revised liquor policy,
to improve foreign student hous
ing, to raise money for Con
Home, to encourage cultural pro
grams, or to do anything else
which would improve Stanford or
benefit its students? Technically,
this has very little to do with
class government, but why can’t
the Class of 1964 accomplish
somehting CONSTRUCTIVE by
exploiting a potentially effective
organization?
—Jeff Ferguson
Student government was put on
trial last Tuesday in the form of
a new ASSU constitution. Its
failure to be approved by the stu
dent body is of major importance,
but what is of greater importance
is the reasoning behind its presen
tation. Admittedly, the new con
stitution had its weak points, but
its proposal demonstrates the
healthy initiative on the part of
some forty students to obtain a
stronger and more meaningful
student government. Its failure
to pass is due not only to some
flaws in the proposed constitu
tion, but also to the lack of effec
tive communication between stu
dent government and the student
body. This must bo remedied in
order that these two bodies may
work together and not against
each other in the future.
As Class of 1964 president I in
tend to formulate tangible ways
for the class as a whole to have a
more active and more powerful
voice in the affairs of student
government, and to provide a bet
ter system of communication be
tween the class members and
their elected representatives.
—Richard Hillman
The junior class is traditionally
committed to four things: the
Class Reunion, Con Home Week,
Bachelor Week, and the Junior
Prom. I would , like to see our
class go beyond these basic com
mitments. One idea would be to
sponsor an all-campus social ac
tivity, such as a beach party, an
idea that was considered by this
year’s junior class, but one which
wasn’t carried out.
Our class is strong financially.
To date we have $3600 to our
credit, which is $lOOO more than
last year’s class had at the same
time. By sponsoring concerts in
Mem Aud (such as the this year’s
Brothers Four), we can collect
money for the class. This money,
together with the profit we now
hold, can be used on big social
undertakings the class wants.
Withknowledge of the workings
of our class government and the
realization of some of the prob
lems that have faced junior
classes in the past I, Mike Saliba,
feel qualified to serve as president
of the Class of 1964.
—Mike flaliba
Since the primary role of a
class vice-president is that of a
social coordinator for the class,
my platform shall deal with this
“social aspect” of class govern
ment.
I wish to see class social life
take on a more dynamic appear
ance, and the apathy towards
class parties removed. I advocate
a more varied and informal social
program rather than one or two
“super parties” a year. I would
like to do more with the class
card question, the class reunion,
arrange some sort of spring beach
party and take a class opinion
poll to find out what type of
parties would be best attended.
—Mike “Pooch” Calhoun
As freshmen, we chose the goal
of class pride through class unity.
Although we have made progress,
we have fallen far short of this
objective; we do not have class
unity.
Up to this time the office of
vice-president has been an impres

sive sounding post with a few
defined functions. As a candidate
for vice-president of the Class of
1964, my main function would bo
to serve as coordinator of the
class. My plan for attaining our
goal of class unity will be to
establish effective communication
with every member of the class
through coordination, organiza
tion, and an efficient ex-com.
—Warren Berrie
Having worked on ex-com this
wear, I know that the Class of
1964 has a great deal of potential
and I would welcome the oppor
tunity to help with the develop
ment of our class during our
junior year. As class vice-presi
dent I would be able to work close
ly with our president and ex-com,
as well as with the other juniors
to organize both entertaining and
stimulating class activities, and
class sponsored all-campus func
tions.

Student government nationally
is not fulfilling its potential. At
Stanford the last year has been
a definite check on the tendency
of decline, but this is only a be
ginning. The class offices demand
people capable of hard, imagina
tive work if Stanford is to avoid
the failure of student government
at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia.
Sophomore class government
needs first an efficient organiza
tion to deal with the more mun
dane matters. When the basic
duties are competently handled
and dispensed with, sophomore
government backed by the class
it represents, must become in
volved with and committed to
positions on matters of vital im
portance like the housing prob
lem, the curriculum, the liquor
policy, PACE, and the Constitu
tion. I believe that student gov
ernment and our class can meet
these issues. That’s why I’m run
ning.
