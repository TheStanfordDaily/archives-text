## 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
Bob Overman rapped a three
run homer in the first inning as
Stanford edged San Francisco
State 6-4 yesterday on Sunken
Diamond.
The 400-foot clout capped a six
run first inning that left Stan
ford ahead for good. The Gators
chipped away at the lead, hut
pitchers Mark Miller, Jack Wood
and Jim Lonborg held off San
Francisco when it counted.

though touched for 13 hits. Stan
ford managed only six safeties.
San Francisco got an early one
run lead in their half of the first
on a pair of singles and a hit
batter.
However Stanford got that run
back in a hurry, capitalizing on
Gator starting pitcher Joe Chiam
parino’s wildness.
With one out, Chiamparino
walked Greg Post and Rich Fer
razzano. Boh Hollman singled up
the middle to drive in Post, who
had stolen second and third.
Ferrazano scored when center
fielder Joe Panella’s throw went
over the Gator catcher’s head.
Chiamparino hit Jim Chenu
with a pitch and Warren Newell
singled in Hollman, all this still
with only one out.
Joel Shulman Hied out to left
field for the second out, but Boh

Overman rapped a line drive to
left confer field that went up the
bank. By the time Gator left field
er Jerry Collins got the ball back
to the infield, Overman had
scored standing up and Stanford
was ahead, 6-1. .
Starting Card hinder Miller re
tired with a sore arm at the top
of the third inning, and Wood
held San Francisco to a pair of
runs in his five innings. Lonborg
pitched two scoreless innings.
Actually, the Gators had the go
ahead run at bat in the ninth in
ning, but Lonborg induced a
ground ball to Joel Shulman, and
the Card shortstop started a force
out to end the game.
