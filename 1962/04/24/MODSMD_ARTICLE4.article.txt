# Simple New Voting Machines Eliminate Election Problems
## 
### 
For the first time in Stanford’s
political history, a graduate stu
dent has declared that he will
campaign for ASSU President.
Armin Rosencranz, a graduate
student in law and teaching as
sistant in political science, has
been drafted to run on a write-in
ticket to lead campus politics.
NEVER before have voting ma
chines been used in the primary
elections. The polls will be open
tomorrow from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.
and 7 to 9 p.m., and on Thursday
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The voting machines will be set
up in the corridors on each side
of Cubberley Auditorium. The ma
chines for men will be in the cor
ridor to the left of the lobby, and

the machines for women will be
to the right. One machine for
each class will be in both corri
dors. Graduate students will vote
on the same machines as the
Seniors.
STUDENTS should be familiar
with the voting method, as any
mistake might cause the vote not
to register. In addition to the fol
lowing instructions, sample bal
dots for each machine and full in
structions will be at the polls.
Model machines will be used to
demonstrate the voting proce
dure. Members of Elections Com
will also be available at the polls
to answer any additional ques
tions.


THIS IS a voting machine. There are instructions in The Daily. The instructions are simple. Any idiot
can operate a voting machine. Vote tomorrow and Thursday.
