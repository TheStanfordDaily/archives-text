# Stanford Players To Present Farce
## 
### BILL SMITH 
There is not so much humor
and fun in the world that a per
son should miss an opportunity
to enjoy a little.
One of the most enjoyable pro
ductions, from the audience’s
viewpoint, ever to bo presented
at Stanford will open April 25 in
the Little Theater. It is the Stan
ford Players’ production of “The
Three Cuckolds.”
The setting is Italy in the 16th
century. Wendall Colo has de
signed the sot, which is a street
in an Italian town with a stage
set up on it. as one would have
found in the 6th century.
Klaus Strassmann, a doctoral
candidate in Drama, is directing
the production. Strassmann has
tried to get away from the hyper
seriousness of modern theater in
presenting this 16th century
farce. There is no moral nor mes
sage offered to the audience.
The play is for escapist pur
poses. It is designed to show peo
ple in some of their more ridicu
lous lights, and to provide the
audience with an opportunity to
compare themselves with people
more nutty than themselves. It is
a typical Commedia Dell’arte.
Commedia does not emphasize

the literary aspects of the the
ater, but rather the performing
parts. Commedia is very physical
and was born out of an amalga
mation of theater and acrobatics.
Hence, the humor comes from
situation and action more than
from lines, although playwright
Loon Katz’s dialogue is spiced
with wit.
Theater of this type depends on
the actors to a greater extent
than does modern theater. Ama
teurs have a constant problem to
get it up to an acceptable level,
and those in this production have
reached that level, at least in re
hearsal.
The story of "The Three Cuck
olds” centers on the vagabond
Arlecchino who becomes involved
in the love intrigues of three cou
ples. The couples are made up of
young women who are married
to men a great deal older than
themselves and who become in
volved with one another’s hus
bands.
Tickets are on sale at Memorial
bov office and are priced at $1.50
for Wednesday and Thursday
nights and $2 for Friday and Sat
urday nights. There is a 50-cent
discount for Stanford students on
i all tickets.
