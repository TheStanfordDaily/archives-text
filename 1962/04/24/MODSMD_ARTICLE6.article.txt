# Dean of Men Craig Calls New Student Liquor Plan 'Timely'
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
Dean of Men William G. Craig said yesterday in a statement
to The Daily that “the present liquor regulations at Stanford arc
unrealistic and unenforceable.” He also said the present “liquor
petition,” which calls for a liberalization of the University’s liquor
policy, “is timely.” Dean of Women Lucile A. Allen says she

probably will state her views-t
soon.
ANOTHER principal factor in
the complicated play, R. Nevitt
Sanford of the Institute for the
Study of Human Problems, told
student initiators of the liquor
movement that the Institute is
very interested in the students’
proposal to put the new liquor
policy on an experimental basis.
“Naturally we are interested
in this, and would be interested
in producing relevant facts,” San
ford said. “We would maintain
the usual scientific objectivity
and would not participate in the
policy making. The facts would
be available to all concerned.”
Sanford said the kind of issues
raised by the Stanford liquor
question “hold for the whole so
ciety.” He also said that if the
study is to be made, members of
the Institute “would have to get
busy quickly.” The fate of the
proposed experiment now rests in
the hands of the Administration.
IN THE remainder of his state
ment, Craig said the Committee
on Student Affairs has been
studying the liquor problem for
some time.
“On March 8, 1962, I recom
mended to the Committee a
change in present regulations
which would require less Univer
sity policing and more responsi
bility on the part of students and
their government in the applica
tion of reason to a serious prob
lem on the campus,” he said.
Craig concluded his statement
with a word about responsibility:
“The crux of the matter under
any circumstances is the degree
to which students fulfill their ob
ligations to uphold fundamental
standards of behavior.”
