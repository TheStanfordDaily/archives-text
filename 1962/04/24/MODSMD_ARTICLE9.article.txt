# Conflict Searches for Decision-Making Pattern

Having devised a complicated
content analysis system, members
of the Conflict Project are at
tempting to determine how and
why states decide to remain at
peace or go to war. Most of their
investigation has been concerned
with the Bosnian crisis of 1908,
the chaotic, tense days preceding
World War I, and the events in
the Sino-Soviet controversy.
THEIR DECISION to begin in
vestigation with the crises of 1908
and 1914 was based in part upon
the relative availability of pri
mary documentation for these
two conflicts. For contemporary
conflicts, of course, no archival
material is available. Consequent
ly, they are forced to squeeze in
formation out of public state
ments and other material made
available by the various govern
ments.
Public statements, of course,
may he misleading since they do
not necessarily reveal a state’s
intentions. The Project’s investi
gators think, however, “that hu
man beings betray their feelings
and altitudes far more than they
realize not only by what they
say but by the way they say it.
We are somewhat heartened,
therefore, by the possibilities for
semantic analysis of even the
routine and day-to-day statements
of the world’s public figures.”
After the investigators gather
these materials, they search them
for clues about each state’s “per
ceptions of the changing environ
ment, each state’s purposes or
goals, and each state’s choices or
pattern of decision-making.”
THIS SEARCH has led to cer
tain conclusions which should be
kept in mind when one is analyz
ing the current East-West dispute.
Perhaps the most important con
clusion is that so-called “hard
variables,” such as Gross National
Product and numbers of troops,
planes, or megatons count for
much less in a state’s decision to
go to war than is normally as
sumed.
To quote at length from an in
terim report compiled by the
Project, “Actually, in making
choices between various alterna
tives—in deciding between war
and peace, for example—the ‘real’
world and the ‘real’ quantities are
not the great ‘realities’ at all.
“ . . . Even the hardest-headed
decision-maker has no touch with
his environment at all except
through two filters, so to speak:

the filter of his senses . . . and
the filter of his experience. In
these terms, then, the ‘real’ world
of decision-making is not neces
sarily what the ‘realist’ accepts
as . . . ‘objective.’ ”
The report goes on to say that
t he decision-makers’ “real” world
is, as for everyone else, the “per
ceptual” world. This means that
the crucial variables in a conflict
situation “are quite as likely to
he ‘perceptual’ as hard and vari
able.”
FOEITICAE SCIENCE profes
sor Robert C. North, head of the
Conflict Project, and his associ
ates have also learned that there
is a “self-feeding” hostility inter
change between states.
For instance, if State A per
ceives either correctly or incor
rectly a high level of threat to it
self from State B, there is a
strong possibility of subsequent
hostile output on A’s part. When
State B then correctly perceives
A’s hostility, it is likely that B,
too, will produce policy state
ments of high hostility content.
As one can readily see, the re
sult of this “self-feeding” hostili
ty Interchange is more and more
conflict, enhancing (he chances of
a major war, despite “realistic"
considerations of “hard vari
ables.”
HOW CAN this hostility inter
change be broken? The Conflict
Report says that inter-group be
havior studies suggest that con
flicts between small groups are
best reduced “by the introduction
of goals . . . which are strongly
shared by members of both sides
and which require, for their ful
fillment. the cooperative efforts
of all. There is no reason to be
lieve that a similar hypothesis
would be inappropriate for rela
tions between states.”
Convinced that their method
ology works, the Conflict Proj
ect’s investigators are now pre
paring further materials and are
extending their conceptual frame
work. At present they are analyz
ing carefully the Sino-Soviet dis
pute, hoping to find out just how
serious this dispute is.
Professor North does not claim
that predictions made on the basis
of the Project’s investigations will
be anywhere near 100 per cent
accurate. On the other hand, Pro
fessor North says, since govern
ments have to make predictions
anyway, they may as well make
them on the basis of the most
careful methods of investigation
available, thereby lessening the
chances of catastrophic error in
judgment.
