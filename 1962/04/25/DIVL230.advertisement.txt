In this column today let us make a quick survey of English
poetry. When we speak of English poetry, we are, of course,
speaking of Byron, Shelley, and Keats. Some say that of the
three, Keats was the most talented. It is true that he displayed
his gifts earlier than the others. While still a schoolboy at St.
Swithin’s he wrote his epic lines:
If I am good, I gel an apple,
So I don’t ■whistle in the chapel.
From this distinguished beginning, he went on to write an
other 40,(KM) poems in his lifetime—which is all the more
remarkable when you consider that he was only five feet tall!
I mention this fact only to show that physical problems never
keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for example, was
lame. Shelley had an ingrown hair. Nonetheless, these three
titans of literature turned out a veritable torrent of romantic
poetry.
Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil
with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping Elizabeth
Barrett’s pigtails in an inkwell. He thereupon left England to
fight in the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and
well, but women were never far from his mind, as evidenced by
this immortal poem:
How splendid it is to fight for the Greek,
Bid I don’t enjoy it half ns much as dancing cheek to check.
While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley remained in England,
where he became court poet to the Duke of Marlborough. (It
is interesting to note in passing that Marlborough was the origi
nal spelling of Marlboro Cigarettes, but the makers were unable
to get the entire word on the package. With characteristic in
genuity they cleverly lopped off the final “gh”. This, of course,
left them with a “gh” lying around the factory. They looked
for some place to put it and finally decided to give it to the
Director of Sales, Mr. Vincent Nan Go. This had a rather curious
result. As plain Van Go, he had been a crackerjack director of
sales, but once he became Van Gogh, he felt a mysterious,
irresistible urge to paint. He resigned from the Company and
became an artist. It did not work out too well. When Van ()ogh
learned what a great success Marlboro Cigarettes quickly be
came—as, of course, they had to with such a flavorful flavor,
such a filterful filter, such a flip-top box, such a soft pack—he
was so upset about leaving the firm that he cut off his ear in a
fit of chagrin.)
But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Italy and Shelley in
England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to grow. Who
does not remember his wistful lyric:
Although 1 am only five feet high,
Some day I will look in an elephant’s eye.
But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This too
failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies’ man, took up with Lucrezia
Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley. Shelley, a more
domestic type, stayed home with his wife Mary, and wrote his
famous poem:
I love to slay home with the missus and write,
And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.
Mary Shelley finally got so tired of being bitten that she went
into another room and wrote Frankenstein. Upon reading the
manuscript, Shelley and Byron got so scared they immediately
booked passage home to England. Keats tried to go too, but
he was so small that the clerk at the steamship office couldn't
see him over the top of the counter. So Keats remained in Rome
and died of a broken heart.
Byron and Shelley cried a lot and then together composed
this immortal epitaph:
Good old Kents, he might have been short,
But he was a great American and a heck of a good sport.
Truth, not poetry, is the business of the Marlboro makers,
and ire tell you truly that you can't find a belter fasting,
belter smoking cigarette than today’s Marlboro.

for some place to put it and finally decided to give it to the
Director of Sales, Mr. Vincent Nan Go. This had a rather curious
result. As plain Van Go, he had been a crackerjack director of
sales, but once he became Van Gogh, he felt a mysterious,
irresistible urge to paint. He resigned from the Company and
became an artist. It did not work out too well. When Van ()ogh
learned what a great success Marlboro Cigarettes quickly be
came—as, of course, they had to with such a flavorful flavor,
such a filterful filter, such a flip-top box, such a soft pack—he
was so upset about leaving the firm that he cut off his ear in a
fit of chagrin.)
But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Italy and Shelley in
England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to grow. Who
does not remember his wistful lyric:
Although 1 am only five feet high,
Some day I will look in an elephant’s eye.
But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This too
failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies’ man, took up with Lucrezia
Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley. Shelley, a more
domestic type, stayed home with his wife Mary, and wrote his
famous poem:
I love to slay home with the missus and write,
And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.
Mary Shelley finally got so tired of being bitten that she went
into another room and wrote Frankenstein. Upon reading the
manuscript, Shelley and Byron got so scared they immediately
booked passage home to England. Keats tried to go too, but
he was so small that the clerk at the steamship office couldn't
see him over the top of the counter. So Keats remained in Rome
and died of a broken heart.
Byron and Shelley cried a lot and then together composed
this immortal epitaph:
Good old Kents, he might have been short,
But he was a great American and a heck of a good sport.
Truth, not poetry, is the business of the Marlboro makers,

belter smoking cigarette than today’s Marlboro.

CRAM COURSE No. 3: ENGLISH POETRY

In this column today let us make a quick survey of English
poetry. When we speak of English poetry, we are, of course,
speaking of Byron, Shelley, and Keats. Some say that of the
three, Keats was the most talented. It is true that he displayed
his gifts earlier than the others. While still a schoolboy at St.
Swithin’s he wrote his epic lines:
If I am good, I gel an apple,
So I don’t ■whistle in the chapel.
From this distinguished beginning, he went on to write an
other 40,(KM) poems in his lifetime—which is all the more
remarkable when you consider that he was only five feet tall!
I mention this fact only to show that physical problems never
keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for example, was
lame. Shelley had an ingrown hair. Nonetheless, these three
titans of literature turned out a veritable torrent of romantic
poetry.
Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil
with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping Elizabeth
Barrett’s pigtails in an inkwell. He thereupon left England to
fight in the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and
well, but women were never far from his mind, as evidenced by
this immortal poem:
How splendid it is to fight for the Greek,
Bid I don’t enjoy it half ns much as dancing cheek to check.
While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley remained in England,
where he became court poet to the Duke of Marlborough. (It
is interesting to note in passing that Marlborough was the origi
nal spelling of Marlboro Cigarettes, but the makers were unable
to get the entire word on the package. With characteristic in
genuity they cleverly lopped off the final “gh”. This, of course,
left them with a “gh” lying around the factory. They looked

CRAM COURSE No. 3: ENGLISH POETRY
Final exams will soon be upon us. This is no time for fun and
games. Let us instead study hard, cram fiercely, prepare assidu-
In this column today let us make a quick survey of English
poetry. When we speak of English poetry, we are, of course,
speaking of Byron, Shelley, and Keats. Some say that of the
three, Keats was the most talented. It is true that he displayed
his gifts earlier than the others. While still a schoolboy at St.
Swithin’s he wrote his epic lines:
If I am good, I gel an apple,
So I don’t ■whistle in the chapel.
From this distinguished beginning, he went on to write an
other 40,(KM) poems in his lifetime—which is all the more
remarkable when you consider that he was only five feet tall!
I mention this fact only to show that physical problems never
keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for example, was
lame. Shelley had an ingrown hair. Nonetheless, these three
titans of literature turned out a veritable torrent of romantic
poetry.
Nor did they neglect their personal lives. Byron, a devil
with the ladies, was expelled from Oxford for dipping Elizabeth
Barrett’s pigtails in an inkwell. He thereupon left England to
fight in the Greek war of independence. He fought bravely and
well, but women were never far from his mind, as evidenced by
this immortal poem:
How splendid it is to fight for the Greek,
Bid I don’t enjoy it half ns much as dancing cheek to check.
While Byron fought in Greece, Shelley remained in England,
where he became court poet to the Duke of Marlborough. (It
is interesting to note in passing that Marlborough was the origi
nal spelling of Marlboro Cigarettes, but the makers were unable
to get the entire word on the package. With characteristic in
genuity they cleverly lopped off the final “gh”. This, of course,
left them with a “gh” lying around the factory. They looked
for some place to put it and finally decided to give it to the
Director of Sales, Mr. Vincent Nan Go. This had a rather curious
result. As plain Van Go, he had been a crackerjack director of
sales, but once he became Van Gogh, he felt a mysterious,
irresistible urge to paint. He resigned from the Company and
became an artist. It did not work out too well. When Van ()ogh
learned what a great success Marlboro Cigarettes quickly be
came—as, of course, they had to with such a flavorful flavor,
such a filterful filter, such a flip-top box, such a soft pack—he
was so upset about leaving the firm that he cut off his ear in a
fit of chagrin.)
But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Italy and Shelley in
England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to grow. Who
does not remember his wistful lyric:
Although 1 am only five feet high,
Some day I will look in an elephant’s eye.
But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This too
failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies’ man, took up with Lucrezia
Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley. Shelley, a more
domestic type, stayed home with his wife Mary, and wrote his
famous poem:
I love to slay home with the missus and write,
And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.
Mary Shelley finally got so tired of being bitten that she went
into another room and wrote Frankenstein. Upon reading the
manuscript, Shelley and Byron got so scared they immediately
booked passage home to England. Keats tried to go too, but
he was so small that the clerk at the steamship office couldn't
see him over the top of the counter. So Keats remained in Rome
and died of a broken heart.
Byron and Shelley cried a lot and then together composed
this immortal epitaph:
Good old Kents, he might have been short,
But he was a great American and a heck of a good sport.
Truth, not poetry, is the business of the Marlboro makers,
and ire tell you truly that you can't find a belter fasting,
belter smoking cigarette than today’s Marlboro.
