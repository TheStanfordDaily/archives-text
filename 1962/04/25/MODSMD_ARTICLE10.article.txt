# Students Form Polish Group
## 
### 
An organization meeting for
the Polish Interest Group (Kolo
Zainteresowan Polskich) will be
held Friday.
The purpose of the group is to
promote interest in Poland and
its culture and to provide a place
for students to exchange views on
this atypical example of a Soviet
satellite.
Proposed discussion topics in
clude Polish literature, especially
Adam Mickiewicz, a great Polish
poet and author; the Oder Noisse
Territories, which are still under
official dispute; Polish folklore:
dances, songs, costumes, etc.; his
torical Russo-Polish affairs; and
a series of talks about individual
Polish town and places of inter
est. Outside speakers will be ar
ranged whenever possible.
The club is not a sympathy
group for the present government
of Communist Poland, nor it is in
any way politically oriented. It is
a reflection of the growing inter
est in Poland at Stanford, seen in
the exchange program with the
University of Warsaw and discus
sion of a Stanford-in-Poland over
seas campus.
Organizers of the group are
Jeff Straub. Tadeusz Gasinski,
and John Beijnen.
Time and place of the organiza
tion meeting will be announced
in OATQ. Anyone wanting fur
ther information should call
Straub at DA 3-3711.
