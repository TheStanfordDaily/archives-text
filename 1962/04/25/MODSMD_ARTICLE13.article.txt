# Who Can Present Political Speakers?
## 
### 
The problem presented by the Forum’s request to sponsor
Erich Fromm on this campus lias wide and varying implications,
the most important of which has already become thoroughly
buried.
We believe that anyone should he able to present a speaker
here. It can only be in the interest of education and the Univer
sity to permit any student group to present a speaker it may deem
enlightening to the* campus.
The problem with such an open arrangement is that conflicts
over sponsorship and dates can arise among organizations. But
it is for precisely this purpose that Public Exercises has been
created. It keeps the master calendar; it should act as a clearing
board for dates and sponsors.
It is obvious that students will choose to bring speakers who
have enough appeal to attract a respectable audience. The only
veto that is necessary is one dictated by the limitations of time
and space.
Such a solution certainly makes more sense than rules defining
“political” and “non-political” and allowing only one organization
to present “outside" speakers. The problems in clarifying and then
enforcing these restrictions are far greater than any help they
can offer.
The University has made a sound decision in allowing such
speakers as Cns Hall, Fred Schwarz and Frank Graham to ap
pear. It should not hamper itself by imposing rules which may
bar such men as Fromm.
