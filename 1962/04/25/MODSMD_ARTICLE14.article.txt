# DEMOCRATS WRANGLE
## Split in State Party Noted 
### ROSS HERMANN 
The Democratic Party of Cali
fornia, that noted "liberal” insti
tution which is fond of calling
itself the party of the people, has
been acting recently in a peculiar
manner toward certain of its
members.
From Sou th er n California
comes the news that the Consti
tutional Democratic Club of the
sprawling Los Angeles suburb of
Lakewood has undergone a slight
change—it has become the Con
stitutional Republican Club of
Lakewood.
TWENTY-ONE members of this
club—the majority of its mem
bership have re-registered as Re
publicans, and at least five others
were expected to follow suit.
The reason for their break with
the past was that higher echelons
of the Democratic Party tried to
limit free discussion in the for
mulation of party positions.
The Democratic group, origi
nally part of the Los Cerritos or
ganization, decided to form its
own club and applied to the Cali
fornia Democratic Council for a
charter. The club then made the
mistake of voicing their stands on
various current issues before the
CDC had taken action on the
charter.
“WE FIRMLY believe that the
reason we were not granted a
charter was because of several
positions we took which were con
sidered ‘extremist’ by the CDC,”
said Robert S. Barker, spokesman
for the group.

“For example, we are in favor
of the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee and we support
the idea of an anti-communism
school to be sponsored by the lo
cal Chamber of Commerce.
Once the club had taken these
stands, oaths were sent to its
members by the CDC to be filled
out and returned.

“THE OATHS, which we were
to sign, said we would not ‘ex
pound within meetings of clubs
and councils of the Democratic
Party’ any ideas ‘in contradiction
to ihe expressed positions of
elected Democratic officials at the
state or national level.’ Apparent
ly, we would not be allowed to
express an opinion.”
The GOP chairman of the 32nd
Congressional District welcomed
the former Democrats to the Re
publican Party, telling them,
"You will always find a hearing
for your views. In our party,
there are liberals, conservatives,
and middle of the roaders.”

An obvious strength of a politi
cal party in a free society is the
formulation of party philosophy
through unrestrained discussion
at the broadest levels of the or
ganization. Thomas Jefferson
once commented, “That govern
ment is the strongest of which
every man feels himself a part,”
and the same certainly holds true
for a political party.
UNLESS THE CDC allows its
composite clubs the right of free
discussion, the Lakewood Demo
crats can be expected to be only
the first of a long series of defec
tions from the party.
After all, not even the Birch
Society requires such rigid dis
cipline from its members.

cipline from its members.
The Democratic Party of Cali
fornia, that noted "liberal” insti
tution which is fond of calling
itself the party of the people, has
been acting recently in a peculiar
manner toward certain of its
members.
From Sou th er n California
comes the news that the Consti
tutional Democratic Club of the
sprawling Los Angeles suburb of
Lakewood has undergone a slight
change—it has become the Con
stitutional Republican Club of
Lakewood.
TWENTY-ONE members of this
club—the majority of its mem
bership have re-registered as Re
publicans, and at least five others
were expected to follow suit.
The reason for their break with
the past was that higher echelons
of the Democratic Party tried to
limit free discussion in the for
mulation of party positions.
The Democratic group, origi
nally part of the Los Cerritos or
ganization, decided to form its
own club and applied to the Cali
fornia Democratic Council for a
charter. The club then made the
mistake of voicing their stands on
various current issues before the
CDC had taken action on the
charter.
“WE FIRMLY believe that the
reason we were not granted a
charter was because of several
positions we took which were con
sidered ‘extremist’ by the CDC,”
said Robert S. Barker, spokesman
for the group.

“For example, we are in favor
of the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee and we support
the idea of an anti-communism
school to be sponsored by the lo
cal Chamber of Commerce.
Once the club had taken these
stands, oaths were sent to its
members by the CDC to be filled
out and returned.

“THE OATHS, which we were
to sign, said we would not ‘ex
pound within meetings of clubs
and councils of the Democratic
Party’ any ideas ‘in contradiction
to ihe expressed positions of
elected Democratic officials at the
state or national level.’ Apparent
ly, we would not be allowed to
express an opinion.”
The GOP chairman of the 32nd
Congressional District welcomed
the former Democrats to the Re
publican Party, telling them,
"You will always find a hearing
for your views. In our party,
there are liberals, conservatives,
and middle of the roaders.”

An obvious strength of a politi
cal party in a free society is the
formulation of party philosophy
through unrestrained discussion
at the broadest levels of the or
ganization. Thomas Jefferson
once commented, “That govern
ment is the strongest of which
every man feels himself a part,”
and the same certainly holds true
for a political party.
UNLESS THE CDC allows its
composite clubs the right of free
discussion, the Lakewood Demo
crats can be expected to be only
the first of a long series of defec
tions from the party.
