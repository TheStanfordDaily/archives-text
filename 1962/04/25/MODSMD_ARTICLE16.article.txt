APPALLING
It was appalling to read in The
Daily of the 23rd the woi'ds of a
very unsophisticated i for all his
vocabulary i senior at Stanford.
TO THE charge that the depart
ment is leftist in orientation, my
comment is a very unsophisticat
ed “so what?” I favor neither the
conservative nor the liberal side.
Both have ideas that are distaste
ful to me. This goes to say that I
am not defending these men or
the department because I am a
leftist product of it. Academic
freedom means that a person can
study in a department without
being totally mentally rear
ranged. Mr. Willkie makes the
exercise of studying political sci
ence sound like brain washing.
Per the charge of hypocrisy,
because Mr. Rogow favors “all
means of persuasion” and uses
them, does this make him a hypo
crite? I do not feel that ridicule
which points out salient weak
nesses in an ideology or slant
which is thoroughly and constant
ly brought to the attention of the
class by (he professor can be clas
sified as “blatantly unintellectu
al.”
Innuendos are also present at
times, but I am sure that both
Mr. Rogow and Mr. Bunzell would
be willing to answer for these to
those who want to ask. They have
done so in the past, and, I am cer
tain, will continue to do so in the
future.
FBOM MY experiences with
Mr. Rogow, I find that he likes
the intellectual “come on.” He
neither wants his words to be
blindly accepted or to be called a
hypocrite by those who are ex
posed to his ideas and are so un
sure of their own that their be
liefs are undermined, resulting
in the suspicion of something ap
proaching a conspiracy.

FORUM STATEMENT
Editor, The Daily:
Doug Topham. in his letter of
yesterday has pointed out one of
several logical inconsistencies
which the administration had put
forth in their veto of Forum’s
constitution..He rightly questions
the policy of lumping partisan
and non-partisan groups into one
conglomeration, and notes that
this will greatly narrow the scope
of the issues to be presented.
Forum has held that it is non
partisan for several reasons: I)
We are non-partisan in the sense

that wo support no party or
special platform. The purpose of
Forum as stated in our constitu
tion is to give full discussion to
all tlie problems which revolve
around one topic—that of alter
natives to war. Political non-par
tisanship does not mean that we
do not use a political frame of
reference, ft is impossible to give
complete discussion to any social
or economic problem without en
tering the political sphere.
2) Acceptance of a partisan
label implies that Forum has its
own political platform, view
points, candidates for office, and
therefore excludes all those peo
ple who have other political com
mitments. We feel that the issue
of war and its alternatives should
not, and at this point in history,
cannot become partisan political
positions. We urge open discus
sion of all of the issues involved
and participation by everyone in
terested.
The Forum constitution was
passed by the Legislature. The
question of partisanship was dis
cussed at that time, and, to our
understanding, an attitude very
similar to that presented here
was adopted. The administration
has vetoed this decision; the
question of who really makes the
decisions in student affairs once
again rears its head. As Bob Say
ler has pointed out, if the Legisla
ture has not the jurisdiction to de
cide which student groups are
properly constituted, it has little
ability to do much else.

APATHY
Editor, The Daily:
I have watched with interest
the voting turnout and student
comments about the election. The
apathy toward this election, and
the whole problem of the consti
tution is astounding; a letter
questioning the value of student
government indicates the depth
to which this apathy has fallen.
At the beginning of the year. I
thought I could sense an end to
the apathy that has surrounded
me in my four years at Stanford.
There seemed to be more interest
for local, national, and even inter
national events. Throughout the
1962 QUAD I attempted to picture
this interest, and show the awak
ening of the student body.
Now it seems that what I
thought was a clearing of the

weather was no more than one
small ray of sunshine coming
through the still thick clouds.
Now I find that no one has shown
interest in assuming an editor
ship for next year, or for that
matter, no interest has been
shown in any of the nine other
positions.
I am truly sorry for a student
body that only participates in
enough extra-curricular activity
to get the needed and highly
valued activity credit. True, there
are a few that show an active in
terest; balance on the other side
by the number that only manage
to obtain activity credit at the end
of their senior year, while the
vast number just sit on a major
portion of their anatomy and take
no advantage of the large number
of opportunities that are avail
able to them.
I hope that the situation can at
least improve enough so that the
QUAD will he able to publish
next year. As for a vote for
whether we want student govern
ment the actions you perform in
(he next few weeks will he sign
enough. No referendum will be
required.

ICC AND IFF
Editor, The Daily:
It has come to my attention
that a statement has been made
by an ASSU presidential candi
date to the effect that the Inter-
Club Council supported the Inter-
Fraternity Council’s "dinging” of
the proposed ASSU Constitution.
Before further damage is done, I
think it is necessary to clarify the
ICC’s position in regard to the
Constitution.
The ICC did not either endorse
or reject the proposed Constitu
tion at any time before the elec
tion. Discussions were held from
lime to lime regarding various
points, and the attitude was gen
erally favorable. On April 17, the
day of the referendum. I received
a call from Ed Eschbach, the IFC
President. He told me how IFC
stood in regard to the Constitu

tion and asked mo to join with
IKC in their "dinging.” I explain
ed that I was very much in favor
of the proposed Constitution and
that I thought IFC’s action was
unjustified and thoughtless. At
that time I told Mr. Eschbaoh that
I was of the opinion that the ICC
would support my statements in
favor of the Constitution. At our
meeting that night, (he ICC ex
pressed their unanimous support

of the proposed Constitution.
1 hope that any candidates who
want to use our name in their
campaign will contact me before
doing so,
Dave Dlerdorff
ICC President
