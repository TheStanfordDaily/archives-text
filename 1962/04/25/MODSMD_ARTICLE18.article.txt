With the success that the Stanford track team has enjoyed this
year crowding most other sports to the bottom of the sports page,
other fine Stanford teams have not gotten the publicity they deserve.
('OACH BUD FINGER'S Stanford golfers won the Western In
tercollegiate Golf Tournament, finishing far ahead of other Big Five
teams entered, and five strokes ahead of their nearest competitor.
In Pete Choate. Stanford has

one of the top amateur golfers in
Northern California. For sure, he
is one of the two top college golf
ers in the area, his challenger
being John Lotz of San Jose
State.
LOTZ EDGED Choate for first
place in the individual scores in
(he Western, but Finger feels that
Choate would have won had he
been allowed to play in the group
Lotz toured the course with over
the last eighteen holes.
Is Lotz Tops?
For their part, San Jose par
tisans have said that Lotz is the
top amateur in Northern Califor
nia, bar none. The dispute over
which is better may be resolved
this weekend when Stanford

meets San Jose State on the Spartan home golf course.
< lIOATE IS BY NO MEANS the only good golfer on the Stan
ford team. Bill Parish is a tough man to beat in a head to head
meeting under match play. His score may not be as low as Choate’s
because he has a tendency to have one or two had holes in a match
which inflates his score.
I HE STANFORD TENNIS TEAM is in a peculiar situation. In
the AAWU it is winless, losing to Cal, USC and UCLA. Thus in
fourth place in the AAWU, the Indians nevertheless may be the
fourth best collegiate tennis team in the United States.
1)1 I< H 11.HRING’S baseballers are 12-9 on the season, despite
a 1 (i C IBA record, and have won six of their last seven games.
They Might Win A Few
The baseball team might win a few more with a little support
from the student body. Last Friday’s game with the Air Force was
a shameful exhibition of student apathy.
STANFORD HAD GOTTEN in shape for the two-game weekend
series with the Air Force by toying with St. Mary’s 18-4, and destroy
ing Claremont 19-2.
A few people could have been expected to show up for what
looked like a good contest between a Stanford team that had finally
started hitting, and a slugging Air Force Club that had scored 47
runs in its first four games.
BARELY lft» PEOPLE were in the stands to watch Stanford
win 11-10, and the students in the crowd were mostly student police.
Stanford consistently has a winning baseball team, and just as

consistently the student body re
wards one of Stanford’s few win
ning major sport teams with a
monumental lack of interest.
Maybe a few fans will show up
for this weekend’s series with
UCLA Friday and Saturday with
USC, rated the best team in the
nation, but I doubt it.
