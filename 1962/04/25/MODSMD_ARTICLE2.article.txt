# SKINNER SAYS
## Man Must Control His Environment 
### CHRIS WILLS 
Psychologist B. Frederick Skin
ner spoke on “The Experimental
Design of Culture,” at the Tues
day Evening Series last night.
Human behavior is based on
genetic endowment and cultural
background, stated Skinner. Since
human freedom is one of the most
cherished notions of our society,
one is sometimes unwilling to ac
cept this. However, the view
doesn’t undermine man’s impor
tance, since he is learning to con
trol the environment which con
trols him.

SKINNER stated that although
man has radically changed his en
vironment, he has made little
change genetically. Mankind faces
a basic problem today because
bodies which have remained phys
ically unchanged must adjust to
a changed world.
Skinner gave examples of some
serious problems which have re
sulted from this condition. Al
though man now has an abundant
food supply, he still gains pleas
ure from eating. Overweight is
the result. Because of medicine’s
control of pestilence, a rapid
population increase isn’t needed.
However, since the sox drive
hasn't changed, society is faced
with the population explosion.
Man’s natural tendencies of ag
gressiveness are now more dan
gerous than beneficial.
To meet this problem Skinner
proposed several possible solu
tions. The liberalism theory ad
vocates man’s accepting and en
joying the situation. To do this
man has produced non-fattening
food, contraceptives, and sports
such as football in which one can
watch someone else taking out
his aggressions. Skinner believes
this is a weak society because of
the great deal of useless activity.
The puritanical solution pun
ishes people for activities harm
ful to society. Skinner believes
this can cause a mass of neurotic
citizens.
The psychological theory would
change man's body through ap
petite suppressing pills and tran
quillizers.
The most successful solution

would be environmental regula
tion, stated Skinner. Man would
build a society in which human
characteristics wouldn’t present a
problem because basic needs
would be satisfied.
MAN HAS had a vision of such
a utopia since Plata’s Republic.
Skinner has a vision, also, which
he calls Walden 11. He advocates
a productive society in which are
cultural activities and good pub
lic education.
In Walden II Skinner would he
sure that although each person
would bo provided for according
to his needs, the individual
wouldn’t be deprived of doing
work enjoable to him.
A specifically designed culture
such as Walden II would maxi
mize man’s freedom because he
would understand what’s control
ling him.
Skinner believes society will go
forward if man will apply his in
telligence to the control of hu
man destiny.

tions. The liberalism theory ad
vocates man’s accepting and en
joying the situation. To do this
man has produced non-fattening
food, contraceptives, and sports
such as football in which one can
watch someone else taking out
his aggressions. Skinner believes
this is a weak society because of
the great deal of useless activity.
The puritanical solution pun
ishes people for activities harm
ful to society. Skinner believes
this can cause a mass of neurotic
citizens.
The psychological theory would
change man's body through ap
petite suppressing pills and tran
quillizers.
The most successful solution

would be environmental regula
tion, stated Skinner. Man would
build a society in which human
characteristics wouldn’t present a
problem because basic needs
would be satisfied.
MAN HAS had a vision of such
a utopia since Plata’s Republic.
Skinner has a vision, also, which
he calls Walden 11. He advocates
a productive society in which are
cultural activities and good pub
lic education.
In Walden II Skinner would he
sure that although each person
would bo provided for according
to his needs, the individual
wouldn’t be deprived of doing
work enjoable to him.
A specifically designed culture
such as Walden II would maxi
mize man’s freedom because he
would understand what’s control
ling him.
Skinner believes society will go
forward if man will apply his in
telligence to the control of hu
man destiny.


DR. B. FREDERICK SKINNER

Psychologist B. Frederick Skin
ner spoke on “The Experimental
Design of Culture,” at the Tues
day Evening Series last night.
Human behavior is based on
genetic endowment and cultural
background, stated Skinner. Since
human freedom is one of the most
cherished notions of our society,
one is sometimes unwilling to ac
cept this. However, the view
doesn’t undermine man’s impor
tance, since he is learning to con
trol the environment which con
trols him.

SKINNER stated that although
man has radically changed his en
vironment, he has made little
change genetically. Mankind faces
a basic problem today because
bodies which have remained phys
ically unchanged must adjust to
a changed world.
Skinner gave examples of some
serious problems which have re
sulted from this condition. Al
though man now has an abundant
food supply, he still gains pleas
ure from eating. Overweight is
the result. Because of medicine’s
control of pestilence, a rapid
population increase isn’t needed.
However, since the sox drive
hasn't changed, society is faced
with the population explosion.
Man’s natural tendencies of ag
gressiveness are now more dan
gerous than beneficial.
To meet this problem Skinner
proposed several possible solu
tions. The liberalism theory ad
vocates man’s accepting and en
joying the situation. To do this
