### 
63 Vice President
People have said that the per
son in the post of vice president
of any class has little or nothing
to do. As secretary of the class of
’63 for this past year, I have seen
(he inaccuracy of this statement.
I have had the experience with
class government to know how to
plan successful social and cul
tural functions to prove the state
ment false. And even if it were
true. I feel I am best qualified
for the position of vice president.

By running for vice-president
of the Class of ’63, I obviously
feel that a man is better qualified
for this job. Although the vice
president heads (he class’s social
activities, his primary function is
coordinator with the president
and financial manager, with the
possibility of his having to as
sume presidential responsibilities.
A vote for me is not a vote for
male dominance; rather it is an
awareness of woman’s proper
place.
—Bill Wood
