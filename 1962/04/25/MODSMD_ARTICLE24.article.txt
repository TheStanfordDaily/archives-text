This year the Associated Women
Students has been provided a
framework through which it
should be able to function effec
tively for t lie benefit of Stanford
women. Next year, with your
interest and support, it will. I have
served on the AWS Cabinet and
Board this year and have been
able to see, not only what has
been accomplished, but what can
be achieved.
The purpose of AWS is to rep
resent “the individual and major
ity interests of the women stu
dents of Stanford University.” In
order to do so, 1 feel that AWS
must branch out of the existing
areas of action. Social regula
tions, housing drawing, housing
problems, and the AWS Scholar
ships are and will remain impor
tant as AWS functions, but so
much more can be accomplished.
