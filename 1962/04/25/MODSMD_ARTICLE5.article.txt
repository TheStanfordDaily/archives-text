FROM THE LEFT, standing, Carolyn Eschbach, Julie Evans, Cindy
Harwood; and Patti Hagan and Donna Wimmer, seated, prepare
to be sold at auction as part of the Con Home Carnival. Postponed
from last week, the Carnival will be held this Friday at Mama
Garcia's from 3 to 6 p.m. The Lancers Rock'n Roll Band will be
there to provide music for the more energetic. Besides the auctioning
of the Frosh dollies, there will be car smashes, plate smashes,
balloon shaves, "girlie dunks," shooting out candles with water
guns, and a ring toss through girls' legs. The winners of the
Women's Row's "Night in the City" and the Con Home King and
Queen will also be announced. All proceeds will go to the Con
Home Drive, which is trying to reach this year's goal of $12,000.
