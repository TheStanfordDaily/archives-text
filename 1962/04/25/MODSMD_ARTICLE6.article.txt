# NASA to Fire Saturn As Super Water Bomb
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL (UPD—A
second test flight is scheduled to
day for America’s giant Saturn
booster—the rocket that will per
mit the United States to put up
payloads heavier than anything
orbited so far by Russia.
This time out the Saturn will
carry a payload of tapwater that
will he dumped in space and like
ly will create the highest and
largest ice cloud known to science
since the world began.
FIRING OF the 460-ton Saturn
comes at a time when both Rus
sia and the United States are bid
ding for attention in the space
race.
Russia grabbed the stage tem
porarily today by launching an
exploratory satellite that passes
over America. The Soviet Union
gave no indication whether the
new moonlet—named Cosmos—
could perform “sky spy” duties.
Russia’s accomplishment was
shorn of some of its impact how
ever, by the fact that even while
Cosmos 111 started orbiting,
America had a rocket—dubbed
Ranger 4 on its way to the
moon.
The latest computed data indi
cated Ranger woidd impact on
the dark side of the moon five
minutes ahead of schedule - at
8:50 a.m. EST. Officials hailed
the shot as a fantastic display of
accuracy.
Today’s scheduled Saturn

launching will be almost identical
to the first Saturn firing, exe
cuted with spectacular success
last Oct. 27.
The main difference between
this flight and the first one will
the the deliberate destruction of
the 162-foot rocket at the 65-mile
mark as a part of “Project High
Water,” officials said.
THIS IS designed to free the
water the rocket will carry as bal
last.
Scientists are curious to find
out what would happen to matter
in the near vacuum of the upper
atmosphere and lower ionosphere.
The highest that clouds ordinari
ly form is about 8 to 10 miles.
Officials said the ice cloud
formed by release of the water
may be visible for scores and per
haps hundreds of miles, if condi
tions are right. The cloud is ex
pected to fade quickly until it is
no longer visible to the naked eye.
