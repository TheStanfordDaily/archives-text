When University of California
students go to the polls to elect
their new student body president
next Monday and Tuesday they
will be able to choose between
Jack Merritt, Bruce Payne, Ed
Germain and Wazu. Only Wazu is
a dog—a black Labrador retriev
er.
Wazu, who is six months old,
is a write-in candidate. He is be
ing backed by Alpha Epsilon Pi,
a fraternity at the University of
California.
Mike Scholar, Wazu’s campaign
manager and spokesman for the
fraternity, says, “Our aim is a
serious one. We feel student gov
ernment at Cal is a farce. Stu
dents have little to say in the
face of the administration’s pow
ers. Perhaps if Wazu wins, they
will realize how farcial their
government is.”
What if Wazu does win? Well,
the winner will have to pass a
qualifying test on the workings
of the student government. But
since Wazu speaks a foreign lan
guage, a translator will go along
with him to the test.
Realistically, Scholar says, if
Wazu does win, he will probably
not be allowed to pass the test,
and the presidency will be award
ed to the candidate receiving the
next highest number of votes.
“But,” says Scholar, “at least
perhaps the students—and the ad
ministration will realize that
something must be done about
student government at Cal . . .
if it is to continue to exist.”
