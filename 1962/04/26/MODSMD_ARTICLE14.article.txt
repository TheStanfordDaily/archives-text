# Atmospheric Tests Resume With Blast Over Pacific Ocean
## 
### 
• WASHINGTON (UPl)—'The United States launched its at
mospheric nuclear test series yesterday with an “intermediate
yield” bomb dropped from a high flying airplane and exploded
near Christmas Island in the Pacific.
The bomb, fired at 10:45 a.m., EST, apparently unleashed an

explosive force equal to at least
100,000 tons of TNT. It was det
onated by the U.S. task force less
than 18 hours after President
Kennedy gave the final go-ahead
for the new series.
THE ATOMIC Energy Commis
sion announced the explosion in a
brief statement and immediately
gave assurances that the U.S.
tests would produce far less ra
dioactive fallout than the 1961
Soviet blasts that triggered the
American program.
“A nuclear test detonatoin took
place at about 10:45 a.m., EST.
yesterday in the vicinity of
Christmas Island,” the commis
sion said “The detonation was in
the intermediate yield range. The
device was dropped from an air
plane. The test was the first det
onation in Operation Dominic,
now underway in the Pacific.”
A commission spokesman said
only that the explosion was equal
in power to less than one mega
ton, one million tons of TNT, but
greater than 20 kilotons, or 20,000
tons. However, the AEG usually
uses “intermediate range” to re
fer to a blast equal to 100,000 tons
of TNT or more.
After issuing a brief formal
statement, a commission spokes
man added:
“AS PRESIDENT Kennedy
stated on March 2, the U.S. tests
will be conducted under condi
tions which will restrict the radio
active fallout to a minimum, far
less than from the Soviet Union’s
series of nuclear weapons tests in
the fall of 1961.”
This remark was part of a U.S.
reply to Japan and other “neu
tral” nations which protested the
U.S. tests oven before the first
blast. Western Europe generally
defended the U.S. decision to re
sume testing.
Shortly before announcement
of the shot, the State Department
said it shared the regret which
some governments and people felt
about the test resumption. But it
quickly added that the series was
vital to free world security.
Brickbats came as expected
from Russia and its satellites.
But American officials treated
them almost as though they were
unworthy of reply.
DURING THEIR tests last fall,
the Russians exploded more than
40 weapons, with a combined ex
plosive force of 120 million tons
of TNT. Among them was the
huge 58-megaton device. The
United States will unleash noth
ing like this weapon.
America is expected to explode
nothing larger than 10 megatons
among (he 24-odd devices to be
tested.
In this connection, the AEC
spokesman said that long-lived ra
dioactivity in fallout around the
world during the spring and sum
mer of 1962 “will be largely from
the Soviet tests of 1961.”
The spokesman said, however,
that “some short-lived radioactivi
ty, such as iodine 131, from (he
U.S. tests will be detectable dur
ing and shortly after the series.”

the fall of 1961.”
This remark was part of a U.S.
reply to Japan and other “neu
tral” nations which protested the
U.S. tests oven before the first
blast. Western Europe generally
defended the U.S. decision to re
sume testing.
Shortly before announcement
of the shot, the State Department
said it shared the regret which
some governments and people felt
about the test resumption. But it
quickly added that the series was
vital to free world security.
Brickbats came as expected
from Russia and its satellites.
But American officials treated
them almost as though they were
unworthy of reply.
DURING THEIR tests last fall,
the Russians exploded more than
40 weapons, with a combined ex
plosive force of 120 million tons
of TNT. Among them was the
huge 58-megaton device. The
United States will unleash noth
ing like this weapon.
America is expected to explode
nothing larger than 10 megatons
among (he 24-odd devices to be
tested.
In this connection, the AEC
spokesman said that long-lived ra
dioactivity in fallout around the
world during the spring and sum
mer of 1962 “will be largely from
the Soviet tests of 1961.”
The spokesman said, however,
that “some short-lived radioactivi
ty, such as iodine 131, from (he
U.S. tests will be detectable dur
ing and shortly after the series.”
• WASHINGTON (UPl)—'The United States launched its at
mospheric nuclear test series yesterday with an “intermediate
yield” bomb dropped from a high flying airplane and exploded
near Christmas Island in the Pacific.
The bomb, fired at 10:45 a.m., EST, apparently unleashed an

explosive force equal to at least
100,000 tons of TNT. It was det
onated by the U.S. task force less
than 18 hours after President
Kennedy gave the final go-ahead
for the new series.
THE ATOMIC Energy Commis
sion announced the explosion in a
brief statement and immediately
gave assurances that the U.S.
tests would produce far less ra
dioactive fallout than the 1961
Soviet blasts that triggered the
American program.
“A nuclear test detonatoin took
place at about 10:45 a.m., EST.
yesterday in the vicinity of
Christmas Island,” the commis
sion said “The detonation was in
the intermediate yield range. The
device was dropped from an air
plane. The test was the first det
onation in Operation Dominic,
now underway in the Pacific.”
A commission spokesman said
only that the explosion was equal
in power to less than one mega
ton, one million tons of TNT, but
greater than 20 kilotons, or 20,000
tons. However, the AEG usually
uses “intermediate range” to re
fer to a blast equal to 100,000 tons
of TNT or more.
After issuing a brief formal
statement, a commission spokes
man added:
“AS PRESIDENT Kennedy
stated on March 2, the U.S. tests
will be conducted under condi
tions which will restrict the radio
active fallout to a minimum, far
less than from the Soviet Union’s
series of nuclear weapons tests in
the fall of 1961.”
