“Student” by David Horowitz

Student demonstrations in Eu
rope have nearly the status of
tradition, but at best are tolerat
ed by American society. Perhaps
this is as it should be if a univer
sity education is no more than a
process of certification for job
placement. Dave Armor, 1959 Stu
dent Borly president at Cal and a
member of SLATE, expressed a
different opinion; “ . . . the
greatest failing of students in our
society is an unsurpassed apathy
towards vital social issues which
affect them now and will affect
them as future leaders.”
“Student,” written by Cal grad
student David Horowitz about the
political awakening at Berkeley,
describes the questions and mo
tives which have led to student
action.
TWO THEMES dominate “Stu
dent”: first, student reconsidera
tion of the values and ideological
slogans which the press, industry,
and government offer; and sec
ond, individual commitment to
civil liberties, especially the light
to dissent in a free society.
To the new student, honesty
and openness precede ideological
commitment, and the old answers
don’t satisfy his question. Writ
ing of Hiroshima, the political
birthplace of this generation,
Horowitz says, “guilt we could
have borne, and, in some sense,
sought to expunge but that
there was to be no guilt at all?”
Of our allies he says, “My gen
eration has been witness to more
offers to sacrifice the world for
freedom, for country, for God
Himself, than we are likely to
take without some revulsion and
disgust.... Don’t you think
we’ve thought of Rhee, of Chiang,
to Trujillo and Salazar Batista

l and Franco, Somoza and the
others. . . . And don’t you think
we’ve paled a little at the hypoc
risy of it all?”
PRIOR TO the reconsideration
of old values and answers is the
first commitment of the student,
to the freedom to dissent.
Thus the book extensively dis
cusses the HU AC, the most bla
tant and accessible of institutions
endangering dissent. The descrip
tion of “Black Friday” by Fred
Haines, KPFA reporter, is excel
lent. The discussion of the Mei
senbaeh trial is largely from “The
Californian” and does much to
counter the charges of “commu
nist dupes.”
The University is the student’s
home, and not always a secure
home. Horowitz reads “adminis
tration” for “university” as the
arbiter of the intellectual environ
ment.
“THE STUDENTS know their
professors are silent on certain
issues, out of fear. They know
that their fellow students do ,not
sign petitions for good causes, out
of fear. They know that the uni
versity administration strives to
neutralize student government
and prevent it from facing issues,
out of fear. And they resent the
fear that has closed in their
world, and slowly they gather
their anger against the forces
that have created it.”
We at Stanford in many ways
are not subject to the pressures
the Berkeley student faces, per
haps because we rarely act to
incur such pressures. Horowitz
finds student support at large to
be drawn to individual issues,
while our active students gener
ally meet only old friends react
ing to issues. Perhaps a key issue
like the dismissal of a professor
without fear or tenure will awak
en the comatose student.
It’s flattering to think that

“Student” describes students, but
more realistically political aware
ness and honesty are found in

pitifully few. The strength of
this book is its presentation of the
rationale behind student action.

Its fault is that it does not dis
tinguish between reasoned and
exuberant action. David Horo
presents a fine argument for
broadening the meaning of “stu
dent” beyond “academic” to po
litical awareness.
