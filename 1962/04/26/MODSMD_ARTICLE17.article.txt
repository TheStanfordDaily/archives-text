TARSHIS SPEAKS
Editor, The Daily:
Your editorial in The Daily, Fri
day April 13th, must be applaud
ed for the concern it shows for
the maintenance of freedom on
the campus. It seems to me, how
ever, that in seeking a cause, it
overstates its case, and in doing
so it attributes to the Department
of Economics (and Administra
tion) roles which they have not
played.

First, the University Adminis
tration did not encourage Baran’s
colleagues in Economics to an
swer his letter to The Daily. In
stead the letter that was sent was
written because its author dis
agreed with Baran’s stand on
Cuba (expressed in speeches and
letters) and believed that his con
tinued silence would only con
firm the widespread opinion that
we all shared Baran’s views. Since
we also claimed the freedom to
dissent, it was felt desirable to do
so publicly. I must also point out
in this connection that the Admin
istration has done a great deal to
shelter the Department generally
from the direct impact of letters
from the outside, of the kind de
scribed in Mr. Rapoport’s article.
SECONDLY, Baran has not
been subject to discrimination in
arranging teaching assignments—
if any discrimination has been
shown it has favored him and was
in response to the state of his
health. It would, however, be in
appropriate to discuss in detail
here a matter which presumably
reflects a difference of opinion
between Professor Baran and me.
Thirdly, that he serves on no
University committees, only puts
him in the same situation as most
of his departmental colleagues—
as Professors Shaw, Haley, Gur
ley and myself, for example. This
may be regrettable but are you
sure that it is one of the prices
he pays “for his Marxist views”?
Fourthly, is there a danger to
freedom in the fact that the Uni
versity hurriedly arranged a
speaker to oppose Baran? Must
the dissenter be protected from
dissent?
IN THE delicate .matter of per
sonal relations, you can be sure
that my colleagues have not ac
cepted dictation from the Admin
istration, nor have they been sub
ject to such pressure. Moreover,
I doubt that any simple explana
tion — (bowing to pressure, timid
ity, or what have you)—could ac
count for something which Baran
(according to you) alleges to be

true that his social relations
with his contemporaries are mini
mal and often antagonistic—but
which wo are ready to deny, or at
least sincerely hope is incorrect.
In short, whatever the penalties
Baran may have suffered for his
dissent, they have not been im
posed on him by his departmental
colleagues. Surely your contribu
tion to freedom would have been
a bit larger if your reporter had
taken the time to check his story
with “the other side.”
Doric Tarsbis
Professor of Economics
(Editor’s Note: Our informa
tion that the administration asked
members of the economics depart
ment to answer Baran publicly
was confirmed by several sources
and we believe it correct. Prof.
Tarsbis’ next two points only
show a difference of opinion be
tween himself and Dr. Baran. We
saw no “danger to freedom” in
the University arranging a speak
er to oppose Baran but we did
see evidence of the University’s
worries about the alumni reaction
tliat was to follow. We hasten
to add that the editorial in ques
tion was not directed at the Stan
ford economics department and
its role in the Baran case but
rather at the University as a
whole and universities in gen
eral.)
DISTURBED
Editor, The Daily:
Regardless of the merits or
faults of the HUAC, the article in
Tuesday’s issue of The Daily con
cerning student action against the
HUAC bothered me for two rea
sons.
First, I can think of no greater
waste of expensively-trained val
uable human resources than that
exhibited in student demonstra
tions. The actual success of such
demonstrations is debatable,
whether the purpose of them has
been to cause the end of the
HUAC, bomb tests, or executions
of criminals. It is true that pub
licity I’ogistering discontent is
achieved that otherwise may not
be gained, but the backing of the
protesting groups of students of
questionable maturity surely does
not lend much authority to the
stature of the particular protest.
As a Stanford student, I feel
somewhat embarrassed that sup
p os e d 1 y intelligent colleagues
would uitlize mob tactics to sup
port a cause. Even though non
violent, many tax dollars are ex

pended to provide police coverage
to insure that the demonstration
remains orderly. Surely these ef
forts are not consistent with the
Stanford legacy that reflects en
ergetic individual student effort
in backing such measures as local
charities, the Peace Corps and the
PACE program.
Second, it was disturbing that
The Daily lent support to such
flemonstrations in an article sup
posedly of a news item variety. If

it was The Daily that invited
Stanford students to .loin in the
HUAC demonstration, then such
an invitation should have been in
the form of an editorial. Obvious
ly a press release for this well
organized protest was inserted
verbatim as a front-page news
item without adequate staff re
writing. Such action would seem
to be a poor journalism technique
for a paper representing an out
standing university.
