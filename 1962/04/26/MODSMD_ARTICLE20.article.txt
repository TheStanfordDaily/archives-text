# CRAMER, WEILL TOPS
## Big 5 Track Summary 
###

all of which placed them among the very best in national and

international track and field cir
cles. ,

collegiate effort of the season, !
Weill is second among college j
platter throwers. Both of the I

bers of the AAWU participating
in the Mt. San Antonio Relays
Saturday.
Although USC’s great win streak was snapped by a fine Oregon
track team, it was far from a bleak weekend on the AAWU track
and field scene.
Three outstanding athletes hit the best marks of their careers,
all of which placed them among the very best in national and

international track and field cir
cles. ,
WASHINGTON’S red ■ headed
junior John Cramer pole vaulted
15-6 1 at Stanford, the third best
American vault of the year.
On the same field Stanford’s

Dave Weill continued his assault j
on the discus field with a heave 1
of 189-6';;, America’s fifth best
throw of the season.
California’s Gene Johnson he-1
came the third American to high I
jump seven feet in 1962, clearing j
that height even in Los Angeles
in the Bears’ meet with UCLA.
CRAMER’S vault is the best i
collegiate effort of the season, !
Weill is second among college j
platter throwers. Both of the I
other seven-foot jumpers are col
lege athletes.
The weekly Big Five track sta-'
tistics also show a new leader in
the 880, a new co-leader in the
low hurdles and several other fine
efforts.
USC’s Warren Farlow took the
880 leadership from teammate
Tom Lile with a 1:50.3 time. The
Trojans’ Rex Cawley tied team
mate Bob Pierce for the low hur
dles lead at 23.1.
OTHER TOP marks included
Ken Emanuel’s 47.5 in the 440, !
which moved the Card sophomore j
into second place among AAWU j
quarter-nailers; Julio Marin’s ■
9:06.2 two mile for USC; UCLA’s
C. K. Yang’s 23.2 in the low hur- j
dies; a 173-foot discus toss by j
UCLA’s Gerald Carr and a 170-3', i j
toss by USC’s Jim Wade in the 1
same event; and broad jumps of I
23-9 by Winston Doby of UCLA ,
and 23-s'/a by Larry Chukwudebe |
