# Paper Ballots Today At Engineering Corner Poll
## 
### 
Stanford students will get a
chance to vote with either paper
ballots or voting machines in the
second day of the LASSU elec
tions today.

Paper ballots will be given out
at Engineering corner, while the
voting machines will continue in
use at Cubberley, and students
will have their choice. Both polls
will be open from 8:30 to 3:30
(NOT 5 as previously announced)

The change in procedure was
made necessary, according to
Election Com Chairman Melinda
Gartzman, by the fact that many
people were discouraged from
voting yesterday by the long lines
which formed at the voting ma
chines in Cubberley lobby.
“EVERYONE who wants to will
get a chance to vote without ex
cessive waiting.” promised Miss
Gartzman. “We are using paper
ballots in addition to voting ma
chines in order to be fair to all
concerned.”
Only 1081 people voted yester
day, or about 60 per cent of nor
mal, according to vice-chairman
Mike Norton. The biggest prob
lem was that the students didn’t
Understand the machines, and
took more time than was expect
ed. “The only way the students
will ever learn to work the ma
chines is to try them,” Norton
said, adding “we hope as many
voters as possible will use them
tomorrow, in order to learn the
procedure.”
At least two more candidates
have announced belated write-in
campaigns for office. Janis Fos
sotte is running tor ASSU Vice-
President and Judy Levin has an
nounced for Union LASSU Rep
resentative.
