So, it’s nearing the
end of the month, and
your walking-around
scratch might not be
getting a bit thin?
Worry not. The per
ceptive purchaser in
need of outfitting
merely hies himself
to friendly old R/A
and makes use of his
Super Charge ac
count. With his S/C
for R A, he takes care
of his needs, head to
toe, and pays only a
small part of the tab
monthly. Especially
useful, right now dur
ing AFTER EASTER
SPECIALS!
