Here’s news for the clothes-
CONSCIOUS MALE . . .
I sell tailored-to-measure clothing,- SUITS • SPORT
JACKETS • BLAZERS • SLACKS; at prices that will
put proper fit and quality within the reach of most
everyone (SUITS from $76.50 LESS 15%*)
If you are hard to fit, if you like variety in fabric
and styling individuality, (Ivy, continental or Lon
don line—we make it) , . .
Custom tailoring is the answer for the lanky 6 footer
(or more), or the athlete who go carried away with
exercise and now can't get the pants to fit in a stock
suit.
It's the answer too, for the man in business or head
ing for a business career soon, because there is
wonderful self-assurance in knowing your clothes
are right.
