# Students to Vote on Liquor Proposal; It Has LASSU OK
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
The revised liquor policy will be referred to the student body
in an election next Wednesday and Thursday. EASSU, after de
bate and questioning last night, recommended the student body
approve the change.
Jim Stewart discussed the implication of the amendment on

"people under 21 drinking. He said
that drinking by people over 21
would probably increase drinking
by those under 21.
It is legal for persons under 21
to possess and drink liquor in a
private place, which Stanford is,
Stewart said.

As the Alcoholic Beverages
Control Board does not usually
interfere in drinking at off-cam
pus parties, they are even less
likely to interfere on-campus,
Stewart stated.
JOEL iMLISTER reinforced this
point by revealing that the ABC
would virtually have to be called
by the Administration, and that
he has very strong information
that the Administration would not
do so.
Meister added that the Admin
istration probably would not es
tablish its own enforcement pro
cedure.
The RAs will not enforce the
liquor control, as they are to be
confidants of the students and
not an arm of the Deans’ offices.
Women’s Row Representative
Sue Davidson said.
Meister stated that the decision
was entirely in the hands of the
students; that neither the admin
istration nor the trustees would
force the student judiciary to en
force stricter regulations. The
administration certainly has the
power to enforce its own regula
tions, but it will probably not
want to in this case, he stated.
ANOTHER reason for this
amendment, besides making a
needed change in the liquor regu
lations, is to rally student interest
which has been apathetic, Meister
said: This is not a crusade for
liquor alone, but also to restore
student confidence.

Many women do not want liq
uor in their dorms, ASSU Vice
President Margaret Sweeney
pointed out. The proposed amend
ment would prevent even a single
house outlawing liquor, accord
ing to Finance Manager Bud
Ratts.

LASSU then approved a student
referendum on liquor policy,
unanimously recommending a
“Yes” vote.
