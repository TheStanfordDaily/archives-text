# RED DISPUTE
## Walter Lippmann 
### 
Four years ago, when inter
viewing Mr. K. for the first time,
1 tried at one point to draw him
out about China. It was already
evident that there was trouble
between Peking and Moscow, and
in conversations with Soviet jour
nalists there was much talk about
the conflict. Talking to some stu
dents. it was plain that as be
tween the Russians and the Chi
nese in the university there was
a great deal of prejudice and ra
cial antagonism. Even then, four
years ago, it was plain that there
was deep ideological and emo
tional conflict between the two
big Communist peoples.
But Mr. K., naturally enough,
was determined not to tell me
about it and instead, when I
pressed him with questions, he
delivered a lecture on the inability
of one who is not a Marxist to
understand the international soli
darity of the Soviet camp. The
cause of International conflict, ho
asserted, is capitalism, and when
capitalism has been abolished
there can be no conflict.
SINCE THEN, this beautiful
theory has had a collision with
the ugly facts, and there can no
longer be any doubt at all that a
great conflict of interests exists.
What kind of conflict is it? It is at
bottom. I am convinced, the same
conflict which existed when the
Emperor of All the Russias and
the Emporer of China were still
on their thrones. It is a conflict of
national interests between the
Russians and the Chinese which
has gone on for generations and
it is due to a collision between
the Russians, expanding across
Siberia to the Pacific Ocean, and
the Chinese, expanding north
ward into Manchuria and Mon
golia, across the path of the Rus
sians.

Though this conflict is now car
ried on by two Communist states,
though it is encrusted with Marx
ist and Leninist slogans, it is the
same historic conflict which has
been going on for generations be
tween the empires which are
ruled from Peiping and from Mos
cow. There is now a frontier be
tween these two empires which
runs some 4,000 miles into the
heart of Asia, and it is a highly un
stable and insecure frontier.
Along it the vital interests of both
countries are engaged.

THE EXISTENCE of this con
flict has begun to affect impor
tantly the whole international sit
uation. While we cannot as yet
see clearly all the effects, it is
already reasonably clear that
Moscow is reacting according to
the classic Russian formula,
which is never to become vitally
engaged in a conflict on two
fronts.
This promises to lead to accom
modation over West Berlin, on
the one hand, and also to some
sort of disengagement from a
conflict with the United States in
Southeast Asia.
There are signs, so I venture
to believe, that the Soviet Union
is helping Communist North
Vietnam just enough to keep it
out of the hands of the Chinese
and not so much as to precipitate
a conflict with the United States
in Laos and South Vietnam.
AS THIS is an optimistic esti
mate, it must, of course, be treat
ed with great skepticism and re
serve. But just as we must not let
our wishes and our hopes deceive
us, so also must we not let our
selves be misled by a lack of self
confidence. What is happening
between China and Russia is not
what Marxism predicts. But it is
what a student of history woidd
expect.
The fact that the Russians and
Chinese both profess the secular
religion of Communism is no rea
son why they should not fall into
a vital conflict. We should not
forget how ferocious have been
the wars of religion within Chris
tendom. We who have, we hope,
outlived those wars, need not be
surprised to see them break out
among the Communists.
WE ARE in the process of re
adjusting our thinking and our
policy to another great change in
the outer world. Since the middle
'fifties we have been readjusting
our minds and our policy to the
fact that we no longer have a nu
clear monopoly, that we have to
live in a system of nuclear parity.
Now we are adjusting ourselves
to a new and more agreeable de
velopment. which is that Com
munism, which has spread so far
in Asia, is disunited, and that it
does not face us with a solid
front.

conflict which existed when the
Emperor of All the Russias and
the Emporer of China were still
on their thrones. It is a conflict of
national interests between the
Russians and the Chinese which
has gone on for generations and
it is due to a collision between
the Russians, expanding across
Siberia to the Pacific Ocean, and
the Chinese, expanding north
ward into Manchuria and Mon
golia, across the path of the Rus
sians.

Though this conflict is now car
ried on by two Communist states,
though it is encrusted with Marx
ist and Leninist slogans, it is the
same historic conflict which has
been going on for generations be
tween the empires which are
ruled from Peiping and from Mos
cow. There is now a frontier be
tween these two empires which
runs some 4,000 miles into the
heart of Asia, and it is a highly un
stable and insecure frontier.
Along it the vital interests of both
countries are engaged.

THE EXISTENCE of this con
flict has begun to affect impor
tantly the whole international sit
uation. While we cannot as yet
see clearly all the effects, it is
already reasonably clear that
Moscow is reacting according to
the classic Russian formula,
which is never to become vitally
engaged in a conflict on two
fronts.
This promises to lead to accom
modation over West Berlin, on
the one hand, and also to some
sort of disengagement from a
conflict with the United States in
Southeast Asia.
There are signs, so I venture
to believe, that the Soviet Union
is helping Communist North
Vietnam just enough to keep it
out of the hands of the Chinese
and not so much as to precipitate
a conflict with the United States
in Laos and South Vietnam.
AS THIS is an optimistic esti
mate, it must, of course, be treat
ed with great skepticism and re
serve. But just as we must not let
our wishes and our hopes deceive
us, so also must we not let our
selves be misled by a lack of self
confidence. What is happening
between China and Russia is not
what Marxism predicts. But it is
what a student of history woidd
expect.
The fact that the Russians and
Chinese both profess the secular
religion of Communism is no rea
son why they should not fall into
a vital conflict. We should not
forget how ferocious have been
the wars of religion within Chris
tendom. We who have, we hope,
outlived those wars, need not be
surprised to see them break out
among the Communists.
WE ARE in the process of re
adjusting our thinking and our
policy to another great change in
the outer world. Since the middle
'fifties we have been readjusting
our minds and our policy to the
fact that we no longer have a nu
clear monopoly, that we have to
live in a system of nuclear parity.
Now we are adjusting ourselves
to a new and more agreeable de
velopment. which is that Com
munism, which has spread so far
in Asia, is disunited, and that it
does not face us with a solid
front.

Four years ago, when inter
viewing Mr. K. for the first time,
1 tried at one point to draw him
out about China. It was already
evident that there was trouble
between Peking and Moscow, and
in conversations with Soviet jour
nalists there was much talk about
the conflict. Talking to some stu
dents. it was plain that as be
tween the Russians and the Chi
nese in the university there was
a great deal of prejudice and ra
cial antagonism. Even then, four
years ago, it was plain that there
was deep ideological and emo
tional conflict between the two
big Communist peoples.
But Mr. K., naturally enough,
was determined not to tell me
about it and instead, when I
pressed him with questions, he
delivered a lecture on the inability
of one who is not a Marxist to
understand the international soli
darity of the Soviet camp. The
cause of International conflict, ho
asserted, is capitalism, and when
capitalism has been abolished
there can be no conflict.
SINCE THEN, this beautiful
theory has had a collision with
the ugly facts, and there can no
longer be any doubt at all that a
great conflict of interests exists.
What kind of conflict is it? It is at

engaged in a conflict on two
fronts.
This promises to lead to accom
modation over West Berlin, on
the one hand, and also to some
sort of disengagement from a
conflict with the United States in
Southeast Asia.
There are signs, so I venture
to believe, that the Soviet Union
is helping Communist North
Vietnam just enough to keep it
out of the hands of the Chinese
and not so much as to precipitate
a conflict with the United States
in Laos and South Vietnam.
AS THIS is an optimistic esti
mate, it must, of course, be treat
ed with great skepticism and re
serve. But just as we must not let
our wishes and our hopes deceive
us, so also must we not let our
selves be misled by a lack of self
confidence. What is happening
between China and Russia is not
what Marxism predicts. But it is
what a student of history woidd
expect.
The fact that the Russians and
Chinese both profess the secular
religion of Communism is no rea
son why they should not fall into
a vital conflict. We should not
forget how ferocious have been
the wars of religion within Chris
tendom. We who have, we hope,
outlived those wars, need not be
surprised to see them break out
among the Communists.
WE ARE in the process of re
adjusting our thinking and our
policy to another great change in
the outer world. Since the middle
'fifties we have been readjusting
our minds and our policy to the
fact that we no longer have a nu
clear monopoly, that we have to
live in a system of nuclear parity.
Now we are adjusting ourselves
to a new and more agreeable de
velopment. which is that Com
munism, which has spread so far
in Asia, is disunited, and that it
does not face us with a solid
front.

Four years ago, when inter
viewing Mr. K. for the first time,
1 tried at one point to draw him
out about China. It was already
evident that there was trouble
between Peking and Moscow, and
in conversations with Soviet jour
nalists there was much talk about
the conflict. Talking to some stu
dents. it was plain that as be
tween the Russians and the Chi
nese in the university there was
a great deal of prejudice and ra
cial antagonism. Even then, four
years ago, it was plain that there
was deep ideological and emo
tional conflict between the two
big Communist peoples.
But Mr. K., naturally enough,
was determined not to tell me
about it and instead, when I
pressed him with questions, he
delivered a lecture on the inability
of one who is not a Marxist to
understand the international soli
darity of the Soviet camp. The
cause of International conflict, ho
asserted, is capitalism, and when
capitalism has been abolished
there can be no conflict.
SINCE THEN, this beautiful
theory has had a collision with
the ugly facts, and there can no
longer be any doubt at all that a
great conflict of interests exists.
What kind of conflict is it? It is at
bottom. I am convinced, the same
conflict which existed when the
Emperor of All the Russias and
the Emporer of China were still
on their thrones. It is a conflict of
national interests between the
Russians and the Chinese which
has gone on for generations and
it is due to a collision between
the Russians, expanding across
Siberia to the Pacific Ocean, and
the Chinese, expanding north
ward into Manchuria and Mon
golia, across the path of the Rus
sians.

Though this conflict is now car
ried on by two Communist states,
though it is encrusted with Marx
ist and Leninist slogans, it is the
same historic conflict which has
been going on for generations be
tween the empires which are
ruled from Peiping and from Mos
cow. There is now a frontier be
tween these two empires which
runs some 4,000 miles into the
heart of Asia, and it is a highly un
stable and insecure frontier.
Along it the vital interests of both
countries are engaged.

THE EXISTENCE of this con
flict has begun to affect impor
tantly the whole international sit
uation. While we cannot as yet
see clearly all the effects, it is
already reasonably clear that
Moscow is reacting according to
the classic Russian formula,
which is never to become vitally
engaged in a conflict on two
fronts.
This promises to lead to accom
modation over West Berlin, on
the one hand, and also to some
sort of disengagement from a
