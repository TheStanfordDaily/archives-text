# University an Island in Palo Alto Sea of Racial Discrimination
## 
### SOL BIDERMAN 
IMany Stanford students are not
aware of the indignities colored
students here suffer when ex
posed to the subtle and blatant
practices of discrimination in
Palo Alto and its surroundings.

Palo Alto is often considered an
ideal community of affluent citi
zens with lovely homes in en
lightened Northern California.
Yet its discriminatory practices
make it reminiscent of a back
ward, bigoted Southern town.

NEGRO STUDENTS and towns
people have to go to barbershops
which cater to coloreds in Palo
Alto. If a Negro enters a white
barbershop in town, the barbers
ignore him, even if they have no
customers, until he takes the hint
and leaves. Or they say to him,
“I’m sorry, but I don’t know how
to cut your hair.”
One colored student, after read
ing an advertisement in The
Daily, went to inspect a room for
rent, but was told the room had
already been taken. Shortly after
wards he phoned the same place
and the landlord, who could not
distinguish his color over the tele
phone, told him the room was
still available.

The United States government’s
student exchange program is de
signed to provide foreigners with
a specialized education and to in
crease the understanding of our
society. Stanford’s foreign stu
dent program has also the same
goals, and enjoys the participa
tion of many Palo Alto towns
people who attempt to make the
foreign students feel at home in
the community.

BUT THE efforts of the govern
ment, the university, and these
townspeople are often jeopardized
by certain ugly incidents, such as
recently when an Indian student
of a dark complexion was refused
service in a Woodside shop.

At Stanford there is no discrim
ination in barbershops, housing,
and in any of the university’s fa
cilities. But as no man is an is
land, neither can the university
remain an isle of tolerance in a
sea of repugnant racial restric
tions. The university and the stu
dents themselves should take
every measure to end these insidi
ous practices. No longer should
the colored students and members
of the community be exposed to
such indignities against their per
son.
