## Paraguay: A Strict Dictatorship 
### RICHARD G. OFFUTT 
On one of my first evenings in
Paraguay I visited the movies in
Concepcion. Aside from two anti
quated American Westerns there
was a “newsreel:” 25 minutes of
Dictator-president General Alfre
do Stroessner and five minutes
devoted to internatonal affairs.
The contrast with Brazil was
shocking. The Brazilians Jeer and
cheer their politicians depending
on current events or the state of
intoxication, but as long as
Stroessner was on the screen, no
body said “boo.”
THIS IS one of the most tight
ly organized dictatorships which
I have ever seen, and I have visit
ed Russia and the satellite states
extensively. Since 1945 Stroessner
has ruled this potential paradise
with an iron hand, reinforced by
a one party system, Colorados,
and an ample military. He has
promised under pressure on nu
merous occasions to renew con
stitutional rights along with free
elections, but always retracted un
der one pretext or another.
Paraguay is in a state of siege
and sudden arrests without expla
nation or trial are a common oc
curence. So great is the fear of
imprisonment that even behind
closed doors the government is
never referred to as a dictator
ship. The closest definition I could
obtain was "armed democracy.”
Four political parties exist, but
the three of the opposition in
name only, without the right to
participate in the form elections
or solicit members. Responsible
members of the opposition have
been ruthlessly eliminated or
were lucky enough to flee the
country. Some claim that this
forced emigration has reduced
the population of 1,768.000 by half
a million. Those who remain “live
like animals” as one liberal told
me. There are neither jobs nor
credit in the banks for non-Colo
rados, and a persecution cam
paign continues.
THE PARAGUAYAN intelli
gentsia were in the main adher
ents to the doctrine of the liberal
party and their expulsion brought
about an intellectual emigration.
Stroessner has consequently been
obliged to fill government posts
with true but "ignorant” Colora
dos. The ramifications of this lack
of talent are deeply felt and re
sented by the present students
and almost all belong to one of the
many revolutionary groups.
These organizations supposedly
are the training ground for fu
ture party dignitaries but are
filled in reality with elements of
discontent. The inadequate school
facilities are hampered by a prim
itive curriculum, and the result is
a complete cultural vacuum.
The youngest of these parties
forced into a pseudo-existence is
the Christian-Democratic, a group
connected with the Catholic

Church. Unfortunately the bright
initial hopes linked with this j
group have all fallen by the way-1
side. The Bishop of Paraguay and
most of the clergy are Colorados
by birth and choose a comfortable {
party membership over a danger
ous idealism.
Paraguay’s economy, although
relatively stable, suffers under
the lack of free enterprise and
free thought. There is an internal
lack of capital, since most of the
living essentials have to be im
ported and the government does
not dare to print more money for
fear of inflation. Bankruptcy is
invariably the result of the state's
inability to pay private compa
nies, which in turn are compelled
to accept state orders or close
down.
THIS LACK of capital becomes
crucial in the agriculture. In the
interior few can afford to buy
products, and lack of transporta
tion and exterior demand exclude
the possibilities of exportation.
These factors combined with the
exorbitantly high military budget
result in a situation which is best
described as “indebted progress.”
A “private” is able to suppoi’t all
his relatives with his rations, but
the per capita income annually
barely reaches 100 dollars.
The two best possibilities for
economic advance lie in (he rich
timber resources and the petrole
um deposits in the still inacces
sible Chaco area. The former,
however, is in the hands of a few
families, who refuse to change
from the cheap present methods
of exploitation and the latter is
still in the grass roots stage.
The U.S. faces many problems
in dealing with Stroessner. He is
avidly anti-communist and along
with Ydigoras Fuentes of Guate
mala is one of the few South
American leaders who would have
supported an all-out North Ameri
can invasion in Cuba. It is the
most pro-western government
which 1 have seen yet in South
America and I feel that these
tendencies also dominate public
opinion at present.
THE QUESTION is, how long
will the public opinion identify
itself with the policies of the dic
tatorship. If America supports
Stroessner, directly or indirectly,
we betray the principles of the
Alliance for Progress and run the
risk of difficulties with other
South American countries. On the
other hand, Paraguay desperate
ly needs economic and technical
aid, and if American aid stops
completely, the inhabitants, re
gardless of political belief, suffer
and throw the blame on the U.S.
The hope expressed to me in
Paraguay was that the United
States woud be able to “persuade”
a “democratic evolution.” The res
idents have had their share of
“democratic revolutions,” which
invariably regress to the form of

an “armed democracy.” The seeds
of a “democratic revolution” are
already germinating among the
students, but the U.S. pressure on
Stroessner for democratic re
forms could divert them into a
more healthy “democratic evolu
tion.”

As in so many political prob
lems the chief hinderance is the
disunity of the Western Powers.
When the U.S. recently turned
down a request for immediate aid
until civil liberties reappeared.
Paraguay received some money
from West Germany.
