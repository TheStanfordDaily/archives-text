# BOTH DOWNED BY OREGON
## Indians Plotting Upset for USC 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
They’re saying in Los Angeles
that USC will start a new track
winning streak today against
Stanford, but don't bet on it. The
meet between SC and the Indians
will take place under the lights in
the L.A. Coliseum tonight.

Tomorrow, Stanford competes
in the Mt. San Antonio Relays.
The entire varsity squad plus
frosh sprinter Larry Questad will
enter.

SC RECEIVED its only loss in
over 100 dual track meets last
week at the hands of Oregon,
while Stanford is 6-3 on the sea
son in dual competition. Oregon
clobbered Stanford harder than
they tlid the Trojans, but this may
be attributed to the striking simi
larity between the Oregon and
Stanford teams.

Both teams are strong in the
distance runs, but Stanford is
merely excellent in those events
from the 880 to the two-mile,
while Oregon has the best group
of distance runners ever assem
bled on a U.S. college track team.
SC's power lies in the sprints,
hurdles, shot put and javelin.
El Troj features Rex Cawley,
who has clocked a 23.1 low hur
dle's and a 47.2 quarter-mile, both
better than Stanford’s best in

those events, although Ken Eman- 1
uels can be expected to give Caw-;
ley his toughest race of the year. I

BRUCE MUNN has better
sprint marks than Stanford’s Phil
Lamoreaux, but the Card has
been getting a reputation as a
tough man in the 220, and may
pull an upset.
Cawley. Boh Pierce and Brian
Polkinghorne could dominate the
hurdles but either Ken Emanuels
or Bill Wandrey must sneak past
these powerful Trojans if Stan
ford can pull an upset. j
USC’s Warren Farlow has the
best AAWU time in the 880,
1:50.3, and teammate Tom Lile is
close behind. Rich Klier is the
important Stanford runner here.
He tuned up for this race with a
mile win over Washington, and
may snap out of a mild slump by
pulling an upset triumph.

In the mile and two-mile, Stan
ford should gain their biggest ad
vantage. Harry McCalla has the
best AAWU time in both events.
He has a 4:07,7 mile and an 8:58.3
eight-lapper.

stops, trying for sweeps in those
events. McCalla, Robin Ruble and
Bill Pratl will be going in the
mile, while McCalla, Ruble and

John Northway will run the two
mile, Julio Marin is the only SC
strength to speak of at these dis
tances.

Dallas Long and Jan Sikorsky
are among the best in the coun
try in their events, the shot put
and javelin.
Long may push Steve Arch a
little closer to the 60-foot mark,
while Art Batchelder will be

ready for his best effort of the
year to try and catch Sikorsky.
Batchelder’s best may be close to
250-feet. It will have to be to get
Sikorsky.

Stanford’s strongest field event
may be the broad Jump, where
Dan Moore, Chuck Barth and Lar
ry Chukwudebe will try for a
sweep past the Trojans’ May
Johnson.

Norm Grundy (6-8) should out
do John Fontius and John Haynie

Phil White and Mel Hein of SC

strength to speak of at these dis

Dallas Long and Jan Sikorsky
are among the best in the coun
try in their events, the shot put

Long may push Steve Arch a
little closer to the 60-foot mark,
while Art Batchelder will be

ready for his best effort of the
year to try and catch Sikorsky.
Batchelder’s best may be close to
250-feet. It will have to be to get
Sikorsky.

Stanford’s strongest field event
may be the broad Jump, where
Dan Moore, Chuck Barth and Lar

sweep past the Trojans’ May
Johnson.

Norm Grundy (6-8) should out
do John Fontius and John Haynie

Phil White and Mel Hein of SC
could stage a battle at 15 feet to

SC should win the relay, with
a better than four-second edge on

Radio station KZSU will
broadcast today’s vursity
baseball game with UCLA,
beginning at 3 p.m., and to
morrow’s home donblehead

They’re saying in Los Angeles
that USC will start a new track
winning streak today against
Stanford, but don't bet on it. The
meet between SC and the Indians
will take place under the lights in
the L.A. Coliseum tonight.

Tomorrow, Stanford competes
in the Mt. San Antonio Relays.
The entire varsity squad plus
frosh sprinter Larry Questad will
enter.

SC RECEIVED its only loss in
over 100 dual track meets last
week at the hands of Oregon,
while Stanford is 6-3 on the sea
son in dual competition. Oregon
clobbered Stanford harder than
they tlid the Trojans, but this may
be attributed to the striking simi
larity between the Oregon and
Stanford teams.

Both teams are strong in the
distance runs, but Stanford is
merely excellent in those events
from the 880 to the two-mile,
while Oregon has the best group
of distance runners ever assem
bled on a U.S. college track team.
SC's power lies in the sprints,
hurdles, shot put and javelin.
El Troj features Rex Cawley,
who has clocked a 23.1 low hur
dle's and a 47.2 quarter-mile, both
better than Stanford’s best in

those events, although Ken Eman- 1

ley his toughest race of the year. I

sprint marks than Stanford’s Phil

pull an upset.

Polkinghorne could dominate the
hurdles but either Ken Emanuels
or Bill Wandrey must sneak past
these powerful Trojans if Stan
ford can pull an upset. j
USC’s Warren Farlow has the
best AAWU time in the 880,
1:50.3, and teammate Tom Lile is
close behind. Rich Klier is the
important Stanford runner here.
He tuned up for this race with a
mile win over Washington, and
may snap out of a mild slump by
pulling an upset triumph.

In the mile and two-mile, Stan
