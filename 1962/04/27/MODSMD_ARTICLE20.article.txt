over UCLA and the Air Force.
THIS 4-0 SHUTOUT loss was
UCLA’S last CIBA game, but the
Bruins rebounded from it by win
ning the Los Angelos Easter Base
ball Tournament. This is an im
pressive victory considering that
USC played in the tournament.
John Le Compte, a sophomore,
will start against the Bruins, who
have a 2-1 edge against the In
dians this season. Le Compte is
replacing Mark Miller, the regu
lar starter, who is out with a
muscle injury.
Today’s game starts at 3 p.m.,
while tomorrow’s doubleheader
begins at 1.
Stanford’s baseball team will
try to stretch its four-game win
ning streak this weekend in three
CIBA games at the Sunken Dia
mond, a single game today
against UCLA and a doublehead
er tomorrow against LISC. Al
though the Indians’ league record
is only 1-6, they have greatly im
proved their hitting and fielding
,in the last two weeks, beatin
UCLA. S.F. State, and the Air
Force Academy twice.
A win tomorrow for Coach
Dutch Retiring would be most
satisfying since USC is rated the
top collegiate team in the coun
try. They have nine fine players
and an 8-0 league record to sub

stantiate this rating.
FIRST BASEMAN Willie Ryan
and outfielder Ken Washington
were considered to be their top
hitters at the start of the year.
However, two other batters. Bob
Hollowed and Bob Levingson,
have emerged and are now lead
ing the CIBA at .478 and .367 re
spectively. Second baseman Mike
Gillespie is leading in rbi’s with
10.
This powerful Trojan attack is
supplemented by a tight defense
and an outstanding pitching staff,
headed by lefthanders Ken Yary
an and Pete Kenny.
Indian aces Darrell Sutherland
and Jim Lonborg, both right
handers, will start against SC.
Sutherland has boon Stanford’s
most impressive player this year,
and is currently working on a
string of 20 2 i scoreless innings,
including complete game shutouts
over UCLA and the Air Force.
