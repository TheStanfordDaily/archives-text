# FINE DIRECTING
## Three Cuckholds' Delightful, Humorus 
### M. PERCIVAL 
Too seldom are we treated to
the type of comedy which is being
presented by the Stanford Play
ers. At a performance of “The
Three Cuckholds” we are asked
not to search out any hidden
meanings or implications; we are
simply asked to relax and enjoy
the play for its entertaining,
frank humor.
The director, Mr. Klaus Strass
mann. brings to his task a wealth
of imagination and a thorough
knowledge of Commedia Dell’
Arte theatre. He has an authentic,
raised Commedia stage, and he
proceeds to explore its numerous
possibilities for stage business.
He supplies musical interludes, a
dance at the play’s beginning, and
several other characteristic ef
fects to achieve sixteenth century
atmosphere. What is his most dif
ficult objective—that of shaping
the entire ensemble to the tradi
tion’s peculiar acting style—he
reaches beyond a doubt. In short,
he takes sensitive command of
all phases of the production, and
a cohesive, simple unity is the
result.

SETTING IN motion the plot’s
unlikely escapades is the play’s
central figure, Arlecchino, adroit
ly played by Luke Vania. He dis
plays the necessary vocal brilli
ancy in the play’s high points, but
his performance is now somewhat
slow to gain the momentum in
repartee with his imaginary self
and with the other characters.
However, his complex movements
and gestures are given a supple
ness fascinating to watch.
The level of acting excellence
rises in the order of the cuckolds’
appearances. James Meynell, the
first old trickster to be seen, nice
ly portrays the rather stupid Co
vlello. But he needs to have a
greater awareness of his char
acter’s potential; then a sureness
of lino delivery with the adequate
vocal force will follow. The Pan
talone, Stephen Newman, is play
ed for all the breadth it is worth.
The slyness he exhibits in gain
ing possession of his neighbor's
wife is intriguing. Finally the
most impotent cuckold, Zanni,
played by William Louis, arrives
on the scene. This tricky role is
handled with fine body and vocal
control by Mr. Louis. His plan
ning of the effect desired from
each line and motion is accurate
to the degree that it seems pure
instinct is at work here. The
show is at its zaniest in his scene
with the Devil.
MISS JUNE Cook is most effec
tive as Flaminia. She employs a
great variety of expression to the
worldly sophistication of her part.

Also her pleasant voice does jus
tice to the calming Italian songs.
Miss Lynn Boatsman’s portrayal
of Franschina affords excellent
contrast to Flaminia. She defi
nitely hits the mark as the saucy
individual who, with fiery spirits,
enjoys living the bawd’s life to
the fullest. Amusing as Cintia’s
ensnarement of the young Lean
dro is. Miss Suzanne Payne’s
characterization lacjrs the origi
nality shown by the other women.
Special mention must go to
Moses Goldberg, who performed
in a triple capacity. He gives a
distinctive touch to each role, es
pecially his immensely quizzical,
'‘ltalian" Devil.

CREDIT IS DUE designer Wen
dell Cole and costumer Miss Geor
gia Ryther. Without the flexibili
ay they provide in their crafts,
the production would suffer.
This delightful, amoral adven
ture in unique theatre will be
presented again tonight and to
morrow and Wednesday through
Saturday of next week.
