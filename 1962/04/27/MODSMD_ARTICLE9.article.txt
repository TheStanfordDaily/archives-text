AN ESCONDIDO VILLAGE CHILD plays with his wagon perilously
close to construction work on new married student housing units.
Village parents, increasingly alarmed over the safety of their children playing in the area, have approached everyone from Director
of Married Student Housing Frank E. Gallagher to Mrs. J. E. Wallace
Sterling in an effort to have the university build a fence around.the
construction area. Yesterday, university Construction Manager Lucien Stark finally promised that "work should be started on a fence
by the first of next week, and hopefully completed by Friday."
