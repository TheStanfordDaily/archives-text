Coining to Europe This Summer?
If you are planning to buy or rent a car in Europe, we suggest
that you find out our low rates before finalizing. We offer the
lowest prices in Europe on many models. We are owned and
operated by former students, Texas A&M '56, and U. of AAd.
Phi Delta Theta '6l, so we know your special problems. Some
of our prices, including American specifications, registration &
touring documents, delivery costs, maps and a pat on the back:
Morris 850 Mini-Minor $lO5O.
VW deluxe sedan $1298.
MG Midget $1298.
Sunbeam Alpine $1995.
Daily charge renting VW $ 2.95
Contact us before doing anything rash; even if you can't make
Europe this summer ask about our import yourself plan.
