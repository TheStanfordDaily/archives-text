# Liquor Referendum Should Be Passed
## 
### 
The liquor referendum which has been thoroughly publicized
since April 18 goes to the student body Wednesday with Legis
lature’s support. Legislature could have made the by-law change
itself, but it preferred that this decision be made by the students.
We urge' a yes vote.
It is difficult to spot all the implications of the amendment.
The legal problems have been carefully explored by the initiators
of the referendum, and it seems clear that the University is to be
considered private property, where possession and consumption
of liquor by a minor are not prohibited by state law. The state
authorities must be invited onto the campus by the' administra
tion in order to be here at all.
Possession and consumption imply that a law has been broken
however—that is, the minor has either purchased liquor himself or
it has been given to him by someone else, both of which constitute
violations. But proving guilt is the problem of the state. The minor
will have to give the information that the state needs, and under
the Fifth Amendment he cannot be compelled to testify against
himself.
In the case of a gift, when he could be 1 compelled to testify
against the donor, it seems safe to assume from a practical point
of view that the authorities would not choose to interfere on
campus any more than they do off campus now’. It is also neces
sary for the state to have “probable cause” to search a building.
The position of the University is still more difficult to deter
mine. The change is directed at 21-year-old students drinking on
campus. Under ASSU by-laws, they will be allowed to drink, and
they will not be liable to prosecution by student judicial councils,
as long as they remain within the bounds of the state law. Minors,
an appendage consideration, will be subject to exactly the
same action as they arc now. Judicial councils will be bound to
enforce violations of state law. The policy does not “condone”
drinking by minors.
The proposed policy specifically permits persons over 21 years
to possess and consume liquor on the Stanford campus. It will
also allow the sale of beer and wine to persons over 21 in the new
Union building.
It does not bind persons in charge of freshman dormitories to
any policy whatsoever. It does not change the present status of
persons under 21 not living in freshman dorms. The same system
will continue to operate.
Although this should be the decision of the individual, the new
policy docs not, in any way, prevent women in any upper class
dormitory from agreeing as a house to forbid liquor within their
house. It is also possible for the women to decide as a group to
forbid liquor in all women’s residences.
It does not, in any way, condone excess—drunkenness, raucous
conduct of any type—but specifically forbids such conduct since
it is a violation of state law’.
The proposed change is sane, reasonable and a great deal
more realistic than the present policy. The ideal solution would
of course be to change the state law’. That is the next move but the
referendum is an excellent step in creating a responsible and
mature student bodv.
