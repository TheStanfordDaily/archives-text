DEMONSTRATIONS
Editor, The Daily;
I am not accustomed to defend
ing indefensible subjects, but a
few points in Mr. Baker’s letter
to The Daily of April 26 merit
discussion.
Mr. Baker first states his opin
ions that student demonstrations
are a “waste of expensively
trained valuable human re
sources,” and that the “actual suc
cess of such demonstrations is de
batable.” My support of student
demonstrations under those terms
is admittedly indefensible. A unit
of humanity, trained by modern,
expensive methods IS wasting the
academic facilities of his universi
ty if these are forsaken three
hours in favor of a political dem
onstration. Furthermore, that
atomic testing has been resumed,
that prisoners continue to be exe
cuted, and that HUAC proceed
ings remain undeterred, do leave
the quantitative success of the
demonstrations open to question.
However, by the very nature of
the questions involved in these
demonstrations, questions which
represent trends of thought in
our society, I feel the discussion
should involve qualitative terms
in interpreting the “facts” of the
case. First, that an interest in
politics and political institutions

is encouraged in most American
universities is exemplified in stu
dent governments, Political Un
ions, and the allowance of parti
san and non-partisan student com
mittees. This indicates a differ
ence in “education” and “train
ing,” in that “education” includes
other fields of instruction than
those directly applicable to a stu
dent’s major interest. Activity in
charities, the Peace Corps, and
PACE programs are other ex
amples of deviation from strict
“training,” and, though commend
able. do not involve experience in
all fields, especially the political.
Second, to say that the demon
strations are ineffective because
the protested institutions contin
ue, avoids their effectiveness in
arousing reactions and discus
sions on the part of educators,
education administrators, and stu
dents, exemplified by Mr. Baker’s
letter, even if the thinking of the
vast army of apolitical voters re
mains as unaffected by these dem
onstrations, or PACE and the
Peace Corps. It may also be hoped
that Congressmen and other elect
ed officials will eventually cease
ignoring these expressions of the
future electorate. Considering this
I cannot conclude that student
demonstrations are ineffective
and wasteful.

case. First, that an interest in
politics and political institutions

is encouraged in most American
universities is exemplified in stu
dent governments, Political Un
ions, and the allowance of parti
san and non-partisan student com
mittees. This indicates a differ
ence in “education” and “train
ing,” in that “education” includes
other fields of instruction than
those directly applicable to a stu
dent’s major interest. Activity in
charities, the Peace Corps, and
PACE programs are other ex
amples of deviation from strict
“training,” and, though commend
able. do not involve experience in
all fields, especially the political.
Second, to say that the demon
strations are ineffective because
the protested institutions contin
ue, avoids their effectiveness in
arousing reactions and discus
sions on the part of educators,
education administrators, and stu
dents, exemplified by Mr. Baker’s
letter, even if the thinking of the
vast army of apolitical voters re
mains as unaffected by these dem
onstrations, or PACE and the
Peace Corps. It may also be hoped
that Congressmen and other elect
ed officials will eventually cease
ignoring these expressions of the
future electorate. Considering this
I cannot conclude that student
demonstrations are ineffective
and wasteful.

DEMONSTRATIONS
Editor, The Daily;
I am not accustomed to defend
ing indefensible subjects, but a
few points in Mr. Baker’s letter
to The Daily of April 26 merit
discussion.
Mr. Baker first states his opin
ions that student demonstrations
are a “waste of expensively
trained valuable human re
sources,” and that the “actual suc
cess of such demonstrations is de
batable.” My support of student
demonstrations under those terms
is admittedly indefensible. A unit
of humanity, trained by modern,
expensive methods IS wasting the
academic facilities of his universi
ty if these are forsaken three
hours in favor of a political dem
onstration. Furthermore, that
atomic testing has been resumed,
that prisoners continue to be exe
cuted, and that HUAC proceed
ings remain undeterred, do leave
the quantitative success of the
demonstrations open to question.
However, by the very nature of
the questions involved in these
demonstrations, questions which
represent trends of thought in
our society, I feel the discussion
should involve qualitative terms
in interpreting the “facts” of the
case. First, that an interest in
politics and political institutions

is encouraged in most American
universities is exemplified in stu
dent governments, Political Un
ions, and the allowance of parti
san and non-partisan student com
mittees. This indicates a differ
ence in “education” and “train
