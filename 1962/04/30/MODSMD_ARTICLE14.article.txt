Discussions about college drink
ing often begin with arguments
relating drinking to alcoholism.
There is, of course, some relation
ship; if no alcohol were available,
there could be no alcoholism.
Plainly, though, only a minority
of drinkers ever become alcohol
ics and, as proven by the Prohi
bition Period, alcohol cannot be
legislated out of existence.
A more realistic argument con
cerning college drinking is based
on the belief that early consump
tion of alcohol is a partial cause
of alcoholism. Yet, one of the few
consistent finding in studies of al
coholics is the low rate of alco
holism among Italians despite
the fact that they generally begin
drinking wine in childhood.
France, however, which shares
with Italy the custom of wine
drinking during childhood, has a
rate of alcoholism approximately
equal to that in the United States.

Thus, the evidence suggests that
early drinking neither promotes
nor deters alcoholism.
PROPONENTS of campus
drinking have been heard to ar
gue for the possibility of “edu
cating for moderation.” No ex
periment has been tried, but I
doubt very much that there could
be an appreciable effect upon al
coholism through specific train
ing in consumption of alcohol
among university students.
(There is evidence that ritual use
of alcohol and values stressing
behavior antithetic to consump
tion of alcohol influence alcohol
ism rales.) Research has shown
relationships between adult alco
holism and early family environ
ments pointing to deep psycholog
ical needs which the practice of
alcoholism can partially allay.
The dilemma of the potential al
coholic lies in his psychological
(and possibly, physical) makeup.
Changes in drinking laws would
not affect this makeup.
Although discussions about
drinking on campus often involve
questions about alcoholism, these
discussions can, perhaps more
fruitfully be viewed in the moral
context from which they arise. On
the one hand, those who argue

that drinking should not he per
mitted on campus tend to believe
that drinking itself is wrong.
They call upon support from the
fact that state laws prohibit sale
of liquor to minors. Yet Stan
ford’s laws go even beyond the
state’s.

On the other hand, those who
argue that drinking should be
permitted on campus tend to base
their position on the moral
ground that an act is w’rong only
if it leads to bad consequences.
They see that students drink,
often more than moderately, and
they reason that if drinking were
permitted on campus, Stanford
would not be unintentionally en
couraging driving under the in
fluence of alcohol and that there
would be more controls on drink
ing behavior if drinking itself
were not a forbidden activity.
They point to universities and
colleges, not unlike Stanford in
academic achievements, which
allow drinking and have fewer
automobile accidents or other in
cidents attributable to drinking.
LIKE OTHER moral problems,
the question of drinking on cam
pus cannot bo settled solely by
resort to facts. One must, in the
last analysis, appeal to "moral

sentiment.” My own moral senti
ment does not concur in condemn
ing drinking. Further, even if one
assumes the immorality of drink
ing, I would argue (with John
Stuart Mill) that this is not the
province of the law. It seems to
me that one cannot permit the
introduction of laws designed
solely to prevent adults from
harming themselves without seri
ously infringing upon one of the
basic tenets of a liberal society
that no one is better fitted to
judge behavior than the individu
al himself, and that laws are prop
erly introduced only to maximize
the possibility of exercising this
freedom.

Although discussions about
drinking on campus often involve
questions about alcoholism, these
discussions can, perhaps more
fruitfully be viewed in the moral
context from which they arise. On
the one hand, those who argue

that drinking should not he per
mitted on campus tend to believe
that drinking itself is wrong.
They call upon support from the
fact that state laws prohibit sale
of liquor to minors. Yet Stan
ford’s laws go even beyond the
state’s.

On the other hand, those who
argue that drinking should be
permitted on campus tend to base
their position on the moral
ground that an act is w’rong only
if it leads to bad consequences.
They see that students drink,
often more than moderately, and
they reason that if drinking were
permitted on campus, Stanford
would not be unintentionally en
couraging driving under the in
fluence of alcohol and that there
would be more controls on drink
ing behavior if drinking itself
were not a forbidden activity.
They point to universities and
colleges, not unlike Stanford in
academic achievements, which
allow drinking and have fewer
automobile accidents or other in
cidents attributable to drinking.
LIKE OTHER moral problems,
the question of drinking on cam
pus cannot bo settled solely by
resort to facts. One must, in the
last analysis, appeal to "moral

sentiment.” My own moral senti
ment does not concur in condemn
ing drinking. Further, even if one
assumes the immorality of drink
ing, I would argue (with John
Stuart Mill) that this is not the
province of the law. It seems to
me that one cannot permit the
introduction of laws designed
solely to prevent adults from
harming themselves without seri
ously infringing upon one of the
basic tenets of a liberal society
that no one is better fitted to
judge behavior than the individu
al himself, and that laws are prop
erly introduced only to maximize
the possibility of exercising this
freedom.

Discussions about college drink
ing often begin with arguments
relating drinking to alcoholism.
There is, of course, some relation
ship; if no alcohol were available,
there could be no alcoholism.
Plainly, though, only a minority
of drinkers ever become alcohol
ics and, as proven by the Prohi
bition Period, alcohol cannot be
legislated out of existence.
A more realistic argument con
cerning college drinking is based
on the belief that early consump
tion of alcohol is a partial cause
of alcoholism. Yet, one of the few
consistent finding in studies of al
coholics is the low rate of alco
holism among Italians despite
the fact that they generally begin
drinking wine in childhood.

with Italy the custom of wine

permitted on campus, Stanford
would not be unintentionally en
couraging driving under the in
fluence of alcohol and that there
would be more controls on drink
ing behavior if drinking itself
were not a forbidden activity.
They point to universities and
colleges, not unlike Stanford in
academic achievements, which
allow drinking and have fewer
automobile accidents or other in
cidents attributable to drinking.
LIKE OTHER moral problems,
the question of drinking on cam
pus cannot bo settled solely by
resort to facts. One must, in the
last analysis, appeal to "moral

sentiment.” My own moral senti
ment does not concur in condemn
ing drinking. Further, even if one
assumes the immorality of drink
ing, I would argue (with John
Stuart Mill) that this is not the
province of the law. It seems to
me that one cannot permit the
introduction of laws designed
solely to prevent adults from
harming themselves without seri
ously infringing upon one of the
basic tenets of a liberal society
that no one is better fitted to
judge behavior than the individu
al himself, and that laws are prop
erly introduced only to maximize
the possibility of exercising this
freedom.
