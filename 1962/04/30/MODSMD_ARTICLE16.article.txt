Drove in the winning run
Joe Schultz, Stanford’s second
relief pitcher, came in to quell
the uprising.
Newell was the hero of the
game, pitching four shutout innings before the disastrous seventh. Schultz came in and did not
allow a run to save the Indians’
win.
Friday, in a long, cold, wet
game, the relief pitching of War
ren Newell and Joe Schultz led
Stanford to its second league win
over UCLA, 10-9. The Indians
showed hitting power, hut the
game was almost a comedy of er
rors with both teams having six
errors.
In the first inning UCLA start
ed strong and scored three runs
on two hits and two Card errors.
The Bruins scored again in the
second inning, but didn't tally
again until the seventh inning.
Stanord got one run in the first,
Greg Post scoring on an infield
error. The Indians went ahead in
the second with four runs.
Two scored on Rich Ferraz-
Zano's single, and a third scored
on the left-fielder’s throwing er
ror. Jim Chenu’s single drove in
Ferrazzano.
A pair of errors by shortstop
Ezell Singleton, a single by Chenu
and Bob Overman’s sacrifice fly
added three more runs in the
fourth. Bob Hensler drove Stan
ford’s last two runs with a single
in the sixth.
Up ’til the seventh inning, New
ell, who relieved starter John Le
Compte, has been able to pitch
his way out of trouble, but in the
seventh, the Bruins’ luck changed.
They scored five runs on only one
hit and three Indian errors. 6-5
