# Troy Loses 15-4, 5-4

### ROGER MENDELSON 
With two out, the score tied,
and the bases loaded, pinch hitter
Skip Lawrence came up to the
plate in the seventh and final in
ning of the second game in Sat
urday’s double-header against
USC, and smashed the first pitch
400 feet to left-center, driving in
the winning run.

Although only a handful of tho
crowd of 1000 remained at the
shadow-darkened but joy-lit |
Sunken Diamond at this point, it I
was Stanford’s finest baseball 1
hour as Coach Dutch Fehring’s j
team had swept two games from j
the nationally fourth-ranked Tro-1
jans, 15-4 and 5-4.
The Trojans at no time during |
the six hours of play justified
this rating. Nine pitchers served
up a total of 18 walks and plenty
of fat pitches, while the fielders
contributed six errors. Meanwhile,
the batters managed only 14 hits,
putting more than two hits to
gether in only two different in
nings.
THE INDIANS were a frustrat
ed group going into that seventh
inning. For the past three innings
they had been trying to tie up the
game after the Trojans had taken j
a 3-0 first inning lead. However,
six bases on balls, two SC errors,
a hit batsman, and three singles,
netted them only three runs and
seven men left on base. Mean
while USC had added a run, so
they led 4-3 after six and a half
innings.
Then, right on cue in the sev
enth, pitcher Mike Macklin con- i
tinned in SC’s scatter-arm style j
by walking the first two Indians,
the potential tying and winning |
runs. An error filled the bases,
and with one out, Joel Shulman’s *
rocket sacrifice fly to right tied |
the game.
With two men out then, the In- ]
dians had to win it, because it was I
too dark to start another inning.
So Bob Overman singled to left, |
but SC’s speedy outfielder Willie [
Brown charged the ball, prevent- {
ing the runner on second from I
scoring. But he scored anyway, a j
few seconds later, on Lawrence’s j
long drive.
Going almost unnoticed with |
all the hitting heroics was Stan-1
ford pitcher Jim Lonborg’s |
strong performance, including 12 |
strikeouts and only one walk.
THE FIRST GAME was all
Stanford hitting, assisted by SC |
pitching and fielding lor lack |
thereof), and Darrell Suther-1
land’s hurling. The spindly pitch- j
ing ace completed the game for |
his fourth win, striking out
twelve and walking eight. He I
lengthened his string of consecu- j
tive scoreless innings to 23 1 ;! be- 1
fore the Trojans scored three j
runs in the third.
Stanford wiped those out with
an eight-run fifth and a five-run
eighth. In all they made 15 runs |
and 14 hits, (heir third largest I
scoring production this year.

In other Stanford sports
action, the golf team met San
Jose State, and the tennis
team competed in the Ojai
tennis tournament. For de

few seconds later, on Lawrence’s j
long drive.
Going almost unnoticed with |
all the hitting heroics was Stan-1
ford pitcher Jim Lonborg’s |
strong performance, including 12 |
strikeouts and only one walk.
THE FIRST GAME was all
Stanford hitting, assisted by SC |
pitching and fielding lor lack |
thereof), and Darrell Suther-1
land’s hurling. The spindly pitch- j
ing ace completed the game for |
his fourth win, striking out
twelve and walking eight. He I
lengthened his string of consecu- j
tive scoreless innings to 23 1 ;! be- 1
fore the Trojans scored three j
runs in the third.
Stanford wiped those out with
an eight-run fifth and a five-run
eighth. In all they made 15 runs |
and 14 hits, (heir third largest I
scoring production this year.

In other Stanford sports
action, the golf team met San
Jose State, and the tennis
team competed in the Ojai
tennis tournament. For de
tails see tomorrow's Daily.
With two out, the score tied,
and the bases loaded, pinch hitter
Skip Lawrence came up to the
plate in the seventh and final in
ning of the second game in Sat
urday’s double-header against
USC, and smashed the first pitch
400 feet to left-center, driving in
the winning run.

Although only a handful of tho
crowd of 1000 remained at the
shadow-darkened but joy-lit |
Sunken Diamond at this point, it I
was Stanford’s finest baseball 1
hour as Coach Dutch Fehring’s j
team had swept two games from j
the nationally fourth-ranked Tro-1
jans, 15-4 and 5-4.
The Trojans at no time during |
the six hours of play justified
this rating. Nine pitchers served
up a total of 18 walks and plenty
of fat pitches, while the fielders
contributed six errors. Meanwhile,
the batters managed only 14 hits,
putting more than two hits to
gether in only two different in
nings.
THE INDIANS were a frustrat
ed group going into that seventh
inning. For the past three innings
they had been trying to tie up the
game after the Trojans had taken j
a 3-0 first inning lead. However,
six bases on balls, two SC errors,
a hit batsman, and three singles,
netted them only three runs and
seven men left on base. Mean
while USC had added a run, so
they led 4-3 after six and a half
innings.
Then, right on cue in the sev
enth, pitcher Mike Macklin con- i
tinned in SC’s scatter-arm style j
by walking the first two Indians,
the potential tying and winning |
runs. An error filled the bases,
and with one out, Joel Shulman’s *
rocket sacrifice fly to right tied |
the game.
With two men out then, the In- ]
dians had to win it, because it was I
too dark to start another inning.
So Bob Overman singled to left, |
but SC’s speedy outfielder Willie [
Brown charged the ball, prevent- {
ing the runner on second from I
scoring. But he scored anyway, a j
few seconds later, on Lawrence’s j
long drive.
