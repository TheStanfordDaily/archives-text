# Construction Fence Becomes Art Show
## 
### 
Stanford in San Francisco is not
our newest campus. But it is a
bright island of Stanford art in
the midst of the bustle of buses
and cars, pneumatic drills and
cranes, pedestrians and workers.
Stanford artists with vigorous
concentration and imagination
created it there last week ... on
a fence.
EXECUTIVES at Albert-Lovett
Corp., which is building the 17-
story Fontana Community Apart
ments, wanted more than the usu
al mudspattered planks to shield
pedestrians from the construction
beyond. Stanford students gave
them more than more.
“Fontana contacted me,” Asso
ciate Professor of Art and Archi
tecture Matt Kahn said. They
wanted something, anything,
painted on the panels of the 260-
foot fence. “Here was an oppor
tunity to prove not only how
strong we are but how diverse
we are,” Kahn said.
Last Thursday morning 29 art
and architecture department stu
dents began competing, each on
his own panel, each personally
expressing his own art. The con
test with prizes given by Albert-
Lovett was over by 4 p.m.
THE DIVERSITY really spar
kled from the nudes and trees and
stars to Jim Malott’s acetylene
torch and paint creation. What
had originally been meant to be
some gay decoration became the
main show, and Pinkerton guards
were ordered. The functional
drab fence, now valuable with
displays, will be guarded for nine
days. All can see it at North Point
between Polk Street and Van

Ness Avenue. After that it will
be placed on exhibit at a more ap
propriate place.
George Culler, Director of the
San Francisco Museum, Anita
Sultan, President of the Commit
tee for Art, and Richard Bowman,
a contemporary painter, the
board of jurors, were all quite
“impressed,” said Kahn.
Alex Dority, 21, of Burlingame,
won the $2OO first prize with his
college of cardboard and news
paper. Michael Moore, 20, of Po
mona, took the $lOO second prize,
and Jim Bischoff, 23, of Wood
side, $5O for third place.

Last Thursday morning 29 art
and architecture department stu
dents began competing, each on
his own panel, each personally
expressing his own art. The con
test with prizes given by Albert-
Lovett was over by 4 p.m.
THE DIVERSITY really spar
kled from the nudes and trees and
stars to Jim Malott’s acetylene
torch and paint creation. What
had originally been meant to be
some gay decoration became the
main show, and Pinkerton guards
were ordered. The functional
drab fence, now valuable with
displays, will be guarded for nine
days. All can see it at North Point
between Polk Street and Van

Ness Avenue. After that it will
be placed on exhibit at a more ap
propriate place.
George Culler, Director of the
San Francisco Museum, Anita
Sultan, President of the Commit
tee for Art, and Richard Bowman,
a contemporary painter, the
board of jurors, were all quite
“impressed,” said Kahn.
Alex Dority, 21, of Burlingame,
won the $2OO first prize with his
college of cardboard and news
paper. Michael Moore, 20, of Po

side, $5O for third place.


BETH JENSKY (RIGHT) AND MICHAEL MOORE and others work on their masterpieces on a fence in
San Francisco. The owners, Albert-Lovett Corp., are pulling a giant version of Tom Sawyer's whitewashing gimmick, one could say,
Stanford in San Francisco is not
our newest campus. But it is a
bright island of Stanford art in
the midst of the bustle of buses
and cars, pneumatic drills and
cranes, pedestrians and workers.
Stanford artists with vigorous
concentration and imagination
created it there last week ... on
a fence.
EXECUTIVES at Albert-Lovett
Corp., which is building the 17-
story Fontana Community Apart
ments, wanted more than the usu
al mudspattered planks to shield
pedestrians from the construction
beyond. Stanford students gave
them more than more.
“Fontana contacted me,” Asso
ciate Professor of Art and Archi
tecture Matt Kahn said. They
wanted something, anything,
painted on the panels of the 260-
foot fence. “Here was an oppor
tunity to prove not only how
strong we are but how diverse
we are,” Kahn said.
