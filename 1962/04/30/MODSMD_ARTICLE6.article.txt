# Deans Support Liquor Change
## 
### 
The "new liquor policy” has re
ceived further support from the
administration. Dwight Clark,
dean of freshman men, and David
Larimer and Allard K. Lowen
stein, assistant deans of men,
gave their views in statements
to The Daily. The statement is
printed hero in its entirety;
“All sincere efforts to improve
the educational climate of the Uni
versity should be welcomed. We
arc convinced that the present
discussion about liquor regula
tions among students, faculty,
and administrators, is such an ef
fort.

“The present situation is far
from ideal. A greater willingness
by students to participate in de
cisions concerning regulations
governing their behavior, and in
the upholding of those regula
tions, should not be a source of
concern or discouragement. It
does not seem sensible for stu
dents to expect to have a share in
making such decisions unless
they are prepared to help carry
them out. Nor does it seem realis
tic to expect students to assume a
great share of the responsibility
for carrying out such decisions
unless they have had a share in
making them.”
