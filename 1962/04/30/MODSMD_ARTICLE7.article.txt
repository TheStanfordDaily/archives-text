# An Interaction with America
## 
### ASHOK DATAR 
ASSU Foreign Scholar from India
Po Chong, in her article in
The Daily, did a wonderful job of
giving a broad and adequate ac
count of the ASSU Foreign Schol
arship Program and relieved the
rest of us from repeating it.
It may sound formal for me to
again express my heartfelt grati-

ludo to the Stan
,i ford student
body, in general,
and the Foreign
Scholarship Com
mission, in par
ticular. But the
year that is fast
, becoming past
for me, is so full
of exciting and
i colorful experi
ences that it is
only too mean-

ingful to indulge
in this otherwise space-wasting
courtesy.
U S U A I. L V foreign students
either prove to he shy academici
ans or simpiy "lots of fun” ori
ented playboys. This is quite
natural when available outlets
and assortments of students most
favor this situation.
Academicians (I decline to com
ment about the second category!)
are highly useful for taking ad
vanced and specialized knowledge
back to their countries, thus con
tributing to the growth of new

nations, etc.; but the story does
not end here.
Cross-cultural study at all levels
is desperately needed. The ASSU
program is trying to satisfy this
need. This can prove to be instru
mental in avoiding the growing
danger of what Fromm calls
“National tribalism.” It is, ad
mittedly. a tiny and probably in
significant step towards "The Uni
versal Man.” if I am not too ro
mantic about it.
FALL QUARTER a seminar
was organized which dealt ex
tensively with many aspects of
American civilization. This en
abled us to relate and synchro
nize our experiences. Beside that
formal seminar, each of us is
continuously undergoing "opera
lion international friendship”
over a cup of coffee (or a glass of
beer). But this has always been
a pleasant experience.
I remember when I was back
east (in India) a bright friend of
mine told mo of his method of
dealing with foreign visitors. He
used to ask some nutty question
about the U.S. from a Russian
visitor and about the U.S.S.R.
from an American visitor. I am
realizing the sterility ol such an
approach.
It is exciting to stay in differ
ent living groups, except the
trouble of differentiating between
different Dave’s, Tom’s and
Dick’s and the like. I was par

ticularly hapy to stay with fresh
men last quarter. I am proud to
say that it is no more than myth
that they are "kids.”
I cannot hope to discuss every
thing which I find worthwhile,
but still I should indicate the
basis of my experience on the
Farm, as a real "Indian.”
I CAME to the U.S. to learn
what “an affluent society” really
moans—what it moans in an eco
nomic sense—to a sane represen
tative of scarcity. I am thinking
now that, though immensely use
ful, this outlook cannot take us
very far.
A more rewarding approach
would be to analyze the sociologi
cal and psychological effects the
possession of wealth has upon the
members of an affluent society.
It is interesting to watch people’s
behavior under different circum
stances, at wild parties, at Big
Game, at Poli Union meetings
and while doing research for a
freshman term paper.
People’s use of slang and just
of the good ol' English language
in general seems to be the most
fascinating indicator of their at
titude.
I need not hesitate to say that
this year proved to be a memor
able experience for me. I hope
that Stanford students are proud
of this program and take an in
creasing initiative in the coming
yea r.

vanced and specialized knowledge
back to their countries, thus con
tributing to the growth of new

nations, etc.; but the story does
not end here.
Cross-cultural study at all levels
is desperately needed. The ASSU
program is trying to satisfy this
need. This can prove to be instru
mental in avoiding the growing
danger of what Fromm calls
“National tribalism.” It is, ad
mittedly. a tiny and probably in
significant step towards "The Uni
versal Man.” if I am not too ro
mantic about it.
FALL QUARTER a seminar
was organized which dealt ex
tensively with many aspects of
American civilization. This en
abled us to relate and synchro
nize our experiences. Beside that
formal seminar, each of us is
continuously undergoing "opera
lion international friendship”
over a cup of coffee (or a glass of
beer). But this has always been
a pleasant experience.
I remember when I was back
east (in India) a bright friend of
mine told mo of his method of
dealing with foreign visitors. He
used to ask some nutty question
about the U.S. from a Russian
visitor and about the U.S.S.R.
from an American visitor. I am
realizing the sterility ol such an
approach.
It is exciting to stay in differ
ent living groups, except the
trouble of differentiating between
different Dave’s, Tom’s and
Dick’s and the like. I was par

ticularly hapy to stay with fresh
men last quarter. I am proud to
say that it is no more than myth
that they are "kids.”
I cannot hope to discuss every
thing which I find worthwhile,
but still I should indicate the
basis of my experience on the
Farm, as a real "Indian.”
I CAME to the U.S. to learn
what “an affluent society” really
moans—what it moans in an eco
nomic sense—to a sane represen
tative of scarcity. I am thinking
now that, though immensely use
ful, this outlook cannot take us
very far.
A more rewarding approach
would be to analyze the sociologi
cal and psychological effects the
possession of wealth has upon the
members of an affluent society.
It is interesting to watch people’s
behavior under different circum
stances, at wild parties, at Big
Game, at Poli Union meetings
and while doing research for a
freshman term paper.
People’s use of slang and just
of the good ol' English language
in general seems to be the most
fascinating indicator of their at
titude.
I need not hesitate to say that
this year proved to be a memor
able experience for me. I hope
that Stanford students are proud
of this program and take an in
creasing initiative in the coming
yea r.

about the U.S. from a Russian
visitor and about the U.S.S.R.
from an American visitor. I am
realizing the sterility ol such an
approach.
It is exciting to stay in differ
ent living groups, except the
trouble of differentiating between
different Dave’s, Tom’s and
Dick’s and the like. I was par

ticularly hapy to stay with fresh
men last quarter. I am proud to
say that it is no more than myth
that they are "kids.”
I cannot hope to discuss every
thing which I find worthwhile,
but still I should indicate the
basis of my experience on the
Farm, as a real "Indian.”
I CAME to the U.S. to learn
what “an affluent society” really
moans—what it moans in an eco
nomic sense—to a sane represen
tative of scarcity. I am thinking
now that, though immensely use
ful, this outlook cannot take us
very far.
A more rewarding approach
would be to analyze the sociologi
cal and psychological effects the
possession of wealth has upon the
members of an affluent society.
It is interesting to watch people’s
behavior under different circum
stances, at wild parties, at Big
Game, at Poli Union meetings
and while doing research for a
freshman term paper.
People’s use of slang and just
of the good ol' English language
in general seems to be the most
fascinating indicator of their at
titude.
I need not hesitate to say that
this year proved to be a memor
able experience for me. I hope
that Stanford students are proud
of this program and take an in
creasing initiative in the coming
yea r.
