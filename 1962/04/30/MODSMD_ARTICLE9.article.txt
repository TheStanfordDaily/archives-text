# French Regulars Begin Drive into OAS Stronghold
## 
### 
ORAN, Algeria (UPD—French
troops using halftracks and arm
ored cars drove a steel wedge
into the heart of Oran yesterday
to cut the city in half in the pre
lude to an all out drive to crush
the Secret Army Organization in
its own stronghold. Not a shot
was fired.
Ten units of the Moslem “local
force”—approximately 500 men—
look up positions for the first
time on the fringes of the Mos
lem suburbs which have been the
scenes of murderous OAS attacks
and where two Europeans have
been killed and 35 missing as the
Moslems struck back.
TERRORISM continued its re
lentless toll across Algeria de
spite the spectacular drive against
the OAS. By 7 p.m., nine persons
were killed throughout Algeria
and seven wounded to bring the
year’s total to 4,034 dead and
8,351 wounded.
The Oran move was dubbed
“Operation Katz” after the Oran
regional army commander, Gen.
Joseph Katz. It was successful in
its initial stage but what action
(he OAS would take in response
remained to be seen. The troops
and armor are to be kept in Oran
indefinitely.
THE OPERATION began at
8:30 a.m. when the long column
of halftracks and armored cars
flanked by infantrymen with
their fingers on the trigger began
moving up the Rue Du Generaal
Leclerc from the waterfront.

By 9:50 a.m. the city was split
in two and the downtown area
around the Place Des Victories—
traditional site of OAS demon
strations~was an armed camp.
Main intersections were heavily
guarded and civilian automobile
traffic was barred.
As the armored column moved
up from the waterfront two or
three vehicles dropped out at ev
ery intersection. Infantrymen
took up strategic positions com
manding apartment buildings and
streets and set up a battery of

machineguns overlooking a pub
lic garden and key squares and
streets.
The main purpose of Operation
Katz was to cut the city in two
and hall all civilian motor traffic
in the downtown area. OAS com
mandos recently have been open
ing fire on Moslems from speed
ing cars and escaping before se
curity forces could arrive.
