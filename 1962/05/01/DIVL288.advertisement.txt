You really don’t
have to be a sculler
to qualify for R/A's
famous crew socks.
They’re everybody's
favorite socks. Why?
Because they stretch
to fit any feet, but
have bands of color
on top to thwart
roommate thievery.
In all-purpose white
to match your T-shirt.
Now, during our
AFTER EASTER SALE,
just 79c.
