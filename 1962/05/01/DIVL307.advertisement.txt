CRAM COURSE NO. 4: BATHYMETRY
Continuing our series of pre-final exam cram courses, today wc
take up bathymetry—the study of ocean depths.
Admittedly, this is not a terribly popular course on most
campuses. And small wonder. In the whole world there is only
one hathyscape, and only two people can get into it.
Nevertheless, the study of ocean depths is of great impor
tance. Why, do you realize that the ocean is by far the world's
largest biological environment? The ocean has more than three
hundred times as much living room as all the continents and
islands combined! Unfortunately, only fishes live in it.
And small wonder. Who’d want to live some place where he
couldn’t smoke? Surely not I! I wouldn’t give up my good
Marlboro Cigarettes for the Atlantic and the Pacific put to
gether. Nothing could induce me to forego Marlboro’s fine
mellow flavor, Marlboro’s clean white filter, Marlboro’s flip-top
box that really fli|>s, Marlboro’s soft pack that's really soft.
Let others repair to the spacious deeps. Mo, 1 will stick with
my Marlboros and the tiny garret I share with a tympanist.
But I digress. Buck to the oceans. The largest, as we know,
is the Pacific, which was discovered by Balboa, a Spaniard of
great vision. To give you an idea of Balboa’s vision, he first
saw the Pacific while standing on a peak in Darien, which is
in Connecticut.
Even more astounding, when Balboa reached San Francisco,
he clearly saw the Hawaiian Islands! Being, as we know, a
friendly cuss, Balboa waved merrily to the Hawaiian- and
shouted, “Great little ocean you got here, kids!" The Ilawaiians.
also, as we know, friendly cusses, waved back, declared a half
holiday, organized a luau, built a cheery fire over which they
prepared several gallons of |x>i, a suckling pig, and Captain
Cook. This, of course, was the origin of Cooking.
But I digress. The Pacific, I say, is the largest ocean and also
the deepest.The Mindanao Trench, off the Philippines, measures
more than 5,000 fathoms in depth. (It should be pointed out
here that ocean depths are measured in fathoms—-lengths of
six feet—after Sir Walter Fathom, a noted British sea measurer
of the seventeenth century who, upon his twenty-first birthday,
was given a string six feet long with which he used to go
scampering all over England measuring sea water until he was
arrested for loitering. A passion for measuring seems to have
run in the family; Fathom’s cousin, Sir Sol Furlong, spent all
his waking hours measuring race tracks until Charles II had
him beheaded in honor of the opening of the London School of
Economics.)
But I digress. Let us, as the poet Masefield said, go down to
the seas again. (The seas, incidentally, have ever been a favorite
subject for poets and composers.) Who docs not remember
Tennyson’s “Break, break, break”? Or Byron’s “Roll on, thou
dark and deep blue ocean, roll”? Or the many hearty sea chanties
that have enriched our folk music—songs like “Sailing Through
Kansas” and “1 11 Swab Your Deck If You’ll Swab Mine” and
“The Artificial Respiration Polka.” My own favorite sea chanty
goes like this:
A girl loved a sailor and he did Jill her,
And she did weep and roar-ho!
I ntil she found a perfect filter,
And a perfect smoke—Marlboro!
Sing lug, sing ho, sing ring-a-ding-ding,
Sing tars and spars and patches,
Sing park and box and lots to like,
Ami don’t forget the mutches’ ® 196J m.ishutm.i.
The landlocked makers of Marlboro wish you smooth sail
ing through your linal exams and smooth smoking—with
Marlboro, of course. Have YOU settled hack with a Marlboro
lately?

CRAM COURSE NO. 4: BATHYMETRY
Continuing our series of pre-final exam cram courses, today wc
take up bathymetry—the study of ocean depths.
Admittedly, this is not a terribly popular course on most
campuses. And small wonder. In the whole world there is only
one hathyscape, and only two people can get into it.
Nevertheless, the study of ocean depths is of great impor
tance. Why, do you realize that the ocean is by far the world's
largest biological environment? The ocean has more than three
hundred times as much living room as all the continents and
islands combined! Unfortunately, only fishes live in it.
And small wonder. Who’d want to live some place where he
couldn’t smoke? Surely not I! I wouldn’t give up my good
Marlboro Cigarettes for the Atlantic and the Pacific put to
gether. Nothing could induce me to forego Marlboro’s fine
mellow flavor, Marlboro’s clean white filter, Marlboro’s flip-top
box that really fli|>s, Marlboro’s soft pack that's really soft.
Let others repair to the spacious deeps. Mo, 1 will stick with
my Marlboros and the tiny garret I share with a tympanist.
But I digress. Buck to the oceans. The largest, as we know,
is the Pacific, which was discovered by Balboa, a Spaniard of
great vision. To give you an idea of Balboa’s vision, he first
saw the Pacific while standing on a peak in Darien, which is
in Connecticut.
Even more astounding, when Balboa reached San Francisco,
he clearly saw the Hawaiian Islands! Being, as we know, a
friendly cuss, Balboa waved merrily to the Hawaiian- and
shouted, “Great little ocean you got here, kids!" The Ilawaiians.
also, as we know, friendly cusses, waved back, declared a half
holiday, organized a luau, built a cheery fire over which they
prepared several gallons of |x>i, a suckling pig, and Captain
Cook. This, of course, was the origin of Cooking.
But I digress. The Pacific, I say, is the largest ocean and also
the deepest.The Mindanao Trench, off the Philippines, measures
more than 5,000 fathoms in depth. (It should be pointed out
here that ocean depths are measured in fathoms—-lengths of
six feet—after Sir Walter Fathom, a noted British sea measurer
of the seventeenth century who, upon his twenty-first birthday,
was given a string six feet long with which he used to go
scampering all over England measuring sea water until he was
arrested for loitering. A passion for measuring seems to have
run in the family; Fathom’s cousin, Sir Sol Furlong, spent all
his waking hours measuring race tracks until Charles II had
him beheaded in honor of the opening of the London School of
Economics.)
But I digress. Let us, as the poet Masefield said, go down to
the seas again. (The seas, incidentally, have ever been a favorite
subject for poets and composers.) Who docs not remember
Tennyson’s “Break, break, break”? Or Byron’s “Roll on, thou

But I digress. The Pacific, I say, is the largest ocean and also
the deepest.The Mindanao Trench, off the Philippines, measures
more than 5,000 fathoms in depth. (It should be pointed out
here that ocean depths are measured in fathoms—-lengths of
six feet—after Sir Walter Fathom, a noted British sea measurer
of the seventeenth century who, upon his twenty-first birthday,
was given a string six feet long with which he used to go
scampering all over England measuring sea water until he was
arrested for loitering. A passion for measuring seems to have
run in the family; Fathom’s cousin, Sir Sol Furlong, spent all
his waking hours measuring race tracks until Charles II had
him beheaded in honor of the opening of the London School of
Economics.)
But I digress. Let us, as the poet Masefield said, go down to
the seas again. (The seas, incidentally, have ever been a favorite
subject for poets and composers.) Who docs not remember
Tennyson’s “Break, break, break”? Or Byron’s “Roll on, thou
dark and deep blue ocean, roll”? Or the many hearty sea chanties
that have enriched our folk music—songs like “Sailing Through
Kansas” and “1 11 Swab Your Deck If You’ll Swab Mine” and
“The Artificial Respiration Polka.” My own favorite sea chanty
goes like this:
A girl loved a sailor and he did Jill her,
And she did weep and roar-ho!
I ntil she found a perfect filter,
And a perfect smoke—Marlboro!
Sing lug, sing ho, sing ring-a-ding-ding,
Sing tars and spars and patches,
Sing park and box and lots to like,
Ami don’t forget the mutches’ ® 196J m.ishutm.i.
The landlocked makers of Marlboro wish you smooth sail
ing through your linal exams and smooth smoking—with
Marlboro, of course. Have YOU settled hack with a Marlboro
lately?

CRAM COURSE NO. 4: BATHYMETRY
Continuing our series of pre-final exam cram courses, today wc
take up bathymetry—the study of ocean depths.
Admittedly, this is not a terribly popular course on most
campuses. And small wonder. In the whole world there is only
one hathyscape, and only two people can get into it.
Nevertheless, the study of ocean depths is of great impor
tance. Why, do you realize that the ocean is by far the world's
largest biological environment? The ocean has more than three
hundred times as much living room as all the continents and
islands combined! Unfortunately, only fishes live in it.
And small wonder. Who’d want to live some place where he
couldn’t smoke? Surely not I! I wouldn’t give up my good
Marlboro Cigarettes for the Atlantic and the Pacific put to
gether. Nothing could induce me to forego Marlboro’s fine
mellow flavor, Marlboro’s clean white filter, Marlboro’s flip-top
box that really fli|>s, Marlboro’s soft pack that's really soft.
Let others repair to the spacious deeps. Mo, 1 will stick with
my Marlboros and the tiny garret I share with a tympanist.
But I digress. Buck to the oceans. The largest, as we know,
is the Pacific, which was discovered by Balboa, a Spaniard of
great vision. To give you an idea of Balboa’s vision, he first
saw the Pacific while standing on a peak in Darien, which is
in Connecticut.
Even more astounding, when Balboa reached San Francisco,
he clearly saw the Hawaiian Islands! Being, as we know, a
friendly cuss, Balboa waved merrily to the Hawaiian- and
shouted, “Great little ocean you got here, kids!" The Ilawaiians.
also, as we know, friendly cusses, waved back, declared a half
holiday, organized a luau, built a cheery fire over which they
prepared several gallons of |x>i, a suckling pig, and Captain
Cook. This, of course, was the origin of Cooking.
But I digress. The Pacific, I say, is the largest ocean and also
