## 
### 
Trustees ol Stanford retain final control over campus regula
tions concerning alcoholic beverages, the President’s Office re
minded students yesterday.
In a statement issued two days prior to a campus-wide student
referendum concerning liquor regulations, the President’s Office

said: “To clarify legal aspects of
the situation, the University again
is reviewing the matter of pos
session and consumption of alco
holic beverages in University
residences with the appropriate
Santa Clara County and State of
California officials.
“PRELIMINARY discussions
as have discussions in earlier
years—indicate that the posses
sion and consumption of alcoholic
beverages within University resi
dences would be in violation of
provisions of the Penal Code and
the Alcoholic Beverage Control
Act. regardless of informal, well
meaning student opinion to the
contrary.

iJim Stewart, law student and
legal advisor for the sponsors of
the referendum, yesterday told
The Daily, “I have made a thor
ough search of the California Pe
nal Code and the Alcoholic Bev
erage Control Act. I find no sta
tute which would make posses
sion and consumption of alcoholic
beverages by an adult in univer
sity residences a violation of state
law. If the President’s office has
found a statute stating othewise,
it should be revealed now.
“I HAVE ALSO talked with
state authorities who could not
cite such a statute when asked to
do so. The President’s office may
wish to consult with professors
at the Law School on this matter.
We do not deny that the Board
of Trustees has final control. Our
statute merely takes students out
of the business of enforcement of
a University ruling we think is
unrealistic.)
“THE RESULTS of Wednes
day’s referendum will be consid
ered by the President of the Uni
versity atrd the Board of Trustees
as an expression of student opin
ion.

“It should be made clear, how
ever. that regulations regarding
the use of liquor on campus arc

sion and consumption of alcoholic
beverages within University resi
dences would be in violation of
provisions of the Penal Code and
the Alcoholic Beverage Control
Act. regardless of informal, well
meaning student opinion to the
contrary.

iJim Stewart, law student and
legal advisor for the sponsors of
the referendum, yesterday told
The Daily, “I have made a thor
ough search of the California Pe
nal Code and the Alcoholic Bev
erage Control Act. I find no sta
tute which would make posses
sion and consumption of alcoholic
beverages by an adult in univer
sity residences a violation of state
law. If the President’s office has
found a statute stating othewise,
it should be revealed now.
“I HAVE ALSO talked with
state authorities who could not
cite such a statute when asked to
do so. The President’s office may
wish to consult with professors
at the Law School on this matter.
We do not deny that the Board
of Trustees has final control. Our
statute merely takes students out
of the business of enforcement of
a University ruling we think is
unrealistic.)
“THE RESULTS of Wednes
day’s referendum will be consid
ered by the President of the Uni
versity atrd the Board of Trustees
as an expression of student opin
ion.

“It should be made clear, how
ever. that regulations regarding
the use of liquor on campus arc
within the jurisdiction of the
Board of Trustees.”
