# The 						Responsibility Of U.S. Television

### 
Whenever anyone suggests that television is not beginning to
realize its potential to stimulate and inform the American public
the reply from sponsors, producers and networks alike is usually
something to the effect that they are giving the public “what it
wants.”
The truth of this position has always seemed questionable to
us, but an example of what the criteria really are for what the
public sees has just appeared, and it sheds light in this area.
“The Defenders is one of three dramatic series on television
worth watching. A creation of Reginald Rose, who has in the
past written some of the best drama ever to appear on television,
the show is generally well written and thought provoking.
A while ago the three sponsors of “The Defenders” were in
formed that an upcoming episode was going to deal with abor
tion. All three immediately cancelled their affiliation with that
particular show. The Spiedel watchband company then agreed
to sponsor the show in its entirety. The show was previewed for
all CBS network affiliates and 10 of them refused to show it. To
its credit the San Francisco outlet, KPIX, was not one of the 10
and it broadcast the show last Saturday.
Again we might ask what determines what the public sees on
its television screens. Obviously the answer is that anything that
does not measure up to the low common denominator of un
controversial, unimportant material hasn’t got a chance. As long
as American television refuses to take itself seriously as a medium
for the dissemination of important and educational information,
it can hardly expect anyone else to take it seriously either.
