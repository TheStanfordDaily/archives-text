(“The Cuban Invasion: (he Chron
icle of a Disaster” by Tati Szulc
and Karl F. Meyer: Balluntine, 50
cents.)

“If any conspiracy existed, it
was a conspiracy of circumstance
that pitted a large, affluent nation
led by complacent men who had
forgotten the meaning of a revo
lution against a proud, small
country led by gifted and intoler
antly zealous men.”
This indictment of the United
States is one of the central
themes of “The Cuban Invasion,”
an analysis of Cuban-American
relations, 1959-1961. The co
authors, Tad Szulc and Karl Mey
er, are journalists for the New
York Times and Washington
Post, respectively.
THE AUTHORS assert that
American misunderstanding and
complacency resulted in the U.S.’s
being put “in the distressing po
sition of breaking the same
treaties (prohibiting unilateral
armed intervention within the
Americas) that Dr. Castro had
been exhorted to respect.”
Accusing (he Eisenhower Ad
ministration of sympathy for Ba
tista, the authors deplore the am
bivalence of American foreign
policy that combined an arms em
bargo against Batista’s Cuba with
a U.S. Military Mission in Ha
vana helping to train Batista’s
soldiers.
They suggest that this ambiva
lence was the product of John
Foster Dulles’ boredom with
South America and his assuming
that the Army in Cuba would pre
vent leftists from seizing power.
ONCE CASTRO had seized
power, the U.S. unwittingly aided
the communists in the govern
ment in their struggle against the

moderates, according to the au
thors. They point out that the
U.S. did not prevent airplanes
from taking off from Florida
when the U.S. knew that these
planes wore dropping incendiary
bombs on Cuban sugar fields.
The sanctimonious American
attitude toward expropriation of
American-owned land without
compensation also aided extreme
leftists within the Cuban govern
ment, the authors stale.
The American reaction allowed
Castro to brand moderate pro-
Americans as anti-communists
and. therefore, counterrevolution
aries. Castro could then purge the
moderafes without popular dis
approval within Cuba, according
to Szulc and Meyer.
This reasoning is sound, and
the authors do not make the ques
tionable extension that some lib
erals make: that Cuba would not
have become communist if the
U.S. had not alienated Castro.
ALONG WITH the customary
indictments of the Eisenhower
Administration, the CIA, and the
Kennedy Administration, Szulc
and Meyer add the pathetic pic
ture of Adlai Stevenson as he told
the U.N. with eloquent conviction
that a recent air raid over Cuba
was the work of Cuban defectors
not American-based planes. Ste
venson, the authors x’elate, had
been given a State Department
‘‘cover story so flimsy that the
Cubans were able” to expose the
American deception.
The authors conclude that it
was morally defensible for the
U.S. to try to depose a Commu
nist dictator, but they question
the wisdom of having tried, es
pecially with methods that
“sought to put a free press in the
position of conveying flimsy lies
that might more appropriately
appear in Pravda or Revolucion.”
