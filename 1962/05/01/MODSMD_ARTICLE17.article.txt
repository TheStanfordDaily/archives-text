# BIG STEEL'S GIFT
## Walter Lippmann 
### ROBERT G. SPIVACK 
(Waller Lippmaim is on vacation)

The United States Steel Cor
poration has accomplished for the
President what neither his per
sonal friends nor congressional
supporters have been able lo do
since the early days of the new
administration. The price rise in
steel has given the President an
opportunity to start moving once
again towards The New Frontier.
AT THK moment the steel com
panies resemble the “ultras” in
Algiers. They are deeply involved
in politics. But they have no train
ing in or understanding of poli
tics, as Roger Blough admitted.
Steelmen, like many other indus
trialists, spend too much time
talking to each other and errone
ously conclude that they know
what “the people” think.
To their amazement the French
in Algeria have discovered that
it is DeGaulle who is the voice of
France. In this country no mat
ter who is in office, it is the Pres
ident of the United States, who is
the Voice of America, not the
President of United States Steel.

The isolation of important busi
nessmen from the mainstream of
American sentiment comes at a
time when many liberal Demo
crats have found less and less to
like about domestic administra
tion policy.
THEIR DISCONTENT has
found expression in a variety of
ways. Roy Wilkins of the NAACP
was blunt about it recently in
discussing civil rights. To a
Washington audience he advised
the administration, “We have
come to collect on what you
promised us in 1960.”
On private vs. public power the
rural electric cooperatives and the
American Power Association have
grown restive at the administra
tion’s reluctance to make the
“new starts” promised during the
campaign. And they are annoyed
at what seems to be a retreat by
the Department of Interior on
some policies they thought were
already set.
Among many segments of Dem
ocrats, not just the liberals, there
is a view that it was a mistake
for Teddy Kennedy to run for the
U.S. Senate, starting at a top
rung on the political ladder. An
other disappointment has been
the administration’s unwilling
ness to make a strong fight for
federal aid to public schools.
LABOR LEADERS are worried
about certain tax incentives being
offered to business, coupled with
hesitancy on what steps might
reduce unemployment. The list of
grievances was long and it was
growing longer. While there was
no likelihood of an open break,
David Riesman, the Harvard soci
ologist, could say:

“We wish the administration
well, and I think we wish to work
within the two-party system. We
are critical but we are not alien
ated. We are also not sanguine.
But we are not wholly disaffected,
either.”
A handful of steel executives
has changed the situation.
.1 A M K S MacGREGOR Burns
quoted JFK in his book “John
Kennedy, a Political Profile” as
answering critics of his “liberal
ism”;
“I’d be happy to tell them I’m
not a liberal at all. I never joined
the Americans for Democratic
Action or the American Veterans
Committee. I’m not comfortable
with those people.”
But just as some people have
asked, “Where else is there for
the liberals to go if they break
with Kennedy?” Now the ques
tion can be asked, “Where else
is there for Kennedy to go?” The
steel companies have answered
that question for him.
THEIR ACTION was such a
rebuff to (he President that his
angry statement should have
come as no surprise to them. How
serious their miscalculation has
been remains to be seen.
In any case the President, who
has tried hard to avoid an anti
business label, knows what to ex
pect from one important sector
of the business community. But
for him it need not be a “domes
tic Cuba.” It will be interesting
to see if he picks up the ball that
the steel industry has fumbled,
or if he will allow his advantage
to disappear.
Right now, it would seem if he
pushes hard for his legislative
program he could get much of it
enacted. The public is ready to
follow the leader, if he will lead.

The United States Steel Cor
poration has accomplished for the
President what neither his per
sonal friends nor congressional
supporters have been able lo do
since the early days of the new
administration. The price rise in
steel has given the President an
opportunity to start moving once
again towards The New Frontier.
AT THK moment the steel com
panies resemble the “ultras” in
Algiers. They are deeply involved
in politics. But they have no train
ing in or understanding of poli
tics, as Roger Blough admitted.
Steelmen, like many other indus
trialists, spend too much time
talking to each other and errone
ously conclude that they know
what “the people” think.
To their amazement the French
in Algeria have discovered that
it is DeGaulle who is the voice of
France. In this country no mat
ter who is in office, it is the Pres
ident of the United States, who is
the Voice of America, not the
President of United States Steel.

The isolation of important busi
nessmen from the mainstream of
American sentiment comes at a
time when many liberal Demo
crats have found less and less to
like about domestic administra
tion policy.
THEIR DISCONTENT has
found expression in a variety of
ways. Roy Wilkins of the NAACP
was blunt about it recently in
discussing civil rights. To a
Washington audience he advised
the administration, “We have
come to collect on what you
promised us in 1960.”
On private vs. public power the
rural electric cooperatives and the
American Power Association have
grown restive at the administra
tion’s reluctance to make the
“new starts” promised during the
campaign. And they are annoyed
at what seems to be a retreat by
the Department of Interior on
some policies they thought were
already set.
Among many segments of Dem
ocrats, not just the liberals, there
is a view that it was a mistake
for Teddy Kennedy to run for the
U.S. Senate, starting at a top

sonal friends nor congressional
supporters have been able lo do
since the early days of the new
administration. The price rise in
steel has given the President an
opportunity to start moving once
again towards The New Frontier.

panies resemble the “ultras” in
Algiers. They are deeply involved
in politics. But they have no train

tics, as Roger Blough admitted.
Steelmen, like many other indus
trialists, spend too much time
talking to each other and errone

what “the people” think.
To their amazement the French
in Algeria have discovered that
it is DeGaulle who is the voice of
France. In this country no mat

President of United States Steel.

The isolation of important busi

found expression in a variety of
ways. Roy Wilkins of the NAACP
was blunt about it recently in

Washington audience he advised

On private vs. public power the
rural electric cooperatives and the
American Power Association have

the Department of Interior on
some policies they thought were
already set.
Among many segments of Dem

is a view that it was a mistake

U.S. Senate, starting at a top

other disappointment has been
the administration’s unwilling
ness to make a strong fight for
federal aid to public schools.
LABOR LEADERS are worried
about certain tax incentives being
offered to business, coupled with
hesitancy on what steps might

grievances was long and it was
growing longer. While there was

David Riesman, the Harvard soci
ologist, could say:

“We wish the administration
well, and I think we wish to work
within the two-party system. We
are critical but we are not alien

But we are not wholly disaffected,
either.”
A handful of steel executives
has changed the situation.

the steel industry has fumbled,

Right now, it would seem if he
pushes hard for his legislative
program he could get much of it
enacted. The public is ready to
follow the leader, if he will lead.
