The liquor problem at Stanford
is not a legal problem, it is not
even a moral problem.
It is primarily a practical one,
a question of whether or not the
university should sanction the
sale and consumption of alcohol
on its premises.
Many of us who live in universi
ty housing oppose such a change.
We oppose it for three reasons:
(1) Easy availability of alcohol
in a residence increases noise and
breeds lack of consideration.
Even now, dormitories are not
exceptionally quiet. Yet alcohol
has never been known to make
parties or bull-sessions more se
rene. Even the army, not notori
ous for its opposition to alcohol,
maintains a strict policy against
liquor in residences or barracks
for this reason.
(2) Easy availability of alcohol
in a residence increases the pres
sure to drink.
As everyone really knows, this
proposal does not affect only
those over the age of 21. All at
Stanford are affected. Policing of
the liquor code, already lax, could
not be expected to become more
stringent in university or frater
nity residences. Pressure upon
non-drinking students to conform

the basic cause for anyone be
ginning to drink can be expect
ed to increase accordingly.
(3) Sale of alcoholic beverages
in a student union violates the
purposes of a university.
A university seeks to encourage
the maximum development of
both the physical and mental
processes of its students. Alcohol
has never been known to stimu
late this development. A drink in
a bar on Saturday night or after
a day’s work is none of the uni
versity’s business. Sale of alco
hol on the campus is.
For these reasons. Stanford
should not remove the present re
strictions against alcohol on cam
pus. For many of us, it is not
welcome, and for all of us, not
needed.

Stanford are affected. Policing of
the liquor code, already lax, could
not be expected to become more
stringent in university or frater
nity residences. Pressure upon
non-drinking students to conform

the basic cause for anyone be
ginning to drink can be expect
ed to increase accordingly.
(3) Sale of alcoholic beverages
in a student union violates the
purposes of a university.
A university seeks to encourage
the maximum development of
both the physical and mental
processes of its students. Alcohol
has never been known to stimu
late this development. A drink in
a bar on Saturday night or after
a day’s work is none of the uni
versity’s business. Sale of alco
hol on the campus is.
For these reasons. Stanford
should not remove the present re
strictions against alcohol on cam
pus. For many of us, it is not
welcome, and for all of us, not
needed.
