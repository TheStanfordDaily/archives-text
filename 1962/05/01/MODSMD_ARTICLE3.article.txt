# Critic Talks on British Comedy
## 
### PAT SAFARJIAN 
The trend in British comic
writing, from belly-laughs to wit
and now back to belly-laughs, was
traced by V. S. Pritchett, English
writer and critic, in a speech yes
terday on the English comedy of
the past sixty years.
Dividing English literature into
two classes, Pritchett described
comedy prior to 1914 as the “ex
trovert, or masculine” type. “This
humorous literature is full of
fights and fun."
IN THE COMEDY of “Fielding,
Smollett, and Thackeray there is
high animal spirit.” The cause of
this violent action, said Pritchett,
“is repressed sexuality.”
The trend reversed in the years
from 1914 to 1940 and British
comedy switched to the "mad and
brainy introvert, or feminine, tra
dition.” Pritchett stated that
“shock is the essence of post war
humor. It is the humor of hell.”
This humor is characterized by
“sensitivity, intellectual violence
instead of physical violence, and
unabashed sexuality.” Pritchett
described the humor as “relying
heavily on dialogue and dry, la
conic wit,” quoting examples
from Firbank and others.
BUT THE “horseplay, strong
drink, and outspokenness are
coming back,” said Pritchett. He
quoted examples from Joyce
Kerry’s “The Horse’s Mouth” and
Kingsly Ames’ “Lucky Jim.”

Pritchett is director of the New
Statesman and of Nation and is
a visiting professor at Cal this
semester. Ho also contributes ma
terial for 8.8.C., and New Yorker,
and Holiday.
