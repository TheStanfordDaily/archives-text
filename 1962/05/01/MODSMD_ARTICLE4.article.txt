# Kennedy Urges Co-operation

### 
WASHINGTON (UPD —Piesi
dent Kennedy, in a down-tho-line
defense of his economic policies,
urged yesterday that business and
government drop their differ
ences and work together for
America’s betterment.

Addressing the opening session
of the U.S. Chamber of Com
merce’s 50th annual convention,
Kennedy again explained his re
cent role in persuading big steel
to drop its planned price in
creases.

But outgoing Chamber Presi
dent Richard Wagner, in a key
note speech following Kennedy’s
addres, indirectly criitcized the
President’s action and said too
much power has become concen
trated in the White House.

Wagner said the steel dispute
has led many to believe that “in
flationary pressures in this coun
try are created by business and
its so-called greedy desire for
profit.”
“Nothing could be further from
the truth.” he declared.
Wagner said steel and other
industries, for reasons of national
interest or competition, had ab
sorbed labor and other costs in
creases without raising prices.
