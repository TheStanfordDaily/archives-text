James R. Symington, Deputy
Director of Food for Peace, and
Ronald Hilton, Stanford Univer
sity professor and editor of the
“Hispanic-American Report,”
were key speakers at last week
end’s Collegiate Council for the
United Nations (CCUNi confer
ence entitled “Latin America
Evolution or Revolution?”

Because “Hunger is not a good
adviser,” Food for Peace delivers
U.S. surplus food directly into
the hands of the undernourished,
he said. Food for Peace does
more than abate hunger, said Sy
mington. He cited an instance
where school attendance has been
raised 40 per cent because the
children are fed a roll and a glass
of milk at school.
SYMINGTON believes that be
cause the U.S. demands that na
tions submit detailed reform
plans before aid will be granted,
the Alliance will force reform in
Latin America and see “that the
reach of the helpless does not ex
ceed their grasp.”
Hilton, who spoke on “The Cri
sis of Honesty in Latin America,”
presented a more sobering picture
of the Latin American challenge.
He said that while the press and
public opinion advocate combat
ting “respectable” problems, such
as Communism and hunger, they
overlook the “dishonest” but as
serious problem of gangsterism.

IT WAS BRIBERY, Hilton said,
which kept the news about U.S.
Guatamalan training bases for
the Cuban invasion out of the
U.S. press and government circles
while it was common knowledge
in Guatemala.
Hilton believes that the FBI
must stop the Americans who are
involved in gangsterism in Latin
America.

Seventy-five people attended
