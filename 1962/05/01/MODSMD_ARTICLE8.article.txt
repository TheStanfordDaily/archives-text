# Student Apathy Startling
## 
### JURGEN LANGE ASSU Foreign Scholar from West Berlin 
To analyze completely the ad
vantages of studying one year at
a foreign university would go
well beyond the scope of this ar
ticle. Therefore I would like to
limit myself simply to contem
plating some of the personal ex
periences I have had on this cam
pus.
That I am able to say that I
feel quite at home on this campus
is to me the best

sign of success
of the AS S U
Foreign Scholar
ship Program.
The main contri
bution towards
the success of
the program is
undoubtedly the
foreign scholar’s
opportunity to
live with a dif
s ferent living
group every

quarter of the academic year.
NATURALLY, THIS frequent
move from one living group to
another involves several incon
veniences: personal friendships
that have been established are
jeopardized, baggage has to be
moved and a fair amount of hu
man inertia that opposes any
drastic change has to be over
come.

But the positive aspects by far
outweigh) these negative ones:
the foreign scholar, as the guest
of various living groups, gains a
valuable insight into an Ameri
can university campus.
As I have observed the appar
ent interest in foreign students
and in problems of their home
countries, I was surprised to note
the disinterest of Stanford stu
dents in formulating and exercis
ing their own student policies.
THEIR INTEREST in political
affairs is merely passive and they
seem to avoid active participa
tion. Since those critics that speak
of the “apathy” among American
students oversimplify the prob
lem, I would like to treat it in
greater detail.
The contemporary situation in
the world best illustrates the
problem involved. In Asian, Afri
can and Latin American nations
students represent the elite, and
being aware of this fact, have a
strong influence on national poli
cies. Striking examples of this
generalization can be found in
Korea and Turkey where revolu
tions started by students led to
the inauguration of now govern
ments. Even European students,
looked upon as the leadership
group of tomorrow, exercise some
influence on national policies.
IT IS NO EXCEPTION for
these students to miss classes
when discussing important po
litical issues. Through local and
natoinal student government rep

resentatives they are able to
make their voices heard in the
policy making institutions of the
nation.

Life on this campus partly re
sembles life in a monastery. The
Stanford student devotes his en
tire energies to his academic
schedule with occasional respites
and seems to indicate that every
thing is at rest in the world. For
eigners ask; “Are students gen
erally content with the situation
we are in the world today, or are
they merely disinterested?”
The disinterest or contented
ness often reaches into the sphere
of local student self-government.
1 have been puzzled by discus
sions that expressed concern
about centralized coercive powers
that could he exercised by LASSU
after adoption of a new constitu
tion.
AFTKK HAVING attended sev
eral LASSU meetings, I fail to
perceive any power that goes be
yond making arrangements for
street dances, carnivals, or vari
ous fund drives; greater issues
are seldom presented for discus
sion.
The next months will show
whether students are willing to
assume responsibility and in that
event exercise more power
through their self-government.
Recent events in Eui’ope indi
cate that students become increas
ingly disinterested in their self
government as well as in national
policies with increasing wealth.
