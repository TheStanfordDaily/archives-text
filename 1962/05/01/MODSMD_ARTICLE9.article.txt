# Candidates Discuss Campus Politics
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
Believing firmly that in a democracy voters have the right to
know what they are in for, The Daily presents herewith an inter
view with Jim Andruss and Annin Rosencranz, candidates for
student body president.
Many students apparently are worried that the election of

Rosencranz, a law student and pcH
litical science teaching assistant,
will mean the end of serious stu
dent government. Rosencranz
wishes to make clear that if he is
elected, serious government will
not be replaced by humorous
government.
“IT IS MY firm impression that
too many campus politicos take
themselves much too seriously,”
Rosencranz says. “They seem to
go into office with harebrained
schemes and go out leaving be
hind them an unfulfilled commit
tee which, of courfse, never gets
abolished.”
Such pomposity and self-im
portance must be cut down, Ro
sencranz states. “It takes a pom
pous person to deal with pompous
people. That is why I should be
elected,” he says.
“This is what I mean,” Rosen
cranz continues, “when I promise
to replace traditional bureau
cracy with enlightened despot
ism.”

ANDRUSS agrees there is too
much bureaucracy in student gov
ernment. He believes that organi
zations should be given more au
tonomy pointing out that in
many instances, Legislature does
not know enough about certain
organizations to consider their
constitutions or activities.
In a similar vein, Rosencranz
says he wants to decentralize tra
ditional bureaucracy so that in
dividual organizations can func
tion without being “strangleheld”
by Legislature. He believes many
problems can be solved by ad hoc
committees.

Turning to specific issues, An
druss and Rosencranz seem to be
in basic agreement. Andruss is in
favor of the “new liquor policy,”
believing you can not enforce un
enforceable regulations. The cur
rent liquor regulations, Andruss
says, represent the prejudices of
Mrs. Leland Stanford. Andruss
did not sign the liquor petition
because “it implies that there
would not be any off-campus par
ties.”
ROSENCRANZ also favors the
“new liquor policy.” Liquor in
men’s dorms and fraternities is
an excellent idea, he says. One of
his election slogans, Rosencranz
reminds us, is “Armin is charmin’
but liquor is quicker.”
Both candidates favor coedu
cational dormitories. Andruss
wants the remodeling of Stern
Hall to continue as planned, and
would push for a co-educational
Robert Moore Hall, He also thinks
the “very successful” Wilbur co
ed dinners could serve as a model
for co-ed housing.
Rosencranz says co-ed housing
is the cornerstone of “hetero-so
cial communication which I, of
course, endorse.” Moreover, he
states, Stern Hall would be an
excellent place for a co-education
al housing experiment.
HE BELIEVES further that
serious attention should be given
to the possibility of off-campus
housing for upperclass women
whose parents approve, “It would
be a boon not only for the women
themselves, but for grad students
and upperclass men as well,” he
says.
As to Legislature’s relationship
with the administration, both
agree that an “open campus” is
necessary. Andruss says adminis
tration encroachments make
LASSU powerless. Rosencranz
says student viewpoint should be
effectively represented on the
Public Exercises Committee, and
hopes that this campus welcomes
all kinds of political viewpoints,
“from anti-vivisection on down.”
