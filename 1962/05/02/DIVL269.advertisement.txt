No! But scientists and engineers
at Ford's research and scientific
labs do deal in perpetual notions
—and they nave more than a few
about what might be common
place in the future, some of them
just as startling.
Studies at Ford involving new
energy sources and improved
materials may help bring jet
propelled cars with gyro stabili
zers ... automatic driving controls
... flying automobiles and wheel
less vehicles that glide on a
cushion of air . . , vehicles pro
pelled by atomic energy... plastics
with the strength of conventional
metals .., adhesives that replace
welding ... radar and other elec
tronic controls to assist or replace
the driver in many situations.
Basic studies in these and other
fields are just part of a continuing
program of progress aimed at
reinforcing Ford’s leadership
through scientific research and
engineering.
