# Legal Minds Study Liquor Controversy
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
Sonic* complicated legal aspects of the “new liquor policy”
probably were cleared up late yesterday when;
• A representative of the legal division of the Alcoholic Bever
age Control Commission told The Daily that state penal code
section 172(a) applies a one and one-half mile limit to the sale

of "intoxicating liquors,” but on
campus does not apply to pos
session or consumption, nor to
beer and wine.
• Richard Wasserstrom. as
sistant professor of law and phi
losophy, investigated at The
Daily's request the liquor ques
tion at Stanford and concluded
that there is no state statute
which prohibits the sale of beer
to adults on the Stanford campus.
Further, he could find no state
statute which prohibits the pos
session or consumption by adults
of alcoholic beverages on campus.
THE ABC representative's
statement and Wasserstrom’s con
clusions run counter to the opin
ion of the President’s Office,
which reminded students in yes
terday’s Daily that “preliminary
discussions . . . indicate that the
possession and consumption of al
coholic beverages within Univer
sity residences would be in viola
tion of provisions of the Penal
Code and the Alcoholic Beverages
Control Act ...”

Wasserstrom prefaced his pre
pared statement to The Daily by
saying his conclusions are the re
sult of a very cursory investiga
tion and are, therefore, of a high
ly tentative nature. He also said
his conclusions are his own and
not necessarily those of the Uni
versity, ifs legal staff, or the
Law School.

REGARDING the sale or gift
of alcoholic beverages to minors,
Wasserstrom concludes from Sec
tion 25658(a) of the Business and
Professions Code that “at a mini
mum. it is a misdemeanor for
anyone to sell or give alcoholic
beverages of any kind to a minor.
Regarding the purchase or con
sumption of alcoholic beverages
by minors, it is a misdemeanor
for any person under 21 to: (1)
purchase any alcoholic beverage
(Section 25658(b), B&PO; (2)
consume any alcoholic beverage
in any on-salo premise (same sec
tion); (3) have any alcoholic
beverage in his possession on any
street or highway (Section 25662,
B&PC); (4) have any alcoholic
beverage in his possession in any
public place (same section).
"While it is illegal for any mi
nor to purchase alcoholic bever
ages,” Wasserstrom summarizes,
“it is not, apparently, illegal for
a minor to consume or possess al
coholic beverages in any non-pub
lic place.

“I DO NOT know whether Stan
ford University is a public place
within the meaning of Section
25662 of the Business and Profes
sions Code, but 1 see no reason
to believe that it would be treated
as public,” Wasserstrom says.
If Stanford is not a public
place, Wasserstrom continues,
“then the possession or consump
tion of alcoholic beverages by mi
nors would not be illegal, al
though, of course, it is illegal for
anyone to sell or give alcohol.”
In addition, Wasserstrom con
cluded from Section 172(a) of the
Penal Code, as did the ABC repre
sentative, that any person who
sells, gives away, or exposes for
sale any intoxicating liquor with
in one and one-half miles of Stan
ford is guilty of a misdemeanor.
THE EXCEPTIONS to this
general prohibition are that ale,
ports, wine and similar fermented
malt which does not contain more
than one-half of one per cent of
alcohol by volume nor more than
3.2 per cent of alcohol by weight
can be sold within the one and
one-half mile limit. The sale or
gift of beer is also an exception
to the general prohibition.
“It appears to me,” Wasser
strom concludes, “that beer could
he sold or given to adults today
on the Stanford campus without
violating ony of the laws of the
State.” He said this also applies to
ale, ports, etc., of the prescribed
weight and volume.
It also seems “that alcoholic
beverages of all kinds could, if
purchased beyond the one and
one-half mile limit, be possessed
and consumed by adults on the
Stanford campus without violat
ing any of the laws of the State
of California provided, of course,
that none of the laws concerning
conduct related to the excessive
use of alcohol was violated."
