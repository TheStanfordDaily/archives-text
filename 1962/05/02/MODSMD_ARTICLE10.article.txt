“There has been little chance for
discussion, because he was un
able to speak at Branner Monday
night or on the radio yesterday.
(KZSU asked us both to speak.)
“Therefore we have only the
two campaigns to compare. I
have made a serious effort to
analyze the problems of student
( government and to present my
platform to every group on cam
pus. I hope this has convinced stu
dents of my interest in represent
ing them to the administration, to
, the alumni, and to other universi

“Good examples of student in
itiative are the coed housing plans

student government could inspire
and coordinate.”
Miss Gartzman announced that
