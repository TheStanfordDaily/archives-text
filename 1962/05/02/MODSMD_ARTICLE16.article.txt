ELECTION
Editor, The Daily:
During the campaign before the
primary election, the six of us
w'ho were running for the ASSU
presidency (excluding Annin Ro
sencranz) came to respect the
views of the other candidates and
we also realized that each of us
had a sincere desire to improve
student government, to raise it
from its present impotent posi
tion. None of us had harebrained
schemes; instead most of our pro
posals were the result of experi
ence, ability, and thought. Is the
new liquor policy harebrained?
Is coed housing? Is the new con
stitution? We do not think so.
The only harebrained scheme
of this campaign is the sugges
tion that we elect a pompous per
son to deal with pompous people.

RESPECT FOR LAW
Editor, The Daily:
I hope that the attitude, “Don’t
obey a law if you can get around
it,” as expressed in Monday’s
editorial is not representative of
the views of the Stanford student
body as a whole. The Editor ad
mits that the state law will be
broken by minors but assures all
prospective violators that they
can maneuver the state authori
ties with no problem. Since the
state law exists, it must be re
spected until changed. A univer
sity in which it is the common
practice to coyly employ legal
isms to get around the law could
hardly be considered an outstand
ing representative of American
education.

Open Letter to Mr. Armin Ro
sencranz:

In talking among ourselves and
with other students we have come
to wonder what your primary mo
tive for seeking the ASSU presi
dency is.
We have heard that you are ;
using this election to obtain data
for your doctoral thesis on po
litical behavior, particularly with
regard to techniques of mass
manipulation.
Mr. Rosencranz, are we your
guinea pigs?

we also realized that each of us
had a sincere desire to improve
student government, to raise it
from its present impotent posi
tion. None of us had harebrained
schemes; instead most of our pro
posals were the result of experi
ence, ability, and thought. Is the
new liquor policy harebrained?
Is coed housing? Is the new con
stitution? We do not think so.
The only harebrained scheme
of this campaign is the sugges
tion that we elect a pompous per
son to deal with pompous people.

RESPECT FOR LAW
Editor, The Daily:
I hope that the attitude, “Don’t
obey a law if you can get around
it,” as expressed in Monday’s
editorial is not representative of
the views of the Stanford student
body as a whole. The Editor ad
mits that the state law will be
broken by minors but assures all
prospective violators that they
can maneuver the state authori
ties with no problem. Since the
state law exists, it must be re
spected until changed. A univer
sity in which it is the common
practice to coyly employ legal
isms to get around the law could
hardly be considered an outstand
ing representative of American
education.

Open Letter to Mr. Armin Ro
sencranz:

In talking among ourselves and
with other students we have come
to wonder what your primary mo
tive for seeking the ASSU presi
dency is.
We have heard that you are ;
using this election to obtain data
for your doctoral thesis on po
litical behavior, particularly with
regard to techniques of mass
manipulation.
Mr. Rosencranz, are we your
guinea pigs?

ELECTION
Editor, The Daily:
