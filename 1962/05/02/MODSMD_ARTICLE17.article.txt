## The 						Brazilians' 'Pro-Yankee' Sentiment 
### RICHARD G. OFFUTT 
Many articles have appeared
dealing with Communist infiltra
tion and Castro-ism in South
America, but I would like to try
a different approach to categorize
public opinion toward North
America as I found it in Brazil.

Ignoring Fidel Castro for the
moment, what elements consti
tute “pro-Americanism” or “anti-
Americanism” as the case may
be, and what actions could con
tribute to the strengthening of
“pro-Yankee” sentiments?
IN A HISTORICAL context I
often heard, “We fought on the
American side twice in world
conflicts.” Brazil declared war on
Germany in both world wars.
They do not consider this as hav
ing followed the U.S. into the war,
but as having helped as equals in
the fight for freedom. Moreover
this alliance is thought of more
specifically with the U.S. than
with the allied powers.
I mentioned this “equality” in
a previous article and it is ex
tremely important in understand
ing Brazilian thought. There is
no inferiority complex in Brazil,
as in some other South American
nations. The inhabitants harbor
no ill will and set themselves on
an equal basis with one and all.
Even when Brazil sometimes
sets herself at odds with Portu
gal, this is not resentment toward
a former colonial master, but
rather an attempt to assert her
self as an equal in the Portu
guese-speaking cultural complex.
IN THE frontier areas many
American technicians work for
Brazinian companies such as Pe
trobas and are doing a wonderful
job clearing up the Hollywood
impression given by the Ameri
can films. Incidentally, I have
found this false picture of Ameri
can life depicted in the products
of our film industry a most de
plorable representation in Africa
and Asia as well.
These technicians are forced to
learn Portuguese in order to
work with their Brazilian crews,
and the resulting communication
is much more vital than a trans
lated speech. Their work is a
pleasant contrast to those Ameri
cans smiling in their natty ivy
league suits from the embassy
windows in Rio.

Among the State Department
workers I found either a reluc

tance or fear to mix with the
common people. I did not seek
contact with them, but none of
those w'hom I met could speak
Portuguese beyond the limits of
ordering a cup of coffee. This is
especially detrimental in Brazil,
because the people love their soft
and suave mixture of Portuguese
and African elements and are
proud to be the only Portuguese
speaking land in South America.
I MET ONE diplomatic official
in a snack-bar in Rio and in the
course of our conversation I told
him that I intended to go to Mato
Grosso. “You had better be care
ful, there are Indians out there!”
he replied and grinned in a hay
seed manner. Upon asking if he
had ever been in that area, I
learned that he himself had never
been out of the former capital,
but a friend of his had once flown
to Corumba for a few days.
The basis of contact between
the diplomatic corps and the
Brazilieros seems to be vested in
the statue of friendship in front
of the embassy, but it likewise
speaks no Portuguese.

This situation reduces the Alli
ance for Progress to another in a
series of economic development
schemes, which fail to convince
the people concerned that we seek
understanding or have an interest
other than capitalistic in their
future.

ONE VERY successful project
in recent years has been a milk
campaign for the children in the
more isolated areas. I encounter
ed thanks on numerous occasions
for this form of aid, but was re
peatedly confronted with the de
sire to “meet an American.” “We
appreciate the help, but we can
not get to know you from labels
alone.”

Kennedy is highly respected in
all social circles as are the meth
ods of administration employed
in North America. As a school
teacher in Goiania stated, “If vve
only had Yankee administration
we could do anything.”
Another interesting form of re
spect for the U.S. has resulted
from the many American jeeps
used on the rural roads. “Four
wheel drive” is a common usage
for “good,” and when something
works well, it has “four-wheel
drive.” This is now a part of the
symbol for the American way in
Brazil.

OUK SEGREGATION problem
is naturally a hot issue, since no

social ladder based on racial dif
ferences exists here. The people
have a good understanding for
the historical complexes out of
which our difficulties arise, but
desire more information about
the progress in solving them.
Even those who read English can
not afford to buy Time and more
informative pamphlets could be
of great value in this field.
America has many plus points
in Brazil. At present the cry for
socialism is stronger than that
for communism and Castro-ism.
Even though a strong center for
the latter exists in the northeast,
it has not yet taken the form of a
definite “anti-Americanism.”

Brazilian history has been
characterized by patience and
tolerance and not by bloody revo
lutions as in most of South Amer
ica, but the Brazilians are still
waiting to see the financial side
of the helping hand from their
brother in the north to divert
from the diplomatic level and sub
merge with equal interest and
understanding into the masses,
the sugar cane cutters and coffee
pickers.
