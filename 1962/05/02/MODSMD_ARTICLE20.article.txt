# OUR MAN ON THE FARM

### Glenn Alford 
Bettor lato than never is the motto of the Stanford baseball
team. The Indian nine had won only six of 14 games following a
double loss to the Santa Clara Broncos on April 7th. Since then they
have won nine of 10 games, and are making a late challenge to the
leaders of the CIBA
THE CARDS REGAINED their footing with two massacres,
beating St. Mary’s 18-4 the following Monday, and Claremont Men’s

College 19-2 the next day.
At the time. Fehring said the
wins came at the right psycho
logical moment, since the Card’s
hadn’t been hitting at all.
Stanford then proceeded to lose
the first game of a two-game
series to UCLA, but the shutout
pitching of Darrell Sutherland
got Stanford their first CIBA win
after six losses.
APPARENTLY, this was what
Stanford needed, since they went
to town, putting six more tri
umphs together to add to the
UCLA win for a seven-game win
streak.
They beat the Air Force Acad
emy 11-10 and 4-0, and suddenly
were getting consistent hitting
and low-run pitching. When the
ball was hit to the infield, you
could be reasonably sure it would
be turned into an out.

STANFORD STARTED last week by healing San Francisco
State 64, getting all runs in a big first inning and holding on long
enough to win.
Then came the biggest weekend in Stanford baseball this year,
and perhaps Dutch Fehring’s finest moment, the three-game sweep
from the Southern California teams.
Fehring Made Two Moves
Fehring made two moves to give impetus to the Stanford drive.
UK MOVED O. J. SOEANDER from left field to second base,
and put Warren Newell in the outfield spot. Rob Hollman took over
first base. ,
If the hitting holds up, and why shouldn’t it after battering one
of the better pitching staffs in college baseball for 20 runs and 19
hits in a double-header, Fehring’s only trouble spot is a shallow
pitching staff.
The mound core has only four pitchers, Darrell Sutherland, Jim
Lonborg, Joe Schultz and John LeCompte.
MARK MILKER, JACK WOOD, Pete Dixon and Jim Smith all
either quit baseball for the year or have various ailments.
The strain on the pitching staff was so great after a three-game
weekend, that Fehring planned on using outfielder-infielder Skip
Lawrence and outfielder Newell along with Schultz to face the no
pushover San Francisco State Gators yesterday. The results of that
experiment can be found elsewhere on the sports page.
Fehring was gratified with the turnout for the USC double
header Saturday. At least 1000 fans watched the games.
FRIDAY, VERY FEW were on hand for a game that set base
ball back 20 years, as the game was played in weather alternating
between drizzle and driving rain, but never dry.
The Stanford Coach feels that one thing missing from the Stan
ford baseball program is a pep band, to provide between inning en
tertainment. A week and a half ago, the Cinder Stompers, Stanford’s
track band, came over to Sunken Diamond after a track meet and
serenaded the spectators.
THIS WENT ONER well, and Fehring thinks it might give the
Indians a little spark for their Saturday clash with Cal if there was
musical entertainment.
The way Stanford is going now, this might; be like giving spinach
to Popeye.
