# Chappie Devotes Issue To Beer! Beer! Beer!
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
As if the New Liquor Policy
(NLP) needed further impetus to
approbation than Stanford roughs
will give it. the new issue of the
Stanford Chaparral (on sale to
day: 40 cents) proclaims (and
this is no news to you Right
Thinkers) that “Beer Belongs—
Enjoy It.”
The cover of the April number
returns to the Chappie’s most fa
miliar territory—the Deans’ of
fices.
THE ENTIRE issue is devoted
to beer and even this ol’ reprobate
thinks this a little extreme. In
their never ceasing search for old
jokes, the little men found one
of (hose brewer's association ads
(discontinued two seasons ago,
as I recall) which started the
Beer Belongs phrase.
Anyhoo, as you open the mag
there’s Susan Laughlin in a fash
ion anachronism that went out
with blue suede shoes, a one-piece
bathing suit. Susan’s just a tad
hippy, but nice, and the Chappie
can’t be blamed for a faux pas of
its advertisers, can it?

Closely following are the Old
Boy’s usual coy remarks which
reverse the Chappie’s tradition of
scathing the administration’s ab
surdities and go soft on the cam
paign for the NLP.

“THE STORY OF Beer: an Epic
of Man and Booze” by A1 Dod
worth has a good title and amaz
ing old movie cuts, but contrived,
midnight-oil captions. “39 Things
to Do with a Beer Can” is really
funny, and almost enough to
make one swear off pitchers and
quarts in order to add a Beer Can
Handicraft badge to his collec
tion.

Judy Skinner adds laughs to
the mag with a rehash of the old
IDmanship-frosh dolly routine,
but with some telling, clever
touches. In “a visit to fratville”
Mark Draper writes a neo-Faulk
nerian satire (and criticism) of
the rushing system.
The Queen is Robles’ Karin
Blom. The Old Boy has enticed
one of the campi’s few bomb
shells to appear, but why she’s
not pixed in the bikini I bugged
her in at the boathouse recently
I’ll never know.

“Dr. Pye of the Stanford Health
Service,” a comic, is a hearty fi
nale. The doc’s improbable name
soon becomes obvious in this be
lated expose (didn’t The Daily
settle all that last year?).

ON THE WHOLE, the April
Chaparral is funny, and certainly
not dirty. Next time they ought
to take up an even more burning
Farm deficiency: e.g., “Sex Be
longs—Enjoy It.”

“Dr. Pye of the Stanford Health
Service,” a comic, is a hearty fi
nale. The doc’s improbable name
soon becomes obvious in this be
lated expose (didn’t The Daily
settle all that last year?).

ON THE WHOLE, the April
Chaparral is funny, and certainly
not dirty. Next time they ought
to take up an even more burning
Farm deficiency: e.g., “Sex Be
longs—Enjoy It.”
As if the New Liquor Policy
(NLP) needed further impetus to
approbation than Stanford roughs
will give it. the new issue of the
Stanford Chaparral (on sale to
day: 40 cents) proclaims (and
this is no news to you Right
Thinkers) that “Beer Belongs—
Enjoy It.”
The cover of the April number
returns to the Chappie’s most fa
miliar territory—the Deans’ of
fices.
THE ENTIRE issue is devoted
to beer and even this ol’ reprobate
thinks this a little extreme. In
their never ceasing search for old
jokes, the little men found one
of (hose brewer's association ads
(discontinued two seasons ago,
as I recall) which started the
Beer Belongs phrase.
Anyhoo, as you open the mag
there’s Susan Laughlin in a fash
ion anachronism that went out
with blue suede shoes, a one-piece
bathing suit. Susan’s just a tad
hippy, but nice, and the Chappie
can’t be blamed for a faux pas of
its advertisers, can it?

Closely following are the Old
Boy’s usual coy remarks which
reverse the Chappie’s tradition of
scathing the administration’s ab
surdities and go soft on the cam
paign for the NLP.

“THE STORY OF Beer: an Epic
of Man and Booze” by A1 Dod
worth has a good title and amaz
ing old movie cuts, but contrived,
midnight-oil captions. “39 Things
to Do with a Beer Can” is really
funny, and almost enough to
make one swear off pitchers and
quarts in order to add a Beer Can
Handicraft badge to his collec
tion.

Judy Skinner adds laughs to
the mag with a rehash of the old
IDmanship-frosh dolly routine,
but with some telling, clever
touches. In “a visit to fratville”
Mark Draper writes a neo-Faulk
nerian satire (and criticism) of
the rushing system.
The Queen is Robles’ Karin
Blom. The Old Boy has enticed
one of the campi’s few bomb
shells to appear, but why she’s
not pixed in the bikini I bugged
her in at the boathouse recently
I’ll never know.
