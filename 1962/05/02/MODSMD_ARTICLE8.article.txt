# Smith Begins Architecture Lecture Series
## 
### SANDRA SIMS 
With slides and explanations,
Dr. Myron B. Smith, one of the
few American experts on Islam
architecture, took his audience
through the Alcazar in Seville,
Spain, and through the famed Al
hambra in Granada, Spain, last
night.
After a short history of the
Moorish occupation of Spain and
a few slides showing some of the
best features of the Alcazar,
Smith began to tell and show
slides of the Alhambra—the pal
ace with which he “fell in love.”

THE ALHAMBRA, as most
other Moorish edifices of this
sort, was first a fortress, and then
a royal residence, Smith said.

The Alhambra is divided into
four parts, he said. The fortress
and the dar, in which business,
complaints, and justice were
taken care of. are the only two
into which the commoner’s could
enter. Next comes the pool court
of myrtles and a hall for the re
ception of foreign dignitaries. The
last part of the Alhambra is the
Court of Lions, consisting of pri
vate apartments in which the
harem lived.
FANTASTIC effects were
achieved by using the most com
mon materials, he continued. The
Moors continually defied smooth
surfaces with elaborate carvings,
structure with impossible con
structions, and gravity with sta
lactite formations, he said.
The architecture lecture series
continues tomorrow with “Isfa
han as a Safavid Capital.” This
will be followed by “Mughal Ar
chitecture of India and Pakistan:
The Taj Mahal and Gardens of
Shalimor” Thursday and “Islamic
Vaults and Baroque Cupolas” Fri
day.
All three lectures will be at 8
p.m. in Schultz Auditorium, which
{s located directly behind the
Stanford Museum.
