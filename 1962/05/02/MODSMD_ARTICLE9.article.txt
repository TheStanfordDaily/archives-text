# KRINO "So Strange and So Auspicious"
## Prof Praises Intellectual Magazine 
### BROOKS OTIS Professor of Classics 
I write to celebrate a rare and wonder
ful event: the appearance of a serious
magazine on the Stanford campus. With
all respect to Sequoia and The Daily, it
must be stated that there *s a void that
remains unfilled. It is called Krino.
When one considers all the term papers
of the undergraduates, all the Ph.D. dis
sertations, all the specialized publications
of the faculty and then reflects that there
is as yet no real organ of the thinking
Stanford community (and there are those
at Stanford who think: they have even
told me sot, then one can scarcely restrain
his desire to “clap hands and sing” or
otherwise show his recognition of some
thing so new, so strange and so auspici
ous. To Mr. Ray Prier and to Messrs. Jon
Ketchum, Peter Schroeder, C. R. Gallistel
and Christopher Macie be all honor: they
are bold and to such, we are informed,
the aid of fortune comes.
Till-; CONTENT of the first issue in
dicates a real concern with fundamental
things at Stanford and in modern man. So
far excellent. Prier in his editorial wants
to stimulate “personal awareness,” —re-
open “the problem of self-knowledge,”—
how man can avoid the status of a more
object in a vapid relativism.
Ketcham, that bold authority on Stan
ford, writes of how it can become a uni
versity (a real social thing with an idea).
Schroeder contributes an amusing and

rather elegant poem. Gallistel’s politics
(he writes on the “Philosophy of the
Power Struggle’’) I found interesting but
rather alarming: is he urging us to use
naked power as an antidote to moral con
fusion? Macie I find genuinely concerned
with the reality of freedom but perhaps
too charmed by the existentialist version
thereof.
The writing is, as a whole (and except
ing the amusing poem of Schroeder)
rather obscure; I cannot believe that even
existentialism need be quite so involved,
quite that difficult. But I only say this
because I want Prier, Ketchum, Made etc.
to be heard, for their brand of thought to
have influence in (his “historic silence.”
—to use a fine phrase of Willian James
(see the last Sequoia). After all they have
ideas that ought to stir people up. To be
clear is often to be heard.
I HOPE indeed they will be heard. If
there is any one thing that Stanford
needs it is intellectual excitement. They
are excited. Let them laern to sting like
Socialic gadflies and apply the simple but
embarrassing questions (hat get under
the skin of complicated ignorance.
What I sense in at least the words of
Prior, Ketchum and Macie is a desire for
real knowledge and a real human com
munity of intellects. Their complaint ap
plies to all big modern universities as
well as to Stanford.
I wish however they would turn their
light on Stanford in particular. Stanford,
we are sometimes told, aspires to be a

Harvard, an Oxford or .something like
that. Its very great merit is that it is
nothing of the sort. It has its faults (yes,
indeed) but it is the most open-ended,
perhaps, of present-day universities and
has grown too fast for fossilization to
catch up as yet. What it needs is a new
principle of intellectual and social unity,
—not imported curricula, house-plans,
common rooms et al. Not, in other words,
the apparatus before the reality. Not even
existentialism unless modified and trans
lated for Stanford use.
CAN’T Krino supply this? I ask with
groat seriousness. I oven sec in this Krino
some signs of hope.
I hope they won’t take these words
merely as a condescending pat on the
back. The professor is for better or for
worse trapped in his specialty (even the
philosophers now specialize in the nice
ties of language) and the graduate stu
dent imitates them (we all know why)
and the undergraduate very often re
sembles an unfed sheep (for ho has needs
that his major does not supply and which
even sometimes exceed the capacities of
his senior colloquia).
This is therefore the moment (if there
ever was one) for the academic free lance.
In time perhaps he will rise to be a pro
fessor in the New Stanford! Meanwhile
let us begin. And the big thing, now and
here, is thal Messrs. Prior, Ketchum, Ma
cie etc. have begun.
Krino is on sale at Engineering Corner
for 30 cents.

are bold and to such, we are informed,
the aid of fortune comes.
Till-; CONTENT of the first issue in
dicates a real concern with fundamental
things at Stanford and in modern man. So
far excellent. Prier in his editorial wants
to stimulate “personal awareness,” —re-
open “the problem of self-knowledge,”—
how man can avoid the status of a more
object in a vapid relativism.
Ketcham, that bold authority on Stan
ford, writes of how it can become a uni
versity (a real social thing with an idea).
Schroeder contributes an amusing and

rather elegant poem. Gallistel’s politics
(he writes on the “Philosophy of the
Power Struggle’’) I found interesting but
rather alarming: is he urging us to use
naked power as an antidote to moral con
fusion? Macie I find genuinely concerned
with the reality of freedom but perhaps
too charmed by the existentialist version
thereof.
The writing is, as a whole (and except
ing the amusing poem of Schroeder)
rather obscure; I cannot believe that even
existentialism need be quite so involved,
quite that difficult. But I only say this
because I want Prier, Ketchum, Made etc.
to be heard, for their brand of thought to
have influence in (his “historic silence.”
—to use a fine phrase of Willian James
(see the last Sequoia). After all they have
ideas that ought to stir people up. To be
clear is often to be heard.
I HOPE indeed they will be heard. If
there is any one thing that Stanford
needs it is intellectual excitement. They
are excited. Let them laern to sting like
Socialic gadflies and apply the simple but
embarrassing questions (hat get under
the skin of complicated ignorance.
What I sense in at least the words of
Prior, Ketchum and Macie is a desire for
real knowledge and a real human com
munity of intellects. Their complaint ap
plies to all big modern universities as
well as to Stanford.
I wish however they would turn their
light on Stanford in particular. Stanford,
we are sometimes told, aspires to be a

Harvard, an Oxford or .something like
that. Its very great merit is that it is
nothing of the sort. It has its faults (yes,
indeed) but it is the most open-ended,
perhaps, of present-day universities and
has grown too fast for fossilization to
catch up as yet. What it needs is a new
principle of intellectual and social unity,
—not imported curricula, house-plans,
common rooms et al. Not, in other words,
the apparatus before the reality. Not even
existentialism unless modified and trans
lated for Stanford use.
CAN’T Krino supply this? I ask with
groat seriousness. I oven sec in this Krino
some signs of hope.
I hope they won’t take these words
merely as a condescending pat on the
back. The professor is for better or for
worse trapped in his specialty (even the
philosophers now specialize in the nice
ties of language) and the graduate stu
dent imitates them (we all know why)
and the undergraduate very often re
sembles an unfed sheep (for ho has needs
that his major does not supply and which
even sometimes exceed the capacities of
his senior colloquia).
This is therefore the moment (if there
ever was one) for the academic free lance.
In time perhaps he will rise to be a pro
fessor in the New Stanford! Meanwhile
let us begin. And the big thing, now and
here, is thal Messrs. Prior, Ketchum, Ma
cie etc. have begun.
Krino is on sale at Engineering Corner
for 30 cents.
I write to celebrate a rare and wonder
ful event: the appearance of a serious
magazine on the Stanford campus. With
all respect to Sequoia and The Daily, it
must be stated that there *s a void that
remains unfilled. It is called Krino.
When one considers all the term papers
of the undergraduates, all the Ph.D. dis
sertations, all the specialized publications
of the faculty and then reflects that there
is as yet no real organ of the thinking

too charmed by the existentialist version
thereof.
The writing is, as a whole (and except
ing the amusing poem of Schroeder)
rather obscure; I cannot believe that even
existentialism need be quite so involved,
quite that difficult. But I only say this
because I want Prier, Ketchum, Made etc.
to be heard, for their brand of thought to
have influence in (his “historic silence.”
—to use a fine phrase of Willian James
(see the last Sequoia). After all they have
ideas that ought to stir people up. To be
clear is often to be heard.
I HOPE indeed they will be heard. If
there is any one thing that Stanford
needs it is intellectual excitement. They
are excited. Let them laern to sting like
Socialic gadflies and apply the simple but
embarrassing questions (hat get under
the skin of complicated ignorance.
What I sense in at least the words of
Prior, Ketchum and Macie is a desire for
real knowledge and a real human com
munity of intellects. Their complaint ap
plies to all big modern universities as
well as to Stanford.
I wish however they would turn their
light on Stanford in particular. Stanford,
we are sometimes told, aspires to be a

Harvard, an Oxford or .something like
that. Its very great merit is that it is
nothing of the sort. It has its faults (yes,
indeed) but it is the most open-ended,
perhaps, of present-day universities and
has grown too fast for fossilization to
catch up as yet. What it needs is a new
principle of intellectual and social unity,
—not imported curricula, house-plans,
common rooms et al. Not, in other words,
the apparatus before the reality. Not even
existentialism unless modified and trans
lated for Stanford use.
CAN’T Krino supply this? I ask with
groat seriousness. I oven sec in this Krino
some signs of hope.
I hope they won’t take these words
merely as a condescending pat on the
back. The professor is for better or for
worse trapped in his specialty (even the
philosophers now specialize in the nice
ties of language) and the graduate stu
dent imitates them (we all know why)
and the undergraduate very often re
sembles an unfed sheep (for ho has needs
that his major does not supply and which
even sometimes exceed the capacities of
his senior colloquia).
This is therefore the moment (if there
ever was one) for the academic free lance.
In time perhaps he will rise to be a pro
fessor in the New Stanford! Meanwhile
let us begin. And the big thing, now and
here, is thal Messrs. Prior, Ketchum, Ma
cie etc. have begun.
Krino is on sale at Engineering Corner
for 30 cents.
I write to celebrate a rare and wonder
ful event: the appearance of a serious
magazine on the Stanford campus. With
all respect to Sequoia and The Daily, it
must be stated that there *s a void that
remains unfilled. It is called Krino.
When one considers all the term papers
of the undergraduates, all the Ph.D. dis
sertations, all the specialized publications
of the faculty and then reflects that there
is as yet no real organ of the thinking
Stanford community (and there are those
at Stanford who think: they have even
told me sot, then one can scarcely restrain
his desire to “clap hands and sing” or
otherwise show his recognition of some
thing so new, so strange and so auspici
ous. To Mr. Ray Prier and to Messrs. Jon
Ketchum, Peter Schroeder, C. R. Gallistel
and Christopher Macie be all honor: they
are bold and to such, we are informed,
the aid of fortune comes.
Till-; CONTENT of the first issue in
dicates a real concern with fundamental
things at Stanford and in modern man. So
far excellent. Prier in his editorial wants
to stimulate “personal awareness,” —re-
open “the problem of self-knowledge,”—
how man can avoid the status of a more
object in a vapid relativism.
Ketcham, that bold authority on Stan
ford, writes of how it can become a uni
versity (a real social thing with an idea).
Schroeder contributes an amusing and

rather elegant poem. Gallistel’s politics
(he writes on the “Philosophy of the
Power Struggle’’) I found interesting but
rather alarming: is he urging us to use
naked power as an antidote to moral con
fusion? Macie I find genuinely concerned
with the reality of freedom but perhaps
too charmed by the existentialist version
thereof.
