# AEC wards SU Project M Contract; To Start this Month
## 
### 
The Atomic Energy Commission Monday awarded a contract
to Stanford for design, engineering, construction and related
research and development of the $ll4 million Project M linear
accelerator center.
Ellison C. Shute, manager of the AEC’s San Francisco Opcra-

tions said that construe--
lion will start this month and is
expected to bo completed in 1967.
SPONSORED and financed by
the AEG. the accelerator center
will ho a national research facili
ty to be used by scientists from
other institutions as well as Stan
ford. It will bo located on a 485-
acre site two miles west of Quad
near Sand Hill Road. When com
pleted, the center will be manned
by about 750 scientists, techni
cians and supporting staff.
Stanford first proposed Project
M to the AEG in 1957. The Joint
Congressional Committee con
ducted hearings regarding it in
1959 and 1960. $3 million worth of
preliminary design and develop
ment work was authorized in
1960.

The full project was authorized
by Congress last year following
additional hearings.

UNDER THE CONTRACT be
tween the Commission and Stan
ford, the University will perform
the necessary research and de
velopment on the design of the
accelerator system, its various
components and associated con
ventional facilities; and will also
manage the architectural design,
engineering and construction of
the accelerator and facilities mak
ing up the complete research
complex.
Research and development ef
forts at this time are concerned
primarily with design of the main
components. The accelerating
structure will be of precision fab
ricated copper pipe 10,000 feet
long, which will be powered by
240 klystron tubes, spaced at 40-
foot intervals.
