# Sept. I Opening Set For Taiwan Center
## 
### KATHLEEN DOWNING 
The Taiwan Study Center. Stan
ford's fifth overseas campus, will
open Sept. 1 with a small group
of graduates and undergraduates
studying Mandarin Chinese.
The Center is located at the
state university in Taiwan’s capi
tal, Taipei. The students will
study under Taipei language in
structors and will use the univer
sity’s library and research facili
ties.
DR. ALBERT DIEN, now at the
University of Hawaii, will serve
as resident director for the 1962-
63 academic year. Prof. James
Liu of the Stanford History De
partment will administer the Cen
ter with a faculty committee. Da
vid Nivison, associate professor
of Chinese and philosophy, will
activate the Center this summer.
Students may apply for the
year’s study with Prof. Lui.
Preliminary meetings have been
held with applicants to acquaint
them with living conditions in
Taiwan. Students will be given
transportation to the Chinese
center, but students and their
families must provide their own
housing.
DIANE FOSTER, who will
spend the year in Taiwan with
her husband, reported that living
conditions might seem primitive
to students “but the Chinese man
age fine, we’re told.” The princi
ple problem facing students is
the 80-90 per cent humidity on the
island.
“In our briefing sessions,” she
said, “we were told that we need
ed to bring along an electric oven
to dry out the de-humidifying
crystals which must be used to
dry out our closets so that our
clothes won’t mildew.” Another
article the students will need is
an electric blanket to help dry
out the bedding during the day.
Five-room homes may be rent
ed near the campus for $5O to $BO
a month. “But we shall need the
help of people on campus to bar
gain with Chinese landlords.” said
Miss Foster. A maid is also ne
cessary to bargain for and buy
the food. Food for three will cost
only $1.50 a day, she said.
MISS FOSTER hopes to learn
Chinese from the maid and the
students at the university who
are eager to learn English. Her
fiance speaks both the Cantonese
and Mandarin dialects.
The change will be drastic for
Miss Foster. “We’re going to
work on a ‘dry farm’ in Idaho
this summer; then we shall move
info that wet climate.”
Ten to 15 students and then
families are now planning to at
tend. Further applications will be
accepted until May 15.

out the bedding during the day.
Five-room homes may be rent
ed near the campus for $5O to $BO
a month. “But we shall need the
help of people on campus to bar
gain with Chinese landlords.” said
Miss Foster. A maid is also ne
cessary to bargain for and buy
the food. Food for three will cost
only $1.50 a day, she said.
MISS FOSTER hopes to learn
Chinese from the maid and the
students at the university who
are eager to learn English. Her
fiance speaks both the Cantonese
and Mandarin dialects.
The change will be drastic for
Miss Foster. “We’re going to
work on a ‘dry farm’ in Idaho
this summer; then we shall move
info that wet climate.”
Ten to 15 students and then
families are now planning to at
tend. Further applications will be
accepted until May 15.
The Taiwan Study Center. Stan
ford's fifth overseas campus, will
open Sept. 1 with a small group
of graduates and undergraduates
studying Mandarin Chinese.
The Center is located at the
state university in Taiwan’s capi
tal, Taipei. The students will
study under Taipei language in
structors and will use the univer
sity’s library and research facili
ties.
DR. ALBERT DIEN, now at the
University of Hawaii, will serve
as resident director for the 1962-
63 academic year. Prof. James
Liu of the Stanford History De
partment will administer the Cen
ter with a faculty committee. Da
vid Nivison, associate professor
of Chinese and philosophy, will
activate the Center this summer.
Students may apply for the
year’s study with Prof. Lui.
Preliminary meetings have been
held with applicants to acquaint
them with living conditions in
Taiwan. Students will be given
transportation to the Chinese
center, but students and their
families must provide their own
housing.
DIANE FOSTER, who will
spend the year in Taiwan with
her husband, reported that living
conditions might seem primitive
to students “but the Chinese man
age fine, we’re told.” The princi
ple problem facing students is
the 80-90 per cent humidity on the
island.
“In our briefing sessions,” she
said, “we were told that we need
ed to bring along an electric oven
to dry out the de-humidifying
crystals which must be used to
dry out our closets so that our
clothes won’t mildew.” Another
article the students will need is
an electric blanket to help dry
out the bedding during the day.
