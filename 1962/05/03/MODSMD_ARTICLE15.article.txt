One of the disturbing after
effects of Richard Nixon’s Presi
dential-election defeat has been to
discourage moderation in foreign
affairs and to reawaken and en
courage isolationism on the right
wing.
Of course the mood is decep
tive and neither Senator Barry
Goldwater of Arizona, for exam
ple, nor Representative John
Rousselot of California is actually
admitting himself to be isolation
ist yet. But the tenor of the new
call reminds one unmistakably of
the 1920’s and 1930’s and its mea
sures would, if enacted, gradually
leave us as devoid of allies as we
were in 3939.
As examples of the isolationist
mood, new threats today issue
forth to withdraw from the Unit
ed Nations, or to sever diplomatic
contact with the socialist and
communist nations. Today, pos
sible Isolation is even more signi
ficant than it was in 1939 since
there will be no buffer period of
a year and a half to build alli
ances before the next war reaches
U.S. shores. But be that as it may,
there is an increasingly vocal
movement in the United States
encouraging diplomatic disen
gagement wherever the diploma
tic battle is joined.
It is typically argued by these
post-1960 isolationists that tech
nical assistance ought to be with
drawn from India and other coun
tries with socialist governments
because these socialists will even
tually stumble through instability
or statism into communism. The
assistance of the United States, it
is said, will have been responsible
for building more communist
satellites.
The fact that India is probably
more stable governmentally at
this point than even some of our
traditional allies including notably
Franco, and that her commitment
to civil liberties is profoundly
greater than that of. for instance
Spain, or Turkey, or Portugal—
where we have unhesitatingly
made alliance—is a fact the pro
ponents of the withdrawal doc
trine ignore.
Still, rather than buttress India
against communism we are urged
to encourage instability by with
drawing our technology and our
influence. It may tie observed in
passing that three years ago Iraq
appeared to be heavily involved
with the communists and on the
verge of a communist takeover.
Had we broken off diplomatic and
economic contact there then, as

we are encouraged to do in other
places now, probably the commu
nists would indeed have gone into
full control. But we did not re
treat in the face of the commu
nist threat, and notably, Iraq is
still independent today.
It is characteristic of the post
-1960 isolationist approach to ad
vocate reduction or elimination of
diplomatic, cultural, and econom
ic contacts with countries like
British Guiana, and Ghana, and
Guinea, which are suspected—
probably rightly- of being sym
pathetic towards communism.
But just as true in India, it is
true in these countries that the
tangible presence of freedom
minded, critical Americans, first
ly, and the cultivation, secondly,
of technological and financial de
pendence upon the U.S., are by
their very nature factors subver
sive of Moscow’s influence. It
would make sense to increase
rather than decrease these fac
tors. Withdrawal or disengage
ment. contrarily, gives the unfor
tunate appearance of being a re
treat.
By one view, Ghana, Guinea,
and India are outposts of commu
nism with which we deal at our
peril. But by another view, and
one perhaps more consonant with
traditional American self-assur
ance, these countries are at worst
only weak links in the enemy’s al
liance and as such present the
logical starting place fora United
Slates offensive.
The community of spirit which
Ghana’s Nkrumah, Guinea’s
Toure, and India’s Nehru are said
to enjoy with the Soviet Union in
fact grows less out of ideological
identity with totalitarianism and
Marxism than out of stringent in
ternal economic and social needs
which Moscow gratuitously
promises to help remedy.
These fellow-travelers do not in
general share communism’s athe
ism, international messianism, or
proletariat identification. In fact
they are in general the opposite,
being religious, vehemently na
tionalist, and agrarian, and they
are for that reason the weakest
chinks in the outer wall of the
Marxist camp.
Furthermore, recognition by
the U.S. of the reality and enor
mity of the economic and social
problems of these nations and
willingness on our part to assist
in the resolution of these prob
lems will carry the challenge of
the capitalist-democratic system
right to where we meet the com
munists head-on: on the farms, in
the shops, and in the factories. It
will carry the American experi
ment forward into the trenches,
as it were, rather than backwards
in hasty retreat ever nearer our
own shores.
