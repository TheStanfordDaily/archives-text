REVIEW
Editor, The Daily:
The “Mediascope" xeview of
“Les Liaisons Dangei’euses” could
have been written for an Associa
tion to Prevent Our Dear Little
Kiddies from Finding Out about
the World. It was exactly that
childish and superficial.

It seems that whenever Ameri
cans are exposed to sex intelli
gently and tastefully used in a
movie, the majority react in two
ways. One is to shout “Horrors!”
and blast the film as “the most
painfully amoral ever made.” The
other is to sit and drool because
they would love to be doing what
is being done in the film, but they
don’t dare. However, there is a
third alternative: a combination
of these reactions. This is what
the Daily reviewer managed to
do.

The thinking minority, which
Stanford is supposed to represent,
would react in a fourth way. They
would offer intelligent criticism
of such a film, whether it was
“amoral” or not. If “Los Liaisons
Dangereuses” were an “amoral”
film, they would show why. They

would do the same if it were
merely poorly executed. But “Les
Liaisons Dangereuses’’ is any
thing but “amoral” or poorly ex
ecuted. This has been pointed out
again and again by intelligent
critics around the world.

This film is an intense psycho
logical study of amorality, especi
ally that brand developed by
those bored with too much lei
sure. It is a drama of the basic
conflict between good and evil.
It is an exposition of the contrast
between lust and love. It is all of
these and more. Yet if you are
immature enough, it can be the
sexiest, “most painfully amoral
film ever made.”
Michael W. Slater

(Editor’s Note: The nature of
“Mediascope” calls for brevity,
thus there is a possibility that
the reviewer’s meaning may be
misunderstood. Such has hap
pened here. Our reviewer assures
us that he thinks highly of M.
Vadim’s film and that he would
be the last to call it “poorly exe
euted.” He insists, however, that
it is painfully amoral which is not
to say that it’s no good.)
