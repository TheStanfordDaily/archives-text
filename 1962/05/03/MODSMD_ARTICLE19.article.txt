ARM IN REPLIES
Editor, Tli** Dully:
To Diana. Susan, Lois, Susan ]
and Janet;
I appreciate tlie interesting sug
gestion in your letter to yester- i
day’s Daily. Unfortunately much [
competent research has already j
been done in this area and I feel
that any effort of mine vvoidd add
little to the field. See for example
the classic study of Adorno, et al. J
“The Authoritarian Personality”;
Freud, “Group Psychology and
the Analysis of the Ego”; and the
excellent work which appeared
six or seven years ago in the |
American Sociological Review on
“Male Sex Aggression on the
American Campus” (It increases]
in the spring).
My sympathies are really closer I
to the twelfth book of the Mahab-1
harata which emphasizes punish
ment as the basis of social order

and government. The message is
somewhat diluted in translation
and I hope you will take the
trouble to refer to the original
Sanskrit text.

MORE ON LIQUOR
Editor, The Daily:
The issue at stake in the liquor
referendum is not regulations
concerning the consumption of
alcoholic beverages by people
over 21, but whether the campus
wants all students to he able to
drink on campus without coming
under judicial council jurisdic
tion. The astute reader does not
need me to tell him this; it is em
phatically stated in the first part
of The Daily’s very contradictory
editorial.
The creation of a “responsible
and mature student body” is not
helped by making a sham of the
law by circumventing it, and that
is essentially what the passage of
the referendum would do. The

spirit of the California law clear
ly forbids the consumption of in*
toxicating beverages by minors;
this law cannot be implemented
on the Stanford campus by state
authorities for the reasons ably
stated in The Daily editorial,
therefore the referendum can be
regarded as a “loophole” action.
Part of the responsibility every
student at Stanford should gain
during his years here is responsi
bility towards society and its
regulations: each should take
upon himself the breaking of so
ciety’s laws and his behavior
after breaking the laws—if he
chooses to break them. I would
recommend that a new proposal
be drawn up, giving the right to
drink on campus to those stu
dents over 21 and eliminating the
proviso in the current bill which
in effect transfers the responsi
bility for obeying the liquor regu
lations from the individual stu
dent to the university.
