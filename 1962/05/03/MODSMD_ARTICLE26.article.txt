# Frosh Spikers Ready for Cal
## 
### 
Stanford’s frosh tracksters will |
! bo deflnito underdogs Saturday 1
j against tho classy Cal yearlings,
but on I ho basis of tho Papoose
' iioar-victory against San .(nso last
i vvook, they may pull an upset.
The dope shoot shows a 77-54
| Cal edge, but inspired perform
ances in the “Little Big Moot’’l
| make it hard to predict. Tho Card j
1 frosh are very strong in some
events, but extremely weak in j
others, and tho points they give [
away will be hard to make up j
against the “best-evor’’ Boat |
Cubs.
THE MOST EXCITING con-j
tests should come in the hurdles I
;ind shot put. The shot matches |
I Jack Chappie, with the Stanford !
frosh record of 54-5, Don Castle, j
[ ex-Cubberley high schooler who J
holds the Cal frosh best of 52-5, 1
■ and Canadian Lome Peterson of \
1 the Papooses, with 51-7 Q.
Phil Arnaudo heads tho Card 1
[ hurdlers with a host time of 15.0
| over the high sticks. But Cal’s
Howard Holt figures to bo right j
j behind at 15.1. In tho lows, Ar I
I naudo, Holt and Stanford flash
Larry Questad all have identical
clockings of 24,4.
Questad will bo tripling in the

I 1(H), 220, and lows, with the last i
1 two events run back to back. But
i according to Coach Jim Terrill,
“Questad is capable of doing 9.5
and under 21 seconds, if neces
sary to win.”
.MOST Or THE remaining Stan
ford power is concentrated in the
mile and two-mile. Harlan An
drews has the alltime Papoose
bests of 4:14.5 and 9:20.4 in both
I events. Paul Schlicke is right be
hind at 4:16.2 in the mile and an
identical 9:20.4 in the 8-lapper.
Schlicke will probably be tripling
in the half-mile, where he has run
1:54.8, in an effort to pick up!
points.
Dave Stineback, at 9:27.8, com- j
pletes the Papoose 1-2-3 punch in I
the two-mile, but Cal record j
holder Art Heinemann will be out j
to prevent a sweep.
The discus, pole vault, high !
jump, and broad jump should be |
all Cal. Don Schmidt has whirled j
the platter past 163 feet, Dennis j
Peacocke has gone 14-1 % in the
vault and 22-8% in the broad!
jump, and Bill Carter is a 6-6
high jumper.
run JAVELIN should be closer,
with Bill Gilstrap of the Papooses {
at 184-1 matched against Pea-1

I cocke’s 189-1 best. Perhaps the;
closest flat race will be the half j
mile, with Cal’s Dave Fishback'
given a slight edge over Schlicke, j
who will be covering a lot of
j ground.
But if (he Papooses plan to win,
they’ll have to do it before the
relay, for Cal is loaded with quar
termilers. Last week they came
within a second of the national
frosh record with a 3:12.2 clock
ing. The splits were A1 Courches
ne 48.7, Doug Brown 48.5, Fish-1
back 48,6, and Dave Archibald
finishing up with a sensational
! 46.4.
