# Old Theory a Drag? Try Pataphysics
## 
### 
You may reach the ulti
mate in obtuse term paper
topics if you hustle down to
the Main Library and pick up
“Pataphysieat Meditations”
by one Dargoman C. Basqui.
Discovered this week by
the usually vigilant Stanford
libe staff, the two thin vol
umes of this work are ap
parently a sly intellectual
hoax planted by a student li
brary staffer who needed
legitimate footnotes for a
theory of his own creation.
Even the card catalogues had
been planted.
As an editor’s note ex
plains: “Pataphysics is the
science ot imaginary solu
tions, which symbolically at
tributes the properties of ob
jects, described by their vir
tuality, to their lineaments."
