# Math Bldg Gets Renovation Aid
## 
### 
A grant of $250,000 from the
National Science Foundation has
been received by the University
for use in remodeling Physics
Corner into a new home for the
Mathematics Department.
The $2.3 million renovation of
the building will start after the
Physics Department moves into
its new headquarters in the Rus
sell H. Varian Laboratory of
Physics, tentatively scheduled to
open Sept. 1.
The Mathematics Department
has outgrown its present quar
ters in the Inner Quad and now
occupies space in several Univer
sity buildings. Enrollment of
mathematics majors has increas
ed more than 80 per cent since
1958.
Centralizing the Department in
its renovated quarters will pro
vide space to bring together fac
ulty, graduate students, under
graduate classes and library all
under one roof,
