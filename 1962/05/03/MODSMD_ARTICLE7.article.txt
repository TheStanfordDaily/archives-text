## OAS ombs, U.S. A-Tests, Titov Visits 
### 
ALGIERS (UPI) A booby
trapped automobile exploded on
the Algiers waterfront yesterday
with a burst of shrapnel, killing
or maiming scores of Moslem
longshoremen and their children
in the worst single act of Euro
pean terrorism since the March
18 Algerian cease-fire.
Officials said 8 Moslems were
killed and about 100 wounded as
the dynamite-packed sedan ex
ploded across the street from a
building where 1,000 dockers
milled inside and another 500
crowded on the sidewalk for work
assignments.

WASHINGTON (UPII - The
United States yesterday exploded
the third and biggest nuclear de
vice of its Pacific test series—a
“low megaton yield” weapon that
could have been the warhead for
the most modern of U.S. missiles.
The Atomic Energy Commis
sion (AEC) said the device had
an explosive force of one to sev
eral megatons, probably equal to
the power of one million to five
million tons of TNT. The previous
two shots were believed to be in
the 100,000-ton range.
Like the two previous shots,
yesterday’s device was dropped
from a plane near Christmas
Island.
All of the tests to date appear
to have involved attempts to pack
more punch into intercontinental
missile warheads. The higher
power of the latest device indi
cated that it might have been an
actual warhead. They could range
up to 10 megatons.
