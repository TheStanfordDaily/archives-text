# Ugandan Tells Africa's Attitudes Toward U.S.

“Africans associate Americans
with their foreign policy,” stated
Pafula Kiwanuka, ASSU scholar
from Uganda, in a discussion with
Asst. Dean of Men A1 Lowen
stein before a small but enthusi
astic audience in Cubberley Au
ditorium last night.
Kiwanuka went on to give other
attitudes which Africans have
toward the United States and
Americans. “Africans see strong
nations trying to prove that
might is right, and this makes
their talk about freedom seem a
fraud,” he said.
“IT MAY NOT sound very im
portant, but if you are an Afri
can and you come to America,
which espouses freedom for the
Africans and discrimination for
the southern negro, you cannot
help but feel that the U.S. is help
ing the Africans because it is in
its own interests, and not primar
ily those of the Africans.”
"Perhaps we should send an
African Peace Corps to the U. 5.,”
he said, in view of warped Amer
ican views of the Africans.
LOWENSTEIN followed along
the same lines as Kiwanuka in
criticizing American attitudes
toward Africa. He brought out
two factors which he felt con
tributed most toward the lack of
accurate attitudes.
The first is racial snobbery.
“The image of the U.S. is the im
age created by our treatment of
the non-white people, not our
treatment of whiles.” The Amer
ican double standard, not only in
the South, but in our foreign af
fairs, make Africans believe that
there is something that distin
guishes justice for white people
from justice for black people.
The second is American pre
occupation with the struggle with
communism. By placing our rela
tions with Africa behind the
prism of the cold war the U.S.
blurs the image which her hu
manity might otherwise show.
