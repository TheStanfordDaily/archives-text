# Indians, Bears in Traditional Meet
## 
### CHUCK RISC HOFF 
Tomorrow afternoon's 67th re
newal of the Stanford-Cal “Big
Meet,” “The Greatest Show on
Earth,” in the opinion of this
writer, should fulfill the fondest
dreams of every Stanford track
enthusiast.

CERTAINLY THE biggest of
the meet’s stars is Card Captain
Dave Weill. Just the sight of this
highly coordinated athlete effort
lessly tossing the discus close to
190 feet is enough to make the
afternoon worthwhile. Weill, the
favorite in the NCAA champion
ships, will be shooting for the col
legiate record of 190’91&”.

Interested fans will note the
red flag planted at the school
record of 189’6Vi;”, the blue mark
er at the stadium record of 192-
3Vs, and the gold at the world
mark: 199-8. Don Bell, almost for
gotten at 169 feet, is the second
best man in the country.
Cal has exactly two premier
performers, Gene Johnson and
Dave Maggard, and a handful of
other good ones, but the Stan
fords are favored in 13 of the 15
events.

THE FIRST VARSITY field
event starts at 1:30. though the
frosh weight-men will take the
field at 12:30, With 7-foot high
jumper Johnson, backed up by
Roger Olson, who clears 6-6, the
Bears should atke an early lead,

though John Haynie and John
Fontius are consistent at 6-4,

Maggard’s 58-foot heaves of the
shot will probably prove too much
for Stanford's Steve Arch, though
he has improved to 56 feet. But
after that the Bears wall be seeing
red, mostly from behind.
The mile starts the running
events at 2 p.m., and Robine Ru
ble (4:08.7), Harry McCalla (4;-
07.6), and Bill Pratt (4:11.3) are
slated to go. McCalla’s specialty
is the two-mile, and though he’s
not officially entered there, (he
entry list is always subject to re
vision.

RUBLE, ACCORDING to Jor
dan, is ready for a 4:06 mile, and
if he doesn’t go that fast, the
Coach says, Pratt may beat him.
George Linn, the red headed ex-
Paly star, and John Hatton have
both been under 4:15 this year,
and the Cal men might surprise.

Ken Emanuels, who has been
around 47.5 the last two weeks, is
much smoother than anything
Cal can offer in the 440. Their
only hope is Bill Barbee, and
since he also runs the 100 and 220,
he can’t do everything. Rich Che
sarek and Bob Taylor back up
Emanuels, and may provide a
sweep.

The hurdles, both low and high,
will be contested by Stanford’s
Steve Cortright and Bill Sprague
of the Bears, with Cortright rated
a slight edge on comparative
times. Bill Wandrey of the Cards
and Cal’s Rich Harding will
battle for third.
STEADY PHIL Lamoreaux
looks like another double winner
in the 100 and 220, with bests of
9.8 and 21.5. Barbee is the best
for the Blue and Gold, at 10.1 and
22.6 around a turn.
Half-miler Rich Klier, who has
run it in 1:50.5 this year, may be
pressed by Cal’s Marty Ziebarth,
1:51.2. Pratt also will make (his
a close one, showing a best of
1:32.5.
If McCalla goes in the two-mile,
the school record should go by the
boards. The sophomore transfer
has already run six seconds fast
er than Maury Graves’ 9:04.9, but
his 8:58.3 didn’t count officially
because it was a non-winning
lime.
NOT TO BE overlooked, how
ever, is John Northway, who won
the event last year, and last week
ran a best-of-life 9:14.4.
In the relay, the top Indian
foursome of Lamoreaux, Chesar
ek, Klier, and Emanuels has been
practicing baton passes all week,
and has set a personal goal of
the meet mark of 3:11.9 by Cal’s
great 1960 team which included
Olympians Jerry Siebert and Jack
Yerman.
In the remaining field events,
the Cards are heavy favorites.
Phil White needs only to clear
his opening height of 14 feet to
lake the pole vault. Art Batchel
der is 23 feet ahead of Cal’s Jerry
Nordstrom, though both Nord
strom and Roger Olsen are con
sistently around 210 feet or more.
IN THE BROAD jump, if Chuck
Barth is able to jump on his bad
knee and Dan Moore can over
come his injured tendon, either
one could go 24 feet or more. If
not, Nigerian Larry Chukwudebe
will take up the slack. All three
are a foot better than the best
Bear.

will take up the slack. All three
are a foot better than the best
Bear.
Tomorrow afternoon's 67th re
newal of the Stanford-Cal “Big
Meet,” “The Greatest Show on
Earth,” in the opinion of this
writer, should fulfill the fondest
dreams of every Stanford track
enthusiast.

CERTAINLY THE biggest of
the meet’s stars is Card Captain
Dave Weill. Just the sight of this
highly coordinated athlete effort
lessly tossing the discus close to
190 feet is enough to make the
afternoon worthwhile. Weill, the
favorite in the NCAA champion
ships, will be shooting for the col
legiate record of 190’91&”.

Interested fans will note the
red flag planted at the school
record of 189’6Vi;”, the blue mark
er at the stadium record of 192-
3Vs, and the gold at the world
mark: 199-8. Don Bell, almost for
gotten at 169 feet, is the second
best man in the country.
Cal has exactly two premier
performers, Gene Johnson and
Dave Maggard, and a handful of
other good ones, but the Stan
fords are favored in 13 of the 15
events.

THE FIRST VARSITY field
event starts at 1:30. though the
frosh weight-men will take the
field at 12:30, With 7-foot high
jumper Johnson, backed up by
Roger Olson, who clears 6-6, the
Bears should atke an early lead,

though John Haynie and John
Fontius are consistent at 6-4,

Maggard’s 58-foot heaves of the
shot will probably prove too much
for Stanford's Steve Arch, though
he has improved to 56 feet. But
after that the Bears wall be seeing
red, mostly from behind.
The mile starts the running
events at 2 p.m., and Robine Ru
ble (4:08.7), Harry McCalla (4;-
07.6), and Bill Pratt (4:11.3) are
slated to go. McCalla’s specialty
is the two-mile, and though he’s
not officially entered there, (he
entry list is always subject to re
vision.

RUBLE, ACCORDING to Jor
dan, is ready for a 4:06 mile, and
if he doesn’t go that fast, the
Coach says, Pratt may beat him.
George Linn, the red headed ex-
Paly star, and John Hatton have
both been under 4:15 this year,
and the Cal men might surprise.

Ken Emanuels, who has been
around 47.5 the last two weeks, is
much smoother than anything
Cal can offer in the 440. Their
only hope is Bill Barbee, and
since he also runs the 100 and 220,
he can’t do everything. Rich Che
sarek and Bob Taylor back up
Emanuels, and may provide a
sweep.

The hurdles, both low and high,
will be contested by Stanford’s
Steve Cortright and Bill Sprague
of the Bears, with Cortright rated
a slight edge on comparative
times. Bill Wandrey of the Cards
and Cal’s Rich Harding will
battle for third.
STEADY PHIL Lamoreaux
looks like another double winner
in the 100 and 220, with bests of
9.8 and 21.5. Barbee is the best
for the Blue and Gold, at 10.1 and
22.6 around a turn.
Half-miler Rich Klier, who has
run it in 1:50.5 this year, may be
pressed by Cal’s Marty Ziebarth,
1:51.2. Pratt also will make (his
a close one, showing a best of
1:32.5.
If McCalla goes in the two-mile,
the school record should go by the
boards. The sophomore transfer
has already run six seconds fast
er than Maury Graves’ 9:04.9, but
his 8:58.3 didn’t count officially
because it was a non-winning
lime.
NOT TO BE overlooked, how
ever, is John Northway, who won
the event last year, and last week
ran a best-of-life 9:14.4.
In the relay, the top Indian
foursome of Lamoreaux, Chesar
ek, Klier, and Emanuels has been
practicing baton passes all week,
and has set a personal goal of
the meet mark of 3:11.9 by Cal’s
great 1960 team which included
Olympians Jerry Siebert and Jack
Yerman.
In the remaining field events,
the Cards are heavy favorites.
Phil White needs only to clear
his opening height of 14 feet to
lake the pole vault. Art Batchel
der is 23 feet ahead of Cal’s Jerry
Nordstrom, though both Nord
strom and Roger Olsen are con
sistently around 210 feet or more.
IN THE BROAD jump, if Chuck
Barth is able to jump on his bad
knee and Dan Moore can over
come his injured tendon, either
one could go 24 feet or more. If
not, Nigerian Larry Chukwudebe
will take up the slack. All three
are a foot better than the best
Bear.

one could go 24 feet or more. If
not, Nigerian Larry Chukwudebe
will take up the slack. All three
are a foot better than the best
Bear.
Tomorrow afternoon's 67th re
newal of the Stanford-Cal “Big
Meet,” “The Greatest Show on
Earth,” in the opinion of this
writer, should fulfill the fondest
dreams of every Stanford track
enthusiast.

CERTAINLY THE biggest of
the meet’s stars is Card Captain
Dave Weill. Just the sight of this
highly coordinated athlete effort
lessly tossing the discus close to
190 feet is enough to make the
afternoon worthwhile. Weill, the
favorite in the NCAA champion
ships, will be shooting for the col
legiate record of 190’91&”.

Interested fans will note the
red flag planted at the school
record of 189’6Vi;”, the blue mark
er at the stadium record of 192-
3Vs, and the gold at the world
mark: 199-8. Don Bell, almost for
gotten at 169 feet, is the second
best man in the country.
Cal has exactly two premier
performers, Gene Johnson and
Dave Maggard, and a handful of
other good ones, but the Stan
fords are favored in 13 of the 15
events.

THE FIRST VARSITY field
event starts at 1:30. though the
frosh weight-men will take the
field at 12:30, With 7-foot high
jumper Johnson, backed up by
Roger Olson, who clears 6-6, the
Bears should atke an early lead,

though John Haynie and John
Fontius are consistent at 6-4,

Maggard’s 58-foot heaves of the
shot will probably prove too much
for Stanford's Steve Arch, though
he has improved to 56 feet. But
after that the Bears wall be seeing
red, mostly from behind.
The mile starts the running
events at 2 p.m., and Robine Ru
ble (4:08.7), Harry McCalla (4;-
07.6), and Bill Pratt (4:11.3) are
slated to go. McCalla’s specialty
is the two-mile, and though he’s
not officially entered there, (he
entry list is always subject to re
vision.

RUBLE, ACCORDING to Jor
dan, is ready for a 4:06 mile, and
if he doesn’t go that fast, the
Coach says, Pratt may beat him.
George Linn, the red headed ex-
Paly star, and John Hatton have
both been under 4:15 this year,
and the Cal men might surprise.

Ken Emanuels, who has been
around 47.5 the last two weeks, is
much smoother than anything
Cal can offer in the 440. Their
only hope is Bill Barbee, and
since he also runs the 100 and 220,
he can’t do everything. Rich Che
sarek and Bob Taylor back up
Emanuels, and may provide a
sweep.

The hurdles, both low and high,
will be contested by Stanford’s
Steve Cortright and Bill Sprague
of the Bears, with Cortright rated
a slight edge on comparative
times. Bill Wandrey of the Cards
and Cal’s Rich Harding will
battle for third.
STEADY PHIL Lamoreaux
looks like another double winner
in the 100 and 220, with bests of
9.8 and 21.5. Barbee is the best
for the Blue and Gold, at 10.1 and
22.6 around a turn.
Half-miler Rich Klier, who has
run it in 1:50.5 this year, may be
pressed by Cal’s Marty Ziebarth,
1:51.2. Pratt also will make (his
a close one, showing a best of
1:32.5.
If McCalla goes in the two-mile,
the school record should go by the
boards. The sophomore transfer
has already run six seconds fast
er than Maury Graves’ 9:04.9, but
his 8:58.3 didn’t count officially
because it was a non-winning
lime.
NOT TO BE overlooked, how
ever, is John Northway, who won
the event last year, and last week
ran a best-of-life 9:14.4.
In the relay, the top Indian
foursome of Lamoreaux, Chesar
ek, Klier, and Emanuels has been
practicing baton passes all week,
and has set a personal goal of
the meet mark of 3:11.9 by Cal’s
great 1960 team which included
Olympians Jerry Siebert and Jack
Yerman.
In the remaining field events,
the Cards are heavy favorites.
Phil White needs only to clear
his opening height of 14 feet to
lake the pole vault. Art Batchel
der is 23 feet ahead of Cal’s Jerry
Nordstrom, though both Nord
strom and Roger Olsen are con
sistently around 210 feet or more.
IN THE BROAD jump, if Chuck
Barth is able to jump on his bad
knee and Dan Moore can over
come his injured tendon, either
one could go 24 feet or more. If
not, Nigerian Larry Chukwudebe
will take up the slack. All three
are a foot better than the best
Bear.
