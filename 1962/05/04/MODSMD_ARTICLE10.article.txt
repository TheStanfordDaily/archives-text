Ex-general Edwin Walker spoke |
recently to a large audience in |
the Los Angeles area. He propos-j
ed the withdrawal of the United
States from the United Nations j
and the proposal brought the [
crowd lo its feet in a standing!
ovation.
The isolationists’ indignant dis
approval of this assistance
through the* United Nations and
through technical aid (o “commu
nist sympathizers” is unfortunate
because it assumes (he conclusion.
It assumes that in any country
where the communists have a
foot in tlk* door, the final result
must always be our defeat and
communist victory, even though
we may succeed in eliminating
the sole economic and social
causes which engender commu
nist sympathies. Such a pessimis
tic appraisal should not he allow
ed lo become a foundation prin
ciple of our foreign policy.
ISOLATIONISM is a slate of
mind. It is characterized by a ten
dency to be defensive and doctrin- j
aire, and lo oversimplify distinc-|
lions between good and evil. And 1
it encourages neglect of signifi- j
cant further opportunities pre
sented to the United Stales to i
take the diplomatic offensive.
For example, by a twist of un
expected events we have been:
thrust into diplomatic proximity |
with Outer Mongolia, which en-1
tered into the United Nations this
last autumn. This stale, a source j
of traditional Moscow - Peking |
friction, is today again the sub-1

! ject of a Slno-Soviet tug-of-war,:
and the United States has been
I presented with an unexpected op
portunity.
Boundaries in this part of Asia
! are a recurrent source of inter
national friction, often being
| roughly and imelearly determin
! ed. The United States might j
therefore take this opportunity to !
| put the diplomatic squeeze on
Outer Mongolia to publicly clari-!
fy her boundaries, or to take
some other stand concerning her
boundaries which, while satisfac- (
lory to the Mongolians, would'
raise the prospect of contention!
between the Soviets and the Chi- \
nese.
THAT ( HINA, at least, is easi
ly drawn into disputes such as
this one is borne out by the fact,
that she has already in recent
years three times been involved
in such contests, once each with
Burma, India and Nepal.
Nor can it be said that Sino- ]
Soviet boundary disputes are un
likely. There is a long history of
such disputes between these
same nations dating back to the
first treaty which modern China
j signed with a western power, at
j Nerchinsk, in 1689. That treaty
i brought temporary halt to only
i the first Sino-Russian border
! clashes.
i Isolationists who despair of con
! tact by the United States with yet
another communist power in the
! United Nations are apparently
j dazzled by the communist label
into overlooking the opportunity
[ which the peculiar facts of this
| case present to us to attack and
| undermine the communist alli
i ance.

AGAIN, AN offensive state of
mind not in general shared by j
isolationists encourages opening
up reciprocal trade negotiations'
with Finland, hoping to engage 1
that country inextricably in the j
prosperous commerce of Western
Europe, and to wean her from ]
her present economic servitude to
| the USSR. The need for such a
policy is greatly heightened by
j the new pressures which Moscow!
| has recently exerted upon the
; Finns.
! In the interest of seizing the
| initiative and the offensive and
i encircling the Soviet Union with
trouble spots, world-wide alien
! lion ought additionally to be call
i ed to sundry facts such as those
' recently exposed by State Depart
ment intelligence reports to the
effect that the Armenian popula
-1 (ion of the Soviet Union remains
restless and discontented with
Russian Bolshevik rule. Even in
-1 ternally, Soviet power is not with
{ out its weak spots.
SIMILARLY, in the same vein,
j a world-wide campaign for the
j return by Russia to Japan of the
southern half of Sakkalin Island,
I taken from the Japanese after
I World War 11, would provide an
issue which would help to keep
Moscow off balance and the U.S.
j on the offensive.
While space limits the sugges
tions which can here he itemized,
; there are of course many more.
In foreign affairs it would ap
i pear to be wiser to avoid the
\ temptation to resort to desperate

incantations concerning the dan
gers of contact with communists
in British Guiana, Ghana, Guinea
and India. Rather our government
should push out to extend the
boundaries of freedom, to meet
communism head-on. Our tools
are our civil presence, our tech
nology, and our unshackled, flexi
ble criticism. These are, coinci
dentally, some of the greatest im
plements of civilization which
have made this nation the first
power on earth.
