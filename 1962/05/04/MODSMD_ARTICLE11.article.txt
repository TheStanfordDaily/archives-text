SUFFERING
Editor, The Daily:
When Jerry Rankin was re
placed by editors Sklar and Rapo
port, I feared that The Daily
would suffer for the change. Al
low me to illustrate how you have
met my expectations.
Admittedly, I have never ex
pected more from The Daily than
local news coverage and pertinent
editorials, but it seems that even
these small concessions on your
part are long overdue. In the re
cent student body elections, the
coverage (i.e. campaign speeches,
pictures, and editorials) was at
best scanty. At worst, it was ob
jectionably biased. Out of seven
presidential candidates, how was
it possible that the last (alpha
betically) could get the top-center
space of the feature page in an
alphabetical listing? Could the
fact that one of your assistant
editors is a fraternity brother of
said candidate have any rele
vance?
Immature journalistic tenden
cies are continually evident with
in The Daily pages. When local
whiz Scott Thompson received
national recognition (at least
some of which he deserved), your
cynicism was quick. It was also
childish, repetitious, and worst of
all, boring. A good joke need not
be run into the ground; you how
ever buried both the joke and my
interest.
You have avoided criticism
from the student body by clever
ly offering nothing to criticize:
your editorial page is usually
filled by letters to the editor or
factual reports prepared by mem
bers outside of your staff. It
seems that the only way you can
avoid the poor writing that per
vades your staff's reporting is to
avoid any writing at all.
Your recent innovation, the
“Mediascope,” is representative
of the recent trend. It is presum
ably “cute,” but before you emu
late Time magazine's method of
witty criticism, you should evalu
ate your own capabilities.
In your defense, I must admit
that the classified ads are excel
lent, and your half-page spreads
by Marlboro and Pacific Stores
are a never-ending source of
amusement. So too are the let-

I tens to the editor replete with in- j
I formation. Also, they are good |
fill-ins. I hope mine can contribute i
in this way. for, as the Chappie j
has repeatedly pointed out. a ;
thicker paper makes for better |
garbage-can liner.

’PATAPHYSICS
Editor, The Daily:
Gleeful, indeed, was I when 1
awakened at 7 this morning by j
the cry, “Dr. Basqui. ‘ 'Pataphysi- j
cal Meditations’ is on the first ■
page of The Daily.” My joy, how- 1
ever, soon ended when I discov
ered that “Meditations,” like all j
great works, was the victim of |
public misunderstanding. Allow
me to clarify.
You seem to have the idea that j
'Pataphysics is some strange oc
cult: philosophy, yet this is not I
true. Indeed, 'Pataphysics is the |
oldest of all philosophies and en
compasses all the philosophies
now known to man. It holds the i
same relationship to metaphysics |
as metaphysics does to physics. [
'Pataphysicians have existed since j
long before the birth of Christ;
it’s just that the 'Pataphysicians
of history have been the inar
ticulate men of their time.
Although it is true that I am
known as the 'Pataphysical Poet
Laureate, do not get the impres
sion that I am the only 'Pata
physician today. My good friend

and colleague, Pragnenton R.
Nortz, is also a well-known 'Pata- j
physical writer, and together we
comprise the faculty of the
Brotherhood of Übu ’Pataphysical
Mission (formerly located on
Middlefield Road, but recently
moved to Salvatierra Street). Dr
Nortz and myself are now' col
laborating on an even greater
work, “Collected Poems of Basqui
and Nortz.”
’Pataphysics is not a Joke. We
are not library staffers, and the
book was not w'ritten as an ob
scure reference source. The fact
that our book had to be entered
in the library without the li
brary's knowledge only shows
that the world is still not yet
ready to accept ’Pataphysics.
I hope that this will serve to
clarity our already confused po
sition.

local news coverage and pertinent
editorials, but it seems that even
these small concessions on your
part are long overdue. In the re
cent student body elections, the
coverage (i.e. campaign speeches,
pictures, and editorials) was at
best scanty. At worst, it was ob
jectionably biased. Out of seven
presidential candidates, how was
it possible that the last (alpha
betically) could get the top-center
space of the feature page in an
alphabetical listing? Could the
fact that one of your assistant
editors is a fraternity brother of
said candidate have any rele
vance?
Immature journalistic tenden
cies are continually evident with
in The Daily pages. When local
whiz Scott Thompson received
national recognition (at least
some of which he deserved), your
cynicism was quick. It was also
childish, repetitious, and worst of
all, boring. A good joke need not
be run into the ground; you how
ever buried both the joke and my
interest.
You have avoided criticism
from the student body by clever
ly offering nothing to criticize:
your editorial page is usually
filled by letters to the editor or
factual reports prepared by mem
bers outside of your staff. It
seems that the only way you can
avoid the poor writing that per
vades your staff's reporting is to
avoid any writing at all.
Your recent innovation, the
“Mediascope,” is representative
of the recent trend. It is presum
ably “cute,” but before you emu
late Time magazine's method of
witty criticism, you should evalu
ate your own capabilities.
In your defense, I must admit
that the classified ads are excel
lent, and your half-page spreads
by Marlboro and Pacific Stores
are a never-ending source of
amusement. So too are the let-

I tens to the editor replete with in- j
I formation. Also, they are good |

’PATAPHYSICS
Editor, The Daily:
Gleeful, indeed, was I when 1
awakened at 7 this morning by j
the cry, “Dr. Basqui. ‘ 'Pataphysi- j
cal Meditations’ is on the first ■
page of The Daily.” My joy, how- 1
ever, soon ended when I discov
ered that “Meditations,” like all j
great works, was the victim of |
public misunderstanding. Allow
me to clarify.
You seem to have the idea that j
'Pataphysics is some strange oc
cult: philosophy, yet this is not I
true. Indeed, 'Pataphysics is the |
oldest of all philosophies and en
compasses all the philosophies
now known to man. It holds the i
same relationship to metaphysics |
as metaphysics does to physics. [
'Pataphysicians have existed since j
long before the birth of Christ;
it’s just that the 'Pataphysicians
of history have been the inar
ticulate men of their time.
Although it is true that I am
known as the 'Pataphysical Poet
Laureate, do not get the impres
sion that I am the only 'Pata
physician today. My good friend

and colleague, Pragnenton R.
Nortz, is also a well-known 'Pata- j
physical writer, and together we
comprise the faculty of the
Brotherhood of Übu ’Pataphysical
Mission (formerly located on
Middlefield Road, but recently
moved to Salvatierra Street). Dr
Nortz and myself are now' col
laborating on an even greater
work, “Collected Poems of Basqui
and Nortz.”
’Pataphysics is not a Joke. We
are not library staffers, and the
book was not w'ritten as an ob
scure reference source. The fact
that our book had to be entered
in the library without the li
brary's knowledge only shows
that the world is still not yet
ready to accept ’Pataphysics.
I hope that this will serve to
clarity our already confused po
sition.

jectionably biased. Out of seven
presidential candidates, how was
it possible that the last (alpha
betically) could get the top-center
space of the feature page in an
alphabetical listing? Could the
fact that one of your assistant
editors is a fraternity brother of
said candidate have any rele
vance?
Immature journalistic tenden
cies are continually evident with
in The Daily pages. When local
whiz Scott Thompson received
national recognition (at least
some of which he deserved), your
cynicism was quick. It was also
childish, repetitious, and worst of
all, boring. A good joke need not
be run into the ground; you how
ever buried both the joke and my
interest.
You have avoided criticism
from the student body by clever
ly offering nothing to criticize:
your editorial page is usually
filled by letters to the editor or
factual reports prepared by mem
bers outside of your staff. It
seems that the only way you can
avoid the poor writing that per
vades your staff's reporting is to
avoid any writing at all.
Your recent innovation, the
“Mediascope,” is representative
of the recent trend. It is presum
ably “cute,” but before you emu
late Time magazine's method of
witty criticism, you should evalu
ate your own capabilities.
In your defense, I must admit
that the classified ads are excel
lent, and your half-page spreads
by Marlboro and Pacific Stores
are a never-ending source of
amusement. So too are the let-

I tens to the editor replete with in- j
I formation. Also, they are good |
fill-ins. I hope mine can contribute i
in this way. for, as the Chappie j
has repeatedly pointed out. a ;
thicker paper makes for better |

’PATAPHYSICS
Editor, The Daily:
Gleeful, indeed, was I when 1
awakened at 7 this morning by j
the cry, “Dr. Basqui. ‘ 'Pataphysi- j
cal Meditations’ is on the first ■
page of The Daily.” My joy, how- 1
ever, soon ended when I discov
ered that “Meditations,” like all j
great works, was the victim of |
public misunderstanding. Allow
me to clarify.
You seem to have the idea that j
'Pataphysics is some strange oc
cult: philosophy, yet this is not I
true. Indeed, 'Pataphysics is the |
oldest of all philosophies and en
compasses all the philosophies
now known to man. It holds the i
same relationship to metaphysics |
as metaphysics does to physics. [
'Pataphysicians have existed since j
long before the birth of Christ;
it’s just that the 'Pataphysicians
of history have been the inar
ticulate men of their time.
Although it is true that I am
known as the 'Pataphysical Poet
Laureate, do not get the impres
sion that I am the only 'Pata
physician today. My good friend

and colleague, Pragnenton R.
Nortz, is also a well-known 'Pata- j
physical writer, and together we
comprise the faculty of the
Brotherhood of Übu ’Pataphysical
Mission (formerly located on
Middlefield Road, but recently
moved to Salvatierra Street). Dr
Nortz and myself are now' col
laborating on an even greater
work, “Collected Poems of Basqui
and Nortz.”
’Pataphysics is not a Joke. We
are not library staffers, and the
book was not w'ritten as an ob
scure reference source. The fact
that our book had to be entered
in the library without the li
brary's knowledge only shows
that the world is still not yet
ready to accept ’Pataphysics.
I hope that this will serve to
clarity our already confused po
sition.

SUFFERING
Editor, The Daily:
When Jerry Rankin was re
placed by editors Sklar and Rapo
port, I feared that The Daily
would suffer for the change. Al
low me to illustrate how you have
met my expectations.
Admittedly, I have never ex
pected more from The Daily than
local news coverage and pertinent
editorials, but it seems that even
these small concessions on your
part are long overdue. In the re
cent student body elections, the
coverage (i.e. campaign speeches,
pictures, and editorials) was at
best scanty. At worst, it was ob
jectionably biased. Out of seven
presidential candidates, how was
it possible that the last (alpha
