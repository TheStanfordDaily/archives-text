# Spanish Production Called Standout
## 
### LEO WEINSTEIN Associate Professor of French 
Last weekend the Spanish Dra
matic Theatre of Stanford Uni- i
versity presented an outstanding
performance of Antonio Buero j
Vallejo’s play “En el ardiente os
curidad.”
The play, one of the most
thought-provoking ones to come
out of Spain In recent years, deals
with the age-old problem of suf
fering. here personified by Igna
cio, a blind student, who refuses
lo accept the illusion of happiness
that prevails in the educational
institution for I he blind he has
I entered.
WHAT HAKES this play
i unique is that Buero Vallejo,
Spain’s most gifted contemporary
I playwright, refuses to give in to
j the temptation of satisfying the
spectator with a cheap solution.
To him, paradoxically, the only
j blind man who “sees” is the one
i who knows he is blind and there
fore different from those who
j can see; he is a man condemned
j to inevitable suffering with only
i two ways out: rebellion and death,
I or resignation and acceptance of
1 his fate.
The intellectual conflict be
tween the optimistic Carlos and
| Ignacio is skillfully underlined in
' their struggle over the love of
Carlos’ girl friend, Juana. The
| play maintains constant tension,
I yet Buero Vallejo manages to
| preserve a delicate and fair bal
ance between opposing views,
which are enlivened by the per

sonal motives of I lie two oppo
nents. But it is the “tragic sense
of life” that prevails, for Carlos
will carry in him henceforth the
message of the one whose death
he caused.
THE ENTIRE CAST deserves!
applause for its performance j
which was an ensemble achieve- j
ment. One rarely sees such sensi
tive interplay between native and |
non-native Spanish speakers. Luis
S. Ponce de Leon, as the clown, j
could easily have stolen the spot j
light, yet managed to get his |
laughs without disturbing the j
natural flow of the action. Mi-;
I chael Doudoroff was an ideal Ig
i nacio. Gaunt, ascetic, tense, iron
ic, he pronounced each line with
maximum effect. Dale Envvall
succeeded in conveying movingly
\the change in Carlos from choer
| ful optimism to inner conflict and
i the release of long pent-up emo- i
lions. Penny Deley’s Juana was |
| warm-hearted and tender; Kathy i
Glenn as Elisa portrayed effec-1
; lively the contrast between care-i
■ free illusion at first and (he grad
ual invasion of doubt and suffer- .
! ing. In the remaining roles Angel 1
j M. Aguirre, Joanne Lusch. James
D. Cockcroft, Robert S. Mitchell. I
| Joel Horwitz, Rodney Wilson,
j Ruth Holtz and Gay Galbraith all
i performed well.
One cannot praise too highly
the masterful direction of Profes
sor Isabel M. Schevill, which
brought into focus the rich
themes of the play. Her inspira
tion was reflected in the enthusi
asm with which her students per
formed.
The spoken Spanish was clear
and of very high quality, a credit
not only to the work done by Pro
fessor Schevill and Assistant Di
rector Luis Ponce de Leon but to
the entire Spanish teaching staff.

One cannot praise too highly
the masterful direction of Profes
sor Isabel M. Schevill, which
brought into focus the rich
themes of the play. Her inspira
tion was reflected in the enthusi
asm with which her students per
formed.
The spoken Spanish was clear
and of very high quality, a credit
not only to the work done by Pro
fessor Schevill and Assistant Di
rector Luis Ponce de Leon but to
the entire Spanish teaching staff.
Last weekend the Spanish Dra
matic Theatre of Stanford Uni- i
versity presented an outstanding
performance of Antonio Buero j
Vallejo’s play “En el ardiente os
curidad.”
The play, one of the most
thought-provoking ones to come
out of Spain In recent years, deals
with the age-old problem of suf
fering. here personified by Igna
cio, a blind student, who refuses
lo accept the illusion of happiness
that prevails in the educational
institution for I he blind he has
I entered.
WHAT HAKES this play
i unique is that Buero Vallejo,
Spain’s most gifted contemporary
I playwright, refuses to give in to
j the temptation of satisfying the
spectator with a cheap solution.
To him, paradoxically, the only
j blind man who “sees” is the one
i who knows he is blind and there
fore different from those who
j can see; he is a man condemned
j to inevitable suffering with only
i two ways out: rebellion and death,
I or resignation and acceptance of
1 his fate.
The intellectual conflict be
tween the optimistic Carlos and
| Ignacio is skillfully underlined in
' their struggle over the love of
Carlos’ girl friend, Juana. The
| play maintains constant tension,
I yet Buero Vallejo manages to
| preserve a delicate and fair bal
ance between opposing views,
which are enlivened by the per

sonal motives of I lie two oppo
nents. But it is the “tragic sense
of life” that prevails, for Carlos
will carry in him henceforth the
message of the one whose death
he caused.
THE ENTIRE CAST deserves!

which was an ensemble achieve- j

non-native Spanish speakers. Luis

light, yet managed to get his |
