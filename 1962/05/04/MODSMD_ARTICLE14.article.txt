The Cards will face two fine
Cal hurlers in John Rebelo and
Dave Dowling. Rebelo, a right
hander, made the third team of
the All-America squad last year,
compiling an 8-0 season record.
His curve ball, along with his ex
cellent control, beat Stanford
twice last year.
Dowling, a sophomore, is one
of the finest college left handers
in the country. Last week he
pitched eight no-hit innings
against Arizona, the nation’s top
team, only to lose in (he ninth
inning, 4-3, on unearned runs.
IN THE HITTING department
the two teams are about equal.
Third baseman Rich Ferrazzano
is currently hitting a blistering
.373 for Stanford. He is backed
up by outfielder Jim Chenu’s .316.
Cal’s two best batters are Bill
Bowley and Roger Hewitt, both
around .300.
Fehring feels that the Indians
have “the best opportunity to
beat Cal that we’ve had in a long
time,” The team is 4-6 in CIBA
play and a pair of wins would put
them in range of second place.
Cal is 2-5 and has lost nine

straight games, hut most of those
losses were to Arizona, and the
Bears could surprise. Behring pre
dicts a good crowd for the series,
expecting tomorrow’s attendance
to surpass the 1000 spectators on
hand for the USC double header.
