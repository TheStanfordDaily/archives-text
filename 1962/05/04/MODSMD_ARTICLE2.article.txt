# Liquor Policy Clarified; LASSU Acts on Forum
## 
### NILS WESSELI Associate Editor 
The objectives accomplished by
the passage of the New Liquor
Policy Amendment were clarified

at LASSU last night after that
body required the '‘Peace” Forum
to submit its future programs for
the approval of ASSU President
Bob Sayler.

The following statement was
read into the minutes:
“We would like to make it clear
that the New Liquor Policy
Amendment accomplishes the fol
lowing objectives:
• The amendment permits per
sons over 21 years of age to pos
sess and consume alcoholic bever
ages on campus without fear of
prosecution by student judicial
councils.
• The amendment requires no
change in the policy pertaining to
students under 21 years of age.
• The amendment permits stu
dents in any individual living unit
—such a a house at Stern, a casa
in Lagunita, a fraternity house—
to agree (hat liquor shall not be
brought into the living unit.
These points were presented to
the Legislature by the initiators
of the petition. We encourage all
students to be cognizant of the
additional responsibilities this
change places upon them.”
The statement was signed by
Sayler as ASSU President and by
Joel Moister and Jim Stewart as
initiators of the petition.
Although the Forum for the
Discussion of Non-violent Alter
natives to War must clear its pro
grams with Sayler for the bal
ance of the quarter, Sayler stated,
“I could not and would not refuse
them permission to bring speak
ers to campus.” The administra
tion will, apparently, continue to
prevent Forum from sponsoring
speakers of whatever persuasion
and thereby continue to overrule
Sayler.
LASSU’s action came as a re
sult of Forum's demonstration
last week against President Ken
nedy’s decision to resume nuclear
testing. Sayler called the demon
stration "a very clear partisan
action since they took sides on a
question of national policy.”
He said the Forum is "incapa
ble of non-partisan action because
its members are all of one per
suasion. This is a sign of their
partisanship, not a cause. The
cause is the administration’s re
fusal to allow them to present
speakers.”

grams with Sayler for the bal
ance of the quarter, Sayler stated,
“I could not and would not refuse
them permission to bring speak
ers to campus.” The administra
tion will, apparently, continue to
prevent Forum from sponsoring
speakers of whatever persuasion
and thereby continue to overrule
Sayler.
LASSU’s action came as a re
sult of Forum's demonstration
last week against President Ken
nedy’s decision to resume nuclear
testing. Sayler called the demon
stration "a very clear partisan
action since they took sides on a
question of national policy.”
He said the Forum is "incapa
ble of non-partisan action because
its members are all of one per
suasion. This is a sign of their
partisanship, not a cause. The
cause is the administration’s re
fusal to allow them to present
speakers.”
The objectives accomplished by
the passage of the New Liquor
Policy Amendment were clarified

at LASSU last night after that
body required the '‘Peace” Forum
to submit its future programs for
the approval of ASSU President
Bob Sayler.

The following statement was
read into the minutes:
“We would like to make it clear
that the New Liquor Policy
Amendment accomplishes the fol
lowing objectives:
• The amendment permits per
sons over 21 years of age to pos
sess and consume alcoholic bever
ages on campus without fear of
prosecution by student judicial
councils.
• The amendment requires no
change in the policy pertaining to
students under 21 years of age.
• The amendment permits stu
dents in any individual living unit
—such a a house at Stern, a casa
in Lagunita, a fraternity house—
to agree (hat liquor shall not be
brought into the living unit.
These points were presented to
the Legislature by the initiators
of the petition. We encourage all
students to be cognizant of the
additional responsibilities this
change places upon them.”
The statement was signed by
Sayler as ASSU President and by
Joel Moister and Jim Stewart as
initiators of the petition.
Although the Forum for the
Discussion of Non-violent Alter
natives to War must clear its pro
grams with Sayler for the bal
ance of the quarter, Sayler stated,
“I could not and would not refuse
them permission to bring speak
ers to campus.” The administra
