# Spring Show Oh Captain!,' Opens May 12
## 
### 
“The most complex show ever
done in Memorial Auditorium”
will open May 12 as Ram’s Head
puts on their annual spring show
"Oh Captain!” said Carl Zachris
son, producer.
The musical comedy adapted
from the Alec Opines film “Cap
tain’s Paradise” requires more
scene changes and a greater num
ber of sets <l2> than any other
production (student or non-stu
dent) ever given in Mem And, Za
chrisson explained. Two 21-foot
revolving turntables will be used,
holding three pie-shaped scenes
each.

The “Captain" of the title leads
a complex life, for he runs a
channel boat and has a wife in
London and a mistress in Paris.
Trouble arises when his wife
wins a trip to Paris in a cooking
contest and decides to visit her
husband.
Sets to be utilized include a
boat, an English church, a “prop
er English town,” and the Eiffel
tower outlined in lights. Duo to
the complexity of the sets the
technical director needs more
painters and all kinds of back
stage workers. Anyone who
wants to help is welcomed.
The spring show is Ram’s
Head’s biggest yeaxiy production
and “Oh Captain!” has eight
loads, a singing chorus of 28, and
a dancing chorus of 14. Leads
