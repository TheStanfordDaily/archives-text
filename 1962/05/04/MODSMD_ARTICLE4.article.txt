# Revolt in South Africa Coming, Says Hooper

“Revolution in South Africa is
coming. The only question is
whether it will be peaceful or
bloody,” predicted Mrs. Mary-
Louise Hooper, a member of the
African National Congress, in a
talk last night on “The Future of
South Africa.”

Mrs. Hooper pointed to a wave
of nationalism sweeping south
ward in Africa. “South Africa
can’t escape change, and there
is no basis for an evolutionary
process like the ones in Nigeria
and Tanganyika.”
The elements necessary for
gradual granting of civil rights
for the black population—“a his
tory of good treatment, confi
dence in the present ruling class,
and a definite time schedule for
improvement” are lacking in
South Africa, she said.

Instead, stated Mrs. Hooper,
“there is a history of atrocious
treatment which is getting worse,
a hatred between whites and non
whites, and no plan and no possi
bility for a plan for improve
ment.”

The 15 million non-whites
black, mixed, and Asian races—
are the most well-prepared for
self-rule of any of the African

peoples, said Mrs. Hooper. Their
45 per cent literacy rate is the
highest in Africa, and the per
centage of well-educated non
whites far exceeds that of any
other African nation, she said.
“The Africans demand a real
revolution politically, socially
and economically. But the aim of
the African National Congress is
to overthrow without bloodshed.”
Mrs. Hooper, who is the only
white member of the Congress.
The only possibility for a peace
ful revolution, in Mrs. Hooper’s
view, is an economic boycott on
South Africa. The U.S. and Eng
land upon whom South Africa
depends economically, could make
this effective, and if they do not
“these countries will bo responsi
ble for the coming blood-bath in
Africa,” she declared.

In spite of African hopes for a
peaceful revolution, “It looks as
though the present government is
preparing for war,” she declared.
She pointed out the increase in
the defense budget from 24 mil
lion to 60 million pounds last year
and the statement by the Minis
ter of Defense in March, 1961,
“In the same way as world pow
ers are arming for war, South
Africa is preparing for internal
conflicts.”
