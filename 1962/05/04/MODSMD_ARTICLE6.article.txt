# People Want to Communicate
## 
### PRISCILLA LASMARIAS ASSU Foreign Scholar from the Philippines 
When I got off the plane at the San Fran
cisco International Airport one September
night last fall with two suitcases and a
rather uncertain look in my face, it took me
quite a while to finally say to myself: “I’m

in America.’’ Today, eight
months later, not only can
I say with certainty that I
am in America, but also I
can add many other signi
ficant things to this state
ment as well.
One of these is the won
derful discovery I have
made first-hand: that peo
ple all over the world, no
matter who they are or
what they are, are basical
ly the same. They want to

communicate. In an age
where time and space have ceased to be bar
riers in terms of geographical distance, com
munication has become a vital aspect of in
ternational consciousness. Stanford Univer
sity is one place where I have seen and
experienced this worked out in tho grass
roots level.
TAKING PART in the student life of an
American campus is a privilege that not all
young people in foreign countries can avail

themselves of. What Stanford has to offer
is not only limited within the scope of aca
demics but also reaches out into the poten
tialities of a sizable international student
body. My daily contact with American and for
eign students has shown me a lot about com
munication and understanding among people
of diverse racial origins.
When I sit at breakfast with a dormmate
at Lagunita, chat with a German over a cup
of coffee at the I-Club, learn to sing a Japa
nese song with an African, I feel that the
color of my skin or the way the other fellow
speaks English is only of secondary import
ance. We are trying to put something across
that’s what matters. And whether it be
about the pros and cons of nuclear tests or
the latest letter from the girlfriend back
homo, it is this mutual sharing that makes it
as personally meaningful as a summit meet
ing between Kennedy and Khrushchev, per
haps.
.MV STAY with the people of Canyon,
Texas last Christmas was a stop further in
making me sec how far the facility of com
munication extends outside the university.
There I got a fairly good glimpse of a cross
section of an American community in the
families I stayed with and the various
groups I met. In short, I felt at home.
“Feeling at home” in a new place among
j new faces is one adjustment every newcomer
! has to make. It is not a laborious process.

Not when friendship and warmth are as
much a part of the other person’s response
as mine, regardless of whether we come from
opposite parts of the world. It did not neces
sarily take a 7.000-mile trip from the Philip
pines for me to realize this. I knew it all
along. Only, this time it has become much,
much more real.
This, I believe, is one of the far-reaching
[ benefits that the ASSU foreign scholarship
i program has given to every foreign scholar
; who has come to Stanford.
A PERSONAL involvement not with cold
j or abstract ideas but with people, thinking,
I feeling, responding people should be an in
l evitable part of one’s stay here. It does not
| end there, however. When the ten of us
| ASSU scholars this year will be going back
I to our countries, many other avenues of
communication will be opening up between
us and our people. When I go home, I shall
be bringing with me not only memories of
snow, hotdogs, supermarkets, or football
games, but also of more vital and lasting im
pressions.
j Communication its problems and its re
wards; this immediate concern has ceased
to bo something we read about in books or
hear about through second-hand information.
It is a part of us. I deeply feel that this will
go a long way not only in making better
citizens out of Stanford’s foreign students,
but better internationalists as well.

of diverse racial origins.
When I sit at breakfast with a dormmate
at Lagunita, chat with a German over a cup
of coffee at the I-Club, learn to sing a Japa
nese song with an African, I feel that the
color of my skin or the way the other fellow
speaks English is only of secondary import
ance. We are trying to put something across
that’s what matters. And whether it be
about the pros and cons of nuclear tests or
the latest letter from the girlfriend back
homo, it is this mutual sharing that makes it
as personally meaningful as a summit meet
ing between Kennedy and Khrushchev, per
haps.
.MV STAY with the people of Canyon,
Texas last Christmas was a stop further in
making me sec how far the facility of com
munication extends outside the university.
There I got a fairly good glimpse of a cross
section of an American community in the
families I stayed with and the various
groups I met. In short, I felt at home.
“Feeling at home” in a new place among
j new faces is one adjustment every newcomer
! has to make. It is not a laborious process.

Not when friendship and warmth are as
much a part of the other person’s response
as mine, regardless of whether we come from
opposite parts of the world. It did not neces
sarily take a 7.000-mile trip from the Philip
pines for me to realize this. I knew it all
along. Only, this time it has become much,
much more real.
This, I believe, is one of the far-reaching
[ benefits that the ASSU foreign scholarship
i program has given to every foreign scholar
; who has come to Stanford.
A PERSONAL involvement not with cold
j or abstract ideas but with people, thinking,
I feeling, responding people should be an in
l evitable part of one’s stay here. It does not
| end there, however. When the ten of us
| ASSU scholars this year will be going back
I to our countries, many other avenues of
communication will be opening up between
us and our people. When I go home, I shall
be bringing with me not only memories of
snow, hotdogs, supermarkets, or football
games, but also of more vital and lasting im
pressions.
j Communication its problems and its re
wards; this immediate concern has ceased
to bo something we read about in books or
hear about through second-hand information.
It is a part of us. I deeply feel that this will
go a long way not only in making better
citizens out of Stanford’s foreign students,
but better internationalists as well.
