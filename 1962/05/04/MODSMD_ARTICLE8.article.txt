# Grad Student Rosencranz Wins; Referendum Passes
## Largest Vote in History Includes 424 Graduates 
### FRANCES FISHER 
Armin Rosencranz, graduate
student in political science, won
the presidency of the ASSU by a
margin of 262 votes over Jim An
druss in the largest voting turn
out in Stanford’s history.
The Liquor Referendum passed
easily with 2,716 for and 741
against.
A total of 3,604 votes was cast,
a total much larger than last
year’s 2,520 final vote count and
also larger than this year’s pri
maries where 2,634 students
voted. Rosencranz received 1,882
votes, while Andruss received
1,620. Melinda Gartzman, Elec
tions Committee Chairman, term
ed the graduate student turnout
of 424 votes “unusually large.”
She pointed out that the figure
424 was of graduate students who
signed the voting lists as gradu
ates. Since many people did not
indicate their class, this number
is an underestimate of the actual
voting graduates.
IN THE RACE for Class of ’63
President, Marshall Turner tri
umphed over David Henry 336 to
253. For Class of '62 President,
Dick Hillman received 278 votes
giving him a majority over Mike
Saliba who received 242.
For Florence Moore Represent
ative ,Carole Stevens was elected
with 101 votes against Diane
Elder with 82. Cary Dickicson
won Stern Representative with
131 votes over Paul Klabunde
with 69.
Rosencranz issued the follow
ing statement to The Daily. “I
appreciate the confidence which
my constituents have reposed in
me and would like to thank
them for their discriminating ex
ercise of the franchise.
“A heavy debt of gratitude is
owed to the various constituent
organizations which worked so
devotedly for the cause;
“The ‘Aliens for Armin,’ Com
mittee which was so instrumental
in delivering the foreign student
vote; The ‘Arabs for Armin’ Com
mittee for bringing out the Mos
lem vote; The ‘Anti-Behaviorists
for Armin’ and the ‘Alcoholics for
Armin’ for doing their part.
“It is most important that the
ASSU be served by the most tal
ented and capable people avail
able at Stanford. Admittedly we
have gone a long way toward
that goal in this election, but the
job of serving the University well
must enlist the efforts of many
people. When I was drafted by
my students, and other support
ers 10 days ago, I did not con
template, as I do tonight, the
tasks that lie ahead. For inspira
tion I draw upon Ulysses’ Dec
laration in the Odyssey; ‘And
what if the gods above do throw
me out on the wine-dark sea; I
have a will that is inured to suf
fering and I will steel it to endure
that too.’ Finally, I would like to
allay the apprehensions of many
by announcing that I will not be
a candidate for governor of Cali
fornia in November.”

JIM ANDRESS was not avail
able for comment.
Bob Sayler, out-going ASSU
president released the following
comment on the election to The
Daily:
“It is difficult to comment on
the amorphous concept called Ar
min Rosencranz. He has a choice
to make, I should think, before
comment is appropriate. To im
press some Mr. Rosencranz ridi
culed student government; to im
press others he embraced it.
“Which man is Rosencranz? In
his statement to The Daily last
night he presented facetious com
ments. Yet in asides, concomitant
ly with his release of that state
ment, I am told he expressed his
sincere desire to do a conscien
tious job. This is representative
of the story of Armin Rosencranz
and his campaign for political of
fice.
“In short, the residents of La
gunita Court and those of Stern
Hall heard from two different
Rosencranz.es during the cam
paign. This tactic, as I see it, sug
gests that as a political scientist,
Armin Rosencranz is a fraud. The
democratic prosesses, as he well
knows, are premised on the right
of the voter to know what he is
voting for. Mr. Rosencranz chose
to deny this right. For two weeks,
Armin Rosencranz has been tell
ing at least two different stories,
and it won him the election, but
some of his supporters must ex
pect to be disappointed.
“A score of students have de
voted untold hours attempting to
raise the level of student govern
ment during the last six months;
it is their profound hope that Mr.
Rosencranz will help them. Mr.
Rosencranb distributed posters
which read ‘Send a man to do a
boy’s job.’ If Mr. Rosencranz is a
man, it doesn’t have to be a boy’s
job,’’ Sayler concluded.

owed to the various constituent

in delivering the foreign student
vote; The ‘Arabs for Armin’ Com
mittee for bringing out the Mos

for Armin’ and the ‘Alcoholics for
Armin’ for doing their part.
“It is most important that the
ASSU be served by the most tal
ented and capable people avail
able at Stanford. Admittedly we
have gone a long way toward
that goal in this election, but the
job of serving the University well
must enlist the efforts of many
people. When I was drafted by
my students, and other support
ers 10 days ago, I did not con
template, as I do tonight, the
tasks that lie ahead. For inspira
tion I draw upon Ulysses’ Dec
laration in the Odyssey; ‘And
what if the gods above do throw
me out on the wine-dark sea; I
have a will that is inured to suf
fering and I will steel it to endure
that too.’ Finally, I would like to
allay the apprehensions of many
by announcing that I will not be
a candidate for governor of Cali
fornia in November.”

Bob Sayler, out-going ASSU
president released the following
comment on the election to The
Daily:
“It is difficult to comment on
the amorphous concept called Ar
min Rosencranz. He has a choice
to make, I should think, before
comment is appropriate. To im
press some Mr. Rosencranz ridi
culed student government; to im
press others he embraced it.
“Which man is Rosencranz? In
his statement to The Daily last
night he presented facetious com
ments. Yet in asides, concomitant
ly with his release of that state
ment, I am told he expressed his
sincere desire to do a conscien
tious job. This is representative
of the story of Armin Rosencranz
and his campaign for political of
fice.
“In short, the residents of La
gunita Court and those of Stern
Hall heard from two different
Rosencranz.es during the cam
paign. This tactic, as I see it, sug
gests that as a political scientist,
Armin Rosencranz is a fraud. The
democratic prosesses, as he well
knows, are premised on the right
of the voter to know what he is
voting for. Mr. Rosencranz chose
to deny this right. For two weeks,
Armin Rosencranz has been tell
ing at least two different stories,
and it won him the election, but
some of his supporters must ex
pect to be disappointed.
“A score of students have de
voted untold hours attempting to
raise the level of student govern
ment during the last six months;
it is their profound hope that Mr.
Rosencranz will help them. Mr.
Rosencranb distributed posters
which read ‘Send a man to do a
boy’s job.’ If Mr. Rosencranz is a
man, it doesn’t have to be a boy’s
job,’’ Sayler concluded.

Armin Rosencranz, graduate
student in political science, won
the presidency of the ASSU by a
margin of 262 votes over Jim An

a total much larger than last
year’s 2,520 final vote count and
also larger than this year’s pri

voted. Rosencranz received 1,882
votes, while Andruss received
1,620. Melinda Gartzman, Elec

people. When I was drafted by
my students, and other support

template, as I do tonight, the
tasks that lie ahead. For inspira

what if the gods above do throw
me out on the wine-dark sea; I
have a will that is inured to suf

Bob Sayler, out-going ASSU
president released the following
comment on the election to The
Daily:
“It is difficult to comment on
the amorphous concept called Ar
min Rosencranz. He has a choice
to make, I should think, before
comment is appropriate. To im
press some Mr. Rosencranz ridi
culed student government; to im
press others he embraced it.
“Which man is Rosencranz? In
his statement to The Daily last
night he presented facetious com
ments. Yet in asides, concomitant
ly with his release of that state
ment, I am told he expressed his
sincere desire to do a conscien
tious job. This is representative
of the story of Armin Rosencranz
and his campaign for political of
fice.
“In short, the residents of La
gunita Court and those of Stern
Hall heard from two different
Rosencranz.es during the cam
paign. This tactic, as I see it, sug
gests that as a political scientist,
Armin Rosencranz is a fraud. The
democratic prosesses, as he well
knows, are premised on the right
of the voter to know what he is
voting for. Mr. Rosencranz chose
to deny this right. For two weeks,
Armin Rosencranz has been tell
ing at least two different stories,
and it won him the election, but
some of his supporters must ex
pect to be disappointed.
“A score of students have de
voted untold hours attempting to
raise the level of student govern
ment during the last six months;
it is their profound hope that Mr.
Rosencranz will help them. Mr.
Rosencranb distributed posters
which read ‘Send a man to do a
boy’s job.’ If Mr. Rosencranz is a
man, it doesn’t have to be a boy’s
job,’’ Sayler concluded.


NEWLY-ELECTED ASSU President Armin Rosencranz and ASSU Vice-President Priscilla Ferguson pose
for the election picture in Rosencranz's office in the political science department.
Armin Rosencranz, graduate
student in political science, won
the presidency of the ASSU by a
margin of 262 votes over Jim An
druss in the largest voting turn
out in Stanford’s history.
The Liquor Referendum passed
easily with 2,716 for and 741
against.
A total of 3,604 votes was cast,
a total much larger than last
year’s 2,520 final vote count and
also larger than this year’s pri
maries where 2,634 students
voted. Rosencranz received 1,882
votes, while Andruss received
1,620. Melinda Gartzman, Elec
tions Committee Chairman, term
ed the graduate student turnout
of 424 votes “unusually large.”
She pointed out that the figure
424 was of graduate students who
signed the voting lists as gradu
ates. Since many people did not
indicate their class, this number
is an underestimate of the actual
voting graduates.
IN THE RACE for Class of ’63
President, Marshall Turner tri
umphed over David Henry 336 to
253. For Class of '62 President,
Dick Hillman received 278 votes
giving him a majority over Mike
Saliba who received 242.
For Florence Moore Represent
ative ,Carole Stevens was elected
with 101 votes against Diane
Elder with 82. Cary Dickicson
won Stern Representative with
131 votes over Paul Klabunde
with 69.
Rosencranz issued the follow
ing statement to The Daily. “I
appreciate the confidence which
my constituents have reposed in
me and would like to thank
them for their discriminating ex
ercise of the franchise.
“A heavy debt of gratitude is
owed to the various constituent
organizations which worked so
devotedly for the cause;
“The ‘Aliens for Armin,’ Com
mittee which was so instrumental
in delivering the foreign student
vote; The ‘Arabs for Armin’ Com
