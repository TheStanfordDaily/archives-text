I lore's the wildest bargain since the purchase of Alaska... 11
smash selections by the biggest names in the business... and
all for a mere lt's your chance to pick up 11 hit numbers
for 9d each! Each is the biggest hit from 11 great albums by
these tremendous stars. Including the sensational new Latin
swingers. The Brothers Castro.
How come such a fantastic bargain? Simple. It's a nefarious
scheme on our part. Once your hear one number from each of
these exciting new albums, you’ll want to get them all! While
you're at your record dealer grabbing this bargain, tantalize
yourself with these gems: nancy wilson/cannonball
adderly. .. close-up— The Kingston Trio... once upon a
time—The Lcttcrmcn ... stars in our r.YES-Thc Four Fresh
men .., LINGER A WHILE WITH VIC DAMONE.
But don't just sit there. Rush out and get "Who's News! - ’
at that 99 c* price! After all, how can you go wrong for a
lousy 99c?
