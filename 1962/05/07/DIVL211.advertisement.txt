Graduates
As a graduate engineer, you undoubtedly want to seek
affiliation w'th an engineering organization in which
you can specialize in your particular area of interest.
Such an organization should be able to assure you that
as a member of its engineering team, your professional
growth is limited only by your capacity to expand your
engineering "know-how".
Your firm should be expected to present to you a career
plan wherein company sponsored educational pro
grams combine with challenging engineering assign
ments to provide ample opportunity for you to move
forward in your profession.
Your firm should be expected to encourage creativity
and the early acceptance of responsibility. GILFILLAN
is such an organization.
The research and development programs in progress
at GILFILLAN now offer a wide variety of opportunities
for graduate engineers who seek careers in electronics.
Why not request that the Placement Center arrange an
interview with me on Campus, Monday, May 7th? I
will welcome an opportunity to answer any questions
you may have concerning GILFILLAN. Whether you
have already decided on an affiliation or not, I promise
that your interview will be most enlightening.
