8:52.7, 12.2 seconds under the old school record.
Cal’s top performance came
from Gene Johnson in the high
jump. Johnson set a new meet
record of 8-10't hut missed three
times with the bar at seven feet,
trying to equal his top mark. The
Bears also took second and a tie
for third in the high jump.
CAL MIGHT have been able to
improve its performance if some

Outstanding for the Cubs were
Dave Archibald. Dave Fishback
and Bill Cartel.
Archibald double in the 220 and
440 with times of 21.3 and 48.7,
the latter a meet record. He need

Things were expected to go great (or the Stanford track team
Saturday, and everything went as expected. I lie Indians grabbed
13 out of 15 possible first places, set five Big Meet records and

It was Stanford’s first hig Big
Meet victory during Hie six-year
reign of Coach Payton Jordan,
and it gave the Cards a 33-32-2
lead in the 67-year series.
A crowd of 1800 roasted in the
81-degree heat at the Stanford

ed their complete athletic domi
nation over the Bears this year 1 .
THK HIGHLIGHT of the com
petition was Harry McCalla’s
8:52.7 two-mile run. This time
was 12.2 seconds under the old
Stanford record and ranks third
in the nation for this year.
Running remarkable times of
63 and 64.8 seconds in the first
two laps, McCalla gave notice
that a new record was in the mak
ing. By the end of the fifth lap.
nearly everyone, including Cal
fans, was aware of the possibility
and was cheering him as he pass
ed the finish line on each lap.
The applause and urging con
tinued as the eighth and final lap
began, and McCalla responded by

quickening his pace. Coming
down the last 100 yards, a couple
of stragglers vacated the inside
lane for him. and his final kick
carried him comfortably past the
old school record.
Shortly before this race, Dave
Weill, the Card’s king-sized dis
cus thrower, had established an
other new Stanford record with a
toss of 189 feet 11 inches. This
was four and a half inches past
the old record which Weill also
held.
CAL’S TOP DISCUS man, Dave
Maggard, nosed out Don Bell for
second place. It took the best
throw of his life, 163-2, to beat
Bell, who had a fine third place
mark of 163-U.
Stanford had two double win
ners in the running events. Phil
Lamoreaux won the 100-yard
dash in 9.9 and took the 220 in
21.7. Ho also led off the mile re
lay’s Big Meet record time of

STANFORD’S HARRY McCALLA was a strained and lonely man as he
finished his record-breaking two mile run, Saturday. His time was
8:52.7, 12.2 seconds under the old school record.
Cal’s top performance came
from Gene Johnson in the high
jump. Johnson set a new meet
record of 8-10't hut missed three
times with the bar at seven feet,
trying to equal his top mark. The
Bears also took second and a tie
for third in the high jump.
CAL MIGHT have been able to
improve its performance if some
of its fine freshmen spikers could
have competed for the varsity.
Outstanding for the Cubs were
Dave Archibald. Dave Fishback
and Bill Cartel.
Archibald double in the 220 and

the latter a meet record. He need
ed the excellent 220 time to beat
out Stanford’s Larry Questad,
who finished in 21.7. Questad,
Stanford’s fine frosh sprinter,
could not be stopped, however,
in the 100 and 220 low hurdles, in

Meanwhile Cal's Carter was
setting a new school and meet

STANFORD’S HARRY McCALLA was a strained and lonely man as he
finished his record-breaking two mile run, Saturday. His time was
8:52.7, 12.2 seconds under the old school record.
Cal’s top performance came
from Gene Johnson in the high
jump. Johnson set a new meet
record of 8-10't hut missed three
times with the bar at seven feet,
trying to equal his top mark. The
Bears also took second and a tie
for third in the high jump.
CAL MIGHT have been able to
improve its performance if some
of its fine freshmen spikers could
have competed for the varsity.
Outstanding for the Cubs were
Dave Archibald. Dave Fishback
and Bill Cartel.
Archibald double in the 220 and
440 with times of 21.3 and 48.7,
the latter a meet record. He need
ed the excellent 220 time to beat
out Stanford’s Larry Questad,
who finished in 21.7. Questad,
Stanford’s fine frosh sprinter,
could not be stopped, however,
in the 100 and 220 low hurdles, in
which he doubled.
Meanwhile Cal's Carter was
setting a new school and meet
record with a high jump of fi-SQ.
The Bears also received an out
standing performance in the 80,
from Fishback’s lime of 1:53

Things were expected to go great (or the Stanford track team
Saturday, and everything went as expected. I lie Indians grabbed
13 out of 15 possible first places, set five Big Meet records and
set two school marks in swamping California, 88 1/3 to 42 2/3.

It was Stanford’s first hig Big
Meet victory during Hie six-year
reign of Coach Payton Jordan,
and it gave the Cards a 33-32-2
lead in the 67-year series.
A crowd of 1800 roasted in the
81-degree heat at the Stanford
Stadium as the Indians reassert
ed their complete athletic domi
nation over the Bears this year 1 .
THK HIGHLIGHT of the com
petition was Harry McCalla’s
8:52.7 two-mile run. This time
was 12.2 seconds under the old
Stanford record and ranks third
in the nation for this year.
Running remarkable times of
63 and 64.8 seconds in the first
two laps, McCalla gave notice
that a new record was in the mak
ing. By the end of the fifth lap.
nearly everyone, including Cal
fans, was aware of the possibility
and was cheering him as he pass
ed the finish line on each lap.
The applause and urging con
tinued as the eighth and final lap
began, and McCalla responded by

quickening his pace. Coming
down the last 100 yards, a couple
of stragglers vacated the inside
lane for him. and his final kick
carried him comfortably past the
old school record.
Shortly before this race, Dave
Weill, the Card’s king-sized dis
cus thrower, had established an
other new Stanford record with a
toss of 189 feet 11 inches. This
was four and a half inches past
the old record which Weill also
held.
CAL’S TOP DISCUS man, Dave
Maggard, nosed out Don Bell for
second place. It took the best
throw of his life, 163-2, to beat
Bell, who had a fine third place
mark of 163-U.
Stanford had two double win
ners in the running events. Phil
Lamoreaux won the 100-yard
dash in 9.9 and took the 220 in
21.7. Ho also led off the mile re
lay’s Big Meet record time of

Things were expected to go great (or the Stanford track team
Saturday, and everything went as expected. I lie Indians grabbed
13 out of 15 possible first places, set five Big Meet records and
set two school marks in swamping California, 88 1/3 to 42 2/3.
Cal gained a little revenge w hen their freshmen beat Stanford
in the lilllo Big Meet. 75“:; to*
55' it

It was Stanford’s first hig Big
Meet victory during Hie six-year
reign of Coach Payton Jordan,
and it gave the Cards a 33-32-2
lead in the 67-year series.
A crowd of 1800 roasted in the
81-degree heat at the Stanford
Stadium as the Indians reassert
ed their complete athletic domi
nation over the Bears this year 1 .
THK HIGHLIGHT of the com
petition was Harry McCalla’s
8:52.7 two-mile run. This time
was 12.2 seconds under the old
Stanford record and ranks third
in the nation for this year.
Running remarkable times of
63 and 64.8 seconds in the first
two laps, McCalla gave notice
that a new record was in the mak
ing. By the end of the fifth lap.
nearly everyone, including Cal
fans, was aware of the possibility
and was cheering him as he pass
ed the finish line on each lap.
The applause and urging con
tinued as the eighth and final lap
began, and McCalla responded by

quickening his pace. Coming
down the last 100 yards, a couple
of stragglers vacated the inside
lane for him. and his final kick
carried him comfortably past the
old school record.
Shortly before this race, Dave
Weill, the Card’s king-sized dis
cus thrower, had established an
other new Stanford record with a
toss of 189 feet 11 inches. This
was four and a half inches past
the old record which Weill also
held.
CAL’S TOP DISCUS man, Dave
Maggard, nosed out Don Bell for
second place. It took the best
throw of his life, 163-2, to beat
Bell, who had a fine third place
mark of 163-U.
Stanford had two double win
ners in the running events. Phil
Lamoreaux won the 100-yard
dash in 9.9 and took the 220 in
21.7. Ho also led off the mile re
lay’s Big Meet record time of
3:11.7 with a fine 48.0 quarter
mile.
Steve Cortright took both hur
dle races, 14.7 in the highs and
21.3 in the lows.

STANFORD’S HARRY McCALLA was a strained and lonely man as he
finished his record-breaking two mile run, Saturday. His time was
8:52.7, 12.2 seconds under the old school record.
Cal’s top performance came
from Gene Johnson in the high
jump. Johnson set a new meet
record of 8-10't hut missed three
times with the bar at seven feet,
trying to equal his top mark. The
Bears also took second and a tie
for third in the high jump.
CAL MIGHT have been able to
improve its performance if some
of its fine freshmen spikers could
have competed for the varsity.
Outstanding for the Cubs were
Dave Archibald. Dave Fishback
and Bill Cartel.
Archibald double in the 220 and
440 with times of 21.3 and 48.7,
the latter a meet record. He need
ed the excellent 220 time to beat
out Stanford’s Larry Questad,
who finished in 21.7. Questad,
Stanford’s fine frosh sprinter,
could not be stopped, however,
in the 100 and 220 low hurdles, in
which he doubled.
Meanwhile Cal's Carter was
setting a new school and meet
record with a high jump of fi-SQ.
The Bears also received an out
standing performance in the 80,
from Fishback’s lime of 1:53
