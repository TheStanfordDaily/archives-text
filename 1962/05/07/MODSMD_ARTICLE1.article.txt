It was Stanford’s first hig Big
Meet victory during Hie six-year
reign of Coach Payton Jordan,
and it gave the Cards a 33-32-2
lead in the 67-year series.
A crowd of 1800 roasted in the
81-degree heat at the Stanford
Stadium as the Indians reassert
ed their complete athletic domi
nation over the Bears this year 1 .
THK HIGHLIGHT of the com
petition was Harry McCalla’s
8:52.7 two-mile run. This time
was 12.2 seconds under the old
Stanford record and ranks third
in the nation for this year.
Running remarkable times of
63 and 64.8 seconds in the first
two laps, McCalla gave notice
that a new record was in the mak
ing. By the end of the fifth lap.
nearly everyone, including Cal
fans, was aware of the possibility
and was cheering him as he pass
ed the finish line on each lap.
The applause and urging con
tinued as the eighth and final lap
began, and McCalla responded by

quickening his pace. Coming
down the last 100 yards, a couple
of stragglers vacated the inside
lane for him. and his final kick
carried him comfortably past the
old school record.
Shortly before this race, Dave
Weill, the Card’s king-sized dis
cus thrower, had established an
other new Stanford record with a
toss of 189 feet 11 inches. This
was four and a half inches past
the old record which Weill also
held.
CAL’S TOP DISCUS man, Dave
Maggard, nosed out Don Bell for
second place. It took the best
throw of his life, 163-2, to beat
Bell, who had a fine third place
mark of 163-U.
Stanford had two double win
ners in the running events. Phil
Lamoreaux won the 100-yard
dash in 9.9 and took the 220 in
21.7. Ho also led off the mile re
lay’s Big Meet record time of
3:11.7 with a fine 48.0 quarter
mile.
Steve Cortright took both hur
dle races, 14.7 in the highs and
