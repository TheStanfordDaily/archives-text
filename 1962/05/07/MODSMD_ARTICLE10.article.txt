# US. Claims Reds Break Cease-Fire

### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The
United States Sunday charged
pro-Communist rebels in Laos
with a “violation of the cease
fire’’ which has been in effect in
that troubled kingdom for one
year.
However, the heavy Red attack
which captured the government
stronghold of Nam Tha came as
no surprise to officials in the
Kennedy administration, who
have been warning strongman
Phoumi Nosavan that he was in
viting just such a rebel operation
by his buildup in that and other
areas.
The department charged that
the Communist action was a clear
violation of the May, 1961, Gene
va cease-fire agreement.
The department said Nam Tha
was not under the control of the
pro-Communist Pathet Lao rebels
when the truce went into effect,
and therefore should have re
mained that way under the cease
fire.
Officials said the United Slates
was calling the violation to the
attention of Britain, which is co
chairman with Russia of the
agreement to preserve the cease
fire and create a neutral coalition
government in Laos.
