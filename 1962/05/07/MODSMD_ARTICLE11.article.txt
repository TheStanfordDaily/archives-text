Irvins Howe and Lewis Loser,
Tile American Communist Party:
a critical history (I’raeger, 1962)
612 pp. $2.75 (paperback).)

Associate Professor of History
In early 1958 two professors at
Brandeis published the first in
tellectually respectable study of
the American Communist Party
from its origins in 1919 to its near
disintegration following the Sovi
et repression of the Hungarian
revolt in 1956. As Irving Howe’s
name appears first on the title
page, the 1962 paperback reprint
(slightly revised and fitted with
an epilogue) is properly to be in
cluded among the recent books
by Stanford authors which the
enterprising Student -Faculty
Board wishes to bring to our at
tention.
Professor Howe’s study offers
a solid contribution to our under
standing of a major historical
event, but on first sight it ap
pears encumbered with two seri
ous obstacles to wide acceptance.
One apparent obstacle is the au
thors’ obvious and deliberate re
fusal to write an objective his
tory. The word “critical” in their
subtitle turns out to mean in
large part “hostile,” for they
choose to reveal the record of the
American Communist Party most
ly through the lenses of irony,
gentle ridicule, and cold scorn.
What else, you might say at first,
could one expect from a literary
critic and a sociologist, staunch
members of the anti-communist
Left, who chose to dedicate their
book to Ignazio Silonb and Milov
an Djilas, confirmed enemies of
the Stalinist perversion of Len
in's revolution? Whatever Howe’s
study may be, it is plainly not
disinterested.
A SECOND apparent obstacle
has been the publication in the
past five years of the Fund-for
the-Republic’s first five volumes
of the history of American Com
munism, and in the next five
years about nine more in the
series may be expected. Three of
the works presently available
plainly supersede as history sub
stantial parts of the Howe study:
Theodore Draper’s two volumes
on the Twenties and David Shan
non’s narrative of the period
1945 must be considered superior
in their use of unpublished rec
ords and personal interviews (two
kinds of sources which Howe and
Coser omit) and in their tactic of
letting their facts carry more
weight than their comments in
shaping their interpretation. It is
additionally clear that Draper’s
and Shannon’s anti-communist
liberalism permits the reader to
view the Communist Party with
more detached sympathy than
does the anti-communist radical
ism of Howe and Coser, and to
some extent it is only through
gaining at least temporary sym
pathy that one reaches under
standing. Of course the reader
may not want to spend forty
hours and $25 to gain a greater
understanding of the Party' if he
can come to terms with the cheap
er and shorter paperback, and for
the story of the Party in the
Thirties he has no choice but to
read Howe. The fact is, however,
that the large series is authentic,
first-rate history, while in the de
gree to which Howe’s study
strives to be history at all it falls
short of its competitor, though it
easily ranks in second place
among the available histories.
It would bo a pity of Howe and
Coser were to be judged solely
on their failure to show impar
tiality in their study or to offer
historical-capsule competition to

Diaper, Shannon, and Co., for
they have set out to do something
very different, and I am con
vinced that they have succeeded.
Theirs is not history hut an ana
lytical essay on an historical
movement. They propose to dis
sect the nature and character of
the dissenting and independent
political party which fell under
the control of second-rate, de
pendent functionaries who pro
ceeded to run it after 1929 as an
unfree arm of the Soviet political
state. It was no longer possible
for American Communists to de
velop political positions on the
basis of their own calculations
of how (he Communist Party
could best win support for its
cause among the American vot
ers. With the rise of Stalin to
power in the Kremlin the Party
was never again permitted even
strategic latitude, and the result
ing story of Communist leader
ship in the United States became
the humorless travesty on com
mon sense and the comedy of po
litical miscalculation we have
come to associate with the parly
line of the 1930’5. Moscow be
lieved that it knew better than
New York how to appeal to the
Negro and the trade unionist and
how to compete with the New
Deal.
As a consequence (though
Howe and Coser are vague on
this point) Communist influence
in American public life could not
possibly have counted for less,
one way or another. Then came
the Popular Front, which by a
superb irony made it possible for
American Communists to enjoy
respectability and status once
again as (falsely) simply another
“liberal” party and thereby gain
greater sympathy for Commu
nism as an alternative to capital
ism in the United States, when in
fact the chief aim of the Soviet
master who still controlled the
party line was to strengthen ex
isting capitalist governments
everywhere in order to build an
anti-fascist coalition in support
of the Soviet Union.
FOLLOWING THE disillusion
ing two-year reversal of strategy
which accompanied the NAZI-SO
VIET Pact of 1939, the Popular
Front period of the American
Communist Party once more re
turned in a fanatical commitment
to patriotism and national loyal
ty following Hitler’s invasion of
Russia. Party officials were de
termined to censure all who in
their eyes stood in the way of
the war effort such as Negroes
who sought guarantees of civil
rights and coal miners who
sought higher wages) and to rally
behind the arms contractors wTio
were now building the once
hated weapons of capitalist op
pression. By 1946 the line once
more shifted, the rapprochement
between liberals and Communists
completely and abruptly disin
tegrated, and the positive influ
ence of the Party on American
life once more sank close to abso
lute zero.
The important point which
Howe and Coser make in their
resume of the Party’s evolution
to 1956 is that the simple theory
of conspiracy is seriously inade
quate to account for the appeal
which the Party had for most of
its members. In a final chapter,
which stands as a separate but
crowning essay, they present with
often brilliant insight a cogent
theory of the Stalinist nature of
the Party. They make it clear
that for only the small inner
guard did the Party justify itself
as an agent of the Soviet system
intent solely on furthering the
aims and security of a foreign

j government. For the much larger
I band of the faithful, Party work
j was justified by its supposed aim
I of furthering the cause of Com
munism as a legitimate political
ideal. For a number of card-carry
ing members, then, the Party did
not imply “conspiracy” so much
as a total dogmatic commitment
to an ideology which included
as only one of its tenets the dog
matic view that the security of
the Soviet Union was essential to
the well being of the Communist
movement. Communists, the au
thors seem to be saying, may be
unfit to teach in free institutions
of learning but cannot be account
ed conspirators solely on the evi
dence of their party membership.
On the operating importance of
this latter point, the authors are
not entirely convincing. Did not
the inner core completely deter
mine the policies of the Party and
make certain that they were bind
ing on everyone else?) But the
real importance of the authors’
position consists of the insight it
offers into the complex nature of
the Party’s appeal during a time
when it would seem incredible
that anyone possessed with more
than half a mind could have ad
hered so slavishly to its intellec
tually preposterous twists and
turns.
Judged not as history but as an
essay on history, Howe’s and Co
ser’s book stands in the best tra
dition of analytical criticism in
formed with both intelligence and
passion. Here the literary critic
and the sociologist outstrip their
historian-competitors. They have
done more: they admirably ex
press the special kind of revulsion
which any genuine radical was al
most bound to experience when
confronted with the Communist
Party’s Stalinist record of politi
cal prostitution and betrayal of
the radical impulse. This revul
sion was itself a part of the his
torical record (no Americans have
fought the Communists more bit
terly or consistently than the anti
communist Left), and it provides
the book with a distinctive moral
commitment. In such an essay
this commitment alone is worth
many times the price of admis
sion and the time spent in reading
it.

this point) Communist influence
in American public life could not
possibly have counted for less,
one way or another. Then came
the Popular Front, which by a
superb irony made it possible for
American Communists to enjoy
respectability and status once
again as (falsely) simply another
“liberal” party and thereby gain
greater sympathy for Commu
nism as an alternative to capital
ism in the United States, when in
fact the chief aim of the Soviet
master who still controlled the
party line was to strengthen ex
isting capitalist governments
everywhere in order to build an
anti-fascist coalition in support
of the Soviet Union.
FOLLOWING THE disillusion
ing two-year reversal of strategy
which accompanied the NAZI-SO
VIET Pact of 1939, the Popular
Front period of the American
Communist Party once more re
turned in a fanatical commitment
to patriotism and national loyal
ty following Hitler’s invasion of
Russia. Party officials were de
termined to censure all who in
their eyes stood in the way of
the war effort such as Negroes
who sought guarantees of civil
rights and coal miners who
sought higher wages) and to rally
behind the arms contractors wTio
were now building the once
hated weapons of capitalist op
pression. By 1946 the line once
more shifted, the rapprochement
between liberals and Communists
completely and abruptly disin
tegrated, and the positive influ
ence of the Party on American
life once more sank close to abso
lute zero.
The important point which
Howe and Coser make in their
resume of the Party’s evolution
to 1956 is that the simple theory
of conspiracy is seriously inade
quate to account for the appeal
which the Party had for most of
its members. In a final chapter,
which stands as a separate but
crowning essay, they present with
often brilliant insight a cogent
theory of the Stalinist nature of
the Party. They make it clear
that for only the small inner
guard did the Party justify itself
as an agent of the Soviet system
intent solely on furthering the
aims and security of a foreign

j government. For the much larger
I band of the faithful, Party work
j was justified by its supposed aim
I of furthering the cause of Com
munism as a legitimate political
ideal. For a number of card-carry
ing members, then, the Party did
not imply “conspiracy” so much
as a total dogmatic commitment
to an ideology which included
as only one of its tenets the dog
matic view that the security of
the Soviet Union was essential to
the well being of the Communist
movement. Communists, the au
thors seem to be saying, may be
unfit to teach in free institutions
of learning but cannot be account
ed conspirators solely on the evi
dence of their party membership.
On the operating importance of
this latter point, the authors are
not entirely convincing. Did not
the inner core completely deter
mine the policies of the Party and
make certain that they were bind
ing on everyone else?) But the
real importance of the authors’
position consists of the insight it
offers into the complex nature of
the Party’s appeal during a time
when it would seem incredible
that anyone possessed with more
than half a mind could have ad
hered so slavishly to its intellec
tually preposterous twists and
turns.
Judged not as history but as an
essay on history, Howe’s and Co
ser’s book stands in the best tra
dition of analytical criticism in
formed with both intelligence and
passion. Here the literary critic
and the sociologist outstrip their
historian-competitors. They have
done more: they admirably ex
press the special kind of revulsion
which any genuine radical was al
most bound to experience when
confronted with the Communist
Party’s Stalinist record of politi
cal prostitution and betrayal of
the radical impulse. This revul
sion was itself a part of the his
torical record (no Americans have
fought the Communists more bit
terly or consistently than the anti
communist Left), and it provides
the book with a distinctive moral
commitment. In such an essay
this commitment alone is worth
many times the price of admis
sion and the time spent in reading
it.

a critical history (I’raeger, 1962)

Associate Professor of History
In early 1958 two professors at
Brandeis published the first in
tellectually respectable study of
the American Communist Party
from its origins in 1919 to its near
disintegration following the Sovi
et repression of the Hungarian
revolt in 1956. As Irving Howe’s
name appears first on the title
page, the 1962 paperback reprint
(slightly revised and fitted with
an epilogue) is properly to be in
cluded among the recent books
by Stanford authors which the
enterprising Student -Faculty
Board wishes to bring to our at
tention.
Professor Howe’s study offers
a solid contribution to our under
standing of a major historical
event, but on first sight it ap
pears encumbered with two seri
ous obstacles to wide acceptance.
One apparent obstacle is the au
thors’ obvious and deliberate re
fusal to write an objective his
tory. The word “critical” in their
subtitle turns out to mean in
large part “hostile,” for they
choose to reveal the record of the
American Communist Party most
ly through the lenses of irony,
gentle ridicule, and cold scorn.
What else, you might say at first,
could one expect from a literary
critic and a sociologist, staunch
members of the anti-communist
Left, who chose to dedicate their
book to Ignazio Silonb and Milov
an Djilas, confirmed enemies of
the Stalinist perversion of Len
in's revolution? Whatever Howe’s
study may be, it is plainly not
disinterested.
A SECOND apparent obstacle
has been the publication in the
past five years of the Fund-for
the-Republic’s first five volumes
of the history of American Com
munism, and in the next five
years about nine more in the
series may be expected. Three of
the works presently available
plainly supersede as history sub
stantial parts of the Howe study:
Theodore Draper’s two volumes
on the Twenties and David Shan
non’s narrative of the period
1945 must be considered superior
in their use of unpublished rec
ords and personal interviews (two
kinds of sources which Howe and
Coser omit) and in their tactic of
letting their facts carry more
weight than their comments in
shaping their interpretation. It is
additionally clear that Draper’s
and Shannon’s anti-communist
liberalism permits the reader to
view the Communist Party with
more detached sympathy than
does the anti-communist radical
ism of Howe and Coser, and to
some extent it is only through
gaining at least temporary sym
pathy that one reaches under
standing. Of course the reader
may not want to spend forty
hours and $25 to gain a greater
understanding of the Party' if he
can come to terms with the cheap
er and shorter paperback, and for
the story of the Party in the
Thirties he has no choice but to
read Howe. The fact is, however,
that the large series is authentic,
first-rate history, while in the de
gree to which Howe’s study
strives to be history at all it falls
short of its competitor, though it
easily ranks in second place
among the available histories.
It would bo a pity of Howe and
Coser were to be judged solely
on their failure to show impar
tiality in their study or to offer
historical-capsule competition to

Diaper, Shannon, and Co., for
they have set out to do something
very different, and I am con
vinced that they have succeeded.
Theirs is not history hut an ana
lytical essay on an historical
movement. They propose to dis
sect the nature and character of
the dissenting and independent
political party which fell under
the control of second-rate, de
pendent functionaries who pro
ceeded to run it after 1929 as an
unfree arm of the Soviet political
state. It was no longer possible
for American Communists to de
velop political positions on the
basis of their own calculations
of how (he Communist Party
could best win support for its
cause among the American vot
ers. With the rise of Stalin to
power in the Kremlin the Party
was never again permitted even
strategic latitude, and the result
ing story of Communist leader
ship in the United States became
the humorless travesty on com
mon sense and the comedy of po
litical miscalculation we have
come to associate with the parly
line of the 1930’5. Moscow be
lieved that it knew better than
New York how to appeal to the
Negro and the trade unionist and
how to compete with the New
Deal.
As a consequence (though
Howe and Coser are vague on
this point) Communist influence
in American public life could not
possibly have counted for less,
one way or another. Then came

cluded among the recent books
by Stanford authors which the
enterprising Student -Faculty
Board wishes to bring to our at
tention.
Professor Howe’s study offers
a solid contribution to our under
standing of a major historical
event, but on first sight it ap
pears encumbered with two seri
ous obstacles to wide acceptance.
One apparent obstacle is the au
thors’ obvious and deliberate re
fusal to write an objective his
tory. The word “critical” in their
subtitle turns out to mean in
large part “hostile,” for they
choose to reveal the record of the
American Communist Party most
ly through the lenses of irony,
gentle ridicule, and cold scorn.
What else, you might say at first,
could one expect from a literary
critic and a sociologist, staunch
members of the anti-communist
Left, who chose to dedicate their
book to Ignazio Silonb and Milov
an Djilas, confirmed enemies of
the Stalinist perversion of Len
in's revolution? Whatever Howe’s
study may be, it is plainly not
disinterested.
A SECOND apparent obstacle
has been the publication in the
past five years of the Fund-for
the-Republic’s first five volumes
of the history of American Com
munism, and in the next five
years about nine more in the
series may be expected. Three of
the works presently available
plainly supersede as history sub
stantial parts of the Howe study:
Theodore Draper’s two volumes
on the Twenties and David Shan
non’s narrative of the period
1945 must be considered superior
in their use of unpublished rec
ords and personal interviews (two
kinds of sources which Howe and
Coser omit) and in their tactic of
letting their facts carry more
weight than their comments in
shaping their interpretation. It is
additionally clear that Draper’s
and Shannon’s anti-communist
liberalism permits the reader to
view the Communist Party with
more detached sympathy than
does the anti-communist radical
ism of Howe and Coser, and to
some extent it is only through
gaining at least temporary sym
pathy that one reaches under
standing. Of course the reader
may not want to spend forty
hours and $25 to gain a greater
understanding of the Party' if he
can come to terms with the cheap
er and shorter paperback, and for
the story of the Party in the
Thirties he has no choice but to
read Howe. The fact is, however,
that the large series is authentic,
first-rate history, while in the de
gree to which Howe’s study
strives to be history at all it falls
short of its competitor, though it
easily ranks in second place
among the available histories.
It would bo a pity of Howe and
Coser were to be judged solely
on their failure to show impar
tiality in their study or to offer
historical-capsule competition to

Diaper, Shannon, and Co., for
they have set out to do something
very different, and I am con
vinced that they have succeeded.
Theirs is not history hut an ana
lytical essay on an historical
movement. They propose to dis
sect the nature and character of
the dissenting and independent
political party which fell under
the control of second-rate, de
pendent functionaries who pro
ceeded to run it after 1929 as an
unfree arm of the Soviet political
state. It was no longer possible
for American Communists to de
velop political positions on the
basis of their own calculations
of how (he Communist Party
could best win support for its
cause among the American vot
ers. With the rise of Stalin to
power in the Kremlin the Party
was never again permitted even
strategic latitude, and the result
ing story of Communist leader
ship in the United States became
the humorless travesty on com
mon sense and the comedy of po
litical miscalculation we have
come to associate with the parly
line of the 1930’5. Moscow be
lieved that it knew better than
New York how to appeal to the
Negro and the trade unionist and
how to compete with the New
Deal.
As a consequence (though
Howe and Coser are vague on
this point) Communist influence
in American public life could not
possibly have counted for less,
one way or another. Then came
the Popular Front, which by a
superb irony made it possible for
American Communists to enjoy
respectability and status once
again as (falsely) simply another
“liberal” party and thereby gain
greater sympathy for Commu
nism as an alternative to capital
ism in the United States, when in
fact the chief aim of the Soviet
master who still controlled the
party line was to strengthen ex
isting capitalist governments
everywhere in order to build an
anti-fascist coalition in support
of the Soviet Union.
FOLLOWING THE disillusion
ing two-year reversal of strategy
which accompanied the NAZI-SO
VIET Pact of 1939, the Popular
Front period of the American
Communist Party once more re
turned in a fanatical commitment
to patriotism and national loyal
ty following Hitler’s invasion of
Russia. Party officials were de
termined to censure all who in
their eyes stood in the way of
the war effort such as Negroes
who sought guarantees of civil
rights and coal miners who
sought higher wages) and to rally
behind the arms contractors wTio
were now building the once
hated weapons of capitalist op
pression. By 1946 the line once
more shifted, the rapprochement
between liberals and Communists
completely and abruptly disin
tegrated, and the positive influ
ence of the Party on American
life once more sank close to abso
lute zero.
The important point which
Howe and Coser make in their
resume of the Party’s evolution
to 1956 is that the simple theory
of conspiracy is seriously inade
quate to account for the appeal
which the Party had for most of
its members. In a final chapter,
which stands as a separate but
crowning essay, they present with
often brilliant insight a cogent
theory of the Stalinist nature of
the Party. They make it clear
that for only the small inner
guard did the Party justify itself
as an agent of the Soviet system
intent solely on furthering the
aims and security of a foreign

j government. For the much larger
I band of the faithful, Party work
j was justified by its supposed aim
I of furthering the cause of Com
munism as a legitimate political
ideal. For a number of card-carry
ing members, then, the Party did
not imply “conspiracy” so much
as a total dogmatic commitment
to an ideology which included
as only one of its tenets the dog
matic view that the security of
the Soviet Union was essential to
the well being of the Communist
movement. Communists, the au
thors seem to be saying, may be
unfit to teach in free institutions
of learning but cannot be account
ed conspirators solely on the evi
dence of their party membership.
On the operating importance of
this latter point, the authors are
not entirely convincing. Did not
the inner core completely deter
mine the policies of the Party and
make certain that they were bind
ing on everyone else?) But the
real importance of the authors’
position consists of the insight it
offers into the complex nature of
the Party’s appeal during a time
when it would seem incredible
that anyone possessed with more
than half a mind could have ad
hered so slavishly to its intellec
tually preposterous twists and
turns.
Judged not as history but as an
essay on history, Howe’s and Co
ser’s book stands in the best tra
dition of analytical criticism in
formed with both intelligence and
passion. Here the literary critic
and the sociologist outstrip their
historian-competitors. They have
done more: they admirably ex
press the special kind of revulsion
which any genuine radical was al
most bound to experience when
confronted with the Communist
Party’s Stalinist record of politi
cal prostitution and betrayal of
the radical impulse. This revul
sion was itself a part of the his
torical record (no Americans have
fought the Communists more bit
terly or consistently than the anti
communist Left), and it provides
the book with a distinctive moral
commitment. In such an essay
this commitment alone is worth
many times the price of admis
sion and the time spent in reading
it.

which accompanied the NAZI-SO
VIET Pact of 1939, the Popular
Front period of the American
Communist Party once more re
turned in a fanatical commitment
to patriotism and national loyal
ty following Hitler’s invasion of
Russia. Party officials were de
termined to censure all who in
their eyes stood in the way of
the war effort such as Negroes
who sought guarantees of civil
rights and coal miners who
sought higher wages) and to rally
behind the arms contractors wTio
were now building the once
hated weapons of capitalist op
pression. By 1946 the line once
more shifted, the rapprochement
between liberals and Communists
completely and abruptly disin
tegrated, and the positive influ
ence of the Party on American
life once more sank close to abso
lute zero.
The important point which
Howe and Coser make in their
resume of the Party’s evolution
to 1956 is that the simple theory
of conspiracy is seriously inade
quate to account for the appeal
which the Party had for most of
its members. In a final chapter,
which stands as a separate but
crowning essay, they present with
often brilliant insight a cogent
theory of the Stalinist nature of
the Party. They make it clear
that for only the small inner
guard did the Party justify itself
as an agent of the Soviet system
intent solely on furthering the
aims and security of a foreign

j government. For the much larger
I band of the faithful, Party work
j was justified by its supposed aim
I of furthering the cause of Com
munism as a legitimate political
ideal. For a number of card-carry
ing members, then, the Party did
not imply “conspiracy” so much
as a total dogmatic commitment
to an ideology which included
as only one of its tenets the dog
matic view that the security of
the Soviet Union was essential to
the well being of the Communist
movement. Communists, the au
thors seem to be saying, may be
unfit to teach in free institutions
of learning but cannot be account
ed conspirators solely on the evi
dence of their party membership.
On the operating importance of
this latter point, the authors are
not entirely convincing. Did not
the inner core completely deter
mine the policies of the Party and
make certain that they were bind
ing on everyone else?) But the
real importance of the authors’
position consists of the insight it
offers into the complex nature of
the Party’s appeal during a time
when it would seem incredible
that anyone possessed with more
than half a mind could have ad
hered so slavishly to its intellec
tually preposterous twists and
turns.
Judged not as history but as an
essay on history, Howe’s and Co
ser’s book stands in the best tra
dition of analytical criticism in
formed with both intelligence and
passion. Here the literary critic
and the sociologist outstrip their
historian-competitors. They have
done more: they admirably ex
press the special kind of revulsion
which any genuine radical was al
most bound to experience when
confronted with the Communist
Party’s Stalinist record of politi
cal prostitution and betrayal of
the radical impulse. This revul
sion was itself a part of the his
torical record (no Americans have
fought the Communists more bit
terly or consistently than the anti
communist Left), and it provides
the book with a distinctive moral
commitment. In such an essay
this commitment alone is worth
many times the price of admis
sion and the time spent in reading
it.

Associate Professor of History
In early 1958 two professors at
Brandeis published the first in
tellectually respectable study of
the American Communist Party
from its origins in 1919 to its near
disintegration following the Sovi
et repression of the Hungarian
revolt in 1956. As Irving Howe’s
name appears first on the title
page, the 1962 paperback reprint
(slightly revised and fitted with
an epilogue) is properly to be in
cluded among the recent books
by Stanford authors which the
enterprising Student -Faculty
Board wishes to bring to our at
tention.
Professor Howe’s study offers
a solid contribution to our under
standing of a major historical
event, but on first sight it ap
pears encumbered with two seri
ous obstacles to wide acceptance.
One apparent obstacle is the au
thors’ obvious and deliberate re
fusal to write an objective his
tory. The word “critical” in their
subtitle turns out to mean in
large part “hostile,” for they
choose to reveal the record of the
American Communist Party most
ly through the lenses of irony,
gentle ridicule, and cold scorn.
What else, you might say at first,
could one expect from a literary
critic and a sociologist, staunch
members of the anti-communist
Left, who chose to dedicate their
book to Ignazio Silonb and Milov
an Djilas, confirmed enemies of
the Stalinist perversion of Len
in's revolution? Whatever Howe’s
study may be, it is plainly not
disinterested.
A SECOND apparent obstacle
has been the publication in the
past five years of the Fund-for
the-Republic’s first five volumes
of the history of American Com
munism, and in the next five
years about nine more in the
series may be expected. Three of
the works presently available
plainly supersede as history sub
stantial parts of the Howe study:
Theodore Draper’s two volumes
on the Twenties and David Shan
non’s narrative of the period
1945 must be considered superior
in their use of unpublished rec
ords and personal interviews (two
kinds of sources which Howe and
Coser omit) and in their tactic of
letting their facts carry more
weight than their comments in
shaping their interpretation. It is
additionally clear that Draper’s
and Shannon’s anti-communist
liberalism permits the reader to
view the Communist Party with
more detached sympathy than
does the anti-communist radical
ism of Howe and Coser, and to
some extent it is only through
gaining at least temporary sym
pathy that one reaches under
standing. Of course the reader
may not want to spend forty
hours and $25 to gain a greater
understanding of the Party' if he
can come to terms with the cheap
er and shorter paperback, and for
the story of the Party in the
Thirties he has no choice but to
read Howe. The fact is, however,
that the large series is authentic,
first-rate history, while in the de
gree to which Howe’s study
strives to be history at all it falls
short of its competitor, though it
easily ranks in second place
among the available histories.
It would bo a pity of Howe and
Coser were to be judged solely
on their failure to show impar
tiality in their study or to offer
historical-capsule competition to

Diaper, Shannon, and Co., for
they have set out to do something
very different, and I am con
vinced that they have succeeded.
Theirs is not history hut an ana
lytical essay on an historical
movement. They propose to dis
sect the nature and character of
the dissenting and independent
political party which fell under
the control of second-rate, de
pendent functionaries who pro
ceeded to run it after 1929 as an
unfree arm of the Soviet political
state. It was no longer possible
for American Communists to de
velop political positions on the
basis of their own calculations
of how (he Communist Party
could best win support for its
cause among the American vot
ers. With the rise of Stalin to
power in the Kremlin the Party
was never again permitted even
strategic latitude, and the result
ing story of Communist leader
ship in the United States became
the humorless travesty on com
mon sense and the comedy of po
litical miscalculation we have
come to associate with the parly
line of the 1930’5. Moscow be
lieved that it knew better than
New York how to appeal to the
Negro and the trade unionist and
how to compete with the New
Deal.
As a consequence (though
Howe and Coser are vague on
this point) Communist influence
in American public life could not
possibly have counted for less,
one way or another. Then came
the Popular Front, which by a
superb irony made it possible for
American Communists to enjoy
respectability and status once
again as (falsely) simply another
“liberal” party and thereby gain
greater sympathy for Commu
nism as an alternative to capital
ism in the United States, when in
fact the chief aim of the Soviet
master who still controlled the
party line was to strengthen ex
isting capitalist governments
everywhere in order to build an
anti-fascist coalition in support
of the Soviet Union.

could one expect from a literary
critic and a sociologist, staunch
members of the anti-communist
Left, who chose to dedicate their
book to Ignazio Silonb and Milov
an Djilas, confirmed enemies of
the Stalinist perversion of Len
in's revolution? Whatever Howe’s
study may be, it is plainly not
disinterested.
A SECOND apparent obstacle
has been the publication in the
past five years of the Fund-for
the-Republic’s first five volumes
of the history of American Com
munism, and in the next five
years about nine more in the
series may be expected. Three of
the works presently available
plainly supersede as history sub
stantial parts of the Howe study:
Theodore Draper’s two volumes
on the Twenties and David Shan
non’s narrative of the period
1945 must be considered superior
in their use of unpublished rec
ords and personal interviews (two
kinds of sources which Howe and
Coser omit) and in their tactic of
letting their facts carry more
weight than their comments in
shaping their interpretation. It is
additionally clear that Draper’s
and Shannon’s anti-communist
liberalism permits the reader to
view the Communist Party with
more detached sympathy than
does the anti-communist radical
ism of Howe and Coser, and to
some extent it is only through
gaining at least temporary sym
pathy that one reaches under
standing. Of course the reader
may not want to spend forty
hours and $25 to gain a greater
understanding of the Party' if he
can come to terms with the cheap
er and shorter paperback, and for
the story of the Party in the
Thirties he has no choice but to
read Howe. The fact is, however,
that the large series is authentic,
first-rate history, while in the de
gree to which Howe’s study
strives to be history at all it falls
short of its competitor, though it
easily ranks in second place
among the available histories.
It would bo a pity of Howe and
Coser were to be judged solely
on their failure to show impar
tiality in their study or to offer
historical-capsule competition to

Diaper, Shannon, and Co., for
they have set out to do something
very different, and I am con
vinced that they have succeeded.
Theirs is not history hut an ana
lytical essay on an historical
movement. They propose to dis
sect the nature and character of
the dissenting and independent
political party which fell under
the control of second-rate, de
pendent functionaries who pro
ceeded to run it after 1929 as an
unfree arm of the Soviet political
state. It was no longer possible
for American Communists to de
velop political positions on the
basis of their own calculations
of how (he Communist Party
could best win support for its
cause among the American vot
ers. With the rise of Stalin to
power in the Kremlin the Party
was never again permitted even
strategic latitude, and the result
ing story of Communist leader
ship in the United States became
the humorless travesty on com
mon sense and the comedy of po
litical miscalculation we have
come to associate with the parly
line of the 1930’5. Moscow be
lieved that it knew better than
New York how to appeal to the
Negro and the trade unionist and
how to compete with the New
Deal.
As a consequence (though
Howe and Coser are vague on
this point) Communist influence
in American public life could not
possibly have counted for less,
one way or another. Then came
the Popular Front, which by a
superb irony made it possible for
American Communists to enjoy
respectability and status once
again as (falsely) simply another
“liberal” party and thereby gain
greater sympathy for Commu
nism as an alternative to capital
ism in the United States, when in
fact the chief aim of the Soviet
master who still controlled the
party line was to strengthen ex
isting capitalist governments
everywhere in order to build an
anti-fascist coalition in support
of the Soviet Union.
FOLLOWING THE disillusion
ing two-year reversal of strategy
which accompanied the NAZI-SO
VIET Pact of 1939, the Popular
Front period of the American
Communist Party once more re
turned in a fanatical commitment
to patriotism and national loyal
ty following Hitler’s invasion of
Russia. Party officials were de
termined to censure all who in
their eyes stood in the way of
the war effort such as Negroes
who sought guarantees of civil
rights and coal miners who
sought higher wages) and to rally
behind the arms contractors wTio
were now building the once
hated weapons of capitalist op
pression. By 1946 the line once
more shifted, the rapprochement
between liberals and Communists
completely and abruptly disin
tegrated, and the positive influ
ence of the Party on American
life once more sank close to abso
lute zero.
The important point which
Howe and Coser make in their
resume of the Party’s evolution
to 1956 is that the simple theory
of conspiracy is seriously inade
quate to account for the appeal
which the Party had for most of
its members. In a final chapter,
which stands as a separate but
crowning essay, they present with
often brilliant insight a cogent
theory of the Stalinist nature of
the Party. They make it clear
that for only the small inner
guard did the Party justify itself
as an agent of the Soviet system
intent solely on furthering the
aims and security of a foreign

j government. For the much larger
I band of the faithful, Party work
j was justified by its supposed aim
I of furthering the cause of Com
munism as a legitimate political
ideal. For a number of card-carry
ing members, then, the Party did
not imply “conspiracy” so much
as a total dogmatic commitment
to an ideology which included
as only one of its tenets the dog
matic view that the security of
the Soviet Union was essential to
the well being of the Communist
movement. Communists, the au
thors seem to be saying, may be
unfit to teach in free institutions
of learning but cannot be account
ed conspirators solely on the evi
dence of their party membership.
On the operating importance of
this latter point, the authors are
not entirely convincing. Did not
the inner core completely deter
mine the policies of the Party and
make certain that they were bind
ing on everyone else?) But the
real importance of the authors’
position consists of the insight it
offers into the complex nature of
the Party’s appeal during a time
when it would seem incredible
that anyone possessed with more
than half a mind could have ad
hered so slavishly to its intellec
tually preposterous twists and
turns.
Judged not as history but as an
essay on history, Howe’s and Co
ser’s book stands in the best tra
dition of analytical criticism in
formed with both intelligence and
passion. Here the literary critic
and the sociologist outstrip their
historian-competitors. They have
done more: they admirably ex
press the special kind of revulsion
which any genuine radical was al
most bound to experience when
confronted with the Communist
Party’s Stalinist record of politi
cal prostitution and betrayal of
the radical impulse. This revul
sion was itself a part of the his
torical record (no Americans have
fought the Communists more bit
terly or consistently than the anti
communist Left), and it provides
the book with a distinctive moral
commitment. In such an essay
this commitment alone is worth
many times the price of admis
sion and the time spent in reading
it.

Associate Professor of History
In early 1958 two professors at
Brandeis published the first in
tellectually respectable study of
the American Communist Party
from its origins in 1919 to its near
disintegration following the Sovi
et repression of the Hungarian
revolt in 1956. As Irving Howe’s
name appears first on the title
page, the 1962 paperback reprint
(slightly revised and fitted with
an epilogue) is properly to be in
cluded among the recent books
by Stanford authors which the
enterprising Student -Faculty
Board wishes to bring to our at
tention.
Professor Howe’s study offers
a solid contribution to our under
standing of a major historical
event, but on first sight it ap
pears encumbered with two seri
ous obstacles to wide acceptance.
One apparent obstacle is the au
thors’ obvious and deliberate re
fusal to write an objective his
tory. The word “critical” in their
subtitle turns out to mean in
large part “hostile,” for they
choose to reveal the record of the
American Communist Party most
ly through the lenses of irony,
gentle ridicule, and cold scorn.
What else, you might say at first,
could one expect from a literary
critic and a sociologist, staunch
members of the anti-communist
Left, who chose to dedicate their
book to Ignazio Silonb and Milov
an Djilas, confirmed enemies of
