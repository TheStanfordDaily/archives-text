PETTINESS
Editor, The Daily:
After saying that Mi\ Rosen
cranz “ . . . has a choice to make
(in sobriety of attitude toward
student government) before com
ment is appropriate,” Bob Sayier
immediately rushed on into an ex
tensive and peevish comment.
Saylor says that Rosencranz is a
fraud, and that he has circum
vented the democratic process by
denying the students the right to
know what they are voting for.
Has it occurred to Mr. Sayier
that wo were not forced to vote
for Rosencranz? If the democrat
ic process was circumvented, it
was actually we poor, uninformed
students who voted for Armin
who circumvented it. Perhaps
Sayier would have preferred to

appoint his successor. That would
have avoided the tragedy of let
ting us make a mistake, and cer
tainly would have assured a con
tinuation of the “democratic proc
ess.”
I don’t know Rosencranz, but I
know, as one who has spent a
few years around Stanford, that
his willingness to laugh at an
often laughable student govern
ment is a relief, and somehow I’m
not too afraid that his willingness
to laugh will disqualify him from
doing any serious work in stu
dent government. The very fine
work done by Sayier and his
predecessors can only be hurt by
the kind of pettiness—yes, and
pomposity—displayed in Friday’s
statement to The Daily.
