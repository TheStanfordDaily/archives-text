Editor, The Daily:
The petition for off-campus
housing for undergraduate wom
en was coldly received by the
Dean of Women last Tuesday.
The petition not only failed to
evoke any sympathy, which most
of those who signed expected by
now anyway, but it was received
without any comment whatso
ever, An appeal for discussion
implied by a request that ques
tions might be asked was deliber
ately disregarded. The Dean did
not read the petition while I was
in her office, and gave the strong
impi’ession that she had no in
tention of doing so. As I left. I
was told that if I could think of
any thing further to say, I was
welcome to come hack and say it.
This reception was far from
what I had expected. Sympathetic
consideration, a strong rebuttal,
or any statement of policy would
have been appreciated. This is the
least a student might expect from
a “dean.” The thoughtfully articu
lated opinion of nearly 200 wom
en students certainly deserves
more respect than it has received.
It demands careful consideration,
and more, it demands a statement
of policy and reasons supporting
this policy. We have asked
thoughtful questions, and we ex
pect equally thoughtful answers.
This situation is indicative of a
vapidity and illusiveness appar
ently common in the Dean’s of
fice. There have been no strong
or definite stands taken concern
ing recent and important issues
such as co-ed housing or the pro
posed change in policy regarding
liquor on campus. The skeletal
policy issued from the Dean’s of
fice on co-ed housing has been far
from satisfactory. Reasons for
rejecting the proposal so far have
amounted to no more than a
series of vague allusions to the ef
fect that the situation on campus
does not make co-ed housing feas
ible. These allusions aren’t rea
sons, but watery, übiquitous
statements designed to pass over
the issue and to leave the status
quo as unruffled as possible.
Wild and hysterical clamorings
by immature students may de
serve this kind of treatment. But
those of us who have taken the
time to think carefully about the

problems of women at Stanford,
who have taken the trouble to
formulate our ideas into a co
herent document and who have
offered a reasonable solution to
the problems ought to be given
respect and consideration.
The authors and supporters of
the petition for off-campus hous
ing for undergraduate women de
mand a statement of policy, and
further, if our arguments and so
lution to the problem are rejected
we expect to be given reasons for
their rejection. We will not he
satisfied with the noncommittal
silence characteristic of the pres
ent Dean of Women.

Editor. The Daily:
As editor of KRINO I should
like to thank all those students
who helped justify my hopes that
Stanford would accept such a
publication. The student body has
reinforced the supposition on
which the magazine’s financial,
intellectual, and moral support
ers work namely, that Stanford
requires a vehicle for the serious
student. I apologize to those stu
dents who were unable to obtain
a copy of the magazine the first
issue sold out within a day and a
half. However, the enthusiasm
which gave impetus to KRINO’S
sales also gave impetus to the
idea that subsequent issues will
be in order.

Editor, The Daily:
To criticize The Daily is really
quite the rage
Especially when fraternal broth
ers are lower on the page.
Jokes about poor Scotty are cer
tainly a bore,
But that one about the garbage
can hardly makes us laugh the
more.
I mean, really! We’ve all heard
that one before.
The trenchant critic lets fly his
barbs with intrepidity
In staffers he sees both puerility
and stupidity
Their writings lack both quantity
and quality.
Yet methinks he ought to aim
these missiles
At his own ridiculous epistles.

quite the rage
Especially when fraternal broth

Jokes about poor Scotty are cer

But that one about the garbage

In staffers he sees both puerility

The petition for off-campus
housing for undergraduate wom
en was coldly received by the
Dean of Women last Tuesday.
The petition not only failed to
evoke any sympathy, which most
of those who signed expected by
now anyway, but it was received
without any comment whatso
ever, An appeal for discussion
implied by a request that ques
tions might be asked was deliber
ately disregarded. The Dean did
not read the petition while I was
in her office, and gave the strong
impi’ession that she had no in
tention of doing so. As I left. I
was told that if I could think of
any thing further to say, I was
welcome to come hack and say it.
This reception was far from
what I had expected. Sympathetic
consideration, a strong rebuttal,
or any statement of policy would
have been appreciated. This is the
least a student might expect from
a “dean.” The thoughtfully articu
lated opinion of nearly 200 wom
en students certainly deserves
more respect than it has received.
It demands careful consideration,
and more, it demands a statement
of policy and reasons supporting
this policy. We have asked
thoughtful questions, and we ex
pect equally thoughtful answers.
This situation is indicative of a
vapidity and illusiveness appar
ently common in the Dean’s of
fice. There have been no strong
or definite stands taken concern
ing recent and important issues
such as co-ed housing or the pro
posed change in policy regarding
liquor on campus. The skeletal
policy issued from the Dean’s of
fice on co-ed housing has been far
from satisfactory. Reasons for
rejecting the proposal so far have
amounted to no more than a
series of vague allusions to the ef
fect that the situation on campus
does not make co-ed housing feas
ible. These allusions aren’t rea
sons, but watery, übiquitous
statements designed to pass over
the issue and to leave the status
quo as unruffled as possible.
Wild and hysterical clamorings
by immature students may de
serve this kind of treatment. But
those of us who have taken the
time to think carefully about the

problems of women at Stanford,
who have taken the trouble to
formulate our ideas into a co
herent document and who have
offered a reasonable solution to
the problems ought to be given
respect and consideration.
The authors and supporters of
the petition for off-campus hous
ing for undergraduate women de
mand a statement of policy, and
further, if our arguments and so
lution to the problem are rejected
we expect to be given reasons for
their rejection. We will not he

As editor of KRINO I should
like to thank all those students
who helped justify my hopes that
Stanford would accept such a
publication. The student body has
reinforced the supposition on
which the magazine’s financial,
intellectual, and moral support
ers work namely, that Stanford
requires a vehicle for the serious
student. I apologize to those stu
dents who were unable to obtain
a copy of the magazine the first
issue sold out within a day and a
half. However, the enthusiasm
which gave impetus to KRINO’S
sales also gave impetus to the
idea that subsequent issues will
be in order.

CRITICIZE
Editor, The Daily:
To criticize The Daily is really
quite the rage
Especially when fraternal broth
ers are lower on the page.
Jokes about poor Scotty are cer
tainly a bore,
But that one about the garbage
can hardly makes us laugh the
more.
I mean, really! We’ve all heard
that one before.
The trenchant critic lets fly his
barbs with intrepidity
In staffers he sees both puerility
and stupidity
Their writings lack both quantity
and quality.
Yet methinks he ought to aim
these missiles
At his own ridiculous epistles.

NO C OMMENT
Editor, The Daily:
The petition for off-campus
housing for undergraduate wom
en was coldly received by the
Dean of Women last Tuesday.
The petition not only failed to
evoke any sympathy, which most
of those who signed expected by
now anyway, but it was received
without any comment whatso
ever, An appeal for discussion
implied by a request that ques
tions might be asked was deliber
ately disregarded. The Dean did
not read the petition while I was
in her office, and gave the strong
impi’ession that she had no in
tention of doing so. As I left. I
was told that if I could think of
any thing further to say, I was
welcome to come hack and say it.
This reception was far from
what I had expected. Sympathetic
consideration, a strong rebuttal,
or any statement of policy would
have been appreciated. This is the
least a student might expect from
a “dean.” The thoughtfully articu
lated opinion of nearly 200 wom
en students certainly deserves
more respect than it has received.
It demands careful consideration,
and more, it demands a statement
of policy and reasons supporting
this policy. We have asked
thoughtful questions, and we ex
pect equally thoughtful answers.
This situation is indicative of a
vapidity and illusiveness appar
ently common in the Dean’s of
fice. There have been no strong
or definite stands taken concern
ing recent and important issues
such as co-ed housing or the pro
posed change in policy regarding
liquor on campus. The skeletal
policy issued from the Dean’s of
fice on co-ed housing has been far
from satisfactory. Reasons for
rejecting the proposal so far have
amounted to no more than a
series of vague allusions to the ef
fect that the situation on campus
does not make co-ed housing feas
ible. These allusions aren’t rea
sons, but watery, übiquitous
statements designed to pass over
the issue and to leave the status
quo as unruffled as possible.
Wild and hysterical clamorings
by immature students may de
serve this kind of treatment. But
those of us who have taken the
time to think carefully about the

problems of women at Stanford,
who have taken the trouble to
formulate our ideas into a co
herent document and who have
offered a reasonable solution to
the problems ought to be given
respect and consideration.
The authors and supporters of
the petition for off-campus hous
ing for undergraduate women de
mand a statement of policy, and
further, if our arguments and so
lution to the problem are rejected
we expect to be given reasons for
their rejection. We will not he
satisfied with the noncommittal
silence characteristic of the pres
ent Dean of Women.
