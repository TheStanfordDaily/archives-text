# LONBORG, SUTHERLAND ALLOW ONLY NINE HITS
## Stanford Loses at Cal, Wins Here By CLEAN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
### 
Stanford retained third place in the CM HA, as the Cards and Cal split a weekend baseball
series by the identical scores of 4-1
Cal won the Friday contest, breaking an eight-game Card win skein, and stopping the In
dian nine one short of tying the school record of nine straight wins.
Stanford started what they hope is a new win streak Saturday, behind Jim Lonborg's five-hit

pitching. The Golden Bears suf
fered from atrocious out fielding
over the two games. John Rehelo
could have pitched a no-hit game
for the Bears Friday but for a
misplay by left-fielder Terry
Heinrichs. Saturday, centerfielder
A1 Mindell misplayed Jack Al-

len’s towering 425-foot fly ball
into a run-scoring triple that
sparked a Card rally, putting
them ahead to stay, and knocked
Bear soph pitcher Dave Dowling
out of a possible win.
The Bears broke ahead early
in the second of the two contests,
scoring in the second on two
singles and a hit hatter, and it
appeared that one run would he
enough, as Dowling struck out
the first six men he faced, and
had a no-hitter into (lie fifth in
ning.
808 OVERMAN broke up that
nonsense with a single in that
inning, but died on base. Finally,
Stanford got, on the stick in the
sixth frame.
Greg Post walked and stole
second. With one out. Allen sent
a tremendous fly ball to deep
center field, but Mindell was
playing him deep and should have
had the ball.
Instead, he ran in circles and
finally made a leap at the ball.
He missed and Post scored, Allen
getting a triple, Jim Chenu plated
Allen with a single, all the scor
ing that Lonborg would need, as
it turned out. However, the Cards
got two insurance tallies, one in
the sixth, when Joel Shulman’s
double drove in Warren Newell,
and another in the seventh, as
Rich Ferrazzano singled O. J. So
lander across.
E O N 15 O R G FINISHED with
eight strikeouts, and walked only
one.
The Friday contest was a com
edy of errors, Cal making two,
and Stanford five. Darrell Suther
land gave up only four hits, but
three unearned tallies crossed the
plate and he lost 4-1. The Stan
ford run was Greg Post’s homer,
perhaps the shortest and weirdest
four-master in history.
The blow ruined Cal starter
Rebelo’s shut-out and no-hitter.
CAE WAS AHEAD 1-0 going
into the Stanford half of the sixth
inning when Post hit Rebelo’s
first pitch into short left field, a

twisting line drive that Heinrichs |
could have taken with a mini
mum of effort.
However he held back until the
last minute, when he charged the
ball and dove for it. He missed, j
and the ball rolled to the fence.
The fast Posl was at third by
the time Heinrichs picked up the
ball, but he ran into the base um
pire rounding the bag. The um
pire immediately waved him
across the plate on the interfer
ence. but it was unnecessary, as
the outfield relay went over the
catcher’s head.
The run tied it up. but Cal t
went ahead to stay in their half |
of the sixth. Mindell walked, stole |
second and continued to third on
catcher Overman’s throwing er- 1
ror. He scored on a sacrifice fly.
THEBE WAS ALMOST a riot
in the Saturday contest. Jim
Chenu was tagged out stealing
third and got tangled up with
Doug Burnett. Cal third-sacker.
They started pushing, but the
umpires had it broken up when

Cal relief pitcher Bill Oakley
charged off the hill into the mid
dle of the fray.

JIM LONBORG pitched Stanford to a 5-hit, 4-1 win against Cal,
Saturday. The Cards split a pair this weekend.
Stanford retained third place in the CM HA, as the Cards and Cal split a weekend baseball
series by the identical scores of 4-1
Cal won the Friday contest, breaking an eight-game Card win skein, and stopping the In
dian nine one short of tying the school record of nine straight wins.
Stanford started what they hope is a new win streak Saturday, behind Jim Lonborg's five-hit

pitching. The Golden Bears suf
fered from atrocious out fielding
over the two games. John Rehelo
could have pitched a no-hit game
for the Bears Friday but for a
misplay by left-fielder Terry
Heinrichs. Saturday, centerfielder
A1 Mindell misplayed Jack Al-

len’s towering 425-foot fly ball
into a run-scoring triple that
sparked a Card rally, putting
them ahead to stay, and knocked
Bear soph pitcher Dave Dowling
out of a possible win.
The Bears broke ahead early
in the second of the two contests,
scoring in the second on two
singles and a hit hatter, and it
appeared that one run would he
enough, as Dowling struck out
the first six men he faced, and
had a no-hitter into (lie fifth in
ning.
808 OVERMAN broke up that
nonsense with a single in that
inning, but died on base. Finally,
Stanford got, on the stick in the
sixth frame.
Greg Post walked and stole
second. With one out. Allen sent
a tremendous fly ball to deep
center field, but Mindell was
playing him deep and should have
had the ball.
Instead, he ran in circles and
finally made a leap at the ball.
He missed and Post scored, Allen
getting a triple, Jim Chenu plated
Allen with a single, all the scor
ing that Lonborg would need, as
it turned out. However, the Cards
got two insurance tallies, one in
the sixth, when Joel Shulman’s
double drove in Warren Newell,
and another in the seventh, as
Rich Ferrazzano singled O. J. So
lander across.
E O N 15 O R G FINISHED with
eight strikeouts, and walked only
one.
The Friday contest was a com
edy of errors, Cal making two,
and Stanford five. Darrell Suther
land gave up only four hits, but
three unearned tallies crossed the
plate and he lost 4-1. The Stan
ford run was Greg Post’s homer,
perhaps the shortest and weirdest
four-master in history.
The blow ruined Cal starter
Rebelo’s shut-out and no-hitter.
CAE WAS AHEAD 1-0 going
into the Stanford half of the sixth
inning when Post hit Rebelo’s
first pitch into short left field, a

twisting line drive that Heinrichs |
could have taken with a mini
mum of effort.
However he held back until the
last minute, when he charged the
ball and dove for it. He missed, j
and the ball rolled to the fence.
The fast Posl was at third by
the time Heinrichs picked up the
ball, but he ran into the base um
pire rounding the bag. The um
pire immediately waved him
across the plate on the interfer
ence. but it was unnecessary, as
the outfield relay went over the
catcher’s head.
The run tied it up. but Cal t
went ahead to stay in their half |
of the sixth. Mindell walked, stole |
second and continued to third on
catcher Overman’s throwing er- 1
ror. He scored on a sacrifice fly.
THEBE WAS ALMOST a riot
in the Saturday contest. Jim
Chenu was tagged out stealing
third and got tangled up with
Doug Burnett. Cal third-sacker.
They started pushing, but the
umpires had it broken up when

Cal relief pitcher Bill Oakley
charged off the hill into the mid
dle of the fray.

JIM LONBORG pitched Stanford to a 5-hit, 4-1 win against Cal,
Saturday. The Cards split a pair this weekend.
Stanford retained third place in the CM HA, as the Cards and Cal split a weekend baseball
series by the identical scores of 4-1
Cal won the Friday contest, breaking an eight-game Card win skein, and stopping the In
dian nine one short of tying the school record of nine straight wins.
Stanford started what they hope is a new win streak Saturday, behind Jim Lonborg's five-hit

pitching. The Golden Bears suf
fered from atrocious out fielding
over the two games. John Rehelo
could have pitched a no-hit game
for the Bears Friday but for a
misplay by left-fielder Terry
Heinrichs. Saturday, centerfielder
A1 Mindell misplayed Jack Al-

len’s towering 425-foot fly ball
into a run-scoring triple that
sparked a Card rally, putting
them ahead to stay, and knocked
Bear soph pitcher Dave Dowling
out of a possible win.
The Bears broke ahead early
in the second of the two contests,
scoring in the second on two
singles and a hit hatter, and it
appeared that one run would he
enough, as Dowling struck out
the first six men he faced, and
had a no-hitter into (lie fifth in
ning.
808 OVERMAN broke up that
nonsense with a single in that
inning, but died on base. Finally,
Stanford got, on the stick in the
sixth frame.
Greg Post walked and stole
second. With one out. Allen sent
a tremendous fly ball to deep
center field, but Mindell was
playing him deep and should have
had the ball.
Instead, he ran in circles and
finally made a leap at the ball.
He missed and Post scored, Allen
getting a triple, Jim Chenu plated
Allen with a single, all the scor
ing that Lonborg would need, as
it turned out. However, the Cards
got two insurance tallies, one in
the sixth, when Joel Shulman’s
double drove in Warren Newell,
and another in the seventh, as
Rich Ferrazzano singled O. J. So
lander across.
E O N 15 O R G FINISHED with
eight strikeouts, and walked only
one.
The Friday contest was a com
edy of errors, Cal making two,
and Stanford five. Darrell Suther
land gave up only four hits, but
three unearned tallies crossed the
plate and he lost 4-1. The Stan
ford run was Greg Post’s homer,
perhaps the shortest and weirdest
four-master in history.
The blow ruined Cal starter
Rebelo’s shut-out and no-hitter.
CAE WAS AHEAD 1-0 going
into the Stanford half of the sixth
inning when Post hit Rebelo’s
first pitch into short left field, a

twisting line drive that Heinrichs |
could have taken with a mini
mum of effort.
However he held back until the
last minute, when he charged the
ball and dove for it. He missed, j
and the ball rolled to the fence.
The fast Posl was at third by
the time Heinrichs picked up the
ball, but he ran into the base um
pire rounding the bag. The um
pire immediately waved him
across the plate on the interfer
ence. but it was unnecessary, as
the outfield relay went over the
catcher’s head.
The run tied it up. but Cal t
went ahead to stay in their half |
of the sixth. Mindell walked, stole |
second and continued to third on
catcher Overman’s throwing er- 1
ror. He scored on a sacrifice fly.
THEBE WAS ALMOST a riot
in the Saturday contest. Jim
Chenu was tagged out stealing
third and got tangled up with
Doug Burnett. Cal third-sacker.
They started pushing, but the
umpires had it broken up when

Cal relief pitcher Bill Oakley
charged off the hill into the mid
dle of the fray.

JIM LONBORG pitched Stanford to a 5-hit, 4-1 win against Cal,
Saturday. The Cards split a pair this weekend.
Stanford retained third place in the CM HA, as the Cards and Cal split a weekend baseball
series by the identical scores of 4-1
Cal won the Friday contest, breaking an eight-game Card win skein, and stopping the In
dian nine one short of tying the school record of nine straight wins.
Stanford started what they hope is a new win streak Saturday, behind Jim Lonborg's five-hit

pitching. The Golden Bears suf
fered from atrocious out fielding
over the two games. John Rehelo
could have pitched a no-hit game
for the Bears Friday but for a
misplay by left-fielder Terry
Heinrichs. Saturday, centerfielder
A1 Mindell misplayed Jack Al-

len’s towering 425-foot fly ball
into a run-scoring triple that
sparked a Card rally, putting
them ahead to stay, and knocked
Bear soph pitcher Dave Dowling
out of a possible win.
The Bears broke ahead early
in the second of the two contests,
scoring in the second on two
singles and a hit hatter, and it
appeared that one run would he
enough, as Dowling struck out
the first six men he faced, and
had a no-hitter into (lie fifth in
ning.
808 OVERMAN broke up that
nonsense with a single in that
inning, but died on base. Finally,
Stanford got, on the stick in the
sixth frame.
Greg Post walked and stole
second. With one out. Allen sent
a tremendous fly ball to deep
center field, but Mindell was
playing him deep and should have
had the ball.
Instead, he ran in circles and
finally made a leap at the ball.
He missed and Post scored, Allen
getting a triple, Jim Chenu plated
Allen with a single, all the scor
ing that Lonborg would need, as
it turned out. However, the Cards
got two insurance tallies, one in
the sixth, when Joel Shulman’s
double drove in Warren Newell,
and another in the seventh, as
Rich Ferrazzano singled O. J. So
lander across.
E O N 15 O R G FINISHED with
eight strikeouts, and walked only
one.
The Friday contest was a com
edy of errors, Cal making two,
and Stanford five. Darrell Suther
land gave up only four hits, but
three unearned tallies crossed the
plate and he lost 4-1. The Stan
ford run was Greg Post’s homer,
perhaps the shortest and weirdest
four-master in history.
The blow ruined Cal starter
Rebelo’s shut-out and no-hitter.
CAE WAS AHEAD 1-0 going
into the Stanford half of the sixth
inning when Post hit Rebelo’s
first pitch into short left field, a

twisting line drive that Heinrichs |
could have taken with a mini
mum of effort.
However he held back until the
last minute, when he charged the
ball and dove for it. He missed, j
and the ball rolled to the fence.
The fast Posl was at third by
the time Heinrichs picked up the
ball, but he ran into the base um
pire rounding the bag. The um
pire immediately waved him
across the plate on the interfer
ence. but it was unnecessary, as
the outfield relay went over the
catcher’s head.
The run tied it up. but Cal t
went ahead to stay in their half |
of the sixth. Mindell walked, stole |
second and continued to third on
catcher Overman’s throwing er- 1
ror. He scored on a sacrifice fly.
THEBE WAS ALMOST a riot
in the Saturday contest. Jim
Chenu was tagged out stealing
third and got tangled up with
Doug Burnett. Cal third-sacker.
They started pushing, but the
umpires had it broken up when

Cal relief pitcher Bill Oakley
charged off the hill into the mid
dle of the fray.
