# Stanford Men Debate Cal for Medaille Joffre
## 
### 
Three Stanford debaters will
compete with three Cal speakers
in the GBth annual debate for the
Medaille Joffre, tomorrow at 7:30
p.m. in Berkeleys’ Dwinelle Hall.
Larry Neal, Keith Winsell. and
Jim Woolsey will debate a spe
cific topic under the general head
ing of ‘‘Crisis in France.” They
will not know the exact topic un
til three hours before the debate
begins, when they will choose
sides and draw speaking posi
tions.
This speaking contest, the old
est continuous dual debate in the
country, began in 1894 when Bar
on Pierre de Coubertin first of
fered a solid gold medal, honoring
martyred French President Sadi
Carnot, to the winner of an an
nual forensic competition be
tween the two universities. In
1917 the name was changed to
Medaille Joffre, honoring the
great French war hero, Marshal
Joffre.
After sixty-seven years the rec
ord stands at 34 to 33 in favor of
the Stanford speakers, who have
won the last three years. Al
though the members of the Farm
team are all well versed on
French problems, “Cal is never
comfortable taking second place
in intellectual activities, and can
be counted upon to present a very
strong team,” according to Foren
sic Directir Dr. Jon Ericson.
There is a sign-up list on the
bulletin board outside Room 03
for those wishing rides to the de
bate.
