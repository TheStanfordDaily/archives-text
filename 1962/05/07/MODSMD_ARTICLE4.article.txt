# HEPL to Add Atomic Station
## 
### 
A new “end station” with three
loot-thick concrete walls and a
two-foot concrete roof where nu
clear tat gets can be bombarded
by billion-volt electrons will go
under construction this summer
on the Stanford campus.
The end station will be added
to the High Energy Physics Lab
oratory (HEPLt, one of the W.
W. Hansen Laboratories of Phys
ics. Augmenting the laboratory’s
present end station, the new fa
cility will ease crowding in the
experimental areas and greatly
increase the number of experi
ments that can bo in progress at
the same time.
Stanford physicists hope to
use the new end station by the
summer of 1963, although the sta
tion may not be fully equipped
for two years. A 1.5-billion-volt
spectrometer for meson studies
is among the items of new equip
ment to he built and installed.
The Office of Naval Research
will pay for most of the $650,000
project. The new end station will
ho located behind and to the right
of the present end station. Exist
ing tennis courts will he relocat
ed by the construction.
