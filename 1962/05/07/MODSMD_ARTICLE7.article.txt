(Editor’s Note: This is the first of two
articles acquainting the student body with
the new Tresidder Memorial Union.)

One of the newest and most exciting ad
ditions to Stanford University is the Tre
sidder Memorial Union opening in Septem
ber 1962. Located between Dinkelspiel Audi
torium and Bowman Alumni House, the now
Union will generally contain three kinds of
facilities: first, a new dining room and coffee
shop area; second, a wide variety of recre
ational and leisure accommodations; third,
offices and conference rooms. This Union,
one of the most unique and modern in the
country, promises to provide a framework
for new dimensions in university activities
at Stanford.
The front entrance across from the post
office opens into a largo dining room, which
will serve not only as an eat-dining place,
but also as an area for informal dancing and
other entertainment. Opening off from this
larger room are a small dining room con
sisting of booths and screened tables, and
three private dining rooms providing for
luncheon meetings and small parties.
These dining areas are served by a large

cafeteria comprised of a soda fountain, a
short order counter, a steam table, and two
self-service coffee bars. In front of the build
ing lies a tree-lined terrace, which offers an
atmosphere similar to an outdoor European
cafe. This area will accommodate 400 people.
ON THE BOWMAN House side of the
Union and adjacent to the dining area, a
spacious courtyard with a heated dance-floor
will accommodate street dances, Jolly-ups,
rallies, and Pre-Reg ranees. A small store,
the successor to the old Union Store, a bowl
ing alley, a billiard room, and a table tennis
room w ill all open onto this court. Connected
to the court is a lobby that will contain a
barber shop, a travel agency, a half-dozen
telephone booths, and a long informational
bulletin board.
A graceful spiral stairway connects this
lower lobby with the second floor lobby,
which will serve as the focal point of activity
in the now Union, The lobby will contain an
information desk and Box Office and offer
direct access to the second floor facilities.
A covered exterior corridor, lined with art
display cases, encircles the entire facilities
found on this level.
Walking along the corridor towards Din
kelspiel, one passes by a bridge and chess
room, five music listening rooms, and a
browsing room, which will contain national

and international newspapers and magazines
as well as books. Nearby is a service center,
offering a circulation library of the best
available framed art prints and a sizeable
tape and record collection that will furnish
music for the listening rooms.
ADJACENT TO THE corridor at the end
of the building facing Florence Moore Hall,
are the offices of the Associated Students,
and various executive offices for the per
manent Union Staff. Walking along the cor
ridor on the Bowman House side of the
building, one finds three conference rooms
and two large meeting rooms, both of which
are serviced by a motion picture projection
booth.
Near this area a large comfortable pro
gram lounge is expected to be used for dis
cussions, lectures, coffee hours, receptions,
forums, and debates. This lounge can be
divided by a folding partition into two small
er lounges, each containing a fireplace and
catering facilities.
This, then, is a brief description of what
will be found in the new union. The type of
activity that will fill this community center
is left to the initiative of the university
community itself. In our next article we will
present some of the programs that have al
ready been suggested and planned by in
terested groups.

the new Tresidder Memorial Union.)

One of the newest and most exciting ad
ditions to Stanford University is the Tre
sidder Memorial Union opening in Septem
ber 1962. Located between Dinkelspiel Audi
torium and Bowman Alumni House, the now
Union will generally contain three kinds of
facilities: first, a new dining room and coffee
shop area; second, a wide variety of recre
ational and leisure accommodations; third,
offices and conference rooms. This Union,
one of the most unique and modern in the
country, promises to provide a framework
for new dimensions in university activities
at Stanford.
The front entrance across from the post
office opens into a largo dining room, which
will serve not only as an eat-dining place,
but also as an area for informal dancing and
other entertainment. Opening off from this
larger room are a small dining room con
sisting of booths and screened tables, and
three private dining rooms providing for
luncheon meetings and small parties.
These dining areas are served by a large

cafeteria comprised of a soda fountain, a
short order counter, a steam table, and two
self-service coffee bars. In front of the build
ing lies a tree-lined terrace, which offers an
atmosphere similar to an outdoor European
cafe. This area will accommodate 400 people.
ON THE BOWMAN House side of the
Union and adjacent to the dining area, a
spacious courtyard with a heated dance-floor
will accommodate street dances, Jolly-ups,
rallies, and Pre-Reg ranees. A small store,
the successor to the old Union Store, a bowl
ing alley, a billiard room, and a table tennis
room w ill all open onto this court. Connected
to the court is a lobby that will contain a
barber shop, a travel agency, a half-dozen
telephone booths, and a long informational
bulletin board.
A graceful spiral stairway connects this
lower lobby with the second floor lobby,
which will serve as the focal point of activity
in the now Union, The lobby will contain an
information desk and Box Office and offer
direct access to the second floor facilities.
A covered exterior corridor, lined with art
display cases, encircles the entire facilities
found on this level.
Walking along the corridor towards Din
kelspiel, one passes by a bridge and chess
room, five music listening rooms, and a
browsing room, which will contain national

and international newspapers and magazines
as well as books. Nearby is a service center,
offering a circulation library of the best
available framed art prints and a sizeable
tape and record collection that will furnish
music for the listening rooms.
ADJACENT TO THE corridor at the end
of the building facing Florence Moore Hall,
are the offices of the Associated Students,
and various executive offices for the per
manent Union Staff. Walking along the cor
ridor on the Bowman House side of the
building, one finds three conference rooms
and two large meeting rooms, both of which
are serviced by a motion picture projection
booth.
Near this area a large comfortable pro
gram lounge is expected to be used for dis
cussions, lectures, coffee hours, receptions,
forums, and debates. This lounge can be
divided by a folding partition into two small
er lounges, each containing a fireplace and
catering facilities.
This, then, is a brief description of what
will be found in the new union. The type of
activity that will fill this community center
is left to the initiative of the university
community itself. In our next article we will
present some of the programs that have al
ready been suggested and planned by in
terested groups.
