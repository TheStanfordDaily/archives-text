# Communists Resume Attack; Capture Laotian Stronghold
## 
### 
VIENTIANE, Laos (UPI) —
Pro-Communist Laotian rebels at
tacking from the direction of the
Chinese Communist border two
miles away captured the govern
ment defense bastion of Nam Tha
yesterday under cover of a thun
derous artillery barrage, reliable
sources reported.

The reports from the front
said two assault columns crushed
the 5,000-man government garri
son and sent it retreating. A 12-
man U.S. military advisory group
fled by helicopter in the face of
one of the most intensive attacks
of the Laotian civil war.
NAM THA HAS been under
seige since late January. As the
Laotian government poured in re
inforcements it grew to have a
Dien Bien Phu-like prestige value.
It was at Dien Bien Phu in 1954
the Communist Vietnamese won
a culminating victory of their
war against France.
American military sources con
j firmed that the beleaguered Nam
I Tha garrison was hit with a
I “heavy attack’’ Sunday and that
j the 12 military advisers had
i flown out. But they had no im
fediate confirmation of the fall of
Nam Tha or that Chinese Com
munist troops were involved.
It was the second major Lao
tian defense bastion reported lap
tured within four days. Two bai
talions reported to include 1,000
Chinese overran Muong Sing,
seven miles from the Chinese
border and 20 miles northwest of
Nam Tha, on Thursday.
THE SUDDEN smash into Nam
Tha after weeks of siege raised
the specter that the royal Lao
tian army high command may
have been right in its frequent
claims that Laos is now under
invasion from Communist China.
Observers have ong known
that the town was only lightly
screened by the local military in
the northwestern direction be
cause it is almost impossible to
mount a large attack there ex
cept from the Chinese border or
from Muong Sing, reported over
run by Chinese and Laotians.

VIENTIANE, Laos (UPI) —
Pro-Communist Laotian rebels at
tacking from the direction of the
Chinese Communist border two
miles away captured the govern
ment defense bastion of Nam Tha
yesterday under cover of a thun
derous artillery barrage, reliable
sources reported.

The reports from the front
said two assault columns crushed
the 5,000-man government garri
son and sent it retreating. A 12-
man U.S. military advisory group
fled by helicopter in the face of
one of the most intensive attacks
of the Laotian civil war.
NAM THA HAS been under
seige since late January. As the
Laotian government poured in re
inforcements it grew to have a
Dien Bien Phu-like prestige value.
It was at Dien Bien Phu in 1954
the Communist Vietnamese won
a culminating victory of their
war against France.
American military sources con
j firmed that the beleaguered Nam
I Tha garrison was hit with a
I “heavy attack’’ Sunday and that
j the 12 military advisers had
i flown out. But they had no im
fediate confirmation of the fall of
Nam Tha or that Chinese Com
munist troops were involved.
It was the second major Lao
tian defense bastion reported lap
tured within four days. Two bai
talions reported to include 1,000
Chinese overran Muong Sing,
seven miles from the Chinese
border and 20 miles northwest of
Nam Tha, on Thursday.
THE SUDDEN smash into Nam
Tha after weeks of siege raised
the specter that the royal Lao
tian army high command may
have been right in its frequent
claims that Laos is now under
invasion from Communist China.
Observers have ong known
that the town was only lightly
screened by the local military in
the northwestern direction be
cause it is almost impossible to
mount a large attack there ex
cept from the Chinese border or
from Muong Sing, reported over
run by Chinese and Laotians.
