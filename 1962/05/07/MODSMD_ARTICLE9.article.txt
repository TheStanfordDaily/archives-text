“In the uncertainty of science
we need tools like the Linear Ac-1
celerator, but we also need an-1
other man like Newton,” said Dr.
Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, of
Stanford’s Project M Linear As
celerator, at a symposium open
ing a collection of Isaac Newton’s j
works Saturday afternoon.
Stanford Librarian Frederick j
E. Brasch has devoted the major
part of his life to gathering this
collection, on display in the Bon
der Room of the Main Library.
Brasch served as the Chief of the
Smithsonian Division of the Li-1
brary of Congress before coming |
1o Stanford.
The collection is devoted to the j
history of celestial mechanics and |
includes works which pertain to j
the life and work of Newton and j
men influencing him.
SHEETS OF NEWTON’S al
chemy notations are on display
with first editions of his “Prin
cipia” (16871 and “Opticks”
(1704). The rest of the collection

| is devoted to the works of men
from Archimedes to Einstein.
Also speaking at the symposi
um, Dr. Frederick O. Koenig, pro
fessor of chemistry, said we have
need of such a collection of the
history of science “for the sci
entist to help him become a man
j of the world, and for the non
i scientist to bring him into proper
relation to science.
“NEWTON WAS GREAT in
that he set an example. We pur
sue the vision; this vision New
ton created.”
Panofsky then told of the part
Stanford’s Linear Accelerator
project is able to play in the pur
suit of this vision. “Newton pro
duced unity in science,” he said.
“He unified the Jaws of planetary
motion and gravitation.
“The Stanford accelerator adds
to the knowledge of the forces
governing motion. We don’t know
if it is possible to learn more of
atoms at high level frequencies;
we hope to make this discovery
at Stanford.”

“The Stanford accelerator adds
to the knowledge of the forces
governing motion. We don’t know
if it is possible to learn more of
atoms at high level frequencies;
we hope to make this discovery
at Stanford.”
“In the uncertainty of science
we need tools like the Linear Ac-1
celerator, but we also need an-1
other man like Newton,” said Dr.
Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, of
Stanford’s Project M Linear As
celerator, at a symposium open
ing a collection of Isaac Newton’s j
works Saturday afternoon.
Stanford Librarian Frederick j
E. Brasch has devoted the major
part of his life to gathering this
collection, on display in the Bon
der Room of the Main Library.
Brasch served as the Chief of the
Smithsonian Division of the Li-1
brary of Congress before coming |
1o Stanford.
The collection is devoted to the j
history of celestial mechanics and |
includes works which pertain to j
the life and work of Newton and j
men influencing him.
SHEETS OF NEWTON’S al
chemy notations are on display
with first editions of his “Prin
cipia” (16871 and “Opticks”
(1704). The rest of the collection

| is devoted to the works of men
from Archimedes to Einstein.
Also speaking at the symposi
um, Dr. Frederick O. Koenig, pro
fessor of chemistry, said we have
need of such a collection of the
history of science “for the sci
entist to help him become a man
j of the world, and for the non
i scientist to bring him into proper
relation to science.
“NEWTON WAS GREAT in
that he set an example. We pur
sue the vision; this vision New
ton created.”
Panofsky then told of the part
Stanford’s Linear Accelerator
project is able to play in the pur
suit of this vision. “Newton pro
duced unity in science,” he said.
“He unified the Jaws of planetary
motion and gravitation.
“The Stanford accelerator adds
to the knowledge of the forces
governing motion. We don’t know
if it is possible to learn more of
atoms at high level frequencies;
we hope to make this discovery
at Stanford.”
