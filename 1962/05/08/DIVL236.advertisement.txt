will not protect you
from fallout. Nothing can really
protect you from fallout, This is not a
fallout shelter. It is a human shelter.
It protects people from the heat of
the sun, from rain, wind and cold. Put
love into it and it becomes a home.
Hundreds of millions of families do not have such
human shelters. While we talk about dinning holes to
protect ourselves against a catastrophe that may
never come (and against which there is no defense
anyway), they are without protection against the
elements—now, today, this minute.
The only real protection against nuclear war is peace
and peace mast be for the whole world, not for us
alone. We will not contribute to peace by building
fallout shelters, but only to increased hostility, suspi
cion and a speeded-up arms race. We would contribute
to peace by diverting the money such shelters would
cost to the job of helping to build homes for those
who need them-in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America.
If the thought of men and women crawling into caves
has revolted you, consider joining in registering your
protest in this positive, peace-building way.
Send the dollars a shelter would cost you to
SHELTERS FOR THE SHELTERLESS. Any
amount will help. Through its distinguished sponsors
these funds will go to United Nations and other self
help housing programs in many sections of the globe.
Demonstrate to the world the concern that millions
of Americans feel for those whose lives are oppressed
by poverty and helplessness. Give—give generoasly—
to Peace.
SHELTERS FOR THE SHELTERLESS is a pro
gram of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an inter
faith religious peace organization founded in 1915.

will not protect you
from fallout. Nothing can really
protect you from fallout, This is not a
fallout shelter. It is a human shelter.
It protects people from the heat of
the sun, from rain, wind and cold. Put
love into it and it becomes a home.
Hundreds of millions of families do not have such
human shelters. While we talk about dinning holes to
protect ourselves against a catastrophe that may
never come (and against which there is no defense
anyway), they are without protection against the
elements—now, today, this minute.
The only real protection against nuclear war is peace
and peace mast be for the whole world, not for us
alone. We will not contribute to peace by building
fallout shelters, but only to increased hostility, suspi
cion and a speeded-up arms race. We would contribute
to peace by diverting the money such shelters would
cost to the job of helping to build homes for those
who need them-in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America.
If the thought of men and women crawling into caves
has revolted you, consider joining in registering your
protest in this positive, peace-building way.
Send the dollars a shelter would cost you to
SHELTERS FOR THE SHELTERLESS. Any
amount will help. Through its distinguished sponsors
these funds will go to United Nations and other self
help housing programs in many sections of the globe.
Demonstrate to the world the concern that millions
of Americans feel for those whose lives are oppressed
by poverty and helplessness. Give—give generoasly—
to Peace.
SHELTERS FOR THE SHELTERLESS is a pro
gram of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an inter
faith religious peace organization founded in 1915.
