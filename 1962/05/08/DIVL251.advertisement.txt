Keds "Court King
for tennis and
all casual wear
Keds taper-toe
Champion® in new,
breezy hopsacking
Nobody’s really suggesting romance will be yours if you wear
U.S. Keds.But it is true that Keds are the best-fitting, the most
comfortable, good-looking and long-wearing fabric casuals you
can buy. Because Keds are made with costlier fabrics. With an
exclusive shockproofed arch cushion and cushioned innersole.
In short, with all those "extras” that make them your best buy
in the long run. Head for your nearest Keds dealer. Get that
Keds look, that Keds fit... GET THAT GREAT KEDS FEELING!
