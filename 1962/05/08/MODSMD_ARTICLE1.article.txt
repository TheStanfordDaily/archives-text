# Scotty Thompson Wins HR President Race
## 
### KICK BARRETT 
Scotty Thompson yesterday
afternoon was elected head of the
Institute of International Rela
tions by the HR Executive Board.
Ten minutes was alloted
Thompson and his opponent
George Corfino to state their
views and when the candidates
left the Bowman Alumni House
a heated hour-long debate was
conducted.

Controversy revolved around
Thompson’s recent notoriety in
the pages of The Daily and the
future of the HR itself; whether
the HR should maintain and ex
pand its present position “Vis a
Vis” the campus or whether it
should take a bold new position
as a campus organization.
“UNDER THE leadership of
Joel Meister,” stated Thompson
when interviewed by this report
er, “the HR has developed into
the strongest organization of its

kind in the country. The HR is
ready to offer the student body
a significant challenge in enlist
ing objective concern for inter
national issues. Nothing could be
more desperately needed among
students in 1962 than such con
cern and the HR is the right or
ganization, at the right time, in
the right place to do this.”

The main change in the HR
format will he to develop a single
theme for those speakers, semi
nars and programs sponsored
each quarter. All aspects of the
HR will be devoted to the explor
ation of a single theme. It is
hoped that by such a program the
Stanford student will become ac
quainted with much about one
subject rather than a little bit
about a great deal of subjects.
THE ROLE OF the foreign stu
dent will also enter the province
of the HR as it will seek to in
crease the number of these stu
dents living in on-campus living
groups. It is hoped that the re
sulting financial difficulties could
be resolved with the student pay
ing one-third, the living groups
themselves paying one-third and
the balance paid by the Univer
sity.

Thompson, a junior in History
Honors, has served as past presi
dent of the Political Union. 1960-
61, and as a member of student
legislature, 1959-60.
When pressed lor further com
ment on the future of the HR as
he sees it Thompson stated, “Hav
ing been elected as president of
the HR I intend to work to the
utmost of my capacity to develop
its internal cohesiveness and its
external effectiveness, but such
will necessitate the support and
enthusiasm of the student body.
“The organization,” he contin
ued, “needs a vital and exciting
atmosphere that can further es
tablish the complete support of
Ihe student body. This will take
a great personal effort on my
part and will depend on the will
ing support of my colleagues.
There is a definite vacuum at
Stanford that only the HR can
fulfill.”

HR will be devoted to the explor
ation of a single theme. It is
hoped that by such a program the
Stanford student will become ac
quainted with much about one
subject rather than a little bit
about a great deal of subjects.
THE ROLE OF the foreign stu
dent will also enter the province
of the HR as it will seek to in
crease the number of these stu
dents living in on-campus living
groups. It is hoped that the re
sulting financial difficulties could
be resolved with the student pay
ing one-third, the living groups
themselves paying one-third and
the balance paid by the Univer
sity.

Thompson, a junior in History
Honors, has served as past presi
dent of the Political Union. 1960-
61, and as a member of student
legislature, 1959-60.
When pressed lor further com
ment on the future of the HR as
he sees it Thompson stated, “Hav
ing been elected as president of
the HR I intend to work to the
utmost of my capacity to develop
its internal cohesiveness and its
external effectiveness, but such
will necessitate the support and
enthusiasm of the student body.
“The organization,” he contin
ued, “needs a vital and exciting
atmosphere that can further es
tablish the complete support of
Ihe student body. This will take
a great personal effort on my
part and will depend on the will
ing support of my colleagues.
There is a definite vacuum at
Stanford that only the HR can
fulfill.”

New HR President
Scotty Thompson yesterday
afternoon was elected head of the
Institute of International Rela
tions by the HR Executive Board.
Ten minutes was alloted
Thompson and his opponent
George Corfino to state their
views and when the candidates
left the Bowman Alumni House
a heated hour-long debate was
conducted.

Controversy revolved around
Thompson’s recent notoriety in
the pages of The Daily and the
future of the HR itself; whether
the HR should maintain and ex
pand its present position “Vis a
Vis” the campus or whether it
should take a bold new position
as a campus organization.
“UNDER THE leadership of
Joel Meister,” stated Thompson
when interviewed by this report
er, “the HR has developed into
the strongest organization of its

kind in the country. The HR is
ready to offer the student body
a significant challenge in enlist
ing objective concern for inter
national issues. Nothing could be
more desperately needed among
students in 1962 than such con
cern and the HR is the right or
ganization, at the right time, in
the right place to do this.”

The main change in the HR
format will he to develop a single
theme for those speakers, semi
nars and programs sponsored
each quarter. All aspects of the
HR will be devoted to the explor
ation of a single theme. It is
hoped that by such a program the
Stanford student will become ac
quainted with much about one
subject rather than a little bit
