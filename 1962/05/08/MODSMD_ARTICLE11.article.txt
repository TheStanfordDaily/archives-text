# Membership in Lost Cause Club Gaining Strength
## 
### SKINNER 
The last time I appeared in
this, the Peninsula’s Only Mourn
ing Newspaper, I proposed a plan
to utilize (he generous supply of
accumulated bat guano on Hoover
Tower to enrich and fill Stan
ford’s bottomless coffers. The
plan, by the way, was to fill the
coffers with money received from
the sale of bat guano. NOT, as
the suggestion has been misinter
preted, to fill them with hat gua
no.

The failure of that worthy
cause has made me, I believe, a
member in good standing of the
Stanford branch of the club of
lost causes. The full name of this
club is Causes Rejected A Priori,
but it is better known by its in
itials which form a particularly
striking acronymn.

In the words of the club's state
ment of policy, membership is
limited to those “who have sup
ported any cause, which, by its
very nature tends to annoy (he
authoritative people who have
the power to make the cause a
reality because said cause seems
to be suspiciously logical and
right.”

Because of tho irksome quality
of the cause, the people in power
make no effort to publicly deny
or reject the cause, as their re
jection is based on illogical and
illusory grounds. It is this quali
ty of tacit, yet final rejection
which distinguishes the true lost
cause.

The Stanford branch of this
club is formed of many people
with many different lost causes,
as opposed to the Berkeley
branch, which is made up pri
marily of those who would like

to abolish compulsory ROTC. It
must be noted that the Berkeley
branch has been on shaky ground
ever since the withdrawal of a
large block of members who sup
ported Meisenbaeh’s fight against
the HU AC.

The Stanford branch, however,
has increased in the past year.
Consider, if you will, the tremen
dous growth spurred by the
scores of bitterly eager member
ships brought on by the co-ed
housing hassle. A smaller group
joined after their wide-eyed, ideal
istic support of the A Phi O’s sug
gestion to keep the campus clean
year-rouhd.

The most quiet, disillusioned
group is made up of those who
supported Dean Allen’s cam
paign to make Stanford women
both smart and lovable. And
more and more students join
every day with the spread of the
black rumor that the administra
tion has decided that the uproar
over off-campus housing for wom
en must mean that the women
want dormitories in Palo Alto.

The greatest thing that has
ever happened to the club prom
ises to be the inevitable member
ship growth due to the liquor
amendment. Then the club will
have power! Plans are now under
way to bring speakers to the cam
pus: prominent lost causers such
as Bertrand Russell, Linus Pau
ling. Eddie Fisher. Perhaps a
publication wall appear, entitled
“The Daily Dumped-All-Over,” a
newspaper dedicated to proving
the old adage: “They said it
couldn't be done, and they weren’t
kidding.” Lost causers of the
world unite—the time has come
for us to wriggle our collective
“trod-upon” toes!
