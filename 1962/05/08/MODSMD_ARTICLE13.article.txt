Whether the display on South
Africa in the lobby of the Stan
ford Library is intended to be in
formative, as one would expect to
find in a university library, or as
propaganda pure and simple. I do
not know. Whatever the case may
be, there are a few facts that need
to be pointed out.
One whole section of the dis
play is devoted to housing con
ditions for the Bantu “in the seg
regated ‘locations’ around Jo
hannesburg.’’ As far as I could
make out, all the photos were
taken in Sophiatown.
It so happens that Sophiatown
was one of the worst slums that
had grown near Johannesburg as
a result of the massive influx of
work-seekers to the industrial
cities after World War 11. These
slums have been all but cleared
up and substituted for by an ener
getic housing programme start
ed by the present South Africa
government in 1951, through
which by 1961,1,200,000 Bantu had
been provided with new housing.
I suspect that the photos in the
library display are more than
just a few years old, but admit
tedly such scenes can still be
found in a few scattered places.
To caption them as “average
housing conditions” in the loca
tions reveals, however, either ig
norance or the intention to mis
lead deliberately.
Similarly, the photos of the

undernourished child and the sick
woman are misleading in that
they suggest that this is typical,
and that nothing is being done by
the government in the way of
medical facilities for the Bantu.
This is in sharp contrast to the
fact that medical services are pro
vided on a scale to my knowledge
unequalled in Africa, at a nomi
nal fee which is waived if the pa
tient cannot pay it. Again it is
true that shortages have not yet
been overcome completely but
this is a very different proposi
tion from suggesting that no ef
fort is being made. The same ar
gument applies to some of the
other photos depicting social
conditions.
The photo of the “Farm Boss”
puzzled me. If it is intended to
convey the impression that the
whip carried by the (black) man
on horseback was meant for use
on the worker on foot, it would
have been better to state so ex
plicitly since less vindictive view
ers might conclude that it was
meant for the oxen!
It is not my intention to sug
gest that material improvement
can substitute for political ad
vance, but I do find it deplorable
that people who profess noble
ideals do not live up those ideals
in the methods they employ. It
may be asking too much to expect
these people to give credit where
it is due, but one would at least
expect that the truth be held in
violate.

regated ‘locations’ around Jo
hannesburg.’’ As far as I could
make out, all the photos were
taken in Sophiatown.
It so happens that Sophiatown
was one of the worst slums that
had grown near Johannesburg as
a result of the massive influx of
work-seekers to the industrial
cities after World War 11. These
slums have been all but cleared
up and substituted for by an ener
getic housing programme start
ed by the present South Africa
government in 1951, through
which by 1961,1,200,000 Bantu had
been provided with new housing.
I suspect that the photos in the
library display are more than
just a few years old, but admit
tedly such scenes can still be
found in a few scattered places.
To caption them as “average
housing conditions” in the loca
tions reveals, however, either ig
norance or the intention to mis
lead deliberately.
Similarly, the photos of the

undernourished child and the sick
woman are misleading in that
they suggest that this is typical,
and that nothing is being done by
the government in the way of
medical facilities for the Bantu.
This is in sharp contrast to the
fact that medical services are pro
vided on a scale to my knowledge
unequalled in Africa, at a nomi
nal fee which is waived if the pa
tient cannot pay it. Again it is
true that shortages have not yet
been overcome completely but
this is a very different proposi
tion from suggesting that no ef
fort is being made. The same ar
gument applies to some of the
other photos depicting social
conditions.
The photo of the “Farm Boss”
puzzled me. If it is intended to
convey the impression that the
whip carried by the (black) man
on horseback was meant for use
on the worker on foot, it would
have been better to state so ex
plicitly since less vindictive view
ers might conclude that it was
meant for the oxen!
It is not my intention to sug
gest that material improvement
can substitute for political ad
vance, but I do find it deplorable
that people who profess noble
ideals do not live up those ideals
in the methods they employ. It
may be asking too much to expect
these people to give credit where
it is due, but one would at least
expect that the truth be held in
violate.

Whether the display on South
Africa in the lobby of the Stan

formative, as one would expect to
find in a university library, or as
propaganda pure and simple. I do
not know. Whatever the case may
be, there are a few facts that need
to be pointed out.

play is devoted to housing con
