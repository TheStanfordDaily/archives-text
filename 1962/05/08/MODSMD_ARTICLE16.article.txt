INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
Editor, The Daily:
We think that it is fine that so
many Stanford students are in
terested in going to the Helsinki
Youth Festival this summer to
meet international students and
share ideas wilh them in hopes of
a better mutual understanding.
However we would like to re
mind these students who have
shown such a sudden interest
that there are approximately 600
international students on this
campus who are quite curious as
to what we are all about.
For 10 cents and 10 minutes to
the Cellar, (which is within walk
ing distance) our desires and
their curiosity may be satisfied
as they never have been before.

PUZZLED
Editor, The Daily:
I was puzzled but impressed by
Paul Bay’s statement that he does
not know our President-elect, for
this is truly an indication of Mr.
Rosencranz’s popularity. But I
was even more puzzled by the
rest of the letter, which attacked
the pettiness and pomposity of

Boh Sayler’s comments Friday.
Bay’s letter is a monument to
both. A bit ironic.
Winston Churchill once said
about his political opponent, “An
empty car drove up, and out
stepped Ramsey Mac Donald.” I
think Sayler has made a good
point—one that comes from a per
son who has devoted a year to
student government in an effort
to improve it. His record is not

without failures, but it is cer
tainly an injustice to compare his
with the vacuous records of his
predecessors.
Sayler's Friday statement was
unequivocal and far from petty.
He called Rosencranz a fraud.
Many of us, both supporters and
detractors, are anxious that Mr.
Rosencranz, himself, answer the
charge.
