# STILL UNDEFEATED
## Golfers Crush Trojans, UCLA 
### 
Pete Clioato led Stanford’s un
defeated golf team lo a pair of
weekend wins over USC and
UCLA.
The Cards beat UCLA 44-10,
and USC 30-24.
Choate was medalist in both
matches, shooting a 71 Saturday
against the Bruins, and 71 against
USC Friday.
The wins left Stanford 3-0 in
Big Five competition, with the
only roadblock to an undefeated
conference record being the weak

Cal Bears. Stanford meets the
Bears next Friday. The Indians
won’t meet strong Washington
until the Big Five Golf Tourna
ment May 18-19.
Saturday, Stanford walloped the
ißruins, behind (he determined
onslaught of amazingly balanced
scoring. After Choate’s 71, which
edged Cliff Davis, who also shot
71, came five 75’s. Bill Parish,
Kim Corbin, Jerry Hanweck,
Ralph Marron and Jeff Johnson
all hit that score. This is all the

more amazing because Stanford
had never played this course be
fore, and in fact had never even
seen it until the match.
The Friday win over Southern
Cal was the first defeat USC suf
fered on its home course in seven
years. Stanford had seen the Wil
shire Country Club once, playing
there the flay before the match.
Choate’s 72 led Stanford, fol
lowed closely by the 73's of Mar
ron and Hanweek. Parish and
Johnson both had 7G, while Cor
bin brought up the rear with 80.
Stanford has clearly brought it
self to the ranks of the contend
ers for the NCAA title to be held
from June 18-23 on the Duke Uni
versity course.
