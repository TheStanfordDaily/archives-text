# SU Receives Schooner For 'Floating Classroom'
## 
### 
Under a long-term charter
agreement Hopkins Marino Sta
tion of Stanford University will
acquire the Schooner Tc Vega
for use as a “floating classroom”
in marine biology and oceanog
raphy, according to Dean Albert
H. Bowker of the Graduate Divi
sion.
National Science Foundation
grants will cover conversion and
outfitting of the 135-foot auxili
ary schooner as well as her oper
ation on a year-round schedule of
research and graduate training.
AN INITIAL grant of $462,945
was authorized by the foundation
a year ago when it was planned
to use the sailing yacht Pioneer
in the graduate training-research
program. The owner of the Pio
neer died before negotiations
completed.
Te Vega is owned by the Li
berian Pacific Navigation Co. She
carries 12,000 feet of sail and ac

commodates 30 people including
the crew.
Three 11-week cruises in Pa
cific waters are planned each
year, roughly corresponding to
academic quarters at the Univer
sity. About three week will bo
allowed between voyages, with
longer periods for overhaul.
HOMK PORT will be Monterey,
adjacent to the ocean-front town
of Pacific Grove whore Hopkins
Marine Station is located.
Prof. Rolf Bolin, assistant di
rector of the marine station, will
head the program as chief sci
entist. A veteran of previous sci
entific expeditions aboard various
other research vessels, he hopes
to get the first Stanford expedi
tion underway by next January.
Three senior scientists serving
as faculty members plus 12 jun
ior scientists (students) will man
the ship in addition to a crew of
15. The scientists will be recruit
ed from institutions throughout
the country.

Under direction of the senior
scientists students wall assist in
handling the various typos of
gear, keeping a biological log,
sorting and cataloging the collec
tions, and making oceanographic
observations. Lectures will sup
plement the daily laboratory
work.

Among the studies planned arc
investigations of the luminescence
of many deep-sea creatures and
its role in their lives, of fish mi
grations, of oceanic food chains,
and of the biological economy of
the deep-sea environment. The re
sulting collections and data will
be made available for study by
scientists throughout the world.


TE VEGA, a new "classroom'' for Hopkins Marine Station, will be taken over by Stanford in July.

National Science Foundation
grants will cover conversion and
outfitting of the 135-foot auxili
ary schooner as well as her oper
ation on a year-round schedule of
research and graduate training.
AN INITIAL grant of $462,945
was authorized by the foundation
a year ago when it was planned
to use the sailing yacht Pioneer
in the graduate training-research
program. The owner of the Pio
neer died before negotiations
completed.
Te Vega is owned by the Li
berian Pacific Navigation Co. She
carries 12,000 feet of sail and ac

commodates 30 people including
the crew.
Three 11-week cruises in Pa
cific waters are planned each
year, roughly corresponding to
academic quarters at the Univer
sity. About three week will bo
allowed between voyages, with
longer periods for overhaul.
HOMK PORT will be Monterey,
adjacent to the ocean-front town
of Pacific Grove whore Hopkins
Marine Station is located.
Prof. Rolf Bolin, assistant di
rector of the marine station, will
head the program as chief sci
entist. A veteran of previous sci
entific expeditions aboard various
other research vessels, he hopes
to get the first Stanford expedi
tion underway by next January.
Three senior scientists serving
as faculty members plus 12 jun
ior scientists (students) will man
the ship in addition to a crew of
15. The scientists will be recruit
ed from institutions throughout
the country.

Under direction of the senior
scientists students wall assist in
handling the various typos of
gear, keeping a biological log,
sorting and cataloging the collec
tions, and making oceanographic
observations. Lectures will sup
plement the daily laboratory
work.

Among the studies planned arc
investigations of the luminescence
of many deep-sea creatures and
its role in their lives, of fish mi
grations, of oceanic food chains,
and of the biological economy of
the deep-sea environment. The re
sulting collections and data will
be made available for study by
scientists throughout the world.


TE VEGA, a new "classroom'' for Hopkins Marine Station, will be taken over by Stanford in July.
Under a long-term charter
agreement Hopkins Marino Sta
tion of Stanford University will
acquire the Schooner Tc Vega
for use as a “floating classroom”
in marine biology and oceanog
raphy, according to Dean Albert
