# Wolfe Denounces Role of Marxism As Political Failure
## 
### IRENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
Former communist, former
state department official, histori
an of note, Bertram Wolfe, pre
sented an academic denounce
ment of the role of Marxism to
a Cubborley audience yesterday.
“The workingman has refused
to become more miserable . . .
the assignment Marx gave to him
. . . the proletarian has not been
able to stomach ‘becoming naught
in order to become all’ (in the
words of the Internationale), an
alyzed Wolfe, author of the well
known “Three Who Made a Revo
lution.”
“THE SECRET OF Marxism’s
ability to survive the shipwreck
of all the prophecies of Marx,”
feels Wolfe, lies in the “dual na
ture of Marxism . . . offers it
self as a science and as a re
ligion. When pressed, (current
day Marxists) will one at a time
discard all of the prophecies that
came from Marx’s method, and
just kep the method . . . which
has so far always been wrong.”
Of the second facet of Marx
ism’s nature, the analyst notes,
“It is an ‘ism.’ . . . When faith
is passionately hold, it can’t be
shaken . . . righteousness, the
assurance of prophecy. It gives a
new hope of the apocalypse . . .
a new millenial kingdom. History
was to be given a new meaning, a
new end in time.
“There is this dual nature in
Marxism. The Marxists of today
loan now more heavily on one,
now more heavily on the other.
Since Marx is a vast and cloudy
writer, there is a Marx for every
circle one approaches.
“MANY MARXISTS have gone
all the way back to Marx’s early
notebooks, of which Marx made
so much fun . . . this is what the
Eric Fromm’s do . . . they pick
out passages, hold them up: ‘This
is my Marx, the true Marx.’
"They try to explain how the
theory is sound at the bottom,
the irregularities ... a prank of
history.
“Complications came: state in
tervention, the influence of or
ganized groups . . . Reality has
departed farther and farther
from the autonomous operation
of economic law's . . . The new
synthesis of economy has noth
ing to do with the economics of
Adam Smith, Ricardo, and even
less to do with Karl Marx. To
day it has no relevance to soci

ety.”
Wolfe sees fallacies and con
tradictions within Marx in deal
ing with nationalism, the break
down of capitalism, and imper ial
ism. “The most important part
of the Communist Manifesto was
the proclamation of the imminent
end of nationalism. On the eve of
its writing (1848), came the big
gest wave of nationalism to hit
Europe. Within two months,
Marx and Engels wrote, demand
ing patriotism . . . his paper be
came the most warlike in Europe.
“THESE THOUGHTS war
with Russia and the struggle for
the unification of Germany
dominate their letters (Marx and
Engels’). n the words of one to
the other,’ . . . Bismark did our
work for us.’
“In the last few years of his
life, Marx changed his mind about
war.” According to Wolfe, Marx
feared a Franco-Russian alliance
which would lead to a “people’s
war,” feared all people would de
fend their own country loading
to the downfall of the socialist
movement.
“The orthodox may take this
as showing Marx was not a dog
matist, but a scientist. However,
now that Marx and Engels have
died, they are unwilling to change
anything they said . . . and will
not let a revisionist among them.”
WOLFE, WHOM Prof. Milorad
Drachovitch introduced as “not
only a political revolutionary, but
a brilliant and dispassionate his
torian, sees much attributed to
Marx that should not be. “I have
searched his writings and found
the word ‘imperialism’ only once
(he spoke of the East India Com
pany as bringing ‘the only possi
bility for social revolution.’)
“When on American campuses
one hears of the Marxist view of
the state ... of the party . . .
of imperialism, one almost al
ways hears the Leninist view
... in many cases diametrically
opposed to Marx’s.

“The workingman has refused

able to stomach ‘becoming naught

words of the Internationale), an
alyzed Wolfe, author of the well
known “Three Who Made a Revo
lution.”
“THE SECRET OF Marxism’s
ability to survive the shipwreck
of all the prophecies of Marx,”
feels Wolfe, lies in the “dual na
ture of Marxism . . . offers it
self as a science and as a re
ligion. When pressed, (current
day Marxists) will one at a time
discard all of the prophecies that
came from Marx’s method, and
just kep the method . . . which
has so far always been wrong.”
Of the second facet of Marx
ism’s nature, the analyst notes,
“It is an ‘ism.’ . . . When faith
is passionately hold, it can’t be
shaken . . . righteousness, the
assurance of prophecy. It gives a
new hope of the apocalypse . . .
a new millenial kingdom. History
was to be given a new meaning, a
new end in time.
“There is this dual nature in
Marxism. The Marxists of today
loan now more heavily on one,
now more heavily on the other.
Since Marx is a vast and cloudy
writer, there is a Marx for every
circle one approaches.
“MANY MARXISTS have gone
all the way back to Marx’s early
notebooks, of which Marx made
so much fun . . . this is what the
Eric Fromm’s do . . . they pick
out passages, hold them up: ‘This
is my Marx, the true Marx.’
"They try to explain how the
theory is sound at the bottom,
the irregularities ... a prank of
history.
“Complications came: state in
tervention, the influence of or
ganized groups . . . Reality has
departed farther and farther
from the autonomous operation
of economic law's . . . The new
synthesis of economy has noth
ing to do with the economics of
Adam Smith, Ricardo, and even
less to do with Karl Marx. To
day it has no relevance to soci

ety.”
Wolfe sees fallacies and con
tradictions within Marx in deal
ing with nationalism, the break
down of capitalism, and imper ial
ism. “The most important part
of the Communist Manifesto was
the proclamation of the imminent
end of nationalism. On the eve of
its writing (1848), came the big
gest wave of nationalism to hit
Europe. Within two months,
Marx and Engels wrote, demand
ing patriotism . . . his paper be
came the most warlike in Europe.
“THESE THOUGHTS war
with Russia and the struggle for
the unification of Germany
dominate their letters (Marx and
Engels’). n the words of one to
the other,’ . . . Bismark did our
work for us.’
“In the last few years of his
life, Marx changed his mind about
war.” According to Wolfe, Marx
feared a Franco-Russian alliance
which would lead to a “people’s
war,” feared all people would de
fend their own country loading
to the downfall of the socialist
movement.
“The orthodox may take this
as showing Marx was not a dog
matist, but a scientist. However,
now that Marx and Engels have
died, they are unwilling to change
anything they said . . . and will
not let a revisionist among them.”
