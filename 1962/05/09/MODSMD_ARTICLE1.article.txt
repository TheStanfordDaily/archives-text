Barbara’s only newspaper, the')
News-Press.
The California editor wrote the
first of his editorials early last
year when most of the country
was unaware of the Society’s ex
istence. In giving Storke the
award for editorial writing, the
prize committee praised him for
“calling public attention to the
efforts of the semi-secret John
Birch Society to wage a cam
paign of hate and vilification in
Santa Barbara.”
Storke finished out the U.S.
Senator term of William McAdoo
in 1936 when McAdoo resigned.
He was on the California State
Crime Commission and was ap
pointed UC Regent in 1955 by
Governor Knight.
ALUMNUS STORKE is the

jor while at Stanford. He gradu
ated in the class of 1898. He was
on the Alumni Advisory Council
in 1944 and was the agent for his
class in 1960.
When contacted by the Chron
icle in Santa Barbara Storke said
of the Award, “What I and the
Santa Barbara News-Press did
is only what any good Ameri
can newspaper would have done
under the same circumstances.

. . . It is the duty of our citizens
and the newspapers to insist that
our political give-and-take be car
ried on in the open, with honor
and integrity.”
IN' THE VASSAR Alumnae
Magazine of April 1962 Storke
wrote an article entitled "Danger
ous Extremes” in which he said,
“The Birch Society, the Minute
men, the anti-communist ‘cru
sades’ are rather absurd manifes
tations at present, as were the
various Nazi nationalist, royalist
and super-patriot groups in Ger
many in the Twenties. But the
climate in Germany was right for
drastic change, and there was a
hunger to find scapegoats on
which to blame all the difficulties
of life.”
Last fall Storke w 7 as awarded
the 1961 Lauterbach Aw'ard of the
Nieman Foundation of Harvard
for his defense of civil liberties
and specifically for his paper’s
expose of the activities of the
John Birch Society in Santa Bar
