# Old Vic's Saint Joan' Has Vitality and Color
## 
### 
G. B. Shaw is primarily a writer
of problem plays. His largest con
cern is usually with the problem,
and he uses the characters and
the stage to push around his
ideas.
But in “Saint Joan,” which
Shaw considers his best play, the
players rarely sit around and
wait for the ideas. They are in
tegral. The characters live and
breathe the ideas, and in spite of
standing for something, they
have an existence of their own.
THE OLD Vic production of the
play, which opened Monday night
at the Geary Theater in San Fran
cisco, maximizes the vitality in
herent in the characters. The
whole production is startlingly
alive, in fact. It is rich and color
ful in its staging. It moves and
builds, letting up only briefly in
the second scene of the second
act when Shaw chooses to in
trude to make the philosophical
and practical problems which
Joan presented to church and
state absolutely clear.
The Old Vic Company shows to
its best advantage what can he ob
tained by repertory work. The
production all fits together. It
has been beautifully rehearsed;
the actors know each other, the
stage and the play intimately.
One is not aware that they are
acting; the gestures and the
speech belong to the characters.
And they work with the music,
the sets and the lighting to create
an entirely organic piece.
BARBARA JEFFOBD, who
plays Joan, the maid, is a sur
prise. In spite of Joan’s naivete,
her boyish dress and her intense
childlike faith in her “voices” (“I
have a message for thee from
God”), as played by Miss Jefford
she emerges a woman.
She is a large woman with a
low, strong voice, who moves
about the stage with grace and
confidence. The Joan who lives
with soldiers, who dreams of
leading a charge and placing the
big guns and who tells the king
and archbishop what to do, be
comes entirely believable.
The 17-year-old girl, afraid of

fire at her trial, or deserted by
all her friends in the epilogue
(the messenger from the Pope
says, “I must return to Rome for
further instructions”) retains
every bit of her stature.
JOHN CLEMENTS as the Earl
of Warwick does on outstanding
job as the representative of the
peers threatened by (he new na
tionalism that the Maid is creat
ing. He speaks with great authori
ty when he says “Aristocrats will
call no man master.” One is
aware that he is The Peer because
he is such a strong man, but one
is more aware that he is Warwick
who cannot watch the burning be
cause of its dreadfulness.
The Inquisitor, George Howe,
is convincingly righteous. To him,
an inquisition is essentially merci
ful; “there is nothing so cruel as
the toleration of heresy.” He deals
with Joan as a human being; he
pleads with her as the child Joan,
conveying his tremendous sin
cerity.
Next to him and set beside
Warwick, Andre Van Gyseghem’s
Bishop of Beauvais is too soft
spoken, too unable to see beyond
himself. His great concern for
Joan’s soul does not ring true.
DUNOIS, Bastard of Orleans,
played by William Sylvester, is a
loving, brother-like friend to
Joan. His spoofing and gentle
correction in the scene at the
Loire—and his ultimate frank
ness- are extremely moving.
The first act, because of its
pace, is the most successful. It
rises to a triumphant “To Or
leans! To Orleans!” which is not
really equalled. It is not until the
epilogue, which brings clearly in
to focus the innocent quality of
the people who burned Joan in
the energy of their righteousness,
that the emotional intensity is
again at such a pitch. Even Joan’s
defiance of the church and fire
does not reach it, but the quiet
humor expressed at the thought
of her resurrection does.
One might well ask with Joan.
“When will this beautiful earth
be ready to receive Thy saints,
Oh Lord? How long? How long?”
