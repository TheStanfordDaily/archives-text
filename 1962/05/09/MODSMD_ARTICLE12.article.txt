GRATEFUL TO LUCE
Editor, The Daily:
Many of a less incisive turn of
mind than Mr. Luce have long
been amused by The Daily’s con
tribution to Stanford campus life.
Vaguely accepting the publica
tion’s financial limitations and
aware of its obligations to various
student groups, they have been
unconcerned by (if in fact, they
noticed) an editorial decline in
sidiously accompanied by the rise
of “immature journalistic ten
dencies.’’
I, for one, am grateful to Mr.
Luce for courageously exposing
these practices before the reading
student body. He has provided the
initial insight from which we all
might benefit in the future. For
instance, the plot to avoid “criti
cism from the student body by
cleverly offering nothing to criti
cize.” Diabolical. But, of course,
it is obvious, once the conspiracy
has been laid bare.
I would disagree, however, with
Mr. Luce’s interpretation of your
attack on W. S. Thompson. Your
quick cynicism in this “childish,
repetitious and worst of all bor
ing” assault was intended not as
a joke, but as a subtle attempt to
gain sympathy for the student
leader.
It is unfortunate that Mr. Luce,
after penetrating to the core of
the intrigue, concluded his devas
tating letter with a scathing in
dictment of Mediascope and Marl
boro ads (the surface rather than
the substance of Daily machina
tions). After revealing a revolu
tionary frame of reference, he be
comes ensnared in the pervasive
poor writing and cute reporting,
a failing which points up the
Daily danger to even the most
perspicacious. He might profit
ably have proceeded to your cov
erage of the liquor policy amend

ment which was piously initiated
by Eating Club “activists” and
has been reported in The Daily
almost entirely by their fellow
members. Even the sports page is
characterized by omission and
suppression as evidenced by the
absence of intramural horseshoe
scores and the current deempha
sis of coed volleyball.
We are all indebted to Mr. Luce
for his insight; his lack of total
success admirably illustrates the
extent of the menace. It would
be foolishly optimistic to suppose
that there exists any hope for ma
ture reporting in the near future.
The Daily will, no doubt, con
tinue to be run by a self-perpetu
ating clique of childish, biased,
cynical, inadequate, irresponsible
journalists. But, for those who
can approach the publication with
perception, Mr. Luce offers a
note of hope.

Editor, The Daily:
In the recent presidential cam
paign wo saw the victory of a
man who was imaginative and en
tertaining to some, and cunning
and unscrupulous to others. Mr.
Rosencranz's campaign state
ments were vague, ironic, flip
pant, and even hilarious. Yet he
won. This does not at all mean
that he will be a “bad” president.
Indeed, he appears to have the
ability to be a very good one.
What it does mean is that if he is
a bad president, it will be no more
than the students who elected
him deserve since they voted for
him despite—perhaps because of
—the type of campaign he waged.
And if he is a “good” president, it
will not be because the students
who voted for him expected him
to be.

student body. He has provided the
initial insight from which we all
might benefit in the future. For
instance, the plot to avoid “criti
cism from the student body by
cleverly offering nothing to criti
cize.” Diabolical. But, of course,
it is obvious, once the conspiracy
has been laid bare.
I would disagree, however, with
Mr. Luce’s interpretation of your
attack on W. S. Thompson. Your
quick cynicism in this “childish,
repetitious and worst of all bor
ing” assault was intended not as
a joke, but as a subtle attempt to
gain sympathy for the student
leader.
It is unfortunate that Mr. Luce,
after penetrating to the core of
the intrigue, concluded his devas
tating letter with a scathing in
dictment of Mediascope and Marl
boro ads (the surface rather than
the substance of Daily machina
tions). After revealing a revolu
tionary frame of reference, he be
comes ensnared in the pervasive
poor writing and cute reporting,
a failing which points up the
Daily danger to even the most
perspicacious. He might profit
ably have proceeded to your cov
erage of the liquor policy amend

ment which was piously initiated
by Eating Club “activists” and
has been reported in The Daily
almost entirely by their fellow
members. Even the sports page is
characterized by omission and
suppression as evidenced by the
absence of intramural horseshoe
scores and the current deempha
sis of coed volleyball.
We are all indebted to Mr. Luce
for his insight; his lack of total
success admirably illustrates the
extent of the menace. It would
be foolishly optimistic to suppose
that there exists any hope for ma
ture reporting in the near future.
The Daily will, no doubt, con
tinue to be run by a self-perpetu
ating clique of childish, biased,
cynical, inadequate, irresponsible
journalists. But, for those who
can approach the publication with
perception, Mr. Luce offers a
note of hope.

In the recent presidential cam
paign wo saw the victory of a
man who was imaginative and en
tertaining to some, and cunning
and unscrupulous to others. Mr.
Rosencranz's campaign state
ments were vague, ironic, flip
pant, and even hilarious. Yet he
won. This does not at all mean
that he will be a “bad” president.
Indeed, he appears to have the
ability to be a very good one.
What it does mean is that if he is
a bad president, it will be no more
than the students who elected
him deserve since they voted for
him despite—perhaps because of
—the type of campaign he waged.
And if he is a “good” president, it
will not be because the students
who voted for him expected him
to be.

Editor, The Daily:
Many of a less incisive turn of
mind than Mr. Luce have long
been amused by The Daily’s con
tribution to Stanford campus life.
Vaguely accepting the publica
tion’s financial limitations and
aware of its obligations to various
student groups, they have been
unconcerned by (if in fact, they
noticed) an editorial decline in
sidiously accompanied by the rise
of “immature journalistic ten
dencies.’’
I, for one, am grateful to Mr.
Luce for courageously exposing
these practices before the reading
student body. He has provided the
