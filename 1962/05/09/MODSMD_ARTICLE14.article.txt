## Political Crisis in Argentina 
### RICHARD C. OFFUTT 
The present political crisis in
Argentina resulted from two ele
ments common to South Ameri
can “democracies.” Frondizi’s fall
or failure stems from lack of un
derstanding among the voters,
expressed in this case as a “re
birth of peronism,” and from a
gradual loss of confidence in mili
tary circles, now manifested in
the military dictatorship with
President Guido as the "usable
idiot” as the residents say. Both
these elements, while arising in
a particular form in Argentina,
are deeply rooted in the develop
mental complexes of Latin Amer
ican politics.
In examining the first, one finds
that politicians who actually work
for the masses are rare, and that
those who do easily become
myths. Further, that these myths
are often successfully exploited
by the opposition leaders in later
regimes. No bo dy remembers
Peron’s dictatorial methods or
his scandalous affairs with “co
eds” after Evita’s death. His name
is connected only with the prom
ised or realized prosperity for the
workers, with a period in which
the daily headlines proclaimed Ar
gentina and the “mundo peronis
ta” as the greatest in the world.
PERON BUILT the industrial
proletariat and took care of them
with social reforms and wage
raises completely out of propor
tion to the national economy.
These masses, enjoying a previ
ously unknown power, forgot all
the essentials of civic culture,
and therefore have been unable
to accept or understand Fron
dizi’s healthy but austere econ
omic recovery measures. Wages
have remained approximately the
same since Peron’s expulsion but
prices have soared.
Said one worker, “Moral pres
tige (referring to Frondizi’s po
litical reputation), economic sta
bility, and democracy are wonder
ful, but the high-living under
Peron was better.” This form of
civic degeneration is, however,
best captured in another state
ment, overheard in a rural bar
bershop: “Frondizi always told
the truth, that was something

now for us, but ho was invari
ably wrong.” The ultimate resi
due of the Pcron era is a symbol
—worship of “Juan and Eva” in
timately connected with a fester
ing disrespect for all public insti
tutions functioning in the slower
democratic process.
Those voters labeled “peronis
tas” along with the political lead
ers, who employ his name like a
magic symbol, are either indif
ferent or opposed to his actual
return, the politicians being much
more concerned with their own
careers than with that of the old
leader and his new “teen-age
bride.” The position of both
groups is better termed anti :
Frondizi than pro-Peron. The phe
nomenon of civic degeneration it
self, a basic contempt for any
form of authority which fails to
meet the voters’ immediate whims,
finds its simplest example
throughout South America in the
helpless traffic policemen, who
are more accustomed to dodging
traffic than directing it. Its cul
mination can become the elector
al rejection of a government with
generally good intentions for the
country involved, but proceeding
too slowly for public sentiment.
THE FINAL blow to Frondizi’s
policies was provided by the all
powerful military. His depend
ence on the will of the armed
forces had been repeatedly dem
onstrated during his term of of
fice. He suffered about 40 major
and innumerable minor crises
with his “generals.” Two other
current examples of the role of
the military in South America
are seen in Peru and Ecuador. In
the former the military leaders
are threatening to block the pres
idency of Victor Raul Haya de la
Torre if elected in the coming
campaign, a strong leftist-non
communist candidate; and in the
latter, after forcing former Presi
dent Iberra into exile, they have
dominated* the policies of Presi
dent Carlos Julio Arosemena to
the letter.
Although most South American
governments are patterned after
the U. S. constitution, the three
powers are generally subservient
to a fourth, the military. Presi
dents are elected in the public

eye, but important decisions are
made behind the scenes in a game
of rotating chairs among various
military cliques. As the former
Colombian President Eduardo
Santos once said, "Every Latin
American country is virtually oc
cupied by its own army.”
Diplomatic ruptures with Cuba
are heralded as advances in the
democratic process. To my knowl
edge, however, none has lesulted
through a plebiscite, but instead
more than a few through military
force, viz. Ecuador’s most recent
break with Castro.
THE FORMER cries of “ex
ploitation” and “imperialism” lev
eled at the U.S. government are
now augmented by the accusa
tion of supporting and cooper
ating with the military “revolu
tionists,” In this light the “sensi
ble and necessary” break with
Castroism may well be creating
new problems, more serious than
the old ones.
These two lessons to be learned
from the Argentine crisis are im
portant to the success or failure
of the “Alliance for Progress."
North America has thus far with
held recognition for the post-
Frondizi putsch-government, but
Washington still seems ready to
gloat over any and every break
with Castro as if it were a sign
of democratic progress.
The idea of the modern democ
racy does not have a historical
justification or significance here
as in the United Slates, but, on
the contrary, is just beginning to
penetrate the public mind. Nei
ther a responsible political class
nor the basic idea of “fair play”
can arise as long as it remains a
military plaything.
The latinamericanos are wait
ing to be convinced that free en
terprise is as adequate to meet
ing their problems as Marxism.
The financial-aid stipulations im
posed in the “alianza” in respect
to social progress are sound. Fur
thermore their enforcement is
essential to demonstrate the prag
matic qualities of democracy, but
the execution must proceed with
an encompassing view for such
ramifications as this pro-Ameri
can militarism and without of
fending the Latin American pride
by treating them as school chil
dren or colonies.

Peron’s dictatorial methods or
his scandalous affairs with “co
eds” after Evita’s death. His name
is connected only with the prom

workers, with a period in which
the daily headlines proclaimed Ar

PERON BUILT the industrial
proletariat and took care of them
with social reforms and wage
raises completely out of propor
tion to the national economy.
These masses, enjoying a previ
ously unknown power, forgot all
the essentials of civic culture,
and therefore have been unable
to accept or understand Fron
dizi’s healthy but austere econ
omic recovery measures. Wages
have remained approximately the
same since Peron’s expulsion but
prices have soared.
Said one worker, “Moral pres
tige (referring to Frondizi’s po
litical reputation), economic sta
bility, and democracy are wonder
ful, but the high-living under
Peron was better.” This form of
civic degeneration is, however,
best captured in another state
ment, overheard in a rural bar
bershop: “Frondizi always told
the truth, that was something

now for us, but ho was invari
ably wrong.” The ultimate resi
due of the Pcron era is a symbol
—worship of “Juan and Eva” in
timately connected with a fester
ing disrespect for all public insti
tutions functioning in the slower
democratic process.
Those voters labeled “peronis
tas” along with the political lead
ers, who employ his name like a
magic symbol, are either indif
ferent or opposed to his actual
return, the politicians being much
more concerned with their own
careers than with that of the old
leader and his new “teen-age
bride.” The position of both
groups is better termed anti :
Frondizi than pro-Peron. The phe
nomenon of civic degeneration it
self, a basic contempt for any
form of authority which fails to
meet the voters’ immediate whims,
finds its simplest example
throughout South America in the
helpless traffic policemen, who
are more accustomed to dodging
traffic than directing it. Its cul
mination can become the elector
al rejection of a government with
generally good intentions for the
country involved, but proceeding
too slowly for public sentiment.
THE FINAL blow to Frondizi’s
policies was provided by the all
powerful military. His depend
ence on the will of the armed
forces had been repeatedly dem
onstrated during his term of of
fice. He suffered about 40 major
and innumerable minor crises
with his “generals.” Two other
current examples of the role of
the military in South America
are seen in Peru and Ecuador. In
the former the military leaders
are threatening to block the pres
idency of Victor Raul Haya de la
Torre if elected in the coming
campaign, a strong leftist-non
communist candidate; and in the
latter, after forcing former Presi
dent Iberra into exile, they have
dominated* the policies of Presi
dent Carlos Julio Arosemena to
the letter.
Although most South American
governments are patterned after
the U. S. constitution, the three
powers are generally subservient
to a fourth, the military. Presi
dents are elected in the public

eye, but important decisions are
made behind the scenes in a game
of rotating chairs among various
military cliques. As the former
Colombian President Eduardo
Santos once said, "Every Latin
American country is virtually oc
cupied by its own army.”
Diplomatic ruptures with Cuba
are heralded as advances in the
democratic process. To my knowl
edge, however, none has lesulted
through a plebiscite, but instead
more than a few through military
force, viz. Ecuador’s most recent
break with Castro.
THE FORMER cries of “ex
ploitation” and “imperialism” lev
eled at the U.S. government are
now augmented by the accusa
tion of supporting and cooper
ating with the military “revolu
tionists,” In this light the “sensi
ble and necessary” break with
Castroism may well be creating
new problems, more serious than
the old ones.
These two lessons to be learned
from the Argentine crisis are im
portant to the success or failure
of the “Alliance for Progress."
North America has thus far with
held recognition for the post-
Frondizi putsch-government, but
Washington still seems ready to
gloat over any and every break
with Castro as if it were a sign
of democratic progress.
The idea of the modern democ
racy does not have a historical
justification or significance here
as in the United Slates, but, on
the contrary, is just beginning to
penetrate the public mind. Nei
ther a responsible political class
nor the basic idea of “fair play”
can arise as long as it remains a
military plaything.
The latinamericanos are wait
ing to be convinced that free en
terprise is as adequate to meet
ing their problems as Marxism.
The financial-aid stipulations im
posed in the “alianza” in respect
to social progress are sound. Fur
thermore their enforcement is
essential to demonstrate the prag

the execution must proceed with
an encompassing view for such
ramifications as this pro-Ameri
can militarism and without of
fending the Latin American pride
by treating them as school chil
dren or colonies.
The present political crisis in
Argentina resulted from two ele
ments common to South Ameri
can “democracies.” Frondizi’s fall
or failure stems from lack of un
derstanding among the voters,
expressed in this case as a “re
birth of peronism,” and from a
gradual loss of confidence in mili
tary circles, now manifested in
the military dictatorship with
President Guido as the "usable

these elements, while arising in
a particular form in Argentina,
are deeply rooted in the develop

civic degeneration is, however,
best captured in another state
ment, overheard in a rural bar
bershop: “Frondizi always told
the truth, that was something

now for us, but ho was invari

Those voters labeled “peronis

ers, who employ his name like a
magic symbol, are either indif

return, the politicians being much
more concerned with their own
careers than with that of the old
leader and his new “teen-age
bride.” The position of both
groups is better termed anti :
Frondizi than pro-Peron. The phe
nomenon of civic degeneration it
self, a basic contempt for any
form of authority which fails to
meet the voters’ immediate whims,
finds its simplest example
throughout South America in the
helpless traffic policemen, who
are more accustomed to dodging
traffic than directing it. Its cul
mination can become the elector
al rejection of a government with
generally good intentions for the
country involved, but proceeding
too slowly for public sentiment.
THE FINAL blow to Frondizi’s
policies was provided by the all
powerful military. His depend
ence on the will of the armed
forces had been repeatedly dem
onstrated during his term of of
fice. He suffered about 40 major
and innumerable minor crises
with his “generals.” Two other
current examples of the role of
the military in South America
are seen in Peru and Ecuador. In
the former the military leaders
are threatening to block the pres
idency of Victor Raul Haya de la
Torre if elected in the coming
campaign, a strong leftist-non
communist candidate; and in the
latter, after forcing former Presi
dent Iberra into exile, they have
dominated* the policies of Presi
dent Carlos Julio Arosemena to
the letter.
Although most South American
governments are patterned after
the U. S. constitution, the three
powers are generally subservient
to a fourth, the military. Presi
dents are elected in the public

eye, but important decisions are
made behind the scenes in a game
of rotating chairs among various
military cliques. As the former
Colombian President Eduardo
Santos once said, "Every Latin
American country is virtually oc
cupied by its own army.”
Diplomatic ruptures with Cuba
are heralded as advances in the
democratic process. To my knowl
edge, however, none has lesulted
through a plebiscite, but instead
more than a few through military
force, viz. Ecuador’s most recent
break with Castro.
THE FORMER cries of “ex
ploitation” and “imperialism” lev
eled at the U.S. government are
now augmented by the accusa
tion of supporting and cooper
ating with the military “revolu
tionists,” In this light the “sensi
ble and necessary” break with
Castroism may well be creating
new problems, more serious than
the old ones.
These two lessons to be learned
from the Argentine crisis are im
portant to the success or failure
of the “Alliance for Progress."
North America has thus far with
held recognition for the post-
Frondizi putsch-government, but
Washington still seems ready to
gloat over any and every break
with Castro as if it were a sign
of democratic progress.
The idea of the modern democ

The present political crisis in
Argentina resulted from two ele
ments common to South Ameri
can “democracies.” Frondizi’s fall
or failure stems from lack of un
derstanding among the voters,
expressed in this case as a “re
birth of peronism,” and from a
gradual loss of confidence in mili
tary circles, now manifested in
the military dictatorship with
President Guido as the "usable

these elements, while arising in
a particular form in Argentina,
are deeply rooted in the develop
mental complexes of Latin Amer
ican politics.
In examining the first, one finds
that politicians who actually work
for the masses are rare, and that
those who do easily become
myths. Further, that these myths
are often successfully exploited
by the opposition leaders in later

Peron’s dictatorial methods or
his scandalous affairs with “co

is connected only with the prom

workers, with a period in which
the daily headlines proclaimed Ar
gentina and the “mundo peronis

PERON BUILT the industrial
proletariat and took care of them
with social reforms and wage
raises completely out of propor

These masses, enjoying a previ
ously unknown power, forgot all
the essentials of civic culture,
and therefore have been unable
to accept or understand Fron

omic recovery measures. Wages
have remained approximately the

more concerned with their own
careers than with that of the old
leader and his new “teen-age
bride.” The position of both
groups is better termed anti :
Frondizi than pro-Peron. The phe
nomenon of civic degeneration it
self, a basic contempt for any
form of authority which fails to
meet the voters’ immediate whims,
finds its simplest example
throughout South America in the
helpless traffic policemen, who
are more accustomed to dodging
traffic than directing it. Its cul
mination can become the elector
al rejection of a government with
generally good intentions for the
country involved, but proceeding
too slowly for public sentiment.
THE FINAL blow to Frondizi’s
policies was provided by the all
powerful military. His depend
ence on the will of the armed
forces had been repeatedly dem
onstrated during his term of of
fice. He suffered about 40 major
and innumerable minor crises
with his “generals.” Two other
current examples of the role of
the military in South America
are seen in Peru and Ecuador. In
the former the military leaders
are threatening to block the pres
idency of Victor Raul Haya de la
Torre if elected in the coming
campaign, a strong leftist-non
communist candidate; and in the
latter, after forcing former Presi
dent Iberra into exile, they have
dominated* the policies of Presi
dent Carlos Julio Arosemena to
the letter.
Although most South American
governments are patterned after
the U. S. constitution, the three
powers are generally subservient
to a fourth, the military. Presi
dents are elected in the public

eye, but important decisions are
made behind the scenes in a game
of rotating chairs among various
military cliques. As the former
Colombian President Eduardo
Santos once said, "Every Latin
American country is virtually oc
cupied by its own army.”
Diplomatic ruptures with Cuba
are heralded as advances in the
democratic process. To my knowl
edge, however, none has lesulted
through a plebiscite, but instead
more than a few through military
force, viz. Ecuador’s most recent
break with Castro.
THE FORMER cries of “ex
ploitation” and “imperialism” lev
eled at the U.S. government are
now augmented by the accusa
tion of supporting and cooper

ble and necessary” break with
Castroism may well be creating
new problems, more serious than
the old ones.
These two lessons to be learned

Washington still seems ready to

with Castro as if it were a sign
of democratic progress.

military plaything.

The present political crisis in
Argentina resulted from two ele
ments common to South Ameri
can “democracies.” Frondizi’s fall
or failure stems from lack of un
derstanding among the voters,
expressed in this case as a “re
birth of peronism,” and from a
gradual loss of confidence in mili
tary circles, now manifested in
the military dictatorship with
President Guido as the "usable
idiot” as the residents say. Both
these elements, while arising in
a particular form in Argentina,
are deeply rooted in the develop
mental complexes of Latin Amer
ican politics.
In examining the first, one finds
that politicians who actually work
for the masses are rare, and that
those who do easily become
myths. Further, that these myths
are often successfully exploited
by the opposition leaders in later
regimes. No bo dy remembers
Peron’s dictatorial methods or
his scandalous affairs with “co
eds” after Evita’s death. His name
is connected only with the prom
ised or realized prosperity for the
workers, with a period in which
the daily headlines proclaimed Ar
gentina and the “mundo peronis
ta” as the greatest in the world.
PERON BUILT the industrial
proletariat and took care of them
with social reforms and wage
raises completely out of propor
tion to the national economy.
These masses, enjoying a previ
ously unknown power, forgot all
the essentials of civic culture,
and therefore have been unable
to accept or understand Fron
dizi’s healthy but austere econ
omic recovery measures. Wages
have remained approximately the
same since Peron’s expulsion but
prices have soared.
Said one worker, “Moral pres
tige (referring to Frondizi’s po
litical reputation), economic sta
bility, and democracy are wonder
ful, but the high-living under
Peron was better.” This form of
civic degeneration is, however,
best captured in another state
ment, overheard in a rural bar
bershop: “Frondizi always told
the truth, that was something

now for us, but ho was invari
ably wrong.” The ultimate resi
due of the Pcron era is a symbol
—worship of “Juan and Eva” in
timately connected with a fester
ing disrespect for all public insti
tutions functioning in the slower
democratic process.
Those voters labeled “peronis
tas” along with the political lead
ers, who employ his name like a
magic symbol, are either indif
ferent or opposed to his actual
return, the politicians being much
more concerned with their own
careers than with that of the old
leader and his new “teen-age
bride.” The position of both
groups is better termed anti :
Frondizi than pro-Peron. The phe
nomenon of civic degeneration it
self, a basic contempt for any
form of authority which fails to
