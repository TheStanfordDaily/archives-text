# OUR MAN ON THE FARM

This Saturday in Stanford Stadium, the nostalgia will be thick
enough to cut with a knife.
FORMKR STANFORD GRIDIRON heroes aplenty will be re
turning to do battle with the present-day Indian varsity football
team in the Varsity-Alumni football game, the annual spring foot
ball attraction.
The alums, who dale as far back as 1949, can scarcely be called
old men, but many will be donning the pads for the first time in

many a moon in an effort to
show the youngsters how the
game is played.
LKST ANYONF think the game
is a joke, I remind you that two
years ago, the alums pulled out
a 29-28 thriller. The varsity
romped*47-14 last year, but this
gives the alums all the more in
centive to win.
54 Will Be Here
54 of Stanford’s more recent
stars have indicated that they
will be here for the game. The
first alum workout was last night
so its anybody’s guess how their
offense will function but with the
additions from this year’s varsity
squad, they have to he an im-

provement over last year’s club.
SUC H GRADUATING seniors
as linebacker John Butler, guards

Tom Walsh and Errol Scott, center Chris Cottle, and tackle Jack
Gordon, will be around to give it one last fling.
Backfield talent from the '6l varsity includes Hal Steuben. Rod
Sears and Chuck Butler.
But the big names of John Brodie, Chris Burford and Paul Wig
gin are the ones that will draw the crowd. They have indicated they
might play, but there is the omnipresent danger in this sort of
contest that a last minute injury or other difficulty will prevent
participation.
OTHERS WHO WII.L play for the alums include: ends, Sam
Morley, Carl Isaacs and Irv Nickolai; tackles, Troy Barbee, Phil
Burkland, Eric Protiva and Dean Hinshaw; guards, Norm Manou
gian, Don Manoukian, and Russ Steele; centers, Joe Long, Roch
Conklin, and Bob Long; backs, Jerry Gustafson, Dick Horn, Gordy
Young, Skip Face, A1 Harrington. Rick McMillen, Chuck Shea and
Archie Schmitt.

Arrillaga Is Unexpected
One other who will play is very unexpected in the alum
roster. John Arrillaga, who was all-AAWU basketball, will try out
at end and match wits with the rugged Stanford defensive backfield.
THE GAME SHAPES UP as a Stanford varsity victory. How
ever, if Brodie, Wiggin and Burford play, the alumni offense could
Ire the best the varsity will see this year or next.
Morley, Burford, Isaacs and Nickolai are a representation of
some of the finest pass receivers in Stanford history, and when it
comes to throwing the ball, ask the Los Angeles Rams about Brodie.
Gustafson was a fine passer in his day, which wasn't long ago.
SEARS AND BUTLER gave various defensive backfields fits
this year.
Bet on the varsity to win by two or three touchdowns. But if you
do, cross fingers and hope that Brodie and Company don’t play.


JOHN BRODIE
Will he show up?
