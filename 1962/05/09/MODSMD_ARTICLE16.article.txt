# Trackers Post High Marks
## 
### 
Stanford trackmen have been
performing well lately, and a
glance at the best track and field
performance of 1962 supports this
statement. In five events the In
dians rank at least fifth and as
high as second in the country.
Harry McCalla, Stanford t wo
rmier, is the newest name on the
list. His record-setting 8:52.7
clocking last Saturday against
Cal places him third in the coun
try this year, behind the likes of
Oregon’s Dyrol Burleson. McCal
la is only a sophomore, and should
continue to lower the Stanford
record, which he currently holds.
Dave Weill, who has flipped the
discus 189-11, ranks third among
collegiate competition.
Art Batchelder’s early season
javelin throw of 241-5 C puts him
in fifth place, behind USC’s Jan
Sikorsky, whom he beat in a dual
meet two weeks ago.
Two relay teams also have

posted excellent marks this sea
son. The distance medley relay
squad has a clocking of 9:47.2,
good enough for third, and the
shuttle hurdles team has run the
distance in 58.9 seconds, second
best in the nation.
