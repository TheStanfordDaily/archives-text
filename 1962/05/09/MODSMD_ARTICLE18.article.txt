## 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Fditor 
Stanford fell to fourth place in
the CIHA with its second straight
loss on the road to California, 5-2.
yesterday on the Berkeley field,
Darrell Sutherland pitched
strong baseball for five innings,
giving up only one hit in that
span, but Cal piled up five runs
in the sixth, seventh, and eighth
to win.
Cal’s Bill Oakley pitched su
perbly all the way to register the
win that advanced Cal past the
Indians to third place.
Stanford’s overall won-loss rec
ord now stands at 18-11. Of the 11
losses, nine have been .away
games. The Indians have won
only four road games, leaving
them 11-2 in Sunken Diomand.
Stanford missed a chance to
KO Oakley in the first inning
and perhaps wrap up the game.
O. ,1. Solander opened with a

walk, and Greg Post lined a shot
to right field that Cal first sackor
Bill Bowley grabbed on a sparkl
ing catch. Rich Ferrazzano then
singled to left, advancing Soland
er to second.
Jack Allen almost brought the
game to a happy ending before
it began with a long fly ball that
was within a few feet of booming
off the right field fence for a two
run triple, but A1 Mindell was on
his horse and pulled it in and that
was the Indians’ last gasp ’til the
ninth.
In the last frame, the Indians’
rallied for a pair of runs to avert
their first shutout of the year.
Joel Shulman carromed a triple
off the fence in right center to
drive in Warren Newell. Shulman
himself scored w ; hen Mindell let
the bouncing ball go through his
legs.
Cal got their first effective
hitting in quite a while, with the
eight Cal hits including four

r
| doubles. The unexpected Bear
hitting punch raised their CIBA
team batting average above the
j ,188 they were hitting going into
j the game.
Doug Burnett sparked the Bear
: attack with a pair of doubles, and
| made eight flawless plays at third
j base.
The next Stanford action is a
pair of weekend games with Cal
Poly of Pomona.
