A newly formed square dance
group meets tonight and every

Womenâ€™s Gym.
The group was formed by Dick
Biggs and Karen Seyfert with
Mrs. Miriam Lidster, dance in
structor. Ken Matchetl and Mrs.
Lidster call for the dancers, but
additional callers are needed.
Beginners are always welcome.
The group started this quarter

more advanced dances.
