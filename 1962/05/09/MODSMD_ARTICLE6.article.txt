# Programs for Union Described
## 
### LEE SHERSHOW, ST&T 
Tresidder Memorial Union is to be a Uni
versity Community Center, designed to ful
fill the needs of all members of the Univer
sity undergraduates, graduates, faculty, and
administration. In order to determine what
these needs were, many members of the
Stanford Community have been consulted.
In the fall of 1959 a student-faculty com
mittee. with well over one hundred active
| participants, examined possible facilities and
programs from other Unions all over the
country. They took polls, submitted ques
i tionnaires to approximately two thousand
| students, and carefully analyzed the results.
A list was devised of those facilities and pro
grams w'hich were most needed, with priority
given to those things which would be used
the greatest number of hours per day.
REALIZING THAT their needs will
| change with time, the committee kept well
in mind the necessity of designing the build
ing to be as flexible as possible. To continue
in this process, persons from all these groups
will continue to work with the Union’s per
manent staff, headed by C. A. Berry, to de
j velop and improve Tresidder Union. They
I will emphasize the development of new areas
I of university activity not presently worked

on, and provide the best facilities possible
for existing activities.
Immediately after the design of the Union
was decided upon, students and faculty mem
bers began work towards the creation of
certain programs to be presented in the
Union. During the past two quarters, one
student committee, for example, has been
working on a three-week exhibit of the
works of Leonardo Da Vinci. Thirty-five
working models of his inventions will occupy
much of the Union lobby and meeting rooms.
His notebooks and other literature will be on
the shelves of the browsing library. The prize
winning film depicting his life and works
will be shown frequently in another meeting
room. The lute music composed by Leonardo
will be available on tapes in the recording
library. Reproductions of his sketches, his
oils, and his frescoes will be displayed in
the illuminated art exhibit cases along the
second floor exterior corridor. Similar re
productions will be part of the circulating
library of art prints.
STUDENTS NOW studying at the Flo
rence campus are searching for more art
work and local color to bring to the Da Vinci
Exhibit. Discussions will be held in the
lounges, led by different faculty members.
The Exhibit is expected to be one of the

finest ever done on Leonardo Da Vinci, and
it shows very well how the varied facilities
of the new Union can be integrated.
Another committee has been trying to ar
range various lectures of a different type.
One of these series will be on “My Last Lec
ture.” Various members of the faculty and
administration have been asked to present
the hypothetical contents of the last lecture
of their career, not necessarily exclusively
in their field. For the week following the
lecture, it is hoped that the professor would
agree to spend some time each day in the
new Cellar so that students might discuss
his lecture with him.
ON THK SOCIAL and recreational side,
one typical proposal has been to make ex
cellent foreign films, informal dancing, and
games like bridge or billiards available on
weekends. Perhaps in this way members of
the University could enjoy a convenient and
inexpensive weekend evening in the Union.
All three of these programs are typical
of the variety of activities the Tresidder
Union will offer next fall, in its twin goals of
coffee and culture. Anyone seeking further
information concerning any aspect of the
new Union are invited to write to the In
formation Division, Tresidder Memorial
Union Bond, care of Stanford Union.
