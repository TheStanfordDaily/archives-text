# Wolfe Portrays Khrushchev as 'Smart, Tough'
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ 
“Khrushchev continues to man
euver between the two poles
. . . the plague of all-out peace
and the plague of all-out war—
either of which he thinks is a
mortal danger,” historian Ber
tram Wolfe told a packed Dinkel
spiel Auditorium last night.
In an address analyzing Lenin,
Stalin, and Khrushchev and
Khrushchev’s foreign policy,
Wolfe projected the fate of ne
gotiations and peaceful co-exist
ence, “how this able man, and he
is an able man, uses negotiations:
to divert attention from his real
intentions. ... to keep on a dra
matic show ...”
WOLFE’S OUTLOOK upon ne
gotiating with Mr. K is bleak: if
we test, we can be accused of
breaking negotiations: if it ap
pears that talks will be getting
down to issues, the Soviets can
walk out “backward, so as to
look like they’re walking in.
“Give and take (by the Sovi
ets) has boiled down to the pro
portion ‘you give a little, we take
a little . . . ’ ”
Peaceful co-existence is viewed
by Wolfe as a tactic whose “rea
sons arc imbedded in Communist
dogma. . . . Our capitalist soci
ety is seen as decadent and
doomed. History and time are on
their side. So one of the things
they will not risk is all-out war.”
The historian sees the tactics
of peaceful co-existence imbedded
in the value the communists place
on power. “They are willing to
risk local engagement and hope
they stay local engagements,”
but will avoid all-out war for
fear of a change in the power
balance.
PEACEFUL co-existence “was
one of Stalin’s favorite maneu
vers.” Khrushchev, however, “is
more of a gambler, more reck
less in spirit, and has more gam
ing tables on which to play this
dangerous game.”
In providing a profile of Khrush
chev, Wolfe paints the portrait
of a man professedly against “the
cult of the individual.” yet who
exhibits a touch of the charis
matic; “Khrushchev is shrewd,
tough, . . . master of the Rus
sian proverb . . . has less para
noia (than Stalin), but I can’t
help but think that the wielding
of absolute and unrestricted pow
er, with people only saying ‘yes,
yes,’ cannot help but unhinge the
mind.
“Now, as under Stalin, dictat
orship requires a dictator; infal
lible doctrine requires an infal
lible interpreter. ...”

walk out “backward, so as to
look like they’re walking in.
