# U.N. POLISH AMBASSADOR
## Keep 'Nuclear Club' Out of East Europe 
### BILL REPPY 
Poland demands that the Western nations give her a guarantee
that West Germany will not be given atomic weapons, according
to Bohdan Lewandowski, Polish Ambassador to the United
Nations.
Speaking to a Cubberley Auditorium audience yesterday after

noon the young ambassador said+
Poland fears a nuclear armed
West Germany because that na
tion has territorial claims on Po
land, but that she believes the
Soviet Union’s guarantee of her
borders will always be sufficient
to prevent German aggression.
Poland proposes a plan (the
Rapacski Plan) to create a nu
clear-free area of the countries of
East and West Germany, Czecho
slovakia, and Poland, Lewandow
ski said.

The first stage of the plan calls
for freezing nuclear stockpiling
in these countries, he said. In the
second stage all existing nuclear
weapons would be eliminated and
a limit set on foreign troops per
mitted in the territory.
“This prohibition would be good
for all European countries,” he
said. “Don’t let the nuclear club
get any bigger.”
The ambassador said Poland’s
attitude was typical of the world’s
smaller countries which wish to
eliminate themselves from the
nuclear race since it is too ex
pensive and very dangerous to
their security.
The Polish plan calls for com
plete inspection, even of the ex
isting stock piles. “This would
provide for the major powers’
experience in tho problem of in
spection and perhaps minimize
their fears,” Lewandowski said.
The plan would open the way to
a final solution of the nuclear ar
maments problem and the Ger
man problem, he said.
Poland is not seeking to oust
West Germany from NATO. “It
is general knowledge that West
Germany has economic and cul
tural ties with the NATO coun
tries and Poland accepts it as a
fact of life that West Germany
will remain in NATO,” he said.
“Wo don’t want atomic ties be
tween West Germany and the
western nations,” he explained.
Although Lewandowski believes
German reunification is inevit
able, he said he feels it is impos
sible for the time being. It can
occur only when the rival mili
tary blocs reach an understand
ing or cease to exist, he said.
Poland realizes that she is not
a big power and not a decisive
voice in world politics. Therefore,
she does not try to exercise for
eign policy on a global basis, the
ambassador said.
The Poles do not pass judg
ment on the plans of the USSR
and the United States for nuclear
disarmament, nor do they try to
influence the control proposals
and demands of these countries.
Lewandowski said that no
country W’ants foreign troops on
its native soil. He believes that
in a referendum in West Ger
many. Poland, Hungary or even
France the people would elect to
have foreign troops removed.
