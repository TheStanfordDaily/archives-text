LOS ANGELES ( UPI)— Plans for the forthcoming West Coast
operations of the New York Times were outlined yesterday by
Andrew Fisher, assistant general manager of the newspaper.
The publication will be circulated from Los Angeles to all
Pacific states and key cities in neighboring states, Alaska, Hawaii,

British Columbia and Mexico. t
Most circulation will be mail de
livery, according to Fisher.
ATTENDING a luncheon at
the Greater Los Angeles Press
Club, Fisher said the target date
for starting publication is early
in October. The West Coast edi
tion of the New York Times will
start with about 32 pages, includ
ing 110 to 120 columns of news,
he estimated.
The Times executive said no
New York City or New York state
news of purely local New York
interest would be included in the
West Coast edition.
‘‘There will aso be no attempt
to provide local interest news of
the many western cities.” he said.
THE PUBLICATION will bo
sold for 10 cents on newsstands
and $26.50 per year by subscrip
tion. There wil be no home de
livery, Advertising will bo sold
in New York for an additional
rate in conjunction with the New
York Times, he said. He said it
also will be sold in New York and
San Francisco.
Fisher said that after opening
the Paris edition in November,
1960, the Times received a volume
of mail from western states ask
ing for a western edition. He said
as a result of some 5,000 letters
and telegrams, the New York
Times investigated and came to
the conclusion a number of peo
ple would subscribe.
Fisher said as of Friday, the
West Coast edition of New York
Times had 19,682 prepaid sub
scribers.
