# Students Hold Art Exhibition
## 
### 
The annual Student Art Ex
hibit, which open Saturday in the
Art Gallery near the Library, will
feature drawing, sculpture, graph
ic art and several phases of de
sign, according to Professor
Matthew S. Kahn who is direct
ing the installation of the exhibit
by a large team of students.
The show, which will run from
May 12 to May 27, will be fol
lowed by an exhibition of the
work of the architecture students
from June 3 until June 17.
The displays of art and of ar
chitecture have been separated
for the first time this year be
cause the amount of student work
has increased so much that it
would be difficult to display both
at the same time in the limited
space.
The exhibit consists of student
work collected by the faculty
from the best work in the differ
ent classes.
“I feel that the show demon
strates a kind of searching
thoughtfulness that is very ap
propriate for University art ex
pression,” said Kahn.
“It tends to express the tre
mendous vigor of the student pro
ductions,” he continued, “by be
ing very full so that there will be
a lot to see. The art department
prides itself on the diversity of
its viewpoint and the show re
flects this.”
“If the show is crowded, so are
the studios. At present there is a
very high enrollment and very
little space.”
