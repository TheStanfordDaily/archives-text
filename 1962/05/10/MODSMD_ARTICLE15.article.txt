# Cal Recaptures Medaille Joffre
## 
### 
Cal’s Alan Lerch recaptured
the Medaille Joffre for the Ber
keley school and evened the 68-
year debating series between
Stanford and Cal. Tuesday night
at Berkeley.
Larry Neal of Stanford placed
second and Jim Woolsey. also
from the Farm, was third, but
this was small consolation for the
Stanford supporters in the audi
ence of several hundred.
Lerch, along with Neal and
Stanford’s Keith Winsell, spoke
negatively on the proposition that
it would be in the best interests
of France to join a Western Eu
ropean Federation, involving the
surrender of political sovereignty.
He argued that it would be bet
ter for France to use her position
as head of the French Common
wealth to set up a “constructive”
neutral bloc. More than anything
else, his excellent oratorical man
ner won him the judges’ decision.
Neal argued negatively from a
different viewpoint, emphasizing
(the disastrous effects political
unification would have on
France’s armed forces, domestic
politics, and foreign policy. His
biting wit and well-constructed
argument won him the loudest
applause of the evening.
Woolsey, supporting unification,
along with two Cal speakers, em
phasized the dangers and failures
of nationalism.
