# Attempt to Inform Campus About NSA Will Start Today
## 
### 
A campus-wide campaign to discuss the merits of having Stan
ford in the National Student Association is getting under way
today with the circulation of a petition to put the issue up for
student referendum this quarter.
Approximately one hundred students, drawn by word-of-mouth

publicity, met Sunday night to
investigate the possibilities and
problems of Stanford’s member
ship in the N.S.A.. a confederation
of more than 400 American col
leges and universities.
AT THAT MEETING, Fred
Goff, one of a group of students
which has studied the N.S.A. pro
gram all year, outlined the steps
being taken to present the facts
and issues to the student body.
Monday, there will be an all
campus information meeting at
7:45 in Room 320, Geology Cor
ner. Denis Shaul, Rhodes scholar
and former student body presi
dent of Notre Dame, will fly out
to discuss aspects of international
student activities, and Ed Ger
main, student body president
elect of the University of Cali
fornia will discuss Cal’s partici
pation in the N.S.A.
BULLETINS AND reprints are
being prepared and several stu
dents will be available to discuss
the issue in living groups.
Dean Allard Lowenstein, a past
president of the N.S.A., invited
to explain the organization’s
structure and purposes at the
meeting Sunday, stressed the in
ternational work of the N.S.A.
and described it and student
unions of other non-communist
nations as the only effective coun
ter to an intensive world-wide
communist student movement.
HE SUGGESTED the relevance
of such a program for this cam
pus and pointed out that the
N.S.A. is Stanford’s only available
link with COSEC, the internation
al organization of non-communist
students.
Lowenstein also cited instances
in which, he believes, Stanford
has been isolated from major cur
rents of student thought and ac
tion in the United States. He
stressed the contributions which
he felt such issues would make to
the Stanford educational process
and the contributions which Stan
ford students could make to the
nation’s student organization.
.STANFORD WAS a mem Ik? r
of N.S.A. until about ten years
ago. At that time, the student
body voted to resign from the
association. Many students evi
dently now feel that Stanford
should consider rejoining and are
conducting this information cam
paign to make the campus aware
of the issue.
They have asked that all ob
jections to Stanford’s participa
tion be brought out immediately
so that they might be considered
carefully and fairly by the stu
dent body before the referendum
is presented.
Any Stanford students inter
ested in the N.S.A. have been in
vited to attend the N.S.A. Region
al Conference in Redlands the
weekend of May 19. Ralph Gil
man. sponsor in Arroyo House,
Wilbur Hall, has more informa
tion on the conference.
