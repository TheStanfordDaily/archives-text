# Vassars President And Morality' Issue
## 
### 
Vassar is in uproar about scv, or so it would seem; but when
the president of the college calls a compulsory assembly to tell
its women that they will be faced with “disciplinary action” for
having premarital sexual relations, the problem is not really one
of sex at all.
It seems acceptable enough for the president to call promis
cuity “indecent." That is a matter of personal opinion. But to
threaten disciplinary action for those who do not conform to
opinion is a different thing entirely.
The legislation of morality is a touchy and complicated busi
ness. It is something which ought not to be handled by college
authorities. A university purports to be educating students, which
implies that it teaches them to make personal decisions and to
take responsibility for them. A student recognizes societal and
comparable pressures; he (and she) need not be told to conform
or get out, especially not by an educational body.
Miss Blanding of Vassar has abdicated her own responsibility.
