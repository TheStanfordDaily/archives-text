## Ship of Fools A Cynical Catalog of Human Failings 
### STEPHEN BAILEY 
“A Ship of Fools,” by Katherine
Anno Porter: Atlantic - I,idle
Brown, $6.00, i!>7 pp.

Katherine Anne Porter’s new
novel “A Ship of Fools” is an ac
count of the voyage of a second
rate German passenger ship go
ing from Vera Cruz to Bremer
haven in the summer of 1931. The
story is an allegory of the sins
and vices of mankind, almost all
of them being represented by at
least one of the characters on the
ship.

Miss Porter is adept at por
traying the vices of her charac
ters; the worst of her characters
are the most vivid, and the more
innocuous ones are most out
standing when they are commit
ting their small vices.
SOMK OF THE most interest
ing characters are Jenny angel
and David darling, the young
American couple travelling for
the first time to Europe. They
are incapable of communicating
their own problems, which they
cannot solve by themselves, to
one another, and because they
cannot understand or communi
cate, they are cont'nually fight
ing and making up afterwards.
Wilhelm Freytag is a Herman
who married a Jewess at a par
ticularly inappropriate time, con
sidering the political situation,
he cannot reconcile himself to
his position, yet he does not know
how to fight against what he
rightly considers to be an evil,
and he ends by pitying himself
for his misfortunes.
The greatest faults of many of
the characters are their intoler
ance and prejudice, represented
by the almost universal distaste
of the people of one nationality
for those of another. Their intol
erance is generally caused by
their self-absorption and egotism,
making communication, under
standing and sympathy almost
impossible.
HERR REIBER is an excellent
caricature, although sometimes a
hit exaggerated, of a gross, sen
sualistic, animal-loving Jew-hater.

A Jew, Herr Lowenthal, is por
trayed as an equally prejudiced
man, partly responsible by his at
titudes towards the Gentiles for
their actions towards him.

The novel is rather plotless;
the action is showm in a series of
scenes which illustrates the pre
judices, the complacency, the self
ishness, the egotism, the stupid
ity, and the foolishness of the
characters. The descriptions are
very vivid and most of the char
acters are drawn well, if some
what superficially.
BUT THE BOOK seems largely
to be a rather cynical catalog
of human failings. Most of the
descriptions dwell on the sordid,
unpleasant actions, while the mer
itorious acts are passed over wit h
few words. One of the few unself
ish actions in the book, the sav
ing of a dog which had been
thrown overboard, was not used
at all to show the feelings of the
man who saved the dog—he is
almost completely ignored in the
novel—but it was used to show
the cynical or egotistic reactions
of some of the characters.

Miss Porter is correct in saying
that none of us is without some
fault, that all of us are guilty at
one time or another of stupidity,
selfishness, and lack of under
standing, but the presence of
these characteristics does not al
ways overbalance the virtues in

a man. The characters are little
changer! by their experiences on
their journey, and there is no in
dication that they can be changed.
It is a rather cold and hopeless
world that Miss Porter describes,
a world which seems to be full of
fools who get only what they de
serve because they are too selfish
and self-absorbed to be aware of
anything exeept their precious
selves, fools who deserve scorn
and mockery. This may be true,
but if it is, it is a rather sad
truth; the fools are more to be
pitied than laughed at.
“A Ship of Fools” is an interest
ing and well written novel, but I
cannot agree with what it seems
to say.
