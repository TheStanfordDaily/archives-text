# Student AMA to Urge Aged Care
## 
### 
Robert VV. Armstrong and John
O. Milligan, Stanford medical
students, left yesterday as dele
gates to the Student American
Medical Association convention in
Washington this week.
Armstrong and Milligan will in
troduce a resolution favoring the
controversial King-Anderson Bill.
Support for this bill was won
after a close contest in the Stan
ford chapter.
The King-Anderson Bill sup
ports medical care to the aged
through social security financing
and is favored by the Kennedy
administration. The A.M.A. claims
this bill will destroy the tradi
tional doctor-patient relationship
and will load to socialized medi
cine. The A.M.A. supports the
Kerr-Mill Bill which is financed
through state welfare agencies.
The local chapter of the
S.A.M.A., comprising over half
of the Stanford medical students,
also instructed the delegates to
introduce a resolution advocating
reforms in the drug industry.
By a largo majority, the local
chapter voted to support national
S.A.M.A. resolutions barring dis
crimination in medical societies
and hospitals and favoring fed
eral scholarships to medical stu
dents.
