TAR BABY
Editor, Tin* Daily:
I would like to he the first
among many to apply for mem
bership in Miss Skinner’s Causes
Rejected A Priori Club. After
reading 1 he qualifications out
lined in her column in Monday’s
Daily, I feel my cause qualifies
me for charter membership.
My cause is the “no-fated” pre
sophomore rush proposal of the
Wilbur sponsors, 1960-61. This
proposal to move rushing out of
the freshman year to avoid the
resulting chaos was the result of
many long hours of work and
careful thought on the part of the
sponsors. The proposal caused
much reaction In concerned cir
cles and stimulated discussion
towards finding an alternative to
the present system of rush. The
proposal was presented to the
administration for consideration
and, alas, like all lost causes, it
was neither rejected nor approv
ed. Nothing came from our muted
administration.
In reflecting on this and other
lost causes, I am reminded of
Uncle Remus’s “Wonderful Tar
Baby” for consolation. In this de
lightful tale, Brer Rabbit at
tempts to get an answer from
what has been made to appear as
a human. In the midst of his di
lemma, Brer Rabbit, like all other
lost causers, yells, “Is you deaf?
Kaze if you is, I kin holler loud
er.” But we waste our time, for
like Brer Rabbit, we fail to see
the issue in its broader setting.
For behind our Tar-Baby front
of fair play anrl straight-forward
ness hides Brer P'ox and “he lay
low.”
But unlike Miss Skinner, I ap
preciate the beauty of the admin
istration’s cleverness. An old
bureaucratic adage advises that
if you sit on all your px-oblems
for a month, most will disappear.
Change “a month” to “gradua
tion” and all becomes clear (won’t
this summer be great!). I know
what this says for the adminis
tration’s ingenuity but I am not
sure what it says for its integ
rity.

ISOLATIONISM ?
Editor, The Daily:
I wash to commend the percep
tive headline of Craig Barnes’
Thursday article: “Isolationism
Revived by Nixon’s Defeat.” The
principal shortcoming of the Ken
nedy foreign policy could hardly
be described more graphically.
For “one of the disturbing after
effects of Richard Nixon’s Presi
dential election defeat has been to
discourage moderation in foreign
affairs and to awaken and encour
age isolationism”- not in conserv
ative circles—but in the White
House itself.
Presumably, isolationism is the
fear or reluctance to commit the
economic or armed forces of the
United States abroad to either

honor her military commitments
or to further her posited national
objectives.
IF SO, WAS it not isolationism
for President Kennedy to bravely
proclaim: “We will defend Laos
whatever the risk and whatever
the cost”; and to stand idly by
while communist guerillas swept
across that nation?
And was it not isolationism for
the President to assure the
American people that “any dan
gerous spot is tenable if brave
men will make it so”; only to im
potently remark after the con
struction of the Berlin Wall:
“Why didn’t someone tell me this
could happen?”.
FEW RESPONSIBLE conserv
ative spokesmen could today be
accused of advocating such inex
cusable timidity. Senator Gold
water, John Rousselot, William F.
Buckley Jr.- all agree that if
American influence is not to he
beaten backwards “in hasty re
treat even nearer to our shores,"
more and not less American inter
vention in international affairs is
necessary. The United States
must ever be ready to defend any
non-communist nation against ag
gression: to extend technical as
sistance to any nation which re
veres the liberty and dignity of
the individual: and to aid any
people who are willing to free
themselves from communist dom
ination.
If the United Nations is willing
to work toward these objectives,
so much the better. If not, the
United States must be willing to
work without this body, the ma
jority of which is in the words of
James Burnham, “a momentary
amalgum of illiterate, semi-sav
age tribes, led by petty tyrants,
demogogues, slave runners, juju
addicts, and cannibals with an
Oxford accent.”
In the words of L. Brent Bozell:
“If we know what our mission is
... the orders will go out—
TO THE JOINT Chiefs of Staff:
‘Make the necessary preparations
for landing in Havana.’
To our commander in Berlin:

‘Tear down the Wall.’
To the Chief of the CIA: ‘You
are to encourage liberation move
ments in every nation of the
world under communist domina
tion, including the Soviet Union
itself. And you may let it be
known that when, in the future,
men offer their lives for the
ideals of the West, the West will
not stand idly by.’ ”
THIS is isolationism?

NOT AMERICANS
Editor, The llaily;
Since I came to Stanford Uni
versity, I have met a lot of peo
ple and have become intimate
with some of them. However,
most of them are not American
students. On campus I have made
friends - two Russians, one Pole,
one Finn, two Yugoslavs, two Pe
ruvians, one Chilean, one Mexi
san, four Chinese, one Norwegi
an, and lots of Japanese, but only
two Americans.
The ratio of foreign students
to American students, I think,
may be one to 10 or less, but the
ratio among my friends reaches
10 to one, or more, and I can
guess that this is common among
foreign students from other
countries.
This strange phenomenon is, 1
believe, caused partly by the fact
that it is hard for foreign stu
dents to understand American
English spoken quickly. How
ever, American students also
share the responsibility. This was
earlier pointed out by Dr. Warm
brunn in an article in The Daily
in which he referred to the shy
ness of American" students.
Concerning this shyness, I must
say that I also feel it and, more
over. I have a weak point. My
ability in English conversation is
not sufficient, so I cannot put my
self forward. Therefore, I think,
American students should always
remember the fact that most for
eign students are longing to
speak with them.
