So now it’s nearing
weekend date time,
and here’s a new R A
shirt that doubles for
dress wear, class
wear, or leisure time.
It’s the all-purpose
Manhattan Grip-Tab,
a comfortable, easy
fitting shirt with a
neat tab collar and
short sleeves, in white
oxford cloth only.
Under a jacket, it’s
perfect for an evening
on the town. Other
wise, trim and tradi
tional for campus
wear. A most intelli
gent, year-around
selection at R A's
5.00 tab.
