A KINGDOM (Plus a Queen) FOR
A WATCH!...it actually happened.
During the war, an American G.l.
traded his gold watch for an entire
South Sea island. (To sweeten the
deal, the tribal chief offered to in
clude his daughter.)
AN ELECTRIC WATCH FOR MEN, the
Hamilton 505, requires only ten bil
lionths (.00000001) of a horsepower!
Its tiny energy cell (pictured above)
lasts as long as two years without
replacement.
Looking for a really impressive watch?
The Hamilton 505 Electric for men is
the most advanced in the world, And
Hamilfons for ladies are truly lovely
things that can be worn on all occa
sions. The Hamilton Watch Company,
