# South Viet Nam Wastes U.S. Aid, Prof Charges
## 
### BILL REPPY 
Regardless of the war, living
conditions in South Viet Narn are

certain to start declining no later
than 1968 because national in
vestment in that Southeast Asian
country is failing to keep up with
the population growth.
Frank C. Child, visiting profes
sor of economics, explained this
threat to South Viet Nam last
night in a talk which concluded
the HR's “Southeast Asia in Re
view” scries.
The Viet Namese population is
increasing at the exceptionally
high rate of 3 per cent annually,
Child said. If the net national
product is to increase at the same
rate, 12 to 15 per cent of the in
come must bo invested each year.
Yet the 1960 figure was only 4.8
per cent Invested, Child said.
CHILI) BLAMED the problem
on the sanguine attitude of South
Viet Namese government officials
and United States representatives
in the country. He cited data
showing that instead of spending
U.S. aid, the government was
“hoarding” it.
“The government has accumu
lated a reserve sufficient to pay
for a full year’s needed imports
without any income from exports
at all,” he said. “Only Laos has a
relatively greater reserve.”
Child blasted this “hoarding of
money like a miser” as a “most
foolish national policy.”
IN' AUDI TIO N, individual
wealthy Viet Namese wore accu
mulating private hoards instead
of spending or investing. Thus,
although from 1957 to 1960 the
cost of living dropped and the
money supply increased, the in
flation that would normally fol
low did not occur because large
sums of money w'ere simply
frozen, Child explained.
The country has a great poten

tial for investment, he said. Re
sources—such as coal, hydro
electric potential, and fertile soil
that can grow two rice crops an
nually—arc plentiful; the people
are energetic; the land is not
overcrowded. Nevertheless, un
employment runs up to 23 per
cent.
HOW WAS the government
fooled into believing prosperity
was so high that Viet Nam could
afford to hoard foreign reserves?
Because there was indeed a great
economic boom from 1954, when
the French left the country, to
1958, Child said.
Following the war for inde
pendence Viet Nam was in eco
nomic chaos. Through reconstruc
tion. he explained, conditions rose
rapidly; but In reconstruction “a
little investment goes a long
way.” For example, the purchase
of one ruined machine may re
open a war-closed factory. It is
not surprising that an illusion of
prosperity was created, he sug
gested.

Regardless of the war, living
conditions in South Viet Narn are

certain to start declining no later
than 1968 because national in
vestment in that Southeast Asian
country is failing to keep up with
the population growth.
Frank C. Child, visiting profes
sor of economics, explained this
threat to South Viet Nam last
night in a talk which concluded
the HR's “Southeast Asia in Re
view” scries.
The Viet Namese population is
increasing at the exceptionally
high rate of 3 per cent annually,
Child said. If the net national
product is to increase at the same
rate, 12 to 15 per cent of the in
come must bo invested each year.
Yet the 1960 figure was only 4.8
per cent Invested, Child said.
CHILI) BLAMED the problem
on the sanguine attitude of South
Viet Namese government officials
and United States representatives
in the country. He cited data
showing that instead of spending
U.S. aid, the government was
“hoarding” it.
“The government has accumu
lated a reserve sufficient to pay
for a full year’s needed imports
without any income from exports
at all,” he said. “Only Laos has a
relatively greater reserve.”
Child blasted this “hoarding of
money like a miser” as a “most
foolish national policy.”
IN' AUDI TIO N, individual
wealthy Viet Namese wore accu
mulating private hoards instead
of spending or investing. Thus,
although from 1957 to 1960 the
cost of living dropped and the
money supply increased, the in
flation that would normally fol
low did not occur because large
sums of money w'ere simply
frozen, Child explained.
The country has a great poten

tial for investment, he said. Re
sources—such as coal, hydro
electric potential, and fertile soil
that can grow two rice crops an
nually—arc plentiful; the people
are energetic; the land is not
overcrowded. Nevertheless, un
employment runs up to 23 per
cent.
HOW WAS the government
fooled into believing prosperity
was so high that Viet Nam could
afford to hoard foreign reserves?
Because there was indeed a great
economic boom from 1954, when
the French left the country, to
1958, Child said.
Following the war for inde
pendence Viet Nam was in eco
nomic chaos. Through reconstruc
tion. he explained, conditions rose
rapidly; but In reconstruction “a
little investment goes a long
way.” For example, the purchase
of one ruined machine may re
open a war-closed factory. It is
not surprising that an illusion of
prosperity was created, he sug
gested.
