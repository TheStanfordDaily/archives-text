# University Declines To Finance Helsinki
## 
### NILS WESSELL Associate Editor 
Whether a group of Stanford
students will attend the Commu
nist-sponsored Helsinki Youth
Festival is uncertain at this time.
The University has refused to fi
nance the project. In the
words of Dean H. Donald Win
bigler, “it is not feasible for this
to be a university-sponsored proj
ect.”
Nancy Sherwood, administra
tive assistant to the President of
HR, said, “Wo may be able to dig
up some private support, but
nothing has been decided” about
who will finance the project or
how anyone will attempt to fi
nance it. either through HR or as
private individuals.
Early yesterday afternoon the
situation was this: if the State
Department were to disapprove
of the project or if the Stanford
trustees were to decline responsi
bility for financing it, the project
would not be undertaken.
EAST NIGHT, neither the State
Department nor the trustees had
been heard from. The trustees
will not meet until next Thurs
day, and the University adminis
tration would not or could not
say what the State Department’s
attitude was. No one in the HR
claimed to be informed on the
Department’s attitude.
Lyle Nelson, Director of Uni
versity Relations, has just re
turned from Washington where

he conferred with the State De
partment. Nelson was unavail
able for comment last night.
According to Miss Sherwood,
the project’s purpose is non-polit
ical, but it is difficult for the Uni
versity to finance a project so
easily subject to being miscon
strued. It is hard for the Univer
sity, as a non-political educational
institution, to say that it will fi
nance a group of its students at
tending a Communist youth fes
tival, Miss Sherwood said.
OF THE 400 Stanford appli
cants, 72 have received, or will re
ceive today, notification of ac
ceptance as tentative delegates.
Dean Winbigler gave his approv
al to those who were selected.
Their names will not be publish
ed until word has been received
from the State Department as to
some form of security clearance.
Two Communist youth groups
are sponsoring the World Festi
val, from July 27 to August 5, at
which time they propagate the
Communist line, especially to stu
dents from uncommitted coun
tries.
At present there is still another
problem, since applications from
the 72 Stanford students must be
submitted for acceptance to the
U.S. Festival Committee by next
Tuesday, and an application fee
of $6O per person must be sent to
the Committee.
MISS SHERWOOD said that
the Stanford students will ask for
reservations on the American
delegation anyway and that it is
hoped that money will be raised
quickly to cover the application

fees.
Still another problem arises
since the Finnish government will
not tolerate any “anti-Festival”
activity, and it might judge as
anti-Festival an American dele
gation intending to put across too
vociferously the American point
of view. Therefore, the American
delegation cannot present itself
as flag-waving anti-Communists.
Whether those parts of the
American delegation needing to
raise money will bo able to find
philanthropists willing to finance
a group practicing objectivity and
not partisanship is uncertain.
According to Miss Sherwood,
the criteria for selection were ob
jectivity, an ability to empathize
with other people, and command
of facts and special skills, in that
order of importance.
THE PURPOSE of the project
is “to send to Helsinki a group of
individuals who are objective and
who have the ability to criticize
and praise their own government
wherever they feel it necessary
no matter what the official
American policy may bo, and
who can do the same for any
foreign government,” Miss Sher
wood said.

OF THE 400 Stanford appli
cants, 72 have received, or will re
ceive today, notification of ac
ceptance as tentative delegates.
Dean Winbigler gave his approv
al to those who were selected.
Their names will not be publish

from the State Department as to
some form of security clearance.
Two Communist youth groups
are sponsoring the World Festi
val, from July 27 to August 5, at
which time they propagate the
Communist line, especially to stu
dents from uncommitted coun
tries.
At present there is still another
problem, since applications from
the 72 Stanford students must be
submitted for acceptance to the
U.S. Festival Committee by next
Tuesday, and an application fee
of $6O per person must be sent to
the Committee.
MISS SHERWOOD said that
the Stanford students will ask for
reservations on the American
delegation anyway and that it is
hoped that money will be raised
quickly to cover the application

fees.
Still another problem arises
since the Finnish government will
not tolerate any “anti-Festival”
activity, and it might judge as
anti-Festival an American dele
gation intending to put across too
vociferously the American point
of view. Therefore, the American
delegation cannot present itself
as flag-waving anti-Communists.
Whether those parts of the
American delegation needing to
raise money will bo able to find
philanthropists willing to finance
a group practicing objectivity and
not partisanship is uncertain.
According to Miss Sherwood,
the criteria for selection were ob
jectivity, an ability to empathize
with other people, and command
of facts and special skills, in that
order of importance.
THE PURPOSE of the project
is “to send to Helsinki a group of
individuals who are objective and
who have the ability to criticize
and praise their own government
wherever they feel it necessary
no matter what the official
American policy may bo, and
who can do the same for any
foreign government,” Miss Sher
wood said.
Whether a group of Stanford
students will attend the Commu
nist-sponsored Helsinki Youth
Festival is uncertain at this time.

to be a university-sponsored proj

Nancy Sherwood, administra

HR, said, “Wo may be able to dig

private individuals.
Early yesterday afternoon the
situation was this: if the State
Department were to disapprove
of the project or if the Stanford
trustees were to decline responsi
bility for financing it, the project
would not be undertaken.
EAST NIGHT, neither the State
Department nor the trustees had
been heard from. The trustees
will not meet until next Thurs
