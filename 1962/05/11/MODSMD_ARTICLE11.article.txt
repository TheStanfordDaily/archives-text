MARK DRAPER, NEW OLD BOY, awaits a congratulary interview
with Dean, after the Chaparral announced today his election by
the members of the Hammer and Coffin Society to the office of
Chappie editor. Said Draper, "I think the Chappie should serve as
kind of a springboard for campus opinion. We want to do like our
student leader does and sting people (right where it hurts, get it?
ha, ha.) into being an intellectual. The Chappie should be an intellectual too. Magazine, I mean. Maybe we could merge with Krino
or something like that. Of course, this being an intellectual is
serious stuff and so we got to quit making it with the jokes. No
more humor. Too bad, huh?" Rest of editorial board to be elected
next fall.
