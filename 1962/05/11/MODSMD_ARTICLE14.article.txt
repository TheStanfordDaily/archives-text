# With the N.Y. Times, A New Dimension
## 
### 
A new clement will soon be introduced into the San Francisco
area race for newspaper subscribers. This new element is news.
I In* arrival of a West Coast edition of tin* New York Times will
mercifully add tin's new dimension to the bay Area’s newspaper
circulation wars.
'I hose whose business it is to discover new techniques to add
to their papers subscription roles and those who are discouraged
at the forms these new techniques often take will be carefully
watching the acceptance of the Times by Western readers. It is
profoundly to be hoped that large amounts of news as provided
by (he world’s best single gatherer of it can be as potent a sub
scription builder as Count Marco, Ann Landers and Barry Cold
water,
It should be recognized that the experiment being undertaken
by tin* Times may be the last stand of the big city competitive
newspaper. The number of cities left with more than one paper
today is tiny and growing smaller yearly. Cities the size of Min
neapolis and New Orleans are monopoly newspaper ownerships
today.

The New York Times is the first new daily paper to appear in
San Francisco in nearly 40 years. If it fails here it will be the last
and the situation can only deteriorate. If it succeeds it will prob
ably open national editions in other parts of the country and
other large papers will be likely to follow suit. This would be the
best thing to happen to American journalism in years. Local
papers would have to meet the higher competitive standards or
they would die. Most would make an attempt at improvement.
If Western readers will accept news as a criterion for buying
a newspaper, the New York Times will succeed here. If it fails it
will be because the newspaper is being replaced. It would be a
terrible loss.
