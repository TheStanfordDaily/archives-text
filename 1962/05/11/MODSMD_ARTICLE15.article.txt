# 2/5 OF THE NATION

filling; in for Walter Lippmann.)

Back in the 30s, Franklin Del
ano Roosevelt stirred America
with his declaration that “one
third of the nation was ill-housed,
ill-fed and ill-clothed.”
Today, almost three decades
later, Economist Leon Keyserling,
who was head of President Tru
man’s Council of Economic Ad
visers, has completed a study
which shows that almost 40 per
cent of America still lives in pov
erty and deprivation.
THESE FIGURES are so star
tling that I found them hard to
believe at first. I still find it in
credible that in a nation which
has made the technological and
scientific advances we have, that
there has been so much neglect of
a vital segment of the economy.
Mr. Keyserling’s study has been
published by the Conference on
Economic Progress and bears the
title “Poverty and Deprivation In
the U.S.” It is factual and care
fully-documented, which makes it
all the more devastating.
There are great debates now go
ing on inside the administration
as to what we should be doing
about low economic growth and
chronic unemployment. The rec
ord. to date, is not very impres
sive. But about the facts there
seems to be no argument.
WHAT ARE the facts?
There are some 38 million
Americans with incomes under
$2,000 per year and families with
under $4,000 per year. That is the
description of what constitutes
poverty in 1962. Another 39 mil
lion Americans live in “depriva
tion,” which means individual
incomes of $2,000 to $2,999 per
year and families with incomes
of $4,000 to $5,999 per year.
This means that there are 77
million Americans—or two-fifths
of the nation—living at substand
ard levels.
THIS HARDLY sounds like the
“affluent society.” The Keyser
ling report notes with some dis
paragement the conclusion of
Prof. John K. Galbraith that pov
erty in the U.S. is no longer a
“massive affliction.” Galbraith
said it is more nearly “an after
thought.”

I Unfortunately that seems to be
I the attitude at high levels in the
j government and the Keyserling
study dissents vigorously:
“But this soothing conclusion
is based upon treating as living in
poverty those families with in
comes of less than $l,OOO a year,
contrasted with the $4,000 which
many authorities fix as the
amount required to place the mul
tiple-person family above poverty
in the American context today.”
THE POINT seems well-taken.
How many individuals, let alone
families, could live on $l,OOO a
year? Common sense rejects that
as a standard by which to mea
sure the degree of national want.
What Mr. Keyserling finds dis
tressing is the “growing compla
cency about the poverty and de
privation still in our midst.”
While he advocates the adminis
tration’s foreign trade program
he believes that this would be in
significant as a remedy for what
ails the nation. The most he can
see, assuming its approval, is
about another $3 billions coming
in through the development of
overseas markets.
But what actually we need, ac
cording to Mr. Keyserling, is an
other $5O billion and eventualy
another $lOO billion increased
production. If we were just to
look homeward, in his judgment,
we would discover that we have
an immense underdevoleped
market. Ho would give high pri
ority to meeting the needs of
these 77 million Americans.
“LIFTING THE living stand
ards of these 77 million is not only
imperative in human terms, but
also is the key to maximum em
ployment and production and
more rapid economic growth,”
Keyserling has said.
It is ironic that a top Demo
crat should be using words like
“complacency” and “soothing” to
describe the non-activities of a
Democratic administration. But
the hullaballoo about the trade
program and the Kennedy “vic
tory” over Big Steel seems to
have diverted us from the real
and nagging domestic problems
that still exist.
Maybe we need a Marshall Plan
for the United States.
