INSIDE DOPE
Editor, The Daily:
Until Mr. Weinig’s letter of
yesterday, I had not been aware
of the extent to which our na
tion’s communication media have
been held in the vice-like grasp
of unscrupulous liberal fanatics
—a conspiracy which has clearly
kept vital information from the
American public.
Undoubtedly, the President’s re
vealing quote concerning the Ber
lin Wall, “Why didn’t someone
tell me this could happen?” would
have appeared on rront pages of
newspapers across the nation if it
weren’t for the fact that these
institutions have traditionally
been bastions of strength for the
Democratic Party. How fortunate
that a responsible conservative
such as Mr. Weinig has pierced
the veil of secrecy and gained ac
cess to this damaging statement,
as well as to the inside dope that
American soldiers aren’t really
dying in Laos after all.
Our communications media
have further kept from us the
fact that our “posited national ob
jectives” include the conse
quences which would stem from
the tearing down of the Berlin
Wall. Of course it would be blas
phemy indeed to question the
opinions of such an international
ly respected political analyst as
L. Brent Borell.

I am further certain that the
ringing indictment of the UN,
quoted from the equally renown

ed Mr. Burnham, has totally dev- 1
astated the leaders of that or-1
ganization. The charlatans have
no choice but to disband their
demagogues, slave runners, juju
addicts and cannibals.”
Allow me to offer a quote that
might be familiar to Mr. Weinig.
Hubert Humphrey in Mem And
last quarter had just finished cor
recting a series of totally fallaci
ous contentions by a misguided
undergrad in the first row. He
concluded by saying, “You’re a
student. You're supposed to seek
the truth. Well, look for it; it isn’t
very hard to find.”

KINDRED SOl'L
Editor, The Daily:
You should introduce Judy
Skinner and her fellow mourners
after Lost Causes to' a kindred
soul from an earlier age: F. M.
Cornford, scholar of the classics

| in Britain.
In his brilliant little book |
(1906), “Microcosmographia Aca-:
demica, Being a Guide for the j
Young Academic Politician,” one
finds such consolation as the fol
lowing:
“A principle is a rule of inac
tion, which states a valid general
reason for not doing in any par
ticular case what, to unprincipled
instinct, would appear to be
right.”
“The best way to protect the
young from books is, first, to
make sure that they shall be so
dry as to offer no temptation;
and second, to store them in such
, away that no one can find them
j without several years’ training.”
George D. Green
