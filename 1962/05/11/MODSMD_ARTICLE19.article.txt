vored to repeat with a victory to
morrow.

The lineup for the alumni is
studded with former Stanford
gridiron heroes. Although John

Brodie. passing star for the In
dians in 1954-56, is a doubtful
starter, seniors Rod Sears and
Chuck Butler will provide plenty
of aerial scoring punch.
All-American (1953) Sam Mor
ley leads several outstanding
alumni ends. Chris Burford and
Irv Nickolai, top Indian pass
catchers three seasons ago, along
with Carl Isaacs will provide the
other end of what looks to he a
deadly passing attack.
IN THE BACKFIELD will be
Chuck Shea, all-PCC fullback in
1957, and Hal Steuber, a big
ground-gainer for Stanford last
year, both at fullback. Skip Race,
A1 Harrington, and Rick McMil
len, all recent lettermen, will pro
vide depth at the halfback posi
tion.

greats as Troy Barbee, Paul Wig
gin, Phil Burkland, Norm Mano
ogian, {lean Hinshaw, and gradu
ating seniors, Chris Cottle. Tom
Walsh, and Errol Scott will bol

in talent. At fullback will be Tony
DeLollis, the halfbacks will be
Gary Sargeant, and either Tyco
Fitzmorris, Dick Shaw, Gary
Craig, or Stan Lindskog. Calling
the signals at quarterback will be
Jim Smith. Six other lettermen
are on hand for r’eserve strength.
If the alumni concentrate heavi
ly on a pass offense, the Cards
might find themselves in trouble.
The varsity’s aerial defenses
need sharpening, according to as
sistant coac;h Loon McLaughlin,
but the Cards should rise to the
occasion and block any serious
alum pass threats.
The game will see many substi
tutions, as both teams will empty
their benches to give the alums a
crack at more glory and give the
varsity some valuable playing ex
perience.

other end of what looks to he a
deadly passing attack.
IN THE BACKFIELD will be
Chuck Shea, all-PCC fullback in
1957, and Hal Steuber, a big
ground-gainer for Stanford last
year, both at fullback. Skip Race,
A1 Harrington, and Rick McMil

ogian, {lean Hinshaw, and gradu
ating seniors, Chris Cottle. Tom
Walsh, and Errol Scott will bol
ster the alum forward wall.
Coach Jack Curtice and his as
sistants are well prepared for any
alumni fireworks. The varsity

Craig, or Stan Lindskog. Calling
the signals at quarterback will be
Jim Smith. Six other lettermen
are on hand for r’eserve strength.
If the alumni concentrate heavi
ly on a pass offense, the Cards
might find themselves in trouble.
The varsity’s aerial defenses
need sharpening, according to as
sistant coac;h Loon McLaughlin,
but the Cards should rise to the
occasion and block any serious
alum pass threats.
The game will see many substi
tutions, as both teams will empty
their benches to give the alums a
crack at more glory and give the
varsity some valuable playing ex
perience.
A strong and experienced alum
ni learn will pit its passing game
against the varsity’s superior line
and running attack in the fourth

As many as 51 alumni players,
eight of them from last year’s

vored to repeat with a victory to
morrow.

The lineup for the alumni is
studded with former Stanford
gridiron heroes. Although John
