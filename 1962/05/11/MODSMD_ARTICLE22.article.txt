# Indians Seek Second Cal Cricket Victory
## 
### 
Stanford hosts Cal in cricket
tomorrow on the rugby field in a
match beginning at 9 a.m. and
lasting until 6 p.m., with a break
for lunch. In a previous match
this year between the two schools,
Stanford, 2-1-2 last year, beat Cal
by about 30 runs.
Expected to supply most of
Stanfordâ€™s runs are batsmen Da
vid Pike. Dhanjoo Ghista. George
Beckford, and Salaya. Peter Fa
ber, who bowled an excellent last
frame against Cal last time, will
bowl again for the Indians.
