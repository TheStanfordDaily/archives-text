“Perhaps you have cause to be
apprehensive due to certain state
ments thrown about, some more
responsible than others," ASSU
President-elect Armin Rosen
cranz told LASSU last night. He
then sketched his programs for
next year In a question-answer
session.
President Sterling is not recep
tive to changes in the liquor poli
cy. but might be more amenable
if students enforce the change,
Rosencranz said.
HK PROPOSED to appoint Da
vid French as SLAP, short for
Special Liquor Assistant to the
President, “to slap down all liquor
policy offenders.”
A member of the GRIP, or
Group with Real Inside Power,
Armin's cabinet, will investigate
joining NSA, he stated. “I see no
reason for not joining NSA, but
I am open to argument . . . This
post endorses the possibility of
joining,” Armin added.
Some of the humor of the cam
paign will be carried into his ad
ministration, but his administra
tion will be responsible, ho said:
“We will bring student opinion
effectively, either emphatically or
diplomatically, to the Adminis
tration.”
ROSENCRANZ proposed giv
ing groups like HR. Poli Union
and the Daily as much freedom
as possible for two reasons: these
organizations contain very good
people able to oversee them
selves; and many organizations
will be less subject to Adminis
tration interference when auton
omous than when they are under
LASSU.
He would not approve 40 per
cent grad representation in
LASSU, as “grad students usu
ally have other things than stu
dent government to occupy their
interests.”
“I WANT to commit myself as
little as possible this quarter, as
I am not yet in office and I have
academic responsibilities,” Rosen
cranz said.
Jock Mcßaine, chairman as
ASSU President Bob Sayler was
gone, ordered, “Back to busy
work,” after Rosencranz left,
LASSU approved HR, Rally Com
and Concert Series officers and
sent proposed changes in Rally
Com, Cardinals and Flying Club
bylaws to committee.
Budgets for executive, Judicial
Council, AWS Board, Rally Com
and Speech Association were ap
proved.
