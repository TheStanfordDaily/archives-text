### RICK BARRETT 
“There are those acts which
are inhuman and when one is
confronted with such an action
one must respond,” stated Hal
Stallings last night as he discuss
ed the reasons why the Commit
tee for Non-Violent Action
(CNVA) is sending the ship
“Everyman” into the U.S. nuclear
test zone.
Mr. Stallings said that the pri
mary goal of the trip was not
only the stopping of the tests,
but in a larger perspective con
vincing the government that be
cause the present policy of the
government is unsuccessful a new
one must be adopted. It is hoped
that the “Everyman” will be a
symbol of everyman in all coun
tries. The largest publicity is ex
pected to come from those coun
tries I Asian and South Ameri
can) that are not conducting tests
of their own and thus are unin
volved in the current arms race.
The “Everyman” also seeks to
test the legality of the recent
AEC ruling which makes entry
into the test zone and conspiracy
to commit such an act illegal.
This ruling is felt to be in direct
contravention to accepted interna
tional maritime law. Mr. Stallings
in his stand with the CNVA main
tained that the twenty-five hun
dred-mile voyage of the “Every
man” is an “experiment” in non
violence and not merely a pub
licity stunt.
Mr. Stallings worked with the
Quakers when he was younger
and at that time he felt ho should
try the “intelligent” approach.
He debated with Herman Kahn of
the Rand Co. and states that he
lost every encounter. Ho feels
that this approach of attempting
to contact more people by an

emotionally symbolic act is of
more value than winning a hand
ful of private debates.
The group hopes that the ship
will be met outside the nuclear
test-zone by ships from other
countries and that there will be a
simultaneous entrance into the
zone. He staled that NCV also
contemplates flying a plane into
the Russian land testing.

more value than winning a hand
ful of private debates.
The group hopes that the ship
will be met outside the nuclear
test-zone by ships from other
countries and that there will be a
simultaneous entrance into the
zone. He staled that NCV also
contemplates flying a plane into
the Russian land testing.
“There are those acts which
are inhuman and when one is
confronted with such an action
one must respond,” stated Hal
Stallings last night as he discuss
ed the reasons why the Commit
tee for Non-Violent Action
(CNVA) is sending the ship
“Everyman” into the U.S. nuclear
test zone.
Mr. Stallings said that the pri
mary goal of the trip was not
only the stopping of the tests,
but in a larger perspective con
vincing the government that be
cause the present policy of the
government is unsuccessful a new
one must be adopted. It is hoped
that the “Everyman” will be a
symbol of everyman in all coun
tries. The largest publicity is ex
pected to come from those coun
tries I Asian and South Ameri
can) that are not conducting tests
of their own and thus are unin
volved in the current arms race.
The “Everyman” also seeks to
test the legality of the recent
AEC ruling which makes entry
into the test zone and conspiracy
to commit such an act illegal.
This ruling is felt to be in direct
contravention to accepted interna
tional maritime law. Mr. Stallings
in his stand with the CNVA main
tained that the twenty-five hun
dred-mile voyage of the “Every
man” is an “experiment” in non
violence and not merely a pub
licity stunt.
Mr. Stallings worked with the
Quakers when he was younger
and at that time he felt ho should
try the “intelligent” approach.
He debated with Herman Kahn of
the Rand Co. and states that he
lost every encounter. Ho feels
that this approach of attempting
to contact more people by an

emotionally symbolic act is of
more value than winning a hand
ful of private debates.
