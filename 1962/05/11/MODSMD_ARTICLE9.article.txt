# NSA Wants Concerned Leadership
## 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
The National Student Association (NSA)
is a confederation of American college and
university student governments. Delegates
from member schools, elected by their stu
dent bodies, choose its officers and decide its
policies.
The primary purposes of the NSA are:
to represent students of the United States
in international Student Unions; to provide
a forum for discussion of problems common
to American students on their different cam
puses; to aid student governments in carry
ing out their own programs; and to promote
a concerned and intelligent campus leader
ship in international, national and campus
affairs which directly affect students.
TIIK NSA HAS been endorsed by Richard
M. Nixon, John F. Kennedy, Ralph Bundle,
Adlai Stevenson, and Dwight D. Eisenhower,
among others.
Eisenhower stated, "By making possible
ever greater opportunity for (he exorcise of
democratic responsibility on the campus, and
by enabling American students and students
ol other lands to work together toward the
solution of their common problems, the
United States National Student Association
is rendering a significant service to the

people of this country and to the world.”
The NSA functions by means of a stand
ing Executive Committee and a yearly con
gress of delegates from member schools. At
the congress, delegates are divided into four
groups, and each of these groups is further
divided into sub-committees. Issue before the
Congress are discussed in committee, and
are then given a priority for the all-Congress
discussion. The committees make a recom
mendation on each issue, and the most con-
I troversial ones are given highest priority.
THE CONGRESS HAS taken stands on
such things as segregation in United States
I education, academic freedom and interna
-1 tional student relations. In the voting, each
' school may concur, disagree, or abstain, and
Most of the decisions of the Congress rc
t his decision is then recorded,
suit in some form of mandate to tho Execu
tive Committee, NSA’s officers. A mandate
can instruct the officers to write letters to
people who might be effective on a certain
question, to have information distributed to
the campuses, or to do anything which might
bo effective in getting action or communica
tion on a student-related problem.
To implement the mandates of the Con
gress delegates, the Executive Committee

carries on year-round programs. It is in
carrying out these programs that the indi
vidual campuses can get the most out oi
NSA.

INFORMATION AN ALL NSA issues is
collected and distributed, and various proj
ects with foreign students are continually in
operation. One of these projects is hosting
as many as 200 foreign student leaders, who
come to the United States for short-term
visits. Another is the International Student
Relations Seminars for United States student
leaders from member schools.
On the national level, commissions are
set up on member campuses to study issues
ranging from athletic scholarships to aca
demic freedom.
In all of these areas, it is individual student
initiative which makes, or fails to make NSA
effective. The NSA’s brochure on the inter
national program states this best: “Individ
ual students are the key to the success of
USNSA on the campus, for without curious
and energetic student leaders, no USNSA
program would work well ... (it) is built
to serve its constituents, but that service is
evident only when a willing and concerned
campus leadership adapts USNSA’s program
suggestions to its own situation.
