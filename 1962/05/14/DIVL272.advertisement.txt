CRAM COURSE NO. 5; SHAKESPEARE
Continuing our series of pre-final exam cram courses, today we
take up the works of William Shakespeare (or “The Bard of
Avon” as he is jocularly called).
First let us examine the persistent theory that Shakespeare
(or “1 he Pearl of the Antilles” as he is affectionately referred
to) is not the real author of his plays. Advocates of this theory
insist that the plays are so full of classical allusions and learned
references that they couldn’t possibly have been written by
the son of an illiterate country butcher.
To which I reply, “Faugh!” Was not the great Spinoza’s
father a humble woodcutter? Was not the immortal Isaac
Newton’s father a simple second baseman? (The elder New ton,
incidentally, is one of history’s truly pathetic figures. He was,
by all accounts, the greatest second baseman of his time, but
baseball, alas, had not yet been invented.) It used to break
young Isaac’s heart to see his father get up every morning, put
on uniform, spikes, glove, and cap, and stand alertly behind
second base, bent forward, eyes narrowed, waiting, waiting,
waiting. That’s all—waiting. Isaac loyally sat in the bleachers
and yelled, “Good show, Dud!” and stuff like that, but every
one else in town used to snigger and pelt the Newtons with
overripe fruit—figs for the elder Newton, apples for the younger.
’I hus, as we all know, the famous occasion came about when
Isaac Newton, struck in the head with an apple, leapt to his
feet, shouted, “Europa!” and announced the third law of
motion: “For every action there is an opposite and equal
reaction!”
(How profoundly true these simple words arc! Take, for
example, Marlboro Cigarettes. Light one. That’s the action.
Now what is the reaction? Pleasure, delight, contentment, cheer,
and comfort! And why such a happy reaction? Because you have
vsemuMs,
starteil with a happy cigarette—a felicitous blend of jolly to
baccos, a good-natured filter, a rollicking flip-top box, a merry
soft pack. As Newton often said, “You begin with better
niakin s, you end with better srnokin’s.” Small wonder they
called him “The Swedish Nightingale!”).
But I digress. Back to Shakespeare (or “The* Gem of the
Ocean” as he was ribaldly appelated).
Shakespeare’s most important play is, of course, Hamlet (or
Macbeth, as it is sometimes called). This play tells in living
color the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who one night
sees a ghost upon the battlements. (Possibly it is a goat he
sees: I have a first folio edition that is frankly not too legible.)
Anyhow, Hamlet is so upset by seeing the ghost (or goat) that
he stabs Polonius and Bare Bodkin. He is thereupon banished
to a leather factory by the King, who cries, “Get thee to a
tannery!” Thereupon Ophelia refuses her food until Laertes
shouts, "Get thee to a beanery!” Ophelia is so miffed that she
chases her little dog out of the room, crying, “Out, out damned
Spot!” She is fined fifty shillings for swearing, but Portia, in
an eloquent plea, gets the sentence commuted to life imprison
ment. Thereupon King Lear and Queen Mab proclaim a festi
val-complete with amateur theatricals, kissing games, and a
pie-eating contest. Everyone has a perfectly splendid time till
Bauquo’s ghost (or goat) shows up. This so unhinges Richard
HI that he drowns his cousin, Butt Malmsey. This leads to a
lively discussion during which everyone is killed. The little dog
Spot returns to utter the immortal curtain lines:
Alack, tin plan forsooth was sad ami nobby,
But be of cheer—there's Marlboros in the lobby!
® 196 ii Max Hhulman

.Is the slings and cirrous of outrageous finals loom closer,
pci chance the makers of Marlboro are not untoward to offer
this friendly suggestion: Get thee to a library!
