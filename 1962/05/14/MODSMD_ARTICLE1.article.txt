# Plans of Delegates To Youth Festival Remain Uncertain
## 
### NILS WESSELL Associate Editor 
By Friday il should he known
whether a group of Stanford stu
dents will he going to the Com
munist-sponsored Helsinki World
Youth Festival.

Of the 72 students originally ac
cepted as tentative delegates, 25
have been selected to apply to the
U.S. Festival Committee for ac
ceptance as delegates to the Fes
tival.
ENOUGH FUNDS are being
sought to finance at least 55 stu-

dents and ideally all 72. Those
who were not asked to apply to
the U.S. Festival Committee will
go as observers if enough money
is raised.

Il is still not apparent whether
there will be enough to finance
even the 25 delegates although
newly-elected HR President Scot
ty Thompson is optimistic that
funds from private sources will
be available by Friday. The 23
delegates have already found
enough cash on their own to
send the SSO-ahead application
fee to the U.S. Festival Commit
tee.

Having reserved only 15 places
for Stanford students on the
American delegation, the U.S.
Festival Committee is asking the
International Preparatory Com
mittee for extra places on the
delegation, which, otherwise
would have no more openings.

When the 72 students meet to
morrow night, a plan will bo pre
sented for the election of commit
tees that will assign reading lists
and make preparations for living
in Helsinki.
FINANCES WILL be handled
by a committee of three, Joel
Moister, Scotty Thompson and
Nancy Sherwood. This committee
was self-appointed, not elected,
because “the people donating
have put their trust in the three
of us,” Miss Sherwood said. Me
ister, Thompson and Miss Sher
wood originated the project and
have made preliminary financial
contacts.

Tentative plane reservations
have been made for July 24 to
Helsinki. Reading lists are now
being drawn up by the students
who intend to go to the Festival.
It is hoped that all those who
are planning to go will use these
lists as a basis for gaining a bet
ter understanding of the world,
its peoples and its problems, ac
cording to Miss Sherwood.
A short reading period supple
mented with seminars may be
held for those interested shortly
before the Festival. Concentra
tion would be placed on discus
sion and study of world problems
and of the international student
movement.
It is not clear which of two al
ternatives will be preferred if
only limited funds arc available:
sending a maximum number of
students to Helsinki with mini
mal previous orientation or send
ing a smaller number of students
who have had extensive orienta
tion.

THE FESTIVAL is being spon
sored from July 27 to August 5
by two Communist youth organi
sations, the World Federation of
Democratic Youth and the Inter
national Union of Students. Al
though not entirely Communist,
the official administrator, the In
ternational Preparatory Commit
tee (IPCI is Communist-oriented,
Miss Sherwood said.
The U.S. Festival Committee,
sponsor of the American delega
tion to the Vienna Festival in 1959,
has been recognized by the IPC
to select the American delegation.
The political complexion of this
year’s Committe is unknown and
is possibly more moderate than
in 1959 when its membership was
dominated by alleged fellow-trav
elers.

There are, apparently, no ide
ological criteria by which the
U.S. Festival Committee judges
applicants. "First come, first
served” seems to be the proce
dure. according to Miss Sher
wood.

WHILE THE IPC does not over
see the acceptance of individual
American delegates and will not
refuse them acceptance, there is
always a possibility that creden
tials might be taken away at the
Festival from anyone indulging
in American flag-waving.
The Festival will include large
seminars on political and social
issues as well as athletic compe
tition and cultural activities.

The Finnish government has
forbidden anti-Festival activity
and is extending hospitality to
the Festival although originally
it was opposed to having the Fes
tival in Finland unless the Fin-

nish student union was willing.
Although the union was unwill
ing. the IPC went ahead anyway
and set up in Helsinki. For Fin
land to speak out against the Fes
tival would compromise its for
eign policy of neutrality, it is be
lieved.

sented for the election of commit
tees that will assign reading lists
and make preparations for living
in Helsinki.
FINANCES WILL be handled
by a committee of three, Joel
Moister, Scotty Thompson and
Nancy Sherwood. This committee
was self-appointed, not elected,
because “the people donating
have put their trust in the three
of us,” Miss Sherwood said. Me
ister, Thompson and Miss Sher
wood originated the project and
have made preliminary financial
contacts.

Tentative plane reservations
have been made for July 24 to
Helsinki. Reading lists are now
being drawn up by the students
who intend to go to the Festival.
It is hoped that all those who
are planning to go will use these
lists as a basis for gaining a bet
ter understanding of the world,
its peoples and its problems, ac
cording to Miss Sherwood.
A short reading period supple
mented with seminars may be
held for those interested shortly
before the Festival. Concentra
tion would be placed on discus
sion and study of world problems
and of the international student
movement.
It is not clear which of two al
ternatives will be preferred if
only limited funds arc available:
sending a maximum number of
students to Helsinki with mini
mal previous orientation or send
ing a smaller number of students
who have had extensive orienta
tion.

THE FESTIVAL is being spon
sored from July 27 to August 5
by two Communist youth organi
sations, the World Federation of
Democratic Youth and the Inter
national Union of Students. Al
though not entirely Communist,
the official administrator, the In
ternational Preparatory Commit
tee (IPCI is Communist-oriented,
Miss Sherwood said.
The U.S. Festival Committee,
sponsor of the American delega
tion to the Vienna Festival in 1959,
has been recognized by the IPC
to select the American delegation.
The political complexion of this
year’s Committe is unknown and
is possibly more moderate than
in 1959 when its membership was
dominated by alleged fellow-trav
elers.

There are, apparently, no ide
ological criteria by which the
U.S. Festival Committee judges
applicants. "First come, first
served” seems to be the proce
dure. according to Miss Sher
wood.

WHILE THE IPC does not over
see the acceptance of individual
American delegates and will not
refuse them acceptance, there is
always a possibility that creden
tials might be taken away at the
Festival from anyone indulging
in American flag-waving.
The Festival will include large
seminars on political and social
issues as well as athletic compe
tition and cultural activities.

The Finnish government has
forbidden anti-Festival activity
and is extending hospitality to
the Festival although originally
it was opposed to having the Fes
tival in Finland unless the Fin-

nish student union was willing.
Although the union was unwill
ing. the IPC went ahead anyway
and set up in Helsinki. For Fin
land to speak out against the Fes
tival would compromise its for
eign policy of neutrality, it is be
lieved.
By Friday il should he known
whether a group of Stanford stu
dents will he going to the Com
munist-sponsored Helsinki World
Youth Festival.

Of the 72 students originally ac
cepted as tentative delegates, 25
have been selected to apply to the
U.S. Festival Committee for ac
ceptance as delegates to the Fes
tival.
ENOUGH FUNDS are being
sought to finance at least 55 stu-

dents and ideally all 72. Those
who were not asked to apply to
the U.S. Festival Committee will
go as observers if enough money
is raised.

Il is still not apparent whether
there will be enough to finance
even the 25 delegates although
newly-elected HR President Scot
ty Thompson is optimistic that
funds from private sources will
be available by Friday. The 23
delegates have already found
enough cash on their own to
send the SSO-ahead application
fee to the U.S. Festival Commit
tee.

Having reserved only 15 places
for Stanford students on the
American delegation, the U.S.
Festival Committee is asking the
International Preparatory Com
mittee for extra places on the
delegation, which, otherwise
would have no more openings.

tion.

THE FESTIVAL is being spon
sored from July 27 to August 5
by two Communist youth organi
sations, the World Federation of
Democratic Youth and the Inter
national Union of Students. Al
though not entirely Communist,
the official administrator, the In
ternational Preparatory Commit
tee (IPCI is Communist-oriented,
Miss Sherwood said.
The U.S. Festival Committee,
sponsor of the American delega
tion to the Vienna Festival in 1959,
has been recognized by the IPC
to select the American delegation.
The political complexion of this
year’s Committe is unknown and
is possibly more moderate than
in 1959 when its membership was
dominated by alleged fellow-trav
elers.

There are, apparently, no ide
ological criteria by which the
U.S. Festival Committee judges
applicants. "First come, first
served” seems to be the proce
dure. according to Miss Sher
wood.

WHILE THE IPC does not over
see the acceptance of individual
American delegates and will not
refuse them acceptance, there is
always a possibility that creden
tials might be taken away at the
Festival from anyone indulging
in American flag-waving.
The Festival will include large
seminars on political and social
issues as well as athletic compe
tition and cultural activities.

The Finnish government has
forbidden anti-Festival activity
and is extending hospitality to
the Festival although originally
it was opposed to having the Fes
tival in Finland unless the Fin-

nish student union was willing.
Although the union was unwill
ing. the IPC went ahead anyway
and set up in Helsinki. For Fin
land to speak out against the Fes
tival would compromise its for
eign policy of neutrality, it is be
lieved.
By Friday il should he known
whether a group of Stanford stu
dents will he going to the Com
munist-sponsored Helsinki World
Youth Festival.

Of the 72 students originally ac
cepted as tentative delegates, 25
have been selected to apply to the
U.S. Festival Committee for ac
ceptance as delegates to the Fes
tival.
ENOUGH FUNDS are being
sought to finance at least 55 stu-

dents and ideally all 72. Those
who were not asked to apply to
the U.S. Festival Committee will
go as observers if enough money
is raised.

Il is still not apparent whether
there will be enough to finance
even the 25 delegates although
newly-elected HR President Scot
ty Thompson is optimistic that
funds from private sources will
be available by Friday. The 23
delegates have already found
enough cash on their own to
send the SSO-ahead application
fee to the U.S. Festival Commit
tee.

Having reserved only 15 places
for Stanford students on the
American delegation, the U.S.
Festival Committee is asking the
International Preparatory Com
mittee for extra places on the
delegation, which, otherwise
would have no more openings.

When the 72 students meet to
morrow night, a plan will bo pre
sented for the election of commit
tees that will assign reading lists
and make preparations for living
in Helsinki.
FINANCES WILL be handled
by a committee of three, Joel
Moister, Scotty Thompson and
Nancy Sherwood. This committee
was self-appointed, not elected,
because “the people donating
have put their trust in the three
of us,” Miss Sherwood said. Me
ister, Thompson and Miss Sher
wood originated the project and
have made preliminary financial
contacts.

Tentative plane reservations
have been made for July 24 to
Helsinki. Reading lists are now
being drawn up by the students
who intend to go to the Festival.
It is hoped that all those who
are planning to go will use these
lists as a basis for gaining a bet
ter understanding of the world,
its peoples and its problems, ac
cording to Miss Sherwood.
A short reading period supple
mented with seminars may be
held for those interested shortly
before the Festival. Concentra
tion would be placed on discus
sion and study of world problems
and of the international student
movement.
It is not clear which of two al
ternatives will be preferred if
only limited funds arc available:
sending a maximum number of
students to Helsinki with mini
mal previous orientation or send
ing a smaller number of students
who have had extensive orienta
tion.
