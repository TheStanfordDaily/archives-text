# Students Ask Trustees For Decision on Liquor
## 
### 
Five students will today send a
letter to Stanford’s Trustees, re
questing them to express then
views on the “new liquor policy.”
The Trustees, who wall meet
Thursday, have the liquor ques
tion on their agenda.
The students, Bob Sayler, Ar
min Rosencranz, Dave French,
Joel Meister, and Jim Stewart,
gave the Daily a copy of the let
ter which is printed here in its
entirety.
“TWO WEEKS ago, over 2700
students voted for a new liquor
policy. The total vote, 3400, was
the largest student vote in the
University’s history.
"These students were not ask
ing for license or disorder. Rath
er, they were convinced that the
old liquor policy was ‘unrealistic

and unenforceable,’ as Dean of
Men William G. Craig stated.
“The referendum, in binding
Men’s and Women’s Councils to
enforce a policy consistent with
state law, is considered by stu
dents to be a reasonable approach
to drinking on campus, one which
students can respect. The prohibi
tion policy, like the 18th Amend
ment, created an inherent disre
gard for the law.
“We are aware that faculty-ad
ministration committees have
been studying the situation for
some time. However, we have
seen no positive results issue
from these discussions. Students
themselves have not been in
volved in these committees, and
students, until now, have never
expressed their position collec
tively and after much thoughtful
debate.
“SINCE MAY 3, the Associate
ed Students have considered the
new policy to be in effect. Re
sults, thus far, indicate a high
degree of responsibility on the
part of students.
“But we remain in an awkwai’d
position, for we have no indica
tion of the current attitude of the
Trustees. We consider it highly
desirable that your position be
clarified at the forthcoming
Trustees’ meeting Thursday, May
17.
“Mr. Pike’s article in The Daily
this year has reassured students
of the Trustees’ interest in and
concern for student problems. We
have been informed that the ques
tion of the liquor policy will ap
pear on your agenda. We ask for
an expression of your views.”

an expression of your views.”
Five students will today send a
letter to Stanford’s Trustees, re
questing them to express then
views on the “new liquor policy.”
The Trustees, who wall meet
Thursday, have the liquor ques
tion on their agenda.
The students, Bob Sayler, Ar
min Rosencranz, Dave French,
Joel Meister, and Jim Stewart,
gave the Daily a copy of the let
ter which is printed here in its
entirety.
“TWO WEEKS ago, over 2700
students voted for a new liquor
policy. The total vote, 3400, was
the largest student vote in the
University’s history.
"These students were not ask
ing for license or disorder. Rath
er, they were convinced that the
old liquor policy was ‘unrealistic

and unenforceable,’ as Dean of
Men William G. Craig stated.
“The referendum, in binding
Men’s and Women’s Councils to
enforce a policy consistent with
state law, is considered by stu
dents to be a reasonable approach
to drinking on campus, one which
students can respect. The prohibi
tion policy, like the 18th Amend
ment, created an inherent disre
gard for the law.
“We are aware that faculty-ad
ministration committees have
been studying the situation for
some time. However, we have
seen no positive results issue
from these discussions. Students
themselves have not been in
volved in these committees, and
students, until now, have never
expressed their position collec
tively and after much thoughtful
debate.
“SINCE MAY 3, the Associate
ed Students have considered the
new policy to be in effect. Re
sults, thus far, indicate a high
degree of responsibility on the
part of students.
“But we remain in an awkwai’d
position, for we have no indica
tion of the current attitude of the
Trustees. We consider it highly
desirable that your position be
clarified at the forthcoming
Trustees’ meeting Thursday, May
17.
“Mr. Pike’s article in The Daily
this year has reassured students
of the Trustees’ interest in and
concern for student problems. We
have been informed that the ques
tion of the liquor policy will ap
pear on your agenda. We ask for
an expression of your views.”
