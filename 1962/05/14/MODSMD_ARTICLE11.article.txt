# 'Musical Good, But Weak'
## 
### M. PERCIVAL 
In its spring production Ram’s Head is offering
for the delight of all an amusing caricature of a
man who thinks he is in a paradise on earth. He
has a faithful wife in Surrey, a “tight ship” which
gives him status, and an amour in Paris. Soon
complications arise, the bubbles burst unexpect
edly, and a new status quo is established with the
neglected wife at the holm.
Given this story of fine potential, Ram’s Head
has done an admirable job on a show which is,
in itself, rather weak. That elusive magic in both
words and music, that drive which carries a musi
cal forward at a brisk, light tempo is unhappily
absent from “Oh Captain.” and inevitably these
defects would exhibit themselves in any produc
tion.
However, Phil Ellis, the director, in marshalling
his variously talented forces musical director,
Henry Gibbons; set designer, Marshall Fisher;
costume designer, William Eddelman; light de
signer, James Lyon; and choreographer. Rose Ann
Saylor—presents us with a production pleasing to
both the eye and ear. He could give the show more
continuity by deleting one or two awkward, be
fore-the-curtain chorus reprises and the dance just
before the finale.
THE MAN WITH the three paradises, Captain
Henry St. James, is handled most enjoyably by
Hoddy Guittard. He is never a stronger or more
crackling showman than when ho uses his ample,
exciting voice. Also his sense of timing and facial
mobility produce a laugh at just the right mo
ments. His best scene is the mock-heroic with
Lisa, the nutty, disarming flower girl. He might
achieve depth in the overall execution of his role
if ho would begin more calmly, flow more with it,
gradually pull out all the stops until he reaches
Act II scene iii.
Miss Marti Krug as Henry’s wife, Maud, while
falling short of being believably English, as
Guittard for the most part does not, nevertheless
has, by the show'’s end, captivated the audience in
her own way. She looses her restraint in the early
scenes with Henry and fully opens up for the
show’s most winning scene, that between her and
the hot-blooded Spaniard. Added to this she has
an expressive, flexible voice, which she puts to
good use throughout.

David Miller, who plays Manzoni, the Captain’s
first mate, has a solid bass-baritone vocal instru
ment. Although he creates a certain “older and
wiser” figure, he needs to be much more relaxed
and expansive in order to achieve the proper bal
ance between the two. As it stands he is not a
match for the Captain.
Soon after the middle of the first act, wc be
come involved with the sub-plot of Henry’s on
the-sly affair with the Parision chanteuse, Bobo,
played by Miss Ellen Cowley. She too is hesitant in
letting go at the start but is a much bolder per
son by the “You Don’t Know Him" scene, wherein
both she and Miss Krug convey subtly the fact
that neither of them really knows Henry.
Occasionally appearing ill at ease on stage, the
chorus always discharges its musical duties in a
precise manner and provides a solid background
for the principals. It is complemented by a full
sounding, lively orchestra, which opens the show
with a very well played overture. Both chorus
and orchestra work well under Mr. Gibbons’s di
rection.
THE MOST IMAGINATIVE clement of the
production lies in the choreographed numbers.
Miss Saylor gives the dancers a healthy workout,
and probably through lack of sufficient rehearsal
and complexity of routine, they are yet somewhat
uneven hut should bo more unified for the last
three performances on Thursday through Satur
day.
As the show has so many different places of
action the technical aspect of the production could
not help but be complicated. In order to achieve
the best possible fluency, the designer wisely con
structs his sets on two revolving turntables, which
provide a fair amount of rapidity in scene change.
Perhaps if the sets themselves were less complex,
the shifts would take less time, and thus a mood
created in one scene would not be lost by wailing
for the next to be made ready.
In general, what the show may lack in integra
tion and pace for one reason or another, it makes
up for by the vocal powers of practically all con
cerned and by the great fun of doing this show,
which the entire company radiates across the
footlights. This warmth and esprit in turn causes
the audience to be doubly appreciative and recep
tive. It is in fact a quality achieved in few pro
fessional musicals.
