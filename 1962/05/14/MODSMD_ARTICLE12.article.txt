A letter from Dr. David Levin,
Associate Prof, of English, to
Sigma Nu regretting an invita
tion to their Spring reception
Saturday in honor of the presi
dent of the Board of Trustees has
recently brought attention to the
Sigma Nu bias clauses.
In a letter sent also to Dean of
Men, William Craig, Levin wrote:
“Thank you for inviting my
wife and me to the third annual
Spring reception of Sigma Nu, in
honor of Mr. Thomas P. Pike. I
trust that your invitation comes
in a spirit of fraternity, and I
hope that you will be able to find
the same spirit in this reply. My
belief in fraternity impels me to
reject invitations from social
groups that deny membership to
people of certain racial or re
ligious origin.
A GOOD DEAL of informal
publicity has attended the efforts

of your local chapter to change
restrictions in the national char
ter and to ignore those restric
tions in choosing your new mem
bers. Yet my most recent infor
mation is that the restrictions re
main in the national charter and
that you have neither seceded
from the national fraternity nor
bought up its share of the prop
erty in which the reception will
be held. Thus it seems clear to
me that you now invito Mr. Pike
and members of the faculty to
agree to a strange kind of com
promise: that so long as your
chapter does not actually apply
discriminatory rules of member
ship, it can maintain good stand
ing in both the academic commun
ity and the discriminatory na
tional fraternity. That odd stance
may bo convenient and even com
fortable, but I cannot in good
conscience help you to conclude
that you can enjoy the comforts
of both communities by subscrib
ing to their conflicting principles.

I understand, of course, that
your chapter is in an extremely
difficult position and that your
proper choice, though it seems to
me clear, is not easy. I believe
that your chapter ought to be in a
difficult position, for the only
choice that can be made easy is
the wrong one. Members of the
faculty should not help to make
the wrong choice easy.’’
After writing the letter Dr. Le
vin learned that contrary to his
information Sigma Nu was con
forming to the provisions of their
charter in practice: Sigma Nu
does not ignore the clauses and
does refuse membership to Ne
groes anti Orientals.
THE CLAUSE excluding Ne
groes is in the “ancient” rules of
the national whereas the Orien
tals were excluded only in 1920's
after the West Coast chapters
had conducted a successful cam
paign to bar Orientals nationally.
This summer at the national
convention, the Stanford chapter
wall attempt to convince the na
tional to remove the bias clauses.
If the attempt fails, the local will
have the choice of leaving the
national or acquiescing before the
Judgment of the national.
The President of the Stanford
Sigma Nu chapter, Tom Grey,
does not anticipate leaving the
national but admits that “any
thing is a possibility.”
ALTHOUGH THE California
chapters of nationals with bias
clauses must reform by 1964 or
violate state law, 1964 need not
be a critical year for Sigma Nu.
The national gives a “waiver with
honor” to any local so thieatened
by slate law whereby the national
council allows the Stanford chap
ter to retain its national affilia
tion while violating the “ancient”
rules and modern statutes.
“In view of the University’s
policy on discriminatory clauses.”
Craig said, “we are interested in

helping Sigma Nu in their effort
to change these clauses.”
Craig pointed out that only two
chapters on the Stanford campus
retain bias clauses, the other be
ing Kappa Alpha.
LAST SUMMKR at the national
convention the Sigma Chi's re
moved their bias statutes.
Levin said that from his point
of view a chapter’s decision to
eliminate discriminatory clauses
or leave their national was noth
ing heroic. Rather, it is some
thing to he expected and not tri
umphantly proclaimed as is oc
casionally the circumstance.
Last year the Stanford chapter
of Alpha Tau Omega had a dis
pute with their national over dis
crimination, and the Stanford
chapter went local in defiance of
ATO traditions.
For some years the Stanford
ATO chapter had had Jews in the
membership against national reg
ulations. When the national dis
covered the deception and pro
tested to the chapter here, the
ATO’s decided to leave the na
tional organization.

Sigma Nu regretting an invita
tion to their Spring reception
Saturday in honor of the presi
dent of the Board of Trustees has
recently brought attention to the
Sigma Nu bias clauses.
In a letter sent also to Dean of
Men, William Craig, Levin wrote:
“Thank you for inviting my
wife and me to the third annual
Spring reception of Sigma Nu, in
honor of Mr. Thomas P. Pike. I
trust that your invitation comes
in a spirit of fraternity, and I
hope that you will be able to find
the same spirit in this reply. My
belief in fraternity impels me to
reject invitations from social
groups that deny membership to
people of certain racial or re
ligious origin.
A GOOD DEAL of informal
publicity has attended the efforts

of your local chapter to change
restrictions in the national char
ter and to ignore those restric
tions in choosing your new mem
bers. Yet my most recent infor
mation is that the restrictions re
main in the national charter and
that you have neither seceded
from the national fraternity nor
bought up its share of the prop
erty in which the reception will
be held. Thus it seems clear to
me that you now invito Mr. Pike
and members of the faculty to
agree to a strange kind of com
promise: that so long as your
chapter does not actually apply
discriminatory rules of member
ship, it can maintain good stand
ing in both the academic commun
ity and the discriminatory na
tional fraternity. That odd stance
may bo convenient and even com
fortable, but I cannot in good
conscience help you to conclude
that you can enjoy the comforts
of both communities by subscrib
ing to their conflicting principles.

I understand, of course, that
your chapter is in an extremely
difficult position and that your
proper choice, though it seems to
me clear, is not easy. I believe
that your chapter ought to be in a
difficult position, for the only
choice that can be made easy is
the wrong one. Members of the
faculty should not help to make
the wrong choice easy.’’
After writing the letter Dr. Le
vin learned that contrary to his
information Sigma Nu was con
forming to the provisions of their
charter in practice: Sigma Nu
does not ignore the clauses and
does refuse membership to Ne
groes anti Orientals.
THE CLAUSE excluding Ne
groes is in the “ancient” rules of
the national whereas the Orien
tals were excluded only in 1920's
after the West Coast chapters
had conducted a successful cam
paign to bar Orientals nationally.
This summer at the national
convention, the Stanford chapter
wall attempt to convince the na
tional to remove the bias clauses.
If the attempt fails, the local will
have the choice of leaving the
national or acquiescing before the
Judgment of the national.
The President of the Stanford
Sigma Nu chapter, Tom Grey,
does not anticipate leaving the
national but admits that “any
thing is a possibility.”
ALTHOUGH THE California
chapters of nationals with bias
clauses must reform by 1964 or
violate state law, 1964 need not
be a critical year for Sigma Nu.
The national gives a “waiver with
honor” to any local so thieatened
by slate law whereby the national
council allows the Stanford chap
ter to retain its national affilia
tion while violating the “ancient”
rules and modern statutes.
“In view of the University’s
policy on discriminatory clauses.”
Craig said, “we are interested in

helping Sigma Nu in their effort
to change these clauses.”
Craig pointed out that only two
chapters on the Stanford campus
retain bias clauses, the other be
ing Kappa Alpha.
LAST SUMMKR at the national
convention the Sigma Chi's re
moved their bias statutes.
Levin said that from his point
of view a chapter’s decision to
eliminate discriminatory clauses
or leave their national was noth
ing heroic. Rather, it is some
thing to he expected and not tri
umphantly proclaimed as is oc
casionally the circumstance.
Last year the Stanford chapter
of Alpha Tau Omega had a dis
pute with their national over dis
crimination, and the Stanford
chapter went local in defiance of
ATO traditions.
For some years the Stanford
ATO chapter had had Jews in the
membership against national reg
ulations. When the national dis
covered the deception and pro
tested to the chapter here, the
ATO’s decided to leave the na
tional organization.

Sigma Nu bias clauses.
In a letter sent also to Dean of
Men, William Craig, Levin wrote:
“Thank you for inviting my
wife and me to the third annual
Spring reception of Sigma Nu, in
honor of Mr. Thomas P. Pike. I
trust that your invitation comes
in a spirit of fraternity, and I
hope that you will be able to find
the same spirit in this reply. My
belief in fraternity impels me to
reject invitations from social
groups that deny membership to
people of certain racial or re
ligious origin.
A GOOD DEAL of informal
publicity has attended the efforts

of your local chapter to change
restrictions in the national char
ter and to ignore those restric
tions in choosing your new mem
bers. Yet my most recent infor
mation is that the restrictions re
main in the national charter and
that you have neither seceded
from the national fraternity nor
bought up its share of the prop
erty in which the reception will
be held. Thus it seems clear to
me that you now invito Mr. Pike
and members of the faculty to
agree to a strange kind of com
promise: that so long as your
chapter does not actually apply
discriminatory rules of member
ship, it can maintain good stand
ing in both the academic commun
ity and the discriminatory na
tional fraternity. That odd stance
may bo convenient and even com
fortable, but I cannot in good
conscience help you to conclude
that you can enjoy the comforts
of both communities by subscrib
ing to their conflicting principles.

I understand, of course, that
your chapter is in an extremely
difficult position and that your
proper choice, though it seems to
me clear, is not easy. I believe
that your chapter ought to be in a
difficult position, for the only
choice that can be made easy is
the wrong one. Members of the
faculty should not help to make
the wrong choice easy.’’
After writing the letter Dr. Le
vin learned that contrary to his
information Sigma Nu was con
forming to the provisions of their
charter in practice: Sigma Nu
does not ignore the clauses and
does refuse membership to Ne
groes anti Orientals.
THE CLAUSE excluding Ne
groes is in the “ancient” rules of
the national whereas the Orien
tals were excluded only in 1920's
after the West Coast chapters
had conducted a successful cam
paign to bar Orientals nationally.
This summer at the national
convention, the Stanford chapter
wall attempt to convince the na
tional to remove the bias clauses.
If the attempt fails, the local will
have the choice of leaving the
national or acquiescing before the
Judgment of the national.
The President of the Stanford
Sigma Nu chapter, Tom Grey,
does not anticipate leaving the
national but admits that “any
thing is a possibility.”
ALTHOUGH THE California
chapters of nationals with bias
clauses must reform by 1964 or
violate state law, 1964 need not
be a critical year for Sigma Nu.
The national gives a “waiver with
honor” to any local so thieatened
by slate law whereby the national
council allows the Stanford chap
ter to retain its national affilia
tion while violating the “ancient”
rules and modern statutes.
“In view of the University’s
policy on discriminatory clauses.”
Craig said, “we are interested in

helping Sigma Nu in their effort
to change these clauses.”
Craig pointed out that only two
chapters on the Stanford campus
retain bias clauses, the other be
ing Kappa Alpha.
LAST SUMMKR at the national
convention the Sigma Chi's re
moved their bias statutes.
Levin said that from his point
of view a chapter’s decision to
eliminate discriminatory clauses
or leave their national was noth
ing heroic. Rather, it is some
thing to he expected and not tri
umphantly proclaimed as is oc
casionally the circumstance.
Last year the Stanford chapter
of Alpha Tau Omega had a dis
pute with their national over dis
crimination, and the Stanford
chapter went local in defiance of
ATO traditions.
For some years the Stanford
ATO chapter had had Jews in the
membership against national reg
ulations. When the national dis
covered the deception and pro
tested to the chapter here, the
ATO’s decided to leave the na
tional organization.
