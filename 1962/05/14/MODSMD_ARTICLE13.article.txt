# Romeo and Juliet' Has Italian's Exuberance
## 
### 
The traditional character of the
Old Vic Company is that of re
straint. Their productions are em
inently competent and beautifully
complete, but their tone is always
subdued. They strive to under
play.
But when Franco Zeffhelli, a
Florentine director and designer,
joins the company, he creates an
Old Vic production of ‘‘Romeo
and Juliet” which is thoroughly
Italian in exuberance and rich
ness of texture. Old Vic does not
lost any beauty; it simply gains
a warmth and extroversion one
does not usually find in it. The
merger results in a magnificent
‘‘Romeo and Juliet.”
The curtain opens on a narrow
Veronese street lined with old,
solid, warm walls. It is dawn, and
the sun catches the dust rising
from the streets as the stage
lightens and people begin to
emerge. The people have the same
earthy warmth and vitality as
they joke and jostle in the rou
tine of opening a day.
THE PLAY is contained in the
first scene—the joking becomes
a brawl, and one sees clearly the
bitter enmity of the Capulets and
Montagues extending to the mi
nor members of both houses. The
costumes, brown tones for the
Capulets and grays for the Mon
tagues, do not let the audience
forget the hatred. The implica
tions of the conflict are deepened
and widened in almost every
scene that follows.
Romeo and Juliet are both very
young and very unhardened. Ju
liet, Joanna Dunham, responds
to Romeo with the ingenuous
spontaneity of a child and in
dulges her whims with complete
freedom. In the balcony scene she
leans over the edge of the bal
cony, rests her head on the walls,
turns back and forward in an en
tirely unself conscious manner.
She plays with Romeo, and tries
to adhere to form, but her
W'armth persists in breaking

through.
When she learns that Romeo
has been banished, she flings her
self about the stage, screaming
and whispering in turn. She has
the self-possession typical of a
girl, but in this scene, which is

100 long, the self-centered indul
gence becomes tedious. It is en
dearing on the balcony, but here
there is simply too much of it.
JULIET IS excellent otherwise,
especially when she is acting as
the foil to the Nurse (Rosalind
Atkinson), a delightfully garru
lous and loving old woman.
The scenes with the Nurse are
real farce, and Miss Atkinson
plays them with great humor.
Her scene with Mercutio is slap
stick of the first order, and it
provokes appropriate hearty
laughter.
Romeo (John Stride) is a fel
low who is passionately in love,
alternately tender and wild. But
he is mostly a kid with a shaggy
haircut who responds in the same
full-hearted manner that Juliet
does to love and to hatred. He
does not want to fight Tybalt,
but when Tybalt kills Mercutio,
he calls him back and fights with
a passion, a loyalty, and a disre
gard of consequences that con
trast sharply to Mercutio’s and
Tybalt’s jesting, slick duel.
Romeo’s Lamentation at Juliet’s
tomb conveys the same intensity
of feeling. It too stands out
strongly against Paris’s previous
weak farewell.
BUT THE MOST outstanding
member of the cast is Mercutio,
played by Edward Atienza. His
wit is brilliant—not a line is lost
and he leaps and flings his cape
about in a thoroughly delightful
manner. His humor is essential to
the play; it saves it from heavi
ness. The character that he cre
ates, the man who jokes even
when he is fatally wounded and
who is not believed because he is
so rarely in earnest, leaves a
tremendous void when he dies.
His bitter oath, “A plague on both
your houses!” has an overwhelm
ing impact.
The production is highly in
ventive and maintains its tenor
almost all the way through. It is
only in the third act that the pace
slows slightly, when the tension
and the excitement become too
much to bear.
What Zeffirelli has created, a
uniformly imaginative and vital
production, is a tribute to Shakes
peare.

100 long, the self-centered indul
gence becomes tedious. It is en
dearing on the balcony, but here
there is simply too much of it.
JULIET IS excellent otherwise,
especially when she is acting as
the foil to the Nurse (Rosalind
Atkinson), a delightfully garru
lous and loving old woman.
The scenes with the Nurse are
real farce, and Miss Atkinson
plays them with great humor.
Her scene with Mercutio is slap
stick of the first order, and it
provokes appropriate hearty
laughter.
Romeo (John Stride) is a fel
low who is passionately in love,
alternately tender and wild. But
he is mostly a kid with a shaggy
haircut who responds in the same
full-hearted manner that Juliet
does to love and to hatred. He
does not want to fight Tybalt,
but when Tybalt kills Mercutio,
he calls him back and fights with
a passion, a loyalty, and a disre
gard of consequences that con
trast sharply to Mercutio’s and
Tybalt’s jesting, slick duel.
Romeo’s Lamentation at Juliet’s
tomb conveys the same intensity
of feeling. It too stands out
strongly against Paris’s previous
weak farewell.
BUT THE MOST outstanding
member of the cast is Mercutio,
played by Edward Atienza. His
wit is brilliant—not a line is lost
and he leaps and flings his cape
about in a thoroughly delightful
manner. His humor is essential to
the play; it saves it from heavi
ness. The character that he cre
ates, the man who jokes even
when he is fatally wounded and
who is not believed because he is
so rarely in earnest, leaves a
tremendous void when he dies.
His bitter oath, “A plague on both
your houses!” has an overwhelm
ing impact.
The production is highly in
ventive and maintains its tenor
almost all the way through. It is
only in the third act that the pace
slows slightly, when the tension
and the excitement become too
much to bear.
What Zeffirelli has created, a
uniformly imaginative and vital
production, is a tribute to Shakes

The traditional character of the
Old Vic Company is that of re
straint. Their productions are em
inently competent and beautifully
complete, but their tone is always
subdued. They strive to under
play.
But when Franco Zeffhelli, a
Florentine director and designer,
joins the company, he creates an
Old Vic production of ‘‘Romeo
and Juliet” which is thoroughly
Italian in exuberance and rich
ness of texture. Old Vic does not
lost any beauty; it simply gains
a warmth and extroversion one
does not usually find in it. The
merger results in a magnificent
‘‘Romeo and Juliet.”
The curtain opens on a narrow
Veronese street lined with old,
solid, warm walls. It is dawn, and

from the streets as the stage
lightens and people begin to
emerge. The people have the same
earthy warmth and vitality as
they joke and jostle in the rou
tine of opening a day.
THE PLAY is contained in the
first scene—the joking becomes
a brawl, and one sees clearly the
bitter enmity of the Capulets and
Montagues extending to the mi

costumes, brown tones for the
Capulets and grays for the Mon
tagues, do not let the audience
forget the hatred. The implica

and widened in almost every
scene that follows.
Romeo and Juliet are both very
young and very unhardened. Ju

to Romeo with the ingenuous
spontaneity of a child and in
dulges her whims with complete
freedom. In the balcony scene she
leans over the edge of the bal
cony, rests her head on the walls,
turns back and forward in an en
tirely unself conscious manner.
She plays with Romeo, and tries
to adhere to form, but her
W'armth persists in breaking

through.
When she learns that Romeo
has been banished, she flings her

The traditional character of the
Old Vic Company is that of re
straint. Their productions are em
inently competent and beautifully
complete, but their tone is always
subdued. They strive to under
play.
But when Franco Zeffhelli, a
Florentine director and designer,
joins the company, he creates an
Old Vic production of ‘‘Romeo
and Juliet” which is thoroughly
Italian in exuberance and rich
ness of texture. Old Vic does not
lost any beauty; it simply gains
a warmth and extroversion one
does not usually find in it. The
merger results in a magnificent
‘‘Romeo and Juliet.”
The curtain opens on a narrow
Veronese street lined with old,
solid, warm walls. It is dawn, and
the sun catches the dust rising
from the streets as the stage
lightens and people begin to
emerge. The people have the same
earthy warmth and vitality as
they joke and jostle in the rou
tine of opening a day.
THE PLAY is contained in the
first scene—the joking becomes
a brawl, and one sees clearly the
bitter enmity of the Capulets and
Montagues extending to the mi
nor members of both houses. The
costumes, brown tones for the
Capulets and grays for the Mon
tagues, do not let the audience
forget the hatred. The implica
tions of the conflict are deepened
and widened in almost every
scene that follows.
Romeo and Juliet are both very
young and very unhardened. Ju
liet, Joanna Dunham, responds
to Romeo with the ingenuous
spontaneity of a child and in
dulges her whims with complete
freedom. In the balcony scene she
leans over the edge of the bal
cony, rests her head on the walls,
turns back and forward in an en
tirely unself conscious manner.
She plays with Romeo, and tries
to adhere to form, but her
W'armth persists in breaking

through.
When she learns that Romeo
has been banished, she flings her
self about the stage, screaming
and whispering in turn. She has
the self-possession typical of a
girl, but in this scene, which is

100 long, the self-centered indul
gence becomes tedious. It is en
dearing on the balcony, but here
there is simply too much of it.
JULIET IS excellent otherwise,
especially when she is acting as
the foil to the Nurse (Rosalind
Atkinson), a delightfully garru
lous and loving old woman.
The scenes with the Nurse are
real farce, and Miss Atkinson
plays them with great humor.
Her scene with Mercutio is slap
stick of the first order, and it
provokes appropriate hearty
laughter.
Romeo (John Stride) is a fel
low who is passionately in love,
alternately tender and wild. But
he is mostly a kid with a shaggy
haircut who responds in the same
full-hearted manner that Juliet
does to love and to hatred. He
does not want to fight Tybalt,
but when Tybalt kills Mercutio,
he calls him back and fights with
a passion, a loyalty, and a disre
gard of consequences that con
trast sharply to Mercutio’s and
Tybalt’s jesting, slick duel.
Romeo’s Lamentation at Juliet’s
tomb conveys the same intensity
of feeling. It too stands out
strongly against Paris’s previous
weak farewell.
BUT THE MOST outstanding
member of the cast is Mercutio,
played by Edward Atienza. His
wit is brilliant—not a line is lost
and he leaps and flings his cape
about in a thoroughly delightful
manner. His humor is essential to
the play; it saves it from heavi
ness. The character that he cre
ates, the man who jokes even
when he is fatally wounded and
who is not believed because he is
so rarely in earnest, leaves a
tremendous void when he dies.
His bitter oath, “A plague on both
your houses!” has an overwhelm
ing impact.
The production is highly in
ventive and maintains its tenor
almost all the way through. It is
only in the third act that the pace
slows slightly, when the tension
and the excitement become too
much to bear.
What Zeffirelli has created, a
uniformly imaginative and vital
production, is a tribute to Shakes
peare.
