WE LL NEVER KNOW
Editor, The Daily;
Quoting from last Tuesday’s
Examiner, ‘‘Track stars for the
forthcoming USA-USSR meet will
be housed in Stern Hall, a dormi
tory on the Stanford campus. Sur
prise the facilities will be coedu
cational, with both the men and
the women living in Stern!” The
following day President Sterling
advised Legislature that ‘‘Coedu
cational housing in Stern Hall is
impossible under the terms of the
original grant from Mrs. Stern.”
Apparently Mrs. Stern’s strange
grudge against women was miti
gated by an overwhelming inter
est in track and field events. Or
perhaps President Sterling has
been listening to those same
sharp legal minds that served him
so well on the liquor issue. (Re
member: “Possession of liquor on
the Stanford campus is a viola
tion of state law'.”) Or perhaps
this is just one more little white
lie to protect us poor benighted
students from our own unnatural
passions. Bradley Efron i
CONGRATULATIONS
Editor, The Daily:
About a year ago the Phi Gam
ma Delta fraternity was in con
siderable difficulty on the cam
pus, resulting from the total loss
of their house, misguided pledge j
sneaks and other minor infrac
tions. Their scholastic rating was
at or near the bottom of the list
of fraternities. At that time there
was talk of disbanding the frater
nity, but finally the organization
wms placed in receivership.
Recently the receivership was
removed, scholarship records
have been Improved, and during |
the past year not a single infrac- j
tion of rules has been reported.
In spite of the fact that no house
was available, a fine pledge class
was obtained and they have built
a spirit and organization of which
they are justifiably proud. The
group is an outstanding example
of what can be done under com

potent leadership, and with ai
membership willing to cooperate.
Congratulations to Phi Gamma
Delta!

HILARITY
Editor, The Daily:
I admire The Daily’s attempt
to stimulate intellectual curiosity
at Stanford in its subtle weather
reports. A case in point is the re
port in Thursday morning’s
Daily: “In the tradition of Vol
stead, it will be dry today.”
It is my belief, however, that
not that many Stanford under
graduates know who Volstead
was; and to borrow a phrase from
Glen Yarbrough of the “Lime
lighters,” in order to appreciate
“the truly incredible hilarity” of
the report, the following basic

I knowledge of American historj
is essential:
The Volstead Ael extended,
over President Wilson’s veto, the
wartime ban on distilling and
brewing, defining alcoholic bever
ages as any containing more than
one-half of one per cent alcohol
by volume, and prohibiting the
manufacture or sale of any such
beverages after the Eighteenth
Amendment had gone into effect
in January, 1920. The Anti-Saloon
lobbyists forced the adoption of
the Volstead Act. 1
In short, the Volstead Act
brought about Prohibition; and if
it weren’t for The Daily, many
Stanford students might have
been graduated ignorant of this
fact.

In spite of the fact that no house

HILARITY
Editor, The Daily:
I admire The Daily’s attempt
to stimulate intellectual curiosity
at Stanford in its subtle weather
reports. A case in point is the re
port in Thursday morning’s
Daily: “In the tradition of Vol
stead, it will be dry today.”
It is my belief, however, that
not that many Stanford under
graduates know who Volstead
was; and to borrow a phrase from
Glen Yarbrough of the “Lime
lighters,” in order to appreciate
“the truly incredible hilarity” of
the report, the following basic

I knowledge of American historj
is essential:
The Volstead Ael extended,
over President Wilson’s veto, the
wartime ban on distilling and
brewing, defining alcoholic bever
ages as any containing more than
one-half of one per cent alcohol
by volume, and prohibiting the
manufacture or sale of any such
beverages after the Eighteenth
Amendment had gone into effect
in January, 1920. The Anti-Saloon
lobbyists forced the adoption of
the Volstead Act. 1
In short, the Volstead Act
brought about Prohibition; and if
it weren’t for The Daily, many
Stanford students might have
been graduated ignorant of this
fact.

Editor, The Daily;
Quoting from last Tuesday’s
Examiner, ‘‘Track stars for the
forthcoming USA-USSR meet will
be housed in Stern Hall, a dormi
tory on the Stanford campus. Sur
prise the facilities will be coedu
cational, with both the men and
the women living in Stern!” The
following day President Sterling
advised Legislature that ‘‘Coedu
cational housing in Stern Hall is
impossible under the terms of the
original grant from Mrs. Stern.”
Apparently Mrs. Stern’s strange
grudge against women was miti
gated by an overwhelming inter
est in track and field events. Or
perhaps President Sterling has
been listening to those same
sharp legal minds that served him
so well on the liquor issue. (Re
member: “Possession of liquor on
the Stanford campus is a viola
tion of state law'.”) Or perhaps
this is just one more little white
lie to protect us poor benighted
students from our own unnatural
passions. Bradley Efron i
