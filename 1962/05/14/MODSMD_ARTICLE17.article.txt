# BRODIE NOT ENOUGH
## Indian Varsity Beats Alumni 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
The new-born 1962 Stanfoi'd
football team emerged into the
world Saturday and immediately
showed signs of maturity. Led by
junior quarterback Clark Weaver,
a welcome transfer student from
the University of Colorado, the
Indian varsity beat the Alumni

20-15 to even the Alumni-Varsity
series, 2-2.
The action centered around a
duel between two excellent quar
terbacks, Weaver and the Alum
ni’s John Brodie, of the San Fran
cisco Forty-niners. On almost
every play, Brodie dropped direct
ly back from center, without
much deception, to throw a pass;
he ended up completing 16 of 37
passes for 237 yards.
MEANWHILE Weaver used
much more variety in calling the
plays as well as in executing
them. In directing three drives
the length of the field, he made

skillful use of the option play.
With good speed, he would roll
out toward the end, and depend
ing on the reaction of the de
fense, he would cut Inside the
defensive end or pitch out to the
trailer; after Weaver had made
good yardage on this play a few
times, the defensive halfback
would come up to help out, and
it was then easy to find the of
fensive end open on a ten yard
down-and-out pattern. In all,
Weaver completed 8 of 13 passes
for 106 yards to go along with his
7.2 rushing average.
Although Weaver and Brodie
were the standouts, all five quar
terbacks in the game performed
well. Rod Sears of the Alums and
Dick Ragsdale and Jim Smith of
the Varsity all hit fifty per cent
of their passes or better and
Ragsdale averaged 40 yards on
four punts.
On the other end of the passing
was a group of fine receivers, in
cluding the Varsity’s Chris .les
sen. who caught six, and the
Alumni’s Sam Morley, Skip
Face. Irv Nickolai, and Jack Tay
lor. Morley, the veteran of the
game, showed the outstanding
moves that helped him combine
with Bob Garrett in 19.72 and 1953
to form a great passing combina
tion.
With all these accurate passers
and clever receivers, most of the
attacking was conducted through
the airlanes; a total of 40 out of

175 passes were completed, good
for 471 yards. The scoring would j
| have been higher except that four |
different offensive drives futilely
[ ended due to pass interceptions {
j or fumbles within the opponent’s !
20-yard line.
THE SCORING started late in
the first quarter. Alumnus Chuck
J Shea dropped Ragsdale’s 58-yard
punt in the end /one but tried to !
run it out anyway. He got only !
to the 2-yard line where Randy j
Vahan jarred the ball loose with ]
a shoulder tackle, allowing Var-1
i sity end Terry Wilson to recover I
it right there. On the second of- j
{ fensive play, Weaver sneaked j
over for the touchdown and pass- j
I ed a moment later to Wilson for |
the two-point conversion.
Behind 80, Brodie entered the j
game for the Alumni and quickly I
1 completed three passes to lead a j
: 47-yard drive for a touchdown.
During this drive, Brodie’s re
ceivers were wide open as Stan
| ford’s defensive backs seemed to
be gaping in awe at the pro star.
1 Face kicked the PAT but the un
j dergrads still led, 8-7.
j The Alumni scored a go-ahead
j touchdown ending a 69-yard drive
i in the third quarter. With third
j down and 16 yards to go on the
Varsity 43, Brodie found Face
open behind freshman J. D. Lo
dato and hit him at the 10. Face
1 shook loose from Lodato, scored
j the TD and grabbed a two-point
| conversion pass from Brodie on
I the next play to make it 8-15.
IN THE FOURTH quarter, an
interception ended another Alum
! ni drive on the Varsity 8 and
started a 91-yard scoring parade,
j Tiny Tyce Fitzmorris and Weaver
j gained 46 and 26 yards respec
| lively behind strong blocking |
! from the right side of the line to
I set up a 3-yard scoring pass from
Weaver to freshman end Bob
Howard.
Still trailing, 14-15, Varsity
back Gary Craig intercepted a
Sears pass on his own 15 and ran
it back to the 48. From there
Weaver turned from running to
passing. He hit Jessen three
straight times on passes longer
than ten yards. Three plays later,
from the 30, Weaver threw again
to Howard. With two defenders
on him, Howard grabbed the ball
and struggled into the end zone,
carrying about 420 pounds of
i football player and equipment on
| his back.
Howard’s second touchdown put
the Varsity ahead, 20-15. with 1:50
left to play and insured the vic
tory.
Stanford’s next game is Friday,
! Sept. 21, against Tulane in New
j Orleans. Kickoff time is 8 p.m.
