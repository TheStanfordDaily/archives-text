# Fielders Sabotage Pitchers As Cards Split With Cal Poly
## 
### GLENN ALFORD Sports Editor 
Stanford split a pair of extra
inning baseball games with Cal
Poly of Pomona this weekend,
winning 4-3 in 10 innings Friday,
and losing 2-1 in 13 innings Satur
day.
Both games featured fielding
that would have made a junior
high school team ashamed. Stan
ford pitchers gave up only one
earned run in (he two games,
while Cal Poly gave up three.
THE SATURDAY game was
filled with 11 errors, eight by
Stanford. All runs in that contest
were unearned, as Stanford wast
ed a superb pitching performance
by Darrell Sutherland. He gave
up only four hits in the twelve
innings he worked. The one run
scored off him was a result of
two errors in the third inning by
catcher Bob Overman.
Joe Schultz absorbed the loss
for Stanford. Cal Poly put to
gether one hit and two Stanford
errors to put across the winning
run. Don Terranova singled to
open the thirteenth, and, with
two out, Larry Lesovsky sent a
ground ball to second sacker O. J.
Solander.
Solander let it go through his
legs, Terranova went to third. He
scored when right fielder Tom
May further kicked the ball
around.
STANFORD GOT its lone run
with two out in the bottom of the
ninth in a similarly ludicrous
fashion. Jim Chenu lofted a fly
ball to right field that Mike Ar
none dropped, Chenu making it

safe to second. May ran for him,
and scored on Warren Newell's
line drive single.
In the Friday contest, Bob Hens
ler went from goat to hero to
save Jim Lonborg’s five-hit route
going pitching performance.
Stanford led 3-2 going into the
ninth when Arnone banged a line
drive to left field that just missed
being the first ball hit out of
Sunken Diamond in a varsity con
test this year. Arnone stretched
the blow to an easy triple.
THE NEXT BATTER, Lesov
sky, hit a soft liner to right field
that Hensler dropped, allowing
the run to score.
Hensler atoned for his miscue
in the bottom of the tenth, driv
ing across pinch-runner May with
the winning run on a booming
double.
Stanford got its earlier runs in
the first, on a walk and Bob Holl
man’s double, and the third, when
Jim Chenu walked with the bases
loaded to force in a run.
Stanford plays today, meeting
San Quentin within the walls of
the prison.
