in the mile and two-mile, finished
fourth and third, respectively.

cus 182-2 1 ,2 beaten only by world

ble, and Harry McCalla was
edged by UCLA 9:50.4 to 0:01.8.
The other Stanford relay teams,
in the mile and two-mile, finished
fourth and third, respectively.
The mile relay team of Emanuels,
Rich Klier, Rich Chesarek, and

meet record of 3:10. The two-mile

teammates, Archie San Romani,

world record by 15 seconds.
San Romani, Reeve, and For
man ran their miles in 4:04, 4:04,

over 15-2. Both Tork and Uelses,
battling high winds, failed to
clear 15-8, settling for a five-way
tie for first.
