# Fijis Are Back In the 'Fold'
## 
### 
The Interfraternity Board,
special advisory council to Presi
dent Sterling, unanimously voted
to reinstate the Fiji’s to the Fra
ternity Council as a member in
good standing and commended
the house for its conscious effort
to improve its standing.
The Fiji’s have been on an
Alumni Receivership Program
since June 1, 1961, following a
much publicized hazing incident
last spring.
Under the program six specific
areas were to be much improved
before the house would be allow
ed to fully govern itself. These
six areas included: Scholarship,
Chapter Management and Lead
ership, Rushing and Pledge
Training, National. Alumni and
Public relations, Activities and
Community Participation, and
House Judicial Council.
Professor James T. Watkins IV
singled out the desire by the
house to get back on campus aft
er two years of homelessness due
to a fire as the chief factor in
their eleven-month turnover.
Other members of the board com
mented on the work of the alumni
and of Dean Charles F. Park Jr.,
faculty adviser to the fraternity.
Next September the Fiji’s plan
to move into the vacated Kappa
Sigma house where they will live
for the next few years before
moving into the new fraternity
housing units. There they will live
happily ever after.
