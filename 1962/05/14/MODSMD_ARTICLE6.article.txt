“One star by which the course
of a University can be set and
held is the freedom to question
what has been accepted as old
truth as well as to probe the re
gions of the unknown,” said Pres
ident Wallace Sterling in his Sat
urday address to the Alumni Con
ference held on campus this week
end.

Sterling stressed both the quan
titative and the qualitative
growth of the University in the
last ten years. He spoke of the
increasing number of students
and faculty on the Farm. He also
pointed out the five Nobel Prize
winners on the faculty.
STERLING praised the role of
the alumni in sharing the “lofty
purpose” of the University. They
have increased the membership
of the association, and increased
their giving both through private
individuals and corporations.
“Education is the prime and
most abiding asset of any soci
ety,” ho finished. “It is suscepti
ble to manipulation as in a police
state, but when uninhibited by
the state ... it is capable of
nourishing and preserving that
freedom that places the individual
in the center of the civilization.”

Activities at Stanford provide
students with “a many-ringed in
tellectual circus,” Frederic O.
Glover, executive assistant to the
president, told conference mem
bers Friday.
GLOVER noted that student
groups have cooperated with the
Committee on Public Exercises to
bring to the campus speakers
representing the political spec
trum from William Buckley
through John F. Kennedy to Gus
Hall.

According to Glover, “The Uni
versity feels this presentation of
a wide range of differing views
is a far wiser policy than to say
that our platform is closed to any
ideas.”
