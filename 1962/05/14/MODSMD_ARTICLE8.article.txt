WASHINGTON (UPD—Presi
dent Kennedy was drawing an arc
of American military might
around the Indo-Chinese Peninsu
la yesterday preparatory to direct
intervention if the Communists
refuse a diplomatic settlement of
the civil war in Laos.
Officials said U.S. forces were
poised for initial landings in
neighboring Thailand if that
seems warranted by continued de
terioration of the royal govern
ment position in Laos.
A task force of the U.S. 7th
Fleet was heading into the Gulf
of Siam on the western side of
the peninsula with a battle group

tration and the students, provid
ing information by such pro
grams as tomorrow’s Majors
Program, the President’s Convo
cation, orientation meetings and
Daily articles,” Frohnmayer said.

He added that ST&T should
provide a valuable communica
tions link the other way, giving
the administration student views
on such issues as coed-housing
and liquor.

of Marines which can be quickly
put ashore to help counter any
threat from Pathet Lao rebels
now standing on the northeast
border of that country along the
upper Mekong River.
Meanwhile, alerts had gone out
to units of the U.S. Army’s fast
striking airborne corps on Okina
wa, in Hawaii and on the U.S.
west coast. Officials said some of
these units might already be mov
ing into closer position.
The pro-Communist rebels now
hold slightly more than half of
Laos, but American military ad
visers denied government reports
today that the royal capital of
Luang Prabang and the admin
istrative capital of Vientiane wore
threatened.
Moscow Radio, in a broadcast
monitored in Tokyo, charged that
“Laos is being exposed to the
danger of direct U.S. military in
tervention.’’ The charge was
made in a commentary on Presi
dent Kennedy’s reported alert of
forces for possible movement to
southeast Asia if the Laotian sit
uation deteriorates.
The Chinese Communist New
China news agency reported Sun
day rebel forces had captured at
least 1,616 royal soldiers and an
unstated number of “foreign ag
gressive troops” and that others
surrendered with their rifles and
artillery pieces.

ST&T reminds all sopho
more that they must declare
a major by May 23 or lose
pre ■ registration privileges.
To help these as well as un
certain students, ST&T is
sponsoring speakers from the
various departments to de
scribe requirements and an
swer questions tomorrow and
Wednesday evenings in Wil
bur lounges.
