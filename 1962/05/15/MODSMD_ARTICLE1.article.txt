# Fun Stan Bylaws Change Proposed
## 
### DAN SCHWARTZ 
Two amendments to the ASSU
By-Laws were presented to
LASSU last Thursday by the Fun
damental Standard and Honor
Code Commission. They involve
changes in Article I, Section 1,
‘‘the Fundamental Standard”: and
Article 111, Section 3, Paragraph
B. entitled “Reports,” under the
Relationship of the Judiciary to
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Com.
The amendment revising the
Fundamental Standard, according
to Gary Schoolnik, Chairman of
the Fun Stan Com, seeks to clari
fy the relationship between stu
dent freedoms and responsibili
ties.
SCHOOLNIK said that the Fun-1
damcntal Standard, as it now ap- j
pears in the By-Laws, “fails to
fulfill, in any way, a philosophi-1
cal or realistic definition of the j
fundamental standard of con- j
duct.
“A more serious defect of the |
statement is its incomplete con
ccption of what constitutes ‘good j
citizens.’ It sees citizenship as the I
adherence to and compliance with j
traditional codes of customary be-1
havior, and totally neglects that i
part of citizenship concerned with j
the individual’s exercise of per-1
sonal rights and liberties.
“Thus,” he said, “it is seen that j
this statement, as it presently [
exists, is both confusing and j
wholly inadequate as a funda-1
mental standard of student be
havior and needs clarification |
through a more realistically de-:
fined criterion of conduct.”
IN GENERAL, the amendment
outlines three areas of primary j
concern to the concept of the Fun- ’
damental Standard. After stating j
the necessity for maturity and a
sense of responsibility for the |
preservation of student liberties. |
the amendment acknowledges the j
need for a basic criterion of con- j
duct.
“This criterion presents,” said ■
Schoolnik," a broad structure on
which student behavior may be
based, yet still allows individual
interpretation of the Fundamen- j
tal Standard within a framework {
of suggested student conduct.
“Thus, the amendment does
not, in any way, attempt to codify
conduct, but rather seeks to fa
cilitate the process of education
within the University community I
by permitting a liberal under- j
standing of freedom and the obli- j
gations concurrent with it.”
PARAGRAPH C of the amend
ment recognizes that students
have rights as well as responsi- j
bilities. Included here is the right |
of the student body “to provide S
for their own regulation by means |
of a judicial system,” the rights i
of students appearing before the j
judicial councils, and the obliga- j
tion of the administration “to in- ;
form the student body of all Uni- j
versity policies, procedures, and 1
regulations applying to them and
their organizations.”
The last provision of the
amendment acknowledges the re
sponsibility of students, as in
dividuals or in groups, “to take ;
appropriate action in situations |
involving conduct opposed to the |
spirit” of the Standard.
“THIS SECTION,” said School- j
nik, “seeks to clarify the miscon
ception that third person respon- j
sibility primarily entails the re-1
porting of an offender and his j
violation to the authorities. The j
primary purpose of third person i
responsibility is to encourage the j
fulfillment of the Fundamental I
Standard, and its main emphasis I
is responsibility toward the per-1
son committing (he violation, j
This provision attributes much {
importance to the concept that ir
responsible conduct by individu-1
a Is or groups threatens the rights i
of the student body as a whole.” i
The other amendment before
LASSU submitted by the Com
mission provides for the sum- i
marization and publication in The |
Daily of cases heard by the ju-!
dicial councils. All identifying i
names and incidents would be!
omitted from the reports, and all |
would be approved by the judicial I
councils before publication.
SCHOOLNIK felt that the en-j
actment of this pr ovision would |
keep the student body constantly I

aware of the decisions of the Ju
dicial Councils, and of the present
interpretation of the Standard.
LASSU will act on the proposed
amendments this Thursday,
where they can be passed by a
three-quarters vote. If the Legis
lature does not pass them, they
can be re presented by a petition
containing the signatures of five
per cent of the student body, in
which case the amendments can
be passed by a majority of those
voting.

damental Standard and Honor
Code Commission. They involve
changes in Article I, Section 1,
‘‘the Fundamental Standard”: and
Article 111, Section 3, Paragraph
B. entitled “Reports,” under the
Relationship of the Judiciary to
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Com.
The amendment revising the
Fundamental Standard, according
to Gary Schoolnik, Chairman of
the Fun Stan Com, seeks to clari
fy the relationship between stu
dent freedoms and responsibili
ties.
SCHOOLNIK said that the Fun-1
damcntal Standard, as it now ap- j
pears in the By-Laws, “fails to
fulfill, in any way, a philosophi-1
cal or realistic definition of the j
fundamental standard of con- j
duct.
“A more serious defect of the |
statement is its incomplete con
ccption of what constitutes ‘good j
citizens.’ It sees citizenship as the I
adherence to and compliance with j
traditional codes of customary be-1
havior, and totally neglects that i
part of citizenship concerned with j
the individual’s exercise of per-1
sonal rights and liberties.
“Thus,” he said, “it is seen that j
this statement, as it presently [
exists, is both confusing and j
wholly inadequate as a funda-1
mental standard of student be
havior and needs clarification |
through a more realistically de-:
fined criterion of conduct.”
IN GENERAL, the amendment
outlines three areas of primary j
concern to the concept of the Fun- ’
damental Standard. After stating j
the necessity for maturity and a
sense of responsibility for the |
preservation of student liberties. |
the amendment acknowledges the j
need for a basic criterion of con- j
duct.
“This criterion presents,” said ■
Schoolnik," a broad structure on
which student behavior may be
based, yet still allows individual
interpretation of the Fundamen- j
tal Standard within a framework {
of suggested student conduct.
“Thus, the amendment does
not, in any way, attempt to codify
conduct, but rather seeks to fa
cilitate the process of education
within the University community I
by permitting a liberal under- j
standing of freedom and the obli- j
gations concurrent with it.”
PARAGRAPH C of the amend
ment recognizes that students
have rights as well as responsi- j
bilities. Included here is the right |
of the student body “to provide S
for their own regulation by means |
of a judicial system,” the rights i
of students appearing before the j
judicial councils, and the obliga- j
tion of the administration “to in- ;
form the student body of all Uni- j
versity policies, procedures, and 1
regulations applying to them and
their organizations.”
The last provision of the
amendment acknowledges the re
sponsibility of students, as in
dividuals or in groups, “to take ;
appropriate action in situations |
involving conduct opposed to the |
spirit” of the Standard.
“THIS SECTION,” said School- j
nik, “seeks to clarify the miscon
ception that third person respon- j
sibility primarily entails the re-1
porting of an offender and his j
violation to the authorities. The j
primary purpose of third person i
responsibility is to encourage the j
fulfillment of the Fundamental I
Standard, and its main emphasis I
is responsibility toward the per-1
son committing (he violation, j
This provision attributes much {
importance to the concept that ir
responsible conduct by individu-1
a Is or groups threatens the rights i
of the student body as a whole.” i
The other amendment before
LASSU submitted by the Com
mission provides for the sum- i
marization and publication in The |
Daily of cases heard by the ju-!
dicial councils. All identifying i
names and incidents would be!
omitted from the reports, and all |
would be approved by the judicial I
councils before publication.
SCHOOLNIK felt that the en-j
actment of this pr ovision would |
keep the student body constantly I

aware of the decisions of the Ju
dicial Councils, and of the present
interpretation of the Standard.
LASSU will act on the proposed
amendments this Thursday,
where they can be passed by a
three-quarters vote. If the Legis
lature does not pass them, they
can be re presented by a petition
containing the signatures of five
per cent of the student body, in
which case the amendments can
be passed by a majority of those
voting.

‘‘the Fundamental Standard”: and
Article 111, Section 3, Paragraph
B. entitled “Reports,” under the
Relationship of the Judiciary to
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Com.
The amendment revising the
Fundamental Standard, according
to Gary Schoolnik, Chairman of
the Fun Stan Com, seeks to clari
fy the relationship between stu
dent freedoms and responsibili
ties.
SCHOOLNIK said that the Fun-1
damcntal Standard, as it now ap- j
pears in the By-Laws, “fails to
fulfill, in any way, a philosophi-1
cal or realistic definition of the j
fundamental standard of con- j
duct.
“A more serious defect of the |
statement is its incomplete con
ccption of what constitutes ‘good j
citizens.’ It sees citizenship as the I
adherence to and compliance with j
traditional codes of customary be-1
havior, and totally neglects that i
part of citizenship concerned with j
the individual’s exercise of per-1
sonal rights and liberties.
“Thus,” he said, “it is seen that j
this statement, as it presently [
exists, is both confusing and j
wholly inadequate as a funda-1
mental standard of student be
havior and needs clarification |
through a more realistically de-:
fined criterion of conduct.”
IN GENERAL, the amendment
outlines three areas of primary j
concern to the concept of the Fun- ’
damental Standard. After stating j
the necessity for maturity and a
sense of responsibility for the |
preservation of student liberties. |
the amendment acknowledges the j
need for a basic criterion of con- j
duct.
“This criterion presents,” said ■
Schoolnik," a broad structure on
which student behavior may be
based, yet still allows individual
interpretation of the Fundamen- j
tal Standard within a framework {
of suggested student conduct.
“Thus, the amendment does
not, in any way, attempt to codify
conduct, but rather seeks to fa
cilitate the process of education
within the University community I
by permitting a liberal under- j
standing of freedom and the obli- j
gations concurrent with it.”
PARAGRAPH C of the amend
ment recognizes that students
have rights as well as responsi- j
bilities. Included here is the right |
of the student body “to provide S
for their own regulation by means |
of a judicial system,” the rights i
of students appearing before the j
judicial councils, and the obliga- j
tion of the administration “to in- ;
form the student body of all Uni- j
versity policies, procedures, and 1
regulations applying to them and
their organizations.”
The last provision of the
amendment acknowledges the re
sponsibility of students, as in
dividuals or in groups, “to take ;
appropriate action in situations |
involving conduct opposed to the |
spirit” of the Standard.
“THIS SECTION,” said School- j
nik, “seeks to clarify the miscon
ception that third person respon- j
sibility primarily entails the re-1
porting of an offender and his j
violation to the authorities. The j
primary purpose of third person i
responsibility is to encourage the j
fulfillment of the Fundamental I
Standard, and its main emphasis I
is responsibility toward the per-1
son committing (he violation, j
This provision attributes much {
importance to the concept that ir
responsible conduct by individu-1
a Is or groups threatens the rights i
of the student body as a whole.” i
The other amendment before
LASSU submitted by the Com
mission provides for the sum- i
marization and publication in The |
Daily of cases heard by the ju-!
dicial councils. All identifying i
names and incidents would be!
omitted from the reports, and all |
would be approved by the judicial I
councils before publication.
SCHOOLNIK felt that the en-j
actment of this pr ovision would |
keep the student body constantly I

aware of the decisions of the Ju
dicial Councils, and of the present
interpretation of the Standard.
LASSU will act on the proposed
amendments this Thursday,
where they can be passed by a
three-quarters vote. If the Legis
lature does not pass them, they
can be re presented by a petition
containing the signatures of five
per cent of the student body, in
which case the amendments can
be passed by a majority of those
voting.
