# Shoul Tells NSA's Role
## 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
The National Student Associ
ation is on the verge of some
thing great and new, former
NSA regional officer Dennis
Shaul said last night at a meeting
held in Room 320 to inform stu
dents about the nature of the
NSA.
Tracing the history of the NSA,
Shaul described the program dur
ing the past fifteen years as pri
marily aimed at trying to work
out the best role for a national
student union in the U.S.
THIS ROLE, Shaul said, is
only now being fully realized. The
NSA exists, he stated, to create
a balance between the “need for
social action . . . and student
commitment to the ‘selfish’ need
for education.”
The NSA, Shaul explained, has
come to the point where it is
ready to ask itself, “How can we
effectively play a pm now . . .
where is it that we want to go?”
Shaul believes that the NSA is
answering these questions by try
ing to define, and attempting to
solve, problems that are common
to all students everywhere.
The NSA, he continued, “is in
volving students as they have
never been involved,” in social
problems and more importantly
perhaps, in their own education.
MANY STUDENTS have the
feeling, Shaul said, that education
is someone else’s problem. NSA
exists, in part, to show that this
is wrong.
“NSA should give students the
realization that the university ex
ists for them,” Shaul stated. “Stu
dents come to the university com
munity with a particular perspec
tive. They are . . . often best
aware of inadequacies, of a cer
tain mood or atmosphere.”
If that mood isn’t challenging,
Shaul said, NSA can provide an
effective way to make the student
voice hoard and to attempt to
change the mood.
Urging Stanford students to
write to member schools for criti
cism and appraisel of the NSA
program. Shaul concluded, “If
you accept the responsibilities of
membership in NSA ... it
should create a new spirit on the
campus.”
