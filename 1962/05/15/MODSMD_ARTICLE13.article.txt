# CIVIL RIGHTS
## Walter Lippmann 
### ROBERT G. SPIVACK 
Perhaps the greatest cause of
Negro frustration in the fight for
equal rights is that so many
Northern communities do not
practice what, their politicians
preach.
Each year both houses of Con
gress are treated to the spectacle
of Northern lawmakers speaking
scornfully of the Old South, then
turning around to advocate half
way measures in a half-hearted
fashion that advances the cause
of equal rights hardly at all.
In that category one might put
the current “debate” over liter
acy tests which has provoked so
many headlines and which is
spoken of as a “breakthrough” in
the fight to improve the Negro’s
status. The fact is that it is a
small step, although in the right
direction.
THEBE IS much more signifi
cant legislation pending, particu
larly a measure by Sen. Joseph
Clark of Pennsylvania which
would require every segregated
school district to prepare "with
all deliberate speed” a desegre
gation plan and put it into effect
now. Congress however, demon
strates a tendency to move with
all deliberate slowness.
It is still possible for the execu
tive branch to do more than it
has been doing. A suggestion has
been made that by using the anti
trust laws the Attorney General
could bring one important aspect
of the civil rights argument to a
legal climax. In the light of the
current dispute with the steel
companies over their possible
status as “trusts” this idea seems
especially timely.
THE IDEA for using the anti
trust laws comes from Irving M.
Engel, a distinguished New York
attorney and honorary president
of the American Jewish Commit
tee, Mr. Engel is a specialist in
real estate law.
Mr. Engel, like many others,
thinks it is disgraceful that in
the capital of the United States,
it is still possible for powerful
real estate interests to deny the
sale of private homes “to Ne
groes, or any person or persons
of Negro blood or extraction, or
to any person of the Semitic race,
blood, or origin, which racial de
scription shall be deemed to in
clude Armenians, Jews, Hebrews,
Persians and Syrians ...”
The quotation is free from a
restrictive covenant still widely
used in Washington, D.C., in a
fashionable neighborhood popu
lated by leading Senators, other
politicians and public figures.

While the Supreme Court has
held that restrictive covenants
cannot be enforced, because they
deny equal protection of the laws
to Negroes and others, under the
14th Amendment, the fact is that
they are still used.
MR. ENGEL outlined in some
detail how the real estate firms
and the lenders of mortgage
money, often building and loan
associations or hanks, work hand
in-hand. The lenders have ties
with title companies and main
tain a list of “approved” firms
from which they will accept title
insurance. The title companies
help the developer by making
sure that the restrictive cove
nants appear in new deeds.
It, is a neat arrangement. In 13
residential areas in and around
Washington Mr. Engel finds there
is a “concerted refusal to deal”
with members of minority groups.
In his judgment this constitutes
“consciously parallel action” and
uniform conduct which has, in or
dinary business anti-trust suits,
been considered substantial evi
dence of a combination in re
straint of trade.
Whether Mr. Engel’s legal con
jectures are correct will not be
settled until the matters go to
court. It would be interesting to
hear what the Justice Department
thinks, particularly since it is
now and for sometime to come
likely to be knee-deep in anti
trust action.
On the basis of the data Mr.
Engel has produced it is quite
possible the administration has
another weapon in its arsenal.
IN TESTIFYING before the
Commission, Mr. Engel touched
incidentally on the question of
why Jewish organizations cham
pion the cause of Negro rights.
“For more than 50 years, it has
been a fundamental tenet of the
American Jewish Committee that
the welfare and security of Jews
are inseparably linked to the wel
fare of all Americans, whatever
their racial, religious or ethnic
background may be
“On the other hand, we also
believe that the extension of legal
controls to safeguard and expand
equality of opportunity benefits
the total society as well as those
whose opportunities are specific
ally and directly protected.”
This is a matter of elemental
democracy. But every so often it
needs restating, especially for
those who say they are “tired” of
hearing so much about Negro
rights.
