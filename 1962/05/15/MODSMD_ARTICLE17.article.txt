A FEW POINTS
Editor, The Daily:
I think a few points should be
made about yesterday’s article
concerning Dr. Levin’s letter and
the Sigma Nu membership clause.
Though it was within our pow
er to withhold it, we released Dr.
Levin’s letter at the request of
The Daily, believing it to be a
sincere exposition of a view held
by many faculty members.
We agree with him that mem
bership qualifications based on
race are immoral and undesirable.
Many of us have expended a great
deal of time and effort toward
the end of eliminating the clauses
from the Sigma Nu law which ex
clude Negroes and Orientals from
membership.
WE HAVE written letters,
made phone calls, drawn up pro
posals, contacted people person
ally—all in an effort to enlist sup
port from other chapters for a
vote against the racial restric
tions at our biennial convention
to be held this summer in Pitts
burgh.
1 feel that we can have a great
er effect for the good by doing
our best to remove a clause which
affects nearly 130 other chapters
than we could if we were to with
draw from the national frater
nity before the convention.
Going local at this point, while
it would be a dramatic gesture,
would strike a serious blow at the
effectiveness of the practical,
day-to-day political work which
we and several other chapters are
carrying on in the effort to re
move discrimination from our fra
ternity.
WE HAVE high hopes of suc
cess this summer. The chapter at
Brown University has been lead
ing the campaign on the East
Coast, and they report a number
of votes committed. They also re
port that they have found the
full support—both moral and ma
terial—of faculty, administration,
and the campus newspaper be
hind their efforts. While we re
gret that such full support is ap
parently not forthcoming here,
we are also working with some
success on t he other western
chapters.
The article accompanying Dr.
Levin’s letter was not up to Daily
standards. It failed to present any
of our arguments, and it was mis
leading or inaccurate in several
places.
IT REPORTED, “Sigma Nu
. . . does refuse membership to
Negroes and Orientals.” This is
not true. Because of the sad
dearth of non-Caucasians at Stan
ford, we have never been faced
with the choice of either offering
or refusing membership to a Ne
gro or Oriental. I personally feel
confident that if a Negro or Ori
ental whom we liked and respect
ed wished to join our house, the
national law would be disregard
ed.
The impression was given that
Sigma Nu is quite unusual among
fraternities in having a discrimi
natory policy. While it is quite
true that we are one of two houses
at Stanford operating under ex
plicit racial membership qualifi
cations, the great majority of
fraternities here and nationally
retain “unwritten laws,” or eu
phemistic “socially acceptable”
clauses, which exclude Negroes
from membership across the
board.
We are not, nor will be in the
future, seek any publicity con
cerning our efforts. We ask only
that (1) Dr. Levin note that there
is more than one way to oppose
discrimination, and (2) The Daily
make some effort to present our
position, and at the very least to
get the facts straight, in stories
it prints about our house.

President, Sigma Nu

‘NEW’ ISOLATIONIST
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Weinig was correct in stat
ing he was not an isolationist,
that is an isolationist in the 1939
“keep the boys at home” sense.
It is more accurate to term him
a “new isolationist.”
“New isolationists” do not rec
ognize a neutral nation as such. To
them a “neutral” nation must be
either pro-West or anti-West. If
a neutral nation is pro-Western,
reasons the “new isolationist,” it
should be given all the assistance
we can give. If a given neutral
nation is not pro-Western, how
ever, it is against us and will, as
a new isolationist sees it, inevit
ably turn towards socialism and

communism. Therefore it should
not receive our aid.
This, fortunately, is not the
case. Neutral nations are not in
terested in joining the power
st ruggle between East and West.
They are interested in (1) im
proving their economic standards
and (2) keeping the nuclear
struggle from coming to a head.
And is this not what we are in
terested in, helping to improve
the economic standard of the
world and easing world tension?
This can not be done by forcing
neutral nations to sign a loyalty
oath before giving them aid. This
will only lead to a more pro
nounced division of world powers.
