# Card Soccer Players Edge San Jose, 2-1; Win Peninsula Title
## 
### HOGRG MENDELSON 
As if a full season of NCAA
soccer isn’t exhausting enough,
many of Stanford’s varsity soccer
players have joined with several
grad students, an assistant coach,
a professor of French, and a
physician to form an off-season
team. Led by varsity coach Fred
Priddle, the Stanford Cardinals
are entered in the Peninsula Ama
teur Soccer League, a member of
the United States Soccer-Football
Association.
Operating under international
rules, the Peninsula League plays
from February to May, dividing
the season into two halves; that
is, every team plays each of the
six other teams once in each half
season. The winners of the first
and second halves play off to de
cide the league champion.
The quality of play in the Pen
insula League is exceptionally
high, as all of the teams except
Stanford are soccer clubs com
posed mainly of European-born
players. For most of these play
ers, then, soccer is their national
sport, and most of the time they
have spent in athletics has been
devoted to playing soccer.
Despite this experienced com
petition, the Cardinals easily fin
ished in first place in the first
half of this season with a 5-0-1
record. However, going into the
last game of the second half, last
Friday night, they stood in sec
ond place, half a game behind the
International Soccer Club of San
Jose, whom they were to meet in

this last game. The first half
game between these two teams
had ended in a 2-2 tie, depriving
the Cards of a perfect record for
the first half.
Mike Tippett and Klaus Berg
man scored goals in the first half

to give the Cards a 2-0 lead in
this second game. Meanwhile,
the backs were throwing up a
girdle-tight defense to shut out
the Internationals.
San Jose got a lucky goal off
a defensemen’s leg in the second
half, but the defense, led by San
dy Pofahl, lan Achenbach, Rusty
I Williams, Rich Lonergan, Rernie
j K'naggs, and goalie Dave Dier
dorff hung on for the 2-1 win.
Although they did not score, two
African forwards, Albert Nnoli
and compact Emanuel Andah,
were rugged in the front line for
Stanford.
The victory gave the Cards a
4-1-1 record, the best in the league
for the second half, thus obvi
ating a playoff game and giving
them the Peninsula title.

I Williams, Rich Lonergan, Rernie
j K'naggs, and goalie Dave Dier
dorff hung on for the 2-1 win.
Although they did not score, two
African forwards, Albert Nnoli
and compact Emanuel Andah,
were rugged in the front line for
Stanford.
The victory gave the Cards a
4-1-1 record, the best in the league
for the second half, thus obvi
ating a playoff game and giving
them the Peninsula title.
As if a full season of NCAA
soccer isn’t exhausting enough,
many of Stanford’s varsity soccer
players have joined with several
grad students, an assistant coach,
a professor of French, and a
physician to form an off-season
team. Led by varsity coach Fred
Priddle, the Stanford Cardinals
are entered in the Peninsula Ama
teur Soccer League, a member of
the United States Soccer-Football
Association.
Operating under international
rules, the Peninsula League plays
from February to May, dividing
the season into two halves; that
is, every team plays each of the
six other teams once in each half
season. The winners of the first
and second halves play off to de
cide the league champion.
The quality of play in the Pen
insula League is exceptionally
high, as all of the teams except
Stanford are soccer clubs com
posed mainly of European-born
players. For most of these play
ers, then, soccer is their national
sport, and most of the time they
have spent in athletics has been
devoted to playing soccer.
Despite this experienced com
petition, the Cardinals easily fin
ished in first place in the first
half of this season with a 5-0-1
record. However, going into the
last game of the second half, last
Friday night, they stood in sec
ond place, half a game behind the
International Soccer Club of San
Jose, whom they were to meet in

this last game. The first half
game between these two teams
had ended in a 2-2 tie, depriving
the Cards of a perfect record for
the first half.
Mike Tippett and Klaus Berg
man scored goals in the first half

to give the Cards a 2-0 lead in
this second game. Meanwhile,
the backs were throwing up a
girdle-tight defense to shut out
the Internationals.
San Jose got a lucky goal off
a defensemen’s leg in the second
half, but the defense, led by San
dy Pofahl, lan Achenbach, Rusty
I Williams, Rich Lonergan, Rernie
j K'naggs, and goalie Dave Dier
dorff hung on for the 2-1 win.
