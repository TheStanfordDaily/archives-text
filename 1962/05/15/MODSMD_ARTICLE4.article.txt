# Saaed, Van Syckle Win I-Club Election
## 
### 
The newly-elected president of
the I-Center, M. Saaed, looks for
ward to establishing a program
next year which will provide
more opportunities for foreign
students to become acquainted
with Americans and to travel
within the United States.

After winning the presidential
election on Friday, Saaed said,
"The main function of the I-Club
is to serve as a gathering place
for students from ail countries,
where they can exchange ideas
and cultural viewpoints.
“I am interested in promoting
more activities which will bring
Americans and foreign students
together through Ihese activities,
and I hope to increase interna
tional understanding. Thus, when
the students return to their vari
ous countries, they will have a
broader knowledge on which to
base their future work. To
achieve this goal, we hope and
expect to have the cooperation
of all students and administra
tion,” he said.
SAAED WAS BORN in 1936 in
Kabul, Afghanistan, where he
later received a B.A. in Physical
Chemistry at the Kabul Universi
ty. He came to the United States
to get his M.A. in Mathematics
at the University of Wyoming.
Then, he came to Stanford with
an I.C.A. scholarship to work for
his Ph.D. in Mathematics.
The new president’s platform
is based on the observations that
he has made during his two years
at Stanford of the activities at the
I-Club and the problems of for
eign students. Saaed proposes to
establish cooperative living units
for foreign and American stu
dents who would be able to re
duce their room and board ex
penses in such an arrangement.
SAAED WANTS TO work out
a program so that foreign stu
dents who cannot afford trans
portation costs, will be able to
travel in California and neigh
boring states at little or no ex
pense. He proposes to arrange
for instruction in American social
customs for newly arrived for
eign students who would like to
learn about American social atti

tudes.
Saaed hopes that next year for
eign students will participate in
more undergraduate activities,
such as; dinners in dorms, eating
clubs and fraternities: coffee with
various living groups; participa
tion in social functions of living
groups, including fraternities;
and more action in intramural
athletics.
THE LAST PLANK of his plat
form is to set the date of the In
ternational Ball at a time when
students from other universities
and colleges can attend. The I-
Club programs which have
proved most successful will be
continued during the coming
year.
The newly elected vice presi
dent, Kristina Van Syckle, was a
hostess at the I-Club this year
and helped with the weekly I-Cluh
coffee hours on Friday after
noons.

for students from ail countries,
where they can exchange ideas

“I am interested in promoting
more activities which will bring
Americans and foreign students
together through Ihese activities,
and I hope to increase interna

broader knowledge on which to
base their future work. To
achieve this goal, we hope and
expect to have the cooperation
of all students and administra
tion,” he said.
