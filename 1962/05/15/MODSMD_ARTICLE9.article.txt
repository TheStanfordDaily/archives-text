# Marines Prepare for Battle in Thailand
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (DPl)—President Kennedy yesterday sum
moned congressional leaders to a Laos emergency meeting at the
White House today as 1,000 U.S. marines and probably other
combat forces prepared to go ashore shortly in Thailand.
The battle-ready troops will reinforce 1,000 American soldiers

already moving toward the Me
kong River border with Laos, the
line at which the United States
apparently will take its stand
against any further Communist
advance.
THE NEW U.S. forces will land
in the next few days. An an
nouncement was expected today.
Sources said the troops were dis
patched under a March 6 U.S.-
Thai communique reaffirming
that America will defend Thai
land from Communist attack.
A defense line on the Mekong
would exclude virtually all of
Laos. But informed sources de
nied the United States was writ
ing off the strategically located
Southeast Asian kingdom. They
said Washington was pressing
for a diplomatic settlement.
PRESUMABLY, Kennedy will
toll the congressional leaders
what moves he plans next. As of
now, he does not plan to order
U.S. combat troops into Laos it
self. according to informed
sources. Officials wore said to be
encouraged by the lack of any
new Communist thrusts there in
the past two days.

Invited to the 9:15 a.m. EDT
White House session today were
the Democratic and Republican
leaders of the Senate and House,
plus the chairmen and ranking
GOP members of the Foreign Re
lations and Armed Services Com
mittees.
The State Department said it
still had received “no clearcut in
dication’’ where Russia stands.
The United States has asked the
Kremlin repeatedly to use its in
fluence to restore the year-old
cease-fire, broken 10 days ago
when the Communists began a
thrust that chased royal govern
ment troops out of Northern Laos
and across the Mekong into Thai
land.
INFORMED SOURCES said
U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn
Thompson’s 10-minute meeting
with Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev in Moscow Sunday
was inconclusive in getting a firm
answer from the Soviet Union.
Some military leaders believe
if it comes to that, the United
States should bomb supply bases
in Red China’s Yunnan Province,
which borders Laos and North
Viet Nam. They also favor action
against Hanoi, North Viet Nam’s
capital. But such moves now are
in the realm of speculation.
