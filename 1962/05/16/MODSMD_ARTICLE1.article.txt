## Organization Seeks Aid for 26 SU Delegates to Helsinki 
### NILS WESSELL Associate Editor 
Twenty-six Stanford students
will probably attend the Helsinki
World Youth Festival this sum
mer since the group of 68 Stan
ford individuals voted to coordi
nate with the Independent Re
search Service (IRS) which will
undertake to finance as many of
the 26 delegates as possible.
If enough money is raised by
individuals, then another 25 or 30

students may attend as observers.
By Friday definitive information
on finances should be available.

Scotty Thompson, Jim Morri
son. Joel Meister, Peter Grot he.
and Nancy Sherwood were unani
mously elected to the committee
in charge of finance.
THE AMOUNT of money that
Stanford observers and delegates
can contribute or raise them
selves will determine how many
students will go. The IRS will not
finance non-delegates.
The IRS is a non-profit organi
zation whose purpose is to raise
money for American delegates
and to disseminate information
to them.
Financed by Henry Luce, the
Cabots, and the New World
Foundation among others, the
IRS sets virtually no ideological
criteria for those it finances.
Communists and John Birchers,

however, are not eligible for IRS
aid.

Aside from paying a large part
of the $660 cost for each dele
gateâ€™s round-trip transportation,
the IRS will supply a bibliogra
phy for the reading period and a
lecturer on student youth move
ments for orientation sessions.
AT HELSINKI the IRS will co
ordinate with the students to in
form them of seminars being
held. In 1959 in Vienna the Amer
ican delegates missed the seminar
on colonialism because of faulty
communication.
In an address to the 68 students
the night before last, IRS repre
sentative, Dennis Shaul said the
security risk that a delegate as
sumes is proportional to the de
gree of sanity within the country
in future years.
In order to give the 68 students
some idea of the likelihood of
their going to Helsinki, they are
being sent notice of their rating,
from one to three, with one indi
cating the greatest probability of
attending.
