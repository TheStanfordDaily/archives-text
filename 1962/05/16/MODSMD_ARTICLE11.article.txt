# Indians Bilked, Says

### BILL SMITH 
Timm Williams, Stanford’s Prince Light
fool. charged last Saturday that his people
and six other tribes were being denied their
right to a court hearing by the government.
Appeals made by Lightfoot and other In
dians of the tribes to their representative in
Congress, to Interior Secretary Stewart
Udall and to President Kennedy have met
with little or no success. Neither Kennedy
nor Udall has answered the Indians’ appeal.
Prince Lightfoot is an American Indian
and a member of the Klamath River tribe.
His people and those of seven other tribes
were given a reservation on the Klamath
River almost 100 years ago. This reservation
was approximately 12 square miles in size
and was set up in Humboldt County, in
Northern California.
IN 1891, THE reservation was enlarged
to include a mile strip on cither side of the
Klamath River, running from the original
reservation to the sea, Lightfoot explained.
Indians from all eight ti’ibes, Lightfoot’s
people and those of the seven other tribes,
lived on all parts of the reservation and on
the extension.
In recent years, the timber, copper, iron
and power rights on the original reservation
grant have assumed great value which Light
foot estimates is in excess of $l5O million.
The U.S. government, through the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, has stepped in and made

arrangements with one, and only one, of the
eight tribes inhabiting the reservation to
sell timber, land and other reservation assets,
he said.
THE BUREAU of Indian Affairs told the
Hoopa Indians, one of the eight tribes, to
write a constitution and by-laws for the
reservation. The Bureau said this constitu
tion would bo binding on all of the eight
tribes.
The constitution and by-laws set up a
seven-man executive committee, made up
only of Hoopa Indians, to sell timber and to
distribute the money from the sale. The
government recognized the sole rights of
the Hoopas to sell the timber and govern
the reservation and in effect cancelled the
rights of Lightfoot, his people and the people
of the six other tribes.
To date, more than s3'- million has been
distributed to a select group of Indians,
Lightfoot continued. The money has come
from sale of timber from lands claimed by
Lightfoot, his people and six other tribes.
IN JANUARY’ of this year, a meeting
was called of the seven tribes whose rights
on the reservation proper had been bypassed,
he said. The Indian agent told these seven
tribes that they must sign a constitution
relinquishing all rights to the reservatoin
proper, and, in return, the seven tribes would
be given sole rights to the reservation ex
tension, an area half as small as the reser

vation proper.
The reservation proper has $3O to $4O mil
lion worth of timber, a copper mine, iron
and other minerals, resort areas, a multi
million dollar shopping center, and other
assets, Lightfoot said. The extension has
undeveloped power possibilities worth about
$ll million, and a few resort prospects.
The seven tribes, under Lightfoot’s lead
ership, refused to sign the constitution. As a
result, Lightfoot and other of the Indians
have been refused the right to use even the
extension section of the reservation, an area
in which Lightfoot and the other Indians
own land.
LIGHTFOOT and his people want to go
to court to get a decision on the legality of
the first constitution and by-laws, ho said.
Twenty-two hundred Indians have signed
over a power of attorney to Lightfoot. Light
foot reported that he has tried to retain a
noted San Francisco law firm to defend the
rights of the seven tribes.
The law firm is willing, but duo to a
statute of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the
Indians cannot retain any law firm, for any
reason, without the Bureau’s permission.
Thus far the Bureau has prevented the In
dians from going to court by not approving
the Indians’ choice of attorneys, he said.
“All we ask.” Lightfoot said, “Is a chance
to go to court and present our case, but this
we are net allowed to do. Why?”
