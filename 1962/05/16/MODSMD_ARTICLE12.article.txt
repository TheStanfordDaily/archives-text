# HR Given $20,000 For Book Project

### DAN SCHWARTZ 
Stanford lias received a grant of $20,000 from the Agency for
International Development (AID), an agency of the State De
partment, to be used to finance the HR “Books for East Africa”
Project.
Although the contracts have yet to be signed, Victor 11. Skiles,

the Director of the U.S. AID Mis
sion to East Africa, contacted the
HR and told them that the funds
had been found and that the agen
cy was ready to support the proj
ect.
The book drive, which is jointly
sponsored by the High School and
Africa Desks of the HR, would
send some 100,000 carefully se
lected books, in packets of 200 to
300, to every high school and
teacher training college in Kenya,
Uganda, Tanganlika, and Zanzi
bar, according to Jim Haas, the
chairman of the project.
THE BOOK DRIVE was begun
a year ago last March by the HR.
During the next few months,
most of the high schools in Cali
fornia were informed of the proj
ect and asked to participate by
collecting books and sending them
to Stanford.
Feeling that much of the fail
ure of other such projects had
been a lack of proper selection of
books, the members of the proj
ect, said Haas, have spent a great
amount of time attempting to
carefully select those books which
would be useful and meaningful
to the people of Africa.
Over 75,000 books have already
been collected, Haas said, al
though they have been forced to
discard 25,000 of them.
THE DISTRIBUTION arrange
ments, said Haas, have been care
fully worked out to guarantee
that the books sent to a particu
lar school were needed by that
school.
The Ministers of Education and
AID officers and Stanford gradu
ates teaching in each African
country concerned with the pro
gram were contacted, and queried
about the book needs in their
jurisdiction.
The African member libraries
will request specific types and
titles of books from the project
warehouse. The Africa Desk will
then pack consignments for each
receiving library reparately for
shipment.
THE BOOKS will be shipped
from San Francisco to Africa in
about ten separate monthly ship
ments. There will probably bo,
Haas felt, over 125 tons of books
sent. This, he said, will take up
more than half of the $20,000.
Arrangements have been made
in Africa to deliver each ship
ment as books as close to each
school as possible. Most of the
shipments, Haas said, will go to
the regional educational offices
where they will be picked up by
the schools.
AN EVEN MORE important
part of the project, Haas felt, was
the lines of communication that
would be opened between the Af
rican schools and California
schools.
“It is hoped,” Haas said, “that
with the increased interest in Af
rica that the drive would create
in (he participating schools in Cal
ifornia, there would be a great
amount of exchange between
brother schools.”

to Stanford.
Feeling that much of the fail
ure of other such projects had
been a lack of proper selection of
books, the members of the proj
ect, said Haas, have spent a great
amount of time attempting to
carefully select those books which
would be useful and meaningful
to the people of Africa.
Over 75,000 books have already
been collected, Haas said, al
though they have been forced to
discard 25,000 of them.
THE DISTRIBUTION arrange
ments, said Haas, have been care
fully worked out to guarantee
that the books sent to a particu
lar school were needed by that
school.
The Ministers of Education and
AID officers and Stanford gradu
ates teaching in each African
country concerned with the pro
gram were contacted, and queried
about the book needs in their
jurisdiction.
The African member libraries
will request specific types and
titles of books from the project
warehouse. The Africa Desk will
then pack consignments for each
receiving library reparately for
shipment.
THE BOOKS will be shipped
from San Francisco to Africa in
about ten separate monthly ship
ments. There will probably bo,
Haas felt, over 125 tons of books
sent. This, he said, will take up
more than half of the $20,000.
Arrangements have been made
in Africa to deliver each ship
ment as books as close to each
school as possible. Most of the
shipments, Haas said, will go to
the regional educational offices
where they will be picked up by
the schools.
AN EVEN MORE important
part of the project, Haas felt, was
the lines of communication that
would be opened between the Af
rican schools and California
schools.
“It is hoped,” Haas said, “that
with the increased interest in Af
rica that the drive would create
in (he participating schools in Cal
ifornia, there would be a great
amount of exchange between
brother schools.”
Stanford lias received a grant of $20,000 from the Agency for
International Development (AID), an agency of the State De
partment, to be used to finance the HR “Books for East Africa”
Project.
Although the contracts have yet to be signed, Victor 11. Skiles,

the Director of the U.S. AID Mis
sion to East Africa, contacted the
HR and told them that the funds
had been found and that the agen
cy was ready to support the proj
ect.
The book drive, which is jointly
sponsored by the High School and
Africa Desks of the HR, would
send some 100,000 carefully se
lected books, in packets of 200 to
300, to every high school and
teacher training college in Kenya,
Uganda, Tanganlika, and Zanzi
bar, according to Jim Haas, the
chairman of the project.
THE BOOK DRIVE was begun
a year ago last March by the HR.
During the next few months,
most of the high schools in Cali
fornia were informed of the proj
ect and asked to participate by
collecting books and sending them
to Stanford.
