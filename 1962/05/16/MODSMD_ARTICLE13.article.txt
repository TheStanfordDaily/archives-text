# LATIN AMERICAN EXPERT SUGGESTS
## Alliance for Progress Helped Undermine Frondizi 
### 
By BOV SCHMIDT
In some ways the United States’
Alliance for Progress helped to
undermine the government of
President Arturo Frondizi in Ar
gentina and was a partial cause
of his fall last March.
This was the suggestion of
John J. Johnson, Stanford pro
fessor of Latin American history,
when asked to comment on the
military takeover in that country.
“There are so many questions
and contradictions about this
thing that I hate to speculate,’’ he
said.
The present austerity terms of
the Alliance make it very difficult
for a representative government
to maintain popular support, lie
pointed out. In Argentina and
other Latin American countries
the entrenched interests escape
the burden of austerity which
then must he shouldered by the
working classes.
This has led to great discontent

and may be a partial cause for
the fall of Quadros in Brazil and
Iberra in Equador as well as
Frondizi.
TO EMPHASIZE how litt’e is
actually known about what is go
ing on in Argentina, Johnson
pointed out a number of contra
dictions which have arisen from
the takeover.
• In 1955 and 1958 the United
States lauded the Argentine mili
tary for its intervention; now
when it steps in, it; is considered
a strong blow to Argentine de
mocracy.
• To American eyes Frondizi
has loomed as a champion of de
mocracy and constitutionalism.
Yet in recent years he has denied
the Peronist partisans their right
to nominate candidates and has
ruled largely by legislative de
cree.
• In 1954-55 the United States
looked on Gainza Paz, owner of
La Prensa, one of Argentina’s

most influential newspapers, as
a stalwart of democracy. But now
he has come out in favor of the
military takeover.
THE POSITION of Gainza Paz
is one factor which leads Johnson
to believe that things might not
be as bad as U.S. experts fear.
“But when Romulo Bentencourt,
a man I respect a great deal, has
strongly opposed the change and
has asked all Latin American na
tions to deny recognition to the
new regime,” he adds. “I really
don’t know what to think; I don't
think anybody does.”
The takeover occurred when
Frondizi managed to convince
military opposition to allow the
Peronists a place on the ballot
in the March congressional elec
tions. The Peronist parties then
won 44 of the 86 congressional
seats contested and nine of the 14
provincial governorships.
Although Frondizi’s Intransi
gents polled 540,000 more votes

than in 1960, they lost 21 seats
and control of congress along
with five governorships.
This show of strength coupled
with Frondizi’s refusal to cut off
diplomatic relations with Cuba
despite U.S. pressure stirred the
military to action.
“OF C'OURSK, the big question
in my mind is whether or not
Frondi/.i merely miscalculated the
strength of the Peronists," John
son continued. There is evidence
that politicians in Latin America
can’t always tell what is going to
happen, but Frondlzi knew that
anywhere from 20 to 40 per cent
of the voting populace had con
tinually cast blank ballots in pro
test.
It is possible that he was look
ing to 1964 and realized his party
could not win without Peronist
support, lie may have planned the
election as part of an integration
program to form a coalition be
tween his own Intransigents and
the Peron elements, Frondizi may
have been proposing a kind of
“White Peronism” Peronism
without Peron himself.
“I think basically Frondizi was
on the right track. I don’t go for
this ‘White Peronism’ idea,” John
son said. Ho was ruling with the
support of the military and the
United States, and the country
had shown some economic recov
ery, The hope is (hat somewhere
in Argentina there is a man of his
capabilities who can do the same
thing.
MANY HAVE called Frondizi’s
overthrow a death blow to Ar
gentine democracy, but Johnson
questions that conclusion. “This
may be a blow to constitutional
ism. but it is not necessarily a
blow to democracy. I’m not sure
that we can call the Frondizi gov
ernment democratic.”
Frondizi was interested in pow
er, not democracy. He took office
with consent of the military and
would have been ousted several
times had it not been for its sup
port. “The armed forces wore the
locus of power during the Fron
dizi regime,” Johnson said.
The democratic elements have
not shown any real willingness to
forget their class-bound politics
in favor of substantive democratic
procedures. It may he that Ar

| genline institutions are too weak
I to withstand government by the
people in this time of rapid
i change. “The real tragedy as ]
[ see it,” Johnson said, “is not that
i Frondizi was removed from of
; fice, but that there just isn’t any
thing better on the political hori
zon.”
THIS WAS NOT a typical mili
! I ary takeover. Although many
| Frondizi supporters have gone in
j to exile, there has been no notable
| suppression of liberty. There has
j been no effort to muffle the press
I or to control other modes of mass
communication.
| The armed forces in Argentina
I are extremely conservative, John
son pointed out, hut this does not
mean that they are fascist. The
Navy is perhaps the most con
servative branch and apparently
applierl most of the pressure in
the Frondizi fall.
JOHNSON anticipates a split in
the military over the issue of in
tegrating the Peronists back into
active political life. This split may
balance out the military pressure
on government and enable civili
ans to regain control. “I don’t
know when it will come. It could
be six months or it could he six
years, but I think it IS coming,”
he said.
A number of questions still re
main for the future:
• Will the U.S. continue to aid
Argentina after Ambassador Rob
ert McClintock’s reported threat
j at the height of the crisis that the
I Alliance would not support a mil
itary dictatorship? Johnson be
lieves U.S. aid will continue, for
Argentina is too important a
country to fail to develop it.
• How can the Peronists be in
tegrated into politics? Argentina
cannot have democracy so long
as 20 to 40 per cent of the people
can’t support their candidates.
• How long can the Peronists
resist communist wooing? Rogel
io Frigerio, banished economic
j adviser to the president, claims
j that only Frondizi can prevent
the Peronists from joining with
j the communists. Johnson refused
to speculate on this point but
j pointed out that it is not merely
j a choice between integration and
I communism it is not that
' simple.

son continued. There is evidence
that politicians in Latin America
can’t always tell what is going to
happen, but Frondlzi knew that
anywhere from 20 to 40 per cent
of the voting populace had con
tinually cast blank ballots in pro
test.
It is possible that he was look
ing to 1964 and realized his party
could not win without Peronist
support, lie may have planned the
election as part of an integration
program to form a coalition be
tween his own Intransigents and
the Peron elements, Frondizi may
have been proposing a kind of
“White Peronism” Peronism
without Peron himself.
“I think basically Frondizi was
on the right track. I don’t go for
this ‘White Peronism’ idea,” John
son said. Ho was ruling with the
support of the military and the
United States, and the country
had shown some economic recov
ery, The hope is (hat somewhere
in Argentina there is a man of his
capabilities who can do the same
thing.
MANY HAVE called Frondizi’s
overthrow a death blow to Ar
gentine democracy, but Johnson
questions that conclusion. “This
may be a blow to constitutional
ism. but it is not necessarily a
blow to democracy. I’m not sure
that we can call the Frondizi gov
ernment democratic.”
Frondizi was interested in pow
er, not democracy. He took office
with consent of the military and
would have been ousted several
times had it not been for its sup
port. “The armed forces wore the
locus of power during the Fron
dizi regime,” Johnson said.
The democratic elements have
not shown any real willingness to
forget their class-bound politics
in favor of substantive democratic
procedures. It may he that Ar

| genline institutions are too weak
I to withstand government by the
people in this time of rapid
i change. “The real tragedy as ]
[ see it,” Johnson said, “is not that
i Frondizi was removed from of
; fice, but that there just isn’t any
thing better on the political hori
zon.”
THIS WAS NOT a typical mili
! I ary takeover. Although many
| Frondizi supporters have gone in
j to exile, there has been no notable

j been no effort to muffle the press
I or to control other modes of mass
communication.
| The armed forces in Argentina
I are extremely conservative, John
son pointed out, hut this does not
mean that they are fascist. The
Navy is perhaps the most con
servative branch and apparently
applierl most of the pressure in
the Frondizi fall.
JOHNSON anticipates a split in
the military over the issue of in
tegrating the Peronists back into
active political life. This split may
balance out the military pressure
on government and enable civili
ans to regain control. “I don’t
know when it will come. It could
be six months or it could he six
years, but I think it IS coming,”
he said.
A number of questions still re
main for the future:
• Will the U.S. continue to aid
Argentina after Ambassador Rob
ert McClintock’s reported threat
j at the height of the crisis that the
I Alliance would not support a mil
itary dictatorship? Johnson be
lieves U.S. aid will continue, for
Argentina is too important a
country to fail to develop it.
• How can the Peronists be in
tegrated into politics? Argentina
cannot have democracy so long
as 20 to 40 per cent of the people
can’t support their candidates.
• How long can the Peronists
resist communist wooing? Rogel
io Frigerio, banished economic
j adviser to the president, claims
j that only Frondizi can prevent
the Peronists from joining with

In some ways the United States’
Alliance for Progress helped to
undermine the government of
President Arturo Frondizi in Ar
gentina and was a partial cause
of his fall last March.
This was the suggestion of
John J. Johnson, Stanford pro
fessor of Latin American history,
when asked to comment on the
military takeover in that country.
“There are so many questions
and contradictions about this
thing that I hate to speculate,’’ he
said.
The present austerity terms of
the Alliance make it very difficult
for a representative government
to maintain popular support, lie
pointed out. In Argentina and
other Latin American countries
the entrenched interests escape
the burden of austerity which
then must he shouldered by the
working classes.
This has led to great discontent

and may be a partial cause for
the fall of Quadros in Brazil and
Iberra in Equador as well as
Frondizi.
TO EMPHASIZE how litt’e is
actually known about what is go
ing on in Argentina, Johnson
pointed out a number of contra
dictions which have arisen from
the takeover.
• In 1955 and 1958 the United
States lauded the Argentine mili
tary for its intervention; now
when it steps in, it; is considered
a strong blow to Argentine de
mocracy.
• To American eyes Frondizi
has loomed as a champion of de
mocracy and constitutionalism.
Yet in recent years he has denied
the Peronist partisans their right
to nominate candidates and has
ruled largely by legislative de
cree.
• In 1954-55 the United States
looked on Gainza Paz, owner of
La Prensa, one of Argentina’s

most influential newspapers, as
a stalwart of democracy. But now
he has come out in favor of the
military takeover.
THE POSITION of Gainza Paz
is one factor which leads Johnson
to believe that things might not
be as bad as U.S. experts fear.
“But when Romulo Bentencourt,
a man I respect a great deal, has
strongly opposed the change and
has asked all Latin American na
tions to deny recognition to the
new regime,” he adds. “I really
don’t know what to think; I don't
think anybody does.”
The takeover occurred when
Frondizi managed to convince
military opposition to allow the
Peronists a place on the ballot
in the March congressional elec
tions. The Peronist parties then
won 44 of the 86 congressional
seats contested and nine of the 14
provincial governorships.
Although Frondizi’s Intransi
gents polled 540,000 more votes

than in 1960, they lost 21 seats
and control of congress along
with five governorships.
This show of strength coupled
with Frondizi’s refusal to cut off
diplomatic relations with Cuba
despite U.S. pressure stirred the
military to action.
“OF C'OURSK, the big question
in my mind is whether or not
Frondi/.i merely miscalculated the
strength of the Peronists," John
son continued. There is evidence
that politicians in Latin America

cannot have democracy so long

resist communist wooing? Rogel

In some ways the United States’
Alliance for Progress helped to
undermine the government of
President Arturo Frondizi in Ar
gentina and was a partial cause
of his fall last March.
This was the suggestion of
John J. Johnson, Stanford pro
fessor of Latin American history,
when asked to comment on the
military takeover in that country.
“There are so many questions
and contradictions about this
thing that I hate to speculate,’’ he
said.
The present austerity terms of
the Alliance make it very difficult
for a representative government
to maintain popular support, lie
pointed out. In Argentina and
other Latin American countries
the entrenched interests escape
the burden of austerity which
then must he shouldered by the
working classes.
This has led to great discontent

and may be a partial cause for
the fall of Quadros in Brazil and
Iberra in Equador as well as
Frondizi.
TO EMPHASIZE how litt’e is
actually known about what is go
ing on in Argentina, Johnson
pointed out a number of contra
dictions which have arisen from
the takeover.
• In 1955 and 1958 the United
States lauded the Argentine mili
tary for its intervention; now
when it steps in, it; is considered
a strong blow to Argentine de
mocracy.
• To American eyes Frondizi
has loomed as a champion of de
mocracy and constitutionalism.
Yet in recent years he has denied
the Peronist partisans their right
to nominate candidates and has
ruled largely by legislative de
cree.
• In 1954-55 the United States
looked on Gainza Paz, owner of
La Prensa, one of Argentina’s

most influential newspapers, as
a stalwart of democracy. But now
he has come out in favor of the
military takeover.
THE POSITION of Gainza Paz
is one factor which leads Johnson
to believe that things might not
be as bad as U.S. experts fear.
“But when Romulo Bentencourt,
a man I respect a great deal, has
strongly opposed the change and
has asked all Latin American na
tions to deny recognition to the
new regime,” he adds. “I really
don’t know what to think; I don't
think anybody does.”
The takeover occurred when
Frondizi managed to convince
military opposition to allow the
Peronists a place on the ballot
in the March congressional elec
tions. The Peronist parties then
won 44 of the 86 congressional
seats contested and nine of the 14
provincial governorships.
Although Frondizi’s Intransi
gents polled 540,000 more votes

than in 1960, they lost 21 seats
and control of congress along
with five governorships.
This show of strength coupled
with Frondizi’s refusal to cut off
diplomatic relations with Cuba
despite U.S. pressure stirred the
military to action.
“OF C'OURSK, the big question
in my mind is whether or not
Frondi/.i merely miscalculated the
strength of the Peronists," John
son continued. There is evidence
that politicians in Latin America
can’t always tell what is going to
happen, but Frondlzi knew that
anywhere from 20 to 40 per cent
of the voting populace had con
tinually cast blank ballots in pro
test.
It is possible that he was look
ing to 1964 and realized his party
could not win without Peronist
support, lie may have planned the
election as part of an integration
program to form a coalition be
tween his own Intransigents and
the Peron elements, Frondizi may
have been proposing a kind of
“White Peronism” Peronism
without Peron himself.
“I think basically Frondizi was
on the right track. I don’t go for
this ‘White Peronism’ idea,” John
son said. Ho was ruling with the
support of the military and the
United States, and the country
had shown some economic recov
ery, The hope is (hat somewhere
in Argentina there is a man of his
capabilities who can do the same
thing.
MANY HAVE called Frondizi’s
overthrow a death blow to Ar
gentine democracy, but Johnson
questions that conclusion. “This
may be a blow to constitutional
ism. but it is not necessarily a
blow to democracy. I’m not sure
that we can call the Frondizi gov
ernment democratic.”
Frondizi was interested in pow
er, not democracy. He took office
with consent of the military and
would have been ousted several
times had it not been for its sup
port. “The armed forces wore the
locus of power during the Fron
dizi regime,” Johnson said.
The democratic elements have
not shown any real willingness to
forget their class-bound politics
in favor of substantive democratic
procedures. It may he that Ar

| genline institutions are too weak
I to withstand government by the
people in this time of rapid
i change. “The real tragedy as ]
[ see it,” Johnson said, “is not that
i Frondizi was removed from of
; fice, but that there just isn’t any
thing better on the political hori
zon.”
THIS WAS NOT a typical mili
! I ary takeover. Although many
| Frondizi supporters have gone in
j to exile, there has been no notable
| suppression of liberty. There has
j been no effort to muffle the press
I or to control other modes of mass
communication.
| The armed forces in Argentina
I are extremely conservative, John
son pointed out, hut this does not
mean that they are fascist. The
Navy is perhaps the most con
servative branch and apparently
applierl most of the pressure in
the Frondizi fall.
JOHNSON anticipates a split in
the military over the issue of in
tegrating the Peronists back into
active political life. This split may
balance out the military pressure
on government and enable civili
ans to regain control. “I don’t
know when it will come. It could
be six months or it could he six
years, but I think it IS coming,”
he said.

don’t know what to think; I don't
think anybody does.”
The takeover occurred when
Frondizi managed to convince
military opposition to allow the
Peronists a place on the ballot
in the March congressional elec
tions. The Peronist parties then
won 44 of the 86 congressional
seats contested and nine of the 14
provincial governorships.
Although Frondizi’s Intransi
gents polled 540,000 more votes

than in 1960, they lost 21 seats
and control of congress along
with five governorships.
This show of strength coupled
with Frondizi’s refusal to cut off
diplomatic relations with Cuba
despite U.S. pressure stirred the
military to action.
“OF C'OURSK, the big question
in my mind is whether or not
Frondi/.i merely miscalculated the
strength of the Peronists," John
son continued. There is evidence
that politicians in Latin America
can’t always tell what is going to
happen, but Frondlzi knew that
anywhere from 20 to 40 per cent
of the voting populace had con
tinually cast blank ballots in pro
test.
It is possible that he was look
ing to 1964 and realized his party
could not win without Peronist
support, lie may have planned the
election as part of an integration
program to form a coalition be
tween his own Intransigents and
the Peron elements, Frondizi may
have been proposing a kind of
“White Peronism” Peronism
without Peron himself.
“I think basically Frondizi was
on the right track. I don’t go for
this ‘White Peronism’ idea,” John
son said. Ho was ruling with the
support of the military and the
United States, and the country
had shown some economic recov
ery, The hope is (hat somewhere
in Argentina there is a man of his
capabilities who can do the same
thing.
MANY HAVE called Frondizi’s
overthrow a death blow to Ar
gentine democracy, but Johnson
questions that conclusion. “This
may be a blow to constitutional
ism. but it is not necessarily a
blow to democracy. I’m not sure
that we can call the Frondizi gov
ernment democratic.”
Frondizi was interested in pow
er, not democracy. He took office
with consent of the military and
would have been ousted several
times had it not been for its sup
port. “The armed forces wore the
locus of power during the Fron
dizi regime,” Johnson said.
The democratic elements have
not shown any real willingness to
forget their class-bound politics
in favor of substantive democratic
procedures. It may he that Ar

| genline institutions are too weak
I to withstand government by the
people in this time of rapid
i change. “The real tragedy as ]
[ see it,” Johnson said, “is not that
i Frondizi was removed from of
; fice, but that there just isn’t any
thing better on the political hori
zon.”
THIS WAS NOT a typical mili
! I ary takeover. Although many
| Frondizi supporters have gone in
j to exile, there has been no notable
| suppression of liberty. There has
j been no effort to muffle the press
I or to control other modes of mass
communication.
| The armed forces in Argentina
I are extremely conservative, John
son pointed out, hut this does not
mean that they are fascist. The
Navy is perhaps the most con
servative branch and apparently
applierl most of the pressure in
the Frondizi fall.
JOHNSON anticipates a split in
the military over the issue of in
tegrating the Peronists back into
active political life. This split may
balance out the military pressure
on government and enable civili
ans to regain control. “I don’t
know when it will come. It could
be six months or it could he six
years, but I think it IS coming,”
he said.
A number of questions still re
main for the future:
• Will the U.S. continue to aid
Argentina after Ambassador Rob
ert McClintock’s reported threat
j at the height of the crisis that the
I Alliance would not support a mil
itary dictatorship? Johnson be
lieves U.S. aid will continue, for
Argentina is too important a
country to fail to develop it.
• How can the Peronists be in
tegrated into politics? Argentina
cannot have democracy so long
as 20 to 40 per cent of the people
can’t support their candidates.
• How long can the Peronists
resist communist wooing? Rogel
io Frigerio, banished economic
j adviser to the president, claims
j that only Frondizi can prevent
the Peronists from joining with
j the communists. Johnson refused
to speculate on this point but
j pointed out that it is not merely

In some ways the United States’
Alliance for Progress helped to
undermine the government of
President Arturo Frondizi in Ar
gentina and was a partial cause
of his fall last March.
This was the suggestion of
John J. Johnson, Stanford pro
fessor of Latin American history,
when asked to comment on the
military takeover in that country.
“There are so many questions
and contradictions about this
thing that I hate to speculate,’’ he
said.
The present austerity terms of
the Alliance make it very difficult
for a representative government
to maintain popular support, lie
pointed out. In Argentina and
other Latin American countries
the entrenched interests escape
the burden of austerity which
then must he shouldered by the
working classes.
This has led to great discontent

and may be a partial cause for
the fall of Quadros in Brazil and
Iberra in Equador as well as
Frondizi.
TO EMPHASIZE how litt’e is
actually known about what is go
ing on in Argentina, Johnson
pointed out a number of contra
dictions which have arisen from
the takeover.
• In 1955 and 1958 the United
States lauded the Argentine mili
tary for its intervention; now
when it steps in, it; is considered
a strong blow to Argentine de
mocracy.
• To American eyes Frondizi
has loomed as a champion of de
mocracy and constitutionalism.
Yet in recent years he has denied
the Peronist partisans their right
to nominate candidates and has
ruled largely by legislative de
cree.
• In 1954-55 the United States
looked on Gainza Paz, owner of
La Prensa, one of Argentina’s

most influential newspapers, as
a stalwart of democracy. But now
he has come out in favor of the
military takeover.
THE POSITION of Gainza Paz
is one factor which leads Johnson
to believe that things might not
be as bad as U.S. experts fear.
“But when Romulo Bentencourt,
a man I respect a great deal, has
strongly opposed the change and
has asked all Latin American na
tions to deny recognition to the
new regime,” he adds. “I really
don’t know what to think; I don't
think anybody does.”
