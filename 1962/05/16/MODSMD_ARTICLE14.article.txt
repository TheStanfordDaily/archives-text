THE CHARTER
Editor, The Daily:
As members of the Stanford
Student American Medical Asso-1
ciation, we expressed our views I
on certain issues which were to I
he presented for a vote at the Na-1
tional Convention of the Associa- 1
tion. Controversy arose over the!
legitimacy of the voting proce
dures employed. The controversy
became newsworthy in the eyes
of the San Francisco Chronicle,
in which a short, somewhat inac
curate, blurb appeared.
It was brought to the attention
of the spokesmen for the oppos
ing sides by Dean Alway that
President Sterling was concerned
that the Medical Students were
violating the charter of the Uni
versity by attaching the name,
Stanford, to a published political
opinion. It was strongly suggest
ed that the students concerned
should reconsider polling the med
ical student body on the King-An
derson Bill, as a means of clari
fying the representative nature of
the previous vote. Wo were, in ef
fect told that the vote should not
take place, because the newspaper
might again take the liberty of
reporting its,, outcome.
THERE ARE several issues
raised by this sequence of events.
My understanding of the charter
is that Stanford, as a university,
in order to maintain its image as
one which promotes creative in
dependent thought, will not ally
itself with any one particular ide
ological approach.
University is used in the widest
sense, i.e„ the sum total of the
undergraduate-graduate bodies,
research institutes, administra
tions of the various schools, and
any affiliates. But I think that
one would have to construe the
charter extremely loosely to con
clude that student organizations
within the university cannot poll
their members to determine the
opinions of those members on con
troversiai issues of major concern
to them, for fear that the vote
might be publicized.
DOES THE President of this
university wish to create an at
mosphere of "appropriate
thought,” or does he mean (he
King-Anderson Bill is too contro
versial an issue to he raised, but
that the medical students are free
to vote on any noncontroversial
matters of business.
It may be impolitic for us to
create a disturbance whose out
come might embarrass some of

1 Stanford’s more well-heeled sup
j porters. If wo are not permitted
; to raise and discuss this kind of
i issue, we don’t think that Stan
{ ford can expect to meet its aims.
! as stated in the charter. All too
j often, expediency overwhelms
I one’s attempts at honesty. We
think the university, above all.
should be a society in which one
is most free to express his politi
cal and social beliefs.
If the President would prefer,
SAMA could change its name to
(he Palo Alto Student Medical As
sociation, and thus spare him and
the University any further em
barrassment at its behavior.

I was very pleased to hear that
many students at Stanford Uni
versity are interested in seeing
their student government affili
ate with the United States Nation
al Student Association. I thought
perhaps as a member of the stu
dent government at another large
university, 1 could describe to you
some of the benefits our school,
the University of Wisconsin, has
derived from membership in
USNSA, The University of Wis
consin has been a member of
USNSA since its inception in 1947
and, in fact, the first national stu
dent congress was held on our
campus.
Some of the student govern
ment programs which we have in
stituted at Wisconsin as a result
of our contact with USNSA are
the symposium program—a lec
ture series on pertinent contem
porary topics featuring such
speakers as Ralph Bundle; an
exam file; a program putting
ROTC on a non-compulsory basis;
involvement in the foreign stu
dent leader ship project which has
created greater international
awareness in the student body.
ANOTHER loss tangible result
has been an increased depth and
meaningfulness in the whole con
cept of student government. This
has been gained not only through
participation in NSA Congresses
and other assemblies, but also
through training programs and
seminars which the association
has sponsored. Among these are
the Student Body President Con
ference, the NSA Coordinators
Conference, the International Stu
dent Relations Seminar, the Aims

of Education Conference and the
Overseas Press Conference.
Perhaps one of the best sum
maries of the benefits of NSA
membership is the comment of a
former student body president
hero at Wisconsin, “When I was
student body president, the mem
bers of my executive committee
who consistently did ambitious
and creative work throughout the
year were those who had attend
ed NSA Congress; the ones who
had to bo goaded and prompted
were those who had not.”
BESIDES affecting members of
the student government, NSA has
created in the student body an
awareness of the pressing issues
not only of the academic commu
nity but of society as a whole.
I sincerely hope that the at
tempt to affiliate Stanford with
the United States National Stu
dent Association will be success
ful. If you have any question,
feel free to ask me or to contact
the national USNSA office, 3457

As members of the Stanford
Student American Medical Asso-1
ciation, we expressed our views I
on certain issues which were to I
he presented for a vote at the Na-1
tional Convention of the Associa- 1
tion. Controversy arose over the!
legitimacy of the voting proce
dures employed. The controversy
became newsworthy in the eyes
of the San Francisco Chronicle,
in which a short, somewhat inac
curate, blurb appeared.
It was brought to the attention
of the spokesmen for the oppos
ing sides by Dean Alway that
President Sterling was concerned
that the Medical Students were
violating the charter of the Uni
versity by attaching the name,
Stanford, to a published political
opinion. It was strongly suggest
ed that the students concerned
should reconsider polling the med
ical student body on the King-An
derson Bill, as a means of clari
fying the representative nature of
the previous vote. Wo were, in ef
fect told that the vote should not
take place, because the newspaper
might again take the liberty of
reporting its,, outcome.
THERE ARE several issues
raised by this sequence of events.
My understanding of the charter
is that Stanford, as a university,
in order to maintain its image as
one which promotes creative in
dependent thought, will not ally
itself with any one particular ide
ological approach.
University is used in the widest
sense, i.e„ the sum total of the
undergraduate-graduate bodies,
research institutes, administra
tions of the various schools, and
any affiliates. But I think that
one would have to construe the
charter extremely loosely to con
clude that student organizations
within the university cannot poll
their members to determine the
opinions of those members on con
troversiai issues of major concern
to them, for fear that the vote
might be publicized.
DOES THE President of this
university wish to create an at
mosphere of "appropriate
thought,” or does he mean (he
King-Anderson Bill is too contro
versial an issue to he raised, but
that the medical students are free
to vote on any noncontroversial
matters of business.
It may be impolitic for us to
create a disturbance whose out
come might embarrass some of

1 Stanford’s more well-heeled sup
j porters. If wo are not permitted
; to raise and discuss this kind of
i issue, we don’t think that Stan
{ ford can expect to meet its aims.
! as stated in the charter. All too
j often, expediency overwhelms
I one’s attempts at honesty. We
think the university, above all.
should be a society in which one
is most free to express his politi
cal and social beliefs.
If the President would prefer,
SAMA could change its name to
(he Palo Alto Student Medical As
sociation, and thus spare him and
the University any further em
barrassment at its behavior.

I was very pleased to hear that
many students at Stanford Uni
versity are interested in seeing
their student government affili
ate with the United States Nation
al Student Association. I thought
perhaps as a member of the stu
dent government at another large
university, 1 could describe to you
some of the benefits our school,
the University of Wisconsin, has
derived from membership in
USNSA, The University of Wis
consin has been a member of
USNSA since its inception in 1947
and, in fact, the first national stu
dent congress was held on our
campus.
Some of the student govern
ment programs which we have in
stituted at Wisconsin as a result
of our contact with USNSA are
the symposium program—a lec
ture series on pertinent contem
porary topics featuring such
speakers as Ralph Bundle; an
exam file; a program putting
ROTC on a non-compulsory basis;
involvement in the foreign stu
dent leader ship project which has
created greater international
awareness in the student body.
ANOTHER loss tangible result
has been an increased depth and
meaningfulness in the whole con
cept of student government. This
has been gained not only through
participation in NSA Congresses
and other assemblies, but also
through training programs and
seminars which the association
has sponsored. Among these are
the Student Body President Con

Conference, the International Stu

dent congress was held on our
campus.
Some of the student govern
ment programs which we have in
stituted at Wisconsin as a result
of our contact with USNSA are
the symposium program—a lec
ture series on pertinent contem
porary topics featuring such
speakers as Ralph Bundle; an
exam file; a program putting
ROTC on a non-compulsory basis;
involvement in the foreign stu
dent leader ship project which has
created greater international
awareness in the student body.
ANOTHER loss tangible result
has been an increased depth and
meaningfulness in the whole con
cept of student government. This
has been gained not only through
participation in NSA Congresses
and other assemblies, but also
through training programs and
seminars which the association
has sponsored. Among these are
the Student Body President Con
ference, the NSA Coordinators
Conference, the International Stu
dent Relations Seminar, the Aims

of Education Conference and the
Overseas Press Conference.
Perhaps one of the best sum
maries of the benefits of NSA
membership is the comment of a
former student body president
hero at Wisconsin, “When I was
student body president, the mem
bers of my executive committee
who consistently did ambitious
and creative work throughout the
year were those who had attend
ed NSA Congress; the ones who
had to bo goaded and prompted
were those who had not.”
BESIDES affecting members of
the student government, NSA has
created in the student body an
awareness of the pressing issues
not only of the academic commu
nity but of society as a whole.
I sincerely hope that the at
tempt to affiliate Stanford with
the United States National Stu
dent Association will be success
ful. If you have any question,

As members of the Stanford
Student American Medical Asso-1
ciation, we expressed our views I
on certain issues which were to I
he presented for a vote at the Na-1
tional Convention of the Associa- 1
tion. Controversy arose over the!
legitimacy of the voting proce
dures employed. The controversy
became newsworthy in the eyes
of the San Francisco Chronicle,
in which a short, somewhat inac
curate, blurb appeared.
It was brought to the attention
of the spokesmen for the oppos
ing sides by Dean Alway that
President Sterling was concerned
that the Medical Students were
violating the charter of the Uni
versity by attaching the name,
Stanford, to a published political
opinion. It was strongly suggest
ed that the students concerned
should reconsider polling the med
ical student body on the King-An
derson Bill, as a means of clari
fying the representative nature of
the previous vote. Wo were, in ef
fect told that the vote should not
take place, because the newspaper
might again take the liberty of
reporting its,, outcome.
THERE ARE several issues
raised by this sequence of events.
My understanding of the charter
is that Stanford, as a university,
in order to maintain its image as
one which promotes creative in
dependent thought, will not ally
itself with any one particular ide
ological approach.
University is used in the widest
sense, i.e„ the sum total of the
undergraduate-graduate bodies,
research institutes, administra
tions of the various schools, and
any affiliates. But I think that
one would have to construe the
charter extremely loosely to con
clude that student organizations
within the university cannot poll
their members to determine the
opinions of those members on con
troversiai issues of major concern
to them, for fear that the vote
might be publicized.
DOES THE President of this
university wish to create an at
mosphere of "appropriate
thought,” or does he mean (he
King-Anderson Bill is too contro
versial an issue to he raised, but
that the medical students are free
to vote on any noncontroversial
matters of business.
It may be impolitic for us to
create a disturbance whose out
come might embarrass some of

1 Stanford’s more well-heeled sup
j porters. If wo are not permitted
; to raise and discuss this kind of
i issue, we don’t think that Stan
{ ford can expect to meet its aims.
! as stated in the charter. All too
j often, expediency overwhelms
I one’s attempts at honesty. We
think the university, above all.
should be a society in which one
is most free to express his politi
cal and social beliefs.
If the President would prefer,
SAMA could change its name to
(he Palo Alto Student Medical As
sociation, and thus spare him and
the University any further em
barrassment at its behavior.
