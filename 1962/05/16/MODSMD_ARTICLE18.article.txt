# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## 
### Glenn Alford 
Stanford is in grave danger of losing Track Coach Payton
Jordan to Southern California.
As most of those interested know, SC’s Jess Mortenson died
early this year, and Athletic Director Jess Hill took over. Hill was
a very successful track coach at SC before becoming football coach,
and later taking over his present post, but he wants to devote full
time to his duties in the executive position, and El Troj is looking for
a man to take over his track post.
PART OF THE REASON may be that SC finally lost a track
meet, after winning over a hundred straight dual meets.
SC is looking at Stanford’s Jordan. Jordan was an outstanding
sprinter in his college days at SC,

once running a 9.4 century, and
SC alums are trying their best to
lure him back there.
HARDLY A DAY goes by that
Jordan doesn’t receive letters and
phone calls pleading him to re
turn to Figueroa Tech. It is even
rumored that SC is luring promis
ing high school athletes to enroll
there on the promise that Jordan
will be track coach there next
year.
Jordan is recognized as one of
the best coaches in the world in
the weights (discus, shot put and
javelin) and is also tops in the
other field events.
JORDAN’S experience as a
sprinter makes him an able teach
er in that department, and he is
also strong at teaching the hur
dles and longer distances.
If Stanford lets Coach Jordan
slip through its fingers it will he
a real loss.

Stanford Hosts NorCal Meet
Bp that as it may, Jordan has lined up an outstanding field for
Saturday’s Northern California Invitational Track Meet at Stanford.
AN OUTSTANDING FIELD of 440- and 880-men and four 6-11
plus high jumpers head what promises to be one of Jordan’s best
track and field shows.
Jack Yerman, winner of this event in the 1960 Olympic Trials,
and with a 46.6 to his credit this year, is tops in the 440, but such as
Keith Thomassen. Stanford grad student with a best of 46.1, and Cal
Frosh Dave Archibald, 46.7 should give him a run for his money.
IN THE 880, Jerry Siebert is favored. The former Cal runner has
a 1:48.4 this year. Yerman may also enter this race. Stanford’s Rich
Klier ran a close second to Siebert in last year's Pacific AAU meet
at Stanford, and has run 1:30.5.

The high jump has 7-0 jumper
Gene Johnson going against 6-11
Herm Wyatt, Ed Costa and ex-
Card Phil Fehlen. The seven-foot
barrier easily could be reached
Saturday.
THE DISCUS may see the rival
ry continued between Dave Weill
and Jay Silvester, if Silvester can
make it here from the Coliseum
Relays in time to compete. He
holds the world record, and has
gone out to 210 feet unofficially.
Weill’s best is 189-11.
Johnson-Poynter Battle
Other featured races will be the
sprints, where Rob Poynter and
Dennis Johnson renew their duel.
Stanford frosh Larry Questad,
who ran a 9.5 wind-aided century
at Fresno last week, and SJS
frosh Dave Murad, 9.4 best, also
have a chance to wan.
THE JAVELIN features only
four men, all of whom have
thrown 241 feet or better. John
Fromm, Dick Bocks, Dan Studney
and Card Art Batchelder are the
spear hurlers.
In the distance races, Harry
McCalla will run either the mile
or two-mile, but not both, accord
ing to Jordan. If he enters the
mile, he’ll face Ben Tucker, 4:03.6.
In the two-mile, Charley Clark
former NCAA champion is enter
ed. Clark’s best this year is
8:52.4.
ALSO COMPETING is Fran
Washington, according to Jordan
the second best high-hurdler in
the U.S., at 13.9.
It looks like quite a meet.

ry continued between Dave Weill
and Jay Silvester, if Silvester can
make it here from the Coliseum
Relays in time to compete. He
holds the world record, and has
gone out to 210 feet unofficially.
Weill’s best is 189-11.
Johnson-Poynter Battle
Other featured races will be the
sprints, where Rob Poynter and
Dennis Johnson renew their duel.
Stanford frosh Larry Questad,
who ran a 9.5 wind-aided century
at Fresno last week, and SJS
frosh Dave Murad, 9.4 best, also
have a chance to wan.
THE JAVELIN features only
four men, all of whom have
thrown 241 feet or better. John
Fromm, Dick Bocks, Dan Studney
and Card Art Batchelder are the
spear hurlers.
In the distance races, Harry
McCalla will run either the mile
or two-mile, but not both, accord
ing to Jordan. If he enters the
mile, he’ll face Ben Tucker, 4:03.6.
In the two-mile, Charley Clark
former NCAA champion is enter
ed. Clark’s best this year is
8:52.4.
ALSO COMPETING is Fran
Washington, according to Jordan
the second best high-hurdler in
the U.S., at 13.9.
It looks like quite a meet.


PAYTON JORDAN
Will he be here next year?
Stanford is in grave danger of losing Track Coach Payton
Jordan to Southern California.
As most of those interested know, SC’s Jess Mortenson died
early this year, and Athletic Director Jess Hill took over. Hill was
a very successful track coach at SC before becoming football coach,
and later taking over his present post, but he wants to devote full
time to his duties in the executive position, and El Troj is looking for
a man to take over his track post.
PART OF THE REASON may be that SC finally lost a track
meet, after winning over a hundred straight dual meets.
SC is looking at Stanford’s Jordan. Jordan was an outstanding
sprinter in his college days at SC,

once running a 9.4 century, and
SC alums are trying their best to
lure him back there.
HARDLY A DAY goes by that
Jordan doesn’t receive letters and
phone calls pleading him to re
turn to Figueroa Tech. It is even
rumored that SC is luring promis
ing high school athletes to enroll
there on the promise that Jordan
will be track coach there next
year.
Jordan is recognized as one of
the best coaches in the world in
the weights (discus, shot put and
javelin) and is also tops in the
other field events.
JORDAN’S experience as a
sprinter makes him an able teach
er in that department, and he is
also strong at teaching the hur
dles and longer distances.
If Stanford lets Coach Jordan
slip through its fingers it will he
a real loss.

Stanford Hosts NorCal Meet
Bp that as it may, Jordan has lined up an outstanding field for
Saturday’s Northern California Invitational Track Meet at Stanford.
AN OUTSTANDING FIELD of 440- and 880-men and four 6-11
plus high jumpers head what promises to be one of Jordan’s best
track and field shows.
Jack Yerman, winner of this event in the 1960 Olympic Trials,
and with a 46.6 to his credit this year, is tops in the 440, but such as
Keith Thomassen. Stanford grad student with a best of 46.1, and Cal
Frosh Dave Archibald, 46.7 should give him a run for his money.
IN THE 880, Jerry Siebert is favored. The former Cal runner has
a 1:48.4 this year. Yerman may also enter this race. Stanford’s Rich
Klier ran a close second to Siebert in last year's Pacific AAU meet
at Stanford, and has run 1:30.5.

The high jump has 7-0 jumper
Gene Johnson going against 6-11
Herm Wyatt, Ed Costa and ex-
Card Phil Fehlen. The seven-foot
barrier easily could be reached
Saturday.
THE DISCUS may see the rival
ry continued between Dave Weill

er in that department, and he is
also strong at teaching the hur
dles and longer distances.
If Stanford lets Coach Jordan
slip through its fingers it will he
a real loss.

Stanford Hosts NorCal Meet
Bp that as it may, Jordan has lined up an outstanding field for
Saturday’s Northern California Invitational Track Meet at Stanford.
AN OUTSTANDING FIELD of 440- and 880-men and four 6-11
plus high jumpers head what promises to be one of Jordan’s best
track and field shows.
Jack Yerman, winner of this event in the 1960 Olympic Trials,
and with a 46.6 to his credit this year, is tops in the 440, but such as
Keith Thomassen. Stanford grad student with a best of 46.1, and Cal
Frosh Dave Archibald, 46.7 should give him a run for his money.
IN THE 880, Jerry Siebert is favored. The former Cal runner has
a 1:48.4 this year. Yerman may also enter this race. Stanford’s Rich
Klier ran a close second to Siebert in last year's Pacific AAU meet
at Stanford, and has run 1:30.5.

The high jump has 7-0 jumper
Gene Johnson going against 6-11
Herm Wyatt, Ed Costa and ex-
Card Phil Fehlen. The seven-foot
barrier easily could be reached
Saturday.
THE DISCUS may see the rival
ry continued between Dave Weill
and Jay Silvester, if Silvester can
make it here from the Coliseum
Relays in time to compete. He
holds the world record, and has
gone out to 210 feet unofficially.
Weill’s best is 189-11.
Johnson-Poynter Battle
Other featured races will be the
sprints, where Rob Poynter and
Dennis Johnson renew their duel.
Stanford frosh Larry Questad,
who ran a 9.5 wind-aided century
at Fresno last week, and SJS
frosh Dave Murad, 9.4 best, also
have a chance to wan.
THE JAVELIN features only
four men, all of whom have
thrown 241 feet or better. John
Fromm, Dick Bocks, Dan Studney
and Card Art Batchelder are the
spear hurlers.
In the distance races, Harry
McCalla will run either the mile
or two-mile, but not both, accord
ing to Jordan. If he enters the
mile, he’ll face Ben Tucker, 4:03.6.
In the two-mile, Charley Clark
former NCAA champion is enter
ed. Clark’s best this year is
8:52.4.
ALSO COMPETING is Fran
Washington, according to Jordan
the second best high-hurdler in
the U.S., at 13.9.
It looks like quite a meet.


PAYTON JORDAN
Will he be here next year?
Stanford is in grave danger of losing Track Coach Payton
Jordan to Southern California.
As most of those interested know, SC’s Jess Mortenson died
early this year, and Athletic Director Jess Hill took over. Hill was
a very successful track coach at SC before becoming football coach,
and later taking over his present post, but he wants to devote full
time to his duties in the executive position, and El Troj is looking for
a man to take over his track post.
PART OF THE REASON may be that SC finally lost a track
meet, after winning over a hundred straight dual meets.
SC is looking at Stanford’s Jordan. Jordan was an outstanding
sprinter in his college days at SC,

once running a 9.4 century, and
SC alums are trying their best to
lure him back there.
HARDLY A DAY goes by that
Jordan doesn’t receive letters and
phone calls pleading him to re
turn to Figueroa Tech. It is even
rumored that SC is luring promis
ing high school athletes to enroll
there on the promise that Jordan
will be track coach there next
year.
Jordan is recognized as one of
the best coaches in the world in
the weights (discus, shot put and
javelin) and is also tops in the
other field events.
JORDAN’S experience as a
sprinter makes him an able teach
er in that department, and he is
also strong at teaching the hur
dles and longer distances.
If Stanford lets Coach Jordan
slip through its fingers it will he
