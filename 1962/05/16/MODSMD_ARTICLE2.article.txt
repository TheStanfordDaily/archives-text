# Deans Offer Comments About NSA
## 
### 
Tin; EXISTENCE of the
USNSA reflects the fact that the
interest and responsibility of the
American college student justifi
ably carries beyond the bounds
of a campus.
If has become the one large,
democratic organization by which
American students are making
themselves relevant to the social
issues of our time.
Students in other countries
have long spoken of their social
concerns; the USNSA has become
the American student’s best op
portunity to participate responsi
bly in this exchange.
Dwight Clark
Dean of Freshman Men

I HAVE BEEN asked to com
ment on N.S.A.’s suitability for
Stanford campus. Philosophically
speaking, I feel that students
should investigate such organiza
tions as N.S.A. and other associ
ations of political and social im
port, within the framework of the
University charter and the
A.S.S.U. regulations.
When this investigation has
been done, thoroughly by what
ever means the community ap
proves, it seems to me, it should
receive the vote of the appropri
ate body. Its acceptance or rejec
tion by the Stanford campus
should rest on this decision.
On one campus where I have
been, N.S.A. was not significant
in its contribution: on another it
was most significant. Its signifi
cance here depends upon the in
terest, the concern and the stature
of the students involved.

Dean of Women

THE NSA IS the most repre
sentative, democratic national or
ganization of student govern
ments in the United States. Their
annual congress, modeled after
our government’s legislative
structure, provides student dele
gates with an opportunity to de
bate and discuss important issues
of the day on the national and in
ternational scene.
I am particularly impressed
with their international program
and believe that both Stanford
and NSA would profit by Stan
ford’s affiliation.

Dean of Men
