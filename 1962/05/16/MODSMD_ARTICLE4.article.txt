# Hook Sets Limit To Democratic Disobedience
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
The boundaries for the civil
disobedience that democracy can
allow were drawn by philosopher
Sidney Hook before a full Din
kelspiel Auditorium last night.
"We must remember that civil
disobedience at best is a danger
to democracy, even though it may
have some medicinal, curative ef
fects.” stated Hook in his Tues
day Evening Series analysis of
"Intelligence, Conscience, and the
Right to Revolution.”
“SIT-IN AND sit-down strikes,
since they have not resulted in
violence and have ended happily
in some Southern towns, are the
best illustration of . . . civil dis
obedience bringing about change
through democratic processes.
“We must carefully distinguish
between civil disobedience under
taken ... to destroy the proc
esses of democracy, (the Commu
nists can be pacifists too),” and
civil disobedience undertaken to
change the law democratically.
Hook, former student of Mor
his Cohen and John Dewey, out
lined the impossibility of obeying
the law only when it meets with
conscience. “This would be al
right if the people’s conscience
spoke with one voice . . . One
man’s conscience is another man’s
abomination . . . We would have
anarchy, and not philosophical
anarchy. Most philosophical an
archists I know always assume
there is a policeman on the cor
ner to protect them from the
other kinds of anarchists.”
THE DEMOCRATIC principle
can be allied with civil disobedi
ence only if the violator “is will
ing to accept punishment. He
abandons his position of the prin
cipled democrat when he tries to
avoid this, and must stand on the
moral law as he sees it . . . He
cannot whine and beg and fall
back on the fifth amendment.”
In considering the possible ef
fects of civil disobedience, Hook
stood against the "absolutist po
sition on democracy (that) makes
democracy a political axiom . . .
that you cannot elect a govern
ment that denies the right of the
people to oust it peaceably.
“The fears arc there, but is the
only way to meet them by making
democracy an absolute, in effect
the rule of an enlightened minori
ty .. . ‘forcing the people to be
free?’ ”
“Either man can be trusted to
govern himself, or faith in democ
racy is not justified.”

“Either man can be trusted to
govern himself, or faith in democ
racy is not justified.”
The boundaries for the civil
disobedience that democracy can
allow were drawn by philosopher
Sidney Hook before a full Din
kelspiel Auditorium last night.
"We must remember that civil
disobedience at best is a danger
to democracy, even though it may
have some medicinal, curative ef
fects.” stated Hook in his Tues
day Evening Series analysis of
"Intelligence, Conscience, and the
Right to Revolution.”
“SIT-IN AND sit-down strikes,
since they have not resulted in
violence and have ended happily
in some Southern towns, are the
best illustration of . . . civil dis
obedience bringing about change
through democratic processes.
“We must carefully distinguish
between civil disobedience under
taken ... to destroy the proc
esses of democracy, (the Commu
nists can be pacifists too),” and
civil disobedience undertaken to
change the law democratically.
Hook, former student of Mor
his Cohen and John Dewey, out
lined the impossibility of obeying
the law only when it meets with
conscience. “This would be al
right if the people’s conscience
spoke with one voice . . . One
man’s conscience is another man’s
abomination . . . We would have
anarchy, and not philosophical
anarchy. Most philosophical an
archists I know always assume
there is a policeman on the cor
ner to protect them from the
other kinds of anarchists.”
THE DEMOCRATIC principle
can be allied with civil disobedi
ence only if the violator “is will
ing to accept punishment. He
abandons his position of the prin
cipled democrat when he tries to
avoid this, and must stand on the
moral law as he sees it . . . He
cannot whine and beg and fall
back on the fifth amendment.”
In considering the possible ef
fects of civil disobedience, Hook
stood against the "absolutist po
sition on democracy (that) makes
democracy a political axiom . . .
that you cannot elect a govern
ment that denies the right of the
people to oust it peaceably.
“The fears arc there, but is the
only way to meet them by making
democracy an absolute, in effect
the rule of an enlightened minori
ty .. . ‘forcing the people to be
free?’ ”
