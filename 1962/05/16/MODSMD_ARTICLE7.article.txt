## 
### KATHLEEN DOWNING 
Robert F. Mann, Stanford stu
dent of Stuttgart who disappear
ed in East Berlin in January, is
expected to go on trial before a
Communist court at the end of
this month.
Mrs. C. W. Mann, the student's
mother in Sepulveda. California,
reported that the trial has been
delayed several times. “In March,
the State Department informed
us that the trial was scheduled
for April. Then the trial was put
off to May. Now we expect two
weeks notification before the trial
begins. This has not come,” said
Mrs. Mann.
I>R. WOLFGANG VOGEL will
represent Mann, she said. UPI
reported that an East Berlin law
yer had been named to defend the
young student. Last fall Dr. Vogel
worked with State Department
officials to release other Ameri
cans who had been arrested by
the Communists.
“We have hoped that Robert
would be freed without a trial,”
said Mrs. Mann. Mann has been
listed as missing since Jan. 26.
Reports reaching West Berlin
said that charges against Mann
were unknown, according to UPI.
Mr. and Mrs. Mann have hoped
that the delay in trial dates meant
no charges could be levied against
their son. “We have hoped and
prayed that there is no evidence
to be brought against him,” said
Mrs. Mann.
The Manns have written to Dr.
Vogel; they hope to be able to
exchange letters with their son.
The last letter from him, reported
Mrs. Mann, was written January
16. Mann had been living in West
Berlin with friends after spend
ing two quarters at the Stanford
campus is Stuttgart.
