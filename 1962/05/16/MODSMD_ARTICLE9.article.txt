Has the Communist govern

conditions in China? What part
can China be expected to play in
world affairs in the future? Such
questions will stimulate discus

hostel to be held this Saturday
and Sunday at Big Sur.
Dr. James Liu of the History
Department and Felix Green, for
eign correspondent for the British
Broadcasting Company, hold very
different views on the subject of
Red China.
LIU 18 opposed to the Commu
nist regime that governs his
homeland, while Green, who has
recently returned from a trip to
China, favors the Communist
government.
The hostel will be held at Hot
Springs Lodge in Big Sur State
Park. Previous hostel groups have
taken advantage of the area
around the lodge to hold discus
sions on the rocky beach or in the
nearby woods.
THE COST for the hostel is $8
which includes lodging and meals.
Sign-ups are being taken in the
ASSU office on a first-come-first
