# IIR Project Will Help Meet Enormous Need for Books in Africa

(Editor's Note: This Is the first of a
series of two articles describing the HR
“Books for East Africa Project”)

“The need for books in Africa is very
great,” said Jim Haas, chairman of the HR
Books for East Africa Project in a special
report. “The project will try to eliminate
some of that need.”

The project, which will be supported by a
$20,000 giant from the United States AID
Mission of East Africa, will send 100,000
books to the high schools and teaching col
leges in Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and
Zanzibar.

"Today’s Africa,” said Haas, “has less
than ten per cent of its people literate. Be
cause of African independence and the Afri
canization of the governments of these
countries, plus the demands of economic de
velopment, the educated, by necessity are
spread thinly over the jobs their countries
need to fill.

"IT HAS BEEN said that the independence
of African states was born in her grammar

and high schools. Yet unless education is
improved and a greater number of well edu
cated people are produced,” Haas said, “Af
rica’s future will remain under the fog of
illiteracy.”

Haas said that the African countries and
African people realize the critical need for
education and the opportunities it can bring.
“African governments last year at a UN
sponsored conference in Ethiopia.” he said,
“formulated a mammoth plan so that by
1980, there will be universal primary educa
tion, secondary education for thirty per cent
and higher education for twenty per cent of
the graduates of secondary schools.”
Haas noted that the government of Kenya
almost bankrupted itself with its spending
on education. The drive for education, he
said, is very great. The people of a village
will spend much of their life savings and
sell many of their possessions in order to
send their brightest child away to a good
school. “They do astonishing things,” he
said, “like walking 2000 miles to get an edu
cation.”
HAAS FEELS THAT this type of social

development is extremely important to the
United States. “If the United States desires
stable progressive governments in Africa; if
it desires that Africa’s people will have the
same opportunities as the people of more
developed countries; and if it desires that
these Africans continue to remain with the
Western tradition of freedom and liberty, it
must help to educate its youth well so that
they can guide their country to such a
future.”
The U.S. government has realized this
need, Haas felt, through its AID missions
and the Peace Corps, and has tried to supply
the capital and skill to build and staff
schools.
AMERICAN AID, however, has not so far
supplied any books to these schools. The na
tional African governments manage to sup
ply a minimum of the basic texts and allot a
few cents per person for other textbook
needs. After buying the most necessary
books, it leaves schools with either no other
books, or a library of one or two shelves
kept in the closet of the head master.
A number of book drives have tried to pro

vide the Africans with books from America.
Many of these, however, Haas said, were
cither improperly planned or improperly car
ried out. In many cases, the books sent were
not the type needed or wanted. “Also,” he
said, “some Americans sent large quantities
of refuse from people’s attics assuming that
any book is better than none.”
HE FELT THAT poor transportation
planning had also caused the failure of some
of the projects. “There is a high school in
Southern California which managed to col
lect and ship almost eighty thousand books.
The books were delivered by the U.S. Navy
to Mozambique for latter shipment to South
ern Rhodesia. The California students did
not make preparations to ship the books into
Rhodesia and the schools in Rhodesia could
not afford the expense, so all the books sat
an on open dock and have now rotted to use
lessness.”
The HR Books for East Africa Project,
Haas feels, had been much more carefully
planned. One term of the grant from AID
stipulates that the HR guarantee the quality
and usefulness of the books shipped. This

condition, Haas said, will certainly be met.
TRANSPORTATION for the books has
also been carefully planned, he said. Books
collected by the various California high
schools will be regularly collected by a truck
ing firm employed for the Project. The books
will be received in a warehouse in Mountain
View, where they will be carefully selected
and put into packages of 200-300 for the in
dividual African schools.
The books will be sent in about ten sepa
rate shipments from San Francisco to dif
ferent ports in East Africa. Arrangements
have been made to transport the books in
land to as close to the receiving school as
possible. Most of the shipments will go to
the regional educational offices where they
can be easily picked up by the different
schools.
“The books that arrive at the port of
Dares Salaam. Tanganyika, bound for Zanzi
bar,” Haas said, “wall be carried across the
channel between the two countries on the
Sultan’s private ship.”
