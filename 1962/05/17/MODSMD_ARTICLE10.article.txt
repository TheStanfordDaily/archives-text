WASHINGTON (UPl)—The United States has asked its allies
in Southeast Asia and the far Pacific to join in sending troops to
Thailand to help bolster that country against the Communist
threat in neighboring Laos, it was disclosed today.
The State Department said the United States “would certainly

welcome” any troops sent by I
other members of the Southeast |
Asia defense organization.
AMERICAN OFFICIALS said !
Britain, Australia, New Zealand,
Pakistan and The Philippines
were asked to dispatch at least
small forces to lino up with U.S.
land, air and sea forces being sent
to the Southeast Asian country.
The response from representa
tives here of most of the coun
tries was said to be favorable de
spite rumblings from Communist
China that it could “not remain
Indifferent” to U.S. military
moves in Asia.
The U.S. request came amid
these other developments in the
Asian crisis:
• THE UNITED States started
landing combat planes in Thai
land and a U.S. embassy spokes
man said in Bangkok that the
1,800 Marines ordered in Tuesday
by President Kennedy would land
soon.
• In Vientiane, Laos, the chief
of the international control com
mission on Laos, Avtar Singh of
India, said pro-Communist forces
had promised not to attack the
town of Ban ouei Sai along the
Laos-Thailand border unless Lao
tian troops hit first. Commission
delegates were trying to work out
a diplomatic solution to the Lao
tian problem.
IN WASHINGTON, hopes for a
diplomatic settlement of the Laos
war rose slightly in the wake of
Russia's pledge to support a
cease-fire. But officials warned
against any undue optimism. Re
ports from London said British
authorities had not received the
same optimistic impression as
U.S. officials about Russian inten
tions.
France apparently was the only
member of the Southeast Asian
defense pact not asked to send
troops. Gen. Charles de Gaulle
has at times looked with dis
favor on allied military action in
the area where French influence
has all but vanished. However re
ports from Europe said France,
as well as Britain, endorsed Pres
ident Kennedy’s order sending
troops into the area.
