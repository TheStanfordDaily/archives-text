# Communist Plot at San Carlos High?
## 
### 
A hotbed of Communism has been found in the Bay Area. It
has been organized by (ready?) a 15-year-old girl, Marilyn Ra
disch, who is a sophomore at San Carlos High School.
It seems that Marilyn is a member of her high school’s branch
of the Junior Statesmen, a state group which gives students prac
tice in politics. Anyhow, Marilyn introduced a resolution at one
of the group’s meetings which said that the Communist Party in
this country should have the rights granted to other political
parties on the grounds that democracy is a superior system and
that an informed citizenry will reject communism.
No sooner did news of this pernicious upholding of democracy
reach the world of Louis Francis, a California legislator, than the
excitement began.
Mrs. Jane Alexander, one of Francis’ aides who is helping him
in his bid to outlaw Communists (as defined by Francis) in
California, called Marilyn’s parents and said she was going to
turn their names in to the government unless the resolution was
withdrawn. So far it looks as if Marilyn’s parents (they hired a
lawyer to investigate the threat) and her high school principal,
Philip Maslin, are holding fast.
It will be interesting to see what Mrs. Alexander’s threats
come to. Maybe in taking on a 15-year-old girl they’ve got more
than they can handle.
