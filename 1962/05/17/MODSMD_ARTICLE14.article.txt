Editor, The Daily:
I think that Dr. Levin’s letter
published in The Daily and the
following letter written by Tom
Grey, the Sigma Nu President,
will mark the beginning of a bar
rage of letters to The Daily by
numerous offended as well as
misinformed students and faculty.
From every indication that I
have encountered, fraternities
here at Stanford are whole heart
edly against any form or type of
discriminatory clauses, written or
unwritten, excluding non-Chris
tians, Orientals or Negroes. This
indeed, is not the problem, and
where the brunt of criticism is
brought to bear.
Each chapter on this campus, if
it desires to remain in its respec
tive national, must abide by its
laws and regulations to remain a
member in good standing. This
is whore the conflict arises when
the question arises when the
question of clauses enters in to
discussion about fraternities and
their discrimination. A house is
torn between the alternatives of
attempting to remain in the na
tional while enforcing what it
feels to be morally right.
THE INITIATIVE to solve this
problem has been taken by state
legislatures, university faculties,
university boards of trustees, and
members of individual fraterni
ties on numerous campuses
throughout the country. Colleges
in the East and Middle West have
had this problem for many years
now.
What is currently taking place
at Stanford is a cooperative effort
by the various fraternities in
volved in this dilemma with the
Board of Trustees and the Inter
fraternity Board which acts as a
special advisory committee to the
President to help solve this prob
lem. A conscious effort is being
made, and will continue to be
made by the University in assist
ing the chapters on this campus
in the elimination of all discrimi
natory clauses, whether directly
stated in charters, constitutions
and by by-laws of national frater
nities or euphemistically implied.
THIS CAN’T happen over night,
nor will it completely take place
in this next year, but definite
progress is being made. The blur
ring of the issue by direct criti
cism of the houses on this cam
pus involved in this situation is
not the answer to the problem.
Local chapters can exert only so
much pressure on their respective
nationals and are unable to go
any further without the coopera
tion of this university and those
people who have the power and
the influence to exert themselves
on behalf of the chapters on this
campus confronting this problem.
Pressure rrlust be brought to bear
upon each respective national fra
ternity headquarters and national
convention through a cooperative
effort of the chapters on this
campus, University faculty and
University Trustees.

ENDORSEMENT
Editor, The Daily:
In fully endorsing the proposed
amendments to the ASSU By-
Laws concerning the Fundamen
tal Standard and the publishing
of judicial council cases, we
would like to point out the ad
vantages of several of the clauses
included.
First, the amendment includes
a division of the Fundamental
Standard into four general cate
gories of responsibilities of Stan
ford students. This categoriza
tion represents an explicit state
ment of some of the implications
of the more general statement;
yet the categories are still quite
general so as to avoid any exces
sive rigidity and to maintain ade
quate flexibility.
THE categorization should lead
to clarification in the application
of the Fundamental Standard in
the case of a specific violation,
for an offense could then be
shown to fall into a certain cate
gory rather than being simply a
transgression of “ . . . such re
spect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens,”
which it would be stated as ac
cording to the present statement
of the Fundamental Standard.
The amendment also includes
a statement of the rights of the
students, which incorporates a
statement of the rights of the de
fendant before judicial council
that now appears in the rules of
the judicial councils and of which
the defendant is informed before
he appears. Inclusion of these in
the statement of the Fundamental
Standard will hopefully make
knowledge of them more general.
NEXT, THERE is the clause
concerning third person responsi
bility, which involves the students
policing the system themselves—
an important, element if student
self-government and the Honor
Code are to mean anything in
practice.
Finally, there is the other
amendment, which provides for
the printing of the results of ju
dicial council cases in The Daily,
subject to the approval of the
councils, and in such a fashion
that individuals involved cannot
be identified. This should be bene
ficial in making the student body
more aware of what sort of of
fenses are being committed and,
in general, what penalties can be
expected.
Men’s Council
RIGHTS
Editor, The Daily:
The proposed amendment to
the ASSU By-Laws on the Funda
mental Standard contains a para
graph (C. Student Rights under
the Fundamental Standard)
which is particularly important to
a knowledge of the functioning of
the Judicial Councils.

The rights enumerated are not
new and have been consistently
observed by the Councils. How
ever. in the past, it has been only

the members of the Councils and
those persons appearing before
them who have been aware of
these rights. The explicit enunci
ation of these rights, as part of
the ASSU By-Laws, will contrib
ute greatly to student understand
ing of the student judicial sys
tem.
These rights are important
enough to be included in the By-
Laws, and knowledge of them
should not bo reserved to those
most directly concerned with the
workings of the Councils.

vantages of several of the clauses
included.
First, the amendment includes
a division of the Fundamental
Standard into four general cate
gories of responsibilities of Stan
ford students. This categoriza
tion represents an explicit state
ment of some of the implications
of the more general statement;
yet the categories are still quite
general so as to avoid any exces
sive rigidity and to maintain ade
quate flexibility.
THE categorization should lead
to clarification in the application
of the Fundamental Standard in
the case of a specific violation,
for an offense could then be
shown to fall into a certain cate
gory rather than being simply a
transgression of “ . . . such re
spect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens,”
which it would be stated as ac
cording to the present statement
of the Fundamental Standard.
The amendment also includes
a statement of the rights of the
students, which incorporates a
statement of the rights of the de
fendant before judicial council
that now appears in the rules of
the judicial councils and of which
the defendant is informed before
he appears. Inclusion of these in
the statement of the Fundamental
Standard will hopefully make
knowledge of them more general.
NEXT, THERE is the clause
concerning third person responsi
bility, which involves the students
policing the system themselves—
an important, element if student
self-government and the Honor
Code are to mean anything in
practice.
Finally, there is the other
amendment, which provides for
the printing of the results of ju
dicial council cases in The Daily,
subject to the approval of the
councils, and in such a fashion
that individuals involved cannot
be identified. This should be bene
ficial in making the student body
more aware of what sort of of
fenses are being committed and,
in general, what penalties can be
expected.

Editor, The Daily:
The proposed amendment to
the ASSU By-Laws on the Funda
mental Standard contains a para
graph (C. Student Rights under
the Fundamental Standard)
which is particularly important to
a knowledge of the functioning of
the Judicial Councils.

The rights enumerated are not
new and have been consistently
observed by the Councils. How
ever. in the past, it has been only

the members of the Councils and
those persons appearing before
them who have been aware of
these rights. The explicit enunci
ation of these rights, as part of
the ASSU By-Laws, will contrib
ute greatly to student understand
ing of the student judicial sys
tem.
These rights are important
enough to be included in the By-

should not bo reserved to those

workings of the Councils.

I think that Dr. Levin’s letter
published in The Daily and the
following letter written by Tom
Grey, the Sigma Nu President,
will mark the beginning of a bar
rage of letters to The Daily by
numerous offended as well as
misinformed students and faculty.
From every indication that I
have encountered, fraternities
here at Stanford are whole heart
edly against any form or type of
discriminatory clauses, written or
unwritten, excluding non-Chris
tians, Orientals or Negroes. This
indeed, is not the problem, and
where the brunt of criticism is
brought to bear.
Each chapter on this campus, if
it desires to remain in its respec
tive national, must abide by its
laws and regulations to remain a
member in good standing. This
is whore the conflict arises when
the question arises when the
question of clauses enters in to
discussion about fraternities and
their discrimination. A house is
torn between the alternatives of
attempting to remain in the na
tional while enforcing what it
feels to be morally right.
THE INITIATIVE to solve this
problem has been taken by state
legislatures, university faculties,
university boards of trustees, and
members of individual fraterni
ties on numerous campuses
throughout the country. Colleges
in the East and Middle West have
had this problem for many years
now.
What is currently taking place
at Stanford is a cooperative effort
by the various fraternities in
volved in this dilemma with the
Board of Trustees and the Inter
fraternity Board which acts as a
special advisory committee to the
President to help solve this prob
lem. A conscious effort is being
made, and will continue to be
made by the University in assist
ing the chapters on this campus
in the elimination of all discrimi
natory clauses, whether directly
stated in charters, constitutions
and by by-laws of national frater
nities or euphemistically implied.
THIS CAN’T happen over night,
nor will it completely take place
in this next year, but definite
progress is being made. The blur
ring of the issue by direct criti
cism of the houses on this cam
pus involved in this situation is
not the answer to the problem.
Local chapters can exert only so
much pressure on their respective

any further without the coopera

I think that Dr. Levin’s letter
published in The Daily and the
following letter written by Tom
Grey, the Sigma Nu President,
will mark the beginning of a bar
rage of letters to The Daily by
numerous offended as well as
misinformed students and faculty.
From every indication that I
have encountered, fraternities
here at Stanford are whole heart
edly against any form or type of
discriminatory clauses, written or
unwritten, excluding non-Chris
tians, Orientals or Negroes. This
indeed, is not the problem, and
where the brunt of criticism is
brought to bear.
Each chapter on this campus, if
it desires to remain in its respec
tive national, must abide by its
laws and regulations to remain a
member in good standing. This
is whore the conflict arises when
the question arises when the
question of clauses enters in to
discussion about fraternities and
their discrimination. A house is
torn between the alternatives of
attempting to remain in the na
tional while enforcing what it
feels to be morally right.
THE INITIATIVE to solve this
problem has been taken by state
legislatures, university faculties,
university boards of trustees, and
members of individual fraterni
ties on numerous campuses
throughout the country. Colleges
in the East and Middle West have
had this problem for many years
now.
What is currently taking place
at Stanford is a cooperative effort
by the various fraternities in
volved in this dilemma with the
Board of Trustees and the Inter
fraternity Board which acts as a
special advisory committee to the
President to help solve this prob
lem. A conscious effort is being
made, and will continue to be
made by the University in assist
ing the chapters on this campus
in the elimination of all discrimi
natory clauses, whether directly
stated in charters, constitutions
and by by-laws of national frater
nities or euphemistically implied.
THIS CAN’T happen over night,
nor will it completely take place
in this next year, but definite
progress is being made. The blur
ring of the issue by direct criti
cism of the houses on this cam
pus involved in this situation is
not the answer to the problem.
Local chapters can exert only so
much pressure on their respective
nationals and are unable to go
any further without the coopera
tion of this university and those
people who have the power and
the influence to exert themselves
on behalf of the chapters on this
campus confronting this problem.
Pressure rrlust be brought to bear

ENDORSEMENT
Editor, The Daily:
In fully endorsing the proposed
amendments to the ASSU By-
Laws concerning the Fundamen
tal Standard and the publishing
of judicial council cases, we
would like to point out the ad
vantages of several of the clauses
included.
First, the amendment includes
a division of the Fundamental
Standard into four general cate
gories of responsibilities of Stan
ford students. This categoriza
tion represents an explicit state
ment of some of the implications
of the more general statement;
yet the categories are still quite
general so as to avoid any exces
sive rigidity and to maintain ade
quate flexibility.
THE categorization should lead
to clarification in the application
of the Fundamental Standard in
the case of a specific violation,
for an offense could then be
shown to fall into a certain cate
gory rather than being simply a
transgression of “ . . . such re
spect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens,”
which it would be stated as ac
cording to the present statement
of the Fundamental Standard.
The amendment also includes
a statement of the rights of the
students, which incorporates a
statement of the rights of the de
fendant before judicial council
that now appears in the rules of
the judicial councils and of which
the defendant is informed before
he appears. Inclusion of these in
the statement of the Fundamental
Standard will hopefully make
knowledge of them more general.
NEXT, THERE is the clause
concerning third person responsi
bility, which involves the students
policing the system themselves—
an important, element if student
self-government and the Honor
Code are to mean anything in
practice.
Finally, there is the other
amendment, which provides for
the printing of the results of ju
dicial council cases in The Daily,
subject to the approval of the
councils, and in such a fashion
that individuals involved cannot
be identified. This should be bene
ficial in making the student body
more aware of what sort of of
fenses are being committed and,
in general, what penalties can be
expected.

Editor, The Daily:
The proposed amendment to
the ASSU By-Laws on the Funda
mental Standard contains a para
graph (C. Student Rights under
the Fundamental Standard)
which is particularly important to
a knowledge of the functioning of
the Judicial Councils.

The rights enumerated are not
new and have been consistently
observed by the Councils. How
ever. in the past, it has been only

the members of the Councils and
those persons appearing before
them who have been aware of
these rights. The explicit enunci
ation of these rights, as part of
the ASSU By-Laws, will contrib

These rights are important

First, the amendment includes
a division of the Fundamental
Standard into four general cate
gories of responsibilities of Stan
ford students. This categoriza
tion represents an explicit state
ment of some of the implications
of the more general statement;
yet the categories are still quite
general so as to avoid any exces
sive rigidity and to maintain ade
quate flexibility.
THE categorization should lead
to clarification in the application
of the Fundamental Standard in
the case of a specific violation,
for an offense could then be
shown to fall into a certain cate
gory rather than being simply a
transgression of “ . . . such re
spect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens,”
which it would be stated as ac
cording to the present statement
of the Fundamental Standard.
The amendment also includes
a statement of the rights of the
students, which incorporates a
statement of the rights of the de
fendant before judicial council
that now appears in the rules of
the judicial councils and of which
the defendant is informed before
he appears. Inclusion of these in
the statement of the Fundamental
Standard will hopefully make
knowledge of them more general.
NEXT, THERE is the clause
concerning third person responsi
bility, which involves the students
policing the system themselves—
an important, element if student
self-government and the Honor
Code are to mean anything in
practice.
Finally, there is the other
amendment, which provides for
the printing of the results of ju
dicial council cases in The Daily,
subject to the approval of the
councils, and in such a fashion
that individuals involved cannot
be identified. This should be bene
ficial in making the student body
more aware of what sort of of
fenses are being committed and,
in general, what penalties can be
expected.

RIGHTS
Editor, The Daily:
The proposed amendment to
the ASSU By-Laws on the Funda
mental Standard contains a para
graph (C. Student Rights under
the Fundamental Standard)
which is particularly important to
a knowledge of the functioning of
the Judicial Councils.

The rights enumerated are not
new and have been consistently
observed by the Councils. How
ever. in the past, it has been only

the members of the Councils and
those persons appearing before
them who have been aware of
these rights. The explicit enunci
ation of these rights, as part of
the ASSU By-Laws, will contrib
ute greatly to student understand
ing of the student judicial sys
tem.
These rights are important
enough to be included in the By-
Laws, and knowledge of them
should not bo reserved to those
most directly concerned with the
workings of the Councils.
