# THE 						MURAL RACE

### Pete King 
The three-year stranglehold which Sigma Chi and Delta Upsilon
have had on the intramural championship trophy stands an excellent
chance of being broken this year.
THETA CHI HAS piled up 241 points during the fall and winter
quarters to pull far ahead of the twm athletic powerhouses, and has
enough potential in spring sports to win it all.
League victories in touch football, basketball, and howling have
accounted for most of Theta Chi’s total. In addition, they have won
four straight volleyball matches this quarter. Should they go all the
way in that sport and garner a few points in other spring intramural
action, they’ll bo tough to beat.
However, no fewer than six other fraternities are within range
of first place. The DU’s, who have finished first once and second
twice in the past three years, are 59 points back with 182. Excep
tional depth accounts for their high total. They’ve scored points in
all hut one of 10 sports held this year.
In third place are the Phi Delts, with 172 points on football and
boxing wins. After them come four closely bunched contenders:
AKL (165), Theta Xi (161), Sigma Chi (152), and Phi Kappa
Sigma (155).
AMONG THE Wilbur houses, Junipero is ahead with 153, fol
lowed by Cedro’s 127. Breakers leads the eating clubs with 132 points,
and Neutrinos leads the off-campus and graduate competitors with
134.
Along with the DU’s, the biggest threats are Sigma Chi and the
Phi Kaps. The Chi’s are bidding for their third straight champion
ship, and although behind by a large margin, are perennially dan
gerous in spring sports. They have won all their softball and volley
ball games thus far, and two wins there would probably put them
in front.
THE PHI KAPS will have depth in the upcoming intramural
track meet, with at least one man qualified in four of the five events
for which trials have been held.
Six sports—softball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, horseshoes,
and track—remain to be finished, and any of these six fraternities
could overcome Theta Chi’s lead. Intramural director Elwyn Bugge
expects that the race for the trophy may be as close as it was last
year, when Sigma Chi edged out DU, 436-433.
THE GUESS HERE is that Theta Chi has the strength in spring
competition needed to retain its lead and capture its first intramural
championship since 1948, beyond which year the records of mural
champs are scarce.
Only recently have the fraternities been able to claim a monop
oly on the championship. In 1954 and 1955, the business school won
the trophy with such disheartening ease that it was split into two
units, Alpha Biz and Beta Biz. to give the other living groups a crack
at the university title. However, even this maneuver didn’t help much,
as Beta Biz won in 1956 and 1958, while Alpha Biz took it in 1957.
THE SYSTEM of awarding points to determine a university ath
letic champion has come under attack at some schools on the grounds
that the living groups place too much emphasis on winning campus
glory. Bugge feels that Stanford doesn’t have this problem, but
rather that participation in athletics is rewarding to most students
simply because it’s a chance for recreation and personal competition.

Six sports—softball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, horseshoes,
and track—remain to be finished, and any of these six fraternities
could overcome Theta Chi’s lead. Intramural director Elwyn Bugge
expects that the race for the trophy may be as close as it was last
year, when Sigma Chi edged out DU, 436-433.
THE GUESS HERE is that Theta Chi has the strength in spring
competition needed to retain its lead and capture its first intramural
championship since 1948, beyond which year the records of mural
champs are scarce.
Only recently have the fraternities been able to claim a monop
oly on the championship. In 1954 and 1955, the business school won
the trophy with such disheartening ease that it was split into two
units, Alpha Biz and Beta Biz. to give the other living groups a crack
at the university title. However, even this maneuver didn’t help much,
as Beta Biz won in 1956 and 1958, while Alpha Biz took it in 1957.
THE SYSTEM of awarding points to determine a university ath
letic champion has come under attack at some schools on the grounds
that the living groups place too much emphasis on winning campus
glory. Bugge feels that Stanford doesn’t have this problem, but
rather that participation in athletics is rewarding to most students
simply because it’s a chance for recreation and personal competition.
The three-year stranglehold which Sigma Chi and Delta Upsilon
have had on the intramural championship trophy stands an excellent
chance of being broken this year.
THETA CHI HAS piled up 241 points during the fall and winter
quarters to pull far ahead of the twm athletic powerhouses, and has
enough potential in spring sports to win it all.
League victories in touch football, basketball, and howling have
accounted for most of Theta Chi’s total. In addition, they have won
four straight volleyball matches this quarter. Should they go all the
way in that sport and garner a few points in other spring intramural
action, they’ll bo tough to beat.
However, no fewer than six other fraternities are within range
of first place. The DU’s, who have finished first once and second
twice in the past three years, are 59 points back with 182. Excep
tional depth accounts for their high total. They’ve scored points in
all hut one of 10 sports held this year.
In third place are the Phi Delts, with 172 points on football and
boxing wins. After them come four closely bunched contenders:
AKL (165), Theta Xi (161), Sigma Chi (152), and Phi Kappa
Sigma (155).
AMONG THE Wilbur houses, Junipero is ahead with 153, fol
lowed by Cedro’s 127. Breakers leads the eating clubs with 132 points,
and Neutrinos leads the off-campus and graduate competitors with
134.
Along with the DU’s, the biggest threats are Sigma Chi and the
Phi Kaps. The Chi’s are bidding for their third straight champion
ship, and although behind by a large margin, are perennially dan
gerous in spring sports. They have won all their softball and volley
ball games thus far, and two wins there would probably put them
in front.
THE PHI KAPS will have depth in the upcoming intramural
track meet, with at least one man qualified in four of the five events
for which trials have been held.
