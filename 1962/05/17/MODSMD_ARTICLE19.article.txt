# Giants Beat Cardinals
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (UPD—Or
lando Cepeda’s three-run homer
capped a five-run outburst in the
seventh inning yesterday to give
the San Francisco Giants a come
from-behind 7-2 victory over the
St. Louis Cardinals.
Juan Marichal, hurling for the
Giants, picked up the victory and
became the first man in the ma
jors to win seven games this year.
He has lost two.
Marichal hooked up in a fine
mound duel with the Cards Ernie
Broglio for the first six innings.

The Cards were leading 2-0 when
Felipe Alou hit a two-run homer
to tie the score in the bottom of
the sixth.
Broglio went out for a pinch
hitter in the top of the seventh
and Lindy McDaniel was the vic
tim of the Giant bombardment.
With one away Ed Bailey dou
bled, Marichal singled and Har
vey Kuenn’s single brought in the
go-ahead run. Chuck Hiller fol
lowed with a single to drive in an
other score and after Willie Mays
struck out, Cepeda got his tenth
homer of the year.
