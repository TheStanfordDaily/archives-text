# Model Senate Hits Aid to 'Dictators'
## 
### 
The Model U.S. Senate passed a
bill Monday, resolving that the
U.S. extend no financial assist
ance to the governments of Haiti,
Paraguay, Nicaragua, or Guate
mala unless that aid be specifical
ly designed for the benefit of the
people.
The vote was 9 in favor, 5
against, and 2 abstentions.
The reasons for this decision,
cited by proponents of the bill,
were that support of certain Lat
in American dictatorships by the
U.S. has been a source of con
tinual embarrassment to this
country, and that the people of
those countries are being denied
certain civil rights.
The provisions of the bill would
be applied until the above govern
ments were reformed.
Several members of the opposi
tion demanded more stringent
provisions: a trade embargo,
withdrawal of all American mili
tary missions in those four coun
tries, and the granting of politi
cal asylum to refugees attempt
ing to bring about democratic
governments in their countries.
Others felt that the entire bill
was “a form of blackmail imply
ing a moral superiority” as well
as being intervention on our part.
