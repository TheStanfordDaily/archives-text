### 
Several outstanding track and]
field marks were recorded by
AAWU athletes last weekend, de
spite the fact that all of the mem- ]
her schools save Washington were
competing in the West Coast Re-j
lays at Fresno rather than as in
dividuals in duals meets.
The biggest mark of all came:
from USC’s massive Dallas Long, j
Long set a new NCAA shot put
record with a toss of 64-9 1 2 at j
Fresno, indicating lie is approach-1
ing top form with the AAWU and [
NCAA championships drawing j
near.
STEVE CORTWRIGHT of Stan
ford, overlooked among the sta- j
tistical leaders a week ago, is the j
new leader in the hop-step-jump i
with a best of 46-3.
Trojan Rex Cawley, although j
finishing only third, cut his time I
in the quarter-mile to 46.8. His }
top time ever is 46.2 which he
made last year. It was the coun
try's best.
Washington’s Jerry Plowman :
sped to a 21,3 clocking in the 220
against Oregon Saturday to take j
second place in that ranking.
UCLA’s Winston Doby upped
his season’s best in the hroad j
jump to 24-4, but could not ad
vance in the standings over Stan- j
ford’s fine pair of Dan Moore and !
Chuck Barth.
Barth is the leader with a leap
I of 24-4% while teammate Moore
1 has gone 24-414.
