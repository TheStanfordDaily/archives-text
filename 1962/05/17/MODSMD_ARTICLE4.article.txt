THIRTY-FIVE MEMBERS of Phi Delta Theta spent Sunday in a “work day” at the Ming Quong Home
for foster children in Los Gatos. The actives were participating in a Community Service Project being undertaken by all chapters of the national fraternity this year. In a parallel effort, the Phi Delt
pledges annually carry on a separate service project of their own. In past years, the pledges have
repainted the Stanford Boathouse and worked with the Palo Alto City Nurseries.
