# Why Stanford Left NSA
## 
### R. STEVE CORKER 
Stanford’s status with the NSA
has long been in flux. I wish to
address myself to the reasons
Stanford disaffiliated in 1956, did
not reaffiliate in 1960, and discuss
whether the reasons were valid.
George Ralph, the ’55’56 stu
dent body president had driven
into office dramatically on a
motorcycle, hut once in office did
little but add to the already pen
sive campus apathy.
LITTLE initiative resided in
the Legislature to keep campus
participation in NSA activities at
a decent level, and it was no
shock when a petition came in
from some students (hat called
for disaffiliation. The referen
dum, worded negatively, resulted
by a close vote in Stanford’s dis
affiliation.
The reasons given by the anti-
NSA forces were that (1) the
NSA’s deliberations were far re
moved from the concern of Stan
ford students, (2) that the money
put into it did not justify the “re
sults” we received from it, that
it basically had nothing to offer
us, and (3 • we should put our
emphasis on the young PSPA, as
it was made up of “more similar
West Coast schools.”
Perhaps there was at least
more validity in the negative at

j guments in 1956—but when the
I issue was bi’ought up in 1960,
1 these same arguments seemed
hardly more than superficial.
THi; STUDENT body was told
it' could not afford the $lOOO
needed yearly to finance member
ship, although it could afford
$5OOO for Big Game decorations;
we were told that there was no
need to show our concern for na
tional and international affairs in
the one effective outlet of opin
ion students have in America.
We were told we had no need
to express our ties with all the
other non-communist student or
ganizations around the world -
that we, Stanford, could ignore
their fight and problems; we were
told (hat the NSA might vote on
a resolution in away that would
not agree with student body ma
jority sentiment, even though no
claim was ever made that such a
vote indeed did represent said
majority vote; and the by then
vacuus PSPA was again brought
up.
WE WERE TOLD students did
not have time to participate ac
tively in NSA. even though such
reasoning was out of place until
a majority of students at Stan
ford had derived that member
ship would be a worthwhile way
of spending time, and we were
told that Stanford could do every

thing the NSA could do for us
without their help, even though
the NSA' was the one channel
through which we could instruct
all other colleges in America in
our particular “genius.”
Bui the main thing we were
told, and we were told this in
whispers by the “Plot Theorists
of Government”—that NSA was
all a plot by the Communists;
that obviously it was a Commu
nist front, because it believed in
civil liberties, integration, fair
ness. academic freedom and the
United Nations.
IN THE STUDENT body presi
dential campaign of 1959-60. both
candidates supported re-affilia
tion originally, but one changed
horses mid-stream when it was
clearly to his advantage to do so.
To worsen the picture, the ef
fort to inform people about (he
NSA was hardly an organized ef
fort—all information was coming
only through The Daily, as far as
the contributions NSA could
make were concerned.
The move to reaffilialc was
thus defeated, again depriving
Stanford of the opportunity to
belong to an organization that
has “splendidly articulated our
national ideals and reflected the
vigor of our college and univer
sity young people,” according to
President Kennedy.
