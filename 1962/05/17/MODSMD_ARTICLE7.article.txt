# NSA, Forum on LASSU Agenda
## 
### 
LASSU tonight will receive the
NSA petition and discuss the
Peace Forum, the Fundamental
Standard amendment, and several
organizations’ by-laws changes.
The NSA petition, with 1001
names, asks for a student refer
endum this quarter on Stanford’s
joining the NSA. ASSU President
Bob Sayler will present the peti
tion to LASSU, according to Fred
Goff, a sponsor of the petition.
Jock Mcßaine, Sayler’s legisla
tive assistant, said that the NSA
referendum would probably be
on the same ballot as the Funda
mental Standard amendment.
LASSU could approve NSA, but
due to the value of a student vote
LASSU will probably only recom
mend student approval, he said.
The proposed amendment to
the Fundamental Standard elab
orates on student rights and re
sponsibilities and includes the
“third person clause.”
LASSU will discuss changes in
the by-laws or constituitons of
Cardinals, the concert series, the
Stanford Islamic Society and
Guthrie house, approve the HE
elections, and discuss the Peace
Forum.
