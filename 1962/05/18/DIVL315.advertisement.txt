INDIANS
Somewhere in the con
fines of North Beach,
S.F., is a character
who sews up a storm
in neckwear of char
acter and distinction.
These, as you've prob
ably surmised, are

miles around for slim
lines, unusual fabrics,
neat tailoring. Noth
ing like â€™em to add
that fun touch to your
new R A suit. Take
home a handful.
2.50 and 3.50.
