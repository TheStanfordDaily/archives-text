### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
A free quarter for major honors students highlights a hold new
program to he initiated this September hy the Stanford English
Department.
According to the recently drawn up outline of the program,
“the honors quarter, presumably the fall quarter of the senior year,

will ho free of all course obliga--
tions. t is intended to provide a
coherent program of broad back
ground reading that the student
might not otherwise be able to
do.”

“THS WILL provide some time
for reading, pause and reflection,”
noted Walter Carnochan, chair
man of the committee which con
structed the plan.
The very originality of the plan
presents problems within the aca
demic structure: “The only prob
lem is that wo do have to give a
grade,” said Carnochan. “I am
not completely happy about this
. . . but it is not terrible. 1 would
bo happier without it.”
The statement of program indi
cates the reading to be credited
with 13 units, will he directed
toward a 4-unit senior essay, and
will be supervised by the director
of the student’s essay. Carnochan
elaborated that the reading would
be "relevant, but may not in the
long run be directly incorpor
ated."
THE PROGRAM “verges into
the humanities” byway of week
ly discusion meetings among the
honors students, during their free
quarter, of "major works outside
PTnglish and American literature.”
Other aspects of the program
provide for tutorial sections con
nected with the department’s re
quired survey courses, to be con
ducted by professors in the de
partment. Also, students are pro
vided with a list “of 10 to 15 ma
jor works of English and Ameri
can literature” and are expected
to read any with which they arc
not familiar during their free
lime.
Work in one other language
and literature, beyond the mini
mum university requirements, as
well as philosophy or history, is
also encompassed within the pro
gram.
STUDENTS BEGIN the pro
gram at the start of the sopho
more or junior year.
The program was planned by
English department faculty mem
bers Walter Carnochan, Howard
Franklin. Albert J. Guerard, Ron
old Rabholz, and Wllford Stone.

ment as a whole have been en
acted in the required 3 quarter
survey series. Instructors will
give 2 to 3 lectures a week, as op
posed to the current program of

ture.
