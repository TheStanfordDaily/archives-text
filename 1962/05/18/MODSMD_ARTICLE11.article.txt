# How Can Frats End The Bias Clauses?
## 
### 
Tho questions raised by David Levin in In’s recent letter to |
Sigma Nu were not all either understood or answered by Tom
Grey, Sigma Nu President, in his answering letter.
Levin does not want to let Sigma Nu (or any fraternity) be
lieve that it can be secure in and subscribe to the principles of
both the academic community and a discriminatory national fra
ternity.
His stand is intended to make the right choice for Sigma Nu
easy; that is, he does not want to allow the fraternity to lapse into
inaction on tin's problem. He understands the difficulties, but the
kind of support that he offers is much more active than a position
of neutrality or acceptance of the status quo.
In the event that the chapter succeeds in its attempt to have
the bias clause removed, the problem for Sigma Nu on this cam
pus will be solved. K it does not succeed, we feel that the only
correct choice it can make is to withdraw from the national. This
is also exerting strong pressure on the national organization; it is
taking the only stand compatible with good conscience.
The University definitely opposes discrimination and is sup
porting the efforts of individual chapters to do away with bias
clauses, but it has issued no ultimatum or time limit for the
elimination of such restrictions like the state legislature has issued
for state' universities. What this means in that Sigma Nu is under
no direct pressure from the University or anyone else in an official
position, and it is precisely this fact that makes a stand like
Levin’s important.
University support will be forthcoming for any chapter that
decides to break with the national, as was demonstrated in the
ATO case, but it is up to the chapter itself to take the initiative.
Unless the chapter is strong and principled enough to take the j
proper stand, no change will be made. Perhaps the University
should make it necessary for the chapter to be strong and follow !
the state in upholding w hat Levin calls “fraternity.”
