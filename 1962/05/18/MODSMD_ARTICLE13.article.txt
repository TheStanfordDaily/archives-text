## Chile's Move to the Left Is Easy to Understand 
### RICHARD G. OFFUTT 
Since September 8, 1954, Jorge
Alessandri has been Chile’s pres
ident. He is more of a business
man-technician than a politician,
shunning the parades and publi
city so cherished by the latter, j
Furthermore, as a businessman, ■
he is a staunch friend of the U.S., j
since over 50 per cent of Chilean
exports and imports are realized
with the U.S. The president would
he more than glad to break rela
tions with Cuba, but has thus far
reneged due to dissident internal
factors.
Alessandri’s very election point
ed to legislative difficulties. He
was elected with only a small
30,000 vote majority over Salva
dor Allendos, the candidate of the
leftist United Front (FRAP). His
shaky position became clear in
the congressional elections of
1961. The Liberal-Conservative
government coalition lost one
fifth of its seats, remaining with
only 44 out of a total of 147. On
the other hand the United Front,
Communists, Socialists and Na
tional Democrats, gained 13 seats,
to boost their total to 40.
The governmental coalition con
sequently bases its existence on
the support of the “middle of the
road” Radicals, the strongest
single party in Chile, with 40
seats, which is, however, already
coquetting with the United Front
for the 1964 elections. The only
remaining party, the Christian-
Democrats, are famed for oppor
tunistic politics and will be ready
to go into any coalition for the
right price.
The reasons for Chile’s move
to the left are not hard to find.
Most of Alessandri’s reforms
have been pseudo-reforms, leav
ing those affected little better
off than before, or they never de
velop beyond the planning stage.
An example of the former has
been his much publicized housing
reform. Some of the worst “cal
lampas” of slums in Santiago
were torn down and the residents
promised new houses.
These residents, however, were
merely given some plots of land
in the center of the city and
shunted into a “do-it-yourself”
program. The resulting “nuevas
callampas” are little better than
the old, the main improvement
being the naming of the unpaved
streets to facilitate postal deliv
ery. Electric lights function in
termittently, but adequate sewage
and trash disposal and running
water are still lacking.

Upon visiting one of these
model .settlements, San Eujenio,
a man invited me into his wooden
cardboard house. The living room
walls were papered with pages
torn out of former development
plans. His only comment was,
“We have been patient a long
time.” Talking with a self-pro
fessed “non-communist socialist”
I heard a more bitter version
“Nothing has been reached with
legal means.
“We view your Alliance for
Progress as a brave plan, but
Chile has received a great deal
of money in the past without
modification of the social prob
lems. We find it hard to generate
a belief in this new venture.” He
also referred to the “basically
honest” but “practically useless”
Chilean bureaucracy. Chile re
ceived Foreign Aid from many
nations after the earth quake in
the summer of 1960. Although
many plans have been drawn up
for using the money, reconstruc
tion is just now slowly starting
in most areas, almost two years
after the catastrophe.
The educational reforms have
had results similar to the hous
ing reform. Education is free, but
about 50 per cent of the lower
class children are forced to leave
school after the fourth grade to
help with family support. This
accounts for Chile’s relatively low
illiteracy rate, 15 to 20 per cent,
but these children are neither edu
vated nor illiterate. Education re
mains a luxury, despite social re
forms. These working class chil
dren can never take advantage of
the free university education,
whereas three-fourths of the upper
class children, who could easily
pay the tuition, benefit from the
governmental generosity.
Alessandri’s pro-Americanism
is not generally shared by his
countrymen for various reasons.
Chile lives from copper and ni
trates, but two-thirds of the con
cerns are in North American
hands, nine-tenths of the copper
mines. The result, said one stu
dent, is that “three-fourths of the
profits go to North America, and
the rest to a few rich ‘Chilenos,’
who invest the money in foreign
banks.” Most realize that Chile
would never have been able to
develop these enterprises on her
own, but can not understand why
the Chilean engineer never earns
as much as his American co
worker.

Stated another Chilean student,
‘The gringos pay the workers

better than the Chilean employers
and the working conditions are
excellent, but the relationship is
one of ‘untouchables.’ The inter
est of the Americans for these
workers and for the country it
self ends with the paycheck. Ev
ery American technician I have
over talked to could only speak of
returning to the good old U.S.A.
and did not know a damn thing
about our country except for the
names of a few nightclubs.” He
went on to cite the lack of lan
guage interest, which seems to be
an American disease, ending with
the example of Claude Bowers, a
former American ambassador
here for many years, “who never
spoke a word of Spanish.” “At
least we never heard him,” added
the student.
These students see the Alliance
for Progress confronted with
three huge obstacles in Chile:
Castroism combined with a small
but extremely well-organized
communist party, a bureaucracy
infiltrated by the stubborn oli
garchy. and the representatives
of American government and en
terprise.

the old, the main improvement
being the naming of the unpaved
streets to facilitate postal deliv
ery. Electric lights function in
termittently, but adequate sewage
and trash disposal and running
water are still lacking.

Upon visiting one of these
model .settlements, San Eujenio,
a man invited me into his wooden
cardboard house. The living room
walls were papered with pages
torn out of former development
plans. His only comment was,
“We have been patient a long
time.” Talking with a self-pro
fessed “non-communist socialist”
I heard a more bitter version
“Nothing has been reached with
legal means.
“We view your Alliance for
Progress as a brave plan, but
Chile has received a great deal
of money in the past without
modification of the social prob
lems. We find it hard to generate
a belief in this new venture.” He
also referred to the “basically
honest” but “practically useless”
Chilean bureaucracy. Chile re
ceived Foreign Aid from many
nations after the earth quake in
the summer of 1960. Although
many plans have been drawn up
for using the money, reconstruc
tion is just now slowly starting
in most areas, almost two years
after the catastrophe.
The educational reforms have
had results similar to the hous
ing reform. Education is free, but
about 50 per cent of the lower
class children are forced to leave
school after the fourth grade to
help with family support. This
accounts for Chile’s relatively low
illiteracy rate, 15 to 20 per cent,
but these children are neither edu
vated nor illiterate. Education re
mains a luxury, despite social re
forms. These working class chil
dren can never take advantage of
the free university education,
whereas three-fourths of the upper
class children, who could easily
pay the tuition, benefit from the
governmental generosity.
Alessandri’s pro-Americanism
is not generally shared by his
countrymen for various reasons.
Chile lives from copper and ni
trates, but two-thirds of the con
cerns are in North American
hands, nine-tenths of the copper
mines. The result, said one stu
dent, is that “three-fourths of the
profits go to North America, and
the rest to a few rich ‘Chilenos,’
who invest the money in foreign
banks.” Most realize that Chile
would never have been able to
develop these enterprises on her
own, but can not understand why
the Chilean engineer never earns
as much as his American co
worker.

Stated another Chilean student,
‘The gringos pay the workers

better than the Chilean employers
and the working conditions are
excellent, but the relationship is
one of ‘untouchables.’ The inter
est of the Americans for these
workers and for the country it
self ends with the paycheck. Ev
ery American technician I have
over talked to could only speak of
returning to the good old U.S.A.
and did not know a damn thing
about our country except for the
names of a few nightclubs.” He
went on to cite the lack of lan
guage interest, which seems to be
an American disease, ending with
the example of Claude Bowers, a
former American ambassador
here for many years, “who never
spoke a word of Spanish.” “At
least we never heard him,” added
the student.
These students see the Alliance
for Progress confronted with
three huge obstacles in Chile:
Castroism combined with a small
but extremely well-organized
communist party, a bureaucracy
infiltrated by the stubborn oli
garchy. and the representatives
of American government and en
terprise.
Since September 8, 1954, Jorge
Alessandri has been Chile’s pres
ident. He is more of a business
man-technician than a politician,
shunning the parades and publi
city so cherished by the latter, j
Furthermore, as a businessman, ■
he is a staunch friend of the U.S., j
since over 50 per cent of Chilean
exports and imports are realized
with the U.S. The president would
he more than glad to break rela
tions with Cuba, but has thus far
reneged due to dissident internal
factors.
Alessandri’s very election point
ed to legislative difficulties. He
was elected with only a small
30,000 vote majority over Salva
dor Allendos, the candidate of the
leftist United Front (FRAP). His
shaky position became clear in
the congressional elections of
1961. The Liberal-Conservative
government coalition lost one
fifth of its seats, remaining with
only 44 out of a total of 147. On
the other hand the United Front,
Communists, Socialists and Na
tional Democrats, gained 13 seats,
to boost their total to 40.
The governmental coalition con
sequently bases its existence on
the support of the “middle of the
road” Radicals, the strongest
single party in Chile, with 40
seats, which is, however, already
coquetting with the United Front
for the 1964 elections. The only
remaining party, the Christian-
Democrats, are famed for oppor
tunistic politics and will be ready
to go into any coalition for the
right price.
The reasons for Chile’s move
to the left are not hard to find.
Most of Alessandri’s reforms
have been pseudo-reforms, leav
ing those affected little better
off than before, or they never de
velop beyond the planning stage.
An example of the former has
been his much publicized housing
reform. Some of the worst “cal
lampas” of slums in Santiago
were torn down and the residents
promised new houses.
These residents, however, were
merely given some plots of land
in the center of the city and
shunted into a “do-it-yourself”
program. The resulting “nuevas
callampas” are little better than
the old, the main improvement
being the naming of the unpaved

would never have been able to
develop these enterprises on her

ery American technician I have

returning to the good old U.S.A.
and did not know a damn thing
about our country except for the
names of a few nightclubs.” He
went on to cite the lack of lan
guage interest, which seems to be
an American disease, ending with
the example of Claude Bowers, a
former American ambassador
here for many years, “who never
spoke a word of Spanish.” “At
least we never heard him,” added
the student.
These students see the Alliance
for Progress confronted with
three huge obstacles in Chile:
Castroism combined with a small

communist party, a bureaucracy

Since September 8, 1954, Jorge
Alessandri has been Chile’s pres
ident. He is more of a business
man-technician than a politician,
shunning the parades and publi
city so cherished by the latter, j
Furthermore, as a businessman, ■
he is a staunch friend of the U.S., j
since over 50 per cent of Chilean
exports and imports are realized
with the U.S. The president would
he more than glad to break rela
tions with Cuba, but has thus far
reneged due to dissident internal
factors.
Alessandri’s very election point
ed to legislative difficulties. He
was elected with only a small
30,000 vote majority over Salva
dor Allendos, the candidate of the
leftist United Front (FRAP). His
shaky position became clear in
the congressional elections of
1961. The Liberal-Conservative
government coalition lost one
fifth of its seats, remaining with
only 44 out of a total of 147. On
the other hand the United Front,
Communists, Socialists and Na
tional Democrats, gained 13 seats,
to boost their total to 40.
The governmental coalition con
sequently bases its existence on
the support of the “middle of the
road” Radicals, the strongest
single party in Chile, with 40
seats, which is, however, already
coquetting with the United Front
for the 1964 elections. The only
remaining party, the Christian-
Democrats, are famed for oppor
tunistic politics and will be ready
to go into any coalition for the
right price.
The reasons for Chile’s move
to the left are not hard to find.
Most of Alessandri’s reforms
have been pseudo-reforms, leav
ing those affected little better
off than before, or they never de
velop beyond the planning stage.
An example of the former has
been his much publicized housing
reform. Some of the worst “cal
lampas” of slums in Santiago
were torn down and the residents
promised new houses.
These residents, however, were
merely given some plots of land
in the center of the city and
shunted into a “do-it-yourself”
program. The resulting “nuevas
callampas” are little better than
the old, the main improvement
being the naming of the unpaved
streets to facilitate postal deliv
ery. Electric lights function in
termittently, but adequate sewage
and trash disposal and running
water are still lacking.

Upon visiting one of these
model .settlements, San Eujenio,
a man invited me into his wooden
cardboard house. The living room
walls were papered with pages
torn out of former development
plans. His only comment was,
“We have been patient a long
time.” Talking with a self-pro
fessed “non-communist socialist”
I heard a more bitter version
“Nothing has been reached with
legal means.
“We view your Alliance for
Progress as a brave plan, but
Chile has received a great deal
of money in the past without
modification of the social prob
lems. We find it hard to generate
a belief in this new venture.” He
also referred to the “basically
honest” but “practically useless”
Chilean bureaucracy. Chile re
ceived Foreign Aid from many
nations after the earth quake in
the summer of 1960. Although
many plans have been drawn up
for using the money, reconstruc
tion is just now slowly starting
in most areas, almost two years
after the catastrophe.
The educational reforms have
had results similar to the hous
ing reform. Education is free, but
about 50 per cent of the lower
class children are forced to leave
school after the fourth grade to
help with family support. This
accounts for Chile’s relatively low
illiteracy rate, 15 to 20 per cent,
but these children are neither edu
vated nor illiterate. Education re
mains a luxury, despite social re
forms. These working class chil
dren can never take advantage of
the free university education,
whereas three-fourths of the upper
class children, who could easily
pay the tuition, benefit from the
governmental generosity.
Alessandri’s pro-Americanism
is not generally shared by his
countrymen for various reasons.
Chile lives from copper and ni
trates, but two-thirds of the con
cerns are in North American
hands, nine-tenths of the copper
mines. The result, said one stu
dent, is that “three-fourths of the
profits go to North America, and
the rest to a few rich ‘Chilenos,’
who invest the money in foreign
banks.” Most realize that Chile
would never have been able to
develop these enterprises on her
own, but can not understand why

Communists, Socialists and Na
tional Democrats, gained 13 seats,
to boost their total to 40.
The governmental coalition con
sequently bases its existence on
the support of the “middle of the
road” Radicals, the strongest
single party in Chile, with 40
seats, which is, however, already
coquetting with the United Front
for the 1964 elections. The only
remaining party, the Christian-
Democrats, are famed for oppor
tunistic politics and will be ready
to go into any coalition for the
right price.
The reasons for Chile’s move
to the left are not hard to find.
Most of Alessandri’s reforms
have been pseudo-reforms, leav
ing those affected little better
off than before, or they never de
velop beyond the planning stage.
An example of the former has
been his much publicized housing
reform. Some of the worst “cal
lampas” of slums in Santiago
were torn down and the residents
promised new houses.
These residents, however, were
merely given some plots of land
in the center of the city and
shunted into a “do-it-yourself”
program. The resulting “nuevas
callampas” are little better than
the old, the main improvement
being the naming of the unpaved
streets to facilitate postal deliv
ery. Electric lights function in
termittently, but adequate sewage
and trash disposal and running
water are still lacking.

Upon visiting one of these
model .settlements, San Eujenio,
a man invited me into his wooden
cardboard house. The living room
walls were papered with pages
torn out of former development
plans. His only comment was,
“We have been patient a long
time.” Talking with a self-pro
fessed “non-communist socialist”
I heard a more bitter version
“Nothing has been reached with
legal means.
“We view your Alliance for
Progress as a brave plan, but
Chile has received a great deal
of money in the past without
modification of the social prob
lems. We find it hard to generate
a belief in this new venture.” He
also referred to the “basically
honest” but “practically useless”
Chilean bureaucracy. Chile re
ceived Foreign Aid from many
nations after the earth quake in
the summer of 1960. Although
many plans have been drawn up
for using the money, reconstruc
tion is just now slowly starting
in most areas, almost two years
after the catastrophe.
The educational reforms have
had results similar to the hous
ing reform. Education is free, but
about 50 per cent of the lower
class children are forced to leave
school after the fourth grade to
help with family support. This
accounts for Chile’s relatively low
illiteracy rate, 15 to 20 per cent,
but these children are neither edu
vated nor illiterate. Education re
mains a luxury, despite social re
forms. These working class chil
dren can never take advantage of
the free university education,
whereas three-fourths of the upper
class children, who could easily
pay the tuition, benefit from the
governmental generosity.
Alessandri’s pro-Americanism
is not generally shared by his
countrymen for various reasons.
Chile lives from copper and ni
trates, but two-thirds of the con
cerns are in North American
hands, nine-tenths of the copper
mines. The result, said one stu
dent, is that “three-fourths of the
profits go to North America, and
the rest to a few rich ‘Chilenos,’
who invest the money in foreign
banks.” Most realize that Chile
would never have been able to
develop these enterprises on her
own, but can not understand why
the Chilean engineer never earns
as much as his American co
worker.

Stated another Chilean student,
‘The gringos pay the workers

better than the Chilean employers
and the working conditions are
excellent, but the relationship is
one of ‘untouchables.’ The inter
est of the Americans for these
workers and for the country it
self ends with the paycheck. Ev
ery American technician I have
over talked to could only speak of
returning to the good old U.S.A.
and did not know a damn thing
about our country except for the
names of a few nightclubs.” He
went on to cite the lack of lan
guage interest, which seems to be
an American disease, ending with
the example of Claude Bowers, a
former American ambassador
here for many years, “who never
spoke a word of Spanish.” “At
least we never heard him,” added
the student.
These students see the Alliance
for Progress confronted with
three huge obstacles in Chile:
Castroism combined with a small
but extremely well-organized
communist party, a bureaucracy
infiltrated by the stubborn oli
garchy. and the representatives
of American government and en
terprise.
