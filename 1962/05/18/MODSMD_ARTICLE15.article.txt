# Book Project Still Growing

(Editor’s Note: This is the sec
ond of two articles on the UK’s
Books for East Africa Project.)

“It took well over a year to for
mulate the plan for the HR
‘Books for East Africa’ Project,
and make arrangements for its
financing,” said Jim Haas, chair
man of the Project in a special
report. “And the project as now
planned will extend far beyond
just this year or just this group
of people or shipment of books.
“The African book project at
Stanford was begun as one of the
logical activities of the African
Desk last year. Before anything
was begun, last year’s chairman
went to Washington to learn the
best and most meaningful way to
ship books and the actual trans
portation problems involved.
“HE RETURNED with the ru
diment of the present plan and
also an agreement from the
United States Book Exchange—a
part of AlD—to ship books from
Washington to anywhere in Afri
ca.
“However, because the plan
called for continuing shipments
to various areas, finding the
transportation from Stanford to
Washington proved very difficult.
“In the meantime, the project
accepted 75,000 books collected
mostly by high school students

in California. By September, since
wo had not found any through
transportation, we contacted the
State Department and AID for
help,” he said.
“They discovered that the num
ber of books that we intended to
send would be prohibitively ex
pensive under the agreed system,
so the whole usefulness of the
project was again surveyed.”
AT THIS TIME, the AID Mis
sion in Nairobi, Kenya, having
heard of the project, requested
that the AID headquarters make
arrangements to have the books
sent to their area of former Brit
ish East Africa.
Because of this recommenda
tion, after the four months time,
AID decided to drop the agree
ment made with the Book Ex
change and investigate to see
whether it was worthwhile to
contract with Stanford and the
HR to have the HR ship the
books to East Africa.
“All during this time, influen
tial and sympathetic people in
Washington were contacted and
told of the project,” Haas said.
This investigation included
proving to AID that the HR
would only send books wanted by
the Africans, that transportation
was feasible, and that the costs
were in order. HR submitted a
$20,000 budget that would be
needed to carry out the project.
ALTHOUGH these stipulations
and budgets were approved, the
money was still not forthcoming
until the AID East Africa Mission
finally last week was able to
make the money available from
its own budget. The money will
actually be administered through
Dr. Paul Hanna. Prof, of Child
Education, and Dr. Peter Durg
nan, Curator of the African col
lection at Hoover Library, who
were asked by AID to supervise
the spending of the money.
The Project will also have a
tremendous influence on the HR
itself. Joel Meister, president of

HR, said that the grant to HR is
comparable to the Ford Founda
tion grant to Stanford. “This
grant by the United States gov
ernment to the HR is unprece
dented, not only in the HR’s fif
teen year history but among all
student organizations in the
country. Those students who have
worked on the project directly
merit the gratitude of the entire
University.
“I am confident that such rec
ognition and support of the HR
will continue to be merited in
future years; for here is a graph
ic example of the important effect
which students can have on world
affairs today.”
HAAS ESTIMATES that, when
the Project really begins work
ing next year, over fifty people
will be needed to do desk work,
help sort and pack books and do
other work involved with the
Project.
Haas also said that they hope
that the Project will stimulate a
great amount of mutual Interest
and concern between California
and African schools. “Pen Pal”
and other exchange programs
will be encouraged and it is
hoped that the schools in Cali
fornia will take up private proj
ects to aid the Africans. Haas
said that their lines of transporta
tion will be available to the Cali
fornia schools.
