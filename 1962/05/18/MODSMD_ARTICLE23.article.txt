# Stanford Nine Finishes League Play Here Against Santa Clara
## 
### 
Stanford hosts Cal in their
fourth meeting of the year today
on the Sunken Diamond at 3 p.m.,
and tomorrow faces Santa Clara
in a home double-header, starting
at 1 p.m.
With only three games remain
ing, the Indians have no chance
of overtaking second-place Santa
Clara in the CIBA, but Cal, in
third place, one game ahead of
Stanford, is within reach.
The Bears hold an edge over the
Indians in games this year, hav
ing taken two out of three. How
ever, all three games have been
close, the Bears winning 4-1 and
5-2, and losing 4-1.
COACH DUTCH Fehring named
Jim Lonborg to start today and
Darrell Sutherland to hurl to
morrow’s first game. The second
starter against Santa Clara is
undecided, the choice from among
Pete Dixon. Joe Schultz, and War
ren Newell.
The Indian starting lineups for
this weekend’s games will prob
ably be Jack Allen at first, O. J.
Solander at second, Joel Shulman
at short, Rich Ferrazzano at third,
Bob Overman catching, and an
outfield of Tom May in left, Greg
Post in center, and Jim Chenu in
light.
Lonborg, the starter against
Cal, has pitched Stanford’s only
victory against the Boars, hold
ing them to five hits. He has a
1-2 record overall in the CIBA.
Sutherland has posted a 2-4 rec
ord in conference.
COACH FLUKING expects Cal
to start sophomore Dave Dowling
in today’s game. Dowling, in his

last start against the Indians
pitched five innings, striking out
nine and allowing only three hits,
although he was tagged with the
loss.

The coach also expects Santa
Clara to start Bob Magrini in one
of tomorrow’s games. The Bron
co’s ace pitcher, Bob Garibaldi,

will probably not pitch against
Stanford, since he is scheduled to
face USC today. Garibaldi has a
4-1 CIBA record and is leading
the conference in strikeouts.

In two previous encounters be
tween the two clubs, Santa Clara
won, taking the first 4-3, and the
second 9-7.
