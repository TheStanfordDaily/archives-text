# Stanford Holds Northern Cal Track Meet Here Tomorrow
## 
### PETE KING 
A collection of most of the fin
est track and field athletes in
northern California will be on
hand tomorrow in Stanford Sta
dium to compete individually in
the Northern California Invita
tional Track Meet. The field
events will start at 1:30 p.m., and
the first track event at 2.
There will be no team score
totaled at the meet, in keeping
with its tradition of individual
competition. Athletes in the meet
will come from the track squads
of Stanford, San Francisco State,
Cal, San Jose State, and Santa
Clara Valley Youth Village.
THE 440 LOOMS as one of the
most exciting events. Dave Archi
bald of Cal, who tied the national
frosh mark here two Weeks ago
with a 46.7 clocking, will be battl
ing with Olympic star Jack Yer
man of SCVYV. Yerman’s best
lap this season is a speedy 46.6.
Keith Thomassen of SCVYV, who
has done 47.2, can’t be counted
out.

Equally close will be the jave- 1
lin, where Dick Bocks’ throw of
248-8 c for SCVYV is challenged
by teammate John Fromm's
246-'•> and a 247-’L> heave by Dan
Studney of San Jose State. Art
Batchelder of Stanford is right
behind with a 241-sbest.
In other field events the com
petition is just as fierce. The high
jump will feature three 6-10 plus
jumpers in Cal's (lene Johnson,
San Jose’s Vance Barnes, and
SCVYV’s Phil Fehlen. Johnson

soared over seven feet a month
ago, and just missed that height
in the Stanford-Cal meet. Fehlen
is a former Stanford jumper who
holds the school record of 6-B’i.
STARTING HEIGHT in the
pole vault will be 14 feet, with
Stanford’s 15-foot vaulter Phil
White going against two 15-foot
men from SCVYV, Jeff Chase and
Ed Taylor.
Stanford record-holder Dave
Weill will have to be in top form
to beat SCVYV’s Jay Sylvester,

who has flipped the discus 195-7
officially and 210 feet unofficial
ly. Weill’s 18911 toss is the Card
record.

Cal’s Dave Maggard is two and
a half feet in front of his compe
tition in the shot put and is the
heavy favorite. The broad jump
has four entrants who have gone
over 24 feet, headed by Walt Rob
erts of San Jose State with a 24-
7' 2 jump. Stanford’s Dan Moore
is right behind him with a 24-4*2
leap.
THE SPRINTS SHOULD pro
duce a four-way duel between
Lloyd Murad and Dwight Middle
ton of the San Jose frosh. Larry
Questad of the Stanford frosh,
and Bob Poynter of SCVYV.
Middleton has run the 220 in 20.9
seconds, best performance of the
group, but he’ll be pressured by
Murad (21.2) and Questad (21.3),
as well as by five others who have
clockings of 21.3 or better.
Murad's 9.5 in the 100-yard dash
is threatened by Middleton’s 9.6,
Questad’s wind-aided 9.5, and
Poynter’s wind-aided 9.4.
The 880 could see the stadium
record of 1:48.5, set by Stanford’s
Ernie Cunliffe in 1960, be wiped
out. Jerry Siebert of Santa Clara
Youth Village has a 1:48.4 half
mile to his credit this season and
teammate Jack Yerman a 1:48.6.
Both runners are far ahead of
their competition.
UNLESS STANFORD'S Harry
McCalla runs in the two-mile,
Charley Clark of SCVYV should
win easily. Clark’s best of 8:52.4
is more than 10 seconds better
than any other entrant. However,
if Payton Jordan decides to run
McCalla 18:52.7) against Clark
instead of in the 880, the crowd
should be treated to a great race.
Tonight Stanford is sending
five men south to Los Angeles
to compete in the Coliseum re
lays. Dave Weill in the discus and
(he two-mile relay team of Rich
Klier, Harry McCalla, Bill Pratt,
and Robin Ruble will face some of
the nation’s fop talent.


DAN MOORE is one of three Stanford broadjumpers entered in the
Nor Cal Invitational tomorrow. Moore is the second best jumper
in the AAWU this year with a mark of 24-4¼, topped only by Chuck
Barth's 24-4 3 / 4 . Other Stanford entries in the event are Larry Chuk
wudebe and Steve Cartwright.

ago, and just missed that height
in the Stanford-Cal meet. Fehlen
is a former Stanford jumper who
holds the school record of 6-B’i.
STARTING HEIGHT in the
pole vault will be 14 feet, with
Stanford’s 15-foot vaulter Phil
White going against two 15-foot
men from SCVYV, Jeff Chase and
Ed Taylor.
Stanford record-holder Dave
Weill will have to be in top form
to beat SCVYV’s Jay Sylvester,

who has flipped the discus 195-7
officially and 210 feet unofficial
ly. Weill’s 18911 toss is the Card
record.

Cal’s Dave Maggard is two and
a half feet in front of his compe
tition in the shot put and is the
heavy favorite. The broad jump
has four entrants who have gone
over 24 feet, headed by Walt Rob
erts of San Jose State with a 24-
7' 2 jump. Stanford’s Dan Moore
is right behind him with a 24-4*2
leap.
THE SPRINTS SHOULD pro
duce a four-way duel between
Lloyd Murad and Dwight Middle
ton of the San Jose frosh. Larry
Questad of the Stanford frosh,
and Bob Poynter of SCVYV.
Middleton has run the 220 in 20.9
seconds, best performance of the
group, but he’ll be pressured by
Murad (21.2) and Questad (21.3),
as well as by five others who have
clockings of 21.3 or better.
Murad's 9.5 in the 100-yard dash
is threatened by Middleton’s 9.6,
Questad’s wind-aided 9.5, and
Poynter’s wind-aided 9.4.
The 880 could see the stadium
record of 1:48.5, set by Stanford’s
Ernie Cunliffe in 1960, be wiped
out. Jerry Siebert of Santa Clara
Youth Village has a 1:48.4 half
mile to his credit this season and
teammate Jack Yerman a 1:48.6.
Both runners are far ahead of
their competition.
UNLESS STANFORD'S Harry
McCalla runs in the two-mile,
Charley Clark of SCVYV should
win easily. Clark’s best of 8:52.4
is more than 10 seconds better
than any other entrant. However,
if Payton Jordan decides to run
McCalla 18:52.7) against Clark
instead of in the 880, the crowd
should be treated to a great race.
Tonight Stanford is sending
five men south to Los Angeles
to compete in the Coliseum re
lays. Dave Weill in the discus and
(he two-mile relay team of Rich
Klier, Harry McCalla, Bill Pratt,
and Robin Ruble will face some of
the nation’s fop talent.


DAN MOORE is one of three Stanford broadjumpers entered in the
Nor Cal Invitational tomorrow. Moore is the second best jumper
in the AAWU this year with a mark of 24-4¼, topped only by Chuck
Barth's 24-4 3 / 4 . Other Stanford entries in the event are Larry Chuk
wudebe and Steve Cartwright.
A collection of most of the fin
est track and field athletes in
northern California will be on
hand tomorrow in Stanford Sta
dium to compete individually in
the Northern California Invita
tional Track Meet. The field
events will start at 1:30 p.m., and
the first track event at 2.
There will be no team score
totaled at the meet, in keeping
with its tradition of individual
competition. Athletes in the meet
will come from the track squads
of Stanford, San Francisco State,
Cal, San Jose State, and Santa
Clara Valley Youth Village.
THE 440 LOOMS as one of the
most exciting events. Dave Archi
bald of Cal, who tied the national
frosh mark here two Weeks ago
with a 46.7 clocking, will be battl
ing with Olympic star Jack Yer
man of SCVYV. Yerman’s best
lap this season is a speedy 46.6.
Keith Thomassen of SCVYV, who
has done 47.2, can’t be counted
out.

Equally close will be the jave- 1
lin, where Dick Bocks’ throw of
248-8 c for SCVYV is challenged
by teammate John Fromm's
246-'•> and a 247-’L> heave by Dan
Studney of San Jose State. Art
Batchelder of Stanford is right
behind with a 241-sbest.
In other field events the com
petition is just as fierce. The high
jump will feature three 6-10 plus
jumpers in Cal's (lene Johnson,
San Jose’s Vance Barnes, and
SCVYV’s Phil Fehlen. Johnson

Questad’s wind-aided 9.5, and
Poynter’s wind-aided 9.4.
The 880 could see the stadium
record of 1:48.5, set by Stanford’s
Ernie Cunliffe in 1960, be wiped
out. Jerry Siebert of Santa Clara
Youth Village has a 1:48.4 half
mile to his credit this season and
teammate Jack Yerman a 1:48.6.
Both runners are far ahead of
their competition.
UNLESS STANFORD'S Harry
McCalla runs in the two-mile,
Charley Clark of SCVYV should
win easily. Clark’s best of 8:52.4
is more than 10 seconds better
than any other entrant. However,
if Payton Jordan decides to run
McCalla 18:52.7) against Clark
instead of in the 880, the crowd
should be treated to a great race.
Tonight Stanford is sending
five men south to Los Angeles
to compete in the Coliseum re
lays. Dave Weill in the discus and
(he two-mile relay team of Rich
Klier, Harry McCalla, Bill Pratt,
and Robin Ruble will face some of
the nation’s fop talent.


DAN MOORE is one of three Stanford broadjumpers entered in the
Nor Cal Invitational tomorrow. Moore is the second best jumper
in the AAWU this year with a mark of 24-4¼, topped only by Chuck
Barth's 24-4 3 / 4 . Other Stanford entries in the event are Larry Chuk
wudebe and Steve Cartwright.
A collection of most of the fin
est track and field athletes in
northern California will be on
hand tomorrow in Stanford Sta
dium to compete individually in
the Northern California Invita
tional Track Meet. The field
events will start at 1:30 p.m., and
the first track event at 2.
There will be no team score
totaled at the meet, in keeping
with its tradition of individual
competition. Athletes in the meet
will come from the track squads
of Stanford, San Francisco State,
Cal, San Jose State, and Santa
Clara Valley Youth Village.
THE 440 LOOMS as one of the
most exciting events. Dave Archi
bald of Cal, who tied the national
frosh mark here two Weeks ago
with a 46.7 clocking, will be battl
ing with Olympic star Jack Yer
man of SCVYV. Yerman’s best
lap this season is a speedy 46.6.
Keith Thomassen of SCVYV, who
has done 47.2, can’t be counted
out.

Equally close will be the jave- 1
lin, where Dick Bocks’ throw of
248-8 c for SCVYV is challenged
by teammate John Fromm's
246-'•> and a 247-’L> heave by Dan
Studney of San Jose State. Art
Batchelder of Stanford is right
behind with a 241-sbest.
In other field events the com
petition is just as fierce. The high
jump will feature three 6-10 plus
jumpers in Cal's (lene Johnson,
San Jose’s Vance Barnes, and
SCVYV’s Phil Fehlen. Johnson

soared over seven feet a month
ago, and just missed that height
in the Stanford-Cal meet. Fehlen
is a former Stanford jumper who
holds the school record of 6-B’i.
STARTING HEIGHT in the
pole vault will be 14 feet, with
Stanford’s 15-foot vaulter Phil
White going against two 15-foot
men from SCVYV, Jeff Chase and
Ed Taylor.
Stanford record-holder Dave
Weill will have to be in top form
to beat SCVYV’s Jay Sylvester,

who has flipped the discus 195-7
officially and 210 feet unofficial
ly. Weill’s 18911 toss is the Card
record.

Cal’s Dave Maggard is two and
a half feet in front of his compe
tition in the shot put and is the
heavy favorite. The broad jump
has four entrants who have gone
over 24 feet, headed by Walt Rob
erts of San Jose State with a 24-
7' 2 jump. Stanford’s Dan Moore
is right behind him with a 24-4*2
leap.
THE SPRINTS SHOULD pro
duce a four-way duel between
Lloyd Murad and Dwight Middle
ton of the San Jose frosh. Larry
Questad of the Stanford frosh,
and Bob Poynter of SCVYV.
Middleton has run the 220 in 20.9
seconds, best performance of the
group, but he’ll be pressured by
Murad (21.2) and Questad (21.3),
as well as by five others who have
clockings of 21.3 or better.
Murad's 9.5 in the 100-yard dash
is threatened by Middleton’s 9.6,
