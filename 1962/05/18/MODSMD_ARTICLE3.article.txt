# Hunt for 'Measure' Backstage Crew On
## 
### 
Openings in the backstage crew for the forthcoming produc
tion of Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure” have been an
nounced hy the Stanford Players.
Workers in costume design, make-up, shift crew, costume crew
and set building are needed. Paid Landry, technical director for

the production, emphasized )hat+
no experience is necessary. Lan
dry and Douglas Russell, cos
tume designer, will train the
crews.
Activity or academic credit is
being offered for any work done
on this production.
The available positions are
open to both men and women.
Because of the size of the produc
tion, a larger crew than usual is
needed. Anyone interested should
see Landry in the Scene Shop or
Russell in the Costume Shop,
backstage in Memorial Theatre.
“Measure for Measure” opens
May 31 and runs through June 2.
Crew work begins May 21 and
runs through rehearsals and
three performances, ending June
2 with a full cast party.
Crews can work either 1-5 p.m.
or 7-11 p.m. Shift and costume
crews work evenings during re
hearsals and run of the play.
Costumers sew, by hand or ma
chine, press and do basic work on
costumes. A quick change crew
to aid players in changes be
tween scenes is needed. People
are needed to build armour and
to sculpt medalions.
The make-up crew creates the
visual character. This crew does
hair-dos, beards and other acces
sories. Landry and Russell will
direct the operations.
Shift crews to move scenes dur
ing rehearsals and during the per
formances are especially needed.


THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS when there aren't any stagehands. The
cast has to act as back stage crew. That's what happening in
"Measure for Measure'' produced by the Stanford Players. They
need crew.
