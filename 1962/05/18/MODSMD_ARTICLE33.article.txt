William M. Fairbank puts Stan
ford ahead in this annual science
sweepstakes which is sponsored
by the California Museum of Sci

Stanford physicists have receiv
ed the coveted prize twice, com
pared to once for UC-Berkeley
physicists and one-half (shared
once) for Cal Tech physicists.
Both the latter institutions have
won it in other fields, however,
giving them total scores of one
and a half awards each.
Prof. Fairbank was honored
for his recent discoveries in
“superconductivity,” a strange
kind of electrical perpetual mo
