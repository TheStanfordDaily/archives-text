# Fun Stan Change OK

LASSU last night approved the
proposed amendment to the Fun
damental Standard without a stu
dent referendum and heard Dan
Cohen’s report on the Adminis
tration’s stand on the Peace For
um.
Wayne Barch led a revolt for
greater LASSU power. He pointed
out that the previous large issues,
the Constitution and liquor, had
gone to a student vote, that one
could get the idea that LASSU
does nothing.
Jock Mcßaine stated that the
earlier referendums were needed
on legal or public relations
grounds, and that a referendum
here would be educational. Mar
tha Sweeney stated that Daily
articles and the Fun Stan book
would be adequate publication.
TUB “THIRD person responsi
bility’’ clause of the amendment
was strengthened to include re
porting to the authorities Fun
Stan violations which cannot be
corrected by personal action.
This was criticized as a viola
tion of privacy, but it was an
swered that third person respon
sibility is already a part of the
publicity on the Fun Stan, if not
of the Fun Stan itself.
Patty Falk then moved that the
word “morality” be stricken from
the proposed amendment, as
“morality” is usually interpreted
as sexual morality, which is a
private matter. LASSU did not
agree.
DAN COHEN OF the Peace
Forum reported that the Admin
istration has refused permission
for the debate, “Nuclear Testing:
Does It Decrease or Increase the
Chances for War?”
“The Administration has denied
us open meeting, and will allow
us to act only under Poli Union,”
he said. “We will do so, hut we are
sorry to see student responsibility
taken away in a traditionally stu
dent area,” Cohen concluded.
