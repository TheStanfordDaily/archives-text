# Trustees Want Still More Liquor ’Study’
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
Stanford’s Board of Trustees yesterday referred the student
proposal for a new liquor policy back to President Wallace Ster
ling for further study.
According to Lyle M. Nelson, director of university relations,
the trustees believed the liquor question was a complex problem

warranting more careful consid
eration than could be given on
short notice at a single meeting.
The trustees’ action follows nor
mal university procedures.
“YES, their action certainly
does follow normal university pro
cedures,” begins a statement from
students Jim Stewart, Dave
French, Joel Meister and Dean
Savage, initiators of the new liq
uor policy.
"We simply do not understand
why there is need for further
study,” continues the statement
to The Daily. “The matter has
been under consideration by the
Student Affairs Committee for
well over a year and a complete
report has been prepared.
“Some years ago, President
Sterling studied the possibility of
lowering the state drinking age
to 18. We cannot believe that he
would propose such a radical step
without studying the problem in
detail.
“OUK proposal is not wrought
with difficult problems. We only
ask that drinking practices at
Stanford be consistent with those
existing in the majority of homes
and communities throughout the
United States. We merely pro
pose that we follow state law.
“We are assuming,” continues
the statement, “that the Presi
dent is acting in good faith; that
he wishes to study the question in
greater detail; that the present
move is not an effort to kill the
new policy by inaction.
“Students now consider the
new liquor policy in effect. We
have a new student body presi
dent who is determined to insti
tute the new policy. Students all
over the campus have pledged
themselves to push again next
year if necessary, twice as hard
and twice as loud.
“IT IS generally conceded that,
as far as the University’s position
is concerned, the matter is in
Sterling’s hands. A trustee has
told us that if the President pre
sented a liquor policy to the trus
tees, it would pass. If he opposes
the new policy, it will not pass the
board,
“We assume that definite ac
tion will be taken at the next
trustees meeting,” concludes the
statement.
Present University regulations
bar all students from the use or
possession of liquor on campus.
On May 4, students voted four to
one in favor of changing the
ASSU by-laws so that persons
over 21 could drink. Any change
in the regulation must obtain
trustee approval to become ef
fective.
Sterling plans to consult facul
ty groups which already are
studying the problem prior to
making any final recommenda
tion to the trustees. These in
clude the Committee on Student
Affairs and Services and the Com
mittee on University Policy.

“OUK proposal is not wrought
with difficult problems. We only
ask that drinking practices at
Stanford be consistent with those

United States. We merely pro

the statement, “that the Presi

“Students now consider the
new liquor policy in effect. We
have a new student body presi

over the campus have pledged
themselves to push again next
year if necessary, twice as hard
and twice as loud.
“IT IS generally conceded that,
as far as the University’s position
is concerned, the matter is in

Present University regulations
bar all students from the use or
possession of liquor on campus.
On May 4, students voted four to
one in favor of changing the
ASSU by-laws so that persons
over 21 could drink. Any change
in the regulation must obtain
trustee approval to become ef
fective.
Sterling plans to consult facul
ty groups which already are
studying the problem prior to
making any final recommenda

Affairs and Services and the Com

Stanford’s Board of Trustees yesterday referred the student
proposal for a new liquor policy back to President Wallace Ster
ling for further study.
According to Lyle M. Nelson, director of university relations,
the trustees believed the liquor question was a complex problem

warranting more careful consid
eration than could be given on
short notice at a single meeting.
The trustees’ action follows nor
mal university procedures.
“YES, their action certainly
does follow normal university pro
cedures,” begins a statement from
students Jim Stewart, Dave
French, Joel Meister and Dean
Savage, initiators of the new liq
uor policy.
"We simply do not understand
why there is need for further
study,” continues the statement
to The Daily. “The matter has
been under consideration by the
Student Affairs Committee for
well over a year and a complete
report has been prepared.
“Some years ago, President
