The new method is known as
the indirect immunofluorescent
procedure. The scientists isolated
in rabbits blood the antibody
which reacts with the group A |
germs. To this antibody was
bound chemically a compound j
which fluoresces under ultra-vio-1
let light. Mixed with bacteria
from the patientâ€™s throat, the flu j
orescent antibodies combine with j
the group A germs so they can
be seen in an ultra-violet micro- 1
scope.
The same fluorescent chemical [
has been combined with other
antibodies to detect other dis
eases.
