AiswVV to get a job in
the business world and...
marry the boss T s daughter
Many are the ways to succeed in
business with or without really
trying. You could be a bonus
rookie with the Giants* You
could start another Playboy,
You could, well.,,those things
take talent and/or capital. But
there are some things you can
do to make Job hunting easier
and more productive*
1 First, figure out not only
what kind of job you’d like,
but what kind you’re best suit
ed for. Do you like people?
Maybe you should try selling.
Or maybe you’d prefer a behind
the-scenes occupation. Many
men are happily engaged thusly
and profitably. Finding out
is easier than you think, with
professional aptitude and in
terest tests. Seek one out,
many are free.
3 The resume. Whether you
are applying in person or by
letter, you’ll need a brief,
well-prepared resume - a run
down on your background - your
scholastic and extracurricular
achievements, your working ex
perience (last job first), any
special skills. Just the facts
please, no embellishments.
Have it professionally typed,
and include a small photo of
your smiling self for remembr
ance value when you call.
3 Ready? Gol Here, the
magic word is contacts, the
more the better - your friends,
teachers, school counselors,
anybody. The more people that
know you’re looking, the better
the odds. Another thing. Don't
overlook learning simple, us
able skills, like typing or run
ning office machines. They can
be a door opener because you
know something they can use,
now.
4 The interview. Send your
resume first, with a covering
letter. Wait a day or so, then
phone for an appointment. You’ll
get some turndowns, of course,
but most businessmen are glad
to talk to job seekers if, that
is, you make a good impression,
are courteous, and somewhat in
formed on their business. Re
member, they’re not as interest
ed in vou as in what you can do
for them.
PS Now that you’ve got the
job and engagement to the pres
ident’s lovely daughter is only
a matter of time, remember that
stalwart, dependable Roos/Atkins
started you on the way. Remem
ber too, that R/A stands ready
to help you further your career
with appropriately correct
clothing, from opening day to
your retirement banquet. And
one more thing...good luckl
