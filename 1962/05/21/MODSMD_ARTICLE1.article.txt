# Stanford's Distribution of Grades Stricter than Yale
## 
### CHRIS WILLS 
Members of Harvard, Yale, and Amherst
freshman classes of very similar ability and
educational goals as those of Stanford fresh
man classes receive approximately 6 times
as many straight A averages, 3 times as
many 8+ averages, and about 2Vz times as
many Bf averages, and about 2'/ 2 times as
D. Black of the Counseling and Testing Cen
ter concluded.
About the same percentage earn CM- (2.5)
at Stanford as receive B (3.0) at the eastern
institutions.
Increasing aptitude and scholarly motiva
tions of Stanford undergrads require new
methods of recognizing and stimulating su
perior academic performance. One sugges
tion is to liberalize the distribution of grades.
THE PURPOSE of Black’s study on the
grading practices of other universities is to
help appraise Stanford’s situation. Included
in this study were the distributions of grade
point averages of male freshmen at seven

institutions, including Stanford.
From these studies it appears that Stan
ford’s distribution of grades among fresh
men men coincides best with the distribution
at Northwestern University and is slightly
more liberal than the ones at Carnegie Insti
tute of Technology (Pittsburgh).
Stanford’s distribution resembles the dis
tribution at San Francisco State College
more than it does those at Harvard, Yale,
and Amherst. Black states that it seems
doubtful that this fact is recognized in evalu
ating applicants for graduate study, even by
Stanford.
Black has found that in 1959 the per cent
of freshmen men on the Dean’s List at Har
vard was 45 per cent; at Yale 27 per cent;
in 1960 at Carnegie Tech 20 per cent; at Am
herst 11 per cent; at Stanford 5 per cent. “It
seems doubtful that a nominal award which
is beyond the reach of 19 out of 20 Stanford
students serves the function of stimulating
many of them to work for it,” Black com
mented.

SINCE 1954 the grade point average has
increased .15 at Cal Tech, .21 at Yale, while
at Stanford it has decreased .08. It would
appear that grading has gradually been lib
eralized at both Cal Tech and Yale, presum
ably in relationship to increased selectivity,
while at Stanford no such change has oc
curred.
Black observed that a goal provides useful
motivating power only so long as it is con
ceivably attainable. He believes that limiting
the recognition of a high grade point average
Stanford may be contributing to students’
academic apathy.
The concern that a Stanford degree might
lose prestige if grading were liberalized ap
pears clearly unwarranted: Harvard. Yale,
Amherst, and Cal Tech all have substantially
more generous grading policies yet continue
to command prestige.
The grade point average of Stanford wom
en is consistently about one-quarter of a
point above the men according to Black. Last
year men constituted 70 per cent of the un

dergraduate student body but represented
only 57 per cent of the Dean’s List.
UNTIL THE PAST few years, it seemed
possible to account for this phenomenon in
terms of the higher aptitude of the women,
but this explanation is no longer adequate in
view of the great improvement in the apti
tude of male students enrolling. Nor does it
appear likely that women spend significantly
more time studying or with better concen
tration.
In some investigations made by Black of
the relationship between personality and mo
tivaitonal factors and various aspects of per
formance, several interesting trait patterns
appear in men who do well academically. An
important one of those might be called co
operativeness, which includes the tendency
to be described as helpful, moderate, respect
ful, appreciative, sympathetic, and sensitive.
This constellation of traits is much more
characteristic of women than of men in our
culture.
A question raised by the sox differences

is whether women students are the benefici
aries of an unconscious bias on the part of
the faculty.
BLACK SPECULATES another possibili
ty, that perhaps in evaluating students, pro
fessors stress these characteristics more than
creativity and originality which are more fre
quently found in men.
Sixty per cent of Stanford's freshman
men aspire to graduate study beyond the
master’s level while only 26 per cent of the
women do. Thus, the undergraduate grading
preference enjoyed by women may jeopard
ize the opportunity for some men to obtain
admission to graduate programs Black
states.
No definitive study has been made
whether liberalization of grading standards
would reduce student incentive to study. It
is Black’s impression that with 60 per cent
of all G.P.A.’s falling within one grade point
(2.0-3.0), many able students develop a fatal
istic attitude which leads to performance
below their capacities.
