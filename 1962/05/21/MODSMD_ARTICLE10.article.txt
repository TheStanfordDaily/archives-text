# Guido Government Demands Elections
## 
### 
BUENOS AIRES (UPI)-President Jose M. Guido’s eight
week-old government recessed congress yesterday, ordered a
reorganization of political parties and scheduled new elections
next March for 94 annulled seats in the lower house.
The sweeping series of moves, approved at a lengthy cabinet

meeting which lasted until the
early hours of the morning, re
moved the Peronists from politi
cal power.
THIS HAS been the inflexible
demand of the armed forces’
leaders whose alarm over the
sweeping gains scored by Peron
ists in elections last March 18 led
first to their ouster of President
Arturo Frondizi and then to nulli
fication of the election results.
These included the governor
ships of 10 provinces and 94 seats
in (he 192-seat chamber of depu
ties.
ALTHOUGH the Peronists won
hut 47 of the 94 scats up for elec
tion last March in the chamber,
the government voided all the re
sults. In the gubernatorial con
tests Peronists and pro-Peronists
won seven of the 10 posts at
stake.
Guido ordered new elections for
the annulled chamber seats to be
held next March 31 and reiterated
the pledge to hold presidential
elections on Oct. 27, 1963.
Elections of provincial officials,
including the 10 nullified guben
ratorial posts, will also be held
on March 31.
