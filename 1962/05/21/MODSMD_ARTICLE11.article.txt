# JFK Appeals To Physicians
## 
### 
NEW YORK (UPD—President
Kennedy Sunday went over the
head of the American Medical As
sociation to appeal directly to the
nation’s doctors to support his
medical care for the aged legisla
tion.
Kennedy asked during a Madi
son Square Garden rally wit
nessed by more than 20,000 per
sons and a nationwide television
audience that physicians write di
rectly to him for information
about the controversial King-An
derson bill rather than getting it
from the AMA.
HE SAID THAT he could not
recognize the bill as explained by
the journal of the AMA, which
strongly opposes the bill which
would tie medical care for the
elderly to Social Security.
Kennedy rejected the idea that
medical care for the aged fi
nanced by social security would
“sap” the traditional American
quality of self reliance.
HE SAID THAT nothing could
possibly destroy self-reliance
more than the burden of massive
medical bills being passed on
from patients to other genera
tions.
Kennedy invited the physicians
of the nation to write him, Secre
tary of Health, Education and
Welfare, Abraham Ribicoff or
sponsors of the legislation, asking
for a precise explanation of the
King-Anderson bill and even a
copy of the measure itself.
