# CRITIC SAYS:
## Student Art Formative' 
### GRETCHEN HAROLD HA Candidate in Art 
Goethe once stated, and Ernst
Cassirer later concurred, that art
was most exciting in its “forma
tive stage.” Any roughness in the
form at this stage was significant.
To me this is one of the most ex
citing aspects in a good art show.
There is an almost mad adhesion
to personal conviction, an unde
niable lack of “method-school”
consistency of means, among the
pieces in the Student Art Show.
Works that displayed a particu
lar excellence beyond this forma
tive proficiency, I would cite as
James Malott’s winged creature;
Gail Winbigler’s woman in black,
and her drawing of the dark-skin
ned figure; Gordon Pomeroy’s
mother with two children in sand
stone, and his complex dabbled
canvas with an activity like the
colors and lights of a circus-fair
at night; Harvey Nelson’s still
life with its severity of pure col
ors and his Wrestlers; Louisa
King’s still life in red and yellow,
and her watercolor “Cote d’Azur a
Nice”; William Schwarz’ sensitive
construction in nails and tacks,
and Gordon Brofft’s many pieces
in wood, his furniture and his
dazzling playschool-like mobile.
DRAWINGS ABE the best rep
resented category in the show.
The structural activity of Mi
chael Moore’s landscapes and Gin
ger Hale’s life drawings has a
satisfying expressive freedom.
James Bischoff’s and Linda Frie
del’s more passive and introspec
tive portrait sketches are also in
volving. Kaye Bonner’s man and
boy at checkers is keenly con
ceived.

The textiles provide a lively way
of panelling off different sections
of the exhibition, Mary Rouse’s
brown and gold design and her
spiny design in gray showing the
most originality, though the en
tire group is attractive. Eva Cock
croft’s sandstone head is a very
successful piece of sculpture.
THERE IS a good intensity
throughout many of the works in
this exhibition, but in the major
arts painting and sculpture) es
pecially, there is an evasion of
the deepest problems in those ma
terials with the most complex po
tentials. My feeling about many
of the works is that there was not
a lack of evocative intent, but
probably a timidity or impatience
of the artists in the face of the
many alternatives the materials
provide. A good still life has an
8” square of negative, undevelop
ed background. The figure of
James Malott’s creature is timid
in its cliched anonymity, against
the magnificent organic junctures
in the segments of its wing;
which would not have been dam
aged by a more specific, active
opposing mass; yet I would still
call this the most monumental
work in the exhibition.
The Show runs through Sunday
at the Art Gallery, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.
Tuesday through Saturday, 1-4
p.m. on Sunday.
