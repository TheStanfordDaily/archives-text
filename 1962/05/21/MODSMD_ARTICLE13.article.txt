# The 						Role of the Stanford Administration
## Can't Answer? File!

Tin* referring of (lie student proposal for a new liquor policy
back to President Sterling by (lie board ol Trustees last Thursday
was disappointing to ns. bid we can not sav that its was unexpect
ed. Such a if-we-don t-w'ant-to-answer-it-now-refer-it-hack-to-com
miftee kind ol policy has become verv familiar.
Wc can appreciate the type of bureaucracy that, of necessity,
must exist in this kind of institution. We understand that this
bureaucracy must he a horizontal one; that it must be run by com
mittees of equal rank professors in untold numbers of equal rank
committees, sub-committees, sub sub-committees, and so forth.
We can understand and appreciate that this system is neces
sarily a cumbersome one and that many people must he contacted
before a final decision can he made. We can even understand and
appreciate that decisions must he handled carefully for we till walk
gently on the egg shells of a 3100 million drive, and that those
who are likely to give that money are touchy about having their
fingers, or their egg shells, the least hit hurt.
We can understand and appreciate all of this, hut we can not
condone it, and wc can not find sympathy for it.
Wc understand, also, that this University is, to those who are
concerned with its operation, a long range project. Wc can under
stand that under this system, it seems more important to think
about the future than the present. It seems more important to trip
lightly around a touchy question brought forth by the present
student body than to risk the security of the student body of the
future by possibly contradicting the moral, political or emotional
views of some wealthy donor, but, again, we can not condone
this system.
The standing policy, then, seems to ns to become one in which
should some question he presented by the student body to the
Administration as a possible policy change consideration, the host
thing that can he done is to shuffle it off to a committee and hold
off any official comments or policies until either Finals Week or
the summer, when students are either ton busy to protest a de
cision, or arc not here at all.
We question the accuracy of such an (apparent) policy. In
this institution, it would seem at least as important to he con
cerned with the education of its present students as it is with the
education of ones in the future, and the expressing, and answering
of opinions, is part of this education.
We question whether it is that important to have $lOO million,
when you risk producing a student w ho, no matter how well edu
cated in science or engineering or the writing of reports he may he,
is unable or unpracticed in the expression of his own independent
thoughts or the evaluation of relative political opinions.
Stanford must learn that it must allow student opinion, and
must provide recognition for that opinion. It can not afford to con
tinue ignoring student ideas or questions.
Stanford can not hope, otherwise, to ever he able to call itself
a “great university."

Wc can appreciate the type of bureaucracy that, of necessity,
must exist in this kind of institution. We understand that this
bureaucracy must he a horizontal one; that it must be run by com
mittees of equal rank professors in untold numbers of equal rank
committees, sub-committees, sub sub-committees, and so forth.
We can understand and appreciate that this system is neces
sarily a cumbersome one and that many people must he contacted
before a final decision can he made. We can even understand and
appreciate that decisions must he handled carefully for we till walk
gently on the egg shells of a 3100 million drive, and that those
who are likely to give that money are touchy about having their
fingers, or their egg shells, the least hit hurt.
We can understand and appreciate all of this, hut we can not
condone it, and wc can not find sympathy for it.
Wc understand, also, that this University is, to those who are
concerned with its operation, a long range project. Wc can under
stand that under this system, it seems more important to think
about the future than the present. It seems more important to trip
lightly around a touchy question brought forth by the present
student body than to risk the security of the student body of the
future by possibly contradicting the moral, political or emotional
views of some wealthy donor, but, again, we can not condone
this system.
The standing policy, then, seems to ns to become one in which
should some question he presented by the student body to the
Administration as a possible policy change consideration, the host
thing that can he done is to shuffle it off to a committee and hold
off any official comments or policies until either Finals Week or
the summer, when students are either ton busy to protest a de
cision, or arc not here at all.
We question the accuracy of such an (apparent) policy. In
this institution, it would seem at least as important to he con
cerned with the education of its present students as it is with the
education of ones in the future, and the expressing, and answering
of opinions, is part of this education.
We question whether it is that important to have $lOO million,
when you risk producing a student w ho, no matter how well edu
cated in science or engineering or the writing of reports he may he,
is unable or unpracticed in the expression of his own independent
thoughts or the evaluation of relative political opinions.
Stanford must learn that it must allow student opinion, and
must provide recognition for that opinion. It can not afford to con
tinue ignoring student ideas or questions.
Stanford can not hope, otherwise, to ever he able to call itself
a “great university."
