Perhaps the most important quality of a university is an atmos
phere ol freedom—freedom for faculty and students to investigate
and discuss issues which concern them, issues of both campus and
international significance, and to form associations to work to
make their ideas realities. Stanford's present policy limiting stu
dent "partisan” organizations succeeds in severely handicapping
any attempt to create real freedom of expression, making our cam
pus one in which the winds of freedom blow—in certain cases,
subject to administration approval.
“The University feels , . . presentation of differing views is a
far wiser policy than to say our platform is closed to any ideas, no
matter how distasteful they may be, or to presume that our
students are so gullible and naive they must be protected in w hat
they hear, Frederick O. Clover, executive assistant to President
Sterling, told a recent alumni conference.
Certainly Stanford can point with pride to this policy of pre
senting all speakers, including those advocating controversial and
unpopular policies, however the administration speaker neglected
to add that only certain student groups are allowed to present
speakers. Thus, while the speakers are not restricted, students are
sevrely limited in their right to present public programs.
The cl aim that Stanfords non partisan character is endangered
by allowing student groups to advocate particular policies and
present public programs involves an extremely loose construction
of the founding grant and seems to be based on a policy of ex
pediency rather than one of freedom. Why encourage students to
create controversy and anger alumni when it is so much easier to
have a quiet, passive student body? “Partisan seems to be defined
as anything controversial. If so, isn’t action on the Ladera Dam
controversial and thus partisan?
The only concrete result of Stanford’s present policy on “par
tisan groups is to make is extremely difficult for student groups
to form, thus encouraging student apathy. We believe that student
groups, such as the peace forum (presently severely restricted in
its activities), which do not use the University name in their title
and clearly state that their views represent not those of the Uni
versity, but those of their members, can only help to make Stan
ford a university where freedom is not merely a pretty slogan but
an actual practice.
We are, of course, basing our views on an assumption
which the administration may not hold—that the primary purpose
of the University is to develop a student body, not only well edu
cated in the academic sense, but prepared to assume a role as
active, concerned citizens of the local and world community.
We can only ask whether the present policy is truly concerned
with student welfare and the preservation of the character of the
founding grant, or if its first concern is university public and
alumni relations and financial contributions. If PACE does come
first, then the existing policy is quite effective, for it makes it ex
tremely easy for students simply not to care and makes the diffi
cult problem of alumni relations much easier for the adminis
tration.

to form, thus encouraging student apathy. We believe that student
groups, such as the peace forum (presently severely restricted in
its activities), which do not use the University name in their title
and clearly state that their views represent not those of the Uni

We are, of course, basing our views on an assumption
which the administration may not hold—that the primary purpose
of the University is to develop a student body, not only well edu
cated in the academic sense, but prepared to assume a role as
active, concerned citizens of the local and world community.
We can only ask whether the present policy is truly concerned
with student welfare and the preservation of the character of the
founding grant, or if its first concern is university public and
alumni relations and financial contributions. If PACE does come
first, then the existing policy is quite effective, for it makes it ex
tremely easy for students simply not to care and makes the diffi
cult problem of alumni relations much easier for the adminis

Perhaps the most important quality of a university is an atmos
phere ol freedom—freedom for faculty and students to investigate
and discuss issues which concern them, issues of both campus and
international significance, and to form associations to work to
make their ideas realities. Stanford's present policy limiting stu
dent "partisan” organizations succeeds in severely handicapping
any attempt to create real freedom of expression, making our cam
pus one in which the winds of freedom blow—in certain cases,
subject to administration approval.
“The University feels , . . presentation of differing views is a
far wiser policy than to say our platform is closed to any ideas, no
matter how distasteful they may be, or to presume that our
students are so gullible and naive they must be protected in w hat
they hear, Frederick O. Clover, executive assistant to President
Sterling, told a recent alumni conference.
Certainly Stanford can point with pride to this policy of pre
senting all speakers, including those advocating controversial and
unpopular policies, however the administration speaker neglected
to add that only certain student groups are allowed to present
speakers. Thus, while the speakers are not restricted, students are
sevrely limited in their right to present public programs.
The cl aim that Stanfords non partisan character is endangered
by allowing student groups to advocate particular policies and
present public programs involves an extremely loose construction
of the founding grant and seems to be based on a policy of ex
