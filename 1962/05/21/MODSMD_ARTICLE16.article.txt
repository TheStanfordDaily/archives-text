NSA
Kclitor, The Daily:
In the midst of such adulation,
j I hesitate to voice discrediting
i remarks against the National
J Student Association; hut it ap-
I pears that the aspiring young pol
iticians of Stanford’s student gov
| ornment, even some administra
| lion higher-ups, are ogling the
| group with an enthusiasm which
can only augur their and our
j wholehearted affiliation. And so,
! lest we be shuffled into line com-
J pletely unaware, a review of some
pertinent facts concerning NSA
seems in order;
j 1) Ttie preamble to its consti
tution begins: “We, the students
j of the United States of America
...” So when policy declara
! lions are issued for international
| scrutiny, they are taken as atti
i tudes common to all American
j students. In fact, however, NSA
I boasts a membership of only
j about one-third of the U.S. stu
dent population.
j 2) Not only is if incorrect that
i NSA represents all American stu
i dents, but it is also highly doubt-
I ful that the 1.3 million “members”
I have much, if any, voice in policy
| decision. The majority of policy

I emanates not from membership
i consensus, not even from the
' “representative" annual congress
lof delegates from member
| schools. Instead, an executive
| committee of 35 officers and re
| gional chairmen Appoints the
i chairmen of “research” commit-
I tees, decides the format of re
search, and then passes judgment
on the resolutions proposed. If
this is effective representation,
then so is the Supreme Soviet.
3) When a resolution is passed
| (whether by congress or execu
| live committee), it is recorded as
j the sole thought of (he entire
I body. Minority dissenting opin
{ ions are not included in the book
1 of policy statements.
4) Nor are there records kept
| of delegates’ voting behavior. Ac-
I countability is apparently not a
| prime consideration of NSA and
) its policy-making apparatus.
Those optimists bent on joining
I and reforming NSA wouid find
themselves heavily outnumbered
by incumbent officials and their
supporters. Cast in this role of
minority dissenters, Stanford re
formers would plow into the same
j barriers traditionally erected by
! NSA against minority opinion and
j would find themselves exploited
j by an organization whose policy
j making engines offer little chance
I for fluid or democratic change.
