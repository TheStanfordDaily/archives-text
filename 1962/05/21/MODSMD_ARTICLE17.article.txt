Fililor, The Dally:
A1 the Monday NSA informa
tion mooting;, a visitor brought up
Northwestern's reoont disaffilia
tion, hoping apparently to give
the impression that the NSA is a
dying organization. The fact is
that since last summer’s national
congress there has been a net in
crease in NSA membership of
twenty colleges and universities,
bringing the total membership to
just under 400,
Among the recent affiliations
have been Rice, Michigan Stale,
Penn State and'the Universities
of Maine, Vermont, Western
Washington. In affiliating, these
universities Joined with Harvard.
Yale. Princeton, Columbia, Cal,
UCLA. Chicago, Michigan, North
Carolina, Washington, Ohio State,
Wisconsin, Texas, Duke, etc.
If this business of who’s going
in and who’s going out is indeed
a relevant consideration surely
there could bo no harm in sotting
the record straight. It is hard to
believe that Stanford’s joining
would not more than compensate
for Northwestern’s leaving.
