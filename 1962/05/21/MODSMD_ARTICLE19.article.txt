Stanford helped Santa Clara
win the Broncos’ first CIBA
crown since the league w T as found
ied in 1927, as the Indians pro
vided the visitors with a sweep
of both ends of their double
header, played Saturday at Sunk
j en Diamond. Coupled with USC’s
i split with Cal, the double win
I gave Santa Clara first place and
j a spot in the NCAA playoffs.
STANFORD’S WIN Friday
| against Cal here gave the Indians
j a brief tie for third but by the end
i of Saturday’s games the Indians
| had settled hack into fourth.
Like the Cal game, Saturday’s
(first game against Santa Clara
went ten innings, although this
! time Stanford failed to win. San
j ta Clara came up with four runs
in their half of the tenth to stop
; the Indians, 8-4.
Stanford picked up two runs in
j the bottom of the second, but the
j Broncos took the lead in the third
I on first baseman John Boccabel
la’s bases-loaded triple.
THK VISITORS stretched their
lead to 4-2 in the seventh off Stan
-1 fold pitcher Darrell Sutherland
only to have the Indians tie it up
j on single runs in the eighth and
; ninth.
The roof fell in on Stanford in
the tenth. Bronco second base
i man Gary Molvini reached first
j on an error, and Stanford relief
er John Berry wild pitched him
to second. After one was out, Doc
| cabella was intentionally passed
Tim Cullen, the Bronco’s third
I baseman, singled in the winning
j run, although Santa Clara added
j three more for insurance.
THE SECOND GAME was just
i as tight. Stanford went Into a 2-0
1 lead in the first inning on only
| one hit. Second sacker O. P. So
lander drew’ a w’alk; then out
fielder Greg Post laid down a pop
up bunt which Bronco pitcher
John Marcenaro dove for and
booted past the foul stripe.
Following Post’s hit, both run
j ners advanced on Rich Ferraz
zano’s grounder to third base. A
wild pitch brought Solander
home, Post reaching third. Post
then stole home when first base
man Bob Hollman missed a bunt,
wdth the speedy outfielder sliding
j under the catcher’s tag.
Santa Clara tied the game up in
j the third. Ernie Fazio and Bocca
[ hello hit back to back doubles for
j two runs, and only Warren New
ell’s long throw from left field to
nip Boccabella attempting to
| score on a single prevented more
| runs..
THE BRONCOS, aided by Stan-
I ford errors, won the game in the
j seventh. A single, and tw r o errors
j gave them one run ana a second
scored later in the inning on Boc
i cabella’s fielder’s choice grounder.
