# Schlicke, Cal Frosh Set School Marks in NorCal Track Meet
## 
### PETE KING 
Excellent performances by
younger athletes made up for the
failure of several big name track
and field stars to compete in the
Northern California Invitational
Track Meet, held Saturday in
Stanford Stadium.
Two freshmen headed the list
of the afternoon’s best efforts.
Paul Schlicke, Stanford freshman
miler, battled with teammate Har
lan Andrews around the last turn
and finally turned on his usual
finishing kick to win in 4:12.6.
The time w’as a new Stanford
freshman record, only 1.8 seconds
aw’ay from the national frosh
mark.
DAVE ARCHIBALD, flashy Cal
440 runner who is co-holder of
the national freshman record,
sprinted the final leg of the mile
relay in- a sparkling 45.8 to lead
the Bear yearlings to victory over
the Stanford varsity. Cal’s 3:11.8
was a new frosh record and a
mere eight-tenths of a second off
the nation’s best frosh time.
Going into the final lap, the Cal
frosh team and Stanford’s var
sity, the only two competitors,
were virtually even. Card anchor
man Ken Emanuels was forced to
the outside and fell behind Archi
bald in the middle of the back
straightaway. Ken ran a 46.9 leg,
his fastest relay time of the sea
son.
Emanuels won the 440 wdth ease
in 47.6 seconds. Jack Yerman,
Dave Archibald, and Keith
Thomassen, all of whom had run
under 47.2, did not run and kept
the 440 from developing into the
afternoon’s best race.
JERRY SIEBERT of Santa
Clara Valley Youth Village ran
the fastest 880 seen in Stanford
Stadium in two years. Siebert’s
1:48.5 clocking tied Ernie Cun
liffe's previous stadium mark,
which he set in 1960 as a Stanford
runner.
Card pole vaulter Phil White
equalled his Stanford record of
15-12 set six weeks ago. White
easily cleared that height on his
first try, and then missed three
times at 154Va.
Indian discus thrower Don Bell
got off his best flip of the season,
a toss of 171-7. Teammate Dave
Weill heaved the platter 183 feet
to win the event. Jay Silvester,
former world record holder at
199-212, did not show up for the
meet.
THE SPRINTS produced the
most exciting competition. Stan
ford frosh dash man Larry Que
stad was nipped at the wire by
Bob Poynter of SCVYV in the 100-
yard dash. The 220, run around a
curve, was practically a photo
finish, as five runners were with
in a tenth of a second apart. Que
stad breasted the tape in 21.6,
good for third behind Poynter and
the San Jose State frosh whiz,
Dwight Middleton.
Harry McCalla, practicing for
the 5000 meters and the three
mile run, paced himself for those
distances all the way and finished
with the fine time of 9:02.5.
CARD JAVELIN hurler Art
Batchelder sailed the spear 236
feet, but was edged by John
Fromm of SCVYV, who tossed it
239-2 1 2 .
The high jump turned out to be
disappointing. Cal’s Gene John

son, who has cleared seven feet
earlier this year, had to settle for
6-6 1 2 anrl a fie for second place
with frosh teammate Bill Carter.
San Jose’s Vance Barnes, also a
6-10 plus jumper, cleared 6-8 D for
first.
The meet w’as not scored on a
team basis, but the Cards won
five events, SCVYV won four,
San Jose three, and Cal two.

under 47.2, did not run and kept
the 440 from developing into the
afternoon’s best race.
JERRY SIEBERT of Santa
Clara Valley Youth Village ran
the fastest 880 seen in Stanford
Stadium in two years. Siebert’s
1:48.5 clocking tied Ernie Cun
liffe's previous stadium mark,
which he set in 1960 as a Stanford
runner.
Card pole vaulter Phil White
equalled his Stanford record of
15-12 set six weeks ago. White
easily cleared that height on his
first try, and then missed three
times at 154Va.
Indian discus thrower Don Bell
got off his best flip of the season,
a toss of 171-7. Teammate Dave
Weill heaved the platter 183 feet
to win the event. Jay Silvester,
former world record holder at
199-212, did not show up for the
meet.
THE SPRINTS produced the
most exciting competition. Stan
ford frosh dash man Larry Que
stad was nipped at the wire by
Bob Poynter of SCVYV in the 100-
yard dash. The 220, run around a
curve, was practically a photo
finish, as five runners were with
in a tenth of a second apart. Que
stad breasted the tape in 21.6,
good for third behind Poynter and
the San Jose State frosh whiz,
Dwight Middleton.
Harry McCalla, practicing for
the 5000 meters and the three
mile run, paced himself for those
distances all the way and finished
with the fine time of 9:02.5.

Batchelder sailed the spear 236

The high jump turned out to be
disappointing. Cal’s Gene John

son, who has cleared seven feet
earlier this year, had to settle for
6-6 1 2 anrl a fie for second place
with frosh teammate Bill Carter.
San Jose’s Vance Barnes, also a
6-10 plus jumper, cleared 6-8 D for

The meet w’as not scored on a

PHIL WHITE clears 15-½ Saturday in pole vault
Excellent performances by
younger athletes made up for the
failure of several big name track
and field stars to compete in the
Northern California Invitational
Track Meet, held Saturday in
Stanford Stadium.
Two freshmen headed the list
of the afternoon’s best efforts.
Paul Schlicke, Stanford freshman
miler, battled with teammate Har
lan Andrews around the last turn
and finally turned on his usual
finishing kick to win in 4:12.6.
The time w’as a new Stanford
freshman record, only 1.8 seconds
aw’ay from the national frosh
mark.
DAVE ARCHIBALD, flashy Cal
440 runner who is co-holder of
the national freshman record,
sprinted the final leg of the mile
relay in- a sparkling 45.8 to lead
the Bear yearlings to victory over
the Stanford varsity. Cal’s 3:11.8
was a new frosh record and a
mere eight-tenths of a second off
the nation’s best frosh time.
Going into the final lap, the Cal
frosh team and Stanford’s var
sity, the only two competitors,
were virtually even. Card anchor
man Ken Emanuels was forced to
the outside and fell behind Archi
bald in the middle of the back
straightaway. Ken ran a 46.9 leg,
his fastest relay time of the sea
son.
Emanuels won the 440 wdth ease

PHIL WHITE clears 15-½ Saturday in pole vault
Excellent performances by
younger athletes made up for the
failure of several big name track
and field stars to compete in the
Northern California Invitational
Track Meet, held Saturday in
Stanford Stadium.
Two freshmen headed the list
of the afternoon’s best efforts.
Paul Schlicke, Stanford freshman
miler, battled with teammate Har
lan Andrews around the last turn
and finally turned on his usual
finishing kick to win in 4:12.6.
The time w’as a new Stanford
freshman record, only 1.8 seconds
aw’ay from the national frosh
mark.
DAVE ARCHIBALD, flashy Cal
440 runner who is co-holder of
the national freshman record,
sprinted the final leg of the mile
relay in- a sparkling 45.8 to lead
the Bear yearlings to victory over
the Stanford varsity. Cal’s 3:11.8
was a new frosh record and a
mere eight-tenths of a second off
the nation’s best frosh time.
Going into the final lap, the Cal
frosh team and Stanford’s var
sity, the only two competitors,
were virtually even. Card anchor
man Ken Emanuels was forced to
the outside and fell behind Archi
bald in the middle of the back
straightaway. Ken ran a 46.9 leg,
his fastest relay time of the sea
son.
Emanuels won the 440 wdth ease
in 47.6 seconds. Jack Yerman,
Dave Archibald, and Keith
Thomassen, all of whom had run
under 47.2, did not run and kept
the 440 from developing into the
afternoon’s best race.
JERRY SIEBERT of Santa
Clara Valley Youth Village ran
the fastest 880 seen in Stanford
Stadium in two years. Siebert’s
1:48.5 clocking tied Ernie Cun
liffe's previous stadium mark,
which he set in 1960 as a Stanford
runner.
Card pole vaulter Phil White
equalled his Stanford record of
15-12 set six weeks ago. White
easily cleared that height on his
first try, and then missed three
times at 154Va.
Indian discus thrower Don Bell
got off his best flip of the season,
a toss of 171-7. Teammate Dave
Weill heaved the platter 183 feet
to win the event. Jay Silvester,
former world record holder at
199-212, did not show up for the
meet.
THE SPRINTS produced the
most exciting competition. Stan
ford frosh dash man Larry Que
stad was nipped at the wire by
Bob Poynter of SCVYV in the 100-
yard dash. The 220, run around a
curve, was practically a photo
finish, as five runners were with
in a tenth of a second apart. Que
stad breasted the tape in 21.6,
good for third behind Poynter and
the San Jose State frosh whiz,
Dwight Middleton.
Harry McCalla, practicing for

PHIL WHITE clears 15-½ Saturday in pole vault
Excellent performances by
younger athletes made up for the
failure of several big name track
and field stars to compete in the
Northern California Invitational
Track Meet, held Saturday in
Stanford Stadium.
Two freshmen headed the list
of the afternoon’s best efforts.
Paul Schlicke, Stanford freshman
miler, battled with teammate Har
lan Andrews around the last turn
and finally turned on his usual
finishing kick to win in 4:12.6.
The time w’as a new Stanford
freshman record, only 1.8 seconds
aw’ay from the national frosh
mark.
DAVE ARCHIBALD, flashy Cal
440 runner who is co-holder of
the national freshman record,
sprinted the final leg of the mile
relay in- a sparkling 45.8 to lead
the Bear yearlings to victory over
the Stanford varsity. Cal’s 3:11.8
was a new frosh record and a
mere eight-tenths of a second off
the nation’s best frosh time.
Going into the final lap, the Cal
frosh team and Stanford’s var
sity, the only two competitors,
were virtually even. Card anchor
man Ken Emanuels was forced to
the outside and fell behind Archi
bald in the middle of the back
straightaway. Ken ran a 46.9 leg,
his fastest relay time of the sea
son.
Emanuels won the 440 wdth ease
in 47.6 seconds. Jack Yerman,
Dave Archibald, and Keith
Thomassen, all of whom had run
under 47.2, did not run and kept
the 440 from developing into the
afternoon’s best race.
JERRY SIEBERT of Santa
Clara Valley Youth Village ran
the fastest 880 seen in Stanford
Stadium in two years. Siebert’s
1:48.5 clocking tied Ernie Cun
liffe's previous stadium mark,
which he set in 1960 as a Stanford
runner.
Card pole vaulter Phil White
equalled his Stanford record of
15-12 set six weeks ago. White
easily cleared that height on his
first try, and then missed three
times at 154Va.
Indian discus thrower Don Bell
got off his best flip of the season,
a toss of 171-7. Teammate Dave
Weill heaved the platter 183 feet
to win the event. Jay Silvester,
former world record holder at
199-212, did not show up for the
meet.
THE SPRINTS produced the
most exciting competition. Stan
ford frosh dash man Larry Que
stad was nipped at the wire by
Bob Poynter of SCVYV in the 100-
yard dash. The 220, run around a
curve, was practically a photo
finish, as five runners were with
in a tenth of a second apart. Que
stad breasted the tape in 21.6,
good for third behind Poynter and
the San Jose State frosh whiz,
Dwight Middleton.
Harry McCalla, practicing for
the 5000 meters and the three
mile run, paced himself for those
distances all the way and finished
with the fine time of 9:02.5.
CARD JAVELIN hurler Art
Batchelder sailed the spear 236
feet, but was edged by John
Fromm of SCVYV, who tossed it

The high jump turned out to be
disappointing. Cal’s Gene John

son, who has cleared seven feet
earlier this year, had to settle for
6-6 1 2 anrl a fie for second place
with frosh teammate Bill Carter.
San Jose’s Vance Barnes, also a
6-10 plus jumper, cleared 6-8 D for
first.
The meet w’as not scored on a
team basis, but the Cards won
five events, SCVYV won four,
San Jose three, and Cal two.
