# Rheumatic Fever Test Developed
## 
### 
Two Stanford School of Medi
cine scientists have proven for
widespread use a new technique
for identifying the strain of strep
tococcal bacteria which may lead
to rheumatic fever and a serious
kidney condition if not detected
early. In a report presented to
the American Society for Micro
biology, Drs. Helene C. Rauch and
Lowell A. Rant/, stated that the
technique was used on 767 pa
tients and it was found 97 per
cent effective in identifying the
160 patients with enough of the
deadly germs to cause Infection.
The new method, which takes
less than two hours to carry out,
has been used for a decade in
experimental laboratories but had
not been successfully tried before
on large numbers of patients. It
will replace older methods that
take from two to five days.

tion of “strep” throat infection or
scarlet fever, is caused by only
one group of streptococci, known
