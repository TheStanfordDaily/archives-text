# Crisis Due In Africa
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPM This
country’s next foreign crisis is ex
pected to begin in six weeks at
the “Mountains of the Moon.”
The people who will start it will
he the Tutsi and the Tutu and the
Twa, who live in Ruanda-Urundi,
under the Mountains of the Moon,
whore both the Nile and the Con
go rise in Africa.
THE PEOPLE who will worry
will he the State Department and
the United Nations and the Brit
ish and the Belgians. The people
who will shout will be the Rus
sians and some of the neutrals.
The people who may well pay for
a lot of it will be Americans.
U.S. diplomats fear it could be
as messy as the Congo, which is
just next door, and for some of
the same reasons. They urge that
Americans start boning up right
now on how to tell a Tutsi from
a Hutu.
In simplest terms the problem
is that Ruanda-Urundi, a Belgian
territory since World War I, is
due on July 1 to become two in
dependent states, Ruanda and
Burundi.
LIKE THE CONGO, it is no
where near ready fot this. Rival
tribes are on the brink of civil
war. The Belgians, whose forces
now maintain some order, are
under strong pressure to leave. If
this happens it will be up to the
United Nations. But the United
Nations is busy and broke. The
Russians, meanwhile, are in the
background.
