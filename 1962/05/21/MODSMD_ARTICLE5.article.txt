# SU's Symphony Orchestra to Play
## 
### 
Stanford’s Symphony Orchestra
under the direction of Sandor
Salgo will give its quarterly per
formance at 8:30 p.m. Friday in
Dinkelspiel.
The 75-piece musical organiza
tion will play “Overture to Ober
on” by Weber, “Symphony No. 38
in D Major” by Mozart, and
"Symphony No. 5” by Prokofiev.

The orchestra, welded into a
group by Salgo, rehearses two
nights each week throughout the
school year. Only about 15 per
cent of its membership is drawn
from music majors. The rest are
alumni, faculty wives, and stu
dents from many departments.
Tickets for the performance are
on sale at Dinkelspiel and Penin
sula Box Offices.
