An attempt by University of
California students to send an
amicus curiae brief to the Su
premo court of California in the
case of Lcssin vs Regents, argu
ing for presentation of all speak
ers on campus regardless of their
views, was defeated by the Asso
ciated Students of the University
of California Executive Commit
tee. reported The Daily Cal.
The brief argues that “a citizen
does not sacrifice his constitu
tional rights by becoming a Uni
versity student.” The University,
in its brief, argued that it was not
bound by the First and Four
teenth Amendments within cam
pus confines.
The proposed brief stated, “It
is the position of the Associated
Students that questions of our
rights arc not simply matters of
how the University is going to
educate us; there are two other
questions—how are wo going to
educate ourselves, and how are
we going to participate in the na
tion’s democratic process? In the
name of education the University
does not have the right to deny
us our participation in society.”

Alex Sheriffs, Vice-Chancellor
for Student Affairs, said that
since the ASUC exists at the be
hest of the Regents filing of a
brief siding with the Regents’ op
ponents in the suit without first
consulting with the University ad
ministration would have been “ir
responsible action.”
During the discussion of wheth
er to send the brief, several Ex
Com members said that they had
heard of “administrative pres
sures,” but other committee mem
bers said that voting should not
be influenced merely in order to
defy rumored pressures.
The Ex-Com, after two hours
of discussion, decided not to file
the brief by a 10-6 vote.
