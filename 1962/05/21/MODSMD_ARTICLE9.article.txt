# MUSS Stresses IsArgument

### KAY STANFIFLD PAUL RICCI 
The Model U.S. Senate is a recent addition
j to the spectrum of Stanford campus activi
j ties. Under the authority of Political Union, it
} offers a unique forum for the expression of
j student opinion on both national and inter
national issues.
While calling itself a “model” Senate.
MUSS adopts only the basic rules of the U.S.
j Senate, avoiding imitation for imitation’s
[ sake. The emphasis is on issues and argu
| ment. Students represent their own beliefs.
MUSS ALSO MOVKS outside itself on vari
-1 ous occasions. The Senators feted Senator
j Paul Douglas at a private dinner, and have
j heard speeches from several political figures.
1 The first President of the Senate was

I Ralph McElvenncy, who now serves as its
| Chairman. Recently elected were Mike Brady,
president, and Chris Mullick. Chief Clerk.
1 Model Senate debates are relatively infor
mal, with each Senator spending whatever
j amount of time ho thinks is sufficient to
] gather evidence to support his viewpoints.
As a forum of student opinion, the Senate
provides participants a chance to hear other
students’ opinions, to see just how well one
can put across ideas, and if one’s own beliefs
can stand up under fire.
THE TOPICS OF bills before the Senate
j have ranged over much of the political spec-
I trum: cutting off foreign aid to Latin-
American dictatorships, giving medical care
I to the aged, instigating a democratic revo
! lution in the Soviet Union, of applying anti

trust legislation to labor unions, and recog
nizing of Red China. Resolutions passed are
then sent to members of the State and Na
tional Legislatures.
MUSS has its cynics and its visionaries,
its fence-sitters and it filibusters, its moral
ists and its pragmatists. By the end of a de
bate, most shades of political opinion have
been heard and most of the tricks of the par
liamentary trade have been used.
MUSS DEBATES AKE never as complete
as they could be if more time were available,
and they are not quite as crisp or organized
as the debates of the real United Stales Sen
ate. But the spectacle of opinions clashing,
cases being worked out and presented, and
cases being cut up and destroyed never fails
to interest.
