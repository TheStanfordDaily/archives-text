... still a mysterious concept to science. Time is only an idea,
an abstraction .. .an area of shadow, speculation—and surprise.
MAN WAS CREATED AFTER 11:59... if all time since the
earth’s creation were condensed into a 24-hour day, the

Even the dinosaurs wouldn’t appear until 11 p.m.
TIME TO GO ASHORE... for the
grunion, a California fish, is highest
tide of April, May or June. It rides
the surf to the beach, digs a hole,
deposits eggs and sperm. New gener
ations develop without fear of being
washed away until next highest tide,
a full month later.
