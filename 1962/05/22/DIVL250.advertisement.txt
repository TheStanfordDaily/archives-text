TILL WE MEET AGAIN
Tins is the finnl column of my eighth year of writing for tlin
makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and this year, as in every pre
ceding year, when I come to the last column of the season, I
come to a problem.
My contract with the makers of Marlboro calls for me to
write a humor column and, truly, Ido the best I can—all things
considered, I am not, I should explain, a jolly man by nature.
t\by should I be? First of all, I am shorter than everybody.
Second, there are moths in my cashmere jacket. Third, I work
in television.
All the same, when it comes time to write this column, I light
a good Marlboro Cigarette, put aside my trauma, and try with
all the strength in my tiny body to make some jokes. Some
times it works better than others, but on the last column of the
year, it just flatly doesn't work at all.
Even in the very beginning this was true—and that, you will re
call, was eight years ago when I was relatively young and strong
and had not yet developed that nasty knock in my transmission.
Well do I remember sitting down to write the final column of my
first year. Day followed barren day, and not a yock, not a boff,
not a zinger did I produce. I was about to give up humor and
take a job selling mechanical dogs when all of a sudden, in a
blinding flash, I realized why I couldn’t think of any jokes!
I leapt up from my typewriter and ran as fast as my little
fat legs would carry me to the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes,
and I tugged my forelock, and I said, “Sirs, I am well aware
that you have engaged me to write a humor column, but today,
as I approach the final column of the season, I am far too misty
to be funny, for the final column of the season is, after all, a
leave-taking, and when I think of saying goodbye to my audience
—the swellest audience any columnist ever had—the college
students of America—wonderful human beings, every man and

woman of them—wise but kindly—astute but compassionate—
perspicacious but forbearing—when, sirs, I think of saying good
bye to such an audience, I am too shook up even to consider
levity, and so I ask you, sirs, to let me, in the final column of the
year, forego humor and instead write a simple, dignified,
straightforward farewell.’?
Then I took out my bandanna, wiped my eyes, ears, nose, and
throat and waited for a reply from the makers of Marlboro.
They sat around the polished board mom table, the makers,
their handsome brows knit in concentration, puffing thought
fully on the Marlboros in their tattooed hands. At length they
spoke. “Yes,” they said simply.
I never doubted they would say yes. People who make a
cigarette as good as Marlboro must themselves be good. People
who lavish such care on blending tobaccos so mild and flavor
ful, on devising a filter so clean and white, on boxing a flip-top
box so flip-top, on packing a soft pack so soft—people like that
are one hundred percent with me!
And so from that day forward, the final column of the, year
—including the one you are, I devoutly hope, now reading
makes no attempt to be funny, but is instead a simple thank
you and au revoir.
Thank you and au revoir, makers of Marlboro. The memory
of our eight years together will remain ever fresh in my heart,
and I would like to state for all the world to hear that if you
want me back again next year, I shall expect a substantial
raise in salary.
Thank you and au revoir, college students of America. May
good luck attend all your ventures. Stay well. Stay happy.
Stay loose. e le#2 Mlx shuim«»

Small .Max has said it all. We, the makers of Marlboro Ciga
rettes, can only add a heartfelt second chorus: Slay well.
Stay happy. Slay loose.
