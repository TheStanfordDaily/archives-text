# 'Stanford Should Be Cautious in Supporting NSA'
## 
### CHARLES LOFGREN 
The campus activists are restless again.
Their cause celebre this time is joining the
National Student Association. Even next
year’s ASSU President —despite having been
elected on a platform of doing almost noth
ing serious—has endorsed NSA before the
ASSU Legislature. (Maybe NSA isn’t really
very serious.)
The information so far distributed on
NSA has been highly favorable. There are,
however, a number of facts on NSA of which
the student body and LASSU should be
aware.
NSA PURPORTS to speak for the college
and university students of the United States
on a variety of issues. Its preamble reads,
“We, the students of the United States of
America ... do hereby establish the U.S.
National Student Association.” Unfortunately
it is seldom realized that only 17 per cent of
the colleges and universities in the United
States, representing about 25 per cent of the
total students, belong to NSA. Of these
schools, fewer yet are very active in the
organization: only 60 per cent of the member
schools attended NSA’s 1961 National Stu
dent Congress (NSC) in Madison, Wisconsin.

Thus saying that NSA speaks for its
member schools, let alone for U.S. students,
is folly. Even if the student governments of
every American college and university were
affiliated with it, NSA still would not repre
sent the American student hut only the stu
dent governments. And student governments
are notoriously unrepresentative. (LASSU
openly admitted that it wasn’t representative
in the recent debate over the abortive new
ASSU constitution.) Furthermore, student
governments, which generally select school
NSA delegates and personnel, are not chosen
on the basis of the partisan issues (c.g„ urg
ing unilateral disarmament, praising Japa
nese student riots against Eisenhower’s visit,
abolishing HU AC) with which NSA constant
ly concerns itself in the name of the Ameri
can student. The result: to the extent that
NSA is listened to, the voices of the campus
red hots are the ones heard.
In the light of NSA’s poor representation
and especially in consideration of the parti
san programs it endorses, one might expect
NSA to provide for an expression of minority
views (minority, that is, in reference to NSA
itself). Such is not the case. The 1961 NSC
voted not to publish vote tallies or minority

reports and not to give to NSA members the
minutes of the Congress or of the meetings
of the National Executive Committee (NEC).

THK NEC, composed of 35 regional rep
resentatives, does a major portion of NSA’s
work. The 1961 NSC voted upon only 13 of
the 97 bills before it, the rest being left for
NEC consideration after adjournment. For
the 1961 NSC, the figure was 40 out of 104.
Bills passed by the NEC are accorded the
same weight as NSA policy as those passed
by the NSC. The NEC controls the agenda
of NSC sessions and therefore determines
voting priority. NEC also has passed items
which the NSC has never considered or re
ferred to it, but which again become equally
as much NSA policy. Considering that the
regional representation on the NEC is no
where near proportional, all this should
cause some serious thought on the merits of
joining NSA to make Stanford student opin
ion heard.
Much of NSA’s problem results from an
undue emphasis on national and interna
tional affairs instead of on student problems
(where it might do some good). Working
papers of the 1961 National Student Con
gress devoted 5 times as much space to the

former as to the latter. An analysis of the
resolutions passed by NSC and NEC in the
national-international area shows that these
resolutions generally reflect the opinions of
NSA’s permanent, non-student staff, which
compiles the background reports on issues
before NSC. (This staff also maintains NSA’s
permanent lobby in Washington, again gen
erally stating its ideas as being NSA policy.)
Anyone interested in a further and more
detailed analysis of NSA’s structure, repre
sentation, and activities should consult the
relevant chapters in M. Stanton Evans’ re
cent book Revolt on the Campus. (A leading
Stanford NSA advocate has said that if
Evans’ remarks were publicized, NSA would
be dead at Stanford.)
FROM STANFORD'S standpoint, the
$lOOO to $l5OO a year which active member
ship entails (for membership and delegate
fees and traveling expenses) should not be
dismissed as lightly as Steve Corker has at
tempted to do. Anyone as familiar with
ASSU budgeting procedure as Corker is
should know that this money could be ob
tained only by making substantial cuts in
other ASSU programs.
Finally there is the argument which ad

mils NSA’s weaknesses but proposes that if
Stanford were in the organization, it could
help remedy these, A number of Eastern
and Midwestern schools have been unsuccess
fully trying to do this for some time. Then
lack of success is reflected in the facts that
in the past year the Universities of Missouri,
Oklahoma and Kansas, Northwestern Uni
versity, and Kansas State have withdrawn
from NSA, that American and George Wash
ington Universities have defeated moves to
join, and that strong withdrawal movements
are in progress at the Universities of Illinois
and Ohio.
Northwestern University, which withdrew
just this month (May 10th) after a student
referendum, did so in the face of arguments
similar to those advanced for Stanford’s
joining. Regarding such arguments, Dave
Ebel, active in NSA affairs at Northwestern,
commented, “We are not quitters if we are
clubbed on the head, robbed of $l2OO and
laughed at. If we stay in and allow this to
happen, we are . . . fools.” Stanford stu
dents might well take note, before they de
cide to lend Stanford’s prestige to an organi
zation in which they will have no effective
voice.
