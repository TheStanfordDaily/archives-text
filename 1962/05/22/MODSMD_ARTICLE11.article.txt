# LASSU Hits University on Forum Ruling
## 
### TON COLEMAN 
At its meeting last week,
LASSU adopted a resolution “ex
pressing its profound disappoint
ment” that the administration, in
ruling on the conduct of the For
um for the Discussion of Non-
Violent Alternatives to War, had
“overruled the Legislature’s de
cisions and responsibility” in
dealing with allegedly partisan
campus organizations.
The resolution came in re
sponse to a report by Forum
Chairman Dan Cohen that the
Administration had refused his
group permission for the debate
“Nuclear Testing: Does It De
crease or Increase the Chances
for Nuclear War?”
THE ADMINISTRATION has
denied us an open meeting, and
will allow us to act only under
Poli Union,” Cohen stated. “We
will do so, but we are sorry to
see student responsibility taken
away in a traditionally student
area,” he concluded.
Addressed to President Ster
ling, the resolution stated that
LASSU has the “primary respon
sibility for the creation, dissolu
tion, and conduct of student or
ganizations.”
IT WENT ON to say that
LASSU “has exercised such re
sponsibility in the creation of
Forum and has further assumed
the responsibility for enforcing
both the provisions of the consti
tution of that group and the pro
visions of the ASSU Constitution
that pertains to student organiza
tions.”
“The University administration
has vetoed Forum’s presentation
of programs when had been pre
viously approved by the ASSU
President, acting as agent” for
LASSU. it continued.
IT WAS ALSO stated in the
resolution that the “University
administration has given as its
reasons for its actions that: <1)
The Forum is partisan and, as
such, cannot conduct open meet
ings on the campus, and (2) The
activities of the Forum will in
fringe on the activities of the Po
litical Union.”
In concluding the reasons for
expressing LASSU's “disappoint
ment” over the administration’s
ruling, the resolution stated:
LASSU “believes that it has the
competence to rule on whether or
not the programs presented by a
student group are partisan and
further believes that it has the
competence to detei’mine whether
or not any student group is in
fringing on the activities of any
other student group.”
