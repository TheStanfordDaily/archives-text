# What's Next With The Liquor Change?
## 
### 
It is understandable that both the initiators of the liquor peti
tion and the student body at large are upset with the recent
decision of the Board of Trustees to table the proposed liquor
policy. However, the petition is not dead, and it should not be
considered in that light until it is.

The Trustees tabled thV proposal because of a lack of informa
tion. It is difficult to understand how this happened with the
amount that has been disseminated and the time that has been
spent studying the question in University committees.
Nonetheless it is now up to the students to keep the liquor
issue alive and to continue to act in the same responsible manner
as they are at the present time.
