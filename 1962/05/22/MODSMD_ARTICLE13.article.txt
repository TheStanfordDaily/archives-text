# WERT IN CHARGE
## Undergrad Education Group Studies Variety of Subjects

(Editor's Note: Tliis is the first
of a three-part series on the Pres
ident’s special Committee on Un
dergraduate Education.)
When the University realized
that it was “trembling on the
edge of greatness” at the begin
ning of this year, President Wal
lace Sterling decided to appoint
and chair a special Committee on
Undergraduate Education.
The charge of the 25-man group
of administrators and faculty
members is to appraise the en
tire undergraduate program,
from curriculum to residences
and student government—that is,
everything in the University that
impinges on the life of its under
graduates.

THE CHARACTER of Stanford
has changed a great deal in the
last 15 years, according to Vice
Provost Robert J. Wert, who is
handling the Committee for the
President. Attitudes and aspira
tions of both students and faculty
are shifting markedly. Admis
sions measurements indicate that
the University is a great deal
more selective now than it was
five years ago. College Board av
erages are up, and so are other
measurements. The Committee's
mandate is to evaluate this
chang® in character and to deter
mine Aiow to make the most of it.
An Appraisal of the undergrad
uate program is customary at
regular intervals, Wert said. The
last sturdy resulted in the present
General NStudies program, now in
effect abvut five years. This is
the same Jkind of appraisal.
The Conymittee is attempting
to analyze (the University’s rela
tive emphasis on undergraduate
and graduate education and to
examine theVlension of the rela
tionship. Both\ should improve at
about the sa/ue pace, according
to Wert. “Cojastant healthy com
petition” betiween the graduate
and undergraduate units of the
University Its desirable, Wert said.
Those wfho excel in the teach
ing of yyfidergraduates should be
teachiyhg them, Wort said. The
Com*rnit(ee will attempt to find
flue most exciting program pos
sible with available resources.
THE COMMITTEE has had a
slow evolution. Its first meetings
in the fall were largely a conver
sational attempt to determine ex
actly what questions on under
graduate education needed study.

The group has a horizontal struc
ture, with all schools and depart
ments represented. Most of the
work will be done in subcommit
tees.
Because the General Studies
Committee is a stable group (it
has been in operation about five
years), it was asked to do the ap
praisal of the present General
Studies program, Wert said. They
will report to the larger Commit
tee.
Two other subcommittees have
been appointed and have begun to
work. Ralph J. Smith of electrical
engineering heads the subcommit
tee on housing, which will pro
vide the overall concept which
will act as the basis for future
residence plans. The hope is that
a residence policy will be ready
to go to the Board of Trustees by
the end of the academic year.
Philip H. Rhinelander is chair
ing the subcommittee on the ap
praisal of effective teaching,
which will look for a method for
measuring good teaching, that is,
for establishing criteria of good
teaching and methods for getting
evidence of it.
THE ONLY OTHER subcom
mittee now to be appointed is the
executive committee, w’hich will
be responsible for the large Com
mittee’s procedure in conducting
the study. It will have the “initial
responsibility,” according to Wert.
With its selection, which will
probably take place sometime
this quarter, the full committee,
which now meets once a month,
will probably meet less fre
quently.
Some recommendations of the
full Committee will require ap
proval of the Academic Council,
and some will go directly to the
Board. The Committee will prob
ably work for at least another
full year.
According to Wert, the fact
that the President of the Univer
sity is chairing this Committee is
important. It is a demonstration
both actually and symbolically of
the University’s interest in the
undergraduate departments, Wert
said.
The Committee is making peri
odic reports to the Board of Trus
tees, which, Wert said, is also ex
tremely interested in the project.
