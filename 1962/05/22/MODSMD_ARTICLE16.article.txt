UNDERSTAND?
Editor, The Daily:
Friday’s editorial stated that I
did not fully understand Dr. Le
vin’s letter concerning the Sigma
Nu membership qualifications,
and that I did not answer some
of the questions raised by that
letter. Leaving aside the issue of
my own comprehension of simple
English prose, I would like to
question whether The Daily’s own
restatement of Dr. Levin’s posi
tion is itself coherent.
ITS POINT seems to be that
Sigma Nu should be in some
sense quarantined by the academ
ic community until our discrimi
natory clause no longer exists.
This is to be done really for our
own good; it will “make the right
choice easy” for us; it can even
be construed as “active support.”

And yet we have already made
a choice, though it has been by
no means an easy process. In a
long year full of late, heated
meetings, of consultations with
administrators and alumni, of mi
nor but tense skirmishes with our
central office, we have arrived at
a policy of remaining in the na
tional fraternity through this
summer’s convention in the hope
that we can help eliminate the
discriminatory clause for 129
other Sigma Nu chapter.
THE STRANGE thing is that
no one has yet said that this is
not the “right” choice; The Daily
seems to think that it is. Yet they
argue that while we are in the
course of carrying out this policy,
the academic community can best
help us by refusing social invita
tions to our house.
I can suggest several more
practical kinds of aid. About 20 of
us just spent a sunny Saturday
morning typing and addressing
letters to other western chapters
of Sigma Nu. We welcome any
one who would like to help us lick
the envelopes during the coming
week.
We would be glad to accept con
tributions to help cover the cost
of stationery, stamps, long dis
tance phone calls, and the ex
penses of sending delegates to
Pittsburgh this summer—all of
which we are now paying out of
our own pockets.
A whole list of further sugges
tions for campus liberals who
would like to rise above the
“first” or “verbal” plateau in
their fight against disdrimina
tion is available upon request at
the Sigma Nu house.
