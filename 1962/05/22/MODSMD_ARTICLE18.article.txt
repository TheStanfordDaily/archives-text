# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION
## 
### Ken Dery 
With the signing of Jerry Lucas to a professional basketball con
tract, the ranks of the phenomenal amateurs has again been reduced
to zero.
No matter how strong are the amateur’s reasons for wanting
to remain out of today’s world of the tough physical and mental
beating, the long and sporadic traveling schedules, and the constant
invasion of privacy by the press in the end he must turn pro in
light of the startling inducements offered him.
LUCAS, THU three-time all-America from Chico State, has been
an American idol for both his court conduct and his mannerly per
sonal life. He is one of the top men in the department of finance at
Ohio State.
Big Jerry, bothered for years by a weak pair of ankles and a

lack of privacy since over 150 col
leges started bidding for his serv
ices more than six years ago,
stated firmly that he would not I
play professional basketball. He '
didn't find the gypsy-life roman
tic and he wanted to go to gradu
ate school to further his educa
(ion.
But even a man with Lucas’s
multifarious talents and opportu
nities outside of the sport could
not turn down the offers which j
the men behind the walnut desks j
dreamed up for him.
The offer Lucas flatly rejected 1
came from the Cincinnati Royals
of the National Basketball Associ-|
ation. They offered the 6-9 giantt
a $lOO,OOO three-year pact. I
THU OFFER which finallyL
made Lucas change his mindl
came from George Steinbrennerß
of the Cleveland Pipers of thel

American Basketball League. Sleinbrenner used an approach which
was high class, an approach which was geared to reach the highly
intelligent and well disciplined mind of Jerry Lucas.
The Pipers boss brought out attendance projections if Lucas
were to join the Cleveland team, last year's balance sheets (last
season w r as the first for the new league and the majority of the
teams lost money; the Pipers lost $170,0001 and a contract which
could be compared to a proud father’s setting up of a trust fund for
his son.

A Contract or a Trust Fund?
Lucas was only obligated to play for two seasons. The league
schedule was not to be extended to the length of the rival league
slate, enabling Lucas to finish up his undergraduate schooling fall i
quarter. There would be a salary of $lO,OOO per year, an investment
portfolio of common stocks whose present value is $40,000, and the
Pipers agreed to pay for a graduate education at. the school of
Jerry’s choice when he decided to go.
WHO COULD PASS up an offer like that one? Actually one can
see that the Pipers swayed Lucas not by cash alone, but in the way
they dealt with him, for the Royals offered him more money.
But it appears that the Rayols management didn’t deal with
Lucas on a high enough level. When Lucas came to Cleveland for a
second talk with the Pipers’ top brass he brought his wife along.
Although Jerry hadn’t committed himself the Pipers took his wife
around to show her some nice apartments they thought she mighl
like. They were not just putting money on the line. They were taking
an intelligent, active interest in the things which might help to sway j
a public figure who had openly declared that he would not do some
thing. And this takes some doing.
They talked education to a bright boy, they made sure the com- j
mon stock portfolio contained companies which Lucas knew and ;
companies which w’ere interested in Jerry when he got through |

playing basketball, they tried to
spread out his income so as to
avoid the steeply progressive per
sonal income tax rates.
IQ Tesf
THE LUCAS story and package
deal is but one of many. The
Cleveland Browns giving half
hack Ernie Davis IQ and prefer
ence tests to be in a better posi
tion to find him an off season job
which would later become his vo
cation, is another example.
Perhaps the sharpest example
of resistance to turning profes
sional before Lucas was that of
his schoolmate golfer Jack Nick
laus. Nicklaus had finished sec
ond and third in the two previous
National Open championships and
was being groomed as the next
Bobby Jones.
AND YOUNG Jack did not
want to turn pro. His dad owned
a couple of pharmacies in Colum
bus and Jack was either going to
go into pharmacy or insurance.
But when the high finance an
alyst showed the tow-headed
Nicklaus that he could make
$lOO,OOO in salaries, purses, en
dorsements and personal appear
ances his first year on the pro
fessional tour, he forgot about
being Bobby Jones. He had a wife
and child to support and being
another Arnold Palmer wasn't
really that bad.
It must be tough having a fax
problem at the age of 22.
