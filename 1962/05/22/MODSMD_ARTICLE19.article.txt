# SU TEAM PLACES SECOND
## Choate Medalist in AAWU Golf 
### 
Stanford golfing ace Pete
Choate won medalist, honors at
the AAWU golf tournament held
last weekend at USC, but the
Stanford team placed second to
the fast-finishing Trojans.
Choate shot a six-over-par 290,
to win while Stanford was 16
strokes behind USC, at 1209 for
the six-man team.
STANFORD WAS handicapped
in the match by Ralph Marron’s
back injury. Marron, a top player
all year for Stanford, lasted the
entire match in a steel brace and
was in great pain throughout the
tourney. Marron fired an 82 the
first round, but managed a 74 and
a pair of 75’s over the last 54
holes, excellent golf all things
considered.
USC was playing on their home
course, and this helped them con
siderably, though Stanford had
beaten them 30-24 earlier in the
season.
However, the Trojans were
primed and made up a three
stroke team deficit at the half
way mark of the tourney to win
going away. The win can’t be
called an upset, though Stanford
had edged (he Trojans before,
since the match was being held
in Trojan territory.
HAD THU MATCH been held
on the Stanford home course, the
outcome might have been a dif
ferent story.
Choate was in command of the
individual competition all the
way. He shot a par 71 on the first
round for a two-stroke lead over
SC’s Ron Rhoades and kept wid
ening it with a second round 71
and a third round 72.
Into the final round ho was one
over par, and when he soared to

a five over 76 on the last day it
didn’t matter as Rhoades went
him one better and shot six over
par golf.
HOWEVER, after Choate there
was a big drop off in scoring. The
next high Stanford scorers were
Bill Sechrest and Marron, tied

sixteen strokes behind Choate at
306. Behind them were Jeff John
son, 307, Bill Farish, 308, and
Jerry Hanweck, 313.
