# Supreme Court Rules No Contempt Charges
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPl)—The Supreme Court overturned yes
terday the contempt convictions of six witnesses who balked at
answering questions at congressional investigations of commu
nism. The indictments were ruled faulty.
in a majority opinion, Justice Potter Stewart held that grand

jury indictments in contempt of
Congress cases must spell out the
subject being investigated when
the witness is questioned. Stewart
said in each of yesterday's cases,
the grand jury failed to do this.
IN RECENT cases, the court
has declared congressional com
mittees must make plain the pur
pose of their investigations. But
yesterday’s rulings for the first
time applied this doctrine to
grand jury indictments.
Justices Tom C. Clark and John
M. Harlan dissented in all six of
the decisions. Five of the rever
sals wore ordered by a 5-2 vote
with justices Felix Frankfurter
and Byron R. White not partici
pating. The other was decided
4-2 as Justice William Brennan
joined Frankfurter and White as
a non-participant.
Stewart stressed the centuries
old common law requirement that
a person accused of a crime by
a grand jury must know the
specifics of the offense.
HE SAID: “The vice which in
heres in the failure of an indict
ment to identify the subject mat
ter under inquiry is . . . the vi
olation of the basic principle ‘that,
the accused must be apprised by
the indictment with reasonable
certainty, of the nature of the
accusation against.
None of the six who won on
appeal yesterday used the Fifth
Amendment claim of possible
self-incrimination in refusing to
answer questions when they were
called is witnesses.
The six are Norton Anthony
Russell, a Yellow Springs, Ohio,
engineer; Robert Shelton, copy
editor- of the New York Times;
Aldcn Whitman, copy editor of
the New York Times; Herman
Liverighl, program director of
TV station WDSU, New Orleans;
William A. Price, former New
York Daily News reporter, and
John T. Gojack, a Columbus,
Ohio, trade unionist.

WASHINGTON (UPl)—The Supreme Court overturned yes
terday the contempt convictions of six witnesses who balked at
answering questions at congressional investigations of commu
nism. The indictments were ruled faulty.
in a majority opinion, Justice Potter Stewart held that grand

jury indictments in contempt of
Congress cases must spell out the
subject being investigated when
the witness is questioned. Stewart
said in each of yesterday's cases,
the grand jury failed to do this.
IN RECENT cases, the court
has declared congressional com
mittees must make plain the pur
pose of their investigations. But
yesterday’s rulings for the first
time applied this doctrine to
grand jury indictments.
Justices Tom C. Clark and John
M. Harlan dissented in all six of
the decisions. Five of the rever
sals wore ordered by a 5-2 vote
with justices Felix Frankfurter
and Byron R. White not partici
pating. The other was decided
4-2 as Justice William Brennan
joined Frankfurter and White as
a non-participant.
Stewart stressed the centuries
old common law requirement that
a person accused of a crime by
a grand jury must know the
specifics of the offense.
HE SAID: “The vice which in
heres in the failure of an indict
ment to identify the subject mat
ter under inquiry is . . . the vi
olation of the basic principle ‘that,
the accused must be apprised by
the indictment with reasonable
certainty, of the nature of the
accusation against.
