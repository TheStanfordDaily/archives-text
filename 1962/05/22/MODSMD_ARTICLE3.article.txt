## 
### 
NEW YORK (UPD—The Amer
ican Medical Association IAMAI
pushed a strong counterattack
against President Kennedy’s med
ical care for the aged plan last
night, denouncing it as “a cruel
roax and a delusion” that would
“heartlessly ignore millions who
need coverage.”
The AMA reply to Kennedy's
Sunday medicare rally address
was televised to a nationwide au
dience (NBC —B p.m. EDT), from
a tape made in Madison Square
Garden shortly after Kennedy’s
espousal there of his aged care
plan.
I)K. EDWARD R. Annis, a Mi
ami surgeon and chairman of the
AMA National Speakers Bureau
and other officials of the nation
wide doctors group made then
reply amid the litter of discarded
placards and balloons bearing
slogans in favor of the King-An
derson medical care through the
Social Security plan.
Annis said the AMA was abso
lutely opposed to the King-An
derson bill now before Congress
for these reasons:
• It would wastefully cover
millions who do not need it.
• “It would heartlessly ignore
millions who need coverage.”
• IT WOULD NOT be true in
surance as its sponsors claim.
• It would create an enormous
and unpredictable burden on
every working taxpayer.
• Its benefits would be limited
and it would “undercut and de
stroy” private, voluntary health
insurance.
• The bill would “serve as the
forerunner of a different system
of medicine for all Americans.”
