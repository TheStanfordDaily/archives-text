# 1962 QUAD:
## Memento Value OK, Edit Quality Lacking 
### GREGG HOPKINS Contributing Editor 
The 1962 Stanford Quad is as always a book of value and in
terest to those whose faces and activities are in it. The 1962 Quad
does not measure up to previous years in layout, photography,
planning or general editorial quality.
Quads will be distributed today between 9 and 5 o’clock at

the Quad Shack. Addtional Quads- 1
are on sale there tor $B.
The Quad’s oceanic cover de
sign, though not highly original,
symbolizes the University’s world
wide scope, as do the division
page sketches of scenes connect
ed with various campi. Unfortun
ately the sketches and theme
drawings lack consistency; the
media,styles and subject matter
vary too much to be effective.
TOO MANY pages arc wasted
on poor, inappropriate snapshots
accompanied by banal, grandilo
quently incongruous statements.
The wasted pages could have

better been devoted to coverage
of more of Stanford’s distinguish
ed faculty; only nine receive the
coverage many more deserve.
Sports coverage should be ex
panded. Track and baseball are
again slighted, and intramurals
are inaccurately and incompletely
covered.
THE QUEENS suffer. These
real Stanford beauties are worth
a full page each, plus intelligent,
artistic photography and posing
which they don’t all receive.
Football and basketball action
pictures arc good. The senior
color photos are well handled, as
are the multitudinous residences
mugs.
A handsome picture of Presi
dent and Mrs. Wallace Sterling
in their garden is a lovely opener
to the administration section and
i an appropriate tribute. Effective
: division page shot of Commence
. ment and a summer watermelon
- feed are photo highlights of the
book. The Highlights of the Year
section has topical, appropriate
• copy and photos.
, The Quad staff has produced a
. pleasant, adequate memento of
i (ho year, but not a particularly
; well planned, well laid-out or ar
■ tistically consistent and attractive
effort.
