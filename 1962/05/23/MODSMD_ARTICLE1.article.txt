# 'NSA Program Offers Stanford Valuable Experience'

### NANCY SHERWOOD 
The world student community is divided
along political lines, Communist, neutralist
and Western. Each of the three is represent
ed internationally by student movements:
The World Federation of Democratic Youth
(WFDY) and the International Union of Stu
dents (lUS) in the Communist camp; the
Coordinating Secretariat of the International
Student Congress (COSEC) in the neutralist;
and the World Assembly of Youth (WAY) in
the Western.
COSEC IS considered a neutralist stu
dent organization because it does not take
stands on political issues. All of these groups
are extremely active in Asia, Africa and
Latin America. They sponsor conferences,
seminars and festivals; exchange delega
tions with different student and youth
groups, give money to build schools, health
clinics and for scholarships; and publish

port those groups with which we are in
huge quantities of propaganda and informa
tion (magazines, buletins, etc.}. And this is
only a partial list.
Realistically speaking, what is being done
must be considered in light of the political
situation of the world today. Students in
many areas of Asia, Africa and Latin Ameri
ca have a much greater voice in control of
the affairs of their Universities and their
nations than do students in Western Europe
and the United States. One need only point
to the effects of student riots in Latin
America, be it forcing a Dean to resign or a
government to fall; to the effect of student
action on Eisenhower’s proposed visit to
Japan; to the governments which were over
thrown in Turkey and Korea, greatly as a
result of student initiated action. The inter
national youth organizations are vying for
the support of and influence on youth in

Asia, Africa and Latin America. Let us sup
basic agreement.
NSA IS A MEMBER of COSEC and the
Young Adult Council (YAC), a coordinating
agency for most national (US) student or
ganizations and a member of WAY. There
fore, through NSA we could be helping and
supporting both the neutralist, or non-politi
cal, and Western youth organizations. An ex
ample of what these groups do should help
to point out their value. COSEC, in coopera
tion with UNESCO, is sponsoring a large
scale campaign against illiteracy in Bolivia.
It began as a pilot project, which, if success
ful, would be extended all over Latin
America.
NSA has been very active along this
same line, supporting both its own and inter
natoinal cooperative projects. It was the
first student union in the world to come out
in favor of Algerian independence. After this

action, it proceeded to set up a scholarship
program for Algerian students.
LEST NSA SEEM simply a one-way road,
let us realize that NSA also has something
to offer the Stanford campus. It has a wealth
of experience in dealing with student prob
lems. For example, our foreign student pro
gram might easily be enriched and improved
as a result of working with an NSA co-ordi
nator who is familiar with the problem and
attempts to solve it as it exists on campuses
all over the country. The same thing applies
to many problems faced on our campus. Why
attempt to go-it-alone, to make mistakes
that others have already made, when there
is an organization that can offer us experi
ence in dealing with these problems, advice,
information and personal help?
If we as Stanford students are interested
in having our voice heard, both nationally
and internationally, the only effective way

is through NSA. For it is this organization
that is called on to speak for American stu
dents, be it at a National Deans Conference
or on international youth meeting. NSA is
recognized abroad as the National Student
Union of the United States, speaking and
acting for the students of the United States.
Granted, it does not represent all students,
but it is the only organization that can speak
for any number of American students and it
is looked to, both nationally and international
ly to do so, whether we as Stanford students
like it or not. If we wish to have a part in
determining the policies and programs of
this organization which does speak for
American students; if we wish to work to
support those things in which wo believe; if
we wish to take our place in the international
community or students—then let us choose
the most effective way of doing these things,

as a result of working with an NSA co-ordi
nator who is familiar with the problem and
attempts to solve it as it exists on campuses
all over the country. The same thing applies
to many problems faced on our campus. Why
attempt to go-it-alone, to make mistakes
that others have already made, when there
is an organization that can offer us experi
ence in dealing with these problems, advice,
information and personal help?
If we as Stanford students are interested
in having our voice heard, both nationally
and internationally, the only effective way

is through NSA. For it is this organization
that is called on to speak for American stu
dents, be it at a National Deans Conference
or on international youth meeting. NSA is
recognized abroad as the National Student
Union of the United States, speaking and
acting for the students of the United States.
Granted, it does not represent all students,
but it is the only organization that can speak
for any number of American students and it
is looked to, both nationally and international
ly to do so, whether we as Stanford students
like it or not. If we wish to have a part in
determining the policies and programs of
this organization which does speak for
American students; if we wish to work to
support those things in which wo believe; if
we wish to take our place in the international
community or students—then let us choose
the most effective way of doing these things,
by joining NSA.
The world student community is divided
along political lines, Communist, neutralist
and Western. Each of the three is represent
ed internationally by student movements:
The World Federation of Democratic Youth
(WFDY) and the International Union of Stu
dents (lUS) in the Communist camp; the
Coordinating Secretariat of the International
Student Congress (COSEC) in the neutralist;
and the World Assembly of Youth (WAY) in
the Western.
COSEC IS considered a neutralist stu
dent organization because it does not take
stands on political issues. All of these groups
are extremely active in Asia, Africa and
Latin America. They sponsor conferences,
seminars and festivals; exchange delega
tions with different student and youth
groups, give money to build schools, health
clinics and for scholarships; and publish

port those groups with which we are in
huge quantities of propaganda and informa
tion (magazines, buletins, etc.}. And this is
only a partial list.
Realistically speaking, what is being done
must be considered in light of the political
situation of the world today. Students in
many areas of Asia, Africa and Latin Ameri
ca have a much greater voice in control of
the affairs of their Universities and their
nations than do students in Western Europe
and the United States. One need only point
to the effects of student riots in Latin
America, be it forcing a Dean to resign or a
government to fall; to the effect of student
action on Eisenhower’s proposed visit to
Japan; to the governments which were over
thrown in Turkey and Korea, greatly as a
result of student initiated action. The inter
national youth organizations are vying for
the support of and influence on youth in

Asia, Africa and Latin America. Let us sup
basic agreement.
NSA IS A MEMBER of COSEC and the
Young Adult Council (YAC), a coordinating
agency for most national (US) student or
ganizations and a member of WAY. There
fore, through NSA we could be helping and
supporting both the neutralist, or non-politi
cal, and Western youth organizations. An ex
ample of what these groups do should help
to point out their value. COSEC, in coopera
tion with UNESCO, is sponsoring a large
scale campaign against illiteracy in Bolivia.
It began as a pilot project, which, if success
ful, would be extended all over Latin
America.
NSA has been very active along this
same line, supporting both its own and inter
natoinal cooperative projects. It was the
first student union in the world to come out
in favor of Algerian independence. After this

action, it proceeded to set up a scholarship
program for Algerian students.
LEST NSA SEEM simply a one-way road,
let us realize that NSA also has something
to offer the Stanford campus. It has a wealth
of experience in dealing with student prob
lems. For example, our foreign student pro

Japan; to the governments which were over
thrown in Turkey and Korea, greatly as a
result of student initiated action. The inter
national youth organizations are vying for
the support of and influence on youth in

Asia, Africa and Latin America. Let us sup
basic agreement.
NSA IS A MEMBER of COSEC and the
Young Adult Council (YAC), a coordinating
agency for most national (US) student or
ganizations and a member of WAY. There
fore, through NSA we could be helping and
supporting both the neutralist, or non-politi
cal, and Western youth organizations. An ex
ample of what these groups do should help
to point out their value. COSEC, in coopera
tion with UNESCO, is sponsoring a large
scale campaign against illiteracy in Bolivia.
It began as a pilot project, which, if success
ful, would be extended all over Latin
America.
NSA has been very active along this
same line, supporting both its own and inter
natoinal cooperative projects. It was the
first student union in the world to come out
in favor of Algerian independence. After this

action, it proceeded to set up a scholarship
program for Algerian students.
LEST NSA SEEM simply a one-way road,
let us realize that NSA also has something
to offer the Stanford campus. It has a wealth
of experience in dealing with student prob
lems. For example, our foreign student pro
gram might easily be enriched and improved
as a result of working with an NSA co-ordi
nator who is familiar with the problem and
attempts to solve it as it exists on campuses
all over the country. The same thing applies
to many problems faced on our campus. Why
attempt to go-it-alone, to make mistakes
that others have already made, when there
is an organization that can offer us experi
ence in dealing with these problems, advice,
information and personal help?
If we as Stanford students are interested
in having our voice heard, both nationally
and internationally, the only effective way

is through NSA. For it is this organization
that is called on to speak for American stu
dents, be it at a National Deans Conference
or on international youth meeting. NSA is
recognized abroad as the National Student
Union of the United States, speaking and
acting for the students of the United States.
Granted, it does not represent all students,
but it is the only organization that can speak
for any number of American students and it
is looked to, both nationally and international
ly to do so, whether we as Stanford students
like it or not. If we wish to have a part in
determining the policies and programs of
this organization which does speak for
American students; if we wish to work to
support those things in which wo believe; if
we wish to take our place in the international
community or students—then let us choose
the most effective way of doing these things,
by joining NSA.
The world student community is divided
along political lines, Communist, neutralist
and Western. Each of the three is represent
ed internationally by student movements:
The World Federation of Democratic Youth
(WFDY) and the International Union of Stu
dents (lUS) in the Communist camp; the
Coordinating Secretariat of the International
Student Congress (COSEC) in the neutralist;
and the World Assembly of Youth (WAY) in
the Western.
COSEC IS considered a neutralist stu
dent organization because it does not take
stands on political issues. All of these groups
are extremely active in Asia, Africa and
Latin America. They sponsor conferences,
seminars and festivals; exchange delega
tions with different student and youth
groups, give money to build schools, health
clinics and for scholarships; and publish

port those groups with which we are in
huge quantities of propaganda and informa
tion (magazines, buletins, etc.}. And this is
only a partial list.
Realistically speaking, what is being done
must be considered in light of the political
situation of the world today. Students in
many areas of Asia, Africa and Latin Ameri
ca have a much greater voice in control of
the affairs of their Universities and their
nations than do students in Western Europe
and the United States. One need only point
to the effects of student riots in Latin
America, be it forcing a Dean to resign or a
government to fall; to the effect of student
action on Eisenhower’s proposed visit to
Japan; to the governments which were over
thrown in Turkey and Korea, greatly as a
result of student initiated action. The inter
national youth organizations are vying for
the support of and influence on youth in

Asia, Africa and Latin America. Let us sup
