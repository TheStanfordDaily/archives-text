# Unfinished Report Basis Of Subcommittee Study
## 
### 
(Editor’s Note: This is the see- i
oncl article of a Ihrcc-part series |
on the President’s special C'om
inittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion.)
Ralph J. Smith and the subcom
mittee on housing of the Presi
dent’s Committee on Undergradu
ate Education were left a rough
draft report of the old Alexander j
Miller committee on housing as a
starting point for their current I
study of the University residence j
program.
The report, the result of two
years of study by eight members |
of the faculty and administration, |
was supposed to be the definitive
University statement on housing; |
but when Alexander Miller died in i
the spring of 1960, it was left tin- !
finished. U. Donald Winbigler
took over as head until summer
of that year, but when the report
was “nearly complete,” the com
mittee stopped meeting. No one
knows exactly why.
SMITH, WHO used to be head j
of the San Jose City Planning
Commission, is using the report I
along with last quarter’s report
by Legislature’s special commit
tee on housing, the Stern house
president’s committee report on
Stern, their own faculty associ
ate contacts, and all of The Daily
articles anti letters on housing to
“get the feel” of campus opinion
on housing.
The Committee itself is an ad- |
ditional source of information,
Smith says.
Sanford Dornbusch. assistant
dean of humanities and sciences
and head of the sociology depart
ment, contributes his knowledge
as a sociologist and as a keen ob
server of student attitudes. Eric
Hutchinson, chemistry depart
ment chairman, is, according to i
Smith, a well-liked teacher with!

i a long record of interest in stu
j dent activities. He is head of the
j Student Affairs and Services
Committee. Robert Compton of
| geology is a faculty associate at
Stern and an expert in matters of
cost and construction.
THE SUBCOMMITTEE also has
a study on faculty associates and
faculty residents, a survey of con
| struction and operating costs
! made by the University business
j office, and the Educational Facil
j ities Laboratory report made by
I I lie Ford Foundation, “College
j Students Live Here,” on methods,
j costs, facilities and architecture
lof student housing across the
country.
I “A factor in the University
I housing policy which has not yet
been adequately taken into ac
count is the factor of cost of con
struction and operation of stu
dent housing,” Smith said.
There is a difficulty in deter
mining what importance to attach
j to the living system. Whether the
j University wants to take the
money for it from some other
area is a critical question.
A HOUSING program is the
one area in which everyone in the
University has an already fully
committed opinion, Smith noted.
The problem of formulating an
acceptable housing concept is
largely political.
Time is also an important fac
i lor. The subcommittee must be
j finished early if it hopes to make
j decisions about the building of
Robert Moore Hall and the new
clusters.
Smith feels that coeducational
housing is more a social than an
educational problem. He thinks
that a committee other than his
should handle it.

Ralph J. Smith and the subcom
mittee on housing of the Presi
dent’s Committee on Undergradu
ate Education were left a rough
draft report of the old Alexander j
Miller committee on housing as a
starting point for their current I
study of the University residence j
program.
The report, the result of two
years of study by eight members |
of the faculty and administration, |
was supposed to be the definitive
University statement on housing; |
but when Alexander Miller died in i
the spring of 1960, it was left tin- !
finished. U. Donald Winbigler
took over as head until summer
of that year, but when the report
was “nearly complete,” the com
mittee stopped meeting. No one
knows exactly why.
SMITH, WHO used to be head j
of the San Jose City Planning
Commission, is using the report I
along with last quarter’s report
by Legislature’s special commit
tee on housing, the Stern house
president’s committee report on
Stern, their own faculty associ
ate contacts, and all of The Daily
articles anti letters on housing to
“get the feel” of campus opinion
on housing.
The Committee itself is an ad- |
ditional source of information,
Smith says.
Sanford Dornbusch. assistant
dean of humanities and sciences
and head of the sociology depart
ment, contributes his knowledge
as a sociologist and as a keen ob
server of student attitudes. Eric
