# NAACP Boycotts High School Huckleberry Finn' Production
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
The San Francisco chapter of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
Sunday turned down a request
for authorization to picket the
City’s George Washington High
School. They will, instead, boycott
a school production they find of
fensive.
With almost 400 Negroes out
of a student body of 2500, the
school is termed “well integrated’’
by San Francisco NAACP presi
dent Terry Francois. The grounds
for boycott are not student rela
tions. which are held to be good,
but: the forthcoming presentation
of an original musical based upon
Mark Twain’s classic “Huckle
berry Finn,’’ in which Negro stu
dents assume the role of slaves.
FRANCOIS has admitted he
didn’t know whether the charac
terization of the Negroes was fa
vorable or unfavorable, or what
the quality of the play is.
School principal O. I. Schmael
zle refused to cancel the produc
tion scheduled for June 1 and 2,
when he was approached by
Francois.
Francois included in his objec
tion the fact that the Twain work
is required reading. The NAACP
official was quoted as saying,
“ I feel the presentation of
the Negro in textbooks is one
sided enough already. The play
only gives it further empha
sis . . .
Superintendent of Schools Har
old Spears evaluated the play as
“a very excellent adaptation of
the book” and stated his faith in
the students’ handling of their
relationships.
At another point, despite his
previous statement, Francois
claimed his action was not a com
mentary upon the book itself.
THE SHOW, with a cast of 150
(40 Negroes), a 35-piece orches
tra, and a chorus of 90 was
adapted to musical form by Wash
ington student body president
Andrew Belling.
A somewhat astonished Belling
noted, “In the play, as in the book,
Huck Finn steals, lies and cheats.
It is Jim, the Negro slave, who
remains warm and human
throughout.
That the objections of Fran
cois are not on par with the usu

al activity of the respected and
influential NAACP is indicated
by the desertion in this incident
of some of the organization’s fast
est friends:
AMERICAN Civil Liberties
Union Director for Northern Cal
ifornia Ernest Besig issued a
statement noting, “If the school
musical were cancelled, as he
asks, it would be an interference
with the freedom of expression of
the students.
“At the same time of course w'e
defend Francois in his right to
criticize it.
“But I disagree that depicting
Negroes as slaves casts any re
flections upon Negroes. No doubt
it will make many of us whites
feel guilty, however.”
LOCAL chairman of the Afro-
American Association added,
“The present situation racially
today in America cannot be un
derstood without a critical evalu
ation of the events that occurred
during slavery.”
Commented the San Francisco
school district adviser on English
curriculum, “The study of
“Huckleberry Finn” has probably
done more to make students re
alize the dignity and worth of
Negroes than any other kind of
teaching we could devise.”
In a statement to this reporter,
President of the Palo Alto-Stan
ford NAACP, Emile Curtis, com
mented, “You can’t really look at
one incident by itself . . . this is
really deeper ... If we were de
cently well-integrated into Amer
ican life, this type of thing would
never come about.
“ . . . THE casting of it should
not be along racial lines. They
should just cast people, with no
attention to race.
“If we take an isolated occa
sion, we are going to look silly in
protesting . . . need freedom of
expression in entertainment. But
the entertainment arts, in having
this freedom, have a responsibili
ty for balance. Negroes need to be
spread out in roles as we are
spread out in life.”
While Curtis’ evaluation of the
entertainment industry is cer
tainly valid, it would seem that
the answer to the problem is not
a protest against a well-integrat
ed school where, previous to this
incident, the school production
was not the object of racially
divided conflict to the degree that
it has now become.

Union Director for Northern Cal

“At the same time of course w'e

“But I disagree that depicting

it will make many of us whites

LOCAL chairman of the Afro-
American Association added,
“The present situation racially
today in America cannot be un
derstood without a critical evalu
ation of the events that occurred
during slavery.”
Commented the San Francisco
school district adviser on English
curriculum, “The study of
“Huckleberry Finn” has probably
done more to make students re
alize the dignity and worth of
Negroes than any other kind of
teaching we could devise.”
In a statement to this reporter,
President of the Palo Alto-Stan

mented, “You can’t really look at
one incident by itself . . . this is
really deeper ... If we were de

ican life, this type of thing would
never come about.
“ . . . THE casting of it should
not be along racial lines. They
should just cast people, with no
attention to race.
“If we take an isolated occa
sion, we are going to look silly in
protesting . . . need freedom of
expression in entertainment. But
the entertainment arts, in having
this freedom, have a responsibili
ty for balance. Negroes need to be
spread out in roles as we are
spread out in life.”
While Curtis’ evaluation of the
entertainment industry is cer
tainly valid, it would seem that
the answer to the problem is not
a protest against a well-integrat
ed school where, previous to this
incident, the school production
was not the object of racially
divided conflict to the degree that
it has now become.

of a student body of 2500, the
school is termed “well integrated’’

for boycott are not student rela

but: the forthcoming presentation
of an original musical based upon
Mark Twain’s classic “Huckle

FRANCOIS has admitted he
didn’t know whether the charac

vorable or unfavorable, or what
the quality of the play is.
School principal O. I. Schmael

Francois included in his objec

official was quoted as saying,
“ I feel the presentation of
the Negro in textbooks is one

only gives it further empha

Superintendent of Schools Har
old Spears evaluated the play as

the entertainment arts, in having
this freedom, have a responsibili
ty for balance. Negroes need to be
spread out in roles as we are
spread out in life.”
While Curtis’ evaluation of the
entertainment industry is cer
tainly valid, it would seem that
the answer to the problem is not
a protest against a well-integrat
ed school where, previous to this
incident, the school production
was not the object of racially
divided conflict to the degree that
it has now become.
The San Francisco chapter of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
Sunday turned down a request
for authorization to picket the
City’s George Washington High
School. They will, instead, boycott
a school production they find of
fensive.
With almost 400 Negroes out
of a student body of 2500, the
school is termed “well integrated’’
by San Francisco NAACP presi
dent Terry Francois. The grounds
for boycott are not student rela
tions. which are held to be good,
but: the forthcoming presentation
of an original musical based upon
Mark Twain’s classic “Huckle
berry Finn,’’ in which Negro stu
dents assume the role of slaves.
FRANCOIS has admitted he
didn’t know whether the charac
terization of the Negroes was fa
vorable or unfavorable, or what
the quality of the play is.
School principal O. I. Schmael
zle refused to cancel the produc
tion scheduled for June 1 and 2,
when he was approached by
Francois.
Francois included in his objec
tion the fact that the Twain work
is required reading. The NAACP
official was quoted as saying,
“ I feel the presentation of
the Negro in textbooks is one
sided enough already. The play
only gives it further empha
sis . . .
Superintendent of Schools Har
old Spears evaluated the play as
“a very excellent adaptation of
the book” and stated his faith in
the students’ handling of their
relationships.
At another point, despite his
previous statement, Francois
claimed his action was not a com
mentary upon the book itself.
THE SHOW, with a cast of 150
(40 Negroes), a 35-piece orches
tra, and a chorus of 90 was
adapted to musical form by Wash
ington student body president
Andrew Belling.
A somewhat astonished Belling
noted, “In the play, as in the book,
Huck Finn steals, lies and cheats.
It is Jim, the Negro slave, who
remains warm and human
throughout.
That the objections of Fran
cois are not on par with the usu

al activity of the respected and
influential NAACP is indicated
by the desertion in this incident
of some of the organization’s fast
est friends:
AMERICAN Civil Liberties
Union Director for Northern Cal
ifornia Ernest Besig issued a
statement noting, “If the school
musical were cancelled, as he
asks, it would be an interference
with the freedom of expression of
the students.
“At the same time of course w'e
defend Francois in his right to
criticize it.
“But I disagree that depicting
Negroes as slaves casts any re
flections upon Negroes. No doubt
it will make many of us whites
feel guilty, however.”
LOCAL chairman of the Afro-
American Association added,
“The present situation racially
today in America cannot be un
derstood without a critical evalu
ation of the events that occurred
during slavery.”
Commented the San Francisco
school district adviser on English
curriculum, “The study of
“Huckleberry Finn” has probably
done more to make students re
alize the dignity and worth of
Negroes than any other kind of
teaching we could devise.”
In a statement to this reporter,
President of the Palo Alto-Stan
ford NAACP, Emile Curtis, com
mented, “You can’t really look at
one incident by itself . . . this is
really deeper ... If we were de
cently well-integrated into Amer
ican life, this type of thing would
never come about.
“ . . . THE casting of it should
not be along racial lines. They
should just cast people, with no
attention to race.
“If we take an isolated occa
sion, we are going to look silly in
protesting . . . need freedom of
expression in entertainment. But
the entertainment arts, in having
this freedom, have a responsibili
ty for balance. Negroes need to be
spread out in roles as we are
