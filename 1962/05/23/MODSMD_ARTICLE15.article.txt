Editor, The Daily:
The following comments, con
cerning a recent student body
election at the University of Illi
nois, appeared in the Chicago
Sunday Tribune, May 13:
“The main issue in the Illinois
campus election was the contro
versial National Students Associ
ation. which is dominated by vo
ciferous liberals and used by vari
ous departments of the federal
government as a propaganda
agency for its foreign and do
mestic policies, particularly its
policy on federal aid to educa
tion.’’
“ T ATTENDED the N.S.A. con
vention in Madison last year,’ Cor
des (an Illinois student) said. ‘lt
was perhaps the most horrifying
experience of my life. I didn’t re
alize that such things actually
happen. I didn’t even realize that
I was a conservative until I saw
how these people operate. Every
year they pass resolutions on
academic freedom, but the only
freedom they tolerate is for them
selves.
‘They amended their agenda
twice, to accommodate liberal
speakers, hut they refused to hear
conservative or middle of the
road speakers . . . ’”
The article further stated that
the student senate, which strong
ly favored N.S.A., refused to ac
cept a majority vote of the under
graduates to disaffiliate because
less than 50 per cent of the stu
dents (21.307 of them) had voted.
IS THIS what N.S.A. means for
Stanford? Dan Cullen
WHERE?
Editor, The Daily:
Occasionally a situation of
great importance in terms of the
hopes and sufferings of large
numbers of human beings de
mands a decision by our govern

merit with unambiguous moral
and practical urgency. Such is the
news that has been in non-campus
newspapers during the past week
concerning the forced return of
thousands of refugees from Com
munist China by the British au
thorities in Hong Kong, reported
ly because Hong Kong is already
too crowded to hold them and no
other countries are willing to take
them in such numbers.
A recent report in the Chron
icle of “some speculation that
Communist China may bo delib
erately dumping the refugees
with the hope of somehow em
barrassing the British” appears
to be the only pitiful answer be
ing given to this problem despite
the implausibility of the specula
tion, both in itself and in view of
the fact that the refugees are part
of a flow of over a million Chi
nese who have fled to Hong Kong
since 1948.
No protests against the actions
of the British have rung so loud
as against the entrapment of the
people of East Germany behind
Ulbricht’s wall, even though the
current crisis, unlike that of the
wall, is remediable by western
countries alone, with no danger
of reprisal.
Where now are the voices that
have long been fanatically de
nouncing the evil and inhumanity
of Communism and pressing the
need for positive action to save
the world from the Red Menace?
Have they the heart to advocate
offering these thousands who
have already suffered under and
fled from that menace shelter
and acceptance in our own land.
Recent letters have cried out
against the tyrannical silence and
inaction of the Stanford adminis
tration tow r ard the students des
perate, hopeful cries for beer and
co-ed housing. Where have been
the angry protestations against
the dumb inattentiveness of the

Federal Congress to the need for
emergency legislation to answer
the desperate hopes of these refu
gees for a home in the free world,
and for food? Andy Silver
