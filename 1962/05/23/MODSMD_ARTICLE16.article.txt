# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## 
### Glenn Alford 
Well, it’s about that time of the year; the last column of the
volume, the column in which the Sports Editor reviews the past
season in Stanford sports.
PROM THE VERY FIRST athletic event of the 1961-62 year,
this has been the year of the Stanford upset.
The Stanford football team knocked off Tulane, a 10-point favor

ite over the Cards. Before the ;
game, a New Orleans paper said
that if Green Wave Coach Andy
Pilney’s hoys didn’t win, then Pil
ney needn’t come back. Tulane ■
lost, or rather Stanford won, and '
sure enough. Pilney was fired at :
season’s close.
STANFORD followed this up
with an incredible 34-0 shellack- i
ing of Oregon State. OSU Coach .
Tommy Prothro said. “They quit I
. . . but delirious Farm grid
addicts allowed as how their hoys
might have had something to do
with the outcome.
Daily writer Ken Dery wrote,
“What probably happened is that i
the Stanford football team took I
its halftime in a phone booth. Bel:
cause it was a superman who re-B
turned to rout Oregon State 34-0.” l
STANFORD spirits were highj

going against Michigan State, tops in the nation according to wire
services, and indeed they were tops. The Spartans almost ended the
Stanford football season before it had begun, as Handsome Larry
Royce and Hal Steuber were lost, Royce for the season, Steuher 'til
Big Game.
Soph Steve Thurlow led a determined assault and victory over
San Jose State, but Thurlow caught mononeucleosis and that dimmed
a bright star on the Stanford 1961 horizon.
STANFORD'S DEFENSE HELD El* for the next few games,
but the offense couldn't go through the defensive line of the Hassler
Health Home.
Then came the Washington State debacle. The under-dog Cou
gars made the Indians really red, 30-0, and Cal fans were really
chortling.
BUT THE tflM SMITH-LED Indians made the season a success
with a 20-7 romp over the Baby Bears.

All Those Quarterbacks!
An amazing sidelight on the 1961 football season is that a differ
ent quarterback engineered each Stanford victory. Chuck Butler
tossed 40-odd yards to Royce to beat Tulane, Rod Sears completed
eight of 12 passes against Oregon State, Thurlow ran the option
play like he invented it against San Jose, and Smith made a non
existent Card offense go against Cal.
IN BASKETBALL IT WAS a different story. The Cards were
battling for the AAWU title from the start. In the process, they beat
Cal three times and went undefeated at home in 13 games. They also
thrice edged the SC Trojans, defending champs and favorites to
repeat.
Stanford went into their last three games of the season in second
place, with UCLA already having clinched the championship, and
they needed to sweep two from USC and a single contest from UCLA
to stay there.
HOWIE DALLMAR’S CAGERS proceeded to clean up. March
3, against SC, Tom Dose sank a hook shot with seven seconds left
and (he Cards won it 63-62.
March 9, the arrogant UCLA Butins came to town, and left it
with their collective tail between their legs. Stanford ran up a 51-29
halftime lead on the strength of Darrell Sutherland’s shooting (30
points) and John Windsor’s backboard work, and romped home 82-67.
THE NEXT NIGHT DOSE scored 29 points despite missing the
first 10 minutes of the game and fouling out late in the game, and
Darrell Sutherland put away a pair of free throws with few seconds
remaining, and SC again succumbed, 68-66. Over-all, the Cards
were 20-6.
Moments to Remember
Baseball also had its moments. Stanford had an eight-game win
streak, including a double-header win over USC, 15-4 and 5-4. The
second game was one of the most unforgettable ever seen on the
Farm. Skip Lawrence, who had been ailing nearly all year, and had
seen a .350+ lifetime batting average at Stanford dip sharply,
delivered a 400-foot pinch single with the bases loaded and Stanford
had come from behind to defeat SC twice.
THE STANFORD TRACK TEAM became one of the best, as
Payton Jordan’s slow careful development of young trackmen finally
paid off. Dave Weill was within seven inches of the college discus
mark, at 189-11. Harry McCalla was the third fastest two-miler in
the country and Art Batchelder was always around 240 feet in the
javelin. Stanford knocked off Cal for the first time in many a moon,
and Jordan had his first Big Meet victory.
There were other highlights in the Stanford sports year. The
ruggers retained the Big Scrum Axe with a pair of resounding
triumphs over Cal. Fred Priddle’s soccermen bounced Cal out of a
bid to the NCAA tournament with a 7-4 smashing of the Rears, The
golfers beat SC on the Trojan course, and swept honors at Pasati
empo. The swimmers drowned Cal twice. In all, a very satisfying
year for Stanford sports.
AS IS CUSTOMARY, THE Daily will make its nominations in
such categories as Stanford athlete of the year, coach of the year,
frosh athlete of the year, and biggest Stanford sports thrill of the
year.
Pete King will tell of the top sports thrill on Friday, Justin Beck
reveals the top frosh athlete on Monday, Ben Tipton names the Stan
ford Coach of the year on Tuesday, and I’ll give the details on the
Stanford athlete of the year in the last Daily of this volume, next
Wednesday.
THIS HAS BEEN a satisfying year for me, as out-going Sports
Editor. I only hope it has been as satisfying for Stanford coaches
and athletes.

with their collective tail between their legs. Stanford ran up a 51-29
halftime lead on the strength of Darrell Sutherland’s shooting (30
points) and John Windsor’s backboard work, and romped home 82-67.
THE NEXT NIGHT DOSE scored 29 points despite missing the
first 10 minutes of the game and fouling out late in the game, and
Darrell Sutherland put away a pair of free throws with few seconds
remaining, and SC again succumbed, 68-66. Over-all, the Cards
were 20-6.
Moments to Remember
Baseball also had its moments. Stanford had an eight-game win
streak, including a double-header win over USC, 15-4 and 5-4. The
second game was one of the most unforgettable ever seen on the
Farm. Skip Lawrence, who had been ailing nearly all year, and had
seen a .350+ lifetime batting average at Stanford dip sharply,
delivered a 400-foot pinch single with the bases loaded and Stanford
had come from behind to defeat SC twice.
THE STANFORD TRACK TEAM became one of the best, as
Payton Jordan’s slow careful development of young trackmen finally
paid off. Dave Weill was within seven inches of the college discus
mark, at 189-11. Harry McCalla was the third fastest two-miler in
the country and Art Batchelder was always around 240 feet in the
javelin. Stanford knocked off Cal for the first time in many a moon,
and Jordan had his first Big Meet victory.
There were other highlights in the Stanford sports year. The
ruggers retained the Big Scrum Axe with a pair of resounding
triumphs over Cal. Fred Priddle’s soccermen bounced Cal out of a
bid to the NCAA tournament with a 7-4 smashing of the Rears, The
golfers beat SC on the Trojan course, and swept honors at Pasati
empo. The swimmers drowned Cal twice. In all, a very satisfying
year for Stanford sports.
AS IS CUSTOMARY, THE Daily will make its nominations in
such categories as Stanford athlete of the year, coach of the year,
frosh athlete of the year, and biggest Stanford sports thrill of the
year.
Pete King will tell of the top sports thrill on Friday, Justin Beck
reveals the top frosh athlete on Monday, Ben Tipton names the Stan
ford Coach of the year on Tuesday, and I’ll give the details on the
Stanford athlete of the year in the last Daily of this volume, next
Wednesday.

season in Stanford sports.
PROM THE VERY FIRST athletic event of the 1961-62 year,
this has been the year of the Stanford upset.
The Stanford football team knocked off Tulane, a 10-point favor

ite over the Cards. Before the ;
game, a New Orleans paper said
that if Green Wave Coach Andy
Pilney’s hoys didn’t win, then Pil
ney needn’t come back. Tulane ■
lost, or rather Stanford won, and '
sure enough. Pilney was fired at :
season’s close.

. . . but delirious Farm grid

turned to rout Oregon State 34-0.” l
STANFORD spirits were highj

going against Michigan State, tops in the nation according to wire
services, and indeed they were tops. The Spartans almost ended the
Stanford football season before it had begun, as Handsome Larry
Royce and Hal Steuber were lost, Royce for the season, Steuher 'til
Big Game.
Soph Steve Thurlow led a determined assault and victory over
San Jose State, but Thurlow caught mononeucleosis and that dimmed
a bright star on the Stanford 1961 horizon.
STANFORD'S DEFENSE HELD El* for the next few games,
but the offense couldn't go through the defensive line of the Hassler
Health Home.
Then came the Washington State debacle. The under-dog Cou
gars made the Indians really red, 30-0, and Cal fans were really
chortling.
BUT THE tflM SMITH-LED Indians made the season a success
with a 20-7 romp over the Baby Bears.

All Those Quarterbacks!
An amazing sidelight on the 1961 football season is that a differ
ent quarterback engineered each Stanford victory. Chuck Butler
tossed 40-odd yards to Royce to beat Tulane, Rod Sears completed
eight of 12 passes against Oregon State, Thurlow ran the option
play like he invented it against San Jose, and Smith made a non
existent Card offense go against Cal.
IN BASKETBALL IT WAS a different story. The Cards were
battling for the AAWU title from the start. In the process, they beat
Cal three times and went undefeated at home in 13 games. They also
thrice edged the SC Trojans, defending champs and favorites to
repeat.
Stanford went into their last three games of the season in second
place, with UCLA already having clinched the championship, and
they needed to sweep two from USC and a single contest from UCLA
to stay there.
HOWIE DALLMAR’S CAGERS proceeded to clean up. March

going against Michigan State, tops in the nation according to wire

chortling.
BUT THE tflM SMITH-LED Indians made the season a success
with a 20-7 romp over the Baby Bears.

All Those Quarterbacks!
An amazing sidelight on the 1961 football season is that a differ
ent quarterback engineered each Stanford victory. Chuck Butler
tossed 40-odd yards to Royce to beat Tulane, Rod Sears completed
eight of 12 passes against Oregon State, Thurlow ran the option
play like he invented it against San Jose, and Smith made a non
existent Card offense go against Cal.
IN BASKETBALL IT WAS a different story. The Cards were
battling for the AAWU title from the start. In the process, they beat
Cal three times and went undefeated at home in 13 games. They also
thrice edged the SC Trojans, defending champs and favorites to
repeat.
Stanford went into their last three games of the season in second
place, with UCLA already having clinched the championship, and
they needed to sweep two from USC and a single contest from UCLA
to stay there.
HOWIE DALLMAR’S CAGERS proceeded to clean up. March
3, against SC, Tom Dose sank a hook shot with seven seconds left
and (he Cards won it 63-62.
March 9, the arrogant UCLA Butins came to town, and left it
with their collective tail between their legs. Stanford ran up a 51-29
halftime lead on the strength of Darrell Sutherland’s shooting (30
points) and John Windsor’s backboard work, and romped home 82-67.
THE NEXT NIGHT DOSE scored 29 points despite missing the
first 10 minutes of the game and fouling out late in the game, and
Darrell Sutherland put away a pair of free throws with few seconds
remaining, and SC again succumbed, 68-66. Over-all, the Cards
were 20-6.
Moments to Remember
Baseball also had its moments. Stanford had an eight-game win
streak, including a double-header win over USC, 15-4 and 5-4. The
second game was one of the most unforgettable ever seen on the
Farm. Skip Lawrence, who had been ailing nearly all year, and had
seen a .350+ lifetime batting average at Stanford dip sharply,
delivered a 400-foot pinch single with the bases loaded and Stanford
had come from behind to defeat SC twice.
THE STANFORD TRACK TEAM became one of the best, as
Payton Jordan’s slow careful development of young trackmen finally
paid off. Dave Weill was within seven inches of the college discus
mark, at 189-11. Harry McCalla was the third fastest two-miler in
the country and Art Batchelder was always around 240 feet in the
javelin. Stanford knocked off Cal for the first time in many a moon,
and Jordan had his first Big Meet victory.
There were other highlights in the Stanford sports year. The
ruggers retained the Big Scrum Axe with a pair of resounding
triumphs over Cal. Fred Priddle’s soccermen bounced Cal out of a
bid to the NCAA tournament with a 7-4 smashing of the Rears, The
golfers beat SC on the Trojan course, and swept honors at Pasati
empo. The swimmers drowned Cal twice. In all, a very satisfying
year for Stanford sports.
AS IS CUSTOMARY, THE Daily will make its nominations in
such categories as Stanford athlete of the year, coach of the year,
frosh athlete of the year, and biggest Stanford sports thrill of the
year.

streak, including a double-header win over USC, 15-4 and 5-4. The
second game was one of the most unforgettable ever seen on the
Farm. Skip Lawrence, who had been ailing nearly all year, and had
seen a .350+ lifetime batting average at Stanford dip sharply,
delivered a 400-foot pinch single with the bases loaded and Stanford
had come from behind to defeat SC twice.
THE STANFORD TRACK TEAM became one of the best, as
Payton Jordan’s slow careful development of young trackmen finally
paid off. Dave Weill was within seven inches of the college discus
mark, at 189-11. Harry McCalla was the third fastest two-miler in
the country and Art Batchelder was always around 240 feet in the
javelin. Stanford knocked off Cal for the first time in many a moon,
and Jordan had his first Big Meet victory.
There were other highlights in the Stanford sports year. The
ruggers retained the Big Scrum Axe with a pair of resounding
triumphs over Cal. Fred Priddle’s soccermen bounced Cal out of a
bid to the NCAA tournament with a 7-4 smashing of the Rears, The
golfers beat SC on the Trojan course, and swept honors at Pasati
empo. The swimmers drowned Cal twice. In all, a very satisfying
year for Stanford sports.
AS IS CUSTOMARY, THE Daily will make its nominations in
such categories as Stanford athlete of the year, coach of the year,
frosh athlete of the year, and biggest Stanford sports thrill of the
year.
Pete King will tell of the top sports thrill on Friday, Justin Beck
reveals the top frosh athlete on Monday, Ben Tipton names the Stan
ford Coach of the year on Tuesday, and I’ll give the details on the
Stanford athlete of the year in the last Daily of this volume, next
Wednesday.
THIS HAS BEEN a satisfying year for me, as out-going Sports
Editor. I only hope it has been as satisfying for Stanford coaches
and athletes.
