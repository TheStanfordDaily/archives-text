# Long Was a To FDR's New Deal

Huey Long, termed Franklin
Roosevelt’s "most serious rival”
by Columbia historian William
Leuchtenberg last night, was
analyzed in a dynamic Tuesday
Evening Series presentation that
was part scholarly, part Huey
Long, and part reminiscent of a
Stanford History Department lec
ture.
Long, the man who greeted the
highest and most dignified of dig
nitaries while clad in lavender
lounging pajamas and red slip
pers, was portrayed by Leuch
tenberg as an enigmatic figure of
many facets.
THROUGH A “remarkable flair
for attracting attention to him
self by violating propriety and
decorum,” he “threatened to drive
Roosevelt right out of the nation
al spotlight.”
As reform governor of Louisi
ana, Long “triggered a political
revolution,” and “made Louisiana
politics meaningful for the first
time.”
This political forefather of
Earl Long established Louisiana’s
first income tax, eliminated the
poll tax, established night
schools to cope with the state’s
unbounding illiteracy, made Lou
isiana State University a going
concern, and built a governor’s
mansion modeled after the White
House (“so I’ll be used to it when
I get there.”)
NOTED LEUCHTENBERG,
“Huey did all this at a terrible
cost, by the creation of a personal
dictator in Louisiana.” Long had
a personal police force, controlled
at will all state activities, and
“boasted openly that his legisla
ture was the finest bunch of law
yers money can buy . . . They
voted like automatons.”
As the freshman Senator who
proposed the “Share-the-Wealth”
program that “swept through the
country like a prairie fire,” Long
soon encountered the wrath of
Franklin Roosevelt.
Highlighting the Sharc-the-
Wealth program was a fund to
bo obtained by limiting personal
fortunes to SIOD.OOO which was
to provide “every family with
enough money for a home, radio,
and automobile.” While Share
the-Wealth groups added up to a
national organization of vast di
mensions, Long “made no attempt
to bring Share-the-Wealth to Lou
isiana," stated Leuchtenberg.
“That Long’s ideas were indige
nous to the American tradition of
protest made him more danger
ous than less,” noted the histori
an.
“ONE MIGHT expect Long and

Roosevelt to have been friends”
as both were social reformers.
Roosevelt’s reformism however,
was “the reform impulse of the
establishment.” FDR was in the
tradition of the later reformers
who “feared populism,” and saw
the "reformer as the pallidin of
the lowly.”
Long, a man of many talents—
whose Supreme Court briefs
brought praise from Justice Bran
deis—“used the barb of ridicule”
against the New Dealers in an at
tempt to gain national fame.
In Leuchtenberg’s words, “Long
played Falstaff to Roosevelt's
Henry IV.”

the lowly.”
Long, a man of many talents—
whose Supreme Court briefs
brought praise from Justice Bran
deis—“used the barb of ridicule”
against the New Dealers in an at
tempt to gain national fame.
In Leuchtenberg’s words, “Long
played Falstaff to Roosevelt's
Henry IV.”
Huey Long, termed Franklin
Roosevelt’s "most serious rival”
by Columbia historian William
Leuchtenberg last night, was
analyzed in a dynamic Tuesday
Evening Series presentation that
was part scholarly, part Huey
Long, and part reminiscent of a
Stanford History Department lec
ture.
Long, the man who greeted the
highest and most dignified of dig
nitaries while clad in lavender
lounging pajamas and red slip
pers, was portrayed by Leuch
tenberg as an enigmatic figure of
many facets.
THROUGH A “remarkable flair
for attracting attention to him
self by violating propriety and
decorum,” he “threatened to drive
Roosevelt right out of the nation
al spotlight.”
As reform governor of Louisi
ana, Long “triggered a political
revolution,” and “made Louisiana
politics meaningful for the first
time.”
This political forefather of
Earl Long established Louisiana’s
first income tax, eliminated the
poll tax, established night
schools to cope with the state’s
unbounding illiteracy, made Lou
isiana State University a going
concern, and built a governor’s
mansion modeled after the White
House (“so I’ll be used to it when
I get there.”)
NOTED LEUCHTENBERG,
“Huey did all this at a terrible
cost, by the creation of a personal
dictator in Louisiana.” Long had
a personal police force, controlled
at will all state activities, and
“boasted openly that his legisla
ture was the finest bunch of law
yers money can buy . . . They
voted like automatons.”
As the freshman Senator who
proposed the “Share-the-Wealth”
program that “swept through the
country like a prairie fire,” Long
soon encountered the wrath of
Franklin Roosevelt.
Highlighting the Sharc-the-
Wealth program was a fund to
bo obtained by limiting personal
fortunes to SIOD.OOO which was
to provide “every family with
enough money for a home, radio,
and automobile.” While Share
the-Wealth groups added up to a
national organization of vast di
mensions, Long “made no attempt
to bring Share-the-Wealth to Lou
isiana," stated Leuchtenberg.
“That Long’s ideas were indige
nous to the American tradition of
protest made him more danger
ous than less,” noted the histori
an.
“ONE MIGHT expect Long and

Roosevelt to have been friends”
as both were social reformers.
Roosevelt’s reformism however,
was “the reform impulse of the
establishment.” FDR was in the
tradition of the later reformers
who “feared populism,” and saw
the "reformer as the pallidin of
the lowly.”
