# Frosh Advisor Change Due
## 
### 
The Registrar’s office an
nounced today a change in under
graduate adviser-advisee relation
ship and a new system for ad
vising freshmen.
Beginning with pre-registration
today those long, weary lines in
front of your adviser’s office will
be somewhat diminished. Under
the new procedure, sophomores,
juniors and seniors need see their
advisers only once a year; at pre
reg in the spring or at fall regis
tration.
The second major change will
be the assignment of General
Studies advisers to the freshman
dorms.
Since students other than fresh
men will be required to see their
adviser only once a year it is
hoped that they will take the in
itiative when other problems
arise. To change courses in the
first two weeks of any quarter
students need deal only with the
Registrar’s office. Initials by the
students’ advisers will no longer
be necessary. To change courses
after the two-week limit students
will need only the signatures of
the instructors involved.
According to the Committee of
University Advisers the student
now becomes “totally responsible
for informing himself concerning
the specifice nature of the Uni
versity’s General Study program
and for seeing that he completes
this program.”
As part of the plan, each frosh
adviser will dine with the house
he is attached to once each week.
Following the meal the adviser
can meet informally with any of
his advisees. As the students be
come interested in a more specif
ic major the general studies ad
viser will have a list of reference
advisers in each department to
which the student may be re
ferred.
