# Three Assistants, Fourteen Points to Guide Armin's Rule
## 
### 
ASSU President Armin Rosen
cranz announced today the selec
tion of a triumvirate of three
presidential assistants who will
aid him in implementing a Four
teen Point Program for his 1962-
63 term. They are: James Wool
sey, ’63, Executive Assistant;
John L. McCarthy, ’64, Adminis
trative Assistant; and John But
ler, ’65, Executive Assistant.

Rosencranz says of his choices:
“I have searched long and hard
to find associates capable of emu
lating my own standards. These
three men are surely as near as
I can come toward achieving that
goal. I am completely confident
that they will ably assist me in
serving the best interests of Stan
ford.”
The Fourteen Points
The program for Stanford’s pre
eminence is our program; and
that program is this:
I. Open communication with
the Administration, and cove
nants openly arrived at, after
which there shall be no private
interoffice understandings of any
kind. President Sterling’s en
dorsement of the program for
student representation on Uni
versity committees will help
greatly to effectuate that goal.
11. Absolute freedom of expres
sion upon the campus, alike for
radicals and for revolutionaries,
for pacifists and for patriots.
111. The removal, so far as pos
sible, of all financial red-tape and
the establishment of a policy of
non-accountability for money
spent by the several organizations
and living groups who associate
themselves with ASSU for cen
tral banking and maintenance of
credit.
IV. Adequate guarantees given
and taken that campus liquor con
sumption will not violate state
law or transcend the bounds of

decent conduct. The campus must
be made safe for alcohol.
V. A free, open-minded and ab
solutely impartial accommodation
of all requests for guest speakers
through a Public Affairs Commit
tee, which shall work closely with
the University Committee on
Public Exercises and shall co
ordinate the needs of the several
campus organizations concerned
with public and international af
fairs.
VI. The evacuation of all busy
work in the Legislature to obtain
for it an unhampered and unem
barrassed opportunity to deliber
ate upon issues of important con
cern to all students.
VII. The various campus or
ganizations should be accorded
the freest and absolutely unmo
lested opportunity of autonomous
development. Self-determination
should be the guiding principle of
campus life.
VIII. Peace without victory on
the question of coeducational
housing at Stern. The President’s
indication that this plan is en
tirely impracticable should re
direct efforts toward achieving
coeducational housing on an ex
perimental basis for graduate
students and selected undergrad
uates.
IX. A sincere welcome of for
eign students into the Stanford
community, and, more than a wel
come, a desire and effort to ac
commodate them in campus fra
ternities and living groups and in
graduate students’ off-campus
housing.
X. A maximum use of the new
Union for the purpose of afford
ing opportunities for communica
tion, recreation, relaxation, and
gastronomic delight to the whole
academic community.
XI. Promulgation of a new
ASSU constitution which should
seek, as far as possible, to give
all undergraduates an equal and
effective voice in student govern
ment; and maintain a responsible
and respectable judiciary.
XII. A preceptorial program
for freshmen, whereby Western
Civilization would be taught by
qualified instructors to groups of
four or five men and women, co
ordinated with the aid of Direc
tors of the freshman living
groups.
XIII. A full and complete ori
entation of students selected for
the Overseas Campuses by those
who have preceded them. An ef
fort must be made to integrate
these Stanford enclaves with the
culture and people of their respec
tive countries.
XIV. A general association of
Stanford with the NSA must be
formed under specific covenants
for the purpose of affording
guarantees of political independ
ence and intellectual integrity to
Stanford’s representation.
