The advocates of NSA have two '
ways of justifying this meager;
i representation.
First they point out that United i
States Congress members have
j many more constitutents than our
j six delegates would have. But this
analogy and attempted justifies- i
tion fail because:
1. The U.S. Congress is not a j
body to represent opinions but to !
legislate for the welfare of those
■ people it represents.
2. The U.S. Congress is in ses- j
sion for at least half of every year 1
and does not merely set broad poi- j
icies to be intepreted by the Execu-1
live branch.
3. Most important, the U.S. Con- 1
gross has as its goal the maximum
good for all people, whereas the
NSA cannot claim any such goal
because of the great diversity of
student interest and opinion.
Secondly, the various associa
tions of doctors, lawyers, bankers,
accountants, etc., and the unions’
, of workers in various industries i
are cited as being similar to the j
NSA. Their leaders are not ac- i
tually on the same level as their
members any more than NSA of-1
ficers are still students.
But in the case of the former,
again they are working for the
common concerns and goals of
their members, and in many cases
will return to their ranks after
their term of office.
The NSA officers, on the other
hand, in most instances cannot
1 claim to represent a solid or even
strong block of opinion, and soon
become professional lobbyists for
■ their own and the National Execu
■ tive Council’s views.
In summary, the National Stu
dent Association is not needed by
Stanford for the services and as
’ sistance it provides on a campus,
1 and it certainly cannot claim to
1 be truly representative of a great
diversity of student opinion.
I submit, therefore, that it would
> be a mistake for Stanford to re
■ affiliate with NSA.

1. The U.S. Congress is not a j
body to represent opinions but to !
legislate for the welfare of those
■ people it represents.
2. The U.S. Congress is in ses- j
sion for at least half of every year 1
and does not merely set broad poi- j
icies to be intepreted by the Execu-1
live branch.
3. Most important, the U.S. Con- 1
gross has as its goal the maximum
good for all people, whereas the
NSA cannot claim any such goal
because of the great diversity of
student interest and opinion.
Secondly, the various associa
tions of doctors, lawyers, bankers,
accountants, etc., and the unions’
, of workers in various industries i
are cited as being similar to the j
NSA. Their leaders are not ac- i
tually on the same level as their
members any more than NSA of-1
ficers are still students.
But in the case of the former,
again they are working for the
common concerns and goals of
their members, and in many cases
will return to their ranks after
their term of office.
The NSA officers, on the other
hand, in most instances cannot
1 claim to represent a solid or even
strong block of opinion, and soon
become professional lobbyists for
■ their own and the National Execu

In summary, the National Stu
dent Association is not needed by
Stanford for the services and as
’ sistance it provides on a campus,
1 and it certainly cannot claim to

diversity of student opinion.
I submit, therefore, that it would

j ing all of its stands on all issues. |
The advocates of NSA have two '
ways of justifying this meager;
i representation.
First they point out that United i
States Congress members have
j many more constitutents than our
j six delegates would have. But this
analogy and attempted justifies- i
tion fail because:
1. The U.S. Congress is not a j
body to represent opinions but to !
legislate for the welfare of those
■ people it represents.
2. The U.S. Congress is in ses- j
sion for at least half of every year 1
and does not merely set broad poi- j
icies to be intepreted by the Execu-1
live branch.
3. Most important, the U.S. Con- 1
gross has as its goal the maximum
good for all people, whereas the
NSA cannot claim any such goal
because of the great diversity of
student interest and opinion.

tions of doctors, lawyers, bankers,
accountants, etc., and the unions’
, of workers in various industries i
