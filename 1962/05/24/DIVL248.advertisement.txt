I am opposed to such a move.
1 Although the NSA provides a
1 number of services to many col
leges and universities both in
the realm of student government
and in international activities
for Stanford, it would merely be
a spokesman on a national level.
{ But, it would be speaking for us
! without our having an active part
in determining what policies its
j officers represent.
The services offered by NSA are
designed primarily for smaller
i colleges and would bo of little, if
j any, use to Stanford; this is so
only because our University and

As for the NSA travel programs,
we can avail ourselves of the op

j we are not a member school.
Will the NSA represent the

At the National Congress, held
each summer, we would have six
votes out of some 800. Thus, almost
9,000 Stanford students would be

deciding the NSA policies.
These policies would be subject
to the interpretation of the nation

I cil composed of approximately
j 30 students might enact any

I means that Stanford might be
I completely deprived of a voice in
setting the policies.
Nevertheless, by virtue of our
j membership in the Association, we
