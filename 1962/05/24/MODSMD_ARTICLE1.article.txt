## 
### 
WASHINGTON ( UFl)—President Kennedy yesterday dis
closed plans to linow open the United States to several thousand
Chinese refugees from Communist China who have crowded into

llong Kong.
Justice Department officials

said admission of the refugees
might start in about two weeks
and would continue as fast as
they could be screened. H. L.
Harden, assistant commissioner
for travel control in the Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service,
left for Hong Kong yesterday to
set up the program. Harden
handled the Hungarian refugee
program six years ago.
THE PRESIDENT said the
government was trying to speed
the refugees’ admission to the
United States under emergency
provisions of the McCarran-Wal
ter Act used to admit Hungarian
refugees in 1956.
The President was aked early
in yesterday’s news conference
whether the administration had
any plans for helping with the
refugee problem in Hong Kong.
The British crown colony has
been swamped with the mass of
refugees and has been forced to
start turning them away.
Kennedy first called attention
to press reports that the Chinese
Communists seem to be making
some effort to halt the flow of
refugees. He also noted that the
United States for many years has
been providing food for half a
million of the refugees.
THEN HE added that “there
are several thousand refugees in
Hong Kong and surrounding
areas who have been cleared by
our consular people for admis
sion to the United States.’’
State Department officials said
there are 21,500 Chinese in Hong
Kong registered on the U.S. im
migration quota waiting list.
Some of these, officials said, had
been cleared for entry to the
U.S. under past refugee programs
which expired before their turn
came up.
The immigration quota for Chi
nese is only 105 a year but the
President noted that many more
could be admitted under “the
same legislation which has per
mitted us to bring in Hungarian
refugees and Cuban refugees.”

provisions of the McCarran-Wal
ter Act used to admit Hungarian
refugees in 1956.
The President was aked early
in yesterday’s news conference
whether the administration had
any plans for helping with the
refugee problem in Hong Kong.
The British crown colony has
been swamped with the mass of
refugees and has been forced to
start turning them away.
Kennedy first called attention
to press reports that the Chinese
Communists seem to be making
some effort to halt the flow of
refugees. He also noted that the
United States for many years has
been providing food for half a
million of the refugees.
THEN HE added that “there
are several thousand refugees in
Hong Kong and surrounding
areas who have been cleared by
our consular people for admis
sion to the United States.’’
State Department officials said
there are 21,500 Chinese in Hong
Kong registered on the U.S. im
migration quota waiting list.
Some of these, officials said, had
been cleared for entry to the
U.S. under past refugee programs
which expired before their turn
came up.
The immigration quota for Chi
nese is only 105 a year but the
President noted that many more
could be admitted under “the
same legislation which has per
mitted us to bring in Hungarian
refugees and Cuban refugees.”
