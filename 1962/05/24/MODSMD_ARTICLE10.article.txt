# Streit Cites Need For An Atlantic Union Federation
## 
### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
“What do you think we will achieve first, a rocket to the moon
or the Atlantic Union?” Clarence Streit asked his audience in
Cubberley yesterday afternoon. “Which do you think it would be
wiser to have first?” he then asked.
Streit received what he called the standard answers to his

questions. Nearly everyone feels
wo will reach the moon first, but
that we would be wiser to achieve
a union of the free peoples first.
ALTHOUGH admittedly the un
ion will be difficult to achieve, it
would be “recognition of the val
idity of our basic principles,”
Streit declared. In the proposed
Atlantic Union as in the United
States, “the unit is the sovereign
citizen.” The union is “of, by and
for the people.” he emphasized.
The Atlantic Union would bo a
federation of as many of the free
nations as desired to join, “con
cerned only with the common af
fairs that they decide are com
mon.” Aims of the Union would
include a common market, de
fense system, moneary unit, citi
zenship, and communications and
postal services.
THE NATIONS would main
tain independent government in
other fields where they could
govern best. The Union would
also serve as a nucleus world gov
ernment that would hopefully
grow into a real world organiza
tion.

Advantages of the Union would
include freedom to work, sell, and
live anywhere one wishes in the
free world, with as much mobility
as one now has in the United
States, Streit pointed to the Eu
ropean Common Market and the
prosperity it is creating, and said
we could have the same situa
tion in all the free nations.
Great educational benefits
would also result, because the
Union would enable young people
to attend foreign schools more
easily, with fewer monetary, job
and entrance restrictions.
WE MUST change our govern
ment according to whether it
“will give more freedom or not,”
Streit said. We want “life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness’
from our government, and it’s
strange how many people miss
the target.” Streit pointed out that
the United Nations was supposed
to fulfill these wants, but it has
undershot the mark. “Govern
ment should raise its sights,”
Streit feels.
Streit is president of the bi
partisan Federal Union Inc., has
worked as foreign correspondent,
and has written several books.
His latest work is “Freedom’s
Frontier—-Atlantic Union Now.”

or the Atlantic Union?” Clarence Streit asked his audience in
Cubberley yesterday afternoon. “Which do you think it would be
wiser to have first?” he then asked.
Streit received what he called the standard answers to his

questions. Nearly everyone feels
wo will reach the moon first, but
that we would be wiser to achieve
a union of the free peoples first.
ALTHOUGH admittedly the un
ion will be difficult to achieve, it
would be “recognition of the val
idity of our basic principles,”
Streit declared. In the proposed
Atlantic Union as in the United
States, “the unit is the sovereign
citizen.” The union is “of, by and
for the people.” he emphasized.
The Atlantic Union would bo a
federation of as many of the free
nations as desired to join, “con
cerned only with the common af
fairs that they decide are com
mon.” Aims of the Union would
include a common market, de
fense system, moneary unit, citi
zenship, and communications and
postal services.
THE NATIONS would main
tain independent government in
other fields where they could
govern best. The Union would
also serve as a nucleus world gov
ernment that would hopefully
grow into a real world organiza
tion.

Advantages of the Union would
include freedom to work, sell, and
live anywhere one wishes in the
free world, with as much mobility
as one now has in the United
States, Streit pointed to the Eu
ropean Common Market and the
prosperity it is creating, and said
we could have the same situa
tion in all the free nations.
Great educational benefits
would also result, because the
Union would enable young people
to attend foreign schools more
easily, with fewer monetary, job
and entrance restrictions.
WE MUST change our govern
ment according to whether it
“will give more freedom or not,”
Streit said. We want “life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness’
from our government, and it’s
strange how many people miss
the target.” Streit pointed out that
the United Nations was supposed
to fulfill these wants, but it has
undershot the mark. “Govern
ment should raise its sights,”
Streit feels.
Streit is president of the bi
partisan Federal Union Inc., has
worked as foreign correspondent,
and has written several books.
His latest work is “Freedom’s
Frontier—-Atlantic Union Now.”
