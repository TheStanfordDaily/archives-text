# 'Lo' Reviewed, Called Amusing
## 
### RICK BARRETT 
For those who prefer cerebral
amusement to recognizable drama
the I-Center’s production of “On
the Nature of Lo, etc.” this after
noon at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium will provide some measure
of entertainment.
Though the cast appeared ham
pered by distracting lighting and
a noisy stage floor the production
certainly offers a welcome alter
native to Soupy Sales or the
Flintstones.
Victor Emiljanow had the good
sense to play the title role in a
manner more pompous than
grandeloquent. Lo struts across
the stage in a manner reminiscent
of Captain Queeg in the Caine
Mutiny. Ernest, his creation, was
ably handled by Juris Svendsen.
Ernest was perhaps the most be
lievable of the characters if, in
deed, the author sought credibili
ty. The Female, portrayed by Ann
Heath, will be remembered more
for her dancing than her dia
logue.
The choreography by Barbara
Greer was up to Miss Greer’s
usually high standards though at
times it seemed more pantomine
than ballet.
An original play by Alberto
Alverez-Calderon. "On the Nature
of Lo, etc.” seems more fit for the
anthology than the stage. Mr.
Alveroz is apt at the memorable
epigram, but lacks sureness in
the creation of his characters.
The play will be presented
again this afternoon. Admission
is free.
