One of the main reasons why
our relations with Gen. de Gaulle
are seriously disturbed is that
the Kennedy administration has
decided not to alter the establish
ed policy, which is not to share
with France, as we do with Great
Britain, the know-how and the
facilities of nuclear power. At
first glance the cure for the trou
ble would seem to be to invite the
French into the Anglo-American
nuclear club.
But. the problem becomes more
complicated when we realize, as
the British now do, that although
they have a considerable nuclear
power of their own, always as
suming the over-all protection of
the United States, it is a power
which is on the way to becoming
obsolete. Because it is impossibly
expensive, the British have al
ready retired from the race in
missiles, and they know that
when the bombers become obso
lete, say within the next ten
years, Britain will cease to be a
nuclear power in its own right.
Thus our “special relations” in
nuclear affairs is destined to dis
appear within a period of time.
The time will not be much long
er than it would take France,
which is now far behind Britain,
to make itself as strong in nu
clear power as Britain is today.
THE FACT that Britain has al
ready retired from the missile
race and that it. realizes that it
has an obsolescent nuclear power,
proves that the whole British ef
fort was a mistake in the first
place. We allowed ourselves to be
persuaded to support the mistake
by an amendment to the McMa
hon Act, The question today is
whether to make compensation to
France for that mistake, which
time is curing anyway, by repeat
ing the same mistake with
France.
After much debate and soul
searching the Administration de
cided, I think rightly, that the
original principle of the McMa
hon Act is sound, that within the
Western Alliance the ultimate re
sponsibility in nuclear affairs
must be in one capital, not in two
or three. For the United States
the predicament would be intoler
able if the key to the use of our
strategic nuclear forces were not
in Washington.
We have this power because
we had to build it. Our nuclear
power is, as a matter of fact, the
core of the defense of Europe
and of the West. We cannot allow
this power to be set in motion by
others. We must keep the ulti
mate right to decide whether and
when it shall be used. A weak
and independent nuclear force
within the Western Alliance, a
force which could start, a world

war hut could not finish it, would
be a danger to the peace of the
world and to our own national
security.
NOT FOR A moment do I be
lieve that the British would dream
of committing a gross betrayal of
the United States, which would
be to buy admission to the Com
mon Market by offering to
France the nuclear know how ac
quired from us. Nor do I share
the view that the British have no
other card, except betrayal of the
United States, to play against
Gen. de Gaulle.
There is a very strong card,
which is at once British and
American, in what has been called
the grand project. This looks to
the admission of Britain and some
other European states to the
Common Market, to an associa
tion with it of the European neu
trals, to a friendly accommoda
tion with the Commonwealth, and
with all this partnership of the
United States in a great open and
low tariff trading area.
IT MUST BE understood in
France and in Germany, as I be
lieve it is in Belgium, the Nether
lands, and Italy, that the grand
project is not a Utopian contrap
tion, nor is it an insidious Ameri
can attempt to control Europe.
It is based on the hard conditions
of the post-war world. The United
States needs this large liberal
trading area if it is to expand its
trade and thus be able to earn the
hard money to finance its mili
tary and civilian commitments
overseas. For this reason, if Paris
and Bonn wreck the grand proj
ect, there is almost certain to fol
low a severe retrenchment in our
dollar commitments overseas.
There should be no illusions
about this, particularly in Bonn.
If the European Economic Com
munity becomes a closed, restric
tive. and exclusive society, the
United States will not be able to
earn the costs of defending that
community on the ground in Eu
rope. The United States will be
compelled to insist that the de
fense of this restricted Europe
be paid for by the restricted Eu
rope. With our dollar deficit what
it is, with our mounting obliga
tions in this hemisphere and in
Asia, we shall not be able to go
on subsidizing the local and tac
tical defense of the European con
tinent.
We must see to it that this is
understood in the places where
the final decisions will be taken
about the admission of Great
Britain and about the partnership
with the United States. I am con
fident that it will be understood.

fort was a mistake in the first
place. We allowed ourselves to be
persuaded to support the mistake
by an amendment to the McMa
hon Act, The question today is
whether to make compensation to
France for that mistake, which
time is curing anyway, by repeat
ing the same mistake with
France.
After much debate and soul
searching the Administration de
cided, I think rightly, that the
original principle of the McMa
hon Act is sound, that within the
Western Alliance the ultimate re
sponsibility in nuclear affairs
must be in one capital, not in two
or three. For the United States
the predicament would be intoler
able if the key to the use of our
strategic nuclear forces were not
in Washington.
We have this power because
we had to build it. Our nuclear
power is, as a matter of fact, the
core of the defense of Europe
and of the West. We cannot allow
this power to be set in motion by
others. We must keep the ulti
mate right to decide whether and
when it shall be used. A weak
and independent nuclear force
within the Western Alliance, a
force which could start, a world

war hut could not finish it, would
be a danger to the peace of the
world and to our own national
security.
NOT FOR A moment do I be
lieve that the British would dream
of committing a gross betrayal of
the United States, which would
be to buy admission to the Com
mon Market by offering to
France the nuclear know how ac
quired from us. Nor do I share
the view that the British have no
other card, except betrayal of the
United States, to play against
Gen. de Gaulle.
There is a very strong card,
which is at once British and
American, in what has been called
the grand project. This looks to
the admission of Britain and some
other European states to the
Common Market, to an associa
tion with it of the European neu
trals, to a friendly accommoda
tion with the Commonwealth, and
with all this partnership of the
United States in a great open and
low tariff trading area.
IT MUST BE understood in
France and in Germany, as I be
lieve it is in Belgium, the Nether
lands, and Italy, that the grand
project is not a Utopian contrap
tion, nor is it an insidious Ameri
can attempt to control Europe.
It is based on the hard conditions
of the post-war world. The United
States needs this large liberal
trading area if it is to expand its
trade and thus be able to earn the
hard money to finance its mili
tary and civilian commitments
overseas. For this reason, if Paris
and Bonn wreck the grand proj
ect, there is almost certain to fol
low a severe retrenchment in our
dollar commitments overseas.
There should be no illusions
about this, particularly in Bonn.
If the European Economic Com
munity becomes a closed, restric
tive. and exclusive society, the
United States will not be able to
earn the costs of defending that
community on the ground in Eu
rope. The United States will be
compelled to insist that the de
fense of this restricted Europe
be paid for by the restricted Eu
rope. With our dollar deficit what
it is, with our mounting obliga
tions in this hemisphere and in
Asia, we shall not be able to go
on subsidizing the local and tac
tical defense of the European con
tinent.
We must see to it that this is
understood in the places where
the final decisions will be taken
about the admission of Great
Britain and about the partnership
with the United States. I am con
fident that it will be understood.

One of the main reasons why
our relations with Gen. de Gaulle
are seriously disturbed is that
the Kennedy administration has
decided not to alter the establish
ed policy, which is not to share
with France, as we do with Great
Britain, the know-how and the
facilities of nuclear power. At
first glance the cure for the trou
ble would seem to be to invite the
French into the Anglo-American
nuclear club.
But. the problem becomes more
complicated when we realize, as
the British now do, that although
they have a considerable nuclear
power of their own, always as
suming the over-all protection of
the United States, it is a power
which is on the way to becoming
obsolete. Because it is impossibly
expensive, the British have al
ready retired from the race in
missiles, and they know that
when the bombers become obso
lete, say within the next ten
years, Britain will cease to be a
nuclear power in its own right.
Thus our “special relations” in
nuclear affairs is destined to dis
appear within a period of time.
The time will not be much long
er than it would take France,
which is now far behind Britain,
to make itself as strong in nu
clear power as Britain is today.

be to buy admission to the Com
mon Market by offering to
France the nuclear know how ac
quired from us. Nor do I share
the view that the British have no
other card, except betrayal of the
United States, to play against
Gen. de Gaulle.
There is a very strong card,
which is at once British and
American, in what has been called
the grand project. This looks to
the admission of Britain and some
other European states to the
Common Market, to an associa
tion with it of the European neu
trals, to a friendly accommoda
tion with the Commonwealth, and
with all this partnership of the
United States in a great open and
low tariff trading area.
IT MUST BE understood in
France and in Germany, as I be
lieve it is in Belgium, the Nether
lands, and Italy, that the grand
project is not a Utopian contrap
tion, nor is it an insidious Ameri
can attempt to control Europe.
It is based on the hard conditions
of the post-war world. The United
States needs this large liberal
trading area if it is to expand its
trade and thus be able to earn the
hard money to finance its mili
tary and civilian commitments
overseas. For this reason, if Paris
and Bonn wreck the grand proj
ect, there is almost certain to fol
low a severe retrenchment in our
dollar commitments overseas.
There should be no illusions
about this, particularly in Bonn.
If the European Economic Com
munity becomes a closed, restric
tive. and exclusive society, the
United States will not be able to
earn the costs of defending that
community on the ground in Eu
rope. The United States will be
compelled to insist that the de
fense of this restricted Europe
be paid for by the restricted Eu
rope. With our dollar deficit what
it is, with our mounting obliga
tions in this hemisphere and in
Asia, we shall not be able to go
on subsidizing the local and tac
tical defense of the European con
tinent.
We must see to it that this is
understood in the places where
the final decisions will be taken
about the admission of Great
Britain and about the partnership
with the United States. I am con
fident that it will be understood.

One of the main reasons why
our relations with Gen. de Gaulle
are seriously disturbed is that
the Kennedy administration has
decided not to alter the establish
ed policy, which is not to share
with France, as we do with Great
Britain, the know-how and the
facilities of nuclear power. At
first glance the cure for the trou
ble would seem to be to invite the
French into the Anglo-American
nuclear club.
But. the problem becomes more
complicated when we realize, as
the British now do, that although
they have a considerable nuclear
power of their own, always as
suming the over-all protection of
the United States, it is a power
which is on the way to becoming
obsolete. Because it is impossibly
expensive, the British have al
ready retired from the race in
missiles, and they know that
when the bombers become obso
lete, say within the next ten
years, Britain will cease to be a
nuclear power in its own right.
Thus our “special relations” in
nuclear affairs is destined to dis
appear within a period of time.
The time will not be much long
er than it would take France,
which is now far behind Britain,
to make itself as strong in nu
clear power as Britain is today.
THE FACT that Britain has al
ready retired from the missile
race and that it. realizes that it
has an obsolescent nuclear power,
proves that the whole British ef
fort was a mistake in the first
place. We allowed ourselves to be
persuaded to support the mistake
by an amendment to the McMa
hon Act, The question today is
whether to make compensation to
France for that mistake, which
time is curing anyway, by repeat
ing the same mistake with
France.
After much debate and soul
searching the Administration de
cided, I think rightly, that the
original principle of the McMa
hon Act is sound, that within the
Western Alliance the ultimate re
sponsibility in nuclear affairs
must be in one capital, not in two
or three. For the United States
the predicament would be intoler
able if the key to the use of our
strategic nuclear forces were not
in Washington.
We have this power because
we had to build it. Our nuclear
power is, as a matter of fact, the
core of the defense of Europe
and of the West. We cannot allow
this power to be set in motion by
others. We must keep the ulti
mate right to decide whether and
when it shall be used. A weak
and independent nuclear force
within the Western Alliance, a
force which could start, a world

war hut could not finish it, would
be a danger to the peace of the
world and to our own national
security.
NOT FOR A moment do I be
lieve that the British would dream
of committing a gross betrayal of
the United States, which would
be to buy admission to the Com
mon Market by offering to
France the nuclear know how ac
quired from us. Nor do I share
