# End for Presophomore Rush Proposal Still Not Decided
## 
### 
Correspondence between Fred
eric O. Glover, Executive Assis
tant to the President, and Bill
Hawthorne, author of a recent
Letter to the Editor, has revealed
the fate of what Hawthorne called
the “no-fated” presophomore rush
proposal of the 1960-61 Wilbur
sponsors.
Hawthorne’s letter asking for
charter membership in the Causes
Rejected A Priori club on the
basis of his cause, presophomore
rush, which he said had had no
administration consideration, ap
peared in The Daily on May 10.
Glover wrote Hawthorne on the
same day, informing him that
President Sterling had asked
LASSU on Feb. 9 to undertake a
study of the current rushing
problem at Stanford.
GLOVER SAID, “Your letter in
the May 10 issue of The Daily
about fraternity rushing does not
jibe with the facts.”
Hawthorne’s reply, dated May
13, states: “I was aware that the
President had turned this issue of
rushing over to LASSU with the
qualification that his office would
make the final decision on the

matter. I was under the impres
sion that the President’s Office
knew that LASSU had found this
qualification unacceptable and
had declined to study the issue. I
have since learned that the Presi
dent’s Office was not officially
informed of this which, therefore,
gives some justification to the
lack of action on its part.”
HAWTHORNE goes on to say,
“As you remember, the sponsors’
proposal was made to the Presi
dent one year ago on May 18,
1961. After a delay of eight
months, the issue was referred to
LASSU. To the best of my knowl
edge, with the exception of the
IFC and LASSU, the proposal has
not been, nor is, on the agenda of
any student or University com
mittee. Since LASSU is not study
ing the issue, I hope the Presi
dent’s Office will initiate a study
of the entire rushing process in
order to reach some decision on
the presophomore rush proposal.”
Hawthorne said that “an ex
change of views between the ad
ministration and the students in
volved in the recent issues on
campus, with the hope of reach
ing a mutual understanding,”
would be very useful.
He and Glover met last w r eek to
discuss some of the “lost causes.”
