## Appraisal of Effective Teaching 
### 
(Editor’s Nolo: This is the last
article in a three-part series.)
That a good teacher ought to be
recognized is a generally accepted
truth, hut the problems of leach
ing measurement have never
really been solved satisfactorily.
To make some headway into
the difficulty—already the sub
ject of many investigations —
President Wallace Sterling ap
pointed a subcommittee on the
appraisal of effective teaching to

the President’s special Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
Chairman Philip Rhinelander
sees two separate difficulties in
the central issue; the first is to
establish the criteria of good
teaching: the second is to estab
lish ways of getting evidence of it.
IDEALLY, Rhinelander said,
the groat teacher ought to be a
great scholar as well. Publication,
which is evidence of scholarship,
is fairly easy to measure. But
what the teacher does is known

only to his students.
The really good and the really
bad teachers are not difficult to
see. Problems arise with simply
competent teachers: how does one
distinguish the passable from the
quality job?
The problem manifests itself
both in initial appointment to the
faculty and in department pro
motion. If a man has not pub
lished, a case may be made for
him on the basis of his teaching
record.
The problems vary from level
to level, from class structure to
class structure, and from area to
area. There are different, difficul
ties in teaching freshmen than in
teaching seniors or graduates;
there are different difficulties in
lectures than in seminars.
THE MEMBERS of the commit
tee were selected to give repre
sentation to the different areas.
Brooks Otis represents the hu
manities; Lorrie Tarshis the so
cial sciences; Donald Kennedy
the sciences; Harold Bacon,
mathematics: Walter Lohnes,
languages: John Vennard, engi
neering; Herbert Nanney the per
forming arts; and William Cow
ley, history of education.
The subcommittee will be using
Nevitt Sanford’s book “The Amer
ican College” on the “image” of
the teacher. They will also study
the value of student-reaction
questionaires.
The study must be made in the
context of the curriculum and the
kind of student the University
wants to produce, Rhinelander
said.
No person is the ideal teacher
for all students, and there is no
ideal course size for all students,
he said.
THK GENERAL Studies Com
mittee acts as a subcommittee to
the Committee on Undergraduate
Education for curricular and re
lated problems. Things that are
normally in their hands are given
to them for special study, be
cause it is assumed that they are
best equipped to handle them.
The committee, headed by Rob
ert Walker, is now in the process
of studying the freshman year.
Last spring they made an inten
sive survey of 600 members of
the freshman class in an effort to
determine how the University has
affected them in all areas.
In addition, the Committee is
studying the advising system, ad
vance placement credit, content
and instruction in freshman year
courses, year-end examinations
for year-long courses, the prob
lem of the number of courses,
honors sections in large courses,
and earlier student contact with
teachers of professorial rank.
Some of the recommendations
of the General Studies Committee
will go to the President. Decisions
of major academic importance
must also be passed by the Aca
demic Council before action can
bo taken on them.
The Committee hopes to be
ready to release some of these
reports before the end of the aca
demic year.

That a good teacher ought to be
recognized is a generally accepted
truth, hut the problems of leach
ing measurement have never
really been solved satisfactorily.
To make some headway into
the difficulty—already the sub
ject of many investigations —
President Wallace Sterling ap
pointed a subcommittee on the
appraisal of effective teaching to

the President’s special Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education.
Chairman Philip Rhinelander
sees two separate difficulties in
the central issue; the first is to
establish the criteria of good
teaching: the second is to estab
lish ways of getting evidence of it.
IDEALLY, Rhinelander said,
the groat teacher ought to be a
great scholar as well. Publication,
which is evidence of scholarship,
is fairly easy to measure. But
what the teacher does is known

only to his students.
The really good and the really
bad teachers are not difficult to
see. Problems arise with simply
competent teachers: how does one
distinguish the passable from the
quality job?
The problem manifests itself
both in initial appointment to the
faculty and in department pro
motion. If a man has not pub
lished, a case may be made for
him on the basis of his teaching
record.
The problems vary from level
to level, from class structure to
class structure, and from area to
area. There are different, difficul
ties in teaching freshmen than in
teaching seniors or graduates;
there are different difficulties in
lectures than in seminars.
THE MEMBERS of the commit
tee were selected to give repre
sentation to the different areas.
Brooks Otis represents the hu
manities; Lorrie Tarshis the so
cial sciences; Donald Kennedy
the sciences; Harold Bacon,
mathematics: Walter Lohnes,
languages: John Vennard, engi
neering; Herbert Nanney the per
forming arts; and William Cow
ley, history of education.
The subcommittee will be using
Nevitt Sanford’s book “The Amer
ican College” on the “image” of
the teacher. They will also study
the value of student-reaction
questionaires.
The study must be made in the
context of the curriculum and the
kind of student the University
wants to produce, Rhinelander
said.
No person is the ideal teacher
for all students, and there is no
ideal course size for all students,
he said.
