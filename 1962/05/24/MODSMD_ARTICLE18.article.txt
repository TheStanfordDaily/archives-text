RESTRICTED
Editor, The Daily:
May we quote in part an adver
tisement from your “Want Ad”
section: “Furnished Apartments
to Rent. In lovely restricted resi
dential district.”

We can’t be sure what you and
your advertiser mean by “restrict
ed.” But we do know what it
usually means in advertisements
of this nature—restricted against
“undesirable” elements, e.g. Ne
groes, Jews, or any other group
the landlord and other tenants
are prejudiced against.
If this is the intended meaning
in your ad, we wish to register a
protest against this kind of rent
al listing. If not, change your
wording; it implies an attitude
discreditable to the university.

(Editor’s Note: The advertiser
says that, “restricted” was meant
in the sense of zoning. However,
we have requested him to delete
the word from the advertisement
and he lias agreed to do so.)
SEX AT VASSAR
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding your editorial of
May 10, 1 should like to express
a divergent and, I’m afraid, some
what less popular judgment of
the actions of Miss Blanding of
Vassar. It was your contention
that “Miss Blanding has abdicated
her responsibilities” in establish
ing an enforced code of sexual
behavior for the students of Vas
sar. I maintain that she is truly
cognizant of her responsibility, al
beit I don’t propose to defend
her actual program.
Aristotle (hardly a prude in
that he barely escaped Socrates
fate) proposed that the art of
politics had as its object, the de
termination of ethical actions.
There are two ideas which are re
sponsible for the decline of the
acceptance of this dictum. The
first is that legislators in general
have avoided the consideration of
ethics, being devoted usually to
the non-personal state or elector
ate. Secondly, we have seen the
rise of the notion that morality
must stem from the Individual.
This idea results from the exten
sion of a local concept of free
will, so that it comes to be stand
ardly phrased as: “only i (it is a
pretty small T) can determine
what is right, so don’t tell Me
(but it is a big ‘Me’) what to do.”
But what we fail to see is that
along with Aristotle’s above state
ment, we must take his idea that
Man is, by nature, a political ani
mal. Now this isn’t really a novel
idea for our culture; it appears
in Genesis, and the Now Testa
ment fairly reeks of it. Dear Edi

tor, you are indeed right that “the
problem is not really of sex at
all.” One doesn’t, have the “right”
of personal opinion, one has the
duly of personal opinion, and in
deed the university should recog
nize this.
"Professors educate students.”
My God, look at the words! “Pro
fessor” should be self-explana
tory; eduoere —to lead forth; stu
dere- (o be eager for, give atten
tion to. For that matter, diseiplina
-—instruction, training, education.
In the same issue of The Daily,
Mr. Weinig gave us another of
the interminable commentaries
which supposedly comprise an
education on political issues. I
should be very happy to see some
discussion on the issues of poli
tics and education.

CIRCULATION
Editor, The Daily:
Since becoming a student at
Stanford, I have begun to receive
a large number of advertisements
addressed to “Dear Student,”
"Dear Graduate,” etc. The ad
dress used for these advertise
ments was obtained in some way
from Stanford University, most
likely from the University Direc
tory.
I am sure of their source since
all are addressed to Ronald G.
Parsons at my present address.
The only place that has both this
address and my middle initial is
Stanford University.
These advertisements have
ranged from invitations to join
the Peace Corps and Air Force
to an offer to sell contraceptives
and books on sex instruction.
Several other Stanford students
of my acquaintance have also re
ceived these mailings.
It seems to me that the Univer
sity should attempt to limit the
circulation of these address lists.
Perhaps it should be necessary to
be a student or staff member to
purchase a copy of the directory.
I find it very annoying to re
ceive a constant stream of such
unwanted mail. If anyone has
any ideas on how this situation
could be remedied, I would like
to hear from him.
