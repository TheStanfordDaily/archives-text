Editor, The Daily:
This man is unhappy. When he
talks the words do not; flow natu
rally they are agonizingly pre
determined. When he is alone, in
between classes let’s say, he is un
comfortable with himself, and so
he sips at his coffee, hoping that
the time will slip quickly by. And
it never does.
But this human does not accept
the stamp of complete and final
triviality. With a faint hope, he
begins his lonely fight for happi
ness. He begins to feel, sense, and
become constantly aware of the
tenseness in his stomach and the
clenching of his muscles when he
talks to people he doesn’t like. In
stead of perceiving people as
“nice” he learns which kind hurt
him. He learns how a few aggres
sive words directed at him can
determine his mood for the entire
day, and realizes how he fears
people and yet still must look to
them for love.
And this man probes still deep
er, he comes to experience a new

joy in ttio knowledge of himself.
He learns to feel the cool air
sweep down his throat, and the
slow breathing movement of his
chest. And this lone man, fighting
against the rush of events and the
inner tumult, thrusts his arm out
of the internal swamp, grasps a
gnarled old root, and drags him
self out of the dripping muck,
and into the light and air.
But while this man, this intro
spect ionist, wages his lonely and
desparate battle, the American
culture ridicules him and casts
him into a stereotype. To be in
clined to introspection why that
means something is wrong with
myself—so fears our culture. But
although we call introspection a
refuge and a defense, it works.
Through introspection, humans,
people like ourselves, have clawed
their way out of the swamp and
tasted the sunshine, for it is only
through mans’ realization of him
self that he breaks blind fate’s
vise and emerges freer and more
fully human. Donald King
