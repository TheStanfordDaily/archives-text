### Pete King 
In a bit over three weeks, a host of over 125 college tennis
players will descend on the Farm to compete in the 78th NCAA
Tennis Championships.
ABOUT 33 TWOSOMES will l)e vying for the doubles title, in
the first NCAA tournament to he held in Northern California. Over
40 schools will send competitors.
Pre-tournament favorites for team honors will he the California
Big Five schools, notably USC and UCLA. Recently, USC won the
doubles title and UCLA the singles in the AAWU Championships at
Berkeley. Both teams are generally recognized as being the top two
in the country, with Cal rating number three or four.
This puts the fifth-rated Indians in an awkward position. They
have an excellently ranked squad, yet regularly absorb beatings
from their Big Five rivals. Looking at the season record, a casual
observer wouldn’t think that a 7-8 mark should he worth fifth in
the nation.
BUT IT MUST BE remembered that six of the losses were to no
other than USC, UCLA, and Cal. The Trojans heat Stanford 9-0 and
8-1, while UCLA won 8-1 and 6-3.

The Cal matches were the closest,
the Bears winning by 6-3 and 7-2
scores.
Top Card racquet man this sea
son is Yoshi Minegishi. Although
Yoshi has lost more matches than
he has won, he has had to face
such fine netmen as Bill Lenoir of
Arizona, defending National Jun
ior Singles champion, and Larry
Nagler, UCLA, who is the Big
Five singles champ.
However, Minegishi was in top
form against UCLA here a month
ago, dumping Nagler 7-5, 6-4. In
the second Cal match, he defeat
ed Bill Hoogs, top Bear player,
by a 6-2, 9-7 margin.
Minegishi and teammate John
Isaacs have given opponents’
first doubles teams plenty to
worry about. They won their first
doubles match in the AAWU

championships, hut hardy lost the second match in three sets.
ONK OF THE TEAM'S most consistent winners has been Brad
Hodgman. He teamed with John Burt, Johan Horn, Dick Wilson, and
Joe Bates at different times during the season and often saved the
Indians from being shut out.
The seating on the Stanford courts will be upped to 850 for the
final matches of the five-day event. A good-sized crowd is expected
to be on hand to witness what should be an interesting and exciting
tournament.
