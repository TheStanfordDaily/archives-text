# Acrivos to Join Faculty
## 
### 
Andreas Acrivos, a chemical
engineer internationally known
fur his research in the fields of
applied mathematics, and heat
and mass transfer, will join the
Stanford faculty as professor of
chemical engineering next Sep
tember, President Wallace Ster
ling has announced.
Acrivos, now an associate pro
fessor of chemical engineering at
the University of California, has
been on the Berkeley faculty since
1954.
Recently the American Chemi
cal Society awarded Acrivos a
“free imaginative” research
grant for his past outstanding
work in the field of chemical en
gineering research.
His findings have led to a bet
ter understanding of flow prob
lems in chemical fluids of im
poratnce to the chemical, petro
leum, and space industries.
