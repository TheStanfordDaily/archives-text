# Stanford Players Plan 'Measure for Measure'
## 
### 
"Measure for Measure,” Shakes
peare's seldom-produced comedy,
will be presented by the Stanford
Players in Memorial Theatre on
May 31, June 1 and 2 at 8:30 p.m.,
under the direction of Dr, James
Clancy of the Speech and Drama
department.
Although the play did not fare

well in the 19th century because
of its outspoken treatment of sox,
critics of the 20th century have
been more receptive to the drama.
THK PLOT OF “Measure for
Measure’’ deals with the Duke of
Vienna, who appoints Angelo as
his deputy. The Duke then with
draws, returning later in disguise
to observe the deputy’s rigid en
forcement of the laws.
Director Clancy said that “the
play is not easily classifiable as a
tragedy or a comedy, but really
is an ironic ambiguity. Shakes
peare changes the tone from the
very serious emotional involve
ment to the normal aloofness of
satirical comedy in one scene.”
Sets for the play arc based on
the engravings of Albrecht Duer
er, German wood cutter and en
graver of the early 16th century.
THK BASIC TWO STORY per
manent setting will become a
square in Vienna, a subterranean
prison, a friar’s cell, a convent, a
farmhouse and the interior of a
palace by changing props and
lighting effects.
Designer Richard Hay has plan
ned the set for use without a
front stage curtain. “Shakespeare
has to be listened to intently,” he
said, “and I feel that the audi
ence should be familiar with the
setting before the action of the
play starts.
The cast of “Measure for Mea
sure” includes Herbert Kennedy
as Vincentio, the Duke of Vienna,
Richard Risso as Angelo, his dep
uty, and Bonda Lewis as Isabella.
Stanford students are entitled
to a 50-cent discount on all tickets.
Memorial Box Office hours are 11
a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays.


BONDA LEWIS AS ISABELLA and Victor Emeljanow as Lucio act out
a scene from Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure,” the tragi-comedy being presented by the Stanford Players in Memorial
Theatre on May 31, June 1 and June 2.
