# Unusual Grant For Equipment Given by NSF
## 
### 
In an unusual grant to under
graduate education, the National
Science Foundation has just given
$41,210 to Stanfordâ€™s chemistry,
physics and civil engineering de
partments for hard-to-come-by
lab and demonstration equipment.
The University will match this
sum, all of which will be spent
for undergraduate instruction
equipment such as glassware,
spectrophotometers, and prisms,
items which undergraduates need
but can not always get.
The Stanford departments point
out that is is usually not difficult
to get good equipment for gradu
ate students who need it in ad
vanced research.

But undergraduates are poor
relatives since they are not en
gaged in pushing back the fron
tiers of scientific knowledge. In
stead they are learning where the
frontiers lie and where the next
push is likely to come.
The grant to Stanford is one
of 334 totalling over $3,000,000
given by NSF to hard-pressed in
structors in 63 colleges across the
nation. With the grants matched
by each institution, over $10,000,-
000 in equipment will be provided
for improved undergraduate in
struction in the sciences and en
gineering.
