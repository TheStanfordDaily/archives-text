# LASSU to Study Budget, NSA
## 
### 
LASSU tonight will take up the
budget and NSA. The other items
on the agenda were not available
at press time.
Bud Ratts, Financial Manager,
said that LASSU should approve
the remaining items in next
yearâ€™s budget at this meeting.
These arc the appropriations for
Foreign Scholarship Com and
Legislature. Then the entire budg
et can be passed.
NSA could be approved by
LASSU; it could be rejected, but
then it would still have to go to a
student vote; or it could simply
be referred to the students.
According to the ASSU Consti
tution, LASSU will have to ap
prove NSA, or else there will have
to be a student vote on NSA this
quarter. Some action is required
by the 1001-name NSA petition.
