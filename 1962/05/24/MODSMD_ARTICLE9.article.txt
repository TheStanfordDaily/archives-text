# Stanford Group to Work In Mexico
## 
### TOM COLEMAN 
This summer an “amateur Peace Corps”
of about 20 Stanford students will work as
laborers in the construction of a medical
dispensary in Zinapecuaro, a Mexican village
about 100 miles west of Mexico City.
Though the dispensary will stand as the
material symbol of the students’ efforts, the
primary concern of the project directors is
not the “foreign aid” contribution of the
Americans. The chief goal of the summer’s
work will be to establish intracultural rap
port with the townspeople of Zinapecuaro.
Association as workers on an equal foot
ing with the Mexicans will hopefully dispel
the American students’ biases regarding the
“lazy, siesta-loving” Mexican, while the na
tives will have an opportunity to see Ameri
cans who do not represent the image of the
Hawaiian-shirt-and-Bermuda-shorts-clad “ug
ly Gringo.”
MEXICAN FOREMEN will supervise the
Americans, and materials for construction of
the dispensary will be provided by the town.
Thus the propject workers’ effort will not
appear as the sort of condescending charity
that is frequently resented in underdeveloped
areas.
A major portion of the student laborers
are members of the Newman Club, and the
work project’s directors are members of
that organization. However, the project is
not strictly a Catholic enterprise, and the

I dispensary will bo non-sectarian.
| The Stanford group is not the first of its
type to work in Mexico. Several organiza
tions from such eastern colleges as Harvard,
Yale, and Columbia have sent students to
villages and towns throughout Mexico to
work with the people.
KICK MIIILBRECHT, chairman of the
Stanford project, served with 26 students
from Yale last summer, who constructed a
school building in a slum district in Mexico
City. He found the experience extremely re
warding.
When he arrived in Mexico City. Miel
brecht found the area around the school
house site in wretched condition. One section
of the slum was so littered with refuse that
it was dubbed “Garbage Plaza” by the Yale
students.
As. construction of the schoolhouse
progressed, the residents of “Garbage Plaza”
became conscious of the interest the students
had in their living conditions, and by the end
of the summer, the plaza had been thorough
ly cleaned.
The most important accomplishment of
} the Yale group was the establishment of
j rapport between the Mexicans and the Amer
icans. The local residents, especially young
I people and students, developed close friend
j ship with the American laborers, due mainly
to the unpretentious efforts of the project
[ workers, who exhibited none of the airs of

technical experts, social scientists, or charity
workers.
THE MAN BEHIND all the student work
projects is Mario Carota, a physicist at the
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Cal. In
addition to caring for his 18 children (12 of
them adopted), he finds time to coordinate
American student work groups and direct
their construction projects in various parts
of Mexico.
Among Carota’s present activities is the
direction of a Mexican work group in Fowler,
California, a city burdened with many mi
grant labor problems. Such an oportunity for
Mexican students to reciprocate with their
own work projects will go far toward elimi
nating the Mexicans’ often-felt resentment
of American economic superiority.
PARTICIPANTS in the labor projects
cannot expect a summer of vacation fun.
Necessary sacrifices will have to bo made.
Students will receive no more than a sub
sistence diet, and cold water and outdoor
plumbing will be the order of the day. Every
one is expected to work five or six days a
week, at least eight hours per day.
In order to raise funds to help the
project workers meet living expenses in Mex
ico, an informal dinner and musicale will be
held this Sunday at Newman Hall, Cowper
at Melville in Palo Alto. The party will last
from 3:30 to 7:30 p.m., and the cost is $1.50
for adults.
