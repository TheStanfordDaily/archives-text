## 
### 
Although no further word on
finances will he available until
Monday night, the Stanford
group hoping to attend the Com
munist-oriented Helsinki World
Youth Festival has made tenta
tive plans for a briefing session
of five to seven days
While the Independent Research
Service (IRS) is financing as
many of the 2ti Stanford delegates
as possible, the groupâ€™s Financial
Committee expects to hear defi
nite word Monday on gifts from
other private sources.
Fifty Stanford students would
be able to attend if the Commit
tee can raise $19,000 in addition
to IRS money and money pledged
by students.
The planned briefing session
will include seminars on most of
the contemporary critical politi
cal and social issues, from Marx
ism to American race relations.
The session will probably begin
a week before the Festival which
begins on July 27.
The Stanford group will meet
next Tuesday afternoon or eve
ning.
