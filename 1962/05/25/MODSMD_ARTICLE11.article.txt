# Orchesis Gives Free Theme Modern Dance
## 
### 
‘‘Exploration of movement”
rather than a set theme will be
featured in the Orchesis modern
dance programs to be given at
8:30 p.m. tomorrow night and
2:30 p.m. Sunday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Inga Weiss, the former leading
dancer with Mary Wigman’s
group in Berlin, will direct and
participate in the programs.
The Orchesis group has been
dancing together since January,
but most of the members have
been studying in Miss Weiss’
classes since September, when
she came to Stanford.
Also dancing will be Orchesis
members Adele Denig, faculty
member, and Barbara Greer, a
student who has just received a
Fulbright Scholarship to study
dance with Mary Wigman in Ber
lin.
Tickets are $1 for students and
$1.50 for others and are available
at Dinkelspiel box office.
