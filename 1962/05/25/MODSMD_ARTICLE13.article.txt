# Old Hospital Planning to Reopen
## 
### VIVIAN LEE 
Did the designers of the Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital Center “neglect” to estimate
the medical needs of a growing population?
Why is the old Palo Alto Hospital planning
to reopen for full-service use next year? Why
has the pressure for bods increased so much
since 1959?
Only three years ago the 21-million-dollar
medical center was completed at the edge of
the University campus on Pasteur Drive. The
over-crowded Palo Alto Hospital closed its
doors and the patients were shifted to the
new center. This building was uniquely
planned for the benefit of both Stanford and
the city of Palo Alto.
This spring the pressure for beds required
the reopening of a 16-bed ward in the old
hospital, located a mile from the new one,
near El Camino Real between Palm Drive
and Quarry Road. A plan to reactivate the
31-year-old building for full-service use by
1963 awaits approval by the Palo Alto City
Council.
I)K. CLYDE BOICE, present chief of the
Palo Alto Medical Staff, which includes all
the community physicians, explained that
part of the original understanding in the
building of the new hospital center was that
“the old hospital would be I’econditioncd and
continued at its original capacity of 170
beds.”
Three hundred patients crowded the old
Palo Alto Hospital when the Stanford Medi
cal Center opened in 1959. The old building
was intended to hold only 70 beds. Additional
beds had been put in halls, single rooms
were used as doubles, and four Army tem
porary buildings were added to house beds
for 100 more patients.

The Palo Alto Medical Staff has priority
to 221 beds in the Stanford Center, while the
Medical School teaching service has priority
to 213 beds. Since the Stanford service had
so few patients at first “it was not thought
economical to keep open the old hospital
while the now one was half-full,” explained
Dr. William Clark, former chief of the Palo
Alto Staff.
NOW THAT Stanford’s reputation as a
teaching hospital is growing, its patient load
is increasing. This means that Palo Alto has
fewer Stanford beds available and will soon
need more space in the old hospital.
“It takes a while for such a service to be
built up,” Sam Moffat, head of the Center’s
News Bureau, commented about the expan
sion of the Stanford Medical Service.
Stanford’s out patient clinics have in
creased and have brought in more cases.
Specialized research programs in the Medical
School will also call for specific numbers of
beds, said Mr. Moffat.
The National Institute of Health has
made a grant for such a program. It calls
for a unit of 15 beds which will cover a pro
gram for research into cancer therapy.
Other research projects utilizing Stanford
beds are expected to he set up in the future,
THE MEDICAL CENTER hardly felt a
slack in patient load with the opening of the
300-bed El Camino Hospital in Mountain
View last September. This hospital did re
lieve some of the pressure for beds in the
Stanford Center’s Obstetrics and Pediatrics
wards since many young families live out
side Palo Alto in the newer developments in
Sunnyvale, pointed out Dr. Clark. Yet pres
sure in surgical wards remained almost the
same.

Since the El Camino Hospital overlaps
two tax districts more than 50 per cent of its
patients come from the southern end of the
county. Less than 150 beds are free for the
use of the northern part of the county which
includes the district of Los Altos and Los
Altos Hills, Mountain View and Sunnyvale.
Why not build a new wing onto the Medi
cal Center instead of renovating the old
Pal Alto Hospital?
PALO ALTO’S need for additional beds
is immediate. Oliver Deehan, adminis
trator of the Palo Alto Hospital, estimated
that at least three years would be necessary
to plan and construct a new hospital wing.
The reopening of the old hospital is the only
way of solving the pressure for beds.
Dr. Boice figures that a new wing on the
center would cost roughly from $2 1 i to $4M>
million. It should not cost much more than
a half million dollars to reopen the old hos
pital with its 170 beds. “From both the time
and the money angle it is hard to argue
against reopening,” said Dr. Boice.
The old Palo Alto Hospital will operate
as a full-service hospital with complete fa
cilities including laboratories, X-ray, and a
kitchen and food service. It will have an in
tensive care unit and a physical therapy
service.
The Stanford Center will handle all sur
gical cases, however, and the Obstetrics,
Pediatrics and Psychiatric wards will remain
in the Center.
As the plan stands now, awaiting final
approval of the City Council, the building
will bo reconditioned all at one time. Thus
the patients will not have to share the hos
pital with construction machinery, said
Deehan.
