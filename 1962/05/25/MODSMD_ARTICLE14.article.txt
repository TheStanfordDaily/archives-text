# Carpenter Circles Earth Three Times
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL (UPI) Astronaut Scott Carpenter
whirled three times around the earth in his Aurora-7 spaceship
yesterday and then bobbed for three hours in a raft on the Atlan
tic Ocean until a helicopter could pick him up. The 37-year-old
Carpenter, who grew up as self-styled “wild kid’’ in Colorado,

’■faced numerous unexpected prob
lems in his four hours and 56
minutes in space and appeared
unconcerned about the dramatic
ending of his flight.
“I fool fine.” was the only mes
sage he sent back after a heli
copter pilot from the aircraft
carrier Intrepid picked him up at
sea.
THE AURORA-7 overshot the
planned landing area by about 200
miles. The intense heat of the re
entry blacked out radio communi
cations about 12:30 p.m. EST. It
was at least 40 minutes before a
Navy patrol plane found the Navy
lieutenant commander sitting in
his tiny yellow raft.
Navy Capt. J. L. Albert Jr.
piloted the helicopter that picked
Carpenter from his raft at 3:38
p.m. EST and carried him back
to the Intrepid. Three paramedics
had droped to the raft earlier to
be sure that Carpenter was all
right.
CARPENTER met and master
ed space problems which Marine
Lt. Col. John H. Glenn Jr. did not
have to face during the nation’s
first manned orbital flight last
Feb. 20. And his descent far out
side the planned impact area in
the ocean was a harr awing end to
a test of man’s ability to conquer
nature.
But the things that Carpenter
did and saw while whirling three
times around the earth at 17,532
miles per hour will give scien
tists the raw data they need to
build America’s rocket stairway
to the moon.
Carpenter and his Aurora-7
space capsule ran into a variety
of unexpected problems.
His protective, 20-pound space
suit twice got too warm for com
fort. He used a dangerously high
amount of hydrogen peroxide
fuel while maneuvering his cap
sule in space. He found that even
the special ‘‘space food” covered
with a tasteless, edible coating
was apt to be “too crumbly” in the
weightlessness of a world with
out gravity.
HIS TKOUBI.ES with the cap
sule fuel supply may mean that
the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA)
will have to send yet another as
tronaut on a three-orbit flight be
fore undertaking the six or seven
. orbit trips expected later this
, year.
The engines which generate the
Atlas’ 360,000 pounds of thrust
flamed into life at 7:45 a.m. The
nine-story-high space vehicle
. clung to the launching pad for
an agonizing three seconds bc
■ fore it moved ever faster toward
the sky.
The Atlas found the “hoop in
the sky” that put Carpenter’s
space capsule into orbit over Ber
muda. It followed almost the
same path as Glenn’s trailblazing
Friendship-? capsule of Feb. 20.
THE AIRCRAFT carrier In
trepid and her sister ships and
planes waiting to pick Carpenter
from the ocean 80 miles southeast
of Cape Canaveral did not see his
candy-stripe parachute.
