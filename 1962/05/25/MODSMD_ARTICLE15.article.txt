## Paraguay Is Bi-Lingual Country; Indian Influence 
### RICHARD G. OFFUTT 
Upon arrival in Paraguay I was
anxious to start practicing my
Spanish again after several weeks
of Portuguese, but was thorough
ly dismayed by my first conversa
tion with a group of curious
school children. Their quick an
swers revealed that they under
stood me. I, however, could not
distinguish anything they said.
The fact that the Spanish spok
en in South America is very dif
ferent from Castilian is standard
knowledge, but this flood of syl
lables had no similarity whatso
ever to the Spanish I had heard
in Madrid. It seemed as if every
one were talking through their
noses. Moreover, the musical vi
vacity of Spanish was replaced
by a melodious order, comparing
favorably with the efforts of a
former roommate, who had ardu
ously attempted to learn Chinese
at odd hours of the night. The
children slowly took note of my
lack of comprehension, and the
conversation abruptly shifted to
Spanish, although still strongly
nasal.
PARAGUAY is a bi-lingual
country with an official language
and a second tongue of predelic
tion. Those children were speak
ing the latter, Guarini, the lan
guage of the earliest known In
dian inhabitants of this area.
There are many other Indian lan
guages in South America, such as
Machupe in Chile or Quechua in
Bolivia and Peru, but none has
exerted such an influence on the
present form of communication
as Guarini in Paraguay.
I was told that 90 per cent of
the population prefers this Indian
language to Spanish, and my in
itial experience made this readily
credible. Outside of the capital,
although understanding your
questions in Spanish, the resi
dents hopefully answer in Guari
ni. A detailed map of Paraguay
shows a further domination: al
most all of the geographical
names demonstrate the unique
Guarini vowel patterns. In addi
tion, the intensity of the debates
in the bicameral Congress is re

putedly measured by the use of
Guarini in preference to the of
ficial language.
This is a “mother language” in
the truest sense of the word, a
language spoken among intimates
and in the confines of the home.
The quality of extreme confidence j
is manifested in the lack of a
polite form of address, such as'
“Listed” in Spanish or “Sie” in
German. Nine-tenths of the popu
lation is made up of mestizos,
Spanish- or Italian-Indian, and
among the family portraits in any
home you are bound to find an
Indian grandmother or great
grandmother. The early coloniza
tion forces intermarried freely
with the native female popula
tion.
FOR A few members of the
small aristocracy, however, Gu
arini has a negative significance.
I sat down one day in a bus next
to an apparently prosperous and
equally snobbish businessman,
who was traveling with his fam
ily. In the course of our conversa
tion, I asked if he spoke Guarini.
He emphatically denied this, say
ing that it was the “street lan-;
guage” and not spoken by the
more intelligent. When he got out
of the bus, however, I overheard
him addressing his “mucama” or
servant in Guarini.
Even without a knowledge of
Guarini, it is possible to under
stand a great many words, especi
ally the verbs. They are invari
ably in the form of an onomato
poeia, imitating exactly the na
tural sounds connected with an
activity. “Fry” sounds just like I
the bubbling grease in a frying j
pan, and “flow” duplicates pre-1
cisely the murmur of a small;
brook gurgling over its rocky bed.
It was, of course, at first not a
written language, but thanks to !
the initial work of the Jesuits j
there are now many books in Gu
arini, including the New Testa-!
ment. The government also uses 1
the language for propaganda[
posters in rural areas, and a pro- [
fessorship has been instituted at j
the university in Asuncion for the j
preservation of Guarini culture I
and language.

brook gurgling over its rocky bed.
It was, of course, at first not a

Upon arrival in Paraguay I was
anxious to start practicing my
Spanish again after several weeks
of Portuguese, but was thorough
ly dismayed by my first conversa
tion with a group of curious
school children. Their quick an
swers revealed that they under
stood me. I, however, could not
distinguish anything they said.
The fact that the Spanish spok
en in South America is very dif
ferent from Castilian is standard
knowledge, but this flood of syl
lables had no similarity whatso
ever to the Spanish I had heard
in Madrid. It seemed as if every
one were talking through their
noses. Moreover, the musical vi
vacity of Spanish was replaced
by a melodious order, comparing
favorably with the efforts of a
former roommate, who had ardu
ously attempted to learn Chinese
at odd hours of the night. The
children slowly took note of my
lack of comprehension, and the
conversation abruptly shifted to
Spanish, although still strongly
nasal.
PARAGUAY is a bi-lingual
country with an official language
and a second tongue of predelic
tion. Those children were speak
ing the latter, Guarini, the lan
guage of the earliest known In
dian inhabitants of this area.
There are many other Indian lan
guages in South America, such as
Machupe in Chile or Quechua in
Bolivia and Peru, but none has
exerted such an influence on the
present form of communication
as Guarini in Paraguay.
I was told that 90 per cent of
the population prefers this Indian
language to Spanish, and my in
itial experience made this readily
credible. Outside of the capital,
although understanding your
questions in Spanish, the resi
dents hopefully answer in Guari
ni. A detailed map of Paraguay
shows a further domination: al
most all of the geographical
names demonstrate the unique
Guarini vowel patterns. In addi
tion, the intensity of the debates
in the bicameral Congress is re

putedly measured by the use of
Guarini in preference to the of
ficial language.
This is a “mother language” in
the truest sense of the word, a
language spoken among intimates
and in the confines of the home.
The quality of extreme confidence j
is manifested in the lack of a
polite form of address, such as'
“Listed” in Spanish or “Sie” in
German. Nine-tenths of the popu
lation is made up of mestizos,
Spanish- or Italian-Indian, and
among the family portraits in any
home you are bound to find an
Indian grandmother or great
grandmother. The early coloniza
tion forces intermarried freely
with the native female popula
tion.
FOR A few members of the
small aristocracy, however, Gu
arini has a negative significance.
I sat down one day in a bus next
to an apparently prosperous and
equally snobbish businessman,
who was traveling with his fam
ily. In the course of our conversa
tion, I asked if he spoke Guarini.
He emphatically denied this, say
ing that it was the “street lan-;
guage” and not spoken by the
more intelligent. When he got out
of the bus, however, I overheard
him addressing his “mucama” or
servant in Guarini.
Even without a knowledge of
Guarini, it is possible to under
stand a great many words, especi

arini has a negative significance.
I sat down one day in a bus next
to an apparently prosperous and
equally snobbish businessman,
who was traveling with his fam
ily. In the course of our conversa
tion, I asked if he spoke Guarini.
He emphatically denied this, say
ing that it was the “street lan-;
guage” and not spoken by the
more intelligent. When he got out
of the bus, however, I overheard
him addressing his “mucama” or
servant in Guarini.
Even without a knowledge of
Guarini, it is possible to under
stand a great many words, especi
ally the verbs. They are invari
ably in the form of an onomato
poeia, imitating exactly the na
tural sounds connected with an
activity. “Fry” sounds just like I
the bubbling grease in a frying j
pan, and “flow” duplicates pre-1
cisely the murmur of a small;
brook gurgling over its rocky bed.
It was, of course, at first not a
written language, but thanks to !
the initial work of the Jesuits j
there are now many books in Gu
arini, including the New Testa-!
ment. The government also uses 1
the language for propaganda[
posters in rural areas, and a pro- [
fessorship has been instituted at j
the university in Asuncion for the j
preservation of Guarini culture I
and language.
Upon arrival in Paraguay I was
anxious to start practicing my
Spanish again after several weeks
of Portuguese, but was thorough
ly dismayed by my first conversa
tion with a group of curious
school children. Their quick an
swers revealed that they under
stood me. I, however, could not
distinguish anything they said.
The fact that the Spanish spok
en in South America is very dif
ferent from Castilian is standard
knowledge, but this flood of syl
lables had no similarity whatso
ever to the Spanish I had heard
in Madrid. It seemed as if every
one were talking through their
noses. Moreover, the musical vi
vacity of Spanish was replaced
by a melodious order, comparing
favorably with the efforts of a
former roommate, who had ardu
ously attempted to learn Chinese
at odd hours of the night. The
children slowly took note of my
lack of comprehension, and the
conversation abruptly shifted to
Spanish, although still strongly
nasal.
PARAGUAY is a bi-lingual
country with an official language
and a second tongue of predelic
tion. Those children were speak
ing the latter, Guarini, the lan
guage of the earliest known In
dian inhabitants of this area.
There are many other Indian lan
guages in South America, such as
Machupe in Chile or Quechua in
Bolivia and Peru, but none has
exerted such an influence on the
present form of communication
as Guarini in Paraguay.
I was told that 90 per cent of
the population prefers this Indian
language to Spanish, and my in
itial experience made this readily
credible. Outside of the capital,
although understanding your
questions in Spanish, the resi
dents hopefully answer in Guari
ni. A detailed map of Paraguay
shows a further domination: al
most all of the geographical
names demonstrate the unique
Guarini vowel patterns. In addi
tion, the intensity of the debates
in the bicameral Congress is re

putedly measured by the use of
Guarini in preference to the of
ficial language.
This is a “mother language” in
the truest sense of the word, a
language spoken among intimates
and in the confines of the home.
The quality of extreme confidence j
is manifested in the lack of a
polite form of address, such as'
“Listed” in Spanish or “Sie” in
German. Nine-tenths of the popu
lation is made up of mestizos,
Spanish- or Italian-Indian, and
among the family portraits in any
home you are bound to find an
Indian grandmother or great
grandmother. The early coloniza
tion forces intermarried freely
with the native female popula
tion.
