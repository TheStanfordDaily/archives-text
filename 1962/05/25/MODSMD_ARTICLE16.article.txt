NSA
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to make it known that
the use of my article and the as
sociation of my name with the
anti-NSA advertisement in yes
terday’s Daily was wholly unau
thorized and quite unknown to me
prior to its publication. This dis
claimer of association should not
be construed as cither support
for or opposition to the group
placing the advertisement. I do
take issue here with Mr. Jim An
druss’ unsolicited use of my ar
ticle and name in such away as
to imply my present concurrence
with his group, its position, or its
current activities.

BIG ISSUES
Editor, The Daily:
It seems that the BIG issues on
campus this quarter have been
graduate student apathy, co-ed
housing, off-campus housing for
under-graduate women, and liq
uor on campus. l Ignoring, for a
moment, the first-mentioned, it
appears that all the others relate
to the young-man-on-campus’s
(Y.M.0.C.) association (or lack
of) with the opposite (and I blush
to mention the word) sex, and one
might precis the students’ posi
tion on all three thus: “It would
be easier if ”
Consider now the graduate stu
dent, married, living off-campus.
He may well be more interested
in Kennedy’s “Trade or fade” slo
gan than the Y.M.O.C.’s “Liquor
is quicker”-’ and conceivably

doesn't even give two hoots about
women’s housing. He must surely
be considered (a)pathetic.
BUT SHOULD he. spurning the
example of N.S.A., bend his intel
lect to consider campus issues, he
might be sufficiently detached to
give a cool unbiased opinion. He
might feel sufficiently apart from
the student body to consider the
position of the Administration.
From the publicity attendant
on any move the University
makes he might gather the im
pression that Stanford has a con
siderable reputation. Ho might
believe that the reputation would
soon fade if any one of several
facets (e.g. Administration-stu
dent relationships) were less than
good. He could also believe that
news of any policy change would
be spread across the nation via
one news medium or another;
that some people are bound to be
offended.
He might believe that, once
committed to raising 575 million,
the University must “make PACE
or lose face.’’ He might believe
that the best first step toward a
new liquor policy would be the
students’ initiation of a policy of
nothing moi’e intoxicating than
beer on campus, and maintaining
it with strict self-discipline.
HE MIGHT think . . . all sorts
of things, but finding none of the
issues personally pertinent,
chances are he’d be too “apathet
ic” even to write a letter to The
Daily.

and apathy about the I-Center are
all considered only second-class
crises.
