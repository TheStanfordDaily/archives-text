# TROJANS FAVORED
## Nine AAWU Marks May Fall 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
The AAWU Track and Field
Championship tomorrow in Los
Angeles is expected to result in a
frenzy of readjustments in the
record book. At least nine league
records are sure to he broken and
only the half mile, broad jump,
and hop-step-jump marks are un
threatened.
Part of the reason for all the
anticipated bookkeeping activity
is the short, three-year life of the
Big Five. In the previous two
years, some average perform
ances were bound to be good
enough to attain record status,
but as the league gets older, the
really outstanding marks will find
their way into the record hook.
USC’S DALLAS LONG is (he
top performer in the meet. After
erasing his own world shot put
record in the Coliseum Relays last
Friday night with a toss of 65-
10'a, Long is expected to beat his
league record of 63-L tomorrow.
Other outstanding participants
are Washington’s pole vaulter
John Cramer, whose 1962 mark
of 15-6 L is six and a half inches
better than the league record;
Rex Cawley. USC's great quarter
miler and hurdler; Cal’s seven
foot high jumper Gene Johnson;
Stanford’s Dave Weill, who is
just one-half inch under 190 feet
in the discus; USC’s 9.5 and 20.8
sprinter Bruce Munn; Stanford’s
Harry McCalla, an 8:52.7 two
miler; and UCLA's C. K. Yang,
the epitome of versatility.
FIRST PLACE in the meet has
all but been conceded to USC, win
ner for the past two years. Never
theless, Stanford’s red should be
in the winner’s circle several
times as Coach Payton Jordan

is confident that his contingent
of 15 men will live up to their top
performances: if they do, the In
dians should comfortably take
second.
Besides firsts by Weill in (he
discus and McCalla in the three
mile, Stanford has a chance to
win the Javelin. Although USC’s
Jan Sikorsky is the Big Five’s
best 19G2 spear thrower at 250-
s'l>, Stanford’s Art Batchelder, at
241-s'l>, has beaten him twice, in
the Stanford-USC meet and in the
Fresno Relays.
INDIAN fans also can expect a
large contribution of points from
the following performers, who all
have the second-best league
marks for 1962: Rich Klier, 1:50.5
in the half-mile; Ken Emanuels,
47.5 in the 440; Dan Moore, 24-4'-
in the broad Jump; Phil White,
15-’a in the pole vault; and Steve
Cortwright, 46-3 in the hop-step
jump, who will also run both
hurdles. With McCalla running
only (he three-mile, Indian Robin
Ruble will be the second fastest
miler competing, at 4:08.7.
Stanford also has the second
fastest mile relay team of Phil
Lamoreaux, Cortright, Klier, and
Emanuels, 3:12.9. Lamoreaux will
also run both sprints.
OTHER STANFORD athletes
traveling south are: discus throw
er Don Bell, miler Bill Pratt,
three-miler John Northway, high
jumper John Haynie, and shot
putter Steve Arch.
Three others will miss the meet
due to injuries. League leading
broad jumper Chuck Barth has
just had a knee operation; mile
relay and quarter-miler Rich
Chesarek has sinus trouble; and
broad jumper Larry Chukwudehe
has a muscle pull.

FIRST PLACE in the meet has
all but been conceded to USC, win

is confident that his contingent

second.
Besides firsts by Weill in (he
discus and McCalla in the three
mile, Stanford has a chance to
win the Javelin. Although USC’s
Jan Sikorsky is the Big Five’s
best 19G2 spear thrower at 250-
s'l>, Stanford’s Art Batchelder, at
241-s'l>, has beaten him twice, in
the Stanford-USC meet and in the
Fresno Relays.
INDIAN fans also can expect a
large contribution of points from
the following performers, who all
have the second-best league
marks for 1962: Rich Klier, 1:50.5
in the half-mile; Ken Emanuels,
47.5 in the 440; Dan Moore, 24-4'-
in the broad Jump; Phil White,
15-’a in the pole vault; and Steve
Cortwright, 46-3 in the hop-step
jump, who will also run both
hurdles. With McCalla running
only (he three-mile, Indian Robin
Ruble will be the second fastest
miler competing, at 4:08.7.
Stanford also has the second
fastest mile relay team of Phil
Lamoreaux, Cortright, Klier, and
Emanuels, 3:12.9. Lamoreaux will
also run both sprints.
OTHER STANFORD athletes
traveling south are: discus throw

Three others will miss the meet

broad jumper Larry Chukwudehe
