# Big Game Named Year's Top Thrill
## 
### PETE KING 
In more ways than one, 1961-62
has been the Year of the Come
back for Stanford sports. Card
fans have been treated to thrills
aplenty in seeing the Indians rise
from their standing of league
doormat last year to the position
of a major West Coast power
house.

The greatest thrill, as usual,
was Big Game. Something extra
was added this year, however—a
victory. After four straight losses
to the hated Cal Bears and a hu
miliating, 0-10 record last season,
coach Jack Curtice and his crew
engineered a well-earned, 20-7
win.

THK FIRST HALF was played
in a driving rain that turned the
field into a slushy mass of mud,
but didn’t dampen the spirits of
Farm supporters, who got the Axe
back after a four-year dry spell.
Halfback Gary Craig generally
played a whale of a game for
Stanford, slashing through (he
Bear line for an average of seven
yards per carry. He sent the Card
rooting section wild in the second
quarter with a 24-yard gallop
around left end for the Indian’s
second touchdown and a 13-0 lead.
Quarterback Jim Smith and
halfback Stan Lindskog provided
more heroics. Smith connected on
five of seven passes and set up

two touchdowns. Lindskog almost
single-handedly carried the team
76 yards for the clinching Card
score.
OTHKR GRIDIRON thrills in
cluded Chuck Butler’s 47-yard
scoring pass to Larry Royse
against Tulane that broke a two
year drought of football victories.
The 34-0 pasting of Oregon State
touched off an enthusiastic rally
for the returning heroes.
One of the biggest comebacks
was in basketball, wtyere a 7-17
record last year was turned this
year into the first 29-victory sea
son since 1942. No one who was
there will forget the final three
games against USC and UCLA.
The Indians got sweet revenge on
the Trojans, beating them twice
on heart-stopping, come-from-be
hind baskets.
THK BRUINS came to the
Farm having already eliminated
Stanford from the AAWU title,
but the Indians ran circles around
UCLA in a wild first half. A
screaming capacity crowd rattled
the Bruins into making mistake
after mistake, while the Cards
piled up a 51-29 halftime lead.
Baseball and track also offered
their share of excitement to spec
tators. The Stanford nine won
eight in a row. in the process of
sweeping a pair from nationally
ranked USC and making the Tro
jan pitching and fielding look
sick.
Track fans saw three Stanford
records set and witnessed a thrill
ing, 68-63 victory over UCLA and
C. K. Yang.
Yes, altogether it’s been a
thrilling as well as rewarding
year for Stanford sports.

GARY CRAIG
Big Game's Best Back
In more ways than one, 1961-62
has been the Year of the Come
back for Stanford sports. Card
fans have been treated to thrills
aplenty in seeing the Indians rise
from their standing of league
doormat last year to the position
of a major West Coast power
house.

The greatest thrill, as usual,
was Big Game. Something extra
was added this year, however—a
victory. After four straight losses
to the hated Cal Bears and a hu
miliating, 0-10 record last season,
coach Jack Curtice and his crew
engineered a well-earned, 20-7
win.

THK FIRST HALF was played
in a driving rain that turned the
field into a slushy mass of mud,
but didn’t dampen the spirits of
Farm supporters, who got the Axe
back after a four-year dry spell.
Halfback Gary Craig generally
played a whale of a game for
Stanford, slashing through (he
Bear line for an average of seven
yards per carry. He sent the Card
rooting section wild in the second
quarter with a 24-yard gallop
around left end for the Indian’s
second touchdown and a 13-0 lead.
Quarterback Jim Smith and
halfback Stan Lindskog provided
more heroics. Smith connected on
five of seven passes and set up

two touchdowns. Lindskog almost
single-handedly carried the team
76 yards for the clinching Card
score.
OTHKR GRIDIRON thrills in
cluded Chuck Butler’s 47-yard
scoring pass to Larry Royse
against Tulane that broke a two
year drought of football victories.
The 34-0 pasting of Oregon State
touched off an enthusiastic rally
for the returning heroes.
One of the biggest comebacks
was in basketball, wtyere a 7-17
record last year was turned this
year into the first 29-victory sea
son since 1942. No one who was
there will forget the final three
games against USC and UCLA.
