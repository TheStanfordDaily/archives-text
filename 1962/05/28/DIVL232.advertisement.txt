WHAT ABOUT NSA?
NSA proponents say that Stanford and the
World need NSA because NSA is America's only
Student voice; that NSA speaks for a majority of
college students; that Stanford must “catch up
with the twentieth century;’’ that NSA will really
remove the apathy from the Stanford campus; that
we will really recognize our obligations to the
world and we shall be aware of the world when
Stanford joins NSA; that the world wants to know
American student opinion; that American student
opinion will prevent countries from going Com
munist; and that without Stanford belonging to
NSA, none of the above will come to pass.
BUT
IS THE ABOVE NECESSARILY SO?
We Contend Not!
WE CONTEND THAT NSA:
• is not representative;
1. only 17% of college student governments
have joined NSA.
2. this 17% represents less than 25% of all
college students enrolled.
3. only 60% of members send delegates.
THEREFORE, representatives from 15% of the
colleges in the country are passing policy pro
nouncements in the name of all students.
• is not responsible;
1. any group trying to reform organization is
subject to disbarment (NSA congress rules
Art. VI, Sec. I.).
2. the National Executive Committee and / or
the Congress has supported
a. unilateral disarmament
b. Japanese student demonstrations
c. abolition of HUAC
d. sitins, freedom rides
e. federal aid to education
ARE these positions representative of a major
ity of American students?
• is not respected;
1. only recently removed from Attorney Gen

2. Tom Mathai, Indian foreign exchange stu
dents said at the regular LASSU meeting
MAY 24 that while he was in India he
a. never heard of NSA (he considered him
self well informed), until
b. he one day saw some NSA material

EXTENSION OF REMARKS
OF
HON. JOHN M. ASHBROOK
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday , February IS. 1962
The leadership in the National Student Associa
tion has proved itself to be frequently irresponsible,
disrespectful and deceitful. Although its officers are
full-time salaried officials, they are not held respon
sible for their actions during their term of office
when these actions cannot be proved to be directly
connected with the activities of the association. The
national affairs vice president of the National Stu
dent Association demonstrated himself both irrespon
sible and deceitful this fall when he posed as a
reporter for a New York newspaper and became
involved in a racial disturbance in the South. Al
though he was operating in the very field for which
the National Student Association has given him re
sponsibility, his lie and participation in such activity
are excused as being unfortunate, but not relating
to his National Student Association standing.
Booing and jeering are an accepted part of Na
tional Student Association congresses. The assem
blage not only shows a lack of respect for its speakers,
it demonstrates it toward its own members. Many a
speaker at such meetings has had to stop until the
boos subsided. Often it has been the very leadership
of the association which fosters this climate. The
1960-61 international affairs vice president exem
plified the kind of treatment accorded a dissenter
when he handed me his report saying, Compliment
ary copy, not with my compliments —this was on the
first occasion I had to meet him personally.
The 1960-61 president of the association offers
ready examples of deceitfulness in National Student
Association leadership. He told at least two member
schools he would not entertain a motion to refer all
pending legislation to the executive committee, if
one should be made at the congress. Such a resolu
tion was made by his international affairs vice presi
dent, entertained by him, and adopted. It is possible,
of course, that National Student Association had
elected a president unfamiliar with parliamentary
procedure and not aware that his promise would be
difficult to fulfill—and one who neglected to think
the situation through before making such a com
mitment to the groups for which he was responsible
(and which were paying his salary).

The 1960-61 president of the association offers
ready examples of deceitfulness in National Student
Association leadership. He told at least two member
schools he would not entertain a motion to refer all
pending legislation to the executive committee, if
one should be made at the congress. Such a resolu
tion was made by his international affairs vice presi
dent, entertained by him, and adopted. It is possible,
of course, that National Student Association had
elected a president unfamiliar with parliamentary

(and which were paying his salary).

WHAT ABOUT NSA?
NSA proponents say that Stanford and the
World need NSA because NSA is America's only
Student voice; that NSA speaks for a majority of
college students; that Stanford must “catch up
with the twentieth century;’’ that NSA will really
remove the apathy from the Stanford campus; that
we will really recognize our obligations to the
world and we shall be aware of the world when
Stanford joins NSA; that the world wants to know
American student opinion; that American student
opinion will prevent countries from going Com
munist; and that without Stanford belonging to
NSA, none of the above will come to pass.
BUT
IS THE ABOVE NECESSARILY SO?
We Contend Not!
WE CONTEND THAT NSA:
• is not representative;
1. only 17% of college student governments
have joined NSA.
2. this 17% represents less than 25% of all
college students enrolled.
3. only 60% of members send delegates.

colleges in the country are passing policy pro
nouncements in the name of all students.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday , February IS. 1962
The leadership in the National Student Associa
tion has proved itself to be frequently irresponsible,
disrespectful and deceitful. Although its officers are
full-time salaried officials, they are not held respon
sible for their actions during their term of office
when these actions cannot be proved to be directly
connected with the activities of the association. The
national affairs vice president of the National Stu
dent Association demonstrated himself both irrespon
sible and deceitful this fall when he posed as a
reporter for a New York newspaper and became
involved in a racial disturbance in the South. Al
though he was operating in the very field for which
the National Student Association has given him re
sponsibility, his lie and participation in such activity
are excused as being unfortunate, but not relating
to his National Student Association standing.
Booing and jeering are an accepted part of Na
tional Student Association congresses. The assem
blage not only shows a lack of respect for its speakers,
it demonstrates it toward its own members. Many a
speaker at such meetings has had to stop until the
boos subsided. Often it has been the very leadership
of the association which fosters this climate. The
1960-61 international affairs vice president exem

are excused as being unfortunate, but not relating
to his National Student Association standing.
Booing and jeering are an accepted part of Na
tional Student Association congresses. The assem
blage not only shows a lack of respect for its speakers,
it demonstrates it toward its own members. Many a
speaker at such meetings has had to stop until the
boos subsided. Often it has been the very leadership
of the association which fosters this climate. The
1960-61 international affairs vice president exem
plified the kind of treatment accorded a dissenter
when he handed me his report saying, Compliment
ary copy, not with my compliments —this was on the
first occasion I had to meet him personally.
The 1960-61 president of the association offers
ready examples of deceitfulness in National Student
Association leadership. He told at least two member
schools he would not entertain a motion to refer all
pending legislation to the executive committee, if
one should be made at the congress. Such a resolu
tion was made by his international affairs vice presi
dent, entertained by him, and adopted. It is possible,
of course, that National Student Association had
elected a president unfamiliar with parliamentary
procedure and not aware that his promise would be
difficult to fulfill—and one who neglected to think
the situation through before making such a com
mitment to the groups for which he was responsible
(and which were paying his salary).

WHAT ABOUT NSA?
NSA proponents say that Stanford and the
World need NSA because NSA is America's only
Student voice; that NSA speaks for a majority of
college students; that Stanford must “catch up
with the twentieth century;’’ that NSA will really
remove the apathy from the Stanford campus; that
we will really recognize our obligations to the
world and we shall be aware of the world when
Stanford joins NSA; that the world wants to know
American student opinion; that American student
opinion will prevent countries from going Com
munist; and that without Stanford belonging to
NSA, none of the above will come to pass.
BUT
IS THE ABOVE NECESSARILY SO?
We Contend Not!
WE CONTEND THAT NSA:
• is not representative;
1. only 17% of college student governments
have joined NSA.
2. this 17% represents less than 25% of all
college students enrolled.
3. only 60% of members send delegates.
THEREFORE, representatives from 15% of the
colleges in the country are passing policy pro
nouncements in the name of all students.
• is not responsible;
1. any group trying to reform organization is
subject to disbarment (NSA congress rules
Art. VI, Sec. I.).
2. the National Executive Committee and / or
the Congress has supported
a. unilateral disarmament
b. Japanese student demonstrations
c. abolition of HUAC
d. sitins, freedom rides
e. federal aid to education
ARE these positions representative of a major
ity of American students?
• is not respected;
1. only recently removed from Attorney Gen
eral’s list.
2. Tom Mathai, Indian foreign exchange stu
dents said at the regular LASSU meeting
MAY 24 that while he was in India he
a. never heard of NSA (he considered him
self well informed), until
b. he one day saw some NSA material
which, he said, was very much inferior
to Russian material.
c. sees a great parallel between Commu
nist Youth Festival (which he attended
in Vienna, 1958), and NSA convention.
d. feels that Stanford students care little
about international things—this from his
experience as l-CLUB president,
ON the basis of this, the Committee urges you
to Vote NO on NSA.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday , February IS. 1962
The leadership in the National Student Associa
tion has proved itself to be frequently irresponsible,
disrespectful and deceitful. Although its officers are
full-time salaried officials, they are not held respon
sible for their actions during their term of office
when these actions cannot be proved to be directly
connected with the activities of the association. The
national affairs vice president of the National Stu
dent Association demonstrated himself both irrespon
sible and deceitful this fall when he posed as a
reporter for a New York newspaper and became
involved in a racial disturbance in the South. Al
though he was operating in the very field for which
the National Student Association has given him re
