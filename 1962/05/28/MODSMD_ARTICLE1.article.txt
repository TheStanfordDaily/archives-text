# NSA Head Replies to Anti-NSA Argument

### ED GARVEY 
(Editor’s Note: This statement
was sent to The Daily by the pres
ent president of the NSA in an
swer to the cliargcs made by
Charles Lofgren in The Daily last
Tuesday.)

President, National Student

Assoeiation
I have seen the article that ap
peared in The Daily under the
name of Charles Lofgren and am
glad to have this opportunity to
clarify certain issues which were
raised in that article.

NSA makes is statements per
fectly clear concerning its mem
bership and representivity. If you
will notice in the Codification of
Policy, in our press releases, etc.,
we are careful to say, “The Unit
ed States National Student Asso
ciation says . . . or the 14th Na
tional Student Congress says
. . . ” We never claim to repre
sent all American students on a
given subject but we do say that
we are the most representative
national student organization in

the country.
THIS CANNOT be challenged,
in my opinion, as there is no other
organization that even rivals
NSA. This charge comes out
when a certain element in the
congress loses on an issue or dis
agrees violently with the views
expressed by the democratic or
ganization. The extreme left
makes the same charge concern
ing our condemnation of Castro,
our policy on the Helsinki Youth
Festival, and the International
Union of Students, The major
criticisms of the organization
come from the extremes—both
right and left.
NSA represents over one-third
of all accredited institutions of
higher education in the country.
A school that is not accredited
may not join the association. The
number of students enrolled in
NSA schools is approximately
1,300,000. This is nearly or slight
ly over half the students in the
country.
NEARLY ALL the major uni
versities in the country are mem
bers as well as the prestige
schools, i.e., Harvard, Yale, Co
lumbia, Oberlin. Swarthmore,
Smith, Vassar and so on. Purdue,
Northwestern and lowa are the
only Big Ten schools outside the
Association and lowa is probably
on the way in.
(The Big Ten student body pres
idents at a conference recently
passed a resolution praising the
Association for the programming,
publications and other aspects of
the NSA that have strengthened
their student governments.)
All schools do not attend the
Congress despite the fact that we
do everything possible to encour
age them to attend. Many cannot
afford the time or money al
though we have a travel pool for
schools a significant distance
from the site of the Congress.
This year we will give each dele
gate from the West Coast approx
imately $6O-$lOO to help defray
the expenses.
Every organization has inactive
members as well as active. Many
students at Stanford contribute
absolutely nothing to the institu
tion during their four years but
this does not mean that they
should be expelled. We find that
duo to the changing nature of stu
dent bodies, one year a particular
school will be very active and
two years later will not bother to
come to the Congress.
IN SETTING UP the constitu
tion of the NSA it was decided
that the student government is
the only representative voice on
the campus and although few* are
perfect, the student government
is the nearest thing to a repre
sentative voice. It is the organiza
tion on campus (hat negotiates
with the faculty and administra
tion, speaks on behalf of the stu
dent body on issues on and off
campus, etc.
Certainly the Young OEMS or
(he Young GOPS could not speak
for the campus as they are parti
san organizations representing a

vested interest. The question to
be asked is. do we want the U.S.
Festival Committee, YAF, or the
Labor Youth League speaking for
the American students? I say No!
LOFGREN makes false charges
concerning resolutions passed by
the Congress. We did not endorse
the Japanese riots, (At least Stan
ton Evans is more responsible
than the author of this article as
he states the full resolution on
pages 148 and 149 of his “Revolt
on The Campus.’’ I urge people to
read this book, by the way, and
to consider the source.)
WE HAVE NEVER urged any
thing close to unilateral disarma
ment. Check any Codification of
Policy. If students are not con
cerned with the issues discussed
by NSA, it is a sad commentary
on the American student, not the
NSA. If the leaders at member
schools were not interested how
ever, these issues would not be
discussed.
Somehow I think that students
are concerned with civil rights,
academic freedom, civil liberties,
the problems confronting higher
education in this country, the
struggling students in Algeria,
Angola and South Africa. If they
aren’t they had bettor become in
terested while there is a chance
