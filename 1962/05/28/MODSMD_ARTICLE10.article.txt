# Orthesis Group Called Graceful'
## 
### LIZ FREEMAN 
Orchesis, Stanford’s advanced
modern dance group gave imagi
native performances Saturday
evening and Sunday afternoon in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Except for the first number
which tended to become monoto
nous, all of the dances were grace
ful and expressive. Throughout
the numbers dancers would enter
and leave the stage, giving free
dom of movement and the casual
atmosphere of modern dance.
After the first number, the
dancers effectively coordinated
their facial expression and body
movements with the (heme they
were presenting, thus creating
definite moods of solemnity, joy,
restraint and freedom.
Some of the dances were spe
cifically designed to demonstrate
modern dance movements such as
“Etudes” which showed diagonal,
centric, right-left, quartet and
crosswalk motion.
Highlights of the program were
three solos by Inga Weiss, former
leading dancer with Mary Wig
man’s internationally known Ber
lin troupe.
“The Dance of the Seven Exer
cises” particularly showed Miss
Weiss’ expressiveness. Her clown
like movements broke the dra
matic tension of previous per
formances and added humor to
the program. Through exaggera
tion she comically distorted tra
ditionally beautiful ballet move
ments.
Barbara Greer gave an intense
expression of loneliness in her
solo “Alone.” Opening the dance
curled in a heap of despair she
seemed to grasp towards reality
throughout the number.
Dance themes were carried out
by varied and highly original, but
simple, costumes.
The Orchesis group performed
under the direction of Adele
Wenig, modern dance instructor
in the Women's PE Department,
and Miss Weiss.
