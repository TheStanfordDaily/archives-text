QUAD PRAISED
Editor, The Daily;
I wish every Stanford student
could have been with me the past
week and heard the “Oh’s” and
“Ah’s” on two largo campuses of
the midwest. The accolades heap
ed upon the ’62 QUAD by the edi
torial staffs of these big ten and
big seven universities would
thrill them through and through,
I was called in as a consultant
to these people regarding their
own yearbooks. Inasmuch as our
company has produced 1 lie QUAD
for the past five years I grabbed
a copy hot off the press as I
boarded the plane. When asked
what a great University can do to
express its personality in a year
book, I showed this QUAD.
AT THE first campus, these
were 1h e typical comments;
“What a colorful place to go to
school!” “Look at that night
scene of Hoover Tower—how in
the world did they ever set up for
that lightning shot?” “What a
beautiful campus—wish we had
something photogenic like that!"
“Notice how everybody is busy in
those candids—no gaping at the
camera!” “Stanford must have a
terrific budget to put out a book
like this.” (Actually it is less than
the budget of the school where
these comments were made.)
At the second campus the edi
tor and business manager tussled
for a first look. The editor won.
She immediately turned to the
first line of copy, “The Winds of
Freedom Blow” and commented,
“Now there is a theme that
makes sense and look how
they’ve used this art to give the
feeling of the wind.” She turned
to me and asked, “Will they
catch the significance of this
treatment?” All I could say was
that Stanford is loaded with
brains, and I had no doubt but
what the subtleties of this publi
cation would be seen and appre
ciated. She turned to the business
manager and exclaimed, “See!
You don’t have to run in the old
nit—look what Stanford does
LOOK!” I don’t know all the pros
and cons behind that comment,
but I do know that the ’62 QUAD
set that editor on fire.
When the business manager
did get the chance to look, he
turned to the seniors in color, and
he shook his head, “Could we
ever possibly do that, here?” I
told him how Stanford had pi
oneered this feature, how closely
they worked with Keith Cole, a
highly skilled photographer, and
how our own staff had fought the
battle, remaking prints, retouch
ing color separations, and finally
surmounting all delays inherent
in reaching for high quality. I
also told him about Gary Klein
who was the first editor in all the
universities we serve w’ho actual
ly made every deadline on time!
He concluded they might not be
able to do as well.
WHEN THEY saw the double
spread of the swimming pool they
practically shouted in unison,
“That does it!—how do you get
action like that in a color shot?”
On both of these sophisticated
campuses, comments w’ere made
concerning the excellence of the
’62 QUAD. So pronounced were
the enthusiastic expletives, I
though you should know of them
and perhaps share them with
your readers.
From my own recent and vivid
experience with the QUAD it is a
pleasure to tell you what a bril
liant image is cast by Stanford
across the face of America, and
what a thrilling experience it is
to share in the production of a
book that carries this image so ef
fectively. Undoubtedly, this well
communicated image is one rea
son why the National Printers
and Lithographers Association
judged the QUAD to be one of the
six best yearbooks in America
this year. Congratulations!

(Editor’s Nolr; The following
letter was sent to Stanford Presi
dent Wallace Sterling May 16 and
is printed here with permission of
its author. It is in reference to the
Daily’s May 11 editorial concern
ing the forthcoming appearance
of a West Coast edition of the
New York Times.)
SECOND COMING
Editor, The Daily:
I think Stanford is fortunate
in having a superb array of stu
dent publications. I particularly
enjoy perusing The Stanford
Daily, and I congratulate the edi-

tors of The Daily on its vast im
provement over what it was dur
ing by era.
As a newspaperman, I suppose
I have the prerogative and if
not, I am assuming it herewith—
of disagreeing with the editorial
position of The Daily. Regarding
the attached editorial which ap
peared on May 11, I do disagree
with the inference that is stated
in the last paragraph, which I
have underlined.
I certainly would not attempt
to comment here on the merits of
the San Francisco metropolitan
press, but I do staunchly defend
the Los Angeles Times against
any inference that we do not con
sider news as the primary criteri
on for the success of our news
paper.
I personally do not feel that the
New York Times will succeed fi
nancially, regardless of what
they may do editorially or sales
wise in their Western edition. I
do not deem them to be competi
tion in any way, and I certainly
do not feel their arrival will be
greeted as The Second Coming.
I assume this editorial doesn’t
reflect your thinking, because if
it does I would very much like to
send a complimentary air mail
special delivery copy of the Los
Angeles Times to you every day
in order that you might compare
our quality today with that of any
other paper in the country.

< ONGR ATULATIONS
Editor, The Daily;
Congratulations to The Daily
of past years. The Daily proved
so interesting that A1 Kahn in
New York has it flowm to him
yesterday. He is so interested
that upon seeing an advertise
ment using his old NSA article,
he hopped on a jet liner to The
Daily Shack arriving before three
o’clock to give them a letter
(showing an old student body
card). I assume this happened
because I know how strict. The
Daily is about mailed letters.
(There is an ugly rumor that A1
did not fly out here but was
wired about the article and his
telephoned response appeared as
a letter, ugly, ugly.)
The important issue is not if
Mr. Kahn cares if we use his ar
ticle. it is that when the ASSU
was last considering NSA he was
against it and wrote a fine article
telling why. Shouldn’t we know'
why NSA was defeated before?
The main point of the NSA red
hots is that we have a responsi
bility to share our views with
foreign students. Fine! I have but
one question: How does a body in
Madison, Wis., decide the opinion
of American students on such
matters as: the deportation of
Michel N’Doh, a Cameroun stu
dent in France or education in
West Irian, when, in brutal truth,
the majority of American stu
dents do not know or care about
these issues. I am not saying that
it is good they don’t know, but if
we must have someone speaking
for the MAJORITY, that someone
MUST say. “We, the students of
the United States of America,
know little about the number of
students in West Irain and the
quality of their education,” rather
than “We think their education is
inadequate due to the irresponsi
bility of the Dutch.” (Paraphrase
of NSA resolution).

Publicize NSA

(Editor’s Note: Al Kahn was
notified of the unauthorized use
of his article by a telegram sent
him by a friend. His “letter” was
actually a phone conversation
with The Daily. With the publica
tion of this letter and the article
on the front page, we are closing
discussion of NSA in these pages
feeling that all sides have been
adequately represented.)

ENDORSE
Editor, The Daily:
As Rush Chairman for the
Theta Xi fraternity I would like
to endorse Prof. Will Stone's po
sition on the need for abolishing
discrimination, in life. We have
Jews, Negroes, Orientals, Italians.
Mexicans, Armenians, Poles, one
or two white protestants, guys
with acne, short ones, a couple of
Turkeys, one habitual cripple and
the lowest grade point of frater
nity living groups this past quar
ter.

This brings me to our only

point of disagreement. I differ
with Prof. Stone’s belief that
smart people are somehow su
perior, and are therefore to be
preferred as prospective members
of a living group. We deplore the
university’s policy of selective ad
missions, and feel t hat we are be
ing arbitrarily denied the associ
ation of many good men, whose
only lacking quality is their abili
ty to make good grades. Contribu
tors to this mean practice are the
Stanford faculty who subscribe
thoughtlessly to the custom of
rating their students’ perform
ance.
Sharing Prof. Stone’s fondness
for slogans, I would like to pro
pose one of my own:
“All men are good men, just as
all students are good students.”

HEART OF THE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday’s Daily, Prof. Wilfred
Stone put his finger on the heart
of the problem regarding discrim
ination and Sigma Nil’s current
dilemma as to pledging Negroes
and Orientals. The national chap
ter’s discrimination against these
“minority” groups is simply the
symptom of a basic sickness-dis
crimination itself.
As Stone points out, discrimi
nation in a multiplicity of ways
is one of the basic tenets of the
pledging process itself. Pledging
is a discriminatory sorting out
process; it is a projection of its
members insecurity, its psychic
ignorance, its fear-ridden closed
mindedness. Pledging asks: Ate
you good enough for us? Are you
too different? Can we be compla
cently comfortable with you? Can
we understand you? Will we be
afraid of you?
Discrimination will end when
the members of a chapter can
to a “pledge": Because you are
human, we like your humanity.
Because you are “different,” we
can learn. Because you have
needs, we recognize a common
bond. In effect the chapter will
say, we are here to grow, and you
can help us grow. *

The analog of academic free
dom in a fraternity is human free
dom- without fear, without dis
crimination.
Dr. James B. Lyon,
Senior Counselor and Lecturer
Counseling and Testing Center
TWO SENSES
Editor, The Daily:
Doctor Stone confused two
senses of “discrimination.” The
first means judgment, the use of
relevant and adequate evidence.
The second means prejudice, the
use of irrelevant and/or inade
quate relevant evidence.
Agreed, prejudicial discrimina
tion is harmful: it does not fol
low that judicious discrimination
is harmful. If all that be said
against a person is that he is a
“short guy with acne,” then he
must certainly he a saint. Doctor
Stone considered only possibilities
which plead sympathy lor his
cause. He might have continued
his list: boors, gossips, sadists,
drug addicts. . . . Good reasons
can sometimes be given for dis
criminating (judiciously) against
another.
GRANTED, groups of people
exert an evil influence by preju
dicial discrimination: it does not
follow that an open-door policy
does not involve a similarly in
judicious judgment. “Why should
fraternities not be able to accept
the premise that if a man’s good
enough to get into Stanford he’s
good enough for their company?”
Because it is an absurd premise
from which to judge; judging by
it is as uncritical and prejudiced
as judging by skin color. If Doc
tor Stone affirms the value of
judicious discrimination, he must
affirm the value of its use by in
dividuals and groups. He will
seek judicious ways of promoting
its use.
Getting rid of both the possi
bility of judicious and prejudicial
decision would be a “simple” but
not “effective” answer to preju
dice. “Discrimination as a policy"
is not the root of evil. Prejudice
and hate, as an attitude, is; it is
a root which extends beyond the

fraternities. No fiat, no adminis
tration housing policy changes
that.
Surely if there is reason for
abolishing rush, or for going a
small step further and abolishing
even the appearance of a frater
nity, that reason must not be the
abandonment of judgment. Do
not conclude from the fact that
some men in some groups make
gross errors of judgment: judg
ment is evil. Until some carefully
considered, coolly stated, reason
able argument is presented for
the destruction of the fraternities,
why should not the rule be as it is
now: “Let the man choose the
group AND let (he group choose
the man.” Negating either half of
the rule is a denial of freedom.
QUESTION further, whether
the same judicious discrimination
and freedom to decide should not
be a general rule throughout uni
versity housing. Question whet li
ed a university which prides itself
on freedom cannot endure a plur
ality of modes of life.
Patrick Moran
VOICE TO THE CAUSE
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to add my voice to Pro
fessor Stone’s cause, but with the
reservation that he bears no
blame for my voice. In his letter
Friday, Mr. Slone denounced dis
crimination in fraternities against
“turkeys,” etc. on the moral
ground that the University there
by “in effect socially disinherits
a large number of its students.”
This issue is important, but per
haps just as important is the det
riment to University life for the
members of the fraternities and
eating clubs. The detriment is
not, I think, necessarily moral;
for a large number of students
seem to live through their' mem
berships with sufficiently cynical
resignation to retain their moral
sensibilities.
Yet I wonder that so many peo
ple are able to sit through their
fraternity or club meetings dur
ing the rushing season without
feeling horribly cheapened by the
pompous vapidity of discussions,

approvals, and rejections of per
sons with regard to whether they
might be potential “assets to the
club,” or house. That people can
become actively concerned with
their accuracy of discrimination
on the basis of quite superficial
traits in an effort to promote the
virtue or prestige of themselves
and their clubs is a sad and petty
complement to the political, hu
manistic, and less artificial per
sonal concerns of a University

student.
Dr. Stone has called for “moral
courage” in eliminating rush, I
add a call for aesthetic courage
to fight a blighl on the landscape
of our culture at least as revolting
as billboards and tract homes.

cation would be seen and appre
ciated. She turned to the business
manager and exclaimed, “See!
You don’t have to run in the old
nit—look what Stanford does
LOOK!” I don’t know all the pros
and cons behind that comment,
but I do know that the ’62 QUAD
set that editor on fire.
When the business manager
did get the chance to look, he
turned to the seniors in color, and
he shook his head, “Could we
ever possibly do that, here?” I
told him how Stanford had pi
oneered this feature, how closely
they worked with Keith Cole, a
highly skilled photographer, and
how our own staff had fought the
battle, remaking prints, retouch
ing color separations, and finally
surmounting all delays inherent
in reaching for high quality. I
also told him about Gary Klein
who was the first editor in all the
universities we serve w’ho actual
ly made every deadline on time!
He concluded they might not be
able to do as well.
WHEN THEY saw the double
spread of the swimming pool they
practically shouted in unison,
“That does it!—how do you get
action like that in a color shot?”
On both of these sophisticated
campuses, comments w’ere made
concerning the excellence of the
’62 QUAD. So pronounced were
the enthusiastic expletives, I
though you should know of them
and perhaps share them with
your readers.
From my own recent and vivid
experience with the QUAD it is a
pleasure to tell you what a bril
liant image is cast by Stanford
across the face of America, and
what a thrilling experience it is
to share in the production of a
book that carries this image so ef
fectively. Undoubtedly, this well
communicated image is one rea
son why the National Printers
and Lithographers Association
judged the QUAD to be one of the
six best yearbooks in America
this year. Congratulations!

Daily’s May 11 editorial concern
ing the forthcoming appearance

New York Times.)
SECOND COMING
Editor, The Daily:
I think Stanford is fortunate
in having a superb array of stu
dent publications. I particularly
enjoy perusing The Stanford
Daily, and I congratulate the edi-

tors of The Daily on its vast im
provement over what it was dur
ing by era.
As a newspaperman, I suppose
I have the prerogative and if
not, I am assuming it herewith—
of disagreeing with the editorial
position of The Daily. Regarding
the attached editorial which ap
peared on May 11, I do disagree
with the inference that is stated
in the last paragraph, which I
have underlined.
I certainly would not attempt
to comment here on the merits of
the San Francisco metropolitan
press, but I do staunchly defend
the Los Angeles Times against
any inference that we do not con
sider news as the primary criteri
on for the success of our news
paper.
I personally do not feel that the
New York Times will succeed fi
nancially, regardless of what
they may do editorially or sales
wise in their Western edition. I
do not deem them to be competi
tion in any way, and I certainly
do not feel their arrival will be
greeted as The Second Coming.
I assume this editorial doesn’t
reflect your thinking, because if
it does I would very much like to
send a complimentary air mail
special delivery copy of the Los
Angeles Times to you every day
in order that you might compare
our quality today with that of any
other paper in the country.

< ONGR ATULATIONS
Editor, The Daily;
Congratulations to The Daily
of past years. The Daily proved
so interesting that A1 Kahn in
New York has it flowm to him
yesterday. He is so interested
that upon seeing an advertise
ment using his old NSA article,
he hopped on a jet liner to The
Daily Shack arriving before three
o’clock to give them a letter
(showing an old student body
card). I assume this happened
because I know how strict. The
Daily is about mailed letters.
(There is an ugly rumor that A1
did not fly out here but was
wired about the article and his
telephoned response appeared as
a letter, ugly, ugly.)
The important issue is not if
Mr. Kahn cares if we use his ar
ticle. it is that when the ASSU
was last considering NSA he was
against it and wrote a fine article
telling why. Shouldn’t we know'
why NSA was defeated before?
The main point of the NSA red
hots is that we have a responsi
bility to share our views with
foreign students. Fine! I have but
one question: How does a body in
Madison, Wis., decide the opinion
of American students on such
matters as: the deportation of
Michel N’Doh, a Cameroun stu
dent in France or education in
West Irian, when, in brutal truth,
the majority of American stu
dents do not know or care about
these issues. I am not saying that
it is good they don’t know, but if
we must have someone speaking
for the MAJORITY, that someone
MUST say. “We, the students of
the United States of America,
know little about the number of
students in West Irain and the
quality of their education,” rather
than “We think their education is
inadequate due to the irresponsi
bility of the Dutch.” (Paraphrase
of NSA resolution).

notified of the unauthorized use
of his article by a telegram sent
him by a friend. His “letter” was
actually a phone conversation
with The Daily. With the publica
tion of this letter and the article
on the front page, we are closing
discussion of NSA in these pages
feeling that all sides have been
adequately represented.)

ENDORSE
Editor, The Daily:
As Rush Chairman for the
Theta Xi fraternity I would like
to endorse Prof. Will Stone's po
sition on the need for abolishing
discrimination, in life. We have
Jews, Negroes, Orientals, Italians.
Mexicans, Armenians, Poles, one
or two white protestants, guys
with acne, short ones, a couple of
Turkeys, one habitual cripple and
the lowest grade point of frater
nity living groups this past quar
ter.

This brings me to our only

point of disagreement. I differ
with Prof. Stone’s belief that
smart people are somehow su
perior, and are therefore to be
preferred as prospective members
of a living group. We deplore the
university’s policy of selective ad
missions, and feel t hat we are be
ing arbitrarily denied the associ
ation of many good men, whose
only lacking quality is their abili
ty to make good grades. Contribu
tors to this mean practice are the
Stanford faculty who subscribe
thoughtlessly to the custom of
rating their students’ perform
ance.
Sharing Prof. Stone’s fondness
for slogans, I would like to pro
pose one of my own:
“All men are good men, just as
all students are good students.”

HEART OF THE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday’s Daily, Prof. Wilfred
Stone put his finger on the heart
of the problem regarding discrim
ination and Sigma Nil’s current
dilemma as to pledging Negroes
and Orientals. The national chap
ter’s discrimination against these
“minority” groups is simply the
symptom of a basic sickness-dis
crimination itself.
As Stone points out, discrimi
nation in a multiplicity of ways
is one of the basic tenets of the
pledging process itself. Pledging
is a discriminatory sorting out
process; it is a projection of its
members insecurity, its psychic
ignorance, its fear-ridden closed
mindedness. Pledging asks: Ate
you good enough for us? Are you
too different? Can we be compla
cently comfortable with you? Can
we understand you? Will we be
afraid of you?
Discrimination will end when
the members of a chapter can
to a “pledge": Because you are
human, we like your humanity.
Because you are “different,” we
can learn. Because you have
needs, we recognize a common
bond. In effect the chapter will
say, we are here to grow, and you
can help us grow. *

The analog of academic free
dom in a fraternity is human free
dom- without fear, without dis
crimination.
Dr. James B. Lyon,
Senior Counselor and Lecturer
Counseling and Testing Center
TWO SENSES
Editor, The Daily:
Doctor Stone confused two
senses of “discrimination.” The
first means judgment, the use of
relevant and adequate evidence.
The second means prejudice, the
use of irrelevant and/or inade
quate relevant evidence.
Agreed, prejudicial discrimina
tion is harmful: it does not fol
low that judicious discrimination
is harmful. If all that be said
against a person is that he is a
“short guy with acne,” then he
must certainly he a saint. Doctor
Stone considered only possibilities
which plead sympathy lor his
cause. He might have continued
his list: boors, gossips, sadists,
drug addicts. . . . Good reasons
can sometimes be given for dis
criminating (judiciously) against
another.
GRANTED, groups of people
exert an evil influence by preju
dicial discrimination: it does not
follow that an open-door policy
does not involve a similarly in
judicious judgment. “Why should
fraternities not be able to accept
the premise that if a man’s good
enough to get into Stanford he’s
good enough for their company?”
Because it is an absurd premise
from which to judge; judging by
it is as uncritical and prejudiced
as judging by skin color. If Doc
tor Stone affirms the value of
judicious discrimination, he must
affirm the value of its use by in
dividuals and groups. He will
seek judicious ways of promoting
its use.
Getting rid of both the possi
bility of judicious and prejudicial
decision would be a “simple” but
not “effective” answer to preju
dice. “Discrimination as a policy"
is not the root of evil. Prejudice
and hate, as an attitude, is; it is
a root which extends beyond the

fraternities. No fiat, no adminis
tration housing policy changes
that.
Surely if there is reason for
abolishing rush, or for going a
small step further and abolishing
even the appearance of a frater
nity, that reason must not be the
abandonment of judgment. Do
not conclude from the fact that
some men in some groups make
gross errors of judgment: judg
ment is evil. Until some carefully
considered, coolly stated, reason
able argument is presented for
the destruction of the fraternities,
why should not the rule be as it is
now: “Let the man choose the
group AND let (he group choose
the man.” Negating either half of
the rule is a denial of freedom.
QUESTION further, whether
the same judicious discrimination
and freedom to decide should not
be a general rule throughout uni
versity housing. Question whet li
ed a university which prides itself
on freedom cannot endure a plur
ality of modes of life.
Patrick Moran
VOICE TO THE CAUSE
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to add my voice to Pro
fessor Stone’s cause, but with the
reservation that he bears no
blame for my voice. In his letter
Friday, Mr. Slone denounced dis
crimination in fraternities against
“turkeys,” etc. on the moral
ground that the University there
by “in effect socially disinherits
a large number of its students.”
This issue is important, but per
haps just as important is the det
riment to University life for the
members of the fraternities and
eating clubs. The detriment is
not, I think, necessarily moral;
for a large number of students
seem to live through their' mem
berships with sufficiently cynical
resignation to retain their moral
sensibilities.
Yet I wonder that so many peo
ple are able to sit through their
fraternity or club meetings dur
ing the rushing season without
feeling horribly cheapened by the
pompous vapidity of discussions,

approvals, and rejections of per
sons with regard to whether they
might be potential “assets to the
club,” or house. That people can
become actively concerned with
their accuracy of discrimination
on the basis of quite superficial
traits in an effort to promote the
virtue or prestige of themselves
and their clubs is a sad and petty
complement to the political, hu
manistic, and less artificial per
sonal concerns of a University

student.
Dr. Stone has called for “moral
courage” in eliminating rush, I
add a call for aesthetic courage
to fight a blighl on the landscape
of our culture at least as revolting
as billboards and tract homes.
Andy Silver
QUAD PRAISED
Editor, The Daily;
I wish every Stanford student
could have been with me the past
week and heard the “Oh’s” and
“Ah’s” on two largo campuses of
the midwest. The accolades heap
ed upon the ’62 QUAD by the edi
torial staffs of these big ten and
big seven universities would
thrill them through and through,
I was called in as a consultant
to these people regarding their
own yearbooks. Inasmuch as our
company has produced 1 lie QUAD
for the past five years I grabbed
a copy hot off the press as I
boarded the plane. When asked
what a great University can do to
express its personality in a year
book, I showed this QUAD.
AT THE first campus, these
were 1h e typical comments;
“What a colorful place to go to
school!” “Look at that night
scene of Hoover Tower—how in
the world did they ever set up for
that lightning shot?” “What a
beautiful campus—wish we had
something photogenic like that!"
“Notice how everybody is busy in
those candids—no gaping at the
camera!” “Stanford must have a
terrific budget to put out a book
like this.” (Actually it is less than
the budget of the school where
these comments were made.)
At the second campus the edi
tor and business manager tussled
for a first look. The editor won.
She immediately turned to the
first line of copy, “The Winds of
Freedom Blow” and commented,
“Now there is a theme that
makes sense and look how
they’ve used this art to give the
feeling of the wind.” She turned
to me and asked, “Will they
catch the significance of this
treatment?” All I could say was
that Stanford is loaded with
brains, and I had no doubt but
what the subtleties of this publi
cation would be seen and appre
ciated. She turned to the business
manager and exclaimed, “See!
You don’t have to run in the old

and cons behind that comment,

SECOND COMING
Editor, The Daily:
I think Stanford is fortunate
in having a superb array of stu
dent publications. I particularly
enjoy perusing The Stanford
Daily, and I congratulate the edi-

tors of The Daily on its vast im
provement over what it was dur
ing by era.
As a newspaperman, I suppose
I have the prerogative and if
not, I am assuming it herewith—
of disagreeing with the editorial
position of The Daily. Regarding
the attached editorial which ap
peared on May 11, I do disagree
with the inference that is stated
in the last paragraph, which I
have underlined.
I certainly would not attempt
to comment here on the merits of
the San Francisco metropolitan
press, but I do staunchly defend
the Los Angeles Times against
any inference that we do not con
sider news as the primary criteri
on for the success of our news
paper.
I personally do not feel that the
New York Times will succeed fi
nancially, regardless of what
they may do editorially or sales
wise in their Western edition. I
do not deem them to be competi
tion in any way, and I certainly
do not feel their arrival will be
greeted as The Second Coming.
I assume this editorial doesn’t
reflect your thinking, because if
it does I would very much like to
send a complimentary air mail
special delivery copy of the Los
Angeles Times to you every day
in order that you might compare
our quality today with that of any
other paper in the country.

< ONGR ATULATIONS
Editor, The Daily;
Congratulations to The Daily
of past years. The Daily proved
so interesting that A1 Kahn in
New York has it flowm to him
yesterday. He is so interested
that upon seeing an advertise
ment using his old NSA article,
he hopped on a jet liner to The
Daily Shack arriving before three
o’clock to give them a letter
(showing an old student body
card). I assume this happened
because I know how strict. The
Daily is about mailed letters.
(There is an ugly rumor that A1
did not fly out here but was
wired about the article and his
telephoned response appeared as
a letter, ugly, ugly.)
The important issue is not if
Mr. Kahn cares if we use his ar
ticle. it is that when the ASSU
was last considering NSA he was
against it and wrote a fine article
telling why. Shouldn’t we know'
why NSA was defeated before?
The main point of the NSA red
hots is that we have a responsi
bility to share our views with
foreign students. Fine! I have but
one question: How does a body in
Madison, Wis., decide the opinion
of American students on such
matters as: the deportation of
Michel N’Doh, a Cameroun stu
dent in France or education in
West Irian, when, in brutal truth,
the majority of American stu
dents do not know or care about
these issues. I am not saying that
it is good they don’t know, but if
we must have someone speaking
for the MAJORITY, that someone
MUST say. “We, the students of
the United States of America,
know little about the number of
students in West Irain and the
quality of their education,” rather
than “We think their education is
inadequate due to the irresponsi
bility of the Dutch.” (Paraphrase
of NSA resolution).

notified of the unauthorized use
of his article by a telegram sent
him by a friend. His “letter” was
actually a phone conversation

discussion of NSA in these pages
feeling that all sides have been
adequately represented.)

ENDORSE
Editor, The Daily:
As Rush Chairman for the
Theta Xi fraternity I would like
to endorse Prof. Will Stone's po
sition on the need for abolishing
discrimination, in life. We have
Jews, Negroes, Orientals, Italians.
Mexicans, Armenians, Poles, one
or two white protestants, guys
with acne, short ones, a couple of
Turkeys, one habitual cripple and
the lowest grade point of frater
nity living groups this past quar
ter.

This brings me to our only

point of disagreement. I differ
with Prof. Stone’s belief that
smart people are somehow su
perior, and are therefore to be
preferred as prospective members
of a living group. We deplore the
university’s policy of selective ad
missions, and feel t hat we are be
ing arbitrarily denied the associ
ation of many good men, whose
only lacking quality is their abili
ty to make good grades. Contribu
tors to this mean practice are the
Stanford faculty who subscribe
thoughtlessly to the custom of
rating their students’ perform
ance.
Sharing Prof. Stone’s fondness
for slogans, I would like to pro
pose one of my own:
“All men are good men, just as
all students are good students.”

HEART OF THE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday’s Daily, Prof. Wilfred
Stone put his finger on the heart
of the problem regarding discrim
ination and Sigma Nil’s current
dilemma as to pledging Negroes
and Orientals. The national chap
ter’s discrimination against these
“minority” groups is simply the
symptom of a basic sickness-dis
crimination itself.
As Stone points out, discrimi
nation in a multiplicity of ways
is one of the basic tenets of the
pledging process itself. Pledging
is a discriminatory sorting out
process; it is a projection of its
members insecurity, its psychic
ignorance, its fear-ridden closed
mindedness. Pledging asks: Ate
you good enough for us? Are you
too different? Can we be compla
cently comfortable with you? Can
we understand you? Will we be
afraid of you?
Discrimination will end when
the members of a chapter can
to a “pledge": Because you are
human, we like your humanity.
Because you are “different,” we
can learn. Because you have
needs, we recognize a common
bond. In effect the chapter will
say, we are here to grow, and you
can help us grow. *

The analog of academic free
dom in a fraternity is human free
dom- without fear, without dis
crimination.
Dr. James B. Lyon,
Senior Counselor and Lecturer
Counseling and Testing Center
TWO SENSES
Editor, The Daily:
Doctor Stone confused two
senses of “discrimination.” The
first means judgment, the use of
relevant and adequate evidence.
The second means prejudice, the
use of irrelevant and/or inade
quate relevant evidence.
Agreed, prejudicial discrimina
tion is harmful: it does not fol
low that judicious discrimination
is harmful. If all that be said
against a person is that he is a
“short guy with acne,” then he
must certainly he a saint. Doctor
Stone considered only possibilities
which plead sympathy lor his
cause. He might have continued
his list: boors, gossips, sadists,
drug addicts. . . . Good reasons
can sometimes be given for dis
criminating (judiciously) against
another.
GRANTED, groups of people
exert an evil influence by preju
dicial discrimination: it does not
follow that an open-door policy
does not involve a similarly in
judicious judgment. “Why should
fraternities not be able to accept
the premise that if a man’s good
enough to get into Stanford he’s
good enough for their company?”
Because it is an absurd premise
from which to judge; judging by
it is as uncritical and prejudiced
as judging by skin color. If Doc
tor Stone affirms the value of
judicious discrimination, he must
affirm the value of its use by in
dividuals and groups. He will
seek judicious ways of promoting
its use.
Getting rid of both the possi
bility of judicious and prejudicial
decision would be a “simple” but
not “effective” answer to preju
dice. “Discrimination as a policy"
is not the root of evil. Prejudice
and hate, as an attitude, is; it is
a root which extends beyond the

fraternities. No fiat, no adminis
tration housing policy changes
that.
Surely if there is reason for
abolishing rush, or for going a
small step further and abolishing
even the appearance of a frater
nity, that reason must not be the
abandonment of judgment. Do
not conclude from the fact that
some men in some groups make
gross errors of judgment: judg
ment is evil. Until some carefully
considered, coolly stated, reason
able argument is presented for
the destruction of the fraternities,
why should not the rule be as it is
now: “Let the man choose the
group AND let (he group choose
the man.” Negating either half of
the rule is a denial of freedom.
QUESTION further, whether
the same judicious discrimination
and freedom to decide should not
be a general rule throughout uni
versity housing. Question whet li
ed a university which prides itself
on freedom cannot endure a plur
ality of modes of life.
Patrick Moran
VOICE TO THE CAUSE
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to add my voice to Pro
fessor Stone’s cause, but with the
reservation that he bears no
blame for my voice. In his letter
Friday, Mr. Slone denounced dis
crimination in fraternities against
“turkeys,” etc. on the moral
ground that the University there
by “in effect socially disinherits
a large number of its students.”
This issue is important, but per
haps just as important is the det
riment to University life for the
members of the fraternities and
eating clubs. The detriment is
not, I think, necessarily moral;
for a large number of students
seem to live through their' mem
berships with sufficiently cynical
resignation to retain their moral
sensibilities.
Yet I wonder that so many peo
ple are able to sit through their
fraternity or club meetings dur
ing the rushing season without
feeling horribly cheapened by the
pompous vapidity of discussions,

approvals, and rejections of per
sons with regard to whether they
might be potential “assets to the
club,” or house. That people can
become actively concerned with
their accuracy of discrimination
on the basis of quite superficial
traits in an effort to promote the
virtue or prestige of themselves
and their clubs is a sad and petty
complement to the political, hu
manistic, and less artificial per
sonal concerns of a University

student.
Dr. Stone has called for “moral
courage” in eliminating rush, I
add a call for aesthetic courage
to fight a blighl on the landscape
of our culture at least as revolting
as billboards and tract homes.
Andy Silver
QUAD PRAISED
Editor, The Daily;
I wish every Stanford student
could have been with me the past
week and heard the “Oh’s” and
“Ah’s” on two largo campuses of
the midwest. The accolades heap
ed upon the ’62 QUAD by the edi
torial staffs of these big ten and
big seven universities would
thrill them through and through,
I was called in as a consultant
to these people regarding their
own yearbooks. Inasmuch as our
company has produced 1 lie QUAD
for the past five years I grabbed
a copy hot off the press as I
boarded the plane. When asked
what a great University can do to
express its personality in a year
book, I showed this QUAD.
AT THE first campus, these
were 1h e typical comments;
“What a colorful place to go to
school!” “Look at that night
scene of Hoover Tower—how in
the world did they ever set up for
that lightning shot?” “What a
beautiful campus—wish we had
something photogenic like that!"
“Notice how everybody is busy in
those candids—no gaping at the
camera!” “Stanford must have a
terrific budget to put out a book
like this.” (Actually it is less than
the budget of the school where
these comments were made.)
At the second campus the edi
tor and business manager tussled
for a first look. The editor won.
She immediately turned to the
first line of copy, “The Winds of
Freedom Blow” and commented,
“Now there is a theme that
makes sense and look how
they’ve used this art to give the
feeling of the wind.” She turned
to me and asked, “Will they
catch the significance of this
treatment?” All I could say was
that Stanford is loaded with
brains, and I had no doubt but
what the subtleties of this publi
cation would be seen and appre
ciated. She turned to the business
manager and exclaimed, “See!
You don’t have to run in the old
nit—look what Stanford does
LOOK!” I don’t know all the pros
and cons behind that comment,
but I do know that the ’62 QUAD
set that editor on fire.
When the business manager
did get the chance to look, he
turned to the seniors in color, and
he shook his head, “Could we
ever possibly do that, here?” I
told him how Stanford had pi
oneered this feature, how closely
they worked with Keith Cole, a
highly skilled photographer, and
how our own staff had fought the
battle, remaking prints, retouch
ing color separations, and finally
surmounting all delays inherent
in reaching for high quality. I
also told him about Gary Klein
who was the first editor in all the
universities we serve w’ho actual
ly made every deadline on time!
He concluded they might not be
able to do as well.
WHEN THEY saw the double
spread of the swimming pool they
practically shouted in unison,
“That does it!—how do you get
action like that in a color shot?”
On both of these sophisticated
campuses, comments w’ere made
concerning the excellence of the
’62 QUAD. So pronounced were
the enthusiastic expletives, I
though you should know of them
and perhaps share them with
your readers.
From my own recent and vivid
experience with the QUAD it is a
pleasure to tell you what a bril
liant image is cast by Stanford
across the face of America, and
what a thrilling experience it is
to share in the production of a
book that carries this image so ef
fectively. Undoubtedly, this well
communicated image is one rea
son why the National Printers
and Lithographers Association
judged the QUAD to be one of the
six best yearbooks in America
this year. Congratulations!

Editor, The Daily;
Congratulations to The Daily
of past years. The Daily proved
so interesting that A1 Kahn in
New York has it flowm to him
yesterday. He is so interested
that upon seeing an advertise
ment using his old NSA article,
he hopped on a jet liner to The
Daily Shack arriving before three
o’clock to give them a letter
(showing an old student body
card). I assume this happened
because I know how strict. The
Daily is about mailed letters.
(There is an ugly rumor that A1
did not fly out here but was
wired about the article and his
telephoned response appeared as
a letter, ugly, ugly.)
The important issue is not if
Mr. Kahn cares if we use his ar
ticle. it is that when the ASSU
was last considering NSA he was
against it and wrote a fine article
telling why. Shouldn’t we know'
why NSA was defeated before?
The main point of the NSA red
hots is that we have a responsi
bility to share our views with
foreign students. Fine! I have but
one question: How does a body in
Madison, Wis., decide the opinion
of American students on such
matters as: the deportation of
Michel N’Doh, a Cameroun stu
dent in France or education in
West Irian, when, in brutal truth,
the majority of American stu
dents do not know or care about
these issues. I am not saying that
it is good they don’t know, but if
we must have someone speaking
for the MAJORITY, that someone
MUST say. “We, the students of
the United States of America,
know little about the number of
students in West Irain and the
quality of their education,” rather
than “We think their education is
inadequate due to the irresponsi
bility of the Dutch.” (Paraphrase
of NSA resolution).

discussion of NSA in these pages
feeling that all sides have been

ENDORSE
Editor, The Daily:
As Rush Chairman for the
Theta Xi fraternity I would like
to endorse Prof. Will Stone's po
sition on the need for abolishing
discrimination, in life. We have
Jews, Negroes, Orientals, Italians.
Mexicans, Armenians, Poles, one
or two white protestants, guys
with acne, short ones, a couple of
Turkeys, one habitual cripple and
the lowest grade point of frater
nity living groups this past quar
ter.

This brings me to our only

point of disagreement. I differ
with Prof. Stone’s belief that
smart people are somehow su
perior, and are therefore to be
preferred as prospective members
of a living group. We deplore the
university’s policy of selective ad
missions, and feel t hat we are be
ing arbitrarily denied the associ
ation of many good men, whose
only lacking quality is their abili
ty to make good grades. Contribu
tors to this mean practice are the
Stanford faculty who subscribe
thoughtlessly to the custom of
rating their students’ perform
ance.
Sharing Prof. Stone’s fondness
for slogans, I would like to pro
pose one of my own:
“All men are good men, just as
all students are good students.”

HEART OF THE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday’s Daily, Prof. Wilfred
Stone put his finger on the heart
of the problem regarding discrim
ination and Sigma Nil’s current
dilemma as to pledging Negroes
and Orientals. The national chap
ter’s discrimination against these
“minority” groups is simply the
symptom of a basic sickness-dis
crimination itself.
As Stone points out, discrimi
nation in a multiplicity of ways
is one of the basic tenets of the
pledging process itself. Pledging
is a discriminatory sorting out
process; it is a projection of its
members insecurity, its psychic
ignorance, its fear-ridden closed
mindedness. Pledging asks: Ate
you good enough for us? Are you
too different? Can we be compla
cently comfortable with you? Can
we understand you? Will we be
afraid of you?
Discrimination will end when
the members of a chapter can
to a “pledge": Because you are
human, we like your humanity.
Because you are “different,” we
can learn. Because you have
needs, we recognize a common
bond. In effect the chapter will
say, we are here to grow, and you
can help us grow. *

The analog of academic free
dom in a fraternity is human free
dom- without fear, without dis
crimination.

Senior Counselor and Lecturer

TWO SENSES
Editor, The Daily:
Doctor Stone confused two
senses of “discrimination.” The
first means judgment, the use of
relevant and adequate evidence.
The second means prejudice, the
use of irrelevant and/or inade
quate relevant evidence.
Agreed, prejudicial discrimina
tion is harmful: it does not fol
low that judicious discrimination
is harmful. If all that be said
against a person is that he is a
“short guy with acne,” then he
must certainly he a saint. Doctor
Stone considered only possibilities
which plead sympathy lor his
cause. He might have continued
his list: boors, gossips, sadists,
drug addicts. . . . Good reasons
can sometimes be given for dis
criminating (judiciously) against
another.
GRANTED, groups of people
exert an evil influence by preju
dicial discrimination: it does not
follow that an open-door policy
does not involve a similarly in
judicious judgment. “Why should
fraternities not be able to accept
the premise that if a man’s good
enough to get into Stanford he’s
good enough for their company?”
Because it is an absurd premise
from which to judge; judging by
it is as uncritical and prejudiced
as judging by skin color. If Doc
tor Stone affirms the value of
judicious discrimination, he must
affirm the value of its use by in
dividuals and groups. He will
seek judicious ways of promoting
its use.
Getting rid of both the possi
bility of judicious and prejudicial
decision would be a “simple” but
not “effective” answer to preju
dice. “Discrimination as a policy"
is not the root of evil. Prejudice
and hate, as an attitude, is; it is
a root which extends beyond the

fraternities. No fiat, no adminis
tration housing policy changes
that.
Surely if there is reason for
abolishing rush, or for going a
small step further and abolishing
even the appearance of a frater
nity, that reason must not be the
abandonment of judgment. Do
not conclude from the fact that
some men in some groups make
gross errors of judgment: judg
ment is evil. Until some carefully
considered, coolly stated, reason
able argument is presented for
the destruction of the fraternities,
why should not the rule be as it is
now: “Let the man choose the
group AND let (he group choose
the man.” Negating either half of
the rule is a denial of freedom.
QUESTION further, whether
the same judicious discrimination
and freedom to decide should not
be a general rule throughout uni
versity housing. Question whet li
ed a university which prides itself
on freedom cannot endure a plur
ality of modes of life.
Patrick Moran
VOICE TO THE CAUSE
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to add my voice to Pro
fessor Stone’s cause, but with the
reservation that he bears no
blame for my voice. In his letter
Friday, Mr. Slone denounced dis
crimination in fraternities against
“turkeys,” etc. on the moral
ground that the University there
by “in effect socially disinherits
a large number of its students.”
This issue is important, but per
haps just as important is the det
riment to University life for the
members of the fraternities and
eating clubs. The detriment is
not, I think, necessarily moral;
for a large number of students
seem to live through their' mem
berships with sufficiently cynical
resignation to retain their moral
sensibilities.
Yet I wonder that so many peo
ple are able to sit through their
fraternity or club meetings dur
ing the rushing season without
feeling horribly cheapened by the
pompous vapidity of discussions,

approvals, and rejections of per
sons with regard to whether they
might be potential “assets to the
club,” or house. That people can
become actively concerned with
their accuracy of discrimination
on the basis of quite superficial
traits in an effort to promote the
virtue or prestige of themselves
and their clubs is a sad and petty
complement to the political, hu
manistic, and less artificial per
sonal concerns of a University

student.
Dr. Stone has called for “moral
courage” in eliminating rush, I
add a call for aesthetic courage
to fight a blighl on the landscape
of our culture at least as revolting
as billboards and tract homes.

QUAD PRAISED
Editor, The Daily;
I wish every Stanford student
could have been with me the past
week and heard the “Oh’s” and
“Ah’s” on two largo campuses of
the midwest. The accolades heap
ed upon the ’62 QUAD by the edi
torial staffs of these big ten and
big seven universities would
thrill them through and through,
I was called in as a consultant
to these people regarding their
own yearbooks. Inasmuch as our
company has produced 1 lie QUAD
for the past five years I grabbed
a copy hot off the press as I
boarded the plane. When asked
what a great University can do to
express its personality in a year
book, I showed this QUAD.
AT THE first campus, these
were 1h e typical comments;
“What a colorful place to go to
school!” “Look at that night
scene of Hoover Tower—how in
the world did they ever set up for
that lightning shot?” “What a
beautiful campus—wish we had
something photogenic like that!"
“Notice how everybody is busy in
those candids—no gaping at the
camera!” “Stanford must have a
terrific budget to put out a book
like this.” (Actually it is less than
the budget of the school where
these comments were made.)
At the second campus the edi
tor and business manager tussled
for a first look. The editor won.
She immediately turned to the
first line of copy, “The Winds of
Freedom Blow” and commented,
“Now there is a theme that
makes sense and look how
they’ve used this art to give the
feeling of the wind.” She turned
to me and asked, “Will they
catch the significance of this
treatment?” All I could say was
that Stanford is loaded with
brains, and I had no doubt but
what the subtleties of this publi
cation would be seen and appre
ciated. She turned to the business
manager and exclaimed, “See!
You don’t have to run in the old
nit—look what Stanford does
LOOK!” I don’t know all the pros
and cons behind that comment,
but I do know that the ’62 QUAD
set that editor on fire.
When the business manager
did get the chance to look, he
turned to the seniors in color, and
he shook his head, “Could we
ever possibly do that, here?” I
told him how Stanford had pi
oneered this feature, how closely
they worked with Keith Cole, a
highly skilled photographer, and
how our own staff had fought the
battle, remaking prints, retouch
ing color separations, and finally
surmounting all delays inherent
in reaching for high quality. I
also told him about Gary Klein
who was the first editor in all the
universities we serve w’ho actual
ly made every deadline on time!
He concluded they might not be
able to do as well.
WHEN THEY saw the double
spread of the swimming pool they
practically shouted in unison,
“That does it!—how do you get
action like that in a color shot?”
On both of these sophisticated
campuses, comments w’ere made
concerning the excellence of the
’62 QUAD. So pronounced were
the enthusiastic expletives, I
though you should know of them
and perhaps share them with
your readers.
From my own recent and vivid
experience with the QUAD it is a
pleasure to tell you what a bril
liant image is cast by Stanford
across the face of America, and
what a thrilling experience it is
to share in the production of a
book that carries this image so ef
fectively. Undoubtedly, this well
communicated image is one rea
son why the National Printers
and Lithographers Association
judged the QUAD to be one of the
six best yearbooks in America
this year. Congratulations!

SECOND COMING
Editor, The Daily:
I think Stanford is fortunate
in having a superb array of stu

enjoy perusing The Stanford
Daily, and I congratulate the edi-

tors of The Daily on its vast im
provement over what it was dur
ing by era.
As a newspaperman, I suppose
I have the prerogative and if
not, I am assuming it herewith—
of disagreeing with the editorial
position of The Daily. Regarding
the attached editorial which ap
peared on May 11, I do disagree
with the inference that is stated
in the last paragraph, which I
have underlined.
I certainly would not attempt
to comment here on the merits of
the San Francisco metropolitan
press, but I do staunchly defend
the Los Angeles Times against
any inference that we do not con
sider news as the primary criteri
on for the success of our news
paper.
I personally do not feel that the
New York Times will succeed fi
nancially, regardless of what
they may do editorially or sales
wise in their Western edition. I
do not deem them to be competi
tion in any way, and I certainly
do not feel their arrival will be

ENDORSE
Editor, The Daily:
As Rush Chairman for the
Theta Xi fraternity I would like
to endorse Prof. Will Stone's po
sition on the need for abolishing
discrimination, in life. We have
Jews, Negroes, Orientals, Italians.
Mexicans, Armenians, Poles, one
or two white protestants, guys
with acne, short ones, a couple of
Turkeys, one habitual cripple and
the lowest grade point of frater
nity living groups this past quar
ter.

This brings me to our only

point of disagreement. I differ
with Prof. Stone’s belief that
smart people are somehow su
perior, and are therefore to be
preferred as prospective members
of a living group. We deplore the
university’s policy of selective ad
missions, and feel t hat we are be
ing arbitrarily denied the associ
ation of many good men, whose
only lacking quality is their abili
ty to make good grades. Contribu
tors to this mean practice are the
Stanford faculty who subscribe
thoughtlessly to the custom of
rating their students’ perform
ance.
Sharing Prof. Stone’s fondness
for slogans, I would like to pro
pose one of my own:
“All men are good men, just as
all students are good students.”

HEART OF THE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday’s Daily, Prof. Wilfred
Stone put his finger on the heart
of the problem regarding discrim
ination and Sigma Nil’s current
dilemma as to pledging Negroes
and Orientals. The national chap
ter’s discrimination against these
“minority” groups is simply the
symptom of a basic sickness-dis
crimination itself.
As Stone points out, discrimi
nation in a multiplicity of ways
is one of the basic tenets of the
pledging process itself. Pledging
is a discriminatory sorting out
process; it is a projection of its
members insecurity, its psychic
ignorance, its fear-ridden closed
mindedness. Pledging asks: Ate
you good enough for us? Are you
too different? Can we be compla
cently comfortable with you? Can
we understand you? Will we be
afraid of you?
Discrimination will end when
the members of a chapter can
to a “pledge": Because you are
human, we like your humanity.
Because you are “different,” we
can learn. Because you have
needs, we recognize a common
bond. In effect the chapter will
say, we are here to grow, and you
can help us grow. *

The analog of academic free
dom in a fraternity is human free
dom- without fear, without dis
crimination.

Senior Counselor and Lecturer

TWO SENSES
Editor, The Daily:
Doctor Stone confused two
senses of “discrimination.” The
first means judgment, the use of
relevant and adequate evidence.
The second means prejudice, the
use of irrelevant and/or inade
quate relevant evidence.
Agreed, prejudicial discrimina
tion is harmful: it does not fol
low that judicious discrimination
is harmful. If all that be said
against a person is that he is a
“short guy with acne,” then he
must certainly he a saint. Doctor
Stone considered only possibilities
which plead sympathy lor his
cause. He might have continued
his list: boors, gossips, sadists,
drug addicts. . . . Good reasons
can sometimes be given for dis
criminating (judiciously) against
another.
GRANTED, groups of people
exert an evil influence by preju
dicial discrimination: it does not
follow that an open-door policy
does not involve a similarly in
judicious judgment. “Why should
fraternities not be able to accept
the premise that if a man’s good
enough to get into Stanford he’s
good enough for their company?”
Because it is an absurd premise
from which to judge; judging by
it is as uncritical and prejudiced
as judging by skin color. If Doc
tor Stone affirms the value of
judicious discrimination, he must
affirm the value of its use by in
dividuals and groups. He will
seek judicious ways of promoting
its use.
Getting rid of both the possi
bility of judicious and prejudicial
decision would be a “simple” but
not “effective” answer to preju
dice. “Discrimination as a policy"
is not the root of evil. Prejudice
and hate, as an attitude, is; it is
a root which extends beyond the

fraternities. No fiat, no adminis
tration housing policy changes
that.
Surely if there is reason for
abolishing rush, or for going a
small step further and abolishing
even the appearance of a frater
nity, that reason must not be the
abandonment of judgment. Do
not conclude from the fact that
some men in some groups make
gross errors of judgment: judg
ment is evil. Until some carefully
considered, coolly stated, reason
able argument is presented for
the destruction of the fraternities,
why should not the rule be as it is
now: “Let the man choose the
group AND let (he group choose
the man.” Negating either half of
the rule is a denial of freedom.
QUESTION further, whether
the same judicious discrimination
and freedom to decide should not
be a general rule throughout uni
versity housing. Question whet li
ed a university which prides itself
on freedom cannot endure a plur
ality of modes of life.
Patrick Moran
VOICE TO THE CAUSE
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to add my voice to Pro
fessor Stone’s cause, but with the
reservation that he bears no
blame for my voice. In his letter
Friday, Mr. Slone denounced dis
crimination in fraternities against
“turkeys,” etc. on the moral
ground that the University there
by “in effect socially disinherits
a large number of its students.”
This issue is important, but per
haps just as important is the det
riment to University life for the
members of the fraternities and
eating clubs. The detriment is
not, I think, necessarily moral;
for a large number of students
seem to live through their' mem
berships with sufficiently cynical
resignation to retain their moral
sensibilities.
Yet I wonder that so many peo
ple are able to sit through their
fraternity or club meetings dur
ing the rushing season without
feeling horribly cheapened by the
pompous vapidity of discussions,

approvals, and rejections of per
sons with regard to whether they
might be potential “assets to the
club,” or house. That people can
become actively concerned with
their accuracy of discrimination
on the basis of quite superficial
traits in an effort to promote the
virtue or prestige of themselves
and their clubs is a sad and petty
complement to the political, hu
manistic, and less artificial per
sonal concerns of a University

student.
Dr. Stone has called for “moral
courage” in eliminating rush, I
add a call for aesthetic courage
to fight a blighl on the landscape
of our culture at least as revolting
as billboards and tract homes.
Andy Silver
QUAD PRAISED
Editor, The Daily;
I wish every Stanford student
could have been with me the past
week and heard the “Oh’s” and
“Ah’s” on two largo campuses of
the midwest. The accolades heap
ed upon the ’62 QUAD by the edi
torial staffs of these big ten and
big seven universities would
thrill them through and through,
I was called in as a consultant
to these people regarding their
own yearbooks. Inasmuch as our
company has produced 1 lie QUAD
for the past five years I grabbed
a copy hot off the press as I
boarded the plane. When asked
what a great University can do to
express its personality in a year
book, I showed this QUAD.
AT THE first campus, these
were 1h e typical comments;
“What a colorful place to go to
school!” “Look at that night
scene of Hoover Tower—how in
the world did they ever set up for
that lightning shot?” “What a
beautiful campus—wish we had
something photogenic like that!"
“Notice how everybody is busy in
those candids—no gaping at the
camera!” “Stanford must have a
terrific budget to put out a book
like this.” (Actually it is less than
the budget of the school where
these comments were made.)
At the second campus the edi
tor and business manager tussled
for a first look. The editor won.
She immediately turned to the
first line of copy, “The Winds of
Freedom Blow” and commented,
“Now there is a theme that
makes sense and look how
they’ve used this art to give the
feeling of the wind.” She turned
to me and asked, “Will they
catch the significance of this
treatment?” All I could say was
that Stanford is loaded with
brains, and I had no doubt but
what the subtleties of this publi
cation would be seen and appre
ciated. She turned to the business
manager and exclaimed, “See!
You don’t have to run in the old
nit—look what Stanford does
LOOK!” I don’t know all the pros
and cons behind that comment,
but I do know that the ’62 QUAD
set that editor on fire.
When the business manager
did get the chance to look, he
turned to the seniors in color, and
he shook his head, “Could we
ever possibly do that, here?” I
told him how Stanford had pi
oneered this feature, how closely
they worked with Keith Cole, a
highly skilled photographer, and
how our own staff had fought the
battle, remaking prints, retouch
ing color separations, and finally
surmounting all delays inherent
in reaching for high quality. I
also told him about Gary Klein
who was the first editor in all the
universities we serve w’ho actual
ly made every deadline on time!
He concluded they might not be
able to do as well.
WHEN THEY saw the double
spread of the swimming pool they
practically shouted in unison,
“That does it!—how do you get
action like that in a color shot?”
On both of these sophisticated
campuses, comments w’ere made
concerning the excellence of the
’62 QUAD. So pronounced were
the enthusiastic expletives, I
though you should know of them
and perhaps share them with
your readers.
From my own recent and vivid
experience with the QUAD it is a
pleasure to tell you what a bril
liant image is cast by Stanford
across the face of America, and
what a thrilling experience it is
to share in the production of a
book that carries this image so ef
fectively. Undoubtedly, this well
communicated image is one rea
son why the National Printers
and Lithographers Association
judged the QUAD to be one of the
six best yearbooks in America
this year. Congratulations!

SECOND COMING
Editor, The Daily:
I think Stanford is fortunate
in having a superb array of stu
dent publications. I particularly
enjoy perusing The Stanford
Daily, and I congratulate the edi-

tors of The Daily on its vast im
provement over what it was dur
ing by era.
As a newspaperman, I suppose
I have the prerogative and if
not, I am assuming it herewith—
of disagreeing with the editorial
position of The Daily. Regarding
the attached editorial which ap
peared on May 11, I do disagree
with the inference that is stated
in the last paragraph, which I
have underlined.
I certainly would not attempt
to comment here on the merits of
the San Francisco metropolitan
press, but I do staunchly defend
the Los Angeles Times against
any inference that we do not con
sider news as the primary criteri
on for the success of our news
paper.
I personally do not feel that the
New York Times will succeed fi
nancially, regardless of what
they may do editorially or sales
wise in their Western edition. I
do not deem them to be competi
tion in any way, and I certainly
do not feel their arrival will be
greeted as The Second Coming.
I assume this editorial doesn’t
reflect your thinking, because if
it does I would very much like to
send a complimentary air mail
special delivery copy of the Los
Angeles Times to you every day
in order that you might compare
our quality today with that of any
other paper in the country.

Editor, The Daily;
Congratulations to The Daily
of past years. The Daily proved
so interesting that A1 Kahn in
New York has it flowm to him
yesterday. He is so interested
that upon seeing an advertise
ment using his old NSA article,
he hopped on a jet liner to The
Daily Shack arriving before three
o’clock to give them a letter
(showing an old student body
card). I assume this happened
because I know how strict. The
Daily is about mailed letters.
(There is an ugly rumor that A1
did not fly out here but was
wired about the article and his
telephoned response appeared as
a letter, ugly, ugly.)
The important issue is not if
Mr. Kahn cares if we use his ar
ticle. it is that when the ASSU
was last considering NSA he was
against it and wrote a fine article
telling why. Shouldn’t we know'
why NSA was defeated before?
The main point of the NSA red
hots is that we have a responsi
bility to share our views with
foreign students. Fine! I have but
one question: How does a body in
Madison, Wis., decide the opinion
of American students on such
matters as: the deportation of
Michel N’Doh, a Cameroun stu
dent in France or education in
West Irian, when, in brutal truth,
the majority of American stu
dents do not know or care about
these issues. I am not saying that
it is good they don’t know, but if
we must have someone speaking
for the MAJORITY, that someone
MUST say. “We, the students of
the United States of America,
know little about the number of
students in West Irain and the

than “We think their education is

HEART OF THE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday’s Daily, Prof. Wilfred
Stone put his finger on the heart
of the problem regarding discrim
ination and Sigma Nil’s current
dilemma as to pledging Negroes
and Orientals. The national chap
ter’s discrimination against these
“minority” groups is simply the
symptom of a basic sickness-dis
crimination itself.
As Stone points out, discrimi
nation in a multiplicity of ways
is one of the basic tenets of the
pledging process itself. Pledging
is a discriminatory sorting out
process; it is a projection of its
members insecurity, its psychic
ignorance, its fear-ridden closed
mindedness. Pledging asks: Ate
you good enough for us? Are you
too different? Can we be compla
cently comfortable with you? Can
we understand you? Will we be
afraid of you?
Discrimination will end when
the members of a chapter can
to a “pledge": Because you are
human, we like your humanity.
Because you are “different,” we
can learn. Because you have
needs, we recognize a common
bond. In effect the chapter will
say, we are here to grow, and you
can help us grow. *

The analog of academic free
dom in a fraternity is human free
dom- without fear, without dis
crimination.

Senior Counselor and Lecturer

TWO SENSES
Editor, The Daily:
Doctor Stone confused two
senses of “discrimination.” The
first means judgment, the use of
relevant and adequate evidence.
The second means prejudice, the
use of irrelevant and/or inade
quate relevant evidence.
Agreed, prejudicial discrimina
tion is harmful: it does not fol
low that judicious discrimination
is harmful. If all that be said
against a person is that he is a
“short guy with acne,” then he
must certainly he a saint. Doctor
Stone considered only possibilities
which plead sympathy lor his
cause. He might have continued
his list: boors, gossips, sadists,
drug addicts. . . . Good reasons
can sometimes be given for dis
criminating (judiciously) against
another.
GRANTED, groups of people
exert an evil influence by preju
dicial discrimination: it does not
follow that an open-door policy
does not involve a similarly in
judicious judgment. “Why should
fraternities not be able to accept
the premise that if a man’s good
enough to get into Stanford he’s
good enough for their company?”
Because it is an absurd premise
from which to judge; judging by
it is as uncritical and prejudiced
as judging by skin color. If Doc
tor Stone affirms the value of
judicious discrimination, he must
affirm the value of its use by in
dividuals and groups. He will
seek judicious ways of promoting
its use.
Getting rid of both the possi
bility of judicious and prejudicial
decision would be a “simple” but
not “effective” answer to preju
dice. “Discrimination as a policy"
is not the root of evil. Prejudice
and hate, as an attitude, is; it is
a root which extends beyond the

fraternities. No fiat, no adminis
tration housing policy changes
that.
Surely if there is reason for
abolishing rush, or for going a
small step further and abolishing
even the appearance of a frater
nity, that reason must not be the
abandonment of judgment. Do
not conclude from the fact that
some men in some groups make
gross errors of judgment: judg
ment is evil. Until some carefully
considered, coolly stated, reason
able argument is presented for
the destruction of the fraternities,
why should not the rule be as it is
now: “Let the man choose the
group AND let (he group choose
the man.” Negating either half of
the rule is a denial of freedom.
QUESTION further, whether
the same judicious discrimination
and freedom to decide should not
be a general rule throughout uni
versity housing. Question whet li
ed a university which prides itself
on freedom cannot endure a plur
ality of modes of life.
Patrick Moran
VOICE TO THE CAUSE
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to add my voice to Pro
fessor Stone’s cause, but with the
reservation that he bears no
blame for my voice. In his letter
Friday, Mr. Slone denounced dis
crimination in fraternities against
“turkeys,” etc. on the moral
ground that the University there
by “in effect socially disinherits
a large number of its students.”
This issue is important, but per
haps just as important is the det
riment to University life for the
members of the fraternities and
eating clubs. The detriment is
not, I think, necessarily moral;
for a large number of students
seem to live through their' mem
berships with sufficiently cynical
resignation to retain their moral
sensibilities.
Yet I wonder that so many peo
ple are able to sit through their
fraternity or club meetings dur
ing the rushing season without
feeling horribly cheapened by the
pompous vapidity of discussions,

approvals, and rejections of per
sons with regard to whether they
might be potential “assets to the
club,” or house. That people can
become actively concerned with
their accuracy of discrimination
on the basis of quite superficial
traits in an effort to promote the
virtue or prestige of themselves
and their clubs is a sad and petty
complement to the political, hu
manistic, and less artificial per
sonal concerns of a University

student.
Dr. Stone has called for “moral
courage” in eliminating rush, I
add a call for aesthetic courage
to fight a blighl on the landscape
of our culture at least as revolting
as billboards and tract homes.

QUAD PRAISED
Editor, The Daily;
I wish every Stanford student
could have been with me the past
week and heard the “Oh’s” and
“Ah’s” on two largo campuses of
the midwest. The accolades heap
ed upon the ’62 QUAD by the edi
torial staffs of these big ten and
big seven universities would
thrill them through and through,
I was called in as a consultant
to these people regarding their
own yearbooks. Inasmuch as our
company has produced 1 lie QUAD
for the past five years I grabbed
a copy hot off the press as I
boarded the plane. When asked
what a great University can do to
express its personality in a year
book, I showed this QUAD.
AT THE first campus, these
were 1h e typical comments;
“What a colorful place to go to
school!” “Look at that night
scene of Hoover Tower—how in
the world did they ever set up for
that lightning shot?” “What a
beautiful campus—wish we had
something photogenic like that!"
“Notice how everybody is busy in
those candids—no gaping at the
camera!” “Stanford must have a
terrific budget to put out a book
like this.” (Actually it is less than
the budget of the school where
these comments were made.)
At the second campus the edi
tor and business manager tussled
for a first look. The editor won.
She immediately turned to the
first line of copy, “The Winds of
Freedom Blow” and commented,
“Now there is a theme that
makes sense and look how
they’ve used this art to give the
feeling of the wind.” She turned
to me and asked, “Will they
catch the significance of this
treatment?” All I could say was
that Stanford is loaded with
brains, and I had no doubt but
what the subtleties of this publi
cation would be seen and appre
ciated. She turned to the business
manager and exclaimed, “See!
You don’t have to run in the old
nit—look what Stanford does
LOOK!” I don’t know all the pros
and cons behind that comment,
but I do know that the ’62 QUAD
set that editor on fire.
When the business manager
did get the chance to look, he
turned to the seniors in color, and
he shook his head, “Could we
ever possibly do that, here?” I
told him how Stanford had pi
oneered this feature, how closely
they worked with Keith Cole, a
highly skilled photographer, and
how our own staff had fought the
battle, remaking prints, retouch
ing color separations, and finally
surmounting all delays inherent
in reaching for high quality. I
also told him about Gary Klein
who was the first editor in all the
universities we serve w’ho actual
ly made every deadline on time!
He concluded they might not be
able to do as well.
WHEN THEY saw the double
spread of the swimming pool they
practically shouted in unison,
“That does it!—how do you get
action like that in a color shot?”
On both of these sophisticated
campuses, comments w’ere made
concerning the excellence of the
’62 QUAD. So pronounced were
the enthusiastic expletives, I
though you should know of them
and perhaps share them with
your readers.
From my own recent and vivid
experience with the QUAD it is a
pleasure to tell you what a bril
liant image is cast by Stanford
across the face of America, and
what a thrilling experience it is
to share in the production of a
book that carries this image so ef
fectively. Undoubtedly, this well
communicated image is one rea
son why the National Printers
and Lithographers Association
judged the QUAD to be one of the
six best yearbooks in America
this year. Congratulations!

New York Times.)
SECOND COMING
Editor, The Daily:
I think Stanford is fortunate
in having a superb array of stu
dent publications. I particularly
enjoy perusing The Stanford
Daily, and I congratulate the edi-

tors of The Daily on its vast im
provement over what it was dur
ing by era.
As a newspaperman, I suppose
I have the prerogative and if
not, I am assuming it herewith—
of disagreeing with the editorial
position of The Daily. Regarding
the attached editorial which ap
peared on May 11, I do disagree
with the inference that is stated
in the last paragraph, which I
have underlined.
I certainly would not attempt
to comment here on the merits of
the San Francisco metropolitan
press, but I do staunchly defend
the Los Angeles Times against
any inference that we do not con
sider news as the primary criteri
on for the success of our news
paper.
I personally do not feel that the
New York Times will succeed fi
nancially, regardless of what
they may do editorially or sales
wise in their Western edition. I
do not deem them to be competi
tion in any way, and I certainly
do not feel their arrival will be
greeted as The Second Coming.
I assume this editorial doesn’t
reflect your thinking, because if
it does I would very much like to
send a complimentary air mail
special delivery copy of the Los
Angeles Times to you every day
in order that you might compare
our quality today with that of any
other paper in the country.

Editor, The Daily;
Congratulations to The Daily
of past years. The Daily proved
so interesting that A1 Kahn in
New York has it flowm to him
yesterday. He is so interested
that upon seeing an advertise
ment using his old NSA article,
he hopped on a jet liner to The
Daily Shack arriving before three
o’clock to give them a letter
(showing an old student body
card). I assume this happened
because I know how strict. The
Daily is about mailed letters.
(There is an ugly rumor that A1
did not fly out here but was
wired about the article and his
telephoned response appeared as
a letter, ugly, ugly.)
The important issue is not if
Mr. Kahn cares if we use his ar
ticle. it is that when the ASSU
was last considering NSA he was
against it and wrote a fine article
telling why. Shouldn’t we know'
why NSA was defeated before?
The main point of the NSA red
hots is that we have a responsi
bility to share our views with
foreign students. Fine! I have but
one question: How does a body in
Madison, Wis., decide the opinion
of American students on such
matters as: the deportation of
Michel N’Doh, a Cameroun stu
dent in France or education in
West Irian, when, in brutal truth,
the majority of American stu
dents do not know or care about
these issues. I am not saying that
it is good they don’t know, but if
we must have someone speaking
for the MAJORITY, that someone
MUST say. “We, the students of
the United States of America,
know little about the number of
students in West Irain and the
quality of their education,” rather
than “We think their education is
inadequate due to the irresponsi
bility of the Dutch.” (Paraphrase
of NSA resolution).

ENDORSE
Editor, The Daily:
As Rush Chairman for the
Theta Xi fraternity I would like
to endorse Prof. Will Stone's po
sition on the need for abolishing
discrimination, in life. We have
Jews, Negroes, Orientals, Italians.
Mexicans, Armenians, Poles, one
or two white protestants, guys
with acne, short ones, a couple of
Turkeys, one habitual cripple and
the lowest grade point of frater
nity living groups this past quar
ter.

This brings me to our only

point of disagreement. I differ
with Prof. Stone’s belief that
smart people are somehow su
perior, and are therefore to be
preferred as prospective members
of a living group. We deplore the
university’s policy of selective ad
missions, and feel t hat we are be
ing arbitrarily denied the associ
ation of many good men, whose
only lacking quality is their abili
ty to make good grades. Contribu
tors to this mean practice are the
Stanford faculty who subscribe
thoughtlessly to the custom of
rating their students’ perform
ance.
Sharing Prof. Stone’s fondness
for slogans, I would like to pro

is harmful. If all that be said
against a person is that he is a
“short guy with acne,” then he
must certainly he a saint. Doctor
Stone considered only possibilities
which plead sympathy lor his
cause. He might have continued
his list: boors, gossips, sadists,
drug addicts. . . . Good reasons
can sometimes be given for dis
criminating (judiciously) against
another.
GRANTED, groups of people
exert an evil influence by preju
dicial discrimination: it does not
follow that an open-door policy
does not involve a similarly in
judicious judgment. “Why should
fraternities not be able to accept
the premise that if a man’s good
enough to get into Stanford he’s
good enough for their company?”
Because it is an absurd premise
from which to judge; judging by
it is as uncritical and prejudiced
as judging by skin color. If Doc
tor Stone affirms the value of
judicious discrimination, he must
affirm the value of its use by in
dividuals and groups. He will
seek judicious ways of promoting
its use.
Getting rid of both the possi
bility of judicious and prejudicial
decision would be a “simple” but
not “effective” answer to preju
dice. “Discrimination as a policy"
is not the root of evil. Prejudice
and hate, as an attitude, is; it is
a root which extends beyond the

fraternities. No fiat, no adminis
tration housing policy changes
that.
Surely if there is reason for
abolishing rush, or for going a
small step further and abolishing
even the appearance of a frater
nity, that reason must not be the
abandonment of judgment. Do
not conclude from the fact that
some men in some groups make
gross errors of judgment: judg
ment is evil. Until some carefully
considered, coolly stated, reason
able argument is presented for
the destruction of the fraternities,
why should not the rule be as it is
now: “Let the man choose the
group AND let (he group choose
the man.” Negating either half of
the rule is a denial of freedom.
QUESTION further, whether
the same judicious discrimination
and freedom to decide should not
be a general rule throughout uni
versity housing. Question whet li
ed a university which prides itself
on freedom cannot endure a plur
ality of modes of life.
Patrick Moran
VOICE TO THE CAUSE
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to add my voice to Pro
fessor Stone’s cause, but with the
reservation that he bears no
blame for my voice. In his letter
Friday, Mr. Slone denounced dis
crimination in fraternities against
“turkeys,” etc. on the moral
ground that the University there
by “in effect socially disinherits
a large number of its students.”
This issue is important, but per
haps just as important is the det
riment to University life for the
members of the fraternities and
eating clubs. The detriment is
not, I think, necessarily moral;
for a large number of students
seem to live through their' mem
berships with sufficiently cynical
resignation to retain their moral
sensibilities.
Yet I wonder that so many peo
ple are able to sit through their
fraternity or club meetings dur
ing the rushing season without
feeling horribly cheapened by the
pompous vapidity of discussions,

approvals, and rejections of per
sons with regard to whether they
might be potential “assets to the
club,” or house. That people can
become actively concerned with
their accuracy of discrimination
on the basis of quite superficial
traits in an effort to promote the
virtue or prestige of themselves
and their clubs is a sad and petty
complement to the political, hu
manistic, and less artificial per
sonal concerns of a University

student.
Dr. Stone has called for “moral
courage” in eliminating rush, I
add a call for aesthetic courage
to fight a blighl on the landscape
of our culture at least as revolting
as billboards and tract homes.

QUAD PRAISED
Editor, The Daily;
I wish every Stanford student
could have been with me the past
week and heard the “Oh’s” and
“Ah’s” on two largo campuses of
the midwest. The accolades heap
ed upon the ’62 QUAD by the edi
torial staffs of these big ten and
big seven universities would
thrill them through and through,
I was called in as a consultant
to these people regarding their
own yearbooks. Inasmuch as our
company has produced 1 lie QUAD
for the past five years I grabbed
a copy hot off the press as I
boarded the plane. When asked
what a great University can do to
express its personality in a year
book, I showed this QUAD.
AT THE first campus, these
were 1h e typical comments;
“What a colorful place to go to
school!” “Look at that night
scene of Hoover Tower—how in
the world did they ever set up for
that lightning shot?” “What a
beautiful campus—wish we had
something photogenic like that!"
“Notice how everybody is busy in
those candids—no gaping at the
camera!” “Stanford must have a
terrific budget to put out a book
like this.” (Actually it is less than
the budget of the school where
these comments were made.)
At the second campus the edi
tor and business manager tussled
for a first look. The editor won.
She immediately turned to the
first line of copy, “The Winds of
Freedom Blow” and commented,
“Now there is a theme that
makes sense and look how
they’ve used this art to give the
feeling of the wind.” She turned
to me and asked, “Will they
catch the significance of this
treatment?” All I could say was
that Stanford is loaded with
brains, and I had no doubt but
what the subtleties of this publi
cation would be seen and appre
ciated. She turned to the business
manager and exclaimed, “See!
You don’t have to run in the old
nit—look what Stanford does
LOOK!” I don’t know all the pros
and cons behind that comment,
but I do know that the ’62 QUAD
set that editor on fire.
When the business manager
did get the chance to look, he
turned to the seniors in color, and
he shook his head, “Could we
ever possibly do that, here?” I
told him how Stanford had pi
oneered this feature, how closely
they worked with Keith Cole, a
highly skilled photographer, and
how our own staff had fought the
battle, remaking prints, retouch
ing color separations, and finally
surmounting all delays inherent
in reaching for high quality. I
also told him about Gary Klein
who was the first editor in all the
universities we serve w’ho actual
ly made every deadline on time!
He concluded they might not be
able to do as well.
WHEN THEY saw the double
spread of the swimming pool they
practically shouted in unison,
“That does it!—how do you get
action like that in a color shot?”
On both of these sophisticated
campuses, comments w’ere made
concerning the excellence of the
’62 QUAD. So pronounced were
the enthusiastic expletives, I
though you should know of them
and perhaps share them with
your readers.
From my own recent and vivid
experience with the QUAD it is a
pleasure to tell you what a bril
liant image is cast by Stanford
across the face of America, and
what a thrilling experience it is
to share in the production of a
book that carries this image so ef
fectively. Undoubtedly, this well
communicated image is one rea
son why the National Printers
and Lithographers Association
judged the QUAD to be one of the
six best yearbooks in America
this year. Congratulations!

Daily’s May 11 editorial concern
ing the forthcoming appearance
of a West Coast edition of the
New York Times.)
SECOND COMING
Editor, The Daily:
I think Stanford is fortunate
in having a superb array of stu
dent publications. I particularly
enjoy perusing The Stanford
Daily, and I congratulate the edi-

tors of The Daily on its vast im
provement over what it was dur
ing by era.
As a newspaperman, I suppose
I have the prerogative and if
not, I am assuming it herewith—
of disagreeing with the editorial
position of The Daily. Regarding
the attached editorial which ap
peared on May 11, I do disagree
with the inference that is stated
in the last paragraph, which I
have underlined.
I certainly would not attempt
to comment here on the merits of
the San Francisco metropolitan
press, but I do staunchly defend
the Los Angeles Times against
any inference that we do not con
sider news as the primary criteri
on for the success of our news
paper.
I personally do not feel that the
New York Times will succeed fi
nancially, regardless of what
they may do editorially or sales
wise in their Western edition. I
do not deem them to be competi
tion in any way, and I certainly
do not feel their arrival will be
greeted as The Second Coming.
I assume this editorial doesn’t
reflect your thinking, because if
it does I would very much like to
send a complimentary air mail
special delivery copy of the Los
Angeles Times to you every day
in order that you might compare
our quality today with that of any
other paper in the country.

< ONGR ATULATIONS
Editor, The Daily;
Congratulations to The Daily
of past years. The Daily proved
so interesting that A1 Kahn in
New York has it flowm to him
yesterday. He is so interested
that upon seeing an advertise
ment using his old NSA article,
he hopped on a jet liner to The
Daily Shack arriving before three
o’clock to give them a letter
(showing an old student body
card). I assume this happened
because I know how strict. The
Daily is about mailed letters.
(There is an ugly rumor that A1
did not fly out here but was
wired about the article and his
telephoned response appeared as
a letter, ugly, ugly.)
The important issue is not if
Mr. Kahn cares if we use his ar
ticle. it is that when the ASSU
was last considering NSA he was
against it and wrote a fine article
telling why. Shouldn’t we know'
why NSA was defeated before?
The main point of the NSA red
hots is that we have a responsi
bility to share our views with
foreign students. Fine! I have but
one question: How does a body in
Madison, Wis., decide the opinion
of American students on such
matters as: the deportation of
Michel N’Doh, a Cameroun stu
dent in France or education in
West Irian, when, in brutal truth,
the majority of American stu
dents do not know or care about
these issues. I am not saying that
it is good they don’t know, but if
we must have someone speaking
for the MAJORITY, that someone
MUST say. “We, the students of
the United States of America,
know little about the number of
students in West Irain and the
quality of their education,” rather
than “We think their education is
inadequate due to the irresponsi
bility of the Dutch.” (Paraphrase
of NSA resolution).

of his article by a telegram sent

discussion of NSA in these pages
feeling that all sides have been
adequately represented.)

ENDORSE
Editor, The Daily:
As Rush Chairman for the
Theta Xi fraternity I would like
to endorse Prof. Will Stone's po
sition on the need for abolishing
discrimination, in life. We have
Jews, Negroes, Orientals, Italians.
Mexicans, Armenians, Poles, one
or two white protestants, guys
with acne, short ones, a couple of
Turkeys, one habitual cripple and
the lowest grade point of frater
nity living groups this past quar
ter.

This brings me to our only

point of disagreement. I differ
with Prof. Stone’s belief that
smart people are somehow su
perior, and are therefore to be
preferred as prospective members
of a living group. We deplore the
university’s policy of selective ad
missions, and feel t hat we are be
ing arbitrarily denied the associ
ation of many good men, whose
only lacking quality is their abili
ty to make good grades. Contribu
tors to this mean practice are the
Stanford faculty who subscribe
thoughtlessly to the custom of
rating their students’ perform
ance.
Sharing Prof. Stone’s fondness
for slogans, I would like to pro
pose one of my own:
“All men are good men, just as
all students are good students.”

HEART OF THE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday’s Daily, Prof. Wilfred
Stone put his finger on the heart
of the problem regarding discrim
ination and Sigma Nil’s current
dilemma as to pledging Negroes
and Orientals. The national chap
ter’s discrimination against these
“minority” groups is simply the
symptom of a basic sickness-dis
crimination itself.
As Stone points out, discrimi
nation in a multiplicity of ways
is one of the basic tenets of the
pledging process itself. Pledging
is a discriminatory sorting out
process; it is a projection of its
members insecurity, its psychic
ignorance, its fear-ridden closed
mindedness. Pledging asks: Ate
you good enough for us? Are you
too different? Can we be compla
cently comfortable with you? Can
we understand you? Will we be
afraid of you?
Discrimination will end when
the members of a chapter can
to a “pledge": Because you are
human, we like your humanity.
Because you are “different,” we
can learn. Because you have
needs, we recognize a common
bond. In effect the chapter will
say, we are here to grow, and you
can help us grow. *

The analog of academic free
dom in a fraternity is human free
dom- without fear, without dis
crimination.

TWO SENSES
Editor, The Daily:
Doctor Stone confused two
senses of “discrimination.” The
first means judgment, the use of
relevant and adequate evidence.
The second means prejudice, the
use of irrelevant and/or inade
quate relevant evidence.
Agreed, prejudicial discrimina
tion is harmful: it does not fol
low that judicious discrimination
is harmful. If all that be said
against a person is that he is a
“short guy with acne,” then he
must certainly he a saint. Doctor

the destruction of the fraternities,
why should not the rule be as it is

the man.” Negating either half of

QUESTION further, whether

Patrick Moran
VOICE TO THE CAUSE
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to add my voice to Pro
fessor Stone’s cause, but with the
reservation that he bears no
blame for my voice. In his letter
Friday, Mr. Slone denounced dis
crimination in fraternities against
“turkeys,” etc. on the moral
ground that the University there
by “in effect socially disinherits
a large number of its students.”
This issue is important, but per
haps just as important is the det
riment to University life for the
members of the fraternities and
eating clubs. The detriment is
not, I think, necessarily moral;
for a large number of students
seem to live through their' mem
berships with sufficiently cynical
resignation to retain their moral
sensibilities.
Yet I wonder that so many peo
ple are able to sit through their
fraternity or club meetings dur
ing the rushing season without
feeling horribly cheapened by the
pompous vapidity of discussions,

approvals, and rejections of per
sons with regard to whether they
might be potential “assets to the
club,” or house. That people can
become actively concerned with
their accuracy of discrimination
on the basis of quite superficial
traits in an effort to promote the
virtue or prestige of themselves
and their clubs is a sad and petty
complement to the political, hu
manistic, and less artificial per
sonal concerns of a University

student.
Dr. Stone has called for “moral
courage” in eliminating rush, I
add a call for aesthetic courage
to fight a blighl on the landscape
of our culture at least as revolting
as billboards and tract homes.

QUAD PRAISED
Editor, The Daily;
I wish every Stanford student
could have been with me the past
week and heard the “Oh’s” and
“Ah’s” on two largo campuses of
the midwest. The accolades heap
ed upon the ’62 QUAD by the edi
torial staffs of these big ten and
big seven universities would
thrill them through and through,
I was called in as a consultant
to these people regarding their
own yearbooks. Inasmuch as our
company has produced 1 lie QUAD
for the past five years I grabbed
a copy hot off the press as I
boarded the plane. When asked
what a great University can do to
express its personality in a year
book, I showed this QUAD.
AT THE first campus, these
were 1h e typical comments;
“What a colorful place to go to
school!” “Look at that night
scene of Hoover Tower—how in
the world did they ever set up for
that lightning shot?” “What a
beautiful campus—wish we had
something photogenic like that!"
“Notice how everybody is busy in
those candids—no gaping at the
camera!” “Stanford must have a
terrific budget to put out a book
like this.” (Actually it is less than
the budget of the school where
these comments were made.)
At the second campus the edi
tor and business manager tussled
for a first look. The editor won.
She immediately turned to the
first line of copy, “The Winds of
Freedom Blow” and commented,
“Now there is a theme that
makes sense and look how
they’ve used this art to give the
feeling of the wind.” She turned
to me and asked, “Will they
catch the significance of this
treatment?” All I could say was
that Stanford is loaded with
brains, and I had no doubt but
what the subtleties of this publi
cation would be seen and appre
ciated. She turned to the business
manager and exclaimed, “See!
You don’t have to run in the old
nit—look what Stanford does
LOOK!” I don’t know all the pros
and cons behind that comment,
but I do know that the ’62 QUAD
set that editor on fire.
When the business manager
did get the chance to look, he
turned to the seniors in color, and
he shook his head, “Could we
ever possibly do that, here?” I
told him how Stanford had pi
oneered this feature, how closely
they worked with Keith Cole, a
highly skilled photographer, and
how our own staff had fought the
battle, remaking prints, retouch
ing color separations, and finally
surmounting all delays inherent
in reaching for high quality. I
also told him about Gary Klein
who was the first editor in all the
universities we serve w’ho actual
ly made every deadline on time!
He concluded they might not be
able to do as well.
WHEN THEY saw the double
spread of the swimming pool they
practically shouted in unison,
“That does it!—how do you get
action like that in a color shot?”
On both of these sophisticated
campuses, comments w’ere made
concerning the excellence of the
’62 QUAD. So pronounced were
the enthusiastic expletives, I
though you should know of them
and perhaps share them with
your readers.
From my own recent and vivid
experience with the QUAD it is a
pleasure to tell you what a bril
liant image is cast by Stanford
across the face of America, and
what a thrilling experience it is
to share in the production of a
book that carries this image so ef
fectively. Undoubtedly, this well
communicated image is one rea
son why the National Printers
and Lithographers Association
judged the QUAD to be one of the
six best yearbooks in America
this year. Congratulations!

Daily’s May 11 editorial concern
ing the forthcoming appearance

New York Times.)
SECOND COMING
Editor, The Daily:
I think Stanford is fortunate
in having a superb array of stu
dent publications. I particularly
enjoy perusing The Stanford
Daily, and I congratulate the edi-

tors of The Daily on its vast im
provement over what it was dur
ing by era.
As a newspaperman, I suppose
I have the prerogative and if
not, I am assuming it herewith—
of disagreeing with the editorial
position of The Daily. Regarding
the attached editorial which ap
peared on May 11, I do disagree
with the inference that is stated
in the last paragraph, which I
have underlined.
I certainly would not attempt
to comment here on the merits of
the San Francisco metropolitan
press, but I do staunchly defend
the Los Angeles Times against
any inference that we do not con
sider news as the primary criteri
on for the success of our news
paper.
I personally do not feel that the
New York Times will succeed fi
nancially, regardless of what
they may do editorially or sales
wise in their Western edition. I
do not deem them to be competi
tion in any way, and I certainly
do not feel their arrival will be
greeted as The Second Coming.
I assume this editorial doesn’t
reflect your thinking, because if
it does I would very much like to
send a complimentary air mail
special delivery copy of the Los
Angeles Times to you every day
in order that you might compare
our quality today with that of any
other paper in the country.

< ONGR ATULATIONS
Editor, The Daily;
Congratulations to The Daily
of past years. The Daily proved
so interesting that A1 Kahn in
New York has it flowm to him
yesterday. He is so interested
that upon seeing an advertise
ment using his old NSA article,
he hopped on a jet liner to The
Daily Shack arriving before three
o’clock to give them a letter
(showing an old student body
card). I assume this happened
because I know how strict. The
Daily is about mailed letters.
(There is an ugly rumor that A1
did not fly out here but was
wired about the article and his
telephoned response appeared as
a letter, ugly, ugly.)
The important issue is not if
Mr. Kahn cares if we use his ar
ticle. it is that when the ASSU
was last considering NSA he was
against it and wrote a fine article
telling why. Shouldn’t we know'
why NSA was defeated before?
The main point of the NSA red
hots is that we have a responsi
bility to share our views with
foreign students. Fine! I have but
one question: How does a body in
Madison, Wis., decide the opinion
of American students on such
matters as: the deportation of
Michel N’Doh, a Cameroun stu
dent in France or education in
West Irian, when, in brutal truth,
the majority of American stu
dents do not know or care about
these issues. I am not saying that
it is good they don’t know, but if
we must have someone speaking
for the MAJORITY, that someone
MUST say. “We, the students of
the United States of America,
know little about the number of
students in West Irain and the
quality of their education,” rather
than “We think their education is
inadequate due to the irresponsi
bility of the Dutch.” (Paraphrase
of NSA resolution).

notified of the unauthorized use
of his article by a telegram sent
him by a friend. His “letter” was
actually a phone conversation
with The Daily. With the publica
tion of this letter and the article
on the front page, we are closing
discussion of NSA in these pages
feeling that all sides have been
adequately represented.)

ENDORSE
Editor, The Daily:
As Rush Chairman for the
Theta Xi fraternity I would like
to endorse Prof. Will Stone's po
sition on the need for abolishing
discrimination, in life. We have
Jews, Negroes, Orientals, Italians.
Mexicans, Armenians, Poles, one
or two white protestants, guys
with acne, short ones, a couple of
Turkeys, one habitual cripple and
the lowest grade point of frater
nity living groups this past quar
ter.

This brings me to our only

point of disagreement. I differ
with Prof. Stone’s belief that
smart people are somehow su
perior, and are therefore to be
preferred as prospective members
of a living group. We deplore the
university’s policy of selective ad
missions, and feel t hat we are be
ing arbitrarily denied the associ
ation of many good men, whose
only lacking quality is their abili
ty to make good grades. Contribu
tors to this mean practice are the
Stanford faculty who subscribe
thoughtlessly to the custom of
rating their students’ perform
ance.
Sharing Prof. Stone’s fondness
for slogans, I would like to pro
pose one of my own:
“All men are good men, just as
all students are good students.”
Pete Jackson
HEART OF THE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday’s Daily, Prof. Wilfred
Stone put his finger on the heart
of the problem regarding discrim
ination and Sigma Nil’s current
dilemma as to pledging Negroes
and Orientals. The national chap
ter’s discrimination against these
“minority” groups is simply the
symptom of a basic sickness-dis
crimination itself.
As Stone points out, discrimi
nation in a multiplicity of ways
is one of the basic tenets of the
pledging process itself. Pledging
is a discriminatory sorting out
process; it is a projection of its
members insecurity, its psychic
ignorance, its fear-ridden closed
mindedness. Pledging asks: Ate
you good enough for us? Are you
too different? Can we be compla
cently comfortable with you? Can
we understand you? Will we be
afraid of you?
Discrimination will end when
the members of a chapter can
to a “pledge": Because you are
human, we like your humanity.
Because you are “different,” we
can learn. Because you have
needs, we recognize a common
bond. In effect the chapter will
say, we are here to grow, and you
can help us grow. *

The analog of academic free
dom in a fraternity is human free
dom- without fear, without dis
crimination.
Dr. James B. Lyon,
Senior Counselor and Lecturer
Counseling and Testing Center
TWO SENSES
Editor, The Daily:
Doctor Stone confused two
senses of “discrimination.” The
first means judgment, the use of
relevant and adequate evidence.
The second means prejudice, the
use of irrelevant and/or inade
quate relevant evidence.
Agreed, prejudicial discrimina
tion is harmful: it does not fol
low that judicious discrimination
is harmful. If all that be said
against a person is that he is a
“short guy with acne,” then he
must certainly he a saint. Doctor
Stone considered only possibilities
which plead sympathy lor his
cause. He might have continued
his list: boors, gossips, sadists,
drug addicts. . . . Good reasons
can sometimes be given for dis
criminating (judiciously) against
another.
GRANTED, groups of people
exert an evil influence by preju
dicial discrimination: it does not
follow that an open-door policy
does not involve a similarly in
judicious judgment. “Why should
fraternities not be able to accept
the premise that if a man’s good
enough to get into Stanford he’s
good enough for their company?”
Because it is an absurd premise
from which to judge; judging by
it is as uncritical and prejudiced
as judging by skin color. If Doc
tor Stone affirms the value of
judicious discrimination, he must
affirm the value of its use by in
dividuals and groups. He will
seek judicious ways of promoting
its use.
Getting rid of both the possi
bility of judicious and prejudicial
decision would be a “simple” but
not “effective” answer to preju
dice. “Discrimination as a policy"
is not the root of evil. Prejudice
and hate, as an attitude, is; it is
a root which extends beyond the

fraternities. No fiat, no adminis
tration housing policy changes
that.
Surely if there is reason for
abolishing rush, or for going a
small step further and abolishing
even the appearance of a frater
nity, that reason must not be the
abandonment of judgment. Do
not conclude from the fact that
some men in some groups make
gross errors of judgment: judg
ment is evil. Until some carefully
considered, coolly stated, reason
able argument is presented for
the destruction of the fraternities,
why should not the rule be as it is
now: “Let the man choose the
group AND let (he group choose
the man.” Negating either half of
the rule is a denial of freedom.
QUESTION further, whether
the same judicious discrimination
and freedom to decide should not
