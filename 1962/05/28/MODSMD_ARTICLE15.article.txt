# Jordan Stays Here
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan announced Friday that he
will remain here, thereby quash
ing rumors that he would become
head coach at USC. After the
death of Trojan coach Jess Mor
tenson, it had been thought that
Jordan would accept a bid to re
turn to his alma mater and head
the USC track squad.
A long period of evaluation of
his position at Stanford went into
the decision, according to Jordan.
He feels that Stanford’s policy on
athletics coincides with his own.
“Stanford wants to do a better
than average job, desiring success
both in athletics and academics,”

said Jordan. “The university is
seeking to bring top track and
field athletes here, which is what
I have tried to do.”
Jordan believes that Stanford
is interested in developing the
physical side of the Stanford man,
and thinks (hat athletics is a
critical stage for education and
the development of personality.
Previous to being here as head
track coach for six years, he had
been a sprinter for USC, once
running the TOO in 9.4. He had
been under pleasure to replace
acting Trojan coach Jess Hill,
who wants to devote more time
to his position as athletic direc
tor.
