# Radio and TV Move to C & J Department
## 
### 
A broadcasting and film divi
sion will be added to Stanford’s
Department of Communication
and Journalism next fall as part
of a reorganization of the depart
ment.
The move combines three exist
ing units and moves the broad
casting and film activities from
the Speech and Drama Depart
ment.
Prof. Stanley Dormer will take
over as associate head of the C-J
Department in charge of the
broadcasting and film unit. Prof.
Clifford Weigle will continue as
executive head of the department,
and Prof. Wilbur Schramm as di
rector of the Institute for Com
munication Research.
“The reorganization was pro
posed,” Weigle said, “because all
three units train students for pro
fessional careers in the mass me
dia; they share a common core of
theory and research methodology,
and because the unification will
make it easier to house them un
der one roof in the near future.”
The first of a series of new
faculty members appointed is Ed
win B. Parker, assistant profes
sor of communication. Parker,
who earned advanced degrees
here, is a graduate of the Univer
sity of British Columbia.
At present he is a member of
the faculty at the University of
Illinois and a research assistant
at Ul’s Institute of Communica
tion Research.
He has been a reporter on the
Vancouver Sun and information
officer at ÜBC.
