# U.S. Says Plane Was Sabotaged

WASHINGTON (UPI) The
government’s “air detectives”
have once more proved that sab
otaging an airliner is NOT the
perfect crime.
This was one comforting con
clusion drawn from disclosure
that a man-made bomb probably
caused the crash of a Continental
Airlines Boeing 707 jetliner near
Centerville, lowa, Tuesday night.
The tentative solution was a
classic example of the mistake a
saboteur makes—the mistaken be
lief that an airliner’s shattered
wreckage will hide all clues and
obliterate all evidence. It has not
in previous cases of aircraft sabo
tage and it did not in the case of
the Continental plane.
THIS IS HOW the Civil Aero
nautics Board (CAB) came to the
bomb theory, which it described
cautiously as “an explosive force
of unknown origin;”
• The first clue was the dis
covery of a hostess seat and hos
tess flight manuals more than
100 miles from the main wreck
age.
The seat was one normally lo
cated in the rear of the 707 and
this led to early concentration on
the possibility of an explosion in
the aft section.
• The pattern of wreckage pro
vided additional evidence of such
an explosion. The tail was found
some distance from the fuselage.
Both were in relatively large seg
ments. But wreckage from the
area between the tail and the
main cabin structure was in tiny
shreds. This indicated that the
force necessary to snap the tail
was of a shattering variety, rath
er than the clean break that
would have come from a structur
al failure.
• FROM WASHINGTON,
where experts were examining
the 707’s flight recorder, came
word that the device showed no
evidence of violent gust loads.
This discounted previous beliefs
that the jet had encountered ex
treme turbulence and broke up
from excessive stresses. In addi
tion, the last recorded transmis
sions from the flight showed the
plane apparently was being
steered successfully through the
worst of the storm area.
• The dwindling evidence of
turbulence was coupled with
mounting evidence of some kind
of explosion. Smudges bearing a
marked odor were found on metal
fragments from the area where
the tail had separated from the
rest of the fuselage. Apparent
powder burns were on some
bodies.
The CAB hopes to have more
conclusive evidence from two
sources. First will be the mockup
of the rear section, now under
construction in an old county fair
exhibit building near the crash
scene. The second will bo labora
tory analysis of the smudges
found on wreckage fragments.
FROM A DISTANCE, a mock
up can look startlingly like an
undamaged aircraft. But close up
it provides an accurate picture of
how the damage was sustained,
particularly in the case of an ex
plosive force.
In the 1953 bombing of a United
DC6 over Colorado, the mockup
finally took the shape of a rea
sonably complete aircraft—except
for a jagged hole on the right
side near the tail. This was where
the number four baggage bin
would have been located. It was
quickly clear that the explosion
was generated in this area. The
subsequent investigation concen
trated on baggage that had been
loaded at Denver, the flight's last
departure point, and led to appre
hension of the killer.
