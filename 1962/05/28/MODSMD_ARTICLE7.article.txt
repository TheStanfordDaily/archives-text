# Carpenter Space Voyage 'As Easy as a Bus Ride'

### 
CAPE CANAVERAL (UPl)—Astronaut Scott Carpenter gave a
"report of a working astronaut to the nation” yesterday and de
scribed his triple orbital flight as a thrilling experience which pro
duced information that will help man reach the moon.
The astronaut returned to the United States yesterday from
Grand Turk Island in the Bahamas and told a news conference his
space voyage Thursday was the fastest five hours he had ever
experienced.
WEIGHTLESSNESS MADE every function of the space pilot
in orbit easier to carry out, he said, and added that the period of
weightlessness was the “only time I have ever been comfortable in
the space suit.”
Operating in a weightless condition in the suit which is so
cumbersome on the ground was more comfortable than being home
in bed, he said.
Carpenter also said that he disagreed with America’s first
orbital astronaut, John H. Glenn Jr., on the nature of the “fireflies”

which Glenn detected in his February journey around the earth.
Glenn is convinced that the particles are luminous and originate
outside the space capsule.
“I BELIEVE THAT these particles come from the capsule,”
Carpenter said. ‘‘John and I argued. He believes his are luminous.
My particles are not,” Carpenter said amid laughter.
His theory was, he said, that the particles originated in frost
which formed on the space capsule and broke off when he rapped on
the side of it during the flight.
The 37-year-old astronaut was greeted by his pretty, blonde wife,
Rene, their four children and a host of dignataries when he landed
at Patrick Air Force Base at 2:57 p.m. EST on his return from two
days of “de-briefing” at Grand Turk Island in the Bahamas.
CABPENTEIt GAVE HIS wife a long kiss at the airport, hugged
his children and mother, Mrs. Florence Carpenter of Boulder, Colo.,
and told a cheering crowd that “I’m glad to be back . . . this was
the supreme experience of my life.” He was taken in a parade
through the space town of Cocoa Beach to the Cape where James

E. Webb, head of the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA) presented him
with the agency’s Distinguished
Service Medal. Webb also pre
sented the medal to Walter Wil
liams, Project Mercury operations
director.
Carpenter delivered his report
“to the nation and the people who
paid for it and for whom it was
made” in the matter-of-fact man
ner of a veteran test pilot.
DESCRIBING THE voyage
chronologically, Carpenter point
ed out that the countdown and
the launch were perfect, marred
only by a 35-minute delay caused
by smoke in the area from forest
fires.
“The five minutes during
launch were the fastest I have
ever experienced.” Carpenter said,
and then added reflectively: “So
were the five hours in flight.”
As he has done repeatedly since
returning from orbit, the astro
naut described the sunsets and
sunrises as the “most arresting
sight” he ever saw.
HE TOLD OF a special film and
a new camera carried in the space
capsule to photograph the horizon
and hopefully “to learn from it
something about the guidance of
lunar rockets.” The film turned
out very well, he reported.
Carpenter said ho ran into a
major problem with his capsule
early in his first orbit—“improp
er operation of the automatic con
trol system. It didn’t concern me
at the time. There were so many
things to do and see . . . and I
did not think it was serious.”
He said the control problem
cropped up several more times
during the flight, but he “did not
analyze it thoroughly because of
the press” of the numerous ex
periments he was performing.
He said he understood there
had been reports that he was “a
tired and listless astronaut” on
the homeward leg of his third
orbit.
“THIS IS NOT true. I will ad
mit to being pre-occupied. This
was a very busy time,” he said,
adding that he was doing roughly
six different things as he was
hurtling through space between
Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast.
Carpenter said lie would “like
to apologize for the concern I
caused . . . had I known how
concerned you were, I would have
been concerned too. But I was not
concerned ... I was in good
shape.”
HE SAID THAT the wide con
cern at the end of his flight was
the result of a communications
problem and not the failure of
any vital system in his capsule.
“In many respects the flight
was as easy as a bus ride,” he
said.


STANFORD GRADUATE STUDENT Gary Deem, 22,
was critically injured early Saturday morning
when his car smashed into a tree off University
Avenue near Chaucer Street. He was reported in
"fairly good" condition yesterday at the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital. Deem, a mathematics student,

lives at the Chi Psi house. Police said he was driving home from a party when the accident happened at 3:14 a.m. Two fraternity brothers driving behind him said he was traveling about 45
miles per hour. He was in surgery for several
hours and suffered fractures of the left arm, left
leg, ribs and right foot, shock and internal injuries.
