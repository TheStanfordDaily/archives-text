P.S.
For heaven's sake don't be so silly as to go to the Seattle
fair without a camera. KEYBELL CAMERAS at 121 Stanford
Shopping Center have some from $10.95. Fred also saw the
new NIKKOREX F at KEYBELL at $199. He is going to get one
so that he can use the NIKON lenses he has already. It also
has that wonderful new metal shutter so that he will be able
to take those flash shots he wanted in the gym at 1 /25 second.
