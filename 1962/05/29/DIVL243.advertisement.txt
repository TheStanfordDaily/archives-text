An Appeal
To Reason
We feel that the issue of affiliation with the National
Student Association has been obscured by distorted
facts and emotional charges.
We also feel that the Stanford student body is capable
of making an intelligent decision on this issue.
Outright lies and slanted facts have been irresponsi
bly used in the past few weeks. They seem to have
had their effect.
Unrepresentative? The NS A includes in its member
ship at least 50% of all students in accredited Amer
ican Universities.
Not responsible or respected? Nixon, Kennedy, and
Eisenhower, among others, have praised the work
of the Association.
IT HAS NEVER BEEN ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S
LIST AND THERE IS WRITTEN TESTIMONY TO
PROVE THIS.
Stanford after less than a year in the NSA, disaffiliated
by a vote in which only 75 over a majority decided
the question. Student leaders have expressed their
support of Stanford's affiliation with th NSA, in
cluding Joel Meister, Frank Wallace, Dave Dierdorf,
Ed Eschbach, Lee Stephenson, Armin Rosencranz,
Jerry Puttier, Susie Goodwillie, Patty Dudley, Sandy
Bergen, Tom Grey, Brooke Taylor, John Bryson,
Jay Kittle, etc., etc.
We know that the NSA is by no means perfect; we
know that it is not a panacea. That is not the point.
We can only urge that you consider the fact that Stan
ford is practically the only major university in the
United States which does not belong to NSA.
For those in the student body who see the NSA as even
potentially beneficial, to Stanford and to them
selves; for those who would see Stanford “in the
twentieth century" as Frank Graham, former Uni
versity of North Carolina put it; for those who
bothered to find out the facts—the issue is clear.
Stanford has a responsibility to give NSA a chance, a
decent chance involving the people at Stanford
who have expressed a desire to make NSA work
for Stanford.
They are more than willing to try.
We feel they should be given the chance.

Jay Kittle, etc., etc.
We know that the NSA is by no means perfect; we
know that it is not a panacea. That is not the point.
We can only urge that you consider the fact that Stan
ford is practically the only major university in the
United States which does not belong to NSA.
For those in the student body who see the NSA as even
potentially beneficial, to Stanford and to them
selves; for those who would see Stanford “in the
twentieth century" as Frank Graham, former Uni
versity of North Carolina put it; for those who
bothered to find out the facts—the issue is clear.
Stanford has a responsibility to give NSA a chance, a
decent chance involving the people at Stanford
who have expressed a desire to make NSA work
for Stanford.
They are more than willing to try.
We feel they should be given the chance.

An Appeal
To Reason
We feel that the issue of affiliation with the National
Student Association has been obscured by distorted
facts and emotional charges.
We also feel that the Stanford student body is capable
of making an intelligent decision on this issue.
Outright lies and slanted facts have been irresponsi
bly used in the past few weeks. They seem to have
had their effect.
Unrepresentative? The NS A includes in its member
ship at least 50% of all students in accredited Amer
ican Universities.
Not responsible or respected? Nixon, Kennedy, and
Eisenhower, among others, have praised the work
of the Association.
IT HAS NEVER BEEN ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S
LIST AND THERE IS WRITTEN TESTIMONY TO
PROVE THIS.
Stanford after less than a year in the NSA, disaffiliated
by a vote in which only 75 over a majority decided
the question. Student leaders have expressed their
support of Stanford's affiliation with th NSA, in
cluding Joel Meister, Frank Wallace, Dave Dierdorf,
Ed Eschbach, Lee Stephenson, Armin Rosencranz,
Jerry Puttier, Susie Goodwillie, Patty Dudley, Sandy
Bergen, Tom Grey, Brooke Taylor, John Bryson,
Jay Kittle, etc., etc.
