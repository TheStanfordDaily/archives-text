SOME UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
ABOUT NSA . . .
DIRECTED TO THOSE WHO MAY BE VOTING
IN THE MAY 30th REFERENDUM.
What real benefits will each Stanford student receive from
our affiliation with the National Student Associaion (NSA)?
Will any of the benefits received by the six delegates sent to
one annual conference at a cost of $l5OO be able to “trickle
down” to the mass of Stanford students?
Since $l5OO spent on HR and Political Union could roughly
double their activities, couldn't the money better be spent
in this way to bring political figures and issues to the atten
tion of Stanford students at Stanford?
Has the NSA purged itself fully of those elements and prac
tices which have caused Stanford to disaffiliate twice in the
past?
Do we, as students, want the name of our university linked
with resolutions on political and semi-political issues which
we have only a small voice in passing?
Finally, if we still feel favorably inclined toward NSA, can't
the issue be decided better after a more thorough investiga
tion conducted next year instead of a hasty emotional cam
paign conducted in the last three weeks of a quarter.
