# Stanford Hosts Japan Students
## 
### 
Stanford’s first summer school
for a group of Asian students will
open this summer when twenty
four students from Keio Univer
sity, the oldest college in Japan,
will spend eight weeks on the
Farm studying English, Ameri
can history and American culture.
While summer schools for for
eigners are common in Europe,
this will be a new undertaking
for Stanford. The summer school
for Asian undergraduates was in
itiated by President Sterling and
the president of Keio University
during Sterling's visit to Japan
last spring for the opening of the
Stanford Center.

For the Japanese students, the
most important part of their sum
mer stay in America will be the
experience of living with Stan
ford students in Wilbur and La
gunita, and participating in the
everyday summer activities from
watermelon feasts to all-campus
twists.

Students who are interested in
rooming with a Japanese ex
change student, or in being se
lected for participation in the
“Seminars on Japanese and Amer
ican Cultures,” which will be held
for them, can write to Lars Gant
bcl, Manzanita Lodge, Stanford,
for more information.
