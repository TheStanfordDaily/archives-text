“How to Become a Pacifist in

certainly the most realistic war
movie ever and maybe the best.

THE STAGE
The Son of Six Appeal —The Tunn

The funniest thing between
here and Dick Gregory is this
cabaret review which is profes

“Debates with Soviet Scholars”
by Stanford geochemist Konrad
B. Krauskopf is an interesting
view of the Soviet scientists and
their views of Russia.
Chaparral May 18.
A parody on The Daily in which
| everyone but The Daily gets
mowed down in fine style, this is
the best Chappy parody since its
last try at us. Proximity may
have something to do with it.
Some of the best bits were pretty
funny four years ago and one
would hate to suggest that tim
idity was responsible for the
change in editorial cartoons.
What I want to know is why my
name is funnier than Judy Skar’s.
