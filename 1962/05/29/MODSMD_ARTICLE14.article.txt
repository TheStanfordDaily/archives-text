# Tarshis Disagrees With Baran on Disarmament
## 
### HOY SCHMIDT 
Military disarmament would
not threaten the current level of
prosperity in the United States,
but rather it would permit a more
meaningful prosperity and a more
rapid rate of growth.
These were the words of Prof.
Lorie Tarshis, head of the Stan
ford Economic Dept., as he dis
cussed the recent controversial
statements of Prof. Paul Baran,
also of Stanford.
BARAN IS reported to have
said that President Kennedy’s en
tire program to liquidate unem
ployment is limited to increased
government expenditure for ar
mament. His statement appeared
in Economic Life, a Polish maga
zine, as part of an interview he
granted last month in Warsaw.
“So far as I know, no compe
tent economist believes that there
would be a technical problem in
maintaining prosperity if wo were
to disarm,” Tarshis said.
Kennedy has asked for an in
crease in public works, he has
proposed a cut in taxes and a
trade expansion bill, and has tried
to provide greater stimuli for in
vestment. To say that his pro
gram is limited to arms spending
is “unadulterated nonsense,” he
said.
BARAN, WHO describes him
self as an independent socialist,
feels that a mature capitalist
economy must be aggressive or it
will be exposed to depression.
“I would say that the experi
ence of some European countries
denies this,” Tarshis continued.
“To put the blame for the wors
ening of every international situ
ation on U.S. domestic problems
is closing your eyes to Soviet re
sponsibility for inci’eased tension
and their reluctance to accept, in
any meaningful sense, inspection
for control of weapons.”
In reviewing Kennedy’s eco
nomic program, Tarshis was fa
vorable to the President’s tariff
cutting proposal but had two
strong reservations.
FIRST, HE fears that the Unit
ed States will not take a strong
enough position in negotiating
with the Common Market on tar
iff reductions. “We’re still nego
tiating as if the alliance would
break up if we did not make most
of the concessions,” he said.
France and Germany are not
bound by the same considerations
because they know that it will not
break up. The United States must
take a stiffen line or it will get
too few concessions for what it
offers.
Recently the administration
claimed a victory in persuading
the Common Market to lower its
tariff on raw cotton and tobacco
in return for U.S. concessions on
automobiles. In this agreement
the Europeans gave up nothing.
They do not have important raw
cotton or tobacco industries to
protect. Their tariff cut will not
necessarily increase U. S. exports
by a single dollar.
Tarshis’ second reservation con
cerns the way in which the ad
ministration has presented the
bill. “I wish their arguments were
more honest; they create the im
pression that Congress would be
able to vote on whether the Com
mon Market cuts its tariff or
not,” he said.
THIS GLOSSES over the eer

tainty that some American indus
tries will have to bo hurt if the
relationship with the European
bloc is to he meaningful. Argu
ments for trade liberalization im
ply injury to those industries that
are not competitive, but that this
loss will be more than offset by
the gains to industries which can
compete.
Many fear that high labor costs
have priced American products
out of the world market and that
trade liberalization would have
disastrous effects on industry.
This would be true for certain in
dustries, Tarshis grants, but the
fact that the margin of U.S. ex
ports over imports has grown in
recent years suggests that Amer
ican industry on the whole is still
strongly competitive.
Tarshis expressed disappoint
ment over the administration’s
current, economic program, al
though he did support Kennedy in
1960. “Sometimes I have the feel
ing that if the president’s eco
nomic advisers were to have seen
the same developments under the
previous administration, they
would be raising their voices
pretty loud.”
TARSHIS HAD hoped for a
faster recovery from the 1960 re
cession, lower interest rates, sig
nificant changes in the personal
income, and corporate tax struc
tures, and increased spending in
the non-military part of the
budget.
Under the present tax laws and
rate of government spending, if
the United States were to achieve
full prosperity, there would be a
budgetary surplus of between six
and ten billion dollars. The pres
ence of such a potential surplus
has a depressing effect on the
economy and stands in the way of
achieving full prosperity.
European countries avoid any
budgetary surplus, and try to
keep taxes low to make it easier
to maintain a high level of pros
perity.
TARSHIS EXPLAINED that a
lower income tax and increased
government spending would
make full prosperity more pos
sible in this country. Also, re
duced corporate taxes would en
courage business to invest in new
equipment and would thus in
crease the economy’s growth rate.
Like many American observers,
Tarshis was disturbed by the ad
ministration’s recent show of
power in blocking a hike in steel
prices. “One of the real strengths
of the capitalist system is that it
allows the people to make de
cisions in accord with their own
private interest, but there must
be some way to make business
and labor acknowledge social fac
tors. I’m uncomfortable about the
administration’s policy, but I
don’t see any better alternative,”
ho said.
Kennedy probably could have
handled the problem in away
that would have avoided public
clamor and indignation. The steel
industry is currently operating at
60 per cent of production poten
tial. A price raise would not be
possible unless all companies
agreed. Kennedy could have en
couraged the holdouts like Kaiser
and Inland by manipulating con
tracts in their favor. Such a move
probably would have forced the
others back into line.
