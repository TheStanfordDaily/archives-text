THANKS
Editor, The Daily:
We wish to express our thanks
and appreciation to the Dean of
Men, William G. Craig, who has
been at Stanford for seven years,
and assistant Dean of Men, Allard
K. Lowenstein for their continu
ous faith in the ability of students
to make decisions regarding their
total educational responsibilities
at Stanford.
They have worked day and
night to provide able and ready
counsel to students actively en
gaged in the affairs of Stanford,
while only asking in return re
sponsibility and maturity of us
on all occasions. Not only do they
represent the policies of the Unh
versity to the students, but we
believe Dean Craig and his three
assistants try to represent the
student viewpoints to the Univer
sity.
These men have been a credit
to higher education at Stanford,
and the University will be the
poorer because they will not be
back next year. We look on their
leaving with great dismay, not
only because we are losing close
contact with two very good
friends, but because we are losing
their vital services.
To them we wish to express
our deepest gratitude and hopes
that they will be appreciated
wherever they may go.

Steinbniner, Susan Goodwillle,!

APPRECIATION
Editor, The Daily:
At this time of the year when
our academic studies are coming
to an end and the day of depar
ture to our homes is drawing
close, we feel it is lime for us to
express publicly our warm appre
ciation of all those who have af
forded us the opportunity to come
here and made our stay here both
comfortable and happy.
We came here last September
under the Stanford International
Legal Studies programme which
is sponsored by the Stanford Law
School with the financial aid
given by the Ford and Asia Foun
dations. Under this programme
fellowships are granted to law
yers serving under the govern
ments of various South East
Asian countries to study certain
aspects of American law. Most of
us have been interested particu
larly in the study of your Consti
tution and in your approach to
| International Law.
Many have asked us what value
this programme has to us in
view of the fact that our legal
systems are closer to the English
than the American pattern. Our
broad answers to this question
may be summed up as follows:
The study of your Constitutional
system is an essential part of the
education of any lawyer, who is
nurtured in Western Democratic
Constitutional systems, while the
study of your common law which
is an offshoot of the English com-
I mon law modified by statute or
judicial interpretation has afford
ed us considerable food for
thought as regards legal reforms

that may be undertaken in cer
tain areas of the law in our coun
tries. For this opportunity we can
hardly he thankful enough, and
we can only hope that some of
your lawyers will have similar
opportunities to study the bene
fits and defects of our legal sys
tems.
Quite apart from the legal bene
fits of the programme, we have
had a wonderful year making
some fine friendships at the Law
School, at Crothers, and at the
Stanford International Club. We
can only hope that we will have
some chance to reciprocate the
great time you have given us in
the not too distant future. It
might be fitting at this juncture
to thank above all, Dean Spaeth,
Prof. Ebb. Mrs. Roodhouse, Mrs.
Steinhelfer and the other Profes
sors of the Law School who have
spent many patient moments with
us tiding us over in our moments
of difficulty and need.
We hope Stanford will set an ex
ample to other academic institu
tions in the U.S. as sponsors of
imaginative programmes in fields
which most people imagine to he
of little use to the economically
underdeveloped countries. These
critics seem to forget that the
preservation of Democracy
through its legal forms is as im
portant as the economic uplift
ment of these countries if this
country’s main concern is to re
sist the spread of communism.
May we wish the sponsors all the
luck they can get. and congratu
late them on their foresight.

APPRECIATION
Editor, The Daily:
At this time of the year when
our academic studies are coming
to an end and the day of depar
ture to our homes is drawing
close, we feel it is lime for us to
express publicly our warm appre
ciation of all those who have af
forded us the opportunity to come
here and made our stay here both
comfortable and happy.
We came here last September
under the Stanford International
Legal Studies programme which
is sponsored by the Stanford Law
School with the financial aid
given by the Ford and Asia Foun
dations. Under this programme
fellowships are granted to law
yers serving under the govern
ments of various South East
Asian countries to study certain
aspects of American law. Most of
us have been interested particu
larly in the study of your Consti
tution and in your approach to
| International Law.
Many have asked us what value
this programme has to us in
view of the fact that our legal
systems are closer to the English
than the American pattern. Our
broad answers to this question
may be summed up as follows:
The study of your Constitutional
system is an essential part of the
education of any lawyer, who is
nurtured in Western Democratic
Constitutional systems, while the
study of your common law which
is an offshoot of the English com-
I mon law modified by statute or
judicial interpretation has afford
ed us considerable food for
thought as regards legal reforms

that may be undertaken in cer
tain areas of the law in our coun
tries. For this opportunity we can
hardly he thankful enough, and
we can only hope that some of
your lawyers will have similar
opportunities to study the bene
fits and defects of our legal sys
tems.
Quite apart from the legal bene
fits of the programme, we have
had a wonderful year making
some fine friendships at the Law
School, at Crothers, and at the
Stanford International Club. We
can only hope that we will have
some chance to reciprocate the
great time you have given us in
the not too distant future. It
might be fitting at this juncture
to thank above all, Dean Spaeth,
Prof. Ebb. Mrs. Roodhouse, Mrs.
Steinhelfer and the other Profes
sors of the Law School who have
spent many patient moments with
us tiding us over in our moments
of difficulty and need.
We hope Stanford will set an ex
ample to other academic institu
tions in the U.S. as sponsors of
imaginative programmes in fields
which most people imagine to he
of little use to the economically
underdeveloped countries. These
critics seem to forget that the
preservation of Democracy
through its legal forms is as im
portant as the economic uplift
ment of these countries if this
country’s main concern is to re
sist the spread of communism.
May we wish the sponsors all the
luck they can get. and congratu
late them on their foresight.

THANKS
Editor, The Daily:
We wish to express our thanks
and appreciation to the Dean of
Men, William G. Craig, who has
been at Stanford for seven years,
and assistant Dean of Men, Allard
K. Lowenstein for their continu
ous faith in the ability of students
to make decisions regarding their
total educational responsibilities
at Stanford.
They have worked day and
night to provide able and ready
counsel to students actively en
gaged in the affairs of Stanford,
while only asking in return re
sponsibility and maturity of us
on all occasions. Not only do they
represent the policies of the Unh
versity to the students, but we
believe Dean Craig and his three
assistants try to represent the
student viewpoints to the Univer
sity.
These men have been a credit
to higher education at Stanford,
and the University will be the
poorer because they will not be
back next year. We look on their
leaving with great dismay, not
only because we are losing close
contact with two very good
friends, but because we are losing
their vital services.
To them we wish to express
our deepest gratitude and hopes
that they will be appreciated
wherever they may go.

tution and in your approach to
| International Law.
Many have asked us what value
this programme has to us in
view of the fact that our legal
systems are closer to the English
than the American pattern. Our
broad answers to this question
may be summed up as follows:
The study of your Constitutional
system is an essential part of the
education of any lawyer, who is
nurtured in Western Democratic
Constitutional systems, while the
study of your common law which
is an offshoot of the English com-
I mon law modified by statute or
judicial interpretation has afford
ed us considerable food for
thought as regards legal reforms

that may be undertaken in cer
tain areas of the law in our coun
tries. For this opportunity we can
hardly he thankful enough, and
we can only hope that some of
your lawyers will have similar
opportunities to study the bene
fits and defects of our legal sys
tems.
Quite apart from the legal bene
fits of the programme, we have
had a wonderful year making
some fine friendships at the Law
School, at Crothers, and at the
Stanford International Club. We
can only hope that we will have
some chance to reciprocate the
great time you have given us in
the not too distant future. It
might be fitting at this juncture
to thank above all, Dean Spaeth,
Prof. Ebb. Mrs. Roodhouse, Mrs.
Steinhelfer and the other Profes
sors of the Law School who have
spent many patient moments with
us tiding us over in our moments
of difficulty and need.
We hope Stanford will set an ex
ample to other academic institu
tions in the U.S. as sponsors of
imaginative programmes in fields
which most people imagine to he
of little use to the economically
underdeveloped countries. These
critics seem to forget that the
preservation of Democracy
through its legal forms is as im
portant as the economic uplift
ment of these countries if this
country’s main concern is to re
sist the spread of communism.
May we wish the sponsors all the
luck they can get. and congratu
late them on their foresight.

THANKS
Editor, The Daily:
We wish to express our thanks
and appreciation to the Dean of
Men, William G. Craig, who has
been at Stanford for seven years,
and assistant Dean of Men, Allard
K. Lowenstein for their continu
ous faith in the ability of students
to make decisions regarding their
total educational responsibilities
at Stanford.
They have worked day and
night to provide able and ready
counsel to students actively en
gaged in the affairs of Stanford,
while only asking in return re
sponsibility and maturity of us
on all occasions. Not only do they
represent the policies of the Unh
versity to the students, but we
believe Dean Craig and his three
assistants try to represent the
student viewpoints to the Univer
sity.
These men have been a credit
to higher education at Stanford,
and the University will be the
poorer because they will not be
back next year. We look on their
leaving with great dismay, not
only because we are losing close
contact with two very good
friends, but because we are losing
their vital services.
To them we wish to express
our deepest gratitude and hopes
that they will be appreciated
wherever they may go.

APPRECIATION
Editor, The Daily:
At this time of the year when
our academic studies are coming
to an end and the day of depar
ture to our homes is drawing
close, we feel it is lime for us to
express publicly our warm appre
ciation of all those who have af
forded us the opportunity to come
here and made our stay here both
comfortable and happy.
We came here last September
under the Stanford International
Legal Studies programme which
is sponsored by the Stanford Law
School with the financial aid
given by the Ford and Asia Foun
dations. Under this programme
fellowships are granted to law
yers serving under the govern
ments of various South East
Asian countries to study certain
aspects of American law. Most of
us have been interested particu
larly in the study of your Consti
tution and in your approach to
| International Law.
