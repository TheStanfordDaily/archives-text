# Jones Hits 149 in Final Trial
## 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind. (UPD
Pole sitter Parnelli Jones flashed
around the speedway at 149 miles
per hour and pronounced his car
ready for tomorrow’s 500-mile
Memorial Day auto race.
Jones and his 32 rivals for the
■ estimated $425,000 purse took ad
j vantage of a three-hour carbura
j tion practice period under near
-1 ideal racing conditions. The 2’L>-
mile oval resembled race day,
I with the many-colored roadsters
| rolling in and out of the dress
rehearsal for the holiday grind.
No more running will be per-

I mitted before tomorrow’s pa
| rade lap, to be followed by the
| pace lap and the flying start at
! 11 a.m. EST.
The only accidents occurred
when a car driven by veteran
Gene Hartley blew its engine and
skidded to a halt coming out of
the northwest turn, and when Ed
die Johnson’s machine developed
clutch trouble.
Hartley’s crew hopes to make
the lineup with a new engine.
Should he be unable to start, the
first alternate, Dempsey Wilson,
would probably be permitted to
loin the field in last place.
