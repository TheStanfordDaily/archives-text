# I-Club to Keep World SU File
## 
### 
The International Club is start
ing to maintain an address file of
foreign students in an effort to
bring together Stanford students
—past and present—travelling or
living in foreign countries.
With the address file, it is
hoped that students will be able
to locate other Stanford students
in the countries in which they
might be living or travelling.
Interested foreign students who
are returning home would file
their names so that they might
come in contact with other stu
dents going to their countries.
For example, a Stanford stu
dent might be planning a trip to
Germany. Upon writing the I-
Center he would he put in touch
with ex-Stanford students living
in Germany.
The address file is being com
posed at the I-Center Desk in the
Women’s Clubhouse, and the I-
Club invites foreign students to
file their names for “Stanford
Everywhere.”
