# U.S. to Conduct Space Series
## 
### 
WASHINGTON ( UPI i The
government announced yesterday
that in about four days the United
Slates will begin a series of high
altitude nuclear tests over John
ston Island in the Pacific.
The series is expected to include
the highest nuclear explosion yet
sot off by man, at an altitude of
400 to 600 miles.
A joint announcement by the
Defense Department and Atomic
Energy Commission said the in
itial blast will be equal to less
than one million tons of TNT and
will be at an altitude of “tens of
kilometers.” A kilometer is .62 of
a mile.
At least two tests will follow at
altitudes of “hundreds of kilom
eters.” One of the two will be
equal to more than a million tons
of TNT. A fourth high-altitude
test may be conducted.
The Johnston Island experi
ments will bo the second phase of
the now U.S. atmospheric test
program started April 25. To date
14 nuclear devices have been ex
ploded in the Christmas Island
test area of the Pacific, most of
them droped from planes.
The lengthy announcement gave
asurances that no permanent,
damage will be done to the Van
Allen radiation belt around the
earth.
The agencies said the second
explosion will be “at an altitude
closely associated with the lower
part of the inner natural radia
tion belt.” This belt begins at al
titudes of 400 to 600 miles.
“It has been concluded that the
detonation at the highest altitude
may cause perturbation of a frac
tion of the inner Van Allen radia
tion belt which extends upward
for another 3,000 miles,” the an
nouncement said.
