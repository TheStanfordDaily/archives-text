# Stock Market Drop Worst Since 1929
## 
### 
NEW YORK (UPl)—'The stock
market plunged yesterday in its
worst crash since the great crash
of October, 1929.
Thousands of investors, most of
them presumably “little follows,”
touched off a wave of selling that
wiped out $28.5 billion in paper
values and had the ticker tape
running a record 69 minutes late
when the market closed.
It w'as the sixth straight day of
heavy selling, which cost the mar
ket a total of $59.5 billion in paper
values.
Among the big blue chips,
American Telephone took a shel
lacking of $11.13 a share and Du
Pont lost $12.50. Soars, Roebuck
w'as down $7.37 and such highly
favored rails as Chesapeake &
Ohio and Norfolk and Western
lost $6.24 and $5.50 respectively.
Motors and steels stood the
pressure best. U.S. Steel lost only
$l.BB and General Motors only
$1.63. Standard Oil N.J. was down
$5, International Nickel $3 and
Woolworth $3.88.
THE UOW-JONES industrial
average slumped 34.95 points to
576.93 almost 25 points below
the 600 level which even the most
pessimistic observers predicted
would be the absolute minimum
should there be a slump this
year.
This was the worst decline
since Oct. 28, 1929, when the aver
age dropped 38.33 points.
A total of 9,350,000 shares was
traded, the largest since July 21.
1933.
The lag in the tape doubled the
previous record of 34 minutes set
in May, 1933. Exchange and bro
kerage house employees were
swamped with orders and were
kept hours overtime. Even the
specialists were held over on the
stock exchange floor to confirm
orders.
BUT OFFICERS of the ex
change said there would be no
comment from the exchange it
self on the break or the day’s
trading.
The break extended from the
big board to the American Ex
change in New York and to the
Midwest Exchange in Chicago

and the San Francisco Exchange.
At Toronto industrial shares had
the biggest drop in memory.
Wall Street generally was stun
ned by the wide and deep extent
of the selling. The most logical
explanation seemed to bo that
“little follows” were getting out
of the market, fearful that their
equities would be wiped out if
they hung on any longer. They so
concluded because there didn’t ap
pear to be any number of big
blocks offered as would be the
case if institutions and big inves
tors were dumping.
And late in the day it appeared
that factors and banks were sell
ing the securities of some smaller
traders who had borrowed on
them.

But there was agreement that
the selling was not justified by
business or economic news, which
generally has been fair to bright.
But Bache & Co., a big Wall
Street house, found reason for
the selling in “the speculative ex
cesses of the past three or four
years whore anticipations of
value far exceeded the realiza
tions of earnings.”

equities would be wiped out if
they hung on any longer. They so

pear to be any number of big
blocks offered as would be the

And late in the day it appeared

ing the securities of some smaller
traders who had borrowed on
them.

But there was agreement that
the selling was not justified by
business or economic news, which
generally has been fair to bright.

the selling in “the speculative ex

NEW YORK (UPl)—'The stock
market plunged yesterday in its
worst crash since the great crash
of October, 1929.
Thousands of investors, most of
them presumably “little follows,”
touched off a wave of selling that
wiped out $28.5 billion in paper
values and had the ticker tape
running a record 69 minutes late
when the market closed.
It w'as the sixth straight day of
heavy selling, which cost the mar
ket a total of $59.5 billion in paper
values.
Among the big blue chips,
American Telephone took a shel
lacking of $11.13 a share and Du
Pont lost $12.50. Soars, Roebuck
w'as down $7.37 and such highly
favored rails as Chesapeake &
Ohio and Norfolk and Western
lost $6.24 and $5.50 respectively.
Motors and steels stood the
pressure best. U.S. Steel lost only
$l.BB and General Motors only
$1.63. Standard Oil N.J. was down
$5, International Nickel $3 and
Woolworth $3.88.
THE UOW-JONES industrial
average slumped 34.95 points to
576.93 almost 25 points below
the 600 level which even the most
pessimistic observers predicted
would be the absolute minimum
should there be a slump this
year.
This was the worst decline
since Oct. 28, 1929, when the aver
age dropped 38.33 points.
A total of 9,350,000 shares was
traded, the largest since July 21.
1933.
The lag in the tape doubled the
previous record of 34 minutes set
in May, 1933. Exchange and bro
kerage house employees were
swamped with orders and were
kept hours overtime. Even the
specialists were held over on the
stock exchange floor to confirm
orders.
BUT OFFICERS of the ex
change said there would be no
comment from the exchange it
self on the break or the day’s
trading.
The break extended from the
big board to the American Ex
change in New York and to the
Midwest Exchange in Chicago

and the San Francisco Exchange.
At Toronto industrial shares had
the biggest drop in memory.
Wall Street generally was stun
ned by the wide and deep extent
of the selling. The most logical
explanation seemed to bo that
“little follows” were getting out
of the market, fearful that their
equities would be wiped out if
they hung on any longer. They so
