# Treason Verdict Shakes France
## 
### 
PARIS, (UPD President
Charles de Gaulle yesterday faced
a mounting crisis over the trea
son trials of secret army leaders
which threatened to shake his re
gime to its foundations.
The crisis was becoming so
grave that Premier Georges Pom
pidou and Algerian Affairs Minis
ter Louis Joxe will go before the
National Assembly tomorrow to
defend the government position.
Pompidou also is expected to
answer charges then that he and
Rene Brouillet, former secretary
general of the presidential palace,
took payments of $158,000 from
OAS leader Raoul Salan to push
the "French Algeria” cause. Brou
illet now is ambassador to Aus
tria.

The growing storm was touched
off by these developments:

-—De Gaulle, in a burst of an
ger. Sunday dissolved the special
military high tribunal which last
week saved Salan from the firing
squad.
—The cabinet is expected at its
meeting tomorrow to set up a
new tribunal to try Secret Army
Organization (OAS) terrorists.
—Widespread reports, later de
nied by government spokesmen,
affirmed that Dc Gaulle planned
to seek a new trial of Salan.
The critical turn of events since
Salan escaped the expected death
last Tuesday caused widespread
dismay. The state-controlled
French radio warned in a political
commentary that not only the
Pompidou government but the
whole Gaullist Fifth Republic
were threatened.
