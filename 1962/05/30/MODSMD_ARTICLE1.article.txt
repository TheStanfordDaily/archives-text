# Frosh Work Camp Helps in Understanding Indians
## 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
A good thing happened this spring.
It happened on a semi-primitive, isolated
Indian reservation about sixty miles north
east of Bakersfield, California, where the
Tule River Indians live.
For eight days, twenty Stanford students,
mostly freshmen, lived and worked with the
Indians in a unique experiment planned and
financed by the students themselves.
The idea of some kind of work camp for
Spring Vacation was suggested last fall as
pari of the freshmen men’s house program.
Nothing was done about it at the time, but
during Winter Quarter the idea again came
up and this time caught on, when Bob Frank
in Arroyo decided to find out more about
the project.
WITH THE HELP of a graduate student
who had himself worked with the Tule River
Indians on an international work camp, the
tribe was contacted. The American Friends
Service Committee, a Quaker-affiliated or
ganization which specializes in missions to
American Indians, served as a go-between,
and arranged for the Tribal Council to issue
a formal invitation to the students.

The twenty men and women were not
sure when they started out just exactly what
they expected to find or to accomplish. Each
member of the group paid $2O, which was
to cover food, transportation, and whatever
else proved necessary during the course of
the week,
What they found was a group of 250 In
dians living in an atmosphere of poverty,
discrimination, and defeat.
When the students drove up the paved,
winding road which connects the strung-out
community, they were immediately struck
by the sight of old, rusted cats ;rturnod
in several of the front yards, wrecks which
proved to be an accurate, if unfortunate, in
dication of conditions on the reservation.
THE INDIANS have electricity, hut no
running water. The reservation is on timber
land, which belongs to the tribe. A mill leases
the timber from the Indians, and pays the
tribe a small fee for this. Only three or four
of the Indians work at the mill and many of
the rest can’t ever find work.
Although the students went “without pre
conceived notions” as to what they should
do, they know that just getting these people
to accept what one camper called “naked
kindness” would be their main difficulty.

They decided that the best way to get
started would bo simply to get started, so
by the next afternoon, they had set up camp,
and began to "make contact” by inviting
some of the tribe to join them in a game of
baseball. The Indian team won, and this was
a good beginning.
During the week, the work campers
helped roof three houses, put up a school-bus
waiting shelter, installed a kitchen sink and
held a nursery school for some of the young
er children.
AT THE SAME time, they were getting
behind the reserve and aloofness to find an
amazingly unhurried and relaxed way of
life. After a few days, they found them
selves slowing down too, talking the easy
speech of the men and women they were
working with.
They also began to see the Indications of
some pretty ugly social problems. The night
they held a dance it became clear that, along
with a talent for making rock and roll music,
the Indians also had a harsher talent for
drinking too much and too often. Conversa
tions brought out the fact that alcoholism is
an ever-present problem, and so is juvenile
delinquency. These problems are only symp
toms of an underlying illness, the disease of

a history of deeply-felt discrimination.
The Indians are, and always have been,
treated as a minority in the area. They have
been shunted from poor land to poorer land
over the course of the years, until now they
have to depend on seasonal jobs for income
and not much else. More and more they have
withdrawn into hostility and defiance, be
wildered by things as simple as car registra
tions, and reluctant to go even as far as the
town of Porterville except when absolutely
necessary.
ACCUMULATED DEFEAT and bitter
ness have led the Indians to reject both the
White man and his standards. This showed
up in their attitudes more and more during
the week the work campers were there, until
every student became acutely aware of the
Indians' feeling.
Since no amount of effort has ever helped
their situation, they don’t even try any more.
The typical statement about any project was,
“Don’t start that. It will never get done. Why
bother?”
Once the work campers sensed this atti
tude, they began to increase the emphasis
on “self-help.” They insisted on being invited
before working on anything, and kept to
their policy of only helping, making sure that

no jobs were done by students unless an
Indian were working there too.
The work campers feel that this is the
way in which they were able to do the most
—to show the Indians that things can and do
get done, especially when the Indians them
selves want it that way.
WHEN A FEW JOBS actually did get
finished during the week, it made an impres
sion. No great miracles were accomplished,
but a small dent was made in defeatism, and
this by itself made the week worthwhile.
As for the work campers, they were learn
ing too. They began to understand and ap
preciate why the tribe has serious problems
with alcoholism and juvenile delinquency
and why their history of discrimination has
made them wary of “outsiders.” They began
to see how constant defeat has left the tribe
hostile and apathetic.
The work campers feel that they got
more than they gave, in the way of friend
ship and insight into a different system of
values and way of life.
Everyone of them feels that the idea of a
work camp was a tremendous success. They
plan to try to establish work camps as a
regular part of the freshman men's program
for coming years.

withdrawn into hostility and defiance, be
wildered by things as simple as car registra
tions, and reluctant to go even as far as the
town of Porterville except when absolutely
necessary.
ACCUMULATED DEFEAT and bitter
ness have led the Indians to reject both the
White man and his standards. This showed
up in their attitudes more and more during
the week the work campers were there, until
every student became acutely aware of the
Indians' feeling.
Since no amount of effort has ever helped
their situation, they don’t even try any more.
The typical statement about any project was,
“Don’t start that. It will never get done. Why
bother?”
Once the work campers sensed this atti
tude, they began to increase the emphasis
on “self-help.” They insisted on being invited
before working on anything, and kept to
their policy of only helping, making sure that

no jobs were done by students unless an
Indian were working there too.
The work campers feel that this is the
way in which they were able to do the most
—to show the Indians that things can and do
get done, especially when the Indians them
selves want it that way.
WHEN A FEW JOBS actually did get
finished during the week, it made an impres
sion. No great miracles were accomplished,
but a small dent was made in defeatism, and
this by itself made the week worthwhile.
As for the work campers, they were learn
ing too. They began to understand and ap
preciate why the tribe has serious problems
with alcoholism and juvenile delinquency
and why their history of discrimination has
made them wary of “outsiders.” They began
to see how constant defeat has left the tribe
hostile and apathetic.
The work campers feel that they got
more than they gave, in the way of friend
ship and insight into a different system of
values and way of life.
Everyone of them feels that the idea of a
work camp was a tremendous success. They
plan to try to establish work camps as a
regular part of the freshman men's program
for coming years.
A good thing happened this spring.
It happened on a semi-primitive, isolated
Indian reservation about sixty miles north
east of Bakersfield, California, where the
Tule River Indians live.
For eight days, twenty Stanford students,
mostly freshmen, lived and worked with the
Indians in a unique experiment planned and
financed by the students themselves.
The idea of some kind of work camp for
Spring Vacation was suggested last fall as
pari of the freshmen men’s house program.
Nothing was done about it at the time, but
during Winter Quarter the idea again came
up and this time caught on, when Bob Frank
in Arroyo decided to find out more about
the project.
WITH THE HELP of a graduate student
who had himself worked with the Tule River
Indians on an international work camp, the
tribe was contacted. The American Friends
Service Committee, a Quaker-affiliated or
ganization which specializes in missions to
American Indians, served as a go-between,
and arranged for the Tribal Council to issue
a formal invitation to the students.

The twenty men and women were not
sure when they started out just exactly what
they expected to find or to accomplish. Each
member of the group paid $2O, which was
to cover food, transportation, and whatever
else proved necessary during the course of
the week,
What they found was a group of 250 In
dians living in an atmosphere of poverty,
discrimination, and defeat.
When the students drove up the paved,
winding road which connects the strung-out
community, they were immediately struck
by the sight of old, rusted cats ;rturnod
in several of the front yards, wrecks which
proved to be an accurate, if unfortunate, in
dication of conditions on the reservation.
THE INDIANS have electricity, hut no
running water. The reservation is on timber
land, which belongs to the tribe. A mill leases
the timber from the Indians, and pays the
tribe a small fee for this. Only three or four
of the Indians work at the mill and many of
the rest can’t ever find work.
Although the students went “without pre
conceived notions” as to what they should
do, they know that just getting these people
to accept what one camper called “naked
kindness” would be their main difficulty.

They decided that the best way to get
started would bo simply to get started, so
by the next afternoon, they had set up camp,
and began to "make contact” by inviting
some of the tribe to join them in a game of
baseball. The Indian team won, and this was
a good beginning.
During the week, the work campers
helped roof three houses, put up a school-bus
waiting shelter, installed a kitchen sink and
held a nursery school for some of the young
er children.
AT THE SAME time, they were getting
behind the reserve and aloofness to find an
amazingly unhurried and relaxed way of
life. After a few days, they found them
selves slowing down too, talking the easy
speech of the men and women they were
working with.
They also began to see the Indications of
some pretty ugly social problems. The night
they held a dance it became clear that, along
with a talent for making rock and roll music,
the Indians also had a harsher talent for
drinking too much and too often. Conversa
tions brought out the fact that alcoholism is
an ever-present problem, and so is juvenile
delinquency. These problems are only symp
toms of an underlying illness, the disease of

a history of deeply-felt discrimination.
The Indians are, and always have been,
treated as a minority in the area. They have
been shunted from poor land to poorer land
over the course of the years, until now they
have to depend on seasonal jobs for income
and not much else. More and more they have
withdrawn into hostility and defiance, be
wildered by things as simple as car registra
tions, and reluctant to go even as far as the

THE INDIANS have electricity, hut no
running water. The reservation is on timber
land, which belongs to the tribe. A mill leases
the timber from the Indians, and pays the
tribe a small fee for this. Only three or four
of the Indians work at the mill and many of
the rest can’t ever find work.
Although the students went “without pre
conceived notions” as to what they should
do, they know that just getting these people
to accept what one camper called “naked
kindness” would be their main difficulty.

They decided that the best way to get
started would bo simply to get started, so
by the next afternoon, they had set up camp,
and began to "make contact” by inviting
some of the tribe to join them in a game of
baseball. The Indian team won, and this was
a good beginning.
During the week, the work campers
helped roof three houses, put up a school-bus
waiting shelter, installed a kitchen sink and
held a nursery school for some of the young
er children.
AT THE SAME time, they were getting
behind the reserve and aloofness to find an
amazingly unhurried and relaxed way of
life. After a few days, they found them
selves slowing down too, talking the easy
speech of the men and women they were
working with.
They also began to see the Indications of
some pretty ugly social problems. The night
they held a dance it became clear that, along
with a talent for making rock and roll music,
the Indians also had a harsher talent for
drinking too much and too often. Conversa
tions brought out the fact that alcoholism is
an ever-present problem, and so is juvenile
delinquency. These problems are only symp
toms of an underlying illness, the disease of

a history of deeply-felt discrimination.
The Indians are, and always have been,
treated as a minority in the area. They have
been shunted from poor land to poorer land
over the course of the years, until now they
have to depend on seasonal jobs for income
and not much else. More and more they have
withdrawn into hostility and defiance, be
wildered by things as simple as car registra
tions, and reluctant to go even as far as the
town of Porterville except when absolutely
necessary.
ACCUMULATED DEFEAT and bitter
ness have led the Indians to reject both the
White man and his standards. This showed
up in their attitudes more and more during
the week the work campers were there, until
every student became acutely aware of the
Indians' feeling.
Since no amount of effort has ever helped
their situation, they don’t even try any more.
The typical statement about any project was,
“Don’t start that. It will never get done. Why
bother?”
Once the work campers sensed this atti
tude, they began to increase the emphasis
on “self-help.” They insisted on being invited
before working on anything, and kept to
their policy of only helping, making sure that

no jobs were done by students unless an
Indian were working there too.
The work campers feel that this is the
way in which they were able to do the most
—to show the Indians that things can and do
get done, especially when the Indians them
selves want it that way.
WHEN A FEW JOBS actually did get
finished during the week, it made an impres
sion. No great miracles were accomplished,
but a small dent was made in defeatism, and
this by itself made the week worthwhile.
As for the work campers, they were learn
ing too. They began to understand and ap
preciate why the tribe has serious problems
with alcoholism and juvenile delinquency
and why their history of discrimination has
made them wary of “outsiders.” They began
to see how constant defeat has left the tribe
hostile and apathetic.
The work campers feel that they got
more than they gave, in the way of friend
ship and insight into a different system of
values and way of life.
Everyone of them feels that the idea of a
work camp was a tremendous success. They
plan to try to establish work camps as a
regular part of the freshman men's program
for coming years.
A good thing happened this spring.
It happened on a semi-primitive, isolated
Indian reservation about sixty miles north
east of Bakersfield, California, where the
Tule River Indians live.
For eight days, twenty Stanford students,
mostly freshmen, lived and worked with the
Indians in a unique experiment planned and
financed by the students themselves.
The idea of some kind of work camp for
Spring Vacation was suggested last fall as
pari of the freshmen men’s house program.
Nothing was done about it at the time, but
during Winter Quarter the idea again came
up and this time caught on, when Bob Frank
in Arroyo decided to find out more about
the project.
WITH THE HELP of a graduate student
who had himself worked with the Tule River
Indians on an international work camp, the
tribe was contacted. The American Friends
Service Committee, a Quaker-affiliated or
ganization which specializes in missions to
American Indians, served as a go-between,
and arranged for the Tribal Council to issue
a formal invitation to the students.

The twenty men and women were not
sure when they started out just exactly what
they expected to find or to accomplish. Each
member of the group paid $2O, which was
to cover food, transportation, and whatever
else proved necessary during the course of
the week,
What they found was a group of 250 In
dians living in an atmosphere of poverty,
discrimination, and defeat.
When the students drove up the paved,
winding road which connects the strung-out
community, they were immediately struck
by the sight of old, rusted cats ;rturnod
in several of the front yards, wrecks which
proved to be an accurate, if unfortunate, in
dication of conditions on the reservation.
