# Polish Exile Leader Cites Red Tortures
## 
### BILL REPPY 
A courageous Polish patriot
last night told a spell bound Cub
berley audience how he was tor
tured and brainwashed by the
Russian Communists and then
said that the Reds are using the
same psychological techniques on
nations of the free world in to
day’s cold war.
Sbigniew Stypulkowski, Vice-
Premier of the Polish government
in exile, in London, said that, like
a Russian prisoner, a nation can
not buy her way out or compro
mise and expect to triumph.
“THUS MODERN war of nerves
--and it is indeed a war—can’t
be won by defense alone,” Sty
pulkowski said. The West must
take the offensive with a real
fanaticism for her ideals.
Stypulkowski, leader of the Po
lish underground movement in
World War 11, was captured by
the Communists on a ruse. Pro
posing Russo-Polish negotiations
in March 1945, Soviet Marshal
Shukov offered Stypulkowski and
his comrades “safe conduct guar
antees.” They soon found them
selves in a Moscow prison.
STYPULKOWSKI was then
forced to endure 141 “interroga
tion” session with a “judge,” ac
tually a kind of “psychological
torturer.”
The “judge” has three main
tasks, he said; (1) To discover
the prisoner’s background, will
power, and ambition: (2) To af
fect his imagination, ruin his men
tal balance through sudden
changes of mood, plying him with
hope and optimism, then plung
ing him into utter despair; and
(3) To distort his healthy in
stinct of self preservation.
The Communists also used
“mechanical pressures.” Stypul
kowski listed them as hunger,
cold, sleeplessness, bright light,
and an atmosphere of terror the
atrically arranged.
Always the prisoner had to face
the bright light, he said. Guards
prevented prisoners from warm
ing their hands under their blan
kets until the hands “became so
painful, stiff, and cold that sleep
was impossible.”
A DIET of water, bread, cab
bage, and barley kept the victims
in a state of animal hunger, Sty
pulkowski said.
But lack of sleep was the woi’st
torture, ho said. Mental agony
became a chronic disease and
men lived in a state of semi-con
sciousness. “This psychological
softening-up process reduces pris
oners to the level of powerless
automatons,” ho said.
“His eyes become wild, his
changed beyond recognition: he
shivers constantly and clings to
life with his whole body,” the
Pole said. “His mind is ready to
accept anything the ‘judge’ tells
him, to admit anything that will
get him out of prison. Worst of
all, he still believes he is using
his powers of reason.”
Why didn’t Stypulkowski “con
fess?” I was younger and strong
er than many prisoners, and had
previous experience in enemy
prisons, he said. “Yet more than
once I was at the limit of my
physical and mental powers and
it was with a feeling of physical

pain that I held back the required
confession,” he said.
HIS COURAGE stemmed part
ly from a desire to defeat the
‘judge’ in their personal battle.
But far more important in beat
ing this system of psychological
brainwashing, he said, is the abil
ity to resort to the strongest ele
ments of a man’s spirit his
sense of duty, patriotism, and
love of freedom.
The interminable conversations
and conferences that mark Rus
sian foreign policy today are
strikingly similar to the endless
interrogation sessions with the
“judge,” Stypulkowski said. “The
Communists use these confer
ences not for peaceful persuasion
or the hope of compromise but to
break down psychologically the
peoples of the free world.”
Another technique carried
from brainwashing to internation
al relations is the continual
change of mood aimed at destroy
ing the mental balance of west
ern nations. The Reds give the
free world reason to be optimistic
about peace, then turn to new
aggression which frustrates the
free nations even more than be
fore, he said.
The West must not let any na
tion feel isolated, Stypulkowski
warned. “Leaving Hungary iso
lated in the 1956 uprising hurt
U.S. prestige more than Red bru
tality hurt the Russians’ position
in Asia, Africa, and even Europe,”
he said.


SBIGNIEW STYPULKOWSKI, Vice-Premier of the Polish Government
in exile, delivered the Tuesday Evening Series talk last night at
Cubberley.
