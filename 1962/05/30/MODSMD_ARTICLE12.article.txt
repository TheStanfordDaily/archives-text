# University Loses One of Great Deans
## 
### 
Doan Craig is going to Ecuador. Stanford, on the other hand,
is staying here.
William G. Craig is one of the great deans of American uni
versities. As a counselor he is one of the most highly thought of in
the country. This year he was president of the American College
Personnel Association. He is held in the highest esteem by deans
all over the United States.
Craig’s reputation with the students of Stanford is comparable.
It is hard to find a man in the University who is more universally
respected.
The reasons for this attitude center around the fact that Craig
is a man of great courage. He is always frank; he consistently
speaks his mind whether he is addressing students, faculty or ad
ministration, whether his viewpoint is popular or not.
Dean Craig defines his role as that of an educator rather than
that of an administrator or a disciplinarian.
For Craig, the University should be concerned with the areas
of student life “which deal with man, the citizen, possessing a
strong set of values and committed to a philosophy of life. It is
possible for colleges and universities to be helpful but not pater
nal—to be concerned but not overly concerned—to allow individu
als the freedom to grow and develop as individuals—but not to be
so permissive as to send students away without commitments.”
This is the philosophy behind Dean Craig’s constant communi
cation with students. He sees the changes in an individual as
occurring in other than formal, academic ways; he wants to make
these ways as educational as possible.
This is why he has tried to build a University house plan.
When he came here in 1955, housing was just housing. The resi
dence system as it exists today is largely the result of his efforts.
This is also why he believes that students should participate in
and take responsibility for their own affairs.
Dean Craig has represented the student viewpoint more active
ly than probably anyone else in the University, especially this
year when students have been steadily striving to be heard.
He is the one man in the administration to whom students can
go for a straight answer; he is the one man to whom they can ex
press their own points of view without fear.
The loss to the University is more than that of a highly capable
administrator. It is a sign that the University is not able to keep
a man who sees the role of a dean as that of an educator. Allard
Lowenstein, a man whose potential is that of a dean of Craig’s
caliber and who sees his role in the same light, is leaving at the
end of this year also. Because he has only been here one year, his
loss at this point is not as great. But in terms of how the Univer
sity sees its deans, in terms of the role that they play in the context
of the University, these losses are symptomatic.
Another man with Craig’s integrity will be hard to find.
