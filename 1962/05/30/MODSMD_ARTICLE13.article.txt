DEAN CRAIG
Editor, The Daily:
And now we’ve lost Dean Craig.
As resident assistants sharing a
total of three years experience on
the dean’s staff, the dismal news
prompts a sadly familiar, cynical
response: it follows from the in
eluctable logic of events that this
final, bitter blow seemed only a
matter of time.
One wearies of the repeated
psychological Pearl Harbor s
which occur with morale-shatter
ing predictability as symptoms of
Stanford’s well-advertised syn
drome of hyper-caution. We knew
Dean Craig as a sympathetic and
accessible boss, as a dean whose
essential ability to be tough was
tempered by genuine humanitari
an concern, and finally, as a man
entrusted with little real power
who was frustrated by his inabili
ty to make good to the students
his promise of increased freedom
with responsibility.
THE EQUIVOCATION and even
occasional duplicity of his admin
istrative peers and superiors pale
beside his bold pronouncements
regarding a philosophy of univer
sity residence, increased student
responsibility, academic freedom,

coed housing, liquor policy, and
the myriad related issues which
impinge upon the university’s
progress.
We are not embarrassed by this
panegyric, although Dean Craig
may well be. Nor are we privy to
any inside dope; the dean was
loyal to the administration a
quality, given the apparent la
cuna between his convictions and
theirs, surely painful at times to
maintain. We only infer from the
sum of things that Dean Craig
wearied under the burden of Si
syphus and sought greener pas
tures.
As graduate students in the
humanities and social sciences,
we know full well that such un
documented inferences are not
proper scholarship, but we feel
that our collective experiences—
ours, and yours—conspire largely
to justify our distasteful cynicism
and throw the burden of proof
upon the administration.
PERHAPS THEY, as we, are
genuinely sad to see him go. But
we could have done nothing about
it.
