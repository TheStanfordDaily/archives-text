. . . Phi Beta Kappa. Democrat.
THOUGH A SCHOLAR and a
politically active citizen always,
the political affiliation of H. Stu
art Hughes is not the certainty
implied by the current edition of
Who’s Who and the Dictionary of
American Scholars.
Bucking a Kennedy, a McCor
mick and a Lodge in the Massa
chusetts Senatorial race this No
vember, Hughes is currently cam
paigning actively as an independ
ent, running on a disarmament
platform.
Hughes’ reasons for running,
his chances of election, and the
content of his position stand as a
matter of interest to not only the
citizens of Massachusetts, but to
all concerned with cold war for
eign policy, all who feel a certain
ethnic interest in former Stan
ford professors and department
heads, and all 600-plus students
of History 104 who find Hughes’
500-page “Contemporary Europe’’
the required text.
WHEN HUGHES WAS in Cali
fornia, he was an active Demo
crat and spoken of in many cir
cles as a possible candidate for
Congress or the Governor’s chair
in 1956. Today, as an independent,
Hughes states in a letter to this
reporter: “The Democratic Party
in Massachusetts is much differ
ent from what it is in California
—here it is corrupt, unimagina
tive, and virtually a closed cor
poration of professional politici
ans. I found in Massachusetts no
parallel to the grassroots Demo
cratic Club movement in which I
was active in California between
1952 and 1956.’’
Hughes stands in opposition to
both Democratic and Republican
parties. His letter goes on to say,
“I am taxing both major parties
with their failure to advance
swiftly enough on civil rights and
with their similar failure to put
public welfare ahead of private
affluence.
“I decided to run in the middle
of March when a number of rep
resentatives of peace and disar
mament organizations approach
ed me.
“I CONTEND THAT getting
elected is not the main point; the
main point is to make a dent in
the American political consensus
by taking a strong stand on the
decisive isues of war and peace
and locating the public backing
that exists for this stand.”
Hughes, Sidney Hook, Hans
Morgenthau and C. P. Snow met
late last year for a three-hour
round-table discussion on the
moral and political questions sur
rounding the possibility of a nu

clear war, at the invitation of
Commentary magazine (a liberal
monthly published by the Ameri
can Jewish Committee i.
At that time Hughes stated his
philosophy, which represents the
essence of his current Massachu
sets campaign:
“ . . . I’m not a pacifist, but as
a historian, I find very few wars
worth fighting. . . . My position
would be a non-pacifist one, but
one extremely skeptical of wars
in any case, and totally skeptical
of wars of mass destruction.
”... It seems, then, we have
to face the old ‘Red or Dead?’
question ...to speak very
crudely, I'm on the rod side of
this. . . . But let me suggest in
this connection that people who
hold my views do not think they
are inviting Soviet conquest and
do not believe in surrender. We
believe that the enemy should be
met with real force, but real
force on a human scale which
would give men the old alterna
tive of making a personal choice
as to whether they wanted to
die . . .
“SO, MY POINT of view is:
Yes, we should be prepared to
fight and to fight hard—but with
conventional weapons, by guer
rilla warfare, militia-type organi
zations, passive resistance, under
ground activity, and the most im
portant task for this country is
to begin to study these methods.
“I dislike the term unilateral
disarmament without qualifica
tion because it sounds as though
one is going to strip down to
one’s underwear shorts tomor
row, and that is not it. It; would
be a question of starting a move
ment in this direction. Renounc
ing deterrence as an instrument
of foreign policy might, I think,
invite or at least facilitate Soviet
penetration of certain areas, par
ticularly in the underdeveloped
world, but these areas are large
ly indefensible anyway. ... I
think in Europe deterrence has
not deterred anything.
"... Under present conditions,
. . . thermonuclear war is a vir
tual certainty. Surrender is mere
ly a risk.”
Hughes sees his role as bring
ing to the attention of the Ameri
can people, the voters of Massa
chusetts, an alternale possibility
in the arms race.
ACCORDING to one of Hughes’
colleagues, currently a fellow at
the Stanford Behavioral Sciences
Center, “Stuart feels the choice
open to the mass of voters is not
great; that all there is is ‘cold war
vocabulary’ of Lodge, Kennedy,
McCormick. ... He feels that
when the chips are down, both
major parties compromise to
keep all major interest groups
happy.”
Hughes is hoping that his open
ing up of the range of argument
will force a definitive stand onto

the major opposing candidates.
That he does not consider his
goals in terms of election is evi
denced by the fact that, to the
knowledge of his colleagues, he
has not applied for leave from
Harvard, nor has he told a col
league with whom he plans to
teach a course next fall of the
possibility of his not remaining
at Harvard. __ *
When asked by this reporter of
his “maximum and minimum
aims” in the race, Hughes re
plied, “I think it is impossible to
speak in terms of maximum and
minimum aims, Anything more
than 5,000 votes in November
would represent progress over
the present state of the peace
movement. A balance of power
position swinging the election to
one major party candidate or the
other would represent a real tri
umph.”
HUGHES’ CANDIDACY is part
of his philosophy of the role of
the intellectual. In late 1956, he
declared in Commentary, the in
tellectual “faces a dubious future.
He will confront a public only
sporadically (and then often dan
gerously), interested in what he
does. He will be obliged to with
stand the almost irresistible pres
sures urging him in subtle fash
ion toward conformity to the role
of a mental technician. ... He
may himself begin to doubt the
relevance of his pursuits. His
path will be a very special one: it
will not bo for the half-hearted,”
And five years later, in his new
ly released volume “An Approach
to Peace and other essays” (cur
rently on sale in the Stanford
Bookstore), Hughes remarks that
his book “treats of people like
myself; American writers and
teachers. Here 1 contend that we
are not living up to our responsi
bilities, that we have failed to re
sist with enough determination
the pressures toward cultural ban
ality and the threat of thermo
nuclear war. . . .
“I have a sense of attempting
in extrimis to give voice to the
common interests of a humanity
transcending the barriers drawn
by the cold war, before the blight
of national and ideological hatred
descends on us once again.”
HUGHES OPENS his contro
versial work by stating, “I think
it is time to make a new start. It
is time to rethink from the be
ginning the assumptions on which
American foreign policy and
nearly all public discussion of
that policy are currently based.
We need to establish a now order
of priorities and a new hierarchy
of values.
“The way to begin is to reverse
the usual definition of our enemy
. . . we are assured that Commu
nism is worse than war. I suggest
we reverse that order; . . . that
war itself rather than Commu
nism is our number one enemy.”

WHEN HUGHES WAS in Cali

crat and spoken of in many cir

Hughes stands in opposition to

Hughes, Sidney Hook, Hans
Morgenthau and C. P. Snow met
late last year for a three-hour
round-table discussion on the
moral and political questions sur
rounding the possibility of a nu

clear war, at the invitation of
Commentary magazine (a liberal
monthly published by the Ameri
can Jewish Committee i.
At that time Hughes stated his
philosophy, which represents the
essence of his current Massachu
sets campaign:
“ . . . I’m not a pacifist, but as
a historian, I find very few wars
worth fighting. . . . My position
would be a non-pacifist one, but
one extremely skeptical of wars
in any case, and totally skeptical
of wars of mass destruction.
”... It seems, then, we have
to face the old ‘Red or Dead?’
question ...to speak very
crudely, I'm on the rod side of
this. . . . But let me suggest in
this connection that people who
hold my views do not think they
are inviting Soviet conquest and
do not believe in surrender. We
believe that the enemy should be
met with real force, but real
force on a human scale which
would give men the old alterna
tive of making a personal choice
as to whether they wanted to
die . . .
“SO, MY POINT of view is:
Yes, we should be prepared to
fight and to fight hard—but with
conventional weapons, by guer
rilla warfare, militia-type organi
zations, passive resistance, under
ground activity, and the most im
portant task for this country is
to begin to study these methods.
“I dislike the term unilateral
disarmament without qualifica
tion because it sounds as though
one is going to strip down to
one’s underwear shorts tomor
row, and that is not it. It; would
be a question of starting a move
ment in this direction. Renounc
ing deterrence as an instrument
of foreign policy might, I think,
invite or at least facilitate Soviet
penetration of certain areas, par
ticularly in the underdeveloped
world, but these areas are large
ly indefensible anyway. ... I
think in Europe deterrence has
not deterred anything.
"... Under present conditions,
. . . thermonuclear war is a vir
tual certainty. Surrender is mere
ly a risk.”
Hughes sees his role as bring
ing to the attention of the Ameri
can people, the voters of Massa
chusetts, an alternale possibility
in the arms race.
ACCORDING to one of Hughes’
colleagues, currently a fellow at
the Stanford Behavioral Sciences
Center, “Stuart feels the choice
open to the mass of voters is not
great; that all there is is ‘cold war
vocabulary’ of Lodge, Kennedy,
McCormick. ... He feels that
when the chips are down, both
major parties compromise to
keep all major interest groups
happy.”
Hughes is hoping that his open
ing up of the range of argument
will force a definitive stand onto

the major opposing candidates.
That he does not consider his
goals in terms of election is evi
denced by the fact that, to the
knowledge of his colleagues, he
has not applied for leave from
Harvard, nor has he told a col
league with whom he plans to
teach a course next fall of the
possibility of his not remaining
at Harvard. __ *
When asked by this reporter of
his “maximum and minimum
aims” in the race, Hughes re
plied, “I think it is impossible to

WHEN HUGHES WAS in Cali

crat and spoken of in many cir

Congress or the Governor’s chair

Hughes states in a letter to this

cratic Club movement in which I
was active in California between
1952 and 1956.’’
Hughes stands in opposition to
both Democratic and Republican
parties. His letter goes on to say,
“I am taxing both major parties
with their failure to advance
swiftly enough on civil rights and
with their similar failure to put
public welfare ahead of private
affluence.
“I decided to run in the middle
of March when a number of rep

“I CONTEND THAT getting
elected is not the main point; the

and locating the public backing

Hughes, Sidney Hook, Hans
Morgenthau and C. P. Snow met
late last year for a three-hour
round-table discussion on the
moral and political questions sur
rounding the possibility of a nu

clear war, at the invitation of
Commentary magazine (a liberal
monthly published by the Ameri
can Jewish Committee i.
At that time Hughes stated his
philosophy, which represents the
essence of his current Massachu
sets campaign:
“ . . . I’m not a pacifist, but as
a historian, I find very few wars
worth fighting. . . . My position
would be a non-pacifist one, but
one extremely skeptical of wars
in any case, and totally skeptical
of wars of mass destruction.
”... It seems, then, we have
to face the old ‘Red or Dead?’
question ...to speak very
crudely, I'm on the rod side of
this. . . . But let me suggest in
this connection that people who
hold my views do not think they
are inviting Soviet conquest and
do not believe in surrender. We
believe that the enemy should be
met with real force, but real
force on a human scale which
would give men the old alterna
tive of making a personal choice
as to whether they wanted to
die . . .
“SO, MY POINT of view is:
Yes, we should be prepared to
fight and to fight hard—but with
conventional weapons, by guer
rilla warfare, militia-type organi
zations, passive resistance, under
ground activity, and the most im
portant task for this country is
to begin to study these methods.
“I dislike the term unilateral

do not believe in surrender. We
believe that the enemy should be
met with real force, but real
force on a human scale which
would give men the old alterna

“SO, MY POINT of view is:

to begin to study these methods.
“I dislike the term unilateral

be a question of starting a move

HUGHES’ CANDIDACY is part

THOUGH A SCHOLAR and a
politically active citizen always,
the political affiliation of H. Stu
art Hughes is not the certainty
implied by the current edition of
Who’s Who and the Dictionary of
American Scholars.
Bucking a Kennedy, a McCor
mick and a Lodge in the Massa
chusetts Senatorial race this No
vember, Hughes is currently cam
paigning actively as an independ
ent, running on a disarmament
platform.
Hughes’ reasons for running,
his chances of election, and the
content of his position stand as a
matter of interest to not only the
citizens of Massachusetts, but to
all concerned with cold war for
eign policy, all who feel a certain
ethnic interest in former Stan
ford professors and department
heads, and all 600-plus students
of History 104 who find Hughes’
500-page “Contemporary Europe’’
the required text.
WHEN HUGHES WAS in Cali
fornia, he was an active Demo
crat and spoken of in many cir
cles as a possible candidate for
Congress or the Governor’s chair
in 1956. Today, as an independent,
Hughes states in a letter to this
reporter: “The Democratic Party
in Massachusetts is much differ
ent from what it is in California
—here it is corrupt, unimagina
tive, and virtually a closed cor
poration of professional politici
ans. I found in Massachusetts no
parallel to the grassroots Demo
cratic Club movement in which I
was active in California between
1952 and 1956.’’
Hughes stands in opposition to
both Democratic and Republican
parties. His letter goes on to say,
“I am taxing both major parties
with their failure to advance
swiftly enough on civil rights and
with their similar failure to put
public welfare ahead of private
affluence.
“I decided to run in the middle
of March when a number of rep
resentatives of peace and disar
mament organizations approach
ed me.
“I CONTEND THAT getting
elected is not the main point; the
main point is to make a dent in
the American political consensus
by taking a strong stand on the
decisive isues of war and peace
and locating the public backing
that exists for this stand.”
Hughes, Sidney Hook, Hans
Morgenthau and C. P. Snow met
late last year for a three-hour
round-table discussion on the
moral and political questions sur
rounding the possibility of a nu

clear war, at the invitation of
Commentary magazine (a liberal
monthly published by the Ameri
can Jewish Committee i.
At that time Hughes stated his
philosophy, which represents the
essence of his current Massachu
sets campaign:
“ . . . I’m not a pacifist, but as
a historian, I find very few wars
worth fighting. . . . My position
would be a non-pacifist one, but
one extremely skeptical of wars
in any case, and totally skeptical
of wars of mass destruction.
”... It seems, then, we have
to face the old ‘Red or Dead?’
question ...to speak very
crudely, I'm on the rod side of
this. . . . But let me suggest in
this connection that people who
hold my views do not think they
are inviting Soviet conquest and
do not believe in surrender. We
believe that the enemy should be
met with real force, but real
force on a human scale which
would give men the old alterna
tive of making a personal choice
as to whether they wanted to
die . . .
“SO, MY POINT of view is:
Yes, we should be prepared to
fight and to fight hard—but with
conventional weapons, by guer
rilla warfare, militia-type organi
zations, passive resistance, under
ground activity, and the most im
portant task for this country is
to begin to study these methods.
“I dislike the term unilateral
disarmament without qualifica
tion because it sounds as though
one is going to strip down to
one’s underwear shorts tomor
row, and that is not it. It; would
be a question of starting a move
ment in this direction. Renounc
ing deterrence as an instrument
of foreign policy might, I think,
invite or at least facilitate Soviet
penetration of certain areas, par
ticularly in the underdeveloped
world, but these areas are large
ly indefensible anyway. ... I
think in Europe deterrence has
not deterred anything.
"... Under present conditions,
. . . thermonuclear war is a vir
tual certainty. Surrender is mere
ly a risk.”
Hughes sees his role as bring
ing to the attention of the Ameri
can people, the voters of Massa
chusetts, an alternale possibility
in the arms race.
ACCORDING to one of Hughes’
colleagues, currently a fellow at
the Stanford Behavioral Sciences
Center, “Stuart feels the choice
open to the mass of voters is not
great; that all there is is ‘cold war
vocabulary’ of Lodge, Kennedy,
McCormick. ... He feels that
when the chips are down, both
major parties compromise to
keep all major interest groups
happy.”
Hughes is hoping that his open
ing up of the range of argument
will force a definitive stand onto

the major opposing candidates.
That he does not consider his
goals in terms of election is evi
denced by the fact that, to the
knowledge of his colleagues, he
has not applied for leave from
Harvard, nor has he told a col
league with whom he plans to
teach a course next fall of the
possibility of his not remaining
at Harvard. __ *
When asked by this reporter of
his “maximum and minimum
aims” in the race, Hughes re
plied, “I think it is impossible to
speak in terms of maximum and
minimum aims, Anything more
than 5,000 votes in November
would represent progress over
the present state of the peace
movement. A balance of power
position swinging the election to
one major party candidate or the
other would represent a real tri
umph.”
HUGHES’ CANDIDACY is part
of his philosophy of the role of
the intellectual. In late 1956, he
declared in Commentary, the in
tellectual “faces a dubious future.
He will confront a public only
sporadically (and then often dan
gerously), interested in what he
does. He will be obliged to with
stand the almost irresistible pres
sures urging him in subtle fash
ion toward conformity to the role
of a mental technician. ... He
may himself begin to doubt the
relevance of his pursuits. His
path will be a very special one: it
will not bo for the half-hearted,”
And five years later, in his new
ly released volume “An Approach
to Peace and other essays” (cur
rently on sale in the Stanford
Bookstore), Hughes remarks that
his book “treats of people like
myself; American writers and
teachers. Here 1 contend that we
are not living up to our responsi
bilities, that we have failed to re
sist with enough determination
the pressures toward cultural ban
ality and the threat of thermo
nuclear war. . . .
“I have a sense of attempting
in extrimis to give voice to the
common interests of a humanity
transcending the barriers drawn
by the cold war, before the blight
of national and ideological hatred
descends on us once again.”
HUGHES OPENS his contro
versial work by stating, “I think
it is time to make a new start. It
is time to rethink from the be
ginning the assumptions on which
American foreign policy and
nearly all public discussion of
that policy are currently based.
We need to establish a now order
of priorities and a new hierarchy
of values.
“The way to begin is to reverse
the usual definition of our enemy
. . . we are assured that Commu
nism is worse than war. I suggest
we reverse that order; . . . that
war itself rather than Commu
nism is our number one enemy.”
