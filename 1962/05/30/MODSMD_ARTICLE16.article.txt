## U.S. Lacks Long Range Planning in S. Viet Nam 
### DEAN SAVAGE 
At the present time U.S. policy
in South Viet Nam appears to be
a military holding action, exten
sive enough to be called an “un
declared war,” but with little
thought to long-range planning.
Seven thousand U.S. troops
(many in actual combat) and a
great amount of equipment and
money have been sent to South
Viet Nam in an effort to back up
Ngo Dinh Diem’s struggle against
the 18,000 Vietcong guerrilla
force. The struggle has been made
more difficult by the fact that
Diem is an unpopular dictator
and Vietnamese villagers are
helping the Vietcong.
To counteract this assistance,
the U.S. has promoted “Operation
Sunrise,” a compulsory resettle
ment program similar to one fol
lowed in the Malayan Emergency.
Villagers suspected of aiding the
Communists are resettled, with
out advance warning, in com
pounds surrounded by barbed
wire. Their former homes are
burned. Understandably, the pro
gram is not popular.
TO MAKE it worse, it will not
work in South Viet Nam, al
though it was successful in Ma
laya. Malaya is a long narrow
peninsula, easily (x’elatively) se
cured against infiltration; South
Viet Nam is open on three sides.
The Communists in Malaya were
Chinese, while the villagers were
Malays; the Vietcong are Viet
namese, indistiguishable, and able
to rely on blood lies for support.
Further, the British were popu
lar; Diem is not.
In the meantime, the imple
mentation of “Operation Sunrise”
has resulted in neglect of the
regular AID program, since Unit
ed States Operations Mission
staff members are assigned to
the now project. This might be
remedieti by the expansion of the
mission (a difficult thing to ar
range) but there is a more serious
side to the problem.

It is debatable whether the pro
gram is aimed in the right direc
tion when operating at any level.
Professor Harold Child of the
Stanford economics department,
and recently with USOM in Sai
gon, has pointed out that only
two members of the mission staff
have had any training in econom
ics, and that the general feeling
was for a curtailment of aid at a
time when the most difficult
stage of development has just
been reached. When asked about
the program for long range de
velopment in Viet Nam, ho re
plied that, as far as he could tell,
there was no long range program.
THIS IS A striking symptom
of shortsightedness on the part
of policy makers, a phenomenon
which almost inexplicably con
tinues to occur.

Military action, however neces
sary, is nearly always a stop-gap
measure, a fact apparently ob
scured by the recent crises. More
important than the military, there
must be a well-thought out plan
for social and economic progress
to eliminate sources of social un
rest if we are not merely to add
to the evidence for the molehole
theory of foreign aid.
The fact of our support for
Diem, a dictator surrounded by a
corrupt bureaucracy and an an
tagonistic populace, is unfortu
nate, but it was not easily avoid
able. A difficulty endemic to un
derdeveloped areas, it is perhaps
the stickiest problem in the Viet
namese situation. Still, it does not
explain the selection of a policy
such as “Operation Sunrise,”
which has so little chance for suc
cess, and with which the name of
the U.S. will be associated in Viet
Nam for years to come.
AND THEBE can be no excuse
for the failure to allot time and
money and trained men to long
range development planning for
South Viet Nam. The very things
we fail to consider are those most
essential to the success of our
policy.

has resulted in neglect of the
regular AID program, since Unit
ed States Operations Mission
staff members are assigned to
the now project. This might be
remedieti by the expansion of the
mission (a difficult thing to ar
range) but there is a more serious
side to the problem.

It is debatable whether the pro
gram is aimed in the right direc
tion when operating at any level.
Professor Harold Child of the
Stanford economics department,
and recently with USOM in Sai
gon, has pointed out that only
two members of the mission staff
have had any training in econom
ics, and that the general feeling
was for a curtailment of aid at a
time when the most difficult
stage of development has just
been reached. When asked about
the program for long range de
velopment in Viet Nam, ho re
plied that, as far as he could tell,
there was no long range program.
THIS IS A striking symptom
of shortsightedness on the part
of policy makers, a phenomenon
which almost inexplicably con
tinues to occur.

Military action, however neces
sary, is nearly always a stop-gap
measure, a fact apparently ob
scured by the recent crises. More
important than the military, there
must be a well-thought out plan
for social and economic progress
to eliminate sources of social un
rest if we are not merely to add
to the evidence for the molehole
theory of foreign aid.
The fact of our support for
Diem, a dictator surrounded by a
corrupt bureaucracy and an an
tagonistic populace, is unfortu
nate, but it was not easily avoid
able. A difficulty endemic to un
derdeveloped areas, it is perhaps
the stickiest problem in the Viet
namese situation. Still, it does not
explain the selection of a policy
such as “Operation Sunrise,”
which has so little chance for suc
cess, and with which the name of
the U.S. will be associated in Viet
Nam for years to come.
AND THEBE can be no excuse
for the failure to allot time and
money and trained men to long
range development planning for
South Viet Nam. The very things
we fail to consider are those most
essential to the success of our
policy.
At the present time U.S. policy
in South Viet Nam appears to be
a military holding action, exten
sive enough to be called an “un
declared war,” but with little
thought to long-range planning.
Seven thousand U.S. troops
(many in actual combat) and a
great amount of equipment and
money have been sent to South
Viet Nam in an effort to back up
Ngo Dinh Diem’s struggle against
the 18,000 Vietcong guerrilla
force. The struggle has been made
more difficult by the fact that
Diem is an unpopular dictator
and Vietnamese villagers are
helping the Vietcong.
To counteract this assistance,
the U.S. has promoted “Operation
Sunrise,” a compulsory resettle
ment program similar to one fol
lowed in the Malayan Emergency.
Villagers suspected of aiding the
Communists are resettled, with
out advance warning, in com
pounds surrounded by barbed
wire. Their former homes are
burned. Understandably, the pro
gram is not popular.
TO MAKE it worse, it will not
work in South Viet Nam, al
though it was successful in Ma
laya. Malaya is a long narrow
peninsula, easily (x’elatively) se
cured against infiltration; South
Viet Nam is open on three sides.
The Communists in Malaya were
Chinese, while the villagers were
Malays; the Vietcong are Viet
namese, indistiguishable, and able
to rely on blood lies for support.

derdeveloped areas, it is perhaps
the stickiest problem in the Viet
namese situation. Still, it does not
explain the selection of a policy
such as “Operation Sunrise,”
which has so little chance for suc
cess, and with which the name of
the U.S. will be associated in Viet
Nam for years to come.
AND THEBE can be no excuse
for the failure to allot time and
money and trained men to long
range development planning for
South Viet Nam. The very things
we fail to consider are those most
essential to the success of our
policy.
