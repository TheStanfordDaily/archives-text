ATTACKED PRIDE
Editor, The Daily:
I have to defend an attacked
pride. Oftentimes, while discus
sing with American students on
campus, I have had to disprove
the opinion that the French that
is spoken in the province of Que
bec in Canada is extremely differ
ent from Parisian French.
It is even implied that the Ca
nadian French is more like the
18th century French than any
thing else. What a ridiculous idea!
The French language is the
French language whether in Bel
gium, Switzerland, or Canada.
THE ACCENT is different in
Canada. I agree wholeheartedly.
A well-educated French-Canadian
person will speak the same (and
let me insist on it) French as a
Frenchman will, with a different
accent.
Of course some expressions
are different, but it does not
mean that they are not French.
Some French Canadians speak
bad French simply because of a
lack of education, not because the
French is different.
The French people of Canada
recognize hut one French and it
is based upon the same rules of
grammar as the one which is
used in France. For instance
most of my professors at the Uni
vei’site de Montreal were Parisi
ans from the Ecole Polytechnique
de Paris. I must say that we had
a common language, but a differ
ent accent. We understood each
other perfectly well.
THE GOVERNMENT of the
province of Quebec has created a
Ministry of Cultural Affairs to
sec to it that the French language
is respected and spoken as it
should be. Please think it over
twice when you want to insinuate
such things.

TO THINK ABOUT
Editor, The Daily:
Here is something for students,
faculty, and administrators to
think about as they benignly re
tire into summer apathy:
Though it is generally agreed
that the purpose of education is
“learning how to live,’’ it has al
ways remained a point of argu
ment as to whether the larger
burden of responsibility for edu
cation rests upon the student or
the educator. One thing is cer
tain: the educator has some re
sponsibility. And to the extent
that part of that responsibility
concerns the provision by the edu
cating body of an environment
conducive to the growth of intel
lectual awareness and a critical
spirit in the student, I feel that
the following abjurations of re
sponsibility ought to be noted;
a) the failure of this university
to maintain a library adequate to
withstand the student’s pressing
need for books for term papers
and final exam preparation;
b) the failure of this Universi
ty to hire men and women willing
and able to rise to the challenge
of leaching Stanford students in
a manner which is enthusiastic,
informed, humanistic, and at a
level which is not an insult to the
student’s intelligence;
c) the failure of this Universi
ty to encourage freedom of
thought and expression among
undergraduates, to give them a
real voice in making important
decisions affecting (hem, and to
regard the students as anything
more than immature, sentient
sponges;
d) the failure of (his Universi
ty to recognize that women in
American society have been given
equal rights;
e) the failure of this Universi
ty to provide adequate housing,

ATTACKED PRIDE
Editor, The Daily:
I have to defend an attacked
pride. Oftentimes, while discus
sing with American students on
campus, I have had to disprove
the opinion that the French that
is spoken in the province of Que
bec in Canada is extremely differ
ent from Parisian French.
It is even implied that the Ca
nadian French is more like the
18th century French than any
thing else. What a ridiculous idea!
The French language is the
French language whether in Bel
gium, Switzerland, or Canada.
THE ACCENT is different in
Canada. I agree wholeheartedly.
A well-educated French-Canadian
person will speak the same (and
let me insist on it) French as a
Frenchman will, with a different
accent.
Of course some expressions
are different, but it does not
mean that they are not French.
Some French Canadians speak
bad French simply because of a
lack of education, not because the
French is different.
The French people of Canada
recognize hut one French and it
is based upon the same rules of
grammar as the one which is
used in France. For instance
most of my professors at the Uni
vei’site de Montreal were Parisi
ans from the Ecole Polytechnique
de Paris. I must say that we had
a common language, but a differ
ent accent. We understood each
other perfectly well.
THE GOVERNMENT of the
province of Quebec has created a
Ministry of Cultural Affairs to
sec to it that the French language
is respected and spoken as it
should be. Please think it over
twice when you want to insinuate
such things.

TO THINK ABOUT
Editor, The Daily:
Here is something for students,
faculty, and administrators to
think about as they benignly re
tire into summer apathy:
Though it is generally agreed
that the purpose of education is
“learning how to live,’’ it has al
ways remained a point of argu
ment as to whether the larger
burden of responsibility for edu
cation rests upon the student or
the educator. One thing is cer
tain: the educator has some re
sponsibility. And to the extent
that part of that responsibility
concerns the provision by the edu
cating body of an environment
conducive to the growth of intel
lectual awareness and a critical
spirit in the student, I feel that
the following abjurations of re
sponsibility ought to be noted;
a) the failure of this university
to maintain a library adequate to
withstand the student’s pressing
need for books for term papers
and final exam preparation;
b) the failure of this Universi
ty to hire men and women willing
and able to rise to the challenge
of leaching Stanford students in
a manner which is enthusiastic,
informed, humanistic, and at a
level which is not an insult to the
student’s intelligence;
