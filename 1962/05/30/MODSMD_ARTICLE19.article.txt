ERROR
Editor, The Daily:
A regrettable error appeared
in an advertisement under my
name in The Daily of May 27,
1962. Using a “Fact Sheet’’ posted
by a supposedly pro-NSA group
as a source, my committee came
to believe that NSA had once been
on the Attorney General’s list.
Upon checking that list I could
not find NSA and must conclude
that our information is wrong. I
then retract that statement about
NSA and declare that it should
not be used in judging NSA.

NO SUPPORT
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial of May 21 has the
format of an open letter to Presi
dent Sterling and the Board of
Trustees from the students of
Stanford. But in fact The Daily
voices the opinion of a very few
staff members, who may or may
not have the support of the stu
dent body. 1 fail to support The
Daily’s stand on the University
liquor policy.
As presented by The Daily in
these past weeks, there is some
basic freedom being denied Stan
ford students by the present poli
cy. The arguments for liquor on
campus are clothed as a question
of whether the student has the
right to express his opinions and
to expect University action.
The “Can’t Answer File!” edi
torial is similar to the carryings
on of a young boy protesting his
parents’ deaf ear to the com
plaints of “Why do I have to go to
bod at 8 p.m.?” While the editor
may not have anything else to
focus his efforts on than the Ad
ministration’s liquor policy, I

streets, parking, laboratories,
classrooms, bibliographies of sec
ondary sources for classes, an
adequate counseling-advising sys
tem, time to study for final ex
aminations, and an atmosphere
which is pro-intellectual.
(Incidentally, Room and Board
fees are going up next year.)
Verne Reaves

wonder if President Sterling and
the Board of Trustees might have
found some preoccupation that
keeps them from rushing into
such editorial debate.
The Daily editor “understands
. . . but cannot condone” the po
sition of the University. Docs he?
Or is the job of Stanford Univer
sity that of making the access to
liquor’ easy for those who feel it
is one of the essentials of life?
Why, when students feel they are
being slighted by the Administra
tion, do they come up with “Stan
ford cannot hope ... to call it
self a ‘great university’?” I ques
tion that the proposal for liquor
on campus would make Stanford
“greater.”
Or is President Sterling so
completely off base when he
chooses the benefits of a PACE
Program as a goal to be sought
after'? Does the PACE program
warrant as much “student” sup
port as The Daily gives the liquor
policy?

SAYEGH
Editor, The Daily:
In June Dr. Faye;? A. Sayegh
ends a two-year stay at Stanford
as guest lecturer in Philosophy
and Political Science. He goes to
McAllister College in Minnesota
for a year and then to Oxford.
Some of us fortunate enough to
have known Dr. Sayegh during
his stay desire to express our
deep appreciation to him for his
inspiring and objective instruc
tion.
To Stanford Dr. Sayegh brought
a wealth of information and chal
lenging ideas. To his students. Dr.
Sayegh gave unstintingly of his
vast knowledge and experience,
both in class and during many
hours of outside discussions. Dr.
Sayegh’s articulate observations
on the Arab World are supported
by painstaking scholarship. His
high standards and warm per
sonality have been a source of
compelling inspiration to a study
of the Middle East.
The Administration is to be

congratulated for bringing Dr.
Sayegh to the campus, and we
hope it will consider extending an
invitation to him to return.
