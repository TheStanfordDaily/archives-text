NEW YORK ( UPI )—Heavy
Street slump at least temporal"
that brought cheers from trade
Stock Exchange.
After dropping off sharply

“bargain” buying halted the Wall
ily yesterday in a dramatic rally
ts on the floor of the New York

again early yesterday, bine chip
•♦■stocks at midday staged a sudden
I surge. Determined buying wiped
I out the day’s early losses and cut
j deeply into the near record losses
of Monday, when the market suf-
I fered its sharpest drop since the
j great crash of 1929.

Trading yesterday resembled
the worst days of 1929 in volume,
hut this time the trend was up,
not down. At the close of the day’s
trading, the ticker of the New
York Exchange was 2 hours and
23 minutes behind the last trans
action. This meant final indexes
for the day would not bo known
until nightfall.
THI'; HUGE volume of trading
on the “big board” the New
York Stock Exchange carried
over to other exchanges as well.
The American Stock Exchange
reported volume of 5,330,000,
highest of the year. The Midwest
Exchange at Chicago said it had
235,000 shares recorded at 3 p.m.
EDT the same number traded
all day Monday. Volume on the
Pacific Exchange was reported
heavier than Monday also.
Analysts saw three contribu
tory factors in the sudden revers
al of the market from “bearish”
to “bullish:”
• Strong statements from two
cabinet members, Commerce Sec
retary Luther Hodges and Treas
ury Secretary Douglas Dillon, fa
voring personal and corporate tax
cuts perhaps this year and pas
sage of an investment credit plan.

• THE “BARGAIN” attraction
to the general investor of (he low
prices left to major issues after
the sell offs of Friday and Mon
day.
• A decision by brokers’ tech
nicians that market prices had
grounded on the point where they
had to go up.
Traders on the floor of the New
York Exchange broke into cheers
and whistles as the day closed
with visitors jamming the gal
leries looking on.
THE TRADERS staged their
wild demonstration even though
the exchange had notified them
that tomorrow Memorial Day
would be no holiday for many.
Instead, the exchange notified
all member organizations and all
specialists to have their offices
staffed and to provide telephone
service, 9 to 3, to help clear up
the laggard ends of the trading.
The stock averages, those indi
cators watched as a clue to the
general levels of the market, were
left behind the actual trading as
masses of transactions piled up.
For hours, the ticker was carry
ing mostly “flash prices.” show
ing the “big boys” going up.
SOME OF the flash prices
showed American Telephone and
Telegraph, the nation’s most
widely-held stock, turning up
ward. Standard of New Jersey,
another of the 10 leaders from the
standpoint of widespread stock
ownership, also showed a gain.
