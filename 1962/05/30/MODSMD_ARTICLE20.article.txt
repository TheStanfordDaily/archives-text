DISCRIMINATION?
Editor, The Daily:
Discrimination, Dr. Stone? Sure
ly you're only using that bad
word in terms of your own
ideals; surely you don’t really
believe that a man’s right to
choose his own associates is just
a “hairy old answer’’ to your pas
sionate democracy? Well, I'm not
certain it’s that simple.
I doubt that you believe any
more sincerely than I do that all
men are and must be brothers—
yet I also believe that every man
is an individual. For this reason,
I find it hard to imagine your
dreamed-of society in which every
man is equally liked and befriend
| ed by every other man. I suspect
j that secretly, Dr. Slone, you have
I close friends, mere acquaintances,
I and even a few people you don’t
like, just as most people do. And
those friends: do you really
choose them all on “rational and
not prejudicial grounds?”
I’m sure you’re aware that
when a fraternity offers a bid to
a rushee, he makes his own de
cision whether he accepts it or
not. And I’m equally sure that
you don’t actually equate “choos
ing a house” with “taking chances
in a random drawing.”
I could even go so far as to sus
pect that you don’t seriously ex
pect a fraternity system with a
capacity of perhaps 375 men
yearly to pledge all 900 freshman
men. For this limitation, if for no
other, Dr. Stone, fraternities “dis
tinguish” freshmen one from an
other (you’d call it “discrimi
nate”) on the basis of personality
and congeniality with existing
members. Is that really unnatural
—or immoral?

OPEN LETTER
Editor, The Daily:
Open letter to Doctor Wilfred
i Stone:
Dr. Stone, you anticipate objec
| lions to your suggestion to ataol
; ish rush. You suggest that the
I “hairy old answers” about a
i man’s right to choose his associ
ates are inapplicable that when
j one person (or group) exorcises
the right to associate, the person
J rejected by this application is in
j essence having his own right to
| associate violated.
Let's consider another old saw
i “a man’s home is his castle”—

a postulate certainly related to
| the right to associate. In the
| Netherlands, particularly in Am
i sterdam. overcrowding is such
| that a policy has been necessarily
followed recently of compelling
I citizens with large homes to share
I them with people not so fortu
! nate. If this were the case here,
Dr. Stone, would you like to have
| just anyone approach you and
arbitrarily decide to join your
i household who apparently
shares no common interests with
you, whose aims and ideals in life
| are perhaps utterly at variance
' with yours?
Or would you like to reserve
| the right to choose, to find some
one who could- and would live
| harmoniously with your family?
{ A fraternity is not so different
i from a home (a little dirtier, per
j haps), and is forced to take in
| new members—for different rea
sons hut we in fraternities feel
| somewhat as you must feel—we
| want to live comfortably and at
! ease with our members—not to
be forced to constantly adjust and
j compromise when such is not ne

cessary. Wo reserve the right to
associate, and consider “our home
as our castle”— though not in
such terminology. Don’t you feel
the same way about your home?

INEQUALITIES
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Stone has again re
minded us of the inequalities
which frustrate Stanford’s tur
keys, loners, and victims of acne.
Fraternities, however they are
seen, will remain here until the
administration is willing and
able to replace them with other
facilities. Whatever inequalities,
therefore, as may exist to tor
ment the feelings of the uninitiat
ed are not likely to disappear to
morrow morning.
People opposed to present ar
rangements, and they could in
clude fraternity men as well as
those to whom Professor Slone
refers, can do nothing more to
bring on the millenium than to
work with what they have in the
here-and-now, leaving nothing un
done which would yield even (he
barest degree of gradual progress.
Without this effort, and without
encouragement of those who un
dertake it, nothing substantial
will ever be accomplished.
The Row is no more filled with
clear-complexioned, socially ad
justed red-hots than is Stern with
turkeys, loners, and acne suffer
ers. Sigma Nu’s problem with its
discrimination clause is also Pro
fessor Stone’s problem; Profes
sor Stone’s shyest wimp is also
Sigma Nil’s problem.
Rome was not, built in a day,
and unless there is a great deal
more understanding and apprecia
tion of the many difficulties fac
ing all living groups at Stanford,
no residence program here will
ever get off the ground.

ANIMALS
Editor, The Daily:
As one who considered attend
ing that other university that
uses red football jerseys, I have
recently been wondering just
what it is that really distinguishes
Stanford from Harvard. We seem
to exchange professors and in
sults fairly regularly, and I think
we mutually look upon each other
as “pioneer” schools. (Trouble is
that they sometimes unfortunate
ly phrase it: “school for pio
neers.”

I really believe that there is a
tangible difference between the
two schools. It came to me as I
was reading (ho first scene in
“Othello.” What Stanford has
that Harvard can never lay claim
to H suppose because of its ur
ban location.) are beasts. Just
think of the variety that flourish
here! We have “pigs,” “turkeys,”
“cows,” “studs” of all species,
“rats,” and “dogs.” I’m sure there
are several more. And I almost
forgot one classification the
“animal” (not to be confused with
the general sense of the word).
Who said that the “far m” is no
longer productive?
