# Miners' Strike Creates 'Social Crisis' In Spain
## 
### 
Thousands of Spaniards have
been on strike since the end of
April. In Spain striking is con
sidered a crime of revolt against
the state. Strikers have no strike
funds, and a state of emergency
has been proclaimed by the gov
ernment against those who are
exercising a right recognized all
over the democratic world.

The strike has been peaceful
since its beginning. The miners
in the north of Spain demand a
minimum wage of 157 pesetas a
day ($2.50). The minimum wage
at present is 37.75 pesetas ($.55)
a day, which even in Spain is a
hunger wage.
The French newspaper “Le
Monde” reported that it is a
“basically social crisis.” The gov
ernment, on the other hand, in
sists that it is a movement backed
by Communist agitators. This
assertion does not seem to be well
founded, considering that the
Catholic Church leaders have pub
licly backed the strikers in their
demands.
THE STRIKERS in the North
ern mining area spread over the
country in a few weeks. By May
3, over 100,000 workers were on
strike.
University students in Barce
lona and Madrid demonstrated in
sympathy with the strikers; the
police broke up the demonstration
and arrested 25 students. Close
to 300 workers were also arrested
in Asturias, in the Basque Coun
try, and in Madrid.
Funds are being raised all over
Western Europe to help the Span
ish strikers and their families
who desterately need aid, In the
United States the Committee for
a Democratic Spain, presided over
by Waldo Frank, is collecting
money with the same purposes.
An Ad Hoc Committee for Aid
to Spanish Strikers has been set
up at Stanford and asks for con
tributions. The money it collects
will be sent immediately to: The

Committee for a Democratic
Spain, P.O. Box 159, Cathedral
Station, New York 25, N.Y. Con
tributions may be sent to the New
York Committee or contact Bill
Hutchinson, DA 4-1093, 328 Cen
tral Avenue, Menlo Park.
