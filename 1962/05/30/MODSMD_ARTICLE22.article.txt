## 
### 
AIESEC-Stanford, the local com
mittee of an international student
organization dealing in the ex
change of business and manage
ment traineeships, is looking for
help this summer.
The International Association of
Students in Economics and Com
merce will host about 20 foreign
students who will be working in
the Bay Area this summer and
next fall. Help is needed in wel
coming and making contact with
these trainees.
Stanford business students or
upperclassmen who are interested
in practical business training in
another country, are urged to in
vestigate the opportunity.
AIESEC runs the largest such
exchange in the world. It is an
organization with 15 years exper
ience and members in over 275
universities in 38 countries.
Applications for traineeships are
not made until next winter. How
ever, members are urged to work
on the program before seeking
jobs of their own.
A meeting is scheduled for 5
p.m. today in Bowman Alumni
House to introduce the program
to those interested.
