# 'Measure' —'Fine, Polished Theater'
## 
### BILL SMITH 
Professional theater has come
to Stanford. Wednesday’s dress
rehearsal of the Stanford Play
ers’ production of Shakespeare’s
“Measure for Measure” made this
a certainty.
Dr. James Clancy, who directed
the play, deserves much of the

credit for the fine production. It
is a smooth and polished job.
Clancy’s editing of some of the
weaker lines and scenes strength
ened the entire production and
kept the two and one-half hour
play moving. His opening is effec
tive and helps explain some of the
Duke’s actions. Music is used very
well to fill in gaps when crowds
are moving and to open the ac
tion.
THE SET, designed by Richard
Hay, is excellent. Its versatility
is amazing. The set is used as a
prison, a monastery, a castle, and
a street scene and is convincing
as each. When only one basic set
is used in a play, it can become
boring: Hay’s does not.
The costumes, designed by
Douglas Russell, run into some
problems, most of them minor.
Several of them are distracting.
The design of the guards’ uni
forms looks like something out
of Flash Gordon, Russell is handi
capped by trying to simulate real
armor with plastic.
The use of plastics throughout,
as armor and leather, is a mis
take. The idea seems good, in
theory, but to the audience plas
tic on stage still looks like plas
tic.
EXCEPT FOB the guards’ cos
tumes, Russell’s designs are good.
Angelo's is exceptionally well
suited to the character. The idea
of making Isabella’s dress the
same color as the ecclesiastical
robes to emphasize her chastity
and goodness is also effective.
The cast for the production is
strong. Only a few times did any
one fumble the lines, and then
not seriously.
RICHKI) RISSO, who played
the deputy, Angelo, does the best
job. His characterization is con
vincing and the scene in which
Isabella first pleads with him for
her brother’s life is superb. Ris
so’s experience with Shakespeare,
gained at the Asland Shakespeare
Festival, is obvious in this pro
duction.
Bonda Lewis, playing Isabella,
also does an excellent job. The
portrayal of the chaste and pure
Isabella is difficult. The tempta
tion to overdo the part and turn
her into a prude is groat. Miss
Lewis resists it. Her characteriza
tion is realistic and sustained
throughout the play.
Herb Kennedy, as the Duke,
completes the cast of major char
acters. Kennedy also does a fine
job. His beginning seems a little
weak, as if he were unsure of
himself. But he gains confidence
and the character develops more
poise as the play progresses. His
part in the final scene is positive
ly flowing. In fact there may
have been too much duke in the
last scenes.
VICTOR Emeljanow, playing
Claudia’s friend Lucio, is able to
hold his own very well beside the
excellent performances given in
the major roles. Emeljanow’s in
terpretation of the character Lu
cio is good. His flippant attitude
during the scenes in which Clau
dio is taken off to jail and in
which Isabella is pleading with
Angelo for Claudio’s life keeps
the audience convinced that
Shakespeare really intended the
play to be a comedy, a fact which
is frequently left in doubt.
Michael Percival is the least
convincing of the major actors.
His characterization of Claudio
leaves something to be desired.
Granted, the character is the
weakest in the play, but still there
seems to be something missing in
Percival’s interpretation. The
scene in which Isabella visits
Claudio in jail is poor. Claudio’s
character doesn’t hold and the
situation seems flat and unreal.
A little more work was needed on
the part.
The play will run tonight and
tomorrow night in Memorial Au
ditorium. Curtain time both
nights is 8:30 p.m. and seats are
available for both nights.

The play will run tonight and
tomorrow night in Memorial Au
ditorium. Curtain time both
nights is 8:30 p.m. and seats are
available for both nights.
Professional theater has come
to Stanford. Wednesday’s dress
rehearsal of the Stanford Play
ers’ production of Shakespeare’s
“Measure for Measure” made this
a certainty.
Dr. James Clancy, who directed
the play, deserves much of the

credit for the fine production. It
is a smooth and polished job.
Clancy’s editing of some of the
weaker lines and scenes strength
ened the entire production and
kept the two and one-half hour
play moving. His opening is effec
tive and helps explain some of the
Duke’s actions. Music is used very
well to fill in gaps when crowds
are moving and to open the ac
tion.
THE SET, designed by Richard
Hay, is excellent. Its versatility
is amazing. The set is used as a
prison, a monastery, a castle, and
a street scene and is convincing
as each. When only one basic set
is used in a play, it can become
boring: Hay’s does not.
The costumes, designed by
Douglas Russell, run into some
problems, most of them minor.
Several of them are distracting.
The design of the guards’ uni
forms looks like something out
of Flash Gordon, Russell is handi
capped by trying to simulate real
armor with plastic.
The use of plastics throughout,
as armor and leather, is a mis
take. The idea seems good, in
theory, but to the audience plas
tic on stage still looks like plas
tic.
EXCEPT FOB the guards’ cos
tumes, Russell’s designs are good.
Angelo's is exceptionally well
suited to the character. The idea
of making Isabella’s dress the
same color as the ecclesiastical
robes to emphasize her chastity
and goodness is also effective.
The cast for the production is
strong. Only a few times did any
one fumble the lines, and then
not seriously.
RICHKI) RISSO, who played
the deputy, Angelo, does the best
job. His characterization is con
vincing and the scene in which
Isabella first pleads with him for
her brother’s life is superb. Ris
so’s experience with Shakespeare,
gained at the Asland Shakespeare
Festival, is obvious in this pro
duction.
Bonda Lewis, playing Isabella,
also does an excellent job. The
portrayal of the chaste and pure
Isabella is difficult. The tempta
tion to overdo the part and turn
her into a prude is groat. Miss
Lewis resists it. Her characteriza
tion is realistic and sustained
throughout the play.
Herb Kennedy, as the Duke,
completes the cast of major char
acters. Kennedy also does a fine
job. His beginning seems a little
weak, as if he were unsure of
himself. But he gains confidence
and the character develops more
poise as the play progresses. His
part in the final scene is positive
ly flowing. In fact there may
have been too much duke in the
last scenes.
VICTOR Emeljanow, playing
Claudia’s friend Lucio, is able to
hold his own very well beside the
excellent performances given in
the major roles. Emeljanow’s in
terpretation of the character Lu
cio is good. His flippant attitude
during the scenes in which Clau
dio is taken off to jail and in
which Isabella is pleading with
Angelo for Claudio’s life keeps
the audience convinced that
Shakespeare really intended the
play to be a comedy, a fact which
is frequently left in doubt.
Michael Percival is the least
convincing of the major actors.
His characterization of Claudio
leaves something to be desired.
Granted, the character is the
weakest in the play, but still there
seems to be something missing in
Percival’s interpretation. The
scene in which Isabella visits
Claudio in jail is poor. Claudio’s
character doesn’t hold and the
situation seems flat and unreal.
A little more work was needed on
the part.

Claudio in jail is poor. Claudio’s
character doesn’t hold and the
situation seems flat and unreal.
A little more work was needed on
the part.
The play will run tonight and
tomorrow night in Memorial Au
ditorium. Curtain time both
nights is 8:30 p.m. and seats are
available for both nights.
Professional theater has come
to Stanford. Wednesday’s dress
rehearsal of the Stanford Play
ers’ production of Shakespeare’s
“Measure for Measure” made this
a certainty.
Dr. James Clancy, who directed
the play, deserves much of the

credit for the fine production. It
is a smooth and polished job.
Clancy’s editing of some of the
weaker lines and scenes strength
ened the entire production and
kept the two and one-half hour
play moving. His opening is effec
tive and helps explain some of the
Duke’s actions. Music is used very
well to fill in gaps when crowds
are moving and to open the ac
tion.
THE SET, designed by Richard
Hay, is excellent. Its versatility
is amazing. The set is used as a
prison, a monastery, a castle, and
a street scene and is convincing
as each. When only one basic set
is used in a play, it can become
boring: Hay’s does not.
The costumes, designed by
Douglas Russell, run into some
problems, most of them minor.
Several of them are distracting.
The design of the guards’ uni
forms looks like something out
of Flash Gordon, Russell is handi
capped by trying to simulate real
armor with plastic.
The use of plastics throughout,
as armor and leather, is a mis
take. The idea seems good, in
theory, but to the audience plas
tic on stage still looks like plas
tic.
EXCEPT FOB the guards’ cos
tumes, Russell’s designs are good.
Angelo's is exceptionally well
suited to the character. The idea
of making Isabella’s dress the
same color as the ecclesiastical
robes to emphasize her chastity
and goodness is also effective.
The cast for the production is
strong. Only a few times did any
one fumble the lines, and then
not seriously.
RICHKI) RISSO, who played
the deputy, Angelo, does the best
job. His characterization is con
vincing and the scene in which
Isabella first pleads with him for
her brother’s life is superb. Ris
so’s experience with Shakespeare,
gained at the Asland Shakespeare
Festival, is obvious in this pro
duction.
Bonda Lewis, playing Isabella,
also does an excellent job. The
portrayal of the chaste and pure
Isabella is difficult. The tempta
tion to overdo the part and turn
her into a prude is groat. Miss
Lewis resists it. Her characteriza
tion is realistic and sustained
throughout the play.
Herb Kennedy, as the Duke,
completes the cast of major char
acters. Kennedy also does a fine
job. His beginning seems a little
weak, as if he were unsure of
himself. But he gains confidence
and the character develops more
poise as the play progresses. His
part in the final scene is positive
ly flowing. In fact there may
have been too much duke in the
last scenes.
VICTOR Emeljanow, playing
Claudia’s friend Lucio, is able to
hold his own very well beside the
excellent performances given in
the major roles. Emeljanow’s in
terpretation of the character Lu
cio is good. His flippant attitude
during the scenes in which Clau
dio is taken off to jail and in
which Isabella is pleading with
Angelo for Claudio’s life keeps
the audience convinced that
Shakespeare really intended the
play to be a comedy, a fact which
is frequently left in doubt.
Michael Percival is the least
convincing of the major actors.
His characterization of Claudio
leaves something to be desired.
Granted, the character is the
weakest in the play, but still there
seems to be something missing in
Percival’s interpretation. The
scene in which Isabella visits
Claudio in jail is poor. Claudio’s
character doesn’t hold and the
situation seems flat and unreal.
A little more work was needed on
the part.
The play will run tonight and
tomorrow night in Memorial Au
ditorium. Curtain time both
nights is 8:30 p.m. and seats are
available for both nights.
