# Final Appeal Fails; Eichmann Executed
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (UPl)—The state of Israel hanged Nazi butcher
Adolf Eichrnann shortly before midnight for the murder of six
million Jews in World War 11, it was officially announced today.
The thin-faced Eichrnann who carried out Adolf Hitler’s orders
to exterminate the Jews of Germany was pronounced dead at

11:58 p.m. (2:58 p.m. PDT). ■*
Eiohmann’s fate was sealed |
last night when President
Itzhak Benzvi rejected his final
appeal. The Israeli Supreme
Court had done the same earlier
in the week with the notation that
no punishment was great enough
to fit the enormity of his crime.
The execution was carried out
at Ramie Prison near Tel Aviv,
an ancient Crusader city jammed
with police who guarded all roads
into the city to see that nothing
went wrong with the execution
of the man described as Jewry's
greatest enemy.
PRISON OFFICIALS said his
body would be cremated and the
ashes scattered over the sea—an
ironic end to the man who once
boasted to his aide, Dieter von
Wisliceny: “I will jump into my
grave laughing, for to know that
I have six million people on my
conscience will be a source of ex
treme satisfaction.”
Eichmann died on the hang
man’s rope in a stuffy, small
room of the fortress-like prison,
angry to the last against the peo
ple he had once tracked down as
animals and whose execution he
had overseen in the gas chambers
of Nazi Germany.
HE HAD APPEALED to the
Supreme Court and to President
Ben-Zvi and was reported ready
to appeal to the United Nations
in a desperate bid to stay alive
but the wheels of justice ran too
fast once Ben-Zvi rejected his
plea.
The Rev. William Hull, a Cana
dian missionary and Eichmann’s
spiritual adviser, said Eichmann
was “very bitter about the appeal
verdict.” To the last the hawk
faced man of 56 had expected
mercy from the Jewish nation.
The Israeli state radio dramati
cally interrupted a program with
the announcement of Ben-Zvi’s de
cision and Eichmann began his
last minutes on earth.
AS MIDNIGHT approached po
lice moved in on Ramie Prison
and set up guard posts. But most
of the inhabitants of Israel were
already asleep and the execution
went as planned.

into the city to see that nothing
went wrong with the execution
of the man described as Jewry's
greatest enemy.
PRISON OFFICIALS said his
body would be cremated and the
ashes scattered over the sea—an
ironic end to the man who once
boasted to his aide, Dieter von
Wisliceny: “I will jump into my
grave laughing, for to know that
I have six million people on my
conscience will be a source of ex
treme satisfaction.”
Eichmann died on the hang
man’s rope in a stuffy, small
room of the fortress-like prison,
angry to the last against the peo
ple he had once tracked down as
animals and whose execution he
had overseen in the gas chambers
of Nazi Germany.
HE HAD APPEALED to the
Supreme Court and to President
Ben-Zvi and was reported ready
to appeal to the United Nations
in a desperate bid to stay alive
but the wheels of justice ran too
fast once Ben-Zvi rejected his
plea.
The Rev. William Hull, a Cana
dian missionary and Eichmann’s
spiritual adviser, said Eichmann
was “very bitter about the appeal
verdict.” To the last the hawk
faced man of 56 had expected
mercy from the Jewish nation.
The Israeli state radio dramati
cally interrupted a program with
the announcement of Ben-Zvi’s de
cision and Eichmann began his
last minutes on earth.
AS MIDNIGHT approached po
lice moved in on Ramie Prison
and set up guard posts. But most
of the inhabitants of Israel were
already asleep and the execution
went as planned.
JERUSALEM (UPl)—The state of Israel hanged Nazi butcher
Adolf Eichrnann shortly before midnight for the murder of six
million Jews in World War 11, it was officially announced today.
The thin-faced Eichrnann who carried out Adolf Hitler’s orders
to exterminate the Jews of Germany was pronounced dead at

11:58 p.m. (2:58 p.m. PDT). ■*
Eiohmann’s fate was sealed |
last night when President
Itzhak Benzvi rejected his final
appeal. The Israeli Supreme
Court had done the same earlier
in the week with the notation that
no punishment was great enough
to fit the enormity of his crime.
The execution was carried out
at Ramie Prison near Tel Aviv,
an ancient Crusader city jammed
with police who guarded all roads
into the city to see that nothing
went wrong with the execution
of the man described as Jewry's
greatest enemy.
