# LASSU OK's NSA Delegates
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
The student body approved the
University’s joining NSA in a
referendum Wednesday, 799 to
614 votes. Last night LASSU ap
proved the referendum results,
and voted to send up to six dele
gates to the national convention
in August in Ohio. The delegates
were granted $250 to partially
cover expenses. LASSU also dis
cussed speaker policy and the
HR.
Jim McCarthy presented the
case for sending six delegates—
the convention will operate in at
least four major bodies, all of
which Stanford ought to observe.
He said there was hope of Stan
ford’s being given a project of
organizing a national student un
ion in South Africa.
THE DELEGATES will be se
lected by ex-ASSU President Bob
Sayler and President Armin Ro
sencranz, and then approved by
LASSU members dropping into
the ASSU office.
Charlie Lofgren, believing that
he spoke for the students and
LASSU, said that the political
spectrum from Steinbruner to
Andruss should be sent, especial
ly as there is at present no index
of what student views are to
wards policy in LASSU.
The remainder of the funds for
the convention will come from the
administration and from an NSA
travel-rebate.
THERE WAS A long hassle
over the policies of getting
speakers, referring to some
groups irresponsibly promising to
pay speakers when the group had
no funds, then going to LASSU or
Public Exercises for help.
A strict limitation on promises
by groups, including personal fi
nancial responsibility by the per
son who made the offer, was de
feated. Instead a commission
composed of the HR, Poli Union
and Public Exercises officers, the
Student Financial Manager and
the Dean of Students, will meet
before autumn quarter and de
cide policy for bringing speakers.
Scotty Thompson pleaded for
the flexibility that will bring
many good speakers to the cam
pus. Jock Mcßaine seconded him,
saying that LASSU need only pro
tect its own powers. If the admin
istration wants to economize, it
should protect its own funds, he
said. “I think it is to be the stu
dents against the administration,
and Scotty Thompson has done a
fine job of getting it out of them,”
Mcßaine said.
Sayler closed the meeting with
thanks and an apology, “We blew
pretty hard, but damned if we got
anything done.”
