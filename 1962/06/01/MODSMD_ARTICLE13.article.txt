# Apathy: Students The Only Victims?
## 
### 
Historically speaking, spring quarter is a time of Issues.
In the spring of i960, tire campus was excited about the sit-ins,
Chessman and the UUAC. Last spring, controversy centered on
The Daily and the Chappie. But in spite of Issues there was not
much that could ho called action. The people who went to San
Quentin and the San Francisco City Hall were generally the same
ones, a core group of probably not more than 25 students. And al
though everyone talked about The Daily and the Chappie, no one
did anything about them.
One of the obvious reasons for this lack of activity is that there
was very little that students could do about these problems. Those
in i960 were too big for students to handle; those in 1961 were
virtually out of students’ hands. All they could do was protest.
This spring, however, the Issues have become issues—control
lable by students—and there has been nothing which couldn’t be
called action. And although the activity became overt this spring,
most of the issues have been in thinking and planning stages
throughout the year.
The new constitution was the result of a year of work, begin
ning in fall quarter, continuing through winter and culminating in
many long and arduous Legislature sessions.
Planning for the liquor change, LASSU’s housing and academic
studies and Forum all began during winter quarter.
And although these would have been enough for any student
body to handle in one quarter, Annin, Helsinki and NSA also ap
peared spontaneously.
The most curious thing about almost all of these issues is that
they were not initiated by a core group of 25 people. They were
started by students from every segment of the campus, from every
University division, from every kind of living group. Work on the
new constitution was begun by two groups independently. Forum
sprang from a long dormant group. A graduate student marched
into the middle of campus politics.
In each case, the entire campus became excited. The liquor
policy received overwhelming support and Armin was elected in
the largest voting turnout in Stanford’s history. On Wednesday,
Stanford voted to affiliate with NSA after having decisively reject
ed it only two years ago.
Over 400 students applied for the Helsinki project; Krino’s
first issue sold 500 copies.
Disappointment at the resignation of Deans Craig and Lowen
stein has been tremendously widespread.
Action in some cases has brought results. We will join NSA,
and Armin has been elected.
But the greater part of the agitation has been fruitless. The
administration has consistently set up obstacles for several student
groups. It has allowed Forum no freedom; coed housing in Stern
is impossible; the presophomore rush proposal has been shuffled
from committee to committee; the liquor policy has been “tabled.”
That the administration has needed time to consider these
problems, all of them of lasting importance, is understandable.
But it has been our impression—and the impression of a con
siderable segment of the campus—that the administration views
all of this activity as a ruckus caused by the leaders of the campus,
not as the effort of a considerable number of seriously concerned
students.
It seems to us that the administration is under the impression
that Professor James T. Watkins IV, Deans Winbigler and Allen,
and W. Scott Thompson represent student opinion. This may be
partially true, but student opinion comes from other quarters than
these, in the same way as it comes from people other than the
ASSU President, the president of the HR and the editor of The
Daily.
The resignation of Deans Craig and Lowenstein is a reflection
of this attitude of the administration. These two men see education
as more than academic. Next year they will not be here to con
sider student opinion, which becomes more vocal every day.
Perhaps the administration is out of touch with the students
of the University. We realize that administration work is time-con
suming, and that PACE is putting an additional strain on Uni
versity time. But it seems to us that the administration must recog
nize that it exists for the students of the present as well as for
those of the future. A straight answer, a statement of policy and
the philosophy which produced them would be welcome bits of
fresh air in weather that is now approaching summer.
