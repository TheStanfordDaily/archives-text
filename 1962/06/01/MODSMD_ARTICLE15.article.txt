## 'Ex-Communist Witnesses' 
### RICHARD WASSERSTROM Assistant Professor of Philosophy Law 
It is a commonplace to observe
that since the end of ihe Second
World War various organs of the
Federal, state and local govern
ments have been engaged in fre
quent, lengthy, and notorious in
quiries into the nature and dan
gers of internal Communist ac
tivity. And it is, I think, equally
obvious that many, even well-in
formed and conscientious, citizens
have felt these explorations to
have been both disturbing and in
conclusive. It is one of the great
merits" of Professor Packer’s
book “Ex-Communist Wit
nesses"—that we are now able to
see more clearly some of the
reasons why these inquiries have
been so unsatisfactory and un
satisfying. For, while one of the
most significant sources of infor
mation concerning internally sub
versive activity has been the tes
timony of self-confessed former
members of the Communist par
ty. few, if any, persons have ever
attempted to ask many of those
hard but necessary questions
which must be raised about these
people and their testimony. Pro
fessor Packer’s book must surely
be deemed the first successful en
deavor to ask and to answer, in
the best traditions of disinterest
ed scholarship, just such ques
tions.

Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth
Bentley. Louis Budenz and John
Lautner the four ex-Commu
nists whose testimony is exam
ined in the book—all appear on a
variety of occasions before a vari
ety of tribunals to testify about
Communist activity. If an intelli
gent appraisal is to be made of
their assertions, Professor Pack
er’s work instructs us that at
least six different questions must
be asked: tl) What was the na
ture of the particular tribunal
before which the testimony was
elicited? (2) What was the pre
cise question before (hat tri
bunal? (3) Was the testimony of
the witness before that tribunal
self-consistent? (4) Was the tes
timony of the witness before one
tribunal consistent with the testi
mony of that same witness before
some other tribunal? (5) Were
the accounts of different ex-Com
munist witnesses consistent with
or corroborative of, each other?
and (6) Were there significant
questions of fact which could
have been answered but which
for one reason or another were
not?

Professor Packer succeeds
amazingly well in both asking
and answering these and other
questions through a careful, sus
tained, and detailed examination
of what was originally more than
200,000 pages of recorded testi
mony. To be appreciated at all,
his work must be seen and read;
it cannot readily bo described.
But some very crude indication
of the range and focus of his an
alysis can, perhaps, be given
through the barest summary of
the contents of one chapter, that
which discusses Elizabeth Bent
ley. After a careful but brief
statement of her story of her life
in the Communist Party, there is
an examination of her testimony
before the House Un-American
Activities Committee. The vague
ness of the Committee’s inquiry,
the superficiality of much of its
questioning, and the lack of its
concern over the admission of
hearsay evidence is shown and
documented. Discrepancies, if
any, between testimony here and
at subsequent times are noted.
Considered, too, are ways in
which information in the posses
sion of the FBI might help to
clarify crucial issues.

The scene then shifts to a dif
ferent forum, the trials of Wil
liam Remington for perjury.
Here, as elsewhere, Professor
Packer delineates with care and
clarity what precisely was at is
sue in the perjury trial. He ex
plores in some detail Ihe nature
and effect of the cross-examina
tion of Miss Bentley, the degree to
which it was successful in re
vealing further discrepancies and
the extent to which it was not.
The grand jury proceeding and
the improprieties which sur
rounded Remington’s indictment
are examined. Then, corrobora
tion of Miss Bentley’s testimony
is sought in the testimony of
other witnesses, such as Cham
bers and Budenz. The relevance
of the taking of the Fifth Amend
ment by those named by Miss
Bentley is discussed with partic
ular acumen and persuasiveness.
Next comes the question of pos
sible external contradictions of
Miss Bentley and a delineation of
the weight which is plausibly to
be accorded to such evidence. And
finally, there is a reassessment of
the issues which remain unre
solved and a reexamination of
the reasons for their continued
existence.
This, then, is characteristic of
the structure of Professor Pack
er’s examination of the testimony
of each of the four ex-Commu
nists. And with the exception of
the first chapter (where, I think,
too much time is spent on an in
teresting but irrelevant issue
which surrounded the Hiss-Cham
bers controversy), the execution
of the analysis is a model of
thoughtful, informative, and lu
cid inquiry. There is throughout
an acute attentiveness to details
that do make a difference, a care
ful awareness of alternatives that
do merit independent considera
tion, and a balanced evaluation of
claims that do or do not persuade.
There is, in addition, another
level upon which the book can be
read. For a study of the testi

mony of these witnesses can, Pro-1
fessor Packer believes, teach us
much of general interest about
the ways and limitations of the
various fact-finding tribunals.
There are lessons, he rightly ob
serves, to be learned from watch- j
ing disparate forums in action j
and from considering the differ- I
ing inquiries they undertake. Anri
In the concluding chapter of the
book Professor Packer makes ex ■
plicit the content of these lessons.
Congressional investigat ions
have their obvious disadvantages;
yet, just because they are non
adversary, “open-ended” proceed
ings, they do provide a means by
which a whole, uninterrupted
story can be told. The court trial,
on the other hand, is well equip- j
ped, through possession of the j
techniques of adversary examina- I
tion, to test and probe the credi- |
bility of witnesses. But its focus !
is always narrow; it is a poor in
strument for the writing of co
herent, sustained history. These
and other conclusions, emerge in
the concluding chapter. If there is
one genera] criticism which can
be made of the book, it is simply
that this kind of general analysis
remains, at best, implicit until
the last chapter. And the book
would have been a better book, 1 j
think, had much more of this kind
of analysis been presented in the |
context of the discussion of each 1
of the four ex-Communists.
But to make the charge is per-1
haps only to reiterate the point
made above. The book must be i
read, for it teaches as much '
through ostensive demonstration
as it does through reasoned an
alysis, And when it is read and
read carefully there is a good
deal indeed that both the citizen
and the student of the law can 1
learn about our factual knowl
edge of Communist activity, the
institutional processes by which
it is acquired, and the reason
why, after so long, we can be
confident about comparativelv
little.
