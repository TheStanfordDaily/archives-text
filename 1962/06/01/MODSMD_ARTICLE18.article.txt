FOREIGN SCHOLAR
Editor, The Daily;
My year of study and living at
Stanford as an ASSU foreign
scholar has been very significant
for me. I am determined to keep
in touch with faculty members
and students whom I have known
at Stanford and to pass on to my
friends in Japan as many as pos
sible of the things I have learned.
I can never thank enough those
who have made this program
such a valuable experience for
me.

Perhaps the most memorable
part of my stay here has been the
opportunity I have had to sample
student opinion on various topics.
The vast numbers of unique opin
ions on campus would seem to de
rive from the American conpept
of freedom, and I have been in
terested in noticing how the stu
dents make use of this freedom.
Besides scholastic work, students
have opportunities to participate
in various campus activities. Not
only do students have so many
papers, assignments, and tests
that they do not have time to
think, but various groups on cam
pus also demand their participa
tion. Although in Japan we have
many activities such as these,
some of them are new to me. For
example there are overnights,
which attract hordes of students
and the twelve month open sea
son on dating. Through the hard
pursuit of these activities, Stan
ford students move toward be
coming well-rounded, socially ac
cepted types.
On the other hand, there are
some students who, shunning this
type of frivolity, turn their in
terest during their free time to
ward such serious activities as
the Foreign Policy Institute,
which drew hundreds of people
from the campus and neighboring
environs, and the U.N. Panel Dis
cussion led by AI Lowenstein,
which mustered about 15 interest
ed students. There are also a few
students who try to push their
political ideas through active par
ticipation: Ross Herman, who de
livered a pamphlet in opposition
to the Helsinki project; a group
of students favoring non-violent
alternatives to war, and those par
ticipants in the demonstrations
against HUAC.
In conclusion, I would like to
state the evaluation of American
freedom which I have made. The
pattern of freedom seems almost
complete. Students have the free
dom to participate in activities of
every color from' John Birch

green to socialist pink. They haw
the freedom to take part in every
thing or to avoid everything but
classes and assignments, the free
dom to worry about world prob
lems or to busy themselves with
a pursuit of the frivolous life.
There is only one more freedom
I could desire: can’t something
be done about all those term
papers ?

INDIFFERENT
Editor, The Daily:
The University has always ap
peared indifferent to student
needs and opinions. Its reactions
.when dealing with student pro
posals seem to have been—“lg
nore them. Don’t let them upset
PACE.” In the past year literally
thousands of students have signed
petitions supporting one propos
al or another. They have written
bitter protest against the Univer
sity’s indifference and inaction.
Finally the University quietly but
effectively gave its answer to all
student proposals.
The University gave its answer
in the none too mysterious resig
nations of Dean Lowenstein, Di
rector of Stern Hall, who took a
major part in the students’ drive
for an effective voice in student
affairs and University decisions,
and Dean Craig who dared to side
with the students on coed living
and liquor policy issues. In addi
tion we are no longer certain of
the return of John Balch, Assist
ant Director of Stern Houses, who
dared to actively support the stu
dent drive for coed living.
Wednesday’s Daily expressed
the tremendous respect Dean
Craig commands. This respect ap
pears to be very rare; although
students honor faculty members
as scholars, very few administra
tors command much respect. The
administration seems to bo filled
with men who govern their ac
tions solely by PACE, who do not
dare to take any controversial
stand and are insensate to student
needs and opinions. Now the ad
ministration seems to be striving
for a perverted sort of perfection,
a personification of itself. The
Balches, Dean Lowenstein and
Dean Craig are exceptions to
Stanford’s general image of an
administrator; they are courage
ous, energetic and deeply interest
ed in student problems; as such
they have won the respect and
admiration of the students. But
they did not personify the admin
istration so they are leaving us.
There must still be a few cour

ageous people in the administra
tion, hut one wonders how long
they can remain before they cow
er or an? disposed of.

RECENT AND SUDDEN
Editor, The Daily:
The recent and sudden Univer
sity announcements of the resig
nation of Dean of Men William G.
Craig came as a great shock and
disappointment to us. We are sor
ry to see Dean Craig leave Stan
ford, for with him goes a valu
able voice and ear for students’
interests and for a truly liberal
education. We wish William Craig
the best of success wherever ho
may bo and we know that our
stay at Stanford has been richer
because of him.
Also, of immediate concern to
us is the departure of Dean of
Stern Hall, A1 Lowenstein, and of
the Assistant Director John Balch
and his wife. Rusty. These three
people have added immeasurably
to life at Stern this past year,
Mr. Lowenstein has given us ex
cellent guidance and incentive to
help ourselves on issue of concern
both to ourselves and to the cam
pus. He has, from pre-reg week
on. helped to develop self-confi
dence in the leaders of Stern. He
has been an exceptional campus
leader, and we regret that such
a qualified man cannot remain at
Stanford.

The Balches, also, have shown
a spark and vitality which have
given the students a new sense of
interest in the politics and activi
ties of the University. We do not
feel that this enthusiasm is a dis
ease, although it is contagious.
Wo regret that the University
seeks to relegate this enthusiasm
to the outposts of campus life, to
keep the Balches and others like
them away from the students, to
suppress student interest and
opinion. For those men in Fre
mont, Larkin, Lassen and Holla
day. especially, John and Rusty
have made Stern more of a
“home” than we over dreamed
possible.
University representatives have
said that the move is “politics,”
and it appears that the Adminis
tration is afraid of a “laissez
faire” attitude; that the students
exist for the University and for
PACE (Procedure for Abolishing
Constructive Endeavors). We
urge that the University recon
sider their decision, that they
make clear and concise state
ments, that they lend an under
standing ear to student opinion.
We arc sorry to see the Balches
leave Stern Hall! ! !
