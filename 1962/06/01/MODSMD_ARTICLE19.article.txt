CONTROVERSY
Editor, The Daily:
With the upsurge of controver
sy concerning the undergraduate
method of choosing housing, I
would like to praise the present
system, whereby both the ‘draw’
and the ‘rush’ methods exist for
the sake of satisfying the great
est number of needs for the great
est number of students.

The newly raised inference
whereby discrimination alleged
ly involved in the rush system—
is morally wrong per se, seems
absurd since the broadened con
notations of the word ‘discrimi
nate’ are not even being taken
into consideration.’For, discrimi
nation, besides signifying preju
dice, also infers a rational use of
judgment to eliminate alterna
tive; thus allowing an individual
to arrive at an unbiased conclu
sion.

I do not purport that discrimi
nation, in the biased sense, does
not exist in the rush system. I do
not purport that this same dis
crimination does not exist in the
draw system. For, in both cases
discrimination does exist. Simply
because the draw system is
handled out of the sphere of stu
dents, the malevolent incidences
do not reach the ears of these
same students as easily as under
the rush system. But. this prob
lem is only a small one in the sys
tem of undergraduate housing,
not large enough yet, to necessi
tate the elimination of either of
these methods of choosing hous
ing.
Both systems are needed in or
der to satisfy the ideologies of-all
types of students: those students
W'ho believe that individuals
should not restrain another indi
vidual from joining them; and
for those students who believe
that a more placid existence can
be obtained from living with
other students who they know
they will have common interests
with and enjoy living around.
Yet, the present system realizes
that students are fallible in judg
ment; and that if a student has
made a wrong system, he can
easily change to the other meth
od of choosing. This is the im
portant aspect of our housing
system, not the other exaggerated
nonsense. There is no reason to
change merely for the sake of
change unless a system be seri
ously inflamed. Both systems of
housing have their merits; both
have their problems.

LOWENSTEIN
Editor, The Daily:
We know that we speak for the
several hundred students who
this year have taken courses in
African Politics and International
Law and for the countless others
who have been so beneficially
stimulated when we express our
sense of deep regret at the depar
ture of Dean Allard Lowenstein
from Stanford in June.
In both of these complicated

areas Dean Lowenstein has had
the very desirable combination of
a comprehensive understanding
of the subject matter, an ability
to effectively communicate it that
has seldom been equalled in our
experience at Stanford, a back
ground of practical experience in
these areas that make his courses
extremely meaningful, and the
desire and ability to share learn
ing experiences with all who
make themselves available no
matter how humble their creden
tials.

Although we do not understand
the peculiarities that have pre
vented the Political Science Dept,
from keeping him at Stanford,
we arc grateful that we have this
year had the opportunity to study
under Dean Lowenstein and sin
cerely hope that other Stanford
students in future years may
have the same privilege.
