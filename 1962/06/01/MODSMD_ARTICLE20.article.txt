# Tribe Successful Against Cal
## 
### 
Special to the Daily
Stanford has completed one of
its finest years since the end of
World War II in intercollegiate
competition against its arch rival,
the University of California. Dur
ing the 1961-62 school term, the
Stanford varsity teams defeated

California in seven intercollegiate
sports and broke even in two oth
ers.
The Indians defeated the Golden
Bears in football (20-7), basketball
(three straight times, including a
74-42 triumph, the largest margin
of victory ever for a Stanford
team in this series), track and
field (88 1-3 to 42 2-3), the largest
margin of victory ever for a Stan
ford team since 1933), golf (the
23rd and 24th victories in a row
over California), swimming (the
32nd and 33rd consecutive vic
tories over the Golden Bears), soc
cer and rugby (retaining the Big
Scrum Axt for the second straight
year). Series splits were made in
baseball and cross country.
THIS YEAR’S record matched
that of the 1955-56 school year as
the finest against California since

the fall of 1946.
Success during the past year,
though, wasn’t limited solely to
competition with California. The
Indian basketball team compiled
a 20-6 record for the finest mark
since 1942 when Stanford won the
N.C.A.A. Basketball title with a
27-4 season. The golf squad ran
its string of consecutive dual
match victories to 24 with 12 wins
this spring, and its home course
victory mark to 44 in a row. The
rugby squad went 12-0-1 against
American competition, losing only
to the touring New Zealand Uni
versities team.

For several Individuals, the year
was just as full of success. Tom
Dose, the 6-8 basketball center,
became the third sophomore in
Stanford history to score 400 or
more points in one season with
442 to join Ron Tomsic and Hank
Luisetti on that select list. John
Windsor, the 6-8 basketball for
ward, finished his Stanford career
with 877 points to place him tenth
on the list of all-time Stanford
scorers and was named to the
A.A.W.U. first team. Pete Choate
won the A.A.W.U. individual golf
title, a feat he also accomplished
in 1960.
DAVE WEILL broke and then
rcbroke the school discus record,
now holding it with a toss of 189-
11, only a few inches off the
National Collegiate record. Phil
White became the first pole vault
er in school history to clear 15
feet, doing it twice with vaults of
15-VL>. Art Batchelder became the
best of a long list of fine jave
lin throwers who have gone here
with a throw of 241-5%. Harry
McCalla set a new school two

mile record with a time of 8:52.7
against California in the Big Meet.
Warren Newell was named to the
All - CIBA baseball team and
George Honore received AII A.A.
W.U. first team football honors.

a 20-6 record for the finest mark
since 1942 when Stanford won the
N.C.A.A. Basketball title with a
27-4 season. The golf squad ran
its string of consecutive dual
match victories to 24 with 12 wins
this spring, and its home course
victory mark to 44 in a row. The
rugby squad went 12-0-1 against
American competition, losing only
to the touring New Zealand Uni
versities team.

For several Individuals, the year
was just as full of success. Tom
Dose, the 6-8 basketball center,
became the third sophomore in
Stanford history to score 400 or
more points in one season with
442 to join Ron Tomsic and Hank
Luisetti on that select list. John
Windsor, the 6-8 basketball for
ward, finished his Stanford career
with 877 points to place him tenth
on the list of all-time Stanford
scorers and was named to the
A.A.W.U. first team. Pete Choate
won the A.A.W.U. individual golf
title, a feat he also accomplished
in 1960.
DAVE WEILL broke and then
rcbroke the school discus record,
now holding it with a toss of 189-
11, only a few inches off the
National Collegiate record. Phil
White became the first pole vault
er in school history to clear 15
feet, doing it twice with vaults of
15-VL>. Art Batchelder became the
best of a long list of fine jave
lin throwers who have gone here
with a throw of 241-5%. Harry
McCalla set a new school two

mile record with a time of 8:52.7
against California in the Big Meet.
Warren Newell was named to the

George Honore received AII A.A.

Special to the Daily
Stanford has completed one of
its finest years since the end of
World War II in intercollegiate
competition against its arch rival,
the University of California. Dur
ing the 1961-62 school term, the
Stanford varsity teams defeated

California in seven intercollegiate
sports and broke even in two oth
ers.
The Indians defeated the Golden
Bears in football (20-7), basketball
(three straight times, including a
74-42 triumph, the largest margin
of victory ever for a Stanford
team in this series), track and
field (88 1-3 to 42 2-3), the largest
margin of victory ever for a Stan
ford team since 1933), golf (the
23rd and 24th victories in a row
over California), swimming (the
32nd and 33rd consecutive vic
tories over the Golden Bears), soc
cer and rugby (retaining the Big
Scrum Axt for the second straight
year). Series splits were made in
baseball and cross country.
THIS YEAR’S record matched
that of the 1955-56 school year as
the finest against California since

the fall of 1946.
Success during the past year,
though, wasn’t limited solely to
competition with California. The
Indian basketball team compiled
a 20-6 record for the finest mark
since 1942 when Stanford won the
N.C.A.A. Basketball title with a
