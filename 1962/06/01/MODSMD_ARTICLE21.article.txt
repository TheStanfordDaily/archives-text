### 
Sigma Chi won the intramural
baseball title in a walk by defeat
ing SRAC 14-3 Wednesday.
The big difference in the game
was the Chi power hitting. Doug
Clemetson hit two homers and
and drove in five runs, and Jim
Moe hit a three run blast.
CHI HAD A FEW breaks also,
as SRAC left fielder Bub Bowling
had things including wind and
gopher holes troubling him.
In the first inning, Clemetson
blasted what appeared to be a
single into left field, but it took
a bad hop and Clemetson had a
three run homer. Moe came up
later in the inning with two men
on, and drilled a liner to left field
that the wind carried over Bowl
ing’s head for another three run
homer, and that was all she wrote.
Clemetson’s second homer, com
ing in the fourth, made it 7-1. Chi
got four more runs in the fifth,
and three in the sixth.
SRAC got its first run in the
third on Bowling’s run-scoring
single, and added its final two
tallies in the seventh, one coming
when Keith Thomassen, who has
been known to run a fairly fast
440 (best of 46.1) scored from first
on a single and a slight outfield
bobble.
