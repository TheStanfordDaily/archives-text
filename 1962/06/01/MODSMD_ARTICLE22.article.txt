# Discus-Thrower Dave Weill Named 'Daily' Athlete of the Year
## 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
Dave Weill’s prodigious size is
matched only by the vast dis
tances he throws the discus.
Weill’s best platter spin of 18911
is good enough to win him the
nod by the Daily sports staff as
Stanford’s Athlete of the Year
for 1961-2.
No college discus thrower has
defeated Big Dave this year. In
fact, his best throw is only 10
inches behind the national col
legiate of 190-9 held by Glenn Pas
sey of Utah State, who reached
that mark in his fourth year of
varsity competition.
WEILL IS THE favorite to win
his specialty in the NCAA track
meet to be held at the University
of Oregon. The only one with an
outside shot to defeat him is Karl
Johnstone of Arizona State, who
consistently throws in the high
170’s, and has reached 180 on oc
casion.
Passey, who won (he event in
1961, is ineligible to compete in
the meet, as (his is his fourth year
of competition. Weill finished
third last year, thus earning All-
American track recognition.
The Stanford 1961 track season
ended with Weill consistently
abound 180-feet, but in Stanford’s
first dual meet in 1962, Weill
hurled the platter 188-6 C feet,
setting a personal best, eight feet
above his previous top mark.
IN THE PROCESS, he had
world record holder Jay Silvester
beaten ’til the last throw. Had
Weill won, it would have been
hailed ns one of the upsets of the
1962 track season.
As it was, Dave proved that long
throw was no fluke, capping the
dual meet season with a 189-11
against Cal in I he Big Meet. In
the Big Five tangle last Saturday,
Weill’s throw of 187-2 was good
enough to win by over 17 feet.
Weill still has the NCAA meet
this year, and if he places in the
top two in the AAU track meet
he will face the Russians at Stan
ford in July.
THE LATTER IS doubtful, as
Weill has the fifth best discus
throw in the United States this
year, ranking behind A1 Oerter,
Rink Babka, Silvester and Passey
in distance. However he has beat
en Passey in their only meeting
(his year, at Mt. San Antonio,
and is six feet away from the
second best thrower.
If you’re 6-7 and weigh 270
pounds, you don’t let something
like six feet stand between you
and competing against Russia.
Weill's closest rivals for Athlete
of (he Year were Harry McCalla
and Darrell Sutherland.
McCALLA, Weill’s teammate on
the track team, is perhaps the
second best all-around college dis
tance runner in the United States.
This is no disgrace when you con
sider that Dyrol Burleson has been
known to compete in a few track

meets every now and then.
McCalla has run the two-mile in
8:52.7, the mile in 4:06.7, and the
880 in 1:51.4 What would any
track coach give for a man who
is a virtual cinch to win any of
the three distance races he enters.
Sutherland is a two-sport man,
playing guard on Howie Dallmar’s
basketball team, and pitching for
Dutch Fehring’s baseballers.
THE HIGH POINT for Darrell
and the Stanford basketball team
this year was a 30-point perform
ance against AAWU - champs
UCLA. Stanford romped to a 51-
29 halftime lead with Sutherland
hitting everything he threw at the
basket from up to 30 feet.
Sutherland had a string of 20
consecutive scoreless innings
pitched. He shut out UCLA and

the Air Force, and beat USC 15-4
in the streak.
The Daily also selected the top
athletes in the various sports.
LINEBACKER .JOHN Butler
was selected as the top football
player. A hard-nosed player, But
ler was the main cog in a rugged
Card defense that allowed Card
opponents gains of next to noth
ing. He was among the team lead
ers in number of tackles.
End George Honore was the top
Stanford pass receiver, and did an
acceptable job on defense.
John Windson was named by
his mates as the most valuable
Stanford basketball player. He
was the top Card rebounder, a
clutch scorer, and a popular choice
on the All - AAWU basketball
squad. The Kansas City Steers

of the ABL made him their num
ber one draft choice.
TOM DOSE WAS t he top Tribe
scorer, and ended his sophomore
year on a high note by sinking
USC twice, once on a short hook
with seven seconds left in the
game, and the second time with
29 points before fouling out with
a few minutes to play.
In baseball, the honor went to
third sacker Rich Ferrazzano.
Rich led the club in runs batted
in, hits and runs scored. He
stroked the ball at a .300 plus clip
all year, and contributed outstand
ing defense on the difficult play.
Warren Newell was selected to
the All-CIBA outfield, and led the
team with a .333 average.
IN TRACK, Weill and McCalla
were tops, along with 15-foot pole

vaulter Phil White, and 240-foot
javelin thrower Art Batchelder.
In rugby, Stan Lindskog lopped
the list. He not only did the kick
ing, and thus most of the scoring,
but he also was a tough man to
contain once he got his hands on
the ball. John Thomas and Dick
Leeuwenberg were the outstand
ing forwards.
Pete Choate headed the golfers.
He won the AAWU title, as the
Cards were second its a team, and
finished second to John Lotz at
th e Pasatiempo Invitational.
Choate split with Lotz in dual
learn competition.
VOSHI MINIDISK! was the
leader of a hard-luck tennis team,
one that was among the best in
the country, hut had to face all of
the better ones constantly. Mine
gishi defeated rugged Larry Nag
if i' and Bill Hoogs both among the
U.S.
Defensive back Rusty Williams
captained the Stanford soccer
team. Despite crushing ineligibil
ities Stanford came on strong at
the season’s end to dump favored
Cal, and it was William’s defen
sive play that was largely respon
sible for that. Stanford’s high
scoring front line of Albeit Nnoli,
Larry Chukwudehe and Emanuel
Andah also earned the respect of
(he NCISC Coaches.
In water polo, it was virtually
impossible to select the top man,
but the Daily finally chose Pete
Pettigrew, the sophomore All-
AAWU choice. Goalie John Bates
was close behind.
BOXER El) ROTHMAN stood
far above other pugilists. He
capped a highly successful college
career by defeating Solomon John
son, light-heavyweight champion
of the Twelfth Naval District.
177-pounder Frank Redle was
die outstanding wrestler. Despite
serious injuries, Redle went to the
semi-finals of the area wrestling
championships.

The Daily broke a long tradition
in selecting Marty Hull as (he out
standing swimmer. Only a fresh
man, Hull finished fifth in the 100-
yard butterfly in the AAU meet.
Hull holds the national frosh rec
ord in that event.
THIS WAS ONE of the most

successful sports years in recent
Stanford history, with winning
seasons in most sports. However
the track team was more success
ful than most, and the Daily Ath
lete of the year award goes to the
leader of that team, captain Dave
Weill.

ful than most, and the Daily Ath
lete of the year award goes to the
leader of that team, captain Dave
Weill.

Dave Weill’s prodigious size is
matched only by the vast dis
tances he throws the discus.
Weill’s best platter spin of 18911
is good enough to win him the
nod by the Daily sports staff as
Stanford’s Athlete of the Year
for 1961-2.
No college discus thrower has
defeated Big Dave this year. In
fact, his best throw is only 10
inches behind the national col
legiate of 190-9 held by Glenn Pas
sey of Utah State, who reached
that mark in his fourth year of
varsity competition.
WEILL IS THE favorite to win
his specialty in the NCAA track
meet to be held at the University
of Oregon. The only one with an
outside shot to defeat him is Karl
Johnstone of Arizona State, who
consistently throws in the high
170’s, and has reached 180 on oc
casion.
Passey, who won (he event in
1961, is ineligible to compete in
the meet, as (his is his fourth year
of competition. Weill finished
third last year, thus earning All-
American track recognition.
The Stanford 1961 track season
ended with Weill consistently
abound 180-feet, but in Stanford’s
first dual meet in 1962, Weill
hurled the platter 188-6 C feet,
setting a personal best, eight feet
above his previous top mark.
IN THE PROCESS, he had
world record holder Jay Silvester
beaten ’til the last throw. Had
Weill won, it would have been
hailed ns one of the upsets of the
1962 track season.
As it was, Dave proved that long
throw was no fluke, capping the
dual meet season with a 189-11
against Cal in I he Big Meet. In
the Big Five tangle last Saturday,
Weill’s throw of 187-2 was good
enough to win by over 17 feet.
Weill still has the NCAA meet
this year, and if he places in the
top two in the AAU track meet
he will face the Russians at Stan
ford in July.
THE LATTER IS doubtful, as
Weill has the fifth best discus
throw in the United States this
year, ranking behind A1 Oerter,
Rink Babka, Silvester and Passey
in distance. However he has beat
en Passey in their only meeting
(his year, at Mt. San Antonio,
and is six feet away from the
second best thrower.
If you’re 6-7 and weigh 270
pounds, you don’t let something
like six feet stand between you
and competing against Russia.
Weill's closest rivals for Athlete
of (he Year were Harry McCalla
and Darrell Sutherland.
McCALLA, Weill’s teammate on
the track team, is perhaps the
second best all-around college dis
tance runner in the United States.
This is no disgrace when you con
sider that Dyrol Burleson has been
known to compete in a few track

meets every now and then.
McCalla has run the two-mile in
8:52.7, the mile in 4:06.7, and the
880 in 1:51.4 What would any
track coach give for a man who
is a virtual cinch to win any of
the three distance races he enters.
Sutherland is a two-sport man,
playing guard on Howie Dallmar’s
basketball team, and pitching for
Dutch Fehring’s baseballers.
THE HIGH POINT for Darrell
and the Stanford basketball team
this year was a 30-point perform
ance against AAWU - champs
UCLA. Stanford romped to a 51-
29 halftime lead with Sutherland
hitting everything he threw at the
basket from up to 30 feet.
Sutherland had a string of 20
consecutive scoreless innings
pitched. He shut out UCLA and

the Air Force, and beat USC 15-4
in the streak.
The Daily also selected the top
athletes in the various sports.
LINEBACKER .JOHN Butler
was selected as the top football
player. A hard-nosed player, But
ler was the main cog in a rugged
Card defense that allowed Card
opponents gains of next to noth
ing. He was among the team lead
ers in number of tackles.
End George Honore was the top
Stanford pass receiver, and did an
acceptable job on defense.
John Windson was named by
his mates as the most valuable
Stanford basketball player. He
was the top Card rebounder, a
clutch scorer, and a popular choice
on the All - AAWU basketball
squad. The Kansas City Steers

of the ABL made him their num
ber one draft choice.
TOM DOSE WAS t he top Tribe
scorer, and ended his sophomore
year on a high note by sinking
USC twice, once on a short hook
with seven seconds left in the
game, and the second time with
29 points before fouling out with
a few minutes to play.
In baseball, the honor went to
third sacker Rich Ferrazzano.
Rich led the club in runs batted
in, hits and runs scored. He
stroked the ball at a .300 plus clip
all year, and contributed outstand
ing defense on the difficult play.
Warren Newell was selected to
the All-CIBA outfield, and led the
team with a .333 average.
IN TRACK, Weill and McCalla
were tops, along with 15-foot pole

vaulter Phil White, and 240-foot
javelin thrower Art Batchelder.
In rugby, Stan Lindskog lopped
the list. He not only did the kick
ing, and thus most of the scoring,
but he also was a tough man to
contain once he got his hands on
the ball. John Thomas and Dick
Leeuwenberg were the outstand
ing forwards.
Pete Choate headed the golfers.
He won the AAWU title, as the
Cards were second its a team, and
finished second to John Lotz at
th e Pasatiempo Invitational.
Choate split with Lotz in dual
learn competition.
VOSHI MINIDISK! was the
leader of a hard-luck tennis team,
one that was among the best in
the country, hut had to face all of
the better ones constantly. Mine
gishi defeated rugged Larry Nag
if i' and Bill Hoogs both among the
U.S.
Defensive back Rusty Williams
captained the Stanford soccer
team. Despite crushing ineligibil
ities Stanford came on strong at
the season’s end to dump favored
Cal, and it was William’s defen
sive play that was largely respon
sible for that. Stanford’s high
scoring front line of Albeit Nnoli,
Larry Chukwudehe and Emanuel
Andah also earned the respect of
(he NCISC Coaches.
In water polo, it was virtually
impossible to select the top man,
but the Daily finally chose Pete
Pettigrew, the sophomore All-
AAWU choice. Goalie John Bates
was close behind.
BOXER El) ROTHMAN stood
far above other pugilists. He
capped a highly successful college
career by defeating Solomon John
son, light-heavyweight champion
of the Twelfth Naval District.
177-pounder Frank Redle was
die outstanding wrestler. Despite
serious injuries, Redle went to the
semi-finals of the area wrestling
championships.

The Daily broke a long tradition
in selecting Marty Hull as (he out
standing swimmer. Only a fresh
man, Hull finished fifth in the 100-
yard butterfly in the AAU meet.
Hull holds the national frosh rec
ord in that event.
THIS WAS ONE of the most

successful sports years in recent

seasons in most sports. However
the track team was more success
ful than most, and the Daily Ath
lete of the year award goes to the
leader of that team, captain Dave
Weill.

Dave Weill’s prodigious size is
matched only by the vast dis
tances he throws the discus.
Weill’s best platter spin of 18911
is good enough to win him the
nod by the Daily sports staff as
Stanford’s Athlete of the Year
for 1961-2.
No college discus thrower has
defeated Big Dave this year. In
fact, his best throw is only 10
inches behind the national col
legiate of 190-9 held by Glenn Pas
sey of Utah State, who reached
that mark in his fourth year of
varsity competition.
WEILL IS THE favorite to win
his specialty in the NCAA track
meet to be held at the University
of Oregon. The only one with an
outside shot to defeat him is Karl
Johnstone of Arizona State, who
consistently throws in the high
170’s, and has reached 180 on oc
casion.
Passey, who won (he event in
1961, is ineligible to compete in
the meet, as (his is his fourth year
of competition. Weill finished
third last year, thus earning All-
American track recognition.
The Stanford 1961 track season
ended with Weill consistently
abound 180-feet, but in Stanford’s
first dual meet in 1962, Weill
hurled the platter 188-6 C feet,
setting a personal best, eight feet
above his previous top mark.
IN THE PROCESS, he had
world record holder Jay Silvester
beaten ’til the last throw. Had
Weill won, it would have been
hailed ns one of the upsets of the
1962 track season.
As it was, Dave proved that long
throw was no fluke, capping the
dual meet season with a 189-11
against Cal in I he Big Meet. In
the Big Five tangle last Saturday,
Weill’s throw of 187-2 was good
enough to win by over 17 feet.
Weill still has the NCAA meet
this year, and if he places in the
top two in the AAU track meet
he will face the Russians at Stan
ford in July.
THE LATTER IS doubtful, as
Weill has the fifth best discus
throw in the United States this
year, ranking behind A1 Oerter,
Rink Babka, Silvester and Passey
in distance. However he has beat
en Passey in their only meeting
(his year, at Mt. San Antonio,
and is six feet away from the
second best thrower.
If you’re 6-7 and weigh 270
pounds, you don’t let something
like six feet stand between you
and competing against Russia.
Weill's closest rivals for Athlete
of (he Year were Harry McCalla
and Darrell Sutherland.
McCALLA, Weill’s teammate on
the track team, is perhaps the
second best all-around college dis
tance runner in the United States.
This is no disgrace when you con
sider that Dyrol Burleson has been
known to compete in a few track

meets every now and then.
McCalla has run the two-mile in
8:52.7, the mile in 4:06.7, and the
880 in 1:51.4 What would any
track coach give for a man who
is a virtual cinch to win any of
the three distance races he enters.
Sutherland is a two-sport man,
playing guard on Howie Dallmar’s
basketball team, and pitching for
Dutch Fehring’s baseballers.
THE HIGH POINT for Darrell
and the Stanford basketball team
this year was a 30-point perform
ance against AAWU - champs
UCLA. Stanford romped to a 51-
29 halftime lead with Sutherland
hitting everything he threw at the
basket from up to 30 feet.
Sutherland had a string of 20
consecutive scoreless innings
pitched. He shut out UCLA and

the Air Force, and beat USC 15-4
in the streak.
The Daily also selected the top
athletes in the various sports.
LINEBACKER .JOHN Butler
was selected as the top football
player. A hard-nosed player, But
ler was the main cog in a rugged
Card defense that allowed Card
opponents gains of next to noth
ing. He was among the team lead
ers in number of tackles.
End George Honore was the top
Stanford pass receiver, and did an
acceptable job on defense.
John Windson was named by
his mates as the most valuable
Stanford basketball player. He
was the top Card rebounder, a
clutch scorer, and a popular choice
on the All - AAWU basketball
squad. The Kansas City Steers

of the ABL made him their num
ber one draft choice.
TOM DOSE WAS t he top Tribe
scorer, and ended his sophomore
year on a high note by sinking
USC twice, once on a short hook
with seven seconds left in the
game, and the second time with
29 points before fouling out with
a few minutes to play.
In baseball, the honor went to
third sacker Rich Ferrazzano.
Rich led the club in runs batted
in, hits and runs scored. He
stroked the ball at a .300 plus clip
all year, and contributed outstand
ing defense on the difficult play.
Warren Newell was selected to
the All-CIBA outfield, and led the
team with a .333 average.
IN TRACK, Weill and McCalla
were tops, along with 15-foot pole

vaulter Phil White, and 240-foot
javelin thrower Art Batchelder.
In rugby, Stan Lindskog lopped
the list. He not only did the kick
ing, and thus most of the scoring,
but he also was a tough man to
contain once he got his hands on
the ball. John Thomas and Dick
Leeuwenberg were the outstand
ing forwards.
Pete Choate headed the golfers.
He won the AAWU title, as the
Cards were second its a team, and
finished second to John Lotz at
th e Pasatiempo Invitational.
Choate split with Lotz in dual
learn competition.
VOSHI MINIDISK! was the
leader of a hard-luck tennis team,
one that was among the best in
the country, hut had to face all of
the better ones constantly. Mine
gishi defeated rugged Larry Nag
if i' and Bill Hoogs both among the
U.S.
Defensive back Rusty Williams
captained the Stanford soccer
team. Despite crushing ineligibil
ities Stanford came on strong at
the season’s end to dump favored
Cal, and it was William’s defen
sive play that was largely respon
sible for that. Stanford’s high
scoring front line of Albeit Nnoli,
Larry Chukwudehe and Emanuel
Andah also earned the respect of
(he NCISC Coaches.
In water polo, it was virtually
impossible to select the top man,
but the Daily finally chose Pete
Pettigrew, the sophomore All-
AAWU choice. Goalie John Bates
was close behind.
BOXER El) ROTHMAN stood
far above other pugilists. He
capped a highly successful college
career by defeating Solomon John
son, light-heavyweight champion
of the Twelfth Naval District.
177-pounder Frank Redle was
die outstanding wrestler. Despite
serious injuries, Redle went to the
semi-finals of the area wrestling
championships.

The Daily broke a long tradition
in selecting Marty Hull as (he out
standing swimmer. Only a fresh
man, Hull finished fifth in the 100-
yard butterfly in the AAU meet.
Hull holds the national frosh rec
ord in that event.

successful sports years in recent
Stanford history, with winning
seasons in most sports. However
the track team was more success
ful than most, and the Daily Ath
lete of the year award goes to the
leader of that team, captain Dave
Weill.

Dave Weill’s prodigious size is
matched only by the vast dis
tances he throws the discus.
Weill’s best platter spin of 18911
is good enough to win him the
nod by the Daily sports staff as
Stanford’s Athlete of the Year
for 1961-2.
No college discus thrower has
defeated Big Dave this year. In
fact, his best throw is only 10
inches behind the national col
legiate of 190-9 held by Glenn Pas
sey of Utah State, who reached
that mark in his fourth year of
varsity competition.
WEILL IS THE favorite to win
his specialty in the NCAA track
meet to be held at the University
of Oregon. The only one with an
outside shot to defeat him is Karl
Johnstone of Arizona State, who
consistently throws in the high
170’s, and has reached 180 on oc
casion.
Passey, who won (he event in
1961, is ineligible to compete in
the meet, as (his is his fourth year
of competition. Weill finished
third last year, thus earning All-
American track recognition.
The Stanford 1961 track season
ended with Weill consistently
abound 180-feet, but in Stanford’s
first dual meet in 1962, Weill
hurled the platter 188-6 C feet,
setting a personal best, eight feet
above his previous top mark.
IN THE PROCESS, he had
world record holder Jay Silvester
beaten ’til the last throw. Had
Weill won, it would have been
hailed ns one of the upsets of the
1962 track season.
As it was, Dave proved that long
throw was no fluke, capping the
dual meet season with a 189-11
against Cal in I he Big Meet. In
the Big Five tangle last Saturday,
Weill’s throw of 187-2 was good
enough to win by over 17 feet.
Weill still has the NCAA meet
this year, and if he places in the
top two in the AAU track meet
he will face the Russians at Stan
ford in July.
THE LATTER IS doubtful, as
Weill has the fifth best discus
throw in the United States this
year, ranking behind A1 Oerter,
Rink Babka, Silvester and Passey
in distance. However he has beat
en Passey in their only meeting
(his year, at Mt. San Antonio,
and is six feet away from the
second best thrower.
If you’re 6-7 and weigh 270
pounds, you don’t let something
like six feet stand between you
and competing against Russia.
Weill's closest rivals for Athlete
of (he Year were Harry McCalla
and Darrell Sutherland.
McCALLA, Weill’s teammate on
the track team, is perhaps the
second best all-around college dis
tance runner in the United States.
This is no disgrace when you con
sider that Dyrol Burleson has been
known to compete in a few track

meets every now and then.
McCalla has run the two-mile in
8:52.7, the mile in 4:06.7, and the
880 in 1:51.4 What would any
track coach give for a man who
is a virtual cinch to win any of
the three distance races he enters.
Sutherland is a two-sport man,
playing guard on Howie Dallmar’s
basketball team, and pitching for
Dutch Fehring’s baseballers.
THE HIGH POINT for Darrell
and the Stanford basketball team
this year was a 30-point perform
ance against AAWU - champs
UCLA. Stanford romped to a 51-
29 halftime lead with Sutherland
hitting everything he threw at the
basket from up to 30 feet.
Sutherland had a string of 20
consecutive scoreless innings
pitched. He shut out UCLA and

the Air Force, and beat USC 15-4
in the streak.
The Daily also selected the top
athletes in the various sports.
LINEBACKER .JOHN Butler
was selected as the top football
player. A hard-nosed player, But
ler was the main cog in a rugged
Card defense that allowed Card
opponents gains of next to noth
ing. He was among the team lead
ers in number of tackles.
End George Honore was the top
Stanford pass receiver, and did an
acceptable job on defense.
John Windson was named by
his mates as the most valuable
Stanford basketball player. He
was the top Card rebounder, a
clutch scorer, and a popular choice
on the All - AAWU basketball
squad. The Kansas City Steers

of the ABL made him their num
ber one draft choice.
TOM DOSE WAS t he top Tribe
scorer, and ended his sophomore
year on a high note by sinking
USC twice, once on a short hook
with seven seconds left in the
game, and the second time with
29 points before fouling out with
a few minutes to play.
In baseball, the honor went to
third sacker Rich Ferrazzano.
Rich led the club in runs batted
in, hits and runs scored. He
stroked the ball at a .300 plus clip
all year, and contributed outstand
ing defense on the difficult play.
Warren Newell was selected to
the All-CIBA outfield, and led the
team with a .333 average.
IN TRACK, Weill and McCalla
were tops, along with 15-foot pole

vaulter Phil White, and 240-foot
javelin thrower Art Batchelder.
In rugby, Stan Lindskog lopped
the list. He not only did the kick
ing, and thus most of the scoring,
but he also was a tough man to
contain once he got his hands on
the ball. John Thomas and Dick
Leeuwenberg were the outstand
ing forwards.
Pete Choate headed the golfers.
He won the AAWU title, as the
Cards were second its a team, and
finished second to John Lotz at
th e Pasatiempo Invitational.
Choate split with Lotz in dual
learn competition.
VOSHI MINIDISK! was the
leader of a hard-luck tennis team,
one that was among the best in
the country, hut had to face all of
the better ones constantly. Mine
gishi defeated rugged Larry Nag
if i' and Bill Hoogs both among the
U.S.
Defensive back Rusty Williams
captained the Stanford soccer
team. Despite crushing ineligibil
ities Stanford came on strong at
the season’s end to dump favored
Cal, and it was William’s defen
sive play that was largely respon
sible for that. Stanford’s high
scoring front line of Albeit Nnoli,
Larry Chukwudehe and Emanuel
Andah also earned the respect of
(he NCISC Coaches.
In water polo, it was virtually
impossible to select the top man,
but the Daily finally chose Pete
Pettigrew, the sophomore All-
AAWU choice. Goalie John Bates
was close behind.
BOXER El) ROTHMAN stood
far above other pugilists. He
capped a highly successful college
career by defeating Solomon John
son, light-heavyweight champion
of the Twelfth Naval District.
177-pounder Frank Redle was
die outstanding wrestler. Despite
serious injuries, Redle went to the
semi-finals of the area wrestling
championships.

The Daily broke a long tradition
in selecting Marty Hull as (he out
standing swimmer. Only a fresh
man, Hull finished fifth in the 100-
yard butterfly in the AAU meet.
Hull holds the national frosh rec
ord in that event.
