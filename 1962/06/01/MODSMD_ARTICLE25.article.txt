INDIANAPOLIS HJPD— Rodg
er Ward, only the sixth driver to
win the 500-mile auto race twice,
last night became the Speedway’s
all-time money winning champion.
WARD AND his crew, from the
Bob Wilke racing team of Mil

$125,000 from a total purse of
around $425,000 at the annual vic
tory banquet.
Ward, also winner in 1959, won
Wednesday’s holiday classic at a
record clip of 140,293 miles per
hour the first time the winner
averaged better than 140 m.p.h.
Final official statistics released
by the U.S. Auto Club showed
there were five leaders during the
200-lap chase and that Ward and
Jones each led twice before the
41 -year-old victor had it for keeps.
The other leaders were Foyt
and Roger McCluskey, who both
spun out, and Len Sutton, Ward’s
teammate who finished second.
FINAL statistics also showed
that Jones, the leader most of the
race who had to settle for seventh
place because his brakes went out
set a record for the fastest lap
ever run during the race.
The California comet who
shared rookie of the year honors
at the Speedway last year was
clocked at 148.295 m.p.h. on his
56th lap. The old mark of 147.489
was set by Troy Ruttman last
year on his 91st lap.
