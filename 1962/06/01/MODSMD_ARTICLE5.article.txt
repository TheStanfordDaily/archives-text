# Rosencranz Appoints Presidential Assistants
## 
### 
John Butler, John McCarthy,
and Jim Woolsey have been ap
pointed ASSU presidential assist
ants to aid ASSU President Ar
min Rosencrantz next year.
McCarthy, a sophomore chemis
try major from Pacifica will
serve as administrative assistant.
His primary responsibilities will
lie in implementing policy as spe
cified by Rosencrantz. In doing
so, he will deal directly with Leg
islature and the various student
committees responsible to it, in
particular, those concerned with
academic affairs, foreign student
integration, and legislative re
form.
McCarthy FEELS that a big
ger LASSU is necessary in order
to represent student opinion ac
curately. As Legislature is now,
he explained, the constituencies
of (ho representatives are so largo
that they cannot be represented
adequately or fairly by the mem
bers of Legislature. The larger

Legislature may appear unwieldy,
he stated, but it will provide bet
ter communication between
LASSU and the student body. He
went on lo say that since NSA has
been accepted, improvement in
communication between Legisla
ture and students will be essen
tial, because the LASSU repre
sentatives will be compelled to
speak for students in regard to
issues of national and world wide
significance.
McCarthy stressed the fact that
the most important purpose of
student government is to express
student opinion.
WOOLSEY AND Butler will act
as executive assistants to the
president.
Butler, a freshman from Grosse
Pointe, Mich., is a graduate of
Andover, where he was president
of his graduating class and win
ner of the highest student award
given by Andover. His chief areas
of activity will constitute liaison
work between LASSU and Stern,
Wilbur, and NSA.
WOOLSEY IS a junior history
major from Tulsa, Okla., and was
one of the principal drafters of
the new constitution which was
proposed earlier this year, and as
a senior will be a Wilbur spon
sor. He has also served as Presi
dent of the German Club and has
done work with the overseas cam
puses. In addition, he has been ac
tive in student debate since com
ing to Stanford. As executive as
sistant, his major area of respon
sibility will be his work as a con
tact between LASSU and the of
fices of the deans and Dr. Ster
ling. He feels that more effective
communication is necessary be
tween the deans, the University
president, and the student legis
lature.

ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS to Armin Rosencranz, John Butler,
John McCarthy, and Jim Woolsey, pose for The Daily as they ap
proach assumption of their status as guardians of the 14 points.
John Butler, John McCarthy,
and Jim Woolsey have been ap
pointed ASSU presidential assist
ants to aid ASSU President Ar
min Rosencrantz next year.
McCarthy, a sophomore chemis
try major from Pacifica will
serve as administrative assistant.
His primary responsibilities will
lie in implementing policy as spe
cified by Rosencrantz. In doing
so, he will deal directly with Leg
islature and the various student
committees responsible to it, in
particular, those concerned with
academic affairs, foreign student
integration, and legislative re
form.
McCarthy FEELS that a big
ger LASSU is necessary in order
to represent student opinion ac
curately. As Legislature is now,
he explained, the constituencies
of (ho representatives are so largo
that they cannot be represented
adequately or fairly by the mem
bers of Legislature. The larger

Legislature may appear unwieldy,
he stated, but it will provide bet
ter communication between
LASSU and the student body. He
went on lo say that since NSA has
been accepted, improvement in
communication between Legisla
ture and students will be essen
tial, because the LASSU repre
sentatives will be compelled to
speak for students in regard to
issues of national and world wide
significance.
McCarthy stressed the fact that
the most important purpose of
student government is to express
student opinion.
WOOLSEY AND Butler will act
as executive assistants to the
president.
Butler, a freshman from Grosse
Pointe, Mich., is a graduate of
Andover, where he was president
of his graduating class and win
ner of the highest student award
given by Andover. His chief areas
of activity will constitute liaison
work between LASSU and Stern,
Wilbur, and NSA.
WOOLSEY IS a junior history
major from Tulsa, Okla., and was
one of the principal drafters of
the new constitution which was
proposed earlier this year, and as
a senior will be a Wilbur spon
sor. He has also served as Presi
dent of the German Club and has
done work with the overseas cam
puses. In addition, he has been ac
