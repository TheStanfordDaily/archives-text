# 'UNUSUAL AND PLEASING'
## Sequoia Displays 'Positive Tone' 
### JULIE BEARD GERBODE 
The Spring issue of Sequoia contains well
written material, which is not unusual. What is
unusual and pleasing about it is its positive tone,
which demonstrates that good writing is not syn
onymous with perversion and gloom. It is also en
couraging that the authors are all of, or at,
Stanford.
WALLAC E STEGNEK'S lead article, “To an
Anonymous Admirer,” exhibits his polished prose
and controlled thought in an intelligent argument
for a rare kind of teaching. In discussing the
teaching of creative writing, he defines the role of
(he teacher whoso attempt to strike a balance and
a tension between the students’ uncritical accept
ance of his critical standards and student anarchy
is an attempt to make them write responsibly, to
communicate.
Joel Meister’s review of Nixon’s recent book,
“Six Crises in Search of a Defender,” should be
read and compared with Nixon’s work (available
in recent issues of LIFEi by everyone w'ho plans
to vote in the California primaries. Meister calls
attention to weakness in Nixon’s position revealed
by his description of his reactions to the greatest
crises, in his opinion, of his career.
IT IS A neat trick to write a funny story about
the Depression in Arkansas, flaring-up of

racial prejudice, the formation of a moh and a
threatened lynching, but Peter Peterson brings it
off with few difficulties in “Snowball’s Chance.”
His sense of timing and his ability to use dialect
and to reveal personalities in characters’ actions
ate also noteworthy.
The other two stories, Marguerite Byron’s “The
Anchorite” and “The Fast” by Georgiana Howe,
deal with two very different female anchorites,
both of whom triumph over (heir respective tor
ments. “The Fast” shows fine control of pace and
dialogue; “The Anchorite” describe inner and outer
landscapes with slightly overmuch detail. Both
stories are well-plolted and controlled.
THE POETRY ranges from Barbara Solomon’s
cerebral “Within the Indeterminate Universe” to
Sol Biderman's semi-romantic “What Shall I Do in
Summer?” byway of a whimsical poem by Rich
ard Russom, translations from the German of
Rilke by Mary Ann Bridley and the Swedish of
Strindberg by David Gardner, and selections from
"Mr. Biderman’s Madhouse.” Coherence is a wel
come feature of all of the poems.
The Editor’s Note is thought-provoking and less
parochial than those of some past issues. The cover
by Jim Bischoff and photo feature by Dan Solo
mon were not available for review. Sequoia goes
on sale on Monday. It is worth buying.

“Six Crises in Search of a Defender,” should be
read and compared with Nixon’s work (available
in recent issues of LIFEi by everyone w'ho plans

attention to weakness in Nixon’s position revealed
by his description of his reactions to the greatest
crises, in his opinion, of his career.
IT IS A neat trick to write a funny story about
the Depression in Arkansas, flaring-up of

racial prejudice, the formation of a moh and a
threatened lynching, but Peter Peterson brings it
off with few difficulties in “Snowball’s Chance.”
