## I-Center Studies to Be Here 
### 
Educators from more than
twenty countries will be wel

Center for the Advancement of
Management Education.
A pioneering venture in Ameri
can higher education, ICAME is

professors of business administra
tion from Asia, Africa, Latin
America and the Middle East.
IT IS A unique effort to
strengthen teaching and research
projects in the field of business

the process of economic develop

The initial ICAME group in
cludes 38 professors of finance or
accounting from 32 countries who
will participate in an intensive
academic program of study and
research in financial management
lasting until the end of May, 1963.
These men and the institutions
from which they come were care
fully selected on the basis of per
sonal visits by the Business
School Dean Ernest Arbuckle, the
Director of the Center, Dr. E.
Solomon, and Associate Director
Leonard Marks Jr.
FINANCED BY a grant from
the Ford Foundation to the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness, ICAME is new from the
ground up. Its staff, library and
curriculum materials have been
assembled and the building con

nounced in January 1960.
The Center’s teaching staff is
drawn from universities through
out the country and its research
staff this year includes two In
dians, a Swiss, an Israeli, and an
Australian.
THE CENTER WILL be the
first in the country to gear in

cific needs of business manage
ment education in the newly
emergent nations.
In addition to intensive class
room and library study at the new
Center on the Stanford campus,
the visiting faculty partcipants
will spend two and a half months
undertaking field study of man
agement problems in American
financial institutions, companies,
research organizations and gov
ernment departments.
