“Stanford Mosaic” a collection

The book was edited by the late
Miss Edith Mlrrielees, emeritus
professor of English at Stanford.
Miss Mirrielees, 83, collapsed
June 3 in her campus home, and
died soon after in the Palo Alto-
Stanford Hospital.
MISS MIBBIELEES received
her bachelor’s degree at Stan
ford in 1907 and joined the fac
ulty as an instructor in August
1910. She was a Stanford profes
sor for 35 years, retiring in 1944.
Active on campus for 52 years
Miss Mirrielees was also known
for her articles and short stories
in such publications as the At
lantic Monthly, Scribners, and
the Saturday Review.
She served on the faculty of
the Breadloaf School and Writers
Conference in Vermont, and for
more than 25 years was a volun
teer adviser to the U.S. Depart
ment of Indian Affairs on Indian
Education. From 1947 to 1951
she founded and served as man
aging editor of the Pacific Spec
tator, a literary quarterly pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press.
Miss Mirrielees was a contem
porary of Author Bruce Bliven,
and had as students writers
Frank J. Taylor, Archie Binns,
John Steinbeck and Howard
Pease.
IN ADDITION to the “Stan
ford Mosaic” Miss Mirrielees
edited two anthologies and wrote
two other books on writing tech
niques.
Her major work was “Stanford,
The Story of a University,” which
was published in 1959, and is still
available in the Stanford Book
store.
She was a member of the edi
torial advisory committee for
"Stanford Today,” alumni quar
terly, and a member of the Alum
ni Association’s "Know Your
Stanford” Committee, formed to
preserve Stanford traditions and
history.
PBOFESSOB Wallace Stegner,
director of Stanford’s Creative
Writing Center, said: “The world
will certainly be poorer for her
passing. She was one of the great
ladies beloved by all of us who
were privileged to know and

work with her, as her devoted
following of former students will
testify.
“A shorty story writer herself,
she made her own appraisal of
her abilities midway in her life
and set out to become one of the
best teachers of writing in the
country. That she eminently suc
ceeded in doing.”
Early this year a Stanford Li
brary book fund was established
to honor Mis Mirrielees. Those
who would care to contribute to
this fund, the Edith Mirrielees-
Pacific Spectator Book Fund for
the Humanities, may contact the
Director’s office at the Main Li

following of former students will
testify.
“A shorty story writer herself,
she made her own appraisal of
her abilities midway in her life
and set out to become one of the
best teachers of writing in the
country. That she eminently suc
ceeded in doing.”
