On a wind-swept, rocky “labora
tory,” 25 miles from San Francis
co’s Golden Gate, Stanford biolo
gists are attempting to extend
Charles Darwin’s 19th Century
"survival of the fittest” theories
in the light of modern principles
of genetics.
Their biological laboratory Is
an arid isle on which stands the
Farallon lighthouse.
Their research subjects form a
tough colony of ‘never-say-die’
animals that have existed for at
least 90 years.
PROF. DAVID REGNEBY and
two graduate students, David G.
Cameron and Theodore C. Finney,
are cataloguing the rabbits by
blood types to determine which
kind best survives the rigorous
conditions of wild Farallon life,
for there are no dlscernable
physical differences in the rab
bits.
After nearly two years of work
the Stanford trio reports that a
remarkable balance seems to be
maintained among the island’s
three rabbit types.
This constancy is startling be
cause, on the basis of Darwin’s
theories, one might expect that
after 90 years either “D” or “F”
types would have replaced the
others. Instead the biologists were
amazed to find all throe types co
existing.
