# Sterling Bids Hello
## 
### 
It is a pleasure to welcome
Summer session students. For
some the appropriate greeting
should be “Welcome Back;” for
others the greeting should be
“Welcome to Stanford.” To all
the greeting is cordial and per
sonal.
Stanford offers a varied sum
mer program of high academic
quality, complemented by special
conferences and workshops, and
an engaging schedule of cultural
events. I hope that each of you
will take advantage of these of
ferings according to your need
and choice.
Best wishes to each of you.
J. E. Wallace Sterling
