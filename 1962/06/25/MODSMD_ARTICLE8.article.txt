THORNY SMITH, summer stu
dent body president, stated, “I ex
tend a special invitation to the
young-at-heart among the visiting
students, regardless of physical
condition or marital status. The
Palo Alto Chiropractic Associa

“Unattached males are advised
to attend promptly, as the sum

4 to 1.”
No admission is charged for the
kick-off event. Refreshments will
be sold. Students may attend stag
or drag.
The reg dance stands as the
first in a full series of student ac
tivities slated by the summer leg
islature.
STUDENT PRESIDENT Smith
commented, “Realizing that the
summer student body has an
average age of about 28 years,
the student government plans to
have some events of a more se
date nature than the upcoming
registration brawl.
“Among these will be the water

melon feeds which provide ex
cellent family recreation, and the
all-campus dinner dance sched
uled for Saturday, July 28. Happy
hours will provide the of-age in
dividual with an excellent oppor
tunity to quietly annihilate him
self with beer.”
