### 
Twenty-five Japanese students
from Keio University. Tokyo, ar
rived at Stanford Thursday to
study this summer on an Ex
change program between the two
Universities.
The exchange is sponsored by
President Wallace Sterling and
President Takamura of Keio.
Under the exchange Stanford
students are regularly sent to
Keio for study, and exhibitions
are sponsored on campus on Japa
nese life and society.
THE PURPOSE of the program
is to help Japanese students un
derstand American college life
and principles of higher educa
tion, as well as to become more
familiar with American life and
character.
The group will travel on week
ends to see the Bay Area. Among
places which will be visited are
Carmel and Yosemite National
Park.
After summer school the group
will go to Los Angeles for three
weeks to stay with American
families in what is described as
"a cultural experiment.” In addi
tion they will see places of in
terest, such as factories and local
city government.
On campus the group will live
in Wilbur and Lagunita.
THEIR CLASS list will include
‘‘Twentieth Century American
History” with Prof. George
Knoles, acting chairman of the
History Department, and a special
class in English with Dr. Bush.
Two major activities for the
Stanford community will be spon
sored by the visiting scholars. On
“Japan Night,” the students will
give talks and show pictures of
Japan.
A second activity will be a dis
cussion of why Japanese students
hold political demonstrations, cen
tering on the nuclear testing is
sue, the American attitude toward
student demonstrations, and the
differing intents of demonstra
tion.
