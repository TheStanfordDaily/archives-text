# Stanford Players 'Happy Days': Truly Moving...Superb;' Plays Tonight Through Saturday Eve
## 
### PETER LYMAN Managing Editor 
At the point when one is grop
ing for understanding, Winnie
recalls the last visitors to see her.
They asked questions, “What is
she doing buried in the sand,” and
“What does it mean”?
"The usual drivel” said Winnie.
ONE GOES TO a play with an
expectancy of continuity of time
and meaning. This means at least
that one will not be betrayed and
understand nothing. The suspi
cion that he understands nothing
makes the playgoer nervous, as
if he had been cheated, and un
easy.
Samuel Beckett’s play “Happy
Days” is disturbing much of the
time because of this quality, but
the viewer in good faith must ex
pect to learn, and not abandon
himself to despair before having
seen the whole play.
The normal questions and ex
pectations one might ask of a
play are, in “Happy Days,” “usu
al drivel.” It does not matter who
Winnie and Willie are, or where
they are, or what they are trying
to do.
What matters is their relation
ship, and their individual human
ity. Beckett has removed the clues
to the usual questions, and one is
left with their humanity alone.
The set is initially striking for
its stark quality, but in time is
as Winnie sees it, a wilderness.
Time and change don’t exist, day
and night are just bells signaling
their presence.
AT FIRST ONLY Winnie is
there, and she very much alone
in her world without quality and
meaning. She talks of herself, her
array of possessions, and her
past, but remains buried in the
sand. She must know that Willie
is listening, or at least theoretic
ally could listen, or her talk
would be impossible.
Willie remains out of sight in
his hole in the sand, and some
times answers her. A Happy Day
is no more than his recognition
of her or her talk. Willie is, for
all his indifference, the only
thing besides herself which
changes or remains in the world.
Those who, in the general un
certainty at the end of the first
act, left, were surely disturbed
at Beckett for his refusal to ful
fill their expectations. But as
Winnie sunk into the sand and
lost her possessions and mobility,
and perhaps Willie, her aliena
tion is never completed. Through
the dramatic ending, and only
then, one is satisfied that the play
is over.
THE FINAL SCENE, for all its
simplicity, is truly moving. Beck
ett took so much away that the
importance and meaning of what
is left is made more important,
and more fulfilling.
It would be unfair to say more,
for the Stanford Players fine pro
duction speaks best for Itself.
Don’t prepare yourself, either by
reading the play or forming ex
pectations about what plays
"ought to do.” Especially don’t
expect the weird or strange sen
sation which modern theatre is
supposed to give. Beckett is still
speaking in human terms, but
with a creative approach which
gives meaning through new
modes of communication.
A cast of two, Muriel Rice as
Winnie, and Joel Climenhaga as
Willie, might be tedious, but is
excellent. Muriel Rice held the
audience’s attention and thought
without the ordinary props or
movements one expects to aid a

performer. Her voice and expres
sion, virtually her only tools of
communication, are used to per
fection. In a part which might be
disaster to a lesser actress she Is
superb.
WILLIE IS out of sight most
of the time, and is largely only a
prop in Beckett’s stage world.
His appearance is crucial to the
success of the entire work, and
was well handled to draw full
meaning from the play.
The setting by Wendell Cole is
excellent. It is wilderness, per
haps easier to think about than
to create on a stage. It is also
Winnie’s world, and certainly
Beckett’s idea of Winnie’s en
vironment and predicament was
difficult to create.

From this first fine production
the Stanford Contemporary The
atre Workshop summer series has
great promise. “Happy Days”
runs tonight, through Saturday
night in the Little Theatre.
N. F. Simpson’s “A Resounding
Tinkle” begins July 6 in the
Arena Theatre. Season tickets
for the five plays are $7.50 gen
eral public, and $6 for Stanford
students. Series and individual
tickets are on sale at the Memori
al Hall Box Office.
