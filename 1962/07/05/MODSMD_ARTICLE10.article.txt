## We Are All Conservatives And All Liberals —Goldman 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
"I’m afraid you’re going to
have to put me down, if you stay
with me, as one of the doubters
and the heretics of American cul
ture,” declared historian Eric
Goldman in the opening address
last week of his Institute of
American Studies series.
Speaking to a highly responsive
and near-capacity Dinkelspiel au
dience, Goldman eventually noted
that the “United States has ma
tured, fundamentally matured,
and in some very significant
senses.” This, however, was after
a citation of our current “appal
ling religiosity” as epitomized by
a Georgia church dispensing
Green Stamps to worshippers, a
blow at the so-called “Renaissance
of Southern traditions,” and criti
cal remarks on television, “that
lovely medium of new American
culture.”
GOLDMAN VIEWED the
American maturation, in his in
ductory lecture, through consid
eration of the conservative-liberal
split. Traditionally, this revolved
around the question, “Should
democracy mean the lessening of
extremes in wealth and status?”
This question was answered by a
“whole series of changes: social
legislation, the leveling effect of
two world wars . . . (which)
abolished the extremes.”
According to the prize-winning
historian, “Since World War 11,
conservatives in this country
have had not so much a plan as
a blueprint for strategic retreat.
The conservative ... is one who
agrees with the liberal ten, maybe
eight, maybe two years later.”
The traditional split is no longer
present: “All of us, except the
fringes, are all conservatives, all
liberals.”
GOLDMAN TRACES the cur
rent day cleavage in terms of for
eign policy, a cleavage which be
gan about 1947 and resulted in a
division over government policy
and the birth of those the lecturer
terms the “reconcilables” and the
“irreconcilables.”
The irreconcilables “spurned
peaceful co-existence .. . little
enthusiasm for the United Na
tions coalition ...” The recon
cilables broke with traditional
American history, promoted co
existence. saw the Communists in
Asia “wistfully . . . but as part

of a long-continuing social revo
lution."

Goldman’s second lecture pre
sented a portrait of the early
years of the twentieth century as
a time of ‘complacency and con
fidence.”
“This is the period in our his
tory when abundance was the
theme,” noted Goldman. There
was a unity promoted through
the homogeneity of the country
in stock and religion, “conformity
bound together by a stringent
morality.”
Under the complacency of the
times, however, there was a
“broad streak of worry, concern,
and a sense of conspiracy.” There
was a fear that we would be a fol
lower of Europe.
This drive of the American
people was met with a distinctive
method, according to the Prince
ton historian. It was an ethic of
technology, mass production, “not
politics, theology, or theory in any
sense,” that guided the American
people.
Reform was led by the noblesse
oblige attitude of the “patrician
class”—Jefferson, TR, FDR. The
“great genius of the American
people” was the compromise that
enabled farmer, laborer, business
and middle-class to change from
the early twentieth century posi
tions that would have led to “in
evitable clash.”
Goldman will continue his
series Monday night at 7:30 in
Cubberley.
