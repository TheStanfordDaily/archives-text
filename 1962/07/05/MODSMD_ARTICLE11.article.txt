### 
The Stanford Bookstore has an
nounced that its discount rate for
the fiscal year starting July 1,
1962, and ending June 30, 1963,
has been reduced from 10 per cent
to 8 per cent on sales at the
Bookstore.
W. A. Kimball, General Man
ager, explained that the reason
for the reduction is the store’s
rapid growth in book volume,
which in the past fiscal year has
risen to over 72 per cent of the
store’s total volume. While this
is a desired development for the
store, the low-profit margin on
books has made the payment of
the higher cash discount econom
ically unfeasible, he said.
This discount is extended only
to students enrolled for credit in
Stanford and to Stanford faculty
and staff members.
