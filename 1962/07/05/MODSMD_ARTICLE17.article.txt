# Gallery Features Chinese Painting
## 
### 
Freehand brush painting by an
outstanding contemporary Chi
nese painter is on exhibit at Stan
ford University Art Gallery now
through August 19.
The paintings are the work of
Professor Chao Shao-An, princi
pal of the Ling Nam Art School
and professor of Chinese Art at
Chung Chi College, both in Kow
loon, Hong Kong. In 1960 his
work was shown at the de Young
Museum in San Francisco.
COMMENTING recently on this
artist, Professor Chiang Yee of
Columbia University said, “There
are two traditional Chinese meth
ods of doing a flower-and-bird
painting; one is with contour
lines enclosing a space filled with
body or delicate color, the other
is freehand.
“Professor Chao’s method is
freehand brushwork. He incor
porates his own style of calligra

phy into his pictorial work. I sin
cerely hope those who see the
paintings will not call his work
merely 'Chinese Painting.’ Pro
fessor Chao’s flower-and-bird and
flower-and-insect paintings are
his alone.”
The Stanford Art Gallery is
open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tues
day through Saturday and from
12 to 4 on Sundays. It will close
after this exhibit.
THE STANFORD Museum is
now displaying works of art
given to the University this past
year, many of them through the
efforts of the 400-member volun
teer Committee for Art.
Central piece of the exhibit is
a Renaissance marble statue of
the Christ figure which will be
used as a teaching tool as an ex
ample of Renaissance sculpture.
Other recent gifts on display

include a rare standing stucco
Buddha from Thailand of the
Dvaravatl period and a sandstone
head of the Buddha from India of
the Gupta Dynasty.
A NEWLY ACQUIRED collec
tion of paintings from 1500 to the
present is on display in the Mie
del Room of the Museum. Includ
ed is a portrait. “Head of an Ital
ian Girl," by Frank Duveneck.
Also displayed is “Falling
Water” an oil painting by George
Ball. Ball received his A.B. and
A.M. at Stanford, and was award
ed a Fulbright grant in 1958 to
work in France. He has been as
sociated with Stanley William
Hayter at his Atelier 17 in Paris
since then.
This exhibit will remain through
the summer months at the Stan
ford Museum, which is open
daily from noon to 5 p.m.
