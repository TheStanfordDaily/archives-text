## Ethics for Leadership 
### DAN SCHWARTZ Associate Editor 
“All leaders are engaged in one
basic function; that of changing
people,” began Dr. S. Rains Wal
lace in the second Tuesday Eve
ning Series presentation for the
summer in Memorial Auditorium.
“Leaders must attempt to in
fluence the continuous change
that naturally exists in the peo
ple below him.” he said.
Wallace, who is the Director of
Research. Life Insurance Agency
Management Association, was in
troduced to the near-capacity au
dience by President Wallace Ster
ling.

IN HIS SPEECH entitled “The
Ethical Problems of Leadership:
The Value Structure of the Ad
ministration,” Wallace, after his
initial definition of leadership,
made the distinction between eth
ical problems and problems of
practicality, efficiency or accept
ability. He noted that while profit
sharing may seem best to him, it
is not unethical for the employer
to think first of his own, or his
stockholders’ earnings.

Management can act unethical
ly in two major ways, Wallace
said: by misrepresentation of in
tent or ability, or by advocation
of responsibility or fulfillment.
The manipulation of employees
by misrepresentation of either
abilities or of intent, Wallace said,
was unethical. He particularly
noted the practices followed in
hiring and training employees.

WALLACE GAVE MANY of
the not too well proven psycho
logical tests which many busi
nesses give to employees to show
either whether they should be
hired or promoted as an example
of advocation by management
and thus unethical.

Management often, he said, will
use the test as excuses for their
actions in dealing with personal
without either testing to make
sure that the tests were accurate,
or. if being inaccurate as Wallace
believes, finding the necessary in
formation about their personal to
deal with them properly.
THIS IS ALSO an example of
misrepresentation, Wallace felt,
because many administrators
claim to their employees to pos
sess workable means of evaluat
ing and training people when, in
fact, they do not.
Wallace was here as part of the
second annual Cubberley Confer
ence, which ends today.
