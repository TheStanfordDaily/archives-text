# 'Resounding Tinkle,' 'Incredible;' Set in Outdoor Arena Theatre
## 
### PETER LYMAN Managing Editor 
The Stanford Players are in
augurating a new outdoor arena
theatre with two fine plays, “A
Resounding Tinkle” by N. F.
Simpson and “Bedtime Story” by
Sean O’Casey.
THE THEATRE, The Outer
Circle, is on the East side of Me
morial Auditorium. The spectacu
lar setting provided for the per
formances is enhanced by the use
of trees and complementary ma
terials.
The dual performance is marred
by the combined length of the
plays, especially in the cool eve
ning air. The first, and shorter
work, “Bedtime Story,” is over
powered by its riotious successor,
even though it is a fine work
well performed.
"Bedtime Story,” directed by
Robert Loper, is best described
as a farce in the traditional dra
matic sense. JoAnne Akalaitis
and Chris Hampton play Angela
and Mulligan, the central figures
in this story of a young Irish lad
with a strict sense of morality
who takes a young lady to his
rooms to read Yeat’s poetry. He
then has a nightmarishly funny
time trying to get rid of her.
THE PLAY IS quite engaging,
and by the intermission one
thinks it a worthy tale. The sec
ond work, however, is a satire on
virtually everything in sight, in
cluding traditional dramatic
farces and humorous tales.
"A Resounding Tinkle” can
only be described as Incredible.
This is due not only to N. F.
Simpson’s originality as a play
wright, but to the cast, setting,
and direction. Nelda Halkett and
Herbert Kennedy play the Para
docks, the couple to whom several
mad situations occur. Victor
Mitchell directed the play, and
the cast’s highly developed esprit
de corps is probably to his credit.
The plot is not readily identi
fiable, but the play does not suf
fer by its lack of “meaning.” One
of the characters, a critic, de

scribed it as "a burlesque of a
parody on a skit about satire,”
and this Is fairly accurate. The
variety of characters and “mean
ings” provide genuine entertain
ment.

WHILE DESCRIBED as an ac
tor’s play in some sense it is also
an audience’s play. The charac
ters sometimes play to the audi
ence, sometimes to each other,
and sometimes to the lights, to
the amusement of all concerned.
It is an audience’s play because
without an Identifiable plot the
author was free to include vig
nette after vignette of hilarious
puns and outrageous situations,
all enhanced by the cast’s obvious

enjoyment.
The best situation was the cast
Joining the radio in singing "man
is a psychological phenomenon”
to the musical intonation of a
mass, followed by “Bill Bailey”
in the same form. This sort of
fun is why the play, if not pro
found, was a source of great en
joyment.
The Contemporary Theatre
Workshop will produce these
lively plays tonight, Friday, and
Saturday. Since this reviewer will
probably be joined by many who
saw it last weekend in returning
for tickets, an immediate visit to
the Memorial Hall Box Office is
necessary.
