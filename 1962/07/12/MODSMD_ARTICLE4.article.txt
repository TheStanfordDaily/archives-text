# Keio 'Japan Night’ Planned
## Song, Dance On Program 
### 
"Japan Night,” one of the ma
jor activities of the 25 Japanese
students from Keio University,
Tokyo, here for the Summer
Quarter, will be held tomorrow
night at 7:30 at the Women’s
Clubhouse.
THE PROGRAM will begin
with speeches by the Japanese
students on Japanese life and po
litical activities. Three talks en
titled, respectively, "The Japa
nese Position in the World and
the Prospect of Japan,” “Japa
nese Viewpoint on America; Our
Impression of America," and
“Japanese Cultural Assets” will
be presented.
The speeches will be followed
by a slide show which will try to
show, said one of the students,
“the conflict between the tradi
tional and the westernized in
Japan.”
“Japanese people are making a
desperate attempt, as any other
people in the rest of the world
are doing, to preserve its own
cultural assets. The influences
from abroad, however, seem to
attack the Japanese culture day
by day,” said the student. The
slides, by picturing the contrast
between the art and ways of the
traditional Japanese and the In
fluence of the Western world on
them, will show this conflict.
A SHORT intermission, with
refreshments, will then be fol
lowed by a series of Japanese
folk songs and dances. Included
in the group of classical folk
songs will be one in which one
student will sing a fisherman’s
song, while the other students act
out the story that is being told.
This will be followed by a series
of exhibits about the Japanese
way of life. These include one by
Miss Keiko Koizumi on the art
of flower arrangement, an exhi
bition of Calligraphy by Masahiro
Ushipima, and a Japanese Dance
by by five of the Japanese women
students.
THE PROGRAM will be con
cluded by the singing of some of
the popular and modern songs of
Japan. This group includes a cello
solo taken from an old Japanese
symphony which was originally
imported from China.
One of the students said that
modern Japanese composers have
learned a great deal from both
the ancient Japanese music and
the music of Western Europe.
“Hence modern music,” he said,
“composed in Japan is an amal
gamation of Western and Japa
nese classical.” The last collec
tion of songs, he explained, show
more of the Western influence
than the others.


KEIO SCHOLARS MISSES AIKO NAGTATO, Keiko Koizumi, and Jumiko Shigemori prepare for their full
dress performance at Japan Night tomorrow evening. Under the direction of their Stanford sponsor,
Lars Gantzel, the group will provide an insight into the culture and ways of Japan through the show.
