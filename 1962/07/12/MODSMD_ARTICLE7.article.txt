## Students Silent —Not 'Angry' 
### 
According to Professor Nevitt
Sanford, director of the Stanford
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, and author of the
"American College,” American
college students haven’t changed
from “silent” to an “angry” gen
eration over the past few decades.
In a background paper for the
student conference sponsored by
the National Commission on
Teacher Education and Profes
sional Standards, meeting last
week in Ft. Collins, Colorado,
Professor Sanford noted that the
number of students taking part
in sit-ins, peace vigils, and other
political demonstrations is very
small, while, for the most part,
students remain politically un
interested, apathetic, and con
servative-just as they were
found to be in the early ’so’s by a
Cornell reseirch team.
Absorbing the culture created
by their classmates is the major
educational experience of most
college students, Professor San
ford maintains, while the prevail
ing values are those of modera
tion and leveling.
“SAYS PROFESSOR Sanford,
“Times will undoubtedly change
and now ideas will appear, but for
the time being we are in the cul
tural and intellectual doldrums
. . . Not only are they not in
spired by the intellectual climate
. . . they are put to sleep by it.”
