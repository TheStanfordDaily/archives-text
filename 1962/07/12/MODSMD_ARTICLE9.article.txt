# Tin-Pan Alley, Ragtime Oust Old Ways-Goldman
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
Minorities began to act as a
“coercive element against the
stringent white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant morality . . . edging
it toward compromise, edging it
toward softening,” Eric Goldman
said of the early 1900’s to a filled
to-flowing Cubberley audience,
the likes of which Stanford does
not often see.
THE MIDDLE-CLASS morality
of the period, Goldman noted in
his third address Monday night,
was a “bastion of conservative
economic and social thought.”
Through a mocking, epitomized
by ragtime and tin-pan alley, this
morality was changed, “the
change never destroying the old,
but always compromising.”
Tin-pan alley was "completely
dominated by minorities . . . be
ginning to uphand the morality
by a kind of satire of the whole
thing.”
In his song “Alexander’s Rag
time Band,” Irving Berlin was
pleading, “come on stuffy Ameri
ca, come on and get unstuffy.”
He “forced ragtime onto the gen
eral public . . . with its old con
notation of decadence, impu
dence . .
THE BUSINESS ethic domi
nated the America of the 1900’s.
The businessman was “unldeo
logical, practical” and had a
“natural sense of compromise.”
McKinley’s campaign manager
Mark Hanna typified the era. He
organized, with business, labor,
and the general public represent
ed. the “National Civic Associa
tion.” Samuel Gompers joined in
and the two destructive possibili
ties—that labor would add fur
ther emotion by organizing by re
ligion or under philosophies in
compatible with capitalism—were
eliminated.
WELFARE CAPITALISM came
as an answer to the fears of gov
ernment action through welfare

statism, and a cycle began. Tills
came to be, said the dynamic his
torian, “the crazy-quilt motion
which forms the relation of busi
ness and government in this coun
try.’’
Goldman will deliver his fourth
lecture in the Institute of Ameri
can History series at 7:30 Monday
night in Dinkelspiel.
