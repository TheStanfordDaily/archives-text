# U.S.-Russ Vie Here Saturday
## Top Male-Female Track Stars Attempt Records 
### RON RAPOPORT 
With any luck at all the track
meet between the United States
and Russia in the Stadium this
weekend will be the most impor
tant battle engaged in between
representatives of the two coun
tries this year, unless Jack Paar
goes back to Berlin.
Starting time is 3:30 p.m. both
Saturday and Sunday. The top
track and field stars of both
countries will participate includ
ing the holders of 15 world rec
ords in the men’s and women’s
divisions.
OVER 150,000 fans are expect
ed to jam the Stadium during the
two days. Tickets are still avail
able with reserved seats selling
for $6 for both days and $3.50 for
one day and non-reserved seats
priced at $3 for two days and $2
for one.
Although the meet is to be tele
vised nationally Sunday, this
area will be blacked out. RGBS
will carry the radio account.
The athletes from both squads
are being housed at Stern Hall on
campus (veterans of the co-ed
housing movement take note) and
are also taking their meals there.
The Russian squad arrived late
Friday night and held its first
workout in the Stadium Satur
day. They spent most of the time
loosening up, playing soccer
(“What are you doing?” yelled
one Russian male at a member of
the women’s team who caught
the ball. “It’s allowed for wom
en,’’ she replied.), and staving off
such questions from reporters as,
“Do you have pineapples and
other fruit in Russia?” The un
official answer, heard by the in
terpreter as she dutifully came
back to the writers was, “Hah,
they don’t think we have those
things.” Both teams are now prac
ticing daily at Angell Field.
TWO OF THE TOP events will
be the high jump and the broad
jump. In the high jump Russian
world record holder Valery Bru
mel will take on U.S. champion
John Thomas of Boston Universi
ty. Brumel's top mark is a stag

gering 7-4% and his best for the
year is 7-2%. Thomas set his
American record of 7-3% at Stan
ford during the 1960 Olympic
trials. John has been off his feed
lately, however, as his best for
the year is 6-10%. Gene Johnson,
who has jumped over seven feet
this year, will also be competing
for the U.S.
In the broad jump America’s
Ralph Boston, who holds the list
ed world’s record at 27-1%, will
meet Russia’s Igor Terovanesyan,
whose jump of 27-3 is the pend
ing world mark.
The biggest name among the
women competitors is that of
sprinter Wilma Rudolph of Ten
nessee State. Miss Rudolph holds
world records in the 100- and 200-
meter dash.
THE RUSSIAN WOMEN only
partly live up to their reputation
as brawny, slightly unfeminine
females. At the opening practice
session there were several slight,
heavily made-up girls who gave
the men a run for it in terms of
agility and speed.
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan said that the Russians
were very happy with the physi
cal condition of the Stadium in
cluding the track and the turf.
Brumel, however, has asked that
the bales of hay bounding the
pole vault pit be turned slightly
so as not to interfere with his ap
proach to the high jump stand
ard. Brumel also wanted the
grass mowed farther away from
the high jump pit than it was
originally. He takes an unusually
long and wide approach to the
bar.
THINGS MUST HAVE been
taken care of to Brumel’s liking
because in Sunday’s practice he
cleared 7-3 for the benefit of a
crowd estimated at over 4,000.
Among the American stars
competing are discus throwers
Rink Babka and A1 Dexter, shot
putters Gary Gubner and Dallas
Long, 1500-meter runners Jim
Beatty and Jim Grelk, 400-meter
hurdler Rex Cawley, 110-meter
hurdler Hays Jones and 5000-
meter runner Nat Tenex.


RUSSIAN ATHLETES GATHER on the lawn outside Stern Hall for an early morning discussion. The
athletes, all clad in navy blue track pants, have been spending much of their non-practice time re
laxing in front of the Muir television set and on the volleyball courts.

Starting time is 3:30 p.m. both
Saturday and Sunday. The top
track and field stars of both
countries will participate includ
ing the holders of 15 world rec
ords in the men’s and women’s
divisions.
OVER 150,000 fans are expect
ed to jam the Stadium during the
two days. Tickets are still avail
able with reserved seats selling
for $6 for both days and $3.50 for
one day and non-reserved seats
priced at $3 for two days and $2
for one.
Although the meet is to be tele
vised nationally Sunday, this
area will be blacked out. RGBS
will carry the radio account.
The athletes from both squads
are being housed at Stern Hall on
campus (veterans of the co-ed
housing movement take note) and
are also taking their meals there.
The Russian squad arrived late
Friday night and held its first
workout in the Stadium Satur
day. They spent most of the time
loosening up, playing soccer
(“What are you doing?” yelled
one Russian male at a member of
the women’s team who caught
the ball. “It’s allowed for wom
en,’’ she replied.), and staving off
such questions from reporters as,
“Do you have pineapples and
other fruit in Russia?” The un
official answer, heard by the in
terpreter as she dutifully came
back to the writers was, “Hah,
they don’t think we have those
things.” Both teams are now prac
ticing daily at Angell Field.
TWO OF THE TOP events will
be the high jump and the broad
jump. In the high jump Russian
world record holder Valery Bru
mel will take on U.S. champion
John Thomas of Boston Universi
ty. Brumel's top mark is a stag

gering 7-4% and his best for the
year is 7-2%. Thomas set his
American record of 7-3% at Stan
ford during the 1960 Olympic
trials. John has been off his feed
lately, however, as his best for
the year is 6-10%. Gene Johnson,
who has jumped over seven feet
this year, will also be competing
for the U.S.
In the broad jump America’s
Ralph Boston, who holds the list
ed world’s record at 27-1%, will
meet Russia’s Igor Terovanesyan,
whose jump of 27-3 is the pend
ing world mark.
The biggest name among the
women competitors is that of
sprinter Wilma Rudolph of Ten
nessee State. Miss Rudolph holds
world records in the 100- and 200-
meter dash.
THE RUSSIAN WOMEN only
partly live up to their reputation
as brawny, slightly unfeminine
females. At the opening practice
session there were several slight,
heavily made-up girls who gave
the men a run for it in terms of
agility and speed.
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan said that the Russians
were very happy with the physi
cal condition of the Stadium in
cluding the track and the turf.
Brumel, however, has asked that
the bales of hay bounding the
pole vault pit be turned slightly
so as not to interfere with his ap
proach to the high jump stand
ard. Brumel also wanted the
grass mowed farther away from
the high jump pit than it was
originally. He takes an unusually
long and wide approach to the
bar.
THINGS MUST HAVE been
taken care of to Brumel’s liking
because in Sunday’s practice he
cleared 7-3 for the benefit of a
crowd estimated at over 4,000.
Among the American stars
competing are discus throwers
Rink Babka and A1 Dexter, shot
putters Gary Gubner and Dallas
Long, 1500-meter runners Jim
Beatty and Jim Grelk, 400-meter
hurdler Rex Cawley, 110-meter
hurdler Hays Jones and 5000-
meter runner Nat Tenex.


RUSSIAN ATHLETES GATHER on the lawn outside Stern Hall for an early morning discussion. The
athletes, all clad in navy blue track pants, have been spending much of their non-practice time re
laxing in front of the Muir television set and on the volleyball courts.
With any luck at all the track
meet between the United States
and Russia in the Stadium this
weekend will be the most impor
tant battle engaged in between
representatives of the two coun
tries this year, unless Jack Paar
goes back to Berlin.

ed to jam the Stadium during the
two days. Tickets are still avail
able with reserved seats selling
for $6 for both days and $3.50 for
one day and non-reserved seats
priced at $3 for two days and $2
for one.
Although the meet is to be tele
vised nationally Sunday, this
area will be blacked out. RGBS
will carry the radio account.
The athletes from both squads
are being housed at Stern Hall on
campus (veterans of the co-ed
housing movement take note) and
are also taking their meals there.
The Russian squad arrived late
Friday night and held its first
workout in the Stadium Satur
day. They spent most of the time
loosening up, playing soccer
(“What are you doing?” yelled
one Russian male at a member of
the women’s team who caught
the ball. “It’s allowed for wom
en,’’ she replied.), and staving off
such questions from reporters as,
“Do you have pineapples and
other fruit in Russia?” The un
official answer, heard by the in
terpreter as she dutifully came
back to the writers was, “Hah,
they don’t think we have those
things.” Both teams are now prac
ticing daily at Angell Field.
TWO OF THE TOP events will
be the high jump and the broad
jump. In the high jump Russian
world record holder Valery Bru
mel will take on U.S. champion
John Thomas of Boston Universi
ty. Brumel's top mark is a stag

gering 7-4% and his best for the
year is 7-2%. Thomas set his
American record of 7-3% at Stan
ford during the 1960 Olympic
trials. John has been off his feed
lately, however, as his best for
the year is 6-10%. Gene Johnson,
who has jumped over seven feet
this year, will also be competing
for the U.S.
In the broad jump America’s
Ralph Boston, who holds the list
ed world’s record at 27-1%, will
meet Russia’s Igor Terovanesyan,
whose jump of 27-3 is the pend
ing world mark.
The biggest name among the
women competitors is that of
sprinter Wilma Rudolph of Ten
nessee State. Miss Rudolph holds
world records in the 100- and 200-
meter dash.
THE RUSSIAN WOMEN only
partly live up to their reputation
as brawny, slightly unfeminine
females. At the opening practice
session there were several slight,
heavily made-up girls who gave
the men a run for it in terms of
agility and speed.
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan said that the Russians
were very happy with the physi
cal condition of the Stadium in
cluding the track and the turf.
Brumel, however, has asked that
the bales of hay bounding the
pole vault pit be turned slightly
so as not to interfere with his ap
proach to the high jump stand
ard. Brumel also wanted the
grass mowed farther away from
the high jump pit than it was
originally. He takes an unusually
long and wide approach to the
bar.
THINGS MUST HAVE been
taken care of to Brumel’s liking
because in Sunday’s practice he
cleared 7-3 for the benefit of a
crowd estimated at over 4,000.
Among the American stars
competing are discus throwers
Rink Babka and A1 Dexter, shot
putters Gary Gubner and Dallas
Long, 1500-meter runners Jim
Beatty and Jim Grelk, 400-meter
hurdler Rex Cawley, 110-meter
hurdler Hays Jones and 5000-
meter runner Nat Tenex.


RUSSIAN ATHLETES GATHER on the lawn outside Stern Hall for an early morning discussion. The
athletes, all clad in navy blue track pants, have been spending much of their non-practice time re
laxing in front of the Muir television set and on the volleyball courts.
With any luck at all the track
meet between the United States
and Russia in the Stadium this
weekend will be the most impor
tant battle engaged in between
representatives of the two coun
tries this year, unless Jack Paar
goes back to Berlin.
Starting time is 3:30 p.m. both
Saturday and Sunday. The top
track and field stars of both
countries will participate includ
ing the holders of 15 world rec
ords in the men’s and women’s
divisions.
