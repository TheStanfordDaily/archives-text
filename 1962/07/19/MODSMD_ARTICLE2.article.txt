# Goldman Distresses Listeners With Tale of Negro Murder
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Editor 
As Eric Goldman devoted the
major part of his fourth campus
address Monday to the early
1900’s burning of a Negro in a
Pennsylvania town, more than 35
people left the audience either in
objection to the tale or in annoy
ance with the fact, but certainly
not in boredom.
IN HIS INSTITUTE of Ameri
can History series lecture, Gold
man considered VThose Things
That Were Not Compromised,”
the minority immigrants. In addi
tion to the American westward
immigration, Goldman felt there
were two immigrations that do
not receive their just considera
tion: that from Eastern and

Southern Europe, and the Ne
groes from South ot North.
The white Anglo-Saxon Prot
estants (WASPs) that originally
settled the country had felt an
“enormous sense of security,”
but found the “influx bringing
every day a more direct chal
lenge” to their supremacy. “The
older groups felt threatened, and
the newer groups were in the
mood to threaten,” analyzed the
historian.
THE LATE 1890’s and early
1900's saw the “development of a
new kind of racism in our coun
try.” Previously we had had a
“mild racism, a self confident rac
ism ... a racism with few fangs
in it.” The new migrations

brought a “frightened belligerent
racism.”

“The compromises worked out
in this period,” noted Goldman,
“not only ignored the minorities,
but were made in an atmosphere
hostile to them.” “Uppityness”
came to be the characterization of
the immigrant as he stepped to
better jobs, homes, and contacts
with the society. Booker T. Wash
ington-type gradualness was re
placed by the NAACP as “uppity
ness became organized.”
“THE LYNCHING of Negroes
begins to slither outside the
South,” related Goldman, until in
1910 the NAACP estimated them
at one a day.

Goldman’s controversial tale in
volved the infamous Coatsville,
Pa., burning of a hospitalized Ne
gro, Zachrimiah Walker, by the
progeny of the Quakers, a people
with a “WASP background of
great humanitarian zeal.”

All summer quarter stu
dents are reminded to pick up
pictures for student body
cards, available now, from
the receptionist’s desk at the
Registrar's office. Ask for
Mrs. Molendyk.

older groups felt threatened, and
the newer groups were in the
mood to threaten,” analyzed the
historian.
THE LATE 1890’s and early
1900's saw the “development of a
new kind of racism in our coun
try.” Previously we had had a
“mild racism, a self confident rac
ism ... a racism with few fangs
in it.” The new migrations

brought a “frightened belligerent
racism.”

“The compromises worked out
in this period,” noted Goldman,
“not only ignored the minorities,
but were made in an atmosphere
hostile to them.” “Uppityness”
came to be the characterization of
the immigrant as he stepped to
better jobs, homes, and contacts
with the society. Booker T. Wash
ington-type gradualness was re
placed by the NAACP as “uppity
ness became organized.”
“THE LYNCHING of Negroes
begins to slither outside the
South,” related Goldman, until in
1910 the NAACP estimated them
at one a day.

Goldman’s controversial tale in
volved the infamous Coatsville,
Pa., burning of a hospitalized Ne
gro, Zachrimiah Walker, by the
progeny of the Quakers, a people
with a “WASP background of
great humanitarian zeal.”

As Eric Goldman devoted the
major part of his fourth campus
address Monday to the early
1900’s burning of a Negro in a
Pennsylvania town, more than 35
people left the audience either in
objection to the tale or in annoy
ance with the fact, but certainly
not in boredom.
IN HIS INSTITUTE of Ameri
can History series lecture, Gold
man considered VThose Things
That Were Not Compromised,”
the minority immigrants. In addi
tion to the American westward
immigration, Goldman felt there
were two immigrations that do
not receive their just considera
tion: that from Eastern and

Southern Europe, and the Ne
groes from South ot North.
