# 'Restless' Age Can't Deny Musical Tradition
## 
### IAN DENGLER Associate Editor 
An enthusiastic band of devo
tees to the “newest musical idi
oms” filled the center aisle of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Monday
to hear Andrew Imbrie, member
of the faculty of the University
of California lecture on the “Com
poser and the Past.”
As part of the Music Depart
ment’s continuing Monday after
noon series, “The Sound and
Sense of Contemporary Music,”
Imbrie’s lecture was devoted to
an analysis of the importance of
“Tradition” to the modern com
poser, and a discussion of how
this sense of a ‘musical tradition’
has affected the work of other
composers.
CALLING THE present age an
“era of restless search for new
forms.” Imbrie pointed out that
fast changes have caused “isola
tion” for a number of older com
posers, while younger ones who
lack a meaningful “tradition,” are
subject to a fear of technical in
adequacy that can often be sub
stituted by a rigid formula that

removes the difficulties of de
cision-making from the artist.
Present schools of thought
seem to have become apologists
for "tradition” and attempt to ex
plain it away either by psycho
logical interpretation of why the
composer “composes,” or seek to
deny that "tradition” is a valid
source of criticism and discussion,
by claiming that each piece of
music is a thing in itself not
comparable to any other work.
Actually, Imbrie argues, tradi
tion cannot be dispensed with by
either method, for "tradition,”
even in apparent denial, will have
a pervading in?uence on any com
poser.
THE SERIES WILE continue
next Monday, at 4:15 p.m., with a
lecture by Leonard Stein, one of
the foremost interpreters of
avant-garde music, on “Listening
to Serial Music: Comprehension
out of Chaos.”
The Music Department also of
fers a series of lectures by S.
Stravinski for the next three
Tuesday’s in Dinkelspiel Auditori
