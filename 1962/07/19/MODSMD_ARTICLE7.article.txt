# Female Golfer Tops Monday's Tourney

### STUART FOX 
A 21-year-old Arizona State
senior copped first place at the
Stanford Summer Invitational
Golf Tournament Monday. Rosa
lie Sheedy, currently enrolled in
two graduate courses (‘‘by mis
take,” she notes) in education,
golfed a 39 for the nine-hole
tourney.
The Elementary Education ma

jor has been playing golf for
three years, and in that short
time has played twice in the Na
tional Intercollegiate Tourna
ment. Two years ago, at the Uni
versity of Michigan, she placed
first in her class, and last year
qualified for the top classification
of play.
Miss Sheedy’s latter day golf
interest was developed when she
became close friends with two
championship golfers at Arizona
State: twice national amateur
champion Jo Anne Gunderson, and
recently-turned-professional golf
er Sherry Wheeler.
The blind bogey handicap re
sulted in a tie between Chet Hin
shaw, who scored a 40 and chose
a handicap of 2, and Robert Owen
who scored 46 and chose a handi
cap of -4, which brought both
players to the secretly drawn
number of 42. Hinshaw and Owen
flipped a coin under the watchful
eye of athletics coordinator Bruce
Achauer, with Hinshaw comipg
out on top.


COLLEGIATE GOLF CHAMPION Rosalie Sheedy took first place
at the Summer Invitational Tourney here. The skillful miss described
the Stanford course as "the most beautiful I've ever seen—and the
weather . . . !" However, the champ thought the course was "hard
if you are not used to trees or hills."
