### IAN DENGLER Associate Editor 
Another center-aisle filling au
dience collected at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last Monday after
noon to hear Professor Leonard
Stein continue the Music Depart
ment’s summer lecture series
“The Sound and Sense of Con
temporary Music.”
Professor Stein, one of the fore
most interpreters of avant-garde
music, and professor of music at
Pomona College, prefaced his lec
ture as an attempt to relate the
modern serial composer, such as
Schonberg, Stockhausen and We
bern, to classical forms and dem
onstrate the use of such forms in
the apparently aimless works of
a number of modern composers.
Calling his lecture “Serial
Music; Comprehension out of
Chaos,” Professor Stein amassed
considerable evidence as to the
use of such ‘classical’ forms and
even some as to the ‘comprehen
sibility’ of these to the modern
listener through a well performed
piano exhibition of each.
The Music Department’s series
will continue at 4:15 p.m. next
Monday in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um with a lecture by Leo Smit,
long known as a composer and
pianist well acquainted with
American folk music and the role
of jazz in the works of such com
posers as Stravinski, Milhaud and
Hindemith, who will speak on the
“Masters of Jazz.”
