# Memory Tests Need Volunteers
## 
### 
Dr. Laurence Horowitz, of the
psychology department, needs
subjects for his studies on the
nature of memory. In these
studies the subject is usually
asked to learn a list of words; the
session lasts 50 minutes at most.
The experimenter will explain the
purpose of the study afterwards.
Each subject who participates
in one of these sessions will have
his name placed on a card, which
will then be deposited in a box.
On August 16 a drawing will be
held (all are invited to attend)
and nine names will be selected at
random. The first two winners
will receive $25 each, the next
three winners, $lO each, and the
remaining four winners, $5 each.
A name may be entered more
than once by participation in
more than one session. Appoint
ment sheets are posted on the
psychology department’s bulletin
board on the main floor (between
rooms 9 and 10) of the Education
building (Cubberley). A limited
number of subjects is needed, so
the chances for participating are
best if appointments are sched
uled now.
