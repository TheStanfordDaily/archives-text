# Stanford Dramas Termed 'Uneven'
## 
### PETER LYMAN Managing Editor 
The Stanford Players dual pro
duction of “Zoo Story” and “Sud
denly Last Summer” combines
some excellent acting with some
mediocre in the first uneven pro
duction of the summer. “Zoo
Story” is well staged and directed
and profits from a brilliant per
formance by Len Schropfer.
“Suddenly Last Summer” is not
well staged, and the actors seem
unfamiliar with their roles.
EDWARD ALBEE’S “Zoo
Story” is an unusual approach to
the conflict between the socially
Integrated middle class and the
socially alienated. Peter, played
by Paul Rodgers, is a respectable
middle class businessman with
two daughters and a cat, Jerry,
Len Schropfer, is unstable and
shares none of Peter’s values.
Jerry antagonizes Peter and man
ipulates him into betraying his
values. The antagonism is rather
obscurely presented, but excellent
performances by the two actors
make the play worthy of praise.
Though Tennessee William’s ul
timate value is as yet undeter
mined, “Suddenly Last Summer”
was no more than an amateur
production of an undistinguished
play. In general the actors lacked

presence and a convincing qual
ity, but two deserve special no
tice.

Karen Grassle as Catherine
came as close as carrying off the
whole production as possible.
Where the others seemed to be
wandering about delivering parts
of conversations she was there,
involved, and interesting. Due to
the nature of her part one’s sym
pathy is with Catherine, but last
Friday’s audience was dependent
upon her alone for entertainment.

SURELY THE DOCTOR, play
ed by Burton Swartz, also de
serves comment, for he typified
the production. Neither of the
two expressions at his command
sufficed for the occasion. When
standing over Mrs. Venable, Ellen
Headley, in the beginning he
looked genuinely uncomfortable
on stage. His closing line, crucial
to the resolution of the play and
Catherine’s dilemma, was lost in
his ho-hum professional air.
In a Contemporary Theatre
series one cannot always expect
communication between the au
thor and the audience to be good.
“Zoo Story” is hard to under
stand, but aided by the perform
ance. “Suddenly Last Summer” is
not a particularly outstanding
play and lacked the tremendous
help a good performance can pro
vide. The two will play this week
end in the Outer Circle Theatre.
