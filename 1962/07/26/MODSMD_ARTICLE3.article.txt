# Crowd Cheers for Meet As USSR Wins Totals
## 
### 
Over 150,000 people thrilled to
what many experts considered to
be the best USA-USSR Track
Meet of the series last weekend
in the Stanford Stadium.

The wildly enthusiastic crowd
that had come more to see the
Russians than for the sport, and
were, in fact, little accustomed
to track, soon found themselves
in complete silence as they waited
for Russian high-jumper Valeriy
Brumel to make his first attempt
at the world record breaking 7’5"
jump, and then roared, long and
loud, as both he and they looked
back with surprise to see that he
had cleared the bar.

The only other world record
breaker, American Hal Connolly's
231’9” hammer throw, almost
went unnoticed by the crowd
when he threw it in the midst of
other events, but brought every
one off his chair when his feat
was announced.

One of the closest meets of
the series, last weekend’s score
of USA Men: 128, Women: 41,
and USSR Men: 107, Women: 66,
brought surprises both good and
bad to both teams.

Although Washington’s high
jumping John Cramer was ex
pected by everyone to finish sec
ond in the Pole Vault, behind fi
berglass poling Ron Morris, who
won with a 16’%” high swing, he
failed to qualify, and did not even
win a single point of a fourth
place.
Nor could anyone foretell that
decathlon champion Yuriy Kuten
ko would develop a kidney stone
problem after only three events,
and have to leave the contest
eventually won by teammate
Vasily Kuznetsov.
The spirit of love and friend
ship prevailed, and was pinpoint
ed by the embracing closing cere
monies of the two teams.
