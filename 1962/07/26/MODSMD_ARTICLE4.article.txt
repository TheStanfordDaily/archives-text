# Goldman Gives Importance to World War
## 
### DAN SCHWARTZ Acting Editor 
“World War I was the first
time in modern American history
when there was the use of laws,
and the subsequent acceptance of
these laws, which laid down lines
of what was thought and what
was not thought,” said Eric F.
Goldman, Professor of History,
Princeton University, in his fifth
lecture in his current series at
Stanford on American life.

In his lecture, entitled “World
War I: Neglected Revolutionist,”
and probably the best of his series
so far, Goldman told the as ex
pected overflow audience in Cub
berley Monday night, that World
War I is usually treated as an un
important part of American his
tory, with interest being shown to
the military and diplomatic
phases, and with only a small
amount of time spent on the im
portant influence of the war on
the American way of life.

Part of this Influence was on
the American businessmen, who
were brought into governmental
operations during the war and
began to discover two basic
things about their influence on
the government.

THE FIRST was that it wasn't
regulations of themselves that
helped or hurt, but who control
led and administered them. There
fore, if they were conducted in a
pro-business way, the regulations
could appear as a positive good
for business.

The second thing, which was
spread throughout the entire
American community, was an ac
ceptance of government influence
and intervention, and greater in
fluence from the welfare state.

Another big change, Goldman
said, was the change from the old
to the new moralities, not only as
the soldiers went to Europe, and
found that the old time morality
did not necessarily apply, but
also with the coming of people to
the war jobs in the cities, and the
success of the feminist movement
as women began to take over,
respectfully, in the jobs vacated
by the lighting men.
THE BIGGEST change though,
he said, was in the mass propa
ganda tactics first used positive
ly to influence the public in such
things as the draft, and the groat
switch toward a national purpose
feeling over individual feelings.
This led, he felt, to both bad
and good things. The ."act that
certain things, such as m 'ss pro
duction, were done better in the
national interest was good, but
the same idea also provided self
appointed vigilantes with an ex
cuse to inflict their own ideas, as
being in the “national good,” on
those who disagreed with them.
“AS IN ALL revolutions,” he
concluded, “World War I brought
both bad and good, and we can
not ignore the simple fact,
whether good or bad, that this
was a revolution.”

time in modern American history
when there was the use of laws,
and the subsequent acceptance of
these laws, which laid down lines
of what was thought and what
was not thought,” said Eric F.
Goldman, Professor of History,
Princeton University, in his fifth
lecture in his current series at
Stanford on American life.

In his lecture, entitled “World
War I: Neglected Revolutionist,”
and probably the best of his series
so far, Goldman told the as ex
pected overflow audience in Cub
berley Monday night, that World
War I is usually treated as an un
important part of American his
tory, with interest being shown to
the military and diplomatic
phases, and with only a small
amount of time spent on the im
portant influence of the war on
the American way of life.

Part of this Influence was on
the American businessmen, who
were brought into governmental
operations during the war and
began to discover two basic
things about their influence on
the government.

THE FIRST was that it wasn't
regulations of themselves that
helped or hurt, but who control
led and administered them. There
fore, if they were conducted in a
pro-business way, the regulations
could appear as a positive good
for business.

The second thing, which was
spread throughout the entire
American community, was an ac
ceptance of government influence
and intervention, and greater in
fluence from the welfare state.

Another big change, Goldman
said, was the change from the old
to the new moralities, not only as
the soldiers went to Europe, and
found that the old time morality
did not necessarily apply, but
also with the coming of people to
the war jobs in the cities, and the
success of the feminist movement
as women began to take over,
respectfully, in the jobs vacated
by the lighting men.
THE BIGGEST change though,
he said, was in the mass propa
ganda tactics first used positive
ly to influence the public in such
things as the draft, and the groat
switch toward a national purpose
feeling over individual feelings.
This led, he felt, to both bad
and good things. The ."act that
certain things, such as m 'ss pro
duction, were done better in the
national interest was good, but
the same idea also provided self
appointed vigilantes with an ex
cuse to inflict their own ideas, as
being in the “national good,” on
those who disagreed with them.
“AS IN ALL revolutions,” he
concluded, “World War I brought
both bad and good, and we can
not ignore the simple fact,
whether good or bad, that this
was a revolution.”
