# BARGAINING
## Great Problem Of Times: Role Of Government 
### KENT SMITH 
The Tuesday Evening Series
this week featured Dr. William
Gomberg, who discussed “The
Prospects for the American Col
lective Bargaining System.” Gom
berg, from the Wharton School of
Finance and Commerce, is par
ticipating in the Business School’s
Summer Executive Development
Program.
Collective bargaining in the
U.S. today, Gomberg said, can
only be understood by examining
the nature of the institution and
its environment. First of all,
there is a basic confusion within
both Management and Labor
demonstrated by their expressed
principles versus their operating
behavior.
However, the basis of our mod
ern industrial system is mutual
accommodation and both labor
and management strongly protect
their right to make “a deal.” Both
recognize the desirability of lais
sez faire in the economy but “no
one has ever determined who
should leave who alone.” Al
though the controversies and the
break-downs in the system seem
to be stressed, Gomberg consid
ers it “a miracle it works as well
as it does.”
“THE GREAT unresolved prob
lem of our time,” Gomberg said,
“is the proper role of government
in bargaining.” Although govern
ment must fulfill its responsibili
ty to the public, “Statlsm,” partic
ularly the attempts of economics
intellectuals “to fit the system to
the Procrustean bed of their
model” by the use of government
pressure can only end in failure.
Gomberg would prefer relying on
the workings of the market, “im
perfect as it is,” to the unwise
meddling of the young intellectu
als.
OUR LABOR-management re
lations, indeed our industrial sys
tem, rests on a successful “equi
librium,” Gomberg believes; the
system is better “left alone” than
bedeviled with “unwise interven
tion.” Encouraging experiments
between management and labor,
as in the recent Kaiser Steel
Strike, with voluntary arbitration
in the formulation stage of policy,
rather than the crisis-dispute
stage, are the hope of the future.
To continue the success of the
American economic system and
its fundamental dynamism, both
management and labor, Gomberg
believes, “must concentrate on
the collective bargaining mechan
ism.”
