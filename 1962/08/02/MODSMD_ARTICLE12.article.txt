# Eichler Awarded BuiIding Contract
## 
### 
Eichlor Homes, Inc., of Palo
Alto, has been awarded the $700,-
000 building contract for construc
tion of Stanford’s new Computa
tion Center.
Two buildings will be built in
the project providing 33,000
square feet of floor space that will
house two electronic computer
systems plus 53 offices and con
ference rooms. Claude Oakland,
A.1.A., is the architect.
The buildings will house IBM
7090-1401 and Burroughs 85000
computers. The new units will
provide 50 times more computer
capacity than now is available at
Stanford.
Professor George E. Forsythe,
Computation Center director, said
students will be the primary users
of the computers. Nearly 1,600
students are now enrolled in 43
courses in which computers are
used, he said.
One of the two computer build
ings, to provide 19,000 square feet
of floor space, will be two stories
in height and will contain the of
fices and conference rooms.
The other, to provide 14,100
square feet of floor space, will
have a special floor which can be
opened at any point to gain access
to power cables and ventilating
systems, allowing flexibility in
arrangement of computer equip
ment.
Outdoor courts and patios will
be provided for the two buildings
in addition to parking space for
172 cars. Eichler has commis
sioned landscape architects, Roy

ston, Hanamoto, Mayes & Beck
to do the landscaping.
The Center will be adjacent to
the office building complex al
ready built by Eichler, which now
houses the School Mathematics
Study Group and Nevit Sanford’s
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
With Eichler’s mass-production
capabilities, the Computation Cen
ter is expected to be completed by
December Ist, in time for full use
for the coming Winter Quarter.
