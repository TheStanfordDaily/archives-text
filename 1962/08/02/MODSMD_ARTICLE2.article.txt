# Concert by Stravinski Far-ranging
## 
### IAN DENGLER Associate Editor 
Varied technique marked the
first of two piano recitals by the
internationally acclaimed concert
pianist Soulima Stravinski last
Friday night in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
Playing to a nearly filled hall,
Stravinski’s recital, part of the
Music Department’s Summer Con
cert Series, included the works of
such far-ranging composers as
Carl Maria von Weber, Beethoven,
Couperin and Maurice Ravel.
UNDOUBTEDLY the high point
point of the concert was Stravin
ski’s interpretation, following a
rather lukewarm performance of
Bach’s Partita in C minor and Ra
vel’s Sonatine, of three sonatas of
Domenico Scarlatti. Well received
by the audience, Stravinski then
went on to conclude the concert
with a series of Rondos from Ra
meau to Liszt and two short en
cores.
Stravinski, son of the composer
Igor Stravinski, is currently at
Stanford teaching a month-long
master class in modern piano.
He is professor of music at the
University of Illinois, and has ap
peared with the major symphony
orchestras in this country as well
as in Canada, Europe and North
Africa.
HIS TWO concerts are appar
ently designed to exhibit the range
of piano composition over the last
three hundred years; the concert
last Friday including works up to
the end of the nineteenth century,
while his second concert is sched
uled to include modern piano
works of such composers as Hin
demith, Petrassi, Bartok and Pro
kofiev.
This concluding concert will be
held tomorrow night in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium at 8:30 p.m.
In another Music Department
Summer Series, “The Sound and
Sense of Contemporary Music,”
Leo Smit, professor of music at
UCLA, gave a lecture last Mon
day afternoon in Dinkelspiel Aud
itorium on “The Masters Write
Jazz.”
CALLING the present musical
tradition one of “recomposition”
of both earlier and contemporary
forms, Smit noted that except for
Charles Ives, jazz was largely ig
nored by early American compos
ers and it had to be “discovered”
by such “non-native” ones as Mil
haud and Stravinski, and integrat
ed into their works.
The “masters” don’t actually
“write” jazz, says Smit, but “re
compose” it by transferring cer
tain of its elements into their own
style. Jazz used to refer not to a
type of music but to the speed or
enthusiasm that went into a per
formance, and, says Smit, “this
enthusiasm has not been lost on
modern composers of the twen
tieth century.”

tieth century.”
Varied technique marked the
first of two piano recitals by the
internationally acclaimed concert
pianist Soulima Stravinski last
Friday night in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
Playing to a nearly filled hall,
Stravinski’s recital, part of the
Music Department’s Summer Con
cert Series, included the works of
such far-ranging composers as
Carl Maria von Weber, Beethoven,
Couperin and Maurice Ravel.
UNDOUBTEDLY the high point
point of the concert was Stravin
ski’s interpretation, following a
rather lukewarm performance of
Bach’s Partita in C minor and Ra
vel’s Sonatine, of three sonatas of
Domenico Scarlatti. Well received
by the audience, Stravinski then
went on to conclude the concert
with a series of Rondos from Ra
meau to Liszt and two short en
cores.
Stravinski, son of the composer
Igor Stravinski, is currently at
Stanford teaching a month-long
master class in modern piano.
He is professor of music at the
University of Illinois, and has ap
peared with the major symphony
orchestras in this country as well
as in Canada, Europe and North
Africa.
HIS TWO concerts are appar
ently designed to exhibit the range
of piano composition over the last
three hundred years; the concert
last Friday including works up to
the end of the nineteenth century,
while his second concert is sched
uled to include modern piano
works of such composers as Hin
demith, Petrassi, Bartok and Pro
kofiev.
This concluding concert will be
held tomorrow night in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium at 8:30 p.m.
In another Music Department
Summer Series, “The Sound and
Sense of Contemporary Music,”
Leo Smit, professor of music at
UCLA, gave a lecture last Mon
day afternoon in Dinkelspiel Aud
itorium on “The Masters Write
Jazz.”
CALLING the present musical
tradition one of “recomposition”
of both earlier and contemporary
forms, Smit noted that except for
Charles Ives, jazz was largely ig
nored by early American compos
ers and it had to be “discovered”
by such “non-native” ones as Mil
haud and Stravinski, and integrat
ed into their works.
The “masters” don’t actually
“write” jazz, says Smit, but “re
compose” it by transferring cer
tain of its elements into their own
style. Jazz used to refer not to a
type of music but to the speed or
enthusiasm that went into a per
formance, and, says Smit, “this
enthusiasm has not been lost on
modern composers of the twen
tieth century.”
