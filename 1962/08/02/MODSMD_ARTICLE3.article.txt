# Press Charged For Ignorance
## 
### KENT SMITH 
The concluding lecture of this
summer’s successful Tuesday Eve
ning Series was presented by
Stanley J. Stein, Professor of His
tory at Princeton University and
Visiting Professor to Stanford,
who examined “The Cuban Inva
sion of 1961”.
THE KEY to understanding the
Cuban situation, Stein said,” is
the understanding of “the other
side, the Cuban side”, the expla
nation of which is “noticeably ab
scent in American journalism”.
Americans are, stated Stein,
generally ignorant and confused
about Cuban history. We tend to
consider ourselves, he said, as
“warm, friendly, helpful, under
standing” neighbors; after all,
didn’t we free Cuba from the
Spanish tyranny and then, even
though we had full occupation,
didn’t we give Cubans independ
ence?
Cubans, however, by the spring
of 1959, could only view their his
tory as years of “deception, frus
tration and fairlure.” America,
in their eyes, had acted primarily
out of national self-interest, which
often conflicted with their deepest
asperations.
The blame for the ignorance of
the American public, Stein as
serts, must go to the national pop
ular press. Although informed
sources had known of the pre-in
vasion training camps months in
advance, the American press had
followed a policy of self-imposed
restraint in accordance with
C.I.A. wishes. In a free democ
racy supposedly dependent upon
an informed public, what is the
this deception of the people?
In making the choice whether
implication, Stein questioned, of
or not to go ahead with the Eisen
hower invasion plans, President
Kennedy, who has, according to
Stein, “an understanding of the
perspective of the U.S. Presi
dency”, had two historical alterna
tives: the Teddy Roosevelt policy
of unilateral intervention in Latin
America to attain national objec
tives or the Franklin Roosevelt
Good Neighbor Policy.
The Kennedy decision to aban
don the Good Neighbor image,
which promoted “the most succes
ful era of U.S.-Latin American
relations” has major implications
in the formulation of foreign pol
icy today. As Kennedy, himself,
said two days after the Cuban dis
aster, "This sobering episode
holds useful lessons for us all to
learn.”
