# Goldman Asserts Unity of 20's, 30's
## 
### DAN SCHWARTZ Acting Editor 
Last Monday, in his sixth speech
of the current series at Stanford
on the Maturing of the American
Civilization, Dr. Eric F. Goldman,
visiting professor of history from
Princeton University, attempted
to prove in his usual entertaining,
although not always conclusive,
style, that the 1920's and 30’s were
a continuous period in American
history.
Goldman began by emphasizing
the fact that the 20’s and 30’s are
traditionally regarded as two sep
arate periods in history. The 20’s
are usually considered the time of
the prosperous, of jazz and easy
life, and of Republicans.
THE 30’s, on the other hand, are
usually considered the time of de

pression, of poverty and govern
ment influence, and of Democrats.
There were, however, Goldman
said, a number of important con
cepts that were in effect during
both of these periods which served
to bring the two together.
He cited particularly the eco
nomic factors of unity.
THE FIRST of these, he felt,
was the sense that the American
economy ceased to be run on small
scale units, but had become an
economy of a national nature.
The second was the growing
concept that business did not exist
only to make money, but also had
the responsibility to attempt to
serve the public interest as well.
The third of the economic con
cepts that bound the periods to
gether was the flexibility of the
system of public welfare, and the
lack of any explicit control of
whether government or business
was to provide this welfare.
Another thing that has brought
about the idea of the separation
of the 20’s and the 30’s, said Gold
man, was the traditionally differ
ent stereotype of the presidents
of the time, Hoover and FDR.
HOOVER’S main fault, said
Goldman, was that he took the
slogans like "States rights” seri
ously. Any historian could have
told him, he said, that these slo
gans are simply things that are
used differently at different times
in different ways, which politi
cians use in arguements to get
their way.
Hoover, it should be remem
bered, Goldman said, had set up
the Trade Associations when he
was Secretary of Commerce,
which was intended to encourage

business to set certain standards
for itself.
FDR’s NRA, his first enact
ment, was intended to do exactly
the same thing, Goldman said.
