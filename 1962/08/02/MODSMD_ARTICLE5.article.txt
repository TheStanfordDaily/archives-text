# PACE Sends Out Call For Volunteer Workers
## 
### 
The Stanford PACE Program
has sent out the call for a large
number of urgently needed volun
teer workers to hand address the
80,000 invitations to Stanford
alumni, parents, and friends for
the series of dinners in October
and November to launch the
PACE Program general campaign
all across the country.
The $lOO million fund-raising
campaign has now passed the $46
million mark, with the biggest
push still to come.
Returns are already being felt

in improved faculty salaries, stu
dent aid and services, and an am
bitious building campaign all over
campus.
The project, in which the Ford
Foundation will match one dollar
for every three raised, over a five
year period, will also eventually
finance such things as a new un
dergraduate library, a new student
publications building, a new
School of Business building, and
additions to the undergraduate
dormitories.
Anyone wishing to help should
call DA 1-2300, Ex, 2292.
