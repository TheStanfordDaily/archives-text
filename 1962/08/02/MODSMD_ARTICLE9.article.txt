# New Name For School
## 
### 
As of September 1, 1962, Stan
ford’s School of Mineral Sciences
will officially become the School
of Earth Sciences. “The new name
has a much broader connotation,”
said Assistant Dean Ernest I. Rich,
in announcing the change.
“It is broad enough to include
biological aspects of geology and
such proposed programs as ocean
ography, palcomagnetism, and
several other areas that may be
developed in the future.
The School was founded as the
Department of Geology and Min
ing by Dr. John Casper Branner,
Stanford’s second president, after
he became a member of the origi
nal Stanford faculty in 1892.
