# Hoover Institution Grows With Gifts
## 
### 
Private gifts and pledges total
ling $2 million have been received
by the Hoover Institute at Stan
ford for an enlarged program of
research on international com
munism and related topics, Insti
tute Director W. Glenn Campbell
announced last week.

The funds, obtained during the
past three years, currently sup
port studies of the Chinese Com
munist economy, Chinese pene
tration in Africa, development of
the Communist International, and
preparation of teaching material
on communism for college, high
school, and adult education
groups.
A HISTORY of Chinese Com
munism and a study of the world
communist movement are now in
the planning stage, Campbell told
the summer meeting of the Insti
tution’s Advisory Board.

“We feel that we now have the
most comprehensive program of
studies of communism and re
lated revolutionary movements to
be found in any American univer
sity,” he said.

“Our holdings on the Russian
and Chinese revolutions and the
growth and spread of commu
nism throughout the world are
generally considered the outstand
ing collection in this field in the
Western world. This collection
serves the needs of scholarship
by providing indispensible source

material for study and research.”
STARTED IN 1919, when Her
bert Hoover offered $50,000 to
Stanford “for an historical collec
tion on the Great War,” the In
stitution’s library of current ma
terials on political, social, and
economic trends of the 20th Cen
tury today are valued at more
than $25 million.
Principal acquisitions of the
Hoover Institution during the
past year were the Confidential
Prints on Africa of the British
Foreign Office and Colonial Of
fice, described as the most valu
able single source on African af
fairs in this country, and micro
film copies of the Chen Cheng
collection.
THIS COLLECTION, never be
fore available to Western schol
ars, includes more than 1,000 doc
| uments concerning the Chinese
Soviet Republic from 1931 to 1934.
In his Board report, Campbell
noted that publications of his
staff during the past year have
included a three-volume history
of “The Russian Provisional
Government, 1917,” and separate
books on “White Settlers in Afri
ca,” “The French Fifth Republic,”
and “A Forward Strategy for
America.”
To date, more than 65 books
have been published by the Stan
ford University Press and others,
reporting the findings of Hoover
I scholars.
