## 'Deathwatch' Called Play Of 'Rare Quality'-One' Of the Best of Summer' 
### PETER LYMAN Managing Editor 
Contemporary theatre is inter
esting to see because of the com
munication of new ideas and
views of the world. Beckett, Al
bee, Simpson and Genet each
have had something to say. This
quality is not, however, unique to
contemporary theatre.
What distinguishes this new
theatre is a new use of a mode
of communication unique to the
I stage. This mode, personal com
munication between actor and au
dience, is lost in the impersonal,
whether book, films, television or
large stage.

THE MODERN writers pre
sented by the Contemporary
Theatre Workshop have used the
personal communication of the
stage in new ways. Beckett in
“Happy Days” most creatively
showed how experimentation
with “meaning” and reliance up
on freeing the quality of the
stage could better express his
ideas. As the impressionist paint
ers changed painting techniques
to express their personal under
standing, modern theatre has new
techniques for new ideas.
The Stanford Players have
taken advantage of the new free
dom the playwrights have given
the theatre. The use of “The Out
er Circle” did much to reduce the
distance between the play and au
dience, not only physically, for
in cutting physical distance one
can gain greatly in the individual
expression of a role. The Players’
“Deathwatch” is as personal and
meaningful to an audience as pos
sible in a non-spontaneous situ
ation.

ONE COULD NOT feel like an
audience. First because the play
completely ignores the presence
of an audience. Secondly, the
quality of the production, one is
so present, so involved, and
knows the characters so well, he
must be engaged. Needless to say
the cast, staff, and director are
responsible for meeting the chal
lenge of freedom.

Green Eyes takes the center, as
Genet’s character and as Juris
Scendsen, the actor. He is an im
pressing actor with an imposing
manner. His dance, Green Eyes’
attempt to sublimate fate, is mag
netic and savage. Wherever it
came from, the play, the director
James Kerans, the actor Juris
Svendsen, or all combined, it
seemed spontaneous and sprung
from the most primitive and ar
chetypal drives. Svendsen created
a performance worthy of any
stage.

MICHAEL LEIBERT as Jules
Lefranc, a lesser character, is an
excellent complement to Green
Eyes. In many ways his is a dif-1
ficult part, since the development
of the play centers about Jules’
character.
The third member of the trio,
David Garfield as Maurice, play
ed a dislikable character. His per
formance was not up to Juris
Svendsen but he certainly played
a strong antagonist.
James Kerans directed both
“Deathwatch’ and “Happy Days,”
the two most successful produc
j tions of the summer. Both per
formances were marked by ex
cellent acting and coherent pro
duction. A director’s effort is no
better than his material, but the
reverse is also true, and Mr. Ker
ans and his productions mutually
enhance each other.

GENET’S IDEAS are nearly
overwhelmed by the production,
not an uncommon occurance in
contemporary theatre. Some feel
that intellectual content is not
necessary to the new theatre, that
the expression suffices, but not
only history but the plays them

selves indicate otherwise.
Genet, very much like Sartre,
is investigating the relationship
of status and identity to the view
of others. Three men in a prison
cell are involved in a hierarchy of
status, formed of each one’s view
of the others. Green Eyes is on
top because he is, by fate, a mur
derer. Jules aspires to the top
but hasn’t the touch, and doesn't
understand that something more
than the murder Green Eyes
committed is the source of status.
Green Eyes believes that the qual
j ity ennobling him is that he didn’t
want the murder, but was a tool
of fate. Maurice is the element
that develops the chasm between
Jules and Green Eyes by forcing
them to reveal themselves.
“DEATHWATCH” is exciting
from all aspects. It is violent, and
if contrary to some sensibilities,
violence is not here a phony de
vice. If Genet ignores the audi
ence, it is a gamble to be paid on
the quality of the production. And
“Deathwatch” is a production of
rare quality.

er Circle” did much to reduce the
distance between the play and au
dience, not only physically, for
in cutting physical distance one
can gain greatly in the individual
expression of a role. The Players’
“Deathwatch” is as personal and
meaningful to an audience as pos
sible in a non-spontaneous situ
ation.

ONE COULD NOT feel like an
audience. First because the play
completely ignores the presence
of an audience. Secondly, the
quality of the production, one is
so present, so involved, and
knows the characters so well, he
must be engaged. Needless to say
the cast, staff, and director are
responsible for meeting the chal
lenge of freedom.

Green Eyes takes the center, as
Genet’s character and as Juris
Scendsen, the actor. He is an im
pressing actor with an imposing
manner. His dance, Green Eyes’
attempt to sublimate fate, is mag
netic and savage. Wherever it
came from, the play, the director
James Kerans, the actor Juris
Svendsen, or all combined, it
seemed spontaneous and sprung
from the most primitive and ar
chetypal drives. Svendsen created
a performance worthy of any
stage.

MICHAEL LEIBERT as Jules
Lefranc, a lesser character, is an
excellent complement to Green
Eyes. In many ways his is a dif-1
ficult part, since the development
of the play centers about Jules’
character.
The third member of the trio,
David Garfield as Maurice, play
ed a dislikable character. His per
formance was not up to Juris
Svendsen but he certainly played
a strong antagonist.
James Kerans directed both
“Deathwatch’ and “Happy Days,”
the two most successful produc
j tions of the summer. Both per
formances were marked by ex
cellent acting and coherent pro
duction. A director’s effort is no
better than his material, but the
reverse is also true, and Mr. Ker
ans and his productions mutually
enhance each other.

GENET’S IDEAS are nearly
overwhelmed by the production,
not an uncommon occurance in
contemporary theatre. Some feel
that intellectual content is not
necessary to the new theatre, that
the expression suffices, but not
only history but the plays them

selves indicate otherwise.
Genet, very much like Sartre,
is investigating the relationship
of status and identity to the view
of others. Three men in a prison
cell are involved in a hierarchy of
status, formed of each one’s view
of the others. Green Eyes is on
top because he is, by fate, a mur
derer. Jules aspires to the top
but hasn’t the touch, and doesn't
understand that something more
than the murder Green Eyes
committed is the source of status.
Green Eyes believes that the qual
j ity ennobling him is that he didn’t
want the murder, but was a tool
of fate. Maurice is the element
that develops the chasm between
Jules and Green Eyes by forcing
them to reveal themselves.
“DEATHWATCH” is exciting
from all aspects. It is violent, and
if contrary to some sensibilities,
violence is not here a phony de
vice. If Genet ignores the audi
ence, it is a gamble to be paid on
the quality of the production. And
“Deathwatch” is a production of
rare quality.
Contemporary theatre is inter
esting to see because of the com
munication of new ideas and
views of the world. Beckett, Al
bee, Simpson and Genet each
have had something to say. This
quality is not, however, unique to
contemporary theatre.
What distinguishes this new
theatre is a new use of a mode
of communication unique to the
I stage. This mode, personal com
munication between actor and au
dience, is lost in the impersonal,
whether book, films, television or
large stage.

THE MODERN writers pre
sented by the Contemporary
Theatre Workshop have used the
personal communication of the
stage in new ways. Beckett in
“Happy Days” most creatively
showed how experimentation
with “meaning” and reliance up
on freeing the quality of the
stage could better express his
ideas. As the impressionist paint
ers changed painting techniques
to express their personal under
standing, modern theatre has new
techniques for new ideas.

chetypal drives. Svendsen created
a performance worthy of any
stage.

MICHAEL LEIBERT as Jules
Lefranc, a lesser character, is an
excellent complement to Green
Eyes. In many ways his is a dif-1
ficult part, since the development
of the play centers about Jules’
character.
The third member of the trio,
David Garfield as Maurice, play
ed a dislikable character. His per
formance was not up to Juris
Svendsen but he certainly played
a strong antagonist.
James Kerans directed both
“Deathwatch’ and “Happy Days,”
the two most successful produc
j tions of the summer. Both per
formances were marked by ex
cellent acting and coherent pro
duction. A director’s effort is no
better than his material, but the
reverse is also true, and Mr. Ker
ans and his productions mutually
enhance each other.

GENET’S IDEAS are nearly
overwhelmed by the production,
not an uncommon occurance in
contemporary theatre. Some feel
that intellectual content is not
necessary to the new theatre, that
the expression suffices, but not
only history but the plays them

selves indicate otherwise.
Genet, very much like Sartre,
is investigating the relationship
of status and identity to the view
of others. Three men in a prison
cell are involved in a hierarchy of
status, formed of each one’s view
of the others. Green Eyes is on
top because he is, by fate, a mur
derer. Jules aspires to the top
but hasn’t the touch, and doesn't
understand that something more
than the murder Green Eyes
committed is the source of status.
Green Eyes believes that the qual
j ity ennobling him is that he didn’t
want the murder, but was a tool
of fate. Maurice is the element
that develops the chasm between
Jules and Green Eyes by forcing
them to reveal themselves.
“DEATHWATCH” is exciting
from all aspects. It is violent, and
if contrary to some sensibilities,
violence is not here a phony de
vice. If Genet ignores the audi
ence, it is a gamble to be paid on
the quality of the production. And
“Deathwatch” is a production of
rare quality.
Contemporary theatre is inter
esting to see because of the com
munication of new ideas and
views of the world. Beckett, Al
bee, Simpson and Genet each
have had something to say. This
quality is not, however, unique to
contemporary theatre.
What distinguishes this new
theatre is a new use of a mode
of communication unique to the
I stage. This mode, personal com
munication between actor and au
dience, is lost in the impersonal,
whether book, films, television or
large stage.

THE MODERN writers pre
sented by the Contemporary
Theatre Workshop have used the
personal communication of the
stage in new ways. Beckett in
“Happy Days” most creatively
showed how experimentation
with “meaning” and reliance up
on freeing the quality of the
stage could better express his
ideas. As the impressionist paint
ers changed painting techniques
to express their personal under
standing, modern theatre has new
techniques for new ideas.
The Stanford Players have
taken advantage of the new free
dom the playwrights have given
the theatre. The use of “The Out
er Circle” did much to reduce the
distance between the play and au
dience, not only physically, for
in cutting physical distance one
can gain greatly in the individual
expression of a role. The Players’
“Deathwatch” is as personal and
meaningful to an audience as pos
sible in a non-spontaneous situ
ation.

ONE COULD NOT feel like an
audience. First because the play
completely ignores the presence
of an audience. Secondly, the
quality of the production, one is
so present, so involved, and
knows the characters so well, he
must be engaged. Needless to say
the cast, staff, and director are
responsible for meeting the chal
lenge of freedom.

Green Eyes takes the center, as
Genet’s character and as Juris
Scendsen, the actor. He is an im
pressing actor with an imposing
manner. His dance, Green Eyes’
attempt to sublimate fate, is mag
netic and savage. Wherever it
came from, the play, the director
James Kerans, the actor Juris
Svendsen, or all combined, it
seemed spontaneous and sprung
from the most primitive and ar
chetypal drives. Svendsen created
a performance worthy of any
stage.
