### KENT SMITH 
Ralph Richardson, candidate
for State Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction, spoke here August
1 at a luncheon sponsored by Phi
Delta Kappa, National Men’s
Honorary Fraternity in Educa
tion. Professor Richardson is past
President of Los Angeles Coun
ty’s Board of Education.
Speaking on “Education: The
Issues, The Challenge, The Plat
form,” Richardson said that we
must have “sufficient confidence
in our teachers” to treat the dan
ger of Communism “through edu

cation, not indoctrination.”
“IN CONTRAST to my oppo
nent,” said Richardson of Max
Rafferty (a frequent platform
speaker with Conservative Joseph
Shell), whose position is charac
terized by “zenophobia and chau
vinism, begotten of fear, vanity |
and arrogance, I want a patriot- 1
ism which seeks to improve as
well as protect and defend.”
Richardson, heralding “the new
[ era of promise,” called for more
research programs and new tech
niques, like team teaching and
educational TV. Describing him
self as “dedicated to developing
in each child the fundamental
skills,” the candidate attacked
Rafferty's “centering on the gift
ed elite.”
I IN ADDITION to “getting the
people of California excited about
excellence and quality,” Richard
son concluded that it was Educa
tion’s job in California “to build
from that which is good to that
which is great.”
