# WW II Changes Feelings About Policies: Goldman
## 
### DAN SCHWARTZ Acting Editor 
“Historians will look back at
Warld War II as producing the
same type of phenomena that
World War I produced,” said Dr.
Eric F. Goldman, visiting pro
fessor of history from Princeton
University, last night in Cubber
ley in the seventh speech of his
series here.
“The same domestic compro
mises were carried out, with the
move of the Negro and the immi
grant into the compromises made
five times faster by the war.”
In his speech, entitled “Truman
and Eisenhower; Consolidation
on the World War II Decisions,”
Goldman first showed the change
of feeling that existed in the coun- j
try during World War 11.
FROM THE START of the war
until 1943, the main feeling was
one of isolationism. The old idea
of simply getting the war over
and getting home prevailed.
It was not, at first, a war of
idealism, or of great change mak
ing, but one of the traditionally
quick and simple solutions, and
everything returned to how it
used to be.
However, Goldman said, due in
great part to the writings and
work of FDR’s close friend Wen
dell Willkie (even though they
had just run against each other

in the last election), the feeling
slowly changed in the country to
one of “positive warfare.”
THE COUNTRY changed to the
feeling that FDR had always fa
vored, that this was a “war
against Fascism, rather than just
j a defensive war.”
The feelings that the war lost
its purpose unless a new world
was created, and the feeling of
the domestic policies on the for
eign policies, also grew.
Three other important decisions
came out of the war.
The first was the continuing
development of the domestic com
promises and the larger inclusion
of the Negro and the immigrant
in them.
The second was the idea of the
eventual all out struggle against
imperialism.
And the third, said Goldman,
was the idea of the continuous at
tempt to gain lasting peace for
the world, and the necessity of
holding talks —which might cause
compromise—with the Russians.
TRUMAN and Eisenhower,
Goldman said, will be remember
ed as “near great” presidents,
not because of anything they par
ticularly did, but because they
finally, both after “conservative”
starts, had “sense enough to not
stand in the way of the inevitable
flow of feeling in the country.”

THOUGH seemingly another
Progressive Education controver
sy, this campaign, so often a
colorless affair before, has gained
new meaning. Since there is no
incumbent to be routinely re
elected, “there is,” as Richardson
points out, “no precedent to fol
low.”
Into this unexpected vacuum
the forces of Liberalism and Con
servatism in California have
moved to do battle. But why have
thousands of dollars been thrown
into state-wide organizations bat-!
tling for this non-partisan posi
tion?
First, there two traditional en
emies now split California much
more deeply than generally re
alized. Second, the office has be
come a key objective in the in
tensifying struggle between the
two ideologies, not because of its
admittedly small political influ
ence. but because of the Superin
tendent’s supposed power over
curricula and young minds.
THAT THE growing ideological
battle has spread into Public Ed
ucation, once a traditional area of
agreement an d compromise,
sharply spotlights the widening
breach in California and exempli
fies a trend of crucial significance
here and nationally.
