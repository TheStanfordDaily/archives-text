The Stanford Player’s Contem
porary Theatre Workshop pre
sents Bertolt Brecht’s anti-war
satire “Man Is Man” as the last
of its summer series of modern
theatre. The play, under the di
rection of Broadway director
Alan Schneider, will open in Me
morial Theatre at Stanford on

Friday evening at 8:40, August
10, and continue August 11 and
12.

Written early in Brecht’s ca
reer. the play has its setting in a
combination of Rudyard Kipling’s
India and a vaudeville-type India
in the 1920’5.
THE COMIC PLAY centers on
a squad of restless, drunk sol
diers who loot a Tibetan temple
and lose one of their members in
the process. Unable to return to
their headquarters without the
missing soldier, they convince
Galy Gay, a gentle and timid
handyman, to join them and then
proceed to make him over into a
fighting warrior.

Du© to the overwhelming
influence of things like Fi
nals, and the tremendous
amount o r time which such
activity must demand (not
mer' itng the even more
o whelming lack of funds),
*he Weekly sadly, but not
without a sigh of relief, must
announce that this is Its last
edition for this Summer
Quarter.


THE WIDOW BEGBICK (JoAnne Akalaitis) playfully carries G' , Gay
(Stanley Weese) in a scene from Brecht’s “Man Is Man," to play here
August 10,11 and 12.
