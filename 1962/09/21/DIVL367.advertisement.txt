ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR
With today’s entry I begin my ninth year of writing columns
in your school newspaper for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes.
Nine years, I believe you will agree, is a long time. In fact,
it took only a little longer than nine years to dig the Suez
Canal, and you know what a gigantic undertaking that was!
To bo sure, the work would have gone more rapidly had the
shovel been invented at that time, but, as w'e all know, the
shovel was not invented until 1940 by Walter 11. Shovel of
Cleveland, Ohio. Before Mr. Shovel’s discovery in 1940, all
digging was done with sugar tongs—a method unquestionably
dainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, natu
rally, many efforts made to speed up digging before Mr. Shovel’s
breakthrough—notably an attempt in 1912 by the immortal
Thomas Alva Edison to dig with the phonograph, but the only
thing that happened was that he got his horn full of sand. This
so depressed Mr. Edison that he fell into a fit of melancholy
from which he did not emerge until two years later when his
friend William Wordsworth, the eminent nature poet, cheered
him up by imitating a duck for four and a half hours.
But I digress. For nine years, I say, I have been writing this
column for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and for nine
years they have been paying me money. You are shocked. You
think that anyone who has tasted Marlboro’s unparalleled
flavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro’s filter, who has revelled in
Marlboro’s jolly red and white pack or box should be more than
willing to w rite about Marlboro without a penny’s compensa
tion. You are wrong.
Compensation is the very foundation stone of the American
Way of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system
absolutely requires that you be paid for it. For example, I
have a friend named Hex Glebe, a veterinarian by profession,
who simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up
and say, “Hey, Hex, let’s go bowl a few lines,” or “Hey, Rex,
let’s go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,” and he
will always reply, “No, thanks. I better stay here in case
somebody wants a dog wormed.” I mean there is not one thing
in the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than
worming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worm
ing your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do other
wise would be to rend, possibly irreparably, the fabric of
democracy.
It’s the same with me and Marlboro Cigarettes. I think
Marlboro's flavor represents the pinnacle of the tobacconist's
art. I think Marlboro’s filter represents the pinnacle of the
filter-maker’s art. 1 think Marlboro’s pack and box represent
the pinnacle of the packager’s art. I think Marlboro is a pleas
ure and a treasure, and 1 fairly burst with pride that 1 have
been chosen to speak for Marlboro on your campus. All the
same, I want my money every week. And the makers of
Marlboro understand this full well. They don’t like it, but they
understand it.
In the columns which follow (his opening installment, I will
turn the hot white light of truth on the pressing problems of
campus life—the many and varied dilemmas which beset the
undergraduate—burning questions like “Should Chaucer class
rooms be converted to parking garages?” and “Should proctors
be given a saliva test?” and “Should foreign exchange students
be held for ransom?”
And in these columns, while grappling with the crises that
vex campus America, I will make occasional brief mention of
Marlboro Cigarettes. If 1 do not, the makers will not give me
any money. e w«a m»» siminuui
The makers ol Marlboro will bring gnu this unccnsorcd,
free-stgle column 26 times throughout the school gear. Dur
ing this period it is not unlikely that Old Max will step on
some toes —principally ours—but wc think it’s all in fun and
we hope you will 100.

ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR
With today’s entry I begin my ninth year of writing columns
in your school newspaper for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes.
Nine years, I believe you will agree, is a long time. In fact,
it took only a little longer than nine years to dig the Suez
Canal, and you know what a gigantic undertaking that was!
To bo sure, the work would have gone more rapidly had the
shovel been invented at that time, but, as w'e all know, the
shovel was not invented until 1940 by Walter 11. Shovel of
Cleveland, Ohio. Before Mr. Shovel’s discovery in 1940, all
digging was done with sugar tongs—a method unquestionably
dainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, natu
rally, many efforts made to speed up digging before Mr. Shovel’s
breakthrough—notably an attempt in 1912 by the immortal
Thomas Alva Edison to dig with the phonograph, but the only
thing that happened was that he got his horn full of sand. This
so depressed Mr. Edison that he fell into a fit of melancholy
from which he did not emerge until two years later when his
friend William Wordsworth, the eminent nature poet, cheered
him up by imitating a duck for four and a half hours.
But I digress. For nine years, I say, I have been writing this
column for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and for nine
years they have been paying me money. You are shocked. You
think that anyone who has tasted Marlboro’s unparalleled
flavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro’s filter, who has revelled in
Marlboro’s jolly red and white pack or box should be more than
willing to w rite about Marlboro without a penny’s compensa
tion. You are wrong.
Compensation is the very foundation stone of the American
Way of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system
absolutely requires that you be paid for it. For example, I
have a friend named Hex Glebe, a veterinarian by profession,
who simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up
and say, “Hey, Hex, let’s go bowl a few lines,” or “Hey, Rex,
let’s go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,” and he
will always reply, “No, thanks. I better stay here in case
somebody wants a dog wormed.” I mean there is not one thing
in the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than
worming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worm
ing your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do other
wise would be to rend, possibly irreparably, the fabric of
democracy.

flavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro’s filter, who has revelled in
Marlboro’s jolly red and white pack or box should be more than
willing to w rite about Marlboro without a penny’s compensa
tion. You are wrong.
Compensation is the very foundation stone of the American
Way of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system
absolutely requires that you be paid for it. For example, I
have a friend named Hex Glebe, a veterinarian by profession,
who simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up
and say, “Hey, Hex, let’s go bowl a few lines,” or “Hey, Rex,
let’s go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,” and he
will always reply, “No, thanks. I better stay here in case
somebody wants a dog wormed.” I mean there is not one thing
in the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than
worming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worm
ing your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do other
wise would be to rend, possibly irreparably, the fabric of
democracy.
It’s the same with me and Marlboro Cigarettes. I think
Marlboro's flavor represents the pinnacle of the tobacconist's
art. I think Marlboro’s filter represents the pinnacle of the
filter-maker’s art. 1 think Marlboro’s pack and box represent
the pinnacle of the packager’s art. I think Marlboro is a pleas
ure and a treasure, and 1 fairly burst with pride that 1 have
been chosen to speak for Marlboro on your campus. All the
same, I want my money every week. And the makers of
Marlboro understand this full well. They don’t like it, but they
understand it.
In the columns which follow (his opening installment, I will
turn the hot white light of truth on the pressing problems of
campus life—the many and varied dilemmas which beset the
undergraduate—burning questions like “Should Chaucer class
rooms be converted to parking garages?” and “Should proctors
be given a saliva test?” and “Should foreign exchange students
be held for ransom?”
And in these columns, while grappling with the crises that
vex campus America, I will make occasional brief mention of
Marlboro Cigarettes. If 1 do not, the makers will not give me
any money. e w«a m»» siminuui
The makers ol Marlboro will bring gnu this unccnsorcd,
free-stgle column 26 times throughout the school gear. Dur
ing this period it is not unlikely that Old Max will step on
some toes —principally ours—but wc think it’s all in fun and
we hope you will 100.
