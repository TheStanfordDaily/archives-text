Does that sound like a come-oh? It is. It’s an Invita
tion to come on and join tiie many who are already
richer because they read The New York Times regu
larly.
Starting October 1, The New York Times will be
available on campus for the first time. A Western
Edition will be printed in Los Angeles every week
day morning simultaneously with the New York edi
tion—and delivered to you the same day—for only
10c a copy.
You’ll find The New York Times a wonderful way to
enrich your college days and studies—because The
New York Times is richer in the news and informa
tion it supplies you about Washington, national and
world affairs—as well as the world of sports, fash
ions, entertainment and the arts.
You'll find your conversation richer, your under
standing deeper, your chances brighter to achieve
the goals you set for yourself. See your campus rep
resentative today to enjoy convenient delivery of
The New York Times throughout the academic year.
Starting October 1
