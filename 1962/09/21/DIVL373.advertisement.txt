New PARKER ARROW
m
You can buy an ordinary cartridge pen for a dollar
and even get a couple of cartridges thrown in free.
But, then you pay and pay and pay. This pen can
save you up to 20c every time you buy cartridges.
You get five BIG Parker Quink cartridges for only
29C- But, even if you didn't save a dime, this pen
would be worth the extra price. It's a Parker.
Only Parker gives you a solid 14K gold point,
tipped with plathenium one of the hardest,
smoothest alloys ever developed. It should last you
for years no matter how much you use it.
This pen won't leak the way the cheap ones do
it has a built-in safety reservoir. It must meet most
of the tough specifications we set for $lO pens.
The Parker Arrow comes in black, dark blue,
light blue, light grey and bright red. You get a
choice of four instantly replaceable points: extra
fine, fine, medium, broad.
