ON MATURING
Here's a Stanford tradition that will be of interest to girls new to the
University. A Stanford "girl doesn t become a Stanford 'woman''
until she has been kissed by a Stanford man (should be a senior)
at midnight during a full moon on inner quad. The experience of
being bombed by water balloons heaved by freshman men at the
romantic couples ought to mature any female.
