# PACE Has Almost Reached Mid Point

### DEAN SAVAGE 
The Stanford PACE program,
Stanford’s $lOO million Plan of
Action for a Challenging Era, is
about halfway to its goal. Accord
ing to the PACE Report for Sep
tember the total exceeded $49 mil
lion at press time in August,
PACE officials wore hopeful that
the mark would be reached by the
end of the fiscal year, August 31.
Exact totals will bo formally an
nounced at a two-day campus con
ference this weekend.
PACE, called the “boldest ven
ture” in Stanford’s history by
President Wallace Sterling, is the
result of a $25-million incentive
grant from the Ford Foundation
in Sept. 1960. In the largest unre
stricted matching grant ever
made to an educational institu
tion. Ford offered to furnish $1
for each $3 the University is able
to raise from other private
sources. The grant runs until
Sept. 1965, or until the other $75
million is raised. Stanford, which
was algeady planning a capital
campaign when the Ford offer
was received, announced in April
1961 that it would attempt to
raise the money in three years.
The drive was formally launched
on April 18, 1961, slightly more
than 16 months ago.
High costs and larger enroll
ments, problems for all institu
tions of higher learning, are par
ticularly serious for non-tax-sup
ported institutions. At Stanford,
tuition pays only about half the
cost of each student’s education.
Straight operating expenses alone
exceed $25 million per year. De
spite a reputation for being richly
endowed, Stanford ranks only
33rd in the nation in endowment
income per student.
THUS far the building program
is the most tangible result of the
PACE program. PACE funds
helped complete Tresidder Me
morial Union and have assured
McCullough Engineering Bldg.,
the new Stauffer Chemistry Bldg,
and renovations in the engineer
ing labs. Before the campaign
ends PACE officials expect funds
to bo available for a new under
graduate library, new Graduate
School of Business, and more
space for the Humanities and Sci
ences on Quad. The whole front
of Outer Quad will be I’emodeled.
Eventually PACE will mean a
better faculty-student ratio, a
greater number of distinguished
names on the faculty, and in
creased opportunity for students
to come in contact with minds of
top academic quality, as well as
new study programs and better
classroom and lab facilities.
About 100 PACE Regional Cam
paign chairmen from all over the
nation are here this weekend for

briefing on the coming intensive
phase of the campaign. Seventy
three no-host dinners in as many
cities are planned for October and
November, to recruit volunteers
for person-to-person presentation
of Stanford’s needs to more than
75,000 alumni and other friends of
the University.

classroom and lab facilities.
About 100 PACE Regional Cam
paign chairmen from all over the
nation are here this weekend for

briefing on the coming intensive
phase of the campaign. Seventy
three no-host dinners in as many
cities are planned for October and
November, to recruit volunteers
for person-to-person presentation
of Stanford’s needs to more than
75,000 alumni and other friends of
the University.
The Stanford PACE program,
Stanford’s $lOO million Plan of
Action for a Challenging Era, is
about halfway to its goal. Accord
ing to the PACE Report for Sep
tember the total exceeded $49 mil
lion at press time in August,
PACE officials wore hopeful that
the mark would be reached by the
end of the fiscal year, August 31.
Exact totals will bo formally an
nounced at a two-day campus con
ference this weekend.
PACE, called the “boldest ven
ture” in Stanford’s history by
President Wallace Sterling, is the
result of a $25-million incentive
grant from the Ford Foundation
in Sept. 1960. In the largest unre
stricted matching grant ever
made to an educational institu
tion. Ford offered to furnish $1
for each $3 the University is able
to raise from other private
sources. The grant runs until
Sept. 1965, or until the other $75
million is raised. Stanford, which
was algeady planning a capital
campaign when the Ford offer
was received, announced in April
1961 that it would attempt to
raise the money in three years.
The drive was formally launched
on April 18, 1961, slightly more
than 16 months ago.
High costs and larger enroll
ments, problems for all institu
tions of higher learning, are par
ticularly serious for non-tax-sup
ported institutions. At Stanford,
tuition pays only about half the
cost of each student’s education.
Straight operating expenses alone
exceed $25 million per year. De
spite a reputation for being richly
endowed, Stanford ranks only
33rd in the nation in endowment
income per student.
THUS far the building program
is the most tangible result of the
PACE program. PACE funds
helped complete Tresidder Me
morial Union and have assured
McCullough Engineering Bldg.,
the new Stauffer Chemistry Bldg,
and renovations in the engineer
ing labs. Before the campaign
ends PACE officials expect funds
to bo available for a new under
graduate library, new Graduate
School of Business, and more
space for the Humanities and Sci
ences on Quad. The whole front
of Outer Quad will be I’emodeled.
Eventually PACE will mean a
better faculty-student ratio, a
greater number of distinguished
names on the faculty, and in
creased opportunity for students
to come in contact with minds of
top academic quality, as well as
new study programs and better
classroom and lab facilities.
