Stanford is a unique university. Lest tin’s be taken as a mean
ingless truism, consider bow many times Stanford has been called
the Harvard of the West, the Dartmouth of the West, or the
Princeton of the West. But who has ever heard of a Princeton
woman and who would confuse John Harvard with a robber
baron like behind Stanford?
Doubtless Stanford aspires to many of the distinctions of its
Eastern counterparts, but aspiring to similar distinction is not
aspiring to copy all the institutions of another university. Stanford
is engaged in selective imitation: trying, for instance, to establish
the tradition of academic freedom synonymous with Harvard, re
jecting the social caste system prevalent at universities where
fraternities or eating clubs dominate the campus.
Whatever the present success of Stanford in anv of these en
deavors, the trend at Stanford over the past twenty years seems to
be toward realizing the goals of educational liberalism.
Ten years ago political speakers could not appear on the cam
pus because Mrs. Stanford decreed in 1902 that “the university
shall forever be kept out of politics.” The University finally suc
ceeded in having the legal interpretation of this pronouncement
changed. But even today the Young Republicans and the Young
Democrats are not allowed to function on campus. Moreover,
the Forum for the Discussion of Non-violent Alternatives to War
is prohibited from functioning autonomously because the Univer
sity considers the Forum to be a “partisan, political group.” At
Harvard these prohibitions would be considered absurd and even
irresponsible. Perhaps in ten years these prohibitions will be con
sidered in the same light at Stanford. Perhaps not, if students are
unwilling to press the University.
