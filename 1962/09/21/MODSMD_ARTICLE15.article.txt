# A 						Look Forward
## 
### 
In tlie next few days and weeks several campus events and
issues of last year are going to reappear in the form of trustees*
decisions, administration decisions, student and faculty actions,
and Daily articles. Liquor regulations, a Communist youth festival,
the National Student Association and a $lOO-million fund drive
have dominated and may continue to dominate the news.
Last spring in a campus referendum, students approved a by
law amendment to the ASSU Constitution restricting the liquor
jurisdiction of student judicial councils to violations of state law.
In a letter to undergraduates this week. Dean of Students H.
Donald Winhigler reported that in July “the Trustees voted to
continue Stanford's long-standing policy prohibiting the possession
and use of alcoholic beverages by students (of any age) on the
University campus. The Dean’s Office has announced its intention
to enforce liquor rules even if student councils do not. The legal
questions are whether state law allows minors to drink in a private
place like the Stanford campus and whether students voting last
spring believed that, therefore, minors would be able to drink here
without prosecution by the student judiciary. Tomorrow morning
President Sterling will announce the results of a review by the
trustees of their July dictum. The student Legislature will not be
able to clear up the ambiguity of the by-law until it meets next
Thursday.
The Helsinki World Youth Festival, a Communist-organized
propaganda show, was attended by 33 Stanford students this past
summer. Despite last-minute difficulties in finding money to
finance their participation, the group departed at the end of July
for the ten-day festival. Their purpose was to represent objectively
the American viewpoint in world affairs to both Communist and
uncommitted neutral delegates. Contrary to what some people
predicted, the Stanford group did not become dupes of the Com
munists but instead played an effective role in correcting miscon
ceptions about the U.S. and U.S. policy.
In another campus referendum last May Stanford voted to join
the National Student Association (NSA) representing 400 Ameri
can colleges and universities, both the University and the Legis
lature of the Associated Students of Stanford University (LASSU)
provided money to help pay the expenses of nine Stanford students
to the NSA’s summer congress at Ohio State. The summer con
gress passed a number of resolutions on nuclear testing, the Me-
Carren Act, and other issues affecting students. Certain ultracon
servative students charged last spring that NSA was a leftist or
possibly subversive group and that Stanford ought not to join.
Supporters of NSA denied the first charge and disproved the
second while pointing to the benefits of establishing intercourse
with other American universities represented in NSA. Reports at
LASSU and in The Daily will clarify the political position of the
NSA, and the course of events will determine whether contact
with other universities merits spending $2OO in student money.
Last and probably most important of the events last year was
the continuation of the $lOO-million fund drive to support Univer
sity’ programs for expansion and improvement. The drive is known
as the Plan of Action for a Challenging Era (PACE). PACE has
now raised $49 million and has until June, 1965, to raise $5l mil
lion more. At that time the Ford Foundation matching grant of
$25 million expires; until then, the University receives from Ford
one dollar for every three it raises by itself so that the University
must raise $75 million to collect the $25 million from Ford and
thereby successfully complete the $lOO-million drive. Money’
from PACE is raising faculty salaries, increasing student aid pro
grams and building a score of new buildings. However, at times
The Daily has pointed out some of the; dangers inherent in raising
money’ without compromising academic freedom.
