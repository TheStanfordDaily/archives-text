## U.S. Cannot Strengthen Policy On Cuba Without Act of War 
### 
Although there are some who
say that we are doing nothing
about Cuba, the fact is that we
are doing just about everything
that can be done short of going
to w’ar. Besides the economic em
bargo we are keeping the island
under “surveillance.” We are
watching every ship that comes to
and goes from the siland, and we
are keeping a close watch on the
loading and unloading of these
ships. We have accurate and cur
rent records of building opera
tions and the deployment of air
craft and tanks and artillery.
There may be some doubt
whether we have located every
missile site in the vastness of the
Soviet Union. But in Cuba, unless
our cameras are failing us, we are
completely informed.
As a result we ai’e quite able
to know about the development of
anything like a Soviet missile
base directed against the United
States, and what may be more
realistic, we are able to spot any
thing like an expeditionary force
against Cubas’ neighbors in the
islands and in the Caribbean.
OUR POLICY at the present is
to keep ourselves completely in
formed, and to wait and see
whether Castro and his Soviet
helpers do any overt act against
the United States or its neighbors.
Beyond this, there is no serious
action the United States can take
to remove him which would not
be an act of war. The United
States is, of course, able easily to
blockade Cuba. But stopping
ships under threat of seizure or
sinking would be an act of war
not only against Cuba but against
the Soviet Union. For we would
be seizing or sinking Soviet ships.
The invasion of Cuba would, of
course, be an act of war against
Cuba. To he sure, the United
States could easily win a war
against Cuba. We could close the
Cuban ports within a few hours
and we could occupy very quickly
Havana and a few big cities.
The countryside might be an
other story. But what we could
not be sure of doing is to prevent
the retaliatory moves to which
we would have laid ourselves
wide open, moves against Berlin,
or against Turkey, or against
Iran.
FOR WE would have acted on
the rule that a possible threat
against our security or our in
terests justifies us in going to
war. We would be saying that be
cause Cuba, which is only 90
miles away, is in the grip of an
unfriendly European power, we
have a right to blockade or occu
py the island; we would be saying
too that the Soviet Union has no
such right to act against the
American military positions in
Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, right on
her own frontier.
Let us not fool ourselves. Such
an argument does not wash. It
would be rejected, probably even
laughed at, not only by all neu
trals but by powerful elements
among our closest allies. There
are some who think foreign opin
ion doesn’t matter. But when it
comes to war, it means a great
deal to the belligerent who is for
him and who is against him. We
could go to war if Castro injures
us. But we cannot go to war, even
against Castro, because of what
he may conceivably do in the fu
ture. We cannot wage a prevent
ive war against Castro without
establishing the rule that a pre
ventive war is legitimate against
our military position in Berlin,
Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand,
South Vietnam, Formosa, Oki
nawa, South Korea, and Japan.
It is true, of course, that the
Soviet lodgement in Cuba is a
gross violation of the Monroe
Doctrine. Yet we cannot invoke
the Monroe Doctrine. Why not?
The Monroe Doctrine declares
that “any interposition” by a Eu
ropean power in this hemisphere
would be “the manifestation of an

unfriendly disposition towards
the United States.” Put, and this
is the crucial point, the American
claim for the isolation of the
Western hemisphere was coupled
with a renunciation of American
interest in the Eastern hemis
phere: “In the wars of the Eu
ropean pow’ers in matters relating
to themselves we have never
taken any part, nor does it com
port with our policy so to do.”
This fundamental passage in
Monroe’s message is, of course, a
restatement of the principle laid
down by Washington in his Fare
well Address: “Europe has a set
of primary interests which to us
have none, or a very remote rela
tion.”
THIS BASIS of the Monroe
Doctrine disappeared in the twen
tieth century in the two World
Wars, the Korean War, and the
cold war. We cannot invoke the
Monroe Doctrine without meeting
the question of what we are doing
all over Europe and Asia.
Our right to put Cuba under
surveillance, and if necessary to
blockade an invader, rests not on
the Monroe Doctrine but on the
elementary right of a people to
insure its own security. For two
centuries the British felt that way
about the occupation of Belgium
by an unfriendly power. The Rus
sians felt that way about Turkey.
This right can, however, be exer
cised only when there is a clear
and present danger.
Castro is an insulting nuisance,
but he is not, and is not now re
motely capable of becoming, a
clear and present danger to the
United States. So we must prac
tice watchful waiting, and hold
ourselves in readiness, never for
a moment forgetting the vastly
greater dangers elsewhere.
