# STAFF OPINION
## Tulane to Defy La. Race Law 
### BILL REPPY Associate Editor 
The ravings of Mississippi’s
governor Ross Barnett and the
squabbles in Albany. Ga., are
making the United States look
sick in the world press. But in
New Orleans, of all places, Stan
ford has found a liberal and fair
minded attitude on human rela
tions—what seems to be an en
lightened view towards racial
problems. It concerns an issue im
portant to most students univer
sity athletics.
Tulane University in New Or
leans is willing to defy a state
segregation law in order to tangle
with Stanford’s football team in
(he southern city.
THE LAW, adopted by the
Louisiana state legislature in
1956, forbids athletic contests in
which both Negro and white play
ers participate.
Tulane officials are well aware
that Stanford has a Negro boy on
its football squad. Assistant direc
tor of Athletics Chuck Taylor re
ports that in recent months his
department has had several con
versations with athletic directors
at Tulane.
"Tulane assures us there will be
no racial problem,” Taylor said.
When the home-and-home series
between the schools was sched
uled there was a Negro player on
the Stanford squad. Tulane knew
this and knew we were likely to
continue fielding athletic teams
representing all races, he added.
BY MEETING Stanford in foot
ball Tulane is willing to rise
above the petty prejudices of
southern legislators.
The Louisiana law which Tu
lane is ignoring is, frankly, dis
gusting to read. It’s purpose, ac
cording to the statute book, is “to
prohibit all interracial dancing,
social functions, entertainment,
athletic training, games, sports,
or contests, and other such activi
ties.” It declares “that all per
sons, firms, and corporations are
prohibited from sponsoring, ar
ranging. participating in, or per
mitting on premises under their
control any dancing, social func
tions, entertainments, athletic
training, games, sports or con
tests and other such activities in
volving personal and social con
tacts in which participants or
contestants are members of the
white and negro races.” (La.
4:451)

VIOLATORS shall ho “fined
not less than $lOO nor more than
$l,OOO and imprisoned for not less
than 60 days or more than one
year.” (4:454)
“This act,” the statute con
cludes, “is parsed in the exercise
of the State Police Power to regu
late public health, morals, and to
maintain peace and good order in
the State and shall be so con
strued.” (4:455)
Such an odious law, we feel,
should be repealed; it is gratify
ing, at least, that it is not rigidly
enforced. Mr. Taylor reports that
regents of Louisiana State Uni
versity are taking steps to allow
LSU’s athletic teams to schedule
any opponent regardless of racial
implications. Tulane and Stan
ford have arranged another home
and-home series for 1965 and 1966.

Tulane University in New Or

segregation law in order to tangle
with Stanford’s football team in

THE LAW, adopted by the
Louisiana state legislature in
1956, forbids athletic contests in
which both Negro and white play
ers participate.
Tulane officials are well aware
that Stanford has a Negro boy on
its football squad. Assistant direc

ports that in recent months his
department has had several con
versations with athletic directors
at Tulane.
"Tulane assures us there will be
no racial problem,” Taylor said.
When the home-and-home series
between the schools was sched
uled there was a Negro player on
the Stanford squad. Tulane knew
this and knew we were likely to
continue fielding athletic teams
representing all races, he added.
BY MEETING Stanford in foot
ball Tulane is willing to rise
above the petty prejudices of
southern legislators.
The Louisiana law which Tu

gusting to read. It’s purpose, ac
