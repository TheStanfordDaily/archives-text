## Trying to Rediscover America, Steinbeck Adds Little Insight 
### NILS WESSELL Editor 
“Travels With Charley,” by
John Steinbeck: The Viking
Press, Inc., 246 Pages

John Steinbeck’s latest book is
an amusing account of his three
month journey across the country
and back home again to Long Is
land. Afraid that, he might have
lost touch with America, he de
cided to set out in a pick-up truck
with his poodle, Charley, in order
to rediscover his native land and
its people.
“Travels With Charley” is like
ly to be a great disappointment to
the reader expecting to find un
usual insight into the American
character. Steinbeck has written
a travelogue, albeit wdth a per
sonal touch.
He dwells frequently and at
length on his canine friend. As it
turns out, he seems to learn more
about Charley than anything else:
“ in his own field of en
reavor. which he was now prac
ticing, the slow imperial smelling
over and anointing of an area, he
has no peer.”
WHEN STEINBECK is not pun
ning about or, worse yet, talking
to his dog, he trots out the old
saws about good climate being
boring, about the inability to ap
preciate warm weather “without
cold to give it sweetness,” or
about the uncivilized nature of
freeways.
Some of his observations, if not
especially astute, are occasionally
clever. Describing a state of
Mainer who was giving him direc
tions to Deer Isle, he writes: “I

have always heard that Maine
people are rather taciturn, but
for this candidate for Mount
Rushmore to point twice in an
afternon was to be unbearably
talkative.”
Having left Deer Isle and Maine,
he headed through northern New
England and upper New York
State across to Seattle. From
there he traveled south into Texas
and Louisiana. In New Orleans
Steinbeck mingled in the crowd
surrounding The Cheerleaders,
mothers jeering obscenities at a
little Negro girl attending a pre
viously all-white school with an
escort of federal marshals.
TALKING to Steinbeck, one
New Orleans Cab driver told him:
“Why, hell, mister. We know how
to take care of this. Everybody’s
happy and getting along fine.
Why. I like niggers. And them
goddamn New York Jews come in
and stir the niggers up. They just
slay in New' York there wouldn't
be no trouble. Ought to take them
out.” Steinbeck asked if he meant
lynch them. “I don’t mean noth
ing else, mister.”
Even when writing about a sub
ject as fraught with human mis
ery and frustration as race rela
tions in the South, Steinbeck fails
to add any new perception. Per
haps too many journalists have
written too many words on the
subject to allow for new insights,
and yet the person who begins
“Travels With Charley” is likely
to anticipate a rediscovery of his
country. Instead he learns that
Americans are the same kind of
people he would have guessed
from reading the paper every
morning.
