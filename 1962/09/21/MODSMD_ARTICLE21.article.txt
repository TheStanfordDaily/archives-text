# HISTORY OF LAKE LAG
## Sheep Trample Lake Bottom; Arsonists Burn Boathouses 
### DICK FREGULIA 
Lake Lagunita dates back to
earlier than 1883 when it was
originally dug with mules and
scrapers and dammed up with the
earth that had been excavated. It
was designed initially as a reser
voir to supply irrigation water
primarily for 160 acres of alfalfa
on the land now occupied by the
University buildings.
To keep the water from drain
ing through the porous soil of the
lake bottom, Senator Stanford
tried to seal the bottom by having
2,000 sheep trample the soil.
TWO MEN and four dogs kept
the sheep going. They were
driven two hours in the morning
and two again in the afternoon. ,
Then they were led away and
held off until the reservoir was ,
filled again, and the same process
repeated several times.
The sheep were held at the \
Stanford Ranch from about Do- i
comber until the following July.
; When the University was built, i
the irrigation need for the lake j
was greatly reduced, and subse- j
quently Stanford and others be
gan to realize the value of letting
the lake water seep through the
bottom to replenish the under
ground well-water supply,
IT WAS at this time, when
Stanford University came into ex
istence, that the lake was first
used for recreational purposes. A
few hardy athletes took a fancy to
crew racing, and before long they
were hopping the fences with ,
shells and oars for their daily
rowing workouts.
Pretty soon a boathouse was
built and crews of both sexes be
gan working out in what became
for a few years a major sporting
interest on the campus.
The rigorous activity eventual
ly gave way to more leisurely pas
times of canoeing, swimming,
sun-tanning, and just relaxing.
The lake began to take on its tra
ditional country club air.
SINCE the building of the first
boathouse, a building designed
only to house the crew shells, a
number of boathouses and miscel- |
laneous structures have made the I
scene along the shore. Evidently |
Stanford students at one time
took great pleasure in putting up J
boat houses only to see how spec-1
tacularly they could later be de-!
stroyed.
A 1934 article reports that two
of the boathouses burned to the I

water’s edge “while the cheering
roughs stood by tramping on un
welcome fire hoses and hurriedly
gathering limbs and lumber to
send the flames higher for a brief
moment of good fun.”
IN 1916-17 a band pavilion was
moved to the lakeshore where it
was used for the women’s spring
festival. It, too, had its life ter
minated a few years later when
some mischievous student touch
ed a match to it.

The tradition of burning boat
houses has for the time being dis
appeared. If present talk to make
' Lagunita into a year-round lake
ever materializes, however, stu
dents are going to be forced to
; decide on how to replace the an
nual Big Game bonfire. With
: nothing on dry land to burn ex
cept the present boathouse, it is
possible that this dormant tradi
tion might yet be revived some
Big Game eve.

' Lagunita into a year-round lake
ever materializes, however, stu

nual Big Game bonfire. With

Lake Lagunita dates back to
earlier than 1883 when it was
originally dug with mules and
scrapers and dammed up with the
earth that had been excavated. It
was designed initially as a reser
voir to supply irrigation water
primarily for 160 acres of alfalfa
on the land now occupied by the
University buildings.
To keep the water from drain
ing through the porous soil of the
lake bottom, Senator Stanford
tried to seal the bottom by having
2,000 sheep trample the soil.
TWO MEN and four dogs kept
the sheep going. They were
driven two hours in the morning
and two again in the afternoon. ,
Then they were led away and
held off until the reservoir was ,
filled again, and the same process
repeated several times.
The sheep were held at the \
Stanford Ranch from about Do- i
comber until the following July.
; When the University was built, i
the irrigation need for the lake j
was greatly reduced, and subse- j
quently Stanford and others be
gan to realize the value of letting
the lake water seep through the
bottom to replenish the under
ground well-water supply,
IT WAS at this time, when
Stanford University came into ex
istence, that the lake was first
used for recreational purposes. A
few hardy athletes took a fancy to
crew racing, and before long they
were hopping the fences with ,
shells and oars for their daily
rowing workouts.
Pretty soon a boathouse was
built and crews of both sexes be
gan working out in what became
for a few years a major sporting
interest on the campus.
The rigorous activity eventual
ly gave way to more leisurely pas
times of canoeing, swimming,
sun-tanning, and just relaxing.
The lake began to take on its tra
ditional country club air.
SINCE the building of the first
boathouse, a building designed
only to house the crew shells, a
number of boathouses and miscel- |
laneous structures have made the I
scene along the shore. Evidently |
Stanford students at one time
took great pleasure in putting up J
boat houses only to see how spec-1
tacularly they could later be de-!
stroyed.
A 1934 article reports that two
of the boathouses burned to the I

water’s edge “while the cheering
roughs stood by tramping on un
welcome fire hoses and hurriedly
gathering limbs and lumber to
send the flames higher for a brief
moment of good fun.”
IN 1916-17 a band pavilion was
moved to the lakeshore where it
was used for the women’s spring
festival. It, too, had its life ter
minated a few years later when
some mischievous student touch
ed a match to it.
