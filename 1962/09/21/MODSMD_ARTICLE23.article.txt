Welcome to the land of the for
ward pass and the moral victory.
Although the term “moral vic
tory’’ is a household phrase any
where within radio or newspaper
range of Stanford football, per
haps you haven’t heard of it, es
pecially if you’re from an area
that is used to powerful home
teams.
At Stanford we haven’t been
that fortunate, especially in the
last five or six years, when medi
ocre Indian squads have frequent
ly been outmanned by some of
the nation’s top teams. There
have been times, however, when
the Indians have risen to whomp
highly rated opponents—for one
half or three quarters of the
game, only to fall back to defeat
by the end of the game, as pre
dicted.
Then Stanford fans had to sat
isfy their deflated egos by the
memory of those first three, suc
cessful quarters. The Tribe had
outplayed its ratings and had
given a mighty foe a real scare,
all adding up to a victory in the
minds and consciences of the fans
but not in the scorebook a moral
victory.
This season the Indians will
have few chances to win moral
victories: they are the best Stan
ford team in years and will prob
ably never be given the severe
underdog ranking necessary to be
eligible for a moral victory. Take
heart though, there will be other
victories, of the more convention
al variety, on the Farm this year.
As far as Stanford’s football
tradition, the forward pass has
characterized Indian teams for
the past decade. Jack Curtice and
Chuck Taylor, the two most re
cent Indian head coaches, have
developed some of the nation’s
outstanding quarterbacks, since
1949. The list includes All-
Americans Bob Garrett, John
Brodie, and Dick Norman, All
Coast Gary Gerkorian, and Jack
Douglas.
The combination of these pass
ers with ends like All-Americans
Chris Burford and Bill McColl has
insured that Stanford football has
always been exciting and high
scoring, even if the teams were
not great successes. The tradition
of excitement will be continued
this year with the added enjoy
ment of a winning team.
