# Indian Gridders Battle Green Wave, Humidity Tonight
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Stanford s 1962 football team is now encamped in New Orleans where it will meet the Green
Wave of In lane University and tile heat wave of the Louisiana autumn in the season’s opener
tonight. Femperatnres of about S5 degrees with 90 per cent humidity are expected.
A win will start the Indians off on the right foot in what is potentially their brightest yeai
since 1957, their last winning season (6-4). Pre-season polls rate the Tribe third, behind US(

arm Washington, in the now. six
team Athlotio Association of
Western Universities lAAWU),
but optimists see strong possibili
ties to finish well beyond that ex
pectation, i.e„ the Rose Bowl.
Stanford has picked what at
first appears to be an easy oppo
nent to start out against. The In
dians beat the Green Wave last
year, 9-7 on (he scoreboard and
even more convincingly in the
sattistics. The Greenies went on

from that loss to complete a sea
son which can only be described
as miserable: they won only two
| games, scored but eight louch
j downs, averaged less than 160
j yards per game, and completed
) only six passes per game.
But all that was in the past, be
| fore the reign of neophyte coach
Tommy O’Boyle. O’Boyle, intent
upon substantially improving last
year's lacklustre record, has
brought his Irish temper to prac
tice this fall and has really
shaken up the team. Twelve
! players have been dropped and
I six sophomores are now in the
starting lineup. An all-new, ec
lectic system has been installed,
featuring the lonesome end of
fense from Army and division of
the squad into three complete
units which will be substituted in
tact, a la Louisiana State.
Most important, he has repeat
edly warned the Greenies that
Stanford, which looks like a push
over on a schedule that includes
Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, LSU
and Georgia Tech, is “one of the
best teams on the West Coast.”
With his warnings, the compe
tition created among the three
units, and the excitement of an
| opening night, O’Boyle will pre
-1 sent an aroused group of foot
j bailers tonight.
[ Stanford coach “Cactus” Jack
j Curtice will counter with what
I looks like a winning combination
| of brains and brawn. The brain
; trust resides mainly in the quar
terbacks, juniors Steve Thurlow
j and Clark Weaver and sophomore
j Dick Ragsdale. Because Thurlow
was out two-thirds of last year,
I and Weaver is a transfer from the
j Colorado frosh, the three quarter -
| backs have behind them a total
i of only forty minutes of varsity j
| play, and Thurlow owns all of j
I them.

Yet it is their responsibility to
direct Stanford’s diverse, short
gaining offense. There will be a
lot of pass, run, or pitchout option
plays interspersed with straight
ahead runs to keep the defense
honest.
In this type of attack, the quar
terback must do a lot of work,
rolling out, blocking, and passing
on the run. With so active a role
for the quarterback, Curtice is
fortunate to be three deep at this
position, although Ragsdale will
be used mainly for punting and
defense.
The rest of the hackfield is
handicapped by the absence of
any exceptional speed. Tyce Fitz
morris, out with a knee injury,
is (ho team's fastest back. He has
been replaced at left half by J. D.
Lodato, a shifty runner and the
only starting sophomore.
Ed Cummings, at fullback, is
the team’s most powerful runner.
The right half, or wingback, is
mainly a pass receiver in Cur
tice’s formation and is always
flanked or slotted.
The real bright spot on the
team is the interior line. The top
ten men in these five positions
include seven lettermen and

average 220+ pounds hut are still
quite mobile. The heftiest men
are the tackles: A1 Hildebrand
1236), Frank Atkinson (245),
Chuck Buehler (266), and Dick
Leeuwenberg (252), and C. B. Si
mons (230) shifted this year to
center. The guards who are prob
ably the most skilled and experi
enced players in the line are
Frank Dubofsky (225) and Marv
Harris (224).
Curtice has taken 40 players on
the trip and expecls to substitute
them liberally. He believes, “You
need 22 men on your first team to
compete in modern football,” and
will alternate basically two com
plete units every six or seven
minutes to minimize the effect of
the humid weather.

The Stanford-Tiilane foot
ball same will he broadcast
live by radio station KCKS
starting at «:35 tonight.


HERE ARE THE BRAINS of the outfit, the quarterbacks: from left to
right, junior Steve Thurlow, soph Dick Ragsdale, and junior Clark
Weaver.

[ Stanford coach “Cactus” Jack
j Curtice will counter with what
I looks like a winning combination
| of brains and brawn. The brain
; trust resides mainly in the quar
terbacks, juniors Steve Thurlow
j and Clark Weaver and sophomore
j Dick Ragsdale. Because Thurlow
was out two-thirds of last year,
I and Weaver is a transfer from the
j Colorado frosh, the three quarter -
| backs have behind them a total
i of only forty minutes of varsity j
| play, and Thurlow owns all of j
I them.

Yet it is their responsibility to
direct Stanford’s diverse, short
gaining offense. There will be a
lot of pass, run, or pitchout option
plays interspersed with straight
ahead runs to keep the defense
honest.
In this type of attack, the quar
terback must do a lot of work,
rolling out, blocking, and passing
on the run. With so active a role
for the quarterback, Curtice is
fortunate to be three deep at this
position, although Ragsdale will
be used mainly for punting and
defense.
The rest of the hackfield is
handicapped by the absence of
any exceptional speed. Tyce Fitz
morris, out with a knee injury,
is (ho team's fastest back. He has
been replaced at left half by J. D.
Lodato, a shifty runner and the
only starting sophomore.
Ed Cummings, at fullback, is
the team’s most powerful runner.
The right half, or wingback, is
mainly a pass receiver in Cur
tice’s formation and is always
flanked or slotted.
The real bright spot on the
team is the interior line. The top
ten men in these five positions
include seven lettermen and

average 220+ pounds hut are still
quite mobile. The heftiest men
are the tackles: A1 Hildebrand
1236), Frank Atkinson (245),
Chuck Buehler (266), and Dick
Leeuwenberg (252), and C. B. Si
mons (230) shifted this year to
center. The guards who are prob
ably the most skilled and experi
enced players in the line are
Frank Dubofsky (225) and Marv
Harris (224).
Curtice has taken 40 players on
the trip and expecls to substitute
them liberally. He believes, “You
need 22 men on your first team to
compete in modern football,” and
will alternate basically two com
plete units every six or seven
minutes to minimize the effect of
the humid weather.

terbacks, juniors Steve Thurlow
j and Clark Weaver and sophomore
j Dick Ragsdale. Because Thurlow
was out two-thirds of last year,
I and Weaver is a transfer from the
j Colorado frosh, the three quarter -
| backs have behind them a total
i of only forty minutes of varsity j
| play, and Thurlow owns all of j
I them.

Yet it is their responsibility to
direct Stanford’s diverse, short
gaining offense. There will be a
lot of pass, run, or pitchout option
plays interspersed with straight
ahead runs to keep the defense
honest.
In this type of attack, the quar
terback must do a lot of work,
rolling out, blocking, and passing
on the run. With so active a role
for the quarterback, Curtice is
fortunate to be three deep at this
position, although Ragsdale will
be used mainly for punting and
defense.
The rest of the hackfield is
handicapped by the absence of
any exceptional speed. Tyce Fitz
morris, out with a knee injury,
is (ho team's fastest back. He has
been replaced at left half by J. D.
Lodato, a shifty runner and the
only starting sophomore.
Ed Cummings, at fullback, is
the team’s most powerful runner.
The right half, or wingback, is
mainly a pass receiver in Cur
tice’s formation and is always
flanked or slotted.
The real bright spot on the
team is the interior line. The top
ten men in these five positions
include seven lettermen and

average 220+ pounds hut are still
quite mobile. The heftiest men
are the tackles: A1 Hildebrand
1236), Frank Atkinson (245),
Chuck Buehler (266), and Dick
Leeuwenberg (252), and C. B. Si
mons (230) shifted this year to
center. The guards who are prob
ably the most skilled and experi
enced players in the line are
Frank Dubofsky (225) and Marv
Harris (224).
Curtice has taken 40 players on
the trip and expecls to substitute
them liberally. He believes, “You
need 22 men on your first team to
compete in modern football,” and
will alternate basically two com
plete units every six or seven
minutes to minimize the effect of
the humid weather.

The Stanford-Tiilane foot
ball same will he broadcast
live by radio station KCKS
starting at «:35 tonight.


HERE ARE THE BRAINS of the outfit, the quarterbacks: from left to
right, junior Steve Thurlow, soph Dick Ragsdale, and junior Clark
Weaver.
Stanford s 1962 football team is now encamped in New Orleans where it will meet the Green
Wave of In lane University and tile heat wave of the Louisiana autumn in the season’s opener
tonight. Femperatnres of about S5 degrees with 90 per cent humidity are expected.
A win will start the Indians off on the right foot in what is potentially their brightest yeai
since 1957, their last winning season (6-4). Pre-season polls rate the Tribe third, behind US(

arm Washington, in the now. six
team Athlotio Association of
Western Universities lAAWU),
but optimists see strong possibili
ties to finish well beyond that ex
pectation, i.e„ the Rose Bowl.
Stanford has picked what at
first appears to be an easy oppo
nent to start out against. The In
dians beat the Green Wave last
year, 9-7 on (he scoreboard and
even more convincingly in the
sattistics. The Greenies went on

from that loss to complete a sea
son which can only be described
as miserable: they won only two
| games, scored but eight louch
j downs, averaged less than 160
j yards per game, and completed
) only six passes per game.
But all that was in the past, be
| fore the reign of neophyte coach
Tommy O’Boyle. O’Boyle, intent
upon substantially improving last
year's lacklustre record, has
brought his Irish temper to prac
tice this fall and has really
shaken up the team. Twelve
! players have been dropped and
I six sophomores are now in the
starting lineup. An all-new, ec
lectic system has been installed,
featuring the lonesome end of
fense from Army and division of
the squad into three complete
units which will be substituted in
tact, a la Louisiana State.
Most important, he has repeat
edly warned the Greenies that
Stanford, which looks like a push
over on a schedule that includes
Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, LSU
and Georgia Tech, is “one of the
best teams on the West Coast.”
With his warnings, the compe
tition created among the three
units, and the excitement of an
| opening night, O’Boyle will pre
-1 sent an aroused group of foot
j bailers tonight.
