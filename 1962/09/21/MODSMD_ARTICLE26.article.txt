## 
### CHRIS CHRISTIAN 
Stanford’s class of ’66 stormed
the campus Wednesday for the
traditional Pre-Reg Week pro
gram. The class is 1,280 strong
with 864 men and 416 women.
The students were selected from
6.562 applicants, who comprised
Stanford’s largest candidate
group, according to Dr. Rixford
Snyder. Director of Admissions.
Entrance requirements had to be
stiffened to avoid accepting more
students than could be handled,
he said.
Last year’s freshman class ex
ceeded this year’s by 80 students
and marked an all-time high for
frosh enrollment. This was be
cause fewer students declined
their acceptance than had been
anticipated, Dr. Snyder explained.
About half (he frosh class
comes from California. The sec
ond best represented state is Illi
nois with 67 students, followed
by Washington with 58 and Ore
gon with 52.
THE ONLY states not repre
sented in this year’s Freshman
class are Georgia, North Carolina
and West Virginia. There are 17
students from 11 foreign coun
tries.
Among those accepted this year
were thirty-eight National Merit
Scholars and five General Motors
Scholarship winners. About 43

per cent of the freshmen will be
receiving financial aid.
Stanford has also admitted 289
transfer students. Most of the 39
women included in this number
will be enrolled in the nursing
program.
Although the freshmen had
hardly had time to unpack their
bags, The Daily interviewed a few
to see what their first impres
sions of Stanford were. Friendli
ness seemed to stand out more
than anything else. As Bruce
Saltier of Arroyo put it, “Stan
ford really cares about the fresh
men."
iMOST OF the out-of-staters in
terviewed were surprised at the
size of the campus. Bill Schuback
of Arroyo described it as "cosmo
politan.”
Some Easterners like Susan
Strauser of Branner, think the
town east of Stanford is called
Pay-Low Alto. But they haven’t
gone shopping yet.
Only two of the frosh inter
viewed weren’t completely happy.
Kathy Sprague of Roble was dis
appointed with the blue and white
fire hydrants. And Barbara
Schnur of Branner felt sorry for
those red-hot freshmen who have
been reading Burns all summer.
The most enthusiastic comment
on Stanford came from frosh foot
ball player Glen Meyers of Soto,
who said, "It’s groat between 3
and 5.” (That’s when they prac
tice.
