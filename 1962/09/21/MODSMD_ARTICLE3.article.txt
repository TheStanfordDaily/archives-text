# Stanford Gives Sabin Vaccine
## 
### 
Sabin oral polio vaccine will be
given to students beginning this
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at
the Health Service headquarters
in the Women’s Gym.
The immunization drive to
“K.O. Polio" will continue on
Monday through Wednesday from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Students, faculty,
employees and the public are eli
gible for the vaccine clinic.
Dr. Maurice M. Osborne, Jr., of
the Health Service urges every
one to take the Sabin vaccine
since “the Salk vaccine has a 20-
25 per cent chance of doing an in
adequate job.” Those vaccinated
will be asked to donate 25 cents
to pay for the program’s cost.
THE VACCINE to be adminis
tered Sunday through Wednesday
will be to counteract one of three
strains of polio, Type I. Two more
Inoculation sessions are planned
in November and December to
deal with Types II and 111. A four
week interval is required between
sessions.
Dr. Osborne said that he hoped
that Canada’s suspension of Type
HI serum wouldn’t scare people
away. “In this session we will
only use Type I serum, of which
there has been no suspicion of
any kind. Canada suspended Type
111 serum to allow time to inves
tigate four questionable cases. By
the lime we are ready for the
Type 111 serum, the serum should
be cleared.” Dr. Osborne said.
Vaccination will be accomplish
ed not by shots but by eating a
lump of sugar with three drops
of the vaccine on it.
THE SABIN vaccine has been
extensively pretested in Russia,
Hungary, and parts of the U.S.
According to Dr. Osborne, Hun
gary averaged 500 cases of para
lytic polio in a non-epidemic year
prior to giving the Sabin vaccine.
Since it has been given, only 10
to 20 such cases have been re
ported annually.
Dr. Osborne notes that the Sa
bin vaccine “gives permanent im
munity as far as we know after
a five-year observation.” More
over, in field tests in Miami as
well as part of Russia no ill side
effects have been reported.
The Sabin vaccine consists of
attenuated viruses not having
power to cause disease. In con
trast the Salk vaccine consists of
killed although virulent virus
having the potential to cause dis
ease if it is not treated correctly.
Several such cases have developed
from the Salk vaccine in the past.

there has been no suspicion of
any kind. Canada suspended Type
111 serum to allow time to inves
tigate four questionable cases. By
the lime we are ready for the
Type 111 serum, the serum should
be cleared.” Dr. Osborne said.
Vaccination will be accomplish
ed not by shots but by eating a
lump of sugar with three drops
of the vaccine on it.
THE SABIN vaccine has been
extensively pretested in Russia,
Hungary, and parts of the U.S.
According to Dr. Osborne, Hun
gary averaged 500 cases of para
lytic polio in a non-epidemic year
prior to giving the Sabin vaccine.
Since it has been given, only 10
to 20 such cases have been re
ported annually.
Dr. Osborne notes that the Sa
bin vaccine “gives permanent im
munity as far as we know after
a five-year observation.” More
over, in field tests in Miami as
well as part of Russia no ill side
effects have been reported.
The Sabin vaccine consists of
attenuated viruses not having
power to cause disease. In con
trast the Salk vaccine consists of
killed although virulent virus
having the potential to cause dis
ease if it is not treated correctly.
Several such cases have developed
from the Salk vaccine in the past.
Sabin oral polio vaccine will be
given to students beginning this
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at
the Health Service headquarters
in the Women’s Gym.
The immunization drive to
“K.O. Polio" will continue on
Monday through Wednesday from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Students, faculty,
employees and the public are eli
gible for the vaccine clinic.
Dr. Maurice M. Osborne, Jr., of
the Health Service urges every
one to take the Sabin vaccine
since “the Salk vaccine has a 20-
25 per cent chance of doing an in
adequate job.” Those vaccinated
will be asked to donate 25 cents
to pay for the program’s cost.
THE VACCINE to be adminis
tered Sunday through Wednesday
will be to counteract one of three
strains of polio, Type I. Two more
Inoculation sessions are planned
in November and December to
deal with Types II and 111. A four
week interval is required between
sessions.
Dr. Osborne said that he hoped
that Canada’s suspension of Type
HI serum wouldn’t scare people
away. “In this session we will
only use Type I serum, of which
there has been no suspicion of
any kind. Canada suspended Type
111 serum to allow time to inves
tigate four questionable cases. By
the lime we are ready for the
Type 111 serum, the serum should
be cleared.” Dr. Osborne said.
