# Roble, Branner, Wilbur Stern
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER Managing Editor 
Freshman men and women are
concentrated in Roble, Branner
and Wilbur Halls and mixed with
upperclassmen in Stern. As each
freshman only lives in one of the
halls, class unity should be in
creased by telling each group how
the other three-fourths live.
Roble Hall houses 244 frosh dol
lies at the corner of Santa Teresa
St. and Lomita Dr. After the
spring rains it will be next to
Lake Lagunita; now it is next to
a dry swamp.
THE FIRST Roble was built as
a temporary dorm in 1892, named
after a kind of oak; it remained
in use as a dorm until the 1930’5,
despite damage in the 1906 earth
quake. Then the upper floors
were removed, the building was
renamed Sequoia, and the Statis
tics department moved in. So it is
today.
The present Roble was finished
in 1918, and has frequently been
refurnished. Its latest addition is
individual room phones, making
it the only freshman dorm and
the only dorm besides Flo Mo so
equipped.
Sponsor Lcola Barnes invited
the freshman men to make the
cross-campus walk to visit Roble,
saying the girls and architecture
are well worth the trip.
THE REST of the freshman
girls, 165 of them, are staying in
Branner, nestled between the men
of Toyon and Wilbur. Branner
began its career in 1924 as home
of 150 upper division and gradu
ate men.
During the second World War
many young men were in uniform
and the female population at
Stanford increased. Starting in
Autumn Quarter, 1944, Branner
became the home for freshman
women. Except for the summer

of 1946, it has stayed that way.
WILBUR is the largest dorm
on campus with 720 freshman
men living in eight houses. Con
struction began in August, 1954,
and was completed 13 months
later. Landscaping was finished
in January, 1956, and the building
was dedicated in May.
This dorm established the house
system at Stanford. Wilbur was
named for Ray Lyman Wilbur,
President of Stanford from 1916
until 1943, and chancellor from
then until his death in 1949.
The 132 freshman men at Stern
are unique in that they are the
only freshmen living with upper
classmen. In place of the upper
classman sponsors at (he other
freshman dorms, the men at
Stern are under graduate student
Resident Assistants. They live
with 400 upperclassmen in eight

houses.
STERN HALL is the gift of the
estate of Mrs. Lucie Stern. The
four two-story houses facing Es
condido were finished in 1949
under a $400,000 gift from Mrs.
Stern’s will containing an anti
discrimination clause.
Three-storied Donner and Serra
were completed in 1956. Muir and
Burbank, also of three stories,
were finished in 1958.
Stern almost became co-educa
tional last year. The student leg
islature, or LASSU, recommend
ed conversion of Fremont and
Holladay into a coeducational
unit. There would be forty girls
in Fremont, sixty men in Holla
day. They would share eating and
some recreational facilities, hut
have private lounges and sleeping
areas. The recommendation was
not carried out.


THE OLD LIFE gives way to the new as a freshman boy receives
one last bit of advice and explanation from his father after he completes the first part of joining University life—registering at Wilbur.
