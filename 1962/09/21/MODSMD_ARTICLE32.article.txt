### BILE REPPV Associate Editor 
"Help in a hurry" is how Presi
dent J. R. Wallace Sterling de
scribed freshman orientation at
Stanford to more than 1000 mem
bers of the class of ’66 at the tra
ditional convocation Wednesday
at Frost Amphitheater.
“It may leave you a bit ex
hausted and confused, but this
will pass, and you’ll find it has
been helpful,” he said of the pro
reg activities.
"In a month or sooner you’ll
feel at home here, like an old
hand. You won’t be, but you’ll feel
like it,” Sterling said.
AT ABOUT this time the fresh
men will begin asking a lot of
questions of the administration
most of which the administrators
have heard several times each
year, many of which have already
been solved, he said.
"But by all means ask your
questions,” he told the freshmen,
adding that he didn’t guarantee
| answers everytime.
| The president recommended
that questions be formalized in
writing. A well-written and
J reasoned letter makes the most
efficient use of lime in communi
cation, he said.
UNDKRGKAIHJATK life out
side the classroom adds to the in
dividual’s development, but
doesn't replace academic achieve
ment, he said.
Pointing to increased concern
among students about their
| rights, Sterling said: “It is more
common to assert one’s rights
I than to accept responsibility.”
( Under state laws, ho explained,
students have no special treat
ment, but at the university in
I which they enroll there are rules
particularly for students. They
must be abided by.
"What is here for you,” he said
in closing, “is made available by
the interest, generosity, and love
of others. Remember this and
respect this at all times.”
