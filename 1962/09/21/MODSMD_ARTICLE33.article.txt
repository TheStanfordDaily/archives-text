# Stanford Business Conference Hears Agency Shops Attacked
## 
### 
So-called agency shops, which
permit labor unions to receive in
come from non-members, were
attacked as “the most abominable
practice in the labor movement
today” by Visiting Prof. George
F. Brooks of the New York State
School of Industrial and Labor
Relations, Cornell University.
Speaking at the closing session
of the 20lh Stanford Business
Conference, Brooks described the
agency shop its “a heavenly ar
rangement” for union leaders,
permitting them to get regular
salary payments without having
to tell anyone how the money is
earned.
Publicly backed by the AFL
CIO, agency shops have sprung
up in Indiana and other states
with “right to work” laws ban
ning union shops.
“Some unions might deliber
ately discourage membership” in
their organization if the agency
shop arrangements are upheld by
the courts, Brooks said.
A self-described intellectual in |

the labor movement for 16 years,
Brooks formerly served as direc
tor of research and education for
the International Brotherhood of
Pulp, Sulphite, and Paper Mill
Workers.
He said the process of repre- 1
sentation—a two-way flow of j
communication from members to
leaders—“lies at the heart” of |

ethical problems in unionism to
clay.
All too often, he said, “the un
ion leader has unbounded eonfi
dence in his own judgment of
what’s best for his men.” This
leads to gross distortion of com
munication.
