# ART:
## SU Museum's Schnier Show 
### 
A collection of abstract sculp
ture by Jacques Schnier is being
exhibited in the Stanford Museum
now until October 7.
Twenty-five pieces of purely ab
stract, non-representational work
will be shown.
Schnier, currently an art pro
fessor at the University of Cali
fornia in Berkeley, received a
civil engineering degree at Stan
ford in 1920. He spent five years
as an engineer before entering
UC to study architecture, hoping
to combine engineering and city
planning.
Interest in art overcame inter
est in engineering, and in 1926 he
went into sculpture as an art
form, taking work at UC and the
California Institute of Fine Arts
in San Francisco.
SCHNIER, who works primari
ly in bronze, is interested in ex
pressing the purely creative as
pects of sculpture without appli
cation to any other form.
In a brochure prepared for the
sculpture display, Stanford Mu
seum Director John LaPlante
says, “In his beginning work,
Jacques Schnier found signifi
cance in the recognizability of a
human figure; gradually he found
recognizability too small to hbld
his meaning. Reality is. It does
not ‘look like’ something else.
His sculptures are distillations of
his perception of reality.”
Schnier, who has taught sculp
ture at UC for the past 25 years,
has won many prizes and gold
medals in exhibitions throughout
the country.
HE DESIGNED the commemo
rative half-dollar which was
struck off for the opening of the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge in 1936.
His work is in the public collec
tions at the California Palace of
the Legion of Honor, the San
Francisco Museum of Art, Mills
College Gallery, and the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem.
This exhibit, one of the many
held on various subjects each
year at the Museum, is open to
the public without charge daily
from 1 to 5 p.m.

A collection of abstract sculp
ture by Jacques Schnier is being
exhibited in the Stanford Museum
now until October 7.
Twenty-five pieces of purely ab
stract, non-representational work
will be shown.
Schnier, currently an art pro
fessor at the University of Cali
fornia in Berkeley, received a
civil engineering degree at Stan
ford in 1920. He spent five years
as an engineer before entering
UC to study architecture, hoping
to combine engineering and city
planning.
Interest in art overcame inter
est in engineering, and in 1926 he
went into sculpture as an art
form, taking work at UC and the
California Institute of Fine Arts
in San Francisco.
SCHNIER, who works primari
ly in bronze, is interested in ex
pressing the purely creative as
pects of sculpture without appli
cation to any other form.
In a brochure prepared for the
sculpture display, Stanford Mu
seum Director John LaPlante
says, “In his beginning work,
Jacques Schnier found signifi
cance in the recognizability of a
human figure; gradually he found
recognizability too small to hbld
his meaning. Reality is. It does
not ‘look like’ something else.
His sculptures are distillations of
his perception of reality.”
Schnier, who has taught sculp
ture at UC for the past 25 years,
has won many prizes and gold
medals in exhibitions throughout
the country.
HE DESIGNED the commemo
rative half-dollar which was
struck off for the opening of the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge in 1936.
His work is in the public collec
