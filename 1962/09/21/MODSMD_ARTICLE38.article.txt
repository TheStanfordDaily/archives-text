# The 						Compleat Stanfordite Requires Complete Control of Stanford Idiom
## 
### PALI, RICCI 
One of the first things afresh
man at Stanford should learn is
how to act in such away as to
let people know that he is a real
Stanford student. The best way
to do this is to master the pecu
liar dialect of English spoken on
the Farm. The knowledgeable |
freshman should be able to cope
with a sentence like “You can be
a red hot and book every night,
or you can kiss off and hustle
dollies, hut for God’s sake don’t
be a turkey.”
This sentence contains a num-1
her of descriptive terms which
are normally applied to people.
The “red hot” is the student who
“books,” or studies all the time,
whereas to “kiss off” means to
give one’s studies a minimum of
attention. Then there is plenty of i
time to “hustle dollies,” or chase [
women.
THE WORD “turkey” is used
by conformists to designate any
one who is “different.” Of course. •
this ultimately makes everyone a
turkey: nevertheless, the word is i
common. A “mickey” (from the
famous Mouse i is a snap course. !
Its opposite is a “bear.”
Another interesting inhabitant ,
of the Farm is the Straight Ar- j
row, who is known for abstaining
from sin. The Straight Arrow is
quite rare, being greatly outnum
bered by his opposite, the Animal.
There are many Animals on the
Farm.
The well oriented freshman
should also have a firm grasp of
the verbal shorthand for various
key buildings on campus. These
abbreviations should be mastered;
Mem (Memorial), Dink (Dinkel
spiel), Hoov (Hoover), Lag (La
gunita), Con (Convalescent), Cub
(Cubberley), Flo (Florence), Civ
(Civilization). Tow (Tower), Libe
(Library), Mo (Moore), Aud (Au
ditorium. and Chu (Church). Put
all together and they spell, not
MOTHER, but Mem Chu, Hoov
Tow, Flo Mo, Main Libe, Cub
Aud, Civ Libe. Mem Aud, Con
Home, Dink Aud, and Lake Lag.
It is virtually impossible to ask
directions on campus unless these
terms are learned.
SOME terms are downright mis
leading. For instance, the Tank is
the physics lecture hall, not the
swimming pool. And some are so
j obvious that only a turkey could
[ go wrong; Poli Sci, Biz. Bio, West
ern Civ, Econ. Psych, etc.
“Bitchin’ ” is a word that has to
be watched. To call something
bitchin’ is to say that it is in har
mony with all that is collegiate
and sublime. But it is beginning
to go out of style, and soon any
one who uses it will sound as it
he is trying to be collegiate. Soon
only turkeys will use it.

Be careful of bogus Stanford
idiom. There are certain words
that have become current in the
bureaucracy but not in the stu
dent body. For instance, the word
used to describe (he dance in the
Wilbur courtyards, “Jollyup,”
will not be used again.
MISCELLANEOUS notes; Ro
ble is not prorfounced correctly,
but “ROH-blee;” Captain Mid
night is the cycle cop who runs
you in for riding your Vespa

through Quad on Saturday night,
dollie on the back and bottle in
pocket; an RA is a grad student
who lives in a dorm or house and
watches over a brood of under
grads with the benevolence of a
mother hen; and when a Stanford
man says to a dollie he’s been
hustling, “See you around Quad,"
he means exactly that: the only
times he will see her henceforth
will be when he chances to meet
her on Quad.
