# Skin Disease Research Grant Expanded by Hartford Fund
## 
### 
Stanford University School of
Medicine's intensive investigation
of psoriasis, the disfiguring skin
disease which affects 3 to 4 mil
lion Americans, will continue for
another three years under a grant
of $493,645 from the John A.
Hartford Foundation, Inc., of
New York.
Scientists have studied the
course of the ailment in more
than 450 patients at Stanford
Medical Center since 1959, when
the program was started with an
initial grant of $295,928 from the

Hartford Found? ion.
During the investigation intri
cate analyses of fatty substances
and proteins in many patients’
skin (both normal and diseased)
have been made in an attempt to
learn mure rbout the cause of the
illness, what its specific charac
teristics are and how it relates to
other diseases. New drugs and
new ways of administering medi
cation have also been tried. Thus
far the multi-discipline attack has
utilized specialists in chemistry,
pathology, genetics, immunology,
physiology and rheumatology.
The Hartford grant will count
toward the campaign total in the
current Stanford PACE Program
a $lOO Million Plan of Action
for a Challenging Era. The gift
will bring the University an addi
tional $164,548 under a matching
