# Stanford's 2nd Union Features Food, Culture, Music, Comfort

The days of drinking coffee in
paper cups while standing in the
rain are over: gone, too, are the
days of driving two miles to go
bowling, crowded dances on
creaking fraternity floors, and
date-phobia because of nothing to
do on campus. Tresidder Memori
al Union, the nucleus of the Stu
dent Activities Center, offers stu
dents everything from Beethoven
to billiards.
The student union is no new
idea at Stanford. The old Union—
the men’s and women’s club
houses- -was first suggested in
1909 by Herbert Hoover and was
opened in 1915. The Cellar, dedi
cated in 1922 was Stanford’s first
“community center.” It has been
the social meeting place for 10
student generations.
With the Cellar, the change
was made from clubhouse to com
munity center, but the old union
and the Cellar were too small and
the services limited. In 1946 a
student poll indicated that a now
union was the most important
need on the campus.
WHEN DONALD Tresidder,
Stanford's fourth President, died
suddenly in 1948, it was decided
that a union would be a fitting
memorial for this man known for
his dedication to students.
The planning stage of the union
was long and involved. After
World War 11, the nation, society,
and universities were rapidly
changing. The services had to
meet the wider range of interests

of today’s students.
Work on the s2.(i million Tresid
der finally began last fall. While
the completion of Tresidder has
been delayed by a contractors’
strike, the building was opened
officially Monday. Dedication
ceremonies are scheduled for
Saturday, Sept. 29, and it is ex
pected that the remaining con
struction will be completed by
that time.
The upper level of Tresidder
houses administrative and stu
dent offices, music-listening and
reading rooms, an information
center, a central ticket sales of
fice, conference rooms and pro
gram lounges.
ON THK MAIN level are a 10-
chair barber shop, a travel agen
cy, a store, and a dining area
which can handle 700 people at
once. For recreation, students
may choose table tennis, billiards,
or bowling on the 14-lane alley.
Outside is extensive patio
space for eating, talking, or
studying. One corner of the palio
has radiant heating for evening
comfort. There is a large outdoor
dining and dancing area on each
level.
With the dedication of Tresid
der Memorial Union the Student
Activities Center will be complete.
The old Union cafeteria will bo
serving faculty and a number of
women students who have no
dining hall of their own. The Cel
lar is being remodeled, but its
future use is still indefinite.

The Union is open daily from
8 a.m. to 11 p.m, and students
can buy food, either from the
short-order kitchen or the dining
hall, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.

space for eating, talking, or
studying. One corner of the palio
has radiant heating for evening
comfort. There is a large outdoor
dining and dancing area on each
level.
With the dedication of Tresid
der Memorial Union the Student
Activities Center will be complete.
The old Union cafeteria will bo
serving faculty and a number of
women students who have no
dining hall of their own. The Cel
lar is being remodeled, but its
future use is still indefinite.

The Union is open daily from
8 a.m. to 11 p.m, and students
can buy food, either from the
short-order kitchen or the dining
hall, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.


TRESIDDER MEMORIAL UNION rises on turning concrete stairs around
the trees and shrubbery of its garden. The Union has been in operation since Monday and will be formally dedicated next Saturday.
The days of drinking coffee in
paper cups while standing in the
rain are over: gone, too, are the
days of driving two miles to go
bowling, crowded dances on
creaking fraternity floors, and
date-phobia because of nothing to
do on campus. Tresidder Memori
al Union, the nucleus of the Stu
dent Activities Center, offers stu
dents everything from Beethoven
to billiards.
The student union is no new
idea at Stanford. The old Union—
the men’s and women’s club
houses- -was first suggested in
1909 by Herbert Hoover and was
opened in 1915. The Cellar, dedi
cated in 1922 was Stanford’s first
“community center.” It has been
the social meeting place for 10
student generations.
With the Cellar, the change
was made from clubhouse to com
munity center, but the old union
and the Cellar were too small and
the services limited. In 1946 a
student poll indicated that a now
union was the most important
need on the campus.
WHEN DONALD Tresidder,
Stanford's fourth President, died
suddenly in 1948, it was decided
that a union would be a fitting
memorial for this man known for
his dedication to students.
The planning stage of the union
was long and involved. After
World War 11, the nation, society,
and universities were rapidly
changing. The services had to
meet the wider range of interests

of today’s students.
Work on the s2.(i million Tresid
der finally began last fall. While
the completion of Tresidder has
been delayed by a contractors’
strike, the building was opened
officially Monday. Dedication
ceremonies are scheduled for
Saturday, Sept. 29, and it is ex
pected that the remaining con
struction will be completed by
that time.
The upper level of Tresidder
houses administrative and stu
dent offices, music-listening and
reading rooms, an information
center, a central ticket sales of
fice, conference rooms and pro
gram lounges.
ON THK MAIN level are a 10-
chair barber shop, a travel agen
cy, a store, and a dining area
which can handle 700 people at
once. For recreation, students
may choose table tennis, billiards,
or bowling on the 14-lane alley.
