At the Stanford Health Center’s new treatment wing 2,345
persons yesterday were immunized against Type 1 polio with
Sabin oral vaccine.

“This is at least 1,000 more persons than we had dared to hope
for,” said Dr. George Houck, Health Service director. The K.O.

Polio operation marked the first-*
general use of the $20,000 addition
to the Health Service plant com
pleted this summer.
DISTRIBUTION will continue
today, tomorrow, and Wednesday
in a tent on the lawn of Encina
Hall, opposite the registration
Pavilion. All students, university
faculty and staff members, and
area residents are urged to par
ticipate in this mass innoculation
effort. A donation of 25 cents will
he asked of each person to help
pay for the program’s cost.
The Health Service, aided by
Student Health Committee mem
bers and Stanford Mothers' Club
volunteers, is cooperating with
“Operation KO Polio,” in which
the 3.5 million residents of the
Bay area will be immunized
against all three types of polio.

three types take place at the same
time? The antibodies of the very
rare Type II could overgrow and
nullify those of the other typos.
Therefore, for full protection, im
munization against the three
types of polio must be spaced four
to six weeks apart. At Stanford
Type 111 vaccine will be distrib
uted on Sunday, Nov. 4, Type II
on Sunday. Dec. 9.
Winter and Spring clinics will
be set up for transfer students
and those who miss vaccination
this fall. The Health Service hopes
to have immunized the entire
campus by next June.

Dr. Maurice Osborne, executive
director of the Health Service,
told The Daily, “Salk Vaccine has
a 20-2 per cent chance of doing
an inadequate Job of immuniza
tion." Sabin’s vaccine, unlike
Salk’s, he explained, is a live vi
rus vaccine. It kills any polio vi
rus which may be living in your
intestinal tract, and prevents you
from being a carrier of the dis
ease.
And as far as we know,” he
added, “it offers permanent im
munity against all three types of
polio.”
