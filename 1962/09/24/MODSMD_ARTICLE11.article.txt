# Trustees Reaffirm Control Over Farm Liquor Policy
## Married Students in Stanford, Escondido Villages Exempted 
### DEAN SAVAGE Contributing Editor 
There will be no liquor for Stanford undergraduates on campus
this year. President J. E. Wallace Sterling made this clear Saturday
in a talk to Resident Assistants, living group officials, Men’s and
Women’s Council members, and student government leaders.
However, the board of trustees agreed earlier this month to per-

Mit use of liquor in accordance
with state law by married stu
dents in Escondido and Stanford
villages.
President Sterling said he ex
pected no early changes exempt
ing additional students from the
campus liquor ban.

NOW THE STUDENTS must
decide what responsibility they
choose to assume in enforcement
of the University’s liquor policy,

Sterling said, adding that ho is
willing to discuss the issue with
students.

The Daily has learned that one
plan being considered by the ad
ministration for use in case stu
dent judicial groups refuse to
prosecute student liquor viola
tions is the hiring of proctors.
They would act as private detec
tives, ferreting out liquor viola
tors and reporting them directly
to the administration for disci
plinary action.
Student judicial bodies, how
ever, may find themselves legally
barred from handling cases con
cerning violation of the Univer
sity liquor policy. The referen
dum approved by student voters
and now a part of the constitu
tion reads; “ no judicial

council of the University shall
punish a student for possession,
transportation, or use of intoxi
cating liquors where the State
Law has not been violated.”
STERLING stated that the Uni
versity trustees decided at a July
meeting to preserve and enforce
the traditional liquor policy—no
liquor on campus.
Last year, Sterling said, refer
ring to the referendum, student
leadership found itself, or got it
self, working against the admin
istration and the purposes of Uni
versity policy.
“This development,” he said,
“possibly aided and abetted by in
discreet faculty, held to the the
ory that the administration reacts
best to pressure, the sharper and
more embarrassing the better.”
THIS THEORY has some merit
but is not infallible. Pressure is
what the administration is most
accustomed to, Sterling said.
According to the founding
grant, University policy is the ex
clusive function of the trustees.
Nowhere is there a formal re
quirement that advice of students
be sought. In practice, their
voices have been heard; the ex
tent of their influence depends
upon their judgment, integrity,
and reliability.
Sterling was asked about the
legality of liquor in faculty homes
on campus. I do not propose to
monitor faculty homes, he replied.
