# Top of Arc Down For Reinforcement
## 
### 
Students and tourists alike are detouring around Stanford’s
Memorial Court arch, the top of which lies in numii pieces in
Inner Quad while construction work goes on.
Although there will be no change in the outside appearance of the
arch, its inner construction will be reinforced with 45 tons of steel.
The free-standing structure, which connects the oast and west
portions of the Inner Quad, is undergoing its first overhaul since the
University was built in 1887. Its massive structure even withstood the
earthquake of 1906. Early-day wooden roof beams will be replaced
by steel. Columns will be cored out, fitted with steel center beams and
replaced.
THE PROJECT involves tearing down the arches stone by stone
and numbering them, erecting a structural steel framework to sup
port the weight of the arches, sawing away portions of stones which
will come in contact with steel, and replacing all the stones.
The $113,000 project will be topped off with a new roof, new in
terior lights and a lower ceiling. The intricate carving over the
archways, executed by the best stone-masons Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford could find, will be carefully protected.
Two members of the Stanford engineering faculty, James B.
Wells, professor of civil engineering emeritus, and Jack Benjamin,
professor of structural engineering, drew plans for the overhaul.
The project follows a similar one completed during the summer
of 1958, when the east and west arcades of Memorial Court were re
habilitated with steel supports and a new roof.
