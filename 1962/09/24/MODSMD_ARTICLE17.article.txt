The Warhawks are at it again. And with the aid of the more
wild-eyed members of the press.
They would have us invade Cuba and depose the tyrant.
Those crying out for an invasion by tin* U.S. Marines (notably
Senator Capehart of Indiana) do more than ignore international
law as declared in our treaty commitments with South American
and Latin American governments. They ignore the practical conse
quences of an American invasion all the while they are urging in
vasion for a practical rather than moral reason: Castro, they say,
is a threat to U.S. security.
He is a menace, it is argued, because he has the most powerful
armed force in Latin America and because he may allow the
Russians to build sites for ground to ground missiles aimed at the
U.S. Admittedly, Castro has the greatest military force in the Carib
bean, but so what? Cuba will not attack the U.S. because Cuba
has no interest in committing suicide. And Cuba will not invade
any other Latin American country because Cuba knows that such
an action would be just the pretext the U.S. wants to conquer the
island and remove Castro. The Cubans know how to protect their
self-interest.
As for Russian ICBM’s being planted on the island, both
Castro and the Russians realize that preparations for building mis
sile sites could not be concealed from either U.S. intelligence or
anti-Castro, Cuban intelligence and that the U.S. would demolish
the island if construction of sites began.
The moderates in Congress oppose an American invasion be
cause they estimate that half of the governments in Latin America
woidd be overthrown in the wake of popular, pro-Castro riots.
This is a practical consequence which the political “realists” in
Congress ignore. They woidd scorn international law and exalt the
self-interest of the U.S., even while they are mistaking our self
interest.
