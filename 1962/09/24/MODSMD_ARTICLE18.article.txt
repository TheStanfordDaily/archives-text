# Orientation
## 
### 
Those persons present in Frost Amphitheater for Friday eve
ningâ€™s combined picnic, songfest, and speechfest had an unusual
opportunity. They had the chance to observe two kinds of univer
sity life, the Rally Com Stanford and the university. The dichotomy
between the two was evident when in the midst of a Rah Rail
High School atmosphere the Presidents of the ASSU, HR, and
Political Union attempted to orient frenshmen along lines more
subtle than those of the Scalp Song (Go, you Stanford Red/Go
out and light, fight, fight to victory/Showem Stanford Red).
The student body President, HR President, and Political Union
President made their remarks while Band members fell out of
trees and radios blared the account of the Tulane-Stanford game.
That their remarks were sandwiched between the ball game and
the songfest was a result of poor planning by tbe Pre-registration
Committee. Songfests and serious addresses distract from each
other.

Nevertheless, the contrast was revealing, if not fortunate. The
challenge, presented by Annin Rosencranz and W. Scott Thomp
son, to the intellect and energy of the freshman class contrasted
markedly to the joe High School Idea which Rally Commission so
eagerly seeks to perpetuate. If the Rally Com Idea must have its
place in the freshman orientation (a moot point, at that), the
students in charge of orientation might give vent to tbe Rally Com
Idea at a function where there are not to be serious speeches. At
very least, the student body President and others might be given
a different and more appropriate platform for their remarks.
Ideally, Rally Com would some day just disappear from the
Stanford campus when their Idea ceases to interest anyone. Until
then, the Commission will be endured, and hopefully they will
not distract too many people in the meantime.
Until their extinction they serve a useful purpose as an example
of an extant species of students whose development was arrested
after high school graduation.
