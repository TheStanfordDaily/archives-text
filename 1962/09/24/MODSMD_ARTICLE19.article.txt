Editor, The Daily:
A note concerning something
that most seem to regard as being
“important”; The Campus Liquor
Policy.
The fault in this case does not
lie with (he University, but rather
within the framework of that oft
cursed villain Society. The Univer
sity did not create the problem
concerning alcohol, in fact it is
very difficult to say who did. I
can’t understand how drinking
ever assumed such an importance
in our lives as to merit concen
trated attention, let alone legisla
tion. I think that the policy should
stand as it is, as a minor monu
ment to human idiocy.
The whole furor is so ridiculous
that it barely deserves notice. Our
apparent reverence for liquor is
comic, especially since the Vol
stead Act, a legislative stupidity
from which the country has not
yet recovered.

The concept of a “legal drink
ing age” is not only silly, but its
effect is so obviously opposite to
the one it is intended to have.
Drinking would not be the High
School Status symbol that it is
were it not called illegal for any
one under the magic age of twen
ty-one to sip the Holy potion.
An especially annoying part of
our crassly stupid liquor legisla
tion is that a male, age eighteen,
is deemed a fit absorbant for bay
onets and shrapnel, yet cannot or
der a cup of Irish Coffee. This
fact alone makes our liquor laws
beneath contempt. Thus any
campus liquor policy is only a
silly little subdivision of an unfor
tunate situation.
The idea that the earth is a flat,
stationary object in a terracentric
universe is a groat deal more in
telligent and less harmful than
the prevailing attitude toward
liquor. M. L. Humphrey
