##

Four university buildings are
changing character this fall to
make space for more undergrad
uate women.
The former Women’s Rest
Home is now known as Houston.
Mariposa has been changed from
a graduate women’s residence to
an undergraduate residence. They
are under the joint direction of
Mrs. Doris Flickinger, who will
live in Houston. Vicky Berger

THE FORMER Men’s Rest
Home is now The Elms, a grad
uate women’s residence. Rogers

These changes have been made
necessary by the return of more
undergraduate women than was
expected. Of the 35 women who
live in Houston and Mariposa

or arc transfer students.
House organizations in these
residences will be starting from
scratch. All officers will be elect

DINING facilities will be pro
vided in a separate room at the
Encina Dining Room for the pres

The patients who would have
gone to the rest homes last year
will now go to the isolation hos
pital, on Alpine Road, which is
being converted to accommodate
them. The top floor will be as
signed to convalescent women
students, and the bottom floor to
men.
These changes are temporary,
but it is not now known whether
such facilities will continue to be
necessary, according Assistant
Dean of Women, Bonnie Fitz
water.
The Stanford Mothers Club,
which has traditionally managed
and supported the Men’s and
women’s rest homes, will continue
