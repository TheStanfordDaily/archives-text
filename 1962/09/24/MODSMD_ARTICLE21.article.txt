# HELSINKI
## Participant Discusses Background, Plans for Communist Youth Festival 
### RON BASS Contributing editor 
Those of you who have not yet
repressed spring quarter may re
call a brief flurry of excitement
and confusion surrounding some
thing called Project Helsinki. The
basic idea of this project was one
of purity and simplicity. Honest.
See, the Communists were going
to hold a Youth Festival in Fin
land. We wanted to send people
who would show the participants
that there were Americans who
cared about them, knew some
thing of their problems, and were
concerned about their future.
Simple. Many concurred that it
was very simple indeed.
A few difficulties arose. The
trip would cost money. Three
people named Thompson, Meister
and Sherwood began to look for
it. They also needed someone to
spend it on. A team of interview
ers culled through the 400 applica
tion forms, grilled each applicant
personally, and cut the list down
to a preliminary sixty-five. Of
these, twenty-five were selected
to apply for official accreditation
through the United States Festi
val Committee. Many declined,
concerned over possible future
complications.
HUAC may claim to view the
Festival Committee through rose
colored glasses, but rose is a
rather deep shade of pink. The
courageous applied for delegate
status anyway, while we sell-outs
joined a rather nebulous group of
40 who would be sent as in
dividual observers.
Another major problem was
publicity. With the knowledge
that the true purpose of the Fes
tival was the dissemination of
propaganda, a piece of info that
no one but the CIA looked on as
really Top Secret, we were indeed
going to Helsinki for purposes
that were in direct conflict with
the Communists’ goals. Since the
Red goon squads were likely to be
less than gracious hosts, there
was little to be gained by shouting
about anti-propaganda plans. We
might have had a warmer wel
come in Helsinki if we had mas
queraded as fellow-travellers, but
this was precluded by the possi
bility that some of us may want
to get a job in this country at a
future date. Clearly, the only way
out was to keep the group’s col
lective mouth shut.
The list of participants was con
stantly reduced as money proved
hard to come by. A few donors
were extremely generous. Others
pledged, hedged, reneged, recon
sidered, compromised, and re
neged again.
ENTER DENNIS Shaul, execu
tive head of the Independent Re
search Service, an organization
that had sent 150 students to the
Vienna Festival in ’59. He offered
an opportunity to join the IRS
team, a set of bright young people
with a good deal of Festival know
how. He also offered money.
This was followed by a few rather
grim weeks for those in charge of
our program, the original list had
been cut to 36 and was still
dropping slightly, hut the word
was out that we would go to Hel
sinki.
The training program began
with a mandatory reading list.

The reading was backed up by a
seven-day, lecture series. The
speakers Were truly superb. In
cluded were Dr. Robert North (ap
peals of Communism to underde
veloped nations), Dr. Claude Buss
(Asia), Peter Duignan (Africa),
Irving Howe (American culture),
Dr. James Blackwell (race prob
lem in America), Dennis Doolen
(Sino-Soviet split). Dr. Wayne
Vuclnich (Yugoslavia), Dr. James
Liu (Red China), Dr. Stein of
Princeton (Cuba), Dr. Christina
Harris (Middle East), Dr. Robert
Bush (American education), Dr.
Theodore Kreps (American econ
omy), Dr. John Bunzel (democ
racy), Dr. Milo Drachovitch
(Eastern Europe), Tim Harding
(Latin America), Ole Holsti (dis
armament and nuclear testing),
Jerry Berg (Finland), and Jim
Morrison (Poland).
THE SOVIET Union received
the most thorough coverage, with

lectures by Dr. Harold Fisher (So
viet foreign policy), Henry Sha
piro (domestic policy), David
Finley (government), Dr. Charles
Drekmeier (Marxinsm-Leninism),
Dr. Alexander Riassonovsky (in
ternal affairs), and Steve Michel
son (economics).
Prof. Bablis tested us on our
one-upmanship techniques, Peter
Grothe fired angry questions in
his thickest Russian accent, Den
nie Shaul flew in from New York
to brief us on world student move
ments and to show an NBC docu
mentary film on the Vienna Fes
tival. The reading continued.
Pamphlets on techniques of Com
munism, bulletins on disarma
ment proposals, books on China,
Cuba, Africa and Finland, statis
tics on integration, comparative
living standards, and foreign aid.
(This is the first part of a
series on the Helsinki World
Youth Festival.)

was out that we would go to Hel
sinki.
The training program began
with a mandatory reading list.

The reading was backed up by a
seven-day, lecture series. The
speakers Were truly superb. In
cluded were Dr. Robert North (ap
peals of Communism to underde
veloped nations), Dr. Claude Buss
(Asia), Peter Duignan (Africa),
Irving Howe (American culture),
Dr. James Blackwell (race prob
lem in America), Dennis Doolen
(Sino-Soviet split). Dr. Wayne
Vuclnich (Yugoslavia), Dr. James
Liu (Red China), Dr. Stein of
Princeton (Cuba), Dr. Christina
Harris (Middle East), Dr. Robert
Bush (American education), Dr.
Theodore Kreps (American econ
omy), Dr. John Bunzel (democ
racy), Dr. Milo Drachovitch
(Eastern Europe), Tim Harding
(Latin America), Ole Holsti (dis
armament and nuclear testing),
Jerry Berg (Finland), and Jim
Morrison (Poland).
THE SOVIET Union received
the most thorough coverage, with

lectures by Dr. Harold Fisher (So
viet foreign policy), Henry Sha
piro (domestic policy), David
Finley (government), Dr. Charles
Drekmeier (Marxinsm-Leninism),
Dr. Alexander Riassonovsky (in
ternal affairs), and Steve Michel
son (economics).
Prof. Bablis tested us on our
one-upmanship techniques, Peter
Grothe fired angry questions in
his thickest Russian accent, Den
nie Shaul flew in from New York
to brief us on world student move
ments and to show an NBC docu
mentary film on the Vienna Fes
tival. The reading continued.
Pamphlets on techniques of Com
munism, bulletins on disarma
ment proposals, books on China,
Cuba, Africa and Finland, statis
tics on integration, comparative
living standards, and foreign aid.
(This is the first part of a
series on the Helsinki World
Youth Festival.)
Those of you who have not yet
repressed spring quarter may re
call a brief flurry of excitement
and confusion surrounding some
thing called Project Helsinki. The
basic idea of this project was one
of purity and simplicity. Honest.
See, the Communists were going
to hold a Youth Festival in Fin
land. We wanted to send people
who would show the participants
that there were Americans who
cared about them, knew some
thing of their problems, and were
concerned about their future.
Simple. Many concurred that it
was very simple indeed.
A few difficulties arose. The
trip would cost money. Three
people named Thompson, Meister
and Sherwood began to look for
it. They also needed someone to
spend it on. A team of interview
ers culled through the 400 applica
tion forms, grilled each applicant
personally, and cut the list down
to a preliminary sixty-five. Of
these, twenty-five were selected
to apply for official accreditation
through the United States Festi
val Committee. Many declined,
concerned over possible future
complications.
HUAC may claim to view the
Festival Committee through rose
colored glasses, but rose is a
rather deep shade of pink. The
courageous applied for delegate
status anyway, while we sell-outs
joined a rather nebulous group of
40 who would be sent as in
dividual observers.
Another major problem was
publicity. With the knowledge
that the true purpose of the Fes
tival was the dissemination of
propaganda, a piece of info that
no one but the CIA looked on as
really Top Secret, we were indeed
going to Helsinki for purposes
that were in direct conflict with
the Communists’ goals. Since the
Red goon squads were likely to be
less than gracious hosts, there
was little to be gained by shouting
about anti-propaganda plans. We
might have had a warmer wel
come in Helsinki if we had mas
queraded as fellow-travellers, but
this was precluded by the possi
bility that some of us may want
to get a job in this country at a
future date. Clearly, the only way
out was to keep the group’s col
lective mouth shut.
The list of participants was con
stantly reduced as money proved
hard to come by. A few donors
were extremely generous. Others
pledged, hedged, reneged, recon
sidered, compromised, and re
neged again.

tive head of the Independent Re
search Service, an organization
that had sent 150 students to the
Vienna Festival in ’59. He offered
an opportunity to join the IRS
team, a set of bright young people
with a good deal of Festival know
how. He also offered money.

grim weeks for those in charge of
our program, the original list had

through the United States Festi
val Committee. Many declined,
concerned over possible future
complications.
HUAC may claim to view the
Festival Committee through rose
colored glasses, but rose is a
rather deep shade of pink. The
courageous applied for delegate
status anyway, while we sell-outs
joined a rather nebulous group of
40 who would be sent as in
dividual observers.
Another major problem was
publicity. With the knowledge
that the true purpose of the Fes
tival was the dissemination of
propaganda, a piece of info that
no one but the CIA looked on as
really Top Secret, we were indeed
going to Helsinki for purposes
that were in direct conflict with
the Communists’ goals. Since the
Red goon squads were likely to be
less than gracious hosts, there
was little to be gained by shouting
about anti-propaganda plans. We
might have had a warmer wel
come in Helsinki if we had mas
queraded as fellow-travellers, but
this was precluded by the possi
bility that some of us may want
to get a job in this country at a
future date. Clearly, the only way
out was to keep the group’s col
lective mouth shut.
The list of participants was con
stantly reduced as money proved
hard to come by. A few donors
were extremely generous. Others
pledged, hedged, reneged, recon
sidered, compromised, and re
neged again.
ENTER DENNIS Shaul, execu
tive head of the Independent Re
search Service, an organization
that had sent 150 students to the
Vienna Festival in ’59. He offered
an opportunity to join the IRS
team, a set of bright young people
with a good deal of Festival know
how. He also offered money.
This was followed by a few rather
grim weeks for those in charge of
our program, the original list had
been cut to 36 and was still
dropping slightly, hut the word
was out that we would go to Hel
sinki.
The training program began
with a mandatory reading list.

The reading was backed up by a
seven-day, lecture series. The
speakers Were truly superb. In
cluded were Dr. Robert North (ap
peals of Communism to underde
veloped nations), Dr. Claude Buss
(Asia), Peter Duignan (Africa),
Irving Howe (American culture),
Dr. James Blackwell (race prob
lem in America), Dennis Doolen
(Sino-Soviet split). Dr. Wayne
Vuclnich (Yugoslavia), Dr. James
Liu (Red China), Dr. Stein of
Princeton (Cuba), Dr. Christina
Harris (Middle East), Dr. Robert
Bush (American education), Dr.
Theodore Kreps (American econ
omy), Dr. John Bunzel (democ
racy), Dr. Milo Drachovitch
(Eastern Europe), Tim Harding
(Latin America), Ole Holsti (dis
armament and nuclear testing),
Jerry Berg (Finland), and Jim
Morrison (Poland).
THE SOVIET Union received
the most thorough coverage, with

lectures by Dr. Harold Fisher (So
viet foreign policy), Henry Sha
piro (domestic policy), David
Finley (government), Dr. Charles
Drekmeier (Marxinsm-Leninism),
Dr. Alexander Riassonovsky (in
ternal affairs), and Steve Michel
son (economics).
Prof. Bablis tested us on our
one-upmanship techniques, Peter
Grothe fired angry questions in
his thickest Russian accent, Den
nie Shaul flew in from New York
to brief us on world student move
ments and to show an NBC docu
mentary film on the Vienna Fes
tival. The reading continued.
Pamphlets on techniques of Com
munism, bulletins on disarma
ment proposals, books on China,
Cuba, Africa and Finland, statis
tics on integration, comparative
living standards, and foreign aid.
(This is the first part of a
series on the Helsinki World
Youth Festival.)
Those of you who have not yet
repressed spring quarter may re
call a brief flurry of excitement
and confusion surrounding some
thing called Project Helsinki. The
basic idea of this project was one
of purity and simplicity. Honest.
See, the Communists were going
to hold a Youth Festival in Fin
land. We wanted to send people
who would show the participants
that there were Americans who
cared about them, knew some
thing of their problems, and were
concerned about their future.
Simple. Many concurred that it
was very simple indeed.
A few difficulties arose. The
trip would cost money. Three
people named Thompson, Meister
and Sherwood began to look for
it. They also needed someone to
spend it on. A team of interview
ers culled through the 400 applica
tion forms, grilled each applicant
personally, and cut the list down
to a preliminary sixty-five. Of
these, twenty-five were selected
to apply for official accreditation
through the United States Festi
val Committee. Many declined,
