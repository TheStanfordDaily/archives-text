## On Determining a 'Fool': Where Can He Speak? 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
President Sterling stated at a
meeting with a group of student
leaders recently that the Univer
sity has a right and responsibility
to deny the “platform of the Uni
versity” to “fools.”
This is, I feel, an interesting
statement. Presumably, Dr. Ster
ling meant by “the platform of
the University,” the sanction
granted to any group or individu
al, by the University, to have a
voice on campus, especially in
some official capacity, or as a
group organized under the stu
dent constitution.
I AGREE with Dr. Sterling that,
indeed, the University has a seri
ous right and responsibility in
this matter. But how can the Uni
versity most successfully decide
who is a fool.
There is no need to belabor the
obvious with a lengthy list of his
torical figures who eai’ned the
epithet “fool” sometime during
their lives, and w’ho later proved
to be among the great men of
their times. The mention of a few
puts the matter in proper perspec
tive. Starting with Socrates, and
including men like Christ and
Ghandi and Galileo and Edison,
we could perhaps end our brief
list of “fools” with the names of
the Founding Fathers whose fool
hardy natures led them to fight
for a half-formed, radical princi
ple of government: men who dis
sented, and violently, for the sake
of something the world has come
to see as perhaps the gi’eatest the
ory of government yet conceived.
What fools of this nature are
we possibly denying our platform
to? Who can say whether this or
that man be a fool or a prophet?

But perhaps another side of this
question should be examined. Is
it not possible that any great in
stitution in a democracy must be
willing to take a chance on fools?
Dr. Rhinelander, in his address to
the freshmen, described one of
the roles of a university as that
of social critic.
HE SUGGESTED that, while
the process of education, by its
very nature, exists to insure the
preservation of what is the soci
ety at any given moment in time,
it is possible that the function of
constructive critic also can best
be served by universities.
Dr. Rhinelander stressed the
need, a crying need of our times,
for democracy to be constantly on
the alert to its shortcomings, and
never to lose sight of its goals
and ideals in the urgent business
of fighting for its life.
There are men in and around
this University who might be con
sidered fools by some. Yet who—
having seen the strength of soul
and personal integrity of an Ira
Sandperl, for example—who can
deny that he has a message for
our society which, whether or not
we agree with it. we have a duty
to listen to?
WHO WOULD feel wise
enough to judge the value of a
professor who holds a “dissent
ing” opinion, a value perhaps not
to his academic department par
ticularly, but rather to minds
which need to be challenged by
the sight of a strong commitment
to values contrary to their own?
Another presumption can be
made: that the decision of who is
and who is not a fool is largely,
at this University, Dr. Sterling’s,
i We cannot fail to respect his in
tegrity. We must trust his wisdom
and foresight, and hope that he
can prove an exception to that
unfortunate historical rule, which
has seen so many regret that they
said, “Thou fool.”

I AGREE with Dr. Sterling that,
indeed, the University has a seri
ous right and responsibility in
this matter. But how can the Uni
versity most successfully decide
who is a fool.
There is no need to belabor the
obvious with a lengthy list of his
torical figures who eai’ned the
epithet “fool” sometime during
their lives, and w’ho later proved
to be among the great men of
their times. The mention of a few
puts the matter in proper perspec
tive. Starting with Socrates, and
including men like Christ and
Ghandi and Galileo and Edison,
we could perhaps end our brief
list of “fools” with the names of
the Founding Fathers whose fool
hardy natures led them to fight
for a half-formed, radical princi
ple of government: men who dis
sented, and violently, for the sake
of something the world has come
to see as perhaps the gi’eatest the
ory of government yet conceived.
What fools of this nature are
we possibly denying our platform
to? Who can say whether this or
that man be a fool or a prophet?

But perhaps another side of this
question should be examined. Is
it not possible that any great in
stitution in a democracy must be
willing to take a chance on fools?
Dr. Rhinelander, in his address to
the freshmen, described one of
the roles of a university as that
of social critic.
HE SUGGESTED that, while
the process of education, by its
very nature, exists to insure the
preservation of what is the soci
ety at any given moment in time,
it is possible that the function of
constructive critic also can best
be served by universities.
Dr. Rhinelander stressed the
need, a crying need of our times,
for democracy to be constantly on
the alert to its shortcomings, and
never to lose sight of its goals
and ideals in the urgent business
of fighting for its life.
There are men in and around
this University who might be con
sidered fools by some. Yet who—
having seen the strength of soul
and personal integrity of an Ira
Sandperl, for example—who can
deny that he has a message for
our society which, whether or not
we agree with it. we have a duty
to listen to?
WHO WOULD feel wise
enough to judge the value of a
professor who holds a “dissent
ing” opinion, a value perhaps not
to his academic department par
ticularly, but rather to minds
which need to be challenged by
the sight of a strong commitment
to values contrary to their own?
Another presumption can be
made: that the decision of who is
and who is not a fool is largely,
at this University, Dr. Sterling’s,
i We cannot fail to respect his in
tegrity. We must trust his wisdom
and foresight, and hope that he
can prove an exception to that
unfortunate historical rule, which
has seen so many regret that they
said, “Thou fool.”
President Sterling stated at a
meeting with a group of student
leaders recently that the Univer
sity has a right and responsibility
to deny the “platform of the Uni
versity” to “fools.”
This is, I feel, an interesting
statement. Presumably, Dr. Ster
ling meant by “the platform of
the University,” the sanction
granted to any group or individu
al, by the University, to have a
voice on campus, especially in
some official capacity, or as a
group organized under the stu
dent constitution.
