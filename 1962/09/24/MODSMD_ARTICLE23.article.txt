Editor, The Daily:
A fellow alumnus has sent me
the book review in the Stanford
Daily of June 1, 1962. In it, Pro
fessor Wasserstrom reviews Pro
fessor Packer’s book, “F Commu
nist Witnesses.” We fi; q ihe usu
al pattern of one liberal professor
scratching the back of another
liberal professor.
Because of the importance of
the subject and the injury which
could be done to efforts to safe
guard the national security if this
subject were presented in a ten
dentious, biased, or simply erro
neous manner, it is unfortunate
that it was not reviewed by some
one who did not have to start
from a condition of almost com
plete unfamiliarity with the mat
ter at hand, which was patently
Professor Wasserstrom’s predic
ament. But a more knowledgeable
reviewer might have been critical
of Professor Packer’s perform
ance, and certainly would have
been able to point out some of his
peculiar omissions; and a critical
analysis was perhaps the last
thing The Stanford Daily wanted
to print.
So much for the Packer book.
Now, I would like to propose that
The Stanford Daily print a re
view of another book. It is “The

Committee and Its Critics: A
Calm Review of The House Com
mittee on Un-American Activi
ties,” recently published by G. P.
Putnam’s Sons, New York. It is a
symposium by William F. Buck
ley, Jr., the Editors of National
Review, and three other writers
(C. Dickerman Williams, former
director of the American Civil
Liberties Union and former gen
eral counsel of the Department of
Commerce, Irving Ferman, for
mer chief counsel of the American
Civil Liberties Union, and my
self).
I am aware that snap judg
ments on this subject abound on
the Stanford campus, in the usual
conformity with the prevailing
liberal orthodoxy; so you would
be helping to bring some balance
to the campus if you would call at
tention to this book and its com
prehensive treatment of the sub
ject.
1 would suggest that Mr. Frank
P. Adams, 2610 Russ Building,
San Francisco, who is a distin
guished lawyer and Stanford
alumnus, could be asked to write
a review for you. He has read the
book, I happen to know, and
would be well qualified to review
it if he would be willing to do so.
I have not discussed this with him.
George N. Crocker
