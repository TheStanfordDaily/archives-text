# Arminin's Address to Freshmen
## 
### 
(The text of an address given
to the freshman class Friday eve
ning by ASSU President Annin
Rosencranz follows. Its substance
is essentially the same message
delivered to transfer students Sat
urday morning.)

On behalf of the entire Stan
ford student body, I am pleased
to welcome you into our ranks.
There are three preliminary
words that I would like to offer
you. Tonight and in the next few
days many people will urge you
to go all out for extra curricular
activities. Don’t do it. Don't do it
unless you’re absolutely con
vinced that you can handle it. We
all must be agreed on the com
mon purpose that has brought us
to Stanford, which, of course, is
to get an education. Activities
often aid that purpose, but your
own judgment must keep you
from passing the point of dimin
ishing returns.
THE SECOND preliminary
word of advice is that although
there is a wide variety of groups
on campus, it is entirely conceiv
able that you will not find a group
that suits you. This may be par
ticularly true in the area of liter
ary, artistic, and musical en
deavors. I suggest that if this
need arises, form a group of your
own. Stanford is a big campus and
has plenty of room for every kind
of organization.
Third, I ask you to remember
that between the greatest and
least of everyone at Stanford
there is little space indeed. Many
student leaders may appear quite
imposing to your eyes, but I urge
you to always recall what I have
just said—that there is far less
space between the greatest and
the least than any of you will in
itially suppose.
EARLIER this week you were
asked to look with gratitude to
the past—to the generations of
Stanford who have brought the
University to its present great
ness. I urge you also to look with
deep concern to the future. What
you do these four years will sure
ly have a profound effect on the
future of Stanford University and
on the generations of students yet
to come here.
This University seeks to be, and
in many respects is, a great uni
versity. Surely Senator and Mrs.
Stanford had that hope when they
established and endowed Stanford
University. I ask you now to con
sider with me what makes the
University great. People may dif
fer on the precise marks of great
ness, but we are all agreed that
liquor on the Stanford campus
will not make Stanford great.
Of infinitely more significance
is the academic achievement of
our faculty and student body.
Such achievement will certainly
mold Stanford’s greatness. Full
participation in the world student
community will also make this
University great. A willingness to
leave behind obsolete standards
and policies which we have in
herited from the 19th century
will make Stanford groat.
AND FINALLY, a fearlessness
on the part of the Student Body
and their student government to
speak out and take stands against
things which they deem unjust
will make Stanford great.
I offer you four freedoms which
it will be the task of student gov
ernment at Stanford to attain.
The first is the freedom to par
ticipate in university policy de
liberations and decision-making
which affect students. The as
sumption which I make is that the
best of our students are mature,
responsible, and wise enough to
collaborate with the faculty and
administration on these matters.
What they lack in years they
make up in enthusiasm and de
termination.
The second freedom is complete
academic freedom at Stanford. I
moan freedom for anybody who
has anything to say that is worth
hearing. This includes radicals
and reactionaries; theologians and
atheists) pacifists and patriots. A
great university is surely secure
enough to withstand any amount
of dissent.
THE THIRD freedom is the
freedom to govern our own non
academic lives; and the fourth is
the freedom to emerge from the
lethargy and the apathy that
binds our generation.
Our generation is the one born
or at least raised during World
War 11. It is also the generation
some of whose members yester
day chanted “Nigger, nigger, nig
ger,” when a colored boy sought
admission to the University of
Mississippi. It is up to us to rescue

our generation.
All over the world students are
suffering and searching. Here the
search is largely for good times
and we are too fat and too lazy to
suffer. We must be concerned
with the rest of the world. We
must feel the sufferings of the
students in Iran, Spain, Angola,
Paraguay, and of course all those
students under Communist con
trol for whom academic freedom
and student autonomy are in
credibly distant visions. We must
say to ourselves, “There, but for
the accident of geography and
birth, go I.”
AMONG the most important
and most sacred of the rights of
free students is the right to speak
out against injustice. Students are
asleep. We have slept on our
rights. But we are a sleeping
giant; and I see it as one of the
duties of student government to
join with the faculty in awaken
ing this sleeping giant.
Wo must awake and empathize
with students all over the world
who are being imprisoned and
tortured for passively resisting
government authority. We must
empathize with students in our
own country who are conducting
sit-ins and boycotts merely to at
tain human dignity. There is in
justice all over the world. We
can’t fight it with a drink in ohe
hand and a dock of cards in the
other.
Accordingly, I urge you to tear
down some of the walls which
surround you; tear down the walls
of parental insulation; tear down
the walls preventing you from
communicating with the world
and feeling its heart; tear down
the walls preventing you from
understanding and loving the peo

pie and students in the have-not
nations of the world—the two
thirds of the world without suffi
cient food, clothing, and shelter
to lead decent lives.
THE PEOPLE of the world are
looking to America, even to us at
Stanford, to redeem them from
poverty and from intellectual
bondage. This is the task of stu
dents at a great university.
You have hoard some perplex
ing tplk of rights and responsibili
ties. The rights that I have spoken
about are not given to us by the
President’s office or by the Ad
ministration. They are ours by
birth.
I urge you finally to reflect
upon the words of the Stanford
motto: The Winds of Freedom
Blow. You can assure that those
words are not a passing irony.
You can ma|<e those words ring
true. In this way, a would-be great
university can and will be a great
university.
This is the grand hope, the fine
endeavor, the splendid possibility
of achievement, to which the Stu
dent Body summons you and bids
you welcome to Stanford.

U.S. ’COPTERS FIRED OX
TRA VINH. South Viet Nam
(UPI» Communist ground fire
yesterday hit three U.S. Army
helicopters during a South Viet
namese sweep against the rebels,
forcing one to land near a rebel
strongpoint.
One Vienamtese officer was se
riously wounded by the ground
fire, but there were no American
casualties. Two of the helicopters
were only slightly damaged by the
bullets. The one forced down was
placed under guard until it could
be repaired and made ready for
flight again.
