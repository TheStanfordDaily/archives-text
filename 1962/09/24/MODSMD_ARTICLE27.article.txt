# Lodato's Long Gallop Edges Greenies 6-3
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
NEW ORLEANS The Indians
had come two thousand miles to
the city of Dixie-land jazz and
Creole pralines to win a football
game, and they succeeded just
barely. For three quarters Friday
night in the Sugar Bowl, Stanford
trailed Tulane’s Green Wave 3-0;
nevertheless, the Indians looked
like a keg of powder, ready to be
set off any minute. Early in the
fourth period, quarterback Clark
Weaver finally provided the neces
sary spark when he called for a
quick pitchout-left with fourth
down and five yards to go; and
halfback J. D. Lodato manufac
tured a 30-yard scoring explosion.
Although the two-point conver
sion failed, the score was 6-3 with
11:10 remaining, and Stanford
looked safe. Except for a very un
fortunate fumble and it couple of
twinkle-toe runs by Tulane back
Terry Terrebonne, Stanford’s de
fense had held the Green Wave
almost at will, allowing only 120
net yards up to then.
BUT STANFORD’S scoring
drive seemed to detonate some
Tulane fireworks. Five plays after
the kickoff, the Greenies, run
ning inside and outside hut always
in the direction of the Indian goal,
had moved 65 yards to Stanford’s
four-yard line.
A goal line defense was called
for by Coach Jack Curtice and
supplied by his beeftrust. Green
Wave runs at left end and right
tackle gained nothing, and a third
down pitchout lost two as Frank
Patitucci and Ed Cummings com
bined for a beautiful, bowling
ball like tackle. On fourth down,
a 23-yard field goal attempt
dropped short due to some mis
handling by the holder and mis
timing by the kicker, and Stan
ford grabbed the ball greedily,
happy to be back on offense.
It was the third time Stanford’s
line, which outweighed the oppo
nents by 215-203 on the average,
had held deep in Indian territory.

In the first quarter, Tulane re
covered a fumble after a punt at
Stanford’s 35 when Patitucci acci
dently let the rolling ball touch
him while trying to throw a block.
In three plays, Tulane moved to
the three, led by Terrebonne’s
gains of 15 and 11 yards. In the
next three plays, however, Stan
ford’s defense pushed the
Greenies hack two yards, forcing
a 12-yard, successful field goal
attempt.
IN THE SECOND quarter, Ter
rebonne returned a punt 15 yards
to the Indian 28. But Stanford
held, with Tim Hansel breaking
up a third down pass by climbing
the back of the intended receiver.
Although a 39-yard field goal was
missed, Tulane still led by 3-0.
Stanford’s offense had generat
ed several drives but only one
scoring threat. Directed by Weav
er, the Indians went from their
own 16 to Tulane’s five in the
second quarter, grinding out those
80 yards in 16 plays. Weaver
varied pitchouts, options, and
straight-ahead runs on this drive,
which sputtered and ended in a
missed, 16-yard field goal try.
At the end of the half as time
ran out, Weaver moved Stanford
35 yards to Tulane’s 46, again en
tirely on the ground. In fact, the
Indians set some kind of a dubi
ous precedent by failing to com
plete a pass in the first half.
(They hit only two of six in the
game.)
EARLY IN the fourth quarter,
Stanford recovered a fumble at
Tulane’s 48. A 15-yard penalty and
an 11-yard screen pass started
Stanford’s third drive. But soon a
fourth down and five situation
came up at the 30-yard line. It

was too far for a field goal and
too close to punt—so go for it.
With everyone expecting a pass
or at least a rollout-option, Weav
er chose the quick pitchout to
sophomore Lodato. Behind a bul
lyish block by 270-pound tackle
Chuck Buehler. Lodato turned left
end; at the 12 he cut in, squirmed
through two defenders at the five
and scored. It was the same play
that worked for a 24-yard touch
down last year against Cal, and
this TD was just as welcome.
In the final minutes, Stanford
picked up 45 more yards to widen
its statistical margin over Tulane.
Meanwhile, the Greenies got no
where trying to pass, as the In
dian secondary performed well to
take its place along with the line
as Stanford’s strongest points.
Besides slight foot injuries to
quarterback Dick Ragsdale and
back Stan Lindskog, there was
one disappointing note to the
game. In the second quarter,
Stanford quarterback Steve Thur
low, about to be dropped for a
loss, lateraled to 236-pound tackle
A1 Hildebrand, who lost an addi
tional four yards. This will prob
ably be Hildebrand’s only chance
to carry the ball in his college
career. His ball carrying record
will be zero attempts, and minus
four yards net, for an eggregious
lifetime rushing average of minus
infinite yardage per carry.


STANFORD’S MOST VALUABLE player last year was fullback-line-backer Ed Cummings. Cummings' timely defensive play was largely
responsible for Stanford's 6-3 football win over Tulane Friday.
