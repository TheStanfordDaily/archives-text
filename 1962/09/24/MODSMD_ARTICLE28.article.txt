# AAWU Gridders Are Unbeaten, Once Tied
## 
### GERALD FRY 
Last weekend there was a full
slate of action in the AAWU.
Down at Los Angeles, Southern
Cal opened its season impressive
ly and thus nullified any Stan

ford hopes that IJ.S.C. might be
weaker than expected. U.S.C.’s
quarterback Bill Nelson hit star
end Hal Bedsole for a 51-yard
touchdown play to slip by power
ful Duke, a team wrich ranked
eighth in the AP pre-season poll,
14-7.
In other AAWU action, Wash
ington State smashed San Jose
State 49-8. Washington State, re
cently admitted to the AAWU,
showed no weakness resulting
from the graduation of their fab
ulous passer Mel Melin. Though
not eligible for the conference
title this year, the Cougars could
go to the Rose Bowl if they have
an impressive enough season.
Ill* AT SEATTLE, Washington
fought powerful Purdue of the
Big Ten to a 7-7 tie. Washington
appears to be as tough as ever.
Though only tying Purdue,
Washington completely dominat
ed the offense. Washington’s of
fense netted 275 total yards to
Purdue's 130. Three Washington
fumbles cost the Huskies dearly.
U.C.L.A. was idle this week and
will open October G against Ohio
State.
More bad news for Tribe fans!
comes from Berkeley, where Cali
fornia gave Missouri a real scare
but finally lost 21-10. Missouri is
ranked in the top ten in pre-sea
son polls. Cal’s two fine passers, i
Larry Ballielt and Randy Gold, \
played splendidly. However, Cal’s J
rushing attack was almost nil.
It appears that Stanford will
have its hands full this season.
U.S.C. and Washington appear to
be very strong and Cal seems
much improved. U.S.C.’s victory
over Duke, the big power in the j
Atlantic Coast conference; Wash-1
ington’s tie with Purdue of the I
Big 10; and Cal’s stand against |
Missouri, the power in the Big 8, |
illustrate one thing: the prestige
of the AAWU as a powerful foot
ball conference will certainly be ,
enhanced this coming season.

of the AAWU as a powerful foot
ball conference will certainly be ,
enhanced this coming season.
Last weekend there was a full
slate of action in the AAWU.
Down at Los Angeles, Southern
Cal opened its season impressive
ly and thus nullified any Stan

ford hopes that IJ.S.C. might be
weaker than expected. U.S.C.’s
quarterback Bill Nelson hit star
end Hal Bedsole for a 51-yard
touchdown play to slip by power
ful Duke, a team wrich ranked
eighth in the AP pre-season poll,
14-7.
In other AAWU action, Wash
ington State smashed San Jose
State 49-8. Washington State, re
cently admitted to the AAWU,
showed no weakness resulting
from the graduation of their fab
ulous passer Mel Melin. Though
not eligible for the conference
title this year, the Cougars could
go to the Rose Bowl if they have
an impressive enough season.
Ill* AT SEATTLE, Washington
fought powerful Purdue of the
Big Ten to a 7-7 tie. Washington
appears to be as tough as ever.
Though only tying Purdue,
Washington completely dominat
ed the offense. Washington’s of
fense netted 275 total yards to
Purdue's 130. Three Washington
fumbles cost the Huskies dearly.
U.C.L.A. was idle this week and
will open October G against Ohio
State.
More bad news for Tribe fans!
comes from Berkeley, where Cali
fornia gave Missouri a real scare
but finally lost 21-10. Missouri is
ranked in the top ten in pre-sea
son polls. Cal’s two fine passers, i
Larry Ballielt and Randy Gold, \
played splendidly. However, Cal’s J
rushing attack was almost nil.
It appears that Stanford will
have its hands full this season.
U.S.C. and Washington appear to
be very strong and Cal seems
much improved. U.S.C.’s victory
over Duke, the big power in the j
Atlantic Coast conference; Wash-1
ington’s tie with Purdue of the I
Big 10; and Cal’s stand against |
Missouri, the power in the Big 8, |
