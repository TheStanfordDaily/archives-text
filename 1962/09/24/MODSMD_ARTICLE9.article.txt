# Sterling Raps Incompetence In Politics
## 
### 
The University will continue to
regulate student political activity,
President Sterling told campus
leaders at a meeting Saturday.
The University has a policy of
academic freedom and non-parti
sanship, but it does not follow
that the University offers itself
as a platform for any viewpoint
students may wish to present, he
said.
What students do in the Uni
versity’s name is the University’s
business. “The University does not
abrogate freedom when, in its
own best judgment, it rejects in
competence, bad manners, or bad
taste,” he said.
No one is omniscient, and it is
particularly difficult for persons
not trained in this field to under
stand the complexities of admin
istering difficulties as they arise,
he added.
STERLING SAID he would not
control what faculty members
pass on to students, but whatever
it be. the administration should
be informed. No faculty member
is entitled to undermine his col
leagues or the administration
through the students.
Sterling spoke strongly in favor
of academic freedom. No matter
what decisions administrators
make, they will bo accused by a
dissident few of sacrificing aca
demic freedom, he said.
The PACE program has pro
vided the material for many such
accusatoins, he explained. It is
utterly ridiculous, he said, to be
lieve that the University caters to
the wealthy. In fact, it has turned
down several offers which includ
ed restrictive clauses.
