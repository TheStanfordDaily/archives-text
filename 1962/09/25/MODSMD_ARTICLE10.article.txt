# Problem of Liquor Policy Unresolved
## 
### 
As the quarter officially opens with classes tomorrow, at least
one issue continues to stand unresolved. In a series of meetings
during the past two weeks, student leaders and University admin
istrators have been seeking to find some solution to the problem
produced when the student body mandates its officers to do one
thing and University policy says+

they must do another.
THE BOARD of Trustees de
cided this summer to continue the
“long standing policy prohibiting
the possession and use of alcohol
ic beverages by students on the
University campus,” though soft
ening the policy to allow married
students to drink in accordance
with state law.
This decision was announced to
the students in letter from the
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler, and to student leaders in
meetings with President Wallace
Sterling in the past week.
Both President Sterling and
Dean Winbigler have declined to
explain why the Trustees chose to

reaffirm the old liquor policy, in
stead of adopting the more liberal
policy approved by the students
in the referendum held last spring
quarter.
THE DEAN said that Sterling,
who attended the Trustees’ meet
ing, probably “feared he would do
injustice to someone’s viewpoint
if he tried to summarize the Trus
tees’ reasons.” It would be futile
for himself to speculate, Winbig
ler said, as he hadn’t been at the
meeting. He did mention as pos
sible considerations the need to
stay within state law and the dif
ficulty of keeping those under 21
from drinking when those over 21
around them are drinking.
He made no comment when it
was pointed out that this last is
the condition the state law nor
mally operates in.
WINBIGLER said the referen
dum itself might be unconstitu
tional. The referendum said, “. . .
no judicial council of the Univer
sity shall punish a student . . .
where state law has not been vi
olated.” The referendum was an
amendment to the ASSU By-Laws,
which are inferior to the ASSU
Constitution. Yet, the Constitution
states, “The Judicial Council shall
have power to hear all cases in
volving violations of the discipli
nary regulations of the University
and of this Association.”
“The referendum, in curtailing
Judicial Council action, contra
dicts the constitution, which gives
the council full power to hear on
violations of University regula
tions,” he said.
When asked why the last rea
son denied graduate residences
liquor, he said that there was a
possibility that a proposal for con
trolled drinking by graduate stu
dents might be approved by the
Board of Trustees.
WINBIGLER ALSO pointed out
that Judicial Council does not
punish: it recommends punish
ment which the University usual
ly carries out.
He felt that the referendum
was unenforceable, as it said that
no action could be taken if state
law was not violated, and only
California courts could decide
whether or not the law was ac
tually violated. Thus Judicial
Council could only act after a
student has been convicted in a
state court.
ASSU PRESIDENT Armin Ro
sencranz argued, “The word ‘pre
sumed’ (before the word ‘viola
tion’) is implicit in the referen
dum, since it must have been
patently obvious to anyone that
our judicial councils, though their
interpretations are always judi
cious, have not yet arrived at the
state where the Legislature of
California has endowed them with
total judicious authority.”
In a letter to President Sterling
Armin expressed disappointment
that the Trustees had chosen to
align practice with policy, rather
than policy with practice.
LASSU will be presented its al
ternatives, it will interpret the
liquor referendum, and it will de
cide what action is to be taken at
its meeting this Thursday, Armin
said.
