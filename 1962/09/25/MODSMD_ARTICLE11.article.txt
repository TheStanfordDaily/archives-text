### 
United Press International
BUENOS AIRES (UPD—Presi
dent Jose M. Guido firmly clinched
civilian control of Argentina’s gov
ernment Monday with leaders of
all three of the armed forces
pledging full backing for his re
gime.
The president rode roughshod
over some grumbling from the
powerful navy faction by demand
ing—and getting—a retraction of
earlier fleet charges he was to
blame for last week-end’s armed
showdown between rival army
cliques.
Guido not only received and ac
cepted the resignation of Rear
Adm. Gaston Clement as navy
ecretary, a key government post,
but also won an explanation apol
ogy of last week’s charge.
NEW ORLEANS—’ The U.S. Jus
tice Department and lawyers for I
Negro James Meredith asked a
panel of eight federal judges Mon-
I day to order Meredith registered
immediately, in court, as a stu
-1 dent of the University of Missis

sippi.
As an alternative, they asked
that three university officials and
the 13 members of the state col
lege board ho held in contempt of
court until they admit Meredith.
Meanwhile, Mississippi Gov.
Ross Barnett, swore to go to jail
rather than see the school inte
grated, ordered that federal offi
cials trying to superimpose fed
eral mandates over Mississippi
laws bo arrested.
WASHINGTON—Urged on by a
declaration that this country will
fight Cuba if it must, the House
Monday voted final congressional
approval of President Kennedy’s
standby authority to call up com
bat-ready reserves.
The roll call vote was 342 to 13.
It came just after the House
shouted down three proposed
amendments.
This left the measure identical
to the one passed by the Senate,
and meant the legislation would
go directly to the President for
his signature.
