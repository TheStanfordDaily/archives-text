# Liquor Within Reason
## 
### 
The Trustees have voted to continue the ban on liquor through
out the campus proper with exceptions granted to married students
living in the Escondido and Stanford villages. The responsibility
for making liquor regulations undeniably rests with the Trustees.
Students accept the fact of the Trustees’ jurisdiction. However,
the liquor decision is, as the Trustees must have anticipated, un
palatable. It is rendered all the more unpalatable because no
rationale for the decision has been given. The only reasoning
which has been presented applies to only a segment of the ruling:
the segment that prohibits consumption of liquor by minors.
President Sterling has said in a general context that it is the re
sponsibility of a university to uphold the laws of the state, be they
wise or unwise. The implication may be that state law prohibits
minors’ consuming liquor on the campus, and therefore the Univer
sity must undertake to enforce this regulation. It is impossible to
be sure that this implication is intended. If it is intended, then a
careful examination of state law would be in order.
To our knowledge state law' does not prohibit the consumption
of liquor by minors on tbe campus of a private university. If there
is evidence to refute this interpretation, it should be brought forth.
II there is no evidence to refute this interpretation, the Univer
sity will be in the difficult position of having disregarded over
whelming student opinion, of having dictated a regulation without
being courteous enough to give the students an explanation.
Undeniably the problem of liquor and liquor regulations is a
complex one. It cannot be solved merely by citing the situation in
European communities or by analogy with regulations and prac
tice's at other universities. But neither can it be solved by silence.
There are many reasons for allowing liquor onto the campus.
Presumably, the dangers of drunk driving on the way home from
off-campus parties would be diminished by allowing for liquor
during campus social occasions. And the liquor prohibition does
anything but encourage students to learn how to handle liquor
and use it in moderation. It does encourage students to go on a
binge when they get the chance. As has been pointed out, any
liquor prohibition serves to make a status symbol of liquor. The
University’s policy in this respect supplements state* law.
Granted, the decision has been made, and the chances of a
change in the near future are now very dim. Nevertheless, the
problem of liquor remains with ns. Unless further discussion take's
place, the problem w ill never be* alleviated e>r resolved. This dis
enssion, in turn, w ill not materialize without the* encouragement of
the University.
If the University considers the problem solved, then it is merely
lack of courtesy not to give students an explanation for the policy.
If the University realizes that the problem has not been alleviated,
much less resolved, then it is dangerous for the University to with
hold an explanation and thereby effectively stifle discussion.
Presumably, a university is the one institution within society
where discussion thrives and where reason is more respected than
authority.
