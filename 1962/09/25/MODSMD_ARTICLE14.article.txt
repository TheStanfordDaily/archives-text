# HELSINKI: A SECOND VIEW
## Communists Dole Propaganda In Anti-American Environment 
### JERRY BERG 
Prior to the Festival its organiz
ers attempted to hide the political
nature of the event behind a fa
cade of announced cultural and
athletic events. But once under
way, Communist delegates kept
busy in between the concerts and
athletic contests spreading propa
ganda among neutral groups. It
was estimated that approximately
3,000 youth leaders from uncom
mitted nations in Asia, Africa,
and South America were present.
Thus the 33 of us from Stan
ford found ourselves in Helsinki
in a hostile environment with,
from any Westerner’s viewpoint,
an important job to perform. For
tunately, as a group we had an

ticipated many of the problems
which were to arise; we had dealt
with them in our briefing ses
sions.

EVIDENTLY there is no uni
versal concept of youth, for the
ages of Festival delegates varied
from 16 to 60. The Russians and
Poles appeared to be among the
most elderly. At the Polish press
conference a U.S. reporter asked
the average age of the Polish dele
gates and got only a curt “No
Comment” in reply.
Sever al of the delegations from
Eastern countries arrived aboard
ships which docked in the various
harbors around Helsinki. The
delegates lived and took their
meals aboard these ships, enabl
ing their leaders to exercise great
er control over their movements.
After the reported defection of 14
members of the East German
delegation to Stockholm (where
the nearest West German em
bassy was located! it was virtu
ally impossible to board or even
linger near the East German ship.
The Red Chinese, like the East
Ger mans, were carefully guarded.
Their delegation was relatively
small—a reported 137 including
interpreters. Two cooks were
brought along so that the dele
gates wouldn’t have to eat in res
taurants, thus avoiding all un
necessary exposure to anyone hut
other Chinese. It was practically
impossible to speak with them.
The school in which they were
lodged was attentively watched.
Whenever they attended a Festi
val event they wore taken in
busses and immediately returned
to their quarters upon the event’s
completion. At most of the semi
nars a Chinese political export
would show up to give a short
party line speech and immediately
depart upon its completion.
THE FINNS were surprisingly
well organized in expressing dis
pleasure at being forced to host a
thinly disguised Communist
gathering. Inside the country the
Festival was backed only by Fin
nish Communists and their youth
organizations; all other Finnish
youth groups refused to partici
pate.
On several evenings during the
Festival thousands of Finnish
youths, some obviously drunk,
gathered along Mannerheim
Street in downtown Helsinki to
shout “Viva Finland,” “Down
with the Festival,” and “Down
with Communism.” These appar
ently spontaneous demonstrations
usually began when groups of
delegates wearing Festival pins
walked through the congested
downtown area. Delegates were
mobbed on several occasions, but
never hurt.
But there was violence too. On
one occasion several windows of
a Russian bus full of North Ko
rean delegates were shattered.
There were fights between Fin
nish Communists and Finnish
anti-Communists. On each succes
sive evening the Finnish police
became more adept at handling
these riots, which were out of
character with the customary
quiet of Helsinki life. They be
came quite successful at control
ling the crowds through use of
mounted policemen and the ju
dicial administration of tear gas.
MOST Festival delegates were
understandably nervous and ap
prehensive about the negative re
sponse their presence evoked
Some refused to go anywhere
alone at night ,or even in small
groups.
Many rumors circulated among
delegates as to the reason for this
Finnish antagonism. Some said
the riots were sparked by a Nazi
uprising staged by West German
delegates. But the most common
story was that the U.S. had sent
agents to instigate the riots in or

der to detract from the Festival
goals of “Peace and Friendship.”
Apart from the riots and dem
onstrations, local Finnish groups
employed more subtle means of
undermining Communist effec
tiveness. All of the Finnish char
ter busses were rented and taken
out of the city, so the Russians
had to bring in a fleet of busses
from Leningrad to provide the
various delegations with trans
portation inside Helsinki. All
available billboards were rented,
so consequently no Festival adver
tisements were in evidence. Of
course there were no street ban
ners or welcoming pennants.
In addition, the Finns were ex
tremely reluctant to provide meet
ing halls and housing facilities.
As a result some of the delegates
were housed in schools located as
far as 30 kilometers outside Hel
sinki. With the single exception
of the Communist newspaper, the
Festival was not mentioned once
in any of the Helsinki papers.
