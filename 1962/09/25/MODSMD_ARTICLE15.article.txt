## Airlines Trouble Plagues Delegation 
### RON BASS Contributing Editor 
Before mapping the odyssey of
the trip itself, it must be made
clear that my observations are not
the expression of a group con
sensus. Although I have tried to
draw on general group feeling as
much as possible, the Festival is
just too subjective a concept to
avoid a wide variance of individu
al impressions.
In the first place, we had air
lines trouble. Fred Nelson, our
long-suffering business manager,
discovered that our original choice
had a peachy record of carting
folks across the ocean but were
less consistent in bringing them
back.
WE FINALLY settled on Pov
erty Airways, although their
name changed constantly during
the flight as we passed over states
which had banned them under dif
ferent aliases. The check-in man
(who suspiciously resembled the
baggage porter, the pilot, and the
more attractive stewardess) actu
ally asked for our body weight. I
am not certain how they managed
to keep the cabin temperature at
a constant 96 degrees throughout
the night, but we were all pretty
grateful as the oppressive heat
nearly made us forget how little
air there was to breathe.
Our stopover in Burbank took
an hour longer than scheduled,
thereby setting us up for the Old

Chicago Trick. Thus, having as
sured us of the plane’s tardiness,
the pilot pulled out of Chicago
fifteen minutes ahead of sched
ule .stranding four of our group
who were forced to grab a costly
jet to New York. At Idlewild we
stepped into a mammoth Pan Am
jet and licked our wounds all the
way to Oslo, Stockholm and Hel
sinki.
Upon arrival the delegate half
of our group was hustled off to
the official accommodations pre
pared for the American delegation
by the Festival’s International
Preparatory Committee. This
turned out to be a converted
school, miles from town, making
the Americans and the Festival
nearly inaccessible to each other.
THE OBSERVER half of out
group found its way to the IRS
headquarters. We marched into a
tall gray apartment house on Cas
treninkatu, filed up six flights of
stairs and knocked on an unmark
ed door. The sentry, however, was
unarmed. The main reason for the
cloak and dagger precautions was
that the Communists considered
IRS a pack of war mongering pro
fessional fascist provocateurs.
Not the most popular organiza
tion in town. We were instructed
to avoid excessive reference to
IRS. calling it “The Firm” instead.
Walter Mitty would have gone
wild in that, apartment. It was
packed with smoke and people
whispering with controlled eager
ness and circled maps being jab

bod with colored pins and miineo
ed sheets of statistics being sorted
and stacked and corrected and
everyone trying to memorize
everyone else’s face. Hot damn.
Enter Dennis Shaul. He always
looks tired. It’s quite an asset.
He looks as though he has just
stepped off a plane from Djakar
ta and has given up two nights’
sleep to be here. He told us that
our living quarters would be at 29
Boulevardi, and we filed back
downstairs.
THERE followed a memorable
scene in which a dozen Americans
(us), complete with tab collars
and Pan Am bags, loitered con
spicuously for thirty minutes in
front of the Firm’s hideaway, try*
ing to catch a cab. Truly an inept
display.
Luckily, our converted school
was right in the heart of town. In
fact, it was so convenient that
most of our Stanford delegates
decided to forego their more luxu
rious lodgings (one shower to our
none) and moved in with us.

Although the Festival was still
three days away, difficulties were
already taking shape. Pre-Festival
tours had been offet-ed to most of
the neutral delegations. The South
American delegates had reported
ly arrived fresh from a week’s
stay in Cuba, followed by selective
tours of Eastern Europe and the"
Soviet Union. The Cubans arrived
in busloads from Leningrad. Afri
cans had taken similar tours and
were impressed by the warm re
ception given them by the Rus
sian people.
SOVIETS, East Germans and
Poles were to live aboard ship in
the harbor, thereby remaining vir
tually inaccessible. The Chinese,
Viet-Namese and North Koreans
kept their delegations under close
watch, and contact with Anglo-
Saxons was minimal or less. Fes
tival guards had been given strict
orders concerning the admittance
of outsiders into the quarters of
Festival delegations. Prospects
for lengthy discussions with dele
gates were hardly encouraging.
Opportunities for personal con
tact could still be found. Alex
Garvin’s Young America Presents
organization, in addition to their
display of modern American art,
in the Atheneum, had set up two
coffee houses for the display of
American jazz. A preliminary
problem arose in that both the
Progressive (Jimmy Giuffre) and
Dixie (Queen City Band) houses
were filled with young Finns who
wanted to meet Americans. Gar
vin’s group quickly made tickets
mandatory, and the jazz houses
became very handy spots at
which to entertain the people we
had met during the day.

back.
WE FINALLY settled on Pov
erty Airways, although their
name changed constantly during
the flight as we passed over states
which had banned them under dif
ferent aliases. The check-in man
(who suspiciously resembled the
baggage porter, the pilot, and the
more attractive stewardess) actu
ally asked for our body weight. I
am not certain how they managed
to keep the cabin temperature at
a constant 96 degrees throughout
the night, but we were all pretty
grateful as the oppressive heat
nearly made us forget how little
air there was to breathe.
Our stopover in Burbank took
an hour longer than scheduled,
thereby setting us up for the Old

Chicago Trick. Thus, having as
sured us of the plane’s tardiness,
the pilot pulled out of Chicago
fifteen minutes ahead of sched
ule .stranding four of our group
who were forced to grab a costly
jet to New York. At Idlewild we
stepped into a mammoth Pan Am
jet and licked our wounds all the
way to Oslo, Stockholm and Hel
sinki.
Upon arrival the delegate half
of our group was hustled off to
the official accommodations pre
pared for the American delegation
by the Festival’s International
Preparatory Committee. This
turned out to be a converted
school, miles from town, making
the Americans and the Festival
nearly inaccessible to each other.
THE OBSERVER half of out
group found its way to the IRS
headquarters. We marched into a
tall gray apartment house on Cas
treninkatu, filed up six flights of
stairs and knocked on an unmark
ed door. The sentry, however, was
unarmed. The main reason for the
cloak and dagger precautions was
that the Communists considered
IRS a pack of war mongering pro
fessional fascist provocateurs.
Not the most popular organiza
tion in town. We were instructed
to avoid excessive reference to
IRS. calling it “The Firm” instead.
Walter Mitty would have gone
wild in that, apartment. It was
packed with smoke and people
whispering with controlled eager
ness and circled maps being jab

bod with colored pins and miineo
ed sheets of statistics being sorted
and stacked and corrected and
everyone trying to memorize
everyone else’s face. Hot damn.
Enter Dennis Shaul. He always
looks tired. It’s quite an asset.
He looks as though he has just
stepped off a plane from Djakar
ta and has given up two nights’
sleep to be here. He told us that
our living quarters would be at 29
Boulevardi, and we filed back
downstairs.
THERE followed a memorable
scene in which a dozen Americans
(us), complete with tab collars
and Pan Am bags, loitered con
spicuously for thirty minutes in
front of the Firm’s hideaway, try*
ing to catch a cab. Truly an inept
display.
Luckily, our converted school
was right in the heart of town. In
fact, it was so convenient that
most of our Stanford delegates
decided to forego their more luxu
rious lodgings (one shower to our
none) and moved in with us.

Although the Festival was still
three days away, difficulties were
already taking shape. Pre-Festival
tours had been offet-ed to most of
the neutral delegations. The South
American delegates had reported
ly arrived fresh from a week’s
stay in Cuba, followed by selective
tours of Eastern Europe and the"
Soviet Union. The Cubans arrived
in busloads from Leningrad. Afri
cans had taken similar tours and
were impressed by the warm re
ception given them by the Rus
sian people.
SOVIETS, East Germans and
Poles were to live aboard ship in
the harbor, thereby remaining vir
tually inaccessible. The Chinese,
Viet-Namese and North Koreans
kept their delegations under close
watch, and contact with Anglo-
Saxons was minimal or less. Fes
tival guards had been given strict
orders concerning the admittance
of outsiders into the quarters of
Festival delegations. Prospects
for lengthy discussions with dele
gates were hardly encouraging.
Opportunities for personal con
tact could still be found. Alex
Garvin’s Young America Presents
organization, in addition to their
display of modern American art,
in the Atheneum, had set up two
coffee houses for the display of
American jazz. A preliminary
problem arose in that both the
Progressive (Jimmy Giuffre) and
Dixie (Queen City Band) houses
were filled with young Finns who
wanted to meet Americans. Gar
vin’s group quickly made tickets
mandatory, and the jazz houses
became very handy spots at
which to entertain the people we
had met during the day.

series on tin* Helsinki World
Youth Festival.)
Before mapping the odyssey of
the trip itself, it must be made
clear that my observations are not
the expression of a group con
sensus. Although I have tried to
draw on general group feeling as
much as possible, the Festival is
just too subjective a concept to
avoid a wide variance of individu
al impressions.
In the first place, we had air
lines trouble. Fred Nelson, our
long-suffering business manager,
discovered that our original choice
had a peachy record of carting
folks across the ocean but were
less consistent in bringing them
back.

Our stopover in Burbank took
an hour longer than scheduled,
thereby setting us up for the Old

Chicago Trick. Thus, having as
sured us of the plane’s tardiness,
the pilot pulled out of Chicago
fifteen minutes ahead of sched
ule .stranding four of our group
who were forced to grab a costly
jet to New York. At Idlewild we
stepped into a mammoth Pan Am
jet and licked our wounds all the
way to Oslo, Stockholm and Hel
sinki.
Upon arrival the delegate half
of our group was hustled off to
the official accommodations pre
pared for the American delegation
by the Festival’s International
Preparatory Committee. This
turned out to be a converted
school, miles from town, making
the Americans and the Festival
nearly inaccessible to each other.
THE OBSERVER half of out
group found its way to the IRS
headquarters. We marched into a
tall gray apartment house on Cas
treninkatu, filed up six flights of
stairs and knocked on an unmark
ed door. The sentry, however, was
unarmed. The main reason for the
cloak and dagger precautions was
that the Communists considered
IRS a pack of war mongering pro
fessional fascist provocateurs.
Not the most popular organiza
tion in town. We were instructed
to avoid excessive reference to
IRS. calling it “The Firm” instead.
Walter Mitty would have gone
wild in that, apartment. It was
packed with smoke and people
whispering with controlled eager
ness and circled maps being jab

bod with colored pins and miineo
ed sheets of statistics being sorted
and stacked and corrected and
everyone trying to memorize
everyone else’s face. Hot damn.
Enter Dennis Shaul. He always
looks tired. It’s quite an asset.
He looks as though he has just
stepped off a plane from Djakar
ta and has given up two nights’
sleep to be here. He told us that
our living quarters would be at 29
Boulevardi, and we filed back
downstairs.
THERE followed a memorable
scene in which a dozen Americans
(us), complete with tab collars
and Pan Am bags, loitered con
spicuously for thirty minutes in
front of the Firm’s hideaway, try*
ing to catch a cab. Truly an inept
display.
Luckily, our converted school
was right in the heart of town. In
fact, it was so convenient that
most of our Stanford delegates
decided to forego their more luxu
rious lodgings (one shower to our
none) and moved in with us.

Although the Festival was still
three days away, difficulties were
already taking shape. Pre-Festival
tours had been offet-ed to most of
the neutral delegations. The South
American delegates had reported
ly arrived fresh from a week’s
stay in Cuba, followed by selective
tours of Eastern Europe and the"
Soviet Union. The Cubans arrived
in busloads from Leningrad. Afri
cans had taken similar tours and
were impressed by the warm re
ception given them by the Rus
sian people.
SOVIETS, East Germans and
Poles were to live aboard ship in
the harbor, thereby remaining vir
tually inaccessible. The Chinese,
Viet-Namese and North Koreans
kept their delegations under close
watch, and contact with Anglo-
Saxons was minimal or less. Fes
tival guards had been given strict
orders concerning the admittance
of outsiders into the quarters of
Festival delegations. Prospects
for lengthy discussions with dele
gates were hardly encouraging.
Opportunities for personal con
tact could still be found. Alex
Garvin’s Young America Presents
organization, in addition to their
display of modern American art,
in the Atheneum, had set up two
coffee houses for the display of
American jazz. A preliminary
problem arose in that both the
Progressive (Jimmy Giuffre) and
Dixie (Queen City Band) houses
were filled with young Finns who
wanted to meet Americans. Gar
vin’s group quickly made tickets
mandatory, and the jazz houses
became very handy spots at
which to entertain the people we
had met during the day.

(This is (lie second article in a
series on tin* Helsinki World
Youth Festival.)
Before mapping the odyssey of
the trip itself, it must be made
clear that my observations are not
the expression of a group con
sensus. Although I have tried to
draw on general group feeling as
much as possible, the Festival is
just too subjective a concept to
avoid a wide variance of individu
al impressions.
In the first place, we had air
lines trouble. Fred Nelson, our
long-suffering business manager,
discovered that our original choice
had a peachy record of carting
folks across the ocean but were
less consistent in bringing them
back.
WE FINALLY settled on Pov
erty Airways, although their
name changed constantly during
the flight as we passed over states
which had banned them under dif
ferent aliases. The check-in man
(who suspiciously resembled the
baggage porter, the pilot, and the
more attractive stewardess) actu
ally asked for our body weight. I
am not certain how they managed
to keep the cabin temperature at
a constant 96 degrees throughout
the night, but we were all pretty
grateful as the oppressive heat
nearly made us forget how little
air there was to breathe.
