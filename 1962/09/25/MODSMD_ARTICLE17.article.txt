# IIR SPEAKER
## Birrenbach: Multinational Representative 
### THOMAS GREY UK Political Analyst 
The fall quarter program of the
Institute of International Rela
tions, “The Atlantic Community,”
opens tomorrow night with a
speech by Dr. Kurt Birrenbach,
Chairman of the Board of the
Thyssen Corporation of Diissel
dorf on “Germany and the Com
mon Market.”
This is only the first of a series
of HR speakers, conferences, and
discussions on such related topics
as the Common Market, NATO,
political integration in Europe,
economic cooperation between the
Six and North America, and the
other problems and challenges
which face the loose aggregation
of nations which we call the At
lantic Community.
SUCH a community is today
mostly a hope and a promise—a
hope that nations with a common
cultural heritage, with certain
common economic and political
principles and purposes, can
break down the barriers between
them and work in closer coopera
tion and harmony; and a promise
that if they do, the western civili
zation of which they are the repre
sentatives, may greatly benefit.
Dr. Birrenbach represents the
group which is having the great
est influence at the moment in
making the Atlantic Community
a reality. He is a most important
citizen, a member of the German
Federal Parliament, and Chair
man of one of the greatest Ger
man industrial empires.
But at the same time ho is one
of a new breed —the citizens of
Europe. He is a vice-president of
the Atlantic Institute of Paris, and
also of the European Union. More
important, he is in the parlia
ments of both the Coal and Steel
Community and the Common
Market itself.
HE COMES to us at a crucial
time. The Common Market is fac
ing a crisis over the admission of
Great Britain. At the same time, it
is afflicted by a slump in the all
important economic expansion of
West Germany, and by worry
over its most influential currency,
the Deutschemark.
But at the same time as certain
difficulties face the heretofore
uniformly successful Common
Market, on the other side of the
ocean a recent development has
provided an impetus to unrestrict
ed trade between the United
Stales and Europe, and may prove
vastly significant to the future de
velopment of the Atlantic Com
munity. That is the trade bill
which passed the Senate last
week.
The bill gives the President
broad powers to cut tariffs by
Executive decree. He may cut
duties on most commodities up to
50 per cent in return for similar
concessions by other countries
producing them.
FURTHER, and this is of par
ticular interest, he may remove
all tariffs on products of which 80
per cent or more are supplied by
the United States and the coun
tries of the Common Market. For
the purposes of the bill, Britain is
defined as a Common Market
member whether or not she joins.
The fact that special provision
is made for the Market means
that the Senators and Congress
men who passed the hill envision
a particularly strong likelihood
that this country might be head
ing in the direction of a tariff
free area, a real customs union,
with Western Europe.
History has shown that the
most effective way of developing
real community between separate
political units, is through the
breaking down of trade barriers,
leading to closer economic ties.
This is a real step in that direc
tion.
