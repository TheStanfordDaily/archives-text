# Frosh English, Civ Revamped
## 
### 
English 1, 2, and 3, “Freshman
English” and History 1, 2, and 3,
“History of Western Civilization,”
or “Civ,” the mainstays of the
freshman curriculum, have been
changed from last year.
This year the English Depart
ment decided to drop the “bone
head” English courses and the
English placement tests. The first
is a tribute to the rise in quality
of incoming students, the second
is due to new methods.
Placement in English classes,
either regular or special is now
determined by scores on the Verb
al Aptitude section of the College
Boards. Some of the students who
scored below the cut-off mark on
the test were placed in special
classes due to high scores on the
advanced placement tests.
THERE WILL be 12 special
English classes, up from six last
year, with about 300 students.
The freshman English classes
use a variety of anthologies, Dr.
Stone, director of the program,
said. He advised students to delay
purchase of English texts until
their classes meet.
Prof. Guerard will have a spe
cial seminar for students who
placed out of at least six units of
freshman English. Six or seven
students will be selected from
scores on Verbal Aptitude and
Advanced Placement tests.
From there the project will
pretty much direct itself, Prof.
Guerard said. The group will “do
advanced work in writing and
literary criticism,” he said, “with
perhaps a project if the group is
so inclined.”
THOSE considered for the sem
inar but not accepted will be al
lowed to take Prof. Guerard’s
English 172, “Forms of the Mod
ern Novel” to satisfy their Eng
lish requirement.
“The History of Western Civil
ization” has been renumbered
from History 10, 11 and 12 to
History 1, 2 and 3; the syllabus
has been revised even more dras
ticly than usual, according to Di
rector Roszak, making the vari
ous Civ outlines even less good
than before; and the books have
been changed.
Edward Burns’ “Western Civil
izations,” the text long used, has
been replaced by Easton’s “The
Western Heritage” and Crane
Brinton’s “Ideas and Mon.”

been changed.
Edward Burns’ “Western Civil
izations,” the text long used, has
been replaced by Easton’s “The
Western Heritage” and Crane
Brinton’s “Ideas and Mon.”
English 1, 2, and 3, “Freshman
English” and History 1, 2, and 3,
“History of Western Civilization,”
or “Civ,” the mainstays of the
freshman curriculum, have been
changed from last year.
This year the English Depart
ment decided to drop the “bone
head” English courses and the
English placement tests. The first
is a tribute to the rise in quality
of incoming students, the second
is due to new methods.
Placement in English classes,
either regular or special is now
determined by scores on the Verb
al Aptitude section of the College
Boards. Some of the students who
scored below the cut-off mark on
the test were placed in special
classes due to high scores on the
advanced placement tests.
THERE WILL be 12 special
English classes, up from six last
year, with about 300 students.
The freshman English classes
use a variety of anthologies, Dr.
Stone, director of the program,
said. He advised students to delay
purchase of English texts until
their classes meet.
Prof. Guerard will have a spe
cial seminar for students who
placed out of at least six units of
freshman English. Six or seven
students will be selected from
scores on Verbal Aptitude and
Advanced Placement tests.
From there the project will
pretty much direct itself, Prof.
Guerard said. The group will “do
advanced work in writing and
literary criticism,” he said, “with
perhaps a project if the group is
so inclined.”
THOSE considered for the sem
inar but not accepted will be al
lowed to take Prof. Guerard’s
English 172, “Forms of the Mod
ern Novel” to satisfy their Eng
lish requirement.
“The History of Western Civil
ization” has been renumbered
from History 10, 11 and 12 to
History 1, 2 and 3; the syllabus
has been revised even more dras
ticly than usual, according to Di
rector Roszak, making the vari
ous Civ outlines even less good
than before; and the books have
been changed.
