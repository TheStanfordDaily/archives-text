# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## 
### Glenn Alford 
The Stanford athletic star is at its brightest in several years,
with the Cards having excellent chances to cop championships in
three of the four major team sports, and having an outside shot at
the fourth.
STANFORD CAN' WIN the football, basketball and track crown',
and might lake the baseball title.
On the gridiron, Stanford will pose a threat to any of its ten
opponents, and this includes powerful Michigan State. The Indians’

strong points one of the strong
est lines in the country, three
good quarterbacks and a group
of bruising power runners—
rightly give Coach Jack Curtice
high hope for a title. The only in
gredients lacking are offensive
speed and an experienced center.
Coach Jack Curtice experiment
ed with rugged tackle C. B. Si
mons at center and linebacker in
the Alumni football game and the
latter showed his inexperience
but this may be the solution to
that problem. There seems to he
no speed merchant in sight to
solve the lack of speed.
STANFORD will have to grind
out its rushing yardage the hard
way, interspersed with the Cur
tice trademark, tricky short
passes. The trio of Clark Weaver,
Dick Ragsdale and Steve Thurlow
will do the throwing.

Stingy Stanford Defense
The Stanford defense may tie one of the stingiest in the West,
with experience showing everywhere. This is true especially in the
backfield, which boasts Jim Shroyer, Gary Sargent, Tim Hansel, Gary
Craig, ami newcomers up from the frosh team of last year such as
Morrison Warren.
Stanford may not do much scoring, but the defense should hold
the opposition within such limits that the Indians will win seven of
ten games.
USC and Washington will stage a three-way battle with Stanford
for championship honors in the Big Six. USC has a classy backfield
featuring Pete Beathard, Ben Wilson and Willie Brown, and a top
flight end in Hal Bedsole, but are hurting for a line.
Washington has everything ... but a quarterback. All-Coast
halfback Charlie Mitchell and interior lineman Ray Mansfield bul
wark a rugged ball club.
Cal will be tough also, if their fine 1961 frosh club can give them
a line and backfield. They have three fine quarterbacks in Larry
Balliett, Randy Gold and Craig Morton, but that may be all.
UCLA retains only one starter from last year’s Rose Bowl outfit,
wingback Kermit Alexander. The Bruins are shifty from the single
wing formation to the “T” and have problems.
STANFORD HAS STRENGTH aplenty on the basketball court.
Coach Howie Dallmar has junior center Tom Dose, guards Dar
rell Sutherland and twins Don and Doug Clemetson, and forward
Hollis Moore returning from last year’s team that won 20 of 26 games.
Basketball Problems
The big problem for the Indians will be to find another starting
forward to go with Moore, and dig up some help for Dose at center.
Sophs Bob Garner, Jack Gilbert and Frank Olrich, and center
Bob Sommers are the forward possibilities, with sophs Craig Cordes
and John Murray figuring to help out Dose.
Uf'EA ONCE AGAIN will be the big Stanford stumbling block,
with massive center Fred Slaughter, guard Walt Hazzard, and all
purpose sophomore Gail Goodrich touted as stars.
Rene Herrerias’ Cal Bears will regain some of the prestige lost
last year, led by 6-10 center Camden Wall, soph forward Harry Hen
derson, and guards Dick Smith and Denny Lewis.
USC and Washington will be hin ting. The Trojans lost everyone
and Washington retains only 6-3 forward Ed Corell.
STANFORD COULD CAPTURE the AAWU title in track also,
with Dave Weill, best college discus thrower in the land ,back to try
for the 200’ mark; distance runner Harry McCalla, who has run a
4:06.7 mile and a sub-nine minute two mile; and Ken Emanuels, an
outstanding competitor in the 440, back to push Stanford to the top
of the heap.
Up from the Frosh team are sprinter Larry Questad. distance
runners Weyn Kirkland, Paul Schlicke and Harlan Andrews, shot
putters Jack Chappie and Jock McLoughlin and hurdler Phil Arnaudo.
Not the least part of Stanford’s track strength is Coach Payton
Jordan, who rejected an offer to coach USC, in order that he might
stay on the Farm and further develop (he dynasty he is building.
Other trackmen of note are shot-putter Steve Arch, hurdler, hop
step-jumper Steve Cortright, sprinter Phil Lamoreaux, distance run
ners Robin Ruble and Bill Pratt, broad jumpers Dan Moore and Larry
Chukwudebe. and high jumpers John Haynie and Clay Raaka.
The Big Five is balanced in track, hut perennial champ USC will
be favored to repeat. Cal, if its outstanding frosh track team can
help it, will give the leaders a tussle.

COACH JACK CURTICE
High hopes
The Stanford athletic star is at its brightest in several years,
with the Cards having excellent chances to cop championships in
three of the four major team sports, and having an outside shot at
the fourth.
STANFORD CAN' WIN the football, basketball and track crown',
and might lake the baseball title.
On the gridiron, Stanford will pose a threat to any of its ten
opponents, and this includes powerful Michigan State. The Indians’

strong points one of the strong
est lines in the country, three
good quarterbacks and a group
of bruising power runners—
rightly give Coach Jack Curtice
high hope for a title. The only in
gredients lacking are offensive
speed and an experienced center.
Coach Jack Curtice experiment
ed with rugged tackle C. B. Si
mons at center and linebacker in
the Alumni football game and the
latter showed his inexperience
but this may be the solution to
that problem. There seems to he
no speed merchant in sight to
solve the lack of speed.
STANFORD will have to grind
out its rushing yardage the hard
way, interspersed with the Cur
tice trademark, tricky short
passes. The trio of Clark Weaver,
Dick Ragsdale and Steve Thurlow
will do the throwing.

Stingy Stanford Defense
The Stanford defense may tie one of the stingiest in the West,
with experience showing everywhere. This is true especially in the
backfield, which boasts Jim Shroyer, Gary Sargent, Tim Hansel, Gary
Craig, ami newcomers up from the frosh team of last year such as
Morrison Warren.
Stanford may not do much scoring, but the defense should hold
the opposition within such limits that the Indians will win seven of
ten games.
USC and Washington will stage a three-way battle with Stanford
for championship honors in the Big Six. USC has a classy backfield
featuring Pete Beathard, Ben Wilson and Willie Brown, and a top
flight end in Hal Bedsole, but are hurting for a line.
Washington has everything ... but a quarterback. All-Coast
halfback Charlie Mitchell and interior lineman Ray Mansfield bul
wark a rugged ball club.
Cal will be tough also, if their fine 1961 frosh club can give them
a line and backfield. They have three fine quarterbacks in Larry
Balliett, Randy Gold and Craig Morton, but that may be all.
UCLA retains only one starter from last year’s Rose Bowl outfit,
wingback Kermit Alexander. The Bruins are shifty from the single
wing formation to the “T” and have problems.
STANFORD HAS STRENGTH aplenty on the basketball court.
Coach Howie Dallmar has junior center Tom Dose, guards Dar
rell Sutherland and twins Don and Doug Clemetson, and forward
Hollis Moore returning from last year’s team that won 20 of 26 games.
Basketball Problems
The big problem for the Indians will be to find another starting
forward to go with Moore, and dig up some help for Dose at center.
Sophs Bob Garner, Jack Gilbert and Frank Olrich, and center
Bob Sommers are the forward possibilities, with sophs Craig Cordes
and John Murray figuring to help out Dose.
Uf'EA ONCE AGAIN will be the big Stanford stumbling block,
with massive center Fred Slaughter, guard Walt Hazzard, and all
purpose sophomore Gail Goodrich touted as stars.
Rene Herrerias’ Cal Bears will regain some of the prestige lost
last year, led by 6-10 center Camden Wall, soph forward Harry Hen
derson, and guards Dick Smith and Denny Lewis.
USC and Washington will be hin ting. The Trojans lost everyone
and Washington retains only 6-3 forward Ed Corell.
STANFORD COULD CAPTURE the AAWU title in track also,
with Dave Weill, best college discus thrower in the land ,back to try
for the 200’ mark; distance runner Harry McCalla, who has run a
4:06.7 mile and a sub-nine minute two mile; and Ken Emanuels, an
outstanding competitor in the 440, back to push Stanford to the top
of the heap.

and John Murray figuring to help out Dose.
Uf'EA ONCE AGAIN will be the big Stanford stumbling block,
with massive center Fred Slaughter, guard Walt Hazzard, and all
purpose sophomore Gail Goodrich touted as stars.
Rene Herrerias’ Cal Bears will regain some of the prestige lost
last year, led by 6-10 center Camden Wall, soph forward Harry Hen
derson, and guards Dick Smith and Denny Lewis.
USC and Washington will be hin ting. The Trojans lost everyone
and Washington retains only 6-3 forward Ed Corell.
STANFORD COULD CAPTURE the AAWU title in track also,
with Dave Weill, best college discus thrower in the land ,back to try
for the 200’ mark; distance runner Harry McCalla, who has run a
4:06.7 mile and a sub-nine minute two mile; and Ken Emanuels, an
outstanding competitor in the 440, back to push Stanford to the top
of the heap.
Up from the Frosh team are sprinter Larry Questad. distance
runners Weyn Kirkland, Paul Schlicke and Harlan Andrews, shot
putters Jack Chappie and Jock McLoughlin and hurdler Phil Arnaudo.
Not the least part of Stanford’s track strength is Coach Payton
Jordan, who rejected an offer to coach USC, in order that he might
stay on the Farm and further develop (he dynasty he is building.
Other trackmen of note are shot-putter Steve Arch, hurdler, hop
step-jumper Steve Cortright, sprinter Phil Lamoreaux, distance run
ners Robin Ruble and Bill Pratt, broad jumpers Dan Moore and Larry
Chukwudebe. and high jumpers John Haynie and Clay Raaka.
The Big Five is balanced in track, hut perennial champ USC will
be favored to repeat. Cal, if its outstanding frosh track team can
help it, will give the leaders a tussle.


COACH JACK CURTICE
High hopes
The Stanford athletic star is at its brightest in several years,
with the Cards having excellent chances to cop championships in
three of the four major team sports, and having an outside shot at
the fourth.
STANFORD CAN' WIN the football, basketball and track crown',
and might lake the baseball title.
On the gridiron, Stanford will pose a threat to any of its ten
opponents, and this includes powerful Michigan State. The Indians’

strong points one of the strong
est lines in the country, three
good quarterbacks and a group
of bruising power runners—
rightly give Coach Jack Curtice
high hope for a title. The only in
gredients lacking are offensive
speed and an experienced center.
Coach Jack Curtice experiment
ed with rugged tackle C. B. Si
mons at center and linebacker in
the Alumni football game and the
latter showed his inexperience
but this may be the solution to
that problem. There seems to he
no speed merchant in sight to
solve the lack of speed.
STANFORD will have to grind
out its rushing yardage the hard
way, interspersed with the Cur
tice trademark, tricky short
passes. The trio of Clark Weaver,
Dick Ragsdale and Steve Thurlow
will do the throwing.

Stingy Stanford Defense
The Stanford defense may tie one of the stingiest in the West,
with experience showing everywhere. This is true especially in the
backfield, which boasts Jim Shroyer, Gary Sargent, Tim Hansel, Gary
Craig, ami newcomers up from the frosh team of last year such as
Morrison Warren.
Stanford may not do much scoring, but the defense should hold
the opposition within such limits that the Indians will win seven of
ten games.
USC and Washington will stage a three-way battle with Stanford
for championship honors in the Big Six. USC has a classy backfield
featuring Pete Beathard, Ben Wilson and Willie Brown, and a top
flight end in Hal Bedsole, but are hurting for a line.
Washington has everything ... but a quarterback. All-Coast
halfback Charlie Mitchell and interior lineman Ray Mansfield bul
wark a rugged ball club.
Cal will be tough also, if their fine 1961 frosh club can give them
a line and backfield. They have three fine quarterbacks in Larry
Balliett, Randy Gold and Craig Morton, but that may be all.
UCLA retains only one starter from last year’s Rose Bowl outfit,
wingback Kermit Alexander. The Bruins are shifty from the single
wing formation to the “T” and have problems.
STANFORD HAS STRENGTH aplenty on the basketball court.
Coach Howie Dallmar has junior center Tom Dose, guards Dar
rell Sutherland and twins Don and Doug Clemetson, and forward
Hollis Moore returning from last year’s team that won 20 of 26 games.
Basketball Problems
The big problem for the Indians will be to find another starting
forward to go with Moore, and dig up some help for Dose at center.
Sophs Bob Garner, Jack Gilbert and Frank Olrich, and center
Bob Sommers are the forward possibilities, with sophs Craig Cordes
and John Murray figuring to help out Dose.
