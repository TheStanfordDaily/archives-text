| and speed once more today in
| what is expected to be the last
race of the 1962 America’s Cup
I series.
The course for the fifth race

jto Bus Mosbacher’s American
beauty.
THE SERIES NOW stands:
| United States 3, Australia 1.
One more Weatherly victory)
and it will be over. Aussie Jock!
Sturrock, in last Saturday’s great |
encounter, came over the finish i
line only 26 seconds behind Mos-1
bacher in the fastest America’s)
Cup race ever sailed in its 111 )
year history.
That was over a triangular, 24- j
mile course. It was on the same |
course, in the second race, that !
Gretel got her only victory so far
in this million dollar gamble on
taking the trophy of international
j yachting supremacy,
i Tuesday’s run into the wind)
) during half of the race is the
kind of going in which Weatherly
leaves Gretel behind.
ON THE TWO windward legs of
race No. 1, Weatherly gained two!
: minutes, 41 seconds on the Aus
) traillait boat. It was that way
' from then on. Mosbacher can
point the blue-hulled Weatherly
better into the breeze.
