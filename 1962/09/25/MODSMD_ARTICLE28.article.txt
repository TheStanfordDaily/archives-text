After one game Stanford’s football outlook has changed very
little. It is neither brighter nor dimmer; but it is still very uncertain
as coach Jack Curtice brings his offense toward maturity. A few
questions have been partially settled. Sophomore J. D. Lodato’s
running ability was quite impressive in his first varsity performance:
he made 37 yards in nine carries Including a 30-yard touchdown run
around end,
Curtice also successfully carried out a private experiment by
using Alan Cun', an unpublici/ed sophomore halfback. Curr respond
ed well, gaining 64 yards, the highest offensive production of any
Indian. Curr will now be used as one of the primary running half
backs along with Lodato, Danny Spence, and John Paye, another un
heralded sophomore.
The unpredictable center position, consisting of former tackle,
C. B. Simons and two sophomores, Carl Schrader and Kent Colberg,
showed promisingly on offense and defense. Curtice is now expecting
them to add another dependable element to an already strong line.
The defense, both primary and secondary, was almost overpower
ing, as predicted, holding Tulane to 180 yards and three completed
passes. It will probably continue to be Stanford's outstanding phase of
play throughout the season. This weekend, as wilh last, however, it
will be handicapped by the lack of a filmed look at its opponents’ pre
vious 1962 game, since this will be Michigan State’s first game. Start
ing with Oregon State on October 6, there will be scouting films.
With the defense in shape, the biggest question area centers
around the attack, and how it will function when it is fully rounded.
The Indians threw only six passes against Tulane as Curtice was con
centrating on rushing. He expects to increase air traffic from now on,
though. Greater freedom to pass for the quarterbacks should make
the quarterback option Stanford’s most effective play. In last spring’s
Alumni-Varsity game, Clark Weaver displayed his potential in con
junction with the option by directing two long scoring drives pri
marily using that play. He forced the defensive ends and halfbacks
to commit themselves and would then pass on a short hook pattern
or run the ball himself accordingly. With Steve Thurlow’s ability on
the running pass perhaps even better than Weaver's, Stanford's
offense should soon shift to a greater balance between passing and
running with each phase complementing the other.

questions have been partially settled. Sophomore J. D. Lodato’s
running ability was quite impressive in his first varsity performance:
he made 37 yards in nine carries Including a 30-yard touchdown run
around end,
Curtice also successfully carried out a private experiment by
using Alan Cun', an unpublici/ed sophomore halfback. Curr respond
ed well, gaining 64 yards, the highest offensive production of any
Indian. Curr will now be used as one of the primary running half
backs along with Lodato, Danny Spence, and John Paye, another un
heralded sophomore.
The unpredictable center position, consisting of former tackle,
C. B. Simons and two sophomores, Carl Schrader and Kent Colberg,
showed promisingly on offense and defense. Curtice is now expecting
them to add another dependable element to an already strong line.
The defense, both primary and secondary, was almost overpower
ing, as predicted, holding Tulane to 180 yards and three completed
passes. It will probably continue to be Stanford's outstanding phase of
play throughout the season. This weekend, as wilh last, however, it
will be handicapped by the lack of a filmed look at its opponents’ pre
vious 1962 game, since this will be Michigan State’s first game. Start
ing with Oregon State on October 6, there will be scouting films.
With the defense in shape, the biggest question area centers
around the attack, and how it will function when it is fully rounded.
The Indians threw only six passes against Tulane as Curtice was con
centrating on rushing. He expects to increase air traffic from now on,
though. Greater freedom to pass for the quarterbacks should make
the quarterback option Stanford’s most effective play. In last spring’s
Alumni-Varsity game, Clark Weaver displayed his potential in con
junction with the option by directing two long scoring drives pri
marily using that play. He forced the defensive ends and halfbacks
to commit themselves and would then pass on a short hook pattern
or run the ball himself accordingly. With Steve Thurlow’s ability on
the running pass perhaps even better than Weaver's, Stanford's
offense should soon shift to a greater balance between passing and
running with each phase complementing the other.

After one game Stanford’s football outlook has changed very
little. It is neither brighter nor dimmer; but it is still very uncertain
as coach Jack Curtice brings his offense toward maturity. A few
questions have been partially settled. Sophomore J. D. Lodato’s
