## Indians Will Pass 
### 
“We’re still three weeks from
getting the offense in shape,”
Coach Jack Curtice admitted last
Friday night after Stanford had
beaten Tulane, 6-3,
This was obvious during the
game when Stanford appeared to
have forsaken its traditional style
of attack; absent was the usual
wide-open offensive diversifica
tion including frequent passes and
an occasional eccentrically origi
nal play. Instead Stanford stayed
on the ground in a three-yards
pef-play style reminiscent of Ok
lahoma.
Curtice explained that he was
trying to develop a dependable
ground attack and had empha
sized rushing so far this fall. A
substantial running game is ex
pected to enhance Stanford’s pass
ing, whenever Curtice decides to
bring that phase of offense out of
his attic. Therefore, the quarter
hacks were instructed to run
against Tulane, and attempted
only six passes in the game. How
ever, Curtice said he plans to pass
more against Michigan State this
weekend.
The films of the game showed
that several first-game mental
errors handicapped the Tribe’s of
fense. Quarterbacks running
away from their pass protection,
blockers hitting the wrong de
fenders, and backs mistiming
their moves or lining up incor
rectly all hurt.
Another problem was Tulane's
expert scouting and its resultant
defense. Greenie coach Tom
.O’Boyle had obtained from Stan

ford’s last year opponents films of
all ten games. On the other hand,
since O’Boyle is a new coach,
Curtice had no films and very lit
tle idea of what to expect.
Despite the Greenies’ defensive
diagnosis, however, Stanford had
too much beef for them (a 215-
203 pound advantage in the line).
Although they hit quickly on of
fense and defense, most of the
Indian interior- linemen were
troubled very little. 270-pound
tackle Chuck Buehler had partic
ular success; he brutally cut down
the right wingback, who was out
weighed by nearly one hundred
pounds, four or- five times on the
quick pitchout.
That play, worked to the short
side, was especially successful,
taking Tulane by surprise. The
Green Wave w»as expecting the
play to be run to the opposite and
shifted its fourth, roving line
backer accordingly. Further, the
defensive tackle on the short side
was hcarging hard, and the pitch
out was so quick that the runner
was past too fast for him to inter
fere, leaving Buehler, the offens
ive tackle completely free to block
downfield.
Stanford’s sick bay is compara
tively empty, today. Quarterback
Dick Ragsdale and halfback Stan
Lindskog, the team’s only place
kicker, both have ankle sprains.
Their fate for the MSU game is
still uncertain.
