### 
SAN FRANCISCO (UPD—The
San Francisco Forty-Niners yes
terday traded second-year end
Aaron Thomas to the New York
Giants for offensive halfback
Bobby Gaiters, the Giants’ lead
ing rookie of 1961.
It was a straight trade with no
cash or draft choices.
San Francisco Coach Red Hick
ey said that although he hated to
give up a player of Thomas’ cali
ber, “I believe the Forty-Niners
have a good collection of receivers
and have to give up an outstand
ing player to get one.”
Thomas, 6-3 end from Oregon
State, caught 15 passes for 301
yards and scored twice last year.
Gaiters was the Giants first
draft choice in 1961, but has been
a disappointment this year. He
has gained only 35 yards in the
Giants’ first two games.
