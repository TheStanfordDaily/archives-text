DICK METZNER, chairman of the Student Health Committee, assisted by Committee members Maxine
Anderson and Nancy Rosser, takes his dose of Polio prevention at the desk in front of Encina Hall.
The K.O. Polio campaign has reached at least three-fourths of Bay Area residents with Stage I. Two
more K.O. Polio days are scheduled, one in November and one in December, to complete the immunization cycle. Sugar lumps are being dispensed during registration to those students who were unable
to get to the Health Service Sunday.
