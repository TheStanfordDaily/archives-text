Starting their first American
classes tomorrow after two weeks
of orientation are ten ASSU for
eign scholars. The ten, who hail
from various parts of the world,
are among the few student-spon
sored foreign delegates at Stan
ford.
With twelve members of the
Foreign Scholarship Commission
the group hosteled in the Los Al
tos Hills at the Hidden Valley
Youth Hostel and covered various
areas of orientation there.
One phase of the scholars’ in
troduction to Stanford covered
foreign scholar participation in
the activities of the living groups
which will be their hosts for the
coming year.
THE COMMISSION briefed
them on the Honor Code and Fun
damental Standard as well as
other Stanford traditions. The
five-day stay also provided an op
portunity for Commission mem
bers to meet the students in order
to facilitate their work together.
A special Pre-Reg program for
foreign students continued the
orientation. Friday night the
scholars met with campus lead
ers, and they visited the Monterey
Jazz Festival, Carmel.
FOR THE remainder of their
two-week orientation period the
students stayed in Community
Club homes in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park. The Community Club
is a local women’s organization
which like the Foreign Scholar
ship Commission aims to foster in
ernational understanding.
The ten scholars were selected
by the Commission for their out
standing leadership, high academ
ic standing, and breadth of inter
ests.
