# First Cluster Officially Open
## 
### 
Stanford’s first fraternity “clus
ter” officially opened yesterday,
marking what may be a new era
in Stanford fraternity life. The
cluster, lying on the slope east of
the Knoll, houses the Phi Delts,
Kappa Sig, SAE, and the Theta
Delts. Overlooking the houses is
the “master’s house” where the
faculty advisor lives.
Plans for building clusters were
being discussed as early as 1957.
The first cluster, financed by do
nations, federal aid, and univer
sity funds cost $1,289,000.
A second cluster, now under
constructoin on the lake side of
the Knoll, is scheduled to open in
March 1963.
WHILE ALL THE houses in the
cluster are constructed of similar
materials, their individuality has
been preserved by the differences
in floor plan, elevation, and in
terior decoration.
The four fraternities selected
to move into the cluster drew for
choice of buildings and were per
mitted to include their own plans
for some of the interior decora
tion.
THE OLD SAE house and the
Phi Delt house have been demol
ished. The Theta Delt house has
been converted and now houses
the Institute for the Study of Hu
man Behavior. The Kappa Sig
house has been taken over by the
homeless Fiji’s, whose house was
destroyed in a spectacular fire in
August 1960.
Although no one can predict
what effects the new clusters will
have on Stanford fraternities,
brothers in the cluster already
claim that their fraternities are
not the same. The University is
involved in the operation of the
houses; they are new and modern
in style, and each contains the
same number of brothers.
First reactions to living in the
cluster have been nothing but
positive.
