WRITE? YOU’RE WRONG
In the recent furor over the assassination of President McKinley,
it may have escaped your notice that a nationwide study of the
writing ability of American college students has just been
published.
The survey reveals an astonishing fact: that when students
have completed their freshman year and are no longer required
to take English, their writing skill progressively declines until
we come to the fantastic situation where graduating seniors
actually are poorer writers of English than incoming freshmen!
Many theories have been offered to account for this incredible
fact. Some say that seniors know less English than freshmen
because all seniors major in French. This is not true. No more
than 94 percent of seniors major in French. How about the
other six percent?
Well sir, of the other six percent, half—or three percent
take physics, and it is not hard to understand how these poor
souls grow rusty in English when all they ever say is “E equals
MC squared.”
Of the remaining three percent, two-thirds—or two percent
major in whaling, and their English too grows feeble with
disuse. Whalers, as we all Know, do not speak at all except to
shout, “Thar she blows!” maybe twice a year.
Of the one percent remaining, it cannot be fairly said that
they are poor writers. The fact is, we don’t know what kind of
writers they are. Why not? Because they never write. And why
don’t they ever write? Because this remaining one percent of
American college students are enrolled at the University of
Alaska, and never take their mittens off.
(Incidentally, I received quite a surprise upon first visiting
Alaska two years ago when I was invited to Juneau to crown
the Queen of the Annual Date Palm Festival. Frankly I ex

pected to find a surly and morose populace. After all, going
through life with your mittens on all the time is hardly calcu
lated to make you merry as a cricket. Not only can’t you write,
but you miss out on all kinds of other fun things—like three
card monte, making shadow' pictures on the wall, and lint pick
ing. However, to my astonishment, I discovered Alaskans to
be a hale and gregarious group, mittens notwithstanding, and
I soon found out why: because mittens notwithstanding, they
could still smoke Marlboro Cigarettes, still enjoy that rich
mellow flavor, that fine, clean Selectrate filter, that truly soft
soft pack, that truly flip-top flip-top box—and that, friends,
will make anybody happy, mittens notwithstanding. In fact,
Alaskans are the happiest people I have ever met in the whole
United States—except, of course, for the Alaskan vendors of
Marlboro Cigarettes, who have not been paid in many years—
indeed, never—because how can anybody dig out coins to pay
for cigarettes when he is wearing mittens?)
But I digress. What are we going to do about this deplorable
condition where college students, having completed Freshman
English, become steadily less proficient in the use of the lan
guage? The answer is simple. We will make them take Fresh
man English all through college. In fact, we won’t let them hike
anything else! This solution, besides producing a nation of
graceful writers, will also solve another harrowing problem:
where to park on campus. If everybody takes nothing but
Freshman English, we can tear down all the schools of law,
medicine, engineering, and whaling, and turn them into parking
lots. Can t we? © I^o2m>i Bbuimu

The makers of Marlboro, who sponsor this column, plead
guilty to being among those Americans whose writing skill
is not all it might be. However, we like to think that as
tobacconists we know a thing or two. Won’t you try us and
see if you agree?
