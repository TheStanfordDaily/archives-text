In the face of the Board of Trus- 1
tees’ continuation of total campus
liquor restriction, ASSU President !
Armin Rosencranz emphasized the
fact that student government, in ;
acting as the organ of student!
will, has the power to divest itself
of the authority to carry out a

policy with which it disagrees.
In a letter to President Sterling,
summarizing one of a series of
student-administration discussions
of the present liquor impasse,
Rosencranz argued that tho spring
liquor referendum, in expressing
tho will of the student body "does
not preclude any house or resi
dence hall . , . from establishing
and enforcing its own rules re
garding consumption of liquor
within its premises.”
In view of tho fact that, strictly
speaking. California state law does
not prohibit liquor consumption
by minors in a private dwelling
or institution, Rosencranz pointed
to the restrictiveness of the Trus
tees’ July ruling, saying that at
the student-administration meet
ing "there was no general feeling
that the status quo ante would
have been substantially altered
had the Trustees chosen only to
uphold the slate law rather than
adding to it by prohibiting liquor
on the campus.” He added that
the Legislature would meet this
week to decide whether it would
relinquish control over cases of
mere consumption of liquor by
minors, not involving disorderly
conduct.
Rosencranz emphasized that
despite the more liberal appear
ance of post-referendum liquor
policy, the result will be rigor
ous adherence to the letter of the
unchanged regulation, an "attempt
to align the practice with the pol
icy,” rather than the policy with
the practice, the aspiration of
those who signed last spring’s
liquor petition.
He reaffirmed I he fact that “stu
dent government derives its au
thority directly from the Trustees
of the University,” but again
pointed out that student govern
ment may withdraw from the en
forcement of a policy “which it
had no hand in forming.”
