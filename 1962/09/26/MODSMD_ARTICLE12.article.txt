## Britain Refuses to Join U.S. In Embargo Against Castro 
### 
By United Press International
Groat Britain was reported yesterday to have refused to go along
with any free-world boycott of mounting Soviet-Cuban trade. The
British refusal of cooperation in either an official or private crack
down on the Russian buildup in Cuba clashed with West Germany’s
prompt offer to help. The Bonn government said West German
shippers starting Wednesday would need licenses to carry anything
from "guns to bananas’’ between Russia and Cuba.
The British, however, made it clear in London they would not
participate in any trade embargo or blockade of Cuba. Britain does
not believe that Cuba has any “aggressive” intentions toward the
U.S., the British sources said.
Britain thus became America’s second NATO ally to challenge
to U.S., position that free-world nations were helping undermine
Washington prestige by aiding the Soviet effort to penetrate Latin
America. Previously, Norway had taken the same attitude but on
grounds the government could not control the privately-owned ship
ping industry.
CASTRO ANNOUNCES ‘FISHING PORT’ MIAMI Premier Fidel
Castro yesterday announced that Soviet Russia is building a “fishing
port” in Cuba “to facilitate commercial fishery operations of the
Soviet fleet in the Atlantic area.” This disclosure was made over
Havana radio in the course of a speech during the signing of a
Soviet-Cuban fisheries agreement in the Cuban capital.
BARNETT PERSISTS- JACKSON, Miss.—Gov. Ross Barnett per
sisted in his open defiance of all federal authority yesterday by
again refusing to enroll Negro James Meredith in the University of
Mississippi. Barnett's actions yesterday constituted one of the most
serious challenges to federal authority since the civil war and appar
ently made him liable for arrest. Meredith arrived at 6:33 p.m. EDT
at the state office building whore Barnett was waiting for him. The
crowd booed and there were shouts of “Go homo nigger.” The Negro
student was then taken to the 10th floor where the office of the state
collegeboard is located. He declined to accept the federal summons
and read to Meredith and the others a proclamation “finally rejecting
your (Meredith’s' admission to the University of Mississippi.” The
proclamation referred to Barnett’s interposition order of Sept. 14
which said that “in order to prevent violence . . . breach of peace
. . for his own protection . . . and to preserve peace and domestic
tranquility, I do hereby deny to you, James H. Meredith, admission
to the university.
CITATIONS REFUSED - WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary
Committee, with Republicans and southern Democrats in control re
fused yesterday to vote contempt citations against four steel firms
and nine of their executives who balked at surrendering secret cost
data. On a 10-5 vote the committee rebuffed attempts to force sub
mission of the information to Sen. Estes Kefauver’s antitrust sub
committee. Kefauver said he needed to know how much it costs to
make various steel products in preparation for an overhaul of the
anti-trust laws. His argument failed to persuade a single GOP com
mittee member. The parent panel’s four southern Democrats voted
against him, too.
The lopsided vote means that eight other companies, including
U.S. Steel Corp., need not furnish cost information which they had
agreed to provide under protest months ago.
TAX RELIEF PASSES —WASHINGTON—The House, which rarely
achieves unnimity on any major issue, gave its final approval yester
day by a 361 to 0 vote to a lax relief plan to help self-employed per
sons save for retirement. A version of tax relief which professional
people have been seeking for years, the bill would allow doctors,
lawyers and others to set up tax-deductible private pension funds.
The Senate is expected to send the legislation on to the White House
Wednesday by another lopsided vote. The President, less than en
thusiastic about this revenue-losing proposal, might decide to kill
the measure by refusing to sign it before Congress adjourns.

TAX RELIEF PASSES —WASHINGTON—The House, which rarely
achieves unnimity on any major issue, gave its final approval yester
day by a 361 to 0 vote to a lax relief plan to help self-employed per
sons save for retirement. A version of tax relief which professional
people have been seeking for years, the bill would allow doctors,
lawyers and others to set up tax-deductible private pension funds.
The Senate is expected to send the legislation on to the White House
Wednesday by another lopsided vote. The President, less than en
thusiastic about this revenue-losing proposal, might decide to kill
the measure by refusing to sign it before Congress adjourns.

Groat Britain was reported yesterday to have refused to go along
with any free-world boycott of mounting Soviet-Cuban trade. The
British refusal of cooperation in either an official or private crack
down on the Russian buildup in Cuba clashed with West Germany’s
prompt offer to help. The Bonn government said West German
shippers starting Wednesday would need licenses to carry anything
from "guns to bananas’’ between Russia and Cuba.
The British, however, made it clear in London they would not
participate in any trade embargo or blockade of Cuba. Britain does
not believe that Cuba has any “aggressive” intentions toward the
U.S., the British sources said.
Britain thus became America’s second NATO ally to challenge
to U.S., position that free-world nations were helping undermine
Washington prestige by aiding the Soviet effort to penetrate Latin
America. Previously, Norway had taken the same attitude but on
grounds the government could not control the privately-owned ship
ping industry.
CASTRO ANNOUNCES ‘FISHING PORT’ MIAMI Premier Fidel
Castro yesterday announced that Soviet Russia is building a “fishing
port” in Cuba “to facilitate commercial fishery operations of the
Soviet fleet in the Atlantic area.” This disclosure was made over
Havana radio in the course of a speech during the signing of a
Soviet-Cuban fisheries agreement in the Cuban capital.
BARNETT PERSISTS- JACKSON, Miss.—Gov. Ross Barnett per
sisted in his open defiance of all federal authority yesterday by
again refusing to enroll Negro James Meredith in the University of
Mississippi. Barnett's actions yesterday constituted one of the most
serious challenges to federal authority since the civil war and appar
ently made him liable for arrest. Meredith arrived at 6:33 p.m. EDT
at the state office building whore Barnett was waiting for him. The
crowd booed and there were shouts of “Go homo nigger.” The Negro
student was then taken to the 10th floor where the office of the state
collegeboard is located. He declined to accept the federal summons
and read to Meredith and the others a proclamation “finally rejecting
your (Meredith’s' admission to the University of Mississippi.” The
proclamation referred to Barnett’s interposition order of Sept. 14
which said that “in order to prevent violence . . . breach of peace
. . for his own protection . . . and to preserve peace and domestic
tranquility, I do hereby deny to you, James H. Meredith, admission
to the university.
CITATIONS REFUSED - WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary
Committee, with Republicans and southern Democrats in control re
fused yesterday to vote contempt citations against four steel firms
and nine of their executives who balked at surrendering secret cost
data. On a 10-5 vote the committee rebuffed attempts to force sub
mission of the information to Sen. Estes Kefauver’s antitrust sub
committee. Kefauver said he needed to know how much it costs to
make various steel products in preparation for an overhaul of the
anti-trust laws. His argument failed to persuade a single GOP com

against him, too.
