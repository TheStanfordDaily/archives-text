For slightly over 9600 students,
registration for Fall Quarter
ground to a halt yesterday after
noon at 5 p.m.
For freshmen the two days of
registration climaxed, or anticli
maxed, seven days of concentrated
orientation. One precocious frosh
dolly, straggling out of the pavil
ion late Monday afternoon, noted
that “this must be the worst of
it.”
The Class of “to hell with ’66”
arrived on campus last Wednes
day. They were greeted warmly
by their faculty residents. Presi
dent Sterling addressed them in
Frost Amphitheater.
The following day Doctors
Rhinelander and Wert introduced
the Freshmen to some of Stan
ford’s traditions.
Next day in Mem Aud. The
freshmen had their first look at
Dean Winbigler. That evening
they relaxed and yelled at Frost.
The traditional Stanford spirit and
enthusiasm set in, helped by a
come from behind victory against
Tulane.
NEXT EVENING frosh up and
jollied for the Jolly Up.
Then came Sunday afternoon.
Advisors gently prepared their
lambs for the coming ordeal.
And today it’s over. Classes
have begun. Cinch notices are far
into the future.
One oright note. A bite of des
sert, Axe Day, remains. To allow
full recovery from registration,
this activity has been postponed
until Friday.
