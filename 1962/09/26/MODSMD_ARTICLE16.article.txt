Whether students through their own judicial councils will
enforce the University liquor regulation as announced by the
Trustees is the Question before Legislature tomorrow. The Future
action of the Dean’s Office may depend upon LASSU’s decision.
If the Legislature refuses to direct the men’s and women’s
judicial councils to enforce the liquor ban, the Dean of Students
may carry through with his tentative solution: to hire a special
proctor force to police the liquor ban in the absence of student
self-enforcement.
The problem facing the Legislature is this: they must define
the meaning of last spring’s liquor referendum amending ASSU
by-laws to state that “the possession, transportation, or use of in
toxicating liquors by Stanford students in the University commu
nity shall be in accordance with state law; and no judicial council
of the University shall punish a student where state law has not
been violated.”
This referendum poses many legal difficulties. Since it is an
amendment to the ASSU by-laws, it is inferior to the constitution,
which states that judicial councils have the authority to enforce
University regulations. Whether the by-law amendment can super
code the constitution is questionable. Even if it does supercede
the constitution, its meaning is ambiguous anyway. State law
allows minors to drink on this campus, yet last spring during the
referendum students were told that the amendment would not
change the policy for minors, i.e. minors would still be subject to
the jurisdiction of Men’s and Women’s Councils for drinking on
campus.
Students voted last spring for an amendment that was adver
tised as prohibiting liquor to minors, regardless of the literal
meaning of the amendment.
If LASSU intends to change the meaning of the amendment to
some other interpretation, it is obliged to consult students in an
other referendum. Otherwise, the by-law must stand with the
meaning attached to it at the time of the referendum.
If LASSU rules the amendment unconstitutional, then we are
all back where we started last April. Only now the University
seems intent on enforcihg the liquor ban.
In coming to a decision, LASSU will weigh several questions.
If student judicial councils enforce the rule against minors only,
who will do what in enforcing the rule against graduate students
over 21 living in Crothers and Crothers Memorial? And what will
be the status of undergraduates who are over 21?
The Legislature will have the kind of power this Thursday
which it has not had in two years.

who will do what in enforcing the rule against graduate students
over 21 living in Crothers and Crothers Memorial? And what will
be the status of undergraduates who are over 21?
The Legislature will have the kind of power this Thursday
which it has not had in two years.
Whether students through their own judicial councils will
enforce the University liquor regulation as announced by the
Trustees is the Question before Legislature tomorrow. The Future
action of the Dean’s Office may depend upon LASSU’s decision.
If the Legislature refuses to direct the men’s and women’s
judicial councils to enforce the liquor ban, the Dean of Students
may carry through with his tentative solution: to hire a special
proctor force to police the liquor ban in the absence of student
self-enforcement.
The problem facing the Legislature is this: they must define
the meaning of last spring’s liquor referendum amending ASSU
by-laws to state that “the possession, transportation, or use of in
toxicating liquors by Stanford students in the University commu
nity shall be in accordance with state law; and no judicial council
of the University shall punish a student where state law has not
been violated.”
This referendum poses many legal difficulties. Since it is an
amendment to the ASSU by-laws, it is inferior to the constitution,
which states that judicial councils have the authority to enforce
University regulations. Whether the by-law amendment can super
code the constitution is questionable. Even if it does supercede
the constitution, its meaning is ambiguous anyway. State law
allows minors to drink on this campus, yet last spring during the
referendum students were told that the amendment would not
change the policy for minors, i.e. minors would still be subject to
the jurisdiction of Men’s and Women’s Councils for drinking on
campus.
Students voted last spring for an amendment that was adver
tised as prohibiting liquor to minors, regardless of the literal
meaning of the amendment.
If LASSU intends to change the meaning of the amendment to
some other interpretation, it is obliged to consult students in an
other referendum. Otherwise, the by-law must stand with the
meaning attached to it at the time of the referendum.
If LASSU rules the amendment unconstitutional, then we are
all back where we started last April. Only now the University
seems intent on enforcihg the liquor ban.
In coming to a decision, LASSU will weigh several questions.
If student judicial councils enforce the rule against minors only,
who will do what in enforcing the rule against graduate students
over 21 living in Crothers and Crothers Memorial? And what will
be the status of undergraduates who are over 21?
