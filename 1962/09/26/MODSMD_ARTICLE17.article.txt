# HELSINKI: A SECOND VIEW
## Some Non-Communists Stage Festival Walk-out 
### JERRY BERG 
Some of us from Stanford had
contacted U.S. newspapers and
received press credentials in ex
change for commitments to send
stories. With these credntials we
obtained passes granting us ad
mittance to most Festival events.
The rest of our group applied for
and obtained U.S. delegate cards
through the United States Festi
val Committee, an unofficial ad
hoc committee described by
’’Newsweek” as “a small, mysteri
ous, and left-leaning organiza
tion” which “undoubtedly in
cludes a number of youthful fel
low travelers and a heavy pro
portion of political innocents.”
This group, headed by Michael
Myerson, a 1961 graduate of the
University of California, worked
closely with, and were endorsed
by, the sponsors of the Commu
nist-dominated Festival.
The Stanford students and
other members of IRS provided
a marked contrast to the majority
of delegates approved by the U.S.
Festival Committee. I don’t know
where they found their appli
cants, but they were not repre
sentative of American youth.
Long haired and bearded, sloven
ly, inconsiderate, loud, bored, de
liberately shabby—these are a
few of the adjectives which come
to mind. In line with their nihilis
tic philosophy, many busied them
selves distributing anti-U.S. prop
aganda or verbally chopping
away at their homeland for en
couraging racial inequality or for
“forcing” Russia to resume nu
clear testing. It’s difficult to es
timate their effectiveness, hut
the Communists were not unhap
py to have tame Americans who
so readily reinforced the Festi
val’s major themes.

But in spite of efforts by the
seminar chairmen to present a
united front, some pro-Western
speakers managed to gain the
floor. In one seminar Stephan Mi
chelson, a teaching assistant in
Stanford’s Department of Eco
nomics, read a paper espousing
a non-Marxist view of economics.
IN THE “FREE” Tribune Ar
min Rosencranz, the incumbent
ASSU president, gained the floor
long enough to question the Com
munists about their policies in
Hungary, Tibet, and Berlin. He
was not jeered, but the sponsors
soon remedied that by bringing
two busloads of Russians and
Poles to the hall to help the
chairman keep control.
A Russian delegate answered
the jibe about Hungary by de
claring that such charges “are
practically a dead issue which is
repeatedly brought up by West
ern propaganda peddlers.” Those
who continued to defend the West
were denounced as “speaking in
the Fascist lones of Adolf Hitler.”
REPELLED by such blatant
one-way control, a few non-Com
munist delegates walked out of
(ho Festival. Forty-four Ceylon
ese delegates left early charging
that they had been “exploited for
cold war politics.” The head of
the Ugandese delegation, Owiti
Ger—with whom several of us
became well acquainted—also left
early after stating that "In Hel
sinki no free exchange of ideas
has been possible.” Other Afri
can and Asian delegates became
disenchanted but nonetheless de
cided to remain in order to par
ticipate in the Communist-spon
sored post-Festival tours.

three-part series on the Helsinki

py to have tame Americans who
so readily reinforced the Festi
val’s major themes.

But in spite of efforts by the
seminar chairmen to present a
united front, some pro-Western
speakers managed to gain the
floor. In one seminar Stephan Mi
chelson, a teaching assistant in
Stanford’s Department of Eco
nomics, read a paper espousing
a non-Marxist view of economics.
IN THE “FREE” Tribune Ar
min Rosencranz, the incumbent
ASSU president, gained the floor
long enough to question the Com
munists about their policies in
Hungary, Tibet, and Berlin. He
was not jeered, but the sponsors
soon remedied that by bringing
two busloads of Russians and
Poles to the hall to help the
chairman keep control.
A Russian delegate answered
the jibe about Hungary by de
claring that such charges “are
practically a dead issue which is
repeatedly brought up by West
ern propaganda peddlers.” Those
who continued to defend the West
were denounced as “speaking in
the Fascist lones of Adolf Hitler.”
REPELLED by such blatant
one-way control, a few non-Com
munist delegates walked out of
(ho Festival. Forty-four Ceylon
ese delegates left early charging
that they had been “exploited for
cold war politics.” The head of
the Ugandese delegation, Owiti
Ger—with whom several of us
became well acquainted—also left
early after stating that "In Hel
sinki no free exchange of ideas
has been possible.” Other Afri
can and Asian delegates became
disenchanted but nonetheless de
cided to remain in order to par
ticipate in the Communist-spon
sored post-Festival tours.
(This is the second part of a
three-part series on the Helsinki
World Youth Festival.)
Some of us from Stanford had
contacted U.S. newspapers and
received press credentials in ex
change for commitments to send
stories. With these credntials we
obtained passes granting us ad
mittance to most Festival events.
The rest of our group applied for
and obtained U.S. delegate cards
through the United States Festi
val Committee, an unofficial ad
hoc committee described by
’’Newsweek” as “a small, mysteri
ous, and left-leaning organiza
tion” which “undoubtedly in
cludes a number of youthful fel
low travelers and a heavy pro
portion of political innocents.”
This group, headed by Michael
Myerson, a 1961 graduate of the
University of California, worked
closely with, and were endorsed
by, the sponsors of the Commu
nist-dominated Festival.
The Stanford students and
other members of IRS provided
a marked contrast to the majority
of delegates approved by the U.S.
Festival Committee. I don’t know
where they found their appli
cants, but they were not repre
sentative of American youth.
Long haired and bearded, sloven
ly, inconsiderate, loud, bored, de
liberately shabby—these are a
few of the adjectives which come
to mind. In line with their nihilis
tic philosophy, many busied them

aganda or verbally chopping
away at their homeland for en
couraging racial inequality or for
“forcing” Russia to resume nu
clear testing. It’s difficult to es
