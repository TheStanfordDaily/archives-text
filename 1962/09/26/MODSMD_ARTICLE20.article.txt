## Washington, Paris View World From Contrary Perspectives 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
There is a puzzling difference
between the world as seen from
Washington and the world as seen
from Paris. On this side of the
Atlanti ewe are preoccupied with
the Soviet challenge in Cuba and
Berlin and elsewhere. Across the
Atlantic we are preoccupied with
how the Western community is to
organize itself, and where are to
be the centers of power and de
cision. Our European allies are
concerned with the internal rela
tions of the Western coalition.
We are concerned with its exter
nal relations in Germany, South
Asia, and Latin America.

European and
American fee 1-
ings differ about
how urgent, im
mediate, and
earthshaking is
the Soviet chal
lenge. Our Euro
pean allies are
not getting ready
to call up re
serves, and they

are much less hot and bothered
about Mr. Khrushchev than we
are. Their attention is on the ef
forts of Gen. de Gaulle to woo
and envelop West Germany in or
der to create a new center of
world power. Quite evidently,
though as well aware as any man
of the challenge from the Soviet
Union, Gen. de Gaulle does not
consider it a risk to sidetrack
Great Britain, to alienate the
Commonwealth, and to cold
shoulder the United States.
YET WE must remember that
Gen. de Gaulle has rarely if ever
been wrong in judging the bal
ance of power. It is impressive to
find him acting now on the as
sumption that the Soviet Union
cannot face war with the West,
and that in conflicts short of war
—as for example, East German
harassment of West Berlin the
retaliatory means available to the
West are preponderant. For Gen.
de Gaulle there is no great ur
gency in the skirmishes and scuf
fles of the cold war, and it is quite
unnecessary, indeed undignified
and foolish, to let Moscow hypno
tize us and monopolize our atten
tion.
Thus for Gen. de Gaulle the
challenge and menace of the Sovi
et Union are transitory, and in
the course of time, if firmly con
tained, Russia is destined to re
join Europe to which she belongs.
For Europe, in Gen. de Gaulle’s
mind, extends from the Atlantic
“to the Urals.” In the meantime,
history goes on and we cannot be
stopped in order to listen to the
latest tidbit from the Kremlin.
There is much to be done which
has nothing to do with the cold
war. Franco-German enmity must
be buried. The perennial British
intervention in continental affairs
must be fended off. The unnatural
pre-eminence of the United States
as a European power must be
superceded.
THEN the grandeur and the
glory of historic Europe will be
reasserted in the lands of the old
empires.
For us this is a strange and un
familiar way of looking at the
world. But before we make up our
minds as to whether it is right or
wrong, prophetic or wishful think
ing, we had better take it in. For
it is refreshing to see one who,
unimpeachably anti-Communist,
is nevertheless free of the stereo
types and conventions of the cold
war. It is a virtue to take a fresh
and unfrightened look at the
drama of our time. For American
public opinion is being suffocated
with anxiety and stale ideas. We
can learn from Gen. de Gaulle to
quit thinking that this is the eve
of Armageddon.
Our disagreement with Gen. de
Gaulle arises from doubt wheth
er the Franco-German combina
tion can in fact take the leader-

ship of Europe and of the West
ern coalition. These doubts do not
arise from jealousy. There are
virtually no Americans who covet
the kind of pre-eminence in Eu
rope which the United States has
enjoyed since the second World
War. Historians will say that the
purpose of American policy has
really been to end that pre-emi
nence and to revive the independ
ence of Europe.
IF WE are concerned today by
Gen. de Gaulle’s policy, it is be
cause we fear that the West can
not get genuine leadership from
an attempt to absorb West Ger
many and to reject Great Britain
We feel that he is on a course
which will disrupt the unity of
the West. How can a stable center
of European and Western power
be made out of France and a di
vided Germany.
We find it significant that in
the recent celebration of Franco-
German friendship, almost noth
ing was said publicly about Ger
man reunification. So far as I
know, it was mentioned once in a
communique. What do Gen. de
Gaulle and Dr. Adenauer say to
each other about reunification
when they are speaking private
ly? I think it can be said that
almost all Americans who have
studied the German problem are
convinced that permanent parti
tion is impossible and that reuni
fication must come. If they are
right, then we cannot follow Gen.
de Gaulle who is opposed to con
tinuing discussion and negotiation
with the Soviets.
FOR A way has to be prepared
by negotiation for the eventual
but peaceable reunion of the two
Germanys. The Germans will not
give up and forget about reunifi
cation. The Western allies will not
fight a world war to conquer East
Germany for Bonn. The Soviet
Union will not hand East Ger
many over to Bonn. The only way
then is to enable the Germans
themselves to work our their re
union.
The great obstacle to this is
Herr Ulbricht and the odious
character of his East German re
gime. If Ulbricht were replaced
by a German Gomulka, if East
German communism became like
Polish communism, resistance
would disappear in Bonn and in
the West to dealing with East
Germany within the framework
of eventual reunification.
Mr. Khrushchev wants the
West to sign peace treaties with
the two Germanys. As long as
East Germany is a Stalinist state,
that cannot be done. Not only is
it impossible for us to seal the
delivery of the East Germans to
the Ulbricht regime, but it will be
impossible for Ulbricht to negoti
ate reunification with the West
Germans.
We do not suppose that Mr.
Khrushchev will replace Ulbricht
because we ask him to. Bui we
have to keep in continual diplo
matic contact with him about
Germany in order to make it ever
clearer to him that the West is
not refusing to negotiate with the
Soviet Union or even in the long
run with East Germany. It is re
fusing to take the step which
would compel it to negotiate with
Ulbricht.
