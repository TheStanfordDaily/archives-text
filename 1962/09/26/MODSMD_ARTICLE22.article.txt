## Festival Riots Sensationalized By U.S. Press 
### RON BASS Contributing Editor 
Probably the most heavily pub
licized aspect of the first few days
was the rioting of Finnish stu
dents on Mannerheiminvagen.
The sensationalism that these
demonstrations received in the
American press was unwarranted.
Most definitely the majority of
Finnish students were unhappy
with the Festival, History has
given these people little reason to
be fond of the Soviet Union. Fin
land’s geographical proximity to
the Soviet Union adds to Finnish
fears of Russian domination.

When the two student organiza
tions sponsoring the Festival, lUS
(headquarters in Prague) and
WFDY (Budapest), held the Fes
tival preparatory meeting in
Stockholm, they did not invite
either of the two Finnish student
unions. One of these unions. SYL,
sent word that they considered
the choosing of Helsinki as a
Festival site to be a violation of
Finnish neutrality .

AT II P.M., July 28 .over 2000
Finnish students gathered on
Mannerheim. They had been
pushed around by the Commu
nists and they wore angry. They
shouted “Free Finland,” “Down
with the Communists,” and “Has
another note come?”, referring to
the frequent notes from the
Kremlin bearing Festival de
mands.

The next night the town turned
out in coat and tie for the evening
riots. We saw the police squad
making effective use of wooden
clubs, charging horses and tear
gas. The students quickly realized
that they had registered their dis
pleasure with the Festival and
saw no point in having their
brains smashed in with nightly
displays of Finns’ inhumanity to
Finns. So after stoning a few Rus
sian busses as a parting gesture
they retired.

The several demonstrations
which followed throughout the
week were instigated by “Teddy
Boys,” teenage youngsters simply
looking for a fight. The police
joyfully obliged. Meanwhile the
nightly teen rumbles were passed
off by the Communists as the
work of professional fascist pro
vocateurs (us).

ON SUNDAY afternoon the
delegations began massing in the
town's larger squares for the pa
rade to the Opening Ceremonies
in the Olympic Stadium. It was a
two-mile walk from our dorm, but
well worth the trip. The streets
were lined with over 200,000 peo
ple, and at first glance I decided
to put on the Festival pin that I
had been given with my press
pass. It took me about one block
to realize that I had better take it
off. They looked as though they
were awaiting a funeral proces
sion. A group of thirty Russians
were singing folk songs on one
corner, while the crowd stared at
them noiselessly. We were told
that the crowd lining Mannerheim
gave each delegation a coldly po
lite hand .Except one. The large
delegation of Finnish Commu
nists were met by hostile silence.

Inside the stadium, the stands
had been Jammed with a more
sympathetic audience. We sat
next to the West German Com
munists, about 700 of them, and
watched as each delegation circled
the track complete with flags,
costumes and banners. The style
of applause is somewhat frighten
ing to a Westerner, as they clap
in robot-like unison. Soon the par
ticipating number reaches 50,000
and they begin to chant “mi-ri
druzh-bah,” Russian for “peace
and friendship.”
It began to rain, hard. Too bad.
Five of us huddled under one um
brella and shouted “Fair-weather
Reds!” at the fleeing crowd.
There was still enough enthusi
asm to give the Cubans a shat
tering ovation to chants of “Fi
del, Fi-del.”

AFTER I he opening ceremonies,
the Festivals’ propaganda value
began to deteriorate. The “Hel
sinki Youth News” turned up
each morning with glaring re
minders of Communist setbacks,
as well as excerpts from Djilas’
“Conversations With Stalin.” The
news spread swiftly that East
German delegates were defecting
so quickly that their ship had to
be kept under lock and key. The
Swiss Center’s exhibit on democ
racy became one of the Festival’s
most popular attractions. The
Soviet Union, too, found it diffi
cult to reconcile the theme of
“Peace and Friendship” with
their August 3th resumption of
nuclear testing.
The greatest damage to the
propaganda effort, however, came
from the mistakes of the Festi
val organizers. The object of the
Festival was not to impress the
Iron Curtain countries, whose
delegates were already loyal
Communists, but rather to con
centrate on the politically uncom
mitted nations. It was in this cru
cial area that the Communists
frequently outsmarted them
selves.
