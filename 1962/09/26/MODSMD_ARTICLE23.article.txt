# Bolivian Revolution: , Not Political
## 
### R. G. OFFUTT 
Bolivia’s history is character
ized perhaps more than that of
any other South American coun
try by revolutions. An appropri
ate joke describes two “cholos,”
a word used to describe both
mixed bloods and civilized In
dians, examining an electric mo
tor for the first time. After a
while one exclaims, "Just imagine
3500 revolutions per minute.”
There have been revolts against
the Incas, the colonial forces, and
the government after independ
ence, Colloquially certain lamp
posts in La Paz are named after
the politicians who were hung
from them. The most recent revo
lution marked its 10th anniver
sary in April, the “social revolu
tion” of 1952 .
In the elections of 1951 only a
small percentage of the popula
tion cast ballots due to a limited
suffrage scheme, and Sr. Victor
Paz Estenssoro, the National Rev
olutionary Movement’s (MNR)
candidate, was elected. A military
junta prevented him from taking

office. Most of the MNR leaders
including Paz himself were in
political exile in Argentina, and
they led a revolt resulting in the
death of 3000 persons guarantee
ing the election results. After a
short retirement in 1956 Paz was
re-elected in 1960.
THIS ULTIMATE Bolivian rev
olution claims to be one of the
three genuine "social revolutions”
in Latin America. The others
were the Mexican revolution of
1910, whose lessons are already
marred by the cobwebs of history,
and the Castroist revolution in
Cuba, which has already betrayed
its principles for most western
observers. This situation leaves
the Bolivian movement the most
accessible for analysis.
What happened?
Paz got off to a brave start,
but motives were sometimes
questionable. His first term of of
fice saw the nationalization of
the tin mines, (he inauguration of
a land reform, and the granting
of universal suffrage without in
come or literacy requirements.
These are basic reforms, em
bodied in one form or another in
the Charta of Purrta del Este, and
desired by the citizenry in many
Latin American countries. The
result in Bolivia, however, has
been a bit disappointing to say
the least.
AFTER THE nationalization of
the mines the world tin prices
dropped and the mining expenses
went up. The government found
that it cost $1.25 to produce a
pound of tin worth 90 cents. The
nationalization of the mines and
featherbedding have proved so

costly that agricultural expansion
has been stifled.
“The agrarian reform,” said
Foreign Minister Fellman Vel
larde, “made Bolivians out of
2,000,000 campesinos and made
them free men by giving them
land...” A former “latifundis
ta,” now content to smuggle
goods from the Argentine border
at Villazon to Cochamamba, told
me that the same land reform had
made Bolivia the “cloaca of South
America” and brought with it an
unprecedented “misery and na
tional humiliation.”
Both are partially right and
definitely biased, but the “misery”
seems to dominate over any ideal
istic change in the farmers social
status. The large farms have thus
far proved unproductive when
split up into small plots. Prefer
ing to live outside the national
economy the campesinos remain
in a self-sufficing agriculture, re
fusing to recognize the intricate
planned economy which allegedly
formed the basis of the agrarian
reform. These farmers cultivate
only for their own needs and con
sume almost nothing produced
by the limited mechanized indus
try.
THIS PREDICAMENT, how
ever, is not entirely attributable
to any idiosyncracies peculiar to
the Bolivian Indians. They were
left without implements, seeds
and fertilizers and remain handi
capped to this day by the most
primitive methods imaginable,
painfully inadequate transporta
tion for any surplus which might
result, and unjust channeling and
stipulations of foreign aid.

THE COMMON Latin Ameri
can problem of population dis
tribution plays a role here. The
large pre-1952 estates were con
centrated in the 10 per cent of
the land where some 75 per cent
of the inhabitants live; the Alti
piano above 10,000 feet. The rich
tropical lowlands of the Beni Ter
ritory and Santa Cruz Depart
ment were neglected and remain
practically uninhabited. The re
sult of the land reform has been
the regression of profitable es
tates to subsistence farms. It was
extremely “democratic,” but also
hopelessly ill-planned.
The introduction of universal
suffrage appears to have been
merely a means for President Es
tenssoro to assure his position.
Had the Indians been allowed to
vote in 1951, he would have un
doubtedly won by a larger ma
jority. Since then he has armed
the voting illiteracy (ca. 70 per
cent of the population) to counter
balance the eventual military
coup. In the 1961 congressional
elections up to 42 per cent ab
stained from voting in some ur
ban areas, leaving the real decis
ion to the rural non-readers
whose job was simplified by sol
diers instructing them at the
polling place.
THE ULTIMATE and unchal
lengeable aim of these reforms
has been to take the power from
the "white” minority and place
it in the hands of the Indian ma
jority, leading to the formation
of a middle class between the opu
lently rich "Patifto” society and
the coca chewing, flea-infested
campesinos.
The Bolivian people, however,
are not much better off than they

were 10 years ago. The legal
minimum wage amounts to about
16 dollars per month, but after a
bit of questioning one finds that
average earnings are only 30
cents a day.
My opinion is that a sweeping
educational reform should have
been the primary post-revolution
ary concern. Even with “free and
compulsory education” provided
by the constitution only 2.7 per
cent of the school-age children at
tend any sort of classes. Without
education the tradition-bound In
dians are unable to accept then
new power in a conservative fash
ion with any vestige of national
sentiment.

marred by the cobwebs of history,
and the Castroist revolution in
Cuba, which has already betrayed
its principles for most western
observers. This situation leaves
the Bolivian movement the most
accessible for analysis.
What happened?
Paz got off to a brave start,
but motives were sometimes
questionable. His first term of of
fice saw the nationalization of
the tin mines, (he inauguration of
a land reform, and the granting
of universal suffrage without in
come or literacy requirements.
These are basic reforms, em
bodied in one form or another in
the Charta of Purrta del Este, and
desired by the citizenry in many
Latin American countries. The
result in Bolivia, however, has
been a bit disappointing to say
the least.
AFTER THE nationalization of
the mines the world tin prices
dropped and the mining expenses
went up. The government found
that it cost $1.25 to produce a
pound of tin worth 90 cents. The
nationalization of the mines and
featherbedding have proved so

costly that agricultural expansion
has been stifled.
“The agrarian reform,” said
Foreign Minister Fellman Vel
larde, “made Bolivians out of
2,000,000 campesinos and made
them free men by giving them
land...” A former “latifundis
ta,” now content to smuggle
goods from the Argentine border
at Villazon to Cochamamba, told
me that the same land reform had
made Bolivia the “cloaca of South
America” and brought with it an
unprecedented “misery and na
tional humiliation.”
Both are partially right and
definitely biased, but the “misery”
seems to dominate over any ideal
istic change in the farmers social
status. The large farms have thus
far proved unproductive when
split up into small plots. Prefer
ing to live outside the national
economy the campesinos remain
in a self-sufficing agriculture, re
fusing to recognize the intricate
planned economy which allegedly
formed the basis of the agrarian
reform. These farmers cultivate
only for their own needs and con
sume almost nothing produced
by the limited mechanized indus
try.
THIS PREDICAMENT, how
ever, is not entirely attributable
to any idiosyncracies peculiar to
the Bolivian Indians. They were
left without implements, seeds
and fertilizers and remain handi
capped to this day by the most
primitive methods imaginable,
painfully inadequate transporta
tion for any surplus which might
result, and unjust channeling and
stipulations of foreign aid.

THE COMMON Latin Ameri
can problem of population dis
tribution plays a role here. The
large pre-1952 estates were con
centrated in the 10 per cent of
the land where some 75 per cent
of the inhabitants live; the Alti
piano above 10,000 feet. The rich
tropical lowlands of the Beni Ter
ritory and Santa Cruz Depart
ment were neglected and remain
practically uninhabited. The re
sult of the land reform has been
the regression of profitable es
tates to subsistence farms. It was
extremely “democratic,” but also
hopelessly ill-planned.
The introduction of universal
suffrage appears to have been
merely a means for President Es
tenssoro to assure his position.
Had the Indians been allowed to
vote in 1951, he would have un
doubtedly won by a larger ma
jority. Since then he has armed
the voting illiteracy (ca. 70 per
cent of the population) to counter
balance the eventual military
coup. In the 1961 congressional
elections up to 42 per cent ab
stained from voting in some ur
ban areas, leaving the real decis
ion to the rural non-readers
whose job was simplified by sol
diers instructing them at the
polling place.
THE ULTIMATE and unchal
lengeable aim of these reforms
has been to take the power from
the "white” minority and place
it in the hands of the Indian ma
jority, leading to the formation
of a middle class between the opu
lently rich "Patifto” society and
the coca chewing, flea-infested
campesinos.
The Bolivian people, however,
are not much better off than they

were 10 years ago. The legal
minimum wage amounts to about
16 dollars per month, but after a
bit of questioning one finds that
average earnings are only 30
cents a day.
My opinion is that a sweeping
educational reform should have
been the primary post-revolution
ary concern. Even with “free and
compulsory education” provided
by the constitution only 2.7 per
cent of the school-age children at
tend any sort of classes. Without
education the tradition-bound In
dians are unable to accept then
new power in a conservative fash
ion with any vestige of national
sentiment.

THIS ULTIMATE Bolivian rev

three genuine "social revolutions”

1910, whose lessons are already
marred by the cobwebs of history,
and the Castroist revolution in
Cuba, which has already betrayed
its principles for most western
observers. This situation leaves
the Bolivian movement the most
accessible for analysis.
What happened?
Paz got off to a brave start,
but motives were sometimes
questionable. His first term of of
fice saw the nationalization of
the tin mines, (he inauguration of
a land reform, and the granting
of universal suffrage without in
come or literacy requirements.
These are basic reforms, em
bodied in one form or another in
the Charta of Purrta del Este, and
desired by the citizenry in many
Latin American countries. The
result in Bolivia, however, has
been a bit disappointing to say
the least.
AFTER THE nationalization of
the mines the world tin prices
dropped and the mining expenses
went up. The government found
that it cost $1.25 to produce a
pound of tin worth 90 cents. The
nationalization of the mines and
featherbedding have proved so

costly that agricultural expansion
has been stifled.
“The agrarian reform,” said
Foreign Minister Fellman Vel
larde, “made Bolivians out of
2,000,000 campesinos and made
them free men by giving them
land...” A former “latifundis
ta,” now content to smuggle
goods from the Argentine border
at Villazon to Cochamamba, told
me that the same land reform had
made Bolivia the “cloaca of South
America” and brought with it an
unprecedented “misery and na
tional humiliation.”
Both are partially right and
definitely biased, but the “misery”
seems to dominate over any ideal
istic change in the farmers social
status. The large farms have thus
far proved unproductive when
split up into small plots. Prefer
ing to live outside the national
economy the campesinos remain
in a self-sufficing agriculture, re
fusing to recognize the intricate
planned economy which allegedly
formed the basis of the agrarian
reform. These farmers cultivate
only for their own needs and con
sume almost nothing produced
by the limited mechanized indus
try.
THIS PREDICAMENT, how
ever, is not entirely attributable
to any idiosyncracies peculiar to
the Bolivian Indians. They were
left without implements, seeds
and fertilizers and remain handi
capped to this day by the most
primitive methods imaginable,
painfully inadequate transporta
tion for any surplus which might
result, and unjust channeling and
stipulations of foreign aid.

THE COMMON Latin Ameri
can problem of population dis
tribution plays a role here. The
large pre-1952 estates were con
centrated in the 10 per cent of
the land where some 75 per cent
of the inhabitants live; the Alti
piano above 10,000 feet. The rich
tropical lowlands of the Beni Ter
ritory and Santa Cruz Depart
ment were neglected and remain
practically uninhabited. The re
sult of the land reform has been
the regression of profitable es
tates to subsistence farms. It was
extremely “democratic,” but also
hopelessly ill-planned.
The introduction of universal
suffrage appears to have been
merely a means for President Es
tenssoro to assure his position.
Had the Indians been allowed to
vote in 1951, he would have un
doubtedly won by a larger ma
jority. Since then he has armed
the voting illiteracy (ca. 70 per
cent of the population) to counter
balance the eventual military
coup. In the 1961 congressional
elections up to 42 per cent ab
stained from voting in some ur
ban areas, leaving the real decis
ion to the rural non-readers
whose job was simplified by sol
diers instructing them at the
polling place.
THE ULTIMATE and unchal
lengeable aim of these reforms
has been to take the power from
the "white” minority and place
it in the hands of the Indian ma
jority, leading to the formation
of a middle class between the opu
lently rich "Patifto” society and
the coca chewing, flea-infested
campesinos.
The Bolivian people, however,
are not much better off than they

were 10 years ago. The legal
minimum wage amounts to about
16 dollars per month, but after a
bit of questioning one finds that
average earnings are only 30
cents a day.
My opinion is that a sweeping
educational reform should have
been the primary post-revolution
ary concern. Even with “free and
compulsory education” provided
by the constitution only 2.7 per
cent of the school-age children at
tend any sort of classes. Without
education the tradition-bound In
dians are unable to accept then
new power in a conservative fash
ion with any vestige of national
sentiment.
Bolivia’s history is character
ized perhaps more than that of
any other South American coun
try by revolutions. An appropri
ate joke describes two “cholos,”
a word used to describe both
mixed bloods and civilized In
dians, examining an electric mo

posts in La Paz are named after
the politicians who were hung
from them. The most recent revo
lution marked its 10th anniver
sary in April, the “social revolu
tion” of 1952 .
In the elections of 1951 only a
small percentage of the popula
tion cast ballots due to a limited
suffrage scheme, and Sr. Victor
Paz Estenssoro, the National Rev
olutionary Movement’s (MNR)
candidate, was elected. A military
junta prevented him from taking

office. Most of the MNR leaders
including Paz himself were in
political exile in Argentina, and
they led a revolt resulting in the
death of 3000 persons guarantee
ing the election results. After a
short retirement in 1956 Paz was
re-elected in 1960.
THIS ULTIMATE Bolivian rev
olution claims to be one of the
three genuine "social revolutions”
in Latin America. The others
were the Mexican revolution of
1910, whose lessons are already
marred by the cobwebs of history,
and the Castroist revolution in
Cuba, which has already betrayed
its principles for most western
observers. This situation leaves
the Bolivian movement the most
accessible for analysis.
What happened?
Paz got off to a brave start,
but motives were sometimes
questionable. His first term of of
fice saw the nationalization of
the tin mines, (he inauguration of
a land reform, and the granting
of universal suffrage without in
come or literacy requirements.
These are basic reforms, em
bodied in one form or another in
the Charta of Purrta del Este, and
desired by the citizenry in many
Latin American countries. The
result in Bolivia, however, has
been a bit disappointing to say
the least.
AFTER THE nationalization of
the mines the world tin prices
dropped and the mining expenses
went up. The government found
that it cost $1.25 to produce a
pound of tin worth 90 cents. The
nationalization of the mines and
featherbedding have proved so

costly that agricultural expansion
has been stifled.
“The agrarian reform,” said
Foreign Minister Fellman Vel
larde, “made Bolivians out of
2,000,000 campesinos and made
them free men by giving them
land...” A former “latifundis
ta,” now content to smuggle
goods from the Argentine border
at Villazon to Cochamamba, told
me that the same land reform had
made Bolivia the “cloaca of South
America” and brought with it an
unprecedented “misery and na
tional humiliation.”
Both are partially right and
definitely biased, but the “misery”
seems to dominate over any ideal
istic change in the farmers social
status. The large farms have thus
far proved unproductive when
split up into small plots. Prefer
ing to live outside the national
economy the campesinos remain
in a self-sufficing agriculture, re
fusing to recognize the intricate
planned economy which allegedly
formed the basis of the agrarian
reform. These farmers cultivate
only for their own needs and con
sume almost nothing produced
by the limited mechanized indus
try.
THIS PREDICAMENT, how
ever, is not entirely attributable
to any idiosyncracies peculiar to
the Bolivian Indians. They were
left without implements, seeds
and fertilizers and remain handi
capped to this day by the most
primitive methods imaginable,
painfully inadequate transporta
tion for any surplus which might
result, and unjust channeling and
stipulations of foreign aid.

THE COMMON Latin Ameri
can problem of population dis
tribution plays a role here. The
large pre-1952 estates were con
centrated in the 10 per cent of
the land where some 75 per cent
of the inhabitants live; the Alti
piano above 10,000 feet. The rich
tropical lowlands of the Beni Ter
ritory and Santa Cruz Depart
ment were neglected and remain
practically uninhabited. The re
sult of the land reform has been
the regression of profitable es
tates to subsistence farms. It was
extremely “democratic,” but also
hopelessly ill-planned.
The introduction of universal
suffrage appears to have been
merely a means for President Es
tenssoro to assure his position.
Had the Indians been allowed to
vote in 1951, he would have un
doubtedly won by a larger ma
jority. Since then he has armed
the voting illiteracy (ca. 70 per
cent of the population) to counter
balance the eventual military
coup. In the 1961 congressional
elections up to 42 per cent ab
stained from voting in some ur
ban areas, leaving the real decis
ion to the rural non-readers
whose job was simplified by sol
diers instructing them at the
polling place.
THE ULTIMATE and unchal
lengeable aim of these reforms
has been to take the power from
the "white” minority and place
it in the hands of the Indian ma
jority, leading to the formation
of a middle class between the opu
lently rich "Patifto” society and
the coca chewing, flea-infested
campesinos.
The Bolivian people, however,
are not much better off than they

were 10 years ago. The legal
minimum wage amounts to about
16 dollars per month, but after a
bit of questioning one finds that
average earnings are only 30
cents a day.
My opinion is that a sweeping
educational reform should have
been the primary post-revolution
ary concern. Even with “free and
compulsory education” provided
by the constitution only 2.7 per
cent of the school-age children at
tend any sort of classes. Without
education the tradition-bound In
dians are unable to accept then
new power in a conservative fash
ion with any vestige of national
sentiment.
