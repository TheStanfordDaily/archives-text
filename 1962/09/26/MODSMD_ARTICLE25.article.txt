# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Love of School Overcomes Love of Money 
### Glenn Alford 
Stanford almost lost its number one right halfback of last year
to the hire of filthy lucre, but the well-known Stanford spirit pro
vailed over money, and Gary Craig will be on the field this season
as the Cards battle for the Big Six grid title.
Craig was rumored to be following the lead of George Honore
and Jim Smith, two gridders who

graduated last year and left
school despite retaining another
year of football eligibility. Craig,
who red-shirted his sophomore
year graduated last June. Thus
he can participate in football this
fall under the NCAA rule allow
ing an athlete four years after
his frosh year to use up his three
years of varsity eligibility.
The versatile halfback was re
ported to be earning between
$20,000 and $30,000 as the terri
torial manager of a kitchen uten
sil outfit selling door-to-door in
Oregon.
He asked permission of Coach
Jack Curtice to report a week
late to fall practice, but the Card
coach denied the request, and
said he better report no more
than a day late, or he’d be playing
his football somewhere else. Cur-

tice later relented, saying that he allowed Chuck Buehler and Bob
Burke to report late, and should extend the same courtesy to Craig.
Gary phoned Curtice the night before the deadline, from Klamath
Falls, Oregon, and found out about the new deadline. He got in his
car and drove to Stanford in time to play football.
Curtice later denied a report that Craig had offered him a job sell
ing pots and pans for his concern, although, as Curtice pointed out,
he could probably afford to.

A Two-way Performer
Craig’s football career has been marked by a striking number of
ups and downs. Though Craig cannot be termed an indispensible man,
he saw more action than any other Indian in 1961, averaging close to
40 minutes of playing time a game .He has been a two-year regular
on defense, and was a starter most of last year on offense as well.
His 185 yards were the second best by a Stanford rusher in 1961
The nadir of Craig’s playing days at Stanford was a fumbled punt
in the Stanford-Washington football game of 1960. Stanford had
come from way behind to trail only 17-10 against the great Husky-
Rose Bowl champs, and had forced the Huskies to punt. The ball,
Craig and one-half ton of Husky beef all arrived at the same place
at the same time. Craig failed to call a fair catch, and dropped the
hall when he was clobbered. Washington went on to score and win
29-10.
Craig’s best game was last year’s Big Game. He was voted the
outstanding back in the contest; doing Stanford’s punting, running
hack Cal’s kicks, playing a bang-up defensive game and scoring td's
on 24- and 4-yard runs.
May we have many more such games in 1962.
