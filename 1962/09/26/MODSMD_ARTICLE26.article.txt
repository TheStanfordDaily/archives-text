## 
### 
Robert L. “Dink” Templeton,
Olympic athlete and coach of
some of Stanford’s greatest track
and field teams, died of a heart
attack on August 7 this summer
at the age of 65. He was truly
one of the pillars of Stanford ath
letic tradition.
Mr. Templeton graduated from
Stanford in 1921 and earned a
Stanford law degree three years
later. His undergraduate athletic
career, interrupted by service in
World War I, saw him star in
football ,rugby, and high jumping
and broad jumping.
He was a member of the U.S.
learn at the 1920 Olympics in
Antwerp, where he earned a
bronze medal in the broad jump
and played fullback on the U.S.
Rugby team. In 1956, he was elect
ed to the Stanford University
Athletic Hall of Fame for his
football exploits.
He coached track and field at
Stanford from 1921 through 1939.
During those years, his powerful
Stanford teams won the Inter
collegiate Amateur Athletic As
sociation of America title four
times, finished second five times,
and third twice. His Stanford
track men won the National Col
legiate Athletic Association
crown three times and finished
second twice.
Mr. Templeton, in ill health
when he left his post as track
coach, later became a successful
and highly regarded sports col
umnist and radio commentator.
His last columns were devoted
largely to an analysis of the U.S.-

Russian track meet hold at Stan
ford Stadium just two weeks be
fore he entered the hospital on
August 4.
Stanford will miss him not
only as a great athletic figure
but also as a close friend and en
thusiastic supporter of the Uni
versity.
