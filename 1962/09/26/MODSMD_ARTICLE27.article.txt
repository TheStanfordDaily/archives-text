# Pow! Liston New Champion
## 
### JACK CUDDY UPI Sports Writer 
CHICAGO (UP!) Big Sonny
Liston, who learned to box in
prison, won the world heavy
weight championship last night
on the third fastest knockout in
heavyweight title history when
his left hook dropped Floyd Pat
terson for the full 10-second count
at 2:06 of the first round.
Liston brought (he crowd of
27,000 to its feet in Comiskey
Park when he spun the smaller
champion halfway across the ring
into (he ropes with a right upper
cut, followed by a barrage that
had him half bending through
the ropes.
It was then that big Sonny ex
ploded a terrific left hook to the
side of Patterson’s jaw and
dropped him to the canvas for his
13th knockdown during his two
tenures as champion.
Patterson gamely pushed him
self half off the canvas and re
mained there on the side of one
hip with his his right arm sup
porting him, while referee Frank
Sikora tolled off the count above
him. Patterson almost got to his
feet at the count of 10 hut not
quite.
When Liston’s hand was raised,
Patterson who seemed then to

have come partially out of the
fog attempted to rush at Liston
and resume the fight. But he was
restrained by Liston’s handlers
and ultimately by his own, as dis
appointed as he was.
Big Liston’s great triumph in
the ring’s richest all-time fight
was achieved in remarkably fast
time that was bettered in the
past only by Tommy Burns’
knockout of Jem Roche at Dub
lin, Ireland, on March 27, 1908,
in 1:28 and by Joe Louis' 2:04
kayo of Max Schmeling on June
22, 1938, in their second fight.
Liston captured the ring’s most
valuable crown in Patterson’s
10th title fight, and in so doing,

sapped the prestige of the only
man ever to recapture the heavy
weight title.
Liston, weighing 214 pounds to
Patterson’s 189, and having ad
vantages in height, ruggedness,
reach and apparently punch, did
the forcing from the opening bell,
and received only a few punches
from Patterson during their ab
breviated battle.
Meanwhile, Liston, using his
long left jah like a pile-driver,
kept shooting it at his small but
game opponent and missing al
most as often as he landed He
mixed his attack with left hooks
to the body and a few rights to
the head.
