## Fitzmorris Reinjured 
### GERALD FRY 
From the practice field today,
saddening news reaches the hope
ful Stanford fans. Tyco Fitzmor
ris, the fastest man of Stanford's
regulars and a back who was in
jured early in fall practice, to
day worked out for the first time
with some light running. How
ever, Indian fans will be sorry to
learn that Fitzmorris reinjured
his twisted knee and will be out
for the season! Luckily Stanford,
which was plagued with injuries
last season, may be able to with
stand injuries better this season
with its added depth. More bad
news:
Dick Ragsdale, star freshman
quarterback of last year, who has
performed impressively as a
safety this fall, sprained an ankle
against Tulane and will miss the
Michigan State game.
Fortunately, not all is so
gloomy. The Indians’ fine back,
Stan Lindskog, extra point and
field goal kicker, who was in
jured in the Tulane game will be
set for action Saturday against
Michigan State. Lindskog, more
over, will have a new weapon.
Braden Beck, a reserve end for
Stanford from Baton Rouge and
a high school friend of Tulane’s
kicker Gorden Rush informed
Lindskog of a kicking method

used by Rush.
The Tulane kicker laces his
shoes from the cleats to six
inches above the shoetop for
more effective kicking. Lindskog
tried it today in practice. After
wards he stated that this would
increase his kicking range by 15
yards. A 45-yard field goal would
thus be plausible. Well, if Lind
skog is right, this could be a
handy little weapon. All is not so
gloomy on the Farm, after all.
