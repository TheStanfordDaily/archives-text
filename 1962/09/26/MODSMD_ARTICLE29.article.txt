FRANK DUBOFSKY, Guard
Junior, 6-2, 220. Dubofsky is
the starting right guard and a
one-year letlerman. His defensive
play was handicapped last year
by a broken hand but he still did
an outstanding job on offense,
trap-blocking and pulling to lead
plays.

MARV HARRIS, Guard
Junior, 6-0, 219. Although han
dicapped by rather poor speed,
Harris is a rough, capable block
er, who won his letter last year.
He was also tough on defense,
making 21 tackles in ten games.
Heâ€™ll play both ways this year.
