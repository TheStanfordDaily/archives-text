TULANE’S CLEM DELLENGER (82) swoops down to grab the loose football after it hit Indian end Frank
Patitucci, while the Greenies close in on the play. The fumble occurred after a poorly kicked, 25 yard
punt. As Patitucci blocked his assigned defender for a possible punt return, the rolling ball accidently
touched him, becoming a fumble; Dellenger easily recovered it on the Stanford 35. The Greenies
scored a field goal eight plays later for their 3 points in Stanford’s 6-3 win last Friday night.
