Now, why not sur
round that new sports
shirt with that tradi
tional campus classic,
the soft, comfortable,
Shetland sweater,
perhaps in an easy
fitting cardigan.
R A’s fine selection
comes from the re
nowned Alan Paine
of Britain, and may be
seen in handsome
new Fall colours:
charcoal, fjord blue,
pebble, and olive mix.
A proper use for your
Super Charge. The
cardigan, 18.95.
