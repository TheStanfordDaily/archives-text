Tonight the Legislature meets to discuss the liquor regulation
forbidding the consumption of alcohol on campus. Married couples
in Escondido and Stanford villages may now drink with the
I Diversity's good will and faculty living on campus may decide
for themselves their responsibility to the University regulation.
Everyone else must he prepared to suffer suspension for drinking
on campus.
And now students ask themselves, should we take a hand in
enforcing a regulation with which we disagree, a regulation which
we had no part in making? And should we change our minds
three months after voting overwhelmingly to instruct our judicial
councils not to prosecute liquor cases not violating state law?
Moth these questions are far more important than the semi
legal and quasi-constitutional disputes. The constitution of the
ASSU can always he amended to deprive Men’s Council of juris
diction il the by-law amendment doing the same thing is deter
mined unconstitutional.
For the Legislature to deprive Men’s Council of jurisdiction
would he to invite the Dean to hire his proctor force and see to it
that the force patrols the campus effectively. These proctors
must not he brought to the campus. Students must not cause them
to be brought even indirectly by removing jurisdiction from Men’s
Council. Students do not want on the campus the* trappings of a
police state.
Although students may disagree with the regulation, it does
not follow that therefore they would he wise not to enforce it. If
self-enforcement will preclude proctored enforcement, then the
former is preferable. To change one’s collective mind three months
after it has been firmly made up is not so serious. Students realize
that they have not succeeded if only because they do not have the
power to succeed without the goodwill of trustees and adminis
trators. Their approval or disapproval is final and effective. Stu
dents may only protest and seek to orient these men along lines
that students may deem more reasonable.
Given that students should undertake to enforce liquor viola
tions, what should he the extent of this undertaking? To enforce
the regulation in graduate dormitories would be unfortunate.
Graduate students cause little enough trouble anyway. Legislature
might well find it unnecessary to give Men’s Council jurisdiction
in these dorms.
The Dean’s Office might well be satisfied with students’ en
forcing drinking rules among the undergraduate student body
alone.

I Diversity's good will and faculty living on campus may decide
for themselves their responsibility to the University regulation.
Everyone else must he prepared to suffer suspension for drinking
on campus.
And now students ask themselves, should we take a hand in
enforcing a regulation with which we disagree, a regulation which
we had no part in making? And should we change our minds
three months after voting overwhelmingly to instruct our judicial
councils not to prosecute liquor cases not violating state law?
Moth these questions are far more important than the semi
legal and quasi-constitutional disputes. The constitution of the
ASSU can always he amended to deprive Men’s Council of juris
diction il the by-law amendment doing the same thing is deter
mined unconstitutional.
For the Legislature to deprive Men’s Council of jurisdiction
would he to invite the Dean to hire his proctor force and see to it
that the force patrols the campus effectively. These proctors
must not he brought to the campus. Students must not cause them
to be brought even indirectly by removing jurisdiction from Men’s
Council. Students do not want on the campus the* trappings of a
police state.
Although students may disagree with the regulation, it does
not follow that therefore they would he wise not to enforce it. If
self-enforcement will preclude proctored enforcement, then the
former is preferable. To change one’s collective mind three months
after it has been firmly made up is not so serious. Students realize
that they have not succeeded if only because they do not have the
power to succeed without the goodwill of trustees and adminis
trators. Their approval or disapproval is final and effective. Stu
dents may only protest and seek to orient these men along lines
that students may deem more reasonable.
Given that students should undertake to enforce liquor viola
tions, what should he the extent of this undertaking? To enforce
the regulation in graduate dormitories would be unfortunate.
Graduate students cause little enough trouble anyway. Legislature
might well find it unnecessary to give Men’s Council jurisdiction
in these dorms.
The Dean’s Office might well be satisfied with students’ en
forcing drinking rules among the undergraduate student body
alone.
