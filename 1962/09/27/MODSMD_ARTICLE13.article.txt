# HELSINKI: A SECOND VIEW
## Russians Ask Questions About Life in America 
### JERRY BERG 
Most of us found informal con
versations with individuals more
rewarding than attending con
trolled seminars. With a few ex
ceptions, it was not difficult to
meet and talk with delegates
from most of the countries, in
cluding Russia itself.
Although we weren’t allowed
to board their ship, a few of the
Russians disembarked and min
gled freely with the crowd. Gary
Green, a Stanford senior, and I
found one Russian “youth” who
spoke English, and we conversed
for nearly 45 minutes. He patient
ly answered our questions most
ly with “yes,” “no,” or “I don’t
know.”
He was from Moscow, 45 years
old, and an official in the Minis
try of Culture. He seemed well
acquainted with Youth Festival
procedures; when we asked he
admitted that he had represented
Russia at previous festivals and
that he had been “in training” for
this one for several months be
fore coming to Helsinki.
HIS CAUTIOUS and controlled
answers contrasted sharply with
those I received during an all
night conversation I had with
some younger Russians a few
days later. During this evening,
in oi'der to escape the fumes of
the tear gas used by Finnish po
lice to break up a potential dem
onstration, I ran with Tom Grey,
another Stanford senior, and sev
eral hundred other people into a
park a couple of blocks from
Mannerheim Street.
Once in the park I discovered
that Tom had disappeared in the
crowd and that I had been run
ning alongside a group of Rus
sians, They recognized me as an
American by my shoes and imme
diately asked me if I had come
to Helsinki to incite the Finns to
riot.
Explaining that I was there to
observe the Festival, I showed
them my press card and told
them I hadn’t seen the slightest
indication that Americans were
instigating the riots. Two spoke
English and translated what I
said to the other six, after which
we all became quite friendly. We
talked in the park for awhile,
and then I accepted their invita
tion to accompany them to the
Russian ship.
WE WALKED right through
the guards at the gangway. I
followed them to a small ward
room somewhere in the bowels

of the liner. We sat down around
a long fable, Ihe door was locked,
and somebody produced a bottle
of vodka. For over three hours I
was asked practical questions
about the United States—from
how much it costs to attend a uni
versity to how many and what
kind of machines my mother has
in her home.
I mentioned that I planned to
visit Denmark and Sweden be
fore going home and they ex
pressed unhappiness that they
had to return directly to Russia.
They were quite open in discus
sing the problems posed by a
controlled press.
Communists seemed to treat
the Festival as a means to an end
rather than as an end in itself.
The stress and much of their
success came from Ihe pre- and
post-Festival tours through East
ern Europe and Russia which
were organized for most of the
delegates from Asia, Africa, and
South America. These trips and
transportation to and from the
delegates’ home countries were
financed out of the Festival’s
“solidarity fund.” At every stop
during these tours the delegates
received “red” carpet treatment.
Many were given scholarships to
study in Communist universities
before returning to their home
lands.
THIS GAMBIT brought re
wards. Many of the uncommitted
recipients with whom we spoke
were impressed and seemed, as
a direct result, to be uncommitted
no longer.
Was our trip a success? It’s
impossible to measure how suc
cessful the Communists were in
promulgating their propaganda,
and it’s just as difficult to meas
ure the effectiveness of the Stan
ford 33.
THE PRO-WESTERN speeches
in the seminars certainly were
only ripples in the sea of Party
Line propaganda. More tangible
gains came from the literally
hundreds of personal contacts we
made; we know we did a little bit
of good in this way.
But greatly outweighing what
little we might have contributed
was what we experienced per
sonally of the techniques prac
ticed by the Communists, and of
the accompanying intolerable
lack of personal freedom and
self expression.

part series on the Helsinki World
Youth Festival.)
