# HELSINKI
## 44 Disillusioned Ceylonese Cite 'Systematic Exploitation'

Hundreds of thousands of dol
lars were spent in bringing young
Africans to the Festival. Yet upon
(heir arrival, they were carted off
to a place called Nuoliti, fifteen
miles from town, while the Euro
peans were housed comfortably
in the center of Helsinki.
The Africans found transporta
tion to the city hard to come by,
and hardly worth the trouble
since many of them had no spend
ing money. It seems that the Rus
sians had stuffed the Africans’
pockets with rubles galore, hut
that rubles are not exchangeable
in Finland for local currency.
Owiti Ger, National Secretary-
General of the Democratic Party
Youth of Uganda, told us that a
Festival official had pleaded with
him to come to Helsinki, assuring
him of royal treatment at the
Festival.
UPON Owiti’s arrival, the of
ficial told him that he had no au
thority to give the Ugandese
money or to help them in any
way. Owiti spent his evenings in
the American jazz house, applied
through IRS for a scholarship to
study in the United States.
Before he left, he held a press
conference in which he told the
world press of the treatment he
had received at the hands of the
Festival committee. He calmly
pointed out that, “In Helsinki no
free exchange of ideas has been
possible, because the law of di
vide and conquer has been ap
plied. The Festival has been a
total failure.”
The image of an “open” Festi
val, with a free exchange of ideas,
was crushed rather effectively by
the indiscretions of the Festival
Guards—a breed with the colos
sal stupidity and all round nasti
ness of an unpleasant rhinoceros.
Two of us were grabbed by a
guard while leaving the Indian
delegation. The Indians were out
raged, explained that we were
their guests, and demanded an
apology. The guard, a man of ob
vious sensitivity where public re
lations were concerned, promptly
threw us out of the building. For
a minute, we thought that India
was about to declare war on Fin
land.
THE CEYLONESE declared
war on the Festival. Forty-four
very disillusioned people, they
held a press conference. They
stated that they had been “syste
matically exploited for cold war
politics,” and withdrew from the
Festival after informing the
world that “the organizers of the
Festival, taking advantage of
young people’s genuine desire for
peace and friendship throughout
the world, utilized the occasion to
put through the Communist line.”

The bitterness between East
and West was laid bare in the
massive hall of the “Colloquium
on Problems of Peace and Nation
al Independence.’’ Actually the
whole affair was a catharsis for
every Communist in town. They
paraded on and off stage all
morning, courageously exposing
the United States and Great Brit
ain as colonialists, imperialists,
fascists, war mongers, and dirty
old men.
A handful of Westerners gained
the floor to suggest traces of im
perialism in places like Hungary
and Tibet. Some were too emo
tional, others very articulate. It
mattered little, for all were jeered
off the rostrum.
THE COLLOQUIUM was fol
lowed by the “Free Tribune,” in
which everyone was to be given
a chance to speak his mind.
Laszlo Marton. a Hungarian
refugee who lived with our group
on Boulevardi. claimed the right
to speak as the leader of 6,000
Hungarian students now studying
in Western Europe.
He had written to the Festival
for credentials, but was declared
ineligible to speak as the Festival
committee had misplaced his ap
plication. He was followed by an
exchange of invective between
Africans. This brought mutual
animosity to such a pitch that
two bus-loads of Russians and
Poles were rushed in to restore
order to the devastated meeting.
TO SAY that the conference
had completely degenerated
would be an understatement.
That afternoon, a Puerto Rican
took the rostrum to inform the
a gathering that, “Puerto Rico is
occupied by the CIA and the FBI,
and professors and students are
being tortured and imprisoned.”
Many Americans laughed aloud.
“You stupid fascists may
laugh,” he continued, “but Cuba
and all Latin America will come
to our help and demolish your
Strategic Air Command bases.
You can all laugh with your Ken
nedy and his lackey Munoz Marin
because we will soon bury you
all. You can laugh because I
don’t give any of you more than
20 years of life.”
PERHAPS the most encourag
ing sight at Helsinki was the ded
ication and the hope in the faces
of young people from Cuba and
Algeria. Perhaps it was the sad
dest as well if we are to consider
what may meet this hope.
We were given a rare oppor

tunity to view Communism dur
ing its working hours. We watch
ed young Marxists repeat the
same cliches with the same in
tense expressions as the last
twenty hoys before them. We
heard their comrades applaud
them in precise, crackling unison.
To see these people in hundreds
and to know that they exist in
millions is a tragedy beyond
comprehension. The handiwork
of Communism was on display in
Helsinki; its hatred, it deceit, its
brutality. It was neither a pleas
ant thing to watch nor an easy
one to forget.

part series on the Helsinki World
Youth Festival.)
