# RECORD REVIEW
## New Baez LP Lacks 'Soul', Drama, Insight 
### BRUCE WOLFE 
Every few years an entertainer
—be he or she singer, musician,
or actor--who has interpretive
genius anti an artist’s ability to
communicate it, finds favor in the
public eye. Joan Baez’s newly
released album on Vanguard
(VRS-9112t seems to indicate
that she has found popular ac
claim but lacks the creativity (a
jazz musician would call it
“soul” t and vocal flexibility to
become a great singer and inter
preter of Folk Music.
This recording, entitled “Joan
Baez in Concert” and released
with an impressive photograph
of Miss Baez on the cover, has as
its major inadequacy a certain
lack of dramatic and creative in
sight into the material being
sung.
She does attempt drama and
notably exhibits her individualis
tic singing style in “Black Is the
Color” and “Matty Groves.” yet
she fails to show this reviewer
that her singing captures more
than a vague feeling of the spirit
and human relationships inherent
in the material which she tries
to present.
Perhaps it is the limited range
of her voice and its resulting mo
notony which keep the recording
from being more than average.
In any case, Miss Baez’s approach
also lacks the musical variety
and maturity for which Odetta,
for one, is renowned.
As a folk guitarist. Joan Baez
is very competent. She accom
panies herself throughout the al
bum, and on “Gospel Ship” and
“Matty Groves” she shows that
she is no newcomer to the instru
ment. The chord progression in
“What Have They Done to the
Rain” (she calls it, “The gentlest
protest song I know”) is pleas
ingly different, with an incom
plete cadence at the end. A few
times, in other selections (e.g.,
“Ate Amanha”) she allows her
guitar to overpower her voice
and, to compensate, increases her
vocal volume, resulting in a
rather strident presentation.
Miss Baez seems to be most ac
complished when she sings softly,
with the guitar subdued and far
in the background. Her best se
lection, in this reviewer’s opinion,
is “Geordie,” an old Scottish bal
lad which she handles with as
much grace as she can muster.
Her attempts at English and old
American songs are, for the most
part, competent. “House Carpen
ter” being one of the more suc
cessful ones.
The recording job is good, but
it is too bad that it preserves
Miss Baez’s thankfully infrequent
comments to the audience, for
they indicate that she has little
wit or charm to offer. Here, on
this album, at least, we confront
a young folksinger trying to ap
pear mature, but still acting in
somewhat the same manner as
when she entertained Palo Alto
High School audiences only a few
years ago.

This recording, entitled “Joan
Baez in Concert” and released
with an impressive photograph
of Miss Baez on the cover, has as
its major inadequacy a certain
lack of dramatic and creative in
sight into the material being
sung.
She does attempt drama and
notably exhibits her individualis
tic singing style in “Black Is the
Color” and “Matty Groves.” yet
she fails to show this reviewer
that her singing captures more
than a vague feeling of the spirit
and human relationships inherent
in the material which she tries
to present.
Perhaps it is the limited range
of her voice and its resulting mo
notony which keep the recording
from being more than average.
In any case, Miss Baez’s approach
also lacks the musical variety
and maturity for which Odetta,
for one, is renowned.
As a folk guitarist. Joan Baez
is very competent. She accom
panies herself throughout the al
bum, and on “Gospel Ship” and
“Matty Groves” she shows that
she is no newcomer to the instru
ment. The chord progression in
“What Have They Done to the
Rain” (she calls it, “The gentlest
protest song I know”) is pleas
ingly different, with an incom
plete cadence at the end. A few
times, in other selections (e.g.,
“Ate Amanha”) she allows her
guitar to overpower her voice
and, to compensate, increases her
vocal volume, resulting in a
rather strident presentation.
Miss Baez seems to be most ac
complished when she sings softly,
with the guitar subdued and far
in the background. Her best se
lection, in this reviewer’s opinion,
is “Geordie,” an old Scottish bal
lad which she handles with as
much grace as she can muster.
Her attempts at English and old
American songs are, for the most
part, competent. “House Carpen
ter” being one of the more suc
cessful ones.
The recording job is good, but
it is too bad that it preserves
Miss Baez’s thankfully infrequent
comments to the audience, for
they indicate that she has little
wit or charm to offer. Here, on
this album, at least, we confront
a young folksinger trying to ap
pear mature, but still acting in
somewhat the same manner as
when she entertained Palo Alto
High School audiences only a few
years ago.
Every few years an entertainer
—be he or she singer, musician,
or actor--who has interpretive
genius anti an artist’s ability to
communicate it, finds favor in the
public eye. Joan Baez’s newly
released album on Vanguard
(VRS-9112t seems to indicate
that she has found popular ac
claim but lacks the creativity (a
jazz musician would call it
“soul” t and vocal flexibility to
become a great singer and inter
preter of Folk Music.
