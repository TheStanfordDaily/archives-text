# BIG TEN POWER
## Formidable Michigan State Invades Farm on Saturday 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Big. strong, last mat s me
Michigan State football team this
year. Ranked somewhere in the
nation’s top five in almost every
body’s pre-season poll, MSU ar
rives in Palo Alto : oday in prep-

aration for its first game of I he
season, against Stanford this
Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
Although Spartan Coach Duffy
Daugherty has never won a Big
Ten championship, he still owns
an attractive lifetime record of
48-23-2, including a Rose Bowl
win over UCLA in 1934. Daugh
erty’s teams have also beaten
Stanford in the only three pre
vious games between the two
teams.
Daugherty is best known for
his diverse multiple-offense, a
term which has become standard
football jargon since he became
coach at MSU in 1954. The multi
ple-offense is primarily a rush
ing attack based on the elements
of speed, power, and surprise.
When the Spartans are not charg
ing straight ahead behind power
or trap blocking or on a fullback
dive, they will be moving laterally
to set up a belly series run, a
quarterback pitchout or keeper,
or a power sweep.
They will also use the rollout

I pass, although this year they
have neither an outstanding:
thrower nor a group of particu
larly skilled receivers. Neverthe
less, with all the possibilities erni
nating from the multiple-offense,
any defensive team has the great
problem of remaining flexible
until the chosen variation of (he
multiple-offense becomes appar
ent.
To run this offense successfully
(here must he speed in (he inter!-
j nr linemen so that they can pull
and run interference for wide
runs. The backs, too, must be
fast to get around the ends, but
must he powerful enough to be
threats up the middle. The quar
terback must have sound judg
ment and adequate running and
passing ability, while the ends
should block well enough to be
able to open up the running lanes
along the sidelines.
Daugherty is blessed with
players of these capabilities. Al
though he bemoans the loss of
20 lettermen, including 14 regu
lars from last year's team, he
does have 24 lettermen returning,
at least two of which are at every
| position, a more than adequate
I amount of experience consider
| ing the ability of those 24.
There are two outstanding,
probable all-American players,
fullback George Saimes and cen
ter Dave Behrman. At 186
pounds, Saimes is more noted for
his speed than for his power as a
runner. He had a 4.5 rushing av
erage last year while winning
all-Big Ten and second team all-
American selection. He is also a
| great backfield defender in all
I phases: tackling, pass defending.
! and diagnosing the opposing of
j fense,
i Behrman was an all-American
tackle last year but was shifted
j to the vacant center position this
1 fall. He weighs 253, stands 6-4,
j has good speed, and is accom
j plished in all techniques of line
j Play.
| Along with Saimes, in the hack
' field are two speedsters, Sherm
j Lewis and Dewey Lincoln. Lewis
j had a 6.4 rushing average and
1 13-yard punt return average last
j year, while Lincoln ran 5.4 yards
| per carry. In Daugherty’s winged
j T formation, Lewis is the tail
j back, the tight running back
j along with the fullback, and Lin
! coin is the wingback, used most
j ly on reverses and pltchouts.
If any part of the Spar tan team
I is particularly weak, it is the
| kicking department. The top
j three punters and place kickers
j have graduated and there are no
skilled kickers to replace them,
j MSU hopes to compensate by
! never being forced to punt or go
\ for a field goal. They will prob

ably have to kick off a few limns
however.

There are two outstanding,

fullback George Saimes and cen

his speed than for his power as a

all-Big Ten and second team all-
American selection. He is also a

tackle last year but was shifted

j plished in all techniques of line
j Play.
| Along with Saimes, in the hack
' field are two speedsters, Sherm

j had a 6.4 rushing average and
1 13-yard punt return average last
j year, while Lincoln ran 5.4 yards

ALL - AMERICAN George Saimes
will be the most dangerous man
on the field for the Michigan
State Spartans this Saturday in
the Stadium. He is their top ball
carrier and best defensive player.
Big. strong, last mat s me
Michigan State football team this
year. Ranked somewhere in the
nation’s top five in almost every
body’s pre-season poll, MSU ar
rives in Palo Alto : oday in prep-

aration for its first game of I he
season, against Stanford this
Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
Although Spartan Coach Duffy
Daugherty has never won a Big
Ten championship, he still owns
an attractive lifetime record of
48-23-2, including a Rose Bowl
win over UCLA in 1934. Daugh
erty’s teams have also beaten
Stanford in the only three pre
vious games between the two
teams.
Daugherty is best known for
his diverse multiple-offense, a
term which has become standard
football jargon since he became
coach at MSU in 1954. The multi
ple-offense is primarily a rush
ing attack based on the elements
of speed, power, and surprise.
When the Spartans are not charg
ing straight ahead behind power
or trap blocking or on a fullback
dive, they will be moving laterally
to set up a belly series run, a
quarterback pitchout or keeper,
or a power sweep.
They will also use the rollout

I pass, although this year they
have neither an outstanding:
thrower nor a group of particu
larly skilled receivers. Neverthe
less, with all the possibilities erni
nating from the multiple-offense,
any defensive team has the great
problem of remaining flexible
until the chosen variation of (he
multiple-offense becomes appar
ent.
To run this offense successfully
(here must he speed in (he inter!-
j nr linemen so that they can pull
and run interference for wide
runs. The backs, too, must be
fast to get around the ends, but
must he powerful enough to be
threats up the middle. The quar
terback must have sound judg
ment and adequate running and
passing ability, while the ends
should block well enough to be
able to open up the running lanes
along the sidelines.
Daugherty is blessed with
players of these capabilities. Al
though he bemoans the loss of
20 lettermen, including 14 regu
lars from last year's team, he
does have 24 lettermen returning,
at least two of which are at every
| position, a more than adequate
I amount of experience consider
| ing the ability of those 24.
There are two outstanding,
probable all-American players,
fullback George Saimes and cen
ter Dave Behrman. At 186
pounds, Saimes is more noted for
his speed than for his power as a
runner. He had a 4.5 rushing av
erage last year while winning
all-Big Ten and second team all-
American selection. He is also a
| great backfield defender in all
I phases: tackling, pass defending.
