# Common Market Useless Without Political Unity
## 
### KATHLEEN DOWNING 
“If Europe does not move toward political union, the present
Common Market organization will lose much of its force,” warned
Dr. Kurt Birrenbach yesterday in the first of a series of HR dis
cussions on the Atlantic Community.
Birrenbach, a member of the Parliament of the European Eco-

nomic Community and House-
Representative to the Federal
Republic of Germany, pointed out
that present superstate agencies
in Europe have a “raison d’etre
only in becoming integrated into
the wider area of the Atlantic
Community.”
PRESENT negotiations . be
tween the six western European
countries and Great Britain must
overcome the limitations of na
tional sovereign rights in order
for the entire Atlantic Commu
nity to effectively unite against
the Russian threat. Since the
solidification of friendship be
tween France and Germany, new
political unity can be achieved,
he felt.
“But political unity must grow
like a tree; it cannot be accom
plished overnight,” said Birren
bach. The Common Market can
contribute to this growth only if
it recognizes the necessity to
limit active participation in West
ern Europe. The entrance of
British Commonwealth nations
could inundate the European
markets and impair chances for
a cohesive political unity.
“THE U.S. is and will remain
the leader of the Western alli
ance," he said, “because a United
Europe alone cannot meet the
Cold War threat.” Obligations to
the U.S. include increased contri
bution to the burdens of defense
and underleveloped countries.
Reunification of Germany is
a vital concern of our country’s
foreign policy, said Birrenbach.
“Berlin is the capital and heart of
our country; it’s partition last
August leaves Europe vulnerable
—threat well understood by
France,” he expressed. The best
solution to the present stalemate
is to continue private and cultural
contacts with East Germany and
the other European satellites.
“WERE THESE satellite coun
tries to bo offered free elections,
few would vote for Communism,”
Birrenbach believes. Under the
tensions of the Atomic Age, pres
sure can be applied only in nar
row limits; ideological aggression
and trade agreements with
Prague, Budapest and other east
ern capitals can lead to a gradual
liberalization and democratization
of those countries. Self determina
tion for old Europe cannot be ig
nored in the desire for political
unification.

Through reconciliation of par
tition problems will Europe come
to a greater and a united Atlantic
community, Birrenbach con
cluded.
