## Troops May Be Used Against Barnett in "Greatest Threat" 
### 
OXFORD, Miss.—State officials compounded the gravest con
stitutional crisis of its kind since the Civil War yesterday by again
refusing to admit Negro James Meredith to the University of Mis
sissippi. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy pointed up the serious
ness of the situation yesterday night by declaring that federal troops
will be used if necessary to enforce federal court orders to admit
Meredith to the all-white school. “We will use whatever is necessary
to get the job done,” Kennedy said.
The attorney general thus personally put into words the Justice
Department’s stand on the use of troops. Heretofore when the
question of troops was raised, department officials referred newsmen
to a previous Justice Department statement that it would do what
ever necessary to see that the federal orders were carried out.
Yesterday’s defiance of a federal court order was the third such
flouting of authority in less than a week.
BEN BELLA WlNS —ALGlERS—lndependent Algeria’s first nation
al assembly last night overwhelmingly chose Ahmed Ben Bella as
premier-designate and asked the former imprisoned rebel leader to
form a government. Ben Bella became premier-designat instead of
premier because of a procedural point raised by the few members
of his opposition in the assembly.
The Algerian strongman will become premier formally when the
assembly votes on Iris cabinet—to be formed within 48 hours—and
his program. Ben Bella’s selection by a special committee was
passed by a vote of 141 to 17, with 31 deputies abstaining—far more
opposition than observers had anticipated.
SOVIETS ARRIVE —HAVANA—Six Soviet, “scientists” arrived
Wednesday aboard the Russian vessel Obdorsk only a day after the
joint Soviet-Cuban announcement of plans for a “fishing port” for
Communist deep sea trawlers to be built in fortified Havana Bay.
Experts on Soviet affairs in London said that Russian missile sub
marines almost certainly will be based in the “fishing harbor” that
the Soviets will help build inside Cuba’s fortified Havana Bay area.
FLOOD KILLS 242-BARCELONA, Spain—The worst flood in
Spanish history struck the Barcelona area Wednesday, leaving at
least 242 persons dead and 395 missing, the provincial government
announced. Hurricane winds dumped heavy rains into the parched
riverbeds of northern Spain and the floodwaters raced unchecked to
inundate villages and towns that were suffering from a long drought
only Tuesday.
STOCKPILE INVESTIGATION VOTED— WASHINGTON—The Sen
ate Armed Services Committee rejected strong Republican protests
Wednesday and voted to let its stockpile investigators examine the
tax returns of mining companies once controlled by former Treasury
Secretary George Humphrey. The 9-4 vote was announced after a
closed door session of the committee which was marked by a spirited
debate over the move.
NEW BERLIN INCIDENT— BERLIN—Western officials said a Sovi
et Mig jet fighter deliberately flew head-on toward an American
commercial airliner carrying 84 passengers on a flight to Berlin
Wednesday, veering off only seconds before a collision. It was the
third—and most serious—incident in the Berlin-Frankfurt air carri
dor over Communist East Germany in the past two days.
YUGOSLAVIA STAND TOUGHENED— WASHINGTON—The Ken
nedy administration last night lost its fight to stop Congress from
charting a new and tougher U.S. policy toward the Communist gov
ernments of Yugoslavia and Poland. The surprise defeat was admin
istered by a Senate-House conference committee as it reached agree
ment on a final compromise version of President Kennedy’s free
trade bill.
BRITISH EYE CUBA -LONDON—The British government officially
expressed “concern” yesterday over the growing Communist threat
in the Caribbean. There were hints it might reverse its earlier refusal
to help the United States halt the flow of Soviet men and arms to
Cuba. A Foreign Office spokesman in London said the United States
should not doubt but that Britain “shares their preoccupation over
developments in Cuba.”

YUGOSLAVIA STAND TOUGHENED— WASHINGTON—The Ken
nedy administration last night lost its fight to stop Congress from
charting a new and tougher U.S. policy toward the Communist gov
ernments of Yugoslavia and Poland. The surprise defeat was admin
istered by a Senate-House conference committee as it reached agree
ment on a final compromise version of President Kennedy’s free
trade bill.
BRITISH EYE CUBA -LONDON—The British government officially
expressed “concern” yesterday over the growing Communist threat
in the Caribbean. There were hints it might reverse its earlier refusal
to help the United States halt the flow of Soviet men and arms to
Cuba. A Foreign Office spokesman in London said the United States
should not doubt but that Britain “shares their preoccupation over
developments in Cuba.”
OXFORD, Miss.—State officials compounded the gravest con
stitutional crisis of its kind since the Civil War yesterday by again
refusing to admit Negro James Meredith to the University of Mis
sissippi. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy pointed up the serious
ness of the situation yesterday night by declaring that federal troops
will be used if necessary to enforce federal court orders to admit
Meredith to the all-white school. “We will use whatever is necessary
to get the job done,” Kennedy said.
The attorney general thus personally put into words the Justice
Department’s stand on the use of troops. Heretofore when the
question of troops was raised, department officials referred newsmen
to a previous Justice Department statement that it would do what
ever necessary to see that the federal orders were carried out.
Yesterday’s defiance of a federal court order was the third such
flouting of authority in less than a week.
BEN BELLA WlNS —ALGlERS—lndependent Algeria’s first nation
al assembly last night overwhelmingly chose Ahmed Ben Bella as
premier-designate and asked the former imprisoned rebel leader to
form a government. Ben Bella became premier-designat instead of
premier because of a procedural point raised by the few members
of his opposition in the assembly.
The Algerian strongman will become premier formally when the
assembly votes on Iris cabinet—to be formed within 48 hours—and
his program. Ben Bella’s selection by a special committee was
passed by a vote of 141 to 17, with 31 deputies abstaining—far more
opposition than observers had anticipated.
SOVIETS ARRIVE —HAVANA—Six Soviet, “scientists” arrived
Wednesday aboard the Russian vessel Obdorsk only a day after the
joint Soviet-Cuban announcement of plans for a “fishing port” for
Communist deep sea trawlers to be built in fortified Havana Bay.
Experts on Soviet affairs in London said that Russian missile sub
marines almost certainly will be based in the “fishing harbor” that
the Soviets will help build inside Cuba’s fortified Havana Bay area.
FLOOD KILLS 242-BARCELONA, Spain—The worst flood in
Spanish history struck the Barcelona area Wednesday, leaving at
least 242 persons dead and 395 missing, the provincial government
announced. Hurricane winds dumped heavy rains into the parched
riverbeds of northern Spain and the floodwaters raced unchecked to
inundate villages and towns that were suffering from a long drought
only Tuesday.
STOCKPILE INVESTIGATION VOTED— WASHINGTON—The Sen

Wednesday and voted to let its stockpile investigators examine the
tax returns of mining companies once controlled by former Treasury
Secretary George Humphrey. The 9-4 vote was announced after a
closed door session of the committee which was marked by a spirited
debate over the move.
NEW BERLIN INCIDENT— BERLIN—Western officials said a Sovi

commercial airliner carrying 84 passengers on a flight to Berlin
Wednesday, veering off only seconds before a collision. It was the
