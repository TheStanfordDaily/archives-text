# LASSU Discusses Liquor Tonight
## 
### 
The Legislature of the Associ
ated Students will meet tonight
to discuss last spring’s liquor
referendum amending the ASSU
by-laws thereby preventing ju
dicial councils from prosecuting

liquor “violations” that do not
break state law.
Legislature may rule on the
constitutionality of the amend
ment since the amendment seem
ingly contradicts the ASSU con
stitution, which says that judicial
councils enforce University regu
lations.
There are several possible ac
tions Legislature might take.
They might rule the by-law
amendment constitutional, in
which case they will have to in
terpret its meaning as either pro
hibiting liquor to minors on cam
pus or allowing liquor to be
drunk by anyone of any age.
IF LEGISLATURE rules the
amendment unconstitutional,
they will still have to deal with
the same basic question: what
groups of students, if any, may
drink on the campus without be
ing subject to student prosecu
tion?
Legislature will also have to
weigh the Dean’s presumed in
tention of hiring a proctor force
if students do not choose to give
Men’s Council jurisdiction over
liquor violations.
Legislature could give Men’s
Council jurisdiction over all stu
dents, over no students, over mi
nors alone, or over undergradu
ates alone. The possibilities are
myriad as are the justifications
for each possible jurisdiction.
CONCEIVABLY, no students
would be subject to action from
Men’s Council if LASSU were to
decide that state law allows any
one to drink in a private place
and if LASSU were to decide to
bind Men’s Council to this policy.
Such a policy would require
amending the constitution with a
two-thirds majority in an all
campus referendum.
Conceivably, LASSU could rule
that judicial councils have juris
diction over all students outside
the villages. LASSU would there
by enforce all of the jurisdiction
al areas where the Trustees have
declared liquor verboten.
THE LATTER policy could be
( justified on the above argument
with the additional observation
that enforcement is made easier
. if all undergraduates are covered
' regardless of age.
The meeting is scheduled for
Bowman Alumni House at 7:30
, p.m. The meeting is open to any
, one showing up.
