Reflections of Telstar
Remember the picture above? It flashed across your
television screen on a hot night last July. Perhaps
you remember that it originated from France. And
that it reached the U. S. via Telstar, the world's first
private enterprise communications satellite.
Since that summer night, the Bell System’s Telstar
has relayed electronic signals of many types-tele
vision broadcasts, telephone calls, news photographs,
and others.
But there’s one Telstar reflection you might have
missed. Look into the faces of the Bell System people
below and you’ll see it. It is the reflection of Telstar’s
success that glowed brightly on the faces of all who
shared in the project.
Their engineering, administrative and operations
skills created Telstar and are bringing its benefits
down out of the clouds to your living room.
These Bell System people, through their talented,
dedicated efforts, make your phone service still better,
more economical, and more useful.
The reflections of Telstar are many.
