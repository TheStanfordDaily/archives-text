Editor, The Daily:
In Ihe .September 24 Daily you
published a report of remarks
made by President Sterling to a
group of campus leaders, presum
ably students, on academic free
dom, political activity and Uni
versity non-partisanship. Al
though some of the remarks at
tributed to President Sterling are
clear and unexceptionable, others
seem to call for comment.
The question is how open this
academic society will be. Every
component of it, whether admin
istrator. faculty or student, is
and should be deeply concerned
about how this question is re
solved. But it seems to me to be
very important that the discus
sion center on what each person
or group ought to do, not what it
has power to do. This applies not
only to students and professors,
but also to the administration.
UNFORTUNATELY perhaps,
specific rules of conduct are dif
ficult to formulate and apply; the
only workable guides are broadly
phrased standards put in terms
of such homely academic virtues
as critical tolerance of the views
of others and responsibility and
candor in the presentation of
one’s own. This necessary vague
ness should not, however, become
an excuse for excess either in the
exercise or in the control of aca
demic freedom.
Thus I should think it unneces
sary to decide whether “the Uni
versity offers itself as a platform
for any view point students may
want to present." On matters of
legitimate concern to the Stan
ford community there ought to
be an opportunity to communi
cate. The University has an inter
est in maintaining its non-parti
san character and in avoiding
disruption of its normal func
tions, an interest which is shared
by students and faculty, but be
yond this point administrative
control over discussion raises
very serious and delicate ques
tions.
One way to avoid the charge
of partisanship is to allow all
who wish to represent a point of
view to do so, and I would sug
gest that the Free Speech Area
at the Tresidder Union provides
an opportunity for institution of
such a policy at Stanford.
It is indisputable that "what
students do in the Um

In Ihe .September 24 Daily you
published a report of remarks
made by President Sterling to a
group of campus leaders, presum
ably students, on academic free
dom, political activity and Uni
versity non-partisanship. Al
though some of the remarks at
tributed to President Sterling are
clear and unexceptionable, others
seem to call for comment.
The question is how open this
academic society will be. Every
component of it, whether admin
istrator. faculty or student, is
and should be deeply concerned
about how this question is re
solved. But it seems to me to be
very important that the discus
sion center on what each person
or group ought to do, not what it
has power to do. This applies not
only to students and professors,
but also to the administration.
UNFORTUNATELY perhaps,
specific rules of conduct are dif
ficult to formulate and apply; the
only workable guides are broadly
phrased standards put in terms
of such homely academic virtues
as critical tolerance of the views
of others and responsibility and
candor in the presentation of
one’s own. This necessary vague
ness should not, however, become
an excuse for excess either in the
exercise or in the control of aca
demic freedom.
Thus I should think it unneces
sary to decide whether “the Uni
versity offers itself as a platform
for any view point students may
want to present." On matters of
legitimate concern to the Stan
ford community there ought to
be an opportunity to communi
cate. The University has an inter
est in maintaining its non-parti
san character and in avoiding
disruption of its normal func
tions, an interest which is shared
by students and faculty, but be
