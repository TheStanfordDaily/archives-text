## Kennedy, Gov. Barnett Clashing Over Police Power of States 
### 
The Governor of Mississippi, Ross Barnett, has raised again the
question which was posed at Little Rock five years ago. It is
whether a state may use its own police and military forces to nullify
the law of the land. President Eisenhower defined the issue in 1957
when he said that “the police powers of the State of Arkansas” have
been “utilized ... to frustrate the order of the court.”
The position taken by Gov. Faubus five years ago and by Gov.
Barnett today has never, I think, been advocated or justified by the

♦maitonal leaders of Southern opin
ion. F or while they are opposed
to desegregation, they do not es
pouse the Faubus-Barnett doc
trine of nullification by for,.

as possible with integration in the
universities, in the graduate
schools of law, medicine, educa
tion, engineering, theology—and,
where it can be done without
causing social convulsions, in the
bigger colleges. The object of this
would be to train a new genera
tion of white and colored men
and women who will be leaders In
their communities.”
