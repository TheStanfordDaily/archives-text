# MOVIE REVIEW
## Hollywood 'Messes up' Hemingway's Stories 
### STEVE ZOUSMER 
“Adventures of a Young Man”
and “The Old Man and the Sea,”
two movies currently showing in
Palo Alto, are advertised as “Two
of Hemingway’s greatest.” It
could be better said: “Two ex
amples of Hollywood’s messing
up of two of Hemingway’s great
est."

Both pictures fail to do justice
to Hemingway but the late au
thor’s material is so rich that
neither movie could be a total
floperoo.
“ADVENTURES of a Young
Man,” the more recent produc
tion, is the story of a nineteen
year-old Michigan boy named
Nick Adams who feels a claustro
phobic urge to get away from his
Bible-loting, hen-pecker of a
mother (Jessica Tandy) and his
sheltered life in the Michigan
backwoods to find out what
things are all about.
The movie is composed of auto
biographical studies of the young
Hemingway, episodes that were
wonderful in “In Our Time,”
which has been called the best
collection of stories by any Amer
ican writer. They are not bad on
film either, being rather well in
tegrated although at the expense
of unfortunate condensation
which takes the punch out of one
or two of the briefer episodes and
makes a joke out of one of them
—in which young Nick watches
his doctor *ather perform a Cae
sarian childbirth in shorter time
than it took Sonny Liston to wipe
out Patterson.
The big ir.isb W he not
r. V.'mfe tS

job on a N.Y. newspaper. His
pathetic pop (Arthur Kennedy)
comes east to take him back to
Michigan and Nick refuses in or
der to continue looking at life.
These scenes are fast-moving,
witty, and rather poignant.
| Then the Hemingway touch
l fades out and screenplay writer
t A. A. Hochner steps in with a
skillful but rather trite portrayal
of Nick’s experiences as a com
missioned ambulance driver on
the Italian front during World
War I. Nick drives his ambulance
into combat to save the life of
the wounded major, played by
studly Ricardo Montalban. Later,
he is caught by mortar fire and
his legs are seriously injured.
WHAT about sex? Pretty nurse
Rosanna (Susan Strasberg)
comes along and says that he can
walk again if he has the courage
to want to. Nick had bid a fare
well to legs but her love puts
life in his legs and he walks.
Beymer shoots her a seventy-five
salute, tenderly holds out his
hands to her with the same mo
tion he learned as a Little League
first baseman. Then somebody
drops a bomb on the town and he
marries her just before she dies
of injuries.
The gluey love bit over, Nick
says farewell to his war buddies
before leaving Italy. “They don’t
give you time to find out what
it’s all about,” he tells them,
“They’ll kill you all sooner or
later. The worst thing in the
world is war.” “No,” says another
soldier, "The worst thing is de
feat.” Man can be destroyed but,
with the humility to meet life
and the courage to endure it, he
cannot be defeated.
With this in mind, Nick re
turns to Michigan to find his old
way of life unacceptable. He
