# Stanford Will Pass Against Mighty MSU's Speed and Mass
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Last Monday as the football
team’s bus pulled up to Encina
Gym, ending a pleasurable and
successful five-day road trip to
New Orleans, Quarterback Steve
Thurlow said, “The picnic is
over.” And he wasn’t just talking

about the end of summer vaca
tion.
The thought of the Michigan
State Spartan line bearing down
on him in Stanford Stadium the
following Saturday must have at
least partially inspired his re
mark.
The MSU line averages 232
pounds per man from tackle to
tackle, and it is only one of the
formidable elements in one of
the nation’s outstanding teams.
The Spartans also feature a
great, all-around, all-American
fullback, team captain George

Saimes; two other speedy backs
who averaged better than five
yards per carry last year; an all-
American center, Dave Behrman;
and unusual over-all team speed
and size all rolled into the thor
oughly - coached, unpredictable
multiple-offense of Coach Duffy
Daugherty.
WHAT DO you do against a
team like this? “Fight like hell,”
says Indian Coach Jack Curtice.
The Indians will have to fight, for
their massive, 230-pound per man
interior line, which was barely
bothered last week by Tulane’s
slighter line, will be picking on
somebody their own size tomor
row. Curtice does have some
other, more specific strategic
plans, too. He will open up the
offense which means that quar
terbacks Thurlow and Clark
Weaver will be placing the nor
mal Stanford emphasis on pass
ing. Against Tulane they threw
only six times.
Curtice also plans to substitute
liberally among his top 22 play
ers, all of whom he considers to
be on the first string. Thus he has
two complete units of equal
strength, whereas MSU may not.
If Stanford has any chance to
overpower the Spartans, it will
come when Daugherty’s second
unit is in.
Since this will be MSU’s first
game, Curtice can rely only on
pre-season publicity and films of
last year’s games for scouting
information. This disadvantage,

however, is partially compensated
for by the experience Stanford
gained in its first game. Indian
sophomore’s now have one
game's experience and Curtice
has had a chance to correct some
of the imperfections in the Tribe’s
offense and defense.
LAST YEAR Stanford held
MSU for nearly three quarters,
3-7, but finally fell, 31-3.
Stanford had good news this
week when halfback Stan Lind
skog, who sprained an ankle
against Tulane, was approved to
play; he will be used entirely as
a place kicker, however, since he
is the only experienced hoofer on
the squad.
6-2. 221-pound, sophomore
guard John Wilkin, who has been
out with a sprained ankle since
September 12, will also return for
tomorrow's game. Quarterback
Dick Ragsdale is still sidelined
with the sprained ankle he suf
fered in New Orleans last week,
and Tyce Fitzmorris, speedy jun
ior halfback, of course, is out for
the season with a knee injury.
