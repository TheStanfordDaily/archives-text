# Frosh to View Campus Clubs
## 
### 
Campus clubs, societies and
committees will be on exhibition
today from 2 to 4 p.m. on the
lawn between Wilbur and Stern
Halls.
Axe Society sponsors this Ac
tivities Day to familiarize fresh
men and transfer students with
the functions and work of vari
ous student organizations.
Representatives will be present
to explain and discuss the activi
ties of their groups with interest
ed students. Thus now students
may answer their questions about
what the organizations do and go
about joining them.
The atmosphere of this func
tion will be “friendly,” says Jim
Herold. Axe Society president.
"There will be no fear of having
to tangle with critical interview
ers,” he promises.
From two to four members will
represent each organization at
the table provided for the group.
Sign-up lists will be available, but
are for the group’s future refer
ence and not necessarily member
ship lists.
