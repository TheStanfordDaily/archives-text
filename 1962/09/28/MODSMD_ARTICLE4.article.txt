# CD Warning Test Planned at 9:30
## 
### 
Students and faculty need not
stir today when the Civil Defense
sirens sound at 9:30. It is only a
county-wide test.
Fire Chief John M. Marston
stated that any individual partici
pation is unwanted in tomorrow’s
sham-mohili/.ation. He added that
even phone calls to the fire or po
lice departments would only add
to the confusion.
The tests will begin with three
to five minutes yellow alert sig
nal (one steady blast.) Two min
utes of silence will folow. A three
minute rod alert—series of short
siren blasts will conclude the
test. The “all clear’’ signal is
missing from the agenda.
Should the siren atop the fire
station fail the test will be con
j tinued with the department’s fire
horns.
