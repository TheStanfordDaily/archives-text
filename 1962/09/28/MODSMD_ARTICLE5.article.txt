# New Union Offers Fun, Food, Sports, Talk
## 
### PAUL RICCI 
It may take half a year before
the Stanford community becomes
familiar with all that Tresidder
Memorial Union has to offer.
The building has not only brought
together many activities which
used to be scattered all over the
campus, but it has added some
that have never before existed on
University grounds.
IT TAKES only a short tour of
the Union to realize what a mar
velous job of planning it is, the
credit for which belongs to Di
rector Chester A. Barry. Meeting
rooms, kitchens, and projection
booths have been designed to pro
vide a flexible, functional physi
cal setting for social and cultural
events.
Automation and functionality—
these are the elements which im
press one most about the new
Union. Nowhere is this more evi
dent than in the dining area. A
series of automatic machines in
the self-service area makes get
ting a cup of coffee a matter of
seconds, whereas in the old Un
ion it often took over fifteen
minutes. When the Union is fully
staffed and when both employees
and patrons are familiar with
the intricacies of some of the
more exotic equipment, the serv
ice area should bo able, if neces
sary, to handle 1.100 customers
an hour during peak periods.
Equipment is designed to pro
vide continuous service without
any breaks for resupply. For in
stance, the milk machines auto
matically switch to a second can
of 160 servings when the first
can is empty, thus providing
plenty of time for replacing the
first.
AS FOOD Service Director Ray
mond Harrington summed it up,
“The whole service is predicated
on speed and quality.” As proof
of this, during the orchestra
break of last Tuesday’s Reg
Dance a horde of students de
scended on the dining room for
cold drinks and coffee. Neverthe
less, before the break was over
most students had obtained their
refreshments and were seated in
the main dining room.
The first floor of Tresidder is
given over mostly to food service.
The main dining room, new Cel
lar, and outdoor terraces can ac
commodate 700 persons. Also on
the first floor is a modern, auto
mated bowling alley (in the
southwest cornei) and a barber
shop, a bakeshop. a travel service,
a store, and a billiards room (all
in the northern half of the build
ing).
THE SECOND floor will be the
setting for most of the social and

cultural events which the Union
will host. Along the east side of
the building are music listening
rooms, an art lending library, a
record library, a stereo lounge, a
"browsing room,” and a bridge
and chess room. These will all be
serviced from a single Service
Counter located just south of the
main lobby. In the southeast cor
ner of the second floor are a
series of bright, modern offices
for ASSU.
The main information desk and
the box office are located in the
spacious lobby in the central por
tion of the building. This lobby
will soon bo the site of a special
project of the Union, a display of
valuable and unusual materials
related to the life and talents of
Leonardo Da Vinci. Finally, the
northern third of the second floor
contains various meeting rooms,
in one of which was held the
Reg Dance.
THE GUIDING philosophy of
Tresidder Memorial Union is that
it should be more than merely a
duplication of that which can be
found in Palo Alto or along El
Camino. According to Program
Director Robert Funk, a union
should also add something to a
student’s education which he can
not find in classes, namely a re
laxed atmosphere in which mem
bers of the faculty may meet and
discuss with students. Along this
line a series of informal, noninvi
tational coffee hours in being
planned in which a professor will
give about a twenty-minute talk,
step down and, over coffee, open
himself up to questions and dis
cussion from the audience.
In the forthcoming “My Last
Lecture” Series, a member of the
faculty will pretend that he is
giving the last lecture of his ca
reer. In this lecture he will say
whatever it is that life and ex
perience have taught him, what
ever it is that he feels he must
say to the world before he hangs
up his spurs for good.
Tresidder Union, with all its
automation and all its facilities,
thus has the potential of provid
ing a truly valuable contribution
to University life. As Program
Division Chairman Todd Davis
put it, “It’s just a building now.
It’s what we do with it that mat
ters.”

give about a twenty-minute talk,
step down and, over coffee, open
himself up to questions and dis
cussion from the audience.
In the forthcoming “My Last
Lecture” Series, a member of the
faculty will pretend that he is
giving the last lecture of his ca
reer. In this lecture he will say
whatever it is that life and ex
perience have taught him, what
ever it is that he feels he must
say to the world before he hangs
up his spurs for good.
Tresidder Union, with all its
automation and all its facilities,
thus has the potential of provid
ing a truly valuable contribution
to University life. As Program
Division Chairman Todd Davis
put it, “It’s just a building now.
It’s what we do with it that mat
ters.”


STANFORD COUPLE prom enades on the upper level of Tresidder Memorial Union,
It may take half a year before
the Stanford community becomes
familiar with all that Tresidder
Memorial Union has to offer.
The building has not only brought
together many activities which
used to be scattered all over the
campus, but it has added some
that have never before existed on
University grounds.
IT TAKES only a short tour of
the Union to realize what a mar
velous job of planning it is, the
credit for which belongs to Di
rector Chester A. Barry. Meeting
rooms, kitchens, and projection
booths have been designed to pro
vide a flexible, functional physi
cal setting for social and cultural
events.
Automation and functionality—
these are the elements which im
press one most about the new
Union. Nowhere is this more evi
dent than in the dining area. A
series of automatic machines in
the self-service area makes get
ting a cup of coffee a matter of
seconds, whereas in the old Un
ion it often took over fifteen
minutes. When the Union is fully
staffed and when both employees
and patrons are familiar with
the intricacies of some of the
more exotic equipment, the serv
ice area should bo able, if neces
sary, to handle 1.100 customers
an hour during peak periods.
Equipment is designed to pro
vide continuous service without
any breaks for resupply. For in
stance, the milk machines auto
matically switch to a second can
of 160 servings when the first
can is empty, thus providing
plenty of time for replacing the
first.
AS FOOD Service Director Ray
mond Harrington summed it up,
“The whole service is predicated
on speed and quality.” As proof
of this, during the orchestra
break of last Tuesday’s Reg
Dance a horde of students de
scended on the dining room for
cold drinks and coffee. Neverthe
less, before the break was over
most students had obtained their
refreshments and were seated in
the main dining room.
The first floor of Tresidder is
given over mostly to food service.
The main dining room, new Cel
lar, and outdoor terraces can ac
commodate 700 persons. Also on
the first floor is a modern, auto
mated bowling alley (in the
southwest cornei) and a barber
shop, a bakeshop. a travel service,
a store, and a billiards room (all
in the northern half of the build
ing).
THE SECOND floor will be the
setting for most of the social and

cultural events which the Union
will host. Along the east side of
the building are music listening
rooms, an art lending library, a
record library, a stereo lounge, a
"browsing room,” and a bridge
and chess room. These will all be
serviced from a single Service
Counter located just south of the
main lobby. In the southeast cor
ner of the second floor are a
series of bright, modern offices
for ASSU.
The main information desk and
the box office are located in the
spacious lobby in the central por
tion of the building. This lobby
will soon bo the site of a special
project of the Union, a display of
valuable and unusual materials
related to the life and talents of
Leonardo Da Vinci. Finally, the
northern third of the second floor
contains various meeting rooms,
in one of which was held the
Reg Dance.
THE GUIDING philosophy of
Tresidder Memorial Union is that
it should be more than merely a
duplication of that which can be
found in Palo Alto or along El
Camino. According to Program
Director Robert Funk, a union
should also add something to a
student’s education which he can
not find in classes, namely a re
laxed atmosphere in which mem
bers of the faculty may meet and
discuss with students. Along this
line a series of informal, noninvi
tational coffee hours in being
planned in which a professor will
give about a twenty-minute talk,
step down and, over coffee, open
himself up to questions and dis
cussion from the audience.

tion of the building. This lobby
will soon bo the site of a special
project of the Union, a display of
valuable and unusual materials
related to the life and talents of
Leonardo Da Vinci. Finally, the
northern third of the second floor
contains various meeting rooms,
in one of which was held the
Reg Dance.
THE GUIDING philosophy of
Tresidder Memorial Union is that
it should be more than merely a
duplication of that which can be
found in Palo Alto or along El
Camino. According to Program
Director Robert Funk, a union
should also add something to a
student’s education which he can
not find in classes, namely a re
laxed atmosphere in which mem
bers of the faculty may meet and
discuss with students. Along this
line a series of informal, noninvi
tational coffee hours in being
planned in which a professor will
give about a twenty-minute talk,
step down and, over coffee, open
himself up to questions and dis
cussion from the audience.
In the forthcoming “My Last
Lecture” Series, a member of the
faculty will pretend that he is
giving the last lecture of his ca
reer. In this lecture he will say
whatever it is that life and ex
perience have taught him, what
ever it is that he feels he must
say to the world before he hangs
up his spurs for good.
Tresidder Union, with all its
automation and all its facilities,
thus has the potential of provid
ing a truly valuable contribution
to University life. As Program
Division Chairman Todd Davis
put it, “It’s just a building now.
It’s what we do with it that mat
ters.”


STANFORD COUPLE prom enades on the upper level of Tresidder Memorial Union,
It may take half a year before
the Stanford community becomes
familiar with all that Tresidder
Memorial Union has to offer.
The building has not only brought
together many activities which
used to be scattered all over the
campus, but it has added some
that have never before existed on
University grounds.
IT TAKES only a short tour of
the Union to realize what a mar
velous job of planning it is, the
credit for which belongs to Di
rector Chester A. Barry. Meeting
rooms, kitchens, and projection
booths have been designed to pro
vide a flexible, functional physi
cal setting for social and cultural
events.
Automation and functionality—
these are the elements which im
press one most about the new
Union. Nowhere is this more evi
dent than in the dining area. A
series of automatic machines in
the self-service area makes get
ting a cup of coffee a matter of
seconds, whereas in the old Un
ion it often took over fifteen
minutes. When the Union is fully
staffed and when both employees
and patrons are familiar with
the intricacies of some of the
more exotic equipment, the serv
ice area should bo able, if neces
sary, to handle 1.100 customers
an hour during peak periods.
Equipment is designed to pro
vide continuous service without
any breaks for resupply. For in
stance, the milk machines auto
matically switch to a second can
of 160 servings when the first
can is empty, thus providing
plenty of time for replacing the
first.
AS FOOD Service Director Ray
mond Harrington summed it up,
“The whole service is predicated
on speed and quality.” As proof
of this, during the orchestra
break of last Tuesday’s Reg
Dance a horde of students de
scended on the dining room for
cold drinks and coffee. Neverthe
less, before the break was over
most students had obtained their
refreshments and were seated in
the main dining room.
The first floor of Tresidder is
given over mostly to food service.
The main dining room, new Cel
lar, and outdoor terraces can ac
commodate 700 persons. Also on
the first floor is a modern, auto
mated bowling alley (in the
southwest cornei) and a barber
shop, a bakeshop. a travel service,
a store, and a billiards room (all
in the northern half of the build
ing).
THE SECOND floor will be the
setting for most of the social and

cultural events which the Union
will host. Along the east side of
the building are music listening
rooms, an art lending library, a
record library, a stereo lounge, a
"browsing room,” and a bridge
and chess room. These will all be
serviced from a single Service
Counter located just south of the
main lobby. In the southeast cor
ner of the second floor are a
series of bright, modern offices
for ASSU.
The main information desk and
the box office are located in the
spacious lobby in the central por
tion of the building. This lobby
will soon bo the site of a special
project of the Union, a display of
valuable and unusual materials
