# 'French Society Rigid'—Crazier
## 
### 
Rigid French social divisions
restrict political activity. Dr. Mi
chel Crozier, research director in
the Institute des Sciences Soci
ales du Travail, said yesterday in
Cubberley.
In his sociological analysis of
“Bureaucracy and the French Po
litical System,” Crozier defined
these groups as professional
classes that equalize all people
within one group but inhibit ad
vancement to a higher level.
These groups stimulate intel
lectual thought, Crozier said, but
they are a “negative protective
influence,” Everything done by
political initiative, he stated, "is
done against the resistance of
groups.”
Crozier also said that centrali
zation in French politics does
not concentrate power in execu
tives. “Top officials are given
only enough leeway to solve prob
lems,” not enough to change the
organization, ho stated.
France is in the process of
changing, Crozier emphasized.
He has written a book on the
origins of French bureaucracy
which will be published soon.
Professor of History Gordon
Wright has called him one of the
men who started applying mod
ern sociological techniques to
Franco.
