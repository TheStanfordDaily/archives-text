OXFORD, Miss. (UPl)—The fear of violence and bloodshed,
engendered by the presence of 500 club-carrying state officers,
forced the federal government to change plans to enroll Negro James
Meredith into the University of Mississippi last night. The Justice
Department immediately dispatched “several hundred” marshals to
see that the task is accomplished.
The Justice Department called off its latest attempt to have
Meredith admitted to all-white university after the Negro and his
escort of 25 marshals got within 30 miles of the campus. A Justice
Department statement said the action was taken after it learned that
the force escorting Meredith “might not be sufficient to accomplish
its mission without major violence and bloodshed.”
