# LASSU Yields to Trustees’ Decision
## Annin Speaks To Legislature 
### 
Reiterating in his inaugural ad
dress to Legislature last night the
importance of students having
the right to govern their own
non-academic affairs, ASSU Pres
ident Annin Rosencranz quoted
from President Sterling’s July
remarks to the Board of Trus
tees:
“A vocal minority of students
argue that the University’s only
function is to illumine and train
their minds. I regard this argu
ment as circumstantial evidence
of students’ immaturity and as a
perversion of individualism which
savors of license and anarchy.”
IN REPLY to this quote, Ro
sencranz commented: “Lord
help this university if most of us
here in this room are not; by this
definition, licentious and anar
chistic.”
Referring to academic freedom,
Rosencranz cited the Committee
on Public Exercises and the
Founding Grant as the chief po
tential obstacles to that freedom
at Stanford. “The functions of the
Committee need more serious ex
ploration,” he continued.
Rosencranz observed that “Pres
ident Sterling in his speech to
transfer students Saturday de
clared that I had severely indicted
the University by asking it to be
tray its documentation and foun
dation” (i.e. the Founding Grant,
prohibiting partisan political ac
tivity on campus).
"Senator and Mrs. Stanford had
no desire,” Rosencranz added, “to
make Stanford archaic by tying
the University to policies which
were ppropriate for 1891 but are
considerably less appropriate for
1962.”
ROSENCRANZ spoke out for
students’ freedom to “emerge out
of our apathy and take our right
ful place of leadership in the
world student community. While
others are starving for lack of
food and for lack of freedom,
here our major concern seems to
be the lack of alcohol.”
Rosencranz also urged that
students bo allowed their right to
participate in the policy-making
deliberations of University decis
ion-making bodies.
Urging Legislature to forswear
long deliberation over minutia,
he declared his hope that “stu
dents, faculty, administration,
trustees, and students will all join
together in removing obstacles to
these freedoms so as to make this
University great.”

After two and a half hours of
meticulous debate last night, the
student Legislature adopted the
following resolutions:
1) The July decision of the
Board of Trustees to enforce Uni
versity liquor regulations renders
(the Spring liquor referendum)
inoperative.
2) IT SHALL not be considered
a violation of the Fundamental
Standard for persons over age
twenty-one to possess or consume
alcohol on campus unless he or
she violates some other associ
ated student regulation.
3) The Associated Women’s
Students shall have the power to
make and enforce its own regu
lations concerning the use of
liquor on campus by women.
The first resolution arose out
of a discussion of the possible
conflict between the constitution
and the amendment to the by
law's (the liquor referendum)
passed by the student body last
Spring.
UNDER THE constitution,
whose authority takes precedence
over by-laws, the student judicial
councils have the power to en
force University policy, of which
the recent ruling by the Board
of Trustees is a part. Under the
by-law amendment, the judicial
councils are barred from enforc
ing this particular ruling. The
first resolution formally recog
nizes the precedence of constitu
tional authority.
The second resolution was pass
ed in accordance with LASSU’s
authority to interpret the Funda
mental Standard. It was agreed
that (he judicial council’s authori
ty to prosecute liquor cases
where the violation of state law
is not involved must be derived
from the recent action by the
Board of Trustees.
IN A STATEMENT issued aft
er defeat, by a vote of 12 to 8, of
a similarly worded resolution,
ASSU president Rosencranz is
sued the following statement:
“I deplore the July decision of
the Board of Trustees to con
tinue prohibition of the consump
tion of liquor on campus by all
unmarried Stanford students,
even where no state law has been
violated.
“I regret the choice of the
j Trustees to disregard the over
whelming majority of students
who urged that the liquor policy
of the University be aligned with
state law.”

1962.”
ROSENCRANZ spoke out for
students’ freedom to “emerge out
of our apathy and take our right
ful place of leadership in the
world student community. While
others are starving for lack of
food and for lack of freedom,
here our major concern seems to
be the lack of alcohol.”
Rosencranz also urged that
students bo allowed their right to
participate in the policy-making
deliberations of University decis
ion-making bodies.
Urging Legislature to forswear
long deliberation over minutia,
he declared his hope that “stu
dents, faculty, administration,
trustees, and students will all join
together in removing obstacles to
these freedoms so as to make this
University great.”

After two and a half hours of
meticulous debate last night, the
student Legislature adopted the
following resolutions:
1) The July decision of the
Board of Trustees to enforce Uni
versity liquor regulations renders
(the Spring liquor referendum)
inoperative.
2) IT SHALL not be considered
a violation of the Fundamental
Standard for persons over age
twenty-one to possess or consume
alcohol on campus unless he or
she violates some other associ
ated student regulation.
3) The Associated Women’s
Students shall have the power to
make and enforce its own regu
lations concerning the use of
liquor on campus by women.
The first resolution arose out
of a discussion of the possible
conflict between the constitution
and the amendment to the by
law's (the liquor referendum)
passed by the student body last
Spring.
UNDER THE constitution,
whose authority takes precedence
over by-laws, the student judicial
councils have the power to en
force University policy, of which
the recent ruling by the Board
of Trustees is a part. Under the
by-law amendment, the judicial
councils are barred from enforc
ing this particular ruling. The
first resolution formally recog
nizes the precedence of constitu
tional authority.
The second resolution was pass
ed in accordance with LASSU’s
authority to interpret the Funda
mental Standard. It was agreed
that (he judicial council’s authori
ty to prosecute liquor cases
where the violation of state law
is not involved must be derived
from the recent action by the
Board of Trustees.
IN A STATEMENT issued aft
er defeat, by a vote of 12 to 8, of
a similarly worded resolution,
ASSU president Rosencranz is
sued the following statement:
“I deplore the July decision of
the Board of Trustees to con
tinue prohibition of the consump
tion of liquor on campus by all
unmarried Stanford students,
even where no state law has been
violated.
“I regret the choice of the
j Trustees to disregard the over
whelming majority of students
who urged that the liquor policy
of the University be aligned with
state law.”
Reiterating in his inaugural ad
dress to Legislature last night the
importance of students having
the right to govern their own
non-academic affairs, ASSU Pres
ident Annin Rosencranz quoted
from President Sterling’s July
remarks to the Board of Trus
tees:
“A vocal minority of students
argue that the University’s only
function is to illumine and train
their minds. I regard this argu
ment as circumstantial evidence
of students’ immaturity and as a
perversion of individualism which
savors of license and anarchy.”
IN REPLY to this quote, Ro
sencranz commented: “Lord
help this university if most of us
here in this room are not; by this
definition, licentious and anar
chistic.”
Referring to academic freedom,
Rosencranz cited the Committee
on Public Exercises and the
Founding Grant as the chief po
tential obstacles to that freedom
at Stanford. “The functions of the
Committee need more serious ex
ploration,” he continued.
Rosencranz observed that “Pres
ident Sterling in his speech to
transfer students Saturday de
clared that I had severely indicted
the University by asking it to be
tray its documentation and foun
dation” (i.e. the Founding Grant,
prohibiting partisan political ac
tivity on campus).
"Senator and Mrs. Stanford had

make Stanford archaic by tying
the University to policies which
were ppropriate for 1891 but are

passed by the student body last
Spring.
UNDER THE constitution,
whose authority takes precedence
over by-laws, the student judicial
councils have the power to en
force University policy, of which
the recent ruling by the Board
of Trustees is a part. Under the
by-law amendment, the judicial
councils are barred from enforc
ing this particular ruling. The
first resolution formally recog
nizes the precedence of constitu
tional authority.
The second resolution was pass
ed in accordance with LASSU’s
authority to interpret the Funda
mental Standard. It was agreed
that (he judicial council’s authori
ty to prosecute liquor cases
where the violation of state law
is not involved must be derived
from the recent action by the
Board of Trustees.
IN A STATEMENT issued aft
er defeat, by a vote of 12 to 8, of
a similarly worded resolution,
ASSU president Rosencranz is
sued the following statement:
“I deplore the July decision of
the Board of Trustees to con
tinue prohibition of the consump
tion of liquor on campus by all
unmarried Stanford students,
even where no state law has been
violated.
“I regret the choice of the
j Trustees to disregard the over
whelming majority of students
who urged that the liquor policy
of the University be aligned with
state law.”
Reiterating in his inaugural ad
dress to Legislature last night the
importance of students having
the right to govern their own
non-academic affairs, ASSU Pres
ident Annin Rosencranz quoted
from President Sterling’s July
remarks to the Board of Trus
tees:
“A vocal minority of students
argue that the University’s only
function is to illumine and train
their minds. I regard this argu
ment as circumstantial evidence
of students’ immaturity and as a
perversion of individualism which
savors of license and anarchy.”
IN REPLY to this quote, Ro
sencranz commented: “Lord
help this university if most of us
here in this room are not; by this
definition, licentious and anar
chistic.”
Referring to academic freedom,
Rosencranz cited the Committee
on Public Exercises and the
Founding Grant as the chief po
tential obstacles to that freedom
at Stanford. “The functions of the
Committee need more serious ex
ploration,” he continued.
Rosencranz observed that “Pres
ident Sterling in his speech to
transfer students Saturday de
clared that I had severely indicted
the University by asking it to be
tray its documentation and foun
dation” (i.e. the Founding Grant,
prohibiting partisan political ac
tivity on campus).
"Senator and Mrs. Stanford had
no desire,” Rosencranz added, “to
make Stanford archaic by tying
the University to policies which
were ppropriate for 1891 but are
considerably less appropriate for
1962.”
ROSENCRANZ spoke out for
students’ freedom to “emerge out
of our apathy and take our right
ful place of leadership in the
world student community. While
others are starving for lack of
food and for lack of freedom,
here our major concern seems to
be the lack of alcohol.”
Rosencranz also urged that
students bo allowed their right to
participate in the policy-making
deliberations of University decis
ion-making bodies.
Urging Legislature to forswear
long deliberation over minutia,
he declared his hope that “stu
dents, faculty, administration,
trustees, and students will all join
together in removing obstacles to
these freedoms so as to make this
University great.”

After two and a half hours of
meticulous debate last night, the
student Legislature adopted the
following resolutions:
1) The July decision of the
Board of Trustees to enforce Uni
versity liquor regulations renders
(the Spring liquor referendum)
inoperative.
2) IT SHALL not be considered
a violation of the Fundamental
Standard for persons over age
twenty-one to possess or consume
alcohol on campus unless he or
she violates some other associ
ated student regulation.
3) The Associated Women’s
Students shall have the power to
make and enforce its own regu
lations concerning the use of
liquor on campus by women.
The first resolution arose out
of a discussion of the possible
conflict between the constitution
and the amendment to the by
law's (the liquor referendum)
passed by the student body last
Spring.
