A midwestern college audience recently heard this answer
a talk byA.T.&T. Board Chairman, Frederick R. Rappel
“To us this is an important question because we hire
nearly 3000 college graduates yearly. To get an answer
we went to our own files and examined the records of
nearly 17.000 people. We checked each man’s compara
tive success against what he achieved in college.
“As a group, the scholars won handily. Of the men
who stood among the top third in salary for their level
of experience, more than half were also in the top third of
their college class. Only a quarter were in the bottom third.
And contrary to age-old beliefs, extracurricular activi
ties proved a lesser indicator unless the individual had an
outstanding achievement. Mere ’joining’ was not enough.
The study indicates, at least as far as the Bell System
goes, that there’s little opportunity for college students
who practice ‘diplomaship’—the belief that a diploma
automatically leads to job success. Such thinking will
not make telephone service what we know it can be.
“The men we want are men with intelligence />/«.?
those other attributes that give you the feel, the sense
that they will make things move and move well —men who
want to excel and are determined to work at it.
“Nothing short of excellence will do.”
