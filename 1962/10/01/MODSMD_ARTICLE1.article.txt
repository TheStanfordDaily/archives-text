# Winant Workers Volunteer Service in English Slum Areas
## 
### JOHN TIRRELL 
On an “Adventure Playground” in Liverpool’s
rough Scotland Road neighborhood, a husky teen
ager asks of an American volunteer-worker, “Do
you have slums like this In America?”
Surrounded by sooty and ramshackle houses
this playground, covered with bits of smashed
brick and glass and cinder, was the only recrea
tion place for hundreds of slum youngsters who
were used to playing in the streets or back alleys.
Twelve-year-olds on a week’s “holiday” at a
camp sponsored by the Rotary Club were exuber
ant to see a bathtub—but they didn’t realize or
think that bathtubs were to bathe in!
IN A TENEMENT called Grandmercy Park an
old lady looked forward to her one visitor of the
lay: a college student from New York who would
carry her shilling lunch to her from the sfttle
ment house three blocks away. The New Yorl girl
was helping for the summer in the “Roundlu use”
(Ancoats Settlement House) seen in the recent
film. “A Taste of Honey.”

This summer some seventy-four Americans
(among them four Stanford people: Susan Rob
erts, John Frohnmayer, John Bryson and myself)
found themselves pitching in and working with
“Cockneys, Bristolians, Mancuneans and Liver
puddlians” in the youth clubs and settlements of
the four English cities of London, Bristol. Man
chester and Liverpool. They were a part of the
Winant Volunteer movement which has sent over
500 Americans (including several Stanford stu
dents in past years) to England for volunteer serv
ice projects.

The Winant Volunteers (named after the U.S.
Ambassador to Britain during the last war) was
founded in 1948 by the Rev. “Tubby” Clayton,
Vicar of All Hallow’s by the Tower in London and
Chaplain to the Queen. Just after the war Tubby
stumping across America on a fund-raising cam
paign, stopped at an Eastern school to talk to the
men about the blitzed East End of London.
IN HIS INIMITABLE way the short and ro
tund parson told of the need for money and man

power to help rebuild the youth clubs and settle
ments. Then he added, “If I could just have ONE
man volunteer his services for ONE summer in
London’s Limehouse area ... If anyone could
do this would he please step forward after my
talk?” And as a body, the whole class rose to
meet Tubby’s challenge: these were the first
Winant Volunteers.

“There is no typical day in the life of a Wi
nant!” says Stanford’s John Frohnmayer. Work
varied from playground building to helping in the
Jewish Lads’ Brigade and Club to camp counseling
in Wales. After orientation—on the island of lona
off the Scottish coast—the Winants dispersed to
their four cities.

There they were divided into teams of two, each
team working for the summer in a particular club
or setlement. Winants were encouraged to get to
know' their area of England better and on free
days had the opportunity to visit Stratford-on-
Avon, the Lake District and even Ireland.
NOW BACK on the campus, the Stanford Wi

nants are unanimous about their summer’s worth
while experience. Not only did they have a great
summer and make many new friends, but they
had the chance to look more deeply into their own
purpose in life, their own scale of values, and also
to see “life in these United States” from a more
objective point of view “You don’t need to go to
London or Liverpool to find slums or even to seek
out people who need help!” said one Winant on
the plane returning to New York. And like any
one who ever has done volunteer work, the Wi
nants, too, realize that they got so much more out
of their experience than they ever gave.
There is a desperate need for more of the kind
of work the Winants have done—not only In Eng
land but in America and in the Stanford area. A
deeper concern for others has infected students of
today. Many opportunities to serve are close at
hand. In a future Daily there will be details about
the new Stanford Volunteers. Look for these and
many other ways to help others . . . and at the
same time to help yourself.

summer and make many new friends, but they
had the chance to look more deeply into their own
purpose in life, their own scale of values, and also
to see “life in these United States” from a more
objective point of view “You don’t need to go to
London or Liverpool to find slums or even to seek
out people who need help!” said one Winant on
the plane returning to New York. And like any
one who ever has done volunteer work, the Wi
nants, too, realize that they got so much more out
of their experience than they ever gave.
There is a desperate need for more of the kind
of work the Winants have done—not only In Eng
land but in America and in the Stanford area. A
deeper concern for others has infected students of
today. Many opportunities to serve are close at
hand. In a future Daily there will be details about
the new Stanford Volunteers. Look for these and
many other ways to help others . . . and at the

On an “Adventure Playground” in Liverpool’s
rough Scotland Road neighborhood, a husky teen
ager asks of an American volunteer-worker, “Do
you have slums like this In America?”
Surrounded by sooty and ramshackle houses
this playground, covered with bits of smashed
brick and glass and cinder, was the only recrea
tion place for hundreds of slum youngsters who
were used to playing in the streets or back alleys.
Twelve-year-olds on a week’s “holiday” at a
camp sponsored by the Rotary Club were exuber
ant to see a bathtub—but they didn’t realize or
think that bathtubs were to bathe in!
IN A TENEMENT called Grandmercy Park an
old lady looked forward to her one visitor of the
lay: a college student from New York who would
carry her shilling lunch to her from the sfttle
ment house three blocks away. The New Yorl girl
was helping for the summer in the “Roundlu use”
(Ancoats Settlement House) seen in the recent
film. “A Taste of Honey.”

This summer some seventy-four Americans
(among them four Stanford people: Susan Rob
erts, John Frohnmayer, John Bryson and myself)
found themselves pitching in and working with
“Cockneys, Bristolians, Mancuneans and Liver
puddlians” in the youth clubs and settlements of
the four English cities of London, Bristol. Man
chester and Liverpool. They were a part of the
Winant Volunteer movement which has sent over
500 Americans (including several Stanford stu
dents in past years) to England for volunteer serv
ice projects.

The Winant Volunteers (named after the U.S.
Ambassador to Britain during the last war) was
founded in 1948 by the Rev. “Tubby” Clayton,
Vicar of All Hallow’s by the Tower in London and
Chaplain to the Queen. Just after the war Tubby
stumping across America on a fund-raising cam
paign, stopped at an Eastern school to talk to the
men about the blitzed East End of London.
IN HIS INIMITABLE way the short and ro
tund parson told of the need for money and man

power to help rebuild the youth clubs and settle
ments. Then he added, “If I could just have ONE
man volunteer his services for ONE summer in
London’s Limehouse area ... If anyone could
do this would he please step forward after my
talk?” And as a body, the whole class rose to
meet Tubby’s challenge: these were the first
Winant Volunteers.

“There is no typical day in the life of a Wi
nant!” says Stanford’s John Frohnmayer. Work
varied from playground building to helping in the
Jewish Lads’ Brigade and Club to camp counseling
in Wales. After orientation—on the island of lona
off the Scottish coast—the Winants dispersed to
their four cities.

There they were divided into teams of two, each
team working for the summer in a particular club
or setlement. Winants were encouraged to get to
know' their area of England better and on free
days had the opportunity to visit Stratford-on-
Avon, the Lake District and even Ireland.

London’s Limehouse area ... If anyone could
do this would he please step forward after my
talk?” And as a body, the whole class rose to
meet Tubby’s challenge: these were the first
Winant Volunteers.

“There is no typical day in the life of a Wi
nant!” says Stanford’s John Frohnmayer. Work
varied from playground building to helping in the
Jewish Lads’ Brigade and Club to camp counseling
in Wales. After orientation—on the island of lona
off the Scottish coast—the Winants dispersed to
their four cities.

There they were divided into teams of two, each
team working for the summer in a particular club
or setlement. Winants were encouraged to get to
know' their area of England better and on free
days had the opportunity to visit Stratford-on-
Avon, the Lake District and even Ireland.
NOW BACK on the campus, the Stanford Wi

nants are unanimous about their summer’s worth
while experience. Not only did they have a great
summer and make many new friends, but they
had the chance to look more deeply into their own
purpose in life, their own scale of values, and also
to see “life in these United States” from a more
objective point of view “You don’t need to go to
London or Liverpool to find slums or even to seek
out people who need help!” said one Winant on
the plane returning to New York. And like any
one who ever has done volunteer work, the Wi
nants, too, realize that they got so much more out
of their experience than they ever gave.
There is a desperate need for more of the kind
of work the Winants have done—not only In Eng
land but in America and in the Stanford area. A
deeper concern for others has infected students of
today. Many opportunities to serve are close at
hand. In a future Daily there will be details about
the new Stanford Volunteers. Look for these and
many other ways to help others . . . and at the
same time to help yourself.
On an “Adventure Playground” in Liverpool’s
rough Scotland Road neighborhood, a husky teen
ager asks of an American volunteer-worker, “Do
you have slums like this In America?”
Surrounded by sooty and ramshackle houses
this playground, covered with bits of smashed
brick and glass and cinder, was the only recrea
tion place for hundreds of slum youngsters who
were used to playing in the streets or back alleys.
Twelve-year-olds on a week’s “holiday” at a
camp sponsored by the Rotary Club were exuber
ant to see a bathtub—but they didn’t realize or
think that bathtubs were to bathe in!
IN A TENEMENT called Grandmercy Park an
old lady looked forward to her one visitor of the
lay: a college student from New York who would
carry her shilling lunch to her from the sfttle
ment house three blocks away. The New Yorl girl
was helping for the summer in the “Roundlu use”
(Ancoats Settlement House) seen in the recent
film. “A Taste of Honey.”

This summer some seventy-four Americans
(among them four Stanford people: Susan Rob
erts, John Frohnmayer, John Bryson and myself)
found themselves pitching in and working with
“Cockneys, Bristolians, Mancuneans and Liver
puddlians” in the youth clubs and settlements of
the four English cities of London, Bristol. Man
chester and Liverpool. They were a part of the
Winant Volunteer movement which has sent over
500 Americans (including several Stanford stu
dents in past years) to England for volunteer serv
ice projects.

The Winant Volunteers (named after the U.S.
Ambassador to Britain during the last war) was
founded in 1948 by the Rev. “Tubby” Clayton,
Vicar of All Hallow’s by the Tower in London and
Chaplain to the Queen. Just after the war Tubby
stumping across America on a fund-raising cam
paign, stopped at an Eastern school to talk to the
men about the blitzed East End of London.
IN HIS INIMITABLE way the short and ro
tund parson told of the need for money and man

power to help rebuild the youth clubs and settle
ments. Then he added, “If I could just have ONE
man volunteer his services for ONE summer in
London’s Limehouse area ... If anyone could
do this would he please step forward after my
talk?” And as a body, the whole class rose to
meet Tubby’s challenge: these were the first
