## Miss. Students Riot As Barnett Yields 
### 
OXFORD, Miss. (UPl)—Rioting broke out last night and
three people were shot in demonstrations here against the admis
sion of Negro war veteran James H. Meredith to the University
of Mississippi.
As U.S. Marshals battled a mob of students with tear gas

bombs, a shotgun blast ripped
across the campus. It was not
known immediately who fired the
shots. It was learned that some
of the demonstrators were armed
and had the weapons hidden on
the campus.
THE MARSHALS fired tear
gas on the mobs of students even
as President Kennedy was appeal
ing to them to accept the admis
sion of the 29-year-old Negro.
A number of persons were hurt.
The Mississippi Highway Pa
trol had barred the campus to all
but students and faculty, but the
students went on a rampage.
The beleaguered marshals fired
one barrage of tear gas after an
other. They attempted to clear
the entire campus. The jeering
throng gave way reluctantly to
the onslaught of the milky white
gas.
Meredith was brought onto the
campus in early evening and was
secreted in an apartment. He was
not enrolled because it was Sun
day. His registration as a student
is expected today.
GOV, ROSS Barnett stayed in
the state capitol of Jackson.
It appeared he had capitulated
to a tremendous show of force by
the United States government.
Mississippi state patrolmen made
to attempt to prevent the mar
shals from going onto the cam
pus.
But the students did not take
it so calmly.
Several thousand students wore
massed in front of the adminis
tration building.
The students threw lighted
cigarettes on the canvas top of a
truck carrying the U.S, marshals.
The canvas caught fire but the
marshals jumped out and put it
out.
It was then the marshals used
tear gas.
STUDENTS, screaming and
yelling, bolted from in front of
the administration building.
Chancellor J. D. Williams used
a loud speaker to urge students to
go back to their dormitories.
While all this was happening,
Meredith was at Barter dormi
tory. Approximately 15 marshals
were with him.
MEANWHILE in Washington
President Kennedy appealed to
rioting University of Mississippi
students to show their patriotism
by “quickly and quietly” obeying
the law and closing the books on
the integration case of James H.
Meredith.
Even as U.S. marshals were
forced to use tear gas against the
rioting student mob, the Presi
dent told them:
“You have a new opportunity
to show that you are men of pa
triotism and integrity. The most
effective means of upholding law
is not the state police or the mar
shals or the National Guard.
“It is you. It lies in your cour
age to accept those laws with
which you disagree as well as
those with which you agree.”
MEREDITH’S registration as
a student would end the 144-year
all-white tradition of “Ole Miss.”
Mississippi’s Gov. Ross Barnett,
who had vowed it would never
happen, made no move to block
this, the fifth attempt, to enroll
the 29-year-old Air Force veteran
in the 114-year-old school.
