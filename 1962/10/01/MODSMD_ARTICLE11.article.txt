# Social Welfare Is Aim Of Stanford Volunteers
## 
### 
This week the Stanford Volun
teers will begin to enlist the sup
port of the campus community
for performing numerous social
welfare projects in the peninsula
area.
Al Shevach, chairman of the
new organization, cites forty odd
institutions that the volunteers
plan to serve. Among them arc
the Stanford Convalescent Home,
the Veterans’ Hospital, and the
Stanford-Palo Alto Hospital.
In addition, Shevach mentioned
that special projects might in
clude the founding and maintain
ing of youth clubs similar to
those sponsored by Oxford and
Cambridge Universities in the
east end of London.
“If a volunteer contributes hut
fifteen minutes of his time to
drive a paraplegic patient from
home to hospital, we will have
justified our existence,” Shevach
continued.
For further information, those
interested in volunteering should
either call DA 1-2300, extension
2840 between 2 and 4 p.m. on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
only, or contact their living group
representative.
