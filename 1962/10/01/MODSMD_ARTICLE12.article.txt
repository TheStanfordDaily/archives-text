# Gov. Barnett

### 
Governor Barnett and President Kennedy have succeeded in
averting a national disgrace more pronounced that the disgrace
the Governor has already brought upon himself, his state, and his
country. In refusing to enroll a Negro, Mr. James Meredith, in the
state university, the Governor was defying the law of the land as
interpreted by the federal courts. Just as important, the Governor
was denying a basic right to a member of a minority.
As the military-political drama proceeded, its publicity had
tended to obscure the issue in question: shall every American have
the right to equal opportunity in seeking an education? Or shall
only white Americans have that right? The courts have declared
that all Americans shall have that right, and for a while a state
Governor was doing all in his power to deny that right. If he had
persisted, he would have been crushed, and he wovdd have asked
to have been crushed. There was a good chance that if Barnett
had not yielded, federal troops woidd have “invaded” Mississippi
and would have routed its state police all for the purpose of
bringing Mississippi into the Twentieth Century.
It was the task of the Attorney General to prevent Barnett
from having himself crushed, for if it had been necessary to enroll
James Meredith by force and to imprison the Governor, then
race relations would have been set back several years. No one
questioned, least of all the Attorney General, that a test of force
would have been calamitous. A test of force would have engen
dered further resentment against Negroes in the South, would
have cast the nation in an unfavorable light before the world,
and wmdd have damaged the Democratic party in the South. As
the President’s campaign manager in 1960, Robert Kennedy was
in an unexcelled position to know that the Democratic party
could not afford to lose the South.
Whatever the moral issues involved, the primary motivation
for integration comes from both political parties, which desire to
win the increasingly large Negro vote in the North. The inherent
paradox within the Democratic party has prevented their taking
an inflexibly liberal position on Negro civil rights. The Democratic
organization must court northern Negroes without losing the alle
giance of Southern whites. To push hard for Negro rights is to
lose Southern support, and to ignore Negro rights is to lose the
support of northern N 'groes.
The Republican party seeks the northern Negro vote as eagerly
as does the Democratic, The result ot President Eisenhower’s
sending troops to Little Rock in 1957 was a greater allegiance to
the GOP. Regardless of the political party in power in Washington,
the northern Negro vote supplemented by the potential Negro
vote in the South is sufficiently a political reality that Governor
Barnett could not hav. hoped to defy any Washington government
over the issue of segregation.

If Governor Barnett lives by atliffereiM morality from that of
most Americans, lie probably cannot be persuaded to change his
outlook. He could only be forced to accept (he hard realities of
national politics. He was in a struggle he could not win. He has
saved his constituents from great misfortune by choosing to lose
gracefully.
