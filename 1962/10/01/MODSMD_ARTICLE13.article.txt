Editor, The Daily:
I should like to comment on
the current "liquor on campus”
controversy. It seems to me that
no one has even considered the
fact that the Board of Trustees
has a perfect right to declare any
policy it pleases as it is the au
thority on this question. Each
student was aware of its authori
ty when he came and now has no
right to disregard its rulings just
because they seem foolish. Be
side the fact that the Board may
be right, it is the governing body
and if any student feels that his
voice in the matter is not being
properly respected, he may es
cape this intolerable situation
no one will stop him.
As I mentioned before, the
Board may have good reason for
its stand. I shall assume that they
feel college students, even those
over 21, are not yet mature
enough for liquor. It has been ar
gued that any boy old enough to
bear arms should be considered
an adult and given adult liquor
rights. I find this conclusion in
valid as one may be treated as an
adult in many areas and still not
be one. For example, one may be
licensed to drive at 16, at which
lime it is assumed one can make
certain judgements in a mature
manner. Shall we begin to drink

|at 16? One must begin ic pay
adult fares on busses at the age
of 12. Should 12 be the legal age
for liquor consumption or per
haps should be the age as every
first-grader must be mature
enough to know when it’s safe
for him to cross the street—sure
ly, this is proof that he is an
adult. As a matter of fact, Gesell,
who studied the physical and
mental development of the hu
man child, stated that the human
organism is in its biological in
fancy until approximately the
age of 24. Man is neither physical
ly, emotionally, nor mentally
mature until about that time.
Therefore fellow students, you
are not (he adults you claim to
be. The very fact that we are stu
dents, still learning and forming
judgments, shows that the world
does not consider our conclusions
sufficiently seasoned by experi
ence in order for us to practice
our professions or to teach others
what we profess to know.
So I say to every student, in
cluding our eminent Student
Body President, that we certain
ly are not adults yet, we have not
yet the right to be masters of all
we do, specifically, we are not
mature enough to handle liquor
on the Stanford campus—now or
ever.
