# HELSINKI REBUTTAL
## Stanford Participant Believes Festival Actually 'Non-political' 
### DALE L. JOHNSON 
As a member of the Stanford
group in Helsinki I have natural
ly been following with greatest
interest The Daily articles by Ron
Bass and Jerry Berg. At the com
pletion of the series I find myself
wondering if we were at the same
Festival, so different are our im
pressions.
Since the general image of the
Festival conveyed by both au
thors seems to have been that of
a rigged, carefully controlled,
highly politicized gathering of
world youth (manipulated handi
ly by aged communist profession
als), I wish to direct my own
comments and observations to
this central point.
LIKE Mr. Berg and Mr. Bass, I
went to Helsinki with expecta
tions that the communists were
going to put on a real show, in
the manner described above. Un
like the previous authors, how
ever, I found my expectations
shattered by reality.
The Festival was, in fact, amaz
ingly non-political. A participant
actually had to go considerably
out of the way to become in
volved in real controversy, partic
ularly on the formal level. Con
trary to the notions that Daily
readers must now have, seminars
with political topics were infre
quently scheduled.
For example, in the nine days
of organized activity, there were
three days with no scheduled po
litical events, one day with one
seminar, four days with three
events, and only a single day in
which there were as many as four
seminars that could in any sense
be considered political.
ACTUALLY there was only one
clearly political event, besides the
“Free Tribune” which immediate
ly deteriorated to the level of
name calling. That part of the
program was a three-day "Col
loquium on problems of peace
and national independence.” I
went one day to find it over
crowded with East Europeans
and rather dull.
Apparently, a good deal of re
sentment was engendered in
these seminars when the chair
would attempt to put down those
participants bubbling over with
anti-communist invective. Other
topics were typically on the prob
lems of young workers or rural
youth, or such rather uninspiring
themes as ‘The position and role
of girl students in universities
and in the student movement.”
In sharp contrast to this de
emphasis of things directly polit
ical was the nearly overwhelming
variety of amazingly good enter
tainment. An average of over 62
cultural and athletic events were
scheduled daily.
MOST OF the politics of the
Festival, therefore, occurred on
the informal level. However, even
in talking informally with dele
gates from other nations, it was
often difficult to engage in a seri
ous political discussion. The re
sponse of most delegates from
uncommitted countries when
questioned about their attitudes
toward significant issues facing
their nation or the world was
either a dogmatic recital of na
tionalist line or, more often, po
lite evasiveness.
This was to be expected, of
course, because not everyone is
an articulate spokesman and
most people do not wish to offend
anyone, even if he happens to be
an American.
In view of these considerations
I can only be amazed at the opin
ions of the Festival by some
members of the Stanford group.
Moreover, the reports in the San
Francisco Chronicle and other
media regarding “The Stanford
Truth Squad” were ludicrous,
even if the intent was serious.
IT IS my opinion that those
delegates, such as the Ceylonese,
who denounced the Festival and
left had made up their mind to

do so long before their arrival
and in spite of the degree of com
munist control or non-control.
Reports of East German defec
tions were in all probability fab
ricated. The demonstrations
which were made so much of in
the Western press, and which the
communists believed to be Fas
cist inspired, seemed in fact to be
a bunch of kids giving the cops a
rough time.
My feeling is that the Festival
was more or less deliberately
planned as a “fun gathering.” It
was made as non-political as pos
sible in order to minimize the in
evitable impression of strict po
litical control. The real benefit
for the communists comes from
the feeling of solidarity and mu
tual aspirations for peace and
friendship that develops infor
mally from such a gathering and
from the pre- and post-Festival
tours of Eastern Europe.
From the point of view of the
Festival organizer, I suppose it is
necessary to conclude that it was
a success. My own opinion is that
such a gathering should meet the
problems of economic develop
ment and the cold war squarely.
FBO>I this viewpoint the Fes
tival was an absolute failure. In
stead of 62 cultural events and
three political seminars there
should be a full day of seminars
and meetings and only occasional
entertainment. The meetings
should be geared to the major
problems of development and
war and peace and conducted im
partially, with all reasonable
points of view allowed free ex
pression. Such a gathering inevit
ably attracts emotional Hungari
an refugees and staunch Ameri
can anti-communists. Fanatics
whose only purpose is to "show
up” or embarrass a particular
point of view should be handled
with considerably less politeness
than in Helsinki.
In short, what is urgently
needed is a gathering of serious
world youth to discuss in an or
ganized manner, reasonably and
intelligently, the problems the
world presently faces and the is
sues with which they must cope
tomorrow. It seems doubtful that
youth groups on either side of the
barriers erected by the cold war
could organize such a gathering.
AND !SO in all probability noth
ing meaningful can be done to
prevent American youth from
continuing their apathetic sup
port for, or blind allegiance to,
Washington’s latest cold-war in
sanity, as so recently in Cuba,
and Russian youth will go on ra
tionalizing Soviet tests, and so
too will youth from Asia, Africa,
and Latin America continue to
find an outlet for their frustra
tions in blind and petty national
ism; until one day it really will
not matter anymore because
there will not be a world left to
worry about.

seminar, four days with three
events, and only a single day in
which there were as many as four
seminars that could in any sense
be considered political.
ACTUALLY there was only one
clearly political event, besides the
“Free Tribune” which immediate
ly deteriorated to the level of
name calling. That part of the
program was a three-day "Col
loquium on problems of peace
and national independence.” I
went one day to find it over
crowded with East Europeans
and rather dull.
Apparently, a good deal of re
sentment was engendered in
these seminars when the chair
would attempt to put down those
participants bubbling over with
anti-communist invective. Other
topics were typically on the prob
lems of young workers or rural
youth, or such rather uninspiring
themes as ‘The position and role
of girl students in universities
and in the student movement.”
In sharp contrast to this de
emphasis of things directly polit
ical was the nearly overwhelming
variety of amazingly good enter
tainment. An average of over 62
cultural and athletic events were
scheduled daily.
MOST OF the politics of the
Festival, therefore, occurred on
the informal level. However, even
in talking informally with dele
gates from other nations, it was
often difficult to engage in a seri
ous political discussion. The re
sponse of most delegates from
uncommitted countries when
questioned about their attitudes
toward significant issues facing
their nation or the world was
either a dogmatic recital of na
tionalist line or, more often, po
lite evasiveness.
This was to be expected, of
course, because not everyone is
an articulate spokesman and
most people do not wish to offend
anyone, even if he happens to be
an American.
In view of these considerations
I can only be amazed at the opin
ions of the Festival by some
members of the Stanford group.
Moreover, the reports in the San
Francisco Chronicle and other
media regarding “The Stanford
Truth Squad” were ludicrous,
even if the intent was serious.
IT IS my opinion that those
delegates, such as the Ceylonese,
who denounced the Festival and
left had made up their mind to

do so long before their arrival
and in spite of the degree of com
munist control or non-control.
Reports of East German defec
tions were in all probability fab
ricated. The demonstrations
which were made so much of in
the Western press, and which the
communists believed to be Fas
cist inspired, seemed in fact to be
a bunch of kids giving the cops a
rough time.
My feeling is that the Festival
was more or less deliberately
planned as a “fun gathering.” It
was made as non-political as pos
sible in order to minimize the in
evitable impression of strict po
litical control. The real benefit
for the communists comes from
the feeling of solidarity and mu
tual aspirations for peace and
friendship that develops infor
mally from such a gathering and
from the pre- and post-Festival
tours of Eastern Europe.
From the point of view of the
Festival organizer, I suppose it is
necessary to conclude that it was
a success. My own opinion is that
such a gathering should meet the
problems of economic develop
ment and the cold war squarely.
FBO>I this viewpoint the Fes
tival was an absolute failure. In
stead of 62 cultural events and
three political seminars there
should be a full day of seminars
and meetings and only occasional
entertainment. The meetings
should be geared to the major
problems of development and
war and peace and conducted im
partially, with all reasonable
points of view allowed free ex
pression. Such a gathering inevit
ably attracts emotional Hungari
an refugees and staunch Ameri
can anti-communists. Fanatics
whose only purpose is to "show
up” or embarrass a particular
point of view should be handled
with considerably less politeness
than in Helsinki.
In short, what is urgently
needed is a gathering of serious
world youth to discuss in an or
ganized manner, reasonably and
intelligently, the problems the
world presently faces and the is
sues with which they must cope
tomorrow. It seems doubtful that
youth groups on either side of the
barriers erected by the cold war
could organize such a gathering.
AND !SO in all probability noth
ing meaningful can be done to
prevent American youth from
continuing their apathetic sup
port for, or blind allegiance to,
Washington’s latest cold-war in
sanity, as so recently in Cuba,
and Russian youth will go on ra
tionalizing Soviet tests, and so
too will youth from Asia, Africa,
and Latin America continue to
find an outlet for their frustra
tions in blind and petty national
ism; until one day it really will
not matter anymore because
there will not be a world left to
worry about.
As a member of the Stanford
group in Helsinki I have natural

interest The Daily articles by Ron
Bass and Jerry Berg. At the com
pletion of the series I find myself
wondering if we were at the same
Festival, so different are our im
pressions.
Since the general image of the
Festival conveyed by both au

a rigged, carefully controlled,
highly politicized gathering of
world youth (manipulated handi

this central point.

their nation or the world was
either a dogmatic recital of na
tionalist line or, more often, po
lite evasiveness.
This was to be expected, of
course, because not everyone is
an articulate spokesman and
most people do not wish to offend
anyone, even if he happens to be
an American.
In view of these considerations
I can only be amazed at the opin
ions of the Festival by some
members of the Stanford group.
Moreover, the reports in the San
Francisco Chronicle and other
media regarding “The Stanford
Truth Squad” were ludicrous,
even if the intent was serious.
IT IS my opinion that those
delegates, such as the Ceylonese,
who denounced the Festival and
left had made up their mind to

do so long before their arrival
and in spite of the degree of com
munist control or non-control.
Reports of East German defec
tions were in all probability fab
ricated. The demonstrations
which were made so much of in
the Western press, and which the
communists believed to be Fas
cist inspired, seemed in fact to be
a bunch of kids giving the cops a
rough time.
My feeling is that the Festival
was more or less deliberately
planned as a “fun gathering.” It
was made as non-political as pos
sible in order to minimize the in
evitable impression of strict po
litical control. The real benefit
for the communists comes from
the feeling of solidarity and mu
tual aspirations for peace and
friendship that develops infor
mally from such a gathering and
from the pre- and post-Festival
tours of Eastern Europe.
From the point of view of the
Festival organizer, I suppose it is
necessary to conclude that it was
a success. My own opinion is that
such a gathering should meet the
problems of economic develop
ment and the cold war squarely.
FBO>I this viewpoint the Fes
tival was an absolute failure. In
stead of 62 cultural events and
three political seminars there
should be a full day of seminars
and meetings and only occasional
entertainment. The meetings
should be geared to the major
problems of development and
war and peace and conducted im
partially, with all reasonable
points of view allowed free ex
pression. Such a gathering inevit
ably attracts emotional Hungari
an refugees and staunch Ameri
can anti-communists. Fanatics
whose only purpose is to "show
up” or embarrass a particular
point of view should be handled
with considerably less politeness
than in Helsinki.
In short, what is urgently
needed is a gathering of serious
world youth to discuss in an or
ganized manner, reasonably and
intelligently, the problems the
world presently faces and the is
sues with which they must cope
tomorrow. It seems doubtful that
youth groups on either side of the
barriers erected by the cold war
could organize such a gathering.
AND !SO in all probability noth
ing meaningful can be done to
prevent American youth from
continuing their apathetic sup
port for, or blind allegiance to,
Washington’s latest cold-war in
sanity, as so recently in Cuba,
and Russian youth will go on ra
tionalizing Soviet tests, and so
too will youth from Asia, Africa,
and Latin America continue to
find an outlet for their frustra
tions in blind and petty national
ism; until one day it really will
not matter anymore because
there will not be a world left to
worry about.
As a member of the Stanford
group in Helsinki I have natural
ly been following with greatest
interest The Daily articles by Ron
Bass and Jerry Berg. At the com
pletion of the series I find myself
wondering if we were at the same
Festival, so different are our im
pressions.
Since the general image of the
Festival conveyed by both au
thors seems to have been that of
a rigged, carefully controlled,
highly politicized gathering of
world youth (manipulated handi
ly by aged communist profession
als), I wish to direct my own
comments and observations to
this central point.
LIKE Mr. Berg and Mr. Bass, I
went to Helsinki with expecta
tions that the communists were
going to put on a real show, in
the manner described above. Un
like the previous authors, how
ever, I found my expectations
shattered by reality.
The Festival was, in fact, amaz
ingly non-political. A participant
actually had to go considerably
out of the way to become in
volved in real controversy, partic
ularly on the formal level. Con
trary to the notions that Daily
readers must now have, seminars
with political topics were infre
quently scheduled.
For example, in the nine days
of organized activity, there were
three days with no scheduled po
litical events, one day with one
seminar, four days with three
events, and only a single day in
which there were as many as four
seminars that could in any sense
be considered political.
ACTUALLY there was only one
clearly political event, besides the
“Free Tribune” which immediate
ly deteriorated to the level of
name calling. That part of the
program was a three-day "Col
loquium on problems of peace
and national independence.” I
went one day to find it over
crowded with East Europeans
and rather dull.
Apparently, a good deal of re
sentment was engendered in
these seminars when the chair
would attempt to put down those
participants bubbling over with
anti-communist invective. Other
topics were typically on the prob
lems of young workers or rural
youth, or such rather uninspiring
themes as ‘The position and role
of girl students in universities
and in the student movement.”
In sharp contrast to this de
emphasis of things directly polit
ical was the nearly overwhelming
variety of amazingly good enter
tainment. An average of over 62
cultural and athletic events were
scheduled daily.
MOST OF the politics of the
Festival, therefore, occurred on
the informal level. However, even
in talking informally with dele
gates from other nations, it was
often difficult to engage in a seri
ous political discussion. The re
sponse of most delegates from
uncommitted countries when
questioned about their attitudes
toward significant issues facing
their nation or the world was
either a dogmatic recital of na
tionalist line or, more often, po
lite evasiveness.
This was to be expected, of
course, because not everyone is

tual aspirations for peace and
friendship that develops infor
mally from such a gathering and
from the pre- and post-Festival
tours of Eastern Europe.
From the point of view of the
Festival organizer, I suppose it is
necessary to conclude that it was
a success. My own opinion is that
such a gathering should meet the
problems of economic develop
ment and the cold war squarely.
FBO>I this viewpoint the Fes
tival was an absolute failure. In
stead of 62 cultural events and
three political seminars there
should be a full day of seminars
and meetings and only occasional
entertainment. The meetings
should be geared to the major
problems of development and
war and peace and conducted im
partially, with all reasonable
points of view allowed free ex
pression. Such a gathering inevit
ably attracts emotional Hungari
an refugees and staunch Ameri
can anti-communists. Fanatics
whose only purpose is to "show
up” or embarrass a particular
point of view should be handled
with considerably less politeness
than in Helsinki.
In short, what is urgently
needed is a gathering of serious
world youth to discuss in an or
ganized manner, reasonably and
intelligently, the problems the
world presently faces and the is
sues with which they must cope
tomorrow. It seems doubtful that
youth groups on either side of the
barriers erected by the cold war
could organize such a gathering.
AND !SO in all probability noth
ing meaningful can be done to
prevent American youth from
continuing their apathetic sup
port for, or blind allegiance to,
Washington’s latest cold-war in
sanity, as so recently in Cuba,
and Russian youth will go on ra
tionalizing Soviet tests, and so
too will youth from Asia, Africa,
and Latin America continue to
find an outlet for their frustra
tions in blind and petty national
ism; until one day it really will
not matter anymore because
there will not be a world left to
worry about.
As a member of the Stanford
group in Helsinki I have natural
ly been following with greatest
interest The Daily articles by Ron
Bass and Jerry Berg. At the com
pletion of the series I find myself
wondering if we were at the same
Festival, so different are our im
pressions.
Since the general image of the
Festival conveyed by both au
thors seems to have been that of
a rigged, carefully controlled,
highly politicized gathering of
world youth (manipulated handi
ly by aged communist profession
als), I wish to direct my own
comments and observations to
this central point.
LIKE Mr. Berg and Mr. Bass, I
went to Helsinki with expecta
tions that the communists were
going to put on a real show, in
the manner described above. Un
like the previous authors, how
ever, I found my expectations
shattered by reality.
The Festival was, in fact, amaz
ingly non-political. A participant
actually had to go considerably
out of the way to become in
volved in real controversy, partic
ularly on the formal level. Con
trary to the notions that Daily
readers must now have, seminars
with political topics were infre
quently scheduled.
For example, in the nine days
of organized activity, there were
three days with no scheduled po
litical events, one day with one
seminar, four days with three
events, and only a single day in
which there were as many as four
seminars that could in any sense
be considered political.
ACTUALLY there was only one
clearly political event, besides the
“Free Tribune” which immediate
ly deteriorated to the level of
name calling. That part of the
program was a three-day "Col
loquium on problems of peace
and national independence.” I
went one day to find it over
crowded with East Europeans
and rather dull.
Apparently, a good deal of re
sentment was engendered in
these seminars when the chair
would attempt to put down those
participants bubbling over with
anti-communist invective. Other
topics were typically on the prob
lems of young workers or rural
youth, or such rather uninspiring
themes as ‘The position and role
of girl students in universities
and in the student movement.”
In sharp contrast to this de
emphasis of things directly polit
ical was the nearly overwhelming
variety of amazingly good enter
tainment. An average of over 62
cultural and athletic events were
scheduled daily.
MOST OF the politics of the
Festival, therefore, occurred on
the informal level. However, even
in talking informally with dele
gates from other nations, it was
often difficult to engage in a seri
ous political discussion. The re
sponse of most delegates from
uncommitted countries when
questioned about their attitudes
toward significant issues facing
their nation or the world was
either a dogmatic recital of na
tionalist line or, more often, po
lite evasiveness.
This was to be expected, of
course, because not everyone is
an articulate spokesman and
most people do not wish to offend
anyone, even if he happens to be
an American.
In view of these considerations
I can only be amazed at the opin
ions of the Festival by some
members of the Stanford group.
Moreover, the reports in the San
Francisco Chronicle and other
media regarding “The Stanford
Truth Squad” were ludicrous,
even if the intent was serious.
IT IS my opinion that those
delegates, such as the Ceylonese,
who denounced the Festival and
left had made up their mind to

do so long before their arrival
and in spite of the degree of com
munist control or non-control.
Reports of East German defec
tions were in all probability fab
ricated. The demonstrations
which were made so much of in
the Western press, and which the
communists believed to be Fas
cist inspired, seemed in fact to be
a bunch of kids giving the cops a
rough time.
My feeling is that the Festival
was more or less deliberately
planned as a “fun gathering.” It
was made as non-political as pos
sible in order to minimize the in
evitable impression of strict po
litical control. The real benefit
for the communists comes from
the feeling of solidarity and mu
tual aspirations for peace and
friendship that develops infor
mally from such a gathering and
from the pre- and post-Festival
tours of Eastern Europe.
From the point of view of the
Festival organizer, I suppose it is
necessary to conclude that it was
a success. My own opinion is that
such a gathering should meet the
problems of economic develop
ment and the cold war squarely.
