# Letter Rules
## 
### 
Letters to the Editor must
be brought to the Daily Shack
in person, and the signature
on the letter must be checked
with the student body card of
the student submitting the
letter. The validity of letters
from other sources will also
be confirmed when the letters
are presented.
letters exceeding 200 words
are subject to editing to re
duce them to that length. The
shorter the letter, the more
likely it will be printed, let
ters must be typed.
