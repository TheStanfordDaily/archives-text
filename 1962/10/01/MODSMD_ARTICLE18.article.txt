# RECORD REVIEW
## New Baez LP Shows 'Soul' Drama, Insight 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
It is difficult to find standards
of reference to judge the new
Baez recording, “Joan Baez in
Concert” iVRS-0112).
Certainly Joan Baez needs ca
pable critics. She has been soci
ologically lucky. In three years
she has risen to the top of folk
music along a royal road that
took Pete Seeger and others thir
ty years to hack out of a jungle
of popular indifference. She will
not mature without intelligent
and sensitive criticism from her
concert and record audiences
And it is easy to praise Joan
Baez for the Wrong reasons. But
it Is just as easy to miss her real
significance.
“JOAN BAEZ in Concert” is
something of an experiment, dif
ficult to fit into the framework
of the first two Vanguard al
bums. With its applause, com
ments, and various animal and
mechanical noises, it lacks some
of the spare, almost supernatural
dignity of the earlier records.
And the new recording bears only
three of the traditional Child’s
ballads which are Miss Baez's
particular forte “Geordie,”
“House Carpenter,” and “Matty
Groves.” The other songs are an
eclectic assortment ranging from
the Carter Family’s “Gospel
Ship” to Woody Guthrie’s “Pretty
Boy Floyd” to a contemporary
Gold Coast song, “Danger
Waters.” As a whole the new al
bum seems a bold venture into
new material, the results of
which will have to be evaluated
when Vanguard releases the com
panion recording which it has
promised.
The limited range of her voice
is open to question. If we may
accept the word of "The Report
er” (Jan. 4, 1962), “she can soar
through three octaves with an
even range from top to bottom.”
This would seem to be operatic
competence. Her voice does how
ever exhibit a regrettable tend
ency to become background mu
sic; one can listen to her records
twenty or thirty times without
ever really hearing the words.
But this may be a hint of the
wordless communication, of tem
perament to like temperament,
for which the romantics and mys
tics have searched for centuries.
Likewise her highly emotional
presentation always carries un
dertones of hysteria, which touch
the surface in “Ate Amanha.”
But this is an integral part of
her appeal to this decade of “ab
surd sensibility.” Her style seems
to be a fusion of ethnic folk pre
sentation with the orgiastic rem
nants of the rock-and-roll singing
in which she began her career,
the latter being evident in her
frequent concert parody of “My
Little Darlin’.”
IF THERE is anything Joan
Baez does have, it is soul, drama,
and a sort of poetic insight. Out
of the many thousand variants of
traditional English ballads, she
has chosen her versions with such
discrimination and sung them
with such power that one might
think she had composed them
herself. She has brought to folk
song a new depth, a variety of
the tragic sense of life, so rare
in this country. The double
strands of love and death are
painstakingly entwined through
out her best songs.
Inasmuch as folk song today
seems to he fulfilling for Ameri
ca somewhat the same creative
function as did the National The
ater for the Ireland of the '2o’s,
we may see Joan Baez as Ameri
ca’s equivalent of William Butler
Yeats. Certainly she is one of the
last remnants of nineteenth-cen
tury romanticism in our comfort
able technic era.

Yeats. Certainly she is one of the
last remnants of nineteenth-cen
tury romanticism in our comfort
able technic era.
It is difficult to find standards
of reference to judge the new
Baez recording, “Joan Baez in
Concert” iVRS-0112).
Certainly Joan Baez needs ca
pable critics. She has been soci
ologically lucky. In three years
she has risen to the top of folk
music along a royal road that
took Pete Seeger and others thir
ty years to hack out of a jungle
of popular indifference. She will
not mature without intelligent
and sensitive criticism from her
concert and record audiences
And it is easy to praise Joan
Baez for the Wrong reasons. But
it Is just as easy to miss her real
significance.
“JOAN BAEZ in Concert” is
something of an experiment, dif
ficult to fit into the framework
of the first two Vanguard al
bums. With its applause, com
ments, and various animal and
mechanical noises, it lacks some
of the spare, almost supernatural
dignity of the earlier records.
And the new recording bears only
three of the traditional Child’s
ballads which are Miss Baez's
particular forte “Geordie,”
“House Carpenter,” and “Matty
Groves.” The other songs are an
eclectic assortment ranging from
the Carter Family’s “Gospel
Ship” to Woody Guthrie’s “Pretty
Boy Floyd” to a contemporary
Gold Coast song, “Danger
Waters.” As a whole the new al
bum seems a bold venture into
new material, the results of
which will have to be evaluated
when Vanguard releases the com
panion recording which it has
promised.
The limited range of her voice
is open to question. If we may
accept the word of "The Report
er” (Jan. 4, 1962), “she can soar
through three octaves with an
even range from top to bottom.”
This would seem to be operatic
competence. Her voice does how
ever exhibit a regrettable tend
ency to become background mu
sic; one can listen to her records
twenty or thirty times without
ever really hearing the words.
But this may be a hint of the
wordless communication, of tem
perament to like temperament,
for which the romantics and mys
tics have searched for centuries.
Likewise her highly emotional
presentation always carries un
dertones of hysteria, which touch
the surface in “Ate Amanha.”
But this is an integral part of
her appeal to this decade of “ab
surd sensibility.” Her style seems
to be a fusion of ethnic folk pre
sentation with the orgiastic rem
nants of the rock-and-roll singing
in which she began her career,
the latter being evident in her
frequent concert parody of “My
Little Darlin’.”
IF THERE is anything Joan
Baez does have, it is soul, drama,
and a sort of poetic insight. Out
of the many thousand variants of
traditional English ballads, she
has chosen her versions with such
discrimination and sung them
with such power that one might
think she had composed them
herself. She has brought to folk
song a new depth, a variety of
the tragic sense of life, so rare
in this country. The double
strands of love and death are
painstakingly entwined through
out her best songs.
Inasmuch as folk song today
seems to he fulfilling for Ameri
ca somewhat the same creative
function as did the National The
ater for the Ireland of the '2o’s,
we may see Joan Baez as Ameri
ca’s equivalent of William Butler
Yeats. Certainly she is one of the
