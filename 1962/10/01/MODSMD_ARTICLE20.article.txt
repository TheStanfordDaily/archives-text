# Let's Revive a Dying SU Tradition
## 
### WILLIAM REPPY Associate Editor 
One of Stanford’s oldest traditions—perhaps the oldest since it
dates from the first week of classes here in 1891—is dying. This is
the tradition that no one, neither faculty member nor students, shall
smoke on inner Quad. For more than 50 years this tradition was

religiously followed. Smoking on
Inner Quad was mortal sin. But
stand on Inner Quad today and
just watch the Damned parade
by. Anybody smokes on Inner
Quad today. The tradition is for
gotten.
“Good riddance” say many stu
dents who think the tradition just
silly old prejudice. “A ridiculous
idea” they tell me when I suggest
reviving it. “Reactionary” I am
branded.
I DON’T expect all smoking on
Inner Quad to miraculously cease
in toto the day after this article
appears. But many undergradu
ates who aren’t even aware of
this ancient taboo should at least
learn of the formerly sacred rule.
Perhaps next time they’re drag
ging on their butts on the holy
grounds of Inner Quad they will
feel a little guilty.
The autobiography of David
Starr Jordan, our first president,
recounts how the tradition start
ed in October, 1891.
“Before the first week had
passed,” he recalls in “The Days
of a Man,” “The ‘Student Body,’
already organized, passed a reso
lution that there should be no
smoking in the Quadrangle (for
which we all felt a kind of rever
ence . . .) The tradition then es
tablished has ever since been re
spected by both students and fac
ulty.”

Ray Lyman Wilbur, our third
president, told in a 1944 speech
on Stanford traditions that it was
Mrs. Leland Stanford’s personal
wish expressed to Dr. Jordan that
started it all.
MISS OWEN of the President’s
office says the tradition was kept
by all men at Stanford when she
was a student here in 1918-20. It
didn’t concern women then, she
adds, for they had not yet taken
up smoking, at least not in pub
lic.

Dr. Bacon of the mathematics
department was a student here
from 1925 to 1933. During these
years, he says, “Mrs. Stanford’s
request was religiously ob
served.”

This was the case up to World
War 11. Men on the campus then
were mostly servicemen, many
of whom were special trainees
who didn’t feel a part of the Stan
ford family. To them the old tra
dition had little meaning. Smok
ing appeared on Quad.
By 1944 the tradition was dis
regarded by many, prompting Dr.
Wilbur to observe: “There is a
tendency for this tradition to go
up in smoke.”
IN 1946 this letter by a student
appeared in The Daily;
“There is no longer a tradition
of no smoking on Quad! Every
body does. People used to come
from far and near to behold the
13th marvel of the world, the
modern generation upholding an
ancient tradition at Stanford.
But now it is gone.
“We have no pride, we don’t
care, we have no consciences, we
smoke on Quad.”
The sacred old tradition re
ceived a slap in the face in 1948
when Stanford’s superintendent
of buildings and grounds took a
look at the “butt-littered” Quad
and ordered fifty sections of pipe
filled with sand for students to
dunk their butts in, placed around
the square. Tangible proof that

disregard for the tradition was
rampant.
The Stanford Alumni Review
sorrowfully reported the installa
tion of ashtrays and The Daily
attacked the ashtrays editorially
but also wondered “if a tradition
that needs active enforcement is
worth keeping.”
DEAN LARIMER, as tudent
here from 1946 to 1953, says the
tradition was known and general
ly observed. “But observance is
much worse now,” he says.
Apparently the tradition experi
enced some sort of Renaissance,
for when I came here as a fresh
man, we were all duly informed
of the taboo and almost always
obeyed it. Smouldering tobacco
was anathema to Quad. Once I
forgot the tradition and stepped
onto the holy ground with a burn
ing butt. At once I was firmly
reminded by an elderly gentle
man of my obligation as a mem
ber of the Stanford family.
But this respect for tradition
didn’t last. If the same old fel
low were to accost students
smoking on Quad today he would
most certainly be considered in
sane and probably the men in
white coats would be dispatched
to carry him away.
The tradition certainly seems
near death now. Maybe it’s al
ready dead and this flutter of in
terest is only a bit of rigor mor
tis.
WHY SHOULD anyone want to
revive it? As The Daily asked in
1948, is a tradition that needs ac
tive enforcement worth keeping?
Is a tradition worth keeping just

because it is a tradition?
At the risk of being branded
reactionary, a Bircher, and a
stoolie for the administration, I
say yes. It doesn’t seem stupid to
me to continue to honor the wish
of one of the founders of our
school, albeit she has lain in the
Mausoleum for decades.
Having traditions respected by
all enriches a University. And
you’ll have to admit that Stan
ford isn’t rolling in them. Men.
when was the last time you sent
a rose to your girl for every late
minute chalked up against her
after the two of you managed to
loose track of time in the cactus
gardens?
Hasn’t water-balloon heaving
corrupted the ancient ritual of
making a Stanford girl a Stan

ford woman?
SHALL WE let still another
fable of the Farm go the way of
all flesh?
If we want to halt the massacre
of Stanford traditions what can
we do about it? Obviously we
dare not actually stop and ver
bally remind the violators like
that old gentleman did way back
in 1959. The ridicule that Stan
ford’s liberal faction would
shower upon us would be too
much to bear.
Onp thing we can do is to stop
smoking on Quad ourselves. And

perhaps on occasions we can di
rect a dirty look at violators of
the tradition, thereby instilling
shame in their souls, if they are
possessed of the same.
At least we can teach this bit
of Farm lore to young freshmen,
whose uncluttered minds are sus
ceptible to suggestions from their
elders. We can hope that fresh
man classes in future years will
be so instructed and that some
day the rebirth of tradition will
occur and be relieved that Jane
Lathrop Stanford rests easier in
her tomb.

low were to accost students
smoking on Quad today he would
most certainly be considered in
sane and probably the men in
white coats would be dispatched
to carry him away.
The tradition certainly seems
near death now. Maybe it’s al
ready dead and this flutter of in
terest is only a bit of rigor mor
tis.
WHY SHOULD anyone want to
revive it? As The Daily asked in
1948, is a tradition that needs ac
tive enforcement worth keeping?
Is a tradition worth keeping just

because it is a tradition?
At the risk of being branded
reactionary, a Bircher, and a
stoolie for the administration, I
say yes. It doesn’t seem stupid to
me to continue to honor the wish
of one of the founders of our
school, albeit she has lain in the
Mausoleum for decades.
Having traditions respected by
all enriches a University. And
you’ll have to admit that Stan
ford isn’t rolling in them. Men.
when was the last time you sent
a rose to your girl for every late
minute chalked up against her
after the two of you managed to
loose track of time in the cactus
gardens?
Hasn’t water-balloon heaving
corrupted the ancient ritual of
making a Stanford girl a Stan

ford woman?
SHALL WE let still another
fable of the Farm go the way of
all flesh?
If we want to halt the massacre
of Stanford traditions what can
we do about it? Obviously we
dare not actually stop and ver
bally remind the violators like
that old gentleman did way back
in 1959. The ridicule that Stan
ford’s liberal faction would
shower upon us would be too
much to bear.
Onp thing we can do is to stop
smoking on Quad ourselves. And

perhaps on occasions we can di
rect a dirty look at violators of
the tradition, thereby instilling
shame in their souls, if they are
possessed of the same.
At least we can teach this bit
of Farm lore to young freshmen,
whose uncluttered minds are sus
ceptible to suggestions from their
elders. We can hope that fresh
man classes in future years will
be so instructed and that some
day the rebirth of tradition will
occur and be relieved that Jane
Lathrop Stanford rests easier in
her tomb.


MRS. LELAND STANFORD
She started it all
One of Stanford’s oldest traditions—perhaps the oldest since it
dates from the first week of classes here in 1891—is dying. This is
the tradition that no one, neither faculty member nor students, shall
smoke on inner Quad. For more than 50 years this tradition was

religiously followed. Smoking on
Inner Quad was mortal sin. But
stand on Inner Quad today and
just watch the Damned parade
by. Anybody smokes on Inner
Quad today. The tradition is for
gotten.
“Good riddance” say many stu
dents who think the tradition just
silly old prejudice. “A ridiculous
idea” they tell me when I suggest
reviving it. “Reactionary” I am
branded.
I DON’T expect all smoking on
Inner Quad to miraculously cease
in toto the day after this article
appears. But many undergradu
ates who aren’t even aware of
this ancient taboo should at least
learn of the formerly sacred rule.
Perhaps next time they’re drag
ging on their butts on the holy
grounds of Inner Quad they will
feel a little guilty.
The autobiography of David
Starr Jordan, our first president,
recounts how the tradition start
ed in October, 1891.
“Before the first week had
passed,” he recalls in “The Days
of a Man,” “The ‘Student Body,’
already organized, passed a reso
lution that there should be no
smoking in the Quadrangle (for
which we all felt a kind of rever
ence . . .) The tradition then es
tablished has ever since been re
spected by both students and fac
ulty.”

Ray Lyman Wilbur, our third
president, told in a 1944 speech
on Stanford traditions that it was
Mrs. Leland Stanford’s personal
wish expressed to Dr. Jordan that
started it all.
MISS OWEN of the President’s
office says the tradition was kept
by all men at Stanford when she
was a student here in 1918-20. It
didn’t concern women then, she
adds, for they had not yet taken
up smoking, at least not in pub
lic.

Dr. Bacon of the mathematics
department was a student here
from 1925 to 1933. During these
years, he says, “Mrs. Stanford’s
request was religiously ob
served.”

This was the case up to World
War 11. Men on the campus then
were mostly servicemen, many
of whom were special trainees
who didn’t feel a part of the Stan
ford family. To them the old tra
dition had little meaning. Smok
ing appeared on Quad.
By 1944 the tradition was dis
regarded by many, prompting Dr.
Wilbur to observe: “There is a
tendency for this tradition to go
up in smoke.”
IN 1946 this letter by a student
appeared in The Daily;
“There is no longer a tradition
of no smoking on Quad! Every
body does. People used to come
from far and near to behold the
13th marvel of the world, the
modern generation upholding an
ancient tradition at Stanford.
But now it is gone.
“We have no pride, we don’t
care, we have no consciences, we
smoke on Quad.”
The sacred old tradition re
ceived a slap in the face in 1948
when Stanford’s superintendent
of buildings and grounds took a
look at the “butt-littered” Quad
and ordered fifty sections of pipe
filled with sand for students to
dunk their butts in, placed around
the square. Tangible proof that

disregard for the tradition was
rampant.
The Stanford Alumni Review
sorrowfully reported the installa
tion of ashtrays and The Daily
attacked the ashtrays editorially
but also wondered “if a tradition
that needs active enforcement is
worth keeping.”
DEAN LARIMER, as tudent
here from 1946 to 1953, says the
tradition was known and general
ly observed. “But observance is
much worse now,” he says.
Apparently the tradition experi
enced some sort of Renaissance,
for when I came here as a fresh
man, we were all duly informed
of the taboo and almost always
obeyed it. Smouldering tobacco
was anathema to Quad. Once I
forgot the tradition and stepped
onto the holy ground with a burn
ing butt. At once I was firmly
reminded by an elderly gentle
man of my obligation as a mem
ber of the Stanford family.
But this respect for tradition
didn’t last. If the same old fel
low were to accost students

most certainly be considered in

from 1925 to 1933. During these
years, he says, “Mrs. Stanford’s
request was religiously ob
served.”

This was the case up to World
War 11. Men on the campus then
were mostly servicemen, many
of whom were special trainees
who didn’t feel a part of the Stan
ford family. To them the old tra
dition had little meaning. Smok
ing appeared on Quad.
By 1944 the tradition was dis
regarded by many, prompting Dr.
Wilbur to observe: “There is a
tendency for this tradition to go
up in smoke.”
IN 1946 this letter by a student
appeared in The Daily;
“There is no longer a tradition
of no smoking on Quad! Every
body does. People used to come
from far and near to behold the
13th marvel of the world, the
modern generation upholding an
ancient tradition at Stanford.
But now it is gone.
“We have no pride, we don’t
care, we have no consciences, we
smoke on Quad.”
The sacred old tradition re
ceived a slap in the face in 1948
when Stanford’s superintendent
of buildings and grounds took a
look at the “butt-littered” Quad
and ordered fifty sections of pipe
filled with sand for students to
dunk their butts in, placed around
the square. Tangible proof that

disregard for the tradition was
rampant.
The Stanford Alumni Review
sorrowfully reported the installa
tion of ashtrays and The Daily
attacked the ashtrays editorially
but also wondered “if a tradition
that needs active enforcement is
worth keeping.”
DEAN LARIMER, as tudent
here from 1946 to 1953, says the
tradition was known and general
ly observed. “But observance is
much worse now,” he says.
Apparently the tradition experi
enced some sort of Renaissance,
for when I came here as a fresh
man, we were all duly informed
of the taboo and almost always
obeyed it. Smouldering tobacco
was anathema to Quad. Once I
forgot the tradition and stepped
onto the holy ground with a burn
ing butt. At once I was firmly
reminded by an elderly gentle
man of my obligation as a mem
ber of the Stanford family.
But this respect for tradition
didn’t last. If the same old fel
low were to accost students
smoking on Quad today he would
most certainly be considered in
sane and probably the men in
white coats would be dispatched
to carry him away.
The tradition certainly seems
near death now. Maybe it’s al
ready dead and this flutter of in
terest is only a bit of rigor mor
tis.
WHY SHOULD anyone want to
revive it? As The Daily asked in
1948, is a tradition that needs ac
tive enforcement worth keeping?
Is a tradition worth keeping just

because it is a tradition?
At the risk of being branded
reactionary, a Bircher, and a
stoolie for the administration, I
say yes. It doesn’t seem stupid to
me to continue to honor the wish
of one of the founders of our
school, albeit she has lain in the
Mausoleum for decades.
Having traditions respected by
all enriches a University. And
you’ll have to admit that Stan
ford isn’t rolling in them. Men.
when was the last time you sent
a rose to your girl for every late
minute chalked up against her
after the two of you managed to
loose track of time in the cactus
gardens?
Hasn’t water-balloon heaving
corrupted the ancient ritual of
making a Stanford girl a Stan

ford woman?
SHALL WE let still another
fable of the Farm go the way of
all flesh?
If we want to halt the massacre
of Stanford traditions what can
we do about it? Obviously we
dare not actually stop and ver
bally remind the violators like
that old gentleman did way back
in 1959. The ridicule that Stan
ford’s liberal faction would
shower upon us would be too
much to bear.
Onp thing we can do is to stop
smoking on Quad ourselves. And

perhaps on occasions we can di
rect a dirty look at violators of
the tradition, thereby instilling
shame in their souls, if they are
possessed of the same.
At least we can teach this bit
of Farm lore to young freshmen,
whose uncluttered minds are sus
ceptible to suggestions from their
elders. We can hope that fresh
man classes in future years will
be so instructed and that some
day the rebirth of tradition will
occur and be relieved that Jane
Lathrop Stanford rests easier in
her tomb.


MRS. LELAND STANFORD
She started it all
One of Stanford’s oldest traditions—perhaps the oldest since it
dates from the first week of classes here in 1891—is dying. This is
the tradition that no one, neither faculty member nor students, shall
smoke on inner Quad. For more than 50 years this tradition was

religiously followed. Smoking on
Inner Quad was mortal sin. But
stand on Inner Quad today and
just watch the Damned parade
by. Anybody smokes on Inner
Quad today. The tradition is for
gotten.
“Good riddance” say many stu
dents who think the tradition just
silly old prejudice. “A ridiculous
idea” they tell me when I suggest
reviving it. “Reactionary” I am
branded.
I DON’T expect all smoking on
Inner Quad to miraculously cease
in toto the day after this article
appears. But many undergradu
ates who aren’t even aware of
this ancient taboo should at least
learn of the formerly sacred rule.
Perhaps next time they’re drag
ging on their butts on the holy
grounds of Inner Quad they will
feel a little guilty.
The autobiography of David
Starr Jordan, our first president,
recounts how the tradition start
ed in October, 1891.
“Before the first week had
passed,” he recalls in “The Days
of a Man,” “The ‘Student Body,’
already organized, passed a reso
lution that there should be no
smoking in the Quadrangle (for
which we all felt a kind of rever
ence . . .) The tradition then es
tablished has ever since been re
spected by both students and fac
ulty.”

Ray Lyman Wilbur, our third
president, told in a 1944 speech
on Stanford traditions that it was
Mrs. Leland Stanford’s personal
wish expressed to Dr. Jordan that
started it all.
MISS OWEN of the President’s
office says the tradition was kept
by all men at Stanford when she
was a student here in 1918-20. It
didn’t concern women then, she
adds, for they had not yet taken
up smoking, at least not in pub
lic.

be so instructed and that some

her tomb.


MRS. LELAND STANFORD
She started it all
One of Stanford’s oldest traditions—perhaps the oldest since it
dates from the first week of classes here in 1891—is dying. This is
the tradition that no one, neither faculty member nor students, shall
smoke on inner Quad. For more than 50 years this tradition was

religiously followed. Smoking on
Inner Quad was mortal sin. But
stand on Inner Quad today and
just watch the Damned parade
by. Anybody smokes on Inner
Quad today. The tradition is for
gotten.
“Good riddance” say many stu
dents who think the tradition just
silly old prejudice. “A ridiculous
idea” they tell me when I suggest
reviving it. “Reactionary” I am
branded.
I DON’T expect all smoking on
Inner Quad to miraculously cease
in toto the day after this article
appears. But many undergradu
ates who aren’t even aware of
this ancient taboo should at least
learn of the formerly sacred rule.
Perhaps next time they’re drag
ging on their butts on the holy
grounds of Inner Quad they will
feel a little guilty.
The autobiography of David
Starr Jordan, our first president,
recounts how the tradition start
ed in October, 1891.
“Before the first week had
passed,” he recalls in “The Days
of a Man,” “The ‘Student Body,’
already organized, passed a reso
lution that there should be no
smoking in the Quadrangle (for
which we all felt a kind of rever
ence . . .) The tradition then es
tablished has ever since been re
spected by both students and fac
ulty.”

Ray Lyman Wilbur, our third
president, told in a 1944 speech
on Stanford traditions that it was
Mrs. Leland Stanford’s personal
wish expressed to Dr. Jordan that
started it all.
MISS OWEN of the President’s
office says the tradition was kept
by all men at Stanford when she
was a student here in 1918-20. It
didn’t concern women then, she
adds, for they had not yet taken
up smoking, at least not in pub
lic.

Dr. Bacon of the mathematics
department was a student here
from 1925 to 1933. During these
years, he says, “Mrs. Stanford’s
request was religiously ob
served.”

This was the case up to World
War 11. Men on the campus then
were mostly servicemen, many
of whom were special trainees
who didn’t feel a part of the Stan
ford family. To them the old tra
dition had little meaning. Smok
ing appeared on Quad.
By 1944 the tradition was dis
regarded by many, prompting Dr.
Wilbur to observe: “There is a
tendency for this tradition to go
up in smoke.”
IN 1946 this letter by a student
appeared in The Daily;
“There is no longer a tradition
of no smoking on Quad! Every
body does. People used to come
from far and near to behold the
13th marvel of the world, the
modern generation upholding an
ancient tradition at Stanford.
But now it is gone.
“We have no pride, we don’t
care, we have no consciences, we
smoke on Quad.”
The sacred old tradition re
ceived a slap in the face in 1948
when Stanford’s superintendent
of buildings and grounds took a
look at the “butt-littered” Quad
and ordered fifty sections of pipe
filled with sand for students to
dunk their butts in, placed around
the square. Tangible proof that

disregard for the tradition was
rampant.
The Stanford Alumni Review
sorrowfully reported the installa
tion of ashtrays and The Daily
attacked the ashtrays editorially
but also wondered “if a tradition
that needs active enforcement is
worth keeping.”
DEAN LARIMER, as tudent
here from 1946 to 1953, says the
tradition was known and general
ly observed. “But observance is
much worse now,” he says.
Apparently the tradition experi
enced some sort of Renaissance,
for when I came here as a fresh
man, we were all duly informed
of the taboo and almost always
obeyed it. Smouldering tobacco
was anathema to Quad. Once I
forgot the tradition and stepped
onto the holy ground with a burn
ing butt. At once I was firmly
reminded by an elderly gentle
man of my obligation as a mem
ber of the Stanford family.
But this respect for tradition
didn’t last. If the same old fel
low were to accost students
smoking on Quad today he would
most certainly be considered in
sane and probably the men in
white coats would be dispatched
to carry him away.
The tradition certainly seems
near death now. Maybe it’s al
ready dead and this flutter of in
terest is only a bit of rigor mor
tis.
WHY SHOULD anyone want to
revive it? As The Daily asked in
1948, is a tradition that needs ac
tive enforcement worth keeping?
Is a tradition worth keeping just

because it is a tradition?
At the risk of being branded
reactionary, a Bircher, and a
stoolie for the administration, I
say yes. It doesn’t seem stupid to
me to continue to honor the wish
of one of the founders of our
school, albeit she has lain in the
Mausoleum for decades.
Having traditions respected by
all enriches a University. And
you’ll have to admit that Stan
ford isn’t rolling in them. Men.
when was the last time you sent
a rose to your girl for every late
minute chalked up against her
after the two of you managed to
loose track of time in the cactus
gardens?
Hasn’t water-balloon heaving
corrupted the ancient ritual of
making a Stanford girl a Stan

ford woman?
SHALL WE let still another
fable of the Farm go the way of
all flesh?
If we want to halt the massacre
of Stanford traditions what can
we do about it? Obviously we
dare not actually stop and ver
bally remind the violators like
that old gentleman did way back
in 1959. The ridicule that Stan
ford’s liberal faction would
shower upon us would be too
much to bear.
Onp thing we can do is to stop
smoking on Quad ourselves. And

perhaps on occasions we can di
rect a dirty look at violators of
the tradition, thereby instilling
shame in their souls, if they are
possessed of the same.
At least we can teach this bit
of Farm lore to young freshmen,
whose uncluttered minds are sus
ceptible to suggestions from their
elders. We can hope that fresh
man classes in future years will
be so instructed and that some
day the rebirth of tradition will
occur and be relieved that Jane
Lathrop Stanford rests easier in
