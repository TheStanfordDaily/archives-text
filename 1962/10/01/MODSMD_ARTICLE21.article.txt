## Scoring Meager As Giants Tie Dodgers 
### 
From DPI Stories
SAN FRANCISCO—The San
Francisco Giants whooped it up
yesterday for a put-out they
didn’t even see.
The Giants let out a huge roar
and started pounding each other
on the backs when an announcer’s
voice came out of the radio say
ing, “Jim Gilliam has popped up
to Julian Javier and the ball game
is over.”

If the announcer, who was re
creating the game between the
Los Angeles Dodgers and the St.
Louis Cardinals, had anything
else to say it was not audible in
the dressing room of the Giants.
Gilliam’s pop-up meant that St.
Louis had .just beaten the Dodg
ers, 1-0, and the Giants, who
downed Houston, 2-1, some 25
minutes earlier, were tied with
Los Angeles for the National
League pennant and will begin a
pennant playoff today in Candle
stick Park at 1 p.m. The second
and third games will be in Los
Angeles tomorrow, and Wednes
day if necessary.
Cardinal Gene Oliver’s home
run was the winning hit against
L.A. The 27-year-old catcher hit
a 1-2 pitch by southpaw Johnny
Podres into the seats adjoining
the Dodger bullpen. It came as
the third hit off Podres and was
Oliver’s Idth homer of the sea
son.
Podres and lefty Curt Simmons
fought it out in a clutch mound
battle all the way aside from the
game-deciding homer. Until Oli
ver homered in the eighth with
one man away, only two batters
had gotten on base for the Car
dinals and neither went past first
base.
Simmons gave up only five hits
too, but the Dodgers got a man
as far as second base twice.
In their apparent anxiety to put
men in scoring position, the Dodg
ers made three mental miscues in
the errorless game.
In the first inning Lee Walls
hit a short Texas League single
behind second base then was out
trying to stretch it to a double.
In the next inning Willie Davis
who also led off with a single
was doubled off first base when
Podres fouled out, and in the
seventh, Tommy Davis who again

led off with a single was caught
in a rundown between first and
second.
A crowd of 42,325 witnessed
the final regular season game in
Dodger Stadium and raised the
Dodgers’ home attendance to a
major league record total of 2,-
684,170. The Dodgers had broken
the major league record the pre
vious night and increased their
new mark with Sunday’s attend
ance.
The Dodgers were assured of a
tie Saturday when the Houston
Colts beat the Giants, 4-2. in the
second game of a doubleheader
but could not capitalize on the
assist.
Meanwhile up north, Willie
Mays, breaking out of a miserable
slump, crashed a home run that
gave the Giants a 2-1 Victory over
Houston.
It was Mays’ 47th homer of the
season and came at the expense
of flreballer Dick Farrell with
the score tied, 1-1.
Willie, who had collected one
hit in his last 16 official trips, led
off the eighth inning and after
fouling off the first pitch, hit a
shot into the leftfield seats, some
380 feet away.
Home runs accounted for all of
the Giants’ scoring. Big Ed Bai
ley, sometimes called a forgotten
man in Manager Alvin Dark’s
scheme of things, gave the Giants
a 1-0 lead in the fourth inning by
crashing his 17th homer over the
right centerfield fence about 425
feet away.
The Giants’ win and the Dodg
ers’ loss left the two teams tied
with 101 vicorites and 61 defeats
each.

To d a y’s Giants-Dodgers

on KTVU, Channel 2, begin
ning at 12:45 p.m. KSFO will
