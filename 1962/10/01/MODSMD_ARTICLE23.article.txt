# West Coast Football Shines As Five AAWU Teams Triumph
## 
### 
Stanford’s upset of Michigan
State is, of course, 1 he big news of
West Coast football this week, in
deed of the nation’s football. How
ever, the other AAWU teams
faired as well, except UCLA who
didn’t play; all won by formidable
scores.
Marv Levy’s not so Golden Bears
won their first game since upset
ting Washington last October. Cal
scored early when Randy Gold
completed a three-yard pass to
end Bill Turner. UC was supposed
to be woefully weak on defense,
but it collected two points on a
safety in the first period. A field
goal by sophomore Tom Blanch
field made it 12-0 by halftime.
In the third quarter, Turner
caught another touchdown pass,
this time from Captain Larry Bail
let. Thus, the Bears led 18-0 going
into the final period, which saw
the two teams trade touchdowns.
Hugh Campbell was again the
whole story as Washington State
stopped Wyoming 21-15. The mar
velous end grabbed 7 passes for
110 yards and 2 touchdowns, there
by increasing his three year mark
to 1789 yards gainer, a new NCAA
record. He also tied the total re
ceptions record of 131. By next
Saturday evening Campbell will
be, by record books at least, the
greatest pass-catcher in the his
tory of the NCAA.
Washington with its eye on still
another Rose Bowl bid, swamped
Illinois, one of the very few weak
teams in the big Ten, by a score of

28-7. The Huskies scored in every
period with their outstanding hall
back Charlie Mitchell drawing
first blood. The lllini, who did not
win a game last year, were held
in check most of the way by
Washington’s highly touted de
fense.
Fabulous Willy Wood gave USC
tremendous impetus by grabbing
the opening kick-off and scamper
ing 92 yards for a quick score. In
the second half the passing com
bination of Bill Nelson and Hal
Bedsole proved too much for SMU,
as these two combined on two long
touchdown passes. USC is pur
ported to have the best offense on
the coast which features a one-two
punch of Quarterback Pete Beat
ard and Fullback Ben Wilson, as
well as Bedsole and the fleet Wood,
who is possibly the most danger
ous runner on the Coast.

end Bill Turner. UC was supposed
to be woefully weak on defense,
but it collected two points on a
safety in the first period. A field
goal by sophomore Tom Blanch
field made it 12-0 by halftime.
In the third quarter, Turner
caught another touchdown pass,
this time from Captain Larry Bail
let. Thus, the Bears led 18-0 going
into the final period, which saw
the two teams trade touchdowns.
Hugh Campbell was again the
whole story as Washington State
stopped Wyoming 21-15. The mar
velous end grabbed 7 passes for
110 yards and 2 touchdowns, there
by increasing his three year mark
to 1789 yards gainer, a new NCAA
record. He also tied the total re
ceptions record of 131. By next
Saturday evening Campbell will
be, by record books at least, the
greatest pass-catcher in the his
tory of the NCAA.
Washington with its eye on still
another Rose Bowl bid, swamped
Illinois, one of the very few weak
teams in the big Ten, by a score of

28-7. The Huskies scored in every
period with their outstanding hall
back Charlie Mitchell drawing
first blood. The lllini, who did not
win a game last year, were held
in check most of the way by
Washington’s highly touted de
fense.
Fabulous Willy Wood gave USC
tremendous impetus by grabbing
the opening kick-off and scamper
ing 92 yards for a quick score. In
the second half the passing com
bination of Bill Nelson and Hal
Bedsole proved too much for SMU,
as these two combined on two long
touchdown passes. USC is pur
ported to have the best offense on
the coast which features a one-two
punch of Quarterback Pete Beat
ard and Fullback Ben Wilson, as
well as Bedsole and the fleet Wood,
who is possibly the most danger
ous runner on the Coast.
Stanford’s upset of Michigan
State is, of course, 1 he big news of
West Coast football this week, in
deed of the nation’s football. How
ever, the other AAWU teams
faired as well, except UCLA who
didn’t play; all won by formidable
scores.
Marv Levy’s not so Golden Bears
won their first game since upset

scored early when Randy Gold
completed a three-yard pass to
end Bill Turner. UC was supposed
