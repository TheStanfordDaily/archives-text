‘ You deserved to win,” Duffy
Daugherty said to Jack Curtice
as the two coaches met on the field
after Stanford had upset Michigan
State, 1(3-13.
It was a case of an unheralded
West Coast team coming off four
consecutive losing seasons and lie- i
ing psychologically primed for one
of the nation’s five top ranked
teams, and heating the daylight
out of it. MSU had come to Cali
fornia fora pleasant road trip and
a football game, expecting to win
easily against a team it had bru-

I tally beaten three straight times.
Indian center C. B. Simons, who
had continually opened up running
room throughout the game against
an All-American center who out
weighed him by 30 pounds,
summed up the situation best
when he said: "They didn’t believe
we had the horses, but we did.”
Curtice refused to take credit
for boosting the team’s spirit in
I preparation for the game. ‘‘Your
opposition gets your boys up or
down," he said.
Curtice was most thrilled by the
unity and spirit of the team, and
by the way the players unselfishly
shared their joy with him. After
the final gun. the team carried
him over to the rooting section
where he said, "I hope this win
was as sweet for you as it is for
us.”
In the dressing room, he spoke
of the players' "faith in me; they
stuck with it to build this team.
Lots of wins are big ones because
I you play it great game, but this
win was extremely big for me, be
cause the kids were not only happy
for the win, but they were happy
for my sake."
The team got a big morale lift
when its speedy halfback, Tyco
Fitzmorris, who is out for the sea
son with a knee injury, showed up
at the bench just before the game.
Although he had an operation Fri-
I day night, he insisted on seeing
| the game and was brought to the
I field in an ambulance.
Concerning the play itself, Cur
tice was particularly impressed by
Stanford’s blocking; Michigan
State’s defensive ends were con
sistently taken out allowing the
quarterbacks to rollout and throw
into the flats unharrassed. Al
though they didn’t hit the open
receiver every lime, Curtice ex
pects to sharpen up the passing
in the next game or two.
The defense was outstanding,
too; “It must be something new
in the annals of Michigan State to
be forced to go for a field goal
three times in one game,” quipped
Curtice. (The Spartans missed all
three.)
Sophomore John Paye’s touch
down came on his first carry of
the game and of his varsity career.
He played only twenty seconds
against Tulane, and Curtice has
mentioned him very little previ
ously. But he got in when J. D.
Lodato, who ran 30 yards for a
score last week, was injured in the
| third quarter.
The play he scored on was the
I quick pitchout to the short side of
j the field. He followed a crushing
i block by 270 pound tackle Chuck
Buehler at the line of scrimmage
i and out ran two defenders to the
goal line.
This same play has worked for
touchdowns in each of Stanford's
last three games. Last week Lo
| dato ran it in from 30 yards, and
I Gary Craig made it from 24 yards
in last year’s Big Game.
Lodato was Stanford’s only in
jured player. He has a cracked rib
but will probably play next week
against Oregon State.

State’s defensive ends were con
sistently taken out allowing the
quarterbacks to rollout and throw
into the flats unharrassed. Al
though they didn’t hit the open
receiver every lime, Curtice ex
pects to sharpen up the passing
in the next game or two.
The defense was outstanding,
too; “It must be something new
in the annals of Michigan State to
be forced to go for a field goal
three times in one game,” quipped
Curtice. (The Spartans missed all
three.)
Sophomore John Paye’s touch
down came on his first carry of
the game and of his varsity career.
He played only twenty seconds
against Tulane, and Curtice has
mentioned him very little previ
ously. But he got in when J. D.
Lodato, who ran 30 yards for a
score last week, was injured in the
| third quarter.
The play he scored on was the
I quick pitchout to the short side of
j the field. He followed a crushing
i block by 270 pound tackle Chuck
Buehler at the line of scrimmage
i and out ran two defenders to the
goal line.
This same play has worked for
touchdowns in each of Stanford's
last three games. Last week Lo
| dato ran it in from 30 yards, and
I Gary Craig made it from 24 yards
in last year’s Big Game.
Lodato was Stanford’s only in
jured player. He has a cracked rib
but will probably play next week
against Oregon State.

‘ You deserved to win,” Duffy
Daugherty said to Jack Curtice
as the two coaches met on the field
after Stanford had upset Michigan
State, 1(3-13.
It was a case of an unheralded
West Coast team coming off four
consecutive losing seasons and lie- i
ing psychologically primed for one
of the nation’s five top ranked
teams, and heating the daylight
out of it. MSU had come to Cali
fornia fora pleasant road trip and
a football game, expecting to win
easily against a team it had bru-

I tally beaten three straight times.
Indian center C. B. Simons, who
had continually opened up running
room throughout the game against
an All-American center who out
weighed him by 30 pounds,
summed up the situation best
when he said: "They didn’t believe
we had the horses, but we did.”
Curtice refused to take credit
for boosting the team’s spirit in
I preparation for the game. ‘‘Your
opposition gets your boys up or
down," he said.
Curtice was most thrilled by the
unity and spirit of the team, and
by the way the players unselfishly
shared their joy with him. After
the final gun. the team carried
him over to the rooting section
where he said, "I hope this win
was as sweet for you as it is for
us.”
In the dressing room, he spoke
of the players' "faith in me; they
stuck with it to build this team.
Lots of wins are big ones because
I you play it great game, but this
win was extremely big for me, be
cause the kids were not only happy
for the win, but they were happy
for my sake."
The team got a big morale lift
when its speedy halfback, Tyco
Fitzmorris, who is out for the sea
son with a knee injury, showed up
at the bench just before the game.
Although he had an operation Fri-
I day night, he insisted on seeing
| the game and was brought to the
I field in an ambulance.
Concerning the play itself, Cur
tice was particularly impressed by
Stanford’s blocking; Michigan
State’s defensive ends were con
sistently taken out allowing the
quarterbacks to rollout and throw
into the flats unharrassed. Al
