# Stanford Bursts MSU’s Bubble, 16-13
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford will have a good deal to say about who rules the roost in the AAWU.
The Cards uncovered another fleet soph halfback. Johnny Paye, who ran 33 yards for the win
ning touchdown as Stanford defeated nationally-ranked Michigan State much more decisively
than the 16-13 score would indicate.
Paye, Tony DeLellis and Stan Lindskog deserve mountains of credit for doing all of Stanford’s
scoring, but the player of the game was Card linebacker fullback Ed Cummings. The 207-pound

senior from Anaconda, Montana,♦
so dominated the game on de
fense that he was voted the back
of the game though he carried
the ball only once. Cummings
either made single-handedly or
participated in ‘id tackles.

All in all, Stanford defense car
ried the day. Tim Hansel, Gary
Craig and Gary Sargent effective
ly bottled up the MSU passing
attack, except lot one freak play
lale in the final period that set
up the Spartans’ last score. A
fumble by quarterback Pete
Smith was picked up by halfback
! Ron Rubick and thrown to Jeff
Abrecht for 27 yards to Stan
ford’s one. As it was, it took the
Spartans two plays to score.
Good kicking by Stanford, j
both placement and punt, and
| poor booting by the Spartans was j
a big factor in the game. Stan)
Lindskog toed a 21-yard field goal 1
| late in the first half to give Stan- j
j ford a lead they never relinquish- j
j ed, and Gary Craig averaged over j
40-yards punting in the second
| half, after suffering through a
j wretched first half. State missed j
i two field goals and an extra |
I point, and averaged only 30 yards
(on four punts.
Michigan opened the scoring
I late in the first quarter, taking j
j advantage of a punt off the side j
|of Craig’s foot traveling only 16,
j yards. In going the 29 yards need- 1
I ed in eight plays, MSU was forced
j into fourth down situations twice
land was aided by a 15-yard pen
j alty once.
Behind 7-0, Stanford evened the
j score early in the second quarter. |
| A 37-yard pass from Steve Thur- j
I law to Bob Howard, who made a (
great, leaping catch at the one,*
i accounted tor nearly all the neces- j
I sary yardage.

] Stanford went 86 yards for j
their go-ahead score, the 24-yard I
! field goal by Lindskog. Babajian !
j ran for 25 yards in the drive, but j
i the big play was a 42-yard screen 1
j pass from Thurlow to J. D. Lo
| dato that brought the ball to the
six.
Michigan State mounted an
other drive in the last few min- j
ites of the half, with Smith com- j
pleting to Matt Snorton twice and ■
bringing the ball to the Stanford
seven.
But Smith fired once too often
to Snorton. Hansel batted his
next pass away, and Craig caught j
it on his knees in the end zone to j
lend the threat.
It only took the Cards 4:40 in
to the second half to push over
(he stand-up tally. The Spartans
were forced to punt, and Stan- \
ford took over on their own 22 I
after being penalized for clipping.
Babajian gained three up the
middle, and Thurlow hit Patitucci
for 25 yards. It was Babajian for
two more, and two completions
to Boh Howard putting the ball
on the MSU 33.
Paye went over on the pitchout
around left end that has served
Stanford so well in their last
three games. Again it was Chuck I
Buehler cutting down the wing- j
back that enabled a Card back i
to go all the way. The pitchout
play enabled Stanford to beat j
Cal last year, and sprung J. D. I
! Lodato for the only Stanford j

touchdown against Tulane last
week. This was the only time
Stanford used the play all day.
A bad snap from center and
fumble on the placing of the ball
caused Lindskog’s missed PAT,
and the score was 16-7 with 26
minutes left to play.
Later in the quarter. MSU’s
Rubick returned Craig’s 47-yard
punt 64 yards to the Stanford 18.
Danny Spence made his only tac
kle of the game on the play, sav
ing a touchdown. Stanford held,
and George Azar’s attempted
field goal didn’t even reach the
end zone.
On only two plays in the fourth
quarter was the ball in the Michi-1
gan half of the field. The first j
was a Craig punt just past the
mid-field stripe after the Spar- j
tans held Stanford following the j
missed field goal.

Again MSU moved inside the i
Stanford It), thanks to Rubick.
He ran for 11 and passed for 27
on the drive. But Patitucci |
stopped him at the twelve on
fourth down.
Patitucci’s tackle made the re
sult a foregone conclusion, as
Stanford had a 16-7 yead and
only five and a half minutes of
play remained,
Stanford tried to run out the
clock, but had to punt, and the
Spartans made the result respect
able on the fluke pass play to
the one-yard line. Saimes ran
over his second touchdown two
plays later.
I The Spartans tried an on-sides
i kick with 1:36 remaining hut that
I failed, and Thurlow ran out the
j clock.
j With such a convincing win
over a team ranked among the'

j ten best elevens in the country
by the wire services, doubtless
i Stanford will also be nationally
j ranked, which doesn't really mat
j ter. All that matters is that no
veteran football observers can
doubt the ability of the Stanford
team, be they as for North as
Jim Owens at Washington or as
for South as John McKay of
USC. Stanford is a quantity to be
reckoned with, and McKay and
Owens may lie awake a few
nights trying to figure out just
how to reckon with it.
Close to 10,000 Stanford stu
dents are convinced their team is
the most magnificent thing in ex
istence, and how can 10.000 he
wrong?

their go-ahead score, the 24-yard I
! field goal by Lindskog. Babajian !
j ran for 25 yards in the drive, but j
i the big play was a 42-yard screen 1
j pass from Thurlow to J. D. Lo
| dato that brought the ball to the
six.
Michigan State mounted an
other drive in the last few min- j
ites of the half, with Smith com- j
pleting to Matt Snorton twice and ■
bringing the ball to the Stanford
seven.
But Smith fired once too often
to Snorton. Hansel batted his
next pass away, and Craig caught j
it on his knees in the end zone to j
lend the threat.
It only took the Cards 4:40 in
to the second half to push over
(he stand-up tally. The Spartans
were forced to punt, and Stan- \
ford took over on their own 22 I
after being penalized for clipping.
Babajian gained three up the
middle, and Thurlow hit Patitucci
for 25 yards. It was Babajian for
two more, and two completions
to Boh Howard putting the ball
on the MSU 33.
Paye went over on the pitchout
around left end that has served
Stanford so well in their last
three games. Again it was Chuck I
Buehler cutting down the wing- j
back that enabled a Card back i
to go all the way. The pitchout
play enabled Stanford to beat j
Cal last year, and sprung J. D. I
! Lodato for the only Stanford j

touchdown against Tulane last
week. This was the only time
Stanford used the play all day.
A bad snap from center and
fumble on the placing of the ball
caused Lindskog’s missed PAT,
and the score was 16-7 with 26
minutes left to play.
Later in the quarter. MSU’s
Rubick returned Craig’s 47-yard
punt 64 yards to the Stanford 18.
Danny Spence made his only tac
kle of the game on the play, sav
ing a touchdown. Stanford held,
and George Azar’s attempted
field goal didn’t even reach the
end zone.
On only two plays in the fourth
quarter was the ball in the Michi-1
gan half of the field. The first j
was a Craig punt just past the
mid-field stripe after the Spar- j
tans held Stanford following the j
missed field goal.

Again MSU moved inside the i
Stanford It), thanks to Rubick.
He ran for 11 and passed for 27
on the drive. But Patitucci |
stopped him at the twelve on
fourth down.
Patitucci’s tackle made the re
sult a foregone conclusion, as
Stanford had a 16-7 yead and
only five and a half minutes of
play remained,
Stanford tried to run out the
clock, but had to punt, and the
Spartans made the result respect
able on the fluke pass play to
the one-yard line. Saimes ran
over his second touchdown two
plays later.
I The Spartans tried an on-sides
i kick with 1:36 remaining hut that
I failed, and Thurlow ran out the
j clock.
j With such a convincing win
over a team ranked among the'

j ten best elevens in the country
by the wire services, doubtless
i Stanford will also be nationally
j ranked, which doesn't really mat
j ter. All that matters is that no
veteran football observers can
doubt the ability of the Stanford
team, be they as for North as
Jim Owens at Washington or as
for South as John McKay of
USC. Stanford is a quantity to be
reckoned with, and McKay and
Owens may lie awake a few
nights trying to figure out just
how to reckon with it.
Close to 10,000 Stanford stu

TD put the Indians ahead 16—7. This was Paye's first varsity ball
carrying attempt.
Stanford will have a good deal to say about who rules the roost in the AAWU.
The Cards uncovered another fleet soph halfback. Johnny Paye, who ran 33 yards for the win
ning touchdown as Stanford defeated nationally-ranked Michigan State much more decisively
than the 16-13 score would indicate.
Paye, Tony DeLellis and Stan Lindskog deserve mountains of credit for doing all of Stanford’s
scoring, but the player of the game was Card linebacker fullback Ed Cummings. The 207-pound

senior from Anaconda, Montana,♦
so dominated the game on de
fense that he was voted the back
of the game though he carried
the ball only once. Cummings
either made single-handedly or

attack, except lot one freak play
lale in the final period that set

on the six point end of a 33 yard run early in the third quarter. The
TD put the Indians ahead 16—7. This was Paye's first varsity ball
carrying attempt.
Stanford will have a good deal to say about who rules the roost in the AAWU.
The Cards uncovered another fleet soph halfback. Johnny Paye, who ran 33 yards for the win
ning touchdown as Stanford defeated nationally-ranked Michigan State much more decisively
than the 16-13 score would indicate.
Paye, Tony DeLellis and Stan Lindskog deserve mountains of credit for doing all of Stanford’s
scoring, but the player of the game was Card linebacker fullback Ed Cummings. The 207-pound

senior from Anaconda, Montana,♦
so dominated the game on de
fense that he was voted the back
of the game though he carried
the ball only once. Cummings
either made single-handedly or
participated in ‘id tackles.

All in all, Stanford defense car
ried the day. Tim Hansel, Gary
Craig and Gary Sargent effective
ly bottled up the MSU passing
attack, except lot one freak play
lale in the final period that set
up the Spartans’ last score. A
fumble by quarterback Pete
Smith was picked up by halfback
! Ron Rubick and thrown to Jeff
Abrecht for 27 yards to Stan
ford’s one. As it was, it took the
Spartans two plays to score.
Good kicking by Stanford, j
both placement and punt, and
| poor booting by the Spartans was j
a big factor in the game. Stan)
Lindskog toed a 21-yard field goal 1
| late in the first half to give Stan- j
j ford a lead they never relinquish- j
j ed, and Gary Craig averaged over j
40-yards punting in the second
| half, after suffering through a
j wretched first half. State missed j
i two field goals and an extra |
I point, and averaged only 30 yards
(on four punts.
Michigan opened the scoring
I late in the first quarter, taking j
j advantage of a punt off the side j
|of Craig’s foot traveling only 16,
j yards. In going the 29 yards need- 1
I ed in eight plays, MSU was forced
j into fourth down situations twice
land was aided by a 15-yard pen
j alty once.
Behind 7-0, Stanford evened the
j score early in the second quarter. |
| A 37-yard pass from Steve Thur- j
I law to Bob Howard, who made a (
great, leaping catch at the one,*
i accounted tor nearly all the neces- j
I sary yardage.

] Stanford went 86 yards for j
their go-ahead score, the 24-yard I
! field goal by Lindskog. Babajian !
j ran for 25 yards in the drive, but j
i the big play was a 42-yard screen 1
j pass from Thurlow to J. D. Lo
| dato that brought the ball to the
six.
Michigan State mounted an
other drive in the last few min- j
ites of the half, with Smith com- j
pleting to Matt Snorton twice and ■
bringing the ball to the Stanford
seven.
But Smith fired once too often
to Snorton. Hansel batted his
next pass away, and Craig caught j
it on his knees in the end zone to j
lend the threat.
It only took the Cards 4:40 in
to the second half to push over
(he stand-up tally. The Spartans
were forced to punt, and Stan- \
ford took over on their own 22 I
after being penalized for clipping.
Babajian gained three up the
middle, and Thurlow hit Patitucci
for 25 yards. It was Babajian for
two more, and two completions
to Boh Howard putting the ball
on the MSU 33.
Paye went over on the pitchout
around left end that has served
Stanford so well in their last
three games. Again it was Chuck I
Buehler cutting down the wing- j
back that enabled a Card back i
to go all the way. The pitchout
play enabled Stanford to beat j
Cal last year, and sprung J. D. I
! Lodato for the only Stanford j

touchdown against Tulane last
week. This was the only time
Stanford used the play all day.
A bad snap from center and
fumble on the placing of the ball
caused Lindskog’s missed PAT,
and the score was 16-7 with 26
minutes left to play.

Danny Spence made his only tac

than the 16-13 score would indicate.
Paye, Tony DeLellis and Stan Lindskog deserve mountains of credit for doing all of Stanford’s
scoring, but the player of the game was Card linebacker fullback Ed Cummings. The 207-pound

senior from Anaconda, Montana,♦
so dominated the game on de
fense that he was voted the back
of the game though he carried
the ball only once. Cummings
either made single-handedly or
participated in ‘id tackles.

All in all, Stanford defense car
ried the day. Tim Hansel, Gary
Craig and Gary Sargent effective
ly bottled up the MSU passing
attack, except lot one freak play
lale in the final period that set
up the Spartans’ last score. A
fumble by quarterback Pete
Smith was picked up by halfback
! Ron Rubick and thrown to Jeff
Abrecht for 27 yards to Stan
ford’s one. As it was, it took the
Spartans two plays to score.
Good kicking by Stanford, j
both placement and punt, and
| poor booting by the Spartans was j
a big factor in the game. Stan)
Lindskog toed a 21-yard field goal 1
| late in the first half to give Stan- j
j ford a lead they never relinquish- j
j ed, and Gary Craig averaged over j
40-yards punting in the second
| half, after suffering through a
j wretched first half. State missed j
i two field goals and an extra |
I point, and averaged only 30 yards
(on four punts.
Michigan opened the scoring
I late in the first quarter, taking j
j advantage of a punt off the side j
|of Craig’s foot traveling only 16,
j yards. In going the 29 yards need- 1
I ed in eight plays, MSU was forced
j into fourth down situations twice
land was aided by a 15-yard pen
j alty once.
Behind 7-0, Stanford evened the
j score early in the second quarter. |
| A 37-yard pass from Steve Thur- j
I law to Bob Howard, who made a (
great, leaping catch at the one,*
i accounted tor nearly all the neces- j
I sary yardage.

] Stanford went 86 yards for j
their go-ahead score, the 24-yard I
! field goal by Lindskog. Babajian !
j ran for 25 yards in the drive, but j
i the big play was a 42-yard screen 1
j pass from Thurlow to J. D. Lo
| dato that brought the ball to the
six.
Michigan State mounted an
other drive in the last few min- j
ites of the half, with Smith com- j
pleting to Matt Snorton twice and ■
bringing the ball to the Stanford
seven.
But Smith fired once too often
to Snorton. Hansel batted his
next pass away, and Craig caught j
it on his knees in the end zone to j
lend the threat.
It only took the Cards 4:40 in
to the second half to push over
(he stand-up tally. The Spartans
were forced to punt, and Stan- \
ford took over on their own 22 I
after being penalized for clipping.
Babajian gained three up the
middle, and Thurlow hit Patitucci
for 25 yards. It was Babajian for
two more, and two completions
to Boh Howard putting the ball
on the MSU 33.
Paye went over on the pitchout
around left end that has served
Stanford so well in their last
three games. Again it was Chuck I
Buehler cutting down the wing- j
back that enabled a Card back i
to go all the way. The pitchout
play enabled Stanford to beat j
Cal last year, and sprung J. D. I
! Lodato for the only Stanford j

touchdown against Tulane last
week. This was the only time
Stanford used the play all day.
A bad snap from center and
fumble on the placing of the ball
caused Lindskog’s missed PAT,
and the score was 16-7 with 26
minutes left to play.
Later in the quarter. MSU’s
Rubick returned Craig’s 47-yard
punt 64 yards to the Stanford 18.
Danny Spence made his only tac
kle of the game on the play, sav
ing a touchdown. Stanford held,
and George Azar’s attempted
field goal didn’t even reach the
end zone.
On only two plays in the fourth
quarter was the ball in the Michi-1
gan half of the field. The first j
was a Craig punt just past the
mid-field stripe after the Spar- j
tans held Stanford following the j
missed field goal.

Again MSU moved inside the i
Stanford It), thanks to Rubick.
He ran for 11 and passed for 27
on the drive. But Patitucci |
stopped him at the twelve on
fourth down.
Patitucci’s tackle made the re
sult a foregone conclusion, as
Stanford had a 16-7 yead and
only five and a half minutes of
play remained,
Stanford tried to run out the
clock, but had to punt, and the
Spartans made the result respect
able on the fluke pass play to
the one-yard line. Saimes ran
over his second touchdown two
plays later.
I The Spartans tried an on-sides
i kick with 1:36 remaining hut that
I failed, and Thurlow ran out the
j clock.
j With such a convincing win
over a team ranked among the'

j ten best elevens in the country
by the wire services, doubtless
i Stanford will also be nationally
j ranked, which doesn't really mat
j ter. All that matters is that no
veteran football observers can
doubt the ability of the Stanford
team, be they as for North as
Jim Owens at Washington or as
for South as John McKay of
USC. Stanford is a quantity to be
reckoned with, and McKay and
Owens may lie awake a few
nights trying to figure out just
how to reckon with it.
Close to 10,000 Stanford stu
dents are convinced their team is
