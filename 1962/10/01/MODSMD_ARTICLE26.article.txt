Dougherty had little to say about
his Michigan State squad’s loss to
Stanford Saturday. They de
served the win; they out-hustled
us,” said the stubby white-haired,
obviously unhappy mentor.
The Spartan coach was disap
pointed in the performance of his
first team. ‘‘I said before the sea
son that all we had was a first
unit,” he quoted himself, “but to
day all we had was a second string,
'i'he second unit played good ball,
though. They (Stanford) only
burned them once, on that screen
pass,” (J. D. Loduto’s 12 yarder to
MSU’s six I.
Commenting on the field goal
which Spartan Jim Bobbitt missed
in the fourth quarter, Dougherty
said that ho had called the play
from the sidelines. “We needed
to score twice, and it didn’t matter
how we did it,” he said. Bobbitt
was injured in practice a week
ago, and was wearing a leg brace
against the Indians.
Thurlow got special praise from
Daugherty. “He got them off the
hook several times. He got the
yardage one way or another and
made the first down when they
| needed it.”

always does a great job with the
material he has. He has a good of

Big Ten championship, Daugherty
said that he expects a great deal
of improvement over this, the
Spartans’ first game of the season.
