# Steam Starts Union Series
## 
### 
As the first of Tresidder Un
ion’s new Monday coffee hour
series, Dr. Charles McLaughlin
of the History Department will
present a lecture-discussion on
“The Magic of Steam.”
Professor McLaughlin’s inter
est in steam and especially in the
steam automobile was first
aroused while he was at. Har
vard. He has written an article
on “The Stanley Steamer: A
Study in Unsuccessful Innova
tion,” a copy of which is in the
Browsing Room of Tresidder
Union.
In conjunction with Professor
McLaughlin’s talk, Plarrah’s Au
tomobile Collection of Reno will
exhibit a 1909 Stanley Steamer
and a 1925 Doble today in front
of the post office. In addition,
various books pertaining to the
steam automobile are available
in the Browsing Room.
The lecture will be today at
4:30 in Tresidder’s Program
Lounge, an ideal setting for this
type of informal program. All
members of the. Stanford commu
nity are invited to attend.
