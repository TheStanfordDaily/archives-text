INDIANS
Nothing, but nothing
sets off your new suit
more neatly than
some trim button tab
shirts, particularly the
ones served up by
famed Gant of New
Haven, shirtsmith of
Ivyland. Beautifully
tailored, of fine
materials, theyâ€™re
basic to your R A
wardrobe. In white
(for rooting section or
datetime) or in good
looking stripes of
three different meas
ures. Smart buy,
6.50 and 7.50.
