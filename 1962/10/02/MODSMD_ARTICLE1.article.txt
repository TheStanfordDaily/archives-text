### 
United Press lutenuitloual
.SAN FRANCISCO Gov. Edmund G. Brown and challenger
Richard M. Nixon collided yesterday in a heated exchange during
their' only face-to-face meeting of the California campaign for gov
ernor.
In a one-hour joint appearance before the National Conference
of United Press International Editors and Publishers, Nixon said
he would issue an executive order denying the right to speak on any
state university campus to a person who took the Fifth Amendment
when quizzed by a grand jury or Congressional Committee about
Communist activities.
Brown said the decision should be left to the board of regents
of the university.
"I don’t believe in political censorship of the state university in
any shape, form or manner,” the governor said.
Nixon said he was not endorsing any candidates for federal
office, including incumbent Republican Congressman John H. Rous
selot and Edgar W. Hiestand. Then, although the candidates had
agreed they would not question each other directly, he turned to
Brown and said:
“I want to know if you endorse Assemblymen John A. O’Con
nell and Phillip Burton who helped to lead the riots against the
House Un-American Activities Committee.”
Brown replied: ‘‘They have been fine outstanding state legisla
tors and although I haven’t agreed with all of their opinion, I am
unequivocally supporting them.”
ASTRONAUT FLIGHT IN DOUBT— CAPE CANAVERAL Chances
of getting astronaut Walter M. Schirra off on a six-orbit spaceflight
on Wednesday dropped to 50-50 Monday as that old bugaboo weather
tossed a two-way threat at man-in-space plans.
The space agency still planned to try to launch Schirra in his
Sigma 7 space cabin on a 160,000-mile trip between 8 and 10 a.m.
EOT Wednesday.
But space agency weather experts admitted that stormy seas
in an Atlantic Ocean recovery area and possible cloudiness over
Capo Canaveral that day- caused real concern.
LONGSHOREMEN STRIKE— NEW YORK—Thousands of long
shoremen crippled waterfront commerce along the Atlantic and Gulf
coasts yesterday in a multi-million dollar strike that President Ken
nedy moved quickly to halt.
Kennedy invoked the Taft-Hartley law, named a three-member
board of inquiry and ordered it to report to him by Thursday as the
first step in obtaining a federal court injunction for an 80-day
“cooling off” period.

United Press lutenuitloual
.SAN FRANCISCO Gov. Edmund G. Brown and challenger
Richard M. Nixon collided yesterday in a heated exchange during
their' only face-to-face meeting of the California campaign for gov
ernor.
In a one-hour joint appearance before the National Conference
of United Press International Editors and Publishers, Nixon said
he would issue an executive order denying the right to speak on any
state university campus to a person who took the Fifth Amendment
when quizzed by a grand jury or Congressional Committee about
Communist activities.
Brown said the decision should be left to the board of regents
of the university.
"I don’t believe in political censorship of the state university in
any shape, form or manner,” the governor said.
Nixon said he was not endorsing any candidates for federal
office, including incumbent Republican Congressman John H. Rous
selot and Edgar W. Hiestand. Then, although the candidates had
agreed they would not question each other directly, he turned to
Brown and said:
“I want to know if you endorse Assemblymen John A. O’Con
nell and Phillip Burton who helped to lead the riots against the
House Un-American Activities Committee.”
Brown replied: ‘‘They have been fine outstanding state legisla
tors and although I haven’t agreed with all of their opinion, I am
unequivocally supporting them.”
ASTRONAUT FLIGHT IN DOUBT— CAPE CANAVERAL Chances
of getting astronaut Walter M. Schirra off on a six-orbit spaceflight
on Wednesday dropped to 50-50 Monday as that old bugaboo weather
tossed a two-way threat at man-in-space plans.
The space agency still planned to try to launch Schirra in his
Sigma 7 space cabin on a 160,000-mile trip between 8 and 10 a.m.
EOT Wednesday.
But space agency weather experts admitted that stormy seas
in an Atlantic Ocean recovery area and possible cloudiness over
Capo Canaveral that day- caused real concern.
