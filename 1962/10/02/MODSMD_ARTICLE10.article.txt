### 
OXFORD, Miss. (UPl)—Fourteen-hundred troops and U.S.
marshals yesterday forced the enrollment of Negro James Mere
dith in the University of Mississippi.
Riots caused hy his presence spilled over into the? town of
Oxford where soldiers used tear gas and bayonets to rout die-hard

demonstrators. Two persons were
killed and at least 75 injured in
the wild series of encounters that
started Sunday night and con
tinued into yesterday afternoon.
Maj. Gen. Edwin E. Walker,
who said he was on the “wrong
side” when ho commanded Army
troops in the Little Rock, Ark.,
school integration crisis of 1957,
was mai'ched out of downtown
Oxford at bayonet point and later
arrested.
WALKER was taken into cus
tody on charges of conspiracy to
incite rebellion or insurrection;
actually inciting to rebellion or
insurrection: conspiracy to hin
der federal officers in the per
formance of their duties and as
saulting a federal officer.
He could be sentenced to a max
imum 39 years in jail and fined

$40,000 if found guilty on all
counts.
Meredith was officially enrolled
at 10:35 a.m. EDT but only after
troops laid virtual seige to both
the school and the town.
The 29-year-old Air Force veter
an got several sniffs of the tear
gas that hung in the air on the
campus grounds and he rubbed
his eyes occasionally as he made
his way to his first class—Ameri
can History—in the company of
U.S, mashals.
THE RIOTERS retreated to the
downtown area after bayonet
weilding troops forced them from
the campus and ended a night
long nightmare during which the
marshals faced sniper fire and
dodged flaming "Molotov cock
tails.”
By yesterday afternoon 112
persons had been arrested in Ox
ford in connection with the riots.
The federal troops marched their
prisoners down the street at gun
point with their hands raised over
their heads.
Troops cleaned out what appar
ently was the last major pocket
of resistance about midday by
loosing a tear gas barrage in
downtown Oxford. Women stag
gered from stores, their eyes
streaming with tears, and mer
chants and town officials stood
by in disbelief.
“I never thought I would see it
come to this,” said Tom Scarbor
ough, former commissioner of
public safety, who watched the
mop-up operation from a safe dis
tance.
FEDERAL TROOPS laid down
the gas barrage after roving
gangs of toughs hurled “gas
bombs” and bottles at Army ve
hicles and troops that moved into
the town. One man climbed a
balcony, tore off a piece of rail
ing and hurled it at troops pass
ing in a truck. A Negro soldier
was slightly injured when hit by
a rain of pop bottles.
Gov. Ross Barnett, who precipi
tated the state-federal clash by
personally barring Meredith from
the “Old Miss” campus, issued a
brief statement yesterday morn
ing declaring “there has been an
invasion of our state resulting in
bloodshed of our citizens and
threatened bloodshed of others.
He said that because of this he
was ordering the Mississippi state
flag at the capitol to be flown at
half mast.
