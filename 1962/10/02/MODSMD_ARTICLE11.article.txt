# Nixon, Brown

In the Nixon-Brown debate televised yesterday from San Fran
cisco, the issue of speaker prohibitions on state university cam
puses was raised. Whereas Governor Brown stated that the Board
of Regents was competent to judge on this matter, Mr. Nixon
suggested that since the Governor is a Regent, he should exert
his leadership and simply prohibit certain undesirables from
speaking at the University of California. Mr. Nixon stated that if
be were elected he would issue an executive decree to forbid from
speaking those persons who, when questioned on Communist ac
tivities by a legislative committee, took the Fifth Amendment. Mr.
Nixon would also forbid Communists and “subversives” from
speaking.
Whatever the advisability of a prohibition on Communists and
“subversives,” Mr. Nixon’s stand on persons invoking the Fifth
Amendment is less advisable than the Governor’s willingness to
let the Regents rule on matters of academic freedom. The Regents
are probably less subject to the kind of political pressure which
public opinion may exert when it is inflamed by transitory issues.
A Governor might have to respond more directly to public whim,
especially in the event of another McCarthyite era.
The implications of Mr. Nixon’s stand are particularly dis
turbing. By restricting the privileges of men who exercise their
Constitutional right to protect themselves against self-incrimina
tion, Mr. Nixon classifies these men with Communists and “sub
versives.” He implies that they will present to students ideas that
are as subversive as those of Communists because they have
exercised the ideas embodied in the Bill of Rights.
Governor Brown’s more moderate stand will not please many
liberals, but his stand on academic freedom is preferable to Mr.
Nixon’s promise to restrict that freedom if he gets the chance.
Governor Brown’s principle is sound: students should be made
safe for ideas; ideas should not be made safe for students.
