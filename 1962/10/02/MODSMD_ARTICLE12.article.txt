# Freshman English
## 
### 
The English Department is presently undertaking a revision of
its program for freshmen. Under the direction of Dr. Wilfred
Stone, the freshman English program is being modified to include
twice the previous number of Special English classes for students
whose performance on the Verbal SAT’s and English Advanced
Placement tests indicates a special ability and background.
Just as significant an improvement in the program for talented
freshmen is an undertaking by Professor Guerard. He will teach
a freshman seminar to six or more students whose exceptional
promise merits special attention The seminar participants will
engage in advanced literary criticism and advanced writing.
For those of real promise who do not have the opportunity to
be in the special seminar, satisfaction of the English requirement
will be met by taking Professor Guerard’s “Forms of the Modern
Novel.” Although the special seminar will have a direct effect on
a mere handful of students, the trend toward a more advanced
freshman curriculum is affecting several hundred students within
the English Department alone. With twelve special sections for
freshmen, three hundred students will benefit from advanced
treatment of literature and a more sophisticated study of the
techniques of writing.
What is most noteworthy in this improved program is Profes
sor Guerard’s teaching a class of freshmen. In most large univer
sities and in many great universities, it is unheard of for a full
professor to deign to teach ignorant, unsophisticated freshmen.
And for a professor of Guerard’s stature to undertake such instruc
tion is not the rule but the exception. Perhaps these developments
indicate that Stanford is especially cognizant of the talent within
its freshman classes.
If the History Department were to institute such a seminar as
a supplement to Independent Study, the freshman curriculum
would take on a radically altered appearance for at least a few
students.
