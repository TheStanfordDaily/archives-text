There are again this year approximately five hundred foreign
students enrolled at Stanford, enrolled insofar as they are taking
courses for degrees. Whether they are at all well-integrated with
in the general campus life is, however, questionable. Despite
efforts of a core of interested American students, relatively few
American students are aware of their presence. And being aware
of someone’s presence is not to be confused with associating with
that someone. Why American students and foreign students are
not more successfully integrated at Stanford is a perplexing prob
lem. The situation is not given to easy solution either.
An important step in the direction of greater mutual contact
was taken last weekend when a large number from both groups
attended a slightly liquored party at a private home in the foot
hills. A series of similar social events in “the course of the year
will do much to bring about a profitable relationship among all of
those able to attend. Coffee hours at the International Club are
fine, but coffee serve only to keep people awake.
