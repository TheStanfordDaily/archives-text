## South West Africans Seek Educations 
### JOHN STEINBRUNER 
To those who last year asked
what membership in the National
Student Association could do for
Stanford, a tangible and impres
sive answer has already been
made. An ad hoc committee of
Stanford students is now being
formed to answer the plea of two
South West African students for
immediate help in what is, for
them, the almost impossible task
of getting an education.
At their 15th National Congress
in August, the USNSA passed a
resolution on the educational sys
tem in the Republic of South
Africa and in the international
territory of South West Africa
which the Republic administers
under an old League of Nations
mandate now under United Na
tions auspices.
THE RESOLUTION takes note
of the apartheid policy of South
Africa; of the recent “sabotage
act’’; of the arbitrary use of pow
er to deny basic freedoms to citi
zens and most brutally to non
white citizens, and finally, of the
effective denial of adequate edu
cation to the non-white popula
tion.
The resolution condemns these
practices and asserts their rights
of students as citizens to the
freedoms we consider fundamen
tal.
In the mandate section, the
resolution urges “ . . . the ini
tiation and support of member
student governments for pro
grams on South West Africa
which will establish funds, schol
arships and other forms of aid to
further the education of students
who have fled the territory,” and
it also encourages “ . . . the es
tablishment of special campus
commissions to study issues of
South Africa and South West Af
rica and support of campus infor
mation projects to secure a
broader discussion of these issues
on American college campuses.”
THE IMPETUS for these two
sections of the mandate came
specifically through the Stanford
delegation to the Congress.
Previous to the drafting of leg
islation. the Stanford delegates
had met with Hans Beukes and
Moses Garoeb, students from
South West, in a local beer gar
den to discuss their situation.
Hans Beukes was smuggled out
of South West Africa by former
Stanford Assistant Dean of Men
A1 Lowenstein when Beukes was
refused papers at the last minute
to go to Norway to accept a schol
arship at Oslo.
IN 1957, Beukes was flown,
through contributions of Ameri
can students, to the UN to plead
his case and the case of his peo
ple.
Moses Garoeb fled the territory
on his own, traveled northward
through the Congo at the peak of
its turmoil, and arrived after a
year’s journey in Tanganyika,
where he was finally flown to the
United States and sent to Lincoln
University in Pennsylvania on a
State Department scholarship.
At the NSA Congress two per
tinent developments occurred.
First, the students from South
West who have fled the Territory
are attempting to establish a stu
dent Union to help those who fol
low them receive proper educa
tion in various parts of the
world.
SECOND, two of the main stu
dent leaders of South West, who
have appeared as petitioners be
fore the UN on behalf of their
country, specifically requested
help from the Stanford delegates.
The outcome was that a com
mittee of interested students at
Stanford would be established to
aid the African students who had
fled from the Territory in any
way possible.
It was thought at the time that
approximately 30 of these South
West Africans were in Dar-es-
Salaam and were in need of as
sistance in starting high school
and university work, and there
was a certain urgency about the
whole matter because of the feel
ing that they should not be left
there indefinitely without assist
ance.
THE COMMITTEE was pro
posed to find out about these es
caped students and to discover
what, if anything, could be done
to assist them.
The legislation at the Congress
was subsequently enacted to give
a national base for this committee
and to encourage the establish
ment of others like it at other
universities.
Since the Congress there have
been as yet unverified reports
that the students in Dar-es-Sa
laam have been taken to various
foreign countries to study.
MOSES Garoeb has sent the
names of eight South West Afri
cans in Bechuanaland who need
assistance. All are from South
West, and either are ready now
or will be ready within six
months to enter a university. Two
or three are girls, and it is par
ticularly urgent that they be
settled,

York for the opening of the UN

To those who last year asked
what membership in the National
Student Association could do for
Stanford, a tangible and impres
sive answer has already been
made. An ad hoc committee of
Stanford students is now being
formed to answer the plea of two
South West African students for
immediate help in what is, for
them, the almost impossible task
of getting an education.
At their 15th National Congress
in August, the USNSA passed a
resolution on the educational sys
tem in the Republic of South
Africa and in the international
territory of South West Africa
which the Republic administers
under an old League of Nations
mandate now under United Na
tions auspices.
THE RESOLUTION takes note
of the apartheid policy of South
Africa; of the recent “sabotage
act’’; of the arbitrary use of pow
er to deny basic freedoms to citi
zens and most brutally to non
white citizens, and finally, of the
effective denial of adequate edu
cation to the non-white popula
tion.
The resolution condemns these
practices and asserts their rights
of students as citizens to the
freedoms we consider fundamen
tal.
In the mandate section, the
resolution urges “ . . . the ini
tiation and support of member
student governments for pro
grams on South West Africa
which will establish funds, schol
arships and other forms of aid to
further the education of students
who have fled the territory,” and
it also encourages “ . . . the es
tablishment of special campus
commissions to study issues of
South Africa and South West Af
rica and support of campus infor
mation projects to secure a
broader discussion of these issues
on American college campuses.”
THE IMPETUS for these two
sections of the mandate came
specifically through the Stanford
delegation to the Congress.
Previous to the drafting of leg
islation. the Stanford delegates
had met with Hans Beukes and
Moses Garoeb, students from
South West, in a local beer gar
den to discuss their situation.
Hans Beukes was smuggled out
of South West Africa by former
Stanford Assistant Dean of Men
A1 Lowenstein when Beukes was
refused papers at the last minute
to go to Norway to accept a schol
arship at Oslo.
IN 1957, Beukes was flown,
through contributions of Ameri
can students, to the UN to plead
his case and the case of his peo
ple.
Moses Garoeb fled the territory
on his own, traveled northward
through the Congo at the peak of
its turmoil, and arrived after a
year’s journey in Tanganyika,
where he was finally flown to the
United States and sent to Lincoln
University in Pennsylvania on a
State Department scholarship.
At the NSA Congress two per
tinent developments occurred.
First, the students from South
West who have fled the Territory
are attempting to establish a stu
dent Union to help those who fol
low them receive proper educa
tion in various parts of the
world.
SECOND, two of the main stu
dent leaders of South West, who
have appeared as petitioners be
fore the UN on behalf of their
country, specifically requested
help from the Stanford delegates.
The outcome was that a com
mittee of interested students at
Stanford would be established to
aid the African students who had
fled from the Territory in any
way possible.
It was thought at the time that
approximately 30 of these South
West Africans were in Dar-es-
Salaam and were in need of as
sistance in starting high school
and university work, and there
was a certain urgency about the
whole matter because of the feel
ing that they should not be left
there indefinitely without assist
ance.
THE COMMITTEE was pro
posed to find out about these es
caped students and to discover
what, if anything, could be done
to assist them.
The legislation at the Congress
was subsequently enacted to give
a national base for this committee
and to encourage the establish
ment of others like it at other
universities.
Since the Congress there have
been as yet unverified reports
that the students in Dar-es-Sa
laam have been taken to various
foreign countries to study.
MOSES Garoeb has sent the
names of eight South West Afri
cans in Bechuanaland who need
assistance. All are from South

been as yet unverified reports
that the students in Dar-es-Sa

To those who last year asked
what membership in the National
Student Association could do for
Stanford, a tangible and impres
sive answer has already been
made. An ad hoc committee of
Stanford students is now being
formed to answer the plea of two
South West African students for
immediate help in what is, for
them, the almost impossible task
of getting an education.
At their 15th National Congress
in August, the USNSA passed a
resolution on the educational sys
tem in the Republic of South
Africa and in the international
territory of South West Africa
which the Republic administers
under an old League of Nations
mandate now under United Na
tions auspices.
THE RESOLUTION takes note
of the apartheid policy of South
Africa; of the recent “sabotage
act’’; of the arbitrary use of pow
er to deny basic freedoms to citi
zens and most brutally to non
white citizens, and finally, of the
effective denial of adequate edu
cation to the non-white popula
tion.
The resolution condemns these
practices and asserts their rights
of students as citizens to the
freedoms we consider fundamen
tal.
In the mandate section, the
resolution urges “ . . . the ini
tiation and support of member
student governments for pro
grams on South West Africa
which will establish funds, schol
arships and other forms of aid to
further the education of students
who have fled the territory,” and
it also encourages “ . . . the es
tablishment of special campus
commissions to study issues of
South Africa and South West Af
rica and support of campus infor
mation projects to secure a
broader discussion of these issues
on American college campuses.”
THE IMPETUS for these two
sections of the mandate came
specifically through the Stanford
delegation to the Congress.
Previous to the drafting of leg
islation. the Stanford delegates
had met with Hans Beukes and
Moses Garoeb, students from
South West, in a local beer gar
den to discuss their situation.
Hans Beukes was smuggled out
of South West Africa by former
Stanford Assistant Dean of Men
A1 Lowenstein when Beukes was
refused papers at the last minute
to go to Norway to accept a schol
arship at Oslo.
IN 1957, Beukes was flown,
through contributions of Ameri
can students, to the UN to plead
his case and the case of his peo
ple.
Moses Garoeb fled the territory
on his own, traveled northward
through the Congo at the peak of
its turmoil, and arrived after a
year’s journey in Tanganyika,
where he was finally flown to the
United States and sent to Lincoln
University in Pennsylvania on a
State Department scholarship.
At the NSA Congress two per
tinent developments occurred.
First, the students from South
West who have fled the Territory
are attempting to establish a stu
dent Union to help those who fol
low them receive proper educa
tion in various parts of the
world.
SECOND, two of the main stu
dent leaders of South West, who
have appeared as petitioners be
fore the UN on behalf of their
country, specifically requested
help from the Stanford delegates.
The outcome was that a com
mittee of interested students at
Stanford would be established to
aid the African students who had
fled from the Territory in any
way possible.
It was thought at the time that
approximately 30 of these South
West Africans were in Dar-es-
Salaam and were in need of as
sistance in starting high school
and university work, and there
was a certain urgency about the
whole matter because of the feel
ing that they should not be left
there indefinitely without assist
ance.
THE COMMITTEE was pro
posed to find out about these es
caped students and to discover
what, if anything, could be done
to assist them.
The legislation at the Congress
was subsequently enacted to give
a national base for this committee
and to encourage the establish
ment of others like it at other
universities.
