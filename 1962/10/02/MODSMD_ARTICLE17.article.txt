## 'U.S. Must Not Evade Reality, Must Invade Cuba Immediately' 
### RICHARD WEINIG 
The time has come for the
United States to stop evading re
ality: to stop imitating the pro
verbial ostrich, running hell-bent
for the nearest sand hill.
On September 13, in tones rem
iniscent of Neville Chamberlain,
Mr. Kennedy stated that recent
Soviet arms shipments to Cuba
“do not constitute a serious
threat to any part of this hemis
phere.” Such a myth can be main
tained only at risk of sacrificing
the liberty of Latin America and,
by that act, our own.
THE PRESIDENT has ignored
—or concealed—at least three
threats to the Free World which
the present and growing Soviet
arsenal in Cuba poses; not to
mention a moral consideration
which should be of at least pass
ing concern to any statesman
who reveres human liberty and
affirms each nation’s right to self
determination.
First, by allowing Soviet
Union to arm Cuba, construct
nine medium range missile bases
there, and build a major mari
time base upon the island, Mr.
Kennedy will have proclaimed to
the world that the United States
will not oppose communist occu
pancy of any nation in the West
ern Hemisphere unless overt
armed aggression is apparent;
and if the Laotian precedent is to
be followed, not even then. In
short, "We must never negotiate
out of fear, but we must never
fear to negotiate” will be sup
planted by a new slogan: ‘‘We
must never run out of fear, but
we must never fear to run.”
Second, the Soviet maritime
base which is to be, built, osten
sibly to refuel fishing trawlers,
could service enough Russian
submarines and surface raiders
to cripple American shipping in
the south Atlantic in time of war;
a feat which would be unthink
able without such an advance
base of operation.
AND THIRD is the military
threat to Latin America. Since
revolution has surpassed tobacco
and sugar as Cuba’s principal ex
port, the greatest danger pre
sented by Mr. Castro is, in the
words of the liberal “Christian
Science Monitor,” the possibility
that "hemispheric unrest will
grow and that arms, saboteurs,
and revolutionary planners will
be tunneled through Cuba to fan
it.”
The danger is clear and pres
ent. American intelligence
sources have reported that sever
al thousand Ghanian troops are
now training in Cuba for this ex
pressed purpose. The govern
ments of Haiti, the Dominican
Republic, and Venezuela have re
peatedly protested that Cuban
agents have been fomenting revo
lution in their countries for some
months past. And the govern
ments of Colombia, Panama, Cos
ta Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala,
El Salvador, and Peru have ex
pressed grave concern over Cu
ban actions and have quietly in
formed Washington that they
would welcome an invasion of
Cuba by the United States.

formed him of the committee. He
approves of the idea, and indicat
ed that it might be possible to ob
tain UN assistance.
The committee has had a rather
auspicious beginning despite its
organizational infancy. It has not
been officially conceived as far
as the university is concerned
and it in no way implicates the
university or the ASSU at this
point.
It is an ad hoc group of inter
ested students who believe that
scholarships and loans are avail
able for these people and who are
determined to find them. For
those who are interested there
will be a meeting today at 4:30
p.m. in Tresidder Union.

Thus, if Cuban aggression is
the condition requisite for Amer
ican action, Mr. Kennedy has
abundant justification at this
time. But another moral consid
eration is germane. What of the
Cuban people’s right to self-de
termination?
THE VAST majority of the
Cuban people did not choose Cas
tro to oppress them; and, accord
ing to British sources, less than
20 per cent of them favor him at
this time. But their prospect of
overthrowing a communist dic
tatorship without American aid
is no more enviable than was that
of the Hungarians or Tibetans,
for Mr. Castro is held in power
by some 14,000 crack Russian and
Chinese troops, 250 Soviet-made
tanks, and a standing army
equipped with modern weapons.
It should, therefore, be obvious
to any observer that the Cuban
people will not be free and will
be further denied their right to
self-determination as long as the
President of the United States, in
the guise of morality, considers
any mention of liberating this en
slaved nation as “loose talk.”
The time has clearly come for
Mr. Kennedy to recall the actions
of his hero, Franklin D. Roose
velt, when the latter sent a cruis
er full of combat ready Marines
to Uruguay when pro-Nazi forces
attempted to establish a dictator
ship there. The time has come to
effect a final solution to the Cas
tro problem, via invasion; and by
so doing, allow the Cuban people
to govern themselves once again.
BUT SUCH action must be
taken immediately, for the num
ber of American and Cuban lives
which must be lost in such an un
dertaking increases with each
day’s procrastination. Mr. Castro
is entrenching himself. And, as
the President told Congressional
leaders of both parties last week,
the possibility of an existent or
nearly existent Cuban nuclear
striking force cannot be discount
ed. Castro now possesses Soviet
made missiles with ranges of up
to 1700 miles, which may be
fired from existing missile bases
and soon from 15 additional bases
which are now under construc
tion. His air force is equipped
with at least 57 MIG-57 jet fight
ers which may be armed with
tactical nuclear weapons; and
with as many as 200 MIG-200 jet
fighters, which are capable of
carrying nuclear weapons to any
city on the Atlantic seaboard.
In addition, veteran American
intelligence officers in Cuba have
informed the Pentagon of a
strange, secret cargo which was
unloaded at. the port of Casilda
on August 9; a cargo consisting
of large lead caskets similar to
those in which nuclear warheads
are shipped from one part of the
United States to another; caskets
which the forenamed authorities
believe contain either warheads
or gas-type shells which could im
part fearful damage to American
coastal cities. (Los Angeles
“Times,” September 20, 1962. p.
11-5.)
How, then, in other than elec
tion rhetoric, could Mr. Kennedy
contend that Cuba does not "con
stitute a serious threat to any
other part of this hemisphere”?
The hour is somewhat later than
he would lead the American peo
ple to believe.

ship there. The time has come to
effect a final solution to the Cas
tro problem, via invasion; and by
so doing, allow the Cuban people
to govern themselves once again.
BUT SUCH action must be
taken immediately, for the num
ber of American and Cuban lives
which must be lost in such an un
dertaking increases with each
day’s procrastination. Mr. Castro
is entrenching himself. And, as
the President told Congressional
leaders of both parties last week,
the possibility of an existent or
nearly existent Cuban nuclear
striking force cannot be discount
ed. Castro now possesses Soviet
made missiles with ranges of up
to 1700 miles, which may be
fired from existing missile bases
and soon from 15 additional bases
which are now under construc
tion. His air force is equipped
with at least 57 MIG-57 jet fight
ers which may be armed with
tactical nuclear weapons; and
with as many as 200 MIG-200 jet
fighters, which are capable of
carrying nuclear weapons to any
city on the Atlantic seaboard.
In addition, veteran American
intelligence officers in Cuba have
informed the Pentagon of a
strange, secret cargo which was
unloaded at. the port of Casilda
on August 9; a cargo consisting
of large lead caskets similar to
those in which nuclear warheads
are shipped from one part of the
United States to another; caskets
which the forenamed authorities
believe contain either warheads
or gas-type shells which could im
part fearful damage to American
coastal cities. (Los Angeles
“Times,” September 20, 1962. p.
11-5.)
How, then, in other than elec
tion rhetoric, could Mr. Kennedy
contend that Cuba does not "con
stitute a serious threat to any
other part of this hemisphere”?
The hour is somewhat later than
he would lead the American peo
ple to believe.
The time has come for the
United States to stop evading re
ality: to stop imitating the pro
verbial ostrich, running hell-bent
for the nearest sand hill.
On September 13, in tones rem
iniscent of Neville Chamberlain,
Mr. Kennedy stated that recent
Soviet arms shipments to Cuba
“do not constitute a serious
threat to any part of this hemis
phere.” Such a myth can be main
tained only at risk of sacrificing
the liberty of Latin America and,
by that act, our own.
THE PRESIDENT has ignored
—or concealed—at least three
threats to the Free World which
the present and growing Soviet
arsenal in Cuba poses; not to
mention a moral consideration
which should be of at least pass
ing concern to any statesman
who reveres human liberty and
affirms each nation’s right to self
determination.
First, by allowing Soviet
Union to arm Cuba, construct
nine medium range missile bases
there, and build a major mari
time base upon the island, Mr.
Kennedy will have proclaimed to
the world that the United States
will not oppose communist occu
pancy of any nation in the West
ern Hemisphere unless overt
armed aggression is apparent;
and if the Laotian precedent is to
be followed, not even then. In
short, "We must never negotiate
out of fear, but we must never
fear to negotiate” will be sup
planted by a new slogan: ‘‘We
must never run out of fear, but
we must never fear to run.”
Second, the Soviet maritime
base which is to be, built, osten
sibly to refuel fishing trawlers,
could service enough Russian
submarines and surface raiders
to cripple American shipping in
the south Atlantic in time of war;
a feat which would be unthink
able without such an advance
base of operation.
AND THIRD is the military
threat to Latin America. Since
revolution has surpassed tobacco
and sugar as Cuba’s principal ex
port, the greatest danger pre
sented by Mr. Castro is, in the
words of the liberal “Christian
Science Monitor,” the possibility
that "hemispheric unrest will
grow and that arms, saboteurs,
and revolutionary planners will
be tunneled through Cuba to fan
it.”
The danger is clear and pres
ent. American intelligence
sources have reported that sever
al thousand Ghanian troops are
now training in Cuba for this ex
pressed purpose. The govern
ments of Haiti, the Dominican
Republic, and Venezuela have re
peatedly protested that Cuban
agents have been fomenting revo
lution in their countries for some
months past. And the govern
ments of Colombia, Panama, Cos
ta Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala,
El Salvador, and Peru have ex
pressed grave concern over Cu
ban actions and have quietly in
formed Washington that they
would welcome an invasion of
Cuba by the United States.

formed him of the committee. He
approves of the idea, and indicat
ed that it might be possible to ob
tain UN assistance.
The committee has had a rather
auspicious beginning despite its
organizational infancy. It has not
been officially conceived as far
as the university is concerned
and it in no way implicates the
university or the ASSU at this
point.
It is an ad hoc group of inter
ested students who believe that
scholarships and loans are avail
able for these people and who are
determined to find them. For
those who are interested there
will be a meeting today at 4:30
p.m. in Tresidder Union.

Thus, if Cuban aggression is
the condition requisite for Amer
ican action, Mr. Kennedy has
abundant justification at this
time. But another moral consid
eration is germane. What of the
Cuban people’s right to self-de
termination?
THE VAST majority of the
Cuban people did not choose Cas
tro to oppress them; and, accord
ing to British sources, less than
20 per cent of them favor him at
this time. But their prospect of
overthrowing a communist dic
tatorship without American aid
is no more enviable than was that
of the Hungarians or Tibetans,
for Mr. Castro is held in power
by some 14,000 crack Russian and
Chinese troops, 250 Soviet-made
tanks, and a standing army
equipped with modern weapons.
It should, therefore, be obvious
to any observer that the Cuban
people will not be free and will
be further denied their right to
self-determination as long as the
President of the United States, in
the guise of morality, considers
any mention of liberating this en
slaved nation as “loose talk.”
The time has clearly come for
Mr. Kennedy to recall the actions
of his hero, Franklin D. Roose
velt, when the latter sent a cruis
er full of combat ready Marines
to Uruguay when pro-Nazi forces
attempted to establish a dictator
ship there. The time has come to
effect a final solution to the Cas
tro problem, via invasion; and by
so doing, allow the Cuban people
to govern themselves once again.

organizational infancy. It has not
been officially conceived as far
as the university is concerned
and it in no way implicates the
university or the ASSU at this
point.
It is an ad hoc group of inter
ested students who believe that
scholarships and loans are avail
able for these people and who are
determined to find them. For
those who are interested there
will be a meeting today at 4:30
p.m. in Tresidder Union.

Thus, if Cuban aggression is
the condition requisite for Amer
ican action, Mr. Kennedy has
abundant justification at this
time. But another moral consid
eration is germane. What of the
Cuban people’s right to self-de
termination?
THE VAST majority of the
Cuban people did not choose Cas
tro to oppress them; and, accord
ing to British sources, less than
20 per cent of them favor him at
this time. But their prospect of
overthrowing a communist dic
tatorship without American aid
is no more enviable than was that
of the Hungarians or Tibetans,
for Mr. Castro is held in power
by some 14,000 crack Russian and
Chinese troops, 250 Soviet-made
tanks, and a standing army
equipped with modern weapons.
It should, therefore, be obvious
to any observer that the Cuban
people will not be free and will
be further denied their right to
self-determination as long as the
President of the United States, in
the guise of morality, considers
any mention of liberating this en
slaved nation as “loose talk.”
The time has clearly come for
Mr. Kennedy to recall the actions
of his hero, Franklin D. Roose
velt, when the latter sent a cruis
er full of combat ready Marines
to Uruguay when pro-Nazi forces
attempted to establish a dictator
ship there. The time has come to
effect a final solution to the Cas
tro problem, via invasion; and by
so doing, allow the Cuban people
to govern themselves once again.
BUT SUCH action must be
taken immediately, for the num
ber of American and Cuban lives
which must be lost in such an un
dertaking increases with each
day’s procrastination. Mr. Castro
is entrenching himself. And, as
the President told Congressional
leaders of both parties last week,
the possibility of an existent or
nearly existent Cuban nuclear
striking force cannot be discount
ed. Castro now possesses Soviet
made missiles with ranges of up
to 1700 miles, which may be
fired from existing missile bases
and soon from 15 additional bases
which are now under construc
tion. His air force is equipped
with at least 57 MIG-57 jet fight
ers which may be armed with
tactical nuclear weapons; and
with as many as 200 MIG-200 jet
fighters, which are capable of
carrying nuclear weapons to any
city on the Atlantic seaboard.
In addition, veteran American
intelligence officers in Cuba have
informed the Pentagon of a
strange, secret cargo which was
unloaded at. the port of Casilda
on August 9; a cargo consisting
of large lead caskets similar to
those in which nuclear warheads
are shipped from one part of the
United States to another; caskets
which the forenamed authorities
believe contain either warheads
or gas-type shells which could im
part fearful damage to American
coastal cities. (Los Angeles
“Times,” September 20, 1962. p.
11-5.)
How, then, in other than elec
tion rhetoric, could Mr. Kennedy
contend that Cuba does not "con
stitute a serious threat to any
other part of this hemisphere”?
The hour is somewhat later than
he would lead the American peo
ple to believe.
The time has come for the
United States to stop evading re
ality: to stop imitating the pro
verbial ostrich, running hell-bent
for the nearest sand hill.
On September 13, in tones rem
iniscent of Neville Chamberlain,
Mr. Kennedy stated that recent
Soviet arms shipments to Cuba
“do not constitute a serious
threat to any part of this hemis
phere.” Such a myth can be main
tained only at risk of sacrificing
the liberty of Latin America and,
by that act, our own.
THE PRESIDENT has ignored
—or concealed—at least three
threats to the Free World which
the present and growing Soviet
arsenal in Cuba poses; not to
mention a moral consideration
which should be of at least pass
ing concern to any statesman
who reveres human liberty and
affirms each nation’s right to self
determination.
First, by allowing Soviet
Union to arm Cuba, construct
nine medium range missile bases
there, and build a major mari
time base upon the island, Mr.
Kennedy will have proclaimed to
the world that the United States
will not oppose communist occu
pancy of any nation in the West
ern Hemisphere unless overt
armed aggression is apparent;
and if the Laotian precedent is to
be followed, not even then. In
short, "We must never negotiate
out of fear, but we must never
fear to negotiate” will be sup
planted by a new slogan: ‘‘We
must never run out of fear, but
we must never fear to run.”
Second, the Soviet maritime
base which is to be, built, osten
sibly to refuel fishing trawlers,
could service enough Russian
submarines and surface raiders
to cripple American shipping in
the south Atlantic in time of war;
a feat which would be unthink
able without such an advance
base of operation.
AND THIRD is the military
threat to Latin America. Since
revolution has surpassed tobacco
and sugar as Cuba’s principal ex
port, the greatest danger pre
sented by Mr. Castro is, in the
words of the liberal “Christian
Science Monitor,” the possibility
that "hemispheric unrest will
grow and that arms, saboteurs,
and revolutionary planners will
be tunneled through Cuba to fan
it.”
The danger is clear and pres
ent. American intelligence
sources have reported that sever
al thousand Ghanian troops are
now training in Cuba for this ex
pressed purpose. The govern
ments of Haiti, the Dominican
Republic, and Venezuela have re
peatedly protested that Cuban
agents have been fomenting revo
lution in their countries for some
months past. And the govern
ments of Colombia, Panama, Cos
ta Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala,
El Salvador, and Peru have ex
pressed grave concern over Cu
ban actions and have quietly in
formed Washington that they
would welcome an invasion of
Cuba by the United States.

and if the Laotian precedent is to
be followed, not even then. In
short, "We must never negotiate
out of fear, but we must never
fear to negotiate” will be sup
planted by a new slogan: ‘‘We
must never run out of fear, but
we must never fear to run.”
Second, the Soviet maritime
base which is to be, built, osten
sibly to refuel fishing trawlers,
could service enough Russian
submarines and surface raiders
to cripple American shipping in
the south Atlantic in time of war;
a feat which would be unthink
able without such an advance
base of operation.
AND THIRD is the military
threat to Latin America. Since
revolution has surpassed tobacco
and sugar as Cuba’s principal ex
port, the greatest danger pre
sented by Mr. Castro is, in the
words of the liberal “Christian
Science Monitor,” the possibility
that "hemispheric unrest will
grow and that arms, saboteurs,
and revolutionary planners will
be tunneled through Cuba to fan
it.”
The danger is clear and pres
ent. American intelligence
sources have reported that sever
al thousand Ghanian troops are
now training in Cuba for this ex
pressed purpose. The govern
ments of Haiti, the Dominican
Republic, and Venezuela have re
peatedly protested that Cuban
agents have been fomenting revo
lution in their countries for some
months past. And the govern
ments of Colombia, Panama, Cos
ta Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala,
El Salvador, and Peru have ex
pressed grave concern over Cu
ban actions and have quietly in
formed Washington that they
would welcome an invasion of
Cuba by the United States.

formed him of the committee. He
approves of the idea, and indicat
ed that it might be possible to ob
tain UN assistance.
The committee has had a rather
auspicious beginning despite its
organizational infancy. It has not
been officially conceived as far
as the university is concerned
and it in no way implicates the
university or the ASSU at this
point.
It is an ad hoc group of inter
ested students who believe that
scholarships and loans are avail
able for these people and who are
determined to find them. For
those who are interested there
will be a meeting today at 4:30
p.m. in Tresidder Union.

Thus, if Cuban aggression is
the condition requisite for Amer
ican action, Mr. Kennedy has
abundant justification at this
time. But another moral consid
eration is germane. What of the
Cuban people’s right to self-de
termination?
THE VAST majority of the
Cuban people did not choose Cas
tro to oppress them; and, accord
ing to British sources, less than
20 per cent of them favor him at
this time. But their prospect of
overthrowing a communist dic
tatorship without American aid
is no more enviable than was that
of the Hungarians or Tibetans,
for Mr. Castro is held in power
by some 14,000 crack Russian and
Chinese troops, 250 Soviet-made
tanks, and a standing army
equipped with modern weapons.
It should, therefore, be obvious
to any observer that the Cuban
people will not be free and will
be further denied their right to
self-determination as long as the
President of the United States, in
the guise of morality, considers
any mention of liberating this en
slaved nation as “loose talk.”
The time has clearly come for
Mr. Kennedy to recall the actions
of his hero, Franklin D. Roose
velt, when the latter sent a cruis
er full of combat ready Marines
to Uruguay when pro-Nazi forces
attempted to establish a dictator
ship there. The time has come to
effect a final solution to the Cas
tro problem, via invasion; and by
so doing, allow the Cuban people
to govern themselves once again.
BUT SUCH action must be
taken immediately, for the num
ber of American and Cuban lives
which must be lost in such an un
dertaking increases with each
day’s procrastination. Mr. Castro
is entrenching himself. And, as
the President told Congressional
leaders of both parties last week,
the possibility of an existent or
nearly existent Cuban nuclear
striking force cannot be discount
ed. Castro now possesses Soviet
made missiles with ranges of up
to 1700 miles, which may be
fired from existing missile bases
and soon from 15 additional bases
which are now under construc
tion. His air force is equipped
with at least 57 MIG-57 jet fight
ers which may be armed with
tactical nuclear weapons; and
with as many as 200 MIG-200 jet
fighters, which are capable of
carrying nuclear weapons to any
city on the Atlantic seaboard.
In addition, veteran American
intelligence officers in Cuba have
informed the Pentagon of a
strange, secret cargo which was
unloaded at. the port of Casilda
on August 9; a cargo consisting
of large lead caskets similar to
those in which nuclear warheads
are shipped from one part of the
United States to another; caskets
which the forenamed authorities
believe contain either warheads
or gas-type shells which could im
part fearful damage to American
coastal cities. (Los Angeles
“Times,” September 20, 1962. p.
11-5.)
How, then, in other than elec
tion rhetoric, could Mr. Kennedy
contend that Cuba does not "con
stitute a serious threat to any
other part of this hemisphere”?
The hour is somewhat later than
he would lead the American peo
ple to believe.
The time has come for the
United States to stop evading re
ality: to stop imitating the pro
verbial ostrich, running hell-bent
for the nearest sand hill.
On September 13, in tones rem
iniscent of Neville Chamberlain,
Mr. Kennedy stated that recent
Soviet arms shipments to Cuba
“do not constitute a serious
threat to any part of this hemis
phere.” Such a myth can be main
tained only at risk of sacrificing
the liberty of Latin America and,
by that act, our own.
THE PRESIDENT has ignored
—or concealed—at least three
threats to the Free World which
the present and growing Soviet
arsenal in Cuba poses; not to
mention a moral consideration
which should be of at least pass
ing concern to any statesman
who reveres human liberty and
affirms each nation’s right to self
determination.
First, by allowing Soviet
Union to arm Cuba, construct
nine medium range missile bases
there, and build a major mari
time base upon the island, Mr.
Kennedy will have proclaimed to
the world that the United States
will not oppose communist occu
pancy of any nation in the West
ern Hemisphere unless overt
armed aggression is apparent;
and if the Laotian precedent is to
be followed, not even then. In
short, "We must never negotiate
out of fear, but we must never
fear to negotiate” will be sup
planted by a new slogan: ‘‘We
must never run out of fear, but
we must never fear to run.”
