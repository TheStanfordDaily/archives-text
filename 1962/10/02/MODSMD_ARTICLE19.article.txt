## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
If Friday night’s practice game
with San Jose State is any indi
cation, Stanford Soccer Coach
Fred Prlddle will get a lot of
mileage out of the 1962 version
of the Stanford soccer team. The
Indians looked impressive in easi
ly beating San Jose State 4-2.
The Cards lost to Balboa High
School 3-2 Saturday morning, but
the loss to the inspired high

school team can be explained by
the all-out effort the night before,
and the more 12 hours rest be
tween games.
Priddle was impressed with
three newcomers to the Indian
varsity and most all of the past
members of the squad.
Sophs Stu Rawlings, Kent
Mueller and Jim Armstrong were
singled out for praise. Rawlings
scored two goals and got a big
assist on another from his center
half position. Mueller did well as
goalie in his first varsity game.

Ho hold San Jose to one goal
from the field and one penalty
kick. Armstrong was a tenacious
defender from his halfback posi
tion.
Senior Sandy Pofahl and jun
iors Larry Chukvvedebe and A1
Nnoli also impressed. Fullback
Pofahl several times saved goals,
and guarded 9.4 sprinter Jim
Omagbemi closely. Chukwedebe
and Nnoli were the Stanford play
makers. time after time befud
dling Spartan backs with their

clever passing.
Rawlings opened the Stanford
scoring on a pass from Chuk
wedebe in the first quarter, but
SJS tied at 1-1 at the end of the
half.
Stanford went ahead to stay in
the third period, as Rawlings and
the Spartan goalie went for the
ball at the same time. The lanky
Stnford center flattened his man
and Nnoli put the ball into the
goal.
Stanford scored twice more in
the third. Rawlings knocked the
ball out of the sub-goalie’s hands
and scored, and Don Griffith per
fectly placed the ball into the
corner of the net out of the
goalie’s reach. A Spartan penally
kick closed out the scoring.
Stanford’s first league contest
will be Saturday against peren
nially rugged City College of San
Francisco on the CCSF field.
