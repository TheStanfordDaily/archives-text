# Renovation Plans for Front Quad Include New Math and Law Units
## 
### 
Stanford officials today an
nounced final approval of plans
to remodel two units of the front
Quad. One will provide a new
home for the fast-growing Mathe
matics Department, the other
more space for the crowded Law
School. Both are parts of Stan
ford’s current $lOO Million PACE

Program.
The Mathematics Department,
now operating in six separate lo
cations on the campus, will in
herit the Physics Building at the
northwest corner of the Quad
after Physics moves into the new
Russell H. Varian Laboratory late
this year.
A completely new structure of
five stories instead of the present
four will be built inside the exist
ing sandstone walls, at an esti
mated cost of more than $2 mil
lion. Mathematics then can be
consolidated under one roof, ex
cept for the Computation Center
in the Science Quad.
Large classrooms for lectures
will be on the ground floor. In
addition to other classrooms and
offices, the building will contain
a library and study rooms on the
■fourth floor with a small roof ter
race adjoining, a faculty-student
lounge on the second floor and a
faculty commons room on the
third. Quiet quarters for research
will be available. There will be a
landscaped rear courtyard.
