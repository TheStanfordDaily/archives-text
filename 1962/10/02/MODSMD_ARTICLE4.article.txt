# Elevator Plunges to Encina Basement in Unscheduled Stop
## 
### 
A faulty water line in a hy
draulic lift elevator in Encina
Hall burst yesterday afternoon
sending two persons hurtling one
and one-half storys to the bot
tom of the building.
A university spokesman identi
fied one occupant as Mrs, Mar
garet McWinney, of the Develop
ment office, who was reported to
have been suffering from shock
and bruises, she was taken to the
Health Service for examination
and later released. The other oc
cupant, Mike Walters, identified
as a member of Kappa Alpha and
also working in the I>evelopment
Office, was uninjured.
No information was available
at press time as to the cause of
the accident, but the elevator was
reported to have been “just
worked on.”
The explosion which precipitat
ed the fall was apparently audible
throughout the building, and one
witness said, “It sounded like a
sonic boom.”
Narrowly escaping the fall
were two other persons, identi
fied by Assistant Chief Frank
Junan as Jean Wallace, of the
Dean’s Office, and Richard
O’Brien, also from the Develop
ment Office, who left the cab on
the first floor the instant before
the line broke.
