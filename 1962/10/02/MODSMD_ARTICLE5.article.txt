# Historian Tells Auto's History: Stanley Steamer Had to Lose
## 
### NORMAN REITZ 
“It was bound to lose out,” said
Dr. Charles McLaughlin of the
History Department, referring to
the competition of the steam car
with the combustion and electric
vehicles. McLaughlin traced the
history of the Stanley Steamer
yesterday at the first session of
the Union coffee hour series.
He attributed the acceptance of
the combustion engine to mass
production methods. The steam
car companies, he said, “became
complacent with handicraft tech
niques.” They produced few
cars and sold to a select ten per
cent of the automobile market.
From 1905-1915 their competi
tors were perfecting assembly
line techniques and producing
more cars in a day than the Stan
ley brothers did in a year. Gas
driven cars, he said, became so
numerous that parts, and service
became readily accessible. They
were convenient to drive.
According to McLaughlin, a
series of crises predicated the
closing of the Stanley Steamer
shops; a shortage of steel during
World War I, fluctuations in the
economy, and an outbreak of hoof
and mouth disease. The epidemic
threatened only horses, but to
stop its spread watering troughs
were emptied, and both horses
and steamers went without water.
In connection with the talk,
two steamers were on display by
Dinkelspiel: a 1909 Stanley
Steamer and a 1925 Doble. Both
cars had been driven over one

hundred thousand miles, Mc-
Laughlin said. He lold the infor
mal group that the Stanley Racer,
an adaptation of the one on dis
play, could reach a speed of 127
m.p.h. in one mile.
“The gas buggy is here to stay
for the foreseeable future,” said
McLaughlin. But he speculated
that a steam sports car, “Driven
by those who crave individuality,”
might bo a possibility. It could
get ton miles to a gallon of kero
sene; it would run smoothly; and
it would go ninety m.p.h. in nine
seconds.

it would go ninety m.p.h. in nine
seconds.

THIS 1909 STANLEY STEAMER, a proud, “spanking old" beauty from the Turn of the Century, visited
the Campus yesterday.
“It was bound to lose out,” said
Dr. Charles McLaughlin of the
History Department, referring to
the competition of the steam car
with the combustion and electric
vehicles. McLaughlin traced the
history of the Stanley Steamer
yesterday at the first session of
the Union coffee hour series.
He attributed the acceptance of
the combustion engine to mass
production methods. The steam
car companies, he said, “became
complacent with handicraft tech
niques.” They produced few
cars and sold to a select ten per
cent of the automobile market.
From 1905-1915 their competi
tors were perfecting assembly
line techniques and producing
more cars in a day than the Stan
ley brothers did in a year. Gas
driven cars, he said, became so
numerous that parts, and service
became readily accessible. They
were convenient to drive.
According to McLaughlin, a
series of crises predicated the
closing of the Stanley Steamer
shops; a shortage of steel during
World War I, fluctuations in the
economy, and an outbreak of hoof
and mouth disease. The epidemic
threatened only horses, but to
stop its spread watering troughs
were emptied, and both horses
and steamers went without water.
In connection with the talk,
two steamers were on display by
Dinkelspiel: a 1909 Stanley
Steamer and a 1925 Doble. Both
cars had been driven over one

hundred thousand miles, Mc-
Laughlin said. He lold the infor
mal group that the Stanley Racer,
an adaptation of the one on dis
play, could reach a speed of 127
m.p.h. in one mile.
“The gas buggy is here to stay
for the foreseeable future,” said
McLaughlin. But he speculated
that a steam sports car, “Driven
by those who crave individuality,”
might bo a possibility. It could
get ton miles to a gallon of kero
sene; it would run smoothly; and
it would go ninety m.p.h. in nine
