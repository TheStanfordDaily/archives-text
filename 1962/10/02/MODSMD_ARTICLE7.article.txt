# Open Air Theater Built for Summer
## 
### SHEILA RICKETS 
“The Outer Circle,” an arena
theater located directly to the
east of Memorial Auditorium,
was erected last June. It will re
main standing until after Octo
ber 13, the final performance of
“La Parisiennc,” a French tri
angle comedy which is to be pre
sented in the theater.
The theater, which can seat an
audience of 200 around the cen
tral acting area, is open to the
elements but is protected by walls
around its sides.
"The walls are there to provide
protection against noise and
wind,” stated Paul Landry who
designed the theater and super
vised its construction.
It was erected so that the Con
temporary Theater Workshop, a
summer drama program which
was beginning its second summer
at Stanford, could present more
plays than would have been pos
sible with a proscenium stage.
"Because of the overwhelming
success of the theater w’hich was
sold out almost all summer, and
because almost none of the stu
dents who are here now were
here over the summer, one more
play is planned,” said Landry.
“La Parisienne” by Henri Bee
que, will be presented this Fri
day and Saturday and on Friday
and Saturday of next week, Oc
tober 12 and 13. Herb Kennedy,
June Cook, Stan Weese, Suzanne
Payne and Victor Emeljonaw
will be starred.
