# Potter Praises Kennedy Stand
## 
### RICK SEIFERT 
Dr. David M. Potter, Stanford
professor of American history,
today said the Kennedy adminis
tration had taken the only pos
sible stand in the University of
Mississippi integration crisis.
In Potter’s opinion, President
Kennedy’s speech of last Sunday
was a "very statesmanlike state
ment” that eloquently presented
the administration’s “inescapa
ble” responsibility.
POTTER, who once taught at
the University of Mississippi, said
“The Supreme Court in 1954 did
have a choice, and it can be de
bated whether the use of federal
authority is the best way to deal
with this kind of problem. In
light of this decision and follow
ing decisions, the President had
no choice as to the course of ac
tion to be taken.”
Looking to the future. Potter
said that the Mississippi crisis
would be “the last stand of total
resistance to school integration
by the South. The next problem
is the practice of token integra
tion.”
THE HISTORIAN was quick to
cite that ift the ten Southern
states mentioned by ihe President
as having desegregated their
schools, less than one per cent of
the Negro school children were
in the same institutions with
white children.
According to Potter, it is na
tural that “the last attempt at
all-out resistance” should occur in
Mississippi He said that this
state is “the most deeply tradi
tional of the Southern states.”
It has the largest proportional
rural population, it has the high
est percentage of negroes in its
population, it shares a Democrat
ic Party record matched by only
one or two other Southern states,
and it has been the least changed
by the industrial tendencies of
our times, he said.
WHEN ASKED about Republi
can chances for gaining votes
among the Southern whites as a
result of the crisis, Potter said
that Republicans cannot offer
the Southerner an alternative to
the position taken by the present
administration. In his opinion,
the Republican appeal in the
South will remain negligible.
Moreover, he said, any attempt
at augmenting the now sparse
Southern Republican votes would
be a politically inept move, be
cause “the Negro vote is now
more strategically situated than
that of the Southern white.”
Potter, who taught for eighteen
years at Yale, concluded by say
ing that “progress can be made
by desegregation in education,
but the whole problem is broad
er. It extends to the entire situa
tion of residential segregation
and occupational differentials in
both North and South. Until these
conditions have been successfully
confronted, desegregation in the
schools will not reach the root of
the problem.”

POTTER, who once taught at
the University of Mississippi, said
“The Supreme Court in 1954 did
have a choice, and it can be de
bated whether the use of federal
authority is the best way to deal
with this kind of problem. In
light of this decision and follow
ing decisions, the President had
no choice as to the course of ac
tion to be taken.”
Looking to the future. Potter
said that the Mississippi crisis
would be “the last stand of total
resistance to school integration
by the South. The next problem
is the practice of token integra
tion.”
THE HISTORIAN was quick to
cite that ift the ten Southern
states mentioned by ihe President
as having desegregated their
schools, less than one per cent of
the Negro school children were
in the same institutions with
white children.
According to Potter, it is na
tural that “the last attempt at
all-out resistance” should occur in
Mississippi He said that this
state is “the most deeply tradi
tional of the Southern states.”
It has the largest proportional
rural population, it has the high
est percentage of negroes in its
population, it shares a Democrat
ic Party record matched by only
one or two other Southern states,
and it has been the least changed
by the industrial tendencies of
our times, he said.
WHEN ASKED about Republi
can chances for gaining votes
among the Southern whites as a
result of the crisis, Potter said
that Republicans cannot offer
the Southerner an alternative to
the position taken by the present
administration. In his opinion,
the Republican appeal in the
South will remain negligible.
Moreover, he said, any attempt
at augmenting the now sparse
Southern Republican votes would
be a politically inept move, be
cause “the Negro vote is now
more strategically situated than
that of the Southern white.”
Potter, who taught for eighteen
years at Yale, concluded by say
ing that “progress can be made
by desegregation in education,
but the whole problem is broad
er. It extends to the entire situa
tion of residential segregation
and occupational differentials in
both North and South. Until these
conditions have been successfully
confronted, desegregation in the
schools will not reach the root of
the problem.”
Dr. David M. Potter, Stanford
professor of American history,
today said the Kennedy adminis
tration had taken the only pos
sible stand in the University of
Mississippi integration crisis.
In Potter’s opinion, President
Kennedy’s speech of last Sunday
was a "very statesmanlike state
ment” that eloquently presented
the administration’s “inescapa
ble” responsibility.
