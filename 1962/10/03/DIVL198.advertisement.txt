Once again, we make
mention of what has
become a true campus
classic—the Shetland
pullover sweater. And
the very best are ship
ped to knowing old
R/A by redoubtable
old Alan Paine of
Britain, who now has
added a new saddle
shoulder for even
greater comfort. Great
autumn colors, too,
such as charcoal, fjord
blue, pebble, and
olive mix. All yours,
at 14.95 each.
