WHAT TO WEAR TILL THE DOCTOR COMES
Now that you have enrolled and paid your fees and bought
your books and found your way around campus and learned to
hate your roommate, it is time to turn to the most important
aspect of college life. I refer, of course, to clothes.
What does Dame Fashion decree for the coming school year?
(Incidentally, Dame Fashion is not, as many people believe, a
fictitious character. She was a real Englishwoman who lived in
Elizabethan times and, indeed, England is forever in her debt.
During the invasion of the Spanish Armada, Dame Fashion—
not yet a Dame but a mere, unlettered country lass named
Moll Flanders—during the invasion, I say, of the Spanish
Armada, this dauntless girl stood on the white cliffs of Dover
and turned the tide of battle by rallying the drooping morale of
the British fleet with this stirring poem of her own compositions
Don’t he gutless,
Men of Britain,
Swing your cutlass,
We ain’t guitlin’.
Smash the Spanish,
Sink their boats,
Make ’em vanish,
Like a horse makes (Hits,
For Good Queen Bess,
Dear sirs, you gotta
Make a mess
Of that Armada,
You u’on’t fail!
Knock ’em flat!
Then we’ll drink ale
And stuff like that.

As a reward for these inspirational verses Queen Elizabeth
dubbed her a Dame, made her Poet Laureate, and gave her
the Western Hemisphere except Duluth. But this was not the
extent of Dame Fashion’s service to Queen and country. In
1589 she invented the laying hen, and she was awarded a life
time pass to Chavez Ravine. But she was not to end her days
in glory. In 1591, alas, she was arrested for overtime jousting
and imprisoned for thirty years in a butt of malmsey. This later
became known as Guy Fawkes Day.)
Rut I digress. Let us get back to campus fashions. Certain to
be the rage again this year is the cardigan (which, curiously
enough, was named after Lord Cardigan, who commanded the
English fleet against the Spanish Armada. The sweater is only
one product of this remarkable Briton’s imagination. He also
invented the glottal stop, the gerund, and the eyelid, without
which winking, as we know it today, would not be possible).
But I digress. The cardigan, I say, will he back, which is, I
believe, cause for rejoicing. Why? Because the cardigan has
nice big pockets in which to carry your Marlboro Cigarettes—
and that, good friends, is ample reason for celebration as all of
you will agree who have enjoyed Marlboro’s fine, comfortable,
mellow flavor and Marlboro’s filter. So why don’t you slip into
your cardigan and hie yourself to your tobacconist for some
good Marlboros? They come in soft pack or flip-top box. Cardi
gans come in pink for girls and blue for boys. ® 1902 m»»shuim.n
♦ ♦ *
Cardigans or pullovers — it’s a matter of taste ... And so is
Marlboro a matter of taste—the best taste that can possibly
he achieved by experienced growers and blenders—by sci
ence. diligence, and lender loving care. Try a pack.

the Western Hemisphere except Duluth. But this was not the
extent of Dame Fashion’s service to Queen and country. In
1589 she invented the laying hen, and she was awarded a life
time pass to Chavez Ravine. But she was not to end her days
in glory. In 1591, alas, she was arrested for overtime jousting
and imprisoned for thirty years in a butt of malmsey. This later
became known as Guy Fawkes Day.)
Rut I digress. Let us get back to campus fashions. Certain to
be the rage again this year is the cardigan (which, curiously
enough, was named after Lord Cardigan, who commanded the
English fleet against the Spanish Armada. The sweater is only
one product of this remarkable Briton’s imagination. He also
invented the glottal stop, the gerund, and the eyelid, without
which winking, as we know it today, would not be possible).
But I digress. The cardigan, I say, will he back, which is, I
believe, cause for rejoicing. Why? Because the cardigan has
nice big pockets in which to carry your Marlboro Cigarettes—
and that, good friends, is ample reason for celebration as all of
you will agree who have enjoyed Marlboro’s fine, comfortable,
mellow flavor and Marlboro’s filter. So why don’t you slip into
your cardigan and hie yourself to your tobacconist for some
good Marlboros? They come in soft pack or flip-top box. Cardi
gans come in pink for girls and blue for boys. ® 1902 m»»shuim.n

Cardigans or pullovers — it’s a matter of taste ... And so is
Marlboro a matter of taste—the best taste that can possibly
he achieved by experienced growers and blenders—by sci
ence. diligence, and lender loving care. Try a pack.

your books and found your way around campus and learned to
hate your roommate, it is time to turn to the most important
aspect of college life. I refer, of course, to clothes.

(Incidentally, Dame Fashion is not, as many people believe, a
fictitious character. She was a real Englishwoman who lived in
Elizabethan times and, indeed, England is forever in her debt.
During the invasion of the Spanish Armada, Dame Fashion—
not yet a Dame but a mere, unlettered country lass named
Moll Flanders—during the invasion, I say, of the Spanish
Armada, this dauntless girl stood on the white cliffs of Dover
and turned the tide of battle by rallying the drooping morale of
the British fleet with this stirring poem of her own compositions
Don’t he gutless,
Men of Britain,
Swing your cutlass,
We ain’t guitlin’.
Smash the Spanish,
Sink their boats,
Make ’em vanish,
Like a horse makes (Hits,
For Good Queen Bess,
Dear sirs, you gotta
Make a mess
Of that Armada,
You u’on’t fail!
Knock ’em flat!
