## Meredith Ends Second Day But Marshals, Troops Stay 
### 
United Press International
OXFORD, Miss Federal marshals, backed by 15,000 troops,
saw Negro James Meredith safely through his second day of classes
yesterday, but many students were absent and the University of
Mississippi appeared to be but a shell of its former self.
Armed sentries stood guard on each of the buildings Meredith
entered, and Army patrols made periodic sweeps of the campus, still
littered with tear gas shells and other debris from Sunday night’s
riot.
Meredith is reported to be lonely but he left no doubt that he is
determined to remain. “If this stops me,” he said, “then it is no dif
ferent from a legal block. At this point it is more for America than
it is for me. I absolutely intend on seeing that every citizen is given
a right to be something if he works hard enough,” the 29-year-old
war veteran said.
To reporters who asked him if he felt any sense of guilt about
the deaths and demonstrations here, he replied: “I am very sorry
anyone had to get hurt or killed ... but I believe that’s an unfair
question to ask me.”
Meanwhile Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett appeared relieved, but
refused to comment yesterday on the U.S. sth Circuit Court of Ap
peals’ decision to postpone action on contempt proceedings pending
against him. Barnett went to his office after the court’s decision and
secluded himself with advisors as he has done after each new devel
opment in teh Mississippi integration situation since federal troops
arrived in the state Sunday.
A federal appeals court yesterday delayed until Oct. 12 a ruling
on whether it should implement an order providing for the fine and
arrest of Gov. Ross Barnett in connection with the Meredith case.

his part in the University of Mississippi integration crisis, have told
the former general to give prison officials and doctors “only name,
rank and serial number such as any American soldier would do if
captured by the enemy.” Walker was arrested Monday in Oxford,
Miss., and charged with “rebellion, insurrection and seditious con
spiracy. He was flown to the hospital-prison here Monday night.
