# Rushing

### 
Over the past couple of years dissatisfaction with the present
rushing system has grown widespread among many students.
Over these same years, however, nothing has been done to alter
the system. Judging from the interest of Wilbur, Stern, eating club,
and fraternity representatives, we may expect to see this year an
improved program recommended to the various living groups.
To recite the characteristics of the present system is to cata
logue its faults. Rush Week programs are, for instance, a serious
financial burden to the living groups that must undertake to en
tertain freshmen for an entire week in April. The money spent on
rushing by an individual fraternity has to be raised through
pledge dues or assessment of members. The present rushing sys
tem is, and need not be, expensive.
The faculty object to Rush Week for academic reasons: the
first week of spring quarter is a total academic loss, and the after
effects extend into Dead Week. Rush Week could be toned down,
and contact might be spread over a longer period of lime without
devoting a week to the total commitment of rush.
Few individuals who have gone through Rush Week will claim
the process to he thorough or the result universally satisfactory.
The haste, superficiality, and pressure of Rush Week are recog
nized by everyone concerned. These ills can be alleviated by a
new rushing system that places less emphasis on Rush Week and
places greater emphasis on more informal and less artificial con
tact between upperclassmen and freshmen.
Fast year there was some interest in the idea of a Rush Week
coming either at the end of spring quarter in the freshman year
or at the start of autumn quarter before the sophomore year. This
idea was attractive chiefly to sponsors who wanted to prevent the
freshman house system from disintegrating in spring quarter. Be
cause of housing problems and possible interference with summer
jobs, the idea seems impractical and undesirable. Regardless of
the merits of pre-sophomore rush, alternatives to the present sys
tem exist and will evidently be investigated with care this fall. If
the IFC, ICC, Wilbur, and Stern representatives can work with
dispatch, an improved rushing system might be instituted this
year.

To receive the approval of the four residence groups, the new
program will have to embody the principle of a living groupâ€™s
right to select its own members. This principle can he maintained
under a variety of rush systems which could still eliminate the
most undesirable features of Rush Week. A longer period of asso
ciation between freshmen and upperclassmen would reduce the
pressure of rush and allow for a more valid social experience.
