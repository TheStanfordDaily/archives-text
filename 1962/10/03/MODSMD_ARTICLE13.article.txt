Editor, The Daily:
I thought that you might be in
terested to know of the Stanford
ites-at-Harvard Club, 1962-63 edi
tion. There are twenty-three for
mer Stanford students in the first
year Law School class alone. In
addition, there are several in the
business school, at Fletcher
School of Diplomacy, in the grad
uate departments of music, phys
ics, etc.

As a result of last Saturday’s
great victory over Michigan
State, we have banded together
to give the old alma mater a voice
in the Cambridge area.
Bob Sayler was unanimously,
and unknowingly, elected perma
nent president of the club. He
was at a loss as to what his new
duties were to be until Bill Kar
tozian gave him some tips. (You
doubtlessly remember Karto
zian.)

Under Bob's steady (sobered
by his recent marriage) hand,
our brave little band will view
the Big Game on closed circuit
television (thanks to a friendly
grad student at M.1.T.) and will
conduct a combination Christ
mas/Rose Bowl party in Decem
ber.

In closing, may I offer a word
of guidance to the man who plans
for future Stanford football
games. This reporter (I suppose
that's the language of the trade),
went to Harvard’s first football
game and was horrified to think
of the physical beating that last

year’s Ivy League champs would
take in even the most hypotheti
cal encounter with the Stanford
line.
To make matters worse, the
Harvard band kept chanting.
“Repel them, repel them; make
them relinquish the ball”!

As sponsors in Branner Hall,
we would like to extend our
thanks for a job well done to the
1962 Pre-Registration Committee,
and to Randy Devening, its chair
man. Pre-Reg is a busy, confusing
week, which, if not organized well
and run efficiently can become
chaotic and meaningless. This
year’s Pre-Reg Committee was
invaluable in its efficiency and
help, both to the freshmen and
to their sponsors.
From the Freshmen, we have
heard nothing but compliments
for the program and organization
of Pre-Reg week. Contrary to
campus cynics, we believe that
Pre-Reg serves a valuable pur
pose for the incoming freshmen.
In order to fulfill this purpose,
there must be many interested,
hard-working students behind the
Pre-Reg program. This the Pre-
Reg Committee supplied, and
their success in doing a difficult
job well should be recognized and
commended by the Stanford Stu
dent Body as a whole.

thanks for a job well done to the
1962 Pre-Registration Committee,
and to Randy Devening, its chair
man. Pre-Reg is a busy, confusing
week, which, if not organized well
and run efficiently can become
chaotic and meaningless. This
year’s Pre-Reg Committee was
invaluable in its efficiency and
help, both to the freshmen and
to their sponsors.
From the Freshmen, we have
heard nothing but compliments
for the program and organization
of Pre-Reg week. Contrary to
campus cynics, we believe that
Pre-Reg serves a valuable pur
pose for the incoming freshmen.
In order to fulfill this purpose,
there must be many interested,
hard-working students behind the
Pre-Reg program. This the Pre-
Reg Committee supplied, and
their success in doing a difficult
job well should be recognized and
commended by the Stanford Stu
dent Body as a whole.

I thought that you might be in
terested to know of the Stanford
ites-at-Harvard Club, 1962-63 edi
tion. There are twenty-three for
mer Stanford students in the first
year Law School class alone. In
addition, there are several in the
business school, at Fletcher
School of Diplomacy, in the grad
uate departments of music, phys
ics, etc.

As a result of last Saturday’s
great victory over Michigan
State, we have banded together
to give the old alma mater a voice
in the Cambridge area.
Bob Sayler was unanimously,
and unknowingly, elected perma
nent president of the club. He
was at a loss as to what his new
duties were to be until Bill Kar
tozian gave him some tips. (You
doubtlessly remember Karto
zian.)

Under Bob's steady (sobered
by his recent marriage) hand,
our brave little band will view
the Big Game on closed circuit
television (thanks to a friendly
grad student at M.1.T.) and will
conduct a combination Christ
mas/Rose Bowl party in Decem
ber.

In closing, may I offer a word
of guidance to the man who plans
for future Stanford football
games. This reporter (I suppose
that's the language of the trade),
went to Harvard’s first football
game and was horrified to think
of the physical beating that last

year’s Ivy League champs would
take in even the most hypotheti
cal encounter with the Stanford
line.
To make matters worse, the
Harvard band kept chanting.
“Repel them, repel them; make
them relinquish the ball”!
