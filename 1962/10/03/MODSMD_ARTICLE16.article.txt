## House Sabotaging U.S. Policy Toward Tito, Gomulka Regimes 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Although our attention is fixed on Mississippi and although it
is a long way to Yugoslavia and Poland, these are critical days for
the cold war in Eastern Europe. The trade bill, on the whole so
excellent, is being reported out of the conference of the House and
Senate, and in its present form it contains a provision, inserted by
the House against the will of the Senate, which would damaee se

verely United States policy in*
Eastern Europe.
This policy was initiated by
Truman and Acheson, elaborated
by Eisenhower and Dulles, and
carried on by Kennedy and Rusk.
It offers material advantages to
Communist countries which try
to achieve national independence
from the domination of the Soviet
Union. The trade bill as it now
stands would wreck this policy.
On a crucial point the House has
prevailed over the Senate.
THE DIFFERENCE between
the two versions turns on what
is known as the “most-favored
nation”—for short the MEN—
clause in trade agreements. MEN
means that if a government
grants tariff privileges to an
other, it must do the same for
countries with which it has trea

i ties containing
I the most-favor-
I ed-nation clause.
I Thus, insofar as
I this country has
I lowered its tar
| iffs under the
I Reciprocal Trade
j Act, it has grant
[ ed to all nations
| with which it
[ has MFN agree

ments the same concessions.
Moreover, if the President acts
under the trade bill to negotiate
lower tariffs with the Common
Market, we must grant the same
lower duties to any other country
with which we have an MFN
agreement.
With Yugoslavia since it was
created after World War I, our
trade relations have been govern
ed by the 1891 Treaty of Friend
ship, Commerce, and Navigation
with the old kingdom of Serbia.
It contains an MFN clause. As an
act of policy we have, since De
cember 1960, granted this treat
ment to Poland, with which there
is no treaty.
Now in the trade bill as it
passed the Senate, the MFN
treatment would be denied to any
“country or area dominated or
controlled by the foreign govern
ment or foreign organization
controlling the world Communist
movement.” This is identical with
existing law. For some 13 years
under three Presidents, the offi
cial American judgment has been
that, although Yugoslavia is
ruled by Communists, in a very
considerable degree Yugoslavia
is an independent national state
and in critical matters is not
ruled by Moscow. About Poland,
our feeling has been that it is
struggling rather effectively to
achieve increasing national in
dependence. Thus under the Sen
ate version Yugoslavia and Po
land would continue to be eligible
for MFN tariff treatment.
BUT IN the House version,
which prevailed in the conference,
the test is not national independ
ence but ideological belief. Thus
MFN treatment must be denied
to “any country or area domi
nated or controlled by Commu
nism.” If this test prevails in the
final bill, the President will have
to deny MFN treatment “as soon
as practicable” to Poland and
Yugoslavia.
What will be the practical ef
fect? The economic impact will
be much greater on Yugoslavia—
which does 70 per cent of its for
eign trade with the Western
countries—than on Poland which
does only about 40 per cent of its
trade with the West. The act of
slamming the door in their faces
will be demoralizing to the young
er generation everywhere in
Eastern Europe who look increas
ingly towards the West. The sym
bolic importance probably out-

weighs the material effect.
Because Yugoslavia has re
ceived MFN treatment for so long
a time, it has built up a foreign
trade dependent on the tariff ben
efits, which give it a great ad
vantage as against its Communist
neighbors and parity with its
competitors in the non-Commu
nist world. If the trade bill pre
vails as it now stands, the tariff
duties on about 90 per cent of the
goods imported into the United
States from Yugoslavia will be
raised to the level of the Smoot-
Hawley Tariff of 1930. They are
between two and three times
higher than the rates which now
prevail. Yugoslavia will then face
the same U.S. tariff as does the
Soviet Union, Hungary, Ulbricht’s
East Germany, and Stalinist
Czechoslovakia.
AS FOR Poland, the material
effect will be less catastrophic.
Taking the 1961 figures, out of a
total of $41.2 million worth of
United States imports from Po
land. there will be no increase on
about 80 per cent. This is mainly
because so large a part of the
imports are canned meat on
which we have made no tariff
concessions to any country. For
the rest, Poland has enjoyed MFN
treatment only since December
1960 and has not had time to de
velop much trade accordingly
The fact that Yugoslavia has
such a preponderant relationship
with the non-Communist world
has had enormous bearing on the
cold war in Southern and Eastern
Europe. Ideologically, the Yugo
slav officials are Communists.
But they are Yugoslav Commu
nists and not Muscovite Commu
nists. So on matters that do not
affect Yugoslav national interests
they generally follow the Soviet
line. But when their national in
terests are involved, they act in
dependently.
Thus. Yugoslavia is not a mem
ber of the Warsaw military pact.
What is more, because we have
had the good sense to equip the
Yugoslav Air Force, the United
States and not the Soviet Union
is the supplier of the spare parts
and replacements. It is asinine
to call this assistance to Commu
nism. We have in fact achieved
the same kind of penetration of
the Communist world as Moscow
has done in our world in Cuba.
THOUGH Tito is ideologically'
aligned against us, strategically
and in the ultimate political
sense he is aligned with us. When
he broke with Moscow in 1948, he
closed his frontier to the Commu
nist guerrillas who were waging
civil war in Greece. He made a
satisfactory settlement with Italy
in Trieste. And he worked out
good arrangements with his
neighbor Austria. In that part of
Europe of which Yugoslavia is
the keystone, the imperial expan
sion of the Soviet Union is not
only contained, but is in fact roll
ed back.
The Senate understood this. The
House, which did not understand
it, has sabotaged a highly suc
cessful national policy. If the
mischief cannot be undone, this
country will in a fit of imbecility
have wounded itself. It will have
thrown away one of our most ef
fective weapons in the cold war
and it will have adopted a weapon
which is designed to backfire.
For we shall be saying to the
Yugoslavs and the Poles and to
others who may have yearnings
for freedom that they have no fu
ture with the West and (hat they
had better come to terms with
Moscow.

does only about 40 per cent of its
trade with the West. The act of
slamming the door in their faces
will be demoralizing to the young
er generation everywhere in
Eastern Europe who look increas
ingly towards the West. The sym
bolic importance probably out-

weighs the material effect.
Because Yugoslavia has re
ceived MFN treatment for so long
a time, it has built up a foreign
trade dependent on the tariff ben
efits, which give it a great ad
vantage as against its Communist
neighbors and parity with its
competitors in the non-Commu
nist world. If the trade bill pre
vails as it now stands, the tariff
duties on about 90 per cent of the
goods imported into the United
States from Yugoslavia will be
raised to the level of the Smoot-
Hawley Tariff of 1930. They are
between two and three times
higher than the rates which now
prevail. Yugoslavia will then face
the same U.S. tariff as does the
Soviet Union, Hungary, Ulbricht’s
East Germany, and Stalinist
Czechoslovakia.
AS FOR Poland, the material
effect will be less catastrophic.
Taking the 1961 figures, out of a
total of $41.2 million worth of
United States imports from Po
land. there will be no increase on
about 80 per cent. This is mainly
because so large a part of the
imports are canned meat on
which we have made no tariff
concessions to any country. For
the rest, Poland has enjoyed MFN
treatment only since December
1960 and has not had time to de
velop much trade accordingly
The fact that Yugoslavia has
such a preponderant relationship
with the non-Communist world
has had enormous bearing on the
cold war in Southern and Eastern
Europe. Ideologically, the Yugo
slav officials are Communists.
But they are Yugoslav Commu
nists and not Muscovite Commu
nists. So on matters that do not
affect Yugoslav national interests
they generally follow the Soviet
line. But when their national in
terests are involved, they act in
dependently.
Thus. Yugoslavia is not a mem
ber of the Warsaw military pact.
What is more, because we have
had the good sense to equip the
Yugoslav Air Force, the United
States and not the Soviet Union
is the supplier of the spare parts
and replacements. It is asinine
to call this assistance to Commu
nism. We have in fact achieved
the same kind of penetration of
the Communist world as Moscow
has done in our world in Cuba.
THOUGH Tito is ideologically'
aligned against us, strategically
and in the ultimate political
sense he is aligned with us. When
he broke with Moscow in 1948, he
closed his frontier to the Commu
nist guerrillas who were waging
civil war in Greece. He made a
satisfactory settlement with Italy
in Trieste. And he worked out
good arrangements with his
neighbor Austria. In that part of
Europe of which Yugoslavia is
the keystone, the imperial expan
sion of the Soviet Union is not
only contained, but is in fact roll
ed back.
The Senate understood this. The
House, which did not understand
it, has sabotaged a highly suc
cessful national policy. If the
mischief cannot be undone, this
country will in a fit of imbecility
have wounded itself. It will have
thrown away one of our most ef
fective weapons in the cold war
and it will have adopted a weapon
which is designed to backfire.
For we shall be saying to the
Yugoslavs and the Poles and to
others who may have yearnings
for freedom that they have no fu
ture with the West and (hat they
had better come to terms with
Moscow.

Although our attention is fixed on Mississippi and although it
is a long way to Yugoslavia and Poland, these are critical days for
the cold war in Eastern Europe. The trade bill, on the whole so
excellent, is being reported out of the conference of the House and
Senate, and in its present form it contains a provision, inserted by
the House against the will of the Senate, which would damaee se

verely United States policy in*
Eastern Europe.
This policy was initiated by
Truman and Acheson, elaborated
by Eisenhower and Dulles, and
carried on by Kennedy and Rusk.
It offers material advantages to
Communist countries which try
to achieve national independence
from the domination of the Soviet
Union. The trade bill as it now
stands would wreck this policy.
On a crucial point the House has
prevailed over the Senate.
THE DIFFERENCE between
the two versions turns on what
is known as the “most-favored
nation”—for short the MEN—
clause in trade agreements. MEN
means that if a government
grants tariff privileges to an
other, it must do the same for
countries with which it has trea

i ties containing
I the most-favor-
I ed-nation clause.
I Thus, insofar as
I this country has
I lowered its tar
| iffs under the
I Reciprocal Trade
j Act, it has grant
[ ed to all nations
| with which it
[ has MFN agree

ments the same concessions.
Moreover, if the President acts
under the trade bill to negotiate
lower tariffs with the Common
Market, we must grant the same
lower duties to any other country
with which we have an MFN
agreement.
With Yugoslavia since it was
created after World War I, our
trade relations have been govern
ed by the 1891 Treaty of Friend
ship, Commerce, and Navigation
with the old kingdom of Serbia.
It contains an MFN clause. As an
act of policy we have, since De
cember 1960, granted this treat
ment to Poland, with which there
is no treaty.
Now in the trade bill as it
passed the Senate, the MFN
treatment would be denied to any
“country or area dominated or
controlled by the foreign govern
ment or foreign organization
controlling the world Communist
movement.” This is identical with
existing law. For some 13 years
under three Presidents, the offi
cial American judgment has been
that, although Yugoslavia is
ruled by Communists, in a very
considerable degree Yugoslavia
is an independent national state
and in critical matters is not
ruled by Moscow. About Poland,
our feeling has been that it is
struggling rather effectively to
achieve increasing national in
dependence. Thus under the Sen
ate version Yugoslavia and Po
land would continue to be eligible
for MFN tariff treatment.
BUT IN the House version,
which prevailed in the conference,
the test is not national independ
ence but ideological belief. Thus
MFN treatment must be denied
to “any country or area domi
nated or controlled by Commu
nism.” If this test prevails in the
final bill, the President will have
to deny MFN treatment “as soon
as practicable” to Poland and
Yugoslavia.
What will be the practical ef
fect? The economic impact will
be much greater on Yugoslavia—
which does 70 per cent of its for
eign trade with the Western
countries—than on Poland which
does only about 40 per cent of its
trade with the West. The act of

Although our attention is fixed on Mississippi and although it
is a long way to Yugoslavia and Poland, these are critical days for
the cold war in Eastern Europe. The trade bill, on the whole so
excellent, is being reported out of the conference of the House and
Senate, and in its present form it contains a provision, inserted by
the House against the will of the Senate, which would damaee se

verely United States policy in*
Eastern Europe.
This policy was initiated by
Truman and Acheson, elaborated
by Eisenhower and Dulles, and
carried on by Kennedy and Rusk.
It offers material advantages to
Communist countries which try
to achieve national independence
from the domination of the Soviet
Union. The trade bill as it now
stands would wreck this policy.
On a crucial point the House has
prevailed over the Senate.
THE DIFFERENCE between
the two versions turns on what
is known as the “most-favored
nation”—for short the MEN—
clause in trade agreements. MEN
means that if a government
grants tariff privileges to an
other, it must do the same for
countries with which it has trea

i ties containing
I the most-favor-
I ed-nation clause.
I Thus, insofar as
I this country has
I lowered its tar
| iffs under the
I Reciprocal Trade
j Act, it has grant
[ ed to all nations
| with which it
[ has MFN agree

ments the same concessions.
Moreover, if the President acts
under the trade bill to negotiate
lower tariffs with the Common
Market, we must grant the same
lower duties to any other country
with which we have an MFN
agreement.
With Yugoslavia since it was
created after World War I, our
trade relations have been govern
ed by the 1891 Treaty of Friend
ship, Commerce, and Navigation
with the old kingdom of Serbia.
It contains an MFN clause. As an
act of policy we have, since De
cember 1960, granted this treat
ment to Poland, with which there
is no treaty.
Now in the trade bill as it
passed the Senate, the MFN
treatment would be denied to any
“country or area dominated or
controlled by the foreign govern
ment or foreign organization
controlling the world Communist
movement.” This is identical with
existing law. For some 13 years
under three Presidents, the offi
cial American judgment has been
that, although Yugoslavia is
ruled by Communists, in a very
considerable degree Yugoslavia
is an independent national state
and in critical matters is not
ruled by Moscow. About Poland,
our feeling has been that it is
struggling rather effectively to
achieve increasing national in
dependence. Thus under the Sen
ate version Yugoslavia and Po
land would continue to be eligible
for MFN tariff treatment.
BUT IN the House version,
which prevailed in the conference,
the test is not national independ
ence but ideological belief. Thus
MFN treatment must be denied
to “any country or area domi
nated or controlled by Commu
nism.” If this test prevails in the
final bill, the President will have
to deny MFN treatment “as soon
as practicable” to Poland and
Yugoslavia.
What will be the practical ef
fect? The economic impact will
be much greater on Yugoslavia—
which does 70 per cent of its for
eign trade with the Western
countries—than on Poland which
does only about 40 per cent of its
trade with the West. The act of
slamming the door in their faces
will be demoralizing to the young
er generation everywhere in
Eastern Europe who look increas
ingly towards the West. The sym
bolic importance probably out-

weighs the material effect.
Because Yugoslavia has re
ceived MFN treatment for so long
a time, it has built up a foreign
trade dependent on the tariff ben
efits, which give it a great ad
vantage as against its Communist
neighbors and parity with its
competitors in the non-Commu
nist world. If the trade bill pre
vails as it now stands, the tariff
duties on about 90 per cent of the
goods imported into the United
States from Yugoslavia will be
raised to the level of the Smoot-
Hawley Tariff of 1930. They are
between two and three times
higher than the rates which now
prevail. Yugoslavia will then face
the same U.S. tariff as does the
Soviet Union, Hungary, Ulbricht’s
East Germany, and Stalinist
Czechoslovakia.
AS FOR Poland, the material
effect will be less catastrophic.
Taking the 1961 figures, out of a
total of $41.2 million worth of
United States imports from Po
land. there will be no increase on
about 80 per cent. This is mainly
because so large a part of the
imports are canned meat on
which we have made no tariff
concessions to any country. For
the rest, Poland has enjoyed MFN
treatment only since December
1960 and has not had time to de
velop much trade accordingly
The fact that Yugoslavia has
such a preponderant relationship
with the non-Communist world
has had enormous bearing on the
cold war in Southern and Eastern
Europe. Ideologically, the Yugo
slav officials are Communists.
But they are Yugoslav Commu
nists and not Muscovite Commu
nists. So on matters that do not
affect Yugoslav national interests
they generally follow the Soviet
line. But when their national in
terests are involved, they act in
dependently.
Thus. Yugoslavia is not a mem
ber of the Warsaw military pact.
What is more, because we have
had the good sense to equip the
Yugoslav Air Force, the United
States and not the Soviet Union
is the supplier of the spare parts
and replacements. It is asinine
to call this assistance to Commu
nism. We have in fact achieved
the same kind of penetration of
the Communist world as Moscow
has done in our world in Cuba.
THOUGH Tito is ideologically'
aligned against us, strategically
and in the ultimate political
sense he is aligned with us. When
he broke with Moscow in 1948, he
closed his frontier to the Commu
nist guerrillas who were waging
civil war in Greece. He made a
satisfactory settlement with Italy
in Trieste. And he worked out
good arrangements with his
neighbor Austria. In that part of
Europe of which Yugoslavia is
the keystone, the imperial expan
sion of the Soviet Union is not
only contained, but is in fact roll
ed back.
The Senate understood this. The
House, which did not understand
it, has sabotaged a highly suc
cessful national policy. If the
mischief cannot be undone, this
country will in a fit of imbecility
have wounded itself. It will have
thrown away one of our most ef
fective weapons in the cold war
and it will have adopted a weapon
which is designed to backfire.
For we shall be saying to the
Yugoslavs and the Poles and to
others who may have yearnings

to deny MFN treatment “as soon
as practicable” to Poland and
Yugoslavia.
What will be the practical ef
fect? The economic impact will
be much greater on Yugoslavia—
which does 70 per cent of its for
eign trade with the Western
countries—than on Poland which
does only about 40 per cent of its
trade with the West. The act of
slamming the door in their faces
will be demoralizing to the young
er generation everywhere in
Eastern Europe who look increas
ingly towards the West. The sym
bolic importance probably out-

weighs the material effect.
Because Yugoslavia has re
ceived MFN treatment for so long
a time, it has built up a foreign
trade dependent on the tariff ben
efits, which give it a great ad
vantage as against its Communist
neighbors and parity with its
competitors in the non-Commu
nist world. If the trade bill pre
vails as it now stands, the tariff
duties on about 90 per cent of the
goods imported into the United
States from Yugoslavia will be
raised to the level of the Smoot-
Hawley Tariff of 1930. They are
between two and three times
higher than the rates which now
prevail. Yugoslavia will then face
the same U.S. tariff as does the
Soviet Union, Hungary, Ulbricht’s
East Germany, and Stalinist
Czechoslovakia.
AS FOR Poland, the material
effect will be less catastrophic.
Taking the 1961 figures, out of a
total of $41.2 million worth of
United States imports from Po
land. there will be no increase on
about 80 per cent. This is mainly
because so large a part of the
imports are canned meat on
which we have made no tariff
concessions to any country. For
the rest, Poland has enjoyed MFN
treatment only since December
1960 and has not had time to de
velop much trade accordingly
The fact that Yugoslavia has
such a preponderant relationship
with the non-Communist world
has had enormous bearing on the
cold war in Southern and Eastern
Europe. Ideologically, the Yugo
slav officials are Communists.
But they are Yugoslav Commu
nists and not Muscovite Commu
nists. So on matters that do not
affect Yugoslav national interests
they generally follow the Soviet
line. But when their national in
terests are involved, they act in
dependently.
Thus. Yugoslavia is not a mem
ber of the Warsaw military pact.
What is more, because we have
had the good sense to equip the
Yugoslav Air Force, the United
States and not the Soviet Union
is the supplier of the spare parts
and replacements. It is asinine
to call this assistance to Commu
nism. We have in fact achieved
the same kind of penetration of
the Communist world as Moscow
has done in our world in Cuba.
THOUGH Tito is ideologically'
aligned against us, strategically
and in the ultimate political
sense he is aligned with us. When
he broke with Moscow in 1948, he
closed his frontier to the Commu
nist guerrillas who were waging
civil war in Greece. He made a
satisfactory settlement with Italy
in Trieste. And he worked out
good arrangements with his
neighbor Austria. In that part of
Europe of which Yugoslavia is
the keystone, the imperial expan
sion of the Soviet Union is not
only contained, but is in fact roll
ed back.
The Senate understood this. The
House, which did not understand
it, has sabotaged a highly suc
cessful national policy. If the
mischief cannot be undone, this
country will in a fit of imbecility
have wounded itself. It will have
thrown away one of our most ef
fective weapons in the cold war
and it will have adopted a weapon
which is designed to backfire.
For we shall be saying to the
Yugoslavs and the Poles and to
others who may have yearnings
for freedom that they have no fu
ture with the West and (hat they
had better come to terms with
Moscow.

Although our attention is fixed on Mississippi and although it
is a long way to Yugoslavia and Poland, these are critical days for
the cold war in Eastern Europe. The trade bill, on the whole so
excellent, is being reported out of the conference of the House and
Senate, and in its present form it contains a provision, inserted by
the House against the will of the Senate, which would damaee se

verely United States policy in*
Eastern Europe.
This policy was initiated by
Truman and Acheson, elaborated
by Eisenhower and Dulles, and
carried on by Kennedy and Rusk.
It offers material advantages to
Communist countries which try
to achieve national independence
from the domination of the Soviet
Union. The trade bill as it now
stands would wreck this policy.
On a crucial point the House has
prevailed over the Senate.
THE DIFFERENCE between
the two versions turns on what
is known as the “most-favored
nation”—for short the MEN—
clause in trade agreements. MEN
means that if a government
grants tariff privileges to an
other, it must do the same for
countries with which it has trea

i ties containing
I the most-favor-
I ed-nation clause.
I Thus, insofar as
I this country has
I lowered its tar
| iffs under the
I Reciprocal Trade
j Act, it has grant
[ ed to all nations
| with which it
[ has MFN agree

ments the same concessions.
Moreover, if the President acts
under the trade bill to negotiate
lower tariffs with the Common
Market, we must grant the same
lower duties to any other country
with which we have an MFN
agreement.
With Yugoslavia since it was
created after World War I, our
trade relations have been govern
ed by the 1891 Treaty of Friend
ship, Commerce, and Navigation
with the old kingdom of Serbia.
It contains an MFN clause. As an
act of policy we have, since De
cember 1960, granted this treat
ment to Poland, with which there
is no treaty.
Now in the trade bill as it
passed the Senate, the MFN
treatment would be denied to any
“country or area dominated or
controlled by the foreign govern
ment or foreign organization
controlling the world Communist
movement.” This is identical with
existing law. For some 13 years
under three Presidents, the offi
cial American judgment has been
that, although Yugoslavia is
ruled by Communists, in a very
considerable degree Yugoslavia
is an independent national state
and in critical matters is not
ruled by Moscow. About Poland,
our feeling has been that it is
struggling rather effectively to
achieve increasing national in
dependence. Thus under the Sen
ate version Yugoslavia and Po
land would continue to be eligible
for MFN tariff treatment.
BUT IN the House version,
which prevailed in the conference,
the test is not national independ
ence but ideological belief. Thus
MFN treatment must be denied
to “any country or area domi
nated or controlled by Commu
nism.” If this test prevails in the
final bill, the President will have
to deny MFN treatment “as soon
as practicable” to Poland and
Yugoslavia.
