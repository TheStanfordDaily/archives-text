# MISLEADING
## Iraqi Student Shows Danger Of 'Labelling' 
### SUSAN BROWN 
American press representatives
at the Helsinki Youth Festival
observed and duly reported the
kinds of actions and attitudes
they hoped to find. Thus the
American public has read volum
inously about tear gas and anti-
Soviet demonstrations, about
Westerners “struggling” to gain
the floor, and about Africans who
walked out. Consciously or un
consciously, in tone if not in facts,
American reports were as guilty
of black-and-whitism as Commu
nist reports.
“All persons—even “neutrals —
were pictured either as Commu
nist or non-Communist. Such re
ports, in merely reconfirming
false American assumptions,
have done little in our country to
increase an understanding of
world problems.
AN IRAQI, named “M,” a lead
er of Iraq students in England,
where he was studying, only
laughed when I said that I as
sumed he must be a Communist,
if he was a leader in WFDY, an
organization whose name we pop
ularly preface with “Communist
dominated.” Conversation brought
out that he was well-educated,
cultured, thinking, sincere, ideal
istic, and that he disliked labels.
Because of his affiliation with
WFDY, our own government—
and his too - would probably label
him a Communist. If I must label
him—he was simply a humanist.
Himself, the first son of a weal
thy merchant, he told me about the
social conditions in his own coun
try—the kind of thing we hear
and read about but rarely give
much thought, really. To the ma
jority of the Iraqi population the
word “opportunity” is merely a
word with no meaning. Most peo
ple never go to school. Woman’s
role is confined to the home. Suf
ficient food and shelter are mat
ters of primary concern.
“M” looks at his country and
at the great social revolution
which must take place before
real progress can be made. Then
he looks at those examples of
modern societies which he might
follow and to whom he will want
to look for support. In England,
where he has lived for three
years, he has experienced strong
discrimination while searching
for housing, and while trying to
make British friends and social
contacts.
AT THE Helsinki Festival,
“M” met Iraqi students who are
studying behind the Iron Curtain.
They told him (contrary to the
impression given by the Western
press) that, rather than discrim
ination against them, they have
experienced discrimination for
them. They live with the students
native to the country where they
are studying, and they have no
trouble making friends with
them. Not a holiday goes by that
they are not either invited to a
home, or a trip is arranged for
them, and they have the money
and the freedom to travel widely
-—even in the West.
He hears that the U.S. Federal
government and the majority of
Americans today really do sup
port full integration of Negroes.
“Why then,” he asked me "were
only 7 per cent of Southern Negro
children in integrated schools at
the end of 1961?”
HE HEARS the West reiterate
desires to help oppressed and
have-not people—and watches
them continue to support oligar
chic regimes which will forever
oppose change. “The U.S. govern
ment,” “M” said, “is the wealthi
est and probably the most pow
erful in the world. If it is truly,
sincerely committed to helping
the have-not people of (he world,
why doesn’t it? Why does it keep
in office corrupt ambassadors?
Where U.S. aid dollars go—even
for explicit purposes—why do so
few people receive a glass of milk
and a plot of land, while ingrain
ed local leaders drive new cars,
protected by new American
guns?”
I couldn’t answer him.
More and more I am convinced
that many of the social injustices
within our country remac, unre
formed because Americans are
not concerned with them, and
that much of our foreign aid is
misused because Americans are
unaware of its misuse.
IT MAY well bo too much to
ask even the college-educated peo
ple of America to be concerned
about those Negroes who also
want a college education, to be
concerned about those millions
of have-nots whom they never
see. If this is true, then the
American democracy faces a se
vere dilemma. For democracy
necessitates popular responsibili
ty for and direction of social and
governmental problems. If we
Americans prefer to decline ac
ceptance of the responsibility
and refuse to concern ourselves
with the frankly more and more
complex and profound problems
facing us and our government,
then we must face the realistic
prospect of losing the privilege to
hold this responsibility.

More and more I am convinced
that many of the social injustices
within our country remac, unre
formed because Americans are
not concerned with them, and
that much of our foreign aid is
misused because Americans are
unaware of its misuse.
IT MAY well bo too much to
ask even the college-educated peo
ple of America to be concerned
about those Negroes who also
want a college education, to be
concerned about those millions
of have-nots whom they never

American democracy faces a se

necessitates popular responsibili

governmental problems. If we
Americans prefer to decline ac

and refuse to concern ourselves
with the frankly more and more
complex and profound problems
facing us and our government,
then we must face the realistic
prospect of losing the privilege to
hold this responsibility.
American press representatives
at the Helsinki Youth Festival
observed and duly reported the
kinds of actions and attitudes
they hoped to find. Thus the
American public has read volum
inously about tear gas and anti-
Soviet demonstrations, about
Westerners “struggling” to gain
the floor, and about Africans who
walked out. Consciously or un
consciously, in tone if not in facts,
American reports were as guilty
of black-and-whitism as Commu
nist reports.
“All persons—even “neutrals —
were pictured either as Commu

false American assumptions,
have done little in our country to

AN IRAQI, named “M,” a lead
er of Iraq students in England,
where he was studying, only
laughed when I said that I as
sumed he must be a Communist,
if he was a leader in WFDY, an
organization whose name we pop
ularly preface with “Communist
dominated.” Conversation brought
out that he was well-educated,
cultured, thinking, sincere, ideal
istic, and that he disliked labels.
Because of his affiliation with
WFDY, our own government—
and his too - would probably label
him a Communist. If I must label
him—he was simply a humanist.
Himself, the first son of a weal
thy merchant, he told me about the
social conditions in his own coun
try—the kind of thing we hear
and read about but rarely give
much thought, really. To the ma
jority of the Iraqi population the
word “opportunity” is merely a
word with no meaning. Most peo
ple never go to school. Woman’s
role is confined to the home. Suf
ficient food and shelter are mat
ters of primary concern.
“M” looks at his country and
at the great social revolution
which must take place before
real progress can be made. Then
he looks at those examples of
modern societies which he might
follow and to whom he will want
to look for support. In England,
where he has lived for three
years, he has experienced strong
discrimination while searching
for housing, and while trying to
make British friends and social
contacts.
AT THE Helsinki Festival,
“M” met Iraqi students who are
studying behind the Iron Curtain.
They told him (contrary to the
impression given by the Western
press) that, rather than discrim
ination against them, they have
experienced discrimination for
them. They live with the students
native to the country where they
are studying, and they have no
trouble making friends with
them. Not a holiday goes by that
they are not either invited to a
home, or a trip is arranged for
them, and they have the money
and the freedom to travel widely
-—even in the West.
He hears that the U.S. Federal
government and the majority of
Americans today really do sup
port full integration of Negroes.
“Why then,” he asked me "were
only 7 per cent of Southern Negro
children in integrated schools at
the end of 1961?”

ple never go to school. Woman’s
role is confined to the home. Suf
ficient food and shelter are mat
ters of primary concern.
“M” looks at his country and
at the great social revolution
which must take place before
real progress can be made. Then
he looks at those examples of
modern societies which he might
follow and to whom he will want
to look for support. In England,
where he has lived for three
years, he has experienced strong
discrimination while searching
for housing, and while trying to
make British friends and social
contacts.
AT THE Helsinki Festival,
“M” met Iraqi students who are
studying behind the Iron Curtain.
They told him (contrary to the
impression given by the Western
press) that, rather than discrim
ination against them, they have
experienced discrimination for
them. They live with the students
native to the country where they
are studying, and they have no
trouble making friends with
them. Not a holiday goes by that
they are not either invited to a
home, or a trip is arranged for
them, and they have the money
and the freedom to travel widely
-—even in the West.
He hears that the U.S. Federal
government and the majority of
Americans today really do sup
port full integration of Negroes.
“Why then,” he asked me "were
only 7 per cent of Southern Negro
children in integrated schools at
the end of 1961?”
HE HEARS the West reiterate
desires to help oppressed and
have-not people—and watches
them continue to support oligar
chic regimes which will forever
oppose change. “The U.S. govern
ment,” “M” said, “is the wealthi
est and probably the most pow
erful in the world. If it is truly,
sincerely committed to helping
the have-not people of (he world,
why doesn’t it? Why does it keep
in office corrupt ambassadors?
Where U.S. aid dollars go—even
for explicit purposes—why do so
few people receive a glass of milk
and a plot of land, while ingrain
ed local leaders drive new cars,
protected by new American
guns?”
I couldn’t answer him.
More and more I am convinced
that many of the social injustices
within our country remac, unre
formed because Americans are
not concerned with them, and
that much of our foreign aid is
misused because Americans are
unaware of its misuse.
IT MAY well bo too much to
ask even the college-educated peo
ple of America to be concerned
about those Negroes who also
want a college education, to be
concerned about those millions
of have-nots whom they never
see. If this is true, then the
American democracy faces a se
vere dilemma. For democracy
necessitates popular responsibili
ty for and direction of social and
governmental problems. If we
Americans prefer to decline ac
ceptance of the responsibility
and refuse to concern ourselves
with the frankly more and more
complex and profound problems
facing us and our government,
then we must face the realistic
prospect of losing the privilege to
hold this responsibility.
American press representatives
at the Helsinki Youth Festival
observed and duly reported the
kinds of actions and attitudes
they hoped to find. Thus the
American public has read volum
inously about tear gas and anti-
Soviet demonstrations, about
Westerners “struggling” to gain
the floor, and about Africans who
walked out. Consciously or un
consciously, in tone if not in facts,
American reports were as guilty
of black-and-whitism as Commu
nist reports.
“All persons—even “neutrals —
were pictured either as Commu
nist or non-Communist. Such re
ports, in merely reconfirming
false American assumptions,
have done little in our country to
increase an understanding of
world problems.
AN IRAQI, named “M,” a lead
er of Iraq students in England,
where he was studying, only
laughed when I said that I as
sumed he must be a Communist,
if he was a leader in WFDY, an
organization whose name we pop
ularly preface with “Communist
dominated.” Conversation brought
out that he was well-educated,
cultured, thinking, sincere, ideal
istic, and that he disliked labels.
Because of his affiliation with
WFDY, our own government—
and his too - would probably label
him a Communist. If I must label
him—he was simply a humanist.
Himself, the first son of a weal
thy merchant, he told me about the
social conditions in his own coun
try—the kind of thing we hear
and read about but rarely give
much thought, really. To the ma
jority of the Iraqi population the
word “opportunity” is merely a
word with no meaning. Most peo
ple never go to school. Woman’s
role is confined to the home. Suf
