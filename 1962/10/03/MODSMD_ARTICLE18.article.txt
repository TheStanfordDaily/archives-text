# McKAY GLUM, BUT ...
## UW, USC Favorites in AAWU 
### 
This is the first half of an ar
ticle covering Stanford's competi
tors for the Rose Bowl this year.
The second half will appear to
morrow.
By 808 SCHRADER
Washington and USC loom as
co-favorites to win the AAWU
football title in what appears to
be the most wide open race to the
Rose Bowl in several years.
Along the sunless shores of
Lake Washington amid the lodge
poles and rites of conspicuous
consumption, the University of
Washington crushed Purdue sta
tistically while gaining a 7-7 fie
in the season opener two weeks
ago. Displaying expected rushing
power, the Seattle team netted
234 yards to the Boilermakers
109. They passed for 41 while
Purdue managed only 21 through
the air. To make their statistical
victory complete, the Huskies
with diversity and aggressiveness
demonstrated that they could
move the ball as well backward
as forward. They moved it from
one team to another by means of

the fumble, and they moved it
backward 107 yards (to Purdue’s
measly 20) via the penalty.
Despite their poor showing on
the scoreboard, and their ill
placed post-game contempt for
Purdue’s fatties, the Huskies ap
pear strong enough to make a
good showing in the Big 5.
FUEL BACKS Boh Monroe and
Junior Coffey lived up to pre
season chatter as did All-Coast
halfback Charlie Mitchell and
speedy but small quarterback
Bill Siler. Halfbacks Martin Wy
att, Nat Whitmyer and Jim Sti
ger showed that they will con
tinue to see plenty of action.
A strong interior line led by
veterans Ray Mansfield, center,
and Rod Scheyer, tackle, is sup
ported by Sophomore guard Rick
Sortun and former redshirt
tackles Jake Kupp and Chuck
Bond. Jerry and Jon Knoll, 6-5,
230-lb. Sophomore twins also with
redshirt experience will play vital
reserve roles.

At end, where Washington
looks to be the best on the Coast,

last year’s starters Lee Bernhar
tli and Duane Locknane are hark
ed by four lettermen.

Quarterback is definitely the
weak spot where the Huskies will
have to receive consistent per
formances if their offense is to
function as it should. Siler and
Pete Ohler are the leading candi
dates at this position, but there
will likely be a few new faces
there before the season’s end.
IN THE RELATIVELY empty
coliseum of Los Angeles where
college football must survive the
sophisticated competition of both
Disneyland and the pro game,
26,000 spectators watched John
McKay’s “dark horse” Trojans
upset Bth ranked Duke on Sep
tember 22, 14-7. With 176 yards
through the air, the men of Troy
showed particular mastery of the
forward pass. Quarterbacks Pete
Beathard and Bill Nelson, two of
the nation’s best, each figured in
the scoring. Beathard pitched 4
yards to flashy halfback Willie
Brown, and Nelson hit 6-5 Hal
Bedsole in a 51-yard tie-breaking
play.
When 230-lb., line-shredding
fullback Ben Wilson is healthy,
these gentlemen are able to move
the football as well as any simi
lar aggregation in the West.
SOUTHERN UAL has better
team speed this year, which
should improve both offense and
defense. Barring injuries, Coach
McKay looks for a stronger team
than last season when the Tro
jans finished with a 4-5-1 record,
Troy’s interior line is, if we
are to believe McKay, the real
weak spot in the lineup. With the
only five returning regulars all
uncertain of starting spots in the
face of strong junior college and
freshman competition, skeptics
may harbor doubts as to the gen
uineness of humorist McKay’s
concern. After holding highly re
garded Duke to 55 yards on the
ground, Coach McKay and his
weak links show promise of being
very unfunny to opposing
coaches this season.
