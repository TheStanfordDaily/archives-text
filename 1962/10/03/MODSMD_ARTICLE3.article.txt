# Electricity Can Produce Fear, Explains Psychiatrist Hamburg
## 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
Stimulation by electrodes in certain areas of the brain pro
duces a fear response in animals, explained Dr. David Hamburg
last evening in the first presentation of the Tuesday Evening
Scries. The discussion concerned the behavioral and biological
aspects of fear. The Executive Head of Stanford’s Psychiatry De-

partment, speaking to an over-'
flow crowd at Dinkelspiel, ex
plained that an animal, through
association, soon develops a fear
reaction to the environment in
which ho was stimulated.
“MONKEYS raised in social iso
lation during the first two years
of life are exceedingly fearful
throughout life.” he said, illus
trating his point with a slide of
an experimental monkey huddling
in a corner. “This is in marked
contrast with monkeys who have

had contact with other monkeys
in the first two years of life,” he
said.
A heredity relationship to an
animal’s amount of fear response
has been found, he said. Differ
ent brcds of dogs have varying
fear responsiveness to novel
stimuli. “Fear has some useful
functions,” Hamburg noted;
“since many individuals almost
require an experience of intense
fear in order to seek help for
personal problems.” Benefits
come when fear falls in an opti
mal range. “Too much or too
little fear may hinder perform
ance, though in different ways,”
he said.
“There is a strong inverse rela
tion between fear and self-es
teem,” he explaned. A person of
low self-esteem is fearful not only
about his present abilities but
also about his potential to de
velop now abilities.
FEAR produces physiological
responses in the body, he pointed
out. Substances in the blood, par
ticularly glucose, fats, and the
hormone hydrocortisone, increase
in concentration. In preparation
for an emergency situation,
blood is increased in brain and
muscle regions and decreased in
gastro-intestinal regions.
“When in fear, we need each
other, Hamburg concluded.

“When in fear, we need each
other, Hamburg concluded.


DR. DAVID HAMBURG, head of the Psychiatry Department at Stan
ford Medical School, pauses during his lecture on the behavorial
and biological aspects of fear, which drew an overflow crowd to
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night.
Stimulation by electrodes in certain areas of the brain pro
duces a fear response in animals, explained Dr. David Hamburg
last evening in the first presentation of the Tuesday Evening
Scries. The discussion concerned the behavioral and biological
aspects of fear. The Executive Head of Stanford’s Psychiatry De-

partment, speaking to an over-'
flow crowd at Dinkelspiel, ex
plained that an animal, through
association, soon develops a fear
reaction to the environment in
which ho was stimulated.
“MONKEYS raised in social iso
lation during the first two years
of life are exceedingly fearful
throughout life.” he said, illus
trating his point with a slide of
an experimental monkey huddling
in a corner. “This is in marked
contrast with monkeys who have

had contact with other monkeys
in the first two years of life,” he
said.
A heredity relationship to an
animal’s amount of fear response
has been found, he said. Differ
ent brcds of dogs have varying
fear responsiveness to novel
stimuli. “Fear has some useful
functions,” Hamburg noted;
“since many individuals almost
require an experience of intense
fear in order to seek help for
personal problems.” Benefits
come when fear falls in an opti
mal range. “Too much or too
little fear may hinder perform
ance, though in different ways,”
he said.
“There is a strong inverse rela
tion between fear and self-es
teem,” he explaned. A person of
low self-esteem is fearful not only
about his present abilities but
also about his potential to de
velop now abilities.
FEAR produces physiological
responses in the body, he pointed
out. Substances in the blood, par
ticularly glucose, fats, and the
hormone hydrocortisone, increase
in concentration. In preparation
for an emergency situation,
blood is increased in brain and
muscle regions and decreased in
gastro-intestinal regions.

other, Hamburg concluded.
