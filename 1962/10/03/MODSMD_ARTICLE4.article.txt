### 
Do your walls look drab and bare? Would you like to embellish
them with reproductions of paintings of the world’s greatest mas
ters at practically no cost?
The AS.SU art board will rent today nearly 200 prints from
Renaissance through modern for 50 cents a quarter or $1 a year.
Art lovers may select the prints of their choice from 10 a.m. to 4
P-m. at the Art Board office, room 270 in Tresidder Union. That’s
at the top of the circular staircase.
Artists represented range from Fra Angelico, El Greco, Breug
hel, \an Gogh, and Picasso to the modernism of Klee. Many of the
prints have been framed in redwood or blond wood, according to
Art Board president Jon Stevens.
Art Board last year took over from the Library the handling
ot art reproductions. Money raised by last year’s rentals was used
to repair many of the piints, Stevens said. Backings have been re
placed and the new frames added.
Proceeds from rentals today will lx* used to expand the collection
and complete framing of the prints, he said.
