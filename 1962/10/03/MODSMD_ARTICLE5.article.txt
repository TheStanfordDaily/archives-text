# Larimer, Armin Ask Revision Of No-Contact Frosh Rush Rule
## 
### 
Acting Dean of Men David Larimer and ASSU President Ar
inin Rosencranz have asked a special student committee to “de
velop a comprehensive new rushing program,” departing from
the emphasis on no contact.
The committee consists of President Ed Eschbach and Rushing

Chairman Mike Hammer, both of!
the Inter-Fraternity Council; In
ter-Club President Frank Wal
lace; Stern president’s represent
ative Mike Devereux, and John
Stcinbruner, head Wilbur spon
sor.
Larimer said in his opinion
strict no contact was artificial
and detracted from a sensible
and meaningful rush program.
“RUSH AFFECTS the entire
men’s program,” Steinbruner
said: “It is only fair that the
whole men’s program should de
cide it.”
The committee will examine the
rushing program from all angles,
with each representative apprais
ing in the light of his own inter
ests. The committee will then
make its recommendations to the
administration. “I suppost that

the committee report will go into
effect, subject to administration
approval,” Hammer said. Stein
bruner said this was his under
standing also.
ESCHBACH said he would sup
port a proposal for ‘‘limited open
contact,” but that his view was
more conservative than the aver
age attitude towards freshman
rush.
Steinbruner said: ‘‘l hope that
if we propose changes, the
changes will be made this year.
We do not know if this is possi
ble,” but he was optimistic that
a change could be made this year
even though last year’s proposed
changes failed.
‘‘This is probably the first time
that the four groups concerned
have been brought together under
the auspices of an organization
with pow’er to carry out their
recommendations,” he said.
IFC IS independently consider
ing a change in recommended
rushing procedures. Mike Ham
mer reported on revision plans to
IFC delegates Monday night.
Next Monday the proposal will
be discussed, amended, voted on,
then revealed.
Eschbach said the special com
mittee should have proposals
ready to submit to the Dean of
Men’s office for approval within
a few weeks.
The committee could conceiv
ably abolish all no contact rules,
permitting informal rush
throughout fall and winter quar
ters.
At present, there is no frater
nity contact with freshmen
through fall and winter quarters,
with this exception; freshmen
may attend on-campus functions
approved by the IFC president
and rushing-chairman.
Orientation begins winter quar
ter with Stern, ICC, and IFC
jointly participating.
Formal rush begins the first
day of spring quarter with open
houses, but contact is restricted
to these. On Thursday evening,
restrictions are lifted and parties
begin on-and-off campus and
continue nightly until Sunday
evening when contact is again
limited.
Restrictions are lifted perma
nently on Monday with pledge
dinners and signing of pledge
cards.
According to an ICC spokes
man, Eating Club rushing differs
most by the absence of no-contact
rules, but it is also more infor
mal. Formal rush runs concur
rently with that of the fraterni
ties.
