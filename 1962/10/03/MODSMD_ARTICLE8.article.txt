# SOKOL PROMOTES FULBRIGHT GRANTS
## October Deadline Set for Fellowships 
### 
Deadlines for several scholarship and
fellowship programs, including the Wil
son, Rhodes, Danforth, Fulbright, and
Marshall programs, all available to Stan
ford students, are coming up soon.
U.S. Government scholarships for
graduate study or research abroad are
available now for the 1963-64 academic
year, under the Fulbright-Hays Act, ac
cording to Dr. A. E. Sokol. Stanford Ful
bright advisor. These grants provide tu
ition. round-trip transportation, and main
tenance for one academic year in any one
of 46 countries throughout the world.
FULBRIGHT scholarships are granted
to graduating seniors as well as to gradu
ate students and faculty members, he
said. General eligibility requirements are:
U.S. citizenship, a Bachelor’s degree or its
equivalent, sufficient language proficien
cy, and good health.
Ineligibility for a grant to a country is
established if an applicant has spent more
than three months there In the last three
years; this rules out students who have
been on the Stanford overseas campuses.
However, they bay obtain a grant to a
different country, Sokol pointed out.
Three types of grants are awarded; the
full grant, which pays all costs; the joint
U.S.-other government grant, under which
the U.S. provides travel expenses and an
other government pays tuition and main

tenance; and the travel-only grant, for
which travel costs are given to supple
ment tuition scholarships granted by
other sources.
Dr. Sokol, Professor of Political Sci
ence, noted that the Fulbright program
is a “splendid opportunity for students to
go abroad and study, of which our.stu
dents should take full advantage; more
should apply than have done so in the
past.’’ Last year, 10 students and 6 fac
ulty members received grants; Sokol
hopes that this year the number will be
greater.
Sokol has given out 55 applications to
this date; he urged that others interested
obtain an application form immediately.
The deadline for filing applications is
Oct. 19.

inducement to selectors.
The winners will be granted passage
to. living expenses in. and tuition at any
of Britain's 24 universities for a period of
