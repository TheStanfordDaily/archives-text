# Potter Asserts Race Problem Still Unsettled
## 
### NANCY MARSHALL 
The Mississippi integration cri
sis is in the past and so is the
mass insistence that precipitated
the incident, Dr. David M. Potter
said in the first of a series of
programs sponsored by Political
Union to arouse student interest
in current affairs and problems.
What remains is a broader
racial problem that is not settled
at all simply by enrolling Negro
James Meredith in the University
of Mississippi, Potter stated.
LABELING the present Missis
sippi situation as “talked to death’’
and “in need of a rest,” Potter, a
professor of history at Stanford
analysed the question “in a per
spective not of hours between now
and last Sunday, but of months
and years since 1954.
At this time the Supreme Court
ruled state laws requiring segre
gation in schools to be contrary
to the fourteenth amendment.
“This ruling really drew three
reactions from the states -compli
ance, indirect delay, and massive
or total resistance,” said the his
torian. Several states around the
critical region quickly accepted
the decision, he said, while others
“adopted tactics of delay” in estab
lishing integration.
A THIRD GROUP of states in
the deep South formed a hard core
of opposition to the federal deci
sion. “These adopted massive in
sistence to see that the school
system remains unchanged,” said
Potter, and this is the setting of
the most recent events.
Potter said the consequences of
Meredith’s enrollment were “not
indicative in the way President
Kennedy had hoped.” “I don’t see
what more the President could
have done to be consistent with
court orders as he did appeal to
the people, he did wait before in
tervening, and he did send in fed
eral marshals rather than troops,”
Potter said.
“FOCUS on the melodrama of
mass resistence suggests that the
South is partly monolithic,” said
Potter. However this solidarity is
more of an impression from the
events of the last few days than
the facts indicate, he continued.
Potter pointed out that the
clergy has said little and that
teachers at the University of Mis
sissippi have said nothing publicly
supporting Governor Ross Bar
nett.
The speaker posed what he con
sidered to be “interesting mar
ginal questions,” questions which
he left unanswered. Potter asked
the audience, composed of almost
twice as many students as there
were seats available in the main
lounge of Tresidder Union, why
marshals guarded the university
administration building thus at
tracting crowds which soon rioted
when Meredith was at the time
lodged in a campus dormitory.
AFTF.R READING diverging
statements reporting how Mere
dith was put onto the campus,
Potter, who is an authority on the
American South, asked “what was
Kennedy’s understanding with
Barnett and what happened to it?”
“Here is an episode in a battle
which is part of a broader move
ment,” Potter concluded. “What
happened in one phase is no value
unless in context of the whole
problem.”
