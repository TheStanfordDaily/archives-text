# Rhinelander Begins Last Lecture Series
## 
### 
Professor Philip Rhinelander
will open Tresidder Union’s
unique “My Last Lecture” series
today at 4:30 in the second floor
lounge. Each speaker in this
series is asked to pretend that he
is about to give the last lecture
of his career.
He is free to talk on whatever
ho feels is of significance and
whatever he feels he must say
before his career is over.
The fact that no particular top
ic is assigned to the speaker
means that little can be known in
advance about the subject of Pro
fessor Rhinelander’s talk. Profes
sor Rhinelander will deal, in part
at least, with what he considers
to be mankind’s most mportant
inventions.
