# Chief Davis Cautions Cyclists
## 
### PHIL DEGUERE 
Chief Gordon R. Davis of the
Stanford Police Dept, expressed
his concern Tuesday about the
bicycle-riding habits of Stanford
undergraduates. He said that ac
cidents resulting in personal or
property damage, and even death,
may result if more care is not
taken by all bicycle owners.
Of primary concern to the Po
lice Department is the lack of at
tention paid by the student body
to the bicycle paths on Palm Ave.
and Galvez St. The chief said
that no bicycles have any busi
ness on the highway portion of
Palm Ave. or on Galvez St. from
the Men’s Gym to El Camino.
Automobiles travel these
roads at considerably higher
speeds than they do within the
campus, and a bicycle rider on
the street may leave a motorist
with the choice of striking the
cyclist or of having a head-on col
lision with a car coming in the
opposite direction.
CONCERNING all bicycles any

where on campus, Chief Davis
referred to sections 25652 and
21050 of the California Vehicle
Code, which state that “every
person riding a bicycle . . . upon
a highway has all of the rights
and is subject (o all of the duties
applicable to the driver of a ve
hicle . . . except those provisions
which by their very nature can
have no application.” and that all
bicycles ridden at night must
have a headlight visible for at
least three hundred feet ahead
and a taillight or reflector visible
for the same distance behind.
The Chief called attention to
the fact that this section indi
cates that all bicycles must come
to a full stop at stop signs, a
practice almost completely ig
nored on campus.
HE SAID that if a bicycle
strikes an automobile or vice ver
sa at any time when the automo
bile has the right of way, the
blame will rest solely with the
cyclist. He added that citations
have been handed out in the past

If it is necessary for a cyclist
to ride on the road, when no side
path is available, the Chief said
that he should stay to the ex
treme right-hand side, and said
that weaving, riding two or three
bicycles abreast, or having more
than one person on a cycle at a
time should be strictly avoided.
STUDENTS are also reminded
that riding is prohibited along
the walkways under the colon
nades on inner and outer quad,
since students leaving the class
rooms cannot hear the cyclist ap
proaching.
The Chief further recommend
ed that all students tape their
name and address on the bicycle
frame under the seat, in the
event that it is lost or stolen.
Chief Davis would not say
that citations would be handed
out for any or all of the above
violations in the immediate fu
ture, but said that greatly in
creased care should be exercised
by all concerned if serious acci
dents are to be avoided.
