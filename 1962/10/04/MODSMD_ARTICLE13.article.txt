# Faculty Committees Open To Students
## 
### 
The Faculty Affairs and Services Committee voted Tuesday
to ask President Wallace Sterling to appoint five students to the
committee. The students will be full voting members.
Executive assistant to the president, Fred Glover said that
Sterling has asked ASSU president Annin Roseneranz to name ten

students; Sterling would then se
lect the five for the committee
from this group.
Professor Eric Hutchinson,
chairman of the Student Affairs
Committee, said, “Stanford stu
dents have long wanted a hand in
affairs affecting them. Student
Affairs is the most useful place
for them to make their views
known and to work with faculty
members on matters of mutual
interest. This is going to bo a
useful change.”
DURING last Spring Quarter
Student Affairs voted against
adding students to its member
ship. “In the spring we weren’t
sure having students on the com
mittee would help the work of
the committee. When we met
Tuesday, the feeling was differ
ent.”
In a letter sent Sept. 18 to
twelve presidential committees
Sterling wrote, “Student leaders
have made repeated requests in
recent years for the opportunity
to contribute formally or infor
mally to the work done by Uni
versity committees.
“I assured the President of the
Associated Students that I would
call this interest to the attention
of the chairmen of Faculty Com
mittees, as I now do,” he con
tinued.
THE DECISION whether to
have students or not was left to
the individual committees, and
committees choosing to admit
students would retain the right
to hold executive sessions from
which students may bo excluded.
All committees will be chosen
by Sterling after consultation
with the ASSU President.
“I am confident that once stu
dents begin serving on University
committees they will demon
strate to the other members that
they are not only capable of
making a very substantial contri
bution to the committees’ delib
erations, but are completely
trustworthy as well; therefore, it
should be entirely unnecessary to
hold executive sessions,” Armin
said.
John Steinbruner provided
the following information about
the campaign to have students
appointed to faculty committees:
Last year a number of groups
and students began agitating for
a greater voice in administering
the university. These groups
came together in the Constitu
tional Committee. Their philoso
phy of student education through
participation was developed at
open houses with former’ Dean of
Men William Craig.
THEIR first suggestion was
the establishment of student com
mittees paralleling the faculty
committees, paving the way for
later direct participation. Ster
ling and Vice Provost Richard
Wert said the idea was cumber
some, but the deans wore inter
ested. No attempt was made to
get direct participation then.
In the late spring, after the de
feat of the proposed constitution,
several interested students talked
to Sterling. At that time Sterling
promised to tell the faculty com
mittee chairmen that students
would like to join their commit
tees.

ested. No attempt was made to
get direct participation then.
In the late spring, after the de
feat of the proposed constitution,
several interested students talked
to Sterling. At that time Sterling
promised to tell the faculty com
mittee chairmen that students
would like to join their commit
tees.
The Faculty Affairs and Services Committee voted Tuesday
to ask President Wallace Sterling to appoint five students to the
committee. The students will be full voting members.
Executive assistant to the president, Fred Glover said that
Sterling has asked ASSU president Annin Roseneranz to name ten

students; Sterling would then se
lect the five for the committee
from this group.
Professor Eric Hutchinson,
chairman of the Student Affairs
Committee, said, “Stanford stu
dents have long wanted a hand in
affairs affecting them. Student
Affairs is the most useful place
for them to make their views
known and to work with faculty
members on matters of mutual
interest. This is going to bo a
useful change.”
DURING last Spring Quarter
Student Affairs voted against
adding students to its member
ship. “In the spring we weren’t
sure having students on the com
mittee would help the work of
the committee. When we met
Tuesday, the feeling was differ
ent.”
In a letter sent Sept. 18 to
twelve presidential committees
Sterling wrote, “Student leaders
have made repeated requests in
recent years for the opportunity
to contribute formally or infor
mally to the work done by Uni
versity committees.
“I assured the President of the
Associated Students that I would
call this interest to the attention
of the chairmen of Faculty Com
mittees, as I now do,” he con
tinued.
THE DECISION whether to
have students or not was left to
the individual committees, and
committees choosing to admit
students would retain the right
to hold executive sessions from
which students may bo excluded.
All committees will be chosen
by Sterling after consultation
with the ASSU President.
“I am confident that once stu
dents begin serving on University
committees they will demon
strate to the other members that
they are not only capable of
making a very substantial contri
bution to the committees’ delib
erations, but are completely
trustworthy as well; therefore, it
should be entirely unnecessary to
hold executive sessions,” Armin
said.
John Steinbruner provided
the following information about
the campaign to have students
appointed to faculty committees:
Last year a number of groups
and students began agitating for
a greater voice in administering
the university. These groups
came together in the Constitu
tional Committee. Their philoso
phy of student education through
participation was developed at
open houses with former’ Dean of
Men William Craig.
THEIR first suggestion was
the establishment of student com
mittees paralleling the faculty
committees, paving the way for
later direct participation. Ster
ling and Vice Provost Richard
Wert said the idea was cumber
some, but the deans wore inter
ested. No attempt was made to
