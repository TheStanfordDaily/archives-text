# Death, Dope And Mr. Nixon
## 
### 
In Monday’s debate between Governor Brown and Mr. Nixon,
the crime rate in California was raised as a political issue. Mr.
Nixon stated: “California is first in crime in all the states. More
crimes are committed in California than in New York, New Jersey
and Pennsylvania combined. Crime has gone up four times as fast
as population in the three and one-half years that Mr. Brown has
been governor of this state.”
Whether or not California is actually experiencing a new and
ominous crime* wave is open to considerable dispute. The Gover
nor indicated that Chief Justice Earl Warren had blessed Cali
fornia's law enforcement with magnificent superlative's. Governor
Brown added that “J. Edgar Hoover in his report said that Cali
fornia was one of the few states in the Union that had gone down
in per capita crime in the entire United State's.” Mr. Nixon has his
own set of statistics and quotations to prove that Governor
Brown's statistics and quotations are wrong—dead wrong. For any
one but a penological statistician, the debate is highly confusing
and perhaps boring.
Regarelless of these attributes, the argument is important and
may become more so, for Mr. Nixon concludes from his statistics
that “when California is first in crime we must have capital pun
ishment.” Mr. Nixon remarked that the Governor wished to abolish
capital punishment.
Granted that the arguments pro ami con capital punishment
have been nearly exhausted. Mr. Nixon has added a new dimen
sion to the argument, however. Mr. Nixon wants the death penalty
for dope peddlers. The death penalty, argues Mr. Nixon, will deter
dope peddlers.
Peddling this solution, Mr. Nixon may hope to win political
advantage, but his deterrent is that of blind retaliation.
Perhaps the death penalty for dope peddlers is unnecessary.
Perhaps it is stupid. It is certainly inappropriate to the crime.
