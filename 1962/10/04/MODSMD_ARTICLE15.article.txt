Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Weinig we have a rare
species indeed, a fuzzy minded,
black and white conservative.
(Not to be confused with the re
portedly more abundant fuzzy
minded, gray liberal.) As support
for this identification of Mr. Wei
nig, I offer the following points:
1. Mr. Weinig asserts that the
Latin American countries would
welcome the removal of the Cas
tro government by moans of
armed United States intervention.
As evidence he cites the fact that
the heads of several Latin Ameri
can nations have expressed such
a desire.
However it seems doubtful that
men such as Duvalier and Ydi
goras, to mention two, are very
accurate representatives of the
views and aspirations of their re
spective peoples, and it is the re
actions of the people of Latin
America which is of pr ime im
portance. Rather than being wel
comed by these peoples, it would
appear more likely that an inva
sion of Cuba would be seen as
another example of (he hostility
of the United States, lip service
not to the contrary, to any thor
ough social reform in the Latin
American countries.
ONE NEED only recall the
United States’ policies of political
and economic harassment of Cu
ba in the early days of their revo
lution and some historic examples
of United States ‘gunboat diplo
macy’ to understand how such a
view could have arisen. An inva
sion of Cuba would result in a
further alienation of the Latin
American peoples from the Unit
ed States, and contribute to in
crease non-receptivity towards
any legitimate efforts of the Unit
ed States to enhance political free
dom and economic welfare in
Latin America.
2. Two of Mr. Weinig’s justifi
cations for armed intervention
were his assertion that Cuba is
guilty of aggression against cer
tain Latin American states as in

dicated by the fact that the Cas
tro government actively supports
revolutionary and reform move
ments in these countries, and that
the military assistance from the
‘communist’ bloc to Cuba consti
tutes a threat to the peace of the
western hemisphere.
If these are sufficient reasons
for invasion then Mr. Weinig
could not object to: a) a Cuban
invasion of America, since the
United States not only supports
counter-revolutionary elements in
Cuba and elsewhere, but also sup
ported, with money and material,
an attempted invasion of Cuba;
b) an invasion of Iran by the
USSR at the time of the over
throw of the Mossadegh govern
ment. which was engineered pri
marily by the CIA; c) an invasion
of Formosa by mainland China,
since Formosa is not only overtly
hostile to mainland China, hut
also is supported politically, eco
nomically and militarily by the
United States.
5. MR. WEINIG’S implication
that the Castro government came
to power without the support of
the majority of the Cuban people
is a blatant falsehood; as anyone
knows who cares to recall. In
deed, at the time of the flight of
Batista from Cuba most reliable
sources estimated that 80 per
cent of the Cuban people support
ed Castro.
4. Mr. Weinig further asserts
that only 20 per cent of the Cu
ban people now support the Cas
tro government. Perhaps Mr.
Weinig would have us infer from
this that the Cuban people will
rise in mass support of an Ameri
can invasion. A similar view was
held a little over a year ago and
proved to be quite erroneous.
6. Finally, Mr. Weinig declares
that the United States should in
vade Cuba in order to ‘allow the
Cuban people to govern them
selves once again.’ Perhaps under
another stalwart of democracy
and firm friend of the United
States like Sergeant Batista?

any legitimate efforts of the Unit
ed States to enhance political free
dom and economic welfare in
Latin America.
2. Two of Mr. Weinig’s justifi
cations for armed intervention
were his assertion that Cuba is
guilty of aggression against cer
tain Latin American states as in

dicated by the fact that the Cas
tro government actively supports
revolutionary and reform move
ments in these countries, and that
the military assistance from the
‘communist’ bloc to Cuba consti
tutes a threat to the peace of the
western hemisphere.
If these are sufficient reasons
for invasion then Mr. Weinig
could not object to: a) a Cuban
invasion of America, since the
United States not only supports
counter-revolutionary elements in
Cuba and elsewhere, but also sup
ported, with money and material,
an attempted invasion of Cuba;
b) an invasion of Iran by the
USSR at the time of the over
throw of the Mossadegh govern
ment. which was engineered pri
marily by the CIA; c) an invasion
of Formosa by mainland China,
since Formosa is not only overtly
hostile to mainland China, hut
also is supported politically, eco
nomically and militarily by the
United States.
5. MR. WEINIG’S implication
that the Castro government came
to power without the support of
the majority of the Cuban people
is a blatant falsehood; as anyone
knows who cares to recall. In
deed, at the time of the flight of
Batista from Cuba most reliable
sources estimated that 80 per
cent of the Cuban people support
ed Castro.
4. Mr. Weinig further asserts
that only 20 per cent of the Cu
ban people now support the Cas
tro government. Perhaps Mr.
Weinig would have us infer from
this that the Cuban people will
rise in mass support of an Ameri
can invasion. A similar view was
held a little over a year ago and
proved to be quite erroneous.
6. Finally, Mr. Weinig declares
that the United States should in
vade Cuba in order to ‘allow the
Cuban people to govern them
selves once again.’ Perhaps under
another stalwart of democracy
and firm friend of the United
States like Sergeant Batista?

In Mr. Weinig we have a rare
species indeed, a fuzzy minded,
black and white conservative.
(Not to be confused with the re
portedly more abundant fuzzy

for this identification of Mr. Wei
nig, I offer the following points:
1. Mr. Weinig asserts that the
Latin American countries would
welcome the removal of the Cas
tro government by moans of
armed United States intervention.
As evidence he cites the fact that
the heads of several Latin Ameri
can nations have expressed such
a desire.
However it seems doubtful that
men such as Duvalier and Ydi
goras, to mention two, are very
accurate representatives of the
views and aspirations of their re
spective peoples, and it is the re
actions of the people of Latin
America which is of pr ime im
portance. Rather than being wel
comed by these peoples, it would
appear more likely that an inva
sion of Cuba would be seen as
another example of (he hostility
of the United States, lip service
not to the contrary, to any thor
ough social reform in the Latin
American countries.

and economic harassment of Cu

4. Mr. Weinig further asserts
that only 20 per cent of the Cu
ban people now support the Cas
tro government. Perhaps Mr.
Weinig would have us infer from
this that the Cuban people will
rise in mass support of an Ameri
can invasion. A similar view was
held a little over a year ago and
proved to be quite erroneous.
6. Finally, Mr. Weinig declares
that the United States should in
vade Cuba in order to ‘allow the
Cuban people to govern them
selves once again.’ Perhaps under
another stalwart of democracy
and firm friend of the United
States like Sergeant Batista?
