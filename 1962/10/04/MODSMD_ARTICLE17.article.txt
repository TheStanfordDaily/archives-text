# IN GHANA
## Peace Corps Volunteer Living in Africa 
### 
(Editor’s note: This is a letter
from Rosemary George, a Stan
ford graduate now in the Peace
Corps in Ghana. The letter was
received by the Peace Corps Desk
of the Institute of International
Relations.)

Training began for Ghana at
Berkeley in June. We were ex
tremely fortunate to have an out
standing faculty of knowledge
able and experienced experts on
Ghana and Africa to guide our
learning, I would venture the
opinion that the intensity and
caliber of the instruction can be
directly correlated with the effec
tiveness and overall performance
of the Peace Corps Volunteer in
his assignment overseas. Our
eight-week program ran on a
five and one-half day class week
beginning at 8 a m. and usually
ending around 10 p.m., with time
out for lunch and dinner. In ad
dition to this rigorous class sched
ule, we managed to read exten
sively and compile several proj
ects.

The major emphasis of our
studies was Ghana, education in
Ghana (since we will all be teach
ers), and Africa in general. Al
though instruction in schools is
in English, the official language
of the country (Ghana was under
British rule as the Gold Coast
until independence in 1957), we
received daily instruction in Twi
from Twi-spcaking Ghanaians.
Twi is the dominant vernacular
of approximately 50 languages
and dialects spoken in Ghana.
ATTENTION was also given
to courses titled American
Studies and International Studies,
benefiting from the participation
of Cal professors in these lecture
discussion sessions.

Another aspect of our training
was to prepare use for maintain
ing our personal health and hy
giene in an area unblessed with
the amenities we take for granted
in America. Each of us has a
medical kit and is prepared to
render emergency treatment. I’m
hoping the occasion wall not arise
when I might be called upon to
assist in the delivery of a baby,
but for that too we are prepared.
A daily hour and a half of
physical fitness was designed
both to maintain and encourage
good physical condition and to
familiarize us with the games
played by Ghanaian youth, since
most of us will also be involved
with the athletic program of our
schools.

YOU MIGHT be wondering just
what kind of people become en
gaged in an endeavor of this na
ture. My impression is that PCV’s
are both realistic and idealistic:
realistic in the sense that they are
aware of the inherent danger in
the world situation today and
have a deep conviction that Amer
icans must live the ideals which
they have preached for so long—
peace freedom equality
individual worth human broth
erhood; idealistic in their belief
and hope that through contribut
ing two years of their life they
can assist in some small way in
the ultimate realization of these
ideals for all mankind.
Cui multum detum is the in
scription we read on our table
settings at every meal here at the
University of Ghana where we
are quartered during this two
week orientation period. This re
minder is meant for the univer
sity students, who form an edu
cated elite in a country which is
still over 50 per cent illiterate, I
feel it is even more appropriate
for us. How many warnings we
Americans have had in recent
years that much is required of
those to whom so much has been
given.

The average age of PCV’s tends
to be around 25, which is under
standable since this kind of proj
ect is more easily undertaken be
fore one has accepted certain re
sponsibilities. Our group is no ex
ception, except for an experienced
male chemistry teacher age 57.
Although some in our group have
advanced degrees and teaching
experience, the majority received
their A.B. or B.S. this June.
OF THE initial 85 candidates
the ratio of men to women was
about 3:1 (average for all
groups), which seems only natur
al to a Stanford woman! Califor
nia, with 13 trainees, rated high
est numerically of 33 states rep
resented. Stanford led the uni
versities with seven graduates
(4 M.A.’s).

Other statistics which may be
of interest: five Negroes anci one
married couple. Most secondary
teachers will teach math, science,
French, English. Since history
and the social sciences were my
field of study, I am hoping to be
able to teach some subjects in
these areas also, in addition to
the Fiench courses I have been
assigned.
Ghana does not conform strict
ly to a commonly imagined Africa
of arid plateaus, pestilential
swamps or steaming noxious
jungles. From the geographical
point of view Ghana can be di
vided into three principal latitu
dinal zones which generally con
form to the broad bands that ex
tend through all of West Africa:
the coastal savannahs, the forest

Cui multum detum is the in
scription we read on our table
settings at every meal here at the
University of Ghana where we
are quartered during this two
week orientation period. This re
minder is meant for the univer
sity students, who form an edu
cated elite in a country which is
still over 50 per cent illiterate, I
feel it is even more appropriate
for us. How many warnings we
Americans have had in recent
years that much is required of
those to whom so much has been
given.

The average age of PCV’s tends
to be around 25, which is under
standable since this kind of proj
ect is more easily undertaken be
fore one has accepted certain re
sponsibilities. Our group is no ex
ception, except for an experienced
male chemistry teacher age 57.
Although some in our group have
advanced degrees and teaching
experience, the majority received
their A.B. or B.S. this June.
OF THE initial 85 candidates
the ratio of men to women was
about 3:1 (average for all
groups), which seems only natur
al to a Stanford woman! Califor
nia, with 13 trainees, rated high
est numerically of 33 states rep
resented. Stanford led the uni
versities with seven graduates
(4 M.A.’s).

Other statistics which may be
of interest: five Negroes anci one
married couple. Most secondary
teachers will teach math, science,
French, English. Since history
and the social sciences were my
field of study, I am hoping to be
able to teach some subjects in
these areas also, in addition to
the Fiench courses I have been
assigned.
Ghana does not conform strict
ly to a commonly imagined Africa
of arid plateaus, pestilential
swamps or steaming noxious
jungles. From the geographical
point of view Ghana can be di
vided into three principal latitu
dinal zones which generally con
form to the broad bands that ex
tend through all of West Africa:
the coastal savannahs, the forest
(Editor’s note: This is a letter
from Rosemary George, a Stan
ford graduate now in the Peace
Corps in Ghana. The letter was
received by the Peace Corps Desk
of the Institute of International
Relations.)

Training began for Ghana at
Berkeley in June. We were ex
tremely fortunate to have an out
standing faculty of knowledge
able and experienced experts on
Ghana and Africa to guide our
learning, I would venture the
opinion that the intensity and
caliber of the instruction can be
directly correlated with the effec
tiveness and overall performance
of the Peace Corps Volunteer in
his assignment overseas. Our
eight-week program ran on a
five and one-half day class week
beginning at 8 a m. and usually
ending around 10 p.m., with time
out for lunch and dinner. In ad
dition to this rigorous class sched
ule, we managed to read exten
sively and compile several proj
ects.

The major emphasis of our
studies was Ghana, education in
Ghana (since we will all be teach
ers), and Africa in general. Al
though instruction in schools is
in English, the official language
of the country (Ghana was under
British rule as the Gold Coast
until independence in 1957), we
received daily instruction in Twi
from Twi-spcaking Ghanaians.
Twi is the dominant vernacular
of approximately 50 languages
and dialects spoken in Ghana.
ATTENTION was also given
to courses titled American
Studies and International Studies,
benefiting from the participation
of Cal professors in these lecture
discussion sessions.

Another aspect of our training
was to prepare use for maintain
ing our personal health and hy
giene in an area unblessed with
the amenities we take for granted
in America. Each of us has a
medical kit and is prepared to
render emergency treatment. I’m
hoping the occasion wall not arise
when I might be called upon to
assist in the delivery of a baby,
but for that too we are prepared.
A daily hour and a half of
physical fitness was designed
both to maintain and encourage
good physical condition and to
familiarize us with the games
played by Ghanaian youth, since
most of us will also be involved
with the athletic program of our
schools.

YOU MIGHT be wondering just
what kind of people become en
gaged in an endeavor of this na
ture. My impression is that PCV’s
are both realistic and idealistic:
realistic in the sense that they are
aware of the inherent danger in
the world situation today and
have a deep conviction that Amer
icans must live the ideals which
they have preached for so long—
peace freedom equality
individual worth human broth
erhood; idealistic in their belief
and hope that through contribut
ing two years of their life they
can assist in some small way in
the ultimate realization of these
ideals for all mankind.

dition to this rigorous class sched
ule, we managed to read exten
sively and compile several proj
ects.

The major emphasis of our
studies was Ghana, education in
Ghana (since we will all be teach
ers), and Africa in general. Al
though instruction in schools is
in English, the official language
of the country (Ghana was under
British rule as the Gold Coast
until independence in 1957), we
received daily instruction in Twi
from Twi-spcaking Ghanaians.
Twi is the dominant vernacular
of approximately 50 languages
and dialects spoken in Ghana.
ATTENTION was also given
to courses titled American
Studies and International Studies,
benefiting from the participation
of Cal professors in these lecture
discussion sessions.

Another aspect of our training
was to prepare use for maintain
ing our personal health and hy
giene in an area unblessed with
the amenities we take for granted
in America. Each of us has a
medical kit and is prepared to
render emergency treatment. I’m
hoping the occasion wall not arise
when I might be called upon to
assist in the delivery of a baby,
but for that too we are prepared.
A daily hour and a half of
physical fitness was designed
both to maintain and encourage
good physical condition and to
familiarize us with the games
played by Ghanaian youth, since
most of us will also be involved
with the athletic program of our
schools.

YOU MIGHT be wondering just
what kind of people become en
gaged in an endeavor of this na
ture. My impression is that PCV’s
are both realistic and idealistic:
realistic in the sense that they are
aware of the inherent danger in
the world situation today and
have a deep conviction that Amer
icans must live the ideals which
they have preached for so long—
peace freedom equality
individual worth human broth
erhood; idealistic in their belief
and hope that through contribut
ing two years of their life they
can assist in some small way in
the ultimate realization of these
ideals for all mankind.
Cui multum detum is the in
scription we read on our table
settings at every meal here at the
University of Ghana where we
are quartered during this two
week orientation period. This re
minder is meant for the univer
sity students, who form an edu
cated elite in a country which is
still over 50 per cent illiterate, I
feel it is even more appropriate
for us. How many warnings we
Americans have had in recent
years that much is required of
those to whom so much has been
given.

The average age of PCV’s tends
to be around 25, which is under
standable since this kind of proj
ect is more easily undertaken be
fore one has accepted certain re
sponsibilities. Our group is no ex
ception, except for an experienced
male chemistry teacher age 57.
Although some in our group have
advanced degrees and teaching
experience, the majority received
their A.B. or B.S. this June.
OF THE initial 85 candidates
the ratio of men to women was
about 3:1 (average for all
groups), which seems only natur
al to a Stanford woman! Califor
nia, with 13 trainees, rated high
est numerically of 33 states rep
resented. Stanford led the uni
versities with seven graduates
(4 M.A.’s).

Other statistics which may be
of interest: five Negroes anci one
married couple. Most secondary
teachers will teach math, science,
French, English. Since history
and the social sciences were my
field of study, I am hoping to be
able to teach some subjects in
these areas also, in addition to
the Fiench courses I have been
assigned.
Ghana does not conform strict
ly to a commonly imagined Africa
of arid plateaus, pestilential
swamps or steaming noxious
jungles. From the geographical
point of view Ghana can be di
vided into three principal latitu
dinal zones which generally con
form to the broad bands that ex
tend through all of West Africa:
the coastal savannahs, the forest

from Rosemary George, a Stan
ford graduate now in the Peace
Corps in Ghana. The letter was
received by the Peace Corps Desk
of the Institute of International
Relations.)

Training began for Ghana at
Berkeley in June. We were ex
tremely fortunate to have an out
standing faculty of knowledge
able and experienced experts on
Ghana and Africa to guide our
learning, I would venture the
opinion that the intensity and
caliber of the instruction can be
directly correlated with the effec
tiveness and overall performance
of the Peace Corps Volunteer in
his assignment overseas. Our
eight-week program ran on a
five and one-half day class week
beginning at 8 a m. and usually
ending around 10 p.m., with time
