# Fifth Monterey Jazz Festival Attracts Jazz World's Best
## 
### BRUCE WOLFE 
Even to the people who attend
them regularly and thus have a
feeling of what’s coming, jazz
festivals are unpredictable. Jazz
is basically improvised music,
and a jazz musician plays some
thing new on his horn every time
he picks it up; so one can never
predict how successful he will be
at communicating his emotion ar
tistically on any given day. (The

ly suspend the tortures of Ihe
damned.

Schifrin’s composition was
commissioned with the idea of
showing the influences of Span
ish, African. Caribbean, and Latin
American music on American
jazz, and it easily made jazz his
tory in its mirror-like ability to
reflect the profundity of the com
poser’s thinking.
SATURDAY afternoon’s uncer
tain sky set the mood for a per
formance which brought together
ten saxophonists in varying com
binations. While they were un
questionably virtuosi—e.g., Getz,
Desmond, Mulligan, Phil Woods,
James Moody,—they did not seem
prepared to offer more than an
ensemble opening, a series of
solos, and an ensemble close. The
group did, however, render Quin
cy Jones’ “The Midnight Sun Will
Never Set” with great brilliance
and skill.

Paul Desmond and Gerry Mul
ligan played a set and came up
with some thoughtful if some
what unconventional exchanges.
(Desmond later remarked to this
reporter that he had had some
“trouble” with his horn, and that
a forthcoming album with Mulli
gan should prove to be more co
herent.)
By Saturday evening, most
people in the sellout audience had
either bought pillows or their
cold, hard seats had benignly be
numbed them. The musicians,
however, ignored the cold and
fog and for three and a half
hours created, interpreted, >and
communicated in the unique idi
om that American jazz has made
available to the world.
AFTER A brief introduction
by (he Festival Orchestra. The
Gerry Mulligan Quartet, featur
ing Bob Brookmeyer on valve
trombone, provided about a half
hour of solid, very swinging mu
sic, in which “Blueport” and
“Open Country” seemed to be the
most applause-winning numbers.
A highlight of the evening was
to come from Lambert, Hendricks
and Bavan, next. With the Bru
beck rhythm section (Joe Morel
lo, drums; Eugene Wright, bass),
the trio thrilled everyone with its
versatility and charm. Dave Lam
bert soloed for about two minutes
and sang with such enthusiasm
that the audience was practically
singing with him.
The new member of the trio,
Miss Yolande Bavan, 19-year-old
Ceylonese jazz vocalist, made her
West Coast debut and displayed
considerable wit and beauty.
NEXT SET, Dave Brubeck and
Paul Desmond “reclaimed” their
rhythm section and gave the au
dience only a hint of their pro
digious talent and rare musical
compatibility. Desmond was ex
tremely lyrical, especially on
“Take Five,” but played for too
short a time.
Brubeck, using his familiar
block chord style (with a few as
sists from his poly rhythmic
hands), pounded out an exciting
and intricate rhythm superim
posed over his new 5/4 creation,
“Castilian Blues.”
Joe Morello, in a short, fiery
drum solo at the end of that
piece, demonstrated how far he
has extended the horizons of jazz
percussion. Bassist Wright kept
up a firm, pulsing background
rhythm.
SATURDAY night ended with
Quincy Jones leading the Festi
val Big Band. Phil Woods, James
Moody, Conte Condoli, and Bill
Perkins made contributions
which will be remembered by
those at the Festival for a very
long time.
The band’s presentation of
"The Midnight Sun Will Never
Set” and Charlie Mingus’ stan
dard “You Better Git It in Your
Soul” in Bossa Nova, a new Bra
zilian beat, made the last set a
moving and excellent finale to
an evening which had smooth or
ganization and a rare jazz “right
ness.”
