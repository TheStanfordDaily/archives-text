# Local AIESEC Seeks Applicants For Jobs Abroad
## 
### 
AIESEC will be conducting in
terviews in the next month for
qualified students seeking jobs
abroad. The Stanford local com
mittee will be looking for 30 to
50 students, preferably upper
classmen or graduates with some
economics background or busi
ness experience.
A traineeship arranged by
AIESEC involves three areas of
work. First the student must find
a job here for a foreign student.
The local and national commit
tees have contacts and resources
for making this task simpler, but
getting the job is essentially the
student’s responsibility.
Then the organization must
trade this job for one in another
country. This trading is done at
the international convention late
next winter.
PLACEMENT in the country
and the type of business desired
is dependent on the student’s
qualifications and his success in
getting a good traineeship for a
foreign student here.
Finally, the local committee is
responsible for following up the
jobs offered to incoming foreign
students. Reception and enter
tainment of these students is
often the most interesting part of
the work, aside from the experi
ence of working abroad oneself.
Stanford sent trainees to Ger
many, Franco, Scotland, Holland,
Peru, and Chile this summer.
Nick Davis, local committee pres
ident, predicts, “We see oppor
tunities for as many traineeships
next year as we are able to find
qualified students to fill.”
