number of musicians due to per
form increases.)
When the sun set on Monterey
County Fairgrounds thirteen eve
nings ago it is reasonable to
doubt that even one member of
the 7000 persons in the audience
knew exactly what sort of music
awaited him, for on that Friday
opening night. The Annual Mon
terey Jazz Festival began its fifth
season.
HERE’S what happened:
Friday night began as some of
the most distinguished musicians
and singers in the history of
jazz music—-Earl Hines, Ben Web
ster, Stuff Smith, Jimmy Rush
ing. Jimmy Witherspoon—came
on stage and performed. As the
artists expressed their particular
genre of emotion, the typically
chilly Monterey Peninsula air
seemed to loose its edge as the
audience lost interest in the tem
perature and drained what was
left in hip flasks.
While the Stan Getz Quartet
played beautifully and with much
originality, the significant musi
cal event of the evening was the
world premier of “The New Con
tinent,” a composition subtitled
as a “Divertimento for Jazz
Trumpet and Orchestra in Six
Movements,” by Boris “Lalo”
Schifrin.
SCHIFRIN, a 29-year-old Ar
gentinian composer and newdy
acquired pianist with the Dizzy
Gillespie Quintet, specified Gilles
pie as the solo trumpeter, while
the all-star Monterey Jazz Festi
val Orchestra backed him up.
The work was frankly a sensa
tion.
Gillespie played along with the
25-piece group’s elegantly written
part with such ease and feeling
that he seemed a modern Orphe
us, charming Hades to temporari-

zone, and the northern savannahs.
WE ARE engaged in an orien
tation period for these first two
weeks before we are sent to our
various schools in different sec
tions of the country. In addition
to hearing talks by officials in
the Ministry of Education of the
Ghana government and by au
thorities in various fields relating
to African culture, we have wit
nessed several traditional cere
monies in connection with annual
festivals of several ethnic groups;
and taken trips to various places
in southern Ghana including Ako
somba (site of the dam in con
struction as part of the $2BO mil
lion Volta River Project), Tema
(new harbor and port), Elmina
(Portuguese fortress built in
1482—the oldest European build
ing in the tropics).
On the evening agenda have
been a party at the residence of
the US Ambassador to Ghana,
Mr. Mahoney, and special activi
ties illustrating the dramatic and
musical talents of Ghanaians.

chilly Monterey Peninsula air
seemed to loose its edge as the
audience lost interest in the tem

cal event of the evening was the
world premier of “The New Con
tinent,” a composition subtitled
as a “Divertimento for Jazz
Trumpet and Orchestra in Six
Movements,” by Boris “Lalo”
Schifrin.

gentinian composer and newdy
acquired pianist with the Dizzy
Gillespie Quintet, specified Gilles
pie as the solo trumpeter, while
the all-star Monterey Jazz Festi
val Orchestra backed him up.
The work was frankly a sensa

25-piece group’s elegantly written
part with such ease and feeling
that he seemed a modern Orphe
us, charming Hades to temporari-

zone, and the northern savannahs.
WE ARE engaged in an orien
