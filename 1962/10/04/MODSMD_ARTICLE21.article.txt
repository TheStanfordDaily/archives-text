# Bruins, Cougars Are Air Threats; Cal Leans Heavily on Sophomores

This is the second half of an
article on flic AAWU football
teams other than Stanford.

UCLA will switch this year to
the T formation after 13 years of
single wing football. Head Coach

Bill Barnes intends to “retain the
best” of the prehistoric style in
his balanced line winged-T at
tack.
Two-year 1 letterman Ezell Sin
gleton is the squad’s most exper i
enced passer, but he will have to
adapt well to the T to beat out
Carl Jones, a ’61 redshirt, and
Sophomore Larry Zeno.
The Bruins will have two ca
pable receivers in Hermit Alex
ander and Mel Profit. Alexander,
one of the two or three top tun
ning backs on the Coast, was the
team’s leading receiver in 1961.
Mike Haffner, who last year be
came the greatest sophomore
ground gainer in UCLA history
with 703 yards at a 6.27 average,
will look good in the T-formation
also. Although now he can con
centrate mainly on running, Haff
ner will still be used in the run
ning-pass series.
From tackle to tackle UCLA
was hard hit by graduation but
figures to field a strong first
team line based on last year’s re
serves. For depth, the Bruins are
likely to rely heavily upon a
large seasonal migration of J.C.
material.
At the University of California,
where football is merely a sport
ing event and not an institution,
where football players are edu
cated as well as trained, academ
ically distinguished Coach Marv
Levy has gotten his hands on
some blue chip (defined by Dr.
Robley Williams, Cal faculty ath
letic representative, as the boy
who can star in the classroom as
well as on the field) talent.
Leading an outstanding crop of

sophomores who last year chose
Cal culture over all competing
brands are Craig Morton. 6-3, 210-
lb. quarterback; Dennis Peacocke
and Dave Rubin, halfbacks; and
235-pound fullback Mike Epstein.
Morton is not expected to see ac
tion until the middle of October,
hut with lettermen Larry Ballieit
and Randy Gold back, it is hard
ly a position that the Bears need
worry about.
Ends are one deep and tackles j
are untried but are expected to
be stronger and faster than in the
past two seasons. The guards led
by veteran John Erby are sound.
Center and fullback are the weak
est positions experience-wise with
no returning lettermen at either
spot.
To do well on a schedule almost
as disheartening as last year’s
Bear killer, Coach Levy will need
healthy lettermen, talented sophs
and more. Some of the more he
has. Junior College transfers—a
shockingly large contingent of 21
—have begun work at the East
Bay Ph.D. plant.
At Pullman (a medium-large
clearing in the eastern Washing
ton wheatfield for those who are
unfamiliar with the economic
geography of Idaho border
towns) big things have been hap
pening the last few years. Only
recently" elevated to university
status, the cow culture college
this year gained recognition of
its recent academic attainment
with the blessing of the Univer
sity of California’s Dr. Robley
Williams, an authority in these
matters, by being admitted to the
AAWU.
Coach Jim Sutherland has met
the challenge with a new look,
perhaps in a not hopeless attempt
to give football the appearance of
an academic discipline.
The Cougars, with only eight
seniors on an untested squad, in
clude seven Californians on their
starting eleven. Among them is
elusive Hugh Campbell, holder of
two national collegiate pass re
ceiving records—most yards in a
season (881) and most receptions
(66). Sutherland, who first gained
| fame for his good works among
various California high schools
S and junior colleges has not been
! reluctant to return to the scene of
I his former triumphs; WSU ex
pects much from this year’s
horde of transfers.
The Cougars have proven run
ning power in 205-pound George
Reed, a senior fullback. Clarence
Williams, an exceedingly fast
sophomore, has enough potential
to make Coach Sutherland regard
running with the ball as some
thing more than a desperation
measure.
State is eligible for the Rose
Bowl even though it plays only
Stanford and Washington of the
West’s academic Big Six. How
ever, Sutherland figures that the
Cougars will need at least an 8-2
record to be chosen in the annual
league voting.
