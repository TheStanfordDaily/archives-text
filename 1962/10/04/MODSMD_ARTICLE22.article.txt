# V-Day for S.F.
## 
### 
The San Francisco Giants
brought a major league cham
pionship in any sport, to San
Francisco for the first time, yes
terday, by boating the Dodgers,
6-4 in Los Angeles.
Having derived enough joy al
ready from this great baseball
conquest, we shall continue our
policy of sparing losing team
fans the trauma of reading de
tails of the game. However, we
suggest that as at least transient
inhabitants of California, we all
join together in supporting the
Giants against the 7-5 odds-fa
vored Yankees beginning today
at 12 in Candlestick Park.
