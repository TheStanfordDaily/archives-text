# Baker Will Lead Explosive Attack
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
Stop Terry Baker and you stop
Oregon State.
The above may not be strictly
true, but it comes close. Baker is
almost certainly the finest athlete
ever to play for OSU, and one of
the greatest college performers in
the country. He holds or shares
14 of Oregon State’s football rec
ords, and in the last three years
not a single Beaver press release
has failed to mention his name*
IN TWO seasons of varsity
competition, Baker has set career
records for both passing and total
offensive yardage. Switched as he
was from tailback to T formation
quarterback, Baker has contented
himself with throwing and com
pleting passes at a truly phenom
enal rate. In two games this sea
son. he has attempted 53 and
completed 27 for a .509 average,
385 yards and three touchdowns.
This paragon of football virtue
will lead Oregon State’s Beavers
when they meet Stanford this
Saturday afternoon in Stanford
Stadium.
The Northerners will be look
ing for some sort of satisfaction,
preferably in the form of a vic
tory over Stanford. Underdogs
last year by two touchdowns, the
Indians nonetheless pasted Tom
my Prothro’s Beavers 34-0 on the
Staters’ home field. This year the
roles will bo at least partially re
versed: Stanford’s victory over
Michigan State last week has con
vinced most observers that they
have the ability to handle Baker
and company.
STANFORD COACH Jack Cur
tice is at least one person who
isn’t writing the game off as an
Indian victory just yet, though.
Said Curtice, in a Stanford Buck
Club article last week: “Leon
McLaughlin scouted Oregon
State for us against lowa State,
and he is convinced our defense
is going to get no less a workout
against the offense-minded Bea
vers than against Michigan
State.”
Helping to make the OSU of
fense click is Vern Burke, a trans
fer from Bakersfield Junior Col
lege who has developed into the
Beavers’ best pass-catching end.
In two games he has picked up
229 yards and two touchdowns
with his 17 receptions.
IT WAS BUKKF and Baker all
the way in the Beavers’ wild open
ing game win over lowa State,
j Burke grabbed two of Baker’s
I passes for touchdowns in the 39-
1 35 victory, and Baker himself
| ran for three more scores.
Last week, the Beaver offense
i was less impressive, as lowa got
| a stellar performance from their
] own quarterback and won 28-8.
A big, fast lowa line held OSU to
a negative eight yards rushing,
although the midwesterners had

a little more difficulty with the
Beaver passing attack.
Dan Espalin and Dan Sieg head
a fast but very light halfback
contingent, and Bruce Williams
provides good straight-ahead
power at fullback.


TERRY BAKER, Oregon State quarterback, has nearly single-handedly carried the Beaver offense
this season. In two games he has
accounted for almost 500 yards
on the ground and in the air. He
has completed more than half his
passes, with one interception.
