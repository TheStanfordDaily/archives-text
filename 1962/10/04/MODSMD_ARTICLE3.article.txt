## 
### 
Maynard Toll, a senior in the
Humanities Honors program has
been selected to head the HR’s
United Nations desk. Toll, who
recently returned from a year in
Japan as a KEIO scholar, has al
ready formulated plans for a
Stanford United Nations.
The program of a “Model UN’’
for a single campus is a unique
and pioneer project at Stanford,
according to HR Administrative
Assistant Robert Whiteley.
The proposed SUN is expected
to involve a total of 500 students
with five-member delegations
from each campus living group
who will represent all 104 mem
ber nations of the UN.
Toll commented that “the SUN
is a project aimed at making
Stanford students more sophisti
cated on important details of the
United Nations and world prob
lems.”

Applications for living-group
chairmanships will be available
in residences within the next few
weeks.
