## 
### 
Stanford ranks first .. the West
and seventh nationally as the col
lege of presidents of the nation’s
largest industrial firms, reports
Heidriok and Struggles, a man
agement counseling firm.
The analysis shows that 40
per cent of top executives have a
bachelor's degree, and an addi
tional 25 per cent have obtained a
master’s degree.
Sixteen per cent attended col
lege, but received no degree. An
other 10 per cent never attended
college. However when confined
to the under-50 age group this
figure is reduced to three per
cent.
“The larger the company, the
better educated the president,”
found Heidrick and Struggles.
