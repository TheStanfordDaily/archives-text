# Bookstore Cuts Student Discount For Current Year
## 
### 
The student discount at the
Stanford bookstore has been cut
from ten to eight per cent for the
academic year.
The reason for the reduction,
says William A. Kimball, general
manager of the bookstore, is that
“if the store continued to pay a
ten per cent discount it would
start running at a loss.”
A steadily increasing volume of
book sales, on which the book
store has only a 20 per cent mark
up, and a corresponding decrease
in merchandise sales, which have
a 40 per cent mark-up, have cut
the net profit of the store to the
point where it is necessary to re
duce the discount, ho continued.
BOOK SALES account for 73
per cent of the total volume of
the store. Merchandise and sup
plies make up the other 27 per
cent. These figures, Kimball says,
are encouraging, because “the
primary objective of the book
store is to make available to stu
dents all necessary texts and
supplies.”
The secondary objective, he
adds, “is to have a general book
operation that will be a supple
ment to the educational process.
The high volume of book sales
shows that these objectives are in
the process of being realized.”
THE CHOICE, according to
Kimball, was between cutting the
discount and cutting the unique
services that the bookstore offers,
including special orders, books ar
ranged by subjects, and helpful
salespeople.
The bookstore cannot increase
its profits by raising the cost of
hooks, says Kimball, because, con
trary to popular misconception,
book prices are set by publishers
and not by individual bookstores.
The bookstore is a cooperative
enterprise, directed by a board
of Stanford professors. Any pos
sible profits are farmed back to
the students in the form of the
eight per cent discount, Kimball
emphasized.
