# Morgan Advocates Congressional Reform
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Making his first appearance on
the campus since his undergrad
uate days, news commentator Ed
ward P. Morgan spoke yesterday
on “Congressional Reform.”
To introduce his topic, Morgan
first spoke of a monumental para
dox between communist and free
world achievements.
OF THE two systems, theirs
has shown great failings and ours
has shown great strengths. The
communists are on the skids on
a long term basis; the vehicle of
communism is not a pleasant vehi
cle to ride with any comfort,”
stated Morgan. “Since the end
of World War 11, 46 new coun
tries have appeared—not a single
one has chosen communism.”
Turning to his basic theme of
congressional reform, the veteran
news commentator indicated that
there is more talk in Washington
about the necessity of reorganiz
ing Congress. “We spend $2 bil
lion a year on the ponies. Against
that, Congress has rejected, year
after year, a $1 billion plan—
spread over five years—to pro
mote federal aid to education.”
MORGAN further criticized the
House for not disposing of work
on its merits. His opinion was
that “It is overbalanced by rural
influence and seniority.” He cited
Congressman Howard Smith as

his example of the faults of the
seniority system of choosing com
mittee chairmen. “Howard Smith,
chairman of the House Rules
Committee, is able to check the
flow of hills to the floor so arbi
trarily that bills like Medicare,
that have the votes on the floor,
do not get out of committee.”
In regard to Congressional suc
cesses, the Peace Corps is one of
the most exciting things that ever
came out of Washington. These
missionary contacts will help the
image of young people and give
the younger generation a feeling
of importance. Morgan later dis
closed that business has been so
impressed by the recruiting of
Peace Corps members that IBM
and Pepsi Cola, both international
firms, have asked for permission
to watch Peace Corps members so
they may be able to secure their
services when they leave the
Corps.
During the question and answer
period, when asked to name spe
cific Congressional reforms, Mor
gan suggested the possibility of
a unicameral legislature, rein
statement of the 21-day rule, and
further expansion of the House
Rules Committee. The 21 day rule
would permit rules to be auto
matically sent to the House floor
if no action was taken by the
Rules Committee.
IN' RESPONSE TO a question
concerning the administration’s
relations with Congress, Morgan
pointed out (hat the president has
been too diffident in his demands
of Congress. Also concerning the
president, he added, “Regardless
of the moral issue, it was a great
mistake for Ted Kennedy to run
for national office. It will give
the Republicans an argument of
‘Grab for power’, an argument
that would be unfounded.”

communism is not a pleasant vehi
cle to ride with any comfort,”
stated Morgan. “Since the end
of World War 11, 46 new coun
tries have appeared—not a single
one has chosen communism.”
Turning to his basic theme of
congressional reform, the veteran
news commentator indicated that
there is more talk in Washington
about the necessity of reorganiz
ing Congress. “We spend $2 bil
lion a year on the ponies. Against
that, Congress has rejected, year
after year, a $1 billion plan—
spread over five years—to pro
mote federal aid to education.”
MORGAN further criticized the
House for not disposing of work
on its merits. His opinion was
that “It is overbalanced by rural
influence and seniority.” He cited
Congressman Howard Smith as

his example of the faults of the
seniority system of choosing com
mittee chairmen. “Howard Smith,
chairman of the House Rules
Committee, is able to check the
flow of hills to the floor so arbi
trarily that bills like Medicare,
that have the votes on the floor,
do not get out of committee.”
In regard to Congressional suc
cesses, the Peace Corps is one of
the most exciting things that ever
came out of Washington. These
missionary contacts will help the
image of young people and give
the younger generation a feeling
of importance. Morgan later dis
closed that business has been so
impressed by the recruiting of
Peace Corps members that IBM
and Pepsi Cola, both international
firms, have asked for permission
to watch Peace Corps members so
they may be able to secure their
services when they leave the
Corps.
During the question and answer
period, when asked to name spe
cific Congressional reforms, Mor
gan suggested the possibility of
a unicameral legislature, rein
statement of the 21-day rule, and
further expansion of the House
Rules Committee. The 21 day rule
would permit rules to be auto
matically sent to the House floor
if no action was taken by the
Rules Committee.
IN' RESPONSE TO a question
concerning the administration’s
relations with Congress, Morgan
pointed out (hat the president has
been too diffident in his demands
of Congress. Also concerning the
president, he added, “Regardless
of the moral issue, it was a great
mistake for Ted Kennedy to run
for national office. It will give
the Republicans an argument of
‘Grab for power’, an argument
that would be unfounded.”
Making his first appearance on
the campus since his undergrad
uate days, news commentator Ed
ward P. Morgan spoke yesterday
on “Congressional Reform.”
To introduce his topic, Morgan
first spoke of a monumental para
dox between communist and free
world achievements.
OF THE two systems, theirs
has shown great failings and ours
has shown great strengths. The
communists are on the skids on
a long term basis; the vehicle of
communism is not a pleasant vehi
cle to ride with any comfort,”
stated Morgan. “Since the end
of World War 11, 46 new coun
