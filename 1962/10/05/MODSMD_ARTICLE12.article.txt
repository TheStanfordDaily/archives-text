# 'Fluster Frolick' 'Fords Farm Fun
## 
### 
Most of the time “fluster”
means “to confuse, to agitate, to
muddle,” but from 4:30-6:30 p.m.
tomorrow it will mean “to twist
and to see two new fraternity
houses” at the “Fluster Frolic.’
The after-game open house and
dance is co-sponsored by Florence
Moore, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and
Theta Delta Chi. Here is your
chance ot see what the new clus
ters look like inside.
The music will be provided by
the Lancers. Dancing will be in
the cluster parking lot.
