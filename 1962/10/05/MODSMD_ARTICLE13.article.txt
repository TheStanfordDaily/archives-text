# 'Laser' Creators Receive Medals
## 
### 
Stuart Ballantine Medals will
be awarded to the two origina
tors of “laser," science’s remark
able new source of ‘coherent
light.” The presentations will be
made at Oct. 17 “Medal Day Ex
ercises” of the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology.
Professor Arthur L. Schawlow
of Stanford and Provost Charles
H. Townes of M.I.T. will receive
these gold medals of the Frank
lin Institute of Philadelphia, one
of America’s oldest scientific or
ganizations.
Unlike rdinary light, the laser
generates light waves of a single
frequency and wavelength. This
coherent light gives a narrow,
non-spreading beam which is
thousands of times more intense
than sunlight.
The laser can be made from
gases and solids, such as rubies.
It has great potential in industry
and science.
A laser beam when focused
can burn through any material,
including diamonds.
Other suggested uses include
spot-welding of tissues in sur
gery, carrier beam for multitudes
of radio and television channels,
and transmitting power to satel
lites.
