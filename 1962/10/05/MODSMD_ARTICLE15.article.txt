### 
Yesterday’s announcement that the faculty’s Student Affairs
and Services Committee will include five students is welcome news
to students who take an interest in how the University is run.
r lhe five students who are finally selected for the committee will
have the opportunity to discuss with faculty and administrators
problems that are especially concerned with student life.
"The committee traditionally has discussed matters brought to
its attention by the Dean or some other outside agency. It acts
as an advisory body to the President, who also appoints its mem
bers. It was this committee which last year spent six months
studying the advisability of a change in liquor regulations. This
year it may consider among other things women’s overnights.
Next Tuesday is the date for the committee’s next meeting,
and by that time President Sterling will probably have selected
the live student representatives from the list of eight nominees
drawn up by ASSU President Arinin Rosencranz. The five stu
dents comprising one tilth of the committee membership will have
voting rights although in executive session they may lie asked
to leave.
Professor Hutchinson of the Chemistry Department, chairman
of the committee, has remarked that the committee will consider
anything that students want done within the University. This is
the beginning of a program that will allow students to take part
in the policy-making deliberations of faculty-administration
bodies that recommend or institute change.
