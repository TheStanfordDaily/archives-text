## Meredith Affair Handled Well By President, Attorney-General 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The President and the Attorney-General have done well by the
country in their handling of the Mississippi affair. They have used
force without bluster, never forgetting that (he inevitable wounds
must be helped to heal. For myselt I feel, as I have not felt since the
Cuban fiasco of 1961, that the President has become the accomplished

master of the enormous forces
he commands. For his reward in
Mississippi, he has crushed Gov.
Barnett’s rebellion and has earned
the preponderant assent of lead
ing and enlightened opinion in
the South.

segregation in public schools is
unconstitutional. The resentment
at this decision has been the nu
cleus of other resentments
against the Federal government,
against taxes, welfare measures,
industrial and agricultural regu
lation, and the like. This cluster
of resentments against the Feder
al power is the basis of the Radi
cal Right, extending all the way
from the romantic Goldwater to
such rowdies as Gen. Walker.
In a great continental federa
tion like ours there will probably
never be a time when local com
munities, believing that their way
of life is threatened by the cen
tral government, will not try to
resist. At the present time the
hard core of the resistance is to
integration in the public schools.
Although the President has suc
cessfully upheld the law in the
University of Mississippi, resist
ance to integration will not soon
melt away. It will persist, and
when the troops and the mar
shals have been withdrawn, it is
almost certain to recur.
IT WILL recur unless the Fed
eral government does what it has
not done since the Supreme Court
decision. It has never worked out
a policy, it has never negotiated
a plan and an understanding,
with the enlightened leaders of
the Southern states, where, as in
Mississippi and in Alabama, the
problem is acute. It is not a suffi
cient policy to be prepared to use
Federal forces to back the individ
ual man or child who has obtain
ed, or has had obtained for him, a
decision from a Federal court.
That is no doubt law enforcement.
What is needed is to win consent
in states like Mississippi for a
policy of law observance.
My own hope, based on the ac
tion of most Southern states from
Louisiana to Virginia, is that a
policy might be worked out by
negotiation which would be based
on this principle: that in the
Deep South desegregation should
begin with the education of the
Negro elite of lawyers, doctors,
engineers, ministers, teachers,
and journalists, and that for the
near future the really difficult
problems of integrating the co
educational high schools shall not
be pressed. Mr. Meredith is a
good symbol of such a policy. He
is not an adolescent. He is in fact
29, he is married and has a fam
ily, and he is a veteran. Quite evi
dently, he is on the way to being
a leader in the delicate relations
between the two races in his
state.
I know that this approach runs
contrary to the abstract principle
of legal equality. But I believe it
deals with the problem of how—
with all the deliberate speed that
the realities permit—the princi
ple can eventually be carried out.

The only mistake he made was
that in his desire to conciliate the
people of Mississippi he trusted
the Governor too much. He trust
ed the Governor to use the state
police forces to prevent

mob violence.
As it turned out,
the Governor let
the mob try to
do what he had
boasted he would
do but in the
event could not
do. He had de
clared that the
police forces of
the state of Mis
ie interposed to
prevent me eniorcement of the
Federal law. But when he was
faced with the Federal forces, he
abandoned that threat and instead
allowed the state forces to let the
mob attack the Federal marshals.
This was a sordid ending to the
doctrine of interpositoin.
THE DOCTRINE itself has
been put forth recurrently for
over 160 years. Its original au
thors were Jefferson and Madison
who, in their efforts to nullify
the hateful Alien and Sedition
Laws passed by the Federalists,
drafted resolutions for the state
governments of Virginia and
Kentucky. The resolutions assert
ed the right of a state to nullify
a law which it considered to be a
violation of the constitution.
The resolutions were never act
ed upon because after Jefferson’s
election in 1800 the Alien and Se
dition Laws were repealed. Never
theless, in 1803 Chief Justice
Marshall in the famous case of
Marbury vs. Madison laid down
the paramount rule of our consti
tutional system that “it -is em
phatically the province and duty
of the Judicial Department to say
what the law is.”

The idea of interposition recur
red on Nov. 24, 1832, when the
legislature of South Carolina
voted to nullify the co-ealled
“Tariff of Abominations,” which
had been passed by Congress. To
this “Ordinance of Nullification”
President Andrew Jackson re
plied in a proclamation of Dec.
10, 1832, declaring that “I con
sider, then, the power to annul a
law of the United States, assumed
by one state, incompatible with
the existence of the Union.”
SINCE interposition is in effect
secession from the Union, that
was the basic issue decided by the
Civil War.
The theory of interposition, nul
lification, and even secession
came alive again after 1954 when

President Andrew Jackson re

The President and the Attorney-General have done well by the
country in their handling of the Mississippi affair. They have used
force without bluster, never forgetting that (he inevitable wounds

Cuban fiasco of 1961, that the President has become the accomplished

master of the enormous forces

Barnett’s rebellion and has earned
the preponderant assent of lead

segregation in public schools is
unconstitutional. The resentment
at this decision has been the nu
cleus of other resentments
against the Federal government,
against taxes, welfare measures,
industrial and agricultural regu
lation, and the like. This cluster
of resentments against the Feder
al power is the basis of the Radi
cal Right, extending all the way
from the romantic Goldwater to
such rowdies as Gen. Walker.
In a great continental federa
tion like ours there will probably
never be a time when local com
munities, believing that their way
of life is threatened by the cen
tral government, will not try to
resist. At the present time the
hard core of the resistance is to
integration in the public schools.
Although the President has suc
cessfully upheld the law in the
University of Mississippi, resist
ance to integration will not soon
melt away. It will persist, and
when the troops and the mar
shals have been withdrawn, it is
almost certain to recur.
IT WILL recur unless the Fed
eral government does what it has
not done since the Supreme Court
decision. It has never worked out
a policy, it has never negotiated
a plan and an understanding,
with the enlightened leaders of
the Southern states, where, as in
Mississippi and in Alabama, the
problem is acute. It is not a suffi
cient policy to be prepared to use
Federal forces to back the individ
ual man or child who has obtain
ed, or has had obtained for him, a
decision from a Federal court.
That is no doubt law enforcement.
What is needed is to win consent
in states like Mississippi for a
policy of law observance.
My own hope, based on the ac
tion of most Southern states from
Louisiana to Virginia, is that a
policy might be worked out by
negotiation which would be based
on this principle: that in the
Deep South desegregation should
begin with the education of the
Negro elite of lawyers, doctors,
engineers, ministers, teachers,
and journalists, and that for the
near future the really difficult
problems of integrating the co
educational high schools shall not
be pressed. Mr. Meredith is a
good symbol of such a policy. He
is not an adolescent. He is in fact
29, he is married and has a fam
ily, and he is a veteran. Quite evi
dently, he is on the way to being
a leader in the delicate relations
between the two races in his
state.
I know that this approach runs
contrary to the abstract principle
of legal equality. But I believe it
deals with the problem of how—
with all the deliberate speed that
the realities permit—the princi
ple can eventually be carried out.

In a great continental federa
tion like ours there will probably
never be a time when local com
munities, believing that their way
of life is threatened by the cen
tral government, will not try to
resist. At the present time the
hard core of the resistance is to
integration in the public schools.
Although the President has suc
cessfully upheld the law in the
University of Mississippi, resist
ance to integration will not soon
melt away. It will persist, and
when the troops and the mar

almost certain to recur.
IT WILL recur unless the Fed
eral government does what it has
not done since the Supreme Court
decision. It has never worked out
a policy, it has never negotiated
a plan and an understanding,
with the enlightened leaders of
the Southern states, where, as in
Mississippi and in Alabama, the
problem is acute. It is not a suffi
cient policy to be prepared to use
Federal forces to back the individ
ual man or child who has obtain
ed, or has had obtained for him, a
decision from a Federal court.
That is no doubt law enforcement.
What is needed is to win consent
in states like Mississippi for a
policy of law observance.
My own hope, based on the ac
tion of most Southern states from
Louisiana to Virginia, is that a
policy might be worked out by
negotiation which would be based
on this principle: that in the
Deep South desegregation should
begin with the education of the
Negro elite of lawyers, doctors,
engineers, ministers, teachers,
and journalists, and that for the
near future the really difficult
problems of integrating the co
educational high schools shall not
be pressed. Mr. Meredith is a
good symbol of such a policy. He
is not an adolescent. He is in fact
29, he is married and has a fam
ily, and he is a veteran. Quite evi
dently, he is on the way to being
a leader in the delicate relations
between the two races in his
state.
I know that this approach runs
contrary to the abstract principle
of legal equality. But I believe it
deals with the problem of how—
with all the deliberate speed that
the realities permit—the princi
ple can eventually be carried out.
