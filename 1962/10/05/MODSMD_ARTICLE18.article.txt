# IIR to Host Peace Corps, EEC Talks
## 
### KENT SMITH 
The Institute of International
Relations, whose object is to keep
the Stanford student informed on
world affairs, starts the new year
with major conferences on the
Peace Corps and the Atlantic
Community.
Early in November the Peace
Corps will be the center of atten
tion. The HR staff, directed by
President Scott Thompson, is now
planning the conference, intended
both to generate interest in the
Corps and to report Corps prog
ress.
TOP OFFICIALS from the
Washington headquarters and
from posts abroad will partici
pate. Under the theme, “The
Peace Corps in Action,” the con
ference will feature a detailed
presentation of the life and work
of the volunteer in the field.
The specific problem of “Com
munity Development” will be the
subject of many of the confer
ence’s individual talks and dis
cussions. Professor David Aptcr
from the University of California,
who helped train the first group
of volunteers for service in Ghana,
will also be present.
For general information con
cerning all phases of the Corps,
the HR has recently established
the Peace Corps Desk.
HEADED by Ann Chamberlain,
the Desk, in addition to taking a
large part in preparing the forth
coming Peace Corps Conference,
will continue sponsoring related
speeches, films and seminars dur
ing the rest of the year.
Partly because of the early ef
forts of the Peace Corps Desk,
more volunteers, per capita, have
been accepted from Stanford than
from most other universities in
the country. Some of these Stan
ford volunteers are corresponding
with Desk members and are pub
lishing observations in The Daily.
“The Atlantic Community” will
be the theme of the second major
HR conference, scheduled for De
cember. King Jones, Conferences
Vice-President, is planning to fea
ture a number of seminars, led
by experts and open to direct par
ticipation by any student.
UNDERSECRETARY of Com
merce Hickman Price—who play
ed a key role in designing Presi
dent Kennedy’s new Foreign
Trade Bill—and Dr. Karl Brandt
—a former member of Eisenhow
er’s Council of Economic Advisers
—wall both speak to the Confer
ence.
The impact of the Common
Market and the prospects for
greater unity across the Atlantic
will be discussed and debated in
panels and the open seminars.
Invitations to the conference have
also been extended to such lead
ers as Averill Harriman and Har
ry Truman.
As a prelude to “The Atlantic
Community,” a number of au
thorities are now presenting in
troductory lectures on related
topics. Dr. Villem Van Slobbe, an
agricultural official of the Com
mon Market, will give the next
lecture in the series on October
11.
The International Student Di
vision has been one of the busiest
groups on campus the last few
weeks. Directly concerned with
the foreign student and his inte
gration into Stanford life, the
group carried out the Foreign
Student Pre-Registration and
prepared the 125 newcomers for
the eccentricities of American
living.
This year, Gordon Adams, Vice-
President of the Division, is set
ting up a new program which will
give both foreign and American
students an opportunity to meet
and exchange views across the
dinner table. This International
Dining Program will be open to
any University group eating to
gether and will arrange for stu
dents from abroad to come at
regular times during the week to
meals.
FOR STUDENTS with special
interests in major world areas,
the HR has developed the Desks
system, under the Afliliations Di
vision. The Latin American Desk,
for example, centers its work on
news and events of importance to
the Spanish American scene and
publishes “El Estudiante,” a mul
tilingual report of student opin
ion on Latin American affairs.
African affairs have burst into
world-wide prominence in the last
few years, and the African Desk
plays one of the most active parts
within the HR. This year Dave
Beim will direct related activities,
especially the annual Africa
Week, a program of films, native
speakers, experts’ lectures and
seminars. Similar desks focus
their interest and work on Rus
sia, Asia, and the Middle East.
Every year the HR publishes
“The Bridge,” a magazine de
voted to increasing international
understanding. The articles and
reports featured in “The Bridge”
are put together under the direc
tion of Bill Rentz and the Educa
tion Division. The Division also
organizes charter flights to Eu
rope during the summer and
plans the annual High School
Conference on world affairs.

the Stanford student informed on
world affairs, starts the new year
with major conferences on the
Peace Corps and the Atlantic
Community.
Early in November the Peace
Corps will be the center of atten
tion. The HR staff, directed by
President Scott Thompson, is now
planning the conference, intended
both to generate interest in the
Corps and to report Corps prog
ress.
TOP OFFICIALS from the
Washington headquarters and
from posts abroad will partici
pate. Under the theme, “The
Peace Corps in Action,” the con
ference will feature a detailed
presentation of the life and work
of the volunteer in the field.
The specific problem of “Com
munity Development” will be the
subject of many of the confer
ence’s individual talks and dis
cussions. Professor David Aptcr
from the University of California,
who helped train the first group
of volunteers for service in Ghana,
will also be present.
For general information con
cerning all phases of the Corps,
the HR has recently established
the Peace Corps Desk.
HEADED by Ann Chamberlain,
the Desk, in addition to taking a
large part in preparing the forth
coming Peace Corps Conference,
will continue sponsoring related
speeches, films and seminars dur
ing the rest of the year.
Partly because of the early ef
forts of the Peace Corps Desk,
more volunteers, per capita, have
been accepted from Stanford than
from most other universities in
the country. Some of these Stan
ford volunteers are corresponding
with Desk members and are pub
lishing observations in The Daily.
“The Atlantic Community” will
be the theme of the second major
HR conference, scheduled for De
cember. King Jones, Conferences
Vice-President, is planning to fea
ture a number of seminars, led
by experts and open to direct par
ticipation by any student.
UNDERSECRETARY of Com
merce Hickman Price—who play
ed a key role in designing Presi
dent Kennedy’s new Foreign
Trade Bill—and Dr. Karl Brandt
—a former member of Eisenhow
er’s Council of Economic Advisers
—wall both speak to the Confer
ence.
The impact of the Common
Market and the prospects for
greater unity across the Atlantic
will be discussed and debated in
panels and the open seminars.
Invitations to the conference have
also been extended to such lead
ers as Averill Harriman and Har
ry Truman.
As a prelude to “The Atlantic
Community,” a number of au
thorities are now presenting in
troductory lectures on related
topics. Dr. Villem Van Slobbe, an
agricultural official of the Com
mon Market, will give the next
lecture in the series on October
11.
The International Student Di
vision has been one of the busiest
groups on campus the last few
weeks. Directly concerned with
the foreign student and his inte
gration into Stanford life, the
group carried out the Foreign
Student Pre-Registration and
prepared the 125 newcomers for
the eccentricities of American
living.
This year, Gordon Adams, Vice-
President of the Division, is set
ting up a new program which will
give both foreign and American
students an opportunity to meet
and exchange views across the
dinner table. This International
Dining Program will be open to
any University group eating to
gether and will arrange for stu
dents from abroad to come at
regular times during the week to
meals.
FOR STUDENTS with special
interests in major world areas,
the HR has developed the Desks
system, under the Afliliations Di
vision. The Latin American Desk,
for example, centers its work on
news and events of importance to
the Spanish American scene and
publishes “El Estudiante,” a mul
tilingual report of student opin
ion on Latin American affairs.
African affairs have burst into
world-wide prominence in the last
few years, and the African Desk
plays one of the most active parts
within the HR. This year Dave
Beim will direct related activities,
especially the annual Africa
Week, a program of films, native
speakers, experts’ lectures and
seminars. Similar desks focus
their interest and work on Rus
sia, Asia, and the Middle East.
Every year the HR publishes
“The Bridge,” a magazine de
voted to increasing international
understanding. The articles and
reports featured in “The Bridge”
are put together under the direc
tion of Bill Rentz and the Educa
tion Division. The Division also
organizes charter flights to Eu
rope during the summer and
plans the annual High School
Conference on world affairs.

Peace Corps and the Atlantic
Community.
Early in November the Peace
Corps will be the center of atten
tion. The HR staff, directed by
President Scott Thompson, is now
planning the conference, intended
both to generate interest in the
Corps and to report Corps prog
ress.
TOP OFFICIALS from the
Washington headquarters and
from posts abroad will partici
pate. Under the theme, “The
Peace Corps in Action,” the con
ference will feature a detailed
presentation of the life and work
of the volunteer in the field.
The specific problem of “Com
munity Development” will be the
subject of many of the confer
ence’s individual talks and dis
cussions. Professor David Aptcr
from the University of California,
who helped train the first group
of volunteers for service in Ghana,
will also be present.
For general information con
cerning all phases of the Corps,
the HR has recently established
the Peace Corps Desk.
HEADED by Ann Chamberlain,
the Desk, in addition to taking a
large part in preparing the forth
coming Peace Corps Conference,
will continue sponsoring related
speeches, films and seminars dur
ing the rest of the year.
Partly because of the early ef
forts of the Peace Corps Desk,
more volunteers, per capita, have
been accepted from Stanford than
from most other universities in
the country. Some of these Stan
ford volunteers are corresponding
with Desk members and are pub
lishing observations in The Daily.
“The Atlantic Community” will
be the theme of the second major
HR conference, scheduled for De
cember. King Jones, Conferences
Vice-President, is planning to fea
ture a number of seminars, led
by experts and open to direct par
ticipation by any student.
UNDERSECRETARY of Com
merce Hickman Price—who play
ed a key role in designing Presi
dent Kennedy’s new Foreign
Trade Bill—and Dr. Karl Brandt
—a former member of Eisenhow
er’s Council of Economic Advisers
—wall both speak to the Confer
ence.
The impact of the Common
Market and the prospects for
greater unity across the Atlantic
will be discussed and debated in
panels and the open seminars.
Invitations to the conference have
also been extended to such lead
ers as Averill Harriman and Har
ry Truman.
As a prelude to “The Atlantic
Community,” a number of au
thorities are now presenting in
troductory lectures on related
topics. Dr. Villem Van Slobbe, an
agricultural official of the Com
mon Market, will give the next
lecture in the series on October
11.
The International Student Di
vision has been one of the busiest
groups on campus the last few
weeks. Directly concerned with
the foreign student and his inte
gration into Stanford life, the
group carried out the Foreign
Student Pre-Registration and
prepared the 125 newcomers for
the eccentricities of American
living.
This year, Gordon Adams, Vice-
President of the Division, is set
ting up a new program which will
give both foreign and American
students an opportunity to meet
and exchange views across the
dinner table. This International
Dining Program will be open to
any University group eating to
gether and will arrange for stu
dents from abroad to come at
regular times during the week to
meals.
FOR STUDENTS with special
interests in major world areas,
the HR has developed the Desks
system, under the Afliliations Di
vision. The Latin American Desk,
for example, centers its work on
news and events of importance to
the Spanish American scene and
publishes “El Estudiante,” a mul
tilingual report of student opin
ion on Latin American affairs.
African affairs have burst into
world-wide prominence in the last
few years, and the African Desk
plays one of the most active parts
within the HR. This year Dave
Beim will direct related activities,
especially the annual Africa
Week, a program of films, native
speakers, experts’ lectures and
seminars. Similar desks focus
their interest and work on Rus
sia, Asia, and the Middle East.
Every year the HR publishes
“The Bridge,” a magazine de
voted to increasing international
understanding. The articles and
reports featured in “The Bridge”
are put together under the direc
tion of Bill Rentz and the Educa
tion Division. The Division also
organizes charter flights to Eu
rope during the summer and
plans the annual High School
Conference on world affairs.
