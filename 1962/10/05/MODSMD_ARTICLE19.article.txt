## 'Weinig Adds to War Hysteria By Advocating Cuba Invasion' 
### PETER EISENBERG SAUL LANDAU 
The current hysteria in misin
formed circles over the military
capabilities and intentions of Fi
del Castro’s government in Cuba
has made its neurotic debut at
Stanford in the form of Mr. Wei
nig’s “Invade Cuba Now” column.
What are the facts? Because of
election - minded congressmen,
sensation-seeking editors, travel
bans and press censorship both in
and out of Cuba, these facts are
hard to determine. Officially the
U.S. government has announced
the existence of some ground to
air missiles with a range of 25
miles; certain tanks and heavy
artillery; and some MIG jets (but
not 257) which arrived after the
April 1961 invasion by U.S.-backed
counterrevolutionaries demon
strated Cuba’s vulnerability to
bomber raids. Cuba no\v chooses
to defend herself with more
modern weapons, a legitimate
right of all nations.
NOT ONE embassy in Havana
nor one responsible foreign re
porter has mentioned the pres
ence of any non-Cuban troops: no
Russian soldiers nor Chinese, nor
East Europeans, nor Ghanians,
nor Martians.
The most, reliable story, issued
by President John F. Kennedy
and the U.S. State Department as
well as by the British Embassy in
Hanava is the following: Some
1500 Soviet technicians arrived in
Cuba in late July and early Au
gust to replace technicians who
had completed their assignments.
There is a total of about 4,000
such technicians in Cuba. Soviet
supply shipments to Cuba, which
began in the summer of 1960
when the U.S. companies cut off
Cuba’s oil supply and the U.S.
government cut Cuba’s sugar
market, have continued carrying
needed foods and industrial equip
ment. This process is called trade.
What then is the nature of the
Cuban “threat”? Firstly, its na
ture has not changed in essence
since Castro accepted Communist
aid in 1960. The sudden hysteria
over tehcnicians and supplies indi
cates a crisis in U.S. politics and
journalism rather than a new'
threat in Cuba.
SECONDLY, it is obvious that
Castro wants to spread his revo
lution to other parts of the hemis
phere. just as the U.S. wants to
spread its ideals, sweetened by
the Alliance for Progress. If Cas
tro stirs popular “revolutions of
rising expectations” to the extent
that the U.S. was forced to launch
a $2O billion program to handle
this enthusiasm, W'hy should Cas
tro suddenly change to a tactic
of force, which would only pro
voke the opposition of other Latin
American countries as well as of
the U.S.?
Thirdly, the nature of Castro’s
threat is too profound to be
scotched by a brutal and bloody
war. Should Castro he attacked,
the followers of Francisco Juliao
in northeastern Brazil, Jacinto
Lopez and Reuben Jaramillo in
rural Mexico, young Venezuelan
Marine officers and other popular
young Latin American leftists
would grow and increase, aided
by the image of the heroic Cuban
martyr. Does Mr. Weinig expect
the U.S. to send the Marines to
crush these "revolutions of rising
expectations” also?
MB. WEINIG writes of moral
considerations: “What of the Cu
ban people’s right to self-determin
ation?” If self-determination can

be reflected in popular leadership,
there is self-determination in
Cuba, for the vast majority of the
Cuban people did choose Castro
and continue to support him, un
like the Haitians, Nicaraguans,
Paraguayans, Guatemalans, and
Argentines whose government s
the U.S. has not thought of over
throwing (at least not since 1954).
Fidel is popular. A ruler that
is hated, or even unpopular, does
not arm more than half a million
militia men and women. Actual
eyewitness reports appearing in
“The Nation,” “L’Express,” “Le
Monde.” Siompre,” “Novos Ru
mos," “New Times,” and other
journals estimate Castro’s popu
larity at about 75 per cent or
more. Both U.S. and European
journalists have stated that Fi
del's popularity rose after the
Bay of Pigs invasion because,
rather than welcoming the in
vaders, the Cubans detest (with
good historical reason) any in
vasion of their land by a foreign
military power. U.S. Marines
rpade three excursions to Cuba,
and for those Cubans who were
not around to experience them,
their fathers and grandfathers are
only too happy to fill them in on
all the gory details. Mr. Weinig
sees the U.S. as the great libera
tor. Most of Latin America sees
the U.S. as the great invader, con
stantly intervening with brutish
and bullyish force in issues that
are none of her business.
MR. WEINIG’S column demon
strates a striking example of
paranoid ethnocentrism. Using
his argument about the threat of
a nuclear striking force, 90 miles
from home (a threat which does
not exist according to the
“threatened” U.S. government
and President), then the Soviet
Union and China would he per
fectly justified in invading Tur
key, Norway, Pakistan, Thailand.
Formosa, and even Japan and the
Philippines.
Mr. Weinig fears that more
American and Cuban lives will be
lost the longer the invasion de
cision is postponed. Mr. Weinig
obviously does not consider the
very strong possibility that an in
vasion could start World War 111.
Political morality as defined by
our founding fathers requires a
government of laws, supreme,
and not of men. There are laws
and treaties which legally and
morally obligate the United
States: An invasion of Cuba
would violate the Charters of the
UN and OAS, as well as U.S.
Neutrality Laws.
MR. WEINIG concludes by re
porting about what “Veteran
American intelligence officers in
Cuba have informed the Penta
gon.” If there are veteran intel
ligence officers in Cuba, how does
Mr. Weinig know about them, or
has he a secret pipeline to the
CIA which reports first to him.
before advising the President?
More likely, Mr. Weinig refers to
veterans like General Edwin
Walker for his sources of infor
mation.
So when broken down, Mr. Wei
nig’s argument is based on rea
soning which is paranoic and sui
cidal and information wtiich is
blatantly absurd. We suggest that
before advising the U.S. to betray
its treaties and to declare what
might become World War 111. he
get his facts straight and then
take an elementary course in
Logic, and perhaps one in Ethics.
Were it not for the fact that
many “responsible” men have
taken the same position, Mr. Wei
nig could be dismissed as a lone
crackpot. Unfortunately this sui
cidal madness has many advo
cates. This crackpot “reality”
may be the death of us all.
