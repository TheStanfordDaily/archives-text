# MOVIE REVIEW
## Lolita Merits C+ Rating As Paradise-lust Is Lost

“If you were in my class,” says
Professor Humbert, “I would
give you an A-plus.” Lolita’s lips
curl invitingly. Humbert looks at
her with lust bulging from his
eyesockets. She picks her nose.

The whole movie is a nose
picker and not worth much more
than C-plus. A 150-minute effort
to trace the gradual psychological
wreckage of a man who is ob
sessed with a sexual desire for a
young girl, the movie is afraid to
acknowledge that there is much
of anything perverse about the
perversion which is the basis of
the story. It tries to be suggestive
but is embarrassed about what it
wants to suggest. The result is a
dry chronicle of a loveless love
and a sexless seduction which
loses whatever meaning was in
tended in Vladimir Nabokov’s
novel.

THE IMMEDIATE and obvious
reason for the failure to disturb
or even involve the viewer is Miss
Sue Lyon, who is cast as Lolita.
If this girl is a knock-kneed pu
bescent, so is Casey Stengel, No
body is going to get disgusted
with Humbert for wanting her,

especially if his only alternative
is Lolita’s blatant and grabby
mama.

James Mason has the role of
Humbert Humbert, the professor
who shows up in little Ramsdale,
N.H., to spend the summer with
peace and quiet while preparing
his lectures for the fall term at
Beardsley College in Ohio, Look
ing for lodgings, he tries the
Hays house. Mrs. Hays. (Shelley
Winters), Lolita’s widowed moth
er, immediately pursues him,
making the old college try to
snow the Prof, into renting a
room. She has great cultural in
terests, she says, but her too
amorous pursuit convinces the
mild Humbert that she has other
interests as well, and he is prob
ably thinking of punching his
way out of Mrs. Hays’s clutches
when he spots Lolita, attired in
sunglasses and bikini. Then the
idea of hitting the hays takes on
a new aspect. Humbert goes from
mild to wild and stays on.

He drools as he watches Lolita
hula-hooping, holds her hand at
a drive-in movie, gapes at her at
a high school stomp. But Mrs.
Hays is too interested in nailing
Humbert to put up with her surly
sexpot of an infant child, and
sends her off to camp. So Hum
bert is left with the hungry wid
ow. Finally he marries her in or
der to be around when Lolita
comes home.

The marriage fails though
when the aging bride gets upset
with “Hum’’ and reads his secret
diary, in which he has written of
her as an “old cow” and of his
desire for Lolita. She gets hys
terical, climbs out a window, and
is run over by a car.
HUMBERT fetches Lolita out
of camp, lies that he is driving
her to the far-off hospital where
her mother is 111. They stop at a
motel. He tries to creep into bed
with her. No luck. So the next
morning she climbs in bed with
him. Ecstasy? Who cares? This
scene has the dramatic power and
significance of a mid-western
hog-sell.
Without a hint of the smallest
reaction to that long-sought rap
ture, Humbert drives away with
her to his job at Beardsley, where
he gets jealous of the lusty high
school boys, then turns in his
lectern to take off with her on a
grand motel-to-motel tour of the
U.S.A. The plot twists and turns
almost incoherently from this
point but the upshot is that para
dise—lust is lost and she runs off
to marry a greaseball she met at
a lunch counter.

These last scenes reflect the
film’s lack of continuity and back
ground. Unfamiliar intrigues and
affairs take over the plot. And
with the exception of Shelley
Winters who comes through
strong as the pathetic mother
even if the part is weak, the
characters seem to know in ad
vance what will happen and want
only to get it over with. James
Mason is an old pro but he is per
functory and witless as Humbert.
Sue Lyon is good as the sour and
sultry teen-ager—which is just
what she is—but one thing she
isn’t is a mature actress. Her at
tempts to convey sentiment are
not even good attempts. But
Peter Sellers who plays a handy
but fairly unimportant role, is
excellent: funny, witty, versatile.
He is the saving grace of the pic
ture and that is perhaps the rea
son why he is shot in the opening
scene.
