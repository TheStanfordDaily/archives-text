# Foreign Scholarship Program Began During Spring of 1948

### CHUCK GILLET 
In the spring primary of 1948
the Stanford student body ap
proved a plan to bring students
from the war-devastated areas of
Europe to Stanford. By a vote of
1,858 to 963 the student-adminis
tered ASSU Foreign Scholarship
Program was born. The purpose
of the program wds then, as now,
to promote the exchange of ideas
and students of all nations in or
der to secure mutual understand
ing.
The newly formed commission
immediately began its work by
selecting seven outstanding stu
dents from Europe.
The referendum in part reflect
ed student concern over the Com
munist coup d’etat in Czechoslo
vakia a few months before and
over the whole issue of World
War 11. The outcome was a posi
tive assertion of Stanford’s posi
tion in world affairs.
Since that time over 125 for
eign scholars have been brought
to Stanford through the Program.
In 1951 Asia (Japan) was first
represented, and in 1956 Africa
(Morocco). This year for (he first
time a scholar was selected from
Latin America (Brazil).
The scholars are selected by the
Foreign Scholarship Commission
on the basis of their leadership
in student affairs, their academic
record, and other criteria which
ensure their full participation in

campus life at Stanford. This
year seven finalists were selected
from approximately three hun
dred applications.
Financing of the Program is a
joint venture of the living groups,
the administration, the HR, Cap
and Gown, and the ASSU. As
such it is a reflection of the
broad and genuine support the
program has enjoyed since its
initiation.
In addition to working closely
with the scholars in a series of
seminars and trips, the Foreign
Scholarship Commission hopes to
accomplish live main objectives
this year:
• A better integration of Stan
ford’s foreign students into cam
pus life, with the cooperation of
the HR and I Club;
• The coordination and re-eval
uation of Stanford’s present affil
iation in Latin America;
• The evaluation of the past
record of the Scholarship Pro
gram, and a re-evaluation of pres
ent goals;
• The spread of the concept of
a student-administered foreign
scholarship program to other uni
versities:
• A greater continuity and sim
plicity in the administration of
the Program, thus freeing the
Commission for more creative
work.
