be at the college at 12:30 p.m.
Oct. 25.

He said in a telegram that he
would “be ready to debate Dr.
Schwarz ... if he is there, or
spend an hour 1 and a half expos
ing him if he is not there.”
But Schwarz, organizer of the
Christian Anti-Communism Cru

not accept Bridges’ dictatorial at
titude on the location and condi
tions of the debate. These should
be established by negotiations
and not by his unilateral decision.
I will not accept San Francisco
State as the location and demand
a neutral auditorium where the
citizens of San Francisco can at
tend.”
