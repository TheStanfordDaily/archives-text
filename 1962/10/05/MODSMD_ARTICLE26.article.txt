# Ace Southpaw Whitey Ford Halts Cinderella Giants

### ROGER MENDELSON 
Whltoy Ford, the New York
Yankees veteran lefthander, show
ed (he San Francisco Giants yes
terday why he is considered the
best World Series pitcher in the
majors. Ford maintained his en
viable 1.89 World Series earned
run average by surrendering only
two runs as the Yanks won the
Series opener, 6-2 at Candlestick
Park.
Ford was a bit shaky during the
second and third innings when the
Giants scored single runs for a
2- tie but he mixed curves,
sliders, and an occasional fastball
effectively through the middle
innings to preserve the tie.
THIRD BASEMAN C let us
Boyer put New York ahead 3-2
with a seventh inning home run,
and Ford pitched like a rejuven
ated man from then on. He con
centrated primarily on the fast
ball, which he had used frugally
since the first two innings, and
finished up the game easily, strik
ing out six while allowing ten hits.
He was at his best when he
struck out Chuck Hiller in the
sixth and Willie Mays in the
seventh. Behind three balls, no
strikes against Hiller, Ford came
back with five straight strikes,
two of which were fouled; the
whiff pitch, the third 3-2 delivery,
was a beautiful low, outside curve.
Against Mays, leading off the
seventh when San Francisco need
ed one run to tie, Ford went to
3- threw two strikes that were
fouled, and then completely fooled
Mays with a fast ball down the
middle.
MEANWHILE, Yankee power,
while not overly impressive (the
Giants’ wasn’t either) was ade
quate, especially when coupled
with two Giant defensive inade
quacies.
In the eighth the Yanks had
already scored one run on singles
by Roger Maris, Elston Howard,
and Dale Long to lead 4-2. With
Howard on third and one out,
Boyer hit a short fly to left. Over
zealously, shortstop Jose Pagan
decided to make the play himself,
caught the ball backing away
from the infield, and bumped into
the on-rushing leftfielder, thus de
laying his throw to the plate; even
so, the throw was still in time,
but catcher Ed Bailey dropped the
ball as Howard slid into him.

the on-rushing leftfielder, thus de
laying his throw to the plate; even
so, the throw was still in time,
but catcher Ed Bailey dropped the
ball as Howard slid into him.
Whltoy Ford, the New York
Yankees veteran lefthander, show
ed (he San Francisco Giants yes
terday why he is considered the
best World Series pitcher in the
majors. Ford maintained his en
viable 1.89 World Series earned
run average by surrendering only
two runs as the Yanks won the
Series opener, 6-2 at Candlestick
Park.
Ford was a bit shaky during the
second and third innings when the
Giants scored single runs for a
2- tie but he mixed curves,
sliders, and an occasional fastball
effectively through the middle
innings to preserve the tie.
THIRD BASEMAN C let us
Boyer put New York ahead 3-2
with a seventh inning home run,
and Ford pitched like a rejuven
ated man from then on. He con
centrated primarily on the fast
ball, which he had used frugally
since the first two innings, and
finished up the game easily, strik
ing out six while allowing ten hits.
He was at his best when he
struck out Chuck Hiller in the
sixth and Willie Mays in the
seventh. Behind three balls, no
strikes against Hiller, Ford came
back with five straight strikes,
two of which were fouled; the
whiff pitch, the third 3-2 delivery,
was a beautiful low, outside curve.
Against Mays, leading off the
seventh when San Francisco need
ed one run to tie, Ford went to
3- threw two strikes that were
fouled, and then completely fooled
Mays with a fast ball down the
middle.
MEANWHILE, Yankee power,
while not overly impressive (the
Giants’ wasn’t either) was ade
quate, especially when coupled
with two Giant defensive inade
quacies.
In the eighth the Yanks had
already scored one run on singles
by Roger Maris, Elston Howard,
and Dale Long to lead 4-2. With
Howard on third and one out,
Boyer hit a short fly to left. Over
zealously, shortstop Jose Pagan
decided to make the play himself,
caught the ball backing away
from the infield, and bumped into
the on-rushing leftfielder, thus de
laying his throw to the plate; even
so, the throw was still in time,
