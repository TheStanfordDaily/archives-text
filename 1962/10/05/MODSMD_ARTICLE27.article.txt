# BAKER'S PASSING VS. TRIBE BEEF
## Indians Host Terry Baker and Co. 
### BEN TIPTON 
j The Stanford Indians will host
j Or egon State’s Beavers tomorrow
in the thirty-second meeting be
| tween the two schools. Game time
|is 1:30 in Stanford Stadium.
1 The Cards have a long winning
j tradition against their northern!
j opponents. Since 1919. they have
1 lost only nine games to the Beav-
I ers, while tying two and winning
twenty. Last year the Big Red
j Machine rolled, 34-0 at Corvallis.
Wins over- OSU have been scarce
since the advent of coach Tommy
j Prothro, however. In their last
seven tries, the Indians have
mastered the Beavers otrly twice.

Prothro’s squads win against
j other teams, 100. He has the best
coaching record on the coast, 41
j wins, 26 losses, and two ties in
j seven seasons.
AGAINST STANFORD. Prothro
will field a light, fast team fea
turing the running and passing of
quarterback Terry Baker and the
pass catching ability of end Vern
Burke. The quick-striking OSU
offense has netted 467 yards
through the air and 189 on the
ground for a 656 yard two-game
| total. Four of the Beavers’ seven
touchdowns have been scored on
| pass plays.
! Stanford coach Jack Curtice is
understandably concerned about
the OSU offense. “This is the
best passing team we’ll come up
against,” he said yesterday.
“We’ve been spending a lot of
hours on pass defense. Quarter
hack is one spot where they’re not
i hurting.”
Also on Curtice’s mind is a rash 1
j of minor injuries and illnesses in ;
j the Indian camp. Sophomore half- i
! back J. D. Lodato will definitely
[ be out this week with a bruised
I rib suffered against Michigan
i State. Starting center C. B. Sim-J
ons has the flu, as does halfback 1
I Gary Craig. Both are doubtful j
j starters against the Beavers. “We j
won’t know until game time about |
I several of our boys,” said Curtice.
FOR THE FIRST time in many
years the Indians look like a'
threat on the ground. Oregon j
State’s tentative starting line aver- !
ages 194 pounds. Stanford’s line!
[ is somewhere in the stratosphere i
1 above 230. Included are massive I
j Chuck Buehler < 266 • and Frank'
Atkinson (245) at tackles, Frank
1 Dubofsky (225) and Marv Harris!
j (224) at guards, and Frank Pati
i Tucci (213) and Steve Pursell (212)
j at ends. The Stanford backfield
i will average just under 200
j pounds.
| The Beavers have scored more

than half of their points in the
fourth quarter. There were only
twelve seconds remaining when
Baker flipped the game winning
pass against lowa State. OSU has
also given up 63 points to oppos
ing teams in two games.

Stanford is currently out-gain
ing opponents, 488 yards to 456.
Oregon State, although gaining
656 yards, has allowed 802 yards
to their opponents. The Beavers
have lost three fumbles, the In
dians two.

ASIDE FROM Baker. Leroy|
Whittle is probably the best run- i
ner the Beavers have. As a sopho
more last year, the 6-1. 186 pound
speadster carried 364 yards at a
4.5 yard average and scored three
touchdowns. This year he has
carried only eight times, but has
racked up a total of 70 yards and
has yet to be thrown for a loss.
Allan Curr, Lodato, and Ken
Babajiart are in a three-way battle
for the Stanford rushing lead,
with 64, 63, and 61 yards gained
respectively. Curr and Babajian
will both see action tomorrow.

Neal Ormond and M ik e
>1 ait i s will broadcast the
game live tomorrow on KZSU
beginning at I part. Ormond
is a Vale graduate and has
worked for ABC radio.
K< Bs \\Rl| also carry the
game.


LEFT HALFBACK LEROY WHITTLE, Oregon State's leading rusher and
scorer last season, is expected to take some of the pressure off All-
America Terry Baker tomorrow.
