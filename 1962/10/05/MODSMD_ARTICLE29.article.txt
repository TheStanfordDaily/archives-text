# Tribe Faces Tough CCSF in Soccer
## 
### 
For the first time in several
years Stanford has a chance to
beat the powerful City College of
San Francisco on the soccer field.
The game will be played on the
San Francisco campus at 11 a.m.
tomorrow.
Stanford was very impressive
last weekend in trouncing San
Jose State, while the San Fran
ciscians were being shoved around
for a half by Menlo College 3-2.
However CCSF showed that it
isn’t dead by rebounding for an
8-3 victory.
The mediocre showing by CCSF
isn’t as encouraging to Stanford
as the fact that they lost 10 of
their 11 starters from last year’s
NCISC team. The lone returnee
is a dandy however. He is goalie
Gary Delong, who, if given any
help at all by the City College j
backfield, will give Stanford goal !
ies Kent Mueller and Tom Paul-1
son a lesson in how to tend the I
goal against attack.

ASIDE FROM the excellent De
long, CCSF is a complete mystery'.
None of their players from last
year return, even the reserves.
However, knowing Coach Roy
Diedrichson, City College can’t be
taken lightly.
Stanford soccer coach Fred
Priddle will probably use the
same starting lineup that faced
San Jose. Mueller will open in the
goal; Sandy Pofahl and Rich Lon
ergan are the fullbacks; Bill
Teusch, Jim Armstrong and either
Don Burr or George Schmoller
will be halfbacks; and the for
wards should be A1 Nnoli, Stu
Rawlings, Don Griffith, Ed Clark
and either Larry Chukwudebe or
Ken Stevens.
