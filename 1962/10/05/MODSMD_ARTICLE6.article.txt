# 'Last Lecture' Series Opened by Rhinelander
## 
### DICK WEISS 
Professor Philip H. Rhinelander
gave the first in a series of talks
hy eminent speakers on “My Last
Lecture’’ before a large audience
in the Tressider Lounge yester
day.
Each speaker in the series is
urged to speak on topics which
he feels will express the signifi
cant ideas he has developed dur
ing his career.
RHINELANDER’S “last" lec
ture combined humor and serious
ness to develop a pair of topics.
The anatomy of the footnote pro
vided a humorous prelude to a
serious discussion of basic humil
ity.
In an attempt to gain the proper
perspective, Rhinelander created
a fictional picture of Stanford in
1972. His conception of the prob
lems of 1972 were identical to our
present problems. He later aban
donned this approach in order to
achieve a fresh theme.
The first portion of the pro
gram was given over to a dis
cussion of the footnote, or “The
Third Invention.” He contended
that the footnote ranked high as
one of the most important inven
tions in the history of mankind.
In support of its importance,
Rhinelander asked, “Can you con
ceive a scholarly book today with
out footnotes?” He then proceed
ed to humorously analyze the
various forms of footnotes to the
delight of the audience.
HIS EXAMPLES of the wide
variety of footnotes were both
pertinent and amusing. No spec
tator could fail to recognize sev
eral of the varieties from his own

literary experience.
Following this humorous begin
ning, Rhinelander proceeded to a
discussion of humility and its re
lation to man’s conception of the
world. “Humility is an effort to
see things as they are, including
oneself,” he said.
The self-centered person often
loses sight of reality and thus can
mistakenly see himself as a tragic
figure, unnoticed by (lie world. In
most cases this tragic figure is a
figment of the imagination re
sulting from an extremely self
centered personality.
The tragic figure is contrasted
with the comic who realizes that
everything in the world is absurd
including himself. This realiza
tion can often be a deciding factor
in one’s view of the physical
world. The important thing is to
realize that, as Erich Fromm has
shown, “The search for objectivity
is true humility.”
The "My Last Lecture” series is
to become a regular feature of the
Thursday afternoon agenda. In
weeks to come students will hear
various Stanford professors speak
on a variety of topics. In every
case the lecture will serve as an
opportunity for the various speak
ers to develop themes they would
otherwise be unable to present.
