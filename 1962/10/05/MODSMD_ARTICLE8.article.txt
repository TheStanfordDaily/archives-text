# Assembly Censures French Government
## 
### 
PARIS, Friday (UPI) The
French National Assembly, defy
ing President Charles de Gaulle,
early today passed a stinging cen
sure motion against the gov
ernment which forces Premier
Georges Pompidou and his cabinet
to resign.
Although Pompidou was obliged
to resign. De Gaulle, who alone
has the right to name govern
ments, was expected to strike
back at the assembly. It was be
lieved possible in some quarters
that he might challenge the as
sembly and reappoint Pompidou.
It was also believed likely that
he would dissolve parliament and
call new elections, probably early
in November.
A total of 280 votes in the 480-
member assembly were cast for
the motion, according to an offi
cial announcement.
As is customary the votes
against the motion were not re
corded. Only those for it were
counted.
THE MOTION roundly criti
cizes De Gaulle for seeking a
change in the constitution that
would permit future French pres
idents to be elected by direct vote.
It said his action “violates the

constitution of which he is the
guardian” and declared De Gaulle
Is “opening a breach by which an
adventurer might pass some day
to overthrow the republic and sup
press its liberties,”
Voting by the 480-man assembly
began at 7:40 p.m. PDT. A mini
mum of 241 votes were required
to carry the motion.
THE VOTING went quickly and
the 241 st vote was cast at 8:13
a.m„ French time, by Maurice
Thorez, secretary general of the
Communist party.
By 8:20 a.m. 272 votes had been
recorded against the government.
The parliamentary revolt

against De Gaulle was carried put
despite a last minute speech by
Pompidou in which he accused
his opponents of trying to get rid
of De Gaulle now that the Alger
ian problem is solved.
“What else is the purpose of the
great offensive except to serve
notice to De Gaulle that his time
is up?” Pompidou asked.
TWO HOURS before the mara
thon debate opened Thursday aft
ernoon Do Gaulle, in a nationwide
broadcast, threatened to resign if
the country does not approve his
constitutional change plan in a
referendum set for Oct. 28. But
his broadcast had no impact on
the hostile assembly.
The Communists joined depu
ties ranging from the Socialists
to the extreme right wingers in
attacking De Gaulle for his plans
to change the 1958 constitution.
The only party to come to the
president’s defense was his own
Union for the New Republic. But
even their stand was not solid.
Two party members said they
were voting against the govern
ment.
UNDER THAT constitution,
which De Gaulle authored, the
presidents are elected by some
50,000 “grand electors” who are
mayors, deputies, senators and
other such officials.
