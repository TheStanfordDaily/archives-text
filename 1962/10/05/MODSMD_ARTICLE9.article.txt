# Geology Plans Honors Course
## 
### 
The Geology department has
this year begun a new honors
program for outsatnding under
graduates. Financed by the Na
tional Science Foundation, the
program will offer the opportuni
ty for independent study and re
search for a selected group of
students.

Five students this quarter are
attending a special seminar and
are working on an independent
research project in addition to
their regular geology courses.
The seminar enables them to read
advanced material not usually
covered in the curriculum and to
discuss this reading with mem
bers of the faculty. Each student
must also write a critical analysis
of a- geological problem of special
.personal interest. The research
project will be in connection with
the geological study of the San
Andreas Rift Zone in the Santa
Cruz Mountains near the campus.
Students may also participate in
existing faculty and graduate re
search projects.
The five students now involved
in the program are Odette Bric
mont, Gary Lofgren, Allen Park,
Jeff Johnson, and Tom Smith.
Since they are attending the sem
inar, they will waive some of the
courses usually required of Ge
ology majors. On successful com
pletion of the program, they will
graduate with honors in Geology.
