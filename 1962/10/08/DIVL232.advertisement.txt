HAPPINESS CAN’T BUY MONEY
Can education bring happiness?
I his is a question that in recent years has caused much
li\ely debate and several hundred stabbings among American
college professors. Some contend that if a student’s intellect
is sufficiently aroused, happiness will automatically follow.
Others say that to concentrate on the intellect anil ignore the
rest ol the personality can only lead to misery.
1 myself favor the second view, and 1 offer in evidence the
well-known case of A gat he Fusco.
Agathe, a forestry major, never got anything less than a
straight “A , was awarded her B.T. (Bachelor of d rees) in
only two years, her M.S.B. (Master of Sap and Bark) in only
three, and her D.B.C, (Doctor of Blight and Cutworms) in
only four.
Academic glory was hers. Her intellect was the envy of
every intellect fan on campus. But was she happy? The
answer, alas, was no. Agathe—she knew not why—was miser
able, so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking across
campus, she was suddenly so overcome with melancholy that
she Hang herself, weeping, upon the statue of the Founder.
By and by a liberal arts major named R. Twinkle Plenty came
by with his yoyo. He noted Agathe's condition. ‘'How come
you’re so unhappy, hey?” said R. Twinkle.
“Suppose you tell me, you dumb old liberal arts major,”
replied Agathe peevishly.

“AH right, I will,” said R. Twinkle. “You are unhappy for
two reasons. First, because you have been so busy stuffing
your intellect that you have gone and starved your psyche. I’ve
got nothing against learning, mind you, but a person oughtn’t
to neglect the pleasant, gentle amenities of life—the fun
things. Have you, for instance, ever been to a dance?”
Agathe shook her head.
“Have you ever watched a sunset? Written a poem? Smoked
a Marlboro Cigarette?”
Agathe shook her head,
“Well, we’ll fix that right now!”said R.Twinkle and gave her
a Marlboro and struck a match.
She puffed, and then for the first time in twelve or fifteen
years, she smiled. “Wow!” she cried. “Marlboros arc a fun thing!
What flavor! What filter! What pack or box! What a lot to
like! From now on I will smoke Marlboros, and never have
another unhappy day!”
“Hold!” said R. Twinkle. “Marlboros alone will not solve
your problem—only half of it. Remember I said there were
two things making you unhappy?”
“Oh, yeah,” said Agathe. “What’s the other one?”
“How long have you had that bear trap on your foot?*!
said R. Twinkle.
“I stepped on it during a field trip in my freshman year,”
said Agathe. “I keep meaning to have it taken off,”
“.Allow me,” said R. Twinkle and removed it.
“I .and sakes, what a relief!” said Agathe, now totally happy,
and took It. Twinkle’s hand and led him to a Marlboro vendor's
and then to a justice of the peace.
Today Agathe is a perfectly fulfilled woman, both intellect
wise and personalitywise. She lives in a darling split-level
house with It. Twinkle and their 17 children, and she still keeps
busy in the forestry game. Only last month, in fact, she became
Consultant on Sawdust to the American Butchers Cuiki, die
was named an Honorary Sequoia by the park commissioner of
I-as Vegas, and she published a best-selling book called I was
a Slippery Elm for the EH], « >«•** m»»

The makers of Marlboro are pleased that Agathe is finally
out of the woods—and so will you be if your goal is smoking
pleasure. Just try a Marlboro.
