United Press International
HOUSTON—-Astronaut Walter M. Schirra Jr, said yesterda • he
“could have gone for 18 orbits” on his six-orbit space voyage that
was such a perfect “textbook flight” he was sorry to see it end. The
only thing that "surprised” him, he told a news conference, was a
strange view of the stars beneath a brilliant “brownish-gray” haze
that hung over earth. “This may be something new, I don’t know
yet,” ho said.
Schirra said he hoped to make another space flight under the
Mercury program. Dr. Robert Gilruth, director of the Manned Space
craft Center in Houston, said “There has been no selection” made
yet for the one-day flight expected by next February. Informed
sources said Alan Shepard might gvt the job, making him the first
man to go into space twice.
KHRUSHCHEV THREATENS TREATY MOSCOW- Premier Ni
kita S. Khrushchev threatened anew Sunday to sign a separate peace
treaty with East Germany but he mentioned no deadline for such a
pact. At the same time, the Communist party newspaper Pravda led
the Soviet press in an attack on iSie Western position over West
Berlin and Germany. Western observers in Moscow said Khrush
chev’s statement of Russian intentions appeared to be at least partly
aimed at trying to placate impatient East German Communist
loaders. The absence of a deadline threat in Khrushchev’s message
and in the Russian press indicated the Soviets were still holding
off until after the U.S. congressional elections next month, Western
observers said.
