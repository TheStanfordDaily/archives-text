## Kennedy and Cook 'Shine' on Opening Night 
### RICHARD INWOOD 
Two days before the opening performance Di
rector Kerans could not quite conceal his appre
hension, and the actors were admittedly afraid
that the play wasn’t knitting: but when Henry
Becque’s “La Parlsienne” opened Friday night at
the Outer Circle (adjacent to the east wall of
Memorial Auditorium) to an ideally small and
receptive audience, the four main characters for
the first time began to feel each others’ rhythms,
and shaping their renditions about Kerans’ pow
erful, opinionated conception of the play, pushed
on confidently through, delighting as much as the
audience in the thrill of creation and the intimacy
of the new theater.
BECQUE’S PLAY, a hit when it was first pro
duced in 1885, must be admired by anyone with
sympathy for the drawing-room comedy—a taste
that has to be acquired. An “actor’s play,” allow
ing its characters to do not just one thing, but
many, it is an excellent vehicle for the very dif
ferent talents of Herbert Kennedy and June Cook,
who shine in the leading roles.
Kennedy, by far the best of the troupe, has
remarkable versatility and sophistication. His fa
cility and sense of humor, which do not spate
even his own performance, make him the only one
who can, with all confidence, hold the stage alone.
He is at his best wTien he is soliloquizing or shar
ing the stage with Miss Cook, but his performance
suffers when he must compete for the stage with
another male or when a momentary lapse in au
dience response makes him rush his lines or ne
glect his phrasing—which is otherwise very im
pressive, indeed.
MISS COOK exploits her loveliness and her
Gallic looks, and has a very good time in the part.
Unfortunately, she is far more insensitive to the
variations among her lovers than the role de
mands, or even implies, and she too seldom will
I sacrifice a line to bring out another.
Yet her very rigidity, not at all oppressive,
serves as a focus for the entire play since she is
' on the stage longer than anyone else. Through the

fallacy of imitative form, she succeeds in creating
the right impression—of a female who does what
females are supposed to—which is, after all, to
get thi’ough life, ingeniously if possible.
STANLEY WEESE as Dumesnil, Clotilde’s hus
band and worldly-witless academician, is an intel
ligent voice of tradition and very valuable to the
classical personality of the play since he alone ac
cepts the rules and limitations of the drawing
room manner. His face is startlingly plastic; and
his performance too, under Kerans, shows much
greater range of expression than last year’s fi
asco, “Six Characters,” would have suggested.
Suzanne Payne seems unaware of what the play
is all about and attempts to make a leading role
of her walk-on. She can do better if she tries.
A strong performance is always to be expected
of Victor Emeljanow, and his acting has matured
over the summer. Kerans succeeds in toning him
down so that his personality and presence do not
obtrude at the expense of the play. Costumes by
Marie Chesley, set by Gone Chesley, and lighting
by Cary Clasz are all good, and Kerans’ staging
for the difficult four-faced platform, governed by
the choreographer's principle of economic sug
gestion of a pattern, shows no sign of awkward
ness.
Dr. Kerans is a talented man, and Becque’s
play is in general well-handled, but by the third act
the players have acted well enough to let them
draw from their reputations. They, especially
Miss Cook, ride the back of their words, with ne
glect to their craft. Nevertheless, Kerans has got
ten optimal performances out of Weese and
Emeljanow.
GRANTING THAT the vibrance of the play
Friday night was a function of its being caught
at the moment of coalescence, they should be able
to draw from their seminal performance enough
confidence to withdraw their personalities and
give the play the bit of subtlety it can stand, so
that we may expect fine performance Friday and
Saturday, the last chance Stanford people will
have this year to see a production in the Outer
Circle.

the choreographer's principle of economic sug

Dr. Kerans is a talented man, and Becque’s
play is in general well-handled, but by the third act
the players have acted well enough to let them
draw from their reputations. They, especially
Miss Cook, ride the back of their words, with ne
glect to their craft. Nevertheless, Kerans has got
ten optimal performances out of Weese and
Emeljanow.
GRANTING THAT the vibrance of the play
Friday night was a function of its being caught
at the moment of coalescence, they should be able
to draw from their seminal performance enough
confidence to withdraw their personalities and
give the play the bit of subtlety it can stand, so
that we may expect fine performance Friday and
Saturday, the last chance Stanford people will
have this year to see a production in the Outer
Circle.
Two days before the opening performance Di
rector Kerans could not quite conceal his appre
hension, and the actors were admittedly afraid
that the play wasn’t knitting: but when Henry
Becque’s “La Parlsienne” opened Friday night at
the Outer Circle (adjacent to the east wall of
Memorial Auditorium) to an ideally small and
receptive audience, the four main characters for
the first time began to feel each others’ rhythms,
and shaping their renditions about Kerans’ pow
erful, opinionated conception of the play, pushed
on confidently through, delighting as much as the
audience in the thrill of creation and the intimacy
of the new theater.
BECQUE’S PLAY, a hit when it was first pro
duced in 1885, must be admired by anyone with
sympathy for the drawing-room comedy—a taste
that has to be acquired. An “actor’s play,” allow
ing its characters to do not just one thing, but
many, it is an excellent vehicle for the very dif
ferent talents of Herbert Kennedy and June Cook,
who shine in the leading roles.
Kennedy, by far the best of the troupe, has
remarkable versatility and sophistication. His fa
cility and sense of humor, which do not spate
even his own performance, make him the only one
who can, with all confidence, hold the stage alone.
He is at his best wTien he is soliloquizing or shar
ing the stage with Miss Cook, but his performance
suffers when he must compete for the stage with
another male or when a momentary lapse in au
dience response makes him rush his lines or ne
glect his phrasing—which is otherwise very im
pressive, indeed.
MISS COOK exploits her loveliness and her
Gallic looks, and has a very good time in the part.
Unfortunately, she is far more insensitive to the
variations among her lovers than the role de
mands, or even implies, and she too seldom will
I sacrifice a line to bring out another.
Yet her very rigidity, not at all oppressive,
serves as a focus for the entire play since she is
' on the stage longer than anyone else. Through the

fallacy of imitative form, she succeeds in creating
the right impression—of a female who does what
females are supposed to—which is, after all, to
get thi’ough life, ingeniously if possible.
STANLEY WEESE as Dumesnil, Clotilde’s hus
band and worldly-witless academician, is an intel
ligent voice of tradition and very valuable to the
classical personality of the play since he alone ac
cepts the rules and limitations of the drawing
room manner. His face is startlingly plastic; and
his performance too, under Kerans, shows much
greater range of expression than last year’s fi
asco, “Six Characters,” would have suggested.
Suzanne Payne seems unaware of what the play
is all about and attempts to make a leading role
of her walk-on. She can do better if she tries.
A strong performance is always to be expected
of Victor Emeljanow, and his acting has matured
over the summer. Kerans succeeds in toning him
down so that his personality and presence do not
obtrude at the expense of the play. Costumes by
Marie Chesley, set by Gone Chesley, and lighting
by Cary Clasz are all good, and Kerans’ staging

ligent voice of tradition and very valuable to the
classical personality of the play since he alone ac
cepts the rules and limitations of the drawing
room manner. His face is startlingly plastic; and
his performance too, under Kerans, shows much
greater range of expression than last year’s fi
asco, “Six Characters,” would have suggested.
Suzanne Payne seems unaware of what the play
is all about and attempts to make a leading role
of her walk-on. She can do better if she tries.
A strong performance is always to be expected
of Victor Emeljanow, and his acting has matured
over the summer. Kerans succeeds in toning him
down so that his personality and presence do not
obtrude at the expense of the play. Costumes by
Marie Chesley, set by Gone Chesley, and lighting
by Cary Clasz are all good, and Kerans’ staging
for the difficult four-faced platform, governed by
the choreographer's principle of economic sug
gestion of a pattern, shows no sign of awkward
ness.
Dr. Kerans is a talented man, and Becque’s
play is in general well-handled, but by the third act
the players have acted well enough to let them
draw from their reputations. They, especially
Miss Cook, ride the back of their words, with ne
glect to their craft. Nevertheless, Kerans has got
ten optimal performances out of Weese and
Emeljanow.
GRANTING THAT the vibrance of the play
Friday night was a function of its being caught
at the moment of coalescence, they should be able
to draw from their seminal performance enough
confidence to withdraw their personalities and
give the play the bit of subtlety it can stand, so
that we may expect fine performance Friday and
Saturday, the last chance Stanford people will
have this year to see a production in the Outer
Circle.
Two days before the opening performance Di
rector Kerans could not quite conceal his appre
hension, and the actors were admittedly afraid
that the play wasn’t knitting: but when Henry
Becque’s “La Parlsienne” opened Friday night at
the Outer Circle (adjacent to the east wall of
Memorial Auditorium) to an ideally small and
receptive audience, the four main characters for
the first time began to feel each others’ rhythms,
and shaping their renditions about Kerans’ pow
erful, opinionated conception of the play, pushed
on confidently through, delighting as much as the
audience in the thrill of creation and the intimacy
of the new theater.
BECQUE’S PLAY, a hit when it was first pro
duced in 1885, must be admired by anyone with
sympathy for the drawing-room comedy—a taste
that has to be acquired. An “actor’s play,” allow
ing its characters to do not just one thing, but
many, it is an excellent vehicle for the very dif
ferent talents of Herbert Kennedy and June Cook,
who shine in the leading roles.
Kennedy, by far the best of the troupe, has
remarkable versatility and sophistication. His fa
cility and sense of humor, which do not spate
even his own performance, make him the only one
who can, with all confidence, hold the stage alone.
He is at his best wTien he is soliloquizing or shar
ing the stage with Miss Cook, but his performance
suffers when he must compete for the stage with
another male or when a momentary lapse in au
dience response makes him rush his lines or ne
glect his phrasing—which is otherwise very im
pressive, indeed.
MISS COOK exploits her loveliness and her
Gallic looks, and has a very good time in the part.
Unfortunately, she is far more insensitive to the
variations among her lovers than the role de
mands, or even implies, and she too seldom will
I sacrifice a line to bring out another.
Yet her very rigidity, not at all oppressive,
serves as a focus for the entire play since she is
' on the stage longer than anyone else. Through the

fallacy of imitative form, she succeeds in creating
the right impression—of a female who does what
females are supposed to—which is, after all, to
get thi’ough life, ingeniously if possible.
