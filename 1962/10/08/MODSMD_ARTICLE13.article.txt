Saturday afternoon was a return to normalcy as the football
team lost rather decisively to an evidently inspired Oregon State
squad. Whatever the outcome of the game, the afternoon could not
have been an unqualified success, not with Rally Commission and
the head cheerleader performing. In front of an audience of 30,000
the cheerleader led a yell which probably amused a few, dis
gusted a few, and disgruntled the majority of adults present. There
is nothing more amusing to many yell leaders than a little overt or
implied obscenity, especially if there is a receptive audience.
Mr. Salquist may or may not have that audience captivated in
front of him every Saturday afternoon. It is extraordinarily un
likely that the other 25,000 spectators are amused or even tolerant
of his antics. If he cannot he more subtle in front of a captive
audience, he could be more broadly appealing in his performance
by taking into account the tastes of the majority of people having
to listen to him.
As for Rally Commission, they handled the card stunts with
notable inexpertise. Aside from the fact that the stunts were too
intricate for a card section to handle with clarity, the Rally Com
mission member leading tin* section was completely unable to
handle any kind of a crowd, rooting section, or card section. The
avalanche of cards thrown before the stunts were completed was
an indication how students felt about the whole matter.
