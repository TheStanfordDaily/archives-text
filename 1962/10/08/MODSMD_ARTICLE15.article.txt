Editor, The Dully:
Qualifying as “asinine” and
“imbecilic” the attitude taken by
the majority of the House of Rep
resentatives concerning the U.S.
policy toward Tito, Walter Lipp
mann states in his column (“Stan
ford Daily,” October 3, 1962) that
“We have in fact achieved the
same kind of penetration of the
Communist world [in Yugoslavia!
as Moscow has done in our world
in Cuba.” The logic of this natur
ally non-asinine and non-imbecilic
assertion assumes that thousands
of American “experts” are pres
ent in Yugoslavia, helping fever
ishly to build her military instal
lations for some potential anti-
Soviet offensive, and training a
large number of agitators and
would-be guerrilla fighters for ac
tion in the satellite realm.
If the policy of the U.S. has
really achieved this, then Mr.
Lippmann’s statement is fully
vindicated. Moreover, the paral
lelism in the Yugoslav and Cuban
situations would also suggest that
President Kennedy would be as
equally welcome a guest of Fidel
Castro as Leonid Brezhnev to
day is of Tito. In the absence of
proof on these points, Mr. Lipp
mann may be well advised to
withhold his epithets.

Editor, The Daily:
A good deal of foolishness has
been written about Cuba in re
cent weeks but few treatises upon
the subject have been so malici
ous in tone or devoid of fact as
the Eisenberg-Landau article pub
lished in Friday’s Daily.
I would bring two prominent
factual errors contained therein
to the attention of the student
body.
First, Messrs. Landau and Ei
senberg contended that “official
ly, the U.S. government has an
nounced the existence of some
ground to air missiles with a
range of 25 miles; certain tanks
and heavy artillery; and some
MIG jets (but not 257)”. So it did
—one month ago.
They continued; “Not one em
bassy in Havana nor one respon
sible foreign reporter has men
tioned the presence of any non-
Cuban troops; no Russian sol
diers, nor Chinese, nor East Eu
ropeans, no Ghanaians, nor Mar
tians.”
But if this were presently true,
why did President Kennedy dis
close far different information to
Congressional leaders of both
parties less than two weeks ago?
(Reported on September 25 by
widely respected Washington col
umnist, Ralph De Toledono).
Mr. Weinig described the Pres
ident’s statements accurately

when he wrote that Castro un
doubtedly possesses “Soviet-made
missiles with ranges of up to 1700
miles, which may be fired from
nine existing missile bases and
soon from 15 additional bases
which are now under construc
tion. His air force is equipped
with at least 57 MIG jet fighters,
which may be armed with tactical
nuclear weapons; and with as
many as 200 MIG-200 jet fighters,
which are capable of carrying nu
clear warheads to any city on the
Atlantic seaboard.”
In addition, the President dis
closed that Castro’s forces are, in
all probability, reenforced by 250
Soviet tanks, “8,000 Red Army
troops, 6,000 Red Chinese soldiers,
and 1,000 to 2,000 Ghanlan
troops.” No mention of Martians
was made.
A second, even more question
able, bit of reporting was offered
by Mr. Landau and Mr. Eisen
berg. They rejected Richard Wei
nig’s contention that, at present,
less than 20 per cent of the Cu
ban people support Castro, an ob
servation made on September 19
by William L. Ryan, the veteran
Associated Press correspondent in
Havana.
Instead, they chose to rely up
on "actual eyewitness reports ap
pearing in “The Nation” to-prove
that “Fidel is popular” and that
he is supported by at least 75
per cent of the Cuban people.
Very well. Presumably, Mr.
Eisenberg and Mr. Landau refer
to the Samuel Shapiro article in
the September 22 issue of “The
Nation.” In which case, our self
appointed Cuban experts seem to
ignore Mr. Shapiro’s own words:
“Since I spent only two weeks in
Cuba, I could not accurately esti
mate the regime’s total military
strength or the percentage of
popular support which it enjoys.”
But then, one shouldn’t ques
tion such sources. One might be
described as “neurotic,” or suf
fering from an acute case of
"paranoid ethnocentrism,” or a
member of the groups fondly
known by Messrs. Eisenberg and
Laudau as “election-minded con
gressmen” or “sensation-seeking
editors.”
Mr. Weinig, in all probability,
has no “secret pipeline to the CIA
which reports first to him before
advising the President.” But he
has at least bothered to inform
himself of current events before
presuming to write. If Mr. Eisen
berg and Mr. Laudau were to
spend more time doing likewise
and less time thumbing through
dictionaries and psychological
journals in search of rhetorical
epithets, they might find that the
“heroic Cuban martyr” is some
what less heroic than they pres
ently think.

Mr. Weinig, in all probability,
has no “secret pipeline to the CIA

has at least bothered to inform
himself of current events before

Qualifying as “asinine” and
“imbecilic” the attitude taken by
the majority of the House of Rep
resentatives concerning the U.S.
policy toward Tito, Walter Lipp
mann states in his column (“Stan
ford Daily,” October 3, 1962) that
“We have in fact achieved the
same kind of penetration of the
Communist world [in Yugoslavia!
as Moscow has done in our world
in Cuba.” The logic of this natur
ally non-asinine and non-imbecilic
assertion assumes that thousands
of American “experts” are pres
ent in Yugoslavia, helping fever
ishly to build her military instal
lations for some potential anti-
Soviet offensive, and training a
large number of agitators and
would-be guerrilla fighters for ac
tion in the satellite realm.
If the policy of the U.S. has
really achieved this, then Mr.
Lippmann’s statement is fully
vindicated. Moreover, the paral
lelism in the Yugoslav and Cuban
situations would also suggest that
President Kennedy would be as
equally welcome a guest of Fidel
Castro as Leonid Brezhnev to
day is of Tito. In the absence of
proof on these points, Mr. Lipp
mann may be well advised to
withhold his epithets.

A good deal of foolishness has
been written about Cuba in re
cent weeks but few treatises upon
the subject have been so malici
ous in tone or devoid of fact as
the Eisenberg-Landau article pub
lished in Friday’s Daily.
I would bring two prominent
factual errors contained therein
to the attention of the student
body.
First, Messrs. Landau and Ei
senberg contended that “official
ly, the U.S. government has an
nounced the existence of some
ground to air missiles with a
range of 25 miles; certain tanks
and heavy artillery; and some
MIG jets (but not 257)”. So it did
—one month ago.
They continued; “Not one em
bassy in Havana nor one respon
sible foreign reporter has men
tioned the presence of any non-
Cuban troops; no Russian sol
diers, nor Chinese, nor East Eu
ropeans, no Ghanaians, nor Mar
tians.”
But if this were presently true,
why did President Kennedy dis
close far different information to
Congressional leaders of both
parties less than two weeks ago?
(Reported on September 25 by
widely respected Washington col
umnist, Ralph De Toledono).
Mr. Weinig described the Pres
ident’s statements accurately

when he wrote that Castro un
doubtedly possesses “Soviet-made
missiles with ranges of up to 1700
miles, which may be fired from
nine existing missile bases and
soon from 15 additional bases
which are now under construc
tion. His air force is equipped
with at least 57 MIG jet fighters,
which may be armed with tactical
nuclear weapons; and with as
many as 200 MIG-200 jet fighters,
which are capable of carrying nu
clear warheads to any city on the
Atlantic seaboard.”
In addition, the President dis
closed that Castro’s forces are, in
all probability, reenforced by 250
Soviet tanks, “8,000 Red Army
troops, 6,000 Red Chinese soldiers,
and 1,000 to 2,000 Ghanlan
troops.” No mention of Martians
was made.
A second, even more question
able, bit of reporting was offered
by Mr. Landau and Mr. Eisen
berg. They rejected Richard Wei
nig’s contention that, at present,
less than 20 per cent of the Cu
ban people support Castro, an ob
servation made on September 19
by William L. Ryan, the veteran
Associated Press correspondent in
Havana.
Instead, they chose to rely up
on "actual eyewitness reports ap
pearing in “The Nation” to-prove
that “Fidel is popular” and that
he is supported by at least 75
per cent of the Cuban people.
Very well. Presumably, Mr.
Eisenberg and Mr. Landau refer
to the Samuel Shapiro article in
the September 22 issue of “The
Nation.” In which case, our self
appointed Cuban experts seem to
ignore Mr. Shapiro’s own words:
“Since I spent only two weeks in
Cuba, I could not accurately esti
mate the regime’s total military
strength or the percentage of
popular support which it enjoys.”
But then, one shouldn’t ques
tion such sources. One might be

nig’s contention that, at present,
less than 20 per cent of the Cu
ban people support Castro, an ob
servation made on September 19
by William L. Ryan, the veteran
Associated Press correspondent in
Havana.
Instead, they chose to rely up
on "actual eyewitness reports ap
pearing in “The Nation” to-prove
that “Fidel is popular” and that
he is supported by at least 75
per cent of the Cuban people.
Very well. Presumably, Mr.
Eisenberg and Mr. Landau refer
to the Samuel Shapiro article in
the September 22 issue of “The
Nation.” In which case, our self
appointed Cuban experts seem to
ignore Mr. Shapiro’s own words:
“Since I spent only two weeks in
Cuba, I could not accurately esti
mate the regime’s total military
strength or the percentage of
popular support which it enjoys.”
But then, one shouldn’t ques
tion such sources. One might be
described as “neurotic,” or suf
fering from an acute case of
"paranoid ethnocentrism,” or a
member of the groups fondly
known by Messrs. Eisenberg and
Laudau as “election-minded con
gressmen” or “sensation-seeking
editors.”
Mr. Weinig, in all probability,
has no “secret pipeline to the CIA
which reports first to him before
advising the President.” But he
has at least bothered to inform
himself of current events before
presuming to write. If Mr. Eisen
berg and Mr. Laudau were to
spend more time doing likewise
and less time thumbing through
dictionaries and psychological
journals in search of rhetorical
epithets, they might find that the
“heroic Cuban martyr” is some
what less heroic than they pres
ently think.

Qualifying as “asinine” and
“imbecilic” the attitude taken by
the majority of the House of Rep
resentatives concerning the U.S.
policy toward Tito, Walter Lipp
mann states in his column (“Stan
ford Daily,” October 3, 1962) that
“We have in fact achieved the
same kind of penetration of the
Communist world [in Yugoslavia!
as Moscow has done in our world
in Cuba.” The logic of this natur
ally non-asinine and non-imbecilic
assertion assumes that thousands
of American “experts” are pres
ent in Yugoslavia, helping fever
ishly to build her military instal
lations for some potential anti-
Soviet offensive, and training a
large number of agitators and
would-be guerrilla fighters for ac
tion in the satellite realm.
If the policy of the U.S. has
really achieved this, then Mr.
Lippmann’s statement is fully
vindicated. Moreover, the paral
lelism in the Yugoslav and Cuban
situations would also suggest that
President Kennedy would be as
equally welcome a guest of Fidel
Castro as Leonid Brezhnev to
day is of Tito. In the absence of
proof on these points, Mr. Lipp
mann may be well advised to
withhold his epithets.

A good deal of foolishness has
been written about Cuba in re
cent weeks but few treatises upon
the subject have been so malici
ous in tone or devoid of fact as
the Eisenberg-Landau article pub
lished in Friday’s Daily.
I would bring two prominent
factual errors contained therein
to the attention of the student
body.
First, Messrs. Landau and Ei
senberg contended that “official
ly, the U.S. government has an
nounced the existence of some
ground to air missiles with a
range of 25 miles; certain tanks
and heavy artillery; and some
MIG jets (but not 257)”. So it did
—one month ago.
They continued; “Not one em
bassy in Havana nor one respon
sible foreign reporter has men
tioned the presence of any non-
Cuban troops; no Russian sol
diers, nor Chinese, nor East Eu
ropeans, no Ghanaians, nor Mar
tians.”
But if this were presently true,
why did President Kennedy dis
close far different information to
Congressional leaders of both
parties less than two weeks ago?
(Reported on September 25 by
widely respected Washington col
umnist, Ralph De Toledono).
Mr. Weinig described the Pres
ident’s statements accurately

when he wrote that Castro un
doubtedly possesses “Soviet-made
missiles with ranges of up to 1700
miles, which may be fired from
nine existing missile bases and
soon from 15 additional bases
which are now under construc
tion. His air force is equipped
with at least 57 MIG jet fighters,
which may be armed with tactical
nuclear weapons; and with as
many as 200 MIG-200 jet fighters,
which are capable of carrying nu
clear warheads to any city on the
Atlantic seaboard.”
In addition, the President dis
closed that Castro’s forces are, in
all probability, reenforced by 250
Soviet tanks, “8,000 Red Army
troops, 6,000 Red Chinese soldiers,
and 1,000 to 2,000 Ghanlan
troops.” No mention of Martians
was made.
A second, even more question
able, bit of reporting was offered
by Mr. Landau and Mr. Eisen
berg. They rejected Richard Wei
nig’s contention that, at present,
less than 20 per cent of the Cu
ban people support Castro, an ob
