## Clancey Brothers Belong To Pub-Singer Tradition 
### 
By TIMOTHY PAVLIS
One of the most interesting
folk-singing groups to attain re
cent popularity is The Clancey
Bothers with Tommy Makem,
whose latest release, “Hearty and
Hellish!”, bears the Capitol im
print (CS 8571; Monaural, CL
-1771). Recorded in the intimate,
plush atmosphere of Chicago’s
gate of Horn, before an audience
composed almost entirely of other
Irishmen, the Clanceys emanate a
strong personal appeal.
The Clancey group has adopt
ed many of the scrubbed and
studied habits of the Kingston
trio; but it shows signs of endur
ing longer than its Stanford-bred
predecessors. The Clanceys and
Makem have not yet been tempt
ed to try the vocal pyrotechnics
for which the Kingston group is
famous. They make some attempt
to maintain contact with the
growing crowd of serious folk
music students in their audience.
(Tommy Makem offhandedly re
fers to “Johnny Me Eldoo” as “a
sort of Irish talkin-blues”). And
their present mode of night-club
performance is quite close to the
Irish pub-singing tradition from
which their songs have grown.
THEY HAVE followed the
somewhat dangerous precedent
of Harry Belafonte in detaching
themselves from their instru
ments. (On the present album
they are accompanied by Bruce
Langhorne on guitar, Herb
Brown on bass, and the Weaver’s
Frank Hamilton on banjo.) It re
mains to be seen whether this
accompanied singing will result
in a loss of wholeness or immedi
acy. They have, however, retained
Tommy Makem’s tin whistle,
which is used effectively through
out the album.
Until recently, songs like
“Johnny, 1 Hardly Knew Ye,”
“The Rising of the Moon,” and
"The Irish Rover” have been
rendered by such singers as the
Israeli Martha Schlamme, the
roving Hollywood gypsy Theo
Bikel, and the thoroughly Ameri
canized Burl Ives. It is therefore
a real pleasure to hear Irish
songs being sung by real Irish
men.
Tommy Makem was born in

Ireland, although most of his life
has been spent in the United
Stales, building a repertoire of
Irish songs. The three Clancey
Brothers—Liam, Tom, and Pat
rick—have deep roots in Ireland,
and in the Irish theater. In this
country the three have starred
in a stage adaptation of Frank
O’Connor's "Guests of the Na
tion.” as well as in various experi
mental groups such as the Poet’s
Theater in Cambridge, Mass.
THE GROUP served its folk
singing apprenticeship in small
recording companies such as
Greenwich Village’s Tradition
Records. These early records con
tain many excellent Gaelic songs,
of which the later albums have
none; and some of the early in
strumental arrangements put the
later recordings to shame. It is to
be hoped that, like Pete Seeger
with Folkway Records, the Clan
cey group will continue to do
their best work for a company
that lets them record whatever
they please.
Most of the present album is
made up of drinking and nation
alist songs. Probably the best
drinking song is "Whiskey,
You’re a Devil." It is followed by
an interesting little-known ver
sion of “Mountain Dew.”
The nationalist series is well
put-together, interspersed with
many in-group Irish jokes. It
ends with “Mr. Moses Ri-Tooral-
I-Ray,” a pre-Independence song
about a British policeman in Dub
lin who, mistaking the Hebrew
lettering of a Jewish merchant’s
signboard for the outlawed Gael
ic, arrests the Jew for subversive
activity.
THE CLANCEVS break up the
drinking and nationalist blocs
with spirited versions of “The
Barnyards of Delgaty” and
"When I Was Single.” By con
trast, the quiet “October Winds”
carries the spirit of the “Celtic
Twilight,” of Autumn-castles and
their treasure stores.
The Clanceys have a potential
ity for both continued popular ap
peal and authenticity. If they are
doing nothing else, they are help
ing to erase the “stage Irish
man” stereotype that persists
from the days of vaudevilel.
