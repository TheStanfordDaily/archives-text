Editor, The Daily:
Friday evening I was extremely
privileged to attend a concert by
a master of the harpsichord, Pro
fessor Putnam Aldrich, An over
flow crowd demonstrated its en
thusiasm and appreciation of
Professor Aldrich’s thrilling per
formance of Baroque and Renais
sance music. Indeed, it was a very
dignified, moving concert, hut
every fiber of dignity was de
stroyed by the exceedingly
gauche behavior of the audience
during intermission. Scarcely had
the master’s white tie and tails
disappeared behind the curtain
when three unkempt high school
boys sauntered out onto the cen
ter of the stage and critically ap
praised the ancient harpsichord
upon which Professor Putnam
had wrought his very compelling
strains.
As if this activity were not
abuse enough of the very rever
ence due the performer and his
instrument, several other would
be music connoisseurs strode up
to the instrument with an if-they
can-do-it-so-can-I air and throng
ed under the spotlights to gape in
awe at the wonderful machine,
besmudge it with fingerprints,
and pull at its strings. A wave of
mob emotion seemed to sweep
through DinkeLspiel Auditorium
as over half the remaining audi
ence surged forward, some even
climbing over the stage wall in
an effort to view the instrument
in a rare display of gross ill

taste. What was particularly
heart-sickening was the fact that
the crowd on stage included many
adults and “mature” Stanford
students. Insult was heaped on
insult when, finally, several self
styled harpsichordists elbowed
their way through the gaping
throng and proceeded to play the
master’s machine with assumed
authority. The very determined
observers insisted on trying their
skill even as the lights were dim
med and the microphone was
lowered. Only when the master
appeared in the wings did they
finally relinquish their enter
tainment and scurry to their
seats.
I trust this display is not in
dicative of the high degre of cul
ture and appreciation of aestheti
cal values to be found in this
area. In the event of such a mis
fortune, I can only hope that Mr.
Carlos Montoya, soon to appear
on campus, will have the fore
sight to take his guitar off-stage
with him during intermission.

Editor, The Daily;
I must say I was disappointed
in the performance of our boys at
Saturday’s game, but I was out
raged by the performance of the
pusillanimous ignoramus who
tried—and failed—to lead the
card stunts. The only thing he
accomplished was to nearly insti
gate a riot in the stands.
