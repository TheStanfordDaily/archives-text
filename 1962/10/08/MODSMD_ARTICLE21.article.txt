# Everyone Agrees—Blame Baker
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
It was obvious to everyone,
what the Indians’ problem was
as Oregon State beat them, 27-0.
It was OSU’s quarterback, Terry
Baker.
The writers in the press box un
animously voted him outstanding
back of the week. Coach Jack
Curtice called him possibly the
best back he has faced in his five
years as Stanford’s head coach.
“We tried everything against him
but nothing stopped him. His
height (6-3) and the threat of
his running (four yards per car
ry, Saturday) makes his passing
even greater.”
The Indian players to a man
admitted he was a great back.
Ed Cummings, Stanford’s out
standing linebacker, who made 21
tackles, thought that “the quar
terback rollout with its passing
and running possibilities was
made for a man like Baker.”
245-pound tackle Frank Atkin
son paid him perhaps the highest
compliment: “When the going
got rough, Baker got rough with
it. We finally started rushing him
in the third and fourth quarters,
but he threw some of his best
passes on our best penetrations.”
Coach Curtice had plenty of
good things to say about the
whole Oregon State team, too.
“They were a real fine team; they

outhustled us and gave us a good
country licking.”
When asked if the Indians were
psychologically flown after last
week’s superb effort against
MSU, he said. “Taking nothing
away from Oregon State, they
(Stanford) may have been a little
flat, but with all the good teams
that we play, it’s hard to build
up a high emotional pitch every
week. If you could find away to
gel the boys up every game, it
would sure make coaching easy.”
Stanford got off lightly injury
wise. Steve Pursell, C. B. Simons,
and Ken Babajian received assort
ed knocks and bruises, but all
may play next wek against Wash
ington State.

Curtice called him possibly the
best back he has faced in his five
years as Stanford’s head coach.
“We tried everything against him
but nothing stopped him. His
height (6-3) and the threat of
his running (four yards per car
ry, Saturday) makes his passing
even greater.”
The Indian players to a man
admitted he was a great back.
Ed Cummings, Stanford’s out
standing linebacker, who made 21
tackles, thought that “the quar
terback rollout with its passing
and running possibilities was
made for a man like Baker.”
245-pound tackle Frank Atkin
son paid him perhaps the highest
compliment: “When the going
got rough, Baker got rough with
it. We finally started rushing him
in the third and fourth quarters,
but he threw some of his best
passes on our best penetrations.”
Coach Curtice had plenty of
good things to say about the
whole Oregon State team, too.
“They were a real fine team; they

outhustled us and gave us a good
country licking.”
When asked if the Indians were
psychologically flown after last
week’s superb effort against
MSU, he said. “Taking nothing
away from Oregon State, they
(Stanford) may have been a little
flat, but with all the good teams
that we play, it’s hard to build
up a high emotional pitch every
week. If you could find away to
gel the boys up every game, it
would sure make coaching easy.”
Stanford got off lightly injury
wise. Steve Pursell, C. B. Simons,
and Ken Babajian received assort
ed knocks and bruises, but all
may play next wek against Wash
ington State.
