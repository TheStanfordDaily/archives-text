Although Terry Baker’ was Sat
urday's outstanding player’ in
OSU's 27-0 upset win over Stan
ford, the lanky quarterback
singled out the Beavers’ line play
as the decisive factor in the vic
tory. "They gave me plenty of
protection and opened up the
holes even though outweighed by
40 pounds per man.”
The Beaver line throttled the
Stanford running attack all day
and rushed Indian quarterbacks
again and again. On offense they
moved the massive Indian line
around enough for Baker to en
gineer two long scoring drives.
Stanford was bigger but Ore
gon Stale proved that size isn’t
always important. Tackle Jerry
Neil said, “We knew Stanford
was bigger but we were quicker
and harder hitting.”
The Beavers respected Stan
ford despite the final four TD
margin of victory. End Paul
Scale called Patitucci “groat,”
and, like many of the Beavers,
thought that the Indians had
gone flat after beating Michigan
State last week. “We wanted this
win especially after last year’s
34-0 loss to Stanford,” he added.
However, it was OSU coach
Tommy Prothro who summed
things up: “We didn’t know
whether we’d be able to handle
their size, but we came down
here intending to try.”
