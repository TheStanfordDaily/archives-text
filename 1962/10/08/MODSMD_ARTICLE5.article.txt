## 
### DEAN SAVAGE Contributing Editor 
Pickets continued to demon
strate against segregated housing
in Sunnyvale this weekend in the
first organized protest of this
type in the area. NAACP officials
set up the picket line on Sept. 21
after Joel float h. owner of a large
| new apartment house at 642
| Blythe. Sunnyvale, refused to
rent to Stanley Puryear, a Lock
heed mathematician and Ph.D.
I candidate at Cal.
Immediately following his state
ment to Puryear that lie “had no
authority to accept a deposit,”
Heath accepted a deposit from a
white member of the NAACP.
who then explained the deposit
was for Puryear. Heath reneged.
After some discussion, a com
plaint was filed and a trial set for
October 30.
ACCORDING to the Unruh
Civil Rights Act, Section 51 of
(he California Civil Rights Code,
discrimination in all business es
tablishments on account of race

or color is illegal.
Since Ihe institution of the act
in July 1959, the Palo Alto chap
ter of the NAACP has acted upon
at least seven violations. White
members work along with Ne
groes attempting to locate hous
ing when discrimination is sus
pected. Then, if persuasion and
explication of the law fail, court
action follows.
A suit filed on Sept. 22 against
a Palo Alto apartment owner was
settled in the Negro applicant’s
favor last Wednesday. At the
I present time, two other alleged
violations are in the hands of
lawyers engaged by the NAACP.
PICKETING will continue from
9 a.m. to sundown in hopes that
a satisfactory result may be
reached before the case comes to
court, said Mrs. Doris Jones,
NAACP housing committee chair
man. Nearly half (he units in
Heath's 28-unit apartment house
are vacant.
Eleven Stanford students joined
the pickets on Saturday.


IN COOPERATION with an NAACP effort to eliminate race discrimination in the Bay Area, students picket a new housing facility in
Sunnyvale.
