# Prof. Goheen Gives Views on Philosophy
## 
### STEVE HOGLUND 
Both the traditional view of metaphysics, associated with
Plato and Aristotle, and the contemporary anti-metaphysical the
ory, advanced by David Hume, require basic assumptions in
order that stated propositions may be understood, summarized

John David Goheen in his talk

“Metaphysics and Philosophy”
last night in Junipero Lounge of
Wilbur Hall in the third of the
Great Professor Series.
Asked to define the term meta
physics, Goheen, executive head
of the Philosophy Department,
said that it is essentially “an ef
fort to establish what you’re go
ing to lay down as your ultimate
characteristics of existence.”
IN HIS TOPIC Goheen first
presented the traditional view of
metaphysics. Plato and Aristotle,
he stated, felt it the duty of meta
physics to provide a general de
scription of existence. Both Greek
philosophers approached the sub
ject through an analysis of hu
man judgment because they felt
man’s personal beliefs are clues
to important things about the
world.
To understand the meaning of
the phrase “Socrates is mortal,”
said Professor Goheen, one must
have a theory of individuals.
This theory is necessary, he em
phasized, when we refer to speci
fic items, such as chairs. “All
men are mortal.” on the other
hand, expresses a kind of general
ity. And without basic assump
tions of abstract entities Goheen
pointed out, there is no way to
account for what these general
judgments refer to.
Goheen next discussed the anti
metaphysical theories of English
historian • philosopher David
Hume. This 18th century thinker
tried to replace the traditional
theories with modern scientific
theories by means of what the
professor termed a “summary
after-image.” Hume wished to
avoid the Platonic assumptions of
individual and abstract entities,
declared Goheen, by reducing
everything to sensations and sum
maries.
GOHEEN USED a chair to il
lustrate Hume’s theory. One looks
at the chair and then looks away.
The mental image of the object
which remains is labeled "chair.”
Hume had to make a fundamental
assumption before this was pos
sible, said Goheen, which was
that everyone who hears the
word “chair” envisions the same
object.

Plato and Aristotle, and the contemporary anti-metaphysical the

said Professor Goheen, one must
have a theory of individuals.
This theory is necessary, he em
phasized, when we refer to speci
fic items, such as chairs. “All
men are mortal.” on the other
hand, expresses a kind of general
ity. And without basic assump
tions of abstract entities Goheen
pointed out, there is no way to
account for what these general
judgments refer to.
Goheen next discussed the anti
metaphysical theories of English
historian • philosopher David
Hume. This 18th century thinker
tried to replace the traditional
theories with modern scientific
theories by means of what the
professor termed a “summary
after-image.” Hume wished to
avoid the Platonic assumptions of
individual and abstract entities,
declared Goheen, by reducing
everything to sensations and sum
maries.
GOHEEN USED a chair to il
lustrate Hume’s theory. One looks
at the chair and then looks away.
The mental image of the object
which remains is labeled "chair.”
Hume had to make a fundamental
assumption before this was pos
sible, said Goheen, which was
that everyone who hears the
word “chair” envisions the same
object.
Both the traditional view of metaphysics, associated with
Plato and Aristotle, and the contemporary anti-metaphysical the
ory, advanced by David Hume, require basic assumptions in
order that stated propositions may be understood, summarized

John David Goheen in his talk

“Metaphysics and Philosophy”
last night in Junipero Lounge of
Wilbur Hall in the third of the
Great Professor Series.
Asked to define the term meta
physics, Goheen, executive head
of the Philosophy Department,
said that it is essentially “an ef
fort to establish what you’re go
ing to lay down as your ultimate
characteristics of existence.”
IN HIS TOPIC Goheen first
presented the traditional view of
metaphysics. Plato and Aristotle,
he stated, felt it the duty of meta
physics to provide a general de
scription of existence. Both Greek
philosophers approached the sub
ject through an analysis of hu
man judgment because they felt
man’s personal beliefs are clues
to important things about the
world.
To understand the meaning of
the phrase “Socrates is mortal,”
said Professor Goheen, one must
have a theory of individuals.
