You say you’re still
not convinced that it's
cheaper to own than
rent a tux? Maybe,
friend, you’re not
aware of R A's accom
modating Super/
Charge, the kindly
plan that lets you buy
what you need, when
you need it, and make
long, low payments
(probably less than
rent). Get in on S C
today, the only way
to buy.
