# Scientist Needs To Cooperate With Humanist
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
“A complete scientific vision is
necessary to the U.S. today in
order to be able to reach the Com
munists on a mutual basis,” said
Dr. Peter Sutermeister, Swiss sci
entist, yesterday in his discussion
of the relation between the hu
manities and sciences.
His topic was “Scientific Vision
as a Basis for a Philosophy of
Life.”
“Representatives of the human
ities think in different categories
than representatives of the na
tural sciences,” said Sutermeister.
“It is desirable that they fuse
their viewpoints to some extent.”
HE ALSO said that “philoso
phers and humanists should have
a basic background in the sci
ences in order to be able to com
municate with the scientists.
Likewise, scientists should not
consider themselves self-suffici
ent: they should also be concern
ed with philosophical questions.”
In regard to (he East-West con
flict, Sutermeister suggested that
the weakness of the West lay in
the lack of a compelling goal;
this the Communists do have. He
said, however, that the Commu
nists avoid any questions as to
the meaning of their philosophy:
the West has an advantage in
their deep knowledge of man and
his conditions.
SUTERMEISTER proposed a
council of Western humanists and
scientists aimed toward synthesiz
ing a general scientific vision.
Sutermeister is the Secretary-
General of the .Swiss National
Foundation for the Promotion of
Scientific Research. He has been
touring the U.S. and visiting the
research foundations.
