# Fraternities to Gain From Cluster Plan
## 
### PAGE EDWARDS 
The new fraternity groups are
modern and beautiful living facil- i
ities, but are they a university
maneuver to slowly abolish fra
ternities? Fraternities at various
colleges throughout the nation
are gradually dissolving. Will
Stanford be next?
Hardly. The new living groups
are a segment of an overall hous
ing policy adopted by the Board
of Trustees, Feb. 21, 1957.
The policy, announced after a
year of study by the administra
tive staff, that the "long range
policy of the University, as the
ideal, is ultimately to house all
undergraduate students, men and
women, in University facilities on
campus . .
THE STAFF study accepted by
the Board of Trustees resulted in
proof that, “there is a need to
house on the campus the under
graduate men now living off cam
pus or at Stanford Village and to
improve the housing conditions
and general standards of men
now living in fraternities." The
new houses are planned to im
prove not only the housing con
ditions but the general standard
of fraternity men.
“In 1957,” said Dean of Men
David Larimer, “fraternities
seemed to be on the wane. If the
Board of Trustees desired to
abolish fraternities, they would
have done so then.”
LARIMER believes that the
new houses will, in time, improve
the academic attitude of frater
nity men and allow them to re
ceive more from their college ex
perience than they are at present.
“The new houses will change
fraternities,” said Larimer. “But,”
he added, “the change will make
the fraternities more attuned to
the university."
Larimer outlined the fraternity
living policy as, basically, one
which would instill academic re
sponsibility in fraternity men.
THE GOAL of the policy is:
1) To improve the physical fa
cilities of the fraternity houses.
' Improved facilities, such as a
group library, more room with a
special study area, and study
rooms in the fraternity will, be
lieves Larimer, create an academ
ic atmosphere more conducive to
study than existed before.
2t The presence of a faculty
advisor and slight university con

trol over the up-keep of the living
groups will, as the Trustees’ poli
cy states, “assist the fraternities
in their efforts to improve stan
dards of scholarship and conduct.
3) The more academic atmos
phere created by the new housing
will solve the over-all problem, as
Larimer views it, of too great a
dichotomy between “living and
learning” at Stanford in fraterni
ties.
WITH THIS dichotomy dimin
ished, the fraternities will be in
tune with the University.
The issue of University control
over the new living groups, as
Larimer explains it, is on the
one hand to protect the Universi
ty’s ownership of the houses and
on the other to remove, to as
great a degree as is possible, the
fraternity member’s direct con
tact with the Administration.
To accomplish this, Larimer
said he represents the Adminis
tration through the house man
ager—thus removing the mem
ber from direct university con
tact.
THE UNIVERSITY, in order to
protect its investment for the fu
ture, must make periodic exami
nations of the houses. Larimer
said his policy will not be to
make surprise examinations but
always deal through the house
manager. Also, all house bills are
paid through the manager of the
house.
The matter of vacancies in the
houses is in question. If the fra
ternity is not housing the 50-
member capacity, the university
will not arbitrarily assign some
one to the house. The university,
in order to repay the government
loan and other expenses, must
collect a given amount from the
house each month. The suggested
number in the house is 50; how
ever, if a house sustains any num
ber lower than that, it merely
creates more of a financial bur
den on each member.
The new houses will not abolish
fraternities, but will enhance
their existence. Fraternities will
be abolished only if the fraternity
does not accept its new responsi
bility, Larimer said.
So, even though the Greek let
ters are not permanently affixed
i to each house in the new group, it.
is unlikely that women from the
row will ever remove fraternity
men from their new houses.
