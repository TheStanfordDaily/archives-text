# Discussion on Helsinki Emphasizes Students' Communication Problems

Addresing a small but informed
audience in Tresidder’s Upper
Lounge last night, Helsinki dele
gate Jim Woolsey opened a panel
discussion composed of delegates
Bill Quandt, Tom Grey, and Peter
Grothe.
Woolsey explained that the
Communist International Youth
Festivals have been held every
two years since 1947. The first
held outside the Iron Curtain was
the Vienna Festival of 1959.
Woolsey then gave the floor to
the other three panelists. Grothe
asserted that every real attempt
to prevent person-to-person com
munication was made by the Fes
tival organizers, and every real
communication took place in
spite of them.
QUANDT ADDED that it was
difficult to communicate with
delegates from underdeveloped
countries because their whole
world-view is so outside ours, and
because they approach every
problem so emotionally. One
must be prepared to accept a non
rational explanation.
Grey contended that the Ameri
cans did not “win” at Helsinki;
because there was no scoreboard.
The Americans were mounting no
crusade, and the Conference was
not one at which any delegates
were making major political de
cisions. It was a success for those
who went there to learn, especial
ly about the revolutionary move
ment, which does not follow the
traditional left-right pattern out
side our own country.
GROTHE countered that the
I American delegation “scored” at
Helsinki simply by giving stu
dents from underdeveloped coun
tries factual information and
telling them where they could
find more.

Quandt pointed out that the in
efficacy of the American effort
can be overemphasized if we re
alize that for most delegates, the
Festival was only the high point
of an extensive series of Soviet
tours. The Communists did by
and large lose out in the Festival;
but they gained ground especially
in the tours of Russia, where they
relied on the natural friendliness
of the unspoiled Russian.
Grothe called the Festival a
Communist failure, estimated its
cost at twenty-five million dol
lars, and mentioned that the Com
munists may not hold another.
The principal reasons for this
failure, he said, were the hostili
ty of the Finns, the cold rainy
weather, the tight political con
trol, and the few successful per
son-to-person contacts made by
the Westerners.

GROTHE countered that the
I American delegation “scored” at
Helsinki simply by giving stu
dents from underdeveloped coun
tries factual information and
telling them where they could
find more.

Quandt pointed out that the in
efficacy of the American effort
can be overemphasized if we re
alize that for most delegates, the
Festival was only the high point
of an extensive series of Soviet
tours. The Communists did by
and large lose out in the Festival;
but they gained ground especially
in the tours of Russia, where they
relied on the natural friendliness
of the unspoiled Russian.
Grothe called the Festival a
Communist failure, estimated its
cost at twenty-five million dol
lars, and mentioned that the Com
munists may not hold another.
The principal reasons for this
failure, he said, were the hostili
ty of the Finns, the cold rainy
weather, the tight political con
trol, and the few successful per
son-to-person contacts made by
the Westerners.
Addresing a small but informed
audience in Tresidder’s Upper
Lounge last night, Helsinki dele
gate Jim Woolsey opened a panel
discussion composed of delegates
Bill Quandt, Tom Grey, and Peter
Grothe.
Woolsey explained that the
Communist International Youth
Festivals have been held every
two years since 1947. The first
held outside the Iron Curtain was
the Vienna Festival of 1959.
Woolsey then gave the floor to
the other three panelists. Grothe
asserted that every real attempt
to prevent person-to-person com
munication was made by the Fes
tival organizers, and every real
communication took place in
spite of them.
QUANDT ADDED that it was
difficult to communicate with
delegates from underdeveloped
countries because their whole
world-view is so outside ours, and
because they approach every
problem so emotionally. One
must be prepared to accept a non
rational explanation.
Grey contended that the Ameri
cans did not “win” at Helsinki;
because there was no scoreboard.
The Americans were mounting no
crusade, and the Conference was
not one at which any delegates
were making major political de
cisions. It was a success for those
who went there to learn, especial
ly about the revolutionary move
ment, which does not follow the
traditional left-right pattern out
side our own country.
