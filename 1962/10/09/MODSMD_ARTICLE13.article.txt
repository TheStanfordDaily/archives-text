## 'Lowenstein Gives Insight Into African Problems' 
### ROSALIND GREENE 
“Brutal Mandate,” by Allard K.
Lowenstein: Macmillan, 25”
pages, $5.00.
Most of us have a somewhat
muddled idea of what Africa is
all about. We might think of it as
an ideal place for an anthropolog
ical field trip, or as a land of ad
venture and wild elephants, or as
a challenging opportunity for
capital investment, but it is doubt
ful that we woidd imagine it in
terms of the human nightmare of
poverty and deprivation that Mr.
Lowenstein describes to us, “Bru
tal Mandate” is his account of a
several weeks’ journey made as a
private American citizen to South
West Africa. The trip was made
in order to obtain firsthand in
formation from the Territory, so
that this information could be
brought to the attention of the
United Nations.
South West Africa is an Inter
national Territory which as a re
sult of circumstances following
W.W. II has fallen under the au
thority of the Government of the
Union of South Africa. The South
West Territory has become a
Mandate of the Union since that
government has received her in
dependence from Great Britain.
The question now is, has the
Union of South Africa honored
its responsibilities to its ward.
Has it assisted the people of the
South West toward self-govern
ment and the various advantages
of life in the twentieth century.
IT IS the concern of the United
Nations that the obligations of
the Mandate Power toward its
ward be fulfilled, and was to this
end that the special committee on
South West Africa was formed.
In the hope that action would be
taken by the United Nations Or
ganization to help the people of
South West Africa, the efforts of
many people have combined that
attention might be focused on the
actual conditions of life there.
Mr. Lowenstein was one of these
people, and it was for this pur
pose that he went to Africa in
the summer of 1959.
As he describes them, the
circumstances of the adventure
themselves make an unusual
story, hut the real story of this
book is the plight of the people of
South West Africa, Black and
Whites, and the unprecedented
violence that this plight fore
bodes. In clear and not imperson
al narrative Mr. Lowenstein tells
his reaction to the Africans and
Europeans he spoke with, and
their reaction to him. Which is
more significant it is difficult to
say. He spoke with cultured Euro
peans in Johannesburg who, like
cellophane wrapped gentlemen
remain untouched by the flies
and filth around them.
He spoke to Europeans who
fear the government, but fear the
overwhelming numbers of the Af
rican more, and don’t really know
how to cope with either. He spoke
to missionaries who had wit
nessed men beaten by the govern
ment police until blood ran down
their bodies. He spoke to the
Tribal Leaders: “I am the Chief,
Hendrik Samuel Witbooi, of the
Nama tribe. How much do we
desire ... to come to the coun
try of America and to tell of our
troubles to the United Nations.
But until today we have been re
fused and will never be permitted
to go over to New York. We have
understood the United Nations to
be a dignified organization . . .”

AGAIN AND again Mr. Lowen
stein records the plea for help.
He found a people literally trap
ped in conditions so abominable
they beggar description. He found
enforced labor, malnutrition, dis
ease, filth, ignorance, and most of
all, fear. He found a police state,
governed by terror, enforced by
brutality, maintained by violence.
He found an apartheid racist
system controlled by leaders
whose program is a simple one:
“The maintenance and protection
of the white people of South Afri
ca as a purely white race and to
safeguard its supremacy: . .
He found a people misrepresent
ed, maltreated, deprived of edu
cation. deprived of their land, de
prived of any shred of human
dignity.
The words of the Chief of the
Herero tribe kecorded by Mr.
Lowenstein seem most prophetic:
“My people arc few; they are far
away; there are so many other
things, it, must be easy to forget
my people. What we suffer is
perhaps insignificant .. . [but]
if they do not soon remember, I
fear they will one day suffer as
my people do, for even the pa
tience of God can run out.”
On October 13, 1959, these
were then the conditions that Mr.
Lowenstein reported to the U.N.
committee. They we're a cumula
tive indictment of the policies of
the Government of the Union of
South Africa. He concluded his
opening statements to the com
mittee by saying; “It is hard to
find any evidence that despite the
clear injunction of the Mandate,
the Mandatory Power has done
anything significant in thirty
nine years to help the indigenous
populations of South West Africa
to develop toward self-govern
ment or to improve its living con
ditions; or even that it has any
intention of ever doing so . . .”
FOR ONE unsophisticated in
the woi’kings of world politics, it
is difficult to understand why ac
tion has not been taken by the
U.N. to help the South Africans,
when they are in such need of
help. But, in any case, we are in
debted to Mr. Lowenstein for
what insight he has brought to
the problem of unrest in South
Africa, and for sharing this in
formation and these insights with
us in the hope that a sane solu
tion will soon be found.

prived of any shred of human
dignity.
The words of the Chief of the
Herero tribe kecorded by Mr.
Lowenstein seem most prophetic:
“My people arc few; they are far
away; there are so many other
things, it, must be easy to forget
my people. What we suffer is
perhaps insignificant .. . [but]
if they do not soon remember, I
fear they will one day suffer as
my people do, for even the pa
tience of God can run out.”
On October 13, 1959, these
were then the conditions that Mr.
Lowenstein reported to the U.N.
committee. They we're a cumula
tive indictment of the policies of
the Government of the Union of
South Africa. He concluded his
opening statements to the com
mittee by saying; “It is hard to
find any evidence that despite the
clear injunction of the Mandate,
the Mandatory Power has done
anything significant in thirty
nine years to help the indigenous
populations of South West Africa
to develop toward self-govern
ment or to improve its living con
ditions; or even that it has any
intention of ever doing so . . .”
FOR ONE unsophisticated in
the woi’kings of world politics, it
is difficult to understand why ac
tion has not been taken by the
U.N. to help the South Africans,
when they are in such need of
help. But, in any case, we are in
debted to Mr. Lowenstein for
what insight he has brought to
the problem of unrest in South
Africa, and for sharing this in
formation and these insights with
us in the hope that a sane solu

Most of us have a somewhat
muddled idea of what Africa is
all about. We might think of it as
an ideal place for an anthropolog
ical field trip, or as a land of ad
venture and wild elephants, or as
a challenging opportunity for
capital investment, but it is doubt
ful that we woidd imagine it in
terms of the human nightmare of
poverty and deprivation that Mr.
Lowenstein describes to us, “Bru
tal Mandate” is his account of a
several weeks’ journey made as a
private American citizen to South
West Africa. The trip was made
in order to obtain firsthand in
formation from the Territory, so
that this information could be
brought to the attention of the
United Nations.
South West Africa is an Inter
national Territory which as a re
sult of circumstances following
W.W. II has fallen under the au
thority of the Government of the
Union of South Africa. The South
West Territory has become a
Mandate of the Union since that
government has received her in
dependence from Great Britain.
The question now is, has the
Union of South Africa honored
its responsibilities to its ward.
Has it assisted the people of the
South West toward self-govern
ment and the various advantages
of life in the twentieth century.
IT IS the concern of the United
Nations that the obligations of
the Mandate Power toward its
ward be fulfilled, and was to this
end that the special committee on
South West Africa was formed.
In the hope that action would be
taken by the United Nations Or
ganization to help the people of
South West Africa, the efforts of
many people have combined that
attention might be focused on the
actual conditions of life there.
Mr. Lowenstein was one of these
people, and it was for this pur
pose that he went to Africa in
the summer of 1959.
As he describes them, the
circumstances of the adventure
themselves make an unusual
story, hut the real story of this
book is the plight of the people of
South West Africa, Black and
Whites, and the unprecedented
violence that this plight fore
bodes. In clear and not imperson
al narrative Mr. Lowenstein tells
his reaction to the Africans and
Europeans he spoke with, and
their reaction to him. Which is
more significant it is difficult to
say. He spoke with cultured Euro
peans in Johannesburg who, like
cellophane wrapped gentlemen
remain untouched by the flies
and filth around them.
He spoke to Europeans who
fear the government, but fear the
overwhelming numbers of the Af
rican more, and don’t really know
how to cope with either. He spoke
to missionaries who had wit
nessed men beaten by the govern
ment police until blood ran down
their bodies. He spoke to the
Tribal Leaders: “I am the Chief,
Hendrik Samuel Witbooi, of the
Nama tribe. How much do we
desire ... to come to the coun
try of America and to tell of our
troubles to the United Nations.
But until today we have been re
fused and will never be permitted
to go over to New York. We have
understood the United Nations to
be a dignified organization . . .”

AGAIN AND again Mr. Lowen
stein records the plea for help.
He found a people literally trap
ped in conditions so abominable
they beggar description. He found
enforced labor, malnutrition, dis
ease, filth, ignorance, and most of
all, fear. He found a police state,
governed by terror, enforced by
brutality, maintained by violence.
He found an apartheid racist
system controlled by leaders
whose program is a simple one:
“The maintenance and protection
of the white people of South Afri
ca as a purely white race and to
safeguard its supremacy: . .
He found a people misrepresent
ed, maltreated, deprived of edu
cation. deprived of their land, de
prived of any shred of human
dignity.

bodes. In clear and not imperson
al narrative Mr. Lowenstein tells
his reaction to the Africans and
Europeans he spoke with, and
their reaction to him. Which is
more significant it is difficult to
say. He spoke with cultured Euro
peans in Johannesburg who, like
cellophane wrapped gentlemen
remain untouched by the flies
and filth around them.
He spoke to Europeans who
fear the government, but fear the
overwhelming numbers of the Af
rican more, and don’t really know
how to cope with either. He spoke
to missionaries who had wit
nessed men beaten by the govern
ment police until blood ran down
their bodies. He spoke to the
Tribal Leaders: “I am the Chief,
Hendrik Samuel Witbooi, of the
Nama tribe. How much do we
desire ... to come to the coun
try of America and to tell of our
troubles to the United Nations.
But until today we have been re
fused and will never be permitted
to go over to New York. We have
understood the United Nations to
be a dignified organization . . .”

AGAIN AND again Mr. Lowen
stein records the plea for help.
He found a people literally trap
ped in conditions so abominable
they beggar description. He found
enforced labor, malnutrition, dis
ease, filth, ignorance, and most of
all, fear. He found a police state,
governed by terror, enforced by
brutality, maintained by violence.
He found an apartheid racist
system controlled by leaders
whose program is a simple one:
“The maintenance and protection
of the white people of South Afri
ca as a purely white race and to
safeguard its supremacy: . .
He found a people misrepresent
ed, maltreated, deprived of edu
cation. deprived of their land, de
prived of any shred of human
dignity.
The words of the Chief of the
Herero tribe kecorded by Mr.
Lowenstein seem most prophetic:
“My people arc few; they are far
away; there are so many other
things, it, must be easy to forget
my people. What we suffer is
perhaps insignificant .. . [but]
if they do not soon remember, I
fear they will one day suffer as
my people do, for even the pa
tience of God can run out.”
On October 13, 1959, these
were then the conditions that Mr.
Lowenstein reported to the U.N.
committee. They we're a cumula
tive indictment of the policies of
the Government of the Union of
South Africa. He concluded his
opening statements to the com
mittee by saying; “It is hard to
find any evidence that despite the
clear injunction of the Mandate,
the Mandatory Power has done
anything significant in thirty
nine years to help the indigenous
populations of South West Africa
to develop toward self-govern
ment or to improve its living con
ditions; or even that it has any
intention of ever doing so . . .”
FOR ONE unsophisticated in
the woi’kings of world politics, it
is difficult to understand why ac
tion has not been taken by the
U.N. to help the South Africans,
when they are in such need of
help. But, in any case, we are in
debted to Mr. Lowenstein for
what insight he has brought to
the problem of unrest in South
Africa, and for sharing this in
formation and these insights with
us in the hope that a sane solu
tion will soon be found.

Most of us have a somewhat
muddled idea of what Africa is
all about. We might think of it as
an ideal place for an anthropolog
ical field trip, or as a land of ad
venture and wild elephants, or as
a challenging opportunity for
capital investment, but it is doubt
ful that we woidd imagine it in
terms of the human nightmare of
poverty and deprivation that Mr.
Lowenstein describes to us, “Bru
tal Mandate” is his account of a
several weeks’ journey made as a
private American citizen to South
West Africa. The trip was made
in order to obtain firsthand in
formation from the Territory, so
that this information could be
brought to the attention of the
United Nations.
South West Africa is an Inter
national Territory which as a re
sult of circumstances following
W.W. II has fallen under the au
thority of the Government of the
Union of South Africa. The South
West Territory has become a
Mandate of the Union since that
government has received her in
dependence from Great Britain.
The question now is, has the
Union of South Africa honored
its responsibilities to its ward.
Has it assisted the people of the
South West toward self-govern
ment and the various advantages
of life in the twentieth century.
IT IS the concern of the United
Nations that the obligations of
the Mandate Power toward its
ward be fulfilled, and was to this
end that the special committee on
South West Africa was formed.
In the hope that action would be
taken by the United Nations Or
ganization to help the people of
South West Africa, the efforts of
many people have combined that
attention might be focused on the
actual conditions of life there.
Mr. Lowenstein was one of these
