# STAFF OPINION
## No Vote on Proposition 24 Advocated 
### RICK SEIFERT 
Both candidates for the Cali
fornia Governorship, several
newspapers, and indeed all who
are familiar with proposition 24
(Francis Anti-subversion Amend
ment! and are to the left of Jo
seph Shell, have spoken out
strongly against the proposed
measure. Why the concern and
the public display of so much
criticism?
Although the length of the
Francis Amendment does not
permit its being reprinted on this
page, the essence of its content
can be readily summarized:
• Proposition 24 declares that
the existence, purposes, and ob
jectives of the world communist
movement, functioning through a
pseudo-political party and com
munist front groups, are a clear
and present danger to the United
States and the government of
California.
• It defines Communist and
subversive organizations and de
nies them political status and
property tax exemption. It pro
hibits members of such organiza
tions or advocates of subversive
doctrines from holding public of
fice or being employed by the
state or any public agency, or
from receiving property tax ex
emption.
• It requires teachers and
other employees of public educa
tional institutions to answer con
gressional and legislative com
mittee inquiries concerning mem
bership in, or support of commu
nist or subversive organizations.
The amendment reads “Failure to
answer question shall result in
revoking credential or life diplo
ma and dismissal from employ
ments.”
• It imposes conditions on use
of public buildings and property.
Louis Patrick Francis, con
servative Republican Assembly
man from San Mateo, authored
this proposed amendment and led
a petition campaign that secured
some 470,000 valid signatures
transforming the measure into
an initiative proposal for the No
vember ballot. Although the initi
atve method permits voters to
write laws directly into the con
stitution, fortunately it does not
guarantee their constitutionality.
THE FEDERAL courts are well
known for taking the teeth out of
such anti-subversion legislation,
and there is no reason to believe
that Mr. Francis’ trophy, if in
deed it is passed, will not also fall
prey to the Judicial Branch.
The amendment grates most
conspicuously against the guar
antees of the First, Fifth, and
Fourteenth Amendments of the
Constitution of the United States.
The Constitution forbids states to
enact or enforce laws which
abridge the privileges or immuni
ties of citizens of the United
States or deprive them of life,
liberty, or property without due
process of law. The rub is found
in section 3 of the Francis
Amendment, which gives power
to state agencies to make find
ings without a single requirement
of hearing and appeal. Moreover,
there is a complete dearth of pro
cedures governing the county
grand juries, which, according to
the amendment, would be given
the power to label an organization
“communist front,” “communist
action,” or simply “subversive.”
No right to counsel, no right to
confront witnesses, no right to
cross-examine witnesses, no right
to present one’s case in defense,
and no provisions for judicial re
view are set forth.
NOTABLY, the application of
such legislation could be more
than somewhat disruptive to in
stitutions of higher education.
The University of California’s
“Daily Californian” has shown
great concern over the effects
that passage of the amendment
might have on its campus. Last
Wednesday’s Californian correct
ly explained that “the proposition
states that any University em
ployee who is subpoenaed by any
committee or subcommittee of
the U.S. Congress or the Cali
fornia Legislature must appear
and answer questions concerning
his subversive activity. Any em
ployee who refuses to answer or
pleads the Fifth Amendment
would be fired.”
Opponents to the amendment
fear that the unknowing “aver
age” voter might give the propo
sition the majority it needs to be
come law. To many and perhaps
most voters, “anti-subversion”
legislation sounds appealing and
relatively innocuous. Without
spending further time to read the
lengthy prose found in the amend
ment, the unwary might readily
vote for a measure about which
they unfortunately know nothing.
Passage of the measure would
undoubtedly result in the institut
ing of the inevitable “witch-hunt.”
For many, the just as inevitable
“unconstitutional” ruling by
either state or federal courts
would come too late.

The concern over the possible
passing of the amendment is
therefore not unfounded. Those
who are aware of the brutality of
the proposal are vigorously work
ing to see that a majority of the
November voters “vote no on 24.”

undoubtedly result in the institut
ing of the inevitable “witch-hunt.”
For many, the just as inevitable
“unconstitutional” ruling by
either state or federal courts
would come too late.

The concern over the possible
passing of the amendment is
therefore not unfounded. Those
who are aware of the brutality of
the proposal are vigorously work
ing to see that a majority of the
November voters “vote no on 24.”
Both candidates for the Cali
fornia Governorship, several
newspapers, and indeed all who
are familiar with proposition 24
(Francis Anti-subversion Amend
ment! and are to the left of Jo
seph Shell, have spoken out
strongly against the proposed
measure. Why the concern and
the public display of so much
criticism?
Although the length of the
Francis Amendment does not
permit its being reprinted on this
page, the essence of its content
can be readily summarized:
• Proposition 24 declares that
the existence, purposes, and ob
jectives of the world communist
movement, functioning through a
pseudo-political party and com
munist front groups, are a clear
and present danger to the United
States and the government of
California.
• It defines Communist and
subversive organizations and de
nies them political status and
property tax exemption. It pro
hibits members of such organiza
tions or advocates of subversive
doctrines from holding public of
fice or being employed by the
state or any public agency, or
from receiving property tax ex
emption.
• It requires teachers and
other employees of public educa
tional institutions to answer con
gressional and legislative com
mittee inquiries concerning mem
bership in, or support of commu
nist or subversive organizations.
The amendment reads “Failure to
answer question shall result in
revoking credential or life diplo
ma and dismissal from employ
ments.”
• It imposes conditions on use
of public buildings and property.
Louis Patrick Francis, con
servative Republican Assembly
man from San Mateo, authored
this proposed amendment and led
a petition campaign that secured
some 470,000 valid signatures
transforming the measure into
an initiative proposal for the No
vember ballot. Although the initi
atve method permits voters to
write laws directly into the con
stitution, fortunately it does not
guarantee their constitutionality.
THE FEDERAL courts are well
known for taking the teeth out of
such anti-subversion legislation,
and there is no reason to believe
that Mr. Francis’ trophy, if in
deed it is passed, will not also fall
prey to the Judicial Branch.
The amendment grates most
conspicuously against the guar
antees of the First, Fifth, and
Fourteenth Amendments of the
Constitution of the United States.
The Constitution forbids states to
enact or enforce laws which
abridge the privileges or immuni
ties of citizens of the United
States or deprive them of life,
liberty, or property without due
process of law. The rub is found
in section 3 of the Francis
Amendment, which gives power
to state agencies to make find
ings without a single requirement
of hearing and appeal. Moreover,
there is a complete dearth of pro
cedures governing the county
grand juries, which, according to
the amendment, would be given
the power to label an organization
“communist front,” “communist
action,” or simply “subversive.”
No right to counsel, no right to
confront witnesses, no right to
cross-examine witnesses, no right
to present one’s case in defense,
and no provisions for judicial re
view are set forth.
NOTABLY, the application of
such legislation could be more
than somewhat disruptive to in
stitutions of higher education.
The University of California’s
“Daily Californian” has shown
great concern over the effects
that passage of the amendment
might have on its campus. Last
Wednesday’s Californian correct
ly explained that “the proposition
states that any University em
ployee who is subpoenaed by any
committee or subcommittee of
the U.S. Congress or the Cali
fornia Legislature must appear
and answer questions concerning
his subversive activity. Any em
ployee who refuses to answer or
pleads the Fifth Amendment
would be fired.”
Opponents to the amendment
fear that the unknowing “aver
age” voter might give the propo
sition the majority it needs to be
come law. To many and perhaps
most voters, “anti-subversion”
legislation sounds appealing and
relatively innocuous. Without
spending further time to read the
lengthy prose found in the amend
ment, the unwary might readily
vote for a measure about which
they unfortunately know nothing.

age” voter might give the propo
sition the majority it needs to be
come law. To many and perhaps
most voters, “anti-subversion”
legislation sounds appealing and
relatively innocuous. Without
spending further time to read the
lengthy prose found in the amend
ment, the unwary might readily
vote for a measure about which
they unfortunately know nothing.
Passage of the measure would
undoubtedly result in the institut
ing of the inevitable “witch-hunt.”
For many, the just as inevitable
“unconstitutional” ruling by
either state or federal courts
would come too late.

The concern over the possible
passing of the amendment is
therefore not unfounded. Those
who are aware of the brutality of
the proposal are vigorously work
ing to see that a majority of the
November voters “vote no on 24.”
Both candidates for the Cali
fornia Governorship, several
newspapers, and indeed all who
are familiar with proposition 24
(Francis Anti-subversion Amend
ment! and are to the left of Jo
seph Shell, have spoken out
strongly against the proposed
measure. Why the concern and
the public display of so much
criticism?
Although the length of the
Francis Amendment does not
permit its being reprinted on this
page, the essence of its content
can be readily summarized:
• Proposition 24 declares that
the existence, purposes, and ob
jectives of the world communist
movement, functioning through a
pseudo-political party and com
munist front groups, are a clear
and present danger to the United
States and the government of
California.
• It defines Communist and
subversive organizations and de
nies them political status and
property tax exemption. It pro
hibits members of such organiza
tions or advocates of subversive
doctrines from holding public of
fice or being employed by the
state or any public agency, or
from receiving property tax ex
emption.
• It requires teachers and
other employees of public educa
tional institutions to answer con
gressional and legislative com
mittee inquiries concerning mem
bership in, or support of commu
nist or subversive organizations.
The amendment reads “Failure to
answer question shall result in
revoking credential or life diplo
ma and dismissal from employ
ments.”
• It imposes conditions on use
of public buildings and property.
Louis Patrick Francis, con
servative Republican Assembly
man from San Mateo, authored
this proposed amendment and led
a petition campaign that secured
some 470,000 valid signatures
transforming the measure into
an initiative proposal for the No
vember ballot. Although the initi
atve method permits voters to
write laws directly into the con
stitution, fortunately it does not
guarantee their constitutionality.
THE FEDERAL courts are well
known for taking the teeth out of
such anti-subversion legislation,
and there is no reason to believe
that Mr. Francis’ trophy, if in
deed it is passed, will not also fall
prey to the Judicial Branch.
The amendment grates most
conspicuously against the guar
antees of the First, Fifth, and
Fourteenth Amendments of the
Constitution of the United States.
The Constitution forbids states to
enact or enforce laws which
abridge the privileges or immuni
ties of citizens of the United
States or deprive them of life,
liberty, or property without due
process of law. The rub is found
in section 3 of the Francis
Amendment, which gives power
to state agencies to make find
ings without a single requirement
of hearing and appeal. Moreover,
there is a complete dearth of pro
cedures governing the county
grand juries, which, according to
the amendment, would be given
the power to label an organization
“communist front,” “communist
action,” or simply “subversive.”
No right to counsel, no right to
confront witnesses, no right to
cross-examine witnesses, no right
to present one’s case in defense,
and no provisions for judicial re
view are set forth.
NOTABLY, the application of
such legislation could be more
than somewhat disruptive to in
stitutions of higher education.
The University of California’s
“Daily Californian” has shown
great concern over the effects
that passage of the amendment
might have on its campus. Last
Wednesday’s Californian correct
ly explained that “the proposition
states that any University em
ployee who is subpoenaed by any
committee or subcommittee of
the U.S. Congress or the Cali
fornia Legislature must appear
and answer questions concerning
his subversive activity. Any em
ployee who refuses to answer or
pleads the Fifth Amendment
would be fired.”
