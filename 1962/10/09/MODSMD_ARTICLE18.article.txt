## Future of Democracy in France Rests on Presidential System

The success of the institutions
which will succeed the Fifth Re
public is of considerable impor
tance in France today. If after the
disillusioning Fourth Republic
and disenchanting Fifth Gaullist
Republic a false version of democ
racy is instituted, then France
will doubtless decide that democ
racy is not made for her. A repeti
tion of either the Fourth or Fifth
Republic would be just such a
false version.
Under the Fourth Republic,
which was frequently no better
than an oligarchy, government
leaders and officials often paid
slight attention to their real du
ties. Under the Fifth Republic
power is delegated to a single
man who assumes authority over
the nation.
THE NEXT referendum taking
place at the end of October poses
a problem since it restricts the
election to a choice between a
stronger personal power and a
parliamentary regime similar to
the Fourth Republic. Indeed, an
other such regime will not work
very well in France. Only a true
presidential regime is suitable for
the country at this time.
The experience with democracy
in other countries like Great Brit
ain and the United States indi
cates that democracy is imbodied
in certain very simple laws, the
realization of which is democ
racy’s end. The institutions are
only a means.
The first law: The fundamental
choices which decide the national
destiny are made by the entire
nation, A general election in
Great Britain or a presidential
election in the U.S. is primarily
a political choice.
THE SECOND law: The execu
tive power, which is essential in
modern political regimes, is de
rived first from a selection with
in the party and then from a na
tional election. If President Ken
nedy governs the U.S., it is the
result of a double choice, that of
the Democratic party and that of
the nation.
The third law: The executive is
responsible to the nation. This is
true for Mr. MacMillan and for
President Kennedy as well as for
President De Gaulle.
The fourth law: There is no
democracy without the presence
of political parties. Their job is
to give the nation a language by
which it can make known its
choices.
IN FRANCE it is not possible
for a parliamentry regime to con
form to these four fundamental
laws. In fact the success of such
a regime as exists in Great Brit
ain is bound to a sociological
structure and a group of histori
cal facts which makes it a chi
mera to wish to institute it in
France. It is only the two party
system which permits the British
system to work; the power is
given to the victorious party of
which the government and the
parliamentary majority consti
tute only two sections, the leader
ship of the first acting on the
second within the frame of the
party discipline. The minority
party has the function of the op
position, and the election deter
mines their roles for the duration
of their period in office. This
functions only through the grace
of a set of customs which no leg
islation could institute in France
because of the multiplicity of the
parties.
The main point is that a parlia
mentary regime is a result of
political structure whereas the
presidential regime gives rise to
its own structure.

The presidential regime which
is commonly thought of is the
one which exists in the U.S.
Elected by the nation, the chief
of state is at the same time the
chief of government and cannot
be deposed by the parliament.
ON THE other hand, only the
parliament can make legislation,
authorize expenditures, and rati
fy treaties. It cannot be dissolved
or threatened by plebiscite. Final
ly. the supreme court controls the
balance of power between them.
Such a regime in France, neces
sitating presidential elections,
will insure as in the U.S. the for
mation of two great political con
tellations without excessive rigid
ity but obliged to unite around
certain main objectives.
Other than in the case of the
Communists, who do not repre
sent a very important force in
France at this moment, the polit
ical complex of France is not a
great deal more diverse than that
of the U.S. The institutional ne
cessity which make two people
like Mr. Goldwater and Mr.
Rockefeller members of the same
party, will oblige Mr. Guy Mollet
and Mr. Maurice Faure in France
to unite. This would eradicate
one of the causes of the French
political crises, the multiplicity of
parties.
THE ADOPTION of such a re
gime in Fiance would also serve
as an occasion to institute modes
of political participation that the
social evolution renders increas
ingly necessary. A democratic de
centralization could thus be re
alized which would act as a coun
terweight to the strength of the
central power, either through the
traditional plan of local powers
or the newer plan of “plainifica
tion democratique’ and of man
agement of territory. This raises
many hopes in France.
Thus the election of the chief
of state by universal suffrage as
President de Gaulle proposes
could be a very good thing for
France, were it to be accompani
ed by other necessary reforms for
the creation of a presidential re
gime.

tioned in this article are not sole
ly mine but have been advocated
in France by the Club Jean Mou
lin and especially by Mr. Georges
Vedel, Dean of the Faculty of
Law, Economics and Political Sci
ence of the University of Paris.

The success of the institutions
which will succeed the Fifth Re
public is of considerable impor
tance in France today. If after the
disillusioning Fourth Republic
and disenchanting Fifth Gaullist
Republic a false version of democ
racy is instituted, then France
will doubtless decide that democ
racy is not made for her. A repeti
tion of either the Fourth or Fifth
Republic would be just such a
false version.
Under the Fourth Republic,
which was frequently no better
than an oligarchy, government
leaders and officials often paid
slight attention to their real du
ties. Under the Fifth Republic
power is delegated to a single
man who assumes authority over
the nation.
THE NEXT referendum taking
place at the end of October poses
a problem since it restricts the
election to a choice between a
stronger personal power and a
parliamentary regime similar to
the Fourth Republic. Indeed, an
other such regime will not work
very well in France. Only a true
presidential regime is suitable for
the country at this time.
The experience with democracy
in other countries like Great Brit
ain and the United States indi
cates that democracy is imbodied
in certain very simple laws, the
realization of which is democ
racy’s end. The institutions are
only a means.
The first law: The fundamental
choices which decide the national
destiny are made by the entire
nation, A general election in
Great Britain or a presidential
election in the U.S. is primarily
a political choice.
THE SECOND law: The execu
tive power, which is essential in
modern political regimes, is de
rived first from a selection with
in the party and then from a na
tional election. If President Ken
nedy governs the U.S., it is the
result of a double choice, that of
the Democratic party and that of
the nation.
The third law: The executive is
responsible to the nation. This is
true for Mr. MacMillan and for
President Kennedy as well as for
President De Gaulle.
The fourth law: There is no
democracy without the presence
of political parties. Their job is
to give the nation a language by
which it can make known its
choices.
IN FRANCE it is not possible
for a parliamentry regime to con
form to these four fundamental
laws. In fact the success of such
a regime as exists in Great Brit
ain is bound to a sociological
structure and a group of histori
cal facts which makes it a chi
mera to wish to institute it in
France. It is only the two party
system which permits the British
system to work; the power is
given to the victorious party of
which the government and the
parliamentary majority consti
tute only two sections, the leader
ship of the first acting on the
second within the frame of the
party discipline. The minority
party has the function of the op
position, and the election deter
mines their roles for the duration
of their period in office. This
functions only through the grace
of a set of customs which no leg
islation could institute in France
because of the multiplicity of the
parties.
The main point is that a parlia
mentary regime is a result of
political structure whereas the
presidential regime gives rise to
its own structure.

The presidential regime which
is commonly thought of is the
one which exists in the U.S.
Elected by the nation, the chief
of state is at the same time the
chief of government and cannot
be deposed by the parliament.
ON THE other hand, only the
parliament can make legislation,
authorize expenditures, and rati
fy treaties. It cannot be dissolved
or threatened by plebiscite. Final
ly. the supreme court controls the
balance of power between them.
Such a regime in France, neces
sitating presidential elections,
will insure as in the U.S. the for
mation of two great political con
tellations without excessive rigid

certain main objectives.

a regime as exists in Great Brit
ain is bound to a sociological
structure and a group of histori
cal facts which makes it a chi
mera to wish to institute it in
France. It is only the two party
system which permits the British
system to work; the power is
given to the victorious party of
which the government and the
parliamentary majority consti
tute only two sections, the leader
ship of the first acting on the
second within the frame of the
party discipline. The minority
party has the function of the op
position, and the election deter
mines their roles for the duration
of their period in office. This
functions only through the grace
of a set of customs which no leg
islation could institute in France
because of the multiplicity of the
parties.
The main point is that a parlia
mentary regime is a result of
political structure whereas the
presidential regime gives rise to
its own structure.

The presidential regime which
is commonly thought of is the
one which exists in the U.S.
Elected by the nation, the chief
of state is at the same time the
chief of government and cannot
be deposed by the parliament.
ON THE other hand, only the
parliament can make legislation,
authorize expenditures, and rati
fy treaties. It cannot be dissolved
or threatened by plebiscite. Final
ly. the supreme court controls the
balance of power between them.
Such a regime in France, neces
sitating presidential elections,
will insure as in the U.S. the for
mation of two great political con
tellations without excessive rigid
ity but obliged to unite around
certain main objectives.
Other than in the case of the
Communists, who do not repre
sent a very important force in
France at this moment, the polit
ical complex of France is not a
great deal more diverse than that
of the U.S. The institutional ne
cessity which make two people
like Mr. Goldwater and Mr.
Rockefeller members of the same
party, will oblige Mr. Guy Mollet
and Mr. Maurice Faure in France
to unite. This would eradicate
one of the causes of the French
political crises, the multiplicity of
parties.
THE ADOPTION of such a re
gime in Fiance would also serve
as an occasion to institute modes
of political participation that the
social evolution renders increas
ingly necessary. A democratic de
centralization could thus be re
alized which would act as a coun
terweight to the strength of the
central power, either through the
traditional plan of local powers
or the newer plan of “plainifica
tion democratique’ and of man
agement of territory. This raises
many hopes in France.
Thus the election of the chief
of state by universal suffrage as
President de Gaulle proposes
could be a very good thing for
France, were it to be accompani
ed by other necessary reforms for
the creation of a presidential re
gime.

The success of the institutions
which will succeed the Fifth Re
public is of considerable impor
tance in France today. If after the
disillusioning Fourth Republic
and disenchanting Fifth Gaullist
Republic a false version of democ
racy is instituted, then France
will doubtless decide that democ
racy is not made for her. A repeti
tion of either the Fourth or Fifth
Republic would be just such a
false version.
Under the Fourth Republic,
which was frequently no better
than an oligarchy, government
leaders and officials often paid
slight attention to their real du
ties. Under the Fifth Republic
power is delegated to a single
man who assumes authority over
the nation.
THE NEXT referendum taking
place at the end of October poses
a problem since it restricts the
election to a choice between a
stronger personal power and a
parliamentary regime similar to
the Fourth Republic. Indeed, an
other such regime will not work
very well in France. Only a true
presidential regime is suitable for
the country at this time.
The experience with democracy
in other countries like Great Brit
ain and the United States indi
cates that democracy is imbodied
in certain very simple laws, the
realization of which is democ
racy’s end. The institutions are
only a means.
The first law: The fundamental
choices which decide the national
destiny are made by the entire
nation, A general election in
Great Britain or a presidential
election in the U.S. is primarily
a political choice.
THE SECOND law: The execu
tive power, which is essential in
modern political regimes, is de
rived first from a selection with
in the party and then from a na
tional election. If President Ken
nedy governs the U.S., it is the
result of a double choice, that of
the Democratic party and that of
the nation.
The third law: The executive is
responsible to the nation. This is
true for Mr. MacMillan and for
President Kennedy as well as for
President De Gaulle.
The fourth law: There is no
democracy without the presence
of political parties. Their job is
to give the nation a language by
which it can make known its
choices.
IN FRANCE it is not possible
