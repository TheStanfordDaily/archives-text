Editor, The Daily:
The main point of our letter,
and our major concern, was that
plans to invade Cuba are suicidal,
for everyone. Such plans are also
unrealistic. We repeat, there are
no reports of foreign troops in
Cuba that can be confirmed by
any respectable and reliable
source. We have examined press
clippings from more than iMJ peri
odicals, as well as news service
accounts and letters from for
eigners and Cubans living in Cu
ba. To quote other sources, such
as the “widely respected” (sic)
Ralph de Toledano, whose dubi
ous reputation in scholarly and
journalistic circles is perhaps
equalled by Westbrook Pegler, in
dicates the main reason for U.S.
hysteria over Cuba: misinforma
tion created and propagated by
small interest groups. Only in
our wildest nightmare can we sec
President Kennedy confiding his
intelligence reports to Mr. de To
ledano. To reiterate, a Cuban in
vasion would serve the interests
only of those “patriotic Ameri
cans” misinformed by scoundrels
and blinded by hate.
