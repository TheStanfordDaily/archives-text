# CCSF Goalie Stops Card Soccer Team
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
A slow start cost the Stanford
soccer team a victory Saturday.
The Cards gave up three quick
goals in the first quai-ter and
bowed 4-1 to City College of San
Francisco.
The sophomores on which Stan
ford leans so heavily were a
trifle overawed by mighty
CCSF’s reputation, and the whole
team’s resulting lack of aggres
siveness cost them heavily. How
ever if the defeat is to be blamed
on anyone, let it be blamed on
CCSF’s All-American goalie Gary
Delong.
Stanford soccer Coach Fred
Priddle rated Delong as the best
collegiate goal-tender he’s seen in
10 years. Delong often saved
CCSF by spectacularly grabbing
bullets off the foot of Stanford’s
A1 Nnoli,
The three goals CCSF got right
off the bat were the game, but
Stanford’s performance in the
last three periods was very en
couraging. The Cards were
camped in CCSF territory at least
90 per cent of the time. Stanford
scored on a penalty kick by Nnoli.
Priddle singled out Stanford’s
own fine goalie, Kent Mueller,
halfback Bill Teusch, and for
ward Nnoli as Tribe standouts.
Stanford’s scrapping play in the
final three quarters pleased Prid
dle. Stanford in the past few
years has been a country-club
team, not goal-hungry as a great
team must be. The sophs on Stan
ford’s first unit this year have

brought an element of desire to
the Farm that previously was
larking.
