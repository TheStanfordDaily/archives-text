# Water Poloists Win First Two
## 
### 
Stanford’s powerful water polo
team started its regular season
this weekend with two quick, im
pressive wins over San Jose State
and Foothill Junior College.
Last Friday Stanford topped
SJS 12-9 on the strength of nine
goals by All-American Marty
Hull. Coach Jim Gaughran said
‘‘The San Jose State game is one
that we’re glad to have behind us.
They have only a 20-yard pool
with one shallow end, which
cramped our boys and we had to
change our whole offense.”
The Spartans scored four
goals in the fourth quarter after
Stanford had substituted heavily.
On Saturday the Indians de
feated Foothill Junior College 8-4.
Coach Gaughran thought that
Foothill did an excellent job for
a junior college team. “It was a
pretty tight game for the first
half.”
