## Brandt: if Mr. K Wants War Over Berlin, 'He Will Get It' 
### 
Uniti'd Press International
BERLIN—West Berlin and Communist police last night ex
changed fire across a border river after the Communists shot and
apparently killed a refugee trying to swim to the West.
The incident occurred a few hours after Mayor Willie Brandt
returned from talks with President Kennedy in Washington and told
reporters the United States is determined to remain in Berlin. Ho
said that if Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev wants war over Ber
lin “he will get it.”
It was the second border incident of the day.''Three East German
border guards fled across another section of the frontier before
dawn. But their escape was not detected and no shots were fired.
West Berlin police have orders to fire back if fired upon or if
necessary to protect the life of an escapee. This was apparently what
touched off last night’s exchange. Police said the Communists fired
a total of at least 50 shots from their rapid-firing automatics until
Western shots striking the river embankment made them stop. At
this point the Western police stopped their firing, too.
COURT WILL RULE —WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to decide whether state authorized Bible reading or recita
tion of The Lord’s Prayer in public schools violates the Constitution.
Accepted for argument and ultimate ruling by the high tribunal
were two challenges to such practices in Maryland and Virginia.
The court’s decision is expected to establish precedent-setting guide
posts in the controversy over the separation of church and state
under the Constitution.
DEGAULLE CALLS VOTE— PARlS—President Charles de Gaulle

wide referendum vote on Dc Gaulle’s plan to have his successors
elected by the nation as a whole. Government sources said yesterday
that he will order parliamentary general elections on Nov. 18 and 25.
EISENHOWER ARRIVES— SAN FRANCISCO—Dwight Eisenhow
er, still a magic figure to the crowds, came to California yesterday to

dent, who will be 72 next Sunday toured San Francisco’s financial
district, in an open convertible flanked by the man who was his vice
president for eight years.
VENEZUELAN UNREST— CARACAS. Venezuela—The government
yesterday again suspended key civil rights and launched a roundup
of leftist terrorists after a weekend of bullets, bombs and bloodshed.
Three persons were killed and 13 injured, including an American.
The casualties were the result of a two-hour gun battle between
Communist “shock troops” and soldiers and police in a city suburb
and a bomb explosion in the Hotel Tamanaco.
