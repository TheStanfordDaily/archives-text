# IFC Favors Change In No Contact' Rule
## 
### 
On-campus open contact be
tween freshmen and fraternity
men was approved by a slim 20-18
margin at a meeting of the Inter-
Fraternity Council late Monday
night.
The key policy change was part
of a new rush program proposed
by IFC rush chairman Mike Ham
mer. The report as passed is not
official rush policy yet, but mere

ly an independent report stating
IFC’s position, Hammer explain
ed.
The new' proposal would per
mit social contact on the campus
between freshmen and fraternity
men after the third week of Win
ter Quarter.
The new contact rule prohibits
any freshman to attend off-cam
pus fraternity parties. Contact
in Wilbur Hall and during all
meals will not be permitted.
The over all rush prposal was
divided into three parts:
• During Autumn Quarter the
present no-contact policy will con
tinue.
• There will be an orientation
program for freshmen during the
first week of Winter Quarter
similar to the existing program
taking place during Greek Week.
Greek Week will in turn be re
duced to a weekend affair. The
report tentatively calls for three
scheduled open houses in about
the second, fifth, and eighth
weeks of Winter Quarter.
• Spring Quarter arrange
ments will be the same as in the
past with three open houses dur
ing the week. The new' proposal
calls for pledge dinners to bo
held on Sunday of that week in
stead of Monday thus eliminating
one rush party.
The IFC report will now go be
fore a five-man student commit
tee consisting of Eschbach and
Hammer of IFC, Inter-Club Presi
dent Frank Wallace, Stern Presi
dent’s Representative Mike Dev
ereux. and Head Wilbur Sponsor
John Steinbruner.
The committee wall review' the
IFC report, making corrections
and revisions if necessary. The
committee will then report to the
president to establish policy.
