# Tresidder Exhibits Da Vinci's Works
## 
### PATRICIA LONG 
The helicopter, the Mona Lisa,
and the first motion picture ma
chine are all manifestations of the
genius of one man—Leonardo da
Vinci. For the next throe weeks
Tresidder Memorial Union wall
feature an exhibit and program
centering around the life and
works of this universal man.
The first showing of the Venice
Film Festival award winning
film, “Leonardo da Vinci, Man of
Mystery,” will be today at 3:30,
7:30 and 9:30 p.m. in Tresidder.
LEONARDO’S scientific genius
is reflected in a display of 35
working scale models marie from
his scientific drawings, courtesy
of International Business Ma
chines. Most of these will be in
room 270.
The most unusual part of the
display is the private collection
of drawings, sketches, and paint
ings belonging to Dr. Elmer Belt
of Los Angeles.
Using his medical knowledge,
Dr. Belt, with his curator, Dr.
Kate Steinitz, has combined da
Vinci’s notes and anatomical
drawings to show how he had ac
quired knowledge far beyond his
time or, in some cases, how he
was wrong.
THE BELT collection has simi
larly combined da Vinci’s paint
ings with a treatise of the master
on painting. This collection rarely
travels from Los Angeles.
The UNESCO collection of re
productions from the Winsor Li
brary, as well as other reproduc
tions, will round out the display
of this man’s diverse accomplish
ments.
Is da Vinci’s breadth of inter
est and accomplishment a thing
of the past? Does the tremendous
amount of knowledge accrued
since da Vinci’s time preclude

brilliant and influential “gener
alists?”
IN THE FIRST of a series of
informal lectures about da Vinci,
Dr. Robert McKim of the Mechan
ical Engineering Department will
discuss those questions in “Aes
thetics in Engineering with Leo
nardo da Vinci as an Example.”
He will speak in Tresidder to
morrow at 4:30 p.m. Using slides,
McKim will attempt to predict
and describe some of the differ
ences between the new generalist
and his Renaissance ancestor.
McKim is participating in a
new design program at Stanford
which combines art and engineer
ing. His answer to the question,
“No More da Vinci’s?” is a natur
al result of his work.
Later lectures will probe da
Vinci’s genius as an artist, author,
and Renaissance man.


LEONARDO DA VINCI’S ornithopeter, or flying machine, is featured in scale model in Tresidder Memorial Union's exhibit of da Vinci's works, which opens today. The exhibit will include 35 working
models made from da Vinci's scientific drawings, as well as a collection of his sketches, drawings,
and paintings.
