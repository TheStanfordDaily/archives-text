# Stanford Physics Laboratory ToClimax Important Experiment

### 
Scientists at Stanford Univer
sity’s High Energy Physics Lab
oratory are approaching the cli
max of a million-dollar experi
ment in particle research. The
results of the experiment could
change some of the fundamental
concepts of matter.
The chief pieces of equipment
to be used are two huge stainless
steel “doughnuts” fastened to
gether in the shape of a figure
eight. Each of the hollow rings is
12 feet across and weighs 4000
pounds.
AFTER BAKING lor 24 hours
at 750 degrees F. they will be
about as empty as man can make
them, down to .000000001 milli
meters pressure of mercury or
within one part of air per 1,000,-
000.000,000 of being a perfect
vacuum.
That done, the pair of vacuum
rings will become separate race
tracks for electrons speeding
close to the velocity of light. At
the right moment racing elec
trons from each track will col
lide head-on in an unprecedented,
1000 Bov (billion electron volt)
crash of atomic particles.
That is how the ingenious “col
liding beams” experiment was
first envisioned by a Princeton
University physicist, Prof. Gerald
K. O’Neill. Now nearing fulfill
ment, it will constitute the sever
est test yet devised for one of the
most important principles in
physics—the theory of quantum

electrodynamics.
WORK BEGAN three years ago
after O’Neill had enlisted the aid
of Stanford physicists working
under Prof. W. Carlisle Barber
and secured financial support
from the Office of Naval Re
search and the Atomic Energy
Commission. Others associated
with the project are Princeton
Prof. Bernard Gittelman and
Stanford Profs. Wolfgang Panof
sky and Burton Richter.
Meantime physicists through
out the world will be watching
the colliding beams experiment at
Stanford with great interest. If it
works they plan to build similar
devices at several of the great
international centers of particle
research, including one at the
Stanford Linear Acceleration
Center.
The purpose of the experiment
is to discover whether quantum
electrodynamics (QED) is valid at
very short distances. At present.
QED is used to explain the ac
tions of sub-atomic particles in
electric or magnetic fields. The
theory docs this very will as long
as the particles get no closer to
gether than one formi (one ten
trillionth of a centimeter).
BUT, SCIENTISTS wonder,
what would happen if they could
get particles even closer than
that? Could QED still predict
their behavior accurately? If not,
would science have to change
some of its ideas about sub atomic
particles and their structure?
