### 
SAN FRANCISCO (UPD—Gov.
Edmund G. Brown last night
charged that Richard Nixon, his
opponent in the November guber
natorial race advocates “one-man
rule” in California.
In a speech prepared for de
livery at a $lOO a plate dinner in
his honor in the Fairmont Hotel,
Brown said Nixon seeks “govern
ment by executive order instead
of by democratic process.”
The governor said that Nixon
“contends that the regents of the
university . . . are unwilling or
incapable of dealing effectively
with communism.”
“He has told us he will decide
who can speak on our campuses
—what textbooks can be studied
by our children—what teachers
arc fit to be in our classrooms,”
Brown said.
“The role ho assigns himself—
censor of books, inquisitor of
teachers—is a clear violation of
the constitution of this state and
of our California insistence on
the independence of public educa
tion.”
Brown said that in addition his
opponent “claims law enforce
ment in California is the worst
in the nation and he proposes to
set up his own crime council to
take over.”
“I maintain our counties and
cities—not state government
have local responsibility for en
forcement of laws of this state,”
Brown said. “And believe me
when I tell you they do a good
job of it. My opponent’s proposal
to impose one-man rule on law
enforcement is an insult to our
tens of thousands of courageous
and efficient lawmen.”
Brown also referred to what he
called Nixon’s “continuing attack
on California’s civil service sys
tem.”
“California has the most effec
tive civil service system in Amer
ica,” Brown said. “Our state em
ployes, under the law, have guar
antees that their tenure is not
subject to the whims of changing
administrations.”
A record-shattering 7,531,211
Californians are registered to
vote for the Nov. 6 general elec
tion.
