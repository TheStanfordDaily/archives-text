## U.S. Intelligence Information Indicates Cuba Not a Threat 
### Ry WALTER LIPPMANN 
On the question of going to war over Cuba (by blockade or
Invasion) we now have available a summary of the intelligence
findings on which the Administration is acting. These facts explain
the President's decision to confine himself at this time to measures
which are short of war. The facts were put on the record last

Wednesday before the House Se--t
loot Committee on Export Con
trol by Mr. George Ball, the Un
dersecretary of State.
This intelligence estimate is
based on an elaborate system of
surveillance by sea, by air, and
by land, and there is every reason
to think that its accuracy is very
high. For Cuba is an island easily
within reach of the Navy and the
Air Force, and with modern ap
paratus of electronic and photo
graphic intelligence, little of mili
tary interest can happen without
our knowing it. We do not have
to guess about what is being land
ed at the Cuban ports or about
what is being constructed on Cu
ban territory. We know. And any
one who chooses to question the
basis of our present policy must
begin by proving that the intelli
gence estimates are wrong.
SO I SHALL quote in full Mr.
Ball’s testimony on the crucial
question of the Cuban military
buildup. “Since July, when the
volume of Soviet military ship
ments to Cuba suddenly vaulted
upward, 815 shiploads arrived in
Cuban ports. Many of them car
ried military items, supplies, and
personnel. These shipments have
consisted, in
part, of types of
weapons previ
ously delivered
to the Cuban
armed forces, in
cluding more
tanks, self-pro
pelled guns, and
other ground
force equipment.
The major ton
nage in recent shipments, how
ever, has been devoted to SA-2,
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) —
together with all the related gear
and equipment necessary for
their installation and operation.
To date, 15 SAM sites have been
established in the island. We esti
mate the total may eventually
reach 25. These are anti-aircraft
missiles having a slant range of
20 to 25 miles.

What then is Mr. Khrushchev
up to in Cuba? Secondarily, per
haps, he is baiting a trap for us
which, if we fall into it, would
throw the whole Western alliance
into confusion and disorder just
at the time when a Berlin crisis
is developing.
But primarily, Mr. Khrushchev
is in Cuba because he has talked
so loudly about helping revolu
tions. Castro has thrown himself
into Khrushchev’s arms, and is
blackmailing him. The Castro re
gime has made itself the prime
and public test of whether inter
national communism is a real
force or a lot of words. Unless
Castro can be made to succeed in
Cuba, the revolutionary propa
ganda among the backward
countries in the rest of the world
will be greatly weakened.
So Mr, Khrushchev, despite
what was undoubtedly much re
luctance, is entangled in the for
tunes of Fidel Castro.
This is the core of the Soviet-
Cuban alliance. Mr. Ball described
the Soviet intervention in Cuba
as an effort “to establish a beach
head for subversion in this hemis
phere.” This would mean that Cu
ban facilities and Cuban connec
tions with other countries in
Latin America would be used to
infiltrate agents and propaganda
and small arms and money. All of
this will not work if the agents
come from r. land that is in mis
ery and disorder.
It follows that as long as there
is no direct military aggression
by Cuba, as long as we are limit
ing ourselves to measures short
of war, one of the best responses
is to force the Soviet Union and
the Soviet bloc to carry the whole
burden of Cuban reconstruction.
That is the intent of the shipping
measures now being formulated.
They will not destroy the Castro
regime now. But they will make
it much more expensive and in
convenient for the Soviet Union
to make Castro succeed.

“In addition, three and possibly
four missile sites of a different
type have been identified. These
sites are similar to known Soviet
coastal defense missile sites that
are believed to accommodate anti
shipping missiles with a range of
20-35 miles. Quite likely several
more such sites will be installed.
“Cuba is now estimated to have
60 older-type MiG jet aircraft. In
addition, at least one advanced
jet-interceptor has recently been
received, and probably several
more are in the process of assem
bly. This type of advanced jet
interceptor is usually equipped
with infra-red air-to-air missiles.
We estimate that the total of
these advanced interceptors in
Cuba may eventually reach 25 to
30.
“In addition, 16 ‘Komer’-class
guided-missile patrol boats, which
carry two short-range missiles
(11-17 miles), were included in
recent shipments.
“About 4,500 Soviet military
specialists have arrived, including
construction men and techni
cians.”
The military buildup, in short,
consists of weapons for the army,
anti-aircraft missiles, coastal de
fense weapons, some short-range
patrol boats, a few fighter-inter
ceptors, and some 4,500 Soviet
specialists, technicians, and con
struction men. What is it all for?
To attack the United States? Ob
viously not. The United States,
using only conventional weapons,
could dispose of Cuba in a few
hours. Is the buildup to invade a
Latin American neighbor? Con
ceivably, but only if Castro were
prepared for the enormous pun
ishment that would follow. It is
obvious, I submit, that Castro is
being armed against a re-run of
the raid on the Bay of Pigs in
April, 1961. Tanks, coastal de
fenses, patrol boats, and anti-air
craft equipment would be just ex
actly what he would need to repel
another landing of Cuban exiles.
The present. Cuban military
buildup is not only not capable
of offensive action, but also it Is
not capable of defensive action
against (lie United States.

Following the increasing appli
cation of the war party In tills
country, I have turned once more
to a famous passage in Winston
Churchill’s writings in which he
discusses the rights and wrongs
of going to war.
“The safety of the state, the
lives and freedom of their own
fellow countrymen, to whom
(the statesmen) owe their posi
tion, make it right and imperative
in (he last resort, or when a final
and definite conviction has been
reached, that the use of force
should not be excluded. If the
circumstances are such as to war
rant it, force may be used. And if
this be so, it should be used un
der the conditions which are most
favorable. There is no merit in
putting off a war for a year if,
when it comes, it is a far worse
war or one much harder to win.
These are the tormenting dilem
mas upon which mankind has
throughout its history been so
frequently impaled. Final judg
ment upon them can only be re
corded by history in relation to
the facts of the case as known to
the parties at the time, and also
as subsequently proved.” In the
Cuban question the facts do not
now compel a decision to go to
war and there is no evidence
whatsoever that war is inevitable
and that it should therefore be
engaged in at once.
“Those who are prone by tem
perament ami character to seek
sharp and (dear-cut solutions of
difficult and obscure problems,
who are ready to fight whenever
some challenge comes from a for
eign power, have not always
been right. On the other hand,
those whose inclination is to bow
their heads, who seek patiently
and faithfully for peaceful com
promise, are not always wrong.
On the contrary, in the majority
of instances they may be right,
not only morally but from a prac
tical standpoint. How many wars
have been averted by patience
and persisting good will .. .
How many wars have been pre
cipitated by firebrands!”

On the question of going to war over Cuba (by blockade or
Invasion) we now have available a summary of the intelligence
findings on which the Administration is acting. These facts explain
the President's decision to confine himself at this time to measures
which are short of war. The facts were put on the record last

Wednesday before the House Se--t
loot Committee on Export Con
trol by Mr. George Ball, the Un
dersecretary of State.
This intelligence estimate is
based on an elaborate system of
surveillance by sea, by air, and
by land, and there is every reason
to think that its accuracy is very
high. For Cuba is an island easily
within reach of the Navy and the
Air Force, and with modern ap
paratus of electronic and photo
graphic intelligence, little of mili
tary interest can happen without
our knowing it. We do not have
to guess about what is being land
ed at the Cuban ports or about
what is being constructed on Cu
ban territory. We know. And any
one who chooses to question the
basis of our present policy must
begin by proving that the intelli
gence estimates are wrong.
SO I SHALL quote in full Mr.
Ball’s testimony on the crucial
question of the Cuban military
buildup. “Since July, when the
volume of Soviet military ship
ments to Cuba suddenly vaulted
upward, 815 shiploads arrived in
Cuban ports. Many of them car
ried military items, supplies, and
personnel. These shipments have
consisted, in
part, of types of
weapons previ
ously delivered
to the Cuban
armed forces, in
cluding more
tanks, self-pro
pelled guns, and
other ground
force equipment.
The major ton
nage in recent shipments, how
ever, has been devoted to SA-2,
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) —
together with all the related gear
and equipment necessary for
their installation and operation.
To date, 15 SAM sites have been
established in the island. We esti
mate the total may eventually
reach 25. These are anti-aircraft
missiles having a slant range of
20 to 25 miles.

What then is Mr. Khrushchev
up to in Cuba? Secondarily, per
haps, he is baiting a trap for us
which, if we fall into it, would
throw the whole Western alliance
into confusion and disorder just
at the time when a Berlin crisis
is developing.
But primarily, Mr. Khrushchev
is in Cuba because he has talked
so loudly about helping revolu
tions. Castro has thrown himself
into Khrushchev’s arms, and is
blackmailing him. The Castro re
gime has made itself the prime
and public test of whether inter
national communism is a real
force or a lot of words. Unless
Castro can be made to succeed in
Cuba, the revolutionary propa
ganda among the backward
countries in the rest of the world
will be greatly weakened.
So Mr, Khrushchev, despite
what was undoubtedly much re
luctance, is entangled in the for
tunes of Fidel Castro.
This is the core of the Soviet-
Cuban alliance. Mr. Ball described
the Soviet intervention in Cuba
as an effort “to establish a beach
head for subversion in this hemis
phere.” This would mean that Cu
ban facilities and Cuban connec
tions with other countries in
Latin America would be used to
infiltrate agents and propaganda
and small arms and money. All of
this will not work if the agents
come from r. land that is in mis
ery and disorder.
It follows that as long as there
is no direct military aggression
by Cuba, as long as we are limit
ing ourselves to measures short
of war, one of the best responses
is to force the Soviet Union and
the Soviet bloc to carry the whole
burden of Cuban reconstruction.
That is the intent of the shipping
measures now being formulated.
They will not destroy the Castro
regime now. But they will make
it much more expensive and in
convenient for the Soviet Union
to make Castro succeed.

“In addition, three and possibly
four missile sites of a different
type have been identified. These
sites are similar to known Soviet
coastal defense missile sites that
are believed to accommodate anti
shipping missiles with a range of
20-35 miles. Quite likely several
more such sites will be installed.
“Cuba is now estimated to have
60 older-type MiG jet aircraft. In
addition, at least one advanced
jet-interceptor has recently been
received, and probably several
more are in the process of assem
bly. This type of advanced jet
interceptor is usually equipped
with infra-red air-to-air missiles.
We estimate that the total of
these advanced interceptors in
Cuba may eventually reach 25 to
30.
“In addition, 16 ‘Komer’-class
guided-missile patrol boats, which
carry two short-range missiles
(11-17 miles), were included in
recent shipments.
“About 4,500 Soviet military
specialists have arrived, including
construction men and techni
cians.”
The military buildup, in short,
consists of weapons for the army,
anti-aircraft missiles, coastal de
fense weapons, some short-range
patrol boats, a few fighter-inter
ceptors, and some 4,500 Soviet
specialists, technicians, and con
struction men. What is it all for?
To attack the United States? Ob
viously not. The United States,
using only conventional weapons,
could dispose of Cuba in a few
hours. Is the buildup to invade a
Latin American neighbor? Con
ceivably, but only if Castro were
prepared for the enormous pun
ishment that would follow. It is
obvious, I submit, that Castro is
being armed against a re-run of
the raid on the Bay of Pigs in
April, 1961. Tanks, coastal de
fenses, patrol boats, and anti-air
craft equipment would be just ex
actly what he would need to repel
another landing of Cuban exiles.
The present. Cuban military
buildup is not only not capable
of offensive action, but also it Is
not capable of defensive action
against (lie United States.

Following the increasing appli
cation of the war party In tills
country, I have turned once more
to a famous passage in Winston
Churchill’s writings in which he
discusses the rights and wrongs
of going to war.
“The safety of the state, the
lives and freedom of their own
fellow countrymen, to whom
(the statesmen) owe their posi
tion, make it right and imperative
in (he last resort, or when a final
and definite conviction has been
reached, that the use of force
should not be excluded. If the
circumstances are such as to war
rant it, force may be used. And if
this be so, it should be used un
der the conditions which are most
favorable. There is no merit in
putting off a war for a year if,
when it comes, it is a far worse
war or one much harder to win.
These are the tormenting dilem
mas upon which mankind has
throughout its history been so
frequently impaled. Final judg
ment upon them can only be re
corded by history in relation to
the facts of the case as known to
the parties at the time, and also
as subsequently proved.” In the
Cuban question the facts do not
now compel a decision to go to
war and there is no evidence
whatsoever that war is inevitable
and that it should therefore be
engaged in at once.
“Those who are prone by tem
perament ami character to seek

On the question of going to war over Cuba (by blockade or
Invasion) we now have available a summary of the intelligence
findings on which the Administration is acting. These facts explain
the President's decision to confine himself at this time to measures
which are short of war. The facts were put on the record last

Wednesday before the House Se--t
loot Committee on Export Con
trol by Mr. George Ball, the Un
dersecretary of State.
This intelligence estimate is
based on an elaborate system of
surveillance by sea, by air, and
by land, and there is every reason
to think that its accuracy is very
high. For Cuba is an island easily
within reach of the Navy and the
Air Force, and with modern ap
paratus of electronic and photo
graphic intelligence, little of mili
tary interest can happen without
our knowing it. We do not have
to guess about what is being land
ed at the Cuban ports or about
what is being constructed on Cu
ban territory. We know. And any
one who chooses to question the
basis of our present policy must
begin by proving that the intelli
gence estimates are wrong.
SO I SHALL quote in full Mr.
Ball’s testimony on the crucial
question of the Cuban military
buildup. “Since July, when the
volume of Soviet military ship
ments to Cuba suddenly vaulted
upward, 815 shiploads arrived in
Cuban ports. Many of them car
ried military items, supplies, and
personnel. These shipments have
consisted, in
part, of types of
weapons previ
ously delivered
to the Cuban
armed forces, in
cluding more
tanks, self-pro
pelled guns, and
other ground
force equipment.
The major ton
nage in recent shipments, how
ever, has been devoted to SA-2,
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) —
together with all the related gear
and equipment necessary for
their installation and operation.
To date, 15 SAM sites have been
established in the island. We esti
mate the total may eventually
reach 25. These are anti-aircraft
missiles having a slant range of
20 to 25 miles.

What then is Mr. Khrushchev
up to in Cuba? Secondarily, per
haps, he is baiting a trap for us
which, if we fall into it, would
throw the whole Western alliance
into confusion and disorder just
at the time when a Berlin crisis
is developing.
But primarily, Mr. Khrushchev
is in Cuba because he has talked
so loudly about helping revolu
tions. Castro has thrown himself
into Khrushchev’s arms, and is
blackmailing him. The Castro re
gime has made itself the prime
and public test of whether inter
national communism is a real
force or a lot of words. Unless
Castro can be made to succeed in
Cuba, the revolutionary propa
ganda among the backward
countries in the rest of the world
will be greatly weakened.
So Mr, Khrushchev, despite
what was undoubtedly much re
luctance, is entangled in the for
tunes of Fidel Castro.
This is the core of the Soviet-
Cuban alliance. Mr. Ball described
the Soviet intervention in Cuba
as an effort “to establish a beach
head for subversion in this hemis
phere.” This would mean that Cu
ban facilities and Cuban connec
tions with other countries in
Latin America would be used to
infiltrate agents and propaganda
and small arms and money. All of
this will not work if the agents
come from r. land that is in mis
ery and disorder.
It follows that as long as there
is no direct military aggression
by Cuba, as long as we are limit
ing ourselves to measures short
of war, one of the best responses
is to force the Soviet Union and
the Soviet bloc to carry the whole
burden of Cuban reconstruction.
That is the intent of the shipping
measures now being formulated.
They will not destroy the Castro
regime now. But they will make
it much more expensive and in
convenient for the Soviet Union
to make Castro succeed.

“In addition, three and possibly
four missile sites of a different
type have been identified. These
sites are similar to known Soviet
coastal defense missile sites that
are believed to accommodate anti
shipping missiles with a range of
20-35 miles. Quite likely several
more such sites will be installed.
“Cuba is now estimated to have
60 older-type MiG jet aircraft. In
addition, at least one advanced
jet-interceptor has recently been
received, and probably several
more are in the process of assem
bly. This type of advanced jet
interceptor is usually equipped
with infra-red air-to-air missiles.
We estimate that the total of
these advanced interceptors in
Cuba may eventually reach 25 to
30.
“In addition, 16 ‘Komer’-class
guided-missile patrol boats, which
carry two short-range missiles
(11-17 miles), were included in
recent shipments.
“About 4,500 Soviet military
specialists have arrived, including
construction men and techni
cians.”
The military buildup, in short,
consists of weapons for the army,
anti-aircraft missiles, coastal de
fense weapons, some short-range
patrol boats, a few fighter-inter
ceptors, and some 4,500 Soviet
specialists, technicians, and con
struction men. What is it all for?
To attack the United States? Ob
viously not. The United States,
using only conventional weapons,
could dispose of Cuba in a few
hours. Is the buildup to invade a
Latin American neighbor? Con
ceivably, but only if Castro were
prepared for the enormous pun
ishment that would follow. It is
obvious, I submit, that Castro is
being armed against a re-run of
the raid on the Bay of Pigs in
April, 1961. Tanks, coastal de
fenses, patrol boats, and anti-air
craft equipment would be just ex
actly what he would need to repel
another landing of Cuban exiles.
The present. Cuban military
buildup is not only not capable
of offensive action, but also it Is
not capable of defensive action
against (lie United States.

Following the increasing appli
cation of the war party In tills
country, I have turned once more
to a famous passage in Winston
Churchill’s writings in which he
discusses the rights and wrongs
of going to war.
“The safety of the state, the
lives and freedom of their own
fellow countrymen, to whom
(the statesmen) owe their posi
tion, make it right and imperative
in (he last resort, or when a final
and definite conviction has been
reached, that the use of force
should not be excluded. If the
circumstances are such as to war

the raid on the Bay of Pigs in
April, 1961. Tanks, coastal de
fenses, patrol boats, and anti-air
craft equipment would be just ex
actly what he would need to repel
another landing of Cuban exiles.
The present. Cuban military
buildup is not only not capable
of offensive action, but also it Is
not capable of defensive action
against (lie United States.

Following the increasing appli
cation of the war party In tills
country, I have turned once more
to a famous passage in Winston
Churchill’s writings in which he
discusses the rights and wrongs
of going to war.
“The safety of the state, the
lives and freedom of their own
fellow countrymen, to whom
(the statesmen) owe their posi
tion, make it right and imperative
in (he last resort, or when a final
and definite conviction has been
reached, that the use of force
should not be excluded. If the
circumstances are such as to war
rant it, force may be used. And if
this be so, it should be used un
der the conditions which are most
favorable. There is no merit in
putting off a war for a year if,
when it comes, it is a far worse
war or one much harder to win.
These are the tormenting dilem
mas upon which mankind has
throughout its history been so
frequently impaled. Final judg
ment upon them can only be re
corded by history in relation to
the facts of the case as known to
the parties at the time, and also
as subsequently proved.” In the
Cuban question the facts do not
now compel a decision to go to
war and there is no evidence
whatsoever that war is inevitable
and that it should therefore be
engaged in at once.
“Those who are prone by tem
perament ami character to seek
sharp and (dear-cut solutions of
difficult and obscure problems,
who are ready to fight whenever
some challenge comes from a for
eign power, have not always
been right. On the other hand,
those whose inclination is to bow
their heads, who seek patiently
and faithfully for peaceful com
promise, are not always wrong.
On the contrary, in the majority
of instances they may be right,
not only morally but from a prac
tical standpoint. How many wars
have been averted by patience
and persisting good will .. .
How many wars have been pre
cipitated by firebrands!”

On the question of going to war over Cuba (by blockade or
Invasion) we now have available a summary of the intelligence
findings on which the Administration is acting. These facts explain
the President's decision to confine himself at this time to measures
which are short of war. The facts were put on the record last

Wednesday before the House Se--t
loot Committee on Export Con
trol by Mr. George Ball, the Un
dersecretary of State.
This intelligence estimate is
based on an elaborate system of
surveillance by sea, by air, and
by land, and there is every reason
to think that its accuracy is very
high. For Cuba is an island easily
within reach of the Navy and the
Air Force, and with modern ap
paratus of electronic and photo
graphic intelligence, little of mili
tary interest can happen without
our knowing it. We do not have
to guess about what is being land
ed at the Cuban ports or about
what is being constructed on Cu
ban territory. We know. And any
one who chooses to question the
basis of our present policy must
begin by proving that the intelli
gence estimates are wrong.
SO I SHALL quote in full Mr.
Ball’s testimony on the crucial
question of the Cuban military
buildup. “Since July, when the
volume of Soviet military ship
ments to Cuba suddenly vaulted
upward, 815 shiploads arrived in
Cuban ports. Many of them car
ried military items, supplies, and
personnel. These shipments have
consisted, in
part, of types of
weapons previ
ously delivered
to the Cuban
armed forces, in
cluding more
tanks, self-pro
pelled guns, and
other ground
force equipment.
The major ton
nage in recent shipments, how
ever, has been devoted to SA-2,
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) —
together with all the related gear
and equipment necessary for
their installation and operation.
To date, 15 SAM sites have been
established in the island. We esti
mate the total may eventually
reach 25. These are anti-aircraft
missiles having a slant range of
20 to 25 miles.

What then is Mr. Khrushchev
up to in Cuba? Secondarily, per
haps, he is baiting a trap for us
which, if we fall into it, would
throw the whole Western alliance
into confusion and disorder just
at the time when a Berlin crisis
is developing.
But primarily, Mr. Khrushchev
is in Cuba because he has talked
so loudly about helping revolu
tions. Castro has thrown himself
into Khrushchev’s arms, and is
blackmailing him. The Castro re
gime has made itself the prime
and public test of whether inter
national communism is a real
force or a lot of words. Unless
Castro can be made to succeed in
Cuba, the revolutionary propa
ganda among the backward
countries in the rest of the world
will be greatly weakened.
So Mr, Khrushchev, despite
what was undoubtedly much re
luctance, is entangled in the for
tunes of Fidel Castro.
This is the core of the Soviet-
Cuban alliance. Mr. Ball described
the Soviet intervention in Cuba
as an effort “to establish a beach
head for subversion in this hemis
phere.” This would mean that Cu
ban facilities and Cuban connec
tions with other countries in
Latin America would be used to
infiltrate agents and propaganda
and small arms and money. All of
this will not work if the agents
come from r. land that is in mis
ery and disorder.
It follows that as long as there
is no direct military aggression
by Cuba, as long as we are limit
ing ourselves to measures short
of war, one of the best responses
is to force the Soviet Union and
the Soviet bloc to carry the whole
burden of Cuban reconstruction.
That is the intent of the shipping
measures now being formulated.
They will not destroy the Castro
regime now. But they will make
it much more expensive and in
convenient for the Soviet Union
to make Castro succeed.

“In addition, three and possibly
four missile sites of a different
type have been identified. These
sites are similar to known Soviet
coastal defense missile sites that
are believed to accommodate anti
shipping missiles with a range of
20-35 miles. Quite likely several
more such sites will be installed.
“Cuba is now estimated to have
60 older-type MiG jet aircraft. In
addition, at least one advanced
jet-interceptor has recently been
received, and probably several
more are in the process of assem
bly. This type of advanced jet
interceptor is usually equipped
with infra-red air-to-air missiles.
We estimate that the total of
these advanced interceptors in
Cuba may eventually reach 25 to
30.
“In addition, 16 ‘Komer’-class
guided-missile patrol boats, which
carry two short-range missiles
(11-17 miles), were included in
recent shipments.
“About 4,500 Soviet military
specialists have arrived, including
construction men and techni
cians.”
The military buildup, in short,
consists of weapons for the army,
anti-aircraft missiles, coastal de
fense weapons, some short-range
patrol boats, a few fighter-inter
ceptors, and some 4,500 Soviet
specialists, technicians, and con
struction men. What is it all for?
To attack the United States? Ob
viously not. The United States,
using only conventional weapons,
could dispose of Cuba in a few
hours. Is the buildup to invade a
Latin American neighbor? Con
ceivably, but only if Castro were
prepared for the enormous pun
ishment that would follow. It is
obvious, I submit, that Castro is
being armed against a re-run of
the raid on the Bay of Pigs in
April, 1961. Tanks, coastal de
fenses, patrol boats, and anti-air
craft equipment would be just ex

“About 4,500 Soviet military
specialists have arrived, including
construction men and techni
cians.”
The military buildup, in short,
consists of weapons for the army,
anti-aircraft missiles, coastal de
fense weapons, some short-range
patrol boats, a few fighter-inter
ceptors, and some 4,500 Soviet
specialists, technicians, and con
struction men. What is it all for?
To attack the United States? Ob
viously not. The United States,
using only conventional weapons,
could dispose of Cuba in a few
hours. Is the buildup to invade a
Latin American neighbor? Con
ceivably, but only if Castro were
prepared for the enormous pun
ishment that would follow. It is
obvious, I submit, that Castro is
being armed against a re-run of
the raid on the Bay of Pigs in
April, 1961. Tanks, coastal de
fenses, patrol boats, and anti-air
craft equipment would be just ex
actly what he would need to repel
another landing of Cuban exiles.
The present. Cuban military
buildup is not only not capable
of offensive action, but also it Is
not capable of defensive action
against (lie United States.

Following the increasing appli
cation of the war party In tills
country, I have turned once more
to a famous passage in Winston
Churchill’s writings in which he
discusses the rights and wrongs
of going to war.
“The safety of the state, the
lives and freedom of their own
fellow countrymen, to whom
(the statesmen) owe their posi
tion, make it right and imperative
in (he last resort, or when a final
and definite conviction has been
reached, that the use of force
should not be excluded. If the
circumstances are such as to war
rant it, force may be used. And if
this be so, it should be used un
der the conditions which are most
favorable. There is no merit in
putting off a war for a year if,
when it comes, it is a far worse
war or one much harder to win.
These are the tormenting dilem
mas upon which mankind has
throughout its history been so
frequently impaled. Final judg
ment upon them can only be re
corded by history in relation to
the facts of the case as known to
the parties at the time, and also
as subsequently proved.” In the
Cuban question the facts do not
now compel a decision to go to
war and there is no evidence
whatsoever that war is inevitable
and that it should therefore be
engaged in at once.
“Those who are prone by tem
perament ami character to seek
sharp and (dear-cut solutions of
difficult and obscure problems,
who are ready to fight whenever
some challenge comes from a for
eign power, have not always
been right. On the other hand,
those whose inclination is to bow
their heads, who seek patiently
and faithfully for peaceful com
promise, are not always wrong.
On the contrary, in the majority
of instances they may be right,
not only morally but from a prac
tical standpoint. How many wars
have been averted by patience
and persisting good will .. .
How many wars have been pre
cipitated by firebrands!”

On the question of going to war over Cuba (by blockade or
Invasion) we now have available a summary of the intelligence
findings on which the Administration is acting. These facts explain
the President's decision to confine himself at this time to measures
which are short of war. The facts were put on the record last

Wednesday before the House Se--t
loot Committee on Export Con
trol by Mr. George Ball, the Un
dersecretary of State.
This intelligence estimate is
based on an elaborate system of
surveillance by sea, by air, and
by land, and there is every reason
to think that its accuracy is very
high. For Cuba is an island easily
within reach of the Navy and the
Air Force, and with modern ap
paratus of electronic and photo
graphic intelligence, little of mili
tary interest can happen without
our knowing it. We do not have
to guess about what is being land
ed at the Cuban ports or about
what is being constructed on Cu
ban territory. We know. And any
one who chooses to question the
basis of our present policy must
begin by proving that the intelli
gence estimates are wrong.
SO I SHALL quote in full Mr.
Ball’s testimony on the crucial
question of the Cuban military
buildup. “Since July, when the
volume of Soviet military ship
ments to Cuba suddenly vaulted
upward, 815 shiploads arrived in
Cuban ports. Many of them car
ried military items, supplies, and
personnel. These shipments have
consisted, in
part, of types of
weapons previ
ously delivered
to the Cuban
armed forces, in
cluding more
tanks, self-pro
pelled guns, and
other ground
force equipment.
The major ton
nage in recent shipments, how
ever, has been devoted to SA-2,
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) —
together with all the related gear
and equipment necessary for
their installation and operation.
To date, 15 SAM sites have been
established in the island. We esti
mate the total may eventually
reach 25. These are anti-aircraft
missiles having a slant range of
20 to 25 miles.

What then is Mr. Khrushchev
up to in Cuba? Secondarily, per
haps, he is baiting a trap for us
which, if we fall into it, would
throw the whole Western alliance
into confusion and disorder just
at the time when a Berlin crisis
is developing.
But primarily, Mr. Khrushchev
is in Cuba because he has talked
so loudly about helping revolu
tions. Castro has thrown himself
into Khrushchev’s arms, and is
blackmailing him. The Castro re
gime has made itself the prime
and public test of whether inter
national communism is a real
force or a lot of words. Unless
Castro can be made to succeed in
Cuba, the revolutionary propa
ganda among the backward
countries in the rest of the world
will be greatly weakened.
So Mr, Khrushchev, despite
what was undoubtedly much re
luctance, is entangled in the for
tunes of Fidel Castro.
This is the core of the Soviet-
Cuban alliance. Mr. Ball described
the Soviet intervention in Cuba
as an effort “to establish a beach
head for subversion in this hemis
phere.” This would mean that Cu
ban facilities and Cuban connec
tions with other countries in
Latin America would be used to
infiltrate agents and propaganda
and small arms and money. All of
this will not work if the agents
come from r. land that is in mis
ery and disorder.
It follows that as long as there
is no direct military aggression
by Cuba, as long as we are limit
ing ourselves to measures short
of war, one of the best responses
is to force the Soviet Union and
the Soviet bloc to carry the whole
burden of Cuban reconstruction.
That is the intent of the shipping
measures now being formulated.
They will not destroy the Castro
regime now. But they will make
it much more expensive and in
convenient for the Soviet Union
to make Castro succeed.

“In addition, three and possibly
four missile sites of a different
type have been identified. These
sites are similar to known Soviet
coastal defense missile sites that
are believed to accommodate anti
shipping missiles with a range of
20-35 miles. Quite likely several
more such sites will be installed.
“Cuba is now estimated to have
60 older-type MiG jet aircraft. In
addition, at least one advanced
jet-interceptor has recently been
received, and probably several
more are in the process of assem
bly. This type of advanced jet
interceptor is usually equipped
with infra-red air-to-air missiles.
We estimate that the total of
these advanced interceptors in
Cuba may eventually reach 25 to
30.
“In addition, 16 ‘Komer’-class
guided-missile patrol boats, which
carry two short-range missiles
(11-17 miles), were included in
recent shipments.
“About 4,500 Soviet military
specialists have arrived, including
construction men and techni
cians.”
The military buildup, in short,
consists of weapons for the army,
anti-aircraft missiles, coastal de
fense weapons, some short-range
patrol boats, a few fighter-inter
ceptors, and some 4,500 Soviet
specialists, technicians, and con
struction men. What is it all for?
To attack the United States? Ob
viously not. The United States,

April, 1961. Tanks, coastal de
