# MAKES REFORM URGENT
## Population Explosion Menaces Latin America 
### B. G. OFFUTT 
The developing countries are confronted with many obstacles in
their fervent desires to expand economic potential and guarantee a
certain minimal standard of living. Advances and programs are gen
erally analyzed in terms of the two great economic systems: Capital
ism and Marxism. These are in turn flavored with national peculi-

arities, some pragmatic, others
dogmatic; both frequently con
tributing to any intrinsic rigidity.
The subtleties of their “growing
pains’ are discounted if not direct
ly applicable to a categorical regi
mentation.
One such neglected determinant
is the present demographic explo
sion. This logarithmical increase
in population affects the econom
ic-political substrata of the
emerging nations.
This phenomenon has parallel
ed the second industrial revolu
tion, the atomic age and the space
age. Around the turn of the cen
tury the world supported a popu
lation of 1.6 billion. But in the 61
years since, this figure has prac
tically doubled. In late 1961 dem
ographers wore already estimat
ing a world population of 3 bil
lion.
ANOTHER accompanying fac
tor of the demographic explosion
has been the series of independ
ence movements in former colo
nial areas. The most profound
physical and psychological effects
of increased population have been
felt in Asia, Africa and Latin
America.
The implications in Latin Amer
ica merit closer attention, especi
ally in respect to the planning
of the Alliance for Progress. Dis
cussion of long range planning
for economic and political devel
opment is absurd without consid
ering a factor which forces large
proportions of the population to
resign themselves to social in
justice and poverty.
Latin America already has
some 200 million inhabitants.
Western Europe’s demographic
rate is ,7 per cent and represents
a relative equilibrium with the
economic growth rate. In Latin
America it is 3.1 per cent and
since 1940 Venezuela’s has in
creased by 80 per cent,
THE FIGURE of 3.1 per cent
means that every six months
Latin America is blessed with 5
million additional mouths to feed.
There is little probability that
current trends in mortality and
fertility will be sharply influ
enced by Malthus’ “natural re
straints.” Furthermore, it is im
portant to realize that advances
in medicine and hygiene have not
been the sole cause of this rise in
demographic growth rate. Aside
from the more tangible explana
tions one senses a deeper, ab
stract influence: “a wish to ex
pand.” This is not subject to sta
tistical analysis, but is perhaps
basic to 20th century nationalism.
One of the most interesting re
sults of this rampant expansion
has been (he dramatic shift in
age distribution. While in Ecua
dor 1 was overwhelmed by the
“youngness” of the population. I
estimated that 50 per cent were
under 20. Demographic data give
a figure of “61.4 per cent under
25.”
The conflict of generations is
no new problem. It occupied the
ancient Greeks and gave signifi
cant stimulus to the German Ex
pressionist Movement of our cen
tury, but in our present context
it does take on unique dimen
sions. It is precisely the factor
linking the consequences of the
demographic explosion to the “Al
lianza.”
Youth seeks its outlet in poli
tics; and veneration of experience
I and tradition disappears in the
! face of numerical force. The de
sires of these new generations are
| inherently tensions, since they
arise in an archaic social struc-
I l ure. The rigidity and vacillation
of existing social perspectives are

abhorred, and modification be
comes a common goal, pacific or
violent. In Algeria the muslim
population has a similar age dis
tribution, but a demographic
growth rate of only 2.6 per cent.
Extraneous political factors na
turally separate the two geo
graphic regions, but the extra
polations are fairly obvious.
THE SPECIFIC demands of
this wave of population growth
are not influenced by location.
Demands for teachers, schools
and work are heard on all sides.
The children of illiterates do not
want to remain illiterates. The
son is neither bound nor enticed
by the father’s trade.
With these considerations let
us turn to the Alliance planning.
It is obvious that the primary ob
jective must be to guarantee at
least the same social status to
the coming generation, to elimi
nate any increment in social de
basement. Establishing “justicia
social” is then not only an objec
tive; it is an acute limitation.
One South American journalist
has estimated that the first 10
per cent of the Alliance’s techni
cal and financial aid will be rele
gated to the formation of this
“social security.” This should
have meant 1 year of the 10 year
program. After the disappointing
first year, however, we must now
look toward late 1963 as a feasible
date of realization of this primary
objective.
AS A further explanation of
this point, Teodoro Moscoso, ad
ministrator of the Alliance, re
cently estimated that 35 million
people were “directly” helped dur
ing the first year of the program.
That is less than 20 per cent of
the population, and with the dom
inating social stratification at
least 70 per cent must be reached
before this initial goal becomes
visible.
Only then will there be a gradu
al accretion of “wealth,” a new
range of accessible possibilities
for social betterment.
This demographic explosion
colors otherwise sober considera
tions of reform with impatient
zeal. In the Middle East, Indone
sia, North Africa and on the
American continent in British
Guiana, the Communist bloc has
successfully linked its cold war
gains to the preponderant popu
lation pressure. Ignoring the
rather dubious assertions of
good neighbor altruism, the Al
liance is aimed at the prevention
of communist infiltration in the
Western Hemisphere. But it has
neither actual nor prognostic ade
quacy unless the demographic
factor is considered. Both certain
Kafkaesque administrators on
the yankee side and the stubborn
elite on the Latin American side
omit this consideration.
