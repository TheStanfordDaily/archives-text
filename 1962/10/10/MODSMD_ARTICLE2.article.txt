## 
### 
Chester Bowles and Dr. James
Joyce have accepted invitations
to participate in the Stanford
United Nations to be held next
spring.
Invitations have also been ex
tended to Adlai Stevenson. United
States delegate to the UN; Dean
Rusk, secretary of state; Averill
Harriman, roving ambassador;
Ralph Bunche, assistant to the
secretary-general of the UN; and
others.
Participating in the model UN
will be 550 students representing
the 108 nations in the organiza
tion and Red China (as an ob
server. Delegates will be given
the opportunity to delve deeply
into the agenda topics from a
non-partisan point of view.
Lawrence de Bivort, director of
SUN, said. “The most important
feature of the Stanford United
Nations will be the liberalized
policy under which delegates will
not be completely bound either to
reflect the UN voting record of
their nation, or national prejudice
which delegations feel to be in
hibiting the progress of their na
tions towards the fulfillment of
their national goals.
Previous to the opening date,
student participants will meet
with faculty and foreign students
on campus. These contacts
arc expected to help them in their
study of the UN, its intricacies,
and the policies of its members.
The participants will have the
“chance to make a significant and
creative contribution to the field
of ideas which will produce the
final political decisions,” De Bi
vort says.
Application forms for delega
tion chairman can bo obtained at
the HR Loft in Tresldder Union.
They will bo due Friday; assign
ment of countries will begin Sun
day. Each chairman will name his
own delegation and will bo re
sponsible for its participation in
the UN.
