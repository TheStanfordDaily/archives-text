# JORDAN HOPEFUL
## Fine Cross Country Team Tested Saturday 
### PETE KING 
“I’ve never been more enthused
about a group of cross country
runners than I am about these
fellows.”
So said Stanford track coach
Payton Jordan this week as he
sized up the Cards’ chances in the
opening cross country meet this
Saturday in Sacramento,
STANFORD WILL enter seven
men in a three-mile race against
teams from Cal, San Jose State.
Fresno Slate, Sacramento State,
and San Francisco State. The
winning team will be decided on
a point basis.
The Indians have added three
of the best distance men in the
country to their 1962 squad,
which included the finest group
of freshman cross-country lim
ners in Stanford history.
Heading the list of distance
men is freshman Dave Deubner,
who this year set a national high
school mile record of 4:11,2, The
record has since been broken, hut
Dave is still a contender for na
tional honors. In an intrasquad
meet last Thursday, Deubner ran
three miles on the Stanford golf
course in 14:46.3—the fastest
three miles ever run by a Stan
ford athlete and, as far as coach
Jordan knows, the fastest in the
country this year.
RIGHT BEHIND Deubner was
junior Harry McCalla in 14:50.1.
McCalla didn’t compete with the
cross-country team last year, al
though he was a standout on the
track team and turned in a spar
kling 8:52.9 in the two-mile,
fourth best in the nation.
The most heartening perform
ance, in Jordan’s opinion, was
turned in by Bob Miltz’ time of
15:02 was phenomena] when you
consider that he was out all last
season because of a broken leg,
and hadn’t run a race in over a
year. Said Jordan, “For a man to
come out and run so well against

that kind of opposition is most
encouraging, and is an indication
of the potential of this team.”
Four sophomores filled out the
top seven. Weym Kirkland, who
last year set an all-time Stanford
frosh mark of 20:53 for the 4.2-
miles course, was limed in 15:15,
Paul Schlicke and Harlan An
drews, who had the third and
fourth best 1961 times, finished
in 15:27 and 15:33, respectively.
John Beck came in with a 15:20
clocking, but will be ineligible
for competition until Spring
Quarter.
ALTHOUGH out for two weeks
because of an appendix operation,
Dave Stineback will soon rejoin
the team. Stineback had the third
fastest time last season at 21:08.6.
In addition to Deubner, McCal
la, Miltz, Schlicke, Andrews, and
Kirkland, Jordan has named jun
ior Bill Pratt to this Saturday’s
seven-man team. Pratt was a con
sistent point-getter last year, with
a best time of 21:20.
Last year, against some of the
best distance talent in the coun
try, Satnford compiled an 11-4
mark, winning seven of eight
meets with Big Six schols.
JORDAN FIGURES the Indi
ans to do even better this year.
Looking back on his six years as
head track coach, he remarked,
“This is the deepest, best balanced
cross-country team I’ve had since
I’ve been here.”
The most grueling test of the
schedule faces Stanford next Fri
day, when they host San Jose
State. The Spartans were second
nationally last year, have lost no
body, and have gained three good
runners. Although San Jose
trounced the Indians twice last
year, Jordan rates his team as
much more improved than the
Spartans. He concedes that they
are in better early season shape
than Stanford, hut gives his boys
the edge in potential.
“I’ve never been more enthused
about a group of cross country
runners than I am about these
fellows.”

“I’ve never been more enthused
about a group of cross country
runners than I am about these
fellows.”
So said Stanford track coach
Payton Jordan this week as he
sized up the Cards’ chances in the
opening cross country meet this
Saturday in Sacramento,
STANFORD WILL enter seven
men in a three-mile race against
teams from Cal, San Jose State.
Fresno Slate, Sacramento State,
and San Francisco State. The
winning team will be decided on
a point basis.
The Indians have added three
of the best distance men in the
country to their 1962 squad,
which included the finest group
of freshman cross-country lim
ners in Stanford history.
Heading the list of distance
men is freshman Dave Deubner,
who this year set a national high
school mile record of 4:11,2, The
record has since been broken, hut
Dave is still a contender for na
tional honors. In an intrasquad
meet last Thursday, Deubner ran
three miles on the Stanford golf
course in 14:46.3—the fastest
three miles ever run by a Stan
ford athlete and, as far as coach
Jordan knows, the fastest in the
country this year.
RIGHT BEHIND Deubner was
junior Harry McCalla in 14:50.1.
McCalla didn’t compete with the
cross-country team last year, al
though he was a standout on the
track team and turned in a spar
kling 8:52.9 in the two-mile,
fourth best in the nation.
The most heartening perform
ance, in Jordan’s opinion, was
turned in by Bob Miltz’ time of
15:02 was phenomena] when you
consider that he was out all last
season because of a broken leg,
and hadn’t run a race in over a
year. Said Jordan, “For a man to
come out and run so well against

that kind of opposition is most
encouraging, and is an indication
of the potential of this team.”
Four sophomores filled out the
top seven. Weym Kirkland, who
last year set an all-time Stanford
frosh mark of 20:53 for the 4.2-
miles course, was limed in 15:15,
Paul Schlicke and Harlan An
drews, who had the third and
fourth best 1961 times, finished
in 15:27 and 15:33, respectively.
John Beck came in with a 15:20
clocking, but will be ineligible
for competition until Spring
Quarter.
ALTHOUGH out for two weeks
because of an appendix operation,
Dave Stineback will soon rejoin
the team. Stineback had the third
fastest time last season at 21:08.6.
In addition to Deubner, McCal
la, Miltz, Schlicke, Andrews, and
Kirkland, Jordan has named jun
ior Bill Pratt to this Saturday’s
seven-man team. Pratt was a con
sistent point-getter last year, with
a best time of 21:20.
Last year, against some of the
best distance talent in the coun
try, Satnford compiled an 11-4
mark, winning seven of eight
meets with Big Six schols.
JORDAN FIGURES the Indi
ans to do even better this year.
Looking back on his six years as
head track coach, he remarked,
“This is the deepest, best balanced
cross-country team I’ve had since
I’ve been here.”
The most grueling test of the
schedule faces Stanford next Fri
day, when they host San Jose
State. The Spartans were second
nationally last year, have lost no
body, and have gained three good
runners. Although San Jose
trounced the Indians twice last
year, Jordan rates his team as
much more improved than the
Spartans. He concedes that they
are in better early season shape

are in better early season shape
than Stanford, hut gives his boys
the edge in potential.
“I’ve never been more enthused
about a group of cross country
runners than I am about these
fellows.”
So said Stanford track coach
Payton Jordan this week as he
sized up the Cards’ chances in the
opening cross country meet this
Saturday in Sacramento,
STANFORD WILL enter seven
men in a three-mile race against
teams from Cal, San Jose State.
Fresno Slate, Sacramento State,
and San Francisco State. The
winning team will be decided on
a point basis.
The Indians have added three
of the best distance men in the
country to their 1962 squad,
which included the finest group
of freshman cross-country lim
ners in Stanford history.
Heading the list of distance
men is freshman Dave Deubner,
who this year set a national high
school mile record of 4:11,2, The
record has since been broken, hut
Dave is still a contender for na
tional honors. In an intrasquad
meet last Thursday, Deubner ran
three miles on the Stanford golf
course in 14:46.3—the fastest
three miles ever run by a Stan
ford athlete and, as far as coach
Jordan knows, the fastest in the
country this year.
RIGHT BEHIND Deubner was
junior Harry McCalla in 14:50.1.
McCalla didn’t compete with the
cross-country team last year, al
though he was a standout on the
track team and turned in a spar
kling 8:52.9 in the two-mile,
fourth best in the nation.
The most heartening perform
ance, in Jordan’s opinion, was
turned in by Bob Miltz’ time of
15:02 was phenomena] when you
consider that he was out all last
season because of a broken leg,
and hadn’t run a race in over a
year. Said Jordan, “For a man to
come out and run so well against

that kind of opposition is most
encouraging, and is an indication
of the potential of this team.”
Four sophomores filled out the
top seven. Weym Kirkland, who
last year set an all-time Stanford
frosh mark of 20:53 for the 4.2-
miles course, was limed in 15:15,
Paul Schlicke and Harlan An
drews, who had the third and
fourth best 1961 times, finished
in 15:27 and 15:33, respectively.
John Beck came in with a 15:20
clocking, but will be ineligible
for competition until Spring
Quarter.
ALTHOUGH out for two weeks
because of an appendix operation,
Dave Stineback will soon rejoin
the team. Stineback had the third
fastest time last season at 21:08.6.
In addition to Deubner, McCal
la, Miltz, Schlicke, Andrews, and
Kirkland, Jordan has named jun
ior Bill Pratt to this Saturday’s
seven-man team. Pratt was a con
sistent point-getter last year, with
a best time of 21:20.
Last year, against some of the
best distance talent in the coun
try, Satnford compiled an 11-4
mark, winning seven of eight
meets with Big Six schols.
JORDAN FIGURES the Indi
ans to do even better this year.
Looking back on his six years as
head track coach, he remarked,
“This is the deepest, best balanced
cross-country team I’ve had since
I’ve been here.”
The most grueling test of the
schedule faces Stanford next Fri
day, when they host San Jose
State. The Spartans were second
nationally last year, have lost no
body, and have gained three good
runners. Although San Jose
trounced the Indians twice last
year, Jordan rates his team as
much more improved than the
Spartans. He concedes that they
are in better early season shape
than Stanford, hut gives his boys
the edge in potential.
