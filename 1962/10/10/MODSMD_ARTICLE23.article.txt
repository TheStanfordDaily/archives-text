## Coast Football Stages Comeback Glenn Alford

Wot in ’ell is happening to West Coast football?
Long one ol the nation’s most lightly-regarded areas with regard
to big time grid competition, the Far West suddenly has rocketed
into national prominence with its shocking upsets of Big Ten and
Southeastern Conference teams. Usually, one, or possibly even two,
western outfits could hold their own in fast company, but the rest
of the teams took their lumps in top-level football.
The last three years illustrate this clearly. In two seasons Jim
Owens’ Washington crew crated and buried Wisconsin in the Rose

Bowl, and struck early to outclass
Minnesota in that same Pasadena
Arena two years ago. But they
were the only West Coast team in
seven years to win over a Big
Ten in the Rose Bowl and one of
three teams ever to beat a Big
Ten club there.
Last year, a weak champion
ship team from UCLA, which had
lost to a second-division Big Ten
outfit, Michigan, 29-6, earlier in
the year, won the right to get
trampled by Minnesota’s “Thun
dering Herd” in the post-season
classic. UCLA might have beaten
the three weakest Big Ten teams,
but was mismatched in what was
billed as a classic post-season
game.
Such a mismatch between Big
Ten and AAWU can’t happen this
year, as the four highest-rated
Big Ten teams have been toppled

or lied by AAWU clubs. Ohio State lost to UCLA, figured fourth or
fifth best in the AAWU, 8-7, and Michigan State lost to Stanford.
USC beat lowa 7-0 and Washington tied Purdue 7-7, with both
Purdue and lowa previously having been prospective members of
the wire services’ top twenty ratings. USC also knocked off Duke,
figured to be one of the best in the South. Thus prestige has never
been higher for the AAWU. And the prestige for the number one
team in the AAWU will be enormous.
As of this moment, none of the six teams in the AAWU can be
counted out of the pennant race. Washington and USC, pre-season
favorites, still rule as such. Both are undefeated in three outings.
Stanford and UCLA rate right behind them. The Cards are 2-1 and
UCLA has won its only game (but what a game). Then comes
Washington State (2-0-1) and Cal (1-2).
Experts Favor SC, Washington
This writer still favors Stanford, but with most of the so-called
“experts” favoring USC and Washington, it’s interesting to see how
the coaches of those two teams rate their organizations.
Coach Jim Owens of Washington rates USC as his strongest
opposition, with Stanford and UCLA coming on strong, and Cal and
the Washington State Cougars fighting to stay out of the cellar.
Of his own team, Owens says that his running backs and ends
are his strongest positions, and picks quarterback and center as the
weakest spots. People who follow the Huskies may be excused for
showing surprise at this analysis, since center Ray Mansfield has
been almost everyone’s choice as All-American center.
USC mentor John McKay has this to say about this year’s
version of the Trojans. “Better team speed should improve both our
offense and defense. If we are not as unfortunate as last year in
injuries, we should have an improved team. This is also a very
young team, with only 16 returning lettermen, and we are looking for
some come-through performances from many of the newcomers.”
McKay rates his offense as his strongest point, with such as end
Hal Bedsole, fullback Ben Wilson, scatback Willie Brown, and quar
terbacks Pete Beathard and Bill Nelson able to score from any
point on the field. McKay doesn't rate his defense particularly high,
but SC has held three opponents to 10 points, including a 7-0 shutout
over high-scoring lowa.
McKay goes along with Owens in rating Stanford and UCLA,
along with the other’s team, as the toughest in the league.
Don't Count Stanford Out
I said it before, and I’ll say it again. “Watch Stanford!” What
team wouldn’t have a letdown after beating Michigan Stale, and
before its first league contest?
Washington State, next week’s opponent, has only two games
against AAWN opponents, but can go to the Rose Bowl if it has an
outstanding won-loss record. They’ll be ready for Stanford.
If Stanford wins, it’s “Katy Bar the Door!”
