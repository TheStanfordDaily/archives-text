President Sterling announced
his selection of five students to
serve on the Student Affairs and
Services Committee, headed by
faculty members.
Charles Bischoff, William A.
Butler, Karen Halvorsen, Armin
Rosencranz and Maureen Strain
were chosen yesterday from a list
of ten prospects submitted to
Sterling by ASSU President Ro
sencranz. Students have never
served on the faculty committee;
the five selected will be full vot
ing members.
At the first combined meeting
of students and faculty this after
noon, discussion was held on
Stanford's overnight policy, said
Rosencranz.
Agitation last spring for a
move to include students on the
Student Affairs committee was
squelched by a vo*e of the faculty
group who were not sure that
“having students on the commit
tee would help its work.” When
the members met last week, "the
feeling was different,” reported
Professor Eric Hutchinson, chair
man of the committee.
Other faculty committees have
been informed of students’ desire
to work with them in order to
better contribute to the work
done by University groups. The
decision whether or not to incor
porate student members will be
left to each group’s discretion.
