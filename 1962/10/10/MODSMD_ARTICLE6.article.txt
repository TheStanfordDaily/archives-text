## Foreign Ministers Recognize Threat' in Cuban Armament 
### 
Utiited Press International
WASHINGTON The United States scored a major diplomatic suc
cess with the unanimous recognition by the hemisphere foreign
ministers that Russia’s military presence in Cuba constitutes a
threat to all.
Hitherto, this point had not been accepted by such large coun
tries as Brazil, Chile and Mexico.
The big step forward of the conference was to weld together
different views into a common posture based on the premise that
“the Sino-Soviet intervention in Cuba ... is an attempt to convert
the island into an armed base for Communist penetration of the
Americas and subversion of the democratic institutions of the
hemisphere.”
The Latin American diplomats feel that U.S. success was due
largely to the personal ability of Secretary of State Dean Rusk in
conveying to the visiting ministers the Kennedy administration’s
sense of urgency about the Soviet-backed regime of Fidel Castro.
One minister described Rusk’s handling of the two-day closed
conference at the State Department last week as “brilliant.” Another
said he was “very comforted” to see that leadership has passed into
the hands of such “a clearminded and highly intelligent man.”
ADENAUER ASSERTS POLlCY— BONN—Chancellor Konrad Ade
nauer told parliament in a policy statement yesterday it would be
“senseless” for West Germany to take any initiative in the East-
West deadlock as long as the Soviet Union insists on a divided
Germany and a subjugated West Berlin.
The 87-year-old chancellor thus rejected demands from his oppo
sition at home and hints from his allies, particularly the United
States, that he should offer some suggestions to ease the stalemate
over Berlin and Germany.
The chancellor said his government wants to improve its rela
tions with Moscow but can do this only if the Communists show
readiness for a genuine peace settlement in Germany.
CROWD PROTESTS SLAYING- BERLIN-A West Berlin crowd
shouted "murderers—murderers!” at the Communists yesterday as
a diver recovered the body of an East German refugee.
The mid-stream slaying of the refugee aroused new anger among
West Berliners just a day after the Soviets summarily rejected a
Western protest against Communist refusal to let a British ambu
lance go to the aid of a refugee wounded in an escape attempt
last week.
The East German plucked from the river yesterday morning
after a nightlong search by Communist patrol boats was the 44th
refugee known to have been killed while trying to flee to West Berlin
since the Communists put up their anti-refugee wall.

The East German plucked from the river yesterday morning
after a nightlong search by Communist patrol boats was the 44th

WASHINGTON The United States scored a major diplomatic suc
cess with the unanimous recognition by the hemisphere foreign
ministers that Russia’s military presence in Cuba constitutes a
threat to all.
Hitherto, this point had not been accepted by such large coun
tries as Brazil, Chile and Mexico.
The big step forward of the conference was to weld together
different views into a common posture based on the premise that
“the Sino-Soviet intervention in Cuba ... is an attempt to convert
the island into an armed base for Communist penetration of the
Americas and subversion of the democratic institutions of the
hemisphere.”
The Latin American diplomats feel that U.S. success was due
largely to the personal ability of Secretary of State Dean Rusk in
conveying to the visiting ministers the Kennedy administration’s
sense of urgency about the Soviet-backed regime of Fidel Castro.
One minister described Rusk’s handling of the two-day closed
conference at the State Department last week as “brilliant.” Another
said he was “very comforted” to see that leadership has passed into
the hands of such “a clearminded and highly intelligent man.”
ADENAUER ASSERTS POLlCY— BONN—Chancellor Konrad Ade
nauer told parliament in a policy statement yesterday it would be
“senseless” for West Germany to take any initiative in the East-
West deadlock as long as the Soviet Union insists on a divided
Germany and a subjugated West Berlin.
The 87-year-old chancellor thus rejected demands from his oppo
sition at home and hints from his allies, particularly the United
States, that he should offer some suggestions to ease the stalemate
over Berlin and Germany.
The chancellor said his government wants to improve its rela
tions with Moscow but can do this only if the Communists show
readiness for a genuine peace settlement in Germany.

shouted "murderers—murderers!” at the Communists yesterday as
a diver recovered the body of an East German refugee.
The mid-stream slaying of the refugee aroused new anger among
West Berliners just a day after the Soviets summarily rejected a
Western protest against Communist refusal to let a British ambu
lance go to the aid of a refugee wounded in an escape attempt
last week.
