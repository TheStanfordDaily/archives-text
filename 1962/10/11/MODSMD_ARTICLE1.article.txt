# Friend Says Mann Tight-Lipped to Police

### STEVE GRUBER 
Robert Mann. ex-Stanford sophomore, who was sentenced by an
East German court to a fifteen-month prison term last January, re
fused to give any information concerning his methods for helping
refugees escape, his friend Joan Glenn revealed last night in an
interview over KZSU.
“Bob may be released by Christmas, because the propaganda
value of his imprisonment is gone,” she added.

In January, while a student at-t
Stanford-in-Germany, Mann was
captured as he attempted to free
East German Uwe Stuhrberg and
several others. Miss Glenn re
ported that during his first six
weeks of imprisonment, he “re
vealed nothing, which is quite a
feat oven for one accustomed
to Vopo interrogations.” His si
lence enabled several more refu
gees to flee successfully from
East Berlin.
PETE ZIMMERMAN, who in
terviewed her on the program,
brought out several previously
undisclosed facts concerning the
manner in which the students,
mostly foreigners, operated. Miss
Glenn, w’ho worked closely with
Mann, stated that the process of
bringing refugees across the bor
der took approximately twelve
hours because of the safety fac
tors that Wore employed.
“On a typical day, we started
at about 11 a.m. and sent test
persons through each of the
gates. They walked around East
Berlin for an hour and then re
turned, to check Vopo border pro
cedures for that day.

Before the testers returned, we
would line up the people who
would carry the false identifica
tion cards to the East Berlin sec
tor. We rehearsed them in the
stories they would need to know
if captured. Each person learned
the necessary facts about a par
ticular town in Switzerland or
Belgium which he would claim to
be a native of.
"BETWEEN 3 and 5 o'clock
these people would be sent in
with Swiss or Belgian passes. As
long as their passes were not
registered, everything was fine.
In only a few cases were these
people challenged upon their re
turn to West Berlin.
The identification card carriers
went to the refugees’ homes and
gave them their cards. They they
followed the East Berliners to the
border, and stood in line about
three persons back from the refu
gee. This tended to give the refu
gee a feeling of reassurance,”
Miss Glenn said.
Mann was captured as he stood
in line at the border behind Uwe
Stuhrberg. Mann was immedi
ately thrown into prison but
Stuhrberg was given a one-year
suspended sentence.
QUESTIONED about her feel
ings at the lime, Miss Glenn
stated; “We were a little blind to
any danger. We wanted to help.
I know this sounds naive but
when you are asked for help by
one of the East Germans it is im
possible to say no.”
Joan added “Bob’s father took
it calmly. At first he did not un
derstand why Bob did it. How
ever after seeing East Berlin he
quickly changed his mind.”
