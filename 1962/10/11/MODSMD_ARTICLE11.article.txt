# Segregation
## 
### 
Over the years at Stanford many traditions have come and
gone without anyone noticing their coming or going, but one
stays on that everyone is conscious of. While sacrilegious students
and faculty pleasantly defame Jane Stanford’s name by violating
the smoking ban on Inner Quad, another tradition lives on. The
persistence of this tradition oppresses a minority and discourages
the creative energies of the majority. Stanford is denying equal
rights to an important minority of its students because they are
different. While the university communities of the world look on,
Stanford persists in defending segregation.
Hie fact is that it is more difficult to integrate Stanford-in-the-
Stadium than the University of Mississippi. It is more difficult for
a Stanford dollie to enter the men’s rooting section than for James
Meredith to enter Oh 1 Miss. A little partisan social action is called
for. Maybe a sit-in demonstration by the oppressed minority.
Even while the dying cries for integrated housing in Stern
persist, Stanford men segregate Stanford women every alternate
Saturday afternoon. “We'd like to sleep with you, but we won’t
sit with you.”
