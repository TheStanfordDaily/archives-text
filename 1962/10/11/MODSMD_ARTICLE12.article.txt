# Constitution

A committee of Legislature is presently at work drafting a
new constitution for the Associated Students. This evening the
entire Legislature will begin to discuss and to alter the proposed
document. For a new constitution to replace the present one will
require a two-thirds vote of the student body and, of course, the
approval of the Board of Trustees,
Hardly a single student government leader likes the present
Constitution. James Woolsey, administrative assistant to ASSU
President Annin Hosencranz, has called the Constitution “unrepre
sentative, inoperative, and illogical.” From the lack of interest in
Legislature’s business it is perfectly apparent that students could
not care less about student government under the present system.
A change is imperative.
Whenever constitutional conventions convene, there is likely
to be prolonged discussion of the purpose of government—and so
it is with the ASSU. Briefly, the purpose of the student constitution
should be to provide for a regular channel for the expression of
student opinion. Everyone can agree on this much. Disagreement
arises over the question of how much authority the student gov
ernment should exercise.
Last year when a new constitution was presented in a refer
endum, it was defeated, at least in part, because the fraternities
feared that the inter-fraternity discipline board would have lost
jurisdiction over some discipline cases affecting fraternity mem
bers. Some voters also objected to the constitution because it pro
vided for centralized control oxer what should be autonomous
student organizations. This control would have been exercised by
the expanded Legislature of 120 members. The size of Legislature,
itself, was both a strong and weak feature. The Legislature would
have been an extremely accurate representation of student opinion
since every living group would have been represented, but the size
of the body would have militated against coherent debate. Fur
thermore, the graduate students would have been represented ac
cording to their actual numbers rather than according to their in
terest in student government. That situation would have been a
gross misrepresentation of student opinion. The provision for
proxy voting would also have resulted in misrepresentation since
any representative of the graduate school could have arrived at a
meeting with the proxy votes of all those graduate students who
did not have the interest to attend. One man could have wielded
thirty votes.
In the next proposed constitution these flaws should he re
moved. They will have to be removed if the document is to be
approved by the student electorate.
