Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Eating Clubs
commend the fraternity system
on their move, as stated in yes
terday’s Daily, to promote a more
cordial and realistic policy with
regard to the freshmen men.
The clubs, due to their different
internal structure, have never
felt the need to establish a de
fined set of freshmen regulations.
Thus at present, the clubs already
have a completely relaxed policy
of contact with the freshmen
men. The Interclub Council has
always encouraged each club to
engage in informal contact with
as large a freshman group as it
desires, and to date, the council
has never been forced to with
draw from what is often express
ed as a “liberal” policy.
The ICC, as does each of the
clubs, feels that upperclass
friendships made during the early
part of their Stanford career can
only help to enlarge the scope of
freshman men and thereby make
their first year as realistic a year
as possible with regard to their
outlook for the following three.
With the added interest in “rush”
(the clubs feel that the word
“rush” connotes only the nega
tive aspects of the present system
of new membership and hope to

eliminate the word entirely)
methods of the past few years,
the clubs this year plan to expand
their informal contact to such a
degree that formal contact may
be made as informal as possible,
with this special period merely
serving to finalize decisions not
forcing rapid, haphazard choices
after four or five days of what is
now superficial and unrealistic
contact (not to mention the finan
cial, academic and psychological
prices paid by this system.
The clubs are aware of the dif
ferences between the three
groups presently involved in
seeking new members but hope
that those differences can be
molded into a membership policy
which, while furthering the needs
of the Wilbur system, can also
help to make the upperclass
groups far more rewarding to
new members because they will
have made rational choices after
having been exposed to the vari
ous living systems at Stanford.
Thus do the clubs join the frater
nities in expressing their hope
that a new, improved program of
“rushing” may be found—and
that this system be beneficial to
Stanford University as a whole.

of contact with the freshmen
men. The Interclub Council has
always encouraged each club to
engage in informal contact with
as large a freshman group as it
desires, and to date, the council
has never been forced to with
draw from what is often express
ed as a “liberal” policy.
The ICC, as does each of the
clubs, feels that upperclass
friendships made during the early
part of their Stanford career can
only help to enlarge the scope of
freshman men and thereby make
their first year as realistic a year
as possible with regard to their
outlook for the following three.
With the added interest in “rush”
(the clubs feel that the word
“rush” connotes only the nega
tive aspects of the present system
of new membership and hope to

eliminate the word entirely)
methods of the past few years,
the clubs this year plan to expand
their informal contact to such a
degree that formal contact may
be made as informal as possible,
with this special period merely
serving to finalize decisions not
forcing rapid, haphazard choices
after four or five days of what is
now superficial and unrealistic
contact (not to mention the finan
cial, academic and psychological
prices paid by this system.
The clubs are aware of the dif
ferences between the three
groups presently involved in
seeking new members but hope
that those differences can be
molded into a membership policy
which, while furthering the needs
of the Wilbur system, can also
help to make the upperclass
groups far more rewarding to
new members because they will
have made rational choices after
having been exposed to the vari
ous living systems at Stanford.
Thus do the clubs join the frater
nities in expressing their hope
that a new, improved program of
“rushing” may be found—and
that this system be beneficial to
Stanford University as a whole.

The Stanford Eating Clubs
commend the fraternity system
on their move, as stated in yes
terday’s Daily, to promote a more
cordial and realistic policy with
regard to the freshmen men.
The clubs, due to their different
internal structure, have never
felt the need to establish a de
fined set of freshmen regulations.
Thus at present, the clubs already
have a completely relaxed policy
of contact with the freshmen
men. The Interclub Council has

engage in informal contact with
as large a freshman group as it
