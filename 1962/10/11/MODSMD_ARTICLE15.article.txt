## Berlin's Gaiety Combines with Death, Disgrace

Berlin from East Berlin.)
What would you say if your
country was divided into two
parts, making it impossible for
you to see your family though
they may live only a few miles
away?
What would you say, if New
York were a divided city with a
wall of concrete and barbed wire
being built along Fifth Avenue?
How would you feel if your
friends who happen to have their
home on the East Side were
thrown into prison just for lis
tening to a radio station on the
West Side, or being captured be
cause they tried to wave to you
from their side of the wall?
WEST BERLIN today is a place
like any other big city in the
western world: it is as big as
Chicago, as bustling as New York,
as lively and gay as Paris, and is
Germany’s main industrial and
cultural center. Being in Berlin
you would not find life different
from anywhere else in the Free
World; perhaps you would like
the city which was rebuilt in steel
and glass by some of the most
famous architects of our times.
You would like the Berliners, who
are famous for their good hu
mour; you would certainly look
after the girls, who are said to be
extremely pretty and entertain
ing.
And yet this same town is a
place where the most disgraceful
and unbelievable things occur
every day, where people risk
their lives to escape from East
Berlin and the East Zone of Ger
many because they could not en
dure it any longer to he held like
prisoners in the biggest concen
tration camp which history has
even known.
What kind of government is it
that has to prevent its citizens
from running away by using the
most barbaric and cruel means?
HEBE ARE some impressions
from the Berlin scene:
Coming through one of the cor
ridors to West Berlin you will
have your car searched through
to make sure that you did not at
tempt to smuggle a refugee !
across the border. This would be
punished as kidnapping. At the
checkpoint between East and
West Berlin you have to leave
behind all kinds of printed mat
ter which might be apt to influ
ence East Germans against their
government. As a resident of
West Berlin I, myself, am not al
lowed to enter East Berlin,
though anybody from anywhere
else in the world could pass
through the border at least for
one day.
Berlin used to be a place of ex
change and meeting for people
from both parts of the country.
Here East and West competed as
next-door neighbors. The rulers
of the East lost this peaceful
competition since every fourth
resident of the East Zone fled to
the West. Consequently the re
gime caused this dreadful human
misery by building the wall of
shame which is unique in history
in its ugliness and cruelly.
WANDERING along the wall
you will see life going on normal
ly on the one side; on the other
side you will find deadly silence
with the East German guards
ready to shoot at any of their
countrymen, who should try to
escape. You will see children play
ing near the wall on the West
side not realizing what is going
on around them. Some streetcars
stop right at the wall, which has
been built across the street; you
can see the rails, which are no
longer used, continuing in the
deserted street on the other side
of the wall; the windows and
doors of houses which stand di
rectly on the border line have
been enclosed with brickwork,
and guns have been placed on
their roofs.
At some places one can have a
look across the wall, but what
one gets to see is a desert of lorn
houses and open soil, the death
strip in the heart of this torment
ed city. Somehow one feels the
ghostly silence loaded with ten
sion. being near the place where
people died in a desperate at
tempt to escape tyranny and in
justice.
People who have seen the wall
admit that they have learned and
understood more of the present
world-situation by this experi
ence. I, personally, would like to
see fewer picture-taking tourists
in Berlin and at the wall, and
more people who experience our
situation as part of their own.
There certainly is an alarming
Berlin crisis, but this crisis is
only part of the big struggle be
tween East and West, which has
been going on since the end of
World War 11. Berlin happens to
be the place where you feel the
immediate threat of the Commu

nist aggression. People should
realize that we all are in the same
boat and that fighting for Berlin
means not more and not less than
fighting for the principles of free
dom and justice we all believe in
in the whole western world.

punished as kidnapping. At the
checkpoint between East and
West Berlin you have to leave
behind all kinds of printed mat
ter which might be apt to influ
ence East Germans against their
government. As a resident of
West Berlin I, myself, am not al
lowed to enter East Berlin,
though anybody from anywhere
else in the world could pass
through the border at least for
one day.
Berlin used to be a place of ex
change and meeting for people
from both parts of the country.
Here East and West competed as
next-door neighbors. The rulers
of the East lost this peaceful
competition since every fourth
resident of the East Zone fled to
the West. Consequently the re
gime caused this dreadful human
misery by building the wall of
shame which is unique in history
in its ugliness and cruelly.
WANDERING along the wall
you will see life going on normal
ly on the one side; on the other
side you will find deadly silence
with the East German guards
ready to shoot at any of their
countrymen, who should try to
escape. You will see children play
ing near the wall on the West
side not realizing what is going
on around them. Some streetcars
stop right at the wall, which has
been built across the street; you
can see the rails, which are no
longer used, continuing in the
deserted street on the other side
of the wall; the windows and
doors of houses which stand di
rectly on the border line have
been enclosed with brickwork,
and guns have been placed on
their roofs.
At some places one can have a
look across the wall, but what
one gets to see is a desert of lorn
houses and open soil, the death
strip in the heart of this torment
ed city. Somehow one feels the
ghostly silence loaded with ten
sion. being near the place where
people died in a desperate at
tempt to escape tyranny and in
justice.
People who have seen the wall
admit that they have learned and
understood more of the present
world-situation by this experi
ence. I, personally, would like to
see fewer picture-taking tourists
in Berlin and at the wall, and
more people who experience our
situation as part of their own.
There certainly is an alarming
Berlin crisis, but this crisis is
only part of the big struggle be
tween East and West, which has
been going on since the end of
World War 11. Berlin happens to
be the place where you feel the
immediate threat of the Commu

nist aggression. People should
realize that we all are in the same
boat and that fighting for Berlin
means not more and not less than
fighting for the principles of free
dom and justice we all believe in
in the whole western world.

What would you say if your
country was divided into two
parts, making it impossible for
you to see your family though
they may live only a few miles
away?
What would you say, if New
York were a divided city with a
wall of concrete and barbed wire
being built along Fifth Avenue?
How would you feel if your
friends who happen to have their
home on the East Side were
thrown into prison just for lis
tening to a radio station on the
West Side, or being captured be
cause they tried to wave to you
from their side of the wall?
WEST BERLIN today is a place
like any other big city in the
western world: it is as big as
Chicago, as bustling as New York,
as lively and gay as Paris, and is
Germany’s main industrial and
cultural center. Being in Berlin
you would not find life different
from anywhere else in the Free
World; perhaps you would like
the city which was rebuilt in steel
and glass by some of the most
famous architects of our times.
You would like the Berliners, who
are famous for their good hu
mour; you would certainly look
after the girls, who are said to be
extremely pretty and entertain
ing.
And yet this same town is a
place where the most disgraceful
and unbelievable things occur
every day, where people risk
their lives to escape from East
Berlin and the East Zone of Ger
many because they could not en
dure it any longer to he held like
prisoners in the biggest concen
tration camp which history has
even known.
What kind of government is it
that has to prevent its citizens
from running away by using the
most barbaric and cruel means?

only part of the big struggle be
tween East and West, which has
been going on since the end of
World War 11. Berlin happens to
be the place where you feel the
immediate threat of the Commu

nist aggression. People should
realize that we all are in the same
boat and that fighting for Berlin
means not more and not less than
fighting for the principles of free
dom and justice we all believe in
in the whole western world.

What would you say if your
country was divided into two
parts, making it impossible for
you to see your family though
they may live only a few miles
away?
What would you say, if New
York were a divided city with a
wall of concrete and barbed wire
being built along Fifth Avenue?
How would you feel if your
friends who happen to have their
home on the East Side were
thrown into prison just for lis
tening to a radio station on the
West Side, or being captured be
cause they tried to wave to you
from their side of the wall?
WEST BERLIN today is a place
like any other big city in the
western world: it is as big as
Chicago, as bustling as New York,
as lively and gay as Paris, and is
Germany’s main industrial and
cultural center. Being in Berlin
you would not find life different
from anywhere else in the Free
World; perhaps you would like
the city which was rebuilt in steel
and glass by some of the most
famous architects of our times.
You would like the Berliners, who
are famous for their good hu
mour; you would certainly look
after the girls, who are said to be
extremely pretty and entertain
ing.
And yet this same town is a
place where the most disgraceful
and unbelievable things occur
every day, where people risk
their lives to escape from East
Berlin and the East Zone of Ger
many because they could not en
dure it any longer to he held like
prisoners in the biggest concen
tration camp which history has
even known.
What kind of government is it
that has to prevent its citizens
from running away by using the
most barbaric and cruel means?
HEBE ARE some impressions
from the Berlin scene:
Coming through one of the cor
ridors to West Berlin you will
have your car searched through
to make sure that you did not at
tempt to smuggle a refugee !
across the border. This would be
punished as kidnapping. At the
checkpoint between East and
West Berlin you have to leave
behind all kinds of printed mat
ter which might be apt to influ
ence East Germans against their
government. As a resident of
West Berlin I, myself, am not al
lowed to enter East Berlin,
though anybody from anywhere
else in the world could pass
through the border at least for
one day.
Berlin used to be a place of ex
change and meeting for people
from both parts of the country.
Here East and West competed as
next-door neighbors. The rulers
of the East lost this peaceful
competition since every fourth
resident of the East Zone fled to
the West. Consequently the re
gime caused this dreadful human
misery by building the wall of
shame which is unique in history
in its ugliness and cruelly.
WANDERING along the wall
you will see life going on normal
ly on the one side; on the other
side you will find deadly silence
with the East German guards
ready to shoot at any of their
countrymen, who should try to
escape. You will see children play
ing near the wall on the West
side not realizing what is going
on around them. Some streetcars
stop right at the wall, which has
been built across the street; you
can see the rails, which are no
longer used, continuing in the
deserted street on the other side
of the wall; the windows and
doors of houses which stand di
rectly on the border line have
been enclosed with brickwork,
and guns have been placed on
their roofs.
At some places one can have a
look across the wall, but what
one gets to see is a desert of lorn
houses and open soil, the death
strip in the heart of this torment
ed city. Somehow one feels the
ghostly silence loaded with ten
sion. being near the place where
people died in a desperate at
tempt to escape tyranny and in
justice.
People who have seen the wall
admit that they have learned and
understood more of the present
world-situation by this experi
ence. I, personally, would like to
see fewer picture-taking tourists
in Berlin and at the wall, and
more people who experience our
situation as part of their own.
