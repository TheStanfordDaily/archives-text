## Intellectual Paralysis Grips U.S. Foreign Policy 
### RICHARD WEINIG 
Fidel Castro may yet he of serv
ice to the Free World.
His ascendency in Cuba may—
and hopefully will—shock the
American people into careful re
appraisal of the foreign policy
which has guided our nation since
World War 11. It should, in the
words of Lincoln, compel us to
determine “where we are and
whither we are tending.”
I think it, therefore, appropri
ate to spend today and tomorrow
examining the foreign relations
of the United States: analyzing
past shortcomings and offering
suggestions for the future.
THE RECORD during the last
decade in particular has been any
thing but reassuring.
Ten years ago, French Indo
china, though taeseiged, was in
the Western camp. Today, North
Vietnam is under firm commu
nist control; South Vietnam is
tottering; Cambodia pleads neu
tralism; and Laos has been turn
ed over to a “coalition govern
ment,” similar to those which
have led at least twelve nations
to eventual communist enslave
ment. (List available upon re
quest.)
Ten years ago, communist in
fluence in Africa was minimal.
Today, under the leadership of
the Nkrumas and Ben Bellas, the
entire continent seems to be grav
itating toward the Soviet Camp.
TEN YEARS ago, latent anti-
American sentiment in Latin
America had yet to be overtly
manifest on a wide scale. Today,
a Soviet satellite has been estab
lished less than 90 miles from the
Florida coast, Cheddi Jagan has
been elevated to office in British
Guiana, and the continent is in
turmoil.
To what may this decline in
Western influence be attributed?
One answer may be that our lead
ers are either traitors or madmen,
but few responsible men could be
lieve that. Surely, I do not. The
answer lies, rather, in an intellec
tual paralysis, the degenerative
power of which, cripples Ameri
can foreign policy, enervates our
moral equilibrium, and threatens
to reduce the influence of this
nation to that of a “second class”
power.
The difficulty seems to be three
fold: (A) Those who direct the
foreign relations of the United
States mistake the nature of the
communist challenge with which
the Free World is presently con
fronted; IB) They appear to en
vision no national purpose, com
parable in clarity to that which
directs Soviet strategic directives;
and (C) Consequently, the Ameri
can strategic and tactical re
sponse to this challenge has,
heretofore, been inadequate.
UNFORTUNATELY, the cur
rent State Department view of
international communism seems
predicated upon the same mis
taken analysis which guided
F.D.R. in 1943 and 1945: “I have
just a hunch that Stalin wants
nothing but the security of his
own country. Therefore, if I give
him everything he wants and ask
nothing in return, nobless oblige.
He won’t try to annex anything
and will work with me for a
world of peace and democracy.”
Preceding from this premise, it
is supposed that the enslavement
of Eastern Europe following
World War 11. aggression in the
jungles of Southeast Asia, and
Soviet intentions of establishing

a naval hasp in Cuba stem, not
from an intention to extend com
munism throughout the world,
but from the entirely justifiable
desire on the part of Soviet and
Chinese leaders to defend them
selves against possible capitalist
attack.
Therefore, reason Rostow. Ball,
Bowles, and Kennedy, since com
munism is but an intellectual
guise for the actions of Russian
and Chinese nationalists, peace
ful coexistence may yet be
achieved if the United States can
convince the Soviet bloc of the
West’s peaceful intentions; or if
the West can, albeit inoffensively,
prevent itself from being overrun
until the Soviet Union becomes
an affluent society and national
indolence supercedes any desire
for world conquest.
IN A WORD, “if we would stop
regarding the monstrous things
Russia does as monstrous, she
would stop regarding us as mon
strous.”
What other belief could have
prompted President Eisenhower
to say, at Geneva in 1955: “I be
lieve the Soviet Union wants
peace every bit as much as we
do”? And what else could have
induced Robert MacNamara to
delete from generals’ speeches
any mention of the “international
communist conspiracy” with the
hope that such action would “re
duce world tensions”?
But such a belief ignores the
true ends of communism and the
extent to which this ideology in
fluences the actions of Mr.
Khrushchev.
MARX and Lenin agreed that
every action taken should be sub
limated to the goal of building a
world under communism. As Len
in stated in “The April Theses,”
such an end would be unobtain
able until the last vestiges of
capitalism were destroyed and
until “we have ruthlessly and
forcibly crushed all possibility of
a bourgeois counterrevolution.”
Khrushchev affirmed this prin
ciple at the Twentieth Party Con
gress and has repeatedly enunci
ated his desire to “bury” the
West, by economic and ideological
competition wherever possible,
coupled with subversion wherever
desirable, and reenforced with
overt military aggression wher
ever necessary and feasible.
And so he must. As a prominent
liberal authority on Marxism,
Professor Sidney Hook, has indi
cated, had Khrushchev 7 not been
totally dedicated to these princi
ples or had his commitment to
them been dimmed in any way
by personal ambition or devotion
to Russian nationalism, he could
never have risen to power
through the doctrinaire ranks of
the Russian communist party.
The end of Soviet strategy is.
therefore, not self-defense, but
expansion; not coexistence as an
organic state of being, but vic
tory.
AND TO this challenge, the
West must yet respond.

him everything he wants and ask

He won’t try to annex anything

world of peace and democracy.”
Preceding from this premise, it
is supposed that the enslavement
of Eastern Europe following
World War 11. aggression in the
jungles of Southeast Asia, and
Soviet intentions of establishing

a naval hasp in Cuba stem, not
from an intention to extend com
munism throughout the world,
but from the entirely justifiable
desire on the part of Soviet and
Chinese leaders to defend them
selves against possible capitalist
attack.
Therefore, reason Rostow. Ball,
Bowles, and Kennedy, since com
munism is but an intellectual
guise for the actions of Russian
and Chinese nationalists, peace
ful coexistence may yet be
achieved if the United States can
convince the Soviet bloc of the
West’s peaceful intentions; or if
the West can, albeit inoffensively,
prevent itself from being overrun
until the Soviet Union becomes
an affluent society and national
indolence supercedes any desire
for world conquest.
IN A WORD, “if we would stop
regarding the monstrous things
Russia does as monstrous, she
would stop regarding us as mon
strous.”
What other belief could have
prompted President Eisenhower
to say, at Geneva in 1955: “I be
lieve the Soviet Union wants
peace every bit as much as we
do”? And what else could have
induced Robert MacNamara to
delete from generals’ speeches
any mention of the “international
communist conspiracy” with the
hope that such action would “re
duce world tensions”?
But such a belief ignores the
true ends of communism and the
extent to which this ideology in
fluences the actions of Mr.
Khrushchev.
MARX and Lenin agreed that
every action taken should be sub
limated to the goal of building a
world under communism. As Len
in stated in “The April Theses,”
such an end would be unobtain
able until the last vestiges of
capitalism were destroyed and
until “we have ruthlessly and
forcibly crushed all possibility of
a bourgeois counterrevolution.”
Khrushchev affirmed this prin
ciple at the Twentieth Party Con
gress and has repeatedly enunci
ated his desire to “bury” the
West, by economic and ideological
competition wherever possible,
coupled with subversion wherever
desirable, and reenforced with
overt military aggression wher
ever necessary and feasible.
And so he must. As a prominent
liberal authority on Marxism,
Professor Sidney Hook, has indi
cated, had Khrushchev 7 not been
totally dedicated to these princi
ples or had his commitment to
them been dimmed in any way
by personal ambition or devotion
to Russian nationalism, he could
never have risen to power
through the doctrinaire ranks of
the Russian communist party.
The end of Soviet strategy is.
therefore, not self-defense, but
expansion; not coexistence as an
organic state of being, but vic

AND TO this challenge, the
West must yet respond.
Fidel Castro may yet he of serv

His ascendency in Cuba may—
and hopefully will—shock the
American people into careful re
appraisal of the foreign policy
which has guided our nation since
World War 11. It should, in the
words of Lincoln, compel us to
determine “where we are and
whither we are tending.”
I think it, therefore, appropri
ate to spend today and tomorrow
examining the foreign relations
of the United States: analyzing
past shortcomings and offering
suggestions for the future.
THE RECORD during the last
decade in particular has been any
thing but reassuring.
Ten years ago, French Indo
china, though taeseiged, was in
the Western camp. Today, North
Vietnam is under firm commu
nist control; South Vietnam is
tottering; Cambodia pleads neu
tralism; and Laos has been turn
ed over to a “coalition govern
ment,” similar to those which
have led at least twelve nations
to eventual communist enslave
ment. (List available upon re
quest.)
Ten years ago, communist in
fluence in Africa was minimal.
Today, under the leadership of
the Nkrumas and Ben Bellas, the
entire continent seems to be grav
itating toward the Soviet Camp.
TEN YEARS ago, latent anti-
American sentiment in Latin
America had yet to be overtly
manifest on a wide scale. Today,
a Soviet satellite has been estab
lished less than 90 miles from the
Florida coast, Cheddi Jagan has
been elevated to office in British
Guiana, and the continent is in
turmoil.
To what may this decline in
Western influence be attributed?
One answer may be that our lead
ers are either traitors or madmen,
but few responsible men could be
lieve that. Surely, I do not. The
answer lies, rather, in an intellec
tual paralysis, the degenerative
power of which, cripples Ameri
can foreign policy, enervates our
moral equilibrium, and threatens
to reduce the influence of this
nation to that of a “second class”
power.
The difficulty seems to be three
fold: (A) Those who direct the
foreign relations of the United
States mistake the nature of the
communist challenge with which
the Free World is presently con
fronted; IB) They appear to en
vision no national purpose, com
parable in clarity to that which
directs Soviet strategic directives;
and (C) Consequently, the Ameri
can strategic and tactical re

His ascendency in Cuba may—

American people into careful re

which has guided our nation since
World War 11. It should, in the
words of Lincoln, compel us to

whither we are tending.”
I think it, therefore, appropri
ate to spend today and tomorrow
examining the foreign relations
of the United States: analyzing
past shortcomings and offering
suggestions for the future.
THE RECORD during the last
decade in particular has been any
thing but reassuring.
Ten years ago, French Indo
china, though taeseiged, was in
the Western camp. Today, North
Vietnam is under firm commu
nist control; South Vietnam is
tottering; Cambodia pleads neu
tralism; and Laos has been turn
ed over to a “coalition govern
ment,” similar to those which
have led at least twelve nations
to eventual communist enslave
ment. (List available upon re
quest.)
Ten years ago, communist in
fluence in Africa was minimal.
Today, under the leadership of
the Nkrumas and Ben Bellas, the
entire continent seems to be grav
itating toward the Soviet Camp.
TEN YEARS ago, latent anti-
American sentiment in Latin
America had yet to be overtly
manifest on a wide scale. Today,
a Soviet satellite has been estab
lished less than 90 miles from the
Florida coast, Cheddi Jagan has
been elevated to office in British
Guiana, and the continent is in
turmoil.
To what may this decline in
Western influence be attributed?
One answer may be that our lead
ers are either traitors or madmen,
but few responsible men could be
lieve that. Surely, I do not. The
answer lies, rather, in an intellec
tual paralysis, the degenerative
power of which, cripples Ameri
can foreign policy, enervates our
moral equilibrium, and threatens
to reduce the influence of this
nation to that of a “second class”
power.
The difficulty seems to be three
fold: (A) Those who direct the
foreign relations of the United
States mistake the nature of the
communist challenge with which
the Free World is presently con
fronted; IB) They appear to en
vision no national purpose, com
parable in clarity to that which
directs Soviet strategic directives;
and (C) Consequently, the Ameri
can strategic and tactical re
sponse to this challenge has,
heretofore, been inadequate.
UNFORTUNATELY, the cur
rent State Department view of
international communism seems
predicated upon the same mis
taken analysis which guided
F.D.R. in 1943 and 1945: “I have
just a hunch that Stalin wants
nothing but the security of his
own country. Therefore, if I give
him everything he wants and ask
nothing in return, nobless oblige.
He won’t try to annex anything
and will work with me for a
world of peace and democracy.”
Preceding from this premise, it
is supposed that the enslavement
of Eastern Europe following
World War 11. aggression in the
jungles of Southeast Asia, and
Soviet intentions of establishing

a naval hasp in Cuba stem, not
from an intention to extend com
munism throughout the world,
but from the entirely justifiable
desire on the part of Soviet and
Chinese leaders to defend them
selves against possible capitalist
attack.
Therefore, reason Rostow. Ball,
Bowles, and Kennedy, since com
munism is but an intellectual
guise for the actions of Russian
and Chinese nationalists, peace
ful coexistence may yet be
achieved if the United States can
convince the Soviet bloc of the
West’s peaceful intentions; or if
the West can, albeit inoffensively,
prevent itself from being overrun
until the Soviet Union becomes
an affluent society and national
indolence supercedes any desire
for world conquest.
IN A WORD, “if we would stop
regarding the monstrous things
Russia does as monstrous, she
would stop regarding us as mon
strous.”
What other belief could have
prompted President Eisenhower
to say, at Geneva in 1955: “I be
lieve the Soviet Union wants
peace every bit as much as we
do”? And what else could have
induced Robert MacNamara to
delete from generals’ speeches
any mention of the “international
communist conspiracy” with the
hope that such action would “re
duce world tensions”?
But such a belief ignores the
true ends of communism and the
extent to which this ideology in
fluences the actions of Mr.
Khrushchev.
MARX and Lenin agreed that
every action taken should be sub
limated to the goal of building a
world under communism. As Len
in stated in “The April Theses,”
such an end would be unobtain
able until the last vestiges of
capitalism were destroyed and
until “we have ruthlessly and
forcibly crushed all possibility of
a bourgeois counterrevolution.”
Khrushchev affirmed this prin
ciple at the Twentieth Party Con
gress and has repeatedly enunci
ated his desire to “bury” the
West, by economic and ideological
competition wherever possible,
coupled with subversion wherever
desirable, and reenforced with
overt military aggression wher
ever necessary and feasible.
And so he must. As a prominent
liberal authority on Marxism,
Professor Sidney Hook, has indi
cated, had Khrushchev 7 not been
totally dedicated to these princi
ples or had his commitment to
them been dimmed in any way
by personal ambition or devotion
to Russian nationalism, he could
never have risen to power
through the doctrinaire ranks of
the Russian communist party.

F.D.R. in 1943 and 1945: “I have
just a hunch that Stalin wants
nothing but the security of his
own country. Therefore, if I give
him everything he wants and ask
nothing in return, nobless oblige.
He won’t try to annex anything
and will work with me for a
world of peace and democracy.”
Preceding from this premise, it
is supposed that the enslavement
of Eastern Europe following
World War 11. aggression in the
jungles of Southeast Asia, and
Soviet intentions of establishing

a naval hasp in Cuba stem, not
from an intention to extend com
munism throughout the world,
but from the entirely justifiable
desire on the part of Soviet and
Chinese leaders to defend them
selves against possible capitalist
attack.
Therefore, reason Rostow. Ball,
Bowles, and Kennedy, since com
munism is but an intellectual
guise for the actions of Russian
and Chinese nationalists, peace
ful coexistence may yet be
achieved if the United States can
convince the Soviet bloc of the
West’s peaceful intentions; or if
the West can, albeit inoffensively,
prevent itself from being overrun
until the Soviet Union becomes
an affluent society and national
indolence supercedes any desire
for world conquest.
IN A WORD, “if we would stop
regarding the monstrous things
Russia does as monstrous, she
would stop regarding us as mon
strous.”
What other belief could have
prompted President Eisenhower
to say, at Geneva in 1955: “I be
lieve the Soviet Union wants
peace every bit as much as we
do”? And what else could have
induced Robert MacNamara to
delete from generals’ speeches
any mention of the “international
communist conspiracy” with the
hope that such action would “re
duce world tensions”?
But such a belief ignores the
true ends of communism and the
extent to which this ideology in
fluences the actions of Mr.
Khrushchev.
MARX and Lenin agreed that
every action taken should be sub
limated to the goal of building a
world under communism. As Len
in stated in “The April Theses,”
such an end would be unobtain
able until the last vestiges of
capitalism were destroyed and
until “we have ruthlessly and
forcibly crushed all possibility of
a bourgeois counterrevolution.”
Khrushchev affirmed this prin
ciple at the Twentieth Party Con
gress and has repeatedly enunci
ated his desire to “bury” the
West, by economic and ideological
competition wherever possible,
coupled with subversion wherever
desirable, and reenforced with
overt military aggression wher
ever necessary and feasible.
And so he must. As a prominent
liberal authority on Marxism,
Professor Sidney Hook, has indi
cated, had Khrushchev 7 not been
totally dedicated to these princi
ples or had his commitment to
them been dimmed in any way
by personal ambition or devotion
to Russian nationalism, he could
never have risen to power
through the doctrinaire ranks of
the Russian communist party.
The end of Soviet strategy is.
therefore, not self-defense, but
expansion; not coexistence as an
organic state of being, but vic
tory.
AND TO this challenge, the
West must yet respond.
