# Cougar Passes Block Card Comeback
## 
### PETE KING 
Having just recovered from
Terry Baker and Oregon State’s
explosive attack, Stanford’s foot
ball team journeys this weekend
to Spokane to face Hugh Camp
bell and the devastating pass of
fensive of Washington State.
Next to Oregon State, the Cou
gars have probably the most po
tent pass offense on the West
Coast. The combination of Dave
Mathieson to Hugh Campbell has
been largely responsible for
Washington State’s undefeated
record in three games.
CAMPBELL, a 6-1, 180-pound
end, is building a record with the
Cougars that should last a decade.
With seven games to go, he holds
the NCAA record for passes
caught (136) and for yardage
gained (1769), and needs only
six more touchdown passes to
grab the all-time record in that
department.
Already this year he has snag
ged aerials for three TD’s and
165 yards. Although not too fast
afoot, Campbell’s glue-tipped fin
gers and clever fakery down field
make him one of (he toughest col
lege ends to cover.
Mathieson, the other end of
WSU's one-two punch, will prob

ably develop into the best WSU
quarterback since coach Jim
Sutherland took over seven years
ago. He has thrown four touch
down passes this year and last
week almost. single-handedly
picked apart Arizona State’s sec
ndary, completing 13 for 24
passes for 223 yards
AS IF THESE weren’t enough,
Sutherland unveiled sophomore
end Jerry Shaw last week. Shaw
preceded to catch five passes for
over 120 yards and scored the
Cougars’ final two come-from-be
hind touchdowns in a wild, 24-24
tie with Arizona State.
Another sophmore cpiarterback,
Dale Ford, heaved a 35-yarder to
Shaw for the tying score. An out
standing basketball player as

r well. Ford adds considerable
i speed and deception to (he Cou
> gar backfield, and his 6-3, 200-
■ pound frame makes him a for
t midable running threat on roll
' outs and options.
Filling out the speedy State
i backfield are halfbacks Clarence
[Williams, Heim McKee, and Mor
, ris Blankenbaker. All three excel
1 at the Cougar style of wide open
r offense, and Sutherland rates Wil
• | liams as the finest breakaway
» \ back he’s coached.
- i Sutherland is trying out a three
I platoon system this year, like
many another coach. The starters
, are the Big Red unit, hacked up
i by the Red Raiders. So far his ex
■ periment has resulted in 94
? points, two wins, and a tie.

STANFORD assistant roach
Andy Everest scouted WSU last
week and brought back unsettling
reports of Cougar depth and back
field speed. “Those first set of
backs are real multipurpose
kids," reports Andy. “They have
a couple of real sprinters in Wil
liams and McFee and terrific
overall depth. They’re an explo
sive team that can heat you on
the last play of the game.”
However, Sutherland’s boys can
be stopped. Arizona State held
them to 48 yards and six offen
sive plays in the first half, and
allowed Campbell nary a com
plete pass.
STANFORD CAN expect that
the men from the Palouse coun
try will be fighting especially
hard for victory, since this is the
first time in four years that WSU
has had a crack at the Rose Bowl.
Although they play only (he In
dians and Washington, the Cou
gars could be picked if (hey can
win both those games and com
pile a good win-loss record.

Sutherland will meet his first
really strong test in coach Jack
Curtice’s eleven. Although WSU
has looked impressive, Stanford
has played a tougher schedule,
and the game should be a toss-up.
