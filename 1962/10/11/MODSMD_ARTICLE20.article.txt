### Ry MARSHALL COOK 
Can exceptional backfielcl talent make up for a lack of depth
in the line? This question will he answered Saturday at 2:30 when
Stanford’s freshman gridders take on Southern California in (heir
season opener in Stanford Stadium.
The team from the land of eternal smog should provide a

tough lest for the Indian fresh."
SC boasts 14 players from this
year’s Shrine football game,
a contest that features the best:
graduating high school players in
California.
Stanford will rely heavily on
backfield strength in Saturday’s
encounter. Coach Dan Stately
commented on his first two hack
field units: “AD eight of these
boys will help the varsity next
season. There is very little differ
ence between the first two
strings.”
In his starting alignment of
Mike Connely, Ray Hanley, Pete
Middlekauff, and Glenn. Myers,
Stavely maintains that he has his
finest backfield since coming to
the Farm. This is no idle state
ment, considering that this four
some is rated over the quartet ot
Steve Thurlow, Tony DeLellis, Ken
Babajian, and Ken Fraser, who
starred two years ago as fresh
men, Of the four, only Fraser is
not now playing varsity, and he
has been hampered by injuries.
The number two unit includes
John Mason, an end turned quar
terback, Bob Stoecher, who is re
covering from a leg injury, Craig
Ritchey, and Mike Schmidt, a
group who could start on almost
any other frosh squad on the
Coast.
However, prospects are not so
rosy in the line. After an ade
quate first string wearies, Stan
ford appears to be in trouble.
“When the first unit goes out,
we may give up Hoover Tower,”
according to Stavely. Whether or
not part of the sour nature of this
prediction can be attributed to

Ihe usual coaches’ pessimism be
fore the opening game remains
to be seen.
The picture is not entirely
gloomy up front. No outstanding
prospects have distinguished
themselves at end, but the Big
Red is deep in this position. Jim
Anderson, a converted quarter
back, leads the candidates for a
starting berth here. In Bill Ogle
and Dick Arndt, the Cards have
a fine pair of tackles. Gary Petti
grew is also capable in the inter
ior line. Arnie Crogh anchors the
line will at center.
Coach Stavely is hesitant to
make a concrete prediction about
the squad’s chances against pow
erful Troy. Since this is the first
game for both teams this season,
the only test he has to go on is a
scrimmage against the varsity
red shirts. In this practice ses
sion the frosh were able to move
the ball well, especially while the
first unit was in the game, and
the defensive secondary sparkled
on pass defense.

John Mason, an end turned quar
terback, Bob Stoecher, who is re
covering from a leg injury, Craig
Ritchey, and Mike Schmidt, a
group who could start on almost
any other frosh squad on the
Coast.
However, prospects are not so
rosy in the line. After an ade
quate first string wearies, Stan
ford appears to be in trouble.
“When the first unit goes out,
we may give up Hoover Tower,”
according to Stavely. Whether or
not part of the sour nature of this
prediction can be attributed to

Ihe usual coaches’ pessimism be
fore the opening game remains
to be seen.
The picture is not entirely
gloomy up front. No outstanding
prospects have distinguished
themselves at end, but the Big
Red is deep in this position. Jim
Anderson, a converted quarter
back, leads the candidates for a
starting berth here. In Bill Ogle
and Dick Arndt, the Cards have
a fine pair of tackles. Gary Petti
grew is also capable in the inter
ior line. Arnie Crogh anchors the
line will at center.
Coach Stavely is hesitant to
make a concrete prediction about
the squad’s chances against pow
erful Troy. Since this is the first
game for both teams this season,
the only test he has to go on is a
scrimmage against the varsity
red shirts. In this practice ses
sion the frosh were able to move
the ball well, especially while the
first unit was in the game, and
the defensive secondary sparkled
on pass defense.

in the line? This question will he answered Saturday at 2:30 when

strings.”
