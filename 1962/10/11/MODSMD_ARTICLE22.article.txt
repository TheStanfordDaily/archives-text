# Tresh Homer Beats Giants 5-3
## 
### 
Rookie Tom Tresh found out I
what it really feels like to be a
Bronx Bomber yesterday when
his three-run, eighth-inning home
run beat the Giants, 5-3. His
homer followed solid singles by
Tony Kubek and Bobby Richard
son, the only legitimate rally all
flay off S.F. starting pitcher Jack
Sanford. For although the Yan

kees had two previous runs, they
were the result of a hloop double
and a mishandled wild pitch, and
of a lopped. 25-foot single and a
passed ball.
Meanwhile, Ralph Terry, earn
ing his first World Series win,
scattered one walk and eight hits,
one of which was his usual
homer-per-game, to Jose Pagan
in the sixth.
