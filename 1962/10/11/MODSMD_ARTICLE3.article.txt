##

reg week and depraved upper
classmen in the 1962 Big Game
Gaieties, director Phil Ellis an
nounced last night.

and the all-knowing fraternity
man, Ellis continued. David
Quattrone and Marti Reeves will

man couple.
Other leading singing and act
ing male parts in the traditional
Big Game week show will be
played by George Peters Jay
Delloli, Chris Jenkins, John Se
gerstrom, Gary Bogart, Jon
Prince, Jay Weaver, Fred Brandt,
and Bill Sharp.
FEMALE PARTS will be por
trayed by Lynne Chatterton Sue

Sovereign, Charlotte Low, Janet
Benson, Maureen Phillips, Eve
Baker, and Sandy Sturgiu.
The 60 speaking and singing
parts and the 20 dancers in the

the stage manager. Jim Piersall,
a Hollywood professional will do
the choreography.
“The format of (his year’s
Gaieties will be different from
the traditional one of a musical
revue spoofing campus institu

spoofing will still be present, it
will he presented in a framework
of musical comedy which has a
thing unheard of in Gaieties —a
central plot.
“This,” said Ellis, “will make
the whole show hang together
better, and will make it more in
teresting too.”

Freshman Richard Grant and
Sophomore Lizz Kuhn, will play

combatting the evil forces of pre
reg week and depraved upper
classmen in the 1962 Big Game
Gaieties, director Phil Ellis an
nounced last night.
Pat Heldfond and Peter Hayek
will star as the upperclass vamp
and the all-knowing fraternity
man, Ellis continued. David
Quattrone and Marti Reeves will
portray roommates of the fresh
man couple.
Other leading singing and act
ing male parts in the traditional
Big Game week show will be
played by George Peters Jay
Delloli, Chris Jenkins, John Se

Prince, Jay Weaver, Fred Brandt,
and Bill Sharp.
FEMALE PARTS will be por
trayed by Lynne Chatterton Sue
Leich, Barbara Franklin, Sally
Sovereign, Charlotte Low, Janet

The 60 speaking and singing
parts and the 20 dancers in the

for the show. Susan Goodwillie

script.
Technical director will be Dave
Banker, and Dave Hardy will be
the stage manager. Jim Piersall,
a Hollywood professional will do
the choreography.
“The format of (his year’s
Gaieties will be different from
the traditional one of a musical
revue spoofing campus institu
tions,” said Ellis. Although the
spoofing will still be present, it
will he presented in a framework
of musical comedy which has a
thing unheard of in Gaieties —a
central plot.
“This,” said Ellis, “will make
the whole show hang together
better, and will make it more in
teresting too.”
The show will be presented at
8:30 the evenings of Nov. 20, 21,
and 22, and at 9:30 on Nov. 23,
after the Big Game bonfire.
