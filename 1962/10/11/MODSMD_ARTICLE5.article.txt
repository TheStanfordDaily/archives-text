# Winchell, Integrationist Among Four Campus Speakers Today
## 
### 
Four speakers are scheduled to address students on campus
today—three will speak at the same time. They range from Waller
Winchell, narrator for TV’s “Untouchables,” to Stanley Puryear.
NAACP member fighting for housing rights in Sunnyvale.
Columnist Winchell will initiate the Political Union’s “American
Scene Personality,” series today at 4 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
Poly Union President Jan Deßakcsy says his speech will be as rich
and varied as his columns—topics ranging from Broadway to current
politics.
A question and answer session will follow Winchell’s presenta
tion and after that students will have a chance to further converse
with him at a Stern Hall reception.
“Since 1922, Winchell’s often provocative and outspoken columns
have stirred the American scene,” Miss Deßakcsy said. Few subjects
of importance have escaped the scrutiny of his pen, as will be indi
cated by the breadth of his speech today, she added. One of his
topics wall be the “Untouchables.” Winchell worked closely with
Eliot Ness’ gang-busters during the 1920’5.
Winchell is ideal as the first speaker of our new series, added
Miss Deßakcsy. Wo are attempting to relate the vast dynamics—
cultural, political, and personal that make up the “American Scene.”
WILL THE WORLD again see the likes of Leonardo da Vinci?
Professor Robert H. McKim, Department of Mechanical Engineering,
explores the question at 4:15 p.m. in Tresidder Memorial Union.
McKim begins a series of lectures on da Vinci, drawing on his work
in the Mechanical Engineering Department’s Industrial Design pro
gram, which combines art and engineering.
Illustrating his talk with colored slides, McKim will describe the
differences between the Renaissance genius and a new breed of
da Vincis, which he predicts are soon to appear.
STANLEY PURYEAR, Lockheed mathematician, will speak to
members of the Civil Rights Group at 4:15 in the Women’s Club
house. The public is invited to hear Puryear discuss his recent efforts
to rent an apartment in a housing project in Sunnyvale.
Eleven members of the Stanford Civil Rights Group joined the
NAACP last weekend in picketing the building owned by Joel Heath
where Puryear, a Negro, was refused rental. At present nearly half
of the facility is vacant.
A suit has been filed against Heath, based on the 1959 Unruh
Civil Rights Act, which states that discrimination in all business es
tablishments on account of race or color is illegal.
WILLIAM-JAN VAN BLOBBE, vice president of the European
Economic Community Commission, will speak tonight at 7:30 in
room 320, Geology Corner.
Van Slobbe, who received his degree in economics from the
University of Tilbourg and did graduate work in Rotterdam, has
served in the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs as an economist
dealing with nuclear energy. In his present capacity as vice president
of the EEC Commission, ho is closely concerned with Common
Market agricultural policy.
