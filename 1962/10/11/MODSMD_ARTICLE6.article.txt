# Cal Squabbles Over N.S.A. May Drop Out
## 
### 
The Golden Bear across the bay
may withdraw from the contro
versial National Student Associ
ation ( NSA ) which Stanford stu
dents voted to join in a highly
contested referendum last spring.
Daily Californian editor Elliot
Steinberg stated yesterday that
Cal should drop its membership
in NSA if the organization does
not become more representative
of the national student opinion.
THE NSA takes stands on cur
rent national and international
issues at its annual summer con
ventions. These stands claim to
represent only the opinions of
students attending the conference,
but they are often thought to be
the official position of the mem
ber schools, opponents of the or
ganization point out.
Four ASUC loaders including
Steinberg—have formed a com
mittee to study possible changes
in NSA. They are agreed that if
delegates are to represent Cal
student opinion on off campus
issues, they should be elected on
the basis of their views on those
issues.
They demand two changes in
the procedure of selecting dele
gates. First, the issues to be dis
cussed must be announced six
months before the national con
gress to allow time for discussion.
Second, arrangements must bo
made for a special student body
election.
Steinberg said that “people are
legislating with no mandate . . .
many are appointed and have
never held an elective office . . .
many of those who are elected
are elected solely on local issues.”
A MOTION was made in the
1961 NSA convention to have dele
gates be elected. It received a
majority vote, but not the two
thirds necessary for a constitu
tional change. This summer the
motion did not receive enough
votes to get out of the committee
and onto the convention floor, the
Cal Daily reported.
The group of four intends to
propose for passage by the ASUC
Senate and student body a reso
lution that Cal should drop out
of the NSA if its conference is
not made more representative of
student opinion.
The committee should report its
proposals in about three weeks,
Steinberg said.
Stanford belonged to the NSA
before 1956 but voted to with
draw that year. Since then there
have been several campaigns to
i re-enter the Association.

LAST MAY a group of students
tried once again. For several
weeks the arguments raged be
tween those who favored rejoin
ing and those opposed. Students
approved re-entrance by a 799-614
vote in a special referendum.
