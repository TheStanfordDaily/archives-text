# Deke Says Rush Discussion Controlled by IFC Chairman
## 
### 
A representative of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity charged
last night that discussion at Monday’s Inter-Fraternity Council
meeting was manipulated prior to the extremely close vote to
recommend changes in rushing procedure.
“I was very disappointed, and so was the president of my

fraternity at the way discussion*-
was controlled by the Chair,”
said Russ McKinney, Deke repre
sentative to IFC.
After a particularly emotional |
speech in favor of the proposal, i
Chairman Mike Hammer express
ed his agreement with the speak- ,
er and carefully controlled the
discussion from then on, allowing
only one person to speak against
the report while approximately
10 supporters were recognized.
McKinney charged.
“He knew I was opposed. Al
though I had my' hand up the
whole time discussion was con
ducted, I was not called on,” he
said.

rush begins.
“I think that something better
could be worked out. I don’t think
the rush committee did as much
work as they are trying to con
vince everyone they did," McKin
ney concluded.
Ric Swenson, the Delta Upsilon
representative, was less emphatic.
Although he felt that the new
plan would allot too much time
for rush, he pointed out that
there is a provision in the report
for a revote in IFC the fifth or
sixth week of winter quarter.
“I don’t think it’s going to hurt
us,” he said, “because if it’s not
going well for us, it’s probably
not going to be going well for
everyone else, and it will be voted
out.”
WILBUR SPONSORS contacted
by The Daily seemed to favor the
proposal in general although they
expressed some reservations.
“We need some method to give
rushing a more realistic basis,”
said Jack Tierney, Rinconada
sponsor. “The new policy would
give the freshman more oppor
tunity to get to know the frater
nity members and to make a
more serious decision about
which fraternity ho wants to live
in for the next three years.
“I would propose removing the
formalized Spring Rush and in
stead having more open houses
and a large dinner. I also would
like to see the program of frater
nities and freshmen submitting
lists of their first and second
choices installed at Stanford,”
concluded Tierney.
It puts it on a more casual ba
sis and gives freshmen a longer
time to investigate the fraterni
ties,” said Frank Dubofsky, Rin
conada sponsor. “But it could be
very expensive to fraternities if
they over-emphasize it.”

THE PROPOSAL, which rec
ommended the reduction of the
non-con tact-wit h-freshmen regu
lation during parts of winter
quarter, was finally approved by
a 20 to 18 vote.
McKinney was one of the most
emphatic objectors of the plan.
He said that it would be diffi
cult to keep the house physically
and mentally in shape for rush
ing for the extended length of
time, and he pointed out that an
especially heavy burden would
fall on sophomore pledges who
must do the house work.
He claimed the new plan would
increase expenses, since it in
volves one more open house in
winter quarter and since the
pledge dinner would be moved
from Monday to Sunday when no
dinners are usually served in fra
ternity houses. “The Sunday par
ty which is being dropped is usu
ally an inexpensive party any
way,” McKinney said.
McKINNEY’S final objection
was that the open contact plan
would lend to encourage “dirty
rushing,” and that the houses
would be able to pick the majori
ty of their pledges before formal
