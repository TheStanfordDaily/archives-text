### United Press International 
BERLIN—East German Communist police yesterday captured
three refugees trying to swim a border river to West Berlin. In
another venture two la-year-old boys escaped across the border.
West Berlin police said the three refugees caught by the East
Germans were trying to swim the Spree River near the ruins of the
old Reichstag Building. A patrol boat raced after them at full
throttle and the Communists hauled them aboard. There were no
shots. The refugees were arrested and taken to an undisclosed loca
tion. They face prison terms for attempted flight.
The two boys were not detected as they crawled through several
strands of barbed wire on West Berlin’s border with East Germany.
They chose an isolated spot on the city’s northern limits and fled
in darkness.
