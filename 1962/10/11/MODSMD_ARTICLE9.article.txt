# Stanford Scholar Invited to Malaya
## 
### SHEILA RICKETTS 
Karl Brandt, director of Stanford’s Food
Research Institute, is joining two other
scholars on a Ford Foundation Project to
study agricultural diversification in the
Malay States and to make recommendations
for agricultural policy for the next 10 to 15
years. Brandt will study ways to reduce the
economic dependence on rubber in the Malay
Slates.
The Ford Foundation pointed out in its
invitation to Brandt to join the project that
action in the vital agricultural sector of the
Malay economy can produce important ef
fects on complex political and social prob
lems.
RESEARCH projects such as that in
which Brandt is currently engaged are only
one of the many activities carried on by the
Food Research Institute.
Over the last five to ten years the Insti
tute has become increasingly interested in
some of the food, agricultural and nutritional
aspects of economic development, and in that
connection a decision was made in 1954 to
undertake a long term program of study re
lating in particular to food agriculture and
economic development in Tropical Africa.
Work in this field is supported by two Car
negie Corporation grants and one Ford
Foundation grant.
“We have had some member of our staff
in Africa for part of each year since 1951
with the exception of one year,” said Wil
liam Jones, the Institute economist in charge
of African studies.

THE INSTITUTE studies food and agri
culture from two aspects, according to Jones.
First it is necessary to study the capacity
for Africa to provide a bigger and better
food supply to meet the increasing demands
that come with economic progress.
Jones also pointed out several conclusions
that have been reached in the study of Afri
can agriculture. Although there are limited
food shortages and dietary deficiencies, Af
rica is not a land of desperatelood shortages.
“Although African farming was often
criticized as wasteful, destructive, inefficient,
and primitive,’’ he continued, “we’re well
convinced now that given the circumstances
that prevailed in tropical Africa 50 years
ago, African methods were none of these. It
was a good system of preserving soil fer
tility and getting results.”
In the last year the Institute has also
taken on a program of study relating in par
ticular to agricultural and economic devel
opment in Latin America. This work has
been aided by a $50,000 grant from the Bel
gian IBERSOM Foundation and a $54,000
grant from the Fritz Thyssen Foundation
of Habsburgerring, Germany. Research as
sistants from both Belgium and Germany
have come here to work on the project.
This grant from a European foundation
to an American University has been termed
a significant innovation since the flow of
foundation funds in support of research
work has to this time been almost exclusive
ly from the United States to Europe.
The work of the Food Research Institute
ges back to 1921 when it w'as established
jointly by Carnegie Corporation of Now'

York and the Stanford Trustees to do "re
search in the production, distribution, and
consumption of food.”
WORLD WAR I and its consequences
had emphasized the need for knowledge by
which economic problems might be better
handled. To help meet these problems the
Institute was established to carry on funda
mental research on economic questions con
cerning food on an international scale.
It was felt that the possibility of doing
useful productive work would be greater if
the Institute concentrated on a single com
modity. wheat, instead of spreading its re
sources over the entire field.
The major part of research for 40 years
has been a study of the international grain
trades, primarily the food grains, and this
study still occupies the attention of a con
siderable number of the staff members.
During World War 11, however, staff
members became involved in other concerns.
One staff member was in the Hawaiian
Islands on a Guggenheim fellowship, and he
was drafted to work out a plan for supply
ing the islands, since various food problems
immediately became obvious after the Japa
nese attack on Pearl Harbor.
Later came the establishment of the Afri
can studies division, and finally Latin Amer
ican studies were established this year.
Although the Food Research Institute is
primarily interested in research, it offers
Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy de
grees. There is no bachelor’s degree offered
in the department, but undergraduates may
enroll in certain courses taught by the In
stitute faculty.
