# Columnist Winchell Claims 'Suppression'
## 
### JOHN HARPER 
At a Poli Union Dinner last night, Columnist Walter Winched
accused flic Kennedy Administration of trying to suppress him,
citing a New York Mirror proof-copy of one of his columns in
which the statement appeared, "Intimates of the President have
persuaded Democratic solons of both houses to contact their

homotown publishers and editors I
to ‘drop or stop Winchell.’ ”
“Yes. the Kennedy Administra
tion is displeased with me,’’ Win
ched said, but you see how the j
New York Mirror is rising in cir
culation. The people want to hear
criticism of the Administration.”
WINCHELL THEN proceeded
to jab at a random assortment of
Kennedy actions which have dis
pleased him.
Producing a copy of President
Kennedy's record of voting as a
US Senator, Winchell called criti
cal attention to the number of ab
stentions from voting in it.
He also intimated that some of
Kennedy’s best-known quotes
may have been “borrowed” from
other sources.
Winchell's remarks were not
confined to the President alone.
He noted that one of Arthur
Schlesinger’s close associates, a
New York Post columnist, was at
one time an “Official of the
Young Communist League.”
Skipping erratically from topic
to topic, Winchell at one point
claimed that the Hearst Press
and “even independent papers
like the Arizona Globe.” are de
leting his political articles or
dropping him altogether.
HE REMINISCED on his at
tacks of Republicans during the
FDR administration, stating that
"these things weren’t happening"
to him then.
Winchell also claimed that Dem
ocratic legislators have supplied
him with information on the Cu
ban situation and other contro
versial international information
which has been suppressed by the
administration.
Drawing examples from several
years past, Winchell cited the
“dirty” aspect of politics, closing
with the remark that, he will “be
able to run columns in New York,
Los Angeles, and one or two
other cities.” and expressing the
hope that this will keep his “vi
tal” criticism of the Kennedy Ad
ministration alive.
