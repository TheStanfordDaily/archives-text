# Humanist-Scientist Needed In Society Today Says McKim
## 
### 
Society is in need of well-round
ed specialists such as Leonardo
da Vinci, a man who was both a
great scientist and great human
itist, Prof. Robert H. McKim of
the Mechanical Engineering de
partment said yesterday in the
first of a series of informal lec
tures on da Vinci at Tresidder
Memorial Union.
“M an cannot survive unless
science and the humanities are
integrated,” warned McKim. He
pointed out that even da Vinci had
trouble correlating his art work
with the invention of war machin
ery.

McKim stated that the integra
tion of art and science is a prob
lem that exists at Stanford. One
solution, he believes, is the now
design program at Stanford that
combines art and engineering. “I
think that the artist has bridged
half of the chasm, now it is the
engineers’ turn,” he added.
The well-grounded scientist, who
is versed only in technology, must
be replaced by a well-rounded
man capable of a “feeling for
creation” and a knowledge of hu
man values. “As an optomist, I
believe we can train more men
of this type,” McKim concluded.
