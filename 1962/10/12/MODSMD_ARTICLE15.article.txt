## Victory Not Containment Should Guide U.S. Policy 
### RICHARD WEINIG 
I spoke yesterday of a moral and intellectual paralysis which
has enervated American foreign policy. The nature of the malady
is, perhaps, best revealed in a statement by the distinguished
scholar, Ronald Hilton, in the September 29 issue of “The Nation”:
“(As) long as we maintain aggressive bases in places like For-

mosa and Turkey, it is morally*
impossible for us to object on
ethical grounds to what the Rus
sians do in Cuba.”
I intend no personal offense to
Mr. Hilton but believe that the
statement implies two concepts
which are inimical to the security
of the United States and, by that
token, to the freedom of mankind.
THU FIRST is that to which I
have previously objected: the mis
leading belief that Russian and
Chinese action in Cuba, Eastern
Europe, or Southeast Asia is for
defense and not in pursuance of
any strategic plan to extend com
munist domination throughout
the world; the failure to perceive
the inherent truth enunciated by
one long acquainted with commu
nist theory and practice, General
Mark Clark: “Having seen the
Red Army and Russian diplomacy
in action, my own belief is that
there is nothing the Soviets would
not do to achieve world domina
tion.”

The second, and derivative, con
cept indicated is an imminent
lack of clarity as to what the ob
jectives of American foreign
policy should be.

A statement that the United
States could have no ethical ob
jection to the further expansion
of a political power and philoso
phy that has enslaved and exploit
ed one billion people against their
will because we maintain military
bases abroad is tantamount to a
statement that because the police
department of Chicago, Illinois,
had, and upon occasion used, ma
chine guns, they could not “ob
ject on ethical grounds” to simi
lar practices by one Legs Dia
mond.
PRECISELY’, what have been
and what should be the objectives
of American foreign policy?
Heretofore. American strategy
has been directed toward achieve
ment of two rather illusive ends:
(a) Maintenance of the status
quo by preventing further com
munist expansion, i.e., contain
ment; and (b) “reduction of in
ternational tensions” by constant
ly reassuring the Soviet bloc of
Western peaceful intentions by
means of disarmament talks, nu
clear test bans, and the like.
Unfortunately, the ends contra
dict one another and are, hence,
self-defeating.
IN ORDER to be effective, the
policy of containment requires
maintenance of such powerful
and mobile armed forces that the
consequences of any attack upon
the non-communist world would
be sufficiently to deter
any thought of Soviet o*r Chinese
aggression, whether overt or co
vert. But maintenance of forces
of sufficient strength to achieve
this end all but precludes the
possibility of reducing "interna
tional tensions,” via disarma
ment, etc.
However, if primary emphasis
is to be given to the "reduction
of international tensions,” one
can hardly maintain the military
might necessary to pursue a poli
cy of containment.
Moreover, this combined strat
egy has further, grave short
comings.
FIRST, it does nothing to aid
the millions now trapped behind
the Russian and Chinese counter
ports of the Berlin Wall.
Second, mere defense of the
status quo allows the commu
nists, at the time and place of
their choice, to draw the West
into small wars of attrition in
which the only Western alterna
tives would be surrender of a
limited area of the free world,
conventional warfare against a
foe which possesses a vast nu
merical superiority in manpower,
or nuclear retaliation.

As Louis Halle stated in his
perceptive book. “Choice For Sur
vival:’’ “In absence of some in
ternal disruption, the Soviet Un
ion will be able to commit a series
of successive aggressions, each of
which is, in itself, so limited or
ambiguous that we will not feel
justified in retaliating with the
nuclear holcaust in which all
would be consumed , . .
“OUR ONLY way of frustrat
ing them at that stage would be
the way in which Sampson frus
trated the Philistines when he
pulled the temple down on their
heads and his. The choice will be
between surrender and the end of
the world.”
Clearly, another alternative is
needed.
The time has come for the
United States to recognize the re
sponsibilities which circumstance
has imposed upon her and clarify
her objectives.
The United States is no “just
any nation.” She is the most pow
erful nation in the world—eco
nomically and militarily. As such,
hers is the responsibility of lead
ing the Free World’s struggle to
maintain and extend freedom.

I SUGGEST that the objectives
in pursuance thereof should be
founded upon three premises
enunciated by Senator Goldwater:
(1) The ultimate objective of
American foreign policy must bo
“to protect the security and in
tegrity of Americans and thereby,
help establish a world in which
there is the largest possible mea
sure of freedom and justice and
peace and material prosperity.”
(2t ‘‘Attainment of the largest
measure of freedom, justice,
peace, and prosperity is impos
sible without the prior defeat of
world communism.” insofar as
communism, in theory and prac
tice, has proved itself to be “anti
thetical to these conditions” and
the largest single threat to their
achievement. It has the power to
deny these conditions to the mil
lions behind the Iron and Bamboo
Curtains as well as the military
strength to jeopardize their
achievement throughout the rest
of the world.

(3) Therefore, “victory over
communism must be the domi
nant, proximate goal of Ameri
can foreign policy.”
TO THIS END, the United
States must be ever ready to de
fend any non-communist nation
against aggression; extend tech
nical assistance to any nation
which reveres the liberty and dig
nity of the individual; and aid any
people who are willing to free
themselves from communism.

This is not to say that freedom,
in the sense of self-determination,
is not a commendable objective.
But if the deposition of a Batista
may lead to the more complete
tyranny of a Castro, even the
most despicable dictators must
be tolerated until it is reasonably
certain that their subjects will not
be transferred from the proverb
ial frying pan to the equally pro
verbial fire.

This is not to say that peace
is not a commendable objective.
But if one must choose between
peaceful cession of West Berlin
to the Soviet Union or war. the
choice is clear.

THIS IS but to say that while
each f the forenamed objectives
is worthy, conflicts arising must
always be “resolved in favor of
achieving the indispensible con
dition for a tolerable world—the
absence of Soviet-Communist
power.”
In the words of L. Brent Bo
zell: “We must adopt an offensive
strategy that is every bit as seri
ous about liberating communist
territory as the communists are
about enslaving ours.”
