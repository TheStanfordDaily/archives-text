## Congress's Unconcern Reflects Public Attitude 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Congress which is just about to adjourn has, it seems to me,
reflected as in a mirror what the people as a whole want, what they
do not want, and above all what they do not care about. If the
function of Congress is to reflect opinion rather than to lead it and

make it and shape it, then there*
is nothing much to complain
about. If, however, we measure
the mood and behavior of Con
gress against the new era in
world affairs which is opening
up, there is much to worry about.
I do not think we need to worry
about the refusal of Congress to
accept the big Kennedy welfare
bills. Many legislators who favor
some or all of them in principle
complain that there were too

| many of them
I and that some of
I the bills, at least,
I were rather slop-
Ipi 1 y prepared
I and ineffectively
I presented. More-
I over, there was
[little popular
[ pressure behind
[the welfare
[ measures. The

country can get along without I
them for the immediate present.
THEBE ARE, I believe, two!
serious criticisms to be made of
the work of this Congress. The
first is that it has interfered un
duly and contrary to the spirit of
the constitution with the Presi
dent’s conduct of foreign affairs.
The worst case of usurpation is
the proviso about Yugoslavia and
Poland in the trade bills. This un
considered clause will, if it is not
repealed next winter, wreck our
foreign policy in Eastern Europe.
Foreign policy cannot be con
ducted wisely and effectively by
apeasing inflamed and ignorant
minorities. That is what Congress
did in this proviso.
It is true that in the world to
day foreign policy is deeply en
tangled with foreign trade and
foreign aid and that, therefore,
the House of Representatives as
well as the Senate is drawn into
the making of foreign policy. But
it is highly undesirable that Con
gress, and particularly the House,
which is so big that it is not a
deliberative body, should use its
fiscal power to usurp the Presi
dent’s initiative in foreign affairs.
AN EVEN more serious fault
arises from the fact that most of
the senior members of l*hh
Houses are out of touch with the
world as it is today, and with the
new generation that is shaping it.
In spite of the trade bill, which is
on the whole a very good bill, the
influence of Congress has been
generally against the effort to
adapt this country to the contem
porary world.
This is not only the world in
which we and the Soviet Union
are the great rivals. It is also the
world in which Western v Europe,
pursuing policies which Sen.
Byrd regards as sin and damna
tion, is forging ahead rapidly
while we continue to drift.
The deepest criticism one can
make of this Congress is that
with few exceptions it has shown
no sign of being aware of the
comparative sluggishness of the
United States’ economy which is
threatening our position in the
world and is darkening the pros
pectsof the future. The fact that
Congress is so unconcerned about
so grave an American problem is
a serious matter.
AS YET the unconcern of Con
gress reflects faithfully enough,
I am afraid, the unconcern of our
people.
The President has not been
able to break through it, and the
loudest voices that the people
hear most often are telling them
not to face the fact that the Unit
ed States and the world in the
middle of the twentieth century
are not what they were at the be
ginning of the twentieth century.

The deepest criticism one can
make of this Congress is that
with few exceptions it has shown
no sign of being aware of the
comparative sluggishness of the
United States’ economy which is
threatening our position in the

Congress is so unconcerned about
so grave an American problem is
a serious matter.

I am afraid, the unconcern of our
people.

Congress which is just about to adjourn has, it seems to me,
reflected as in a mirror what the people as a whole want, what they
do not want, and above all what they do not care about. If the
function of Congress is to reflect opinion rather than to lead it and

make it and shape it, then there*
is nothing much to complain
about. If, however, we measure
the mood and behavior of Con
gress against the new era in
world affairs which is opening
up, there is much to worry about.
I do not think we need to worry
about the refusal of Congress to
accept the big Kennedy welfare
bills. Many legislators who favor
some or all of them in principle
complain that there were too

| many of them
I and that some of
I the bills, at least,
I were rather slop-
Ipi 1 y prepared
I and ineffectively
I presented. More-
I over, there was
[little popular
[ pressure behind
[the welfare
[ measures. The

country can get along without I
them for the immediate present.
THEBE ARE, I believe, two!
serious criticisms to be made of
the work of this Congress. The
first is that it has interfered un
duly and contrary to the spirit of
the constitution with the Presi
dent’s conduct of foreign affairs.
The worst case of usurpation is
the proviso about Yugoslavia and
Poland in the trade bills. This un
considered clause will, if it is not
repealed next winter, wreck our
foreign policy in Eastern Europe.
Foreign policy cannot be con
ducted wisely and effectively by
apeasing inflamed and ignorant
minorities. That is what Congress
did in this proviso.
It is true that in the world to
day foreign policy is deeply en
tangled with foreign trade and
foreign aid and that, therefore,
the House of Representatives as
well as the Senate is drawn into
the making of foreign policy. But
it is highly undesirable that Con
gress, and particularly the House,
which is so big that it is not a
deliberative body, should use its
fiscal power to usurp the Presi
dent’s initiative in foreign affairs.
AN EVEN more serious fault
arises from the fact that most of
the senior members of l*hh
Houses are out of touch with the
world as it is today, and with the
new generation that is shaping it.
In spite of the trade bill, which is
on the whole a very good bill, the
influence of Congress has been
generally against the effort to
adapt this country to the contem
porary world.
This is not only the world in
which we and the Soviet Union
are the great rivals. It is also the
world in which Western v Europe,
pursuing policies which Sen.
Byrd regards as sin and damna
tion, is forging ahead rapidly
while we continue to drift.
