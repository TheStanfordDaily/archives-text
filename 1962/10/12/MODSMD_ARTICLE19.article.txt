## Rushing Proposal Calls for Change In Attitudes 
### PAGE EDWARDS 
The goal of the IFC rushing
proposal is not to enhance dirty
rush and increase expenses and
pressure on the fraternities but
to minimize all three.
If the policy when applied does
not fulfill that function, then it
must be abolished. Since the pro
posal is not working policy, only
conjecture as to its success or
failure can be offered.
The rushing proposal will de
crease dirty rushing by partially
eliminating the need. On-campus
contact offers both the fraternity
members and the freshmen legal
means of establishing friendships
on an individual basis.
With a friendship established,
there should be less need for a
pocket pledge.
The argument that increased
contact with freshmen will in
tensify the temptation for fresh
men to attend off campus parties
is valid. Enforcement and respect
for the policy (each mutually ex
clusive) are the only available
means of control.
A more tangible effect the pro
posal has is that of decreasing
expenses. Not only is one party
during spring quarter cancelled,
but the need for an expensive for
mal rush is reduced.
If, during the winter quarter
contact, a fraternity can acquaint
itself with freshmen of the de
sired caliber, why should they
present a rushing extravaganza?
The formal rush facade, ideally,
under the policy, will be useless.
From the fraternity viewpoint,
the usual intoxication and levity
can exist even during rushing.
The pressure on fraternities
and freshmen will be decreased if
neither attempts to form and re
tain a facade for nine or ten
weeks.
If pressure is considered to be
work load per man, there will be
an increase. Four open houses
strung-out during winter quarter
certainly require more effort than
three in a row. But the effect of
the open houses, under the new
policy, should increase. Many
freshmen of fraternity caliber do
not participate in rush solely be
cause of the sporadic intensity of
first Greek Week than formal
rush. With steady acquaintances
being established from the third
week of winter quarter, more
freshmen will participate in rush.
The new rush proposal calls for
a change in rushing attitude, a
change from superficial social
contact to individual friendship.
The freshmen will have the op
portunity to realize fraternity
life before they pledge.
The success of the policy, as
proposed, is requisite on trust be
tween the houses and respect for
the policy. For, though the policy
provides more freedom for the
fraternity, it also allows for more
distrust and disunity between the
houses.

contact to individual friendship.
The freshmen will have the op
portunity to realize fraternity
life before they pledge.
The success of the policy, as
proposed, is requisite on trust be
tween the houses and respect for
the policy. For, though the policy
provides more freedom for the
fraternity, it also allows for more
distrust and disunity between the
houses.
The goal of the IFC rushing
proposal is not to enhance dirty
rush and increase expenses and
pressure on the fraternities but
to minimize all three.
If the policy when applied does
not fulfill that function, then it
must be abolished. Since the pro
posal is not working policy, only
conjecture as to its success or
failure can be offered.
The rushing proposal will de
crease dirty rushing by partially
eliminating the need. On-campus
contact offers both the fraternity
members and the freshmen legal
means of establishing friendships
on an individual basis.
With a friendship established,
there should be less need for a
pocket pledge.
The argument that increased
contact with freshmen will in
tensify the temptation for fresh
men to attend off campus parties
is valid. Enforcement and respect
for the policy (each mutually ex
clusive) are the only available
means of control.
A more tangible effect the pro
posal has is that of decreasing
expenses. Not only is one party
during spring quarter cancelled,
but the need for an expensive for
mal rush is reduced.
If, during the winter quarter
contact, a fraternity can acquaint
itself with freshmen of the de
sired caliber, why should they
present a rushing extravaganza?
The formal rush facade, ideally,
under the policy, will be useless.
From the fraternity viewpoint,
the usual intoxication and levity
can exist even during rushing.
The pressure on fraternities
and freshmen will be decreased if
neither attempts to form and re
tain a facade for nine or ten
weeks.
If pressure is considered to be
work load per man, there will be
an increase. Four open houses
strung-out during winter quarter
certainly require more effort than
three in a row. But the effect of
the open houses, under the new
policy, should increase. Many
freshmen of fraternity caliber do
not participate in rush solely be
cause of the sporadic intensity of
first Greek Week than formal
rush. With steady acquaintances
being established from the third
week of winter quarter, more
freshmen will participate in rush.
The new rush proposal calls for
a change in rushing attitude, a
change from superficial social
contact to individual friendship.
