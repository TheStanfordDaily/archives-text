Keillor, The Daily:
As a member of the IFC, and
more basically an individual in
lerested in objective news cover
age, I would like to express my
disappointment in the way The
Daily handled the Russ McKin
ney article concerning the recent
IFC discussions on rushing.
As can, and 1 am sure will, l>e
clearly shown, McKinney’s views
are both isolated and without sub
stantial justification. Those pres
ent at Monday’s meeting can veri
fy that before any vote was taken
on the proposal or any of its in
dividual aspects (including pro
posed amendments), the Chair
left the floor open for final com
ments. No vote was taken until
all comments had been heard.
Had Mr. McKinney a dissenting
voice which, as he alleges, could
not be otherwise heard, this
would have been the time to
make it known.
The amount of space given the
McKinney article i larger head
line and more lines than the re
port of IFC’s approval of the pro
posal on October 10th) would
seem to imply the concurrence of
The Daily with his opinions.
It is my impression that The
Daily either does not yet fully
understand the details of Monday
night’s meeting or it is attempt
ing to misrepresent the integrity
of the IFC. In either case, The
Daily has been clearly remiss in
its responsibility to the student
body.
