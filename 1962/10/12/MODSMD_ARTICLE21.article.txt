question I regret that Mr. McKin
ney felt that the chair was dis
criminatory. I attempted to the
best of my ability to call on those
persons who had not had a chance
to express their viewpoint.
On two occasions the question
was called and objection kept the
debate open. On the third call for
the question no objection was
raised. I therefore can assume
that Mr. McKinney either chose
not to debate the issue further, or
else is unfamiliar with parliamen
tary procedure by which IFC
meetings are conducted.
Ed Eschbach
IFC President
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to answer a speci
fic charge made in The Daily re
garding my chairing the IFC
meeting of last Monday and
would also like to avail myself of
the opportunity to comment on
the issue of open contact.
First of all, I would like to
apologize for Mr. McKinney as
the error in referring to me as
chairman can be attributed to in
accurate reporting by The Daily.
However, I would like to com
ment on the substance of Mr. Mc-
Kinney’s comments on two fronts
—the first being the fairness of
| the debate and second the validity
I of his arguments regarding the
{ actual proposal.
In dealing with the first point,
I felt that substantial time was
i given for debate on both sides of
I the issue. I feel Mr. McKinney
j has left the implication that the
1 debate was quite short whereas
■ in fact, the “emotional speech” he
refers to occurred approximately
one hour after debate had begun
[ on the subject. The entire debate
lasted approximately an hour and
a half.
The charge that ten supporters
j were privileged to speak as op
posed to one opponent after the
“emotional speech” I think is un
founded, although I must admit I
jam speaking only from my im
| pression of the meeting. Perhaps
Mr. McKinney has statistics to
back his point.
At any rate, I think the chair
j was more than fair in allowing all
sides to air their views. However,
again. I must admit that I too
viewed the chair’s action with
askance on two occasions when
he did voice an opinion. But. this
| is not to say he controlled the
| discussion, for in fact he did not.
Regarding Mr. McKinney’s first
| point the undue effort needed to
| keep the house mentally and
physically in shape under the pro
posed program I would suggest
I Mr. McKinney is implying doubt
| that his house would be able to
i get a desired pledge class if the
rushees were allowed to view that
house as they ordinarialy live.
As to the second point, regard
ing extra expense of Sunday din
ners and the fact that meals are
not generally served on time on
j Sundays, I would suggest that
! the cost to the individual of open
i ing his house’s kitchen for the
1 express purpose of pledge din
| ners would be in line with the
j cost to the individual for Sunday
dinner outside the house. How
ever', I must qualify myself to the
extent that this is merely a sug
gestion as I am not a house man
\ ager and cannot profess to know
| all the ramifications of such a
j suggestion.
As to Mi'. McKinney’s point re
garding an increase in dirty rush
ing under the proposed system, I
would point out that the proposal
could remove the stimulus for
off-campus contact and in its
stead, present to those concerned

a more realistic look at the Stan
ford fraternity system. I person
ally do not feel there is a need
to “dirty rush” and to do so per
haps exhibits a lack of house con
fidence.
Mike Hammer
IFC Kush Chairman
Editor, The Daily:
As Sophomores who have chos
en to live in Stern Hall this year,
we were interested in the IFC’s
decision to change Freshman con
tact rules so that there will now
be partial open-contact in the
Winter Quarter. This seems to be
a definite step in the right direc
tion, helping to alleviate the ex
treme pressure of Rush Week
and giving Freshmen ample time
to investigate every possible liv
ing system on a rational rather
than a purely emotional basis.
We hope, however, that it will do
more than just assist the fresh
man “to make a more serious de
cision about which fraternity he
wants to live in for the next three
years,” as Sponsor Jack Tierney
has asserted. It should also pro
vide him the opportunity to pon
der the much more serious de
cision of whether he wants to join
a fraternity at all.

Editor, The Daily:
The audience applauded long
and loud after Heiner Gautschy
spoke on Red China Tuesday
night. He had given a humorous
and interesting account of his
two-month tour of Red China.
The audience was left with amus
ing images of tragicomic taxi
drivers, obnoxious translators,
and fly-swatting campaigns, the
latter being the only indication he
gave of the serious fight against
disease in China. The fight
against literacy was also ignored.
In fact, one of his anecdotes left
one with the impression that the
people who ride buses in Peking
can’t read.
I do not object to his telling
personal anecdotes. That is the
job of a journalist. But when a
journalist steps over this line into
generalizations, or. perhaps more
appropriate, when the audience
interprets his anecdotes as gen
eralizations, I question the value
of his appearance before the in
tellectual community, whose duty
it is to maintain rigorous objec
tivity.
His speech illustrated other in
adequacies of journalists in mak
ing generalizations. Since he
could not speak Chinese, he had
to use an interpreter. That all the
people toed the party line he at

tributed only to the presence of
the interpreter, often a govern
ment informer. This was a dan
gerous assumption, which any
person in the audience was as
equally qualified to make.
Another inadequacy: his lack
of an analytical approach. Most
informed students already knew
the facts he related. For instance,
wo all know of the "human costs”
of Chinese industrialization to
which he often alluded. But he
was unable to present the alter
natives. His lack of knowledge
concerning the history of China
prevented him from comparing
the "human Costs” under the
Communists with the “human
costs” under Chiang. Nor could
he say what the long run "human
costs” would be if such a monu
mental effort to modernize were
to be further postponed. He did
not entertain the possibility that
the Communists might be the
first to vigorously attack the
unique problems of China, and
that Chiang has merely succeeded
in pulling the ideological wool
over our eyes by emphasizing the
inevitable “human costs.”
As mentioned earlier, journal
ists have a real function to per
form. But both the journalist and
his audience should realize its
limits.
