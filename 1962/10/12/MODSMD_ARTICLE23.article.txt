# 'Water Polo Team Best In U.S.'
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Behind the pageantry and ex
citement of collegiate football, es-1
pecially winning football, several I
so-called minor, fall sports dwell I
relatively unnoticed. One of these
is water polo, which is especially
handicapped because it is played
in very few places outside Cali
fornia.
Nevertheless, water polo offers
many worthy attractions of its
own along with attractions simi
larly found in some of the more
publicized, major sports. Water
polo features the grace of strong,
fast swimming; the close specta
tor proximity found at a basket
ball game but with the overall
view seen at a football game; the
endurance of distance running;
and team scoring patterns and
weaves of basketball and football.
All of these are combined in a
28 minute contest with scoring
more frequent than in baseball or
football. And for those who enjoy
contact sports primarily for the
vicarious aggression derived, wa
ter polo offers the satisfaction of
seeing a fifty-mile-an-hour shot
smack into the bare arm or chest
of the goalie.
AT STANFORD, water polo of
fers still another attraction this
year a consistent winner and
“probably the best college team
in the country,” according to
Coach Jim Gaughran, The team
started right out to substantiate
Gaughran’s expectations by win
ning its first two league games
last weekend, 12-9 over San Jose
State and 8-4 over Foothill Col
lege. Together with the 18-6 win
over an alumni squad two weeks
ago, the team now stands 3-0.
Stanford competes simultane
ously in two leagues, the Northern
California Water Polo League,
composed of Bay Area teams, and
the AAWU (not including Wash
ington or Washington State). Cal
ifornia is the only other team that
competes in both leagues. These
are virtually the only collegiate
leagues in the country.
The potentially outstanding
player on this year’s team is soph
omore Marty Hull, better known
for his feats in the butterfly,
where he holds two Stanford rec
ords and finished fifth in the
AAU national meet last year. He
had a great year on the freshman
water polo team In 1961, averag
ing 8:6 goals a game and has
been the varsity’s leading scorer
so far this year.

Hull is the center forward; he
will be flanked at the other two
front line spots by experienced
and accomplished men. Pete Petti
grew, an All-AAWU player and a
lefthander will play right forward.
Bill Lorton, second team AAWU
and a righthanded shooter, is the
left forward.
Together these three men com
pose a very fast and accurate
shooting front line, ideally suited
for the fast-break, high scoring
offense Gaughran is installing.
AT GOALIE, the position which
approaches the pitcher in base
ball in individual importance, is
sophomore George Stransky. The
goalie must not only block shots
but must direct the defense and

the offensive breaks. Stransky’s
fine play last year was largely
responsible for the frosh’s 12-0
record.
The back (defensive) standout
is bullish Don Buehler, (6-3, 199»,
(he third starting sophomore. A
cousin of 270 pound tackle Chuck
Buehler, Don’s brawn will be ef
fective in nudging opposing for
wards away from Stanford’s goal.
All five of the players mentioned
so far played for the San Fran
cisco Olympic Club in AAU out
door leagues this summer. This
experience is especially valuable

in a sport in which many of the
participants have played only
since entering college.
ALSO in the backcourt are
three lettermen, Mike Conn, Grant
Giske, and Jim Youd, and one
sophomore, Dave Gildea, who are
vying equally for the left and
right back positions.
So if you want to begin your
sports-spectating weekends a little
earlier than the usually 1:30 foot
ball kickoff time, come to Enoina
Pool, Fridays at 3:30 and/or Sat
urdays at 11 a.m.; on the home
game weekends, that is.
