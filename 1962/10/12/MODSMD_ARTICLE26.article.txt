# Injured Cards Face Tough Test In Fast WSU Offense
## 
### 
By PETE KING
Forty determined football play
ers leave the Farm this morning
for Spokane, where they will
tangle with the undefeated Cou
gars of Washington Stale tomor
row afternoon.
' Their mission is threefold get
back on the winning track after

last Saturday’s discouraging loss,
win their first Big Six game of
the year, and exact retribution
for the 30-0 lacing they suffered
at the hands of the Cougars here
last season.
WITH THE likes of end Hugh
Campbell, quarterback Dave
Mathieson. fullback George Reed,
and a host of fast backs wailing
for them, the task is a formidable
one.
However, Stanford coach Jack
Curtice believes that the team is
ready to cope with WSU’s wide-

open offense. Defense, a Card
strongpoint until last week, has
been stressed in practice this
week, and the results have been
encouraging.
Passing has also been exten
sively worked on, and yesterday
quarterbacks Steve Thurlow and
Clark W'eaver collectively con-

nected on 40 of 51 passes—the
best that the Indians’ aerial at
tack has looked all year on the
practice field.
UNFORTUNATELY, injuries
and ailments have swept a swath
through the starting lineup this
week. Ken Babajian, hard-driving
fullback, will miss the game be
cause of a sprained foot, and Gary
Craig, halfback and Stanford’s
best punter, is also out with a
slight concussion.
The Cards received a further
blow Wednesday when it was
learned that C. B. Simons, 230-
pound center, had twisted his
knee against Oregon State so
badly that he will be unable to
play tomorrow. In addition, first
string ends Frank Patitucci and
Steve Pursell have missed prac
tice, Frank with the flu and
Steve with a sore elbow.
However, trainer Conny Jarvis
has assured Curtice that both
players will be able to play.
ON THE PLUS side, the In
dians will welcome the return of
Dick Ragsdale, out since early in
the Tulane game with a sprained
ankle. Ragsdale will play defen
sive safety in place of Craig.
Good news, also, is the return of
J. D. Lodato, sophomore halfback.
Lodato, recovered from a bruised
rib against Michigan State, will
regain the left halfback position.
With Stanford’s attack brunted
by injuries. Curtice has said that
victory will take as great an of

fort as that against MSU. Stan
ford fans hope that I tie Cards arc
capable of two such efforts ir
three weeks.

HUGH CAMPBELL, WSU's All-

yards against Stanford tomorrow
to set a new national record for
total yards from pass receptions.

Forty determined football play
ers leave the Farm this morning
for Spokane, where they will
tangle with the undefeated Cou
gars of Washington Stale tomor
row afternoon.
' Their mission is threefold get
back on the winning track after

last Saturday’s discouraging loss,
win their first Big Six game of
the year, and exact retribution
for the 30-0 lacing they suffered
at the hands of the Cougars here
last season.
WITH THE likes of end Hugh
Campbell, quarterback Dave
Mathieson. fullback George Reed,
and a host of fast backs wailing
for them, the task is a formidable
one.
However, Stanford coach Jack
Curtice believes that the team is
ready to cope with WSU’s wide-

open offense. Defense, a Card
strongpoint until last week, has
been stressed in practice this
week, and the results have been
encouraging.
Passing has also been exten
sively worked on, and yesterday
quarterbacks Steve Thurlow and
Clark W'eaver collectively con-

nected on 40 of 51 passes—the
best that the Indians’ aerial at
tack has looked all year on the
practice field.
UNFORTUNATELY, injuries
and ailments have swept a swath
through the starting lineup this
week. Ken Babajian, hard-driving
fullback, will miss the game be
cause of a sprained foot, and Gary
Craig, halfback and Stanford’s
best punter, is also out with a
slight concussion.
The Cards received a further
blow Wednesday when it was
learned that C. B. Simons, 230-
pound center, had twisted his
knee against Oregon State so
badly that he will be unable to
play tomorrow. In addition, first
string ends Frank Patitucci and
Steve Pursell have missed prac
tice, Frank with the flu and
Steve with a sore elbow.
However, trainer Conny Jarvis
has assured Curtice that both
players will be able to play.

dians will welcome the return of
Dick Ragsdale, out since early in
