# Winched Sparks Poll Union Talks
## 
### 
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Mae West,
and J. Edgar Hoover were among
the many “great Americans” bit
ten by the sharp humor of colum
nist Walter Winchell yesterday
in the first of a series of Political
Union talks labeled “The Ameri
can Scene Personalities.”
Using his familiar mixture of
humor and sarcasm. Winchell
fired off in rapid succession an
amazing collection of “personal
experiences” covering 40 years
work in the newspaper business.
Leaning forward intensely, as
if the more to impress his words
on the audience of about 800 in
Memorial Auditorium, Winchell
advised prospective journalists to
"get experience.”
He told how he got his first job
as a New York reporter, because
his experience counted for more
than the degree of another man.
"And,” Winchell said, “the guy
they turned down was F. Scott
Fitzgerald.”
His anecdotes ranged from the
time he was punched by Mae
West (“never be nice to an actor,”
he saidl to his recent adventure
in capturing the leader of a gang
of stock-market burglars with the
FBI.
When he had cause to appeal
to the FBI for protection after
this escapade, Winchell said, “G
-man Hoover told me to go to the
nearest cop . . . that’s what the
police are for.”
Asked what political party he
supported, Winchell said he
worked with the administrations
of Roosevelt, Truman, and Eisen
hower. "I am a free American,"
ho said, “and vote for whom I
please.”
Winchell climaxed his after
noon at Stanford by presenting
Poli Union President Jan De-
Bakcsy with a $lO,OOO grant for
Dr. Robert Alvin of the Stanford
Medical Center from the Damon
Runyon aCncer Fund, of which
he is the treasurer.
