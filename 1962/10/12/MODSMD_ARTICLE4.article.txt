# Common Market Is World's Hope
## 
### 
The further development of the
European Common Market is the
best interest of Europe, the Unit
ed States, and indeed the world.
This was the main point of Wil
liam-Jan Van Slobbe, vice presi
dent of the European Economic
Commission, in his lIR-sponsored
speech last night.
He noted the progress that the
Common Market has made in
terms of industrial production,
internal and external trade. He
stressed, however, the need for
further economic union and more
political cooperation and integra
tion. In addition to complex and
difficult internal relations, the
Common Market, sc haid, must
give serious consideration to the
application for either member
ship or association of almost all
the countries this side of the Iron
Curtain, and relations with Africa
and the United States.

Ideally, the period of transition
in which the countries of the Eu
ropean Market are now involved
will be completed within the next
fifteen or twenty years, said Van
Slobbe.
