# Da Vinci Boosts Culture

### PAUL RICCI 
Tresidder Union’s first largo
scale exposition, "Leonardo da
Vinci—Fusion of Art and Sci
ence,” is a giant stop in the Un
ion’s effort to make a substantial
cultural contribution to life at
Stanford.
The choice of da Vinci as the
subject of Trcsidder’s first expo
sition is consistent with the Un
ion's aim of providing something
of interest to all members of the
Stanford community.
LEONARDO DA VINC I was
that rare type of individual a
universal man. one who not only
applied his talents in many dif
ferent directions but reached a
degree of genius in most of what
he attempted.
Thus a comprehensive collec
tion of materials connected with
his accomplishments appeals to
people interested in architecture,
painting, philosophy, engineering,
aerodynamics, city planning, or
drawing in short, a majority of
the subjects taught at a great uni
versity.
The whole point of the exposi-

tion is to convey to the viewer a

lion is to convey to the viewer a
strong impression of the magni
ficent versatility and talent of the
man, and the question is w'hether
or not it has succeeded in attain
ing this.
THE ANSWER must be that it
has indeed succeeded, for even a
cursory examination of the dis
plays which are set up all over
Tresidder’s second floor reveals
that Leonardo de Vinci was with
out a doubt one of the most un
usually gifted men who over
lived.
This would be true even if one
merely considered the prodigious
range of his talents.
In order to collect a really com
prehensive exposition of da Vin
ci’s work, the two Stanford stu
dents who were in charge of or
ganizing the exhibit, Reno Gor
man and Jill Clumeck. were put
to the task of cordinating materi
als from three major collections
of da Vinciana.
These are the Belt Collection,
the UNESCO Collection of prints,
and LBM’s collection of working
models of da Vinci’s devices.

This would be true even if one
merely considered the prodigious
range of his talents.
In order to collect a really com
prehensive exposition of da Vin
ci’s work, the two Stanford stu
dents who were in charge of or
ganizing the exhibit, Reno Gor
man and Jill Clumeck. were put
to the task of cordinating materi
als from three major collections
of da Vinciana.
These are the Belt Collection,
the UNESCO Collection of prints,
and LBM’s collection of working
models of da Vinci’s devices.
Tresidder Union’s first largo
scale exposition, "Leonardo da
Vinci—Fusion of Art and Sci
ence,” is a giant stop in the Un
ion’s effort to make a substantial
cultural contribution to life at
Stanford.
The choice of da Vinci as the
subject of Trcsidder’s first expo
sition is consistent with the Un
ion's aim of providing something
of interest to all members of the
Stanford community.
LEONARDO DA VINC I was
that rare type of individual a
universal man. one who not only
applied his talents in many dif
ferent directions but reached a
degree of genius in most of what
he attempted.
Thus a comprehensive collec
tion of materials connected with
his accomplishments appeals to
people interested in architecture,
painting, philosophy, engineering,
aerodynamics, city planning, or
drawing in short, a majority of
the subjects taught at a great uni
versity.
The whole point of the exposi-

tion is to convey to the viewer a

lion is to convey to the viewer a
strong impression of the magni
ficent versatility and talent of the
man, and the question is w'hether
or not it has succeeded in attain
ing this.
THE ANSWER must be that it
has indeed succeeded, for even a
cursory examination of the dis
plays which are set up all over
Tresidder’s second floor reveals
that Leonardo de Vinci was with
out a doubt one of the most un
usually gifted men who over
lived.
This would be true even if one
merely considered the prodigious
range of his talents.
