# Conduct At Ore. Game Discussed By LASSU
## 
### 
The student Legislature, in a muddled two-hour hassle last
night at Bowman Alumni House, considered two motoins concern
ing conduct at football games.

The first measure was directed toward the rooting section.
Complaints from students, faculty, administration and alumni con-

cerning 1) obscene yells at foot
ball games, and 2) the throwing
of cards at the Oregon State
game last weekend, were dis
cussed.

IT WAS GENERALLY agreed
that something should bo done to
improve the conditions responsi
ble for the poor performance of
the rooting section yell leaders,
and card stunt leader at the Ore
gon State game.
One group of legislature mem
bers asserted that desegregating
the r'ooting section would con
tribute to improvement of the
situation.
Another group asserted that
such action would only antag
onize their constituents.
A MOTION was passed, by a
12-7 vote, encouraging desegre
gation of the rooting section.
The value of card stunts was
discussed. It was pointed out that
Stanford had originated the use
of card stunts in college football,
but that enthusiasm for card
stunts on campuses throughout
the nation has since waned, with
a few exceptions.
Some members felt that, in
view of the negative enthusiasm
shown by some rooters at half
time while their team was behind,
the card section should be abol
ished.
Other members asserted that
many students wished to continue
card stunts, and that abolition of
same would be a gross step.
A motion to abolish card stunts
was defeated, 10-7.
Consideration of the improve
ment of Rally Com was postponed
until the next meeting.
Article 13 of the by-laws, con
cerning class government, will
also be considered next week.
