Open letter to new
frosh, transfers, visit
ing profs, any and all
men newly resident to
our fair campus. Got
the word on S/C? No,
not So. Calif. S/C
stands for SUPER/
CHARGEâ€” the most
accommodating credit
plan fostered by
ROOS ATKINS, your
friendly clothiers, that
permits you to buy
everything you need,
now, when you need
it, and take a long,
long time to pay on
modest monthly in
stallments. Take
S/C and see.
