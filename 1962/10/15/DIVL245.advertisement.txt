men
... Some notes about you v about
us v and the advertising business
About you. If you are the man we seek: You have an
abiding curiosity about people and the world around you.
You’re alert and responsive to new ideas, new ways of doing
things. You like to take on new problems ... you see them as
opportunities.
You dig deep into the why of things. And the best answers
you can come up with today lire never good enough for you
tomorrow.
You’re an individualist. Yet you thrive on team spirit.
You have conviction about freedom of choice, consistent
with the rights of others.
You’re the kind of man who could be successful in business
for himself, but you see the greater challenge implicit in the
major enterprises of today’s world.
About lIS. The J. Walter Thompson Company was formed
98 years ago. It has for many years been the largest advertis
ing firm; its stock is owned by more than five hundred active
staff members.
We help over 500 companies in the United States and
abroad sell thousands of products and services to hundreds of
millions of people. Last year alone, we were responsible for the
advertising investment of over one-third of a billion dollars.
There are 6,700 people working with Thompson around the
world. Our backgrounds range far and wide. And so do our
assignments: writing, art, market research, media buying, TV
and radio, styling, marketing and merchandising, music and
the theatre, engineering, accounting anti statistical analysis,
international business, and the social sciences are only part
of the list.
