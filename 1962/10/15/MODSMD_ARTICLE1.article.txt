# NSA Merits Questioned By Univ. of Washington
## 
### 
The University of Washington has joined the ranks of schools
questioning the merits of the National Student Association.
According to a recent column in the Washington Daily, Tom
Warren, the school’s first vice president, has proposed that the Uni
versity drop out of NSA and instead send its student body leaders

to meet with representatives of
other West Coast Schools, to hash
over common problems.
WARREN and six other stu
dent body leaders who were dele
gates to the NSA summer con
gress told the newspaper they
found committee work at the
congress valuable “personally” in
understanding national issues.
But. the report continued, “Few
of the delegates could state ex
plicitly how the trip east helped
the more than 19,000 students left
at homo.” who, as members of the
student body paid the “consider
able foe” for each delegate’s trip.
Warren attacked the method of
selecting delegates, who are ap
pointed at Washington rather
than elected.
ADVOCATING withdrawal
from NSA, he said; “The Univer
sity would do better to concen
trate its efforts at home.”
Another delegate, the school’s
junior class president said: “The
Congress was very, very liberal
on all issues. The orientation of
NSA seemed to be beyond the
campus."
However, the University’s stu
dent body president said that
membership in NSA was neces
sary for Washington. He told the
newspaper: “The question, ‘ls
NSA representative of the stu
dents?’ is irrelevant.”
Another delegate agreed with
Warren that membership in NSA
was not worth the cost involved.
NSA MEMBERSHIP has been
a highly controversial issue in
student government at Washing
ton annually for years, the news
paper said.
Last week the Cal Daily, Ber

keley, questioned the merits of
NSA. Stanford rejoined the or
ganization last spring after stu
dent approval in a referendum.

ADVOCATING withdrawal
from NSA, he said; “The Univer

NSA seemed to be beyond the

NSA representative of the stu

Another delegate agreed with
Warren that membership in NSA
was not worth the cost involved.
NSA MEMBERSHIP has been
a highly controversial issue in
student government at Washing
