# Irishman New I-Club President
## 
### 
Elected International Club Pres
ident in a special election on Fri
day was Michael O’Flynn of Ire
land, a graduate student in elec
trical engineering. His opponent,
Walia Singh of India, was de
feated 175 to 148, after an inten
sive campaign. Acting President
Christina Van Syckle will now re
turn to her post as Vice-President,
to which she was elected last
spring.
O’Flynn aims to give the pres
ent I-Club program format “a
shot in the arm.” He has already
begun to appoint a committee of
six to eight representatives from
the major world geographical
areas, who will act as ‘‘public re
lations men,” responsible for en
couraging active participation by
students from their sections in
I-Club and student affairs.
He has also begun a drive to
encourage greater American
membership in the I-Club, especi
ally of engineers and other scien
tists—and girls. More panel dis
cussions on pertinent issues of
national and international interest
are planned.
Stating his personal philosophy,
O’Flynn said, “I have a total ir
reverence for anything connected
with society except that which
makes the roads safer, the beer
stronger, the food cheaper, and
the men and women warmer in
the winter and happier in the
summer.”
