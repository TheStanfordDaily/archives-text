# Desegregation

### 
Legislature in a decisive 12-5 vote Thursday recommended the
desegregation of the rooting section at football games. Their de
cision should go a long way toward ending the present artificial
segregation of Stanford women from the male rooting section. The
reason for Legislature’s decision is related to the conduct of
students at games. The theory is that men behave themselves with
more propriety when women are present.
As important as Legislature’s resolution is, it cannot he effec
tive if a vocal minority of students refuse to cooperate and instead
make it unbearable for women to enter the section. Were a men’s
living group to arrange an exchange with a women’s living group
for next Saturday’s game against Washington, the desegregation
might proceed with relative ease.
