# RECORD REVIEW
## 'Carter Family Recording May Indicate Folk Revival' 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
Harmony Records, a subsidiary
of Columbia, which has provided
so many impoverished students
with classical music at two dol
lars an album, has recently re
leased what seem to be their first
two folk albums “The Famous
Carter Family” (HL 7280) and
“Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs
With the Foggy Mountain Boys”
(HL 7250).
Nowadays most people have
heard of the Carter Family; but
for our parents they were a sta
ple in a diet of popular music,
heard continually on radio and
Jukebox. The Carters were per
haps the best bud of a prolific
outcropping of hillbilly groups;
from 1927 to 1939 they recorded
over 250 songs. This appeal of
hillbilly songs can perhaps be
best explained by Alan Lomax’s
remarks in “Folk Songs of North
America” (Doubleday, 1960):
They were the last Americans to
learn the sorrows of divorce and
unstable love affairs, and to dis
cover the loneliness of a society
in which the village, the clan and
the family were in dissolution.
Between 1920 and 1950 thousands
of melancholy hillbilly songs told
again and again the same sad
stories of broken homes and un
happy love affairs.”
THK CARTER group was
formed with the marriage of A.
P. (Alfred Pleasant) and Sara
Carter. It became a trio when
A.P.’s brother married Sara’s
cousin Maybelle. At the height of
the Carter Family’s career, they
were Joined by “Mother May
belle’s three daughters, Helen,
June, and Anita. The Carters
throughout their career were a
prism through which the best,
the most enduring of hillbilly and
country gospel music was re
fracted onto the screen of popular
song.
An inexpensive edition of the
Carter family has long been lack
ing. The present album has al
ready become the bible of many
of the professional string bands
in the Chicago area. Songs like
“Wildwood Flower,” “Gospel
Ship,” and “Little Darling Pal of
Mine”—-the mainstay of contem
porary folk singers—deserve to
be heard from their original
source.
The songs on this Harmony re
print were recorded in May of
1935. They are strained by all the
hollow sound and scratchiness
that crept into the early 78 rpm’s.
And all the songs are soloed by
A. P. Carter, lending them a flat
tening regularity sometimes bor
dering on monotony. But withal
the recording is a valuable one.
Enjoying the Carters is like eat
ing bitter almonds; they must be
lived with awhile to be liked.
“LESTER Flatt and Earl
Scruggs with the Foggy Mountain
Boys” on the other hand, is a
little easier to absorb. Their de
manding bluegrass technique can
often be as absorbing as any so
nata. Bluegrass music has emerg
ed with jazz as America’s only
original contribution to musical
form; and a certain affinity be
tween bluegrass arrangement and
progressive jazz can be sensed in
“Foggy Mountain Special,” the
high point of the first side of the
present album. On the other hand,
the Foggy Mountain Boys’ fid
dles, Which make this jazz-like
arrangement possible, tend to
smother out the acrid virtuosity
of Scruggs and Flatt; the cele
brated twang of Scrugg’s banjo is
only allowed free reign in “Earl
Breaks Down.”
Most of the Foggy Mountain
Boys’ vocal work is not on a level
with the instrumental accompani
ment. But the two best songs,
“Jimmy Brown the Newsboy” and
“Don’t Let Your Deal Go Down”
—both Carter Family imports—
are excellent fusions of “singin’

and pickin’.”
The two now Harmony record
ings do not represent the best
work of the Carters or of
Scruggs-Flatt. But hopefully they
are only the first of a series of
folk revivals.
