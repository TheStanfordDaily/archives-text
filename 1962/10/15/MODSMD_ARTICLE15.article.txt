# BOOK REVIEW
## Bunzel: 'Small Business Insecure as well as Inferior' 
### 
By ILENE H. STRELITZ
Stanfortl-in-France Correspondent
“The American Small Business
man," by John H. Bunzel (assist
ant Professor of Political Sci
ence) : Alfred Knopf, $4.35.
John Bunzel’s first words in
“The American Small Business
man” are in the form of a chal
lenge directed to him by an AFL
CIO official: the labor leader had
difficulty accepting the thesis
that the small businessman “can
not be counted upon to support
liberal groupings such as organiz
ed labor.”
From paragraph one, page one,
the battle is a pitched one. It is a
battle over the question “who is
the small businessman, what is
he, that all politicians adore him.”
IS THE small businessman the
very cornerstone—-even a true
part—of today’s economic system,
or is he outmoded economically
and reactionary politically?
Should he be “shored up” or left
to the mercy of a big business
market ?
With the final word of page
477. the reader can predict, on the
basis of Professor Bunzel’s al
most overwhelmingly thorough
research, the outcome of the fray.
The sympathetic reader—liberal
or conservative—may, however,
have trouble determining for
what he should be rooting.
Facts come fast and furiously
to verify Bunzel’s statement “eco
nomically small business is inse
cure as well as inferior.” To what
the small businessman attributes
his predicament and the solutions
he proposes to it are surprising,
revealing, and somewhat con
demning.
PROFESSOR Bunzel finds the
supposed motto “free competi
tion” to be far from the actual
desires of the small businessman.
He is doing his utmost, by what
ever means possible, to eliminate
his main competition: big busi
ness. As he sees our contempo
rary economy as a "threat to his
private world” and is frustrated
in attempts to halt its progress,
he comes to view life as a conspir
acy. His conspiratorial outlook is
projected beyond the business
sphere to all facets of life, mak
ing him a likely candidate for the
radical right from McCarthy to
Welch.
The Stanford political scien
tist’s treatment of the small busi
ness associations is so personable
that the reader is shocked as, in
the latter portion of the book, he
is confronted with a barrage of
their policy statements that can
be judged as little more than ri
diculous.
ONE SMALL business associ
ation declared itself “unalterably
opposed” to the Point Four Pro
gram as this “fantastic program
. . . is a Marxian planned Utopia
to equalize the standards of liv
ing . . .” Eighty percent of the
membership of another organiza
tion voted for complete elimina
tion of foreign aid. Schools are
seen as the subversive defamers
of all that Is American, big busi
ness is the unAmerican and im

moral product of leftists, and
unions as the enslaver of both
owner and worker.
The views of the small business
organizations stand in relief from
those of big business, which tend
to realize the need of modifica
tion of the capitalist system to
yield its just aid to social wel
fare. The “buccaneering view” of
the small businessman leaves him
“more intent on making a fast
dollar.”
Like the epic heroes of old, the
former bastion of the American
Way has fallen prey to his own
fatal flaw: he has become the
true believer of the agrarian
myth he perpetrates. He clutches
the banner of rugged individual
ism as he demands government
action against the big competitor
he cannot out-produce or out-sell.
PROFESSOR Bunzel is a social

scientist, not a novelist, and he
relies upon the fruits of his im
pressive research to act as the
catalyst of (he reader’s emotions
and judgments.
While the leader is torn be
tween a desire to end aid to an in
efficient and doomed small busi
ness, and his empathy for the
small entrepreneur, the author
passively finds a place for the ef
ficient of the small businesses
and notes their limits in his con
cluding words: “Small business
men claim to be the cornerstone
of American democracy, but it is
doubtful if they can be counted
upon to furnish imaginative and
constructive leadership. There is
little reason to assume, on the
basis of their current perform
ance, that they possess the quali
ties necessary to guide a great
democracy in a time of crisis.’

very cornerstone—-even a true
part—of today’s economic system,

and reactionary politically?
Should he be “shored up” or left

what he should be rooting.
Facts come fast and furiously
to verify Bunzel’s statement “eco
nomically small business is inse
cure as well as inferior.” To what
the small businessman attributes
his predicament and the solutions
he proposes to it are surprising,
revealing, and somewhat con
demning.
PROFESSOR Bunzel finds the
supposed motto “free competi
tion” to be far from the actual
desires of the small businessman.
He is doing his utmost, by what
ever means possible, to eliminate
his main competition: big busi
ness. As he sees our contempo
rary economy as a "threat to his
private world” and is frustrated
in attempts to halt its progress,
he comes to view life as a conspir
acy. His conspiratorial outlook is
projected beyond the business
sphere to all facets of life, mak
ing him a likely candidate for the
radical right from McCarthy to
Welch.
The Stanford political scien
tist’s treatment of the small busi
ness associations is so personable
that the reader is shocked as, in
the latter portion of the book, he
is confronted with a barrage of
their policy statements that can
be judged as little more than ri
diculous.
ONE SMALL business associ
ation declared itself “unalterably
opposed” to the Point Four Pro
gram as this “fantastic program
. . . is a Marxian planned Utopia
to equalize the standards of liv
ing . . .” Eighty percent of the
membership of another organiza
tion voted for complete elimina
tion of foreign aid. Schools are
seen as the subversive defamers
of all that Is American, big busi
ness is the unAmerican and im

moral product of leftists, and
unions as the enslaver of both
owner and worker.
The views of the small business
organizations stand in relief from
those of big business, which tend
to realize the need of modifica
tion of the capitalist system to
yield its just aid to social wel
fare. The “buccaneering view” of
the small businessman leaves him
“more intent on making a fast
dollar.”
Like the epic heroes of old, the
former bastion of the American
Way has fallen prey to his own
fatal flaw: he has become the
true believer of the agrarian
myth he perpetrates. He clutches
the banner of rugged individual
ism as he demands government
action against the big competitor
he cannot out-produce or out-sell.
PROFESSOR Bunzel is a social

scientist, not a novelist, and he
relies upon the fruits of his im
pressive research to act as the
catalyst of (he reader’s emotions
and judgments.
While the leader is torn be
tween a desire to end aid to an in
efficient and doomed small busi
ness, and his empathy for the
small entrepreneur, the author
passively finds a place for the ef
ficient of the small businesses
and notes their limits in his con
cluding words: “Small business
men claim to be the cornerstone
of American democracy, but it is
doubtful if they can be counted
upon to furnish imaginative and
constructive leadership. There is

ance, that they possess the quali

PROFESSOR Bunzel finds the
supposed motto “free competi
tion” to be far from the actual
desires of the small businessman.
He is doing his utmost, by what
ever means possible, to eliminate
his main competition: big busi
ness. As he sees our contempo
rary economy as a "threat to his
private world” and is frustrated
in attempts to halt its progress,
he comes to view life as a conspir
acy. His conspiratorial outlook is
projected beyond the business
sphere to all facets of life, mak
ing him a likely candidate for the
radical right from McCarthy to
Welch.
The Stanford political scien
tist’s treatment of the small busi
ness associations is so personable
that the reader is shocked as, in
the latter portion of the book, he
is confronted with a barrage of
their policy statements that can
be judged as little more than ri
diculous.
ONE SMALL business associ
ation declared itself “unalterably
opposed” to the Point Four Pro
gram as this “fantastic program
. . . is a Marxian planned Utopia
to equalize the standards of liv
ing . . .” Eighty percent of the
membership of another organiza
tion voted for complete elimina
tion of foreign aid. Schools are
seen as the subversive defamers
of all that Is American, big busi
ness is the unAmerican and im

moral product of leftists, and
unions as the enslaver of both
owner and worker.
The views of the small business
organizations stand in relief from
those of big business, which tend
to realize the need of modifica
tion of the capitalist system to
yield its just aid to social wel
fare. The “buccaneering view” of
the small businessman leaves him
“more intent on making a fast
dollar.”
Like the epic heroes of old, the
former bastion of the American
Way has fallen prey to his own
fatal flaw: he has become the
true believer of the agrarian
myth he perpetrates. He clutches
the banner of rugged individual
ism as he demands government
action against the big competitor
he cannot out-produce or out-sell.
PROFESSOR Bunzel is a social

scientist, not a novelist, and he
relies upon the fruits of his im
pressive research to act as the
catalyst of (he reader’s emotions
and judgments.
While the leader is torn be
tween a desire to end aid to an in
efficient and doomed small busi
ness, and his empathy for the
small entrepreneur, the author
passively finds a place for the ef
ficient of the small businesses
and notes their limits in his con
cluding words: “Small business
men claim to be the cornerstone
of American democracy, but it is
doubtful if they can be counted
upon to furnish imaginative and
constructive leadership. There is
little reason to assume, on the
basis of their current perform
ance, that they possess the quali
ties necessary to guide a great
democracy in a time of crisis.’

man," by John H. Bunzel (assist

ence) : Alfred Knopf, $4.35.
John Bunzel’s first words in
“The American Small Business
man” are in the form of a chal
lenge directed to him by an AFL
CIO official: the labor leader had
difficulty accepting the thesis
that the small businessman “can
not be counted upon to support
liberal groupings such as organiz
ed labor.”
From paragraph one, page one,
the battle is a pitched one. It is a
battle over the question “who is
the small businessman, what is
he, that all politicians adore him.”
IS THE small businessman the
very cornerstone—-even a true
part—of today’s economic system,
or is he outmoded economically
and reactionary politically?
Should he be “shored up” or left
to the mercy of a big business
market ?
With the final word of page
477. the reader can predict, on the
basis of Professor Bunzel’s al
most overwhelmingly thorough
research, the outcome of the fray.
The sympathetic reader—liberal
or conservative—may, however,
have trouble determining for
what he should be rooting.
Facts come fast and furiously
to verify Bunzel’s statement “eco
nomically small business is inse
cure as well as inferior.” To what
the small businessman attributes
his predicament and the solutions
he proposes to it are surprising,
revealing, and somewhat con
demning.
