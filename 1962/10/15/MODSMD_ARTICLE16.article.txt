Editor, Tlie Daily:
A recognition of the value of
studying in a different country
has led to the establishment of
Stanford’s numerous overseas
campuses. They have been praised
for their broadening effects on
students’ minds, their contribu
tion toward improving interna
tional relations, and for eliminat
ing the problem of transferring
units from a European universi
ty to our own. As a student re
turning from Stanford in France,
I have realized that there are de
fects inherent in putting 80
American students together in a
foreign country, and that the
value of the program can he
questioned.
The reasons a student decides
to apply for a foreign campus
are, presumably, that he wants
to become familiar with a culture
significantly different from our
own, to acquire a degree of flu
ency in another language, and to
meet the people living there.
At a foreign campus, however,
one is required to be in the cen
ter twelve or thirteen hours a
day, and will in fact spend far
more time than that at the center
to prepare for classes, eat dinner,
etc. It is inevitable that the stu
dents speak English to each other,
although efforts may be made
sporadically to speak the host
language. A number of students
in Stanford in France had had
less than a year of French (two
quarters is the requirement for
admission. It is less for some of
the other campuses).
That these students conversed
almost entirely with Americans
is hardly surprising. Another
language is not learned simply
by being in another country; to
learn it, one must be forced to
use it in all his conversations,
even to fulfill his basic needs.
Those students who have studied
French for several years before
coming do improve their French
somewhat, but it is normal to
spend your time with people
whom you see several times a
day, who study the same subjects
you do, and who have the same
problems you do. The students
who had studied French before
coming acquired proficiency
where they could have acquired
fluency.
It is true that Stanford stu
dents meet French families, but
they see them no more than once
a week and can get only a dim
idea of the nature of French
family life in that time. Contact
with French students is some
what more extensive, although
the amount of contact varies with
linguistic ability and initiative.
But as the Stanford student lives
in a totally different environ
ment, sees different professors,
and takes different subjects, even
the most aggressive Stanford stu
dent may find that he has little

in common with the French stu
dent. With so little contact with
the French, especially for those
who are weak in French, it is ap
parent that the broadening con
tact with another cultural envir
onment is limited.
As for the units transferred to
Stanford, I got these units by
studying Child Psychology, Ab
normal Psychology, the Philoso
phy of Art, the History of the
Novel, and (mercifullyl French.
The student at an overseas cam
pus has no choice of courses and
must take what he is offered.
One is justified in wondering
what some of these courses have
to do with the "European Experi
ence.”
My policy for revising Stan
ford's overseas campus program
would be to abolish them. You
can learn a good deal more about
another country by spending the
twelve hundred dollars travelling,
attending a foreign university, or
living with a European family
(this custom is widely practiced
in Europe). Once a student is at
an overseas campus, he cannot
change his mind and attend a
European university. If he tries
to leave, he forfeits his tuition
and room and board payments as
well as his standing as a student
of Stanford University.
One can argue that the over
seas campus program makes it
possible for a student who has
not studied another language to
study in Europe. But is it a uni
versity’s function to send to Eu
rope students who have not
shown enough interest in another
country even to learn the lan
guage? Another argument for the
campuses is (hat it permits people
to go to Europe whose parents
would not otherwise permit them
to go. Again, it is not a universi
ty’s function to act as a corrective
agency for negligent parents.
But as it is unlikely that the
University will abandon their
overseas campuses, I simply ap
peal to all those who are consider
ing attending one to consider how
much more they could get by de
vising a program of their own.
And to the University, I appeal
for an intelligent revising of the
credit system so that those who
do attend a foreign campus can
receive credit for the work they
have done, and graduate on time.

One can argue that the over
seas campus program makes it
possible for a student who has
not studied another language to
study in Europe. But is it a uni
versity’s function to send to Eu
rope students who have not
shown enough interest in another
country even to learn the lan
guage? Another argument for the
campuses is (hat it permits people
to go to Europe whose parents
would not otherwise permit them
to go. Again, it is not a universi
ty’s function to act as a corrective
agency for negligent parents.
But as it is unlikely that the
University will abandon their
overseas campuses, I simply ap
peal to all those who are consider
ing attending one to consider how
much more they could get by de
vising a program of their own.
And to the University, I appeal
for an intelligent revising of the
credit system so that those who
do attend a foreign campus can
receive credit for the work they
have done, and graduate on time.

A recognition of the value of
studying in a different country
has led to the establishment of
Stanford’s numerous overseas
campuses. They have been praised
for their broadening effects on
students’ minds, their contribu
tion toward improving interna
tional relations, and for eliminat
ing the problem of transferring
units from a European universi
ty to our own. As a student re
turning from Stanford in France,
I have realized that there are de
fects inherent in putting 80
American students together in a
foreign country, and that the
value of the program can he
questioned.
The reasons a student decides
to apply for a foreign campus
are, presumably, that he wants
to become familiar with a culture
significantly different from our
own, to acquire a degree of flu
ency in another language, and to
meet the people living there.
At a foreign campus, however,
one is required to be in the cen
ter twelve or thirteen hours a
day, and will in fact spend far
more time than that at the center
to prepare for classes, eat dinner,
etc. It is inevitable that the stu
dents speak English to each other,
although efforts may be made
sporadically to speak the host
language. A number of students
in Stanford in France had had
less than a year of French (two
quarters is the requirement for
admission. It is less for some of
the other campuses).
That these students conversed
almost entirely with Americans
is hardly surprising. Another
language is not learned simply
by being in another country; to
learn it, one must be forced to
use it in all his conversations,
even to fulfill his basic needs.
Those students who have studied
French for several years before
coming do improve their French
somewhat, but it is normal to
spend your time with people
whom you see several times a
day, who study the same subjects
you do, and who have the same
problems you do. The students
who had studied French before
coming acquired proficiency
where they could have acquired
fluency.
It is true that Stanford stu
dents meet French families, but
they see them no more than once
a week and can get only a dim
idea of the nature of French
family life in that time. Contact
with French students is some
what more extensive, although
the amount of contact varies with
linguistic ability and initiative.
But as the Stanford student lives
in a totally different environ
ment, sees different professors,
and takes different subjects, even
the most aggressive Stanford stu
dent may find that he has little

in common with the French stu
dent. With so little contact with
the French, especially for those
who are weak in French, it is ap
parent that the broadening con
tact with another cultural envir
onment is limited.
As for the units transferred to
Stanford, I got these units by
studying Child Psychology, Ab
normal Psychology, the Philoso
phy of Art, the History of the
Novel, and (mercifullyl French.
The student at an overseas cam
pus has no choice of courses and
must take what he is offered.
One is justified in wondering
what some of these courses have
to do with the "European Experi
ence.”
My policy for revising Stan
ford's overseas campus program
would be to abolish them. You
can learn a good deal more about
another country by spending the
twelve hundred dollars travelling,
attending a foreign university, or
living with a European family
(this custom is widely practiced
in Europe). Once a student is at
an overseas campus, he cannot
change his mind and attend a
European university. If he tries
to leave, he forfeits his tuition
and room and board payments as
well as his standing as a student
of Stanford University.

in common with the French stu
dent. With so little contact with
the French, especially for those
who are weak in French, it is ap
parent that the broadening con
tact with another cultural envir
onment is limited.
As for the units transferred to
Stanford, I got these units by
studying Child Psychology, Ab
normal Psychology, the Philoso
phy of Art, the History of the
Novel, and (mercifullyl French.
The student at an overseas cam
pus has no choice of courses and
must take what he is offered.
One is justified in wondering
what some of these courses have
to do with the "European Experi
ence.”
My policy for revising Stan
ford's overseas campus program
would be to abolish them. You
can learn a good deal more about
another country by spending the
twelve hundred dollars travelling,
attending a foreign university, or
living with a European family
(this custom is widely practiced
in Europe). Once a student is at
an overseas campus, he cannot
change his mind and attend a
European university. If he tries
to leave, he forfeits his tuition
and room and board payments as
well as his standing as a student
of Stanford University.
One can argue that the over
seas campus program makes it
possible for a student who has
not studied another language to
study in Europe. But is it a uni
versity’s function to send to Eu
rope students who have not
shown enough interest in another
country even to learn the lan
guage? Another argument for the
campuses is (hat it permits people
to go to Europe whose parents
would not otherwise permit them
to go. Again, it is not a universi
ty’s function to act as a corrective
agency for negligent parents.
But as it is unlikely that the
University will abandon their
overseas campuses, I simply ap
peal to all those who are consider
ing attending one to consider how
much more they could get by de
vising a program of their own.
And to the University, I appeal
for an intelligent revising of the
credit system so that those who
do attend a foreign campus can
receive credit for the work they
have done, and graduate on time.

A recognition of the value of
studying in a different country
has led to the establishment of
Stanford’s numerous overseas
campuses. They have been praised
for their broadening effects on
students’ minds, their contribu
tion toward improving interna
tional relations, and for eliminat
ing the problem of transferring
units from a European universi
ty to our own. As a student re
turning from Stanford in France,
I have realized that there are de
fects inherent in putting 80
American students together in a
foreign country, and that the
value of the program can he
questioned.
The reasons a student decides
to apply for a foreign campus
are, presumably, that he wants
to become familiar with a culture
significantly different from our
own, to acquire a degree of flu
ency in another language, and to
meet the people living there.
At a foreign campus, however,
one is required to be in the cen
ter twelve or thirteen hours a
day, and will in fact spend far
more time than that at the center
to prepare for classes, eat dinner,
etc. It is inevitable that the stu
dents speak English to each other,
although efforts may be made
sporadically to speak the host
language. A number of students
in Stanford in France had had
less than a year of French (two
quarters is the requirement for
admission. It is less for some of
the other campuses).
That these students conversed
almost entirely with Americans
is hardly surprising. Another
language is not learned simply
by being in another country; to
learn it, one must be forced to
use it in all his conversations,
even to fulfill his basic needs.
Those students who have studied
French for several years before
coming do improve their French
somewhat, but it is normal to
spend your time with people
whom you see several times a
day, who study the same subjects
you do, and who have the same
problems you do. The students
who had studied French before
coming acquired proficiency
where they could have acquired
fluency.
It is true that Stanford stu
dents meet French families, but
they see them no more than once
a week and can get only a dim
idea of the nature of French
family life in that time. Contact
with French students is some
what more extensive, although
the amount of contact varies with
linguistic ability and initiative.
But as the Stanford student lives
in a totally different environ
ment, sees different professors,
and takes different subjects, even
the most aggressive Stanford stu
dent may find that he has little

in common with the French stu
dent. With so little contact with
the French, especially for those
who are weak in French, it is ap
