# CHINA, USSR
## Ideology Not Chief Reason For Quarrel 
### RON BASS Contributing Editor 
The thirteenth anniversary of
the People’s Republic of China
descended upon Peking at the be
ginning of the month, and the
government reportedly had to
draw upon the full resources of
its benevolent wisdom to calm the
frenzied adulation of the adoring
populace.
Of greater interest to the West
was the fact that both Premier
Chou En-lai and Foreign Minister
Chen Yi made use of the festive
occasion to sound off about the
Soviet Union. They asserted that
despite their recent economic dif
ficulties, they would never allow
China to fall under the ideological
domination of “revisionists.” Of
particular notice was the accusa
tion that the Soviets had been
contaminated by their kindly poli
cy toward the unorthodox Tito
regime. This allowed Premier
Khrushchev the opportunity to
send Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev to Belgrade for some
mutually beneficial contamina
tion.

RECENT developments scarce
ly indicate that Sino-Soviet prob
lems are nearing solution. Initial
differences, such as the denunci
ation of Stalin at the Twentieth
Party Congress and the Moscow
refusal to aid Mao with his Tai
wan Strait difficulties, have been
augmented by increasingly com
plex auxiliary problems.
Russia’s adoption of economic
competition as a weapon against
imperialism is regarded by Mao
as a retreat from the necessity of
violent revolution. Bitterly criti
cal of Soviet weakness in their re
lations with the West, Mao has
been disappointed by Khrush
chev’s failure to run Allied Occu
pation out of Berlin by force.
The Chinese have long been dis
satisfied with the sporadic eco
nomic aid offered by Russia, and
have recently been forced to alter
drastically their import-export
ratio to pay off back debts owed
to the Soviets. While keeping Chi
nese aid at a minimum, Khrush
chev has lightened the integration
of Comecon (Council of Mutual
Economic Assistance and has in
cluded Outer Mongolia as a mem
ber. China is, of course, totally ex
cluded from Comecon, and Alba
nia’s participation has been re
duced to nothing. Khrushchev has
suggested that there should be
economic cooperation between
Comecon and the Common Mar
ket. One can imagine the hemor
rhaging this has caused in Pe
king.
THE SITUATION has been ag
gravated by talk of the planned
closing of Soviet Consulates in
China, and Chinese ministers
have been treated coldly in Mos
cow. The New York Times tells
of the retiring Chinese Ambassa
dor to the Soviet Union being
seen off by a subordinate, while
Khrushchev was entertaining the
retiring Ambassador from West
Germany.
Brezhnev’s recent trip to Yugo
slavia. under Chinese protests of
revisionism, met with less than
resounding success. Tito still
would not approve of a separate
peace treaty with East Germany,
but saw much of interest in the
Soviet economic overtures.
China’s ally in the Balkans, tiny
Albania, has been able to state
Chinese criticism of Russia in far
stronger terms than China, a
nominal ally of the Soviet Union,
can do herself. Tirana’s “Zen I
Popullit” accuses Khrushchev “of
rapprochement and open recon
ciliation with imperialism, of the
establishment of broad economic
and political collaboration with
the imperialist countries.” Pretty
strong stuff.
THE BATTLE between the two
factions is most severe in Asia.
Tensions have been heightened
by recent Soviet economic and
military aid to Itrdia, now in
volved in border conflicts with
China. North Korea and North
Vietnam are now more solidly in
the Chinese camp, and Peking
has made strong inroads into the
Communist Parties of Indonesia
and Japan. Friendship with Ja
pan seems particularly important
as the Chinese are attempting to
buy machinery that will relieve
them of dependence on the Soviet
Union.
The Sino-Soviet split has de
veloped not so much from in
tensely sincere ideological differ
ences, as from wide variance of
national interests. As China’s de
pendence on the Soviet Union has
dwindled, and as their position in
the East has been strengthened,
the two nations have come to re
alize that competitors make back
stabbing allies. If an open split
occurs, the consequences for the
West will be large indeed. The im
minence of Chinese nuclear capa
bility places a shadow ov*r the
Soviets who fear not merely Chi
nese attack, but the far more
likely prospect of being drawn
into nuclear war by the actions
of the more militant Chinese.
New leaders and new alliances
will alter the future, but the divi
sion exists and will perhaps soon
become the most volatile of all in
ternational issues.

likely prospect of being drawn
into nuclear war by the actions
of the more militant Chinese.
New leaders and new alliances
will alter the future, but the divi
sion exists and will perhaps soon
become the most volatile of all in
ternational issues.
The thirteenth anniversary of
the People’s Republic of China
descended upon Peking at the be
ginning of the month, and the
government reportedly had to
draw upon the full resources of
its benevolent wisdom to calm the
frenzied adulation of the adoring
populace.
Of greater interest to the West
was the fact that both Premier
Chou En-lai and Foreign Minister
Chen Yi made use of the festive
occasion to sound off about the
Soviet Union. They asserted that
despite their recent economic dif
ficulties, they would never allow
China to fall under the ideological
domination of “revisionists.” Of
particular notice was the accusa
tion that the Soviets had been
contaminated by their kindly poli
cy toward the unorthodox Tito
regime. This allowed Premier
Khrushchev the opportunity to
send Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev to Belgrade for some
mutually beneficial contamina
tion.

RECENT developments scarce
ly indicate that Sino-Soviet prob
lems are nearing solution. Initial
differences, such as the denunci
ation of Stalin at the Twentieth
Party Congress and the Moscow
refusal to aid Mao with his Tai
wan Strait difficulties, have been
augmented by increasingly com
plex auxiliary problems.
Russia’s adoption of economic
competition as a weapon against
imperialism is regarded by Mao
as a retreat from the necessity of
violent revolution. Bitterly criti
cal of Soviet weakness in their re
lations with the West, Mao has
been disappointed by Khrush
chev’s failure to run Allied Occu
pation out of Berlin by force.
The Chinese have long been dis
satisfied with the sporadic eco
nomic aid offered by Russia, and
have recently been forced to alter
drastically their import-export
ratio to pay off back debts owed
to the Soviets. While keeping Chi
nese aid at a minimum, Khrush
chev has lightened the integration
of Comecon (Council of Mutual
Economic Assistance and has in
cluded Outer Mongolia as a mem
ber. China is, of course, totally ex
cluded from Comecon, and Alba
nia’s participation has been re
duced to nothing. Khrushchev has
suggested that there should be
economic cooperation between
Comecon and the Common Mar
ket. One can imagine the hemor
rhaging this has caused in Pe
king.
THE SITUATION has been ag
gravated by talk of the planned
closing of Soviet Consulates in
China, and Chinese ministers
have been treated coldly in Mos
cow. The New York Times tells
of the retiring Chinese Ambassa
dor to the Soviet Union being
seen off by a subordinate, while
Khrushchev was entertaining the
retiring Ambassador from West
Germany.
Brezhnev’s recent trip to Yugo
slavia. under Chinese protests of
revisionism, met with less than
resounding success. Tito still
would not approve of a separate
peace treaty with East Germany,
but saw much of interest in the
Soviet economic overtures.
China’s ally in the Balkans, tiny
Albania, has been able to state
Chinese criticism of Russia in far
stronger terms than China, a
nominal ally of the Soviet Union,
can do herself. Tirana’s “Zen I
Popullit” accuses Khrushchev “of
rapprochement and open recon
ciliation with imperialism, of the
establishment of broad economic
and political collaboration with
the imperialist countries.” Pretty
strong stuff.
THE BATTLE between the two
factions is most severe in Asia.
Tensions have been heightened
by recent Soviet economic and
military aid to Itrdia, now in
volved in border conflicts with
China. North Korea and North
Vietnam are now more solidly in
the Chinese camp, and Peking
has made strong inroads into the
Communist Parties of Indonesia
and Japan. Friendship with Ja
pan seems particularly important
as the Chinese are attempting to
buy machinery that will relieve
them of dependence on the Soviet
Union.
The Sino-Soviet split has de
veloped not so much from in
tensely sincere ideological differ
ences, as from wide variance of
national interests. As China’s de
pendence on the Soviet Union has
dwindled, and as their position in
the East has been strengthened,
the two nations have come to re
alize that competitors make back
stabbing allies. If an open split
occurs, the consequences for the
West will be large indeed. The im

alize that competitors make back
stabbing allies. If an open split
occurs, the consequences for the
West will be large indeed. The im
minence of Chinese nuclear capa
bility places a shadow ov*r the
Soviets who fear not merely Chi
nese attack, but the far more
likely prospect of being drawn
into nuclear war by the actions
of the more militant Chinese.
New leaders and new alliances
will alter the future, but the divi
sion exists and will perhaps soon
become the most volatile of all in
ternational issues.
The thirteenth anniversary of
the People’s Republic of China
descended upon Peking at the be
ginning of the month, and the
government reportedly had to
draw upon the full resources of
its benevolent wisdom to calm the
frenzied adulation of the adoring
populace.
Of greater interest to the West
was the fact that both Premier
Chou En-lai and Foreign Minister
Chen Yi made use of the festive
occasion to sound off about the
Soviet Union. They asserted that
despite their recent economic dif
ficulties, they would never allow
China to fall under the ideological
domination of “revisionists.” Of
particular notice was the accusa
tion that the Soviets had been
contaminated by their kindly poli
cy toward the unorthodox Tito
regime. This allowed Premier
Khrushchev the opportunity to
send Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev to Belgrade for some
mutually beneficial contamina
tion.

RECENT developments scarce
ly indicate that Sino-Soviet prob
lems are nearing solution. Initial
differences, such as the denunci
ation of Stalin at the Twentieth
Party Congress and the Moscow
refusal to aid Mao with his Tai
wan Strait difficulties, have been
augmented by increasingly com
plex auxiliary problems.
Russia’s adoption of economic
competition as a weapon against
imperialism is regarded by Mao
as a retreat from the necessity of
violent revolution. Bitterly criti
cal of Soviet weakness in their re
lations with the West, Mao has
been disappointed by Khrush
chev’s failure to run Allied Occu
pation out of Berlin by force.
The Chinese have long been dis
satisfied with the sporadic eco
nomic aid offered by Russia, and
have recently been forced to alter
drastically their import-export
ratio to pay off back debts owed
to the Soviets. While keeping Chi
nese aid at a minimum, Khrush
chev has lightened the integration
of Comecon (Council of Mutual
Economic Assistance and has in
cluded Outer Mongolia as a mem
ber. China is, of course, totally ex
cluded from Comecon, and Alba
nia’s participation has been re
duced to nothing. Khrushchev has
suggested that there should be
economic cooperation between
Comecon and the Common Mar
ket. One can imagine the hemor
rhaging this has caused in Pe
king.
THE SITUATION has been ag
gravated by talk of the planned
closing of Soviet Consulates in
China, and Chinese ministers
have been treated coldly in Mos
cow. The New York Times tells
of the retiring Chinese Ambassa
dor to the Soviet Union being
seen off by a subordinate, while
Khrushchev was entertaining the
retiring Ambassador from West
Germany.
Brezhnev’s recent trip to Yugo
slavia. under Chinese protests of
revisionism, met with less than
resounding success. Tito still
would not approve of a separate
peace treaty with East Germany,
but saw much of interest in the
Soviet economic overtures.
China’s ally in the Balkans, tiny
Albania, has been able to state
Chinese criticism of Russia in far
stronger terms than China, a
nominal ally of the Soviet Union,
can do herself. Tirana’s “Zen I
Popullit” accuses Khrushchev “of
rapprochement and open recon
ciliation with imperialism, of the
establishment of broad economic
and political collaboration with
the imperialist countries.” Pretty
strong stuff.
THE BATTLE between the two
factions is most severe in Asia.
Tensions have been heightened
by recent Soviet economic and
military aid to Itrdia, now in
volved in border conflicts with
China. North Korea and North
Vietnam are now more solidly in
the Chinese camp, and Peking
has made strong inroads into the
Communist Parties of Indonesia
and Japan. Friendship with Ja
pan seems particularly important
as the Chinese are attempting to
buy machinery that will relieve
them of dependence on the Soviet
Union.
The Sino-Soviet split has de
veloped not so much from in
tensely sincere ideological differ
ences, as from wide variance of
national interests. As China’s de
pendence on the Soviet Union has
dwindled, and as their position in
the East has been strengthened,
the two nations have come to re
alize that competitors make back
stabbing allies. If an open split
occurs, the consequences for the
West will be large indeed. The im
