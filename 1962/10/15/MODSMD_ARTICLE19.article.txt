Editor, The Dally:
Many of your opinions and ar
ticles are slanted toward one
point of view, one that is becom
ing extremely unpopular down
here in the South where men like
Dr. Schwarz, J. Edgar Hoover,
and Richard Nixon are having the
courage to expose the filthy, cor
cupt works of Communism.
There is a noticeable lack of
any mention of the Crusades that
are awakening Americans from
the stupor they have been in since
World War II ended.
Since when does “demand”
mean ‘‘refuse?" One ambiguous
heading which prompted this let
ter was “Dr. Schwarz Refuses
Bridges Debate.” Now that was
extremely clever twisting of the
truth. The article went on to say
that Dr. Schwarz would not ac
cept (refused) San Francisco
State as the location for a debate
but he demanded a neutral audi
torium where the citizens of San
Francisco can attend.

Editor, The Daily:
Once again our student legisla
ture is making ape-like noises in
the living room, anxious to con
vince us in the non-elite that they
really do have some power, even
if it’s only the negative power to
discourage all activity on the
Stanford campus other than con
stitution-rewriting.
Most recently the wrath of our
youthful solons has been turned
on the much maligned Rally Com
mission. Rally Com, which had a
bad day at the Oregon State
game, is now being threatened
with oblivion. (Typical legislature
straight-thinking; the fifteen
year-old tradition of having card
stunts avoided extinction by three
votes Thursday. Next week
they’re ging after Rally Com it
self.) This hardly seems consist
ent. When Legislature decided,
long after it became obvious, that
it itself was impractical, the rec
ommended solution was an 8-fold
increase in membership. Why
not the same cure for Rally Com?
Legislature has also decided
that our appreciation of football
will be enhanced by desegregat
ing the rooting sections, despite
a recent campus-wide referen
dum to the contrary. Fortunately
no one will pay any attention to
their “decision” in this case, but

their arrogance in the matter
seems noteworthy.
A final word to the legislators:
nobody, except the Trustees, the
Deans, and President Sterling,
has ever denied that you have
some power'. It is your collective
common sense that is under con
stant question. As for the prob
lem of football games, why not
hold your meetings during half
time? Just make sure your con
stituents don’t have anything to
throw.

Editor, Tire Daily:
The International Club presi
dential elections, which were held
Friday saw the success of Mr.
Michael O’Flynn, who was run
ning against the well known Mr.
Sing Walia, by a vote of 175 to
148. It may be interesting to point
out that about 160 new members
registered and voted in the same
day, quite probably thanks to
Mr. O’Flynn’s highly successful
and convincing campaign, par
ticularly in the Crothers Memori
al dormitories.
While hoping that Mr. Waiia’s
precious support will not be lost
to the I-Club, I would like to point
out that indeed a difficult task
awaits Mr. O’Flynn from now bn:
that is to see that tire great num
ber of last-minute members be
come an active part of the asso
ciation. When, and if, this will
happen, I think that no one will
hesitate in defining Mr. O’Flynn
an outstanding President.

Editor, The Daily:
The position taken by Student
Body President Armin Rosen
cranz in his address to the Fresh
men, and later in his inaugural
address to the Legislature, is con
siderably unrealistic, grossly irre
sponsible, and alarmingly naive.
To assert that the attainment
of his “Four Freedoms” will en
able Stanford to “at last take its
rightful place among the truly
great universities of the world”
should evoke indignant response
from the more responsible mem
bers of the Student Body who re
alize that Stanford’s excellence as
an institution of higher learning
is dependent on many more im
portant factors than Mr. Rosen
cranz’s declaration of student in
dependence.
Mr. Rosencranz’s naivete is

readily apparent in his argument
supporting student participation
in high-level policy making. Ro
sencranz says, “Of course stu
dents are younger and less exper
ienced (than the administration
and faculty), but they make up in
enthusiasm and dedication what
they lack in years.”
Need Mr. Rosencranz be re
minded of the inherent danger of
an ill-informed enthusiast? In
deed, one recalls the timeless defi
nition of a fanatic: “a man who
having lost his objective, redou
bles his effort.” Also, one might
well ask if the consistently small
turnout at student elections is evi
dence of student “enthusiasm and
dedication.”
The unrealistic nature of Mr.
Kosencranz’s argument is evident
in his demand that students bo
allowed to completely govern
their own “non-academic” lives.
Two questions must be asked.
First, what great university con
cerns itself only with the training
of the mind? And second, where
shall one draw (ho line between
academic, and non-academic af
fairs? For example, should the
students control the housing pro
gram, the counselling and testing
service, etc,?
“Govern” is an all-embracing
term. Do students have the neces
sary knowledge, experience and
time to say nothing of the desire
-to handle all of the problems
which are associated with their
non-academic university lives?
Mr. Rosencranz’s bargain is an in
teresting one. He is demanding a
greater student voice in adminis
trative affairs, while denying the
administration any voice in stu
dent affairs. Progress is based
upon mutual respect and conces
sion, not upon one-sided com
promise.
Mr. Rosencranz’s argument sup
porting “complete academic free
rom at Stanford” opens the door
to all kinds of irresponsibility. In
suggesting the abolition of the
Committee on Public Exercises,
Mr. Rosencranz asks that the
campus platform be made avail
able to "anybody w’ho has any
thing to say that is worth hear
ing.” One feels compelled to ask
who shall determine what is
worth hearing? Nearly everybody
has something to say that is
worth hearing, hut should w'e
bring them all to Stanford? Uni
versities are the world's guardi

ans of rigorous and responsible
thought, and as such their speak
ers’ platform carries a great deal
of prestige. Should wo give this
prestige to whomever wishes to
capitalize on its value? More
practically, one should ask, who
will do the hours of staff-work in
volved in planning a schedule
which insures a variety of politi
cal and cultural activity on cam
pus should the committee be
abolished. Perhaps we need more,
not less planning—then we might
avoid having Edward P. Morgan
and Dean Rhinelander speaking
on campus at the same hour.
In his argument advocating
partisan political activity on cam
pus, Mr. Rosencranz ignores the
logic of the situation. We must
agree with him when he says that
Senator and Mrs. Stanford’s first
intention was to create a great
university, and one not bound by
19th Century standards. However,
has the Student Body President
considered that the Founders did
not equate partisan political ac
tivity on campus with greatness.
Has he considered that by insert
ing a prohibitory clause in the
founding grant. Senator and Mrs.
Stanford wished to assure that
the campus platform would al
ways be used to inform, and not
to convert?
Lastly, Mr. Rosencranz calls
for the freedom “to emerge from
our apathy and lethargy.” He
charges that ”... many of our
students are secure and lazy

. . . they confine their concerns
to drinking, dating, and having a
good time. The suffering students
of Angola ... go unnoticed.”
Such Irresponsible generalities
are hardly worthy of comment.
One should question their validity
as well as anyone’s right to make
them.
In short, one should ask if the
strength of our nation does not
lie as much with the conscien
tious student w'ho quietly ex
plores many avenues of belief, as
with his more vocal placard-carry
ing counterpart. What would Mr.
Rosencranz have us do? In order
to show we “care” must we all
leave school and join the Peace
Corps? Or must not some of us
attend to the immediate business
at hand?
Mr. Rosencranz would have us
run the University, while saving
both our generation and the
world—all this while “fulfilling

the common purpose that brought
us to Stanford, which is to get an
education.” (his words) His posi
tion approaches the ridiculous
when compared to another state
ment in his Freshman address. He
says “activities often aid that pur
pose (educationi, but your own
judgment must keep you from
passing the point of diminishing
returns.” I would submit that Mr.
Rosencranz has long since passed
the point of diminishing returns.
The unrealistic, irresponsible and
naive manner of his presentation
raises grave questions as to the
future of this year’s student gov
ernment.
