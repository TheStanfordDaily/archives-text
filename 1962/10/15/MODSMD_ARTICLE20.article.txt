# Soccer Team Swamps Gators, 7-2
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The show must go on, but by
the time the entertainment ceased
Saturday, the San Francisco State
Gators must have wished they
could pull the bowl of mush that
was the Stanford soccer field over
their heads and forget the whole
affair.
Stanford systematically demol
ished what had been billed as the
best Gator team ever by a deci
sive 7-2 margin, in a game that
was contested in a driving l ain on
a field that had the consistency
of a dish of flapjack batter.
Sophomore Don Griffith and
junior Ed Clark led the scoring
with two goals each. Stu Rawl
ings, A1 Nnoli and Jim Armstrong
chipped in one apiece.
The game was only eight min
utes old when Griffith drove past
the fullbacks, faked the goalie to
his knees in the slop, and easily
punched the ball past him for a
1-0 lead.
SF State tied it four minutes

later, but it was the last time they
were in the contest, us they didn’t
get their second til they were be
hind 6-1. Goalie Kent Mueller mis
judged a shot which bounced on a
wet spot and skidded over him for
the tying score.
Early in the second quarter
Nnoli put Stanford ahead to stay,
and Griffith's second score fol
lowed closely for 3-1.
Armstrong made it 4-1 in the
third period with a 25-foot shot
that made it into the corner of
the net out of reach of the be
leaguered goalie.
Clark iced the game early in
the fourth quarter with a shot
duplicating Armstrong’s. Then
Rawlings headed the ball into the
net with the aid of a perfect set
up pass from Clark, and Clark
got the last score on a corner kick.
Stanford standouts wore goalie
Mueller, fullback Sandy Pofahl
and forwards Nnoli. Clark, Grif
fith and Klaas Bergman. When
Stanford was in trouble with the

ball deep in their territory it
usually was a fine kick by Pofahl
that put the Gators back in their
own territory. Mueller was excel
lent in the driving rain, several
times batting away what seemed
certain goals.
