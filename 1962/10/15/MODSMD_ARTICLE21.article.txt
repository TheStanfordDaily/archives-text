## Frosh Footballers Surprise Trojans With Immovable Li, Muddy Field 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Stanford s determined freshman gridders apparently don’t read the papers, and it’s a lucky
tiling. The frosh line, supposedly the team’s weak point, fought off a continuous wave of Trojan
scoring threats to heat the SC frosh 13-6, Saturday, on a Stanford Stadium field fit only for water
polo. The complexion of the game, one in which pontoons were needed rather than platoons, was
revealed on the first series of downs. Indian quarterback Mike Connelly fumbled on the Stanford

6 yard line, and Danny Davis re--I
covered for SC. Four plays later
the ball rested on the 12 yard line,
Stanford’s line having pushed the
men of Troy back.
After a scoreless first quarter,
a Stanford fumble again appeared
to hand SC a score. Don Cook had
the snap from center squirt out
of his hands on a punt attempt,
and Troy gained possession on the
Cards’ 13 yard line. The Big Red
again pushed SC steadily back,
forcing the Los Angeles boys to
punt.
Stanford's only defensive lapse
of the game resulted in a SC score
moments later. Mike Garrett, who
was the sum total of the Trojan’s
offense all day, took a pitch out
from quarterback Troy Winslow
and rambled 48 yards around right
end for the tally.
The Indian frosh mounted their
first sustained drive after receiv
ing the kickoff. Sparked by two
passes from Connelly to Pete Mid
dlekauff, the Indians dxove to the
5 yard line with 30 seconds remain
ing in the half. Glenn Myers
carried twice, netting three yards,
and Connelly dove over for the 6
points. Joel Kay’s conversion kick
put Stanford ahead to stay.
Neither team would give ground
in the third quarter. In fact, Stan
ford failed to cross the fifty yard
line until three minutes into the

fourth period. When they finally
made it, there was no stopping
them. Ray Handley took a pitch
from Connelly on the 14 and went
86 yards, behind tremendous block
ing, to the score that broke the
Trojans’ back. The kick was
blocked, but Stanford’s rugged de
fense made the 13-6 advantage
stand up.
No single player can be singled
out as having won the game. The
interior line, outweighed and sup
posedly outclassed, moved the Tro
jan line play after play. SC’s mul
tiple offense, featuring a man in
motion on almost every play, was
bottled up continually. Garrett,
the boy who carried SC’s hopes,
was running into his own blockers
all afternoon. Bill Ogle, Arnie
Krogh, and Gary Pettigrew led

Stanford’s forward charge.

The backfield was not without
its standout performers. Middle
kauff and Craig Pitchey made
several key blocks and jarring
tackles. Connelly’s timely runs and
expert signal calling kept the In
dian’s offense rolling, and Hand
ley’s long sprint put the game out
of Troy’s reach. Glenn Myers and
Bob Stoecker, who alternated at
fullback, got tlie short yardage on
straight power plays.
Victory was well-deserved for
the underdog Indians. For SC’s
gridders, it was a long day, one
which they spent face down in the
mud for the most part.
