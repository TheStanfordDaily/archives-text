CHICAGO (UPI) An 80-yard
pass play from John Brodie to
Jim Johnson with less than seven
minutes of play carried the San
Francisco Forty Miners to a 34-
27 National Football League tri
umph Sunday over the butter
fingered Chicago Bears.
The Bears lost the ball three
times on fumbles and once on a
pass interception. On all but
one of these mistakes, the Forty
Miners capitalized with points.
It was the Forty Miners’ third
win in five games this season and
evened them with the Bears at
3-2 in the Western Division. The
Bears defeated the Forty-Miners
30-14 in the season opener.
Abe Woodson recovered a fum
ble by Rick Casares and ran 37
yards for a touchdown. Another
Chicago fumble, by rookie Ronnie
Bull on a kick off return, was
scooped up by Jim Vollenweider
on the Bears 24. It set up a one
yard touchdown plunge by J, D.
Smith, his second score of the
game.
Smith’s first touchdown, on a
four-yard plunge, came after Jer
ry Mertens intercepted a pass by
Bill Wade on the Bears 27.
