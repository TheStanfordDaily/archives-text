# SU Runs Second In Sacramento Meet
## 
### GERRY FRY 
The Weather may have stopped
the Yankees and Giants Saturday
but the Stanford cross country
cut it for a creditable showing.
The Indians competed at Sacra
mento against San Jose State,
Fresno State, Sacramento State,
and various northern California
athletic clubs. Stanford, which
had 21 points to San Jose’s 43,
could not compete with the strong
San Jose squad, but finished an
admirable second.
Running conditions were not
exactly ideal. Facing strong winds
and heavy rain, about 80 runners
dashed through muddy fields of
water. Danny Murphy of San
Jose Stale ran the soggy 3.5 mile
course in 17:56, a good time con
sidering the adverse conditions.
Dave Deubner, Stanford’s highly
regarded freshman, was impres
sive, finishing third in 18:26.
Harry McCalla, Stanford’s star
two-miler, finished ninth at 18:46.
He commented: “This was my
most unique running experience.”
Next Saturday, Stanford’s squad
takes on San Jose State in a dual
meet. Coach Jordan is looking
for his squad to show substantial
improvement, for Saturday’s meet
was the first for Stanford, where
as San Jose had already had two
meets this year.
