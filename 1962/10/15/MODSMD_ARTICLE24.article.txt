# FUMBLES, INTERCEPTIONS HURT
## Indian Offense Stumbles; Defense Great 
### PETE KING 
Slopped time and again by its
own mistakes, a frustrated Stan
ford football team still beat an
unimpressive Washington State
eleven Saturday by a huge sta
tistical margin but lost on the
scoreboard, 21(5.
A sparse crowd of 17,250 in Spo
kane’s Municipal Stadium watched
Stanford stop the Cougars cold,
only to be beaten by a blocked
kick, a kick-off return, and three
pass interceptions.
Behind 7-0 at halftime, the In
dians came storming out ready
to show WSU the brand of foot
ball that had beaten Michigan
State.
BI T A CERTAIN Cougar half
back named Kenny Graham quick
ly snuffed out Card hopes when
he took the kickoff on the eight
yard line, faked a handoff that
fooled five Indians, deftly avoided
the grasp of tackle Frank Atkin
[ son on the 35, and scampered 92
yards for a touchdown.
Although Graham’s run was the
j turning point of the game, Stan
| ford still managed to threaten
throughout the second half. But
for an intercepted pass by Cougar
Clele Baltes, it might have tied
it up in the third quarter.
All afternoon the Indians start
ed threatening drives, only to have
them quenched by three fumbles
and three interceptions. Baltes
particularly pestered the Tribe,
snaring three Indian aerials, one
of which led to the Cougars' last
touchdown.
WASHINGTON STATE broke
the scoring ice on the first play
of the second quarter on a freak
play that left the few Card rooters
open-mouthed in disbelief.
With third down and five on
their own 12 yard line, the In
dians tried their first and pos
sibly last, quick kick in two sea
sons. Halfback Stan Lindskog
took a pifehback, stepped back
two yards, and booted the ball
j hard. It was blocked by onrush
j ing guard Jim Baton; the ball
! bounced into the end zone, and
j Cougar Gery Gehrmann fell on
it for the TD.
Eight plays later, Stanford came
roaring back. After a 13 - yard
WSU punt to Stanford’s 46, Thur
low mixed option plays and hand
offs to halfback J. D. Lodato that
carried the Cards to the WSU
eight yard line. On fourth down,
a pass to end Steve Pursell on the
two was dropped, and the Indians’
bid for a tie was stymied.
THE TRIBE FINALLY saw its
superior offense pay off early in
the final quarter. Behind a jarring
block by end Tom Featherston,
Lodato swept around left end for
22 yards to the WSU 16. Four

| plays later fullback Ed Cummings
I vaulted over center for the score.
| Thurlow was stopped trying to
| run left end for the conversion,
and that was it for the Indians,
Even though the game must be
considered a dismal one for Stan
ford, there were several bright
spots. The Card defense halted
the vaunted Cougar attack superb
ly. VVSU got only 4(5 yards on the
ground, 38 in the- air, and was
forced to punt nine times. Cougar
quarterback Dave Mathieson com
pleted only four of 14 passes, none
of them to All-American end Hugh
Campbell.
STANFORD COACH Jack Cur
tice said of the defense, “I thought
the boys did more things better
than they did against Michigan
Slate.” Our interior line really
out hustled theirs.”
Washington State coach Jim
Sutherland praised the Indians
ground defense. “They played us
wide, stopped our sweeps, and
forced us to go up the middle,”
he said after the game. He thought
that Stanford’s line was the equal
of any in (he country in physical
si renglh.
Lodato, Thurlow, and Cl u y
Kounsaville were individual stand
outs for the Cards. Lodato packed
the ball 15 times for a 5.1 average,
and Kounsaville snagged three
passes for 25 yards. Thurlow’s
roll out options and keeper plays
were reminiscent of those of
Washington’s All-American, Bob
Schloredt. The Indians’ big junior
quarterback ran for 53 yards and
completed five of 10 passes for
41 more.
BI T THE DAY’S best perform
ance was turned in by the Cougar
defensive specialists, the Red
Raiders. Twice they stopped the
Tribe inside the 15 yard line, broke
up several passes, and were able
to stop Stanford on crucial third
and fourth down plays.
It was the sixth straight win
j over Stanford for Washington
State something no other team
has ever done to the Indians in
football.
