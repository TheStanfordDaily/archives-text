# Huskies, Bruins Keep Winning
## 
### 
Washington and UCLA contin
ued their winning ways, building
up their reputations along with
USC as teams to beat in the
AAWU; Cal and Stanford lost
while SC was idle.
The Huskies remained undefeat
ed by a single point in their fourth

j contest of the year by slipping past
j Oregon State 14-13. OSU’s passing
I combination of Terry Baker to
I Vein Burke almost beat the Hus
j kies, but a fumble late in the final
| quarter set up a 60 yard Washing
ton drive that ended the Beavers’
| hope for an upset. Husky half
j back, Charlie Mitchell dived in
j from the two-yard line with the
j score that tied the game at 13-13.
j It took a successful PAT kick,
I however, to break the fie and keep
! the Washington loss column un
blemished.
| Oregon did all their scoring in
the second period- all by the Bak
er to Burke method. In one scor
; ing drive of 80 yards, Burke caught
| three flying footballs for 55 yards
1 and the score. Burke gathered in
a total of 103 yards in the after
noon's effort, while Baker com
pleted 10 of 23 passes, leaving
little doubt that the Beavers have
one of the finest aerial combina
tions in the country.
UCLA had little trouble, scoring

five touchdowns against Colorado
State whose twentieth straight loss
was marked by a humbling 35-7
score. Bruin quarterback, Larry
Zeno led his team by running in
one TD and tossing a 47 yard pass
for another. The Uclans garnered
nearly 400 total yards.
The Golden Bears of California
went down to the Blue Devils of
Duke 21-7 for their second straight
loss. The Devils never did get off
the ground hut they didn’t have
to as their Big Blue Machine
churned up 255 yards rushing to
the Bears’ 12. Mark Liggett and
Mike Curtis each scored in the
first half to give Duke a 14-0 bulge.
Early in the second half Cal QT3
Larry Balliett lobed a 12 yar d pass
to Nelson to complete a 64 yard
scoring drive for the Bear's’ lone
tally. Five minutes later Curtis
ran the score up to 21 for Duke
from 11 yards out.

I Ballieft’s passing kept the Cali
[ fornians alive and the Devils anx
j ious as he completed 15 of 26 for
j 203 yards. Two Cals coring threats
| were waved aside by the deter
mined Duke defense once on
i their' own three yard line.

Stanford’s water polo team
was victorious three times
tills rainy weekend. It heat
Cal 10-3, Cerritos JC 5-3, and
Air Force IH-6. Stories will
run tomorrow.
