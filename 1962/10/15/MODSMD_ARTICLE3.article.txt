# 'Wet Campus' Results From Four-Day Rain
## 
### 
Four days of heavy rains on the
Stanford campus uprooted trees,
flooded basements, blew down
power lines, and started to fill
Lake Lag.
Saturday, as students waded to
the classes, the library and the
post office, the plans for Parents’
Day had to he changed, the fire
department and Corp Yard
wrestled with 75 service calls, and
freshmen began to worry about
the Big Game bonfire.
STORMY WEATHER made it
necessary to change the picnic
scheduled for Parents’ Day at the
gardens of Bowman Alumni
House into an indoor box lunch
eon. The reception that w r as to be
at the President’s home also had
to be moved to Tresidder Union.
Among the calls received by the
fire department were reports of
flooding in the Branner and Din
kelspiol basements, ceiling leaks
in Hoover library, the Law An
nex, and the Art Gallery, leaky
roofs in Storey House, and water
coming in under the front door
in Toyon Hall. Flooding of Pueblo
Street by the biophysics building
and at the intersection of Alvera
do and Santa Ynez, broken water
mains and fallen trees were also
reported.
ELECTRIC POWER was off all
over campus at different times
Saturday. The Row Houses were
without lights from 1 to 6 p.m.
Freshmen worried about the
thin layer of water in Lake Lag
can take hope. Firemen speculate
if there is no more rain before the
Big Game it may bo possible to
have the traditional bonfire.
The rains that caused so much
distress on the Stanford campus
were recorded as a total of 5,01
inches at Redwood and 9.15 inches
at Woodside.
