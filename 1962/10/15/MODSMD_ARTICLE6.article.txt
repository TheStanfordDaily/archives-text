United Press International
VATICAN CITY -Roman Catholic prelates from all over the world
consulted yesterday on the selection of candidates for key Ecumeni
cal Council offices after the council’s first working session was
unexpectedly suspended without a vote on the Vatican-prepared
election list. The first general congregation of the council broke up
Saturday when Ahillo Cardinal Lienart of France, often referred to
as a “modernist” among the church leaders, led a revolt against the
Vatican’s presentation of candidates. He was acting on behalf of a
powerful group of European bishops, it was learned.
The session ended barely 15 minutes after it was called to order
by Frcnch-born Eugene Cardinal Tisserant. The next meeting is set
for tomorrow at 9 a.m., 4 a.m. EDT. There were no sessions sched
uled for either yesterday or today. The council has to elect from its
ranks 160 officials who will work on commissions and secretariats
which will discuss an agenda of 70 topics.

that the Berlin crisis may take a serious turn in the months ahead.
He also assured his listeners that the United States will stand firmly
by its commitments in the divided city. Brandt said Soviet Premier

doubted Western determination to defend West Berlin against the
Communists.
