# HOUSES TO BE CONVERTED INTO DORMS
## Williams Moves to Expel Fraternities 
### 
Trustees of Williams College, Mass., lasi
week took action calculated at eliminating
I fraternities at the school. Starting next Sep
: tember the college will start to take over
from the 15 Greek fraternities their functions
of providing food, lodging, and social activi
ties for members, according to the New York
Times.
The trustees’ plan calls for seizing the
fraternity-owned facilities and converting
them into dorms as soon as they become
| available.
The announcement reaffirmed the stand
i taken by an 11-member committee asked by
) trustees to investigate the fraternity system,
j 129 years old at Williams. The committee,
I composed of nine alumni and two undergrad
-1 nates reported that the role of fraternities
I was “so all-encomposing that their influence
| lends to interfere with the broader, more
j inclusive ends of the college itself.”
THE COMMITTEE learned that 44 per
j cent of men in the three upper classes lived
| in fraternity houses and 94 per cent of the
j upper classmen ate meals there, the Times
said.

In recent years Williams has weakened
its fraternity system by banning membership
for freshmen and enforcing a rush plan that
oblidged at least one of the 15 houses to offer
membership to any student who wished to
join a fraternity.
The committee charged that too much
“otherwise useful energy has already been
wasted in wrestling with the fraternity prob
lem and that the time has come to put an
end to the pressure build ups that for so long
and to so large an extent have monopolized
the attention of many alumni and most of
the undergraduates."
A petition opposing the plan was signed
by 524 students representing 77 per cent of
the fraternity membership. None of the fra
ternities are expected to survive as dorms
since they would be deprived of their main
source of income—house bills.
AT LEAST EIGHT national fraternities
represented at Stanford will very probably
soon lose their chapters at Williams: Beta
Theta Pi, Chi Psi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta
Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon, Phi Delta Theta,
Phi Sigma Kappa, and Zeta Psi.

Delt President Clark Weaver said his
house was violently opposed to the action
taken at Williams. A university should keep
out of the business of any fraternity, he said.
Chi Psi President Fred Richards charged
that in destroying its fraternities, Williams
College contradicts its purpose of existence
—to provide students a COMPLETE educa
tion. • “This means not only book education,
but education in group living, self govern
ment and social participation,” he said.
“The fraternity is an integral part of a
student’s education,” he continued. “In a
fraternity an adolescent will mature into a
man capable of making sensible decisions.
ONLY in a fraternity can a large group of
men run affairs to their own desires, suffer
ing from their mistakes and profiting from
their own achievements.
“Because of its unity, only in a fraternity
can one member openly criticize another with
the intent of not only improving that student
but the entire group freely selected by both
as well.
“In my opinion,” Richards said, “Williams
College no longer has the right to call itself
an institution of COMPLETE education.”
