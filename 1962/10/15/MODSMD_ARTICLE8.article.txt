# New Constitution Is Being Formulated by Legislature
## Election Slated for November; Student Scrutiny Requested 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
In preparation tor a student referendum in mid-November,
LASSU’s Constitution Committee last Friday circulated the first
draft of a new constitution. The new constitution will be sub
jected to five weeks of student scrutiny before the issue comes
to a vote. The members of Legislature who framed the first draft

have expressed the hope that
dents will take full advantage of
'he time between now and Novem
her 21 to contribute to the final
draft.
(Note; Copies of the working
draft of the new constitution are
available in the ASSU offices at
Tresidder. The presidents of all
campus organizations and living
groups are asked to obtain copies
and discuss the constitution with
their constituents. Comments and
suggestions should be submitted,
preferably in writing, to ASSU ad
ministrative assistants Jim Wool
sey, John McCarthy, or John But
ler.)
THE PRINCIPLE complaint
against the present constitution
is its failure to provide for ade
quate communication between the
students and the administration.
The distribution of representa
tives is such that many students
never come in contact with the
persons representing them. As a
result the Administration regards
the Legislature as a semi-repre

tentative body, and takes LASSU
decisions accordingly.
The proposed constitution plans
to eliminate this by electing “one
representative for each undergrad
uate living group, which includes
fraternities, eating clubs, unit
houses of Stern, Wilbur, Florence
Moore and Lagunita, Women’s
Row houses, wings of Roble and
floors of Branner.”
THE NEW CONSTITUTION
also provides “one representative
for every seventy-five undergrad
uate students living off campus
who are not affiliated with any
on-campus living group or eating
club,’’ and “one representative for
every seventy-five graduate stu
dents in each academic division.”
This will increase the size of
Legislature to 120 members, in
cluding 40 graduate students. This
is essentially the same as the
corresponding section of the de
feated constitution, with two ex
ceptions. First, the new constitu
tion does not allow proxy voting.
This eliminates the possibility,
feared last year, of one graduate
student wielding a block of forty
/otes, yet allows the graduate stu
’ents to take advantage of their
representation if they so desire.
Second, the ambiguity over off
campus representation, present in
the defeated constitution, has been
removed by distinguishing be
tween graduates and off-campus
undergraduates.
ANOTHER major change is
n formation of the judiciary. Un
ler the old constitution members
>f Men’s and Women’s Councils
were elected by student vote. Un
’er the new constitution they will
be appointed by the ASSU presi
dent from a list submitted to him
i tiie Legislature.
A student Judicial Coordinator
las been established to “receive
’omplaints of all violations of this
Constitution and the Statures of
the Association, and present evi
dence to the appropriate Council.”
He will also "receive the records
of all subordinate judicial councils
and advise the appropriate council
in cases where retrial is deemed
necessary.”
In effect, the student Judicial
Coordinator will assume the sec
retarial burden of the judiciary.
Many of his duties are presently
handled by the Dean’s Office.
IN ADDITION, the structure of
the judiciary has been clarified.
The jurisdiction of each major
council is specifically stated. Cases
may not only be referred to higher
councils on appeal, but channels
have been provided for referring
cases to lower councils where low
er council action will suffice.
The responsibility for determin
ing constitutionality, which pres
ently rests with the legislature, is
transferred to the Student Coun
cil, the highest student judiciary,
under the new constitution.
