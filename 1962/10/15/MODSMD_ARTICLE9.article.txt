## 
### 
Several issues concerning the
Stanford model United Nations,
to be held the last week in Febru
ary, were clarified yesterday by
HR United Nations Desk chair
man Maynard Toll in a letter to
The Daily.
Each session will be opened by
a prominent speaker followed by
organized debate from the floor
on the agenda topic for that day.
The agenda will include the Ber
lin and China problems, and the
prospects for world government.

posed of students within a par
ticular living group. In special
cases, especially among the fresh
men. there will be arrangements
made for mixed delegations of
both men and women.
Delegations representing coun
tries with well defined opinions
on the agenda topics will be re

ing countries whose records
would indicate a less rigid ap
proach to the particular issues in
volved.
The UN Desk of the HR will
appoint the delegation chairmen
and assign countries. The chair
men will then appoint their owr
delegation members. Any student
wishing to participate, but not in
the capacity of chairman, should
contact the person selected as
chairman from his living group.
All delegations will be required
to do assigned research and to
hold periodic meetings in prepar
ation for the conference.
HR activity credit will be given
to all participants.
Assignment of countries and
chairmanships to applicants will
begin this Wednesday. Applica
tions will continue to be accepted,
however, if any of the 108 coun
tries should still be without repre
sentatives. Application forms are
available in the HR Loft in Tre
sidder.

gates will be held at 4:15 p.m.
Wednesday, Oct. 24 (United Na
