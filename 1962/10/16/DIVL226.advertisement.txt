P. s.
You can get a much better look at that football
game with a pair of binoculars from KEY-BELL Cameras
at 121 Stanford Shopping Center. The low priced ones
start at $14.95 only.
KEY-BELL also has many used still and movie cam
eras on sale. Fred bought a used Bolex for $27 and is
taking wonderful films.
Love, Kate
