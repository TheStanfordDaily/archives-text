It's now a fact: every Ford-built car in *63 has self-adjusting brakes
"Give us a brake,” Ford Motor Company engineers were told, "that’
will automatically compensate for lining wear whenever an adjustment
is needed—and make it work for the entire life of the lining"
Tough assignment-but not insurmountable. Today, not only does
every Ford-built car boast self-adjusting brakes, but the design is so
excellent that adjustments can be made more precisely than by hand.
*
This Ford-pioneered concept is not complex. Key to it is a simple
mechanism which automatically maintains proper clearance between
brake drum and lining.
Self-adjustment takes place when the brakes are applied while backing
up. This adjustment normally occurs but once in several hundred
miles of driving. The brake pedal stays up, providing full pedal
reserve for braking.
