# Soviet Scientists Feel Free, Says Krauskopf
## 
### 
Soviet scientists are a select, generally satisfied group, stated
Professor Conrad Krauskopf, in relating his experience as an
American scientist visiting the Soviet Union. In his talk in Tre
sidder yesterday he tried to help his audience “look at the world
through their eyes.” Krauskopf emphasized the difficulty of ex-

amining the successes of the Rus
sian system from an American
point of view. He claimed that our
two countries have two distinct
inbred philosophies which help to
sustain each system from the in-

side.
THE CONCEPT of freedom, he
said, is not a common one.
Americans think they are free
and most Russians, in good con
science, can think they are free
because we have different defi
nitions of freedom.
The Russians, Krauskopf said,
claim freedom from exploitation,
freedom to provide educational
opportunities where ability is the
sole criteria of selection. Kraus
kopf pointed out that these free
doms are considered of great
value because they were not pres
ent in Czarist Russia.
THE SOVIETS, Krauskopf
said, make comparisons with the
past and not with their contem
poraries in the Western world.
In discussions with individuals,
Krauskopf found no desire for
freedom as we know it. Uncen
sored sources of information and
the freedom of expression were
not felt to be fundamental free
doms. Krauskopf said that the
Russians considered them “sub
sidiary varieties of freedom” and
were willing to wait until they
could afford these luxuries.
