# Williams: Fraternities
## 
### 
The action of the Williams College trustees to abolish the
fraternity system there is remarkable. But it is remarkable for
more than its wisdom, for the trustees were willing to oppose over
whelming student opinion and powerful alumni pressure. Seventy
seven per cent of the* fraternity membership signed a petition
opposing the college’s decision to take over the fraternities’
function of feeding, housing, and entertaining students. Of the
800 students belonging to fraternities, 554 signed the petition:
two-thirds of the membership. The trustees were also subject to
implied threats from alumni to withdraw financial support if the
college tried to abolish the fraternities.
The surprise lies in the fact that the trustees took any action
at all. No doubt Williams’ public image has suffered among the
group of alumni who have never outgrown their fraternity ex
perience.
The committee asked by the trustees to investigate the frater
nity system concluded that “the time has come to put an end to the
pressure build-ups that for so long and to so large an extent have
monopolized the attention of many alumni and most of the under
graduates." Despite the opposition of these groups and the poten
tial adverse effect on the Williams image, the trustees followed
through with the committee’s recommendation.
