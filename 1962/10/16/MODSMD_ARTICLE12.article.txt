# ASSU SCHOLAR:
## Americans, Germans Mix in 'Little America' 
### KLAUS R. SCHERPE 
(Editor’s note: Klaus Scherpe
is a native of Berlin and is pres
ently an ASSU foreign scholar
studying English and German lit
ature. In 1949, for political rea
sons, Ids family moved to West
Berlin from East Berlin.)
On a Sunday afternoon in Au
gust 1961 hundreds of thousands
of West Berliners stood in the
streets to greet the 1,500-man US
Battle Group who entered the
city to reinforce the US Garri
son after the events of August 13,
when the wall was built.
The Berliners repaid in their
own way this first display of soli
darity after some days of silence
and fear. The heavy-armed ve
hicles were lead in triumph up
and down the main streets; the
Berliners waved hats, handker
chiefs and tossed mountains of
flowers over the somewhat tired
and stupified Americans.
IN THE meantime, the newly
arrived soldiers of that time have
become part of the 7.000-man
Berlin Brigade, and will probably
have understood more of Ameri
can-German relations than they
could from their first impression.
In the western suburban dis
trict of Zehlendorf the Americans
have built their own little town
of bungalows and apartment
houses, which certainly does not
look very different from the out
skirts of Los Angeles or any
other place in the US. The whole
community amounts to more than
10,000 souls if one takes the fam
ily dependents and American ci
vilian employees into account.
The street names are mostly
American, the signs are in Eng
lish (Do not enter, Fresh Seed),
and the speed limit is given in
MPH. By the way, the Military
Police deals quite severely with
traffic offenders, though the Ber
liners feel that (he Americans are
extremely polite drivers.
Looking around in “Little
America,” as the Berliners call
it, you will find all the institu
tions and facilities which are dear
to every American. There is the
huge US Shopping Center (re
quest not to park longer than one
hour) and the Sports Center—
with fields for baseball and foot
ball. The football players seem
to be very patriotic for their new
home-town. They call themselves
the “Berlin Bears.” Although
they have already found sup
porters among the Germans,
most of the Saturday afternoon
walkers who pass the football
field look either somewhat un
easy and frightened or highly
amused with tears in their eyes
at the strange things going on on
the field. Other sports like bas
ketball and volleyball have been
imitated by the Gormans in the
meantime, and there are regular
games between German and
American teams.
THE AMERICANS have their
own “Community Chapel,” open
to those of Protestant, Catholic
and Jewish faiths, and their local
High School. There also exists a
German • American Community
School in which German and
American children sit together in
the same class speaking German
and English respectively. Of
course the Community has its

own Post Office and bank, and six
cinemas, the largest of which
(The Outpost) can sell 600 admis
sion tickets.

Although the Americans have
a Community life of their own.
they live and work closely to
gether with the Germans. Apart
from innumerable private con
tacts and friendships, which have
been formed over the past years a
great number of American-Ger
man events and activities take
place all over the year. AFN, Ber
lin, the American radio station
has about fifty times as many
German listeners as American.
Its disc-jockeys are as well
known around the town as any
celebrities. The American-German
“Volksfest” (Folk Festival) takes
place every summer on the
grounds of the American Sports
Center, and is visited by more
than a hundred thousand people.
When a parade is called out for
Armed Forces Day or Independ
ence Day the Berliners are there
in throngs. On Thanksgiving the
Americans invite the Germans to
eat turkey, and in return Ameri
can soldiers are invited into Ger
man families for Christmas.
The ties between the Americans
and the students of the Free Uni
versity of Berlin have always
been very close because the Uni
versity campus is directly adjoin
ing “Little America.” The Ameri
cans come over to the students
just for a talk, and the students
are invited to the Officer’s club,
which is housed in the old Uni
versity Guest House. The Ameri
cans are always ready to help: so
some officers’ families, who all
have private homes, offer rooms
for students in exchange for baby
sitting. Americans who are in
terested in learning German take
lessons from German students.
As a matter of fact both Ameri
cans and Berliners have picked
up a number of common expres
sions and sayings of the other’s
language so that everybody can
make himself understood in this
local Anglo-German slang.

THE FEELINGS of mutual un
derstanding and friendship which
have been constantly developed
between Americans and Germans
cannot be overshadowed by re
cent outbreaks of unfriendliness
against some American guards
at the East German border. These
disturbances were mainly direct
ed against the East German bor
der police, who again had mur
dered an East German refugee.
The Americans were only in
volved in so far as they could not
decide whether or not to help the
wounded man lying behind the
wall. The excited and embittered
crowd wanted an immediate ac
tion on the part of the Americans
and therefore insulted (he Amer
ican guards who were watching
the scene. An incident like this
never occurred before and will,
I hope, never occur again.
The majority of the Berliners
and their American friends did
not feel that their friendly rela
tions had been affected by these
unhappy happenings. They re
alized that what had happened
was due to the ill-fated situation
in Berlin, which becomes more
and more unbearable for both
German and US Berliners.
