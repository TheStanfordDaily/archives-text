## Students Began Movement To Reform Fraternities 
### DAVID M. GOLDBERG 
As a recent alumnus of Wil
liams College, I feel duty bound to
defend the good name of my alma
mater in the face of attacks from
certain Stanford sources who
have only third-hand knowledge
of the situation that exists there.
The Williams fraternity sys
tem is totally different from
those on most campuses. It con
sists of 15 houses to which about
9 per cent of all upperclassmen
belong. All the houses were na
tionals until 1959 when three
were forced by the administra
tion to drop out because of dis
criminatory clauses in national
by-laws.
AS A WHOLE, the fraternities
have almost totally dominated all
extracurricular activities for 50
years. Anyone who is not in a
fraternity is virtually excluded
from any social life.
Until 1959, houses were selec
tive. For any sophomore who
didn’t get into a house, it was just
too bad. The present system,
which was introduced by a com
bined effort of students and ad
ministration, is called “Total Op
portunity.” Under this plan, any
sophomore who wishes to join a
house must be allowed to join.
If he does not get a bid, he must
be “picked up.” Until all sopho
mores are in. no one gets in.
Even with total opportunity,
the same problems that seem to
haunt any fraternity system have
remained. Houses were stratified
and typed and the three or four
“bad” houses, which lacked man
power, became ever weaker. Con
tact with freshmen has always
been limited and tends to be arti
ficial, since under the rushing
agreement, there could be no dis
cussion about houses with the
freshmen. At the same time, all
fraternity members are urged to
“go out and meet those fresh
men.” After a while it seemed
that the only goal of the house
was rushing. Freshmen were
judged not as people but as
names in a card file.
LATE IN May, 1961, at a secret
meeting sinisterly held at mid
night, a group of fraternity men
plotted to undermine the system,
which had annoyed a great num
ber of them. Most of the men
present were campus leaders,
whose opinions usually carry
quite a bit of weight.
The result of this meeting, and
several others held soon after
ward, was the “Grinnell petition,”
named after the movement’s
founder (who was, incidentally,
president of the “best” house on
campus and captain of the foot
ball team). About 50 fraternity
men signed the document, and it
was presented to the trustees.
In itself, the petition was fairly
moderate. It listed the fraternity
system’s shortcomings and pro
posed an alternative of adminis
tration assignment to “clubs.” At
the same time it reaffirmed the
value of living in small social
units.
DURING the 1961-62 school
year, a committee of nine con
servatively-oriented alumni and
two students, Grinnell and the
president of the college council,
heard testimony on all sides of
the question. Like most Williams
committees, it was very quiet. It
seemed that the fraternity issue
would die a natural death.

The final report, however, was
a shocker. The committee unani
mously reaffirmed the conclus
ions of the Grinned petition.

In essence, the small social
units will be retained. Fraterni
ties will be replaced by “houses.”
Freedom of choice to join any
units will still be open within
limits. However, the administra
tion will see to it that there is a
greater diversification of member
ship in each house. There will be

greater contact between units,
where in the past many fraterni
ties tended to withdraw from
campus life. Freshmen will not be
completely isolated from the rest
of the college.
I FAIL to see much reason for
the fears of Mr. Richards and Mr,
Weaver, who in their statements
to The Daily seem to feel that
Williams is depriving its students
of a complete education. The
same social facilities that have
made Williams renowned as the
best party school in the East will
be retained. The houses them
selves will be autonomous and
self-governing, with only mem
bership regulated by the college.
Student and alumni opinion is
currently very strong on both
sides of the issues. Although 77
per cent of all fraternity mem
bers signed a petition against the
new system, the figure is mis
leading. Many of the signers were
undoubtedly sophomores, who
had been in fraternities a week
when the petition was circulated
and who could not be completely
aware of the situation. As a mem
ber of a Williams fraternity I am
aware of the pressures that could
be exerted on these men, as
pledges, to follow house majori
ties.
Even in the face of mounting
pressure, Williams president John
E. Sawyer has made one thing
clear. The decision will be imple
mented in the near future, re
gardless of the dissent.
