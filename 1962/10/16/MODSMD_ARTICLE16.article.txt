Editor, The Daily:
Having been in the same over
seas group with Mr. Boushey, I
can affirm that most of his criti
cisms of the actual functioning of
the overseas program are real
and valid. Further, I agree that
spending six months abroad on
the Stanford Overseas Program
is not the best possible way of be
coming familiar with a foreign
cultui’e. Contrary to the implica
tion of his letter, however, I be
lieve the Stanford student can
familiarize himself with a signi
ficantly different culture, can ac
quire a degree of fluency in the
particular language, and does
meet the people of the particular
country.
I do not think it was the Uni
versity’s goal in setting up the
overseas program to make “Eu
ropean Scholars’’ out of Stanford
students. I think its idea, rather,
was to provide for the student the
opportunity to become acquainted
with a foreign culture 1) at a
cost approximately the same as
that of a Stanford education, and
2) with a full transfer of Stan
ford academic credit. I would
hardly call a parent “negligent”
who couldn’t afford to send his
child to four years of a Stanford
education plus another six
months or year stay in Europe.
Second, with regard to the value
of the courses studied, I think
Mr. Boushey’s examples, though
valid, were the exception and not
the rule.
All this is to say that abolition
of the program is certainly not
the realistic answer to some of
the functional problems of the
campuses. Perhaps Mr. Boushey,
in offering his criticism, is not
familiar with certain problems
the Overseas Office may have in
trying to improve the functional
part of the program. It is for this
reason that I feel that the policy
of criticism, followed by the de
sire to abolish the campuses, is
neither what the Overseas Office
needs nor wants. I strongly favor
thoughtful, organized, and above
all, constructive, interest on the
part of the student body in mat
ters such as the overseas pro
gram.

country.
I do not think it was the Uni
versity’s goal in setting up the
overseas program to make “Eu
ropean Scholars’’ out of Stanford
students. I think its idea, rather,
was to provide for the student the
opportunity to become acquainted
with a foreign culture 1) at a
cost approximately the same as
that of a Stanford education, and
2) with a full transfer of Stan
ford academic credit. I would
hardly call a parent “negligent”
who couldn’t afford to send his
child to four years of a Stanford
education plus another six
months or year stay in Europe.
Second, with regard to the value
of the courses studied, I think
Mr. Boushey’s examples, though
valid, were the exception and not
the rule.
All this is to say that abolition
of the program is certainly not
the realistic answer to some of
the functional problems of the
campuses. Perhaps Mr. Boushey,
in offering his criticism, is not
familiar with certain problems
the Overseas Office may have in
trying to improve the functional
part of the program. It is for this
reason that I feel that the policy
of criticism, followed by the de
sire to abolish the campuses, is
neither what the Overseas Office
needs nor wants. I strongly favor
thoughtful, organized, and above
all, constructive, interest on the
part of the student body in mat
ters such as the overseas pro
gram.

Editor, The Daily:
Having been in the same over
seas group with Mr. Boushey, I
can affirm that most of his criti
cisms of the actual functioning of
the overseas program are real
and valid. Further, I agree that
spending six months abroad on
the Stanford Overseas Program
is not the best possible way of be
coming familiar with a foreign
cultui’e. Contrary to the implica
tion of his letter, however, I be
lieve the Stanford student can
familiarize himself with a signi
ficantly different culture, can ac
quire a degree of fluency in the
particular language, and does
meet the people of the particular
country.
