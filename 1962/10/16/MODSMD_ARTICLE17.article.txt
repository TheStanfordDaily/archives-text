Editor, The Daily:
In reply to the letter written by
Mr. H. Bottshey Jr., I wish to
cite several salient points which
he, in his desire to abolish the
overseas campuses, either over
looked or deliberately suppressed.
It seems that he has not consid
ered the program in relation to
its stated objectives and the de
gree of their realization.
First to the obvious: the “de
fects” ho outlines are scarcely
“inherent” in the system. The ex
tent to which these “defects” af
fect a particular student is deter
mined largely by his own sensi
ble attitude toward Stanford
Abroad. Mr. Boushey’s quest for
total cultural immersion served
up on a silver platter in a six
months’ period is, at best, naive.
Stanford knows that such im
mersion is not possible and docs
not claim to effect a marvelous
transformation from provincial
ism to cosmopolitanism. Stanford
intends, rather, to expose one to
the existence of other viewpoints;
assimilation of these new ideas
stems directly from students’ in
itiative.
If one disregards eight hours
for sleeping, the contention that
students must spend “twelve or
thirteen hours a day” at the
study center is simply and blat
antly untrue. This statement
completely ignores the ample
travel time available (three-day
weekends and the three-week va
cation i and also the fact that
classes consume only four hours
a day.
His übiquitous remarks on the
degree of language preparation
display an utter lack of empathy
with the program’s objectives.
Other programs offer more in
tensive training for the linguistic
specialist, but Stanford, wishing
also to provide engineers, biolo
gists, et al the opportunity to be
come acquainted with European
life, cannot demand language
preparation sufficient to attend
a European university, if this en
gineer is to graduate on time —
one of Mr. Boushey’s overriding
obsessions. Furthermore, having
made the most difficult adjust
ments (linguistic and environmen
tal) at the study centers, a sig
nificant number of Stanford stu
dents remain abroad for further
study.
As a confirmd supporter of
Stanford Overseas, I am sorry to
hear that Mr. Boushey’s six
months’ sojourn at Tours was so
meaningless. I suspect, however,
that the fault does not lie with
the system. My experience has
been that the great majority of
students at Stanford Abroad are
motivated by a much more posi
tive and active approach and,
therefore, derive much more
benefit from the experience.

Editor, The Daily:
We are extremely pleased that
Mr. Boushey has realized “that
there are defects inherent in put
ting 80 American students to
gether in a foreign country.” We
ask, however, whether Mr. Bou
shey has failed to realize the op
portunities which are also inher
ent in the Stanford Overseas Pro
gram.
As past participants in the Stan
ford Overseas Program, we would
contend that the possibilities for
developing and broadening the in
dividual’s educational experience
are indeed numerous. Mr. Bou
shey found himself required to
be “in the center 12 or 13 hours a
day.” In fact, the student at an
overseas center has a good
amount of time to spend on his
own. He can spend it as he spends
time at Stanford in Palo Alto. He
can study when he feels it neces
sary. He can audit classes at the
local schools, where he may prac
tice to improve his language abil
ity.
The University in Tours offers
courses in French literature and
history, where familiarity with
French educational methods may
be gained. The Stanford student
may even make an acquaintance
with French students sharing his
academic interests.
Rather than rely on the over
seas center alone to force him to
use the language, the student can
get out and force himself to use
it. It may be “normal to spend
your time with people . . . who
have the same problems as you
do,” as Mr. Boushey suggests,
but the person who does only
what is normal, only what he is
easily able to do. is missing much
of what six months in Europe has
to offer.
Mr. Boushey should be aware
that an effort is being made to
offer courses at Stanford over
seas centers which are compati
ble with the European experience.
Art, literature, sociology and his
tory courses offered abroad are
oriented toward the experience of
being abroad.
Were one to conclude, as Mr.
Boushey, by calling for the aboli
tion of the overseas program,
then one must call for depriving
these students of “negligent par
ents” of the opportunity to study
abroad. Stanford University is not
offering a junior year abroad.
The University desires to offer a
program of educational experi
ence to undergraduates of varied
academic interests. It is a univer
sity’s function to help those who
are willing to help themselves.
Did you help yourself, Mr. Bou
shey?

for sleeping, the contention that
students must spend “twelve or
thirteen hours a day” at the
study center is simply and blat
antly untrue. This statement
completely ignores the ample
travel time available (three-day
weekends and the three-week va
cation i and also the fact that
classes consume only four hours
a day.
His übiquitous remarks on the
degree of language preparation
display an utter lack of empathy
with the program’s objectives.
Other programs offer more in
tensive training for the linguistic
specialist, but Stanford, wishing
also to provide engineers, biolo
gists, et al the opportunity to be
come acquainted with European
life, cannot demand language
preparation sufficient to attend
a European university, if this en
gineer is to graduate on time —
one of Mr. Boushey’s overriding
obsessions. Furthermore, having
made the most difficult adjust
ments (linguistic and environmen
tal) at the study centers, a sig
nificant number of Stanford stu
dents remain abroad for further
study.
As a confirmd supporter of
Stanford Overseas, I am sorry to
hear that Mr. Boushey’s six
months’ sojourn at Tours was so
meaningless. I suspect, however,
that the fault does not lie with
the system. My experience has
been that the great majority of
students at Stanford Abroad are
motivated by a much more posi
tive and active approach and,
therefore, derive much more
benefit from the experience.

We are extremely pleased that
Mr. Boushey has realized “that
there are defects inherent in put
ting 80 American students to
gether in a foreign country.” We
ask, however, whether Mr. Bou
shey has failed to realize the op
portunities which are also inher
ent in the Stanford Overseas Pro
gram.
As past participants in the Stan
ford Overseas Program, we would
contend that the possibilities for
developing and broadening the in
dividual’s educational experience
are indeed numerous. Mr. Bou
shey found himself required to
be “in the center 12 or 13 hours a
day.” In fact, the student at an
overseas center has a good
amount of time to spend on his
own. He can spend it as he spends
time at Stanford in Palo Alto. He
can study when he feels it neces
sary. He can audit classes at the
local schools, where he may prac
tice to improve his language abil
ity.
The University in Tours offers
courses in French literature and
history, where familiarity with
French educational methods may
be gained. The Stanford student
may even make an acquaintance
with French students sharing his
academic interests.
Rather than rely on the over
seas center alone to force him to
use the language, the student can
get out and force himself to use
it. It may be “normal to spend
your time with people . . . who
have the same problems as you
do,” as Mr. Boushey suggests,
but the person who does only
what is normal, only what he is
easily able to do. is missing much
of what six months in Europe has
to offer.
Mr. Boushey should be aware
that an effort is being made to
offer courses at Stanford over
seas centers which are compati
ble with the European experience.
Art, literature, sociology and his
tory courses offered abroad are
oriented toward the experience of
being abroad.
Were one to conclude, as Mr.
Boushey, by calling for the aboli
tion of the overseas program,
then one must call for depriving
these students of “negligent par
ents” of the opportunity to study
abroad. Stanford University is not
offering a junior year abroad.
The University desires to offer a
program of educational experi
ence to undergraduates of varied
academic interests. It is a univer
sity’s function to help those who
are willing to help themselves.
Did you help yourself, Mr. Bou
shey?

In reply to the letter written by
Mr. H. Bottshey Jr., I wish to
cite several salient points which
he, in his desire to abolish the
overseas campuses, either over
looked or deliberately suppressed.
It seems that he has not consid
ered the program in relation to
its stated objectives and the de
gree of their realization.
First to the obvious: the “de
fects” ho outlines are scarcely
“inherent” in the system. The ex
tent to which these “defects” af
fect a particular student is deter
mined largely by his own sensi
ble attitude toward Stanford
Abroad. Mr. Boushey’s quest for
total cultural immersion served
up on a silver platter in a six
months’ period is, at best, naive.
Stanford knows that such im
mersion is not possible and docs
not claim to effect a marvelous
transformation from provincial
ism to cosmopolitanism. Stanford
intends, rather, to expose one to
the existence of other viewpoints;
assimilation of these new ideas
stems directly from students’ in
itiative.

hear that Mr. Boushey’s six
months’ sojourn at Tours was so
meaningless. I suspect, however,
that the fault does not lie with
the system. My experience has
been that the great majority of
students at Stanford Abroad are
motivated by a much more posi
tive and active approach and,
therefore, derive much more
benefit from the experience.

Editor, The Daily:
We are extremely pleased that
Mr. Boushey has realized “that
there are defects inherent in put
ting 80 American students to
gether in a foreign country.” We
ask, however, whether Mr. Bou
shey has failed to realize the op
portunities which are also inher
ent in the Stanford Overseas Pro
gram.
As past participants in the Stan
ford Overseas Program, we would
contend that the possibilities for
developing and broadening the in
dividual’s educational experience
are indeed numerous. Mr. Bou
shey found himself required to
be “in the center 12 or 13 hours a
day.” In fact, the student at an
overseas center has a good
amount of time to spend on his
own. He can spend it as he spends
time at Stanford in Palo Alto. He
can study when he feels it neces
sary. He can audit classes at the
local schools, where he may prac
tice to improve his language abil
ity.
The University in Tours offers
courses in French literature and
history, where familiarity with
French educational methods may
be gained. The Stanford student
may even make an acquaintance
with French students sharing his
academic interests.
Rather than rely on the over
seas center alone to force him to
use the language, the student can
get out and force himself to use
it. It may be “normal to spend
your time with people . . . who
have the same problems as you
do,” as Mr. Boushey suggests,
but the person who does only
what is normal, only what he is
easily able to do. is missing much
of what six months in Europe has
to offer.
Mr. Boushey should be aware
that an effort is being made to
offer courses at Stanford over
seas centers which are compati
ble with the European experience.
Art, literature, sociology and his
tory courses offered abroad are
oriented toward the experience of
being abroad.
Were one to conclude, as Mr.
Boushey, by calling for the aboli
tion of the overseas program,
then one must call for depriving
these students of “negligent par
ents” of the opportunity to study
abroad. Stanford University is not
offering a junior year abroad.
The University desires to offer a
program of educational experi
ence to undergraduates of varied
academic interests. It is a univer
sity’s function to help those who
are willing to help themselves.
Did you help yourself, Mr. Bou
shey?

In reply to the letter written by
Mr. H. Bottshey Jr., I wish to
cite several salient points which
he, in his desire to abolish the
overseas campuses, either over
looked or deliberately suppressed.
It seems that he has not consid
ered the program in relation to
its stated objectives and the de
gree of their realization.
First to the obvious: the “de
fects” ho outlines are scarcely
“inherent” in the system. The ex
tent to which these “defects” af
fect a particular student is deter
mined largely by his own sensi
ble attitude toward Stanford
Abroad. Mr. Boushey’s quest for
total cultural immersion served
up on a silver platter in a six
months’ period is, at best, naive.
Stanford knows that such im
mersion is not possible and docs
not claim to effect a marvelous
transformation from provincial
ism to cosmopolitanism. Stanford
intends, rather, to expose one to
the existence of other viewpoints;
assimilation of these new ideas
stems directly from students’ in
itiative.
If one disregards eight hours
for sleeping, the contention that
students must spend “twelve or
thirteen hours a day” at the
study center is simply and blat
antly untrue. This statement
completely ignores the ample
travel time available (three-day
weekends and the three-week va
cation i and also the fact that
classes consume only four hours
a day.
His übiquitous remarks on the
degree of language preparation
display an utter lack of empathy
with the program’s objectives.
Other programs offer more in
tensive training for the linguistic
specialist, but Stanford, wishing
also to provide engineers, biolo
gists, et al the opportunity to be
come acquainted with European
life, cannot demand language
preparation sufficient to attend
a European university, if this en
gineer is to graduate on time —
one of Mr. Boushey’s overriding
obsessions. Furthermore, having
made the most difficult adjust
ments (linguistic and environmen
tal) at the study centers, a sig
nificant number of Stanford stu
dents remain abroad for further
study.
