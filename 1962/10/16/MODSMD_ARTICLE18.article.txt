# Water Polo Team's 6-0 Mark Paces SU Sports

By JIM DONOVAN
This weekend the undefeated
water polo team lengthened its
string to six in a row with wins
over California, Cerritos Junior
College, and the Air Force Acad
emy.
The biggest game of the week
end was against Cerritos, one of
the most powerful water polo
teams in southern California. On
Saturday morning Stanford de
feated them 5-3 in a close finish.
Cerritos scored first, but Marty
Hull, who scored 3 goals, tied the
game quickly with a shot from in
front of the cage. Before the first
quarter was over Ron Kovas had
put Stanford ahead to stay with
another inside shot. In the fourth
period, with Stanford ahead 4-3,
goalie George Stransky preserved
the winning margin, with a fan
tastic stop of a penalty shot
Coach Jim Gaughran said,

“This was the host we’ve played
so far. Our swimming and pass
ing was much better than in pre
vious games.”
I On Friday Stanford brushed
aside California 10-3. This is the
first time in nine years that the
Tribe has defeated UC in water
polo. Bill Lorton scored four
goals, Marty Hull three, Don
Buehler two and Ron Kovas one.
Stanford’s play was inconsistent,
the foi’wards missing easy shots,
but compensating by making
some difficult ones.
The Indians routed the Air
Force Academy 18-6 on Saturday
afternoon. The Academy has just
started to play inter-collegiate
water polo and was no match for
powerful Stanford. The Tribe
first string played but one quar
ter, the third, and in that quarter
netted nine goals, with Marty
Hull contributing four.

Stanford’s play was inconsistent,
the foi’wards missing easy shots,
but compensating by making
some difficult ones.
The Indians routed the Air
Force Academy 18-6 on Saturday
afternoon. The Academy has just
started to play inter-collegiate
water polo and was no match for
powerful Stanford. The Tribe
first string played but one quar
ter, the third, and in that quarter
netted nine goals, with Marty
Hull contributing four.
