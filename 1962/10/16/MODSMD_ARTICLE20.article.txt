On a rain-soaked field where
outfielders slid and ripped up di
vots and line drives stopped dead
on the second hop, the Giants
downed the Yankees 5-2, yester
day, to tie the World Series for
the third time. 3-3.
Billy Pierce, using all the re
sources of his agile fielders and
of spacious Candlestick Park,
pitched a complete game on three
hits for the first Series win of his
16-year career.
The four-day layoff since the
fifth game in New York evidently
revitalized the Giants’ hitting, for
Orlando Cepeda, completely im
potent in 12 previous at bats, col
lected three hits. He contributed
a double in the midst of a three
run fourth inning and drove in
another run in the fifth inning,
knocking out starter and loser
Whitey Ford at the same time.
