# Cal Team's Stay In Segregated Motel Sets off NC Protest
## 
### 
The admission of seven Negro
members of the University of
California football team to a pre
viously segregated motel in Dur
ham, North Carolina, resulted in
a demonstration last Thursday
night by members of a nearby
Negro college.
The demonstrators, students at
North Carolina College, claimed
that the motel would accept celeb
rities but not local Negroes.
GORDON CAREY, program di
rector for the Congress of Racial
Equality (CORE), flew to Dur
ham to organize a picket line
shortly before the Cal team ar
rived to play Duke University on
Saturday.
Cal's Daily Californian report
ed that the motel had been the
scene of several sit-ins earlier in
the year, and that last summer
the manager had announced that
the Cal team would be housed as
an experiment to test integration.
CAREY claimed that the man
ager had promised complete in
tegration after the team’s arrival.
Knowal Harden, motel manager,
denied this statement. “At no
time did I promise total integra
tion,” he said.

The trouble started Thursday
afternoon when two members of
the North Carolina College en
tered the motel dining room and
were removed. Twenty-five stu
dents later formed the picket line,
saying they considered the mo
tel’s acceptance of California Ne
groes “a ridicule of the North
Carolina Negroes.”
Blaine Newnham, the Daily
Cal’s sports editor, imported that
the team members seemed to
take no notice of the pickets, and
that the only other demonstration
occurred Friday afternoon when
the team returned from a light
workout in Duke stadium. He
said there was no trouble at the
game or at the Duke homecoming
ceremonies.

HARD FIN told Newnham that
there would be no integration in
the near future, for “economic
reasons.”
