# Stanford Outgrew Sororities After Fifty Years
## 
### CHRIS CHRISMAN 
For fifty years sororities played an im
portant part in the social and cultural life
at Stanford, and then were dissolved—-not
because of administrative disapproval, not
because of poor standards, not because of
suicides, but because they were passed up by
the University’s progress.
Sororities had existed on the campus al
most from the first. In the early years the
University welcomed the female Greek chap
ters which helped solve a serious housing
problem for Stanford women. Of the ten
houses which were chartered, nine thrived
until 1944.
BUT BY THIS time it became evident
that the sororities had passed their vogue.
Before 1933, when women’s enrollment w r as
limited to 500, there was ample room in the
nine sororities for almost everyone who
wanted to pledge. In the fall of that year the
quota on women was lifted and the enroll
ment of men students was rapidly dropping
due to the war. To maintain a working en
rollment during the war the number of
women increased until, in 1933, the women

outnumbered the men.
The favorable ratio, however, was the only
bright side of the situation. The sororities
had room for only 270 of the 1479 women
enrolled. Obviously this created extreme so
cial pressures, the effects of which were felt
throughout the university.
There were more daughters of sorority
alumni than the sororities could accommo
date and pressures were applied by the
mothers to get their daughters pledged.
Donations to the University were in peril.
Because the sororities attracted womer
of high leadership capabilities, the function
ing of many university organizations were
hampered by house monopoly of power or at
times a lack of good leadership resulting froi
non-competitive agreements within the
houses.
As the situation became worse the stu
dents began to express their concern in
The Daily. The sororities were called super
flous. The pledge system was described as
undemocratic. And it was said that too much
emphasis was put on the social rather than
the academic aspects of campus life.

TO ANSWER THE growing problem a
committee of Roble sponsors—including
sorority women and independents—proposed
the elimination of sororities. The nine sorori
ty presidents countered by volunteering to
correct some of the sources of dissatisfac
tion within the sororities.
The Board of Trustees responded by set
ting up a committee to study the situation
and hear arguments from all concerned.
After 14 months of study the Board recom
mended that the sororities be abolished as
soon as possible.
THE DECISION was announced April
26, 1944, by President Tresidder before a
packed Cubberley Auditorium in which
women were sitting in the aisles and on the
stage steps. When the President concluded,
the audience spontaneously broke into the
Stanford Hymn.
There was, in fact, only scattered disap
pointment with the solution. The sororities
promptly disbanded and the row houses
were re-named—-many of the names being
derived from the histories of the old so
rorities.

ing of many university organizations were
hampered by house monopoly of power or at
times a lack of good leadership resulting froi
non-competitive agreements within the
houses.
As the situation became worse the stu
dents began to express their concern in
The Daily. The sororities were called super
flous. The pledge system was described as
undemocratic. And it was said that too much
emphasis was put on the social rather than
the academic aspects of campus life.

TO ANSWER THE growing problem a
committee of Roble sponsors—including
sorority women and independents—proposed
the elimination of sororities. The nine sorori
ty presidents countered by volunteering to
correct some of the sources of dissatisfac
tion within the sororities.
The Board of Trustees responded by set
ting up a committee to study the situation
and hear arguments from all concerned.
After 14 months of study the Board recom
mended that the sororities be abolished as
soon as possible.
THE DECISION was announced April
26, 1944, by President Tresidder before a
packed Cubberley Auditorium in which
women were sitting in the aisles and on the
stage steps. When the President concluded,
the audience spontaneously broke into the
Stanford Hymn.
There was, in fact, only scattered disap
pointment with the solution. The sororities
promptly disbanded and the row houses
were re-named—-many of the names being
derived from the histories of the old so
rorities.
For fifty years sororities played an im
portant part in the social and cultural life
at Stanford, and then were dissolved—-not
because of administrative disapproval, not
because of poor standards, not because of
suicides, but because they were passed up by
the University’s progress.
Sororities had existed on the campus al
most from the first. In the early years the
University welcomed the female Greek chap
ters which helped solve a serious housing
problem for Stanford women. Of the ten
houses which were chartered, nine thrived
until 1944.
BUT BY THIS time it became evident
that the sororities had passed their vogue.
Before 1933, when women’s enrollment w r as
limited to 500, there was ample room in the
nine sororities for almost everyone who
wanted to pledge. In the fall of that year the
quota on women was lifted and the enroll
ment of men students was rapidly dropping
due to the war. To maintain a working en
rollment during the war the number of
women increased until, in 1933, the women

outnumbered the men.
The favorable ratio, however, was the only
bright side of the situation. The sororities
had room for only 270 of the 1479 women
enrolled. Obviously this created extreme so
cial pressures, the effects of which were felt
throughout the university.
There were more daughters of sorority
alumni than the sororities could accommo
date and pressures were applied by the
mothers to get their daughters pledged.
Donations to the University were in peril.
Because the sororities attracted womer
of high leadership capabilities, the function
ing of many university organizations were
hampered by house monopoly of power or at
times a lack of good leadership resulting froi
non-competitive agreements within the
houses.
