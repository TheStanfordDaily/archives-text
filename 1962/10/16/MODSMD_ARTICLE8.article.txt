# Cluster Residents Satisfied with New Fraternity Living System
## 
### PHIL DEGUERE 
Are fraternity men in favor of
the now clusters? The members
of the four houses now living in
‘he clusters express a favorable
attitude toward the new system.
The houses which have lived
in the clusters for a month are
Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Theta
Delta Chi. The members say that
the new system promotes a more
responsible and mature house
with a better balance between the
academic and social life.
THE COMPLAINTS about the
system come mainly from those
not yet connected with it. Peter
Jackson, Charles Hastings, and
Roger Rothenburger, all mem
bers of Theta Xi, said that the
University has “too much con
trol’’ over the affairs of the
houses since the buildings are
owned by the University. The
lack of chapter rooms and sleep
ing porches, the expensive hous
ing bills, and the over-all responsi
bility for maintenance and up
keep are considered undesirable.
“They’re all alike,” Rothen
burger said, and added that the
groat similarity of the cluster
houses to standard university
housing indicated that the end of
fraternities was near, since the
houses could easily be converted
to regular living groups.
“It’s just a wooden Wilbur
Hall!” one irate Theta Xi ex
claimed.
ALONG THE same lines, other
fraternity members complained
that they have no control over
decorations, that the members arc
split apart because the rooms are
on wings, and that the walls could
not be redecorated. The Kappa
Sigma cook said that the kitchen
had no working space.
But the opinions are different
within the cluster.
Rodger Voorhees, president of
the Phi Delts, said that the
change was on the whole a good
thing. He mentioned that the
soundproofed ceilings and spread
out rooms made studying far
more practical. Voorhees said
that the houses were “designed to
fulfill the more academic side,"
while achieving a good balance
between studies and social life.
VOORHEES DENIED the fact
that the University was exerting
pressure on the chapters. “They
have the right to come in and
make improvements,” he said,
and added that the members of
the fraternities couldn’t afford to
pay the taxes if they owned the
house. In general, most members
believed that they had a respon
sibility not only to the University,

but also to their alumni and to
future members to keep the
houses in good shape. The mem
bers agreed that the pride in the
new houses has been beneficial to
the fraternities.
No one interviewed in the clus
ters thought that the new sys
tem would kill the fraternities.
“If the fraternities die, it’s up to
them,” Voorhees said.
The Theta Delts even asserted
that the University was “going
out of their way to help us.” They
said that although there were
probably some people in the Uni

versify who wanted to abolish
fraternities, this was not Univer
sity policy.
ALL FOUR fraternities agreed
that the living quarters were
greatly improved and were well
worth the increase in bills. The
increased responsibilities, the
pride in the surroundings, and the
better studying facilities with no
loss in social life wore considered
to be the major advantages of
the clusters. The members of the
clusters thought that the frater
nities could only improve under
the new system.


THE OLD . . . The Alpha Delta Phi house, located on The Row, will
be demolished in the spring when the Alpha Delts move into the
fraternity clusters.


THE NEW . . . The clusters now house Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta
Theta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Theta Delta Chi.
