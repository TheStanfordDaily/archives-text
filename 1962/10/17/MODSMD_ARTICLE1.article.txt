# Baum Gives Two Theories Of Creation of Universe
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
There arc two different theories about the creation of the uni
verse accepted by different astronomers, said Dr. William A.
Banin, the director of the Mount Wilson and Palomar Observa
tories at last night’s Tuesday Evening Series lecture in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Using slides of various solar systems other than our

own, and different graphs, he first
explained the phenomenon of
“red .shift” of the different, star
clusters.
Ho explained that the apparent
shift was due to the Doppcler Ef
fect by which the wave length
given off by a celestial body, is
measured by a spectroscope,
which is indicative of the speed at
which the star or cluster of stars
is moving.

“Parts of the universe arc mov
ing away from the Earth,” he
stated, as he pointed out a slide
showing five spectrographs of
star clusters, each moving away
at a different velocity.
BAUM USED this definition of
the red shift to introduce the first
of two theories of the creation of
the universe. He continued, “In
the expanding universe theory, if
each part of the universe is mov
ing outward, then it is possible
to trace everything back to a cen
tral point. The universe must
have been very nearly together,
and if it was, it would have ex
ploded, sending pieces outward.
“Each piece would have coasted
out at speeds equal to how fast
it was going immediately after
the explosion, but would eventu
ally slow down. Also, the force of
gravity would tend to reduce the
speed. It is possible then, that the
pieces would start to fall back to
the center and the process would
repeat itself.”
The steady state theory, as ex
plained by Dr. Baum, is that the
universe has always been “pretty
much the same.” He added, “This
has been put forth by a group of
English scientists; perhaps they
hope there will always be an
England.”
USING other slides, Dr. Baum
demonstrated how our own solar
system would appear if we could
got far enough away to view it.
He set the distance for this view
at about several million light
years. He pointed out that, if far
enough away to view our solar
system, we could not see the sun
because it is too small in terms of
other stars of the system.
When questioned as to his per
sonal belief of the manner of the
creation of the universe, Baum
replied, “I haven’t any idea.”

the universe. He continued, “In
the expanding universe theory, if
each part of the universe is mov
ing outward, then it is possible
to trace everything back to a cen
tral point. The universe must
have been very nearly together,
and if it was, it would have ex
ploded, sending pieces outward.
“Each piece would have coasted
out at speeds equal to how fast
it was going immediately after
the explosion, but would eventu
ally slow down. Also, the force of
gravity would tend to reduce the
speed. It is possible then, that the
pieces would start to fall back to
the center and the process would
repeat itself.”
The steady state theory, as ex
plained by Dr. Baum, is that the
universe has always been “pretty
much the same.” He added, “This
has been put forth by a group of
English scientists; perhaps they
hope there will always be an
England.”
USING other slides, Dr. Baum
demonstrated how our own solar
system would appear if we could
got far enough away to view it.
He set the distance for this view
at about several million light
years. He pointed out that, if far
enough away to view our solar
system, we could not see the sun
because it is too small in terms of
other stars of the system.
When questioned as to his per
sonal belief of the manner of the
creation of the universe, Baum
replied, “I haven’t any idea.”

DR. WILLIAM BAUM, lost night's Tuesday Evening Speaker, dis
cussed the age and evolution of the universe.
There arc two different theories about the creation of the uni
verse accepted by different astronomers, said Dr. William A.
Banin, the director of the Mount Wilson and Palomar Observa
tories at last night’s Tuesday Evening Series lecture in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Using slides of various solar systems other than our

own, and different graphs, he first
explained the phenomenon of
“red .shift” of the different, star
clusters.
Ho explained that the apparent
shift was due to the Doppcler Ef
fect by which the wave length
given off by a celestial body, is
measured by a spectroscope,
which is indicative of the speed at
which the star or cluster of stars
is moving.

“Parts of the universe arc mov
ing away from the Earth,” he
stated, as he pointed out a slide
showing five spectrographs of
star clusters, each moving away
at a different velocity.
BAUM USED this definition of
the red shift to introduce the first
of two theories of the creation of
the universe. He continued, “In
the expanding universe theory, if
each part of the universe is mov
ing outward, then it is possible
to trace everything back to a cen
tral point. The universe must
have been very nearly together,
