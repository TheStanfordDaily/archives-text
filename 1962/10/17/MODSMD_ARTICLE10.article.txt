# Rally Poll Given
## 
### 
In a meeting of Rally Com last
night the results of a poll to de
termine the attitude of Stanford
students to Rally Com, card
stunts and segregation in the
rooting section were revealed.
The poll, taken by Rally Com di
rectors this week in campus liv
ing groups, showed that students
favored Rally Com 9:1, card
stunts 9:1 and continued segrega
tion at games 7:1.
Armin Rosencranz, student
body president, stated in a discus
sion during the meeting that,
“LASSU started with serious
questions about Rally Com and
its contribution to Stanford life.
The initiative taken by members
of Rally Com in seeking the views
of the campus indicates a positive
and constructive view to Stan
ford school spirit. It is an indi
cation not toward obscene yells,
but to enthusiasm for the school
whose greatness in the communi
ty is manifest. People attending
games question Stanford when
actions of students discredit it.”
