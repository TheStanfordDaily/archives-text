### MARY KAY BECKER 
A one-man show of paintings
and etchings by Karl Kasten is
being held now at the Lanyon
Gallery on the second floor of the
Old Stanford Barn. Kasten’s
work is a good example of fine
contemporary painting, toward
which the gallery in chiefly ori
ented.
Though abstract, his pictures
are well thought out; nothing in
them is accidental or put in just
as a stunt. The paintings stress
textural content, with all the ele
ments well-integrated.
KASTEN’S paintings include
three levels—color, space, and
visual texture. All of these levels
are represented in ‘Cinnabar,”
one of the finest works in the
show; it has subtle peripheral
fields integrating umbers, gray
greens, and browns, cut by planes
of color alternately warm and
cold, which gives one a strong
feeling of masculine force. In this
painting Mr. Kasten has built up
a series of levels of paint using
brush) and palette knife, produc
ing a striking contrast to the
bare areas of canvas and the in
serted pieces of cloth w'hich form
a collage.
“High Sea,” the largest paint

ing in the exhibit, has merit com
parable to its size. With his tre
mendous facility in the use of
color, Hasten incorporates an
idea of tumultuous energy.
On the whole, the exhibit
covers a wide range In personal
ity. One does not find repetitive
variations on the same theme;
there is a full range of textures
and colors. The show includes
Hasten canvases done since 1959;
most of them, however, are more
recent.
HAUL HASTEN is an Associ
ate Professor of Art at the Uni
versity of California, Berkeley.
He has exhibited extensively in
major west coast, national, and
international shows, including
the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
New York; the Chicago Art In
stitute of American Painting
(1960) and the International Bi
ennial, Sao Paulo (1955 and 1961).
His works are also in many collec
tions and he has won a total of
twenty prizes. The exhibit closes
October 30.
Besides the paintings on exhib
it, the gallery owns a stock of
paintings by such artists as Muhl,
| Sarthou, Übeda, Weisbuch, and
j Bernard Buffet. Paintings exhib-
I ited are for sale.

THIS PAINTING by Karl Kasten exhibits his technique of abundant
and bold brush strokes with extravagant use of dull colors.
A one-man show of paintings
and etchings by Karl Kasten is
being held now at the Lanyon
Gallery on the second floor of the
Old Stanford Barn. Kasten’s
work is a good example of fine
contemporary painting, toward
which the gallery in chiefly ori
ented.
Though abstract, his pictures
are well thought out; nothing in
them is accidental or put in just
as a stunt. The paintings stress
textural content, with all the ele
ments well-integrated.
KASTEN’S paintings include
three levels—color, space, and
visual texture. All of these levels
are represented in ‘Cinnabar,”
one of the finest works in the
show; it has subtle peripheral
fields integrating umbers, gray
greens, and browns, cut by planes
of color alternately warm and
cold, which gives one a strong
feeling of masculine force. In this
painting Mr. Kasten has built up
a series of levels of paint using
brush) and palette knife, produc
ing a striking contrast to the
bare areas of canvas and the in
serted pieces of cloth w'hich form
a collage.
“High Sea,” the largest paint

ing in the exhibit, has merit com
parable to its size. With his tre
mendous facility in the use of
color, Hasten incorporates an
idea of tumultuous energy.
On the whole, the exhibit
covers a wide range In personal
ity. One does not find repetitive
variations on the same theme;
there is a full range of textures
and colors. The show includes
Hasten canvases done since 1959;
most of them, however, are more
recent.
