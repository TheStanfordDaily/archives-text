# 'No' on Proposition 24
## 
### 
Assemblyman Louis Francis of San Mateo has given In's name
to a piece of anti-communist legislation that the electorate of Cali
fornia may vote into law on election day. The proposed legislation
is Proposition 24, or tin* Francis Anti-subversion Amendment. It
should be defeated.
Proposition 24 is a child of the McCarthy era when liberty was
unconstitutional and injustice irrelevant. Although the Senator is
dead, his children live on. Some of them are animate like General
Walker; others are inanimate and more dangerous than any inar
ticulate crackpot. Although anti-subversion fanatics mete out in
justice equally, there is a difference between McCarthy’s tech
nique and Assemblyman Francis’s technique-
If McCarthy’s victims claimed the right of refusing to testify
on the grounds oi self-incrimination, he could not try to ruin them
through due process of law. He could only rage and slander. If
California adopts Proposition 24, its victims will lose their means
to a livelihood,
Proposition 24 defines what a Communist organization is and
what a subversive organization is. Having accomplished this task,
it prohibits members of such organizations from holding public
office or from even retaining a job with a state agency. All one
need do is “advocate” a “subversive” doctrine to lose a job with
the state. Hut Proposition 24 is still more inclusive in <?ts prohibi
tions. Teachers in the public school system are forced to answer
inquiries by legislative committees into subversive activity. To in
voke the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution is to be fired.
If a teacher refuses to testify before a legally constituted
investigatory committee when the committee’s inquiry relates to
subversive activity, he will be presumed guilty of subversion and
fired. The intent ol the Francis Amendment is to persecute any
one who will not cooperate with communist witch-hunts regard
less of Constitutional provisions protecting civil liberties.
Both Governor Brown and Mr. Nixon have disclaimed Proposi
tion 24 and have urged the defeat of the Assemblyman’s legisla
tive aberration. Any other result would provide means for men as
irresponsible as Senator McCarthy to persecute as they please.
Proposition 24 would also provide well-meaning fools with the
opportunity to purge the state of men whose only crime is to
invoke the Constitution.

Proposition 24 would also provide well-meaning fools with the
opportunity to purge the state of men whose only crime is to
invoke the Constitution.
Assemblyman Louis Francis of San Mateo has given In's name
to a piece of anti-communist legislation that the electorate of Cali
fornia may vote into law on election day. The proposed legislation
is Proposition 24, or tin* Francis Anti-subversion Amendment. It
should be defeated.
Proposition 24 is a child of the McCarthy era when liberty was
unconstitutional and injustice irrelevant. Although the Senator is
dead, his children live on. Some of them are animate like General
Walker; others are inanimate and more dangerous than any inar
ticulate crackpot. Although anti-subversion fanatics mete out in
justice equally, there is a difference between McCarthy’s tech
nique and Assemblyman Francis’s technique-
If McCarthy’s victims claimed the right of refusing to testify
on the grounds oi self-incrimination, he could not try to ruin them
through due process of law. He could only rage and slander. If
California adopts Proposition 24, its victims will lose their means
to a livelihood,
Proposition 24 defines what a Communist organization is and
what a subversive organization is. Having accomplished this task,
it prohibits members of such organizations from holding public
office or from even retaining a job with a state agency. All one
need do is “advocate” a “subversive” doctrine to lose a job with
the state. Hut Proposition 24 is still more inclusive in <?ts prohibi
tions. Teachers in the public school system are forced to answer
inquiries by legislative committees into subversive activity. To in
voke the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution is to be fired.
If a teacher refuses to testify before a legally constituted
investigatory committee when the committee’s inquiry relates to
subversive activity, he will be presumed guilty of subversion and
fired. The intent ol the Francis Amendment is to persecute any
one who will not cooperate with communist witch-hunts regard
less of Constitutional provisions protecting civil liberties.
Both Governor Brown and Mr. Nixon have disclaimed Proposi
tion 24 and have urged the defeat of the Assemblyman’s legisla
tive aberration. Any other result would provide means for men as
irresponsible as Senator McCarthy to persecute as they please.
