# Letters to the Editor

### 
Editor, The Daily:
Because of references in last
Thursday’s Daily regarding the
new IFC rush policy and letters
in Friday’s Daily referring to our
position, we of Delta Kappa Epsi
lon feel it is necessary to write
this letter stating our real posi
tion. We feel that there has been
enough heating around the bush
about the effects of the new poli
cy, and that it is time to bring
out the real problems caused by
the action.
First, the new policy will bring
an increase in dirty rushing.
This increase will come about be
cause of open contact winter
quarter. Anyone who thinks that
once on-campus contact is started,
it can be limited to the campus, is
greatly mistaken. Disregarding
for the moment the obvious invi
tations to freshmen to fraternity
parties which will come, there
will also be innocent violations
when a house member and a
freshman want to go to a movie
or after studying decide to go
out for a break. Who is to decide
what is innocent and what isn’t?
More important and dangerous
than this, however, is the increase
which will come in “pocket pledg
ing.’’ If one house starts doing
this during winter quarter, all
houses will be forced to follow as
a defensive measure, and a house
which waits until spring quarter

to offer bids will miss the cream
of the crop. Any house that relies
on a collective vow from the fra
ternities not to violate this agree
ment is being ridiculously ideal
istic.
Of course, there will be one
benefit to all this—the expense of
formal rush will be almost elimi
nated, because every house will
have its pledge class before for
mal rush starts. The need for
these open houses will be elimi
nated.
Second, the lengthening of rush
from one week to eight will be a
disruptive factor to the fraterni
ties. There will be the constant
strain that always comes with
rush, and instead of planning its
winter quarter for the enjoyment
and benefit of its members, each
house will be forced to concen
trate on rushing alone. A major
part of fraternity life is the
friendships that ave made within
the house and the activities that
are carried on by the group, for
the group. A good deal of this at
mosphere will be changed by an
extra quarter of rushing.
Obviously, we find the new
rush proposal to be less than re
markable. We hope that in the
future a more appropriate solu
tion will be agreed upon.

Of course, there will be one
benefit to all this—the expense of
formal rush will be almost elimi
nated, because every house will
have its pledge class before for
mal rush starts. The need for
these open houses will be elimi
nated.
Second, the lengthening of rush
from one week to eight will be a
disruptive factor to the fraterni
ties. There will be the constant
strain that always comes with
rush, and instead of planning its
winter quarter for the enjoyment
and benefit of its members, each
house will be forced to concen
trate on rushing alone. A major
part of fraternity life is the
friendships that ave made within
the house and the activities that
are carried on by the group, for
the group. A good deal of this at
mosphere will be changed by an
extra quarter of rushing.
Obviously, we find the new
rush proposal to be less than re
markable. We hope that in the
future a more appropriate solu
tion will be agreed upon.

Because of references in last
Thursday’s Daily regarding the
new IFC rush policy and letters
in Friday’s Daily referring to our
position, we of Delta Kappa Epsi
lon feel it is necessary to write
this letter stating our real posi
tion. We feel that there has been
enough heating around the bush
about the effects of the new poli
cy, and that it is time to bring
out the real problems caused by
the action.
First, the new policy will bring
an increase in dirty rushing.
This increase will come about be
cause of open contact winter
quarter. Anyone who thinks that
once on-campus contact is started,
it can be limited to the campus, is
greatly mistaken. Disregarding
for the moment the obvious invi
tations to freshmen to fraternity
parties which will come, there
will also be innocent violations
when a house member and a
freshman want to go to a movie
or after studying decide to go
out for a break. Who is to decide
what is innocent and what isn’t?
More important and dangerous
than this, however, is the increase
which will come in “pocket pledg
ing.’’ If one house starts doing
this during winter quarter, all
houses will be forced to follow as
a defensive measure, and a house
which waits until spring quarter

to offer bids will miss the cream
of the crop. Any house that relies
on a collective vow from the fra
ternities not to violate this agree
ment is being ridiculously ideal
istic.
Of course, there will be one
benefit to all this—the expense of
formal rush will be almost elimi
nated, because every house will
have its pledge class before for
mal rush starts. The need for
these open houses will be elimi
nated.
