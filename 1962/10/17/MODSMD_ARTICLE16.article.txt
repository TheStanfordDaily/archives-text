## Soviet Assent Required To Resume Negotiations 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Following the German Foreign
Minister, Dr. Schroeder, who is
in Washington this week, Chan
cellor Adenauer will come on the
day after our elections. That is
the day when, so Mr. Khrushchev
has told us, the pause will end,
and he will thereafter reopen ac
tively the Berlin question. While
we do not know just what or how
he will do this, it is prudent to
expect some action designed to
affect the status quo in West
Berlin.
Thus Dr. Adenauer and Presi
dent Kennedy have important

business to talk
about. Secretary
Rusk’s conversa
tions with the
Soviet govern
ment, which
have been going
on for more than
a year, have
been stalled
since last spring.
Until then we

are both talking about possible
arrangements, such as a proposed
international authority for man
aging access to West Berlin,
which would make the continued
presence of Western troops ac
ceptable to the Soviet Union.
Western access and the pres
ence of Western troops are the
crucial positions from which we
cannot and will not recede. There
should be no misunderstanding
about this in the Kremlin. Presi
dent Kennedy cannot surrender
Berlin even if he were the kind of
man who wanted to. A surrender
would destroy him. Access and
presence are not negotiable. It is
the fringe problems, which in
clude the dlgree of recognition
given the East German state, that
are negotiable.
The U.S.-U.S.S.R. conversations
did not have the blessing of the
German Chancellor and of Gen.
de Gaulle. Nevertheless they went
on. About the month of May,
something happened in Moscow
which caused the Russians to
brush aside the talks and to in
sist that the Western powers re
move their troops from Berlin.
As this is not a negotiable ques
tion for us, the discussions have
been stalled.
The question is whether they
can be resumed That depends on
the Soviet government. If they
continue to insist that the only
question is Western military
withdrawal from Berlin, there
will be a showdown. If they wish
to negotiate about an arrange
ment which guarantees presence
and access, the door will open
wider and wider for larger ex
plorations.
THERE IS as yet, we must re
alize. no firm agreement between
Washington and Bonn on either
of the two great alternatives—a
showdown or a negotiation.
While high officials and experts
of the Western allies have drawn
up comprehensive plans for deal
ing with the various possible ac
tions by the Soviet government
and the East Germans, these are
as yet only plans. They are not
the decisions of governments. It
is true, as Mr. Alsop was the first
to point out the other day, that
we do not mean to wait for a
unanimous decision by the Brit
ish, French, German, and Ameri
can governments. We shall act if
there is a showdown provided we
can count upon West German co
operation.
But that cooperation is essen
tial to any kind of response which
is short of nuclear war. If there
is to be a military response to in
terference with Western access or
Western presence, the German
Federal Republic in Bonn cannot
sit on the sidelines and go on do
ing business as usual with East
Germany. The Germans have by
far the biggest stake in Berlin.
It is their country which will suf
fer the first consequences of a
conflict. It is overwhelmingly

their trade which will be cut off
if (here are blockades and coun
ter-blockades.

IT IS necessary for Bonn and
Washington to come down to
brass tacks on the subject of how r
to negotiate if by standing firm
- we bring about a resumption of
negotiations with the Soviet Un
ion. We must realize that we
stood firm and we prevailed
against the blockade of West Ber -
lin in 1948. But, while that stand
succeeded in deferring the crisis,
no such showdown can solve the
Berlin problem. When the show
down comes, and if we prevail,
West Berlin will still be half of
a vulnerable city deep inside the
Soviet empire.
If the situation of West Berlin
is not stabilized as the cold war
and the race of armaments be
come more intense, Berlin will be
come increasingly a supreme dan
ger point for the outbreak of a
thermonuclear war. Despite the
external prosperity, which is
highly subsidized, of West Ber
lin, there are ominous signs that
the constituted authorities. Ger
man and Allied alike, may be los
ing control of the crowd. The
Berlin wall, we must remember,
is manned on both sides by Ger
mans, and there are in this situa
tion the makings of a civil war
into which we might all be sucked
against our will.
Those who tell us to stand firm,
to rebuff the Russians, and then
do nothing, are playing with fire.
We must hope that the Chancel
lor is as much aware of this as
are an increasing number of his
countrymen.

on. About the month of May,
something happened in Moscow
which caused the Russians to
brush aside the talks and to in
sist that the Western powers re
move their troops from Berlin.
As this is not a negotiable ques
tion for us, the discussions have
been stalled.
The question is whether they
can be resumed That depends on
the Soviet government. If they
continue to insist that the only
question is Western military
withdrawal from Berlin, there
will be a showdown. If they wish
to negotiate about an arrange
ment which guarantees presence
and access, the door will open
wider and wider for larger ex
plorations.
THERE IS as yet, we must re
alize. no firm agreement between
Washington and Bonn on either
of the two great alternatives—a
showdown or a negotiation.
While high officials and experts
of the Western allies have drawn
up comprehensive plans for deal
ing with the various possible ac
tions by the Soviet government
and the East Germans, these are
as yet only plans. They are not
the decisions of governments. It
is true, as Mr. Alsop was the first
to point out the other day, that
we do not mean to wait for a
unanimous decision by the Brit
ish, French, German, and Ameri
can governments. We shall act if
there is a showdown provided we
can count upon West German co
operation.
But that cooperation is essen
tial to any kind of response which
is short of nuclear war. If there
is to be a military response to in
terference with Western access or
Western presence, the German
Federal Republic in Bonn cannot
sit on the sidelines and go on do
ing business as usual with East
Germany. The Germans have by
far the biggest stake in Berlin.
It is their country which will suf
fer the first consequences of a
conflict. It is overwhelmingly

their trade which will be cut off
if (here are blockades and coun
ter-blockades.

IT IS necessary for Bonn and
Washington to come down to
brass tacks on the subject of how r
to negotiate if by standing firm
- we bring about a resumption of
negotiations with the Soviet Un
ion. We must realize that we
stood firm and we prevailed
against the blockade of West Ber -
lin in 1948. But, while that stand
succeeded in deferring the crisis,
no such showdown can solve the
Berlin problem. When the show
down comes, and if we prevail,
West Berlin will still be half of
a vulnerable city deep inside the
Soviet empire.
If the situation of West Berlin
is not stabilized as the cold war
and the race of armaments be
come more intense, Berlin will be
come increasingly a supreme dan
ger point for the outbreak of a
thermonuclear war. Despite the
external prosperity, which is
highly subsidized, of West Ber
lin, there are ominous signs that
the constituted authorities. Ger
man and Allied alike, may be los
ing control of the crowd. The
Berlin wall, we must remember,
is manned on both sides by Ger
mans, and there are in this situa
tion the makings of a civil war
into which we might all be sucked
against our will.
Those who tell us to stand firm,
to rebuff the Russians, and then
do nothing, are playing with fire.
We must hope that the Chancel
lor is as much aware of this as
are an increasing number of his
countrymen.

Following the German Foreign
Minister, Dr. Schroeder, who is
in Washington this week, Chan
cellor Adenauer will come on the
day after our elections. That is
the day when, so Mr. Khrushchev
has told us, the pause will end,
and he will thereafter reopen ac
tively the Berlin question. While
we do not know just what or how
he will do this, it is prudent to
expect some action designed to
affect the status quo in West
Berlin.
Thus Dr. Adenauer and Presi
dent Kennedy have important

business to talk
about. Secretary
Rusk’s conversa
tions with the
Soviet govern
ment, which
have been going
on for more than
a year, have
been stalled
since last spring.
Until then we

are both talking about possible
arrangements, such as a proposed
international authority for man
aging access to West Berlin,
which would make the continued
presence of Western troops ac
ceptable to the Soviet Union.
Western access and the pres
ence of Western troops are the
crucial positions from which we
cannot and will not recede. There
should be no misunderstanding
about this in the Kremlin. Presi
dent Kennedy cannot surrender
Berlin even if he were the kind of
man who wanted to. A surrender
would destroy him. Access and
presence are not negotiable. It is
the fringe problems, which in
clude the dlgree of recognition
given the East German state, that
are negotiable.
The U.S.-U.S.S.R. conversations
did not have the blessing of the
German Chancellor and of Gen.
de Gaulle. Nevertheless they went

far the biggest stake in Berlin.
It is their country which will suf
fer the first consequences of a
conflict. It is overwhelmingly

their trade which will be cut off
if (here are blockades and coun
ter-blockades.

IT IS necessary for Bonn and
Washington to come down to
brass tacks on the subject of how r
to negotiate if by standing firm
- we bring about a resumption of
negotiations with the Soviet Un
ion. We must realize that we
stood firm and we prevailed
against the blockade of West Ber -
lin in 1948. But, while that stand
succeeded in deferring the crisis,
no such showdown can solve the
Berlin problem. When the show
down comes, and if we prevail,
West Berlin will still be half of
a vulnerable city deep inside the
Soviet empire.
If the situation of West Berlin
is not stabilized as the cold war
and the race of armaments be
come more intense, Berlin will be
come increasingly a supreme dan
ger point for the outbreak of a
thermonuclear war. Despite the
external prosperity, which is
highly subsidized, of West Ber
lin, there are ominous signs that
the constituted authorities. Ger
man and Allied alike, may be los
ing control of the crowd. The
Berlin wall, we must remember,
is manned on both sides by Ger
mans, and there are in this situa
tion the makings of a civil war
into which we might all be sucked
against our will.
Those who tell us to stand firm,
to rebuff the Russians, and then
do nothing, are playing with fire.
We must hope that the Chancel
lor is as much aware of this as
are an increasing number of his
countrymen.

Following the German Foreign
Minister, Dr. Schroeder, who is
in Washington this week, Chan
cellor Adenauer will come on the
day after our elections. That is
the day when, so Mr. Khrushchev
has told us, the pause will end,
and he will thereafter reopen ac
tively the Berlin question. While
we do not know just what or how
he will do this, it is prudent to
expect some action designed to
affect the status quo in West
Berlin.
Thus Dr. Adenauer and Presi
dent Kennedy have important

business to talk
about. Secretary
Rusk’s conversa
tions with the
Soviet govern
ment, which
have been going
on for more than
a year, have
been stalled
since last spring.
Until then we

are both talking about possible
arrangements, such as a proposed
international authority for man
aging access to West Berlin,
which would make the continued
presence of Western troops ac
ceptable to the Soviet Union.
Western access and the pres
ence of Western troops are the
crucial positions from which we
cannot and will not recede. There
should be no misunderstanding
about this in the Kremlin. Presi
dent Kennedy cannot surrender
Berlin even if he were the kind of
man who wanted to. A surrender
would destroy him. Access and
presence are not negotiable. It is
the fringe problems, which in
clude the dlgree of recognition
given the East German state, that
are negotiable.
The U.S.-U.S.S.R. conversations
did not have the blessing of the
German Chancellor and of Gen.
de Gaulle. Nevertheless they went
on. About the month of May,
something happened in Moscow
which caused the Russians to
brush aside the talks and to in
sist that the Western powers re
move their troops from Berlin.
As this is not a negotiable ques
tion for us, the discussions have
been stalled.
The question is whether they
can be resumed That depends on
the Soviet government. If they
continue to insist that the only
question is Western military
withdrawal from Berlin, there
will be a showdown. If they wish
to negotiate about an arrange
ment which guarantees presence
and access, the door will open
wider and wider for larger ex
plorations.
THERE IS as yet, we must re
alize. no firm agreement between
Washington and Bonn on either
of the two great alternatives—a
showdown or a negotiation.
While high officials and experts
of the Western allies have drawn
up comprehensive plans for deal
ing with the various possible ac
tions by the Soviet government
and the East Germans, these are
as yet only plans. They are not
the decisions of governments. It
is true, as Mr. Alsop was the first
to point out the other day, that
we do not mean to wait for a
unanimous decision by the Brit
ish, French, German, and Ameri
can governments. We shall act if
there is a showdown provided we
can count upon West German co
operation.
But that cooperation is essen
tial to any kind of response which
is short of nuclear war. If there
is to be a military response to in
terference with Western access or
Western presence, the German
Federal Republic in Bonn cannot
sit on the sidelines and go on do
ing business as usual with East
Germany. The Germans have by
far the biggest stake in Berlin.
It is their country which will suf
fer the first consequences of a

their trade which will be cut off
