Editor, The Dully;
As members of what we feel to
be the vocal majority, we would
like to protest the Legislature’s
decision and the Daily’s stand on
integration of the student rooting
section at football games.
There is first the question (a
major one) of whether LASSU
has the right to take this decision
upon themselves without the stu
dents’ agreement. Are they per
haps afraid a referendum will
again be defeated?
Secondly, presuming the Legis
lature has its way, what measures
could be used to enforce this rul
ing? We could hardly picture an
arbitrary boy-girl-boy-girl seating
arrangement. Groups would con
gregate as they have previously.
We really doubt that the men
would then “behave themselves”
any more than now-on the con
trary, their "behavior” would be
all the more apparent to the wom
en, who are now, at least, com
paratively detached from it all.
There is less inhibition of en
thusiasm, spirit, and group feel
ing with the current arrangement
than there would be with that
proposed. From the woman’s
standpoint—no woman can feel
totally at ease cheering wildly in
the midst of a group of men. Fur
thermore, with enforced integra
tion, social pressure would arise
to the point where students might
feel uncomfortable without a
date, and a football game is one
of the few really stag functions
remaining.
To conclude—the choice is al
ready available. Men or women
who wish to sit within an inte
grated area are free to do so.
With as much seating choice as
we now have, is all this fuss
really necessary?
