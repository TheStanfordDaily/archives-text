# STAFF OPINION
## New Constitution To Rectify Flaws Of Predecessor 
### RICK SEIFERT 
The proposed constitution is
the inevitable successor of a doc
ument proposed and defeated last
Spring quarter. Although the
forces of reaction against that
earlier work were founded upon I
more fiction than fact, they were j
entirely successful in achieving j
their purpose.
Nonet heless, the great inade-1
quacies of the present constitu \
tion were at that time brought to i
light and, despite last spring’s de S
feat or perhaps more because of!
it, a superior document has once i
again been placed before the
Stanford voting community.
Although the newest proposal j
espouses the same improvements |
as did last May’s document, the
more flagrant flaws of the latter
work have been either omitted or
satisfactorily reworked.
• Information concerning the
constitution is being distributed {
a full five weeks in advance of j
election week. All living groups j
and organizations are being sup |
plied with copies well in advance, j
and the drafters are welcoming I
criticism in order that necessary
changes may be made before put
ting the document to a vote. Ob
jections to the phrasing of the
section entitled “Powers of the
President” have already brought
a rewording. The original version
unintentionally implied that the
President would be empowered
to “appoint the chairman and
members of all committees,
boards and commissions . . Re
cently appended to this section is
the phrase “unless otherwise pro
vided for in this constitution or
its by-laws.”
• The threat of over-represen
tation among graduate students
has been eliminated by debarring
the mass proxy vote and by cre
ating two voting classifications
for off-campus students, namely j
graduate and undergraduate.
• The Judiciary has been en- ;
tirely reworked to please every-1
one from the President of IFC |
to Prince Light-foot. The fraterni
ties, under the new constitution,
would keep their much cherished
Inter-Fraternity judicial council
and all its powers. Moreover,
Men and Women’s Council mem
bers shall attain their offices by
appointment, rather than by j
blind and ineffective elective pro
cess. Legislature shall submit a
list of nominees who have been
selected by that body, and from
that list the President of the
ASSU shall appoint the Judicial
Council members.
• The rather superfluous
“rights and responsibilities” sec
tion of the earlier reform docu
ment have been removed.
• There is no unwieldy pro-1
vision for student committees [
paralleling those of the Univer- j
sity administration.
In addition to being more pal- j
atable, than its predecessor, the ]
new constitution has removed the
inadequacies of the present docu- {
ment. Legislature will no longer
house quasi-big frogs in a now
diminutive puddle. To make the
Legislature more representative
and thereby increase its influ
ence, its membership will be in
creased five-fold. Moreover the
inconsistencies of the judiciary
will be eliminated by making
membership in that branch of
government appointive. Finally,
organizations desiring to meet on
campus will be required only to
file a statement with the ASSU
stating the purpose of their or
ganization, disclaiming any right
to speak for the University as a
whole, and pledging to abide by
the Fundamental Standard. No
longer-wili the “Stanford Young
Subversives” be forced to display
LASSU’s stamp of approval.

• The threat of over-represen
tation among graduate students
has been eliminated by debarring
the mass proxy vote and by cre
ating two voting classifications
for off-campus students, namely j
graduate and undergraduate.
• The Judiciary has been en- ;
tirely reworked to please every-1
one from the President of IFC |
to Prince Light-foot. The fraterni
ties, under the new constitution,
would keep their much cherished
Inter-Fraternity judicial council
and all its powers. Moreover,
Men and Women’s Council mem
bers shall attain their offices by
appointment, rather than by j
blind and ineffective elective pro
cess. Legislature shall submit a
list of nominees who have been
selected by that body, and from
that list the President of the
ASSU shall appoint the Judicial
Council members.
• The rather superfluous
“rights and responsibilities” sec
tion of the earlier reform docu
ment have been removed.
• There is no unwieldy pro-1
vision for student committees [
paralleling those of the Univer- j
sity administration.
In addition to being more pal- j
atable, than its predecessor, the ]
new constitution has removed the
inadequacies of the present docu- {
ment. Legislature will no longer
house quasi-big frogs in a now
diminutive puddle. To make the
Legislature more representative
and thereby increase its influ
ence, its membership will be in
creased five-fold. Moreover the
inconsistencies of the judiciary
will be eliminated by making
membership in that branch of
government appointive. Finally,
organizations desiring to meet on
campus will be required only to
file a statement with the ASSU
stating the purpose of their or
ganization, disclaiming any right
to speak for the University as a
whole, and pledging to abide by
the Fundamental Standard. No
longer-wili the “Stanford Young
Subversives” be forced to display
LASSU’s stamp of approval.
The proposed constitution is
the inevitable successor of a doc
ument proposed and defeated last
Spring quarter. Although the
forces of reaction against that
earlier work were founded upon I
more fiction than fact, they were j
entirely successful in achieving j
their purpose.
Nonet heless, the great inade-1
quacies of the present constitu \
tion were at that time brought to i
light and, despite last spring’s de S
feat or perhaps more because of!
it, a superior document has once i
again been placed before the
Stanford voting community.
Although the newest proposal j
espouses the same improvements |
as did last May’s document, the
more flagrant flaws of the latter
work have been either omitted or
satisfactorily reworked.
