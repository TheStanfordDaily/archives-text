Editor, The Daily:
Let the Stanford campus wel
come Dr. Robert McAfee Brown,
and hope that the spirit of his
sermon last Sunday be reechoed
often from the Memorial Church
pulpit and throughout the cam
pus this year. Reverend Brown
discussed a timely topic, the ecu
menical council and its relevance
to the Protestant world, in clear,
well-reasoned terms. He preached
forcefully a Christianity which
tackles the most troublesome so
cial ills of our lime, citing a chal
lenge to action and witness. He
leveled his remarks directly at
the university community, did
not dodge the studentsâ€™ doubts
and hesitations and seemed to
presuppose only their concern.
He was open and frank in dis
cussing the Protestant church.
Most importantly, Professor
Brown demonstrated that a union
of religious tradition with a criti
cal search for knowledge is com
pletely possible. Such a union and
such an immediate Christian con
cern for action should challenge
the student comunity. If sustain
ed. this approach could not fail to
make Memorial Church a vital
campus force, both spiritually
and intellectually,
