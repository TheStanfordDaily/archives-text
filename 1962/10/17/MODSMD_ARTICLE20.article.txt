Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Walsh has characterized
the goals and values of the ASSU
President as being “considerably
unrealistic, grossly irresponsible,

and alarmingly naive.” Since he
has cast his stones rather widely,
I think it proper to ask him pub
licly to look and see where they
have landed.
It is naive, he maintains, for
students to participate in high
level policy making. Perhaps he
is unaware that five students
have recently been chosen by Dr.
Sterling from a list submitted by
ASSU President Rosencranz to
sit on the President’s Student Af
fairs Committee. Obviously, all
administrative decisions taken at
this university are beneath Dr,
Sterling’s purview. The commit
tees which advise him on topics
pertinent to undergraduate life,
however, (Undergraduate Educa
tion, Student Affairs, Housing)
can surely profit by hearing the
student viewpoint. Mr. Walsh has
attempted to portray this sugges
tion to open channels of commu
nication as a power grab. The phi
losophy department has a term
for such portrayals, Mr. Walsh.
It’s called setting up a straw
man.

Mr. Walsh also sees fit to vent
his spleen on “complete academic
freedom.” This insidious idea, he
asserts, “opens the door to all
kinds of irresponsibility” Univer
sities should, he contends, rather
be the guardians of “responsible
thought.” You can probably feel
the next one coming. Who defines
“responsible,” Mr. Walsh? Gus
Hall spoke here last spring, and
the decision by the public exer
cises committee to let him speak
was not taken unanimously.
Clearly there are some who don’t
consider communists “responsi
ble” enough to be heard. Others
have said that Norman Thomas,
Hubert Humphrey, John Ken
nedy, and Dwight Eisenhower are
equally as “irresponsible.” It
seems fair to me to say that any
one who does not commit libel or
slander or incite immediate vio
lence is worthy of a hearing. Why
don’t you consult some of the fac
ulty on this question?
The question of partisan politi
cal activity on campus is perhaps
the most important one you raise,
for here there is indeed disagree
ment. The advisability of having
such a ban on campus is a fertile

field for inquiry, but even ignor
ing that question for the time be
ing, students can surely raise the
question of what is partisan and
what is not. You seem to feel cer
tain that “Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford wished to assure that the
campus platform would always
be used to inform, and not to con
vert.” Surely you’re not serious,
Mr. Walsh. According to your def
inition. every lime a professor or
a visiting speaker seeks to be per
suasive from the rostrum, ho is
violating the founding grant. The
university’s interpretation of par
tisan activity is somewhat looser
than yours, albeit a little tighter
than I would construe from Web
ster. It seems to me that partisan
activity should have at least some
thing to do with parties.
One can disagree politely with
the major part of your letter, but
the closing paragraphs provoke a
somewhat sterner response. Per
haps the most pertinent and
pressing challenge contained
within Mr. Rosencranz’s four
freedoms is the one which ex
horts us to "emerge from our
apathy and lethargy” To Mr. Ro
sencranz’s simple statement that
the problems of students in
emerging African nations often
takes a back seat to our drinking,
dating, and parties, you cry,
“Such irresponsible generalities
are hardly worthy of comment.
One should question their validity
as well as anyone’s right to make
them.” Piffle, Mr. Walsh. Piffle.

Editor, The Daily:
I have before me the attack
written by Mike Walsh on the
words of Armin Rosencranz. This
attack (printed Oct. 15) states
that Mr. Rosencranz was “consid
erably unrealistic, grossly irre
sponsible, and alarmingly naive.”
While I should not like to take is
sue with Mr. Walsh concerning
Mr. Rosencranz, I would like to
discuss Mr. Walsh’s letter. I don’t
understand it.
Mr. Walsh begins by stating
that Mr. Rosencranz’s “four free
doms” ought to evoke “indignant
responses.” That seems clear
enough (although aside from
Mr. Walsh I have hoard few such
responses). However, I find my
self at a loss to know why I am to
feel this “indignant response' or
for that matter, against whom.
Mr. Rosencranz? Mr. Rosen
cranz’s words? Mr. Walsh? I
don’t understand.
Mr. Rosencranz is then said to
have opened the doors to irre
sponsibility. How? 1 was unable
to tell because Mr. Walsh quickly
asks several provocative, if seem
ingly irrelevant questions (i.e.
who will do the staff work . . . )
and concludes by implying that
E. P. Morgan and Dean Rhine
lander ought not speak on cam
pus at the same hour.
Mr. Rosencranz is then accused
(in suggesting partisan political
activity on campus) of ignoring
the “logic of the situation.” Is
the situation logical? More im
portant is Mr. Walsh being “logi
cal”? (Ho concludes that since the
founders inserted a prohibitory
clause then partisan politics is
wrong).
Lastly, Mr. Rosencranz is ac
cused of dealing in “irresponsible
generalities,” which are hardly
worth comment (this in the third
column of Mr. Walsh’s reply).
“In short,” Mr. Walsh continues,
j "The strength of our nation . .
j Who raised that issue? If Mr.
I Rosencranz did. then Mr. Walsh
! it would appear, ought have said
so.
We are then (after lastly) ad
vised to tend to “the immediate
i business at hand.” What is this
“immediate business at hand?”
It is never defined. Rather it is
self evident . . . perhaps to Mr.
Walsh, certainly not to me.
Mr. Rosencranz would have us
“run the University while saving
both our generation and the
world” (I must assume that that
is in opposition to saving our
generation while losing the
world) while getting an educa
tion. This, Mr. Walsh concludes,
is ridiculous. He is probably
right. I’m not sure. Either I sim
ply don’t understand Mr. Walsh,
or he is an irresponsible person
who has made a great deal of
noise and not really said anything
meaningful.
