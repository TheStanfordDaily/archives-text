# TERRY BLANKS GIANTS
## Bombers Win as Predicted, 1-0 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
In (he big game, Ralph Terry
shoved the Giants’ hilling back
into the hole where it had been
hibernating before Monday, and
won the World Series for the
Yankees, 1-0. Nevertheless San
Francisco came within a couple
of feet of being champs when
Willie MeCovey lined out with the

winning run in scoring position
for the last out.
In a Series where outstanding
pitching had become a habit by
the seventh game, Terry turned
in the most impressive perform
ance, not only because of the im
portance of the game, but because
of the complete mastery he had
in choosing and throwing his
pitches. He retired the first 17
batters, gave up but four hits,
did not walk a man, and gave his
fielders easy pop fly chances for
almost eighty per cent of the

Giant outs.
IN WINNING his second
straight World Series and New
York’s tenth in 15 years, manager
Ralph Houk showed the most con
fidence possible in Terry by leav
ing him in, in a ninth inning sit
uation which could easily have
brought victory to San Francisco.
With Matty Alou, who had bunted,
at third, and Willie Mays, who had
doubled Alou around, at second,
more conservative minds would
have brought in the Yankees’ ace
lefty, Whitey Ford, to pitch to the
left handed McCovey (who hit .111
last year against lefthanders), or
would have at least ordered Mc-
Covey intentionally walked. But
Houk stuck with Terry and second
baseman Bobby Richardson did
the rest, catching a sharp line
drive a few inches off the ground.
That wasn’t the only key field
ing play by the Yanks. With one
out in the seventh, Tom Tresh
sprinted to the left field corner
and made a lunging catch of
Mays’ long liner before running
into the wall. This memorable
play took on more significance
when McCovey followed with a
triple to center field.
THE ONE AND ONLY run of
the game came way back in the
fifth when New York loaded the
bases with none out and the top
of the order up. When Tony Ku
beck hit into a double play, how
ever, the Giants gladly sacrificed
a run for the two outs, not know
ing that that run would later de
cide the game.
That wasn’t the only threat for
the Yankees off S.F. starter and
loser Jack Sanford. They loaded
the bases with none out again, in
the seventh, but Billy O’Dell got
the necessary three outs on
ground balls by Roger Maris and
Elston Howard, the latter being
a shot over third base which Jim
Davenport turned into a double
play.
But for the Giants, other than
their potential rallies in the
seventh and ninth, they could get
nothing going, and fell in this
seventh game after impressively
contesting baseball’s most pro
ficient pros for the world cham
pionship of 1962.

when McCovey followed with a
triple to center field.
THE ONE AND ONLY run of
the game came way back in the
fifth when New York loaded the
bases with none out and the top
of the order up. When Tony Ku
beck hit into a double play, how
ever, the Giants gladly sacrificed
a run for the two outs, not know
ing that that run would later de
cide the game.
That wasn’t the only threat for
the Yankees off S.F. starter and
loser Jack Sanford. They loaded
the bases with none out again, in
the seventh, but Billy O’Dell got
the necessary three outs on
ground balls by Roger Maris and
Elston Howard, the latter being
a shot over third base which Jim
Davenport turned into a double
play.
But for the Giants, other than
their potential rallies in the
seventh and ninth, they could get
nothing going, and fell in this
seventh game after impressively
contesting baseball’s most pro
ficient pros for the world cham
pionship of 1962.
In (he big game, Ralph Terry
shoved the Giants’ hilling back
into the hole where it had been
hibernating before Monday, and
won the World Series for the
Yankees, 1-0. Nevertheless San
Francisco came within a couple
of feet of being champs when
Willie MeCovey lined out with the

winning run in scoring position
for the last out.
In a Series where outstanding
pitching had become a habit by
the seventh game, Terry turned
in the most impressive perform
ance, not only because of the im
portance of the game, but because
of the complete mastery he had
in choosing and throwing his
pitches. He retired the first 17
batters, gave up but four hits,
did not walk a man, and gave his
fielders easy pop fly chances for
almost eighty per cent of the

Giant outs.
IN WINNING his second
straight World Series and New
York’s tenth in 15 years, manager
Ralph Houk showed the most con
fidence possible in Terry by leav
ing him in, in a ninth inning sit
uation which could easily have
brought victory to San Francisco.
With Matty Alou, who had bunted,
at third, and Willie Mays, who had
doubled Alou around, at second,
more conservative minds would
have brought in the Yankees’ ace
lefty, Whitey Ford, to pitch to the
left handed McCovey (who hit .111
last year against lefthanders), or
would have at least ordered Mc-
Covey intentionally walked. But
Houk stuck with Terry and second
baseman Bobby Richardson did
the rest, catching a sharp line
drive a few inches off the ground.
That wasn’t the only key field
ing play by the Yanks. With one
out in the seventh, Tom Tresh
sprinted to the left field corner
and made a lunging catch of
Mays’ long liner before running
into the wall. This memorable
play took on more significance
when McCovey followed with a
triple to center field.
