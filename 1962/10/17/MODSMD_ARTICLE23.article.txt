## Coed Rifle Team Set 
### 
A new Womenâ€™s Varsity Rifle
Team has been formed in the re
cently reorganized Rifle and Pis
tol Club. This team is in addition
to the old Varsity Rifle Team, in
which the best shooters in the
club participate.
The aim of the club, which is
sponsored by ROTC, but open to
all students is to further interest
in rifle and pistol marksmanship.
Members may use their own 22
caliber target weapons, or they
may borrow the pistols and rifles
of the club, available to every
member for use in practice or
record firing.
The club is a member of the
National Rifle Association, and
the Vai'sity Rifle Team (currently
ranked 11th nationally) fires
against member teams of the
Northern California Intorcolle

giate Rifle Conference.
The Rifle and Pistol Club meets
every Monday at 7 p.m. at the
Rifle range on Campus Drive.

End Hugh Campbell of Wash
ington State leads all AAUW pass
receivers with 17 receptions for
236 yards and three touchdowns
in four games.
