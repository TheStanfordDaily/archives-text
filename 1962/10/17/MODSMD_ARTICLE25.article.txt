How can a football team look so good one week and so bad the
next two? This is the question despondent Stanford fans are asking
after their second consecutive disappointment following an ecstatic
thrill three weeks ago when the Tribe beat Michigan Stale.
However, the Indians are the same strong defensive team that
impressed three weeks ago, and perhaps even a little better with
the added experience of two more games. Last Saturday, they held
one of the nation’s outstanding passing combinations, WSU’s Dave
Mathieson to Hugh Campbell, to an immaculate total of zero yards,
while giving up only 84 yards net to the whole Cougar squad. "We
did more things right against Washington State than against Michi
gan State,’’ sighed Coach Jack Curtice after the game.
Even in a dismal 27-0 defeat to Oregon Slate two weeks ago, tht?
Indian defense was at least adequate. The third Beaver touchdown

came on a pass interception and
16 yard runback and the fourth
occured with the third strings of
both teams playing out the closing
minutes. So in effect, Stanford’s
mainstay defense gave up two
touchdowns to a team directed by
an all-round, Ail-American quar
terback, Terry Baker.
But all this rationalization still
doesn’t explain the results: Stan
ford looked great and beat nation
ally respected MSU, looked lousy
and was wiped by OSU, and
looker! great on defense and lousy
on offense and lost I o WSIJ. How
come?
MORALE AND MISTAKES
I think the answer' lies in two
aspects of football which are often
mentioned but rarely fully under
stood—team morale and individ
ual physical lapses. (By physical

lapses I mean mistakes that any
human performer, being fallible, can be expected to make once in a I
while, no matter how proficient he is in general.) The lapses have
hurt Stanford primarily on offense.
Against Michigan State, the Indians were sky-high emotionally, j
eager to avenge before a home crowd their pasting of a year ago; |
meanwhile, the Spartans were confident and blase about the game.
The result was complete curtailment of the heralded MSU multiple
offense by rugged line play and exceptionally aggressive defensive
end play.
On offense, Stanford played fully up to its potential, such as it }
was at that time of (he young season. Despite several inaccurately
thrown passes, Stanford had three scoring drives, two all the way }
for touchdowns. But examining those drives, each one was built
around one spectacular long-gainer. A 37 yard pass from Steve Thur
low to Bob Howard comprised 97 per cent of a 38 yard touchdown
drive; a 42 yard screen pass run by J. D. Lodato set up a field goal,
and a 33 yard run by John Paye scored another T.D.
Praised be God for those three beauties, but they are not the |
type of gains Stanford fans can expect to see very often this year. '
Handicapped by the absence of a speedy, break away back, a con
sistently accurate long passer, or a group of fast, sure-handed re
ceivers, the Indians’ most optimistic offensive hopes for this year
were to methodically grind out two or three scores a game and leave
the rest to an overpowering defense.
But the runs of Lodato and Paye are of the type made by Ore- j
gon's scatback, Mel Renfro, and the Thurlow to Howard pass is j
more typical of Terry Baker to Verne Burke (the nation's leading j
passer and receiver).
In other words, against MSU, Stanford's offensive gears meshed
as they probably never will again in 1962, while Stanford’s defense
smothered the Spartans, who were at a tremendous psychological}
disadvantage. And the Indians were world beaters for a day.
Unfortunately, the Indians thought they were world beaters for
eight days, because a week later, they ran blithely into Oregon State !
and were pushed all over the field by a team which sought revenge
for a 34-0 loss in 1961, much as Stanford was out to make up for I
the 1961 game against MSU So, for the second consecutive week }
in Stanford Stadium, high team morale, this time on the oppo
nent’s side, was important in deciding a football game.
An offensive mistake was also a significant factor. In the second
quarter, the Indians were driving for the tying touchdown, which,
if scored, might have changed the direction of the game. However, j
with a first down in sight on the OSU five, sophomore halfback Allan
Curr dropped a fourth-down pitchout and the drive ended.
As for last week, an outstanding Indian defense earned a shutout |
except for a 92-yard kickoff return to begin the third quarter; the j
run was set up by a beautiful fake reverse by the two WSU safeties, j
The other- two Cougar touchdowns in the 21-6 score can be charged ■
to Indian offensive mistakes, the kind they didn’t make against MSU j
but are making now to even up the law of averages. In the second
quarter, Frank Dubofsky, one of the most dependable interior line- }
men, failed to hold his man out on a quick kick play. Although the
rest of the line held, the kick was blocked and recovered for a Cougar
touchdown.
In the third quarter, Thurlow, who completed six passes for 126
yards and had none intercepted against MSU, threw directly into
the arms of a Cougar back, setting up a WSU scoring drive that
started from Stanford’s 28.
There were several other offensive lapses which killed Indian
drives. Steve Pursell dropped a short pass on WSU’s two when a j
Stanford TD looked imminent. Frank Patitucci, who has won all
kinds of praise for his blocking and tackling, dropped three catchable
passes on the day. Not to mention the three unrecovered fumbles
that abruptly ended Indian drives. Again, these are the lapses that
didn’t occur against MSU.
I only hope the law of averages of offensive lapses has evened
up by now, and as regards the future, that the Indians save most of
their offensive lapses for the San Jose State game.

drive; a 42 yard screen pass run by J. D. Lodato set up a field goal,
and a 33 yard run by John Paye scored another T.D.
Praised be God for those three beauties, but they are not the |
type of gains Stanford fans can expect to see very often this year. '
Handicapped by the absence of a speedy, break away back, a con
sistently accurate long passer, or a group of fast, sure-handed re
ceivers, the Indians’ most optimistic offensive hopes for this year
were to methodically grind out two or three scores a game and leave
the rest to an overpowering defense.
But the runs of Lodato and Paye are of the type made by Ore- j
gon's scatback, Mel Renfro, and the Thurlow to Howard pass is j
more typical of Terry Baker to Verne Burke (the nation's leading j
passer and receiver).
In other words, against MSU, Stanford's offensive gears meshed
as they probably never will again in 1962, while Stanford’s defense
smothered the Spartans, who were at a tremendous psychological}
disadvantage. And the Indians were world beaters for a day.
Unfortunately, the Indians thought they were world beaters for
eight days, because a week later, they ran blithely into Oregon State !
and were pushed all over the field by a team which sought revenge
for a 34-0 loss in 1961, much as Stanford was out to make up for I
the 1961 game against MSU So, for the second consecutive week }
in Stanford Stadium, high team morale, this time on the oppo
nent’s side, was important in deciding a football game.
An offensive mistake was also a significant factor. In the second
quarter, the Indians were driving for the tying touchdown, which,
if scored, might have changed the direction of the game. However, j
with a first down in sight on the OSU five, sophomore halfback Allan
Curr dropped a fourth-down pitchout and the drive ended.
As for last week, an outstanding Indian defense earned a shutout |
except for a 92-yard kickoff return to begin the third quarter; the j
run was set up by a beautiful fake reverse by the two WSU safeties, j
The other- two Cougar touchdowns in the 21-6 score can be charged ■
to Indian offensive mistakes, the kind they didn’t make against MSU j
but are making now to even up the law of averages. In the second
quarter, Frank Dubofsky, one of the most dependable interior line- }
men, failed to hold his man out on a quick kick play. Although the
rest of the line held, the kick was blocked and recovered for a Cougar
touchdown.
In the third quarter, Thurlow, who completed six passes for 126
yards and had none intercepted against MSU, threw directly into
the arms of a Cougar back, setting up a WSU scoring drive that
started from Stanford’s 28.
There were several other offensive lapses which killed Indian
drives. Steve Pursell dropped a short pass on WSU’s two when a j
Stanford TD looked imminent. Frank Patitucci, who has won all
kinds of praise for his blocking and tackling, dropped three catchable
passes on the day. Not to mention the three unrecovered fumbles
that abruptly ended Indian drives. Again, these are the lapses that
didn’t occur against MSU.
I only hope the law of averages of offensive lapses has evened
up by now, and as regards the future, that the Indians save most of
their offensive lapses for the San Jose State game.

How can a football team look so good one week and so bad the
next two? This is the question despondent Stanford fans are asking
after their second consecutive disappointment following an ecstatic
thrill three weeks ago when the Tribe beat Michigan Stale.
However, the Indians are the same strong defensive team that
impressed three weeks ago, and perhaps even a little better with
the added experience of two more games. Last Saturday, they held
one of the nation’s outstanding passing combinations, WSU’s Dave
Mathieson to Hugh Campbell, to an immaculate total of zero yards,
while giving up only 84 yards net to the whole Cougar squad. "We
did more things right against Washington State than against Michi
gan State,’’ sighed Coach Jack Curtice after the game.
Even in a dismal 27-0 defeat to Oregon Slate two weeks ago, tht?
Indian defense was at least adequate. The third Beaver touchdown

came on a pass interception and
16 yard runback and the fourth
occured with the third strings of
both teams playing out the closing
minutes. So in effect, Stanford’s
mainstay defense gave up two
touchdowns to a team directed by
an all-round, Ail-American quar
terback, Terry Baker.
But all this rationalization still
doesn’t explain the results: Stan
ford looked great and beat nation
ally respected MSU, looked lousy
and was wiped by OSU, and
looker! great on defense and lousy
on offense and lost I o WSIJ. How
come?
MORALE AND MISTAKES
I think the answer' lies in two
aspects of football which are often
mentioned but rarely fully under
stood—team morale and individ
ual physical lapses. (By physical

lapses I mean mistakes that any
human performer, being fallible, can be expected to make once in a I
while, no matter how proficient he is in general.) The lapses have
hurt Stanford primarily on offense.
Against Michigan State, the Indians were sky-high emotionally, j
eager to avenge before a home crowd their pasting of a year ago; |
meanwhile, the Spartans were confident and blase about the game.
The result was complete curtailment of the heralded MSU multiple
offense by rugged line play and exceptionally aggressive defensive
end play.
On offense, Stanford played fully up to its potential, such as it }
was at that time of (he young season. Despite several inaccurately
thrown passes, Stanford had three scoring drives, two all the way }
for touchdowns. But examining those drives, each one was built
around one spectacular long-gainer. A 37 yard pass from Steve Thur
low to Bob Howard comprised 97 per cent of a 38 yard touchdown
drive; a 42 yard screen pass run by J. D. Lodato set up a field goal,
and a 33 yard run by John Paye scored another T.D.

rest of the line held, the kick was blocked and recovered for a Cougar
touchdown.
In the third quarter, Thurlow, who completed six passes for 126
yards and had none intercepted against MSU, threw directly into
the arms of a Cougar back, setting up a WSU scoring drive that
started from Stanford’s 28.
There were several other offensive lapses which killed Indian
drives. Steve Pursell dropped a short pass on WSU’s two when a j
Stanford TD looked imminent. Frank Patitucci, who has won all
kinds of praise for his blocking and tackling, dropped three catchable
passes on the day. Not to mention the three unrecovered fumbles
that abruptly ended Indian drives. Again, these are the lapses that
didn’t occur against MSU.
I only hope the law of averages of offensive lapses has evened
up by now, and as regards the future, that the Indians save most of
their offensive lapses for the San Jose State game.

How can a football team look so good one week and so bad the
next two? This is the question despondent Stanford fans are asking
after their second consecutive disappointment following an ecstatic
thrill three weeks ago when the Tribe beat Michigan Stale.
However, the Indians are the same strong defensive team that
impressed three weeks ago, and perhaps even a little better with
the added experience of two more games. Last Saturday, they held
one of the nation’s outstanding passing combinations, WSU’s Dave
Mathieson to Hugh Campbell, to an immaculate total of zero yards,
while giving up only 84 yards net to the whole Cougar squad. "We
did more things right against Washington State than against Michi
gan State,’’ sighed Coach Jack Curtice after the game.
Even in a dismal 27-0 defeat to Oregon Slate two weeks ago, tht?
Indian defense was at least adequate. The third Beaver touchdown

came on a pass interception and
16 yard runback and the fourth
occured with the third strings of
both teams playing out the closing
minutes. So in effect, Stanford’s
mainstay defense gave up two
touchdowns to a team directed by
an all-round, Ail-American quar
terback, Terry Baker.
But all this rationalization still
doesn’t explain the results: Stan
ford looked great and beat nation
ally respected MSU, looked lousy
and was wiped by OSU, and
looker! great on defense and lousy
on offense and lost I o WSIJ. How
come?
MORALE AND MISTAKES
I think the answer' lies in two
aspects of football which are often
mentioned but rarely fully under
stood—team morale and individ
ual physical lapses. (By physical

lapses I mean mistakes that any
human performer, being fallible, can be expected to make once in a I
while, no matter how proficient he is in general.) The lapses have
hurt Stanford primarily on offense.
Against Michigan State, the Indians were sky-high emotionally, j
eager to avenge before a home crowd their pasting of a year ago; |
meanwhile, the Spartans were confident and blase about the game.
The result was complete curtailment of the heralded MSU multiple
offense by rugged line play and exceptionally aggressive defensive
end play.
On offense, Stanford played fully up to its potential, such as it }
was at that time of (he young season. Despite several inaccurately
thrown passes, Stanford had three scoring drives, two all the way }
for touchdowns. But examining those drives, each one was built
around one spectacular long-gainer. A 37 yard pass from Steve Thur
low to Bob Howard comprised 97 per cent of a 38 yard touchdown
drive; a 42 yard screen pass run by J. D. Lodato set up a field goal,
and a 33 yard run by John Paye scored another T.D.
Praised be God for those three beauties, but they are not the |
type of gains Stanford fans can expect to see very often this year. '
Handicapped by the absence of a speedy, break away back, a con
sistently accurate long passer, or a group of fast, sure-handed re
ceivers, the Indians’ most optimistic offensive hopes for this year
were to methodically grind out two or three scores a game and leave
the rest to an overpowering defense.
But the runs of Lodato and Paye are of the type made by Ore- j
gon's scatback, Mel Renfro, and the Thurlow to Howard pass is j
more typical of Terry Baker to Verne Burke (the nation's leading j
passer and receiver).
In other words, against MSU, Stanford's offensive gears meshed
as they probably never will again in 1962, while Stanford’s defense
smothered the Spartans, who were at a tremendous psychological}
disadvantage. And the Indians were world beaters for a day.
Unfortunately, the Indians thought they were world beaters for
eight days, because a week later, they ran blithely into Oregon State !
and were pushed all over the field by a team which sought revenge
for a 34-0 loss in 1961, much as Stanford was out to make up for I
the 1961 game against MSU So, for the second consecutive week }
in Stanford Stadium, high team morale, this time on the oppo
nent’s side, was important in deciding a football game.
An offensive mistake was also a significant factor. In the second
quarter, the Indians were driving for the tying touchdown, which,
if scored, might have changed the direction of the game. However, j
with a first down in sight on the OSU five, sophomore halfback Allan
Curr dropped a fourth-down pitchout and the drive ended.
As for last week, an outstanding Indian defense earned a shutout |
except for a 92-yard kickoff return to begin the third quarter; the j
run was set up by a beautiful fake reverse by the two WSU safeties, j
The other- two Cougar touchdowns in the 21-6 score can be charged ■

but are making now to even up the law of averages. In the second

stood—team morale and individ
ual physical lapses. (By physical

lapses I mean mistakes that any
human performer, being fallible, can be expected to make once in a I
while, no matter how proficient he is in general.) The lapses have
hurt Stanford primarily on offense.
Against Michigan State, the Indians were sky-high emotionally, j
eager to avenge before a home crowd their pasting of a year ago; |
meanwhile, the Spartans were confident and blase about the game.
The result was complete curtailment of the heralded MSU multiple
offense by rugged line play and exceptionally aggressive defensive
end play.
On offense, Stanford played fully up to its potential, such as it }
was at that time of (he young season. Despite several inaccurately
thrown passes, Stanford had three scoring drives, two all the way }
for touchdowns. But examining those drives, each one was built
around one spectacular long-gainer. A 37 yard pass from Steve Thur
low to Bob Howard comprised 97 per cent of a 38 yard touchdown
drive; a 42 yard screen pass run by J. D. Lodato set up a field goal,
and a 33 yard run by John Paye scored another T.D.
Praised be God for those three beauties, but they are not the |
type of gains Stanford fans can expect to see very often this year. '
Handicapped by the absence of a speedy, break away back, a con
sistently accurate long passer, or a group of fast, sure-handed re
ceivers, the Indians’ most optimistic offensive hopes for this year
were to methodically grind out two or three scores a game and leave
the rest to an overpowering defense.
But the runs of Lodato and Paye are of the type made by Ore- j
gon's scatback, Mel Renfro, and the Thurlow to Howard pass is j
more typical of Terry Baker to Verne Burke (the nation's leading j
passer and receiver).
In other words, against MSU, Stanford's offensive gears meshed
as they probably never will again in 1962, while Stanford’s defense
smothered the Spartans, who were at a tremendous psychological}
disadvantage. And the Indians were world beaters for a day.
Unfortunately, the Indians thought they were world beaters for
eight days, because a week later, they ran blithely into Oregon State !
and were pushed all over the field by a team which sought revenge
for a 34-0 loss in 1961, much as Stanford was out to make up for I
the 1961 game against MSU So, for the second consecutive week }
in Stanford Stadium, high team morale, this time on the oppo
nent’s side, was important in deciding a football game.
An offensive mistake was also a significant factor. In the second
quarter, the Indians were driving for the tying touchdown, which,
if scored, might have changed the direction of the game. However, j
with a first down in sight on the OSU five, sophomore halfback Allan
Curr dropped a fourth-down pitchout and the drive ended.
As for last week, an outstanding Indian defense earned a shutout |
except for a 92-yard kickoff return to begin the third quarter; the j
run was set up by a beautiful fake reverse by the two WSU safeties, j
The other- two Cougar touchdowns in the 21-6 score can be charged ■
to Indian offensive mistakes, the kind they didn’t make against MSU j
but are making now to even up the law of averages. In the second
quarter, Frank Dubofsky, one of the most dependable interior line- }
men, failed to hold his man out on a quick kick play. Although the
rest of the line held, the kick was blocked and recovered for a Cougar
touchdown.
In the third quarter, Thurlow, who completed six passes for 126
yards and had none intercepted against MSU, threw directly into
the arms of a Cougar back, setting up a WSU scoring drive that
started from Stanford’s 28.
There were several other offensive lapses which killed Indian
drives. Steve Pursell dropped a short pass on WSU’s two when a j
Stanford TD looked imminent. Frank Patitucci, who has won all
kinds of praise for his blocking and tackling, dropped three catchable
passes on the day. Not to mention the three unrecovered fumbles
that abruptly ended Indian drives. Again, these are the lapses that
didn’t occur against MSU.
I only hope the law of averages of offensive lapses has evened
up by now, and as regards the future, that the Indians save most of
their offensive lapses for the San Jose State game.
