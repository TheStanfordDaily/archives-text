# Old Union Renovated; To House Dean's Offices
## 
### JONNET STEINBAUM 
Now that many student activities have migrated across the
street to the now Tresldder Memorial Union, the buildings in the
“Old Union” quad have some new roles to play in campus life. Gone
arc the “Cellar.” the “Nitery,” and the old barber shop and into their
places come faculty and departmental offices, and I-Center head
quarters.
Planning Office officials have long-range ideas for the three
buildings of the Old Union quad. The present buildings: the Union
Residence housing 80 upperclass women, the MciTs Clubhouse, and
the Women's Clubhouse, are under consideration for the many de
partments of the Dean of Students.
MOVING the headquarters of the Dean of Students into the
Old Union quad has the primary advantage of locating the adminis
trative areas which have direct contact with the students in the
heart of the student activity area. At present, these offices occupy
valuable academic space in the Inner Quad and Encina Hall. How
ever, this centralization of student activities will not begin until new
women’s residences free (lie Union for office space. According to
Allan Massingham, senior planner, this will not occur for at least
three years.
While the university’s PACE planners contemplate permanent
functions for the Old Union quad buildings, the I-Center has set up
its lounge, library, and offices on the second and third floors of the
Men’s Clubhouse. The office of the Foreign Student Adviser is
located next to the I-Center rooms. The Nitery now belongs to the
Speech and Drama department and will probably he used for small
rehearsals. Other rooms on the main floor arc now occupied by the
art department. Faculty offices primarily for the sumanities depart
ment and a modern European language library for graduates take
up the rest of the Men’s Clubhouse
The functions of the Union Residence and Women's Clubhouse
are the same as in the past except that the former offices of the
Food Service in the Old Union are now vacant.
