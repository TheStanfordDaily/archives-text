# Value of Rally Com, Stunts Questioned
## 
### 
In an all-out effort to determine
campus opinion regarding foot
ball game card stunts, rooting
section segregation, and the ex
istence of Ra’ly Comm’s - o . ;
-elf. Yell Leaders and T'-W’ fern
mission directors consulted repre
sentatives of the administration
and LASSU, and conducted a hur
ried poll of student opinion yes
terday.

Head Yell Leader Roger Sal
quist and his Assistant Yell Lead
er Ed Kaiser spoke with Armin
Rosencranz, President of ASSU.
He stated that he believed in
school spirit, and definitely ap
proves of the yell leaders and
their functions at football games.
Rosencranz added, however, that
if it was his personal decision, at
this moment, he would abolish
Rally Commission—not because
he does not believe in it, but be
cause of the attitude which he

believes to be prevalent within
at group.
Rosencranz also said that he
ould speak with a few of the
LASSU members, and the v/il
reduce a statement of \ hat the
believe Rally Commission shou d
be, and would propose a plan of
what they believe sholud be done.
Kaiser expressed hope that, “if
Armin and the students are in
favor of Rally Commission and
Armin sees no problem in the
idea of our group, although ho ob
jects to certain aspects, w 7 o should
be able to continue to operate.”
THE TWO Yell Leaders then
spoke to Frederick Glover. Exec
utive Assistant to President Wal
lace Sterling, and asked him
what the position of the adminis
tration was on the matter, and
what they would like to see done.
Glover replied that the admin
istration in no way suggested the
idea of abolishing Rally Commis
sion or the card stunts; in fact,
he said, the administration is in
favor of yell leaders, Pom Pom
girls, card stunts, and Rally Com
mission. "Their main worry lies
with the yell leaders in leading
gross yells and gross gestures,
and with drunken unruliness in
the rooting section,” he said. “It
is now the position of the admin
istration that anyone found drunk
will be in line for immediate ex
pulsion.”
Jerry Schaefer, Rally Commis
sion chairman, feels that the poll
has helped the Commission to
better judge its position on cam
pus. “Before we were arguing
about many things we did not
know about; with this survey and
meetings with Rosencranz and
Glover we now have the facts.”
KAISER declared “There is no
reason for continuing card stunts
if the student body doesn’t be
lieve in them, because it is work
for the student body and for the
Rally Commission.”
An estimated 120 man-hours
per week are spent designing the
stunts and printing instructions,
and another 80 hours setting up
and sorting the cards.
A poll of the student body was
conducted in rapid-fire fashion
by the yell leaders and two Rally
Commission directors. The stu
dents were asked three questions:
Do you want card stunts? Should
Stanford have a Rally Commis
sion? Do you want an integrated
ooting section?
VOTES on these questions were
■ounted by the houses questioned
and were set into ratios by these
houses.
The question survey was pre
sented at lunch and dinner in the
undergraduate living groups on
campus. Schaefer reported the
“feeling was 90 per cent or over
in favor of retaining Rally Com.
I was as objective as possible in
presentation,’ he added.
A sampling of the results,
which were obtained by simple
hand or voice votes are that;
• Wilbur Hall freshmen voted
overwhelmingly in favor of card
stunts and Rally Comission, and
equally strongly against inte
grated rooting sections.
• Votes in the fraternities were
running about 6-1 in the same di
rection, except for Fiji, which
voted almost unanimously against
card stunts and Rally Commis
sion, and in favor of integration.
• The women’s Row Houses
voted heavily in favor of the first
two questions and against the
third.
