HIGH TEST, LOW TEST, NO TEST
Just the other night I was saying to the little woman, “Do you
think the importance of tests in American colleges is being
overemphasized?” (The little woman, incidentally, is not, as
you might think, my wife. My wife is far from a little woman.
She is, in fact, almost seven feet high and heavily muscled.
She is a full-blooded Chiricahua Apache and holds the world’s
hammer-throw record. The little woman I referred to is some
one we found crouching under the sofa when we moved into
our apartment several years ago, and there she has remained
ever since. She never speaks, except to make a kind of guttural
clicking sound when she is hungry. Actually, she is not too
much fun to have around, but with my wife away at track meets
most of the time, at least it gives me somebody to talk to.)
But I digress. “Do you think the importance of tests in
American colleges is being overemphasized?” 1 said the other
night to the little woman, and then 1 said, “Vcs, Max, I do
think the importance of tests in American colleges is being
overemphasized.” (As 1 have explained, the little woman does
not speak, so when we have conversations, I am forced to do
both parts.)

To get back to tests—sure, they’re important, but let’s not
allow them to get 100 important. There are, after all, many
qualities and talents that simply can’t be measured by quizzes.
Is it right to penalize a gifted student whose gifts don’t happen
to be of the academic variety? Like, for instance, Gregor
Sigafoos?
Gregor, a freshman at the New Hampshire College of Tanning
and Belles Lettres, has never passed a single test; yet all who
know him agree that he is studded with talent like a ham with
cloves. He can, for example, sleep standing up. He can do a
perfect imitation of a scarlet tanager. (I don’t mean just do
the bird calls; I mean he can fly South in the winter.) He can
pick up B-B’s with his toes. He can say “Toy boat” three times
fast. He can build a rude telephone out of two empty Marlboro
packs and 100 yards of butcher’s twine. (Of all his impressive
accomplishments, this last is the one Gregor likes to do best
—not building the telephone, but emptying the Marlboro
packs. Gregor doesn’t just dump the Marlboros out of the
pack. He smokes them one at a time—settling back, getting
comfortable, savoring each tasty puff. As Gregor often says
with a winsome smile, “By George, the makers of Marlboro
took their time finding this fine flavor, this great filter, and by
George, I’m going to take my time enjoying ’em!”)
Well, sir, there you have Gregor Sigafoos—artist, humanist,
philosopher, Marlboro smoker, and freshman since 1939. Will
the world—so desperately in need of talent—ever benefit from
Gregor’s great gifts? Alas, no. He is in college to stay.
But even more tragic for mankind is the case of Anna Livia
Plurabelle. Anna Livia, a classmate of Gregor’s, had no talent,
no gifts, no brains, no personality. All she had was a knack for
taking tests. She would cram like crazy before a test, always
get a perfect score, and then promptly forget everything she had
learned. Naturally, she graduated with highest honors and
degrees by the dozen, but the sad fact is that she left college
no more educated, no more prepared to cope with the world,
than when she entered. Today, a broken woman, she crouches
tinder my sofa. ® 1902 m» sbuimM

And speaking of tests. tee makers of Marlboro put ottr
cigarette through an impressive number before] we send
it to the market. Hut ultimately, there is only one lest
that counts: Do > Ol like it? He think you will.
