Denver Alumni Donate
$300,000 In Gifts

Two gifts to Stanford, totaling
more than $300,000, were an
nounced in Denver, Colorado, last
night at a Stanford regional din
ner launching the university’s
PACE Program campaign in that
area.
The Denver donors are Clar
ence West, retired vice president
of Continental Air Lines, and the
late Mrs. Helen Allabach Bannis
ter. Joseph E. Cook Jr., regional
chairman of the PACE Program,
told Stanford alumni and friends
assembled at the Pinehurst Coun
try Club that the two donations
will bring the University more
than $lOO,OOO additional in match
ing funds from the Ford Founda
tion.
THE GIFT from Mr. West, a
Stanford graduate in 1927, is an
ownership share in his California
ranch property in Tulare County.
He specified that funds from the
gift, with current estimated value
of about $30,000. be used along
with his previous contributions to
the university for the future bene
fit of the Graduate School of
Business.
The will of the late Mrs. Ban
nister gave Stanford the bulk of
her estate, valued at more than
$500,000. The gift will be used to
establish the Helen Allabach Ban
nister fund.
Mrs. Bannister was the widow
of L. Ward Bannister, Denver at
torney and a Stanford graduate
in 1893. Their son, Wayne Ban

nister, also an alumnus, died in
World War 11.
IT WAS recently announced
that the PACE campaign total
had passed the halfway mark to
ward its $lOO million goal, in

tion funds. The nationwide, in
tensive phase of the drive is be
ginning with a series of nearly
70 regional dinners across the
country this month and next.
