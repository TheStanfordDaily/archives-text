# Rooting Section, Constitution on LASSU Agenda
## 
### 
The Legislature will meet to
night to consider the abolition of
class government, the reinstate
ment of a segregated rooting sec
tion, and revision of the proposed
constitution.
ASSU president Armin Rosen
cranz stated that he expects the
Legislature to re-establish a seg
regated rooting section.
In connection with a motion
recorded at last weekâ€™s LASSU
meeting, the repeal of Article XIII
of the By-laws, which establishes
class government, will be con
sidered.
DISCUSSION of the proposed
constitution, begun last week,
will continue. In addition to mea
sures previously mentioned in
The Daily, the Legislature will
consider changing the role of the
ASSU president in legislature.
The amendments proposed
would 1) make the ASSU presi
dent an ex-officio member, rather
than a voting member, of the
Legislature, 2) give presiding of
ficer duties, now hold by the
ASSU president, to a speaker
elected from the Legislature, 3)
give the ASSU president veto
power over non-budgetary decis
ions of the Legislature, and 4)
give the Legislature the power to
override a presidential veto by a
two-thirds majority.
The appointment of Toby
Hayes and Lynn Cipolat as chair
man and co-chairman of Pre-Reg
will also be considered.
