## 
### FRED GOFF Stanford NSA Coordinator 
(Editor’s note: This Is the first
of a series of articles by some of
tiie ten Stanford students who at
tended the ten-day 15th annual
NSA Congress this summer at
Ohio State University.)
Last spring, after a spirited
three-week campaign, Stanford
students voted to affiliate with
the United States National Stu
dent Association (USNSA), the
only nation-wide, non-partisan,
representative student union in
this country. The approximately
•100 member colleges and universi
ties include over 1,300,000 stu
dents.
In the words of Columbia Uni
versity’s delegation, NSA pro
vides “an unparalleled opportu
nity for all American students to
become involved in the discussion
and solution of the problems of
education nationally and interna
tionally.”
The NSA holds an annual Na
tional Student Congress, where
delegates of member schools de
bate and pass resolutions on is
sues of concern to students.
Throughout the year the NSA im
plements congressional mandates
in such areas as student civil
rights, academic freedom, and for
eign student relations. It repre
sents US students at international
student conferences, such as those
held this summer in Quebec and
Copenhagen. Through its Educa

tional Travel Incorporated (ETD
it sets up student rate travel ar
rangements throughout the
world. Its Student Government
Information Service offers valu
able information on student af
fairs to all its member schools.
This year’s Stanford delegation
included Armin Rosencranz,
ASSU president; Sue Westerberg,
AWS president; Ed Eschbach,
IFC president: Nils Wessell,
Daily editor; John Steinbruner,
Wilbur head sponsor, and other
LASSU appointees, Tom Grey,
Jim Woolsey, Mike Hammer, and
Sandy McKenzie. The delegates
participated in some of the 22
seminars which took up the first
two days of the congress. The
topics ranged from university
student relations to international
student affairs, and the spectrum
of speakers included a university
president, deans, international
student leaders, and NSA offi
cers.
The following two days were
spent in sub-committees where
resolutions were drafted, debated,
and approved or rejected. If ap
proved they were passed on to
one of the five committees for
final approval before being re
ferred to the full congress.
During the final session, Den
nis Shaul, one of last year’s
Rhodes Scholars and head of IRS
(the coordinating body for the
non-Communist Americans at the
Helsinki Youth Festival) was
elected this year’s NSA president.
