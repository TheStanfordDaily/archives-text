# Rosencranz's 'Testament' Advises NSA Delegates
## 
### 
(Editor’s note: The following is
a verbatim transcript of a leaflet
handed out at the NSA Congress
hy ASSU President Annin Rosen
eranz during the debate on nu
clear testing. The Congress voted
to condemn all nuclear testing
and to condemn particularly the
moratorium-breaking resumption
of testing hy the U.S.S.R. In Au
gust, 1961.)

TESTAMENT
It is suggested that, during the
nuclear testing debate, delegates
choose the resolution below which
most closely approximates their
own position.
Com: The USNSA severely
condemns the United States gov
ernment for its horrendous nu
clear test program. We condemn
all testing by France and Great
Britain also. The USNSA recog
nizes that the Soviet Union has
justifiably resumed testing to
protect its national security. We
note with interest and approval
the progress that the Chinese
People’s Republic has made in its
atoms for peace program.
Com-symp: The USNSA con
demns the United States, Britain,
and France for their bellicose
policy of nuclear testing. We re
gret that the USSR has resumed
testing although, of course, we
recognize the considerable provo
cation from the West which pre
ceded the decision to resume, and
applaud the Soviet Union’s for
bearance before August sixth.

Lib: The USNSA condemns all
nuclear testing and regrets the
whole bloody mess.
Webster Qiiimmley Society
(named in memory of the famous
middle of the reader who was
killed in an automobile while
driving over the islands in the
center of the Santa Ana free
way): The USNSA condemns the
Soviet Union’s resumption of
tests and deplores the United
States’ earlier test series. We re
gret the fact that we only deplore
the United States testing and
seem to be using a double stan
dard. It should be noted, however,
that the Soviet Union violated the
moratorium and hence is more
condemnable than the U.S. On the
other hand, it is arguable that the
Soviets were justified in resum
ing testing after the French ex
plosions which we deplore. In
sum, we hope the Soviet Union

will note that we have deplored
the West twice while condemning
(he Soviets only once and, there
fore, everybody should be happy.
Cons: The USNSA condemns
nuclear testing by the Soviet Un
ion and regrets testing by the
U.S. A single standard has no
meaning when we’re right and
they’re wrong.
YAF: The USNSA condemns
all nihilistic relativists who don't
see that some tests are more con
demnable than other tests. Rus
sia’s tests are dirty. Our tests arc
clean. God is an American.
Birch: The USNSA severely
condemns the Soviet Union for
violating the rights of mankind
by poisoning the atmospheie with
nuclear tests. We urge the United
States to resume testing to pro
tect its national security. We
herewith note with interest the
existence of the Sino-Soviet split
and the progress being made by
the Red Chinese in their atomic
research. We look forward to the
use of nuclear weapons by the
Chinese to resolve their differ
ences and thereby help us make
the world safe for democracy.
