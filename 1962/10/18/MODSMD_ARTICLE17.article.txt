Editor, The Daily:
A careful, responsible reading
of my letter of October 13 will
show that I in no case state that
it is naive for students to partici
pate in high level policy-making
—I at no time assert that com
plete academic freedom is an “in
sidious” idea which opens the
door to irresponsibility—and I in
no way insinuate that my “most
important” argument concerns
partisan political activity on
campus. Rather I state that it is
naive for Mr. Rosencranz to as
sert that student enthusiasm is a
proper substitute for experience
—I state that the door to irre
sponsibility is opened by Mr. Ro
sencranz’s failure to define “What
is worth hearing” and his failure
to define a workable substitute
for the Committee on Public Ex
orcises, and primarily I state that
it is naive and irresponsible to
assert that the attainment of his
“Four Freedoms” will enable
Stanford “to at last take its right
ful place among the truly great
universities of the world.”
