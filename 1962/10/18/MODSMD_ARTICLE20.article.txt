The idea of a united Europe,
now receiving so much attention
on both sides of the Atlantic, may
be traced far back into European
history, perhaps to the Duke of
Sully or at least to Mazzini. But
the first coherent scheme of At
lantic Community with any possi
bility of successful implementa
tion came after World War I. As
early as 1924 Count Coudenhove-
Kalergi, inspired by the Ameri
can Federal Constitution, propos
ed a Pan European Union, which
called for a partial abandonment
of national sovereignty.
Such leading statesmen as
Streseman, Herriot and Briand
supported this call for unity, and
in 1930 the latter proposed, at tTie
League of Nations, the creation
of a European Federal Union. For
two years Briand fought for his
proposal, but in 1932 both he
and his idea died.That year Hitler
came to power, thus making the
cause of European integration
untenable.
The effect of World War II on
the idea of European union was
profound and immediate. Tradi
tional institutions throughout the
continent were disintegrating un
der the pressures of war or dic
tatorships. For many Europeans
the national state as a political
concept was found wanting, and
in the disillusionment of defeat a
new faith in the European idea
was born. In Britain, however,
where old loyalties remained
strongest, the appeal for a United
Europe evoked the least response.
In spite of British insularity,
Churchill saw clearly the impor
tance of European integration,
and in 1946, at Zurich, he called
for the creation of a United
States of Europe, the first step
of which would be the establish
ment of a Council of Europe.
Movements favoring some sort of
union began to flourish, and by
1948 most of them were federated
into the “International Commit
tee of the Movements for Euro
pean Unity.”
Political developments parallel
ed and reinforced the intellectual
trend toward European integra
tion. The Treaty of Dunkirk,
signed by France and Britain in
1947, promised mutual assistance
in case of a renewed German
threat, and provided as well for
economic cooperation and securi
ty. Shortly thereafter the United
States proposed the Marshall
Plan for the reconstruction of
Europe. In response delegates
from 16 countries drew up a pro
gram of action, and by the follow
ing year the treaty establishing
the Organization for European
Economic Cooperation (OEEC)
was completed.
In the same year, 1948, came
both the fall of Prague to the
communists and the Berlin Block
ade. Out of a desire for increased
security in the now openly “de
clared” cold war, Benelux and the
signatories of the Treaty of Dun
kirk signed the Treaty of Brus
sels, giving birth thereby to the
Western European Union, pri
marily a military alliance, but
with provisions for political, so
cial, economic, and cultural co
operation. NATO, established the
following year, was the next logi
cal development in defense.
Meanwhile, the attempt to cre
ate some common political insti
tutions was meeting with British
intransigence. The British favor
ed the creation of a purely inter
governmental organization, while
the continental thesis called for
an assembly with supra-national
authority. Finally agreement was
reached on a “Council of Europe,”
consisting of the five signatories

of the Treaty of Brussels, plus
Ireland. Italy and the three Scan
danavian countries. Soon Greece,
Turkey, Iceland, Austria, and the
German Federal Republic joined
the Council. The political powers
of the Council of Europe were
not, however, extensive, for they
were limited to adopting recom
mendations, which left them little
room for dramatic action. In view
of this near impasse, many began
to think of the possibilities of eco
nomic, rather than political, inte
gration. Such a shift in emphasis
would clearly necessitate new in
stitutions. But what were these
to be? What could Europeans
agree upon? Was the idea of Eu
ropean unity to fail before ever
being tested? Such questions
weighed heavily on the minds of
Europe’s leaders as they entered
the 1950'5.
