# Unbeaten Huskies Have Speed, Depth
## 
### PETE KING 
One of the most potent ground
attacks seen on the West Coast
in recent years will come barrel
ing into Stanford Stadium Satur
day as Washington opens its

AAWU football action against the
Indians.
The Huskies are shooting for
their third Rose Bowl in four
years, and they’ve got all the odds
in their favor. Coach Jim Owens
can boast two potential All-
Americans and three-deep talent
at nearly every position.
Stanford assistant coach Dutch
Fehring returned this week after
watching the Huskies edge Ore
gon State, 14-13, and reports that
Washington has tremendous

depth, a speedy backfield and an [
experienced line.
HEADING THE explosive Hus
ky backs is halfback Charlie
Mitchell, a 5-11, 182-pound speed
ster whose powerful legs have
earned him a two-year rushing
average of 5.4 yards. He has
scored on runs of 90, 85, 63, and
59 yards and is dangerous every
time he lays hands on the hall.
Backing up Mitchell is Nat
Whitmeyer, a crazy-legs runner
and very dangerous on kick re
turns. Both he and Mitchell have
a habit of shaking off all but the
most jarring tackles.
At fullback, both Boh Monroe
and Junior Coffey excel as power
runners. Coffey rambled 43 yards
through the middle to score
Washington’s first touchdown
against Oregon State last week.
Both men can be counted on for
needed short yardage.
Bulwarking the line Is 225-
pound center Ray Mansfield. A
candidate for All-American hon
ors, Mansfield has a reputation of
being a heady defender who
knows where the play is going.

THE ONLY spots where the
Huskies are hurting is at quar
terback, with neither Pete Older
nor Bill Siler throwing the pig
skin much. In four games, they
have completed nine of 17 passes.
Siler is a running threat, though.
He has averaged 3.4 yards per
carry and last year at a halfback
ran 44 yards against Stanford for
the clinching touchdown as the
Indians lost, 13-0.
Defensively, Washington is tops
in the AAWU. Against four op
ponents, the line has been cracked
for an average of only 135 yards
per game and two touchdowns.
EVEN MOKE unyielding is the
pass defense. A speedy secondary,
led by Whitmeyer. has allowed a
meager 73 yards per game on the
average, most of it to Oregon
State’s Terry Baker-Vern Burke
I combination that wrecked Stan
i ford two weeks ago. They have
j also picked off nine interceptions,
best in the AAWU.
Where the Huskies have been
hurt most this year is on short
passes, trap plays up the middle,
and quarterback keepers. How
ever, many of these plays were
against the second and third
string in the 28-7 victory over
Illinois and the 41-0 rout of Kan
sas State.
The Huskies must beat Stan
ford in order to have any chance
at all of being in Pasadena on
New Year’s Day. Coach Owens
has a reputation for getting his
teams “up” for crucial games,
and Stanford will have to be at
peak performance to beat them.

nor Bill Siler throwing the pig
skin much. In four games, they
have completed nine of 17 passes.
Siler is a running threat, though.
He has averaged 3.4 yards per
carry and last year at a halfback
ran 44 yards against Stanford for
the clinching touchdown as the
Indians lost, 13-0.
Defensively, Washington is tops
in the AAWU. Against four op
ponents, the line has been cracked
for an average of only 135 yards
per game and two touchdowns.
EVEN MOKE unyielding is the
pass defense. A speedy secondary,
led by Whitmeyer. has allowed a
meager 73 yards per game on the
average, most of it to Oregon
State’s Terry Baker-Vern Burke
I combination that wrecked Stan
i ford two weeks ago. They have
j also picked off nine interceptions,
best in the AAWU.
Where the Huskies have been
hurt most this year is on short
passes, trap plays up the middle,
and quarterback keepers. How
ever, many of these plays were
against the second and third
string in the 28-7 victory over
Illinois and the 41-0 rout of Kan
sas State.
The Huskies must beat Stan
ford in order to have any chance
at all of being in Pasadena on
New Year’s Day. Coach Owens
has a reputation for getting his
teams “up” for crucial games,
and Stanford will have to be at
peak performance to beat them.

One of the most potent ground
attacks seen on the West Coast
in recent years will come barrel
ing into Stanford Stadium Satur
day as Washington opens its

AAWU football action against the
Indians.
The Huskies are shooting for
their third Rose Bowl in four
years, and they’ve got all the odds
in their favor. Coach Jim Owens
can boast two potential All-
Americans and three-deep talent
at nearly every position.
Stanford assistant coach Dutch
Fehring returned this week after
watching the Huskies edge Ore
gon State, 14-13, and reports that
Washington has tremendous

depth, a speedy backfield and an [
experienced line.
HEADING THE explosive Hus
ky backs is halfback Charlie
Mitchell, a 5-11, 182-pound speed
ster whose powerful legs have
earned him a two-year rushing
average of 5.4 yards. He has
scored on runs of 90, 85, 63, and
59 yards and is dangerous every
time he lays hands on the hall.
Backing up Mitchell is Nat
Whitmeyer, a crazy-legs runner
and very dangerous on kick re
turns. Both he and Mitchell have
a habit of shaking off all but the
most jarring tackles.
At fullback, both Boh Monroe
and Junior Coffey excel as power
runners. Coffey rambled 43 yards
through the middle to score
Washington’s first touchdown
against Oregon State last week.
Both men can be counted on for
needed short yardage.
Bulwarking the line Is 225-
pound center Ray Mansfield. A
candidate for All-American hon
ors, Mansfield has a reputation of
being a heady defender who
knows where the play is going.

THE ONLY spots where the
Huskies are hurting is at quar
terback, with neither Pete Older
nor Bill Siler throwing the pig
skin much. In four games, they
have completed nine of 17 passes.
