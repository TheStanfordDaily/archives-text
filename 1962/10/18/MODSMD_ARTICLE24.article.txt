## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford and Stu Rawlings
trumped Menlo College 7-0 in a
non-league contest played yester
day on the Card field.
Rawlings was busier than a
sweeper at a livestock show in
the Cow Palace, scoring six times.
He tallied at least once in every
quarter, both baiting in shots
| missed by teammates, and taking
advantage of perfect setup
I passes.
He scored twice in the first
quarter, the second lime with the
aid of a good corner kick by Ken
Stevens. Don Griffith broke, up
Rawlings’ monopoly on Stanford
scoring late in the first quarter
by wheeling in front of a Menlo
defender and left-footing the ball
in, making it 3-0.

It was 4-0 at halftime, as Rawl
ings scored after receiving Ed
Clark’s setup. It was two scores
in the third period for the Stan
ford center-forward, with the as
sisting passes coming from A1
Nnoli and Stevens again. Another
Rawlings goal in the fourth quar
ter made it the final 7-0.
Goalie Kent Mueller had only
one tough chance, as the Card
backfield never allowed Menlo to
even get the hall inside the Stan
ford penalty area. Backs Sandy
Pofahl, Rich Lonergan, Bill
Teusch, Jim Armstrong and Don
Burr gave Mueller a chance to
take it easy.
Stanford’s next game is Satur
day on the Stanford field with the
same Menlo College team.
