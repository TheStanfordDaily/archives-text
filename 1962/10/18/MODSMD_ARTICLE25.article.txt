# Water Poloists Win 7th Straight, Blank S.F. State
## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
Yesterday afternoon the Stan
ford water polo team bewildered
San Francisco State 17-0, thereby
increasing their unbeaten string
to seven in a row. A shut out in
water polo is as rare as a no
hitter in baseball.
The outclassed San Francisco
State team had but 12 shots on
on the Stanford goal and made a
serious scoring threat only once.
Marty Hull led the Tribe scoring
with four goals, Pete Pettigrew,
Don Buehler, and Ron Kovas
threw in two apiece.
Stanford led 2 to 0 within the
first two minutes of playing time.
The Indians’ first goal came on
a beautifully executed play, the
final pass going from Pettigrew
to Lorton, who beat the goalie
with a quick shot from directly
in front of the cage. Pettigrew
scored the second goal on a fast
1 break by merely outswimming
the San Francisco State team and
banging the ball by the hapless
goalie.
Stanford’s entire squad played
aggressively, continually beating
j their opponents to the ball and
i then in turn only infrequently al
i lowing the opposition to pass mid
| pool. San Francisco State was
: inept at best. Their only success
! ful defensive maneuver was to
! foul the Tribe players as they
! were about to shoot, but then
j this was not particularly effica
j cions either because Stanford
| would invariably score on the
penalty shot.
