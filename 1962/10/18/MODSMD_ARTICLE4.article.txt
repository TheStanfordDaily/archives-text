# 'Data' Assists on Personal Basis
## 
### VIRGINIA JOHNSTON 
Americans often feel that as in
dividuals they cannot contribute
significantly to the improvement
of international relations. We are
not only satisfied with the knowl
edge that the United States gov
ernment is striving for better re
lations, but we are often un
aware of the need which develop
ing countries have for individual
technological assistance to solve
economic and other problems out
side the strictly political sphere.
DATA INTERNA TIONAL,
which has its central headquar
ters here in Palo Alto, is a non
profit organization dedicated to
assisting our world neighbors on
a person-to-person basis. The As
sistance Corps, founded in 1958
by Wil Rose, is made up of con
sultants, sponsors, and represen
tatives in more than 80 different
countries.
The representatives are U.S,
citizens who find problems afflict
ing nationals of their host coun
tries and who volunteer to obtain
solutions from consultants in
America. They send the problems
to a team of consultants, com
posed of specialists, professional
men, and ordinary individuals
with specific knowledge in certain

areas.
THE PROBLEMS are analyzed
and three solutions for each prob
lem are proposed, from which the
nationals can chose the most de
sirable one. Then the representa
tives help to put the solutions
into operation at no cost or obli
gation to the nationals. The spon
sors are a vital part of the or
ganization since they provide the
necessary financial support.
According to its president Wil
Rose, DATA International is
founded on the ‘belief in the pow
er of voluntary combined effort
in worthwhile projects designed
to meet specific needs.’ These
needs may pertain directly to an
individual or they may influence

an entire tribe or nation.
FOR EXAMPLE, suggestions
were made for erecting and equip
ing a radio station in Africa; at
Kuluva Hospital in Uganda a
“constant” refrigeration system
was devised for the blood bank;
and in Mexico the fndians were
introduced to a crop which is pro
ductive at an altitude of 6,600
feet.
Hundreds of similar problems
have been solved through the
concern of individual Americans
and corporations of large re
sources who participate in DATA.
They have found a means by
which they can take an active
part in the campaign to aid our
international neighbors.
