# Nixon, Brown: Catastrophe?
## 
### 
An open debate on the topic,
“Resolved, that the election of
Nixon would be an even greater
catastrophe than the re-election
of Brown,” will be held Thurs
day, Oct. 25, at 7:30 in room 282
(small lounge) of the Union.
This is the first of a series of
open debates, patterned after the
famous Oxford Union debates,
and sponsored by the Speech As
sociation.
According to Mike Hall, direc
tor of the series, each program
will begin with two speakers for
the resolution and two against it,
each speaker having from eight
to ten minutes for his presenta
tion.
THIS Will, BE followed by a
number of brief impromptu
speeches from the floor, pro and
con speakers alternating. Finally
a vote will be taken on the propo
sition.
Hall said that the Oxford Un
ion debate, in the so-called “parli
amentary style,” usually provid
es much more interesting con
tests than the usual American
approach to debating.
The speaker can be interrupted
and questioned by interested
members of the audience and
there tends to be more informali
ty and clash in the contest.
' SINCE THE debate can be
stopped at any point for ques
tioning by the audience, the
speakers must emphasize clarity
and directness of argument.
The speakers for the regular
part of the first debate will not
be announced until next week,
but Hall said that there is a
strong possibility that conserva
tive “Shell” Republicans will join
anti-Nixon liberals on the affirm
ative team.
Topics and dates of other de
bates in the series will be an
nounced later.
