# Katz Proposes Student Research, Teaching
## 
### 
Many college freshmen should
have an opportunity to do re
search, while selected seniors
might well try classroom teach
ing, Stanford Professor Joseph
Katz suggested at a Minneapolis
meeting last week.
Under proper faculty super
vision, these changes could con
vert students from passive con
sumers of education to active
learners, ho said.
A VISITING professor of phi
losophy, Katz serves as research
coordinator for the Institute for
the Study of Human Problems
and contributed several chapters
to a recent volume on “The Amer
ican College.”
In many universities, the em
phasis on specialized subject mat
ter makes it extremely difficult
for the student to integrate intel
ligence with common life, Katz
said. “The student finds intellec
tual tasks set before him in a
fairly exacting fashion, demand
ing a high level of performance
but giving him insufficient op
portunities to develop his own
independent thinking. We are
dominated by the assignment and

‘covering’ approach.”
“Curricular offering in many
subjects ask too much of tlie stu
dent too soon,” ho added. "Wo as
sume that students must become
acquainted with voluminous ele
ments in a particular field before
they can be trusted to develop
some more independent ideas and
pursuits. This is putting the cart
before the horse.
“RESEARCH, instead of com
ing last, should come first. It is
particularly important for fresh
men to be able to do their own
independent research, to find out
what discovery can bo like, and
to develop some of their own
styles and interests in discovery.
“Obviously, we would not ex
pect performance on the level of
the mature investigator, though
I would wager that often enough
freshmen would surprise us with
their sagacity and ingenuity.”
Too often, colleges fail to mesh
their intellectual demands with
the emotional needs of the stu
dents, Katz suggested. “Colleges
are very good at helping turn out
specialists in this or that intellec
tual occupation. But they arc not
very efficient in making intelli
gent reflectiveness and aware

ness a really vital ingredient in
their students’ post-college life.
“STUDENTS NEED to take a
much more active part in their
education. The student needs to
become a teacher of himself, and
he often teaches himself best by
teaching others.”
At the junior and senior level,
Katz said, students with special
interests and abilities in a partic
ular subject—economics, for ex
ample might be given a chance
to teach those less interested in
leh same field, under faculty su
pervision.
“There is no better way to
learn a subject matter than to
teach it,” he said. “Student-teach
ers would, incidentally, find that
they have a new appreciation for
their professors. And, to the ex
tent that they become supervisors
of other teachers and resource
persons, professors would find
themselves pursued by students,
rather than being in pursuit of
them.”
Both changes might diminish
the gap between professors who
complain about apathetic stu
dents and undergraduates who
feel victims of professorial dull
ness, Katz concluded.
