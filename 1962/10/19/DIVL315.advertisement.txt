engineers:
IS INDIVIDUALITY
IMPORTANT
TO YOUR FUTURE?
At EMERSON ELECTRIC you enjoy Individuality without
sacrificing security. Emerson believes in individuality, encourages
it by working philosophy and attitude. Engineers with ideas are
not only provided facilities to pursue those ideas—but are allowed
to see the idea through to finish. Consider the actual experience
of engineer Don Mertens below and decide whether or not you’d
like to know more about Emerson.
Engineer Don Mertens ’
experience shows that
“Think Freedom” is a
reality at Emerson
Don Mertens came to Emerson Electric three
years ago fresh from college and anxious to
explore the challenge of basic research. He
was placed in the Special Devices Group. Here
he was given problems, rather than tasks to
work on.
In an atmosphere of individual effort, sup
ported by small-team operation, Don was able
almost immediately to demonstrate his abil
ities and achieve personal recognition.
His second challenge—to devise a scoring
device for a radar directed fire-control system
—proved his talents. He conceived, proposed,
developed and brought to successful com
pletion, a magnetic scoring device. Other
projects and successes followed quickly.
Emerson's policy of allowing engineers to
range, to develop their own individual abilities,
to carry through projects to the end, has helped
Don Mertens achieve an outstanding record.
Today, at 25, he is project engineer on a
program developing a high-resolution radar
involving advanced concepts. Don Mertens
wanted the opportunity to explore and demon
strate his personal talents. Emerson provided
that opportunity within an atmosphere of
"think freedom." Both have benefited. Is this
the kind of opportunity you want, too?
