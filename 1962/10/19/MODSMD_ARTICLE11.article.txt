# Spitz Sees Da Vinci As 'Cultural Symbol'
## 
### 
Leonardo da Vinci could never
have suspected that he would be
come a cultural symbol, destined
to have a tremendous influence
as an approachable ideal in later
European history. The prominent
theme of Leonardo’s notebooks is
the vanity of man’s “aspiration
for fame’’ in the face of “ail-rav
ishing times.”
These were the words of Dr.
Lewis Spitz yesterday afternoon
before an over-flow crowd of 150
in Tresidder Union.

Illegitimate son of a well-to-do
Florentine, from whom he in
herited “robust physique, dynam
ism. and—according to Sigmund
Freud a certain complex, and a
mother who was “the Maude Mul
ler of the fifteenth century,”

Leonardo worked, felt, and poli
ticked until he had filled the mold
of the Renaissance Man—artist,
intellectual, great scientist.
THE MAN who painted "The
Last Supper,” built war ma
chines, and carried on a running
controversy with the dour Mi
chelangelo, also managed to in
vent a flying machine and to dis
cover cholesterol.
Less known is Leonardo’s place
in intellectual history. Ho was no
rebel against neo-Platonism, as
had been previously thought hut
rather a flexible-minded synthe
sizer in command of the best of
Renaissance thought, versed in
the greatest of the classics, and in
sympathy with Nicholas Cusanus’
Scholasticism.
Impressed with the Aristotelian
notion of physical momentum—
“that it is the medium that keeps
a projectile in motion,” he was
undoubtedly familiar with the
newer ideas of the fourteenth
century Franciscans.
IN Leonardo’s moral character
there were “shadows of the dark
and the white.” He was able to
study with concern the physiolo
gy of senility and to speculate on
man's place in the infinite. Yet,
said Spitz, “it comes as something
of a shock—especially to the
young that Leonardo would
have sold out to such a notorious
condotierre as Ludovico II Moro.”
Once sponsored by Lorenzo the
Magnificent, Leonardo found no
difficulty in offering his services
to Caesar Borgia when the times
demanded it.
The old romantic theory that
Leonardo was just a mature boy
simply does not stand up under
scrutiny.
Dr. Spitz introduced Dr. Susan
V. Lenkey, former professor of
art history at the University of
Budapest and now senior librari
an at the Bender Library at Stan
ford. Dr. Lenkey spoke about her
recent discovery, a Leonardo self
portrait, previously attributed to
Leonardo’s teacher, Verrocchio.

chelangelo, also managed to in
vent a flying machine and to dis
cover cholesterol.
Less known is Leonardo’s place
in intellectual history. Ho was no
rebel against neo-Platonism, as
had been previously thought hut
rather a flexible-minded synthe
sizer in command of the best of
Renaissance thought, versed in
the greatest of the classics, and in
sympathy with Nicholas Cusanus’
Scholasticism.
Impressed with the Aristotelian
notion of physical momentum—
“that it is the medium that keeps
a projectile in motion,” he was
undoubtedly familiar with the
newer ideas of the fourteenth
century Franciscans.
IN Leonardo’s moral character
there were “shadows of the dark
and the white.” He was able to
study with concern the physiolo
gy of senility and to speculate on
man's place in the infinite. Yet,
said Spitz, “it comes as something
of a shock—especially to the
young that Leonardo would
have sold out to such a notorious
condotierre as Ludovico II Moro.”
Once sponsored by Lorenzo the
Magnificent, Leonardo found no
difficulty in offering his services
to Caesar Borgia when the times
demanded it.
The old romantic theory that
Leonardo was just a mature boy
simply does not stand up under
scrutiny.
Dr. Spitz introduced Dr. Susan
V. Lenkey, former professor of
art history at the University of
Budapest and now senior librari
an at the Bender Library at Stan
ford. Dr. Lenkey spoke about her
recent discovery, a Leonardo self
portrait, previously attributed to
Leonardo’s teacher, Verrocchio.
Leonardo da Vinci could never
have suspected that he would be
come a cultural symbol, destined
to have a tremendous influence
as an approachable ideal in later
European history. The prominent
theme of Leonardo’s notebooks is
the vanity of man’s “aspiration
for fame’’ in the face of “ail-rav
ishing times.”
These were the words of Dr.
Lewis Spitz yesterday afternoon
before an over-flow crowd of 150
in Tresidder Union.

Illegitimate son of a well-to-do
Florentine, from whom he in
herited “robust physique, dynam
ism. and—according to Sigmund
Freud a certain complex, and a
mother who was “the Maude Mul
ler of the fifteenth century,”

Leonardo worked, felt, and poli
ticked until he had filled the mold
of the Renaissance Man—artist,
intellectual, great scientist.

Last Supper,” built war ma

controversy with the dour Mi
