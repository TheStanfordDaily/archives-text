# LASSU Votes 'Desegregation'
## 
### 
Falling two votes short of the
two-thirds majority required to
rescind a previous decision, Leg
islature last night failed to repeal
last wreck’s stand encouraging de
segregation of the rooting section.
Twelve members voted to re
scind, nine voted against; 14 votes
w'cre required to rescind last
week’s decision.
A motion “to recommend the
continued segregation of the
rooting section" was defeated.
13-9.
The situation regarding the
rooting section, as a result of
Legislature's decision last week,
are as follows:
• The sign at the entrance to
the rooting section indicating sep
arate seating for male and female
students will bo removed.
• Women wdll not be prevent
ed from taking seats in what is
presently the men’s rooting sec
tion if they so desire.
It was pointed out during the
discussion that Legislature’s de
cision could not prevent male stu
dents from yelling “out, out. out,”
if a female student should enter
the male section.
It was also pointed out that
misconduct in the rooting section
would bo prosecuted, as in the
past, via the Fundamental Stan
dard.
