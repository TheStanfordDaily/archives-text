## 'Juvenile Enthusiasm' Root of Cuba Problem? 
### ANTONIO ARMELLINI

Over the last couple of years
the Castro regime, to most Amer
icans’ surprise, has been drifting
more and more towards the so
cialist bloc, thus constituting a
very dangerous and attractive ex
ample for other Latin-American
leaders eager to play revolution.
After last year’s unfortunate
(and indeed very badly organiz
ed) attempted invasion, the situ
ation has now got to a point
where a number of American
Senators and Congressmen ask
for an immediate invasion, and a
substantial number of others op
pose it ... at the moment.
THERE HAS been much talk
recently about the existence of
missile bases manned by Russian
experts and of training camps for
colored troops (Ghanaian?)
which could be employed to insti
gated riots among the extremely
poor colored sections of the Latin
American populations. Indeed
some military build-up has been
going on in Cuba and the pres
ence of Soviet “technicians” is
beyond doubt, but is this a suffi
cient motive for an armed inva
sion by the United States? The
Monroe Doctrine has been vio
lated but, as the great variety of
opinions expressed by the Latin
American countries on this issue
has fully demonstrated, it can ho
discussed whether this theory has
retained intact its original force
throughout the years. ... In ad
dition to this, such an action
would have a disastrous effect on
the neutral countries and would
hand to the Soviet Union on a
silver platter a perfect pr opagan
da issue.

I have tried to compare the
present situation in the United
States with that which has for
many years confronted the Euro
pean countries. It is beyond doubt
that the problem is viewed from
a different perspective on the two
sides of the Atlantic, probably
because of the different historical
relationship with the socialist
phenomenon.
The social revolutions of the
XIX and XX century in Europe

arose from the strong desire of a
large strata of the populations
(which did not include solely the
members of the labour class) to
react in some way against the in
credible injustices that the abso
lutely liberalistic system author
ized. The objection to the fact
that this reaction culminated in
extremely violent clashes could
perhaps be answered by pointing
out that sometimes an extreme
situation demands an extreme so
lution. On the other hand, the
United States has never faced
this problem to the same extent.
Probably the extremely fast de
velopment of industry made it
possible for the private investors
to satisfy with a relatively mod
est economic sacrifice the de
mands of the working class, thus
avoiding a far more dangerous
and costly clash.
IN EUROPE, communism is an
everyday threat: many countries
not only border with the Soviet
Bloc, but have to face as well a
powerful and strongly organized
communist party at home. It is
perhaps for this reason that com
munism and all the problems con
nected with it are approached in
a rather less emotional way than
in this country. The United
States has never before been
forced to deal with a communist
country located just off its own
shores, and therefore it is possi
ble that this is causing in the
United States a concern far more
serious than the situation would
actually justify.

It may not appear too strange
therefore to hint that this could
be just a problem of “juvenile
enthusiasm.” The American pub
lic opinion has been caught some
what unprepared and is now pay
ing for its own mistake although,
to (he great pleasure of the allies
of the U.S., the Kennedy Adminis
tration has adopted a responsible
attitude towards this problem.
The solution lies perhaps here,
and it is quite probable that if
the whole nation faced it from a
rational rather than an emotional
point of view, the problem could
be. if not solved, at least brought
back to its real dimensions. It is
here that the core of the Cuban
problem lies and it is from here,
and perhaps only from here, that
it will be possible to devise an
honorable solution for both sides.
