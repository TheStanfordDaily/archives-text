# Letters to the Editor

Editor, The Daily:
I have enjoyed The Daily very
much since becoming a student
in this very fine institution
scarcely three weeks ago. For
the first two weeks I read the
whole paper, but lately I have
found it sufficient, and extreme
ly enjoyable, to merely read the
“Letters to the Editor” column.
What a magnificent display of
writing. I feel I may be getting
the news slightly later this way,
waiting for someone to write a
comment on a previous article,
but since all the suggestions and
proposals are ever present yet
seldom materialize, I suppose I’m
not too far behind at that.
How grateful I am for this
column to keep me, a poor, be
wildered, new student, informed
of the current student activities
and attitudes! For example in
last Monday’s paper I was shock
ed into reality by some typical
people thinking that indeed, there
are “bad elements” among us!
These five students (or what
ever) make bold to cut at the stu
dent legislature, the student body
president, the “I” club president

and his backers (with reserva
tion), The Daily itself, and Stan
ford in France. How fortunate
are we that these people “notice”
all these faults, and so bravely
expose them. Other past letters
have dug at poor Russ McKinney,
journalist Heiner Gautschy, Wal
ter Lippmann, Messrs, Landau
and Eisenberg, the whole audi
ence at the concert of Professor
Aldrich, the “pusillanimous ig
noramus who tried-and failed-to
lead the card stunts” at the Ore
gon State game, the head cheer
leader, Chief Davis and the bi
cycle paths on Palm Ave., Mr.
Weinig, ail liquor-drinking stu
dents, and poor old Armin a cou
ple more times. A few more
weeks here and one might get the
idea that some people aren’t too
happy with certain other people
around here.
But I certainly want to fit into
this University like all these
“typical” students, these construc
tively - critical, good-for-society
people, so may I take this oppor
tunity to say: “I don’t like any
one.”

all these faults, and so bravely
expose them. Other past letters
have dug at poor Russ McKinney,
journalist Heiner Gautschy, Wal

Aldrich, the “pusillanimous ig

lead the card stunts” at the Ore

weeks here and one might get the
idea that some people aren’t too
happy with certain other people
around here.
But I certainly want to fit into
this University like all these
“typical” students, these construc
tively - critical, good-for-society
people, so may I take this oppor

one.”
Chuck Amrhein
Editor, The Daily:
I have enjoyed The Daily very
much since becoming a student
in this very fine institution
scarcely three weeks ago. For
the first two weeks I read the
whole paper, but lately I have
found it sufficient, and extreme
ly enjoyable, to merely read the
“Letters to the Editor” column.
What a magnificent display of
writing. I feel I may be getting
the news slightly later this way,
waiting for someone to write a
comment on a previous article,
but since all the suggestions and
proposals are ever present yet
seldom materialize, I suppose I’m
not too far behind at that.
How grateful I am for this
column to keep me, a poor, be
wildered, new student, informed
of the current student activities
and attitudes! For example in
last Monday’s paper I was shock
ed into reality by some typical
people thinking that indeed, there
are “bad elements” among us!
These five students (or what
ever) make bold to cut at the stu
dent legislature, the student body
president, the “I” club president

and his backers (with reserva
tion), The Daily itself, and Stan
ford in France. How fortunate
are we that these people “notice”
all these faults, and so bravely
expose them. Other past letters
