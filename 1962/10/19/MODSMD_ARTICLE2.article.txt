# Dean Evaluates Committee Set-up

### 
There will be increased student
participation in University admin
istrative committees, H. Donald
Winbigler, dean of Students, said
at yesterday’s meeting of the
AWS Board and Cabinet in Bow
man Alumni House.
“In the last six months there
has been an effort to find ways
and means of providing student
participation in a wider area,” the
Dean said. The appointment by
President J. E. Wallace Sterling
of five full-fledged, voting stu
dent members of the faculty’s
Committee on Student Affairs
and Services has been a direct re
sult of this concern.
Although student membership
on Academic Council committees
is restricted by the ASSU Consti
tution, students have previously
participated ad hoc on such facul
ty committees as Public Exer
cises. Winbigler said. With no
such restrictions placed on admin
istrative committees, both stu
dents and faculty have been work
ing together on the Union Com
mittee and the Athletic Board.
