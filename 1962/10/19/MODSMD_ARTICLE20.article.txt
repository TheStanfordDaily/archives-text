## Standing Firm in Showdown Cannot Solve Berlin Problem 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The American decision to act in Berlin without unanimous
agreement by all the Allies, provided West Germany cooperates, could
be highly important. There is some doubt about it because of the
interview given on Tuesday to a German newspaper by the Defense
Minister, Franz Joseph Strauss. The full text is not available as I

write, but Herr Strauss appears-t
to say that Germany will hold
back unless all the occupying
powers plus NATO have first
committed themselves in a con
flict. This uncertainty will have
to be cleared up if the commit
ment on Berlin is to be fully acti
vated.
Probably it will be cleared up.
But, as important as this would
be, it would not be enough. Stand
ing firm in a showdown will not
solve the Berlin problem, which
is how to guarantee a good life
of democratic freedom to half a
city over a hundred miles deep
inside the Communist world.
Either before a showdown or aft
er it. it will be necessary to re
sume the negotiations with the
Soviet Union which have been
stalled since last spring.

the Soviet Union and the West,
and it is inconceivable that the
Soviet Union will, while it has the
power to prevent it, agree to a
united Germany of 70 million peo
ple within the NATO alliance.
Indeed, the official view of re
unification is so patently impos
sible that, when it is put forward
by responsible statesmen, it
arouses suspicions. To propose
reunification on what are known
to be impossible terms is in fact
not to propose reunification at all.
AM) IN TRUTH, Dr. Adenau
er’s great friend, Gen. de Gaulle,
is not in favor of German reunifi
cation and avoided the discussion
of it during his recent tour of
Germany. The British govern
ment is, to put it mildly, reluc
tant to see Germany reunited.
The Low Countries do not want
reunification, and it would be dif
ficult to say with much certainty
that Dr. Adenauer, who is an anti-
Prussian from the Rhineland, has
any burning desire to bo reunited
with the Prussians and the Sax
ons.
It can surely be said that the
official formula of reunification
by plebiscite is an obstacle to the
reunification of Germany, not a
method of achieving it. That may
be one of the reasons why so
many people who do not want a
big Germany pay lip service to it.
Yet, despite the unavowed but
very general objections to Ger
man reunification, I for one be
lieve that the two Germanys must
be and should be reunited. How?
Once we fix it in our minds that
the two Germanys cannot be re
united by Soviet surrender, the
only conceivable way, I submit,
is to start from the situation as
it is. This means recognizing that
there are two German states, and
then providing ways and means
by which they can live side by
side and, as Germans with Ger
mans, work out in detail and by
concrete experience their national
unity. As I see it, the two Ger
manys are a cloth which has been
torn apart. The task of reunifica
tion is to reweave into one whole
the two unsightly parts.

The negotia
tions, of course,
have no chance
to succeed with
out the consent
and collabora
tion of the West
German govern
ment. For this is,
we must never
forget, not only
a Soviet and an

Allied problem. It is primarily a
German problem.
Yet there is not now a true po
litical understanding about the
future of Berlin and of Germany
between Bonn and Washington.
We must hope the basis of such
an understanding can be laid
down during Chancellor’s Ade
nauer’s coming visit to Washing
ton and that the understanding
can be worked out while he is
still the German Chancellor.
THE PARAMOUNT issue upon
which significant negotiations de
pend and around which they will
revolve is the degree of recogni
tion which the Western allies will
accord to the East Gorman state.
Western withdrawal from Berlin
is not, as we have all said again
and again, a negotiable question.
But the degree of recognition of
and the kind of relationship with
East Germany are eminently ne
gotiable questions.
Thus, commercial surface traf
fic with West Berlin has for years
been regulated by a Bonn-Pankow
trade agreement and has been ad
ministered by East German offi
cials. It is sheer nonsense, there
fore, to talk as if there has been
or could be such a thing as abso
lute non-recognition. The practi
cal question is how much more
recognition and of what kind
there is to be.
It is fashionable to treat any
further recognition of East Ger
any as a concession made at the
expense of West Germany. I be
lieve this to be a fallacy, and I
submit that it is only by increas
ing economic, scientific, social,
and political contact that the two
Germanys can eventually be re
united peaceably.
THE OFFICIAL view is that
East Germany must have no rec
ognition which implies that it is
in fact a state, and that no coun
try anywhere in the world (ex
cept the Soviet Union itself) may
have an ambassador in Bonn if it
also sends an ambassador to Pan
kow. The official view of reuni
fication is that East Germany is
to be given the chance to vote it
self out of the Communist orbit
and out of the Soviet alliance in
order to join West Germany and
the Western Alliance.
This is, and always has been, a
pipe dream, and nobody who has
ever been to Germany or has

recognition and of what kind

not to propose reunification at all.

AM) IN TRUTH, Dr. Adenau

of it during his recent tour of
Germany. The British govern

Prussian from the Rhineland, has
any burning desire to bo reunited

It can surely be said that the

very general objections to Ger

Once we fix it in our minds that

only conceivable way, I submit,

it is. This means recognizing that
there are two German states, and
then providing ways and means
by which they can live side by
side and, as Germans with Ger
mans, work out in detail and by
concrete experience their national

torn apart. The task of reunifica

nauer’s coming visit to Washing
ton and that the understanding
can be worked out while he is
still the German Chancellor.
THE PARAMOUNT issue upon
which significant negotiations de
pend and around which they will
revolve is the degree of recogni
tion which the Western allies will
accord to the East Gorman state.
Western withdrawal from Berlin
is not, as we have all said again
and again, a negotiable question.
But the degree of recognition of
and the kind of relationship with
East Germany are eminently ne
gotiable questions.
Thus, commercial surface traf

been regulated by a Bonn-Pankow
trade agreement and has been ad
ministered by East German offi
cials. It is sheer nonsense, there

or could be such a thing as abso

recognition and of what kind
there is to be.
It is fashionable to treat any
further recognition of East Ger

expense of West Germany. I be
lieve this to be a fallacy, and I
submit that it is only by increas

and political contact that the two
Germanys can eventually be re
united peaceably.
THE OFFICIAL view is that
East Germany must have no rec
ognition which implies that it is
in fact a state, and that no coun
try anywhere in the world (ex
cept the Soviet Union itself) may
have an ambassador in Bonn if it
also sends an ambassador to Pan
kow. The official view of reuni
fication is that East Germany is
to be given the chance to vote it
self out of the Communist orbit
and out of the Soviet alliance in
order to join West Germany and
the Western Alliance.
This is, and always has been, a
pipe dream, and nobody who has
ever been to Germany or has
studied the German question be
lieves that there is anything in
it. The world is rent by a mo
