Editor, The Daily:
Recently several letters to The
Daily have taken various stands
on the question of rooting section
integration. Points raised in the
letter from the thirteen women
students in Wednesday’s edition
are of particular interest.
They suggest that students
without dates would feel uncom
fortable in an integrated situa
tion, yet in years of sitting in in
tegrated sections I have yet to
find one uncomfortable dateless
person. Their “arbitarary boy
girl-boy-girl” suggestion is ab
surd to anyone, pro or con, and
in no way helps their argument.
Besides, were the section deseg
regated, the new policy would not
have to be as arbitrarily enforced
as the present situation demands.
The young ladies point out that
there is already an integrated
section in our spacious stadium,
and they are right. But is it on
the fifty-yard line? Or even the
forty-yard line? I’ve no objection
to segregation, but there is a
fairer way of managing it. Let’s
put the integrated section on the
fifty-yard line and let the segre
gationists enforce their exclusive
ness down the line where they
won't interfere with the rights of
those who paid the same price to
watch the game from the rooting
section. Daniel Logan
