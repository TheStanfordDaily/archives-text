# EUROPE UNITED
## Nationalism Must Die Out Before Union 
### WILLIAM QUANDT IIR Political Analyst 
The impasse that had been
reached in the political integra
tion of Europe, as seen in the im
potence of the Council of Europe,
gave rise to the more modest hope
of functional cooperation based
on economic interests.
The necessity of drawing West
Germany back into the European
economic system seemed especial
ly pressing, and it is to the credit
of Robert Schuman, French For
eign Minister, that he saw this
need. In 1950, at the suggestion
of Jean Monnet, Schuman sug
gested placing French-German
coal and steel production under a
common High Authority, in an
organization that would be open
to other European nations.
The European Coal and Steel
Community (ECSC) was con
sciously conceived of as “a first
step in the direction of European
federation.” Schuman stated at
the time that ECSC contained
“potentialities that cannot yet be
fully measured, but which will
rapidly lead us on towards the
complete economic and political
unification of Europe.”
GERMANY, France, Italy, and
the Benelux countries accepted
the Schuman Plan. Britain, how
ever, refused, since she could not
agree to executive control by an
independent High Authority with
supranational, though limited,
powers.
The next European institution
to be considered was the Euro
pean Defense Community (EDC).
The outbreak of the Korean war
in 1950 had focused attention
again on military problems. Fear
ing the outbreak of a general war,
Churchill and Reynaud proposed
to the Council of Europe the cre
ation of a unified European
Army. The Plevan Plan, as this
soon came to be called, led di
rectly to the treaty creating EDC.
By summer of 1953 the integra
tion of the six of “Little Europe”
seemed underway, although the
EDC had not yet been accepted
by all the national parliaments.
Soon, however, there came a dis
tinct shift in tempo, for the de
tente in Europe and the localiza
tion of the war in Korea were
creating a false sense of security.
This belief that the cold war was
coming to an end was further
heightened by the death of Stalin.
No longer feeling the urgent need
for a defense community, the
French parliament rejected EDC.
The cause of European integra
tion had been visibly shaken.
ALTHOUGH the idea of Eu
rope seemed to be in retreat, un
der the pressure of Monnet it
soon was given a new “elan.” In
1955 the foreign ministers of the
Six met at Messina in order to
study the possibilities of setting
up a customs union and of utiliz
ing atomic energy. The idea of
Atlantic Community was no long
er to be tied to a military plan,
but rather to an economic one of
much greater breadth than ECSC.
The outcome' of the Messina
conference was the establishment
of the European Economic Com
munity (EEC) and Euratom.
Their powers, as described in the
Rome Treaties of 1957, were
more limited than those of ECSC,
but nonetheless important. In or
der to coordinate the various or
ganizations, the European Par
liamentary Assembly was form
ed, upon which rested the possi
bilities and responsibilities of the
unification of Europe.
These moves by the Six toward
tighter economic integration, and
their surprising successes, soon
brought Britain, Scandinavia.
Switzerland, Austria and Portu
gal to band together, in 1959, in a
loose organization for free trade.
The “Outer Seven” however had
little in common and were geo
graphically scattered. Clearly this
venture could not compete with
the Common Market, whose dar
ing and dynamism far outstrip
ped that of the EFTA. Indeed, in
1961 Britain reversed her tradi
tional policy and made her first
overtures toward the Common
Market.
TODAY we see Europe under
going a profound change as she
struggles towards unity. Old na
tionalisms and rivalries must be
overcome, adjustments must be
made, loyalties must he shifted.
But, although the challenge is
great and the problems are com
plex, the choice seems clear. If
Europe is to regain her greatness
in the world it will do so as an
integrated community. What this
may eventually mean to Euro
peans as well as to Americans is
unclear, but there is no turning
back. The uniting of Europe is
already underway.

agree to executive control by an
independent High Authority with
supranational, though limited,
powers.
The next European institution
to be considered was the Euro
pean Defense Community (EDC).
The outbreak of the Korean war
in 1950 had focused attention
again on military problems. Fear
ing the outbreak of a general war,
Churchill and Reynaud proposed
to the Council of Europe the cre
ation of a unified European
Army. The Plevan Plan, as this
soon came to be called, led di
rectly to the treaty creating EDC.
By summer of 1953 the integra
tion of the six of “Little Europe”
seemed underway, although the
EDC had not yet been accepted
by all the national parliaments.
Soon, however, there came a dis
tinct shift in tempo, for the de
tente in Europe and the localiza
tion of the war in Korea were
creating a false sense of security.
This belief that the cold war was
coming to an end was further
heightened by the death of Stalin.
No longer feeling the urgent need
for a defense community, the
French parliament rejected EDC.
The cause of European integra
tion had been visibly shaken.
ALTHOUGH the idea of Eu
rope seemed to be in retreat, un
der the pressure of Monnet it
soon was given a new “elan.” In
1955 the foreign ministers of the
Six met at Messina in order to
study the possibilities of setting
up a customs union and of utiliz
ing atomic energy. The idea of
Atlantic Community was no long
er to be tied to a military plan,
but rather to an economic one of
much greater breadth than ECSC.
The outcome' of the Messina
conference was the establishment
of the European Economic Com
munity (EEC) and Euratom.
Their powers, as described in the
Rome Treaties of 1957, were
more limited than those of ECSC,
but nonetheless important. In or
der to coordinate the various or
ganizations, the European Par
liamentary Assembly was form
ed, upon which rested the possi
bilities and responsibilities of the
unification of Europe.
These moves by the Six toward
tighter economic integration, and
their surprising successes, soon
brought Britain, Scandinavia.
Switzerland, Austria and Portu
gal to band together, in 1959, in a
loose organization for free trade.
The “Outer Seven” however had
little in common and were geo
graphically scattered. Clearly this
venture could not compete with
the Common Market, whose dar
ing and dynamism far outstrip
ped that of the EFTA. Indeed, in
1961 Britain reversed her tradi
tional policy and made her first
overtures toward the Common
Market.
TODAY we see Europe under
going a profound change as she
struggles towards unity. Old na
tionalisms and rivalries must be
overcome, adjustments must be
made, loyalties must he shifted.
But, although the challenge is
great and the problems are com
plex, the choice seems clear. If
Europe is to regain her greatness
in the world it will do so as an
integrated community. What this
may eventually mean to Euro
peans as well as to Americans is
unclear, but there is no turning
back. The uniting of Europe is
already underway.
The impasse that had been
reached in the political integra
tion of Europe, as seen in the im
potence of the Council of Europe,
gave rise to the more modest hope
of functional cooperation based
on economic interests.
The necessity of drawing West
Germany back into the European
economic system seemed especial
ly pressing, and it is to the credit
of Robert Schuman, French For
eign Minister, that he saw this
need. In 1950, at the suggestion
of Jean Monnet, Schuman sug
gested placing French-German
coal and steel production under a
common High Authority, in an
organization that would be open
to other European nations.
The European Coal and Steel
Community (ECSC) was con
sciously conceived of as “a first
step in the direction of European
federation.” Schuman stated at
the time that ECSC contained
“potentialities that cannot yet be
fully measured, but which will
rapidly lead us on towards the
complete economic and political
unification of Europe.”
GERMANY, France, Italy, and
the Benelux countries accepted

ALTHOUGH the idea of Eu
rope seemed to be in retreat, un
der the pressure of Monnet it
soon was given a new “elan.” In
1955 the foreign ministers of the
Six met at Messina in order to
study the possibilities of setting
up a customs union and of utiliz
ing atomic energy. The idea of
Atlantic Community was no long
er to be tied to a military plan,
but rather to an economic one of
much greater breadth than ECSC.
The outcome' of the Messina
conference was the establishment
of the European Economic Com
munity (EEC) and Euratom.
Their powers, as described in the
Rome Treaties of 1957, were
more limited than those of ECSC,
but nonetheless important. In or
der to coordinate the various or
ganizations, the European Par
liamentary Assembly was form
ed, upon which rested the possi
bilities and responsibilities of the
unification of Europe.
These moves by the Six toward
tighter economic integration, and
their surprising successes, soon
brought Britain, Scandinavia.
Switzerland, Austria and Portu
gal to band together, in 1959, in a
loose organization for free trade.
The “Outer Seven” however had
little in common and were geo
graphically scattered. Clearly this
venture could not compete with
the Common Market, whose dar
ing and dynamism far outstrip
ped that of the EFTA. Indeed, in
1961 Britain reversed her tradi
tional policy and made her first
overtures toward the Common
Market.
TODAY we see Europe under
going a profound change as she
struggles towards unity. Old na
tionalisms and rivalries must be
overcome, adjustments must be
made, loyalties must he shifted.
But, although the challenge is
great and the problems are com
plex, the choice seems clear. If
Europe is to regain her greatness
in the world it will do so as an
integrated community. What this
may eventually mean to Euro
peans as well as to Americans is
unclear, but there is no turning
back. The uniting of Europe is
already underway.
The impasse that had been
reached in the political integra
tion of Europe, as seen in the im
potence of the Council of Europe,
gave rise to the more modest hope
of functional cooperation based
on economic interests.
The necessity of drawing West
Germany back into the European
economic system seemed especial
ly pressing, and it is to the credit
of Robert Schuman, French For
eign Minister, that he saw this
need. In 1950, at the suggestion
of Jean Monnet, Schuman sug
gested placing French-German
coal and steel production under a
common High Authority, in an
organization that would be open
to other European nations.
The European Coal and Steel
Community (ECSC) was con
sciously conceived of as “a first
step in the direction of European
federation.” Schuman stated at
the time that ECSC contained
“potentialities that cannot yet be
fully measured, but which will
rapidly lead us on towards the
complete economic and political
unification of Europe.”
GERMANY, France, Italy, and
the Benelux countries accepted
the Schuman Plan. Britain, how
ever, refused, since she could not
agree to executive control by an
independent High Authority with
supranational, though limited,
powers.
The next European institution
to be considered was the Euro
pean Defense Community (EDC).
The outbreak of the Korean war
in 1950 had focused attention
again on military problems. Fear
ing the outbreak of a general war,
Churchill and Reynaud proposed
to the Council of Europe the cre
ation of a unified European
Army. The Plevan Plan, as this
soon came to be called, led di
rectly to the treaty creating EDC.
By summer of 1953 the integra
tion of the six of “Little Europe”
seemed underway, although the
EDC had not yet been accepted
by all the national parliaments.
Soon, however, there came a dis
tinct shift in tempo, for the de
tente in Europe and the localiza
tion of the war in Korea were
creating a false sense of security.
This belief that the cold war was
coming to an end was further
heightened by the death of Stalin.
No longer feeling the urgent need
for a defense community, the
French parliament rejected EDC.
