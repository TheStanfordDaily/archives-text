## Even Though It's in Technicolor, Chapman Report' Worst Movie Ever 
### STEVE ZOUSMER

"The Chapman Report” is that
not unrare type of movie about
which one might comment, “That
is the worst movie I ever saw.”
We often make statements like
this but sooner or later we will
inevitably see a movie which is
indeed the worst. "The Chapman
Report,” a prurient little package
of suburban erotics and erosion,
is a safe nomination. Except for
the technicolor which is rather
pretty.
One of the things you have to
know about this picture is that
there is no deep meaning to
search for. In fact, there is no
meaning at all, deep or not deep.
The big question is: are sex sur
veys good or bad?, and director
George Cukor evidently consider
ed the question so important that
he didn’t bother to answer it.
DR. CHAPMAN, the holier
than-Kinsey leading man, invades
the sexy little town of Bi iarwood
to conduct a study which will
prove that "sex is clean and dig
nified,” no matter how crude or
perverted it may be. The women
of the world have asked, “Are we
abnormal?” and Chapman intends
to reassure them that they are no
less abnormal than any of their
run-of-the-mill nymphomaniacal,
adultering, or frigid neighbors.
Dr. Jonas, Chapman’s big critic,
stands up and says, in effect.
“What about love?” But every
body ignores the old crank and
we zero in on the very effective
bad taste which seems to wow
’em at the box office.
We get a westcrn-civ-fasl sum
mary of the sex histories of four
local belles, whose cases demon
strate that physical sex is good
even if bad. The first case is
Sarah, played by Shelley Winters
at her slobbering best, a Madame
Bovary type who doesn’t get
I enough sex from her unglamor
j ous husband. So she conducts an
affair with her drama coach. She
tells him that their love is sacred;
“Let’s never be rational,” he says,
| squeezing her. She suggests they
run away together; "Let’s be sen
j sible,” she says, lunging for a
cigarette. Then ho dumps on her.
Next is Naomi the Nympho,
portrayed with a deep plunging
| neckline by Clare Bloom. Naomi
| goes wild over a couple of deliv
j ery boys, than a jazz musician,
finally his whole band. She is
desperate and distraught, and her
condition is worsened by the fact
that the boys enjoy harassing her.
She gulps down some booze, then
chugs a bottle of sleeping pills
for an everlasting nightcap,
THIRD in the sex parade is
Teresa (Glynis Johns), a feather
brained arty type who is prompt
ed by the Chapman survey to sus
pect that something is missing in
her Platonic married life. So she
goes to the bookcase, thumbs
through a few pages, and finds
out what she has missed. Then
comes the comic relief which
isn't titanically necessary as she
goes after a football player she
mot on the beach. Ho thinks it’s
really Big Game, with her as the
opposing line backer, and his lum
berjack delicacy convinces her
that she likes her husband better.
Then we move on to the pro
found stuff. Dr. Chapman’s assis
tant Paul (Efram Zimbalist Jr.)
interviews and falls in love with
Kathy, played by Jane Fonda.
Efram-babes is a snowy philoso
pher (“There is an inevitable sad
ness in everyone”), a humble
cuter of lost causes, who advises

that marrying him is the only
way she can lose her frigidity,
and a humanitarian (“Kathy is
more than a statistic to me—l
love her.”). He taunts her by call
ing her a femme de glace, which
can be translated from French to
mean either a "cold woman” or a
"woman of ice-cream.” It makes
no difference to anybody but poor
Paul, who won’t be satisfied until
the ice-woman cometh into his
arms and loving care.
Don’t look for much relation or
thematic direction among these
four case studies. They are just
there for sensation, and (ho ef
fort to salvage some kind of mor
al from them gets tangled up
with the rule of happily-ever-after
and the result is muddled and
half-hearted. Does assistant Paul
agree with Dr. Chapman that a
gratifying physical relationship
is the primary bond of marriage?

Yes. Does he go along with Chap
man’s opponent, Dr. Jonas, who
stresses love over sex? Yes again.
Paul is an accommodating fellow.
The only thing that no one denies
is that “Statistics don’t make
morality.”
Neither does immorality and
calculated bad taste make a
movie. “The Chapman Report” is
a fine example of erotics with an
excuse, or, filth (he family can
enjoy.
