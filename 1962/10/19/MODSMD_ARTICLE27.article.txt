# Indians Hope for MSU Repeat
## 
### PETE KING 
Hoping to spring a few sur
prises of the kind that humbled
mighty Michigan Slate, Stan
ford’s football team takes on a
highly-touted Washington eleven
tomorrow in Stanford Stadium.
Game time is 1 ;30 p.m.

speculating about the gome for
weeks, and interest is high, as
this game represents a major hur
dle on Washington’s path to the
Hose Bowl. Husky coach Jim
Owens has discounted Stanford’s
last two losses, remarking that
the Cards are as strong as ever
and will be “up” for the game.
Stanford coach Jack Curtice is
praying that Owens is right. Last
week, he figured his boys were
all set to beat Washington State,
but was the most frustrated man
on the field when the Indian of
fense managed to sputter out at
crucial moments.
By the law of averages, it’s
Stanford’s turn to get the breaks
this week. Helping the odds con
siderably is the return of center
C. B. Simons and fullback Ken
Babajian to the Tribe lineup.
OUT LAST WI:i:K with a
twisted knee, Simons will have
his work cut out for him against
Washington’s huge center, Ray
Mansfield. However, if C. B. plays
the kind of game he did against
MSU’s All American Dave Behr
man, Mansfield will be in for an
afternoon of hard knocks.

j Babajian, who was missed last I
week against WSU, has a healthy
ankle now and will see lots of ac
tion tomorrow. His ability to
squeeze his compact, 5-7 frame
into even the smallest holes in the
line consistently brought him i
good gains against Michigan I
State.
Although halfback Gary Craig

is still out with a concussion,
sophomore ,1. D. Lodato has been
a standout in recent games and
has earned the starting slot. Lo
dato is the Tribe workhorse, lead
ing the squad in yards gained
this year, and his speed will be
sorely needed against the fleet
Husky backs.
PASSING, long a Stanford
strong point, has been somewhat
less than sensational this year.
Aerials have been dropped and
overthrown, many of the incom
pletes coming on key downs. Cur
tice has been drilling the quarter
backs and ends this week to try
to improve the .397 completion

average.
Yesterday, the results were en- j
eouraging. Ends Chris Jessen and i
Guy Rounsaville snagged some i
beauties off the arms of Steve I
Thurlow and Clark Weaver to
elicit satisfactory grins from the
coaches.
Concerning the opposition, the
Huskies are all healthy with the
exception of halfback Charlie
Mitchell, who got banged around
against Oregon State last week
and may not start, although he’ll
I play. Washington will arrive to
day at noon and begin workouts
| in Stanford Stadium.
THE HUSKIES probably repre
sent I tie pivotal game of tho sea
son for Stanford if the Cards
can win. A loss would pave the
way for a midseason slump simi
lar to last year.

on the field when the Indian of
fense managed to sputter out at
crucial moments.
By the law of averages, it’s
Stanford’s turn to get the breaks
this week. Helping the odds con
siderably is the return of center
C. B. Simons and fullback Ken
Babajian to the Tribe lineup.
OUT LAST WI:i:K with a
twisted knee, Simons will have
his work cut out for him against
Washington’s huge center, Ray
Mansfield. However, if C. B. plays
the kind of game he did against
MSU’s All American Dave Behr
man, Mansfield will be in for an
afternoon of hard knocks.

j Babajian, who was missed last I
week against WSU, has a healthy
ankle now and will see lots of ac
tion tomorrow. His ability to
squeeze his compact, 5-7 frame
into even the smallest holes in the
line consistently brought him i
good gains against Michigan I
State.
Although halfback Gary Craig

is still out with a concussion,
sophomore ,1. D. Lodato has been
a standout in recent games and
has earned the starting slot. Lo
dato is the Tribe workhorse, lead
ing the squad in yards gained
this year, and his speed will be
sorely needed against the fleet
Husky backs.
PASSING, long a Stanford
strong point, has been somewhat
less than sensational this year.
Aerials have been dropped and
overthrown, many of the incom
pletes coming on key downs. Cur
tice has been drilling the quarter
backs and ends this week to try
to improve the .397 completion

average.
Yesterday, the results were en- j
eouraging. Ends Chris Jessen and i
Guy Rounsaville snagged some i
beauties off the arms of Steve I
Thurlow and Clark Weaver to
elicit satisfactory grins from the
coaches.
Concerning the opposition, the
Huskies are all healthy with the
exception of halfback Charlie
Mitchell, who got banged around
against Oregon State last week
and may not start, although he’ll
I play. Washington will arrive to
day at noon and begin workouts
| in Stanford Stadium.
THE HUSKIES probably repre
sent I tie pivotal game of tho sea
son for Stanford if the Cards
can win. A loss would pave the
way for a midseason slump simi
lar to last year.

Hoping to spring a few sur
prises of the kind that humbled
mighty Michigan Slate, Stan
ford’s football team takes on a
highly-touted Washington eleven
tomorrow in Stanford Stadium.
Game time is 1 ;30 p.m.

speculating about the gome for
weeks, and interest is high, as
this game represents a major hur

Hose Bowl. Husky coach Jim
Owens has discounted Stanford’s

the Cards are as strong as ever
and will be “up” for the game.
