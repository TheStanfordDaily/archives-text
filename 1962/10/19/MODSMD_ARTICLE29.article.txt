### GLENN ALFORD

start at 11 a.m. on Stanford’s
Harry Maloney Field.
Stanford clobbered Menlo 7-0
Wednesday, while never having
all the first string in the game at
the same time. Stu Rawlings
scored six times to pace the win.
Menlo, to put it mildly, isn’t
very good, and Stanford should
get their league mark above .500
with a win tomorrow. The first
Card-Menlo contest was a non
league affair.
