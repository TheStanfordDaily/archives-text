### JIM DONOVAN 
This weekend the Stanford wa
ter polo team must overcome two
of the major obstacles in its drive
for an undefeated season.
Today at 3:30 (he Tribe hosts
the University of the Pacific, who
beat San Jose State by approxi
mately the same score that Stan
ford did. UOP also defeated Cal.
The Indians played poorly against
Cal, but still managed to win 10-3.
Although this should lie a tough
game, it will be a warm-up com
pared to the following day’s con
test.
Tomorrow at 11 the Indians
play the Olympic Club, the 1959
National Champions and one of
the top three water polo teams
in the country. The Olympic Club
is definitely the most powerful
team on Stanford’s schedule.

THEY BOAST such outstanding |
players as Art Lambert, two-time
all-America forward, Jim Small,
captain of Cal’s water polo team
last year, and Bill Ready from |
Menlo-Atherton High School and j
Menlo College. Their high scoring
center forward is none other than
Rob Gaughran, the younger broth
er of Jim Gaughran, the Stanford
water polo and swimming coach, i
The Olympic club players are j
an average of five years older j
than the Stanford players and all j
weigh two hundred pounds. The
Indians hope to make up for their j
lack of experience and weight by j
accelerating the pace of the game !
and by forcing their opponents to,I
pick up fouls.
This veteran team uses a hang
ing center forward and moves the
ball up to him with accurate pass
ing and a minimum of swimming.

Coach Gaughran hopes to break
up this powerful offense by hav
ing Don Buehler, the defensive
specialist, play the center forward
man to man the entire length of
the pool.
