# Frosh Gridders Ready For Spartans' Harroway
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Stanford’s surprising freshman
football team, coming off of a
13-6 victory over SC’s favored Tro
jans, tackles San Jose State to
morrow at 10 a.m. in Stanford
Stadium.
The Indians must stop San
Jose’s big fullback Charley Harro
way if they are to contain the
Spartan’s attack. The powerfully
built back from Monterey led SJS
1 to a 41-0 triumph over a strug-
I gling Cal Poly team a week ago.
Judging from the job the Indians
did in stiffling Troy’s powerful
j runner, Mike Garrett, rated the
i top high school player in South
i ern California last year, they
j should be able to stop Harroway.
Stanford Coach Dan Stavely re-
I fused to point out a single player
|or group of players as having
} starred in last week’s victory; the
| win was a team effort. The line
hit exceptionally well, especially
j in the first half. Even the 85 yard,
1 touchdown by halfback Ray Hand
j ley must be attributed, at least in
i part, to great down-field blocking.
STANFORD outgained the Tro
jans on the ground by a 265-150
yard margin, Handley personally
accounted for 98 yards in 5 car
ries, good for a 19.6 yards per car
ry average. Quarterback Mike
Connelly netted 69 yards in 16
j tries and completed a pass to Pete
Middlekauff which gained 11
yards.

The Cards, having sustained no
serious injuries in the SC contest,
will field the same starting lineup
against the Spartans. Don Cook,
who suffered a shoulder separa
tion earlier in the year, is ready
to resume quarterbacking duties
behind starter Connelly. This al
lows John Mason, who had been
second string quarterback, to
move back to his normal position
at end.

j ley must be attributed, at least in
i part, to great down-field blocking.
STANFORD outgained the Tro
jans on the ground by a 265-150
yard margin, Handley personally
accounted for 98 yards in 5 car
ries, good for a 19.6 yards per car
ry average. Quarterback Mike
Connelly netted 69 yards in 16
j tries and completed a pass to Pete
Middlekauff which gained 11
yards.

The Cards, having sustained no
serious injuries in the SC contest,
will field the same starting lineup
against the Spartans. Don Cook,
who suffered a shoulder separa
tion earlier in the year, is ready
to resume quarterbacking duties
behind starter Connelly. This al
lows John Mason, who had been
second string quarterback, to
move back to his normal position
at end.
