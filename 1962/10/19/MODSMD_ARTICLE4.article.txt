# Harvard to Review Study Program

### PAGE EDWARDS 
Harvard University’s program
of General Education will under
go its first examination since it
was established in 1947. Harvard’s
General Education, similar to
Stanford’s General Studies pro
gram adopted in 1956. has been
among the major guidelines of j
American higher education.
A story in Wednesday’s New \
York Times said that Harvard’s
question is “whether, in the light
of our experience and of the
changing pace of American edu
cation, we can strengthen Gener
al Education and fit it still more
securely into the college pattern.”
The General Studies program
at Stanford has a provision for
continual review of the facets of
the program.
The Times story went on to ox- j
plain that Harvard’s ro-examina- j
tion is to explore the possibilities!
of allowing students to specialize j
earlier. “Even though greater in
terest in specialization among un-1
dergraduates is inevitable and
even desirable, the college must (
remain responsible for the stu
dent's program outside his con

centration,” said Franklin L.
Ford, dean of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences.
Stanford’s program attempts
to solve the problem by allowing
students four years to complete
the requirements.
Harvard's General Education
program does not require a
course or set of courses. Each
student has a choice among a
number of specially prepared
courses in each major area of
learning the humanities, social
sciences and biological and physi
cal sciences.
“Typically.” said the Times
story, “a student takes one course
in each area during his first two
years and an advanced course in
each area during his final two
years.”
'Last year at Stanford, as the
result of a review of the advising
program under General Studies,
a noteworthy improvement was
made. Freshmen advisors are now
assigned by resident halls, and
each advisor is also the hall’s
faculty associate. Undergradu
ates, excluding freshmen and
transfers, ore now required to sec

their advisors oniy once a year,
at spring registration.
Study cards and petitions for
class changes also no longer need
to be signed by the student’s ad
visor. “It is hoped that this will
promote long term academic
planning,’’ said General Studies
Committee Chairman Robert
Walker-.
Walker pointed out that the
General Studies Committee is
presently carrying on a complete
study on the freshman year. The
committee is reviewing courses,
instructors and grading policies
in search of possible improve
ments. The committee, in the
spring of 1961, circulated a ques
tionnaire in various freshmen
classes. The participating fresh
men, 600 in all, were asked their
attitudes towards the university,
their courses and their living ac
commodations.
Walker said the freshman-year
study will be prepared and pub
lished some time this year. The
committee in the future, said
Walker, plans to review such
areas as advanced placement and
the possibility of comprehensive
examinations.

Walker pointed out that the
General Studies Committee is
presently carrying on a complete
study on the freshman year. The
committee is reviewing courses,
instructors and grading policies
in search of possible improve
ments. The committee, in the
spring of 1961, circulated a ques
tionnaire in various freshmen
classes. The participating fresh
men, 600 in all, were asked their
attitudes towards the university,
their courses and their living ac
commodations.
Walker said the freshman-year
study will be prepared and pub
lished some time this year. The
committee in the future, said
Walker, plans to review such
areas as advanced placement and
the possibility of comprehensive
examinations.
Harvard University’s program
of General Education will under
go its first examination since it
was established in 1947. Harvard’s
General Education, similar to

among the major guidelines of j
American higher education.
A story in Wednesday’s New \

question is “whether, in the light
of our experience and of the
changing pace of American edu

al Education and fit it still more
securely into the college pattern.”
The General Studies program
at Stanford has a provision for
continual review of the facets of

The Times story went on to ox- j
plain that Harvard’s ro-examina- j
tion is to explore the possibilities!
of allowing students to specialize j
earlier. “Even though greater in
terest in specialization among un-1
dergraduates is inevitable and
even desirable, the college must (
remain responsible for the stu

centration,” said Franklin L.

in each area during his first two
