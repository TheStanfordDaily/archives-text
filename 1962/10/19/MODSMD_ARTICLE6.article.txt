# Limits of Social Science Revealed by Davidson

By ELIZABETH FREEMAN
“I am in the position of a man
who has announced that he is go
ing to square the circle,” an
nounced Dr. Donald Davidson,
professor of philosophy, in his
talk last night on “The Proof of
the Impossibility of the Social
Sciences."
He explained that he would talk
on the general view of this prob
lem, not the particular conse
quences from the specific view.
Social sciences attempt to pro
vide scientific explanation for in
tentional human actions, he said,
which ho believes to be impossi
ble. He defined “scientific expla
nation" as the attempt to assume
general laws from events which
indicate a cause and effect rela
tionship.
“Mental events can’t in general
bo predicted, especially in the
sense of their being brought un
der general laws,” he said.
He defined a “mental concept”
as the notion of intention, to be
distinguished from “physical con
cept." With this definition he pre
sented Iwo arguments in support
of his viewpoint.

"If each of a set of events is
caused of some event belonging

to another, and we can character
ize the first set using a "physi
cal concept,” then we can charac
terize the second set, also using
“physical concepts,” he gave as
his first argument.

His second claim was that
“there is no concept definable in
the physical vocabulary whose ex
tension is identical with the ex
tension of any mental concept.”
It follows, “There can’t be any
laws connecting physical and
mental states,” he said, and thus,
"there are no psycho-physical
laws.”
