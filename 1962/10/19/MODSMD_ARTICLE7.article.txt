# Registrar Seeks Cut in Incompletes
## 
### 
The Registrar’s Advisory Com
mittee, recently concerned with
an excessive number of incom
plete grades, reminds students
that incompletes are not to be
received at any time merely for
the student's convenience.
University policy on incom
pletes states that incomplete
work may be graded Ai, Bi, Ci, Di,
or inc. only when the student has
completed a substantial part of
the course with satisfactory
grades and when valid grounds
exist for not completing all the
required work. Valid grounds in
clude illness, death or emergency
in the family, or similar condi
tions causing loss of time beyond
the student’s control.
A studenl with unsatisfactory
work wanting extra time to es
cape consequences will receive a
condition (E) or failure.
