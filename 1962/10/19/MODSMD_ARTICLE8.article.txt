# Sterling's Talk Begins PACE Dinner Series
## 
### 
No other state has matched
California in developing a strong,
complementary, and constructive
system of private and public
higher education, President J. E.
Wallace Sterling emphasized last
night in a television address to
seven PACE Program dinners in
the Bay Area.
President Sterling, speaking to
all seven gatherings and to the
public over KQED, praised the
Bay Area for its 26 institutions
of higher learning, one of the
highest concentrations of educa
tional resources in the nation.
Citing California’s achieve
ments in higher education as an
important factor in the state’s
population growth, he added that
the institutions will require more
financial support in the future.
California already heads the
country in total college enroll
ment.
“That is why Proposition 1A is
on the state ballot on behalf of
public institutions—that is why
Stanford is in the midst of an ef
fort to add $lOO million to its re
sources,” stated Sterling. He also
supported Proposition 13, a pro
posal for property tax exemption
on ail lands used exclusively for
educational purposes by private
I colleges and universities.
