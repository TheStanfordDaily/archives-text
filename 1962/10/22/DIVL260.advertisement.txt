EVERY CHURCH
has a special distinction. Church (Gr.
EKKLASIA-' Called out”) may refer to
any assembly: social, political, or reli
gious (Acts 19:32, 39, 41).
The church of Christ refers to
believers called out of sin and
“Baptized (immersed) into
Christ Jesus." Mark 16.16;
John 3:5; Romans 6:3-5.
To obey 99 per cent Bible
and 1 per cent opinion is to
be called into a group distin
guished by the 1 per cent
opinion. The large percent of
truth that is taught may easily
hide the 1 per cent change and
account for the religious di
vision.
Faith, love, and character
are required by Christ and are
beautifully taught by many
groups; however, to become a
child of God, Jesus adds that
baptism (immersion) is essen
tial. John 3:5; Col. 2:12; Acts
2:38.
Sprinkling is no* Bible baptism. God
has Authorized NO MAN to baptize an
unbeliever (Infant or otherwise) or sub
stitute sprinkling for baptism (immer
sion) Mk. 7;7.
To be a child of God one must obey
Christ rather than men.
