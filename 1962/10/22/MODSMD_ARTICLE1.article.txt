# U. of Colorado 'Daily' Editor Fired by University President
## 
### MARGARET HARDING Associate Editor 
Gary Altlien, student editor
Daily, was discharged from his
President Quigg Newton.
The firing climaxed an argi
Barry S. Goldwater and the Univ
which appeared in the Daily la-'
holing Goldwater “a fool, a
mountebank, a murderer, no bet
ter than a common criminal.”
GOLDWATER, after reading
the article, written by senior Carl
Mitcham, demanded that the uni
versity take some action against
the Daily.
Newton replied to Goldwater
early last week, saying, “We have
a genuine democracy on our cam
pus. We have fought long and
hard to achieve it and the fight
has been against those who, like
yourself, believe the function of a
university is to indoctrinate, rath
er than educate.”
At the end of the week, how
ever, Newton issued a statement
calling for Althen's resignation,
saying that Althen had “displayed
a pattern of editorial irresponsi
bility that required his removal”
from his position “in the best
interests of the university.”
THE CONTROVERSY over the
Goldwater article was intensified
by a letter in the Daily, also by
Mitcham, which called former
President Dwight D. Eisenhower
a “futzer.”
The letter said. “With Ike it
was hard to keep from laughing
at the old futzer’s grammar. It
was like having a lap dog for
president nice to have around
the house as a pet for the kids,
but you’d never think of sending
him to a kennel show.”
Stating that he disapproved of
the “old futzer” letter, Colorado
Governor Stephen L. R. McNich
ols recommended early last week
to the Board of Regents of the
University that the Daily he put
under the administration of the
journalism department. The Re
gents, two of whom are running
for re-election in November, re
fused to make this change.
ONE OF THE incumbent re
gents, Charles D. Bromley, said
that “the general atmosphere
among the faculty at the univer
sity is one of fear. There is no
academic freedom on the Boulder
campus except for those who
happen to agree with the presi
dent.”
Student reaction has strongly
supported Althen, Over 500 stu
dents picketed Newton’s home
last Wednesday. Student Body
President Aldus Gaither said,
however, that most students are
taking a “wait-and-see attitude.”
Gaither himself says that he is
“deeply disappointed” by the
president’s action. “What Newton
has done may have harmed the
basic philosophy of student gov
ernment,” he said.
STUDENTS will vote Wednes
day and Thursday on a Student
Senate resolution requesting that
Newton reconsider his dismissal
of Althen. Newton will defend his
position at a meeting of students
tomorrow at noon.
The Colorado Daily staff has
threatened a walk-out if the Pub
lieations Board does not accept
their plan that would allow the
staff to continue publishing with
out an editor until Althen’s rein
statement or until the staff has
elected a new permanent editor.
Four top staff members resigned
when Jon Kolowitz was appointed
interim editor immediately after
Althen’s dismissal.

nnent between Arizona Senator
ersitv of Colorado over an article
Gary Altlien, student editor
Daily, was discharged from his
President Quigg Newton.
The firing climaxed an argi
Barry S. Goldwater and the Univ
which appeared in the Daily la-'
holing Goldwater “a fool, a
mountebank, a murderer, no bet
ter than a common criminal.”
GOLDWATER, after reading
the article, written by senior Carl
Mitcham, demanded that the uni
versity take some action against
the Daily.
Newton replied to Goldwater
early last week, saying, “We have
a genuine democracy on our cam
pus. We have fought long and
hard to achieve it and the fight
has been against those who, like
yourself, believe the function of a
university is to indoctrinate, rath
er than educate.”
At the end of the week, how
ever, Newton issued a statement
calling for Althen's resignation,
saying that Althen had “displayed
a pattern of editorial irresponsi
bility that required his removal”
from his position “in the best
interests of the university.”
THE CONTROVERSY over the
Goldwater article was intensified
by a letter in the Daily, also by
Mitcham, which called former
President Dwight D. Eisenhower
a “futzer.”
The letter said. “With Ike it
was hard to keep from laughing
at the old futzer’s grammar. It
was like having a lap dog for
president nice to have around
the house as a pet for the kids,
but you’d never think of sending
him to a kennel show.”
Stating that he disapproved of
the “old futzer” letter, Colorado
