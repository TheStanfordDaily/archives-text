# Stanford Overseas

### 
The recent criticisms of the overseas campus programs are not
to he answered by the many virtues of the program. The criticisms
do not require that Stanford campuses in Tours, Florence, and
Stuttgart he abolished whatever their present faults or inherent
inadequacies. There is no inherently insoluble problem in sending
a large group of students to Europe for study.
Nevertheless the criticisms are damning. Why, ask the critics,
must psychology courses be taught at foreign campuses since the
subject material is not germane to the experience? Indeed, there
is no adequate answer. It may be supposed that there are adminis
trative difficulties in finding Stanford professors who can go
abroad for six months to teach courses more germane to the ex
perience. But this difficulty can he overcome by hiring perma
nently European professors who would teach full time at the
foreign campuses.

This arrangement would cost the University extra money;
however, the sum might not appear so staggering in view of the
unquestioned importance of correlating the foreign experience and
the courses taught. The presently haphazard correlation of courses
and campuses is called the paramount inadequacy of the program
hr a report prepared by eight students upon their return from the
three European campuses. The report suggests that if the courses
were more germane to the experience, “the students would no
longer display the tendency to shirk the work in required courses
in order to read and study independently on subjects they feel to
be more relevant to their unique circumstances.”
The most recent problem with courses occurred in the France
IV group that returned to Palo Alto last month. They went through
the intense aggravation of being forced to take courses in Child
Psychology and Abnormal Psychology. Perhaps a very few of them
would have taken one of the courses here anyway, later. Perhaps
a very few of the very few would have taken both. But should any
of the group have been forced to take both courses in a European
setting? Is it unreasonable and impractical to expect that once in
Europe, the group would have had the opportunity to take courses
exclusively in European history, politics, literature, art, and gen
eral culture? If there is value in studying for six months in Europe,
it lies in the unique opportunity to study European culture while
experiencing it. This opportunity disappears when the curriculum
requires the study of psychology for two quarters.
The value of the present program is also seriously limited hv
the language barrier .By requiring only tw r o quarters of a language
before departure for the foreign campus, the University allows
students to go abroad who have no facility in the language, es
pecially in the spoken language. The report points out that “the
phrase, ‘We come to learn,’ is meaningless when many students
cannot read, write, speak, or understand the native language until
they are ready to return home.” If the University required five
quarters of a language for admission to the program, the language
barrier might well disappear as a primary obstacle to a successful
European study program.
