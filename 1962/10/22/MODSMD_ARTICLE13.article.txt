Editor, The Daily:
In his recent letter to The
Daily, Mr. Walsh pointed out that
the position taken by ASSU Pres
ident Armin Rosencranz in his
address to the Freshmen and Leg
islature is “considerably unrealis
tic, grossly irresponsible and
alarmingly naive.” These discrip
tions can also be applied to the
present attitudes and actions of
the Student Body in general.
We agitate for greater student
participation in administrative af
fairs, yet we are unable to control
our own conduct at football
games. We demand that we be al
lowed to govern completely our
“non-academic” lives, yet we re
fuse to recognize the fact that we
are not the only ones affected by
our “non-academic affairs.” We
ask for increased responsibility,
but have not yet demonstrated a
capacity for it. We demand a
greater student voice in adminis
trative affairs, yet are afraid to
speak up and recognize our own
shortcomings.
If we had the courage as indi

viduals to look at ourselves in
stead of pointing the accusing fin
ger at the Administration, the
Dean’s Office, the Committee on
Public Exercises, or Rally Com,
we might be a step closer in help
ing Stanford to “take its rightful
place among the truly great uni
versities of the world.”

Editor, The Daily:
The Tresidder Union was built
for use by Stanford students.
However, because so many people
from Palo Alto use the bowling
lanes in the evening, the students
are actually forced out; those
who come early enough to get a
lane are told to leave after three
games, and those that come in
later have to wait in line, and are
restricted to only three games.
Tell the people of Palo Alto to
let us have our Union back; re
trict the use of the bowling lanes
to Stanford people and guests
during the busy hours after 7
p.m.

“non-academic” lives, yet we re
fuse to recognize the fact that we
are not the only ones affected by
our “non-academic affairs.” We
ask for increased responsibility,
but have not yet demonstrated a
capacity for it. We demand a
greater student voice in adminis
trative affairs, yet are afraid to
speak up and recognize our own
shortcomings.
If we had the courage as indi

viduals to look at ourselves in
stead of pointing the accusing fin
ger at the Administration, the
Dean’s Office, the Committee on
Public Exercises, or Rally Com,
we might be a step closer in help
ing Stanford to “take its rightful
place among the truly great uni
versities of the world.”

Editor, The Daily:
The Tresidder Union was built
for use by Stanford students.
However, because so many people
from Palo Alto use the bowling
lanes in the evening, the students
are actually forced out; those
who come early enough to get a
lane are told to leave after three
games, and those that come in
later have to wait in line, and are
restricted to only three games.
Tell the people of Palo Alto to
let us have our Union back; re
trict the use of the bowling lanes
to Stanford people and guests
during the busy hours after 7
p.m.
