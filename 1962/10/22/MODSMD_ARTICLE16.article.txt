# SOCIALISM CONCEALED
## 'US. Moving Forward All Right But toward What? Socialism?' 
### ROSS HERMANN 
Most Americans know that a tumultuous revolution engulfed
Czarist Russia in 1917 and resulted in the establishment of a new
social and economic order. Fewer Americans realize that a similar
revolution, lacking only in violence and abrupt social upheaval, has
taken place in the United States and is now in its advanced stages.

Anyone who doubts that rather-"
startling statement, who doubts
that this country Is presently go
ing through a transition period
from free enterprise to socialism
should consider the recent re
marks of Upton Sinclair, a noted
American author and an intellec
tual leader of the socialist move
ment in the United States from
its beginning in the early 1900’s.
On NBC television. May 6, 1962,
Mr. Sinclair was interviewed by
Eric Goldman, professor of his
tory at Princeton University.
Mr. Goldman: “I take it from a
quotation of yours in the New
York Herald Tribune that you be
lieve that this country is heading
toward socialism. Is that cor
rect?”
Mr. Sinclair: “Oh, I thing so
cialism is absolutely inevitable.
Of course, I’d like to make plain
I don’t expect socialism to come
under that name and I don’t ex
pect it to come all at once and I
don’t expect the majority of peo
ple to know when it’s coming or
even when it’s happening . . .
I’m not interested in the lerm.
I’m just as well satisfied to call
it ‘progressive,’ to call it ‘ad
vanced democracy,’ or whatever
you please.”
Mr. Goldman: “In one sense
you're like Senator Goldwater.
You believe in creeping socialism,
don’t you?”
Mr. Sinclair; “I certainly be
lieve in creeping socialism, and
the only difference between Gold
water and me is that I want it
and he hates it.”
Mr. Goldman: “Do you mean by
socialism a continuation of the
levelling of economic and social
circumstances in this country by
various means or do you mean
nationalization?”
Mr. Sinclair: “I mean the per
fectly simple and definite thing
that I studied—and oh. yes, I dis
covered for myself not quite 70
years ago—the social ownership
and democratic control of the in
strument and means of produc
tion. I think that our natural re
sources belong to all the people
and it is shameful and intolerable
that they should be in the hands
of private interests. And I think
that the wealth of the country
should be distributed to those
who are idle and useless owners.
“I don’t believe in the inheri
tance or the right of inheritance
of the sources of wealth and pro
duction.”
Mr. Goldman: “Well in that
sense weren’t we closer to social
ism in 1914, let us say, than we
are today? That is closer to the
actual national ownership of the
principal means of production?”
Mr. Sinclair: “I don’t think
we’ve ever been as near socialism
as we are at this hour. I think
we’re moving nearer to it every
minute. The people are becoming
more and more awake politically.
They're learning to know who is
working in the national interest
and who is opposing it. And I
think they are steadily coming to
demand more and more of the so
cial product . . .”
Mr. Goldman: “Mr. Sinclair,
what about the point which is so
frequently made today, namely,
the reformers of your group as
sumed that if you got a better
fed, better housed American you
would somehow or another get a
better human being . . . And as
they say, look at the uplifted
masses today. Are they any bet-
I ter? Aren’t they as a matter of
fact even worse?”
Mr. Sinclair: "I think that’s a
very broad generalization Intel

lectually, America has evolved
and changed, advanced to a very
great extent. I think the recent
Presidential election we had
proved that to us.”
Mr. Goldman: “In what way?”
Mr. Sinclair: “In the way we
elected a much better President.
We have a much better Cabinet
and we have a whole atmosphere
of alertness and curiosity and
progressive thinking.”
In a similar vein, Arthur M.
Schlesinger, Jr., a special assis
tant to President Kennedy, wrote
in the June 1957 issue of “Partisan
Review, “There seems to be no in
herent obstacle to the gradual ad
vance of socialism in the United
States through a series of New
Deals.” He went on to advocate
democratic socialism as “an at
tractive solution to the problem
of how to live with modern indus
try and the modern state.” Asked
more recently to repudiate his ad
vocacy of socialism, New Fron
tiersman Schlesinger refused.
Throughout the socialist ap
peal runs a super allegiance to
democracy, as if democracy were
the sole domain of the far left
and their opponents by definition
anti-democratic. Such a conten
tion is dangerous to the future of
a democratic system in that it en
courages the formation of an
anti-democratic opposition.
It is well to keep in mind that
democracy is a political process, a
set of procedures governing po
litical life. One rule of democracy
is that political participants shall
set forth their policies and pro
grams in a forthright and honest
manner for the people to judge.
WHEN SOCIALISTS have done
this, when they have appeared on
the ballot by their proper name,
when they have called their pro
grams what they are, they have
been overwhelmingly rejected by
the American people.
They have succeeded only by
concealing their designs beneath
the banners of the New Deal, the
Fair Deal, and the New Frontier.
The fact that: Arthur Schlesinger
is in a position to influence the
course of the New Frontier
makes a mockery of the demo
cratic process in that his socialist
views were never presented as
such to the people and ratified or
rejected on their own merits.
President Kennedy will tell the
people in this campaign, as he did
in 1960, that he wants to get the
country “moving again.” The
voter would do well to ask, “Mov
ing toward what, Mr. President?”
In 1960, he promised to provide
"vigorous leadership.” Again the
voter might ask, “Vigorous lead
ership to take us where, Mr. Pres
ident?” So far the question has
gone unanswered.
Perhaps Arthur Schlesinger
provided the answer in a moment
of indiscretion.
