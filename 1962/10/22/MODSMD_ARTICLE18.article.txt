# 1210 to 655
## Students Polled Back Nixon Over Brown 
### RON BASS Contributing Editor 
To the uttor amazement of
practically no one, Political Union
has announced a dramatic two-to
one victory for Richard Nixon in
last week’s student opinion poll.
After the discarding of about 600
ballots for assorted obscenities,
the final 1210 to 605 count includ
ed one-third of the undergradu
ate enrollment.
In the crossing of parly lines,
Brown gained 92 Republican
votes to 67 Democratic votes for
Nixon. The independents split al
most equally, favoring Brown
193 to 174,
SINC E 89 per cent held fast to
their party affiliations, with the
Republicans holding a 1061 to 433
edge in registration, the outcome
was far too inevitable to arouse a
great degree of campus enthusi
asm. With this in mind, the poll
takers decided to spice things up
by extensive IBM correlations
with sex, age, living group, fa
ther’s occupations and area of
residence. This resulted in the
construction of the most intricate
cobweb of trivia imaginable. Some
of the revelations produced by
this staggering heap of data in
cluded the facts that most farmers
are Republicans, and lots more
Stanford students live in Califor
nit than Nevada.
Some interesting, if inconclu
sive, results were obtainable.
Women seemed to find Brown
somewhat less objectionable (58-
42 split for Nixon) than did the
men (69-31 division). The junior
class was strongest for Nixon;
the seniors, the weakest. The fra
ternities and the row girls were
clearly the most conservative ele
ments on campus, splitting for
Republicans 4 to 1; while eating
clubs and women’s dorms were
the more “liberal” residences,
giving the Republican slightly
less than a 2 to 1 margin. The
only ethnic group on campus that
actually favored Brown was the
“children of government work
ers,” and considering the fact
that many of these are working
for the present Democratic ad
ministration, Brown’s 59 to 58
edge seems less than resounding.
Californians voted 66 per cent for
Nixon, out-of-staters 63 per cent.
After reading through 1863
statements of “primary reasons”
for support of candidates it is
pretty clear that few people really
think much of either candidate.
In fact, few people really think
much. In all eighteen hundred
ballots there were only 147 people
who even mentioned issues, and
many of these slated that they
had truly made up their minds on
the basis of personal images. Of
these 147, 90 voted for Brown and
57 for Nixon. Of the ballots that
seemed to hinge on Nixon’s stand
on academic freedom, Brown was
in front 50 to 7. Of the ballots
which turned on Brown’s fiscal
policies, Nixon won 29 to 7. Of the
ballots which referred to capital
punishment, Brown took 13 while
losing 4. Other issues which seem
ed to favor Brown were his water
and education programs, while
Nixon was supported by those dis
satisfied with Brown’s record on
narcotics traffic, as well as by a
small group which felt that the
re-election of Brown would spell
the end of the two party system
in California.
AS FOR the other 1700 ballots,
there seemed to be a marked dif
ference in the personal images of
the candidates. Blown was often
ridiculed, but rarely was there a
flash of either true hatred, or
deep respect. The comments ran
from “keep the fat out of Califor
nia,” to “Brown may lose the
state but he won’t sell it,” to
“Brown, though wishy-washy, is
at least human.” Perhaps the
most typical remark came from
the Independent who said, “Brown
sometimes seems less stupid.”
The feelings inspired by Rich
ard Nixon seem to run deeper.
One Brown supporter called Nix
on "the worst politician, and hu
man being, to emerge on the na
tional political scene in history.”
Others who voted for Nixon
termed him as “only slightly dis
gusting,” and claimed to have se
lected him because of “spite,” “so
cial pressure,” and “I like spring
boards.” Still there were many de
voted supporters who passionate
ly defended Nixon’s “integrity,”
"courage,” “dedication,” “fair
ness,” and “vast experience.” One
sophomore stated that Nixon
“most typifies the American way
of life. That is do it for yourself
—don’t ask for a government
handout.” A freshman proudly
printed in block letters that, “As
California rapidly becomes the
largest state in the U.S., it needs
a man with the leadership quali
ties of Richard M. Nixon.”
The true consensus of campus
opinion concerning the coming
gubernatorial elections was per
haps most clearly stated in the
one sentence response of the
freshman girl who said, “I think
that it is a pity that there is not
a better man who is interested in,
or supported for, running in this
campaign.”

cluded the facts that most farmers
are Republicans, and lots more
Stanford students live in Califor
nit than Nevada.
Some interesting, if inconclu
sive, results were obtainable.
Women seemed to find Brown
somewhat less objectionable (58-
42 split for Nixon) than did the
men (69-31 division). The junior
class was strongest for Nixon;
the seniors, the weakest. The fra
ternities and the row girls were
clearly the most conservative ele
ments on campus, splitting for
Republicans 4 to 1; while eating
clubs and women’s dorms were
the more “liberal” residences,
giving the Republican slightly
less than a 2 to 1 margin. The
only ethnic group on campus that
actually favored Brown was the
“children of government work
ers,” and considering the fact
that many of these are working
for the present Democratic ad
ministration, Brown’s 59 to 58
edge seems less than resounding.
Californians voted 66 per cent for
Nixon, out-of-staters 63 per cent.
After reading through 1863
statements of “primary reasons”
for support of candidates it is
pretty clear that few people really
think much of either candidate.
In fact, few people really think
much. In all eighteen hundred
ballots there were only 147 people
who even mentioned issues, and
many of these slated that they
had truly made up their minds on
the basis of personal images. Of
these 147, 90 voted for Brown and
57 for Nixon. Of the ballots that
seemed to hinge on Nixon’s stand
on academic freedom, Brown was
in front 50 to 7. Of the ballots
which turned on Brown’s fiscal
policies, Nixon won 29 to 7. Of the
ballots which referred to capital
punishment, Brown took 13 while
losing 4. Other issues which seem
ed to favor Brown were his water
and education programs, while
Nixon was supported by those dis
satisfied with Brown’s record on
narcotics traffic, as well as by a
small group which felt that the
re-election of Brown would spell
the end of the two party system
in California.
AS FOR the other 1700 ballots,
there seemed to be a marked dif
ference in the personal images of
the candidates. Blown was often
ridiculed, but rarely was there a
flash of either true hatred, or
deep respect. The comments ran
from “keep the fat out of Califor
nia,” to “Brown may lose the
state but he won’t sell it,” to
“Brown, though wishy-washy, is
at least human.” Perhaps the
most typical remark came from
the Independent who said, “Brown
sometimes seems less stupid.”
The feelings inspired by Rich
ard Nixon seem to run deeper.
One Brown supporter called Nix
on "the worst politician, and hu
man being, to emerge on the na
tional political scene in history.”
Others who voted for Nixon
termed him as “only slightly dis
gusting,” and claimed to have se
lected him because of “spite,” “so
cial pressure,” and “I like spring
boards.” Still there were many de
voted supporters who passionate
ly defended Nixon’s “integrity,”
"courage,” “dedication,” “fair
ness,” and “vast experience.” One
sophomore stated that Nixon
“most typifies the American way
of life. That is do it for yourself
—don’t ask for a government
handout.” A freshman proudly
printed in block letters that, “As
California rapidly becomes the
largest state in the U.S., it needs
a man with the leadership quali
ties of Richard M. Nixon.”
The true consensus of campus
opinion concerning the coming
gubernatorial elections was per
haps most clearly stated in the
one sentence response of the
freshman girl who said, “I think
that it is a pity that there is not
a better man who is interested in,
or supported for, running in this
campaign.”
To the uttor amazement of
practically no one, Political Union
has announced a dramatic two-to
one victory for Richard Nixon in
last week’s student opinion poll.
After the discarding of about 600
ballots for assorted obscenities,
the final 1210 to 605 count includ
ed one-third of the undergradu
ate enrollment.
In the crossing of parly lines,
Brown gained 92 Republican
votes to 67 Democratic votes for
Nixon. The independents split al
most equally, favoring Brown
193 to 174,
SINC E 89 per cent held fast to
their party affiliations, with the
Republicans holding a 1061 to 433
edge in registration, the outcome
was far too inevitable to arouse a
great degree of campus enthusi
asm. With this in mind, the poll
takers decided to spice things up
by extensive IBM correlations
with sex, age, living group, fa
ther’s occupations and area of
residence. This resulted in the
construction of the most intricate
cobweb of trivia imaginable. Some

In fact, few people really think
much. In all eighteen hundred
ballots there were only 147 people
who even mentioned issues, and
many of these slated that they
had truly made up their minds on
the basis of personal images. Of
these 147, 90 voted for Brown and
57 for Nixon. Of the ballots that
seemed to hinge on Nixon’s stand
on academic freedom, Brown was
in front 50 to 7. Of the ballots
which turned on Brown’s fiscal
policies, Nixon won 29 to 7. Of the
ballots which referred to capital
punishment, Brown took 13 while
losing 4. Other issues which seem
ed to favor Brown were his water
and education programs, while
Nixon was supported by those dis
satisfied with Brown’s record on
narcotics traffic, as well as by a
small group which felt that the
re-election of Brown would spell
the end of the two party system
in California.
AS FOR the other 1700 ballots,
there seemed to be a marked dif
ference in the personal images of
the candidates. Blown was often
ridiculed, but rarely was there a
flash of either true hatred, or
deep respect. The comments ran
from “keep the fat out of Califor
nia,” to “Brown may lose the
state but he won’t sell it,” to
“Brown, though wishy-washy, is
at least human.” Perhaps the
most typical remark came from
the Independent who said, “Brown
sometimes seems less stupid.”
The feelings inspired by Rich
ard Nixon seem to run deeper.
One Brown supporter called Nix
on "the worst politician, and hu
man being, to emerge on the na
tional political scene in history.”
Others who voted for Nixon
termed him as “only slightly dis
gusting,” and claimed to have se
lected him because of “spite,” “so
cial pressure,” and “I like spring
boards.” Still there were many de
voted supporters who passionate
ly defended Nixon’s “integrity,”
"courage,” “dedication,” “fair
ness,” and “vast experience.” One
sophomore stated that Nixon
“most typifies the American way
of life. That is do it for yourself
—don’t ask for a government
handout.” A freshman proudly
printed in block letters that, “As
California rapidly becomes the
largest state in the U.S., it needs
a man with the leadership quali
ties of Richard M. Nixon.”
The true consensus of campus
opinion concerning the coming
gubernatorial elections was per
haps most clearly stated in the
one sentence response of the
freshman girl who said, “I think
that it is a pity that there is not
a better man who is interested in,
or supported for, running in this
campaign.”
To the uttor amazement of
practically no one, Political Union
has announced a dramatic two-to
one victory for Richard Nixon in
last week’s student opinion poll.
After the discarding of about 600
ballots for assorted obscenities,
the final 1210 to 605 count includ
ed one-third of the undergradu
ate enrollment.
In the crossing of parly lines,
Brown gained 92 Republican
votes to 67 Democratic votes for
Nixon. The independents split al
most equally, favoring Brown
193 to 174,
SINC E 89 per cent held fast to
their party affiliations, with the
Republicans holding a 1061 to 433
edge in registration, the outcome
was far too inevitable to arouse a
great degree of campus enthusi
asm. With this in mind, the poll
takers decided to spice things up
by extensive IBM correlations
with sex, age, living group, fa
ther’s occupations and area of
residence. This resulted in the
construction of the most intricate
cobweb of trivia imaginable. Some
of the revelations produced by
this staggering heap of data in
cluded the facts that most farmers
are Republicans, and lots more
Stanford students live in Califor
nit than Nevada.
Some interesting, if inconclu
sive, results were obtainable.
Women seemed to find Brown
somewhat less objectionable (58-
42 split for Nixon) than did the
men (69-31 division). The junior
class was strongest for Nixon;
the seniors, the weakest. The fra
ternities and the row girls were
clearly the most conservative ele
ments on campus, splitting for
Republicans 4 to 1; while eating
clubs and women’s dorms were
the more “liberal” residences,
giving the Republican slightly
less than a 2 to 1 margin. The
only ethnic group on campus that
actually favored Brown was the
“children of government work
ers,” and considering the fact
that many of these are working
for the present Democratic ad
ministration, Brown’s 59 to 58
edge seems less than resounding.
Californians voted 66 per cent for
Nixon, out-of-staters 63 per cent.
After reading through 1863
statements of “primary reasons”
for support of candidates it is
pretty clear that few people really
