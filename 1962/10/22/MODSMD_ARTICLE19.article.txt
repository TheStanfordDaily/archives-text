# Washington Beats Stanford 14-0 As Card Drives Fall Short Three Times
## 
### FETE KING 
For the second straight week,
Stanford’s defense turned in a
creditable performance, only 1o
have it nullified by the lack of a
consistent offense, and the Cards

suffered a 14 0 defeat from Wash- I
ington in Stanford Stadium, Sat- |
urday.
A field that was five yards too [
long and a shifly Husky halfback
named Nat Whitmeyer were too I
great a combination for - the In- i
dians to overcome. Indian drives
fizzled out on the four, three, and !
one yard lines after (hey had
ripped off huge chunks of yard- i
age around midfield.
Whitmeyer was named the
back of the game by sportswrit
ers in the press box. The 170- j
pound speedster outran the In- ;
dians for 11 yards to score the j
Huskies’ first touchdown, scooted
34 more to set up their second

score, and made a leaping inter
ception in the fourth quarter.
ALSO FOR the second straight
week, Stanford gave up a big j
play when it counted. With only |
21 seconds remaining in the first
half, Washington quarterback
Pete Ohler floated a 28-yard pass
to halfback Jim Stiger in the end
zone. Stiger had height and dis
tance on the Indian safety man,
Clark Weaver, and gathered the
ball in for the clinching touch
down.
On the previous play, an Ohler
pass had been snagged by Card
linebacker Ed Cummings, but
hobbled briefly as Cummings fell
to the ground. He still had the
ball, but a referee ruled that the
ball had hit the ground first, and
the pass was incomplete.
Cummings’ near-interception
was typical of the “almost” char
acter of the game. On several key !
plays the Indians came within j
inches of tackling a Husky or:

sewing a touchdown. However,
the rulebook doesn’t reward close
ness in this game, and Stanford
was shut out for the second lime
this year.
MIDWAY' through the second
quarter, Card quarterback Steve
Thurlow directed a 52-yard march
to the Washington four-yard line.
On fourth down, halfback Stan
Lindskog, instead of blocking for
Thurlow as was the plan, ran to
his left for a pass. As Thurlow
cocked his arm to throw to end
Bob Howard, who was all alone in
the end /one, Husky guard Rick
Redman hit him. Thurlaw man
aged to get rid of (he ball, tossing
to Lindskog, who was immediate
ly tackled short of the goal lino.

THAT LEFT the score 14-0 at
j halftime, but Stanford had two
I more futile efforts left. On the
I Huskies’ second play after the
kickoff, fullback Junior Coffey
i fumbled and tackle Al Hildebrand
I pounced on the ball for Stanford.
Only eight yards away from a
■ score, the Tribe found itself back
led up to the 11 after an incom
| plete pass and two pitchouts to
| halfback J. D. Lodato. Thurlow’s
I fourth down aerial to Howard
i was barely knocked away and the
i Huskies took over.

Six plays later, the Indians gave
the Card rooters additional ulcers.
Quarterback Clark Weaver, mix
ing passes and keeper plays beau
tifully, led Stanford 48 yards in
ten plays to Washington’s four.
But a fourth down play failed
again.

On other fronts, Stanford
athletes had a mixture of suc
cess and failure. The frosh
footballers beat San .lose
State 21-12, while the soccer
team beat Menlo 0-1. The
water poloisfcs split two
games, trouncing HOP and
losing to the Olympic Club.
The cross country team lost
to S.IS. Stories will appear
tomorrow.
