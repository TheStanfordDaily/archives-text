# McAfee Brown To Visit Rome
## 
### 
Professor Robert McAfee
Brown has been invited by the
World Reformed Alliance to rep
resent that body as an official
“observer” at the Ecumenical
Council in Rome this spring.
The Presbyterian and Reform
ed churches of the World Re
formed Alliance have chosen Dr.
Brown as their delegate from
North America. Other delegates
are from Scotland and France.
Although the three cannot par
ticipate, they are expected to re
port on the proceedings to the
Protestant World.
The Ecumenical Council is, ac
cording to Brown, “a break
through in understanding be
tween Protestants and Catholics.”
The request for Protestant “ob
servers” at the Council marks the
first such invitation ' in history.
Just last fall five Catholic “ob
servers” were present at the
World Council of Churches meet
ing in New Delhi.
Brown, professor of religion at
Stanford, was until recently, a
faculty member at Union Theo
logical Seminary.
