Stanford fans may have been
disappointed with the Indians’
showing against Washington, but
the Huskies’ coach, Jim Owens,
thought that they did a good job.

best the whole game; Stanford
really kept the pressure up,” said
Owens after the game. He went
on to add that the game was one

of the hardest Washington hart
played all season.
TIIK COACH called the Hus
kies’ goal line defense one of (he
most pleasing features of (he
game. Washington bottled up
Stanford drives inside the ten
three times, once stopping Stan
ford quarterback Clark Weaver
on the two.
Owens also spoke highly of the
Tribe quarterbacks and line.
“Stanford’s line was the equal of
any we’ve player) against,’’ he
said.

ton coach felt that center Ray
Mansfield, halfback Nat Whit
myer, and punter Rick Redman
did outstanding jobs. “Mansfield
played the best game of his ca
reer” said Owens.

injured Charlie Mitchell, scored
one of the Washington touch
