# Stanford Team Not Disheartened
## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
Coach Jack Curtice and the
Stanford football team were far
from dejected after their 14-0 loss
to Washington.
TACKLE A1 Hildebrand
thought that “a lot of the boys
played well, especially some of
the linemen. The offense was
much better than last week, ex
cept we needed a greater variety
of plays near the goal-line. Our
defense w'as great; I’m not sur
prised that they couldn’t move
the ball consistently against this
| team.
“Just take three plays out of
that game, and we would have
had them. That jump pass which
set up their first touchdown was
the first that Thurlow has seen.”
j Steve Thurlow and Clark Weaver
I alternated at safety because the
| two regular safety men, Gary
Craig and Dick Ragsdale, were in-
I jured and unable to play.
| The other two plays to which
| Hildebrand referred were the
touchdown pass thrown over
j Weaver’s head (Weaver is only
15-9 and Cummings’ near inter-
I ception, which would have ended
! Washington’s second touchdown
drive.
GUARD FRANK Dubofsky
echoed Hildebrand’s opinion of
the game. “We just didn’t hit on
our key plays. When we were
around midfield, we could pick
they apart more, but when we
got down near the goal-line they
clogged the middle on us and we
couldn’t get through them.”
Despite the loss, Curtice still
praised his team’s showing. “I
think we played a real good ball
game. With just a little more
punch and just a little more
speed, we would have had them.
I’d like to play them again.”
WE’LL WORK on goal-line of
fense all this week. Our offense
is coming around; those three
sophomore left-halfbacks took
awhile to get used to the plays
and to get their timing down.

touchdown pass thrown over

drive.
GUARD FRANK Dubofsky
echoed Hildebrand’s opinion of
the game. “We just didn’t hit on
our key plays. When we were
around midfield, we could pick
they apart more, but when we
got down near the goal-line they
clogged the middle on us and we
couldn’t get through them.”
Despite the loss, Curtice still
praised his team’s showing. “I
think we played a real good ball
game. With just a little more
punch and just a little more
speed, we would have had them.
I’d like to play them again.”
WE’LL WORK on goal-line of
fense all this week. Our offense
is coming around; those three
sophomore left-halfbacks took
awhile to get used to the plays
and to get their timing down.
