# God Acts Now, Says Rev. Pike

### BETSY WRIGHT 
Don’t regret the past, "ours is
a ‘now’ God. He does make all
things new,” said the Right Rev
erend James A. Pike. Episcopal
Bishop of California, in Memorial
Church yesterday.
With the example of Lot’s wife
who could not deal with “now,”
looked backward, and was frozen
with inaction, Pike gave two
reasons why we should not regret
the past, when he spoke yester
day in Memorial Church.
The first reason was the logical
or philosophical one. Bishop Pike
said simply, “we just don’t
know.” We don’t know the re
sulls of other possible choices, he
said.
The second was the Biblical
reason. That “God pitched his
tent with us,” moans simply that
“He’s right in the mess with us.”
The fully religious answer isn’t
just taking a “bad thing,” it is
God’s power here and now to
make this the right thing. Central
to our religious belief, is this
sensing that we are all in this to
gether, related through God, Pike
said.
Not to regret the past does not
mean irresponsibility. If a mis
take has been made, we must do
our best to rectify it, then forget
it. “Regret” is not the same as
“guilt,” it does not make us
morally upset," it makes us feel
like fools, or stupid, he said.
In conclusion, Pike said don’t
ask God to change things, they
are over. Say “I serve now.” Then
He will make this the place we
want now.
