# Thurber Predicts Close Election
## 
### 
James P. Thurber Jr., former
Assistant to the Deaa of Stan
ford’s graduate division and Dem
ocratic candidate for Congress
from the 10th district, predicted
yesterday at Escondido Village
that his race against incumbent
Congressman Charles S. Cubser
will be “very, very close.”
Thurber, the mayor of Los Al
tos, stated that he would win in
November with 52 per cent of the
vote. Cubser was unavailable for
comment.
Cubser has frequently said that
his ten years seniority, member
ship on the House Armed Serv
ices Committee, and “constructive
record represent my qualifica
tions for election.” Thurber has
denied this, saying that in four
years Cubser introduced 135 bills
and that only one of them passed.

Thurber, a former editor of The
Daily, is in favor of most of Pres

ident Kennedy’s program, sup
porting federal aid to education,
Kennedy’s medicare bill, the
United Nations bond proposal,
and the trade expansion act.
Cubser has voted against all of
these and was listed as Califor
nia’s second-most conservative
Congressman by the Congression
al Quarterly. He also said that the
recently passed FDA bill was “not
necessary.”
