## Chinese Communists Push Indian Troops Back in Undeclared War 
### United Press International 
NEW DELHl—Heavy Chinese Communist forces, backed by
mortar and artillery fire, drove hack Indian troops and overran more
posts yesterday in the second day of an undeclared war on the Sino-
Indian border.
Some sources reported the Indians were forced back as much as
five miles. A Peiping broadcast said Chinese Red forces captured
seven more military strongpoints yesterday.
Indian Defense Minister V. K. Krishna Menon said casualties
were “heavy.” He said Indian troops were retreating "farther and
farther south” on two sectors of the frontier but that Indian troops
were making the Communists fight for “every inch of ground.”
The Communist New China news agency said the Chinese Com
munist foreign ministry has warned the mountainous buffer nation
of Bhutan not to allow Indian troops to enter the country. Authorita
tive reports said Prime Minister Jawaharal Nehru would call par
liament into emergency session.
BRANDT KAYS SOVIETS CONVINCED BERLIN Mayor Willy
Brandt said yesterday United Stales warnings apparently have fi
nally convinced Soviet Premier Nikßa S. Khrushchev that the West
will fight to defend West Berlin.
Brandt made the statement in a speech to the final meeting of
the Social Democratic party congress as Western officials sought to
determine whether the erection of a Soviet army guard tower near
the Berlin wall indicated that the Russians were admitting responsi
bility for the Communist sector of the divided city.
