# Students Resist Rooting Change
## 
### CHRIS CHRISM AN 
Last Saturday’s game saw a
minor and for the most part un
successful attempt to carry out
the LASSU recommendations for
desegregated rooting sections.
Girls who tried to enter the
men’s section wore greeted by
shouts of, “out, out out.” With
the help of student police peace
was quickly established, but with
only token integration.
A few men were sitting in the
women’s section, and there was
an occasional woman in the men’s
section who withstood the har
rassment and threats of violence.
But for the most part the men
seemed content to tan their chests
and chant their poems in their
own section, and the women had
no desire to join them.
There was also little evidence
of a revival in student spirit.
Head yell leader Roger Salquist
admitted that he could hardly
hear the rooting section. The
“gross” yells had been eliminated,
and Salquist’s single new contri
bution to his repertoire of yells
was “Lean to the left.”
There was, however, a marked
improvement in the card stunts
which, contrary to the preceding
game, wore done quickly and
smoothly.
