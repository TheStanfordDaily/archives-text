# Controversial NDEA 'Loyalty Oath' Repealed
## 
### CLIFF PETERSON 
President Kennedy last week
signed a bill repealing the use o!
a “disclaimer of subversive activ
ity” affidavit formerly required
(jf applicants for loans under the
National Defense Education Act.
The disclaimer, usually mis
nomed as the “loyalty oath,” was
a pledge by the applicant that “I
do not believe in, and am not a
member of and do not support
any organization that believes in
or teaches the overthrow of the
United States Government by
force or violence or by any un
constitutional means.”

PROTESTS TO the clause
erupted almost immediately after
the NDEA became law. Numer
ous civic and educational groups
shouted their opposition to the
oath and some 32 colleges and uni
versities refused to become part
of the NDEA loan program.
The objections wore based not
only on the apparent singling out
of students as objects of special
distrust and the lack of principle
in a negative statement of belief,
but on the idea that students
should not have to sign such a
statement as a requisite for as
sistance in their education—in a
sense, should not have to sell
themselves.
In a policy statement of Febru
ary 1959, Frederic O. Glover, Ad
ministrative Assistant to Presi
dent Wallace Sterling was quoted
in The Daily as saying, in part,
Stanford does not believe that
loyalty oaths are effective, and
objected to the oath provision
when discussing the program in
itially with government officials.”
A YEAR LATER, speaking to
a group of students at Wilbur
Hall, Sterling noted that Stanford
participated in the aid program
“because if she did not, she would
be depriving a student of an edu
cation here because of an opinion
Stanford held . . . the student
himself might not have any ob
jections.”
He also observed, “A farmer
does not have to sign an oath to
receive aid from the govern
ment . .

As of September 30 of this year,
a total of 1,048 Stanford students
have received more than $794,000
under the provisions of the 1958
law. In an interview last weekend,
Glover pointed out that for stu
dents who had strong personal
reservations against taking the
oath, the University has offered
substitute funds.

UNDER THE measure signed
last week, which also applies to
a similar clause in National Sci
ence Foundation grants, penalties
of up to $lO,OOO or five years in
prison or both may be levied
against members of “any Commu
nist organization” who apply for,
use, or attempt to use federal
scholarship, fellowship, or loan
funds.

In addition the United States
Office of Education and the Na
tional Science Foundation have
been empowered to revoke for
reasons “in the best interests of
the United States” any stipend
awarded to a graduate student or
researcher, according to the New
York Times.

do not believe in, and am not a
member of and do not support
any organization that believes in
or teaches the overthrow of the
United States Government by
force or violence or by any un
constitutional means.”

PROTESTS TO the clause
erupted almost immediately after
the NDEA became law. Numer
ous civic and educational groups
shouted their opposition to the
oath and some 32 colleges and uni
versities refused to become part
of the NDEA loan program.
The objections wore based not
only on the apparent singling out
of students as objects of special
distrust and the lack of principle
in a negative statement of belief,
but on the idea that students
should not have to sign such a
statement as a requisite for as
sistance in their education—in a
sense, should not have to sell
themselves.
In a policy statement of Febru
ary 1959, Frederic O. Glover, Ad
ministrative Assistant to Presi

in The Daily as saying, in part,
Stanford does not believe that
loyalty oaths are effective, and
objected to the oath provision
when discussing the program in
itially with government officials.”
A YEAR LATER, speaking to
a group of students at Wilbur
Hall, Sterling noted that Stanford
participated in the aid program
“because if she did not, she would
be depriving a student of an edu
cation here because of an opinion
Stanford held . . . the student
himself might not have any ob
jections.”
He also observed, “A farmer
does not have to sign an oath to
receive aid from the govern

As of September 30 of this year,
a total of 1,048 Stanford students
have received more than $794,000
under the provisions of the 1958
law. In an interview last weekend,
Glover pointed out that for stu
dents who had strong personal
reservations against taking the
oath, the University has offered
substitute funds.

UNDER THE measure signed
last week, which also applies to
a similar clause in National Sci

of up to $lO,OOO or five years in
prison or both may be levied
against members of “any Commu

use, or attempt to use federal
scholarship, fellowship, or loan
funds.

In addition the United States
Office of Education and the Na

been empowered to revoke for
reasons “in the best interests of
the United States” any stipend
awarded to a graduate student or
researcher, according to the New

President Kennedy last week
signed a bill repealing the use o!
a “disclaimer of subversive activ
