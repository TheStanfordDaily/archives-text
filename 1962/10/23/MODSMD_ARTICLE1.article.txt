# North Views Impact Of Sin-Indian Crisis
## 
### WILLIAM QUANDT 
Tin- present conflict between India and China lias serious im
plications for the underdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa and
Latin America, as well as for world peace, according to Stanford
Professor of Political Science, Robert C. North. To many of the
poor nations of the world, India and China represent competing

i models of political, economic, and ,
| social development, and it is!
j therefore in Western interests
that the Indian Parliamentary
model, based on a mixed econo
my, should survive and succeed.
Chinese behavior in the present
crisis, says North, cannot be un
derstood apart from historical,
! ideological and psychological mo
tivations. The border areas pres
ently in dispute were, at some
time in history, subject to Chi- (
nese sovereignty, and Chinese |
leaders from Sun Yat-sen to Chi 1
ang Kai-shek and Mao Tse-tung i
have all agreed that these regions j
belong to China.
Such convictions, reinforced by
the ideology of Marxism-Lenin
ism which provides Chinese lead- j
ers with theoretical justification, |
as well as strategy and tactics,
help explain China's aggressive 1
action toward India. The Chinese
believe that India, by defending
the boundary established by the
imperialists (the Mac Mahon
lino), is acting as a “lackey of
imperialism.”
CLOSELY intertwined with
these historical and ideological
motives, says North, is a psycho
logical attitude which requires
the existence of an outside enemy
against which Chinese hostility
can be directed.
“National pride, bitterness
against the West, the expansion
ist ideology of communism, the
frustration inherent in plans for
remolding China ‘overnight,’ a
persistent determination to xe-es-1
tablish the furthermost reaches
of the old empire, the galling re
sistance movements of hitherto
disorganized non-Chinese minori
ties—fused together, these phe
nomena emerge as a virulent Han
(Chinese) nationalism, Commu
nist-organized and disciplined,
which is likely to strike out with
more and more aggx-essiveness
the more it is blocked by internal
difficulties and by inevitable con
sti'aints from the outside.”
The implication of the present
dispute for Sino-Soviet relations
axe groat, for Russia is in the em
barrassing position of being tier
i to both India and China. Although
i Khrushchev seems to be willing
i to tolerate the border conflict on
■ a small scale, the threatening con-
I sequences of all out war arc more
i than he could accept.
INDIAN attitudes toward Chi
na are also undergoing a pro
found change, according to North.
During his stay in India during
1953-54, the feeling of many In
dian intellectuals was that China
could do no wiong. Evil was
readily attributed to Western,
; and especially U.S. imperialism.
By 1958, however, thanks to
j Chinese Communist behavior on
: the Indian frontier many of the
I same intellectuals weie beginning
j to see China as a potential threat
I and to view U.S. policy more tol
; | erantly.
It now seems quite possible
that the current Sino-lindian con
flict could bring about further
significant changes in Indian per
} ceptions and attitudes toward
| China, which in turn might have
j a profound influence on events
' in Asia.
