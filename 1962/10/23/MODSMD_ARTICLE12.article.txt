# Invade Cuba
## 
### 
From time to time in the history of every nation unusual pro
vocation makes a resort to war inevitable and justifiable. Such
was the provocation in 1939 and again in 1941. Such was not the
provocation in 1898.
And such was not the provocation to the United States in 1959
or 1960 or 1961 or even through September of this year. But
today we know what President Kennedy has known for several
days: that there are on Cuban soil intermediate range ballistic
missiles capable of striking against points as distant as Mexico
City and our own capital. Whether these missiles have been dis
mantled and deployed is uncertain. Their presence is certain.
Whether nuclear warheads have been shipped into Cuba is also
unknown.
The danger to the United States constitutes a provocation
that justifies an invasion of Cuba. Cuba is now armed with an
offensive capability which is intolerable. It is a threat to the
security ol the United States. Whether an invasion may be justified
in the context of international law is irrelevant.
In this situation the United States finds itself applying a
double standard: onr military bases and IRBM’s in Turkey and
Europe are in some ways analogous to the Russian base and
IRBM’s now present in Castro’s Cuba. The only defense against
the charge of hypocrisy is that when we are right and they are
wrong, a single standard has no meaning. Defending the life and
liberty of Americans is not analogous to the imperialist expansion
ism of Russian Communism.
The advocacy of invasion implies the inadequacy of blockade.
A blockade is inadequate because it may be too late. Nuclear
warheads may already be in Cuba. If missiles are there, so may
be warheads. And without any foolproof ballistic missile warning
system along the southern coast of the U.S., the nation may find
itself exposed to nuclear blackmail from Russia and Cuba.
Whatever the problems that can be solved by invasion, there
is no denying that an invasion would raise many, if less serious,
problems. Who would succeed Castro and pacify his supporters?
How could democracy be instituted and stability maintained?
And these questions do not even ask how many lives would be
lost in an invasion attempt.

liberty of Americans is not analogous to the imperialist expansion
ism of Russian Communism.
The advocacy of invasion implies the inadequacy of blockade.
A blockade is inadequate because it may be too late. Nuclear
warheads may already be in Cuba. If missiles are there, so may
be warheads. And without any foolproof ballistic missile warning
system along the southern coast of the U.S., the nation may find
itself exposed to nuclear blackmail from Russia and Cuba.
Whatever the problems that can be solved by invasion, there
is no denying that an invasion would raise many, if less serious,
problems. Who would succeed Castro and pacify his supporters?
How could democracy be instituted and stability maintained?
And these questions do not even ask how many lives would be
lost in an invasion attempt.
From time to time in the history of every nation unusual pro
vocation makes a resort to war inevitable and justifiable. Such
was the provocation in 1939 and again in 1941. Such was not the
provocation in 1898.
And such was not the provocation to the United States in 1959
or 1960 or 1961 or even through September of this year. But
today we know what President Kennedy has known for several
days: that there are on Cuban soil intermediate range ballistic
missiles capable of striking against points as distant as Mexico
City and our own capital. Whether these missiles have been dis
mantled and deployed is uncertain. Their presence is certain.
Whether nuclear warheads have been shipped into Cuba is also
unknown.
The danger to the United States constitutes a provocation
that justifies an invasion of Cuba. Cuba is now armed with an
offensive capability which is intolerable. It is a threat to the
security ol the United States. Whether an invasion may be justified
in the context of international law is irrelevant.
In this situation the United States finds itself applying a
double standard: onr military bases and IRBM’s in Turkey and
Europe are in some ways analogous to the Russian base and
IRBM’s now present in Castro’s Cuba. The only defense against
the charge of hypocrisy is that when we are right and they are
wrong, a single standard has no meaning. Defending the life and
liberty of Americans is not analogous to the imperialist expansion
ism of Russian Communism.
