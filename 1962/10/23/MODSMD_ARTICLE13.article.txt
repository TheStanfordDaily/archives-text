Editor, The Daily:
There has recently been a great
deal of criticism of the foreign
campus program. In case prospec
tive overseas students are getting
discouraged, may I point out that
we were not usually “forced to
study psychology,” which has
only been taught once at one
campus; most of us, in Germany
at least, did learn to speak the
language even though we weren’t
“forced” to; many of us learned
to know and love families even
though not living with them; and
I at least regard my six months
at a foreign campus as the great
est experience of my life.
Melanie Humphrey
Editor, The Daily:
The suggestion in Monday’s
editorial that the language re
quirement of the foreign cam
puses be increased to five quar
ters is one of the most ill-consid
eied recommendations I have
seen yet. I will grant that two
quarters is not sufficient to guar
antee fluency in a language, and
that fluency certainly increases
the value of the European exper
ience, but two important points
have been ignored.
(1) The objective of the pro
gram is to offer the opportunity
of study in Europe to a broad
base of students, from engineers
to philosophy students, on the
premise that such study is valu
able, per se. The requirement of
five quarters preparation would
eliminate the great majority of
these students from eligibility,
for their academic programs sim
ply could not afford the added
load.
(2) Those students who do have
the time to attain fluency in a
foreign language might just as
well attend a foreign university
to gain full benefit from the time
spent overseas.
Unless we desire to limit the
opportunity of study abroad to
language majors, there is little
reason in changing the current
policy, which requires two quar
ters and recommends as many as
the student can handle.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to join the fray
with a few suggestions on the
overseas campuses. My experi
ence at Stanford-in-Germany was
invaluable and I doubt that I
would ever have seen Europe if
it had not been for Stanford’s pro
gram. The reasons are mostly eco
nomic. But there is room for im
provement.
One simple, though radical,
change would solve many prob
lems. Grades should be abolished
and instead, simple credit be
given for satisfactory completion
of the work. This is presently the
policy for units transferred from
other colleges. The reasons for
this change are that grades at
foreign campuses are, of neces
sity, highly arbitrary. The courses
are of a general nature—History,
Art, Literature, etc. Therefore the
student is ranked according to his
score on a one-shot subjective ex
am. Results rarely coincide with
knowledge of the pertinent ma
terial and are certainly no fair
measure of a student’s “worth” or
of his intellectual growth.
Also the students overseas have
an average GPA of better than
3.0, but standard curves are still
applied. Another injurious effect
of grades is to reward those stu
dents who remain at the school
on weekends and evenings, pun
ishing those who seek to broaden
their experience through travel
and cultural pursuits. Grade in
centives also discourage contact
with German families and Ger
man students; and generally they
cast a pall over the campus.
The results of such a change
would be to broaden significantly
the overseas experience and to
force the University to send stim
ulating professors.
The administration may say,
“But the students will do nothing
but carouse.” Perhaps, however
the University’s job is not to dis
cipline her children but to wean
them.
Two quarters of German are
sufficient so that in a matter of a
few weeks the student can con
verse intelligently in the native
language. Learning the language
is strictly an individual matter of
effort.

eied recommendations I have
seen yet. I will grant that two
quarters is not sufficient to guar
antee fluency in a language, and
that fluency certainly increases
the value of the European exper
ience, but two important points
have been ignored.
(1) The objective of the pro
gram is to offer the opportunity
of study in Europe to a broad
base of students, from engineers
to philosophy students, on the
premise that such study is valu
able, per se. The requirement of
five quarters preparation would
eliminate the great majority of
these students from eligibility,
for their academic programs sim
ply could not afford the added
load.
(2) Those students who do have
the time to attain fluency in a
foreign language might just as
well attend a foreign university
to gain full benefit from the time
spent overseas.
Unless we desire to limit the
opportunity of study abroad to
language majors, there is little
reason in changing the current
policy, which requires two quar
ters and recommends as many as
the student can handle.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to join the fray
with a few suggestions on the
overseas campuses. My experi
ence at Stanford-in-Germany was
invaluable and I doubt that I
would ever have seen Europe if
it had not been for Stanford’s pro
gram. The reasons are mostly eco
nomic. But there is room for im
provement.
One simple, though radical,
change would solve many prob
lems. Grades should be abolished
and instead, simple credit be
given for satisfactory completion
of the work. This is presently the
policy for units transferred from
other colleges. The reasons for
this change are that grades at
foreign campuses are, of neces
sity, highly arbitrary. The courses
are of a general nature—History,
Art, Literature, etc. Therefore the
student is ranked according to his
score on a one-shot subjective ex
am. Results rarely coincide with
knowledge of the pertinent ma
terial and are certainly no fair
measure of a student’s “worth” or
of his intellectual growth.
Also the students overseas have
an average GPA of better than
3.0, but standard curves are still
applied. Another injurious effect
of grades is to reward those stu
dents who remain at the school
on weekends and evenings, pun
ishing those who seek to broaden
their experience through travel
and cultural pursuits. Grade in
centives also discourage contact
with German families and Ger
man students; and generally they
cast a pall over the campus.
The results of such a change
would be to broaden significantly
the overseas experience and to
force the University to send stim
ulating professors.
The administration may say,
“But the students will do nothing
but carouse.” Perhaps, however
the University’s job is not to dis
cipline her children but to wean
them.
Two quarters of German are
sufficient so that in a matter of a
few weeks the student can con
verse intelligently in the native
language. Learning the language
is strictly an individual matter of
effort.

There has recently been a great
deal of criticism of the foreign
campus program. In case prospec
tive overseas students are getting
discouraged, may I point out that
we were not usually “forced to
study psychology,” which has
only been taught once at one
campus; most of us, in Germany
at least, did learn to speak the
language even though we weren’t
“forced” to; many of us learned
to know and love families even
though not living with them; and
I at least regard my six months
at a foreign campus as the great
est experience of my life.

spent overseas.
Unless we desire to limit the
opportunity of study abroad to
language majors, there is little
reason in changing the current
policy, which requires two quar
ters and recommends as many as
the student can handle.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to join the fray
with a few suggestions on the
overseas campuses. My experi
ence at Stanford-in-Germany was
invaluable and I doubt that I
would ever have seen Europe if
it had not been for Stanford’s pro
gram. The reasons are mostly eco
nomic. But there is room for im
provement.
One simple, though radical,
change would solve many prob
lems. Grades should be abolished
and instead, simple credit be
given for satisfactory completion
of the work. This is presently the
policy for units transferred from
other colleges. The reasons for
this change are that grades at
foreign campuses are, of neces
sity, highly arbitrary. The courses
are of a general nature—History,
Art, Literature, etc. Therefore the
student is ranked according to his
score on a one-shot subjective ex
am. Results rarely coincide with
knowledge of the pertinent ma
terial and are certainly no fair
measure of a student’s “worth” or
of his intellectual growth.
Also the students overseas have
an average GPA of better than
3.0, but standard curves are still
applied. Another injurious effect
of grades is to reward those stu
dents who remain at the school
on weekends and evenings, pun
ishing those who seek to broaden
their experience through travel
and cultural pursuits. Grade in
centives also discourage contact
with German families and Ger
man students; and generally they
cast a pall over the campus.
The results of such a change
would be to broaden significantly
the overseas experience and to
force the University to send stim
ulating professors.
The administration may say,
“But the students will do nothing
but carouse.” Perhaps, however
the University’s job is not to dis
cipline her children but to wean
them.
Two quarters of German are
sufficient so that in a matter of a
few weeks the student can con
verse intelligently in the native
language. Learning the language
is strictly an individual matter of
effort.
