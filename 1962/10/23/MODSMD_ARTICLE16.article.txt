# MUSICAL REVIEW
## 'Oliver Twist' Adapted Well for Musical Stage 
### JOSEPH L. JACOBS 
“Why,” people asked, “did you want to make a musical of
‘Oliver Twist?’ ” “Because,” replied Lionel Bart, author of the book,
music, and lyrics for “Oliver!,” “I am both a cockney and a Jew.”

It was with this background that Bart took Dickens’ famous
classic about Fagin, the cockney-Jewish leader of a gang of thieves,

Nancy, the tragic heroine who-*
died trying to help Oliver, evil j
Bill Sikes, the comic Artful Dodg
er, and Oliver himself, and “freely
adapted” it for the musical stage.
SINCE ITS publication in 1837,
"Oliver Twist” has been criticized
as an anti-Semitic book. But Bart,
by making Fagin into an amusing
and almost lovable rogue, has suc
ceeded in satisfying almost every
one but the Dickens purist. For
his Fagin, who sings that he’s
“finding it hard to be really as
black as they paint,” is one of the
funniest and most delightful
scoundrels ever to have appeared
on the stage. His song, “You’ve
Got to Pick a Pocket or Two,” in
which he and the boys teach
Oliver the fine art of picking
pockets, is a marvel of comic in
vention.

The entire show, in fact, is a
marvel, and there are only two
minor reservations in recom
mending it; if the plot seems a bit
melodramatic, this is probably
more Dickens’ fault than it is
Bart’s, and if Geoffrey Lumb. as
Mr. Brownlow, does an extremely
poor job of acting, the rest of the
cast makes up for this one rotten
apple in an otherwise delicious
barrel.

Two of the show’s strongest as
sets are its amazing set and its
rapid pace. These are the crea
tion of Sean Kenney, the set de
signer, and Peter Coe, the direc
tor.

IT IS impossible to describe
verbally the complexities of Ken
ney’s set, which, with its revolv
ing turntable, is an exact dupli
cate of the one used in the Lon
don production. I can only say
that it is superior to any set I
have seen in 12 years of play
going, and is itself worth the
price of admission.
Coe, who directed the London
production now in its third year,
has used the set brilliantly. At the
end of the first scene Mr. Bumble
and Oliver get on the turntable,
the lights dim, a sign and a set of
bars used in the first scene fly up
out of sight, men with lanterns
cross the stage to indicate London
at night, the turntable slowly re
volves, and Mr. Bumble sings
“Boy For Sale” while walking on
the turntable. At the end of the
song the turntable stops, the men
with lanterns disappear, the
lights come up, Mr. Bumble opens
a door and walks into the next
scene’s set. It is, in a word, mag
nificent. And the entire play bene
fits from this sort of originality
in its direction.

The acting is. on the whole, ex
cellent. Clive Revill’s superb por
trayal of Fagin will live in the
atrical history, along with Mary
Martin’s Nellie Forbush and Al
fred Drake’s Hajj.
REVILI, wisely chose not to
use a Jewish accent, and it is only
the Semitic sound of his songs
that reminds the audience of his
religious heritage. With every
gesture and bit of business he
adds to an indelible portrait of the
perfect Fagin. When, at the end,
he tries to convince the audience
—and himself as well—that he
can indeed go straight, he is pa
thetic and hilarious in away that
few actors can hope to be.
GEORGIA Brown, as Nancy, is
also brilliant. She uses her strong
and beautiful voice to great ad
vantage and easily fills the the
ater. She can clown her way
through “I’d Do Anything” and
“It’s a Fine Life" with a joie de
vivre that overflows across the
footlights, yet she can be touch
ingly tragic when singing her
lovely ballad, “As Long As He
Needs Me.”

Bruce Prochnik is a delightful
Oliver, and his voice is surpris

ingly good for one so young. He
is especially effective in “Who
Will Buy?”—the show’s best
number- and “Where Is Love?” a
song that could easily become a
popular hit. Michael Goodman is
equally as good as the Artful
Dodger—a sort of young Alfred
Doolittle. His joyous song, “Con
sider Yourself,” is another of the
production’s high points.
Willoughby Goddard, Hope
Jackman. Danny Sewell. Dortha
Duckworth, and a chorus of
young boys are all excellent in
supporting roles.
"Oliver!” will be at the Curran
in San Francisco until November
17th. It is a show with an esprit
de corps rarely seen in a profes
sional production, and will most
assuredly duplicate its London
success when it reaches New
York in December.
