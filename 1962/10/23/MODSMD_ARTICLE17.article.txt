Editor, The Daily:
As co-chairman of the student
opinion poll, I am more than sym
pathetic to the Daily reporter’s
insight into the primary problem
of making a political preference
poll of any validity in a student
body almost 70 per cent Republi
can. Nonetheless, certain conclu
sions were not mentioned in Mon
day’s article which merit recogni
tion: (1) California Republicans
are holding to their party line
better than Republicans in the
rest of the United States; and (2)
Independent California “voters”
favor Nixon although out-of-state
Independents are found to favor
Brown. With Nixon requiring
over 90 per cent of the registered
Republicans and 20 per cent of
the registered Democrats to win,
the poll finds Nixon possessing
the necessary Republican sup
port, but only 15 per cent of the
Democrats. Whether the Inde
pendent voters can overcome the
deficit of five per cent which Nix
on needs for election is a ques
tionable possibility. Thus, even
though the Stanford students fa
vored Nixon 1,210 to 655 an in
spection of party loyalties attests
to the narrowness of this Cali
fornia race.

Re the girl appearing next to
the back of my head in the pic
ture on the front page of The
Daily yesterday:
1) The girl is not a Stanford
coed. She goes to Cal.
2) She is violently opposed to
integrated rooting sections and
enjoys nothing more than a good
pre-game drunk, followed by riots
in the rooting section.
3) She wasn’t sitting in the
rooting section; she just happen
ed to be walking by when mild
mannered Ralph Peer II snapped
her picture.
3) She wishes to commend The
Daily and its staff for eternaliz
ing her in the annals of college
journalism.
