# Mirror, Mirror On the Wall Who's Grossest Of Them All?
## 
### BRAD EFRON 
Gross, An ugly word 1o road,
an ugly word to write, an ugly
wox'd to even think about. Yet,
surprisingly enough, a word that
applies to a great many of the
supposedly mature members of
the Stanford family. Nearly all of
them, as a matter of fact. Let us
look at the discouraging facts,
one by one:
1— Year after year, issue after
issue, more students read the
Chaparral than the Sequoia, even
though the latter is vastly superi
or in intellectual content. It is
well known that the “Chappie”
consists mainly of smutty jokes,
smutty stories, and innuendoes
about sex.
2 Year after year, issue after
issue, more students read the
Stanford Daily than the Chapar
ral, even though the latter is
vastly superior in intellectual
content. The Daily is the news
paper that says (about Stanford
women) “We’d like to sleep with
you. but we won't sit with you.”
5 Stanford students swear a
lot. especially the boys, but some
times the girls too. I personally
have never been in a campus dis
cussion of more than a few min
utes duration that wasn’t sullied
by a “h—ck,” a “d—rn,” or a
“h—ll.” I even find myself throw
ing litem in, just to be “one of the
gang.” Is this the purpose of a
great university?
4—Stanford students drink a
lot, especially the boys, but es
pecially the girls too. Can we no
longer enjoy ourselves without
the artificial stimulation of booze?
Apparently not. It is well-known
that many fraternities force-feed
their pledges Coca-colas spiked
with aspirins before every ex
change.
6 Promiscuity on the Stanford
campus is reaching floodgate pro
portions. “Dates” these days con
sist mainly of smutty jokes,
smutty stories, and innuendoes
about sex. One would think that
college students would leave neck
ing in closed automobiles behind
when they left high school. Such
is not the case at Stanford.
6—The shame of our rest
rooms. Have YOU looked at the
inside wall of the Memorial Li
brary men’s room lately? (Of any
of a half-dozen other men’s rooms
about campus?) This type of “lit
erature” belongs on a back-alley
fence or in a saloon, not at a
great university. The fences in
back of Bolivar and Lathrop
houses are similarly defaced.
These are the facts of the mat
ter, and they add up to a one
word description of the Stanford
way of life—gross. Gross, Gross,
Gross! We are on an ever-de
scending downward spiral of de
pravity. The situation would be
entirely hopeless if it weren’t for
the renewed activity of the one
relatively unsmirched organiza
tion left on this entire campus.
I refer, of course, to LASSU,
Stanford’s own student legisla
ture.
Surprisingly few students seem
to realize that LASSU’s regular
meetings are open to all of those
who are interested. Should you
walk over to Bowman Alumni
House this Thursday evening,
push your way past the great
pressed-wood doors, and crouch
against the wall (chairs are or
dinarily in short supply), you
would probably be amazed by the
great intensity and duration of
the debate. Do not be misled by
the apparent triviality of the top
ics discussed. Do you think nearly
full-grown men and women would
waste valuable time hashing and
rehashing minutiae? Hardly.
SPECIFICALLY, just what
steps is our heads-up Legislature
taking to combat smut on the
Stanford campus? They have
( launched a many-pronged attack
to nip the dirt at its very source
-—the individual student.
ITEM: Students have been
swearing and carrying on at the
Sunday night flicks, much to the
annoyance of the elderly non-stu
dents in the audience. Solution:
non-students will no longer be
admitted. If this doesn’t work,
students will no longer be admit
ted either.
ITEM: students have been
swearing and carrying on at the
football games, much to the an
noyance of the Legislature. Solu
tion: desegregate the rooting sec
tions, now divided according to
sex. This last step has taken an
enormous amount of courage on
LASSU’s part, since the students
whom they represent have indi
cated overwhelmingly that they
want segregation at the games.
To get around this technicality,
Daily editor Nils Wessell has pro
posed the doctrine of Legislative
Infallibility. In his own words,
“Last week (before the campus
poll favoring segregation was
taken) Legislature recommended
the desegregation of the rooting
sections. I see no reason for Leg
islature to change its mind now.”
Even though the students ignored
Wessell’s courageous stand last
Saturday, the principle of infalli
bility will continue to play a
prominent role in LASSU’s un
ending battle against the gross
nature of the average Stanford
citizen.

5 Stanford students swear a
lot. especially the boys, but some
times the girls too. I personally
have never been in a campus dis
cussion of more than a few min

by a “h—ck,” a “d—rn,” or a
“h—ll.” I even find myself throw

the artificial stimulation of booze?
Apparently not. It is well-known
that many fraternities force-feed
their pledges Coca-colas spiked
with aspirins before every ex
change.
6 Promiscuity on the Stanford
campus is reaching floodgate pro
portions. “Dates” these days con
sist mainly of smutty jokes,
smutty stories, and innuendoes
about sex. One would think that
college students would leave neck
ing in closed automobiles behind
when they left high school. Such
is not the case at Stanford.
6—The shame of our rest
rooms. Have YOU looked at the
inside wall of the Memorial Li
brary men’s room lately? (Of any
of a half-dozen other men’s rooms
about campus?) This type of “lit
erature” belongs on a back-alley
fence or in a saloon, not at a
great university. The fences in
back of Bolivar and Lathrop
houses are similarly defaced.
These are the facts of the mat
ter, and they add up to a one
word description of the Stanford
way of life—gross. Gross, Gross,
Gross! We are on an ever-de
scending downward spiral of de
pravity. The situation would be
entirely hopeless if it weren’t for
the renewed activity of the one
relatively unsmirched organiza
tion left on this entire campus.
I refer, of course, to LASSU,
Stanford’s own student legisla
ture.
Surprisingly few students seem
to realize that LASSU’s regular
meetings are open to all of those
who are interested. Should you
walk over to Bowman Alumni
House this Thursday evening,
push your way past the great
pressed-wood doors, and crouch
against the wall (chairs are or
dinarily in short supply), you
would probably be amazed by the
great intensity and duration of
the debate. Do not be misled by
the apparent triviality of the top
ics discussed. Do you think nearly
full-grown men and women would
waste valuable time hashing and
rehashing minutiae? Hardly.
SPECIFICALLY, just what
steps is our heads-up Legislature
taking to combat smut on the
Stanford campus? They have
( launched a many-pronged attack
to nip the dirt at its very source
-—the individual student.
ITEM: Students have been
swearing and carrying on at the
Sunday night flicks, much to the
annoyance of the elderly non-stu
dents in the audience. Solution:
non-students will no longer be
admitted. If this doesn’t work,
students will no longer be admit
ted either.
ITEM: students have been
swearing and carrying on at the
football games, much to the an
noyance of the Legislature. Solu
tion: desegregate the rooting sec
tions, now divided according to
sex. This last step has taken an
enormous amount of courage on
LASSU’s part, since the students
whom they represent have indi
cated overwhelmingly that they
want segregation at the games.
To get around this technicality,
Daily editor Nils Wessell has pro
posed the doctrine of Legislative
Infallibility. In his own words,
“Last week (before the campus
poll favoring segregation was
taken) Legislature recommended
the desegregation of the rooting
sections. I see no reason for Leg
islature to change its mind now.”
Even though the students ignored
Wessell’s courageous stand last
Saturday, the principle of infalli
bility will continue to play a
prominent role in LASSU’s un
ending battle against the gross
nature of the average Stanford
citizen.

portions. “Dates” these days con
sist mainly of smutty jokes,
smutty stories, and innuendoes
about sex. One would think that
college students would leave neck
ing in closed automobiles behind
when they left high school. Such
is not the case at Stanford.
6—The shame of our rest
rooms. Have YOU looked at the
inside wall of the Memorial Li
brary men’s room lately? (Of any
of a half-dozen other men’s rooms
about campus?) This type of “lit
erature” belongs on a back-alley
fence or in a saloon, not at a
great university. The fences in
back of Bolivar and Lathrop
houses are similarly defaced.
These are the facts of the mat
ter, and they add up to a one
word description of the Stanford
way of life—gross. Gross, Gross,
Gross! We are on an ever-de
scending downward spiral of de
pravity. The situation would be
entirely hopeless if it weren’t for
the renewed activity of the one
relatively unsmirched organiza
tion left on this entire campus.
I refer, of course, to LASSU,
Stanford’s own student legisla
ture.
Surprisingly few students seem
to realize that LASSU’s regular
meetings are open to all of those
who are interested. Should you
walk over to Bowman Alumni
House this Thursday evening,
push your way past the great
pressed-wood doors, and crouch
against the wall (chairs are or
dinarily in short supply), you
would probably be amazed by the
great intensity and duration of
the debate. Do not be misled by
the apparent triviality of the top
ics discussed. Do you think nearly
full-grown men and women would
waste valuable time hashing and
rehashing minutiae? Hardly.
SPECIFICALLY, just what
steps is our heads-up Legislature
taking to combat smut on the
Stanford campus? They have
( launched a many-pronged attack
to nip the dirt at its very source
-—the individual student.
ITEM: Students have been
swearing and carrying on at the
Sunday night flicks, much to the
annoyance of the elderly non-stu
dents in the audience. Solution:
non-students will no longer be
admitted. If this doesn’t work,
students will no longer be admit
ted either.
ITEM: students have been
swearing and carrying on at the
football games, much to the an
noyance of the Legislature. Solu
tion: desegregate the rooting sec
tions, now divided according to
sex. This last step has taken an
enormous amount of courage on
LASSU’s part, since the students
whom they represent have indi
cated overwhelmingly that they
want segregation at the games.
To get around this technicality,
Daily editor Nils Wessell has pro
posed the doctrine of Legislative
Infallibility. In his own words,
“Last week (before the campus
poll favoring segregation was
taken) Legislature recommended
the desegregation of the rooting
sections. I see no reason for Leg
islature to change its mind now.”
Even though the students ignored
Wessell’s courageous stand last
Saturday, the principle of infalli
bility will continue to play a
prominent role in LASSU’s un
ending battle against the gross
nature of the average Stanford
citizen.
Gross, An ugly word 1o road,
an ugly word to write, an ugly
wox'd to even think about. Yet,
surprisingly enough, a word that
applies to a great many of the
supposedly mature members of
the Stanford family. Nearly all of
them, as a matter of fact. Let us
look at the discouraging facts,
one by one:
1— Year after year, issue after
issue, more students read the
Chaparral than the Sequoia, even
though the latter is vastly superi
or in intellectual content. It is
well known that the “Chappie”
consists mainly of smutty jokes,
smutty stories, and innuendoes
about sex.
2 Year after year, issue after
issue, more students read the
Stanford Daily than the Chapar
ral, even though the latter is
vastly superior in intellectual
content. The Daily is the news
paper that says (about Stanford
women) “We’d like to sleep with
you. but we won't sit with you.”
5 Stanford students swear a
lot. especially the boys, but some
times the girls too. I personally
have never been in a campus dis
cussion of more than a few min
utes duration that wasn’t sullied
by a “h—ck,” a “d—rn,” or a
“h—ll.” I even find myself throw
ing litem in, just to be “one of the
gang.” Is this the purpose of a
great university?
4—Stanford students drink a
lot, especially the boys, but es
pecially the girls too. Can we no
longer enjoy ourselves without
the artificial stimulation of booze?
Apparently not. It is well-known
that many fraternities force-feed
their pledges Coca-colas spiked
with aspirins before every ex
change.
