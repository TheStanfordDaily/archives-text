### GERRY FRY 
Friday afternoon, Danny Mur
phy set a new Stanford course
record in leading San Jose State
to a 19-40 victory (low score
wins) over Stanford in a dual
cross country meet filled with
outstanding performances. Mur
phy's time for the 4.2-mile course
was a fine 20:09.2. This time heat
the course record of 20:15.8 set
by Max Truex, the former Olym
pic star, who, in the meet with
Russia this summer, finished sec
ond in the 10,000 meters.
Even though losing, the In
dians turned in an outstanding
performance themselves. The
time for Stanfordâ€™s first five run
ners was the third best ever on
this course, which was set up
back in 1956.
Stanford freshman Dave Deuh
nor gave Murphy a real battle,
but; finally fell back to sixth. Har
ry McCalla notched third for the
Cards with a fine 20:33 time.
