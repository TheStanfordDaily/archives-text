## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
A crowd of over four hundred
gathered at Encina pool this Sat

urday morning for the water polo
game of the year, between the
undefeated Stanford varsity and
the undefeated Olympic club of
San Francisco. The crowd was not
disappointed. Stanford finally lost
7-4 after a frantic, bruising con
test.
The Indians went ahead 1-0 in
the first period, when right-for
ward Pete Pettigrew broke away
from his man, took a pass from
Mike Conn and beat the O cluh
goalie, Chris Green, with a shot
to the near side of the cage.
After Bob Gaughran tied the
game at one all, the Indians suc
cessfully carried out a play, with
five seconds left in the first quar
ter, which set up Marty Hull in
front of the goal, Hull scored and
it was 2-1,
Bob Gaughran tied the game in
(he second quarter with a penally
shot. Then Hull put Stanford
ahead with the shot of the day.
He grabbed his own rebound and
with his back to the goal,
whipped the ball across his body
and back-flipped it into the goal.
But the amazing Gaughran tied
the game a third time, when he
scored on a pass from Bill Ready.
After halftime goals by Art
Lambert and George Harrison
put the Olympic club ahead to
stay. In the fourth quarter Hull
scored from thirty feet out, but
this was the last Stanford goal.
The Olympic club picked up two
more at the end of the game
w'hen Stanford was forced to use
a six-man press in a desperate
effort to save the game.
The Olympic club players were
an average of 20 pounds heavier
and five years older than their
Stanford counterparts.
