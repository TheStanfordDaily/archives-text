### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford played its second soc
cer game in four days against

won it, 6-1. The win made the
Card season record 4-2.
It was center-forward Stu
Rawlings and inside-forward Don
Griffith who provided the scoring
punch. Rawlings scored three
times and Griffith tallied twice.
After taking a 2-1 halftime lead,

Stanford completely dominated
the second half and won going
away. Rawlings scored with only
1:40 gone in the third quarter
after a pass from. AI Nnoli, and
10 minutes later it was 4-1 on
Griffithâ€™s second tally.

Stanford coach Fred Priddlt
was pleased with the defensive
work of fullback Sandy Pofuhl
and the playmaking of Klaas
Bergman. Needless to say, he also
liked the scoring of Rawlings and
Griffith.
