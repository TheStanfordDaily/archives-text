## Nehru Readies India for War 
### 
NEW DELHI (UPD Premier
Jawaharlal Nehru placed India's
economy on a war footing last
night and pledged to lead his
country to victory over Commu
nist China which he called an
“enemy.” But early today Peiping
announced still another offensive
in the undeclared border war.
Yesterday the Chinese Commu
nists opened a third front at the
extreme eastern end of the bor
der. massed troops for another
offensive and sent tanks rumbling
toward an important Indian air
base in the Ladakh area at the
western end of the border.
Attacks by Chinese veterans of
the Korean war, surging forward
in human waves, have driven five
miles into India and overrun doz
ens of border positions. The Com
munists were reported massing
troops for a fourth front in the
northeastern border area.
For the first time Peiping re
ferred to a Chinese offensive. In
all past attacks it has insisted
that China acted in self-defense.
It said the Chinese offensive had
sent the “aggressive Indian
troops” fleeing toward India.
Nehru’s speech was the first
time he had used the word “en
emy” in referring to the Chinese
Communist regime with whom he
has had warm contacts in the
past. He also spoke of Chinese
"aggression” but predicted that
India will be victorious in the
end.

There were reports in London
diplomatic circles that India had
asked Soviet Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev to intervene in the
dispute. The Soviets, caught in
the middle between ally and
friend, remained silent on the bor
der war for the fourth day.
