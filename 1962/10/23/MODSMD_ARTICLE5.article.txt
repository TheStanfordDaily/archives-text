# New Facts Presented in Colorado Press Dispute
## 
### PHILIP DE GUERE 
Now facts in the controversy
over articles criticizing Senator
Barry Goldwater and former
President Eisenhower in the Uni
versity of Colorado Daily were
revealed yesterday in a telephone
interview with Gary Althen, ex
editor of the paper, and Carl
Mitcham, a former Stanford stu
dent and author of the articles.
Mitcham’s first article slashing
Goldwater appeared in The Daily
Friday, Sept. 21, and was attacked
the following Monday by Dale
Atkins, candidate for the Board of ]
Regents in Colorado. Althen de
fended Mitcham the following day
in print.
THE SAME DAY both Althen
and university President Quigg
Newton wired apologies to Gold
water, the former for “offending
him” but not for printing the ar
ticle. “From then on it was a
fool’s rush to apologize longest
and loudest,” Mitcham said.
Goldwater then lamented that

“un-American policy” was dis
played in the college press and
demanded that Newton reorga
nize the Daily staff. The president
refused stating, “We have a genu
ine democracy on our campus.”
But Althen printed Mitcham’s
second piece in which he attacked
both President Kennedy and for
mer President Eisenhower. This
letter appeared six days before
Eisenhower was due to arrive in
Colorado and was widely inter
preted as an attempt by the lib
eral Daily to vilify him. Mitcham,
however, stated that he had not
known of the former president’s
visit.

SIX WAVS after the first ar
ticle appeared, a local newspaper
ran excerpts from the second
piece on the same page as the an
nouncement of Eisenhower’s ar
rival. Mitcham said that in this
article he was “quoted out of con
text” so that it appeared to be
solely an attack on Eisenhower.
At this point Altlien was called
from one of his classes to receive
a one-sentence note saying that
he had been fired.

Newton’s later attempts to have
the Board of Publications official
ly remove Althen and to have the
Department of Journalism take
over the administration of the
paper were defeated.
ALTHEN is due to appear be
fore the disciplinary committee
to morrow to explain his actions,
Mitcham reported. A student ref
erendum will be held today or to
morrow to vote upon his dismis
sal. Depending on the results of
the referendum, Althen may ap
peal Newton's action to the
Board of Regents which would
result in a detailed investigation.

Meanwhile Jon Kolowitz was
appointed interim editor, and in
protest the Managing. City, News,
and Wire Editors of The Daily re
signed.

Mitcham’s first article slashing
Goldwater appeared in The Daily
Friday, Sept. 21, and was attacked
the following Monday by Dale
Atkins, candidate for the Board of ]
Regents in Colorado. Althen de
fended Mitcham the following day
in print.
THE SAME DAY both Althen
and university President Quigg
Newton wired apologies to Gold
water, the former for “offending
him” but not for printing the ar
ticle. “From then on it was a
fool’s rush to apologize longest
and loudest,” Mitcham said.
Goldwater then lamented that

“un-American policy” was dis
played in the college press and
demanded that Newton reorga
nize the Daily staff. The president
refused stating, “We have a genu
ine democracy on our campus.”
But Althen printed Mitcham’s
second piece in which he attacked
both President Kennedy and for
mer President Eisenhower. This
letter appeared six days before
Eisenhower was due to arrive in
Colorado and was widely inter
preted as an attempt by the lib
eral Daily to vilify him. Mitcham,
however, stated that he had not
known of the former president’s
visit.

SIX WAVS after the first ar
ticle appeared, a local newspaper
ran excerpts from the second
piece on the same page as the an
nouncement of Eisenhower’s ar
rival. Mitcham said that in this
article he was “quoted out of con
text” so that it appeared to be
solely an attack on Eisenhower.
At this point Altlien was called
from one of his classes to receive
a one-sentence note saying that
he had been fired.

Newton’s later attempts to have
the Board of Publications official
ly remove Althen and to have the
Department of Journalism take
over the administration of the
paper were defeated.
ALTHEN is due to appear be
fore the disciplinary committee
to morrow to explain his actions,
Mitcham reported. A student ref
erendum will be held today or to
morrow to vote upon his dismis
sal. Depending on the results of
the referendum, Althen may ap
peal Newton's action to the
Board of Regents which would
result in a detailed investigation.

Meanwhile Jon Kolowitz was
appointed interim editor, and in
protest the Managing. City, News,
and Wire Editors of The Daily re
signed.
Now facts in the controversy
over articles criticizing Senator
Barry Goldwater and former
President Eisenhower in the Uni
versity of Colorado Daily were
revealed yesterday in a telephone
interview with Gary Althen, ex
editor of the paper, and Carl
Mitcham, a former Stanford stu
dent and author of the articles.
