# Vatican Council Viewed As Important by Brown
## 
### SUE LINEMAN 
Professor Robert McAfee
Brown, in a talk yesterday after
noon on “A Protestant Looks at
the Vatican,’’ expressed the view
that the basic importance to the
non-Catholic world of the Second
Vatican Council being hold at
Rome this year is in its “indica
tion of the willingness of the Ro
man Catholic Church to engage
in reform.”
Although the reunion of the
Catholic and Protestant churches
is not “just around the corner,”
the council will be a major stop in
the understanding of the shift
now taking place in Protestant-
Catholic relations.
There are four main points
which the Protestants hope will
be acted upon at this council. The
most important is that the Vati
can will make a definitive state
ment on religious liberty and tol
eration. Brown also hopes for an
enlargement of the scope of the
doctrine of Papal infallibility, a
clarification of the position of the
laity, and a consideration of litur
gical reform.
