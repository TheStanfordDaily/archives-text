# Thurber Discusses Campaign Issues
## 
### KATHLEEN DOWNING 
James F. Thurber, Democratic candidate j
| for Congress from the 10th district, said yes- I
\ terday that he has had little response from !
incumbent Charles S. Gubser about Thur
ber’s campaign statements.
‘‘The only response I’ve had from Gubser I
is through an intermediary, charging that a j
j list of Gubser statements we have published j
is salacious literature,” said Thurber in an j
j interview off campus yesterday,
j Thurber, on leave from his post as As
sistant to the Dean of Graduate Studies at
| Stanford, explained that the pamphlet con
| demned by incumbent Gubser contains con
j tradictory statements made by Representa
j live Gubser in the last two years. The San
Jose “Mercury Nows” substantiated I he
truth of these statements before publishing
an open letter to Gubser, said Thurber.
MAYOR OF Los Altos and member of the
Peninsula Intercity Council, Thurber is a j
j Stanford alumnus, class of 1951. While at I
I Stanford, he served as “Daily” editor; ho has j
i been a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, j
I During the last few weeks. Thurber has per-
I sonally canvassed door to door in more than
1 50 precincts in the district. “In the next two
1 weeks, I plan to cover 30 to 35 more pre-
I cincts,” he said.
“Since the redistricting last year, this
I county has become an urban area with more
I than 225 thousand voters living in the area
] between Palo Alto and San Jose,” Thurber
i explained.
I “The rest of the total 420 thousand voters
| are centered in the Gilroy area, in which
1 Gubser has his office. Gubser has said he’s S

i proud of being a Conservative from a rural
| district.” Thurber added. The character of
| this area has changed, he explained. “Now
| we are a growing urban area and we need
representation suited to this character.”
Working with the Intercity Council, Thur
| her has attempted to prepare for the econom
i ic problems which multilateral disarmament
| will cause. “People are eager for disarma
■ merit, but fear economic repercussions,” ob
served Thurber. More than 50 per cent of
j the workers in this area are connected with
defense industries, he reported. “Disarma
! rnent will result in a high cutback. The Stan
ford Industrial Park is one of our efforts to
| draw now, peace-oriented industries to this
j area.” he added.
! “But the disarmament problem of the
j nation is much gi'eater than that of Santa
j Clara county,” Thurber amended. Compre
i hensive activities for the nation’s economic
growth, such as opening new markets under
the provisions of the trade bill, and breaking
down trade walls in South America and
j Africa, can be instigated, he explained.
“The only statement Gubser has made on
1 disarmament in this campaign,” Thurber re
j porter!, “is that his ‘membership on the
| House Armed Services Committee is vital to
this area’s economic security,”’
THURBER COMPLAINED that Gubser
j has never published his voting record during
| his terms in Washington. Thurber produced
i a dummy for the newsletter that he promises
to send to his constituents from Washing
ton; a list of his action on all bills and a
: record of his attendance at sessions would
1 be included.

| “Disproportions in federal aid to educa
tion are large,” said Thurber. The National
Education Defense Act is supposed to be
self-supporting, he explained, but universi
ties often must reduce funds in one field in
order to support other programs. “Total
support is necessary for all kinds of educa
tion,” Thurber emphasized, “not just for
technological development, but also for im
portant research being done in the social
sciences and humanities.”
"Gubser introduced a modified Townsend
Plan, eliminating the use of resources of
Social Security funds for hospital benefits to
the aged,” said Thurber. “Last week the
Senior Citizen group in this area, more than
5,000 members, switched their endorsement
from Gubser to myself.” “1 have found in
talking door to door in the precincts that,
people have a fear of going to the hospital
because of the enormous bills they will not
be able to meet.” Thurber feels that the
President’s Medicare bill, the rewritten King-
Anderson plan, will meet the need for in
creased funds now and will provide a future
bank of funds, under the Social Security
program.
THURBER SPOKE before a small maim
j factoring group yesterday afternoon, at
j which Gubser had spoken last Friday. Ques
tioned on his opponent’s voting record on
j the Trade bill, Thurber replied that Gubser
j had voted to remit the bill to committee, but
j five minutes later when the bill came on the
| floor again, Gubser apparently changed his
1 mind and voted for the bill. “The luncheon
| group was in an uproar,” reported Thurber,
j "because Gubser had flatly said last Friday
! that he voted for the Trade bill.”

I “The rest of the total 420 thousand voters

| we are a growing urban area and we need
representation suited to this character.”
Working with the Intercity Council, Thur

i ic problems which multilateral disarmament
| will cause. “People are eager for disarma
■ merit, but fear economic repercussions,” ob
served Thurber. More than 50 per cent of
j the workers in this area are connected with
defense industries, he reported. “Disarma
! rnent will result in a high cutback. The Stan
ford Industrial Park is one of our efforts to
| draw now, peace-oriented industries to this
j area.” he added.
! “But the disarmament problem of the
j nation is much gi'eater than that of Santa
j Clara county,” Thurber amended. Compre
i hensive activities for the nation’s economic
growth, such as opening new markets under
the provisions of the trade bill, and breaking
down trade walls in South America and
j Africa, can be instigated, he explained.
“The only statement Gubser has made on
1 disarmament in this campaign,” Thurber re
j porter!, “is that his ‘membership on the
| House Armed Services Committee is vital to
this area’s economic security,”’
THURBER COMPLAINED that Gubser
j has never published his voting record during
| his terms in Washington. Thurber produced
i a dummy for the newsletter that he promises
to send to his constituents from Washing
ton; a list of his action on all bills and a
: record of his attendance at sessions would
1 be included.

| “Disproportions in federal aid to educa
tion are large,” said Thurber. The National
Education Defense Act is supposed to be
self-supporting, he explained, but universi
ties often must reduce funds in one field in
order to support other programs. “Total
support is necessary for all kinds of educa
tion,” Thurber emphasized, “not just for
technological development, but also for im
portant research being done in the social
sciences and humanities.”
"Gubser introduced a modified Townsend
Plan, eliminating the use of resources of
Social Security funds for hospital benefits to
the aged,” said Thurber. “Last week the
Senior Citizen group in this area, more than
5,000 members, switched their endorsement
from Gubser to myself.” “1 have found in
talking door to door in the precincts that,
people have a fear of going to the hospital
because of the enormous bills they will not
be able to meet.” Thurber feels that the
President’s Medicare bill, the rewritten King-
Anderson plan, will meet the need for in
creased funds now and will provide a future
bank of funds, under the Social Security
program.

j nation is much gi'eater than that of Santa
j Clara county,” Thurber amended. Compre
i hensive activities for the nation’s economic
growth, such as opening new markets under
the provisions of the trade bill, and breaking
down trade walls in South America and
j Africa, can be instigated, he explained.
“The only statement Gubser has made on
1 disarmament in this campaign,” Thurber re
j porter!, “is that his ‘membership on the
| House Armed Services Committee is vital to
this area’s economic security,”’
THURBER COMPLAINED that Gubser
j has never published his voting record during
| his terms in Washington. Thurber produced
i a dummy for the newsletter that he promises
to send to his constituents from Washing
ton; a list of his action on all bills and a
: record of his attendance at sessions would
1 be included.

| “Disproportions in federal aid to educa
tion are large,” said Thurber. The National
Education Defense Act is supposed to be
self-supporting, he explained, but universi
ties often must reduce funds in one field in
order to support other programs. “Total
support is necessary for all kinds of educa
tion,” Thurber emphasized, “not just for
technological development, but also for im
portant research being done in the social
sciences and humanities.”
"Gubser introduced a modified Townsend
Plan, eliminating the use of resources of
Social Security funds for hospital benefits to
the aged,” said Thurber. “Last week the
Senior Citizen group in this area, more than
5,000 members, switched their endorsement
from Gubser to myself.” “1 have found in
talking door to door in the precincts that,
people have a fear of going to the hospital
because of the enormous bills they will not
be able to meet.” Thurber feels that the
President’s Medicare bill, the rewritten King-
Anderson plan, will meet the need for in
creased funds now and will provide a future
bank of funds, under the Social Security
program.
THURBER SPOKE before a small maim
j factoring group yesterday afternoon, at
j which Gubser had spoken last Friday. Ques
tioned on his opponent’s voting record on
j the Trade bill, Thurber replied that Gubser
j had voted to remit the bill to committee, but
j five minutes later when the bill came on the
| floor again, Gubser apparently changed his
1 mind and voted for the bill. “The luncheon
| group was in an uproar,” reported Thurber,
j "because Gubser had flatly said last Friday
! that he voted for the Trade bill.”
James F. Thurber, Democratic candidate j
| for Congress from the 10th district, said yes- I
\ terday that he has had little response from !
incumbent Charles S. Gubser about Thur
ber’s campaign statements.
‘‘The only response I’ve had from Gubser I
is through an intermediary, charging that a j
j list of Gubser statements we have published j
is salacious literature,” said Thurber in an j
j interview off campus yesterday,
j Thurber, on leave from his post as As
sistant to the Dean of Graduate Studies at
| Stanford, explained that the pamphlet con
| demned by incumbent Gubser contains con
j tradictory statements made by Representa
j live Gubser in the last two years. The San
Jose “Mercury Nows” substantiated I he
truth of these statements before publishing
an open letter to Gubser, said Thurber.
MAYOR OF Los Altos and member of the
Peninsula Intercity Council, Thurber is a j
j Stanford alumnus, class of 1951. While at I
I Stanford, he served as “Daily” editor; ho has j
i been a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, j
I During the last few weeks. Thurber has per-
I sonally canvassed door to door in more than
1 50 precincts in the district. “In the next two
1 weeks, I plan to cover 30 to 35 more pre-
I cincts,” he said.
“Since the redistricting last year, this
I county has become an urban area with more
I than 225 thousand voters living in the area
] between Palo Alto and San Jose,” Thurber
i explained.
I “The rest of the total 420 thousand voters
| are centered in the Gilroy area, in which
1 Gubser has his office. Gubser has said he’s S

i proud of being a Conservative from a rural
| district.” Thurber added. The character of
| this area has changed, he explained. “Now
| we are a growing urban area and we need
representation suited to this character.”
Working with the Intercity Council, Thur
| her has attempted to prepare for the econom
i ic problems which multilateral disarmament
| will cause. “People are eager for disarma
■ merit, but fear economic repercussions,” ob
served Thurber. More than 50 per cent of
j the workers in this area are connected with
defense industries, he reported. “Disarma
! rnent will result in a high cutback. The Stan
ford Industrial Park is one of our efforts to
