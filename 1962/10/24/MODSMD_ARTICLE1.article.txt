## New Constitution Faces Indifference, Ignorance 
### WILLIAM REPPY Associate Editor 
Tho typical Stanford undergraduate either doesn’t care about the
proposed new ASSU constitution or doesn’t know enough about it to
have any opinion, according to a poll conducted by The Daily
Monday.
Telephone calls to most of the undergraduate residences re
vealed widespread indifference and ignorance concerning the issue
of a formal change in student government at Stanford.
Few students expressed approval of the new constitution, while

several were strongly opposed,4
indicating that if the referendum
scheduled for mid-November
were to bo held today, the docu
ment would probably be rejected
by a convincing margin.
A COMMENT by Theta Delt
Robert Boston, representative to
Men’s Council, sums up student
indifference: “There’s really noth
ing in the new constitution,” he
said, “that has me jumping off
bridges.”
Most of the living-groups con
tacted reported little or no dis
cussion of the new constitution,
a remodeled version of the docu
ment rejected last April by a vote |
of 743 to 711. A two-thirds ma-1
jority is required for adoption.
Several students said they were
interested in the controversy but
needed to know a lot more about :
it before deciding how to vote.
Otero freshman Tom Hecht
said he believed the average Wil
bur man was “oblivious” to tho
issue of adopting a new constitu
tion. Before we can talk about it,
we have to become acquainted
with both the old and now consti
tutions, he said.
PAM NELSEN agreed, adding
that the women at Branner need
ed more information to be able to
discuss intelligently the new con
stitution. “But everyone seems
interested," she said.
A gill in Alondra reported: “I
haven’t heard anyone discussing
it.”
A Guthrie gill concurred: “Not
very many of us have been talk
ing about the constitution.”
Freshman Chris Vaughn said
her dorm-mates at Roble know
very little about the constitution
and therefore haven’t been talk
ing about it.
THE DAILY contacted 19 fra
ternities. At 12 there had been no
discussion of the issue, and tho
prevalent attitude w'as one of in
difference.
The proposed constitution is
“not a burning issue” at Stillman,
according to Sue Haley. The girls
have shown only moderate inter
est, but are "quite divided” in
their views, she said.
At Roth, one undergrad report
ed that her house-mates had dis
cussed tho new constitution at
length and generally opposed it.
She said they objected to giving
the president power to appoint
committee heads and to increas
ing the membership of Legisla
ture from 30 to 120.
CHI I*SI also opposes the con
stitution, according to president
Fred Richards. He said he and his
fraternity brothers felt it would
give the ASSU president “too
much power” by permitting him
to appoint all ASSU committee
chairmen and committee mem
bers.
“The constitution says he can
use this power only when by
laws do not specify other means
for filling committee posts,”
Richards explained. “But LASSU
can change by-laws without stu
dent approval in a referendum. If
students were to approve this con
stitution, they would give to
LASSU the right to grant dicta
torial powers to the president.”
Sigma Nu and Delta Chi were
the only two living groups that
reported to be in favor of the
document.
CHARLES LOFGREN, repro
sentative to LASSU for graduate
students in Humanities and Sci
ences, sairl he was “favorably im
pressed with the proposed consti
tution.”
“I especially approve of remov
ing the president from the Legis
lature and giving him the veto
power." Lofgren said.
“The system for proportional
representation will give gradu
ate students some say in affairs,
and it is not weighted too heavily
in favor either of grads or under
grads,” ho added. (The proposed
constitution would create 40 seats

in LASSU for graduate represen
tatives.)
HOWEVER, Lofgren does not
believe a new constitution alone
can significantly improve student
government at Stanford. “This
depends on student interest,” he
said, “which will not he greatly
affected by a formal change, even
though increased representation
will draw more students into cam
pus government.”
Boston said ho approved of the
new constitution’s system of ap
pointing members of judicial
councils. They are now elected.
“Most voters haven’t the time to
become acquainted with all the
candidates,” he said. “Appoint
ment of qualified people is a good
idea.”

A COMMENT by Theta Delt
Robert Boston, representative to
Men’s Council, sums up student
indifference: “There’s really noth
ing in the new constitution,” he
said, “that has me jumping off
bridges.”
Most of the living-groups con
tacted reported little or no dis
cussion of the new constitution,
a remodeled version of the docu
ment rejected last April by a vote |
of 743 to 711. A two-thirds ma-1
jority is required for adoption.
Several students said they were
interested in the controversy but
needed to know a lot more about :
it before deciding how to vote.
Otero freshman Tom Hecht
said he believed the average Wil
bur man was “oblivious” to tho
issue of adopting a new constitu
tion. Before we can talk about it,
we have to become acquainted
with both the old and now consti
tutions, he said.
PAM NELSEN agreed, adding
that the women at Branner need
ed more information to be able to
discuss intelligently the new con
stitution. “But everyone seems
interested," she said.
A gill in Alondra reported: “I
haven’t heard anyone discussing
it.”
A Guthrie gill concurred: “Not
very many of us have been talk
ing about the constitution.”
Freshman Chris Vaughn said
her dorm-mates at Roble know
very little about the constitution
and therefore haven’t been talk
ing about it.
THE DAILY contacted 19 fra
ternities. At 12 there had been no
discussion of the issue, and tho
prevalent attitude w'as one of in
difference.
The proposed constitution is
“not a burning issue” at Stillman,
according to Sue Haley. The girls
have shown only moderate inter
est, but are "quite divided” in
their views, she said.
At Roth, one undergrad report
ed that her house-mates had dis
cussed tho new constitution at
length and generally opposed it.
She said they objected to giving
the president power to appoint
committee heads and to increas
ing the membership of Legisla
ture from 30 to 120.
CHI I*SI also opposes the con
stitution, according to president
Fred Richards. He said he and his
fraternity brothers felt it would
give the ASSU president “too
much power” by permitting him
to appoint all ASSU committee
chairmen and committee mem
bers.
“The constitution says he can
use this power only when by
laws do not specify other means
for filling committee posts,”
Richards explained. “But LASSU
can change by-laws without stu
dent approval in a referendum. If
students were to approve this con
stitution, they would give to
LASSU the right to grant dicta
torial powers to the president.”
Sigma Nu and Delta Chi were
the only two living groups that
reported to be in favor of the
document.
CHARLES LOFGREN, repro
sentative to LASSU for graduate
students in Humanities and Sci
ences, sairl he was “favorably im
pressed with the proposed consti
tution.”
“I especially approve of remov
ing the president from the Legis
lature and giving him the veto
power." Lofgren said.
“The system for proportional
representation will give gradu
ate students some say in affairs,
and it is not weighted too heavily
in favor either of grads or under
grads,” ho added. (The proposed

Sigma Nu and Delta Chi were
the only two living groups that
reported to be in favor of the
document.
CHARLES LOFGREN, repro
sentative to LASSU for graduate
students in Humanities and Sci
ences, sairl he was “favorably im
pressed with the proposed consti
tution.”
“I especially approve of remov
ing the president from the Legis
lature and giving him the veto
power." Lofgren said.
“The system for proportional
representation will give gradu
ate students some say in affairs,
and it is not weighted too heavily
in favor either of grads or under
grads,” ho added. (The proposed
constitution would create 40 seats

in LASSU for graduate represen
tatives.)
HOWEVER, Lofgren does not
believe a new constitution alone
can significantly improve student
government at Stanford. “This
depends on student interest,” he
said, “which will not he greatly
affected by a formal change, even
though increased representation
will draw more students into cam
pus government.”
Boston said ho approved of the
new constitution’s system of ap
pointing members of judicial
councils. They are now elected.
“Most voters haven’t the time to
become acquainted with all the
candidates,” he said. “Appoint
ment of qualified people is a good
idea.”
Tho typical Stanford undergraduate either doesn’t care about the
proposed new ASSU constitution or doesn’t know enough about it to
have any opinion, according to a poll conducted by The Daily
Monday.
Telephone calls to most of the undergraduate residences re
vealed widespread indifference and ignorance concerning the issue
of a formal change in student government at Stanford.
Few students expressed approval of the new constitution, while

several were strongly opposed,4
indicating that if the referendum
scheduled for mid-November
were to bo held today, the docu
ment would probably be rejected
by a convincing margin.
A COMMENT by Theta Delt
Robert Boston, representative to
Men’s Council, sums up student
indifference: “There’s really noth
ing in the new constitution,” he
said, “that has me jumping off
bridges.”
Most of the living-groups con
tacted reported little or no dis
cussion of the new constitution,
a remodeled version of the docu
ment rejected last April by a vote |
of 743 to 711. A two-thirds ma-1
jority is required for adoption.
Several students said they were
interested in the controversy but
needed to know a lot more about :
it before deciding how to vote.
Otero freshman Tom Hecht
said he believed the average Wil
bur man was “oblivious” to tho
issue of adopting a new constitu
tion. Before we can talk about it,
we have to become acquainted
with both the old and now consti
tutions, he said.
PAM NELSEN agreed, adding
that the women at Branner need
ed more information to be able to
discuss intelligently the new con
stitution. “But everyone seems
interested," she said.
A gill in Alondra reported: “I
haven’t heard anyone discussing
it.”
A Guthrie gill concurred: “Not
very many of us have been talk
ing about the constitution.”
Freshman Chris Vaughn said
her dorm-mates at Roble know
very little about the constitution
and therefore haven’t been talk
ing about it.
THE DAILY contacted 19 fra
ternities. At 12 there had been no
discussion of the issue, and tho
prevalent attitude w'as one of in
difference.
The proposed constitution is
“not a burning issue” at Stillman,
according to Sue Haley. The girls
have shown only moderate inter
est, but are "quite divided” in
their views, she said.
At Roth, one undergrad report
ed that her house-mates had dis
cussed tho new constitution at
length and generally opposed it.
She said they objected to giving
the president power to appoint
committee heads and to increas
ing the membership of Legisla
ture from 30 to 120.
CHI I*SI also opposes the con
stitution, according to president
Fred Richards. He said he and his
fraternity brothers felt it would
give the ASSU president “too
much power” by permitting him
to appoint all ASSU committee
chairmen and committee mem
bers.
“The constitution says he can
use this power only when by
laws do not specify other means
for filling committee posts,”
Richards explained. “But LASSU
can change by-laws without stu
dent approval in a referendum. If
students were to approve this con
stitution, they would give to
LASSU the right to grant dicta
torial powers to the president.”
