# Cuban Crisis
## 
### 
In tho next few days and possibly months the peace of the
world will hang in the balance as the United States and Soviet
Union test each other’s will. If ships from the Soviet bloc refuse
to be searched, then they will be sunk unless the United States
backs down. The sinking of a Soviet bloc ship can have only the
most dire consequences. Possibly, the Soviets would merely pro
test the action. Possibly, tbey would send convoys with their ships
at a later date. Such a convoy would make probable a limited war
between the United States and the Soviet Union. Possibly, there
would be a thermonuclear holocaust resulting from a U.S.-U.S.S.R.
Caribbean battle or from Soviet counteraction in Berlin. The pos
sibilities are as dangerous as they are numerous.
Despite the danger, a blockade was the least step which the
President could have taken in light of the' build-up of offensive
missiles in Cuba. It is imperative that no further build-up ensue.
The fact that the Soviet Union has shipped missiles to Cuba is an
indication that missiles located in Cuba have a military value
that complements missiles based in the Soviet Union. If there is
no special advantage for the Soviet Union in having missiles in
Cuba, there would be no IHBM’s on the island today. Conceivably,
their value is two-fold: to aid in an attack on the United States
launched from the Soviet Union, or to prevent an American in
vasion of Cuba by threatening the destruction of a select number
of American cities. Ihe former is a threat to national security be
cause the southern coast of the United States is far more vulner
able to bombers and missiles than the northern boundary. The
latter is a threat because Castro could blackmail the United States
if this country sought to prevent export of Castroist revolution by
invading Cuba. If American intelligence findings indicate that
Cuba is not now able to deliver nuclear warheads to the United
States, an invasion might save more lives than would be lost a
year from now' when all the missiles already in Cuba will be in
stalled. If Castro is able to fire missiles today with nuclear war
heads on them, then an invasion is already an out-dated action.
But Cuba may not already have installed nuclear warheads on
their missiles. Indeed, the missiles, themselves, may not yet be
installed; the President referred to the preparation of missile sites
not the installation of missiles. From all the speculation about the
Cuban threat, it is apparent that a more precise definition of
Cuban nuclear capabilities is needed. Until the threat is more
exactly defined, laymen can only formulate opinions based on
'nnumerable it's and buts.
The concept of national security is difficult to define, and it is
still more difficult to assess the potential efficacy of a policy pro
moted in the interest of national security. But, if we may assume
from President Kennedy’s speech that sites are in preparation,
missiles are in Cuba but not installed and not installed with
nuclear warheads, then invasion is better policy than blockade.
