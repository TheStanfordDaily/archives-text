# 'Quarantine': Euphemistic Way To Establish Cuban Blockade
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD— State
Department lawyers said yester
day there is about as much dif
ference between the words block
ade and quax-antine as there is
between guts and intestinal forti
tude.
The practical meaning of both
is the same but one sounds nicer.
PRESIDENT Kennedy avoided
the use of blockade in his an
nouncement Monday night of the
U.S. action against Cuba. He con
sistently referred to it as a quar
antine.
Other administration officials
said a quarantine is an “act of
force,” but not an “act of war.”
In international law books block
ade usually is associated with
war and, unless justified by such
circumstances as self-defense, is
considered an act of war.
In either case, diplomatic law
yers said, there is no difference
in the authority of U.S. ships to
use force to halt and search ships
bound for Cuba.
THE MEANINGS are so close
that even the international legal
experts frequently slip and refer
to the current U.S. action as a
blockade.

However, they never fail to
note that it is a "selective” block

ade aimed only at halting ship
ments of offensive weapons.
At first glance, the U.S. action
would appear to contradict the
historic American contention that
any “belligerent” blockade is an
act of war-. But the contention of
the Stale Department lawyers is
that authorizations in the U.N.
Charter and Rio treaty remove
this action from that category.
IN THE LAW books a belliger
ent blockade means one which
uses force to prevent the entry of
ships into the harbors of the tar
get nation.
A “pacific” blockade differs in
that shipping nations merely are
asked to halt traffic with the tar
get nation.
The most recent U.S. use of a
blockade occurred in 1954, when
this country acted swiftly to cut
off arms shipments to the pro-
Communist regime then in sway
in Guatemala.

ALTHOUGH no formal block
ade was declared, the U.S. govern
ment said it would consider weap
ons shipments to the country as
a threat to hemispheric security.
Later U.S. authorities removed
arms from a French freighter,
searched a Dutch freighter and
stopped a shipment of ammuni
tion in a West German port.

A “pacific” blockade differs in
that shipping nations merely are
asked to halt traffic with the tar
get nation.
The most recent U.S. use of a
blockade occurred in 1954, when
this country acted swiftly to cut
off arms shipments to the pro-
Communist regime then in sway
in Guatemala.

ALTHOUGH no formal block
ade was declared, the U.S. govern
ment said it would consider weap
ons shipments to the country as
a threat to hemispheric security.
Later U.S. authorities removed
arms from a French freighter,
searched a Dutch freighter and
stopped a shipment of ammuni
tion in a West German port.
WASHINGTON (UPD— State
Department lawyers said yester
day there is about as much dif
ference between the words block
ade and quax-antine as there is
between guts and intestinal forti
tude.
The practical meaning of both
is the same but one sounds nicer.
PRESIDENT Kennedy avoided
the use of blockade in his an
nouncement Monday night of the
U.S. action against Cuba. He con
sistently referred to it as a quar
antine.
Other administration officials
said a quarantine is an “act of
force,” but not an “act of war.”
In international law books block
ade usually is associated with
war and, unless justified by such
circumstances as self-defense, is
considered an act of war.
In either case, diplomatic law
yers said, there is no difference
in the authority of U.S. ships to
use force to halt and search ships
bound for Cuba.
THE MEANINGS are so close
that even the international legal
experts frequently slip and refer
to the current U.S. action as a
blockade.

However, they never fail to
note that it is a "selective” block

ade aimed only at halting ship
ments of offensive weapons.
At first glance, the U.S. action
would appear to contradict the
historic American contention that
any “belligerent” blockade is an
act of war-. But the contention of
the Stale Department lawyers is
that authorizations in the U.N.
Charter and Rio treaty remove
this action from that category.
IN THE LAW books a belliger
ent blockade means one which
uses force to prevent the entry of
ships into the harbors of the tar
get nation.
