## Loss of U.S. Nuclear Monopoly Central Reality of U.S. Policy 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
This article is written before any official statement about the
latest developments in Cuba. But it is written in the knowledge that
the situation has very suddenly become acute and critical. Whatever
the President decides to do, It is unfortunate that it has to be done
at the height of an election campaign, and particularly of this one

For this campaign has been sin--
gularly sterile as a preparation
of the American electorate to un
derstand the grave problems in
which they are profoundly in
volved. That ought not to bo the
case. We ought to be an educated
and informed democracy.
The voters are being talked to
by the President and the ex-Presi
dent, by the two leaders who for
the ten years since the Korean
war have had the highest respon
sibility and who have had access
to the most intimate knowledge
of the facts. Yet neither of them,
I submit, has ever tried to explain
to the people the dimensions of
the Cuban problem and of the
Berlin problem.
The education of the people,
which must be the foundation of
policy, has been left to politicians
outside the Administration and to
editors, reporters, and commen
tators, all of us unauthorized and
only partially and intermittently
informed. The two national lead
ers have refrained from candid
and free exposition of the issues
and they have, in fact, talked
down to the voters as if truth
were too strong a meat for
Americans to digest.

the sense that we could destroy
without being hurt. Then it was
possible to encircle the Soviet
Union with military bases usable
for offensive action. But when the
nuclear monopoly came to an end,
then the encircling nations like
Turkey, and then Paris and Lon
don and Bonn, and finally the
United States itself, became vul
nerable. Then the advance bases
began to become liabilities.
Thus Turkey is a great liability
in our relations with Cuba. For
if we use force to invade or
blockade Cuba, we must be pre
pared for something similar
around or in Turkey or some such
place on the frontiers of the Sovi
et Union. These advance bases of
ours, which are nearly obsoles
cent with the big bombers and
the missiles, are more hostage
than ally. If Mr. Khrushchev
wants to defend Castro, he does
not have to do it in Cuba where
the Soviet Union is a negligible
military power. Ho can do it in
Turkey or Iran or elsewhere on
the perimeter.
These things need to be under
stood by our people as we find
ourselves in a military crisis over
Cuba. Until our people do under
stand them, they will be thinking
and feeling and voting in a world
that no longer exists. In the
world that now exists the United
States is not omnipotent. It can
not, therefore, enforce the Mon
roe Doctrine in the Western
hemisphere and the Truman Doc
trine in the Eastern hemisphere.

Neither Gen.
Eisenhower nor
President Ken
nedy has come
near to dealing
with the central
reality which
has dominated
their two Admin
istrations. This
reality is the de
cisive change in

the military and financial position
of the United States since the
middle of the 1950’5.
It was under President Eisen
hower through no fault of his
own—that the United States’ nu
clear monopoly came to an end.
This development is reshaping
the whole complex of power poli
tics throughout the world. It was
under President Eisenhower—
again through no fault of his own
—that the United States ceased
to be an inexhaustible creditor
country and became increasingly
unable, therefore, to call the tune
and pay the piper.
Moreover, it was under Gen.
Eisenhower—in the main because
of his personal convictions about
economic theory—that the Ameri
cap economy was throttled down
to a rate of expansion which is
just about the lowest in the capi
talist world.
THESE THREE developments
are having enormous conse
quences. But Gen. Eisenhower
does not mention them in his
speeches, and he talks as if noth
ing that we need be concerned
about had happened while he was
in the White House.
Except for veiled phrases to
informed insiders, President Ken
nedy—presumably in order to
avoid a debate with Gen. Eisen
hower barely mentions, and
never dwells upon, the realities
of the changed world Which he
came upon in 1961. Mr. Kennedy
has talked a little about economic
growth. He has been much pre
occupied with the position of the
dollar. He has rightly and effec
tively built up our military power.
But he has never fully explain
ed to the people how the loss of
our nuclear monopoly, even
though we are still much the
stronger military power, is af
fecting the whole worldwide com
mitments which were proclaimed
by President Truman and for
malized by Secretary Dulles.
FOR EXAMPLE. When we still
possessed a nuclear monopoly,
we were an irresistable power in
