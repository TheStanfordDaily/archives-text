## 'ean Ritchie Next Step Beyond Baez' 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
The rapid rise and fall of the
Kingston Trio and the commer
cialization of Harry Belafonte
have turned many people away
from popular folk music toward
the more enduring native sources
of American song the Southern
white mountain balladeers. Na
tional gatherings like the Berke
ley, Chicago, and Newport Folk
Festivals, us well as a burgeoning
crop of local festivals have en
abled ever growing crowds to find
a new beauty in untrained voices
and homemade instruments.
The brightest star of this eth
nic revival is a blond dulcimer
player from Viper, Kentucky
named Jean Ritchie. Certain mu
sicologists have wryly referred to
Miss Ritchie as “the next step
beyond Joan Baez.” And there is
an unmistakable affinity between
the two: one could easily picture
Jean Ritchie as Joan Baez with
out guitar and vibrato. Joan
Baez’s moving rendition of “East
Virginia” (on Vanguard’s “Joan
Baez,” VRS 9078) is reputed to
derive from Jean Ritchie’s even
more enigmatic “Old Virginny”
(“The Best of Jean Ritchie.” Pres
tige International 13003); and in
timations of Jean Ritchie’s style
can be sensed throughout the
three Baez, albums on Vanguard.
Miss Ritchie has an unfamiliar
sweetness which is quite outside
Miss Baez’s range of talent.
JEAN RITCHIE is no hillbilly,
graduating Phi Beta Kappa from
the University of Kentucky, she
was invited to New York City to
teach mountain songs and play
party games to the slum children
at a settlement house summer
camp. Singing at small parties for
adults in her spare time, she soon
gained wide popularity as a con
cert artist. As she began to sense
her unique cultural heritage, she
began collecting neighbors’ songs
and delving into her family’s long
singing history on her frequent
returns to the mountains.
A Fulbright grant enabled Miss
Ritchie to spend a year collecting
folk material in rural areas of
the British Isles. She made hun
dreds of field recordings, while
her husband, noted magazine
photographer George Pickow,
made a fine pictorial record of
the whole tour.
The Ritchie Family is nearly a
folk singing dynasty. The Ritchies
left England several decades be
fore the American Revolution to
settle in Virginia. From there
they migrated to the Kentucky
Mountains, where they have lived
for the past 130 years. The re
nowned British folklorist Cecil
Sharp, collecting in the Southern
Appalachians in 1917, found mem
bers of Jean’s family to be among
his most important informants.
MISS RITCHIE has recorded
her life as youngest of the four
teen Ritchie children in "Singing
Family of the Cumberlands” (Ox
ford, 1955); portions of the book
have been recorded interspersed
with family songs by Riverside
Folk Series (RLP 12-633). Jean’s
prose style is clean and direct, yet
preserves the unexpected nuances
of mountain speech (“Marthie
was as white as a pure sheet”)—
a speech preserved almost un
changed from the rural dialect
spoken in Elizabethan England.
The whole family sings on “The
Ritchie Family of Kentucky”
(Folkways Records FA 2316).
The album ranges from the hyp
notic rhythms of Calvinistic play
party songs that took the place of
prohibited dancing, to the almost
monastic plain-chant of all the
Ritchies singing Baptist hymns
cast in the old Church modal mel
odies. On perhaps the most ap
pealing band, Miss Ritchie’s little
son Peter sings, amid gasps, hesi
tations, and his own rough-and
ready variations, one of the many
mountain songs which Miss
Ritchie is gradually transmitting
to him as his Ritchie heritage.
One of Jean Ritchie’s most rep
resentative albums is "British
Traditional Ballads in the South
ern Mountains” (Folkways FA
2302). The album utilizes both her
own heritage and her acquired
sense of balladry developed in the
British Isles. She prefers (he free
dom of a cappella singing: only
one number on each side is ac
companied, in each case by the
exotic twang and drone of the
mountain dulcimer. Most of the
songs are ballads with a quite in
volved diffused narrative struc
ture; they are not dramatically
compact and must be heard with
text in hand for Miss Ritchie’s
subtle presentation to fully be
appreciated.
BUT UNEIKE Joan Baez, whose
overpowering lyricism often cloys
with time, Jean Ritchie has the
accumulative effect of an enig
matic and fascinating acquaint
ance whose personality can never
be fully pigeonholed. Jean can be
as fresh on the hundredth meet
ing as the Mona Lisa.

ever, they must be allowed to
play, then let them be restricted
to something like 7 to 8 Sunday
