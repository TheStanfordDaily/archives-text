Editor, The Daily:
In his speech the President in
dicated that Cuba had acquired
medium range ballistic missiles
(1000-mile range) and was now
obtaining missiles with a 1500-
2500-mile range; he also stated
that Cuba possessed jet bombers
with nuclear capability. This un
doubtedly shocked quite a lew
persons, including myself, but the
most shocking statement was
that he had learned of this only
within the last few days. It is a
generally accepted fact that mis
sile bases cannot be constructed
within a period of weeks or even
months; the planning, engineer
ing. transport of construction ma
terials, and actual construction
can easily consume a year or
more. Various private parties, in
cluding a number here at Stan
ford, have in past weeks charged
that such bases indeed existed;
several Congressmen as long as
a year ago warned of the missile
danger. These persons, however,
were ignored and even ridiculed
on the premise that the State
Dept, had stated Cuba only pos
sessed defensive weapons and the
State Dept, obviously was more
competent.
I have no intention of launch
ing an impassioned attack on the
Administration for not having in
vaded Cuba a year ago, or de
clared a blockade, since 1 do not
believe myself competent, as a
private citizen, to weigh the is
sues which faced the President. I
think, however, that something
smells when the President re
mains blissfully ignorant of what
is happening in Cuba while Con
gressmen and even private citi
zens know the score. Either the
entire intelligence system of the
U.S. is completely ineffectual, or
else the President intentionally
suppressed the facts and avoided
taking action until the eleventh
hour. If the former is the case,
the CIA, the military intelligence
agencies, and the State Depart
ment are overdue for a sweeping
overhaul; if the latter, the Presi
dent has been guilty of negligence
approaching the criminal.

Editor, The Daily:
Recently African Premiers Se
kou Toure and Ben Bella have
been received in this country with
great cordiality and respect.
The question I wish to pose,
therefore, is how is it that our
relations with such nationalist
and revolutionary leaders as
Toure and Bella can be carried
out with such intelligent diplo
macy and tolerant understanding,
while, at the same time, our re
lations with the nationalist and
revolutionary government of
Cuba are marked by aggressive
hostility and extreme impatience?
After all, if we compare the
words and deeds, the goals and
programs, of African socialism
with the Cuban variety, there
seems to be a high level of ideo
logical affinity. Both Toure and
Bella, and Nkrumah and Nasser
as well, are revolutionary social
ists. All have set out in a no less
deliberate manner toward build
ing a socialist state than has Cas
tro. Interestingly, in doing so the
Castro government has been char
acterized by a more democratic
and tolerant attitude toward its
opposition, a higher degree of
popular support, and a lack of
corruption so characteristic of the
African governments. All these
new governments are also anti-
American, though Ihc Cubans
more vociferously so because
they have been unduly provoked.

If these revolutionaries have so
much in common, where then lies
the key to our difference in atti
tudes toward Africa on the one
hand and Cuba on the other? One
obvious difference is that Premier
Castro has allied himself with the
Soviets in the Cold War. But one
must clearly agree that the only
course we left the Cubans was a
defensive alignment with the So
viet Union. With the advent of the
radical regimes in Africa we did
not respond with trade boycotts,
embargoes, severance of diplo
matic relations, and military sup
port for counter-revolution. If we
had they too would now be “com
munist.” The only real difference
seems to be that the Cubans had
the misfortune of having to throw
out the Americans rather than
the British or French.

Our very policy, certainly not a
communist conspiracy, has cre
ated a Marxist-Leninist Cuba. We
now have to learn to live with it.
I suggest that the only way to
solve the Cuban problem is to
drop completely the hypocritical,
insane, and immoral notions of
invading a country because it
chooses to defend itself against
a very real milhary threat, to ac
cept the Cuban’s standing offer of
negotiation of differences, and to
reestablish normal diplomatic and
trade relationships.

In his speech the President in
dicated that Cuba had acquired
medium range ballistic missiles
(1000-mile range) and was now
obtaining missiles with a 1500-
2500-mile range; he also stated
that Cuba possessed jet bombers
with nuclear capability. This un
doubtedly shocked quite a lew
persons, including myself, but the
most shocking statement was
that he had learned of this only
within the last few days. It is a
generally accepted fact that mis
sile bases cannot be constructed
within a period of weeks or even
months; the planning, engineer
ing. transport of construction ma
terials, and actual construction
can easily consume a year or
more. Various private parties, in
cluding a number here at Stan
ford, have in past weeks charged
that such bases indeed existed;
several Congressmen as long as
a year ago warned of the missile
danger. These persons, however,
were ignored and even ridiculed
on the premise that the State
Dept, had stated Cuba only pos
sessed defensive weapons and the
State Dept, obviously was more
competent.
I have no intention of launch
ing an impassioned attack on the
Administration for not having in
vaded Cuba a year ago, or de
clared a blockade, since 1 do not
believe myself competent, as a
private citizen, to weigh the is
sues which faced the President. I
think, however, that something
smells when the President re
mains blissfully ignorant of what
is happening in Cuba while Con
gressmen and even private citi
zens know the score. Either the
entire intelligence system of the
U.S. is completely ineffectual, or
else the President intentionally
suppressed the facts and avoided
taking action until the eleventh
hour. If the former is the case,
the CIA, the military intelligence
agencies, and the State Depart
ment are overdue for a sweeping
overhaul; if the latter, the Presi
dent has been guilty of negligence
approaching the criminal.

Recently African Premiers Se
kou Toure and Ben Bella have
been received in this country with
great cordiality and respect.
The question I wish to pose,
therefore, is how is it that our
relations with such nationalist
and revolutionary leaders as
Toure and Bella can be carried
out with such intelligent diplo
macy and tolerant understanding,
while, at the same time, our re
lations with the nationalist and
revolutionary government of
Cuba are marked by aggressive
hostility and extreme impatience?
After all, if we compare the
words and deeds, the goals and
programs, of African socialism
with the Cuban variety, there
seems to be a high level of ideo
logical affinity. Both Toure and
Bella, and Nkrumah and Nasser
as well, are revolutionary social
ists. All have set out in a no less
deliberate manner toward build
ing a socialist state than has Cas
tro. Interestingly, in doing so the
Castro government has been char
acterized by a more democratic
and tolerant attitude toward its
opposition, a higher degree of
popular support, and a lack of
corruption so characteristic of the
African governments. All these
new governments are also anti-
American, though Ihc Cubans
more vociferously so because
they have been unduly provoked.

If these revolutionaries have so
much in common, where then lies
the key to our difference in atti
tudes toward Africa on the one
hand and Cuba on the other? One
obvious difference is that Premier
Castro has allied himself with the
Soviets in the Cold War. But one
must clearly agree that the only
course we left the Cubans was a
defensive alignment with the So
viet Union. With the advent of the
radical regimes in Africa we did
not respond with trade boycotts,
embargoes, severance of diplo
matic relations, and military sup
port for counter-revolution. If we
had they too would now be “com
munist.” The only real difference
seems to be that the Cubans had
the misfortune of having to throw
out the Americans rather than
the British or French.

Our very policy, certainly not a
communist conspiracy, has cre
ated a Marxist-Leninist Cuba. We
now have to learn to live with it.
I suggest that the only way to
solve the Cuban problem is to
drop completely the hypocritical,
insane, and immoral notions of
invading a country because it
chooses to defend itself against
a very real milhary threat, to ac
cept the Cuban’s standing offer of
negotiation of differences, and to
reestablish normal diplomatic and
trade relationships.

In his speech the President in
dicated that Cuba had acquired
medium range ballistic missiles
(1000-mile range) and was now
obtaining missiles with a 1500-
2500-mile range; he also stated
that Cuba possessed jet bombers
with nuclear capability. This un
doubtedly shocked quite a lew
persons, including myself, but the
most shocking statement was
that he had learned of this only
within the last few days. It is a
generally accepted fact that mis
sile bases cannot be constructed
within a period of weeks or even
months; the planning, engineer
ing. transport of construction ma
terials, and actual construction
can easily consume a year or
more. Various private parties, in
cluding a number here at Stan
ford, have in past weeks charged
that such bases indeed existed;
several Congressmen as long as
a year ago warned of the missile
danger. These persons, however,
were ignored and even ridiculed
on the premise that the State
Dept, had stated Cuba only pos
sessed defensive weapons and the
State Dept, obviously was more
competent.
I have no intention of launch
ing an impassioned attack on the
Administration for not having in
vaded Cuba a year ago, or de
clared a blockade, since 1 do not
believe myself competent, as a
private citizen, to weigh the is
sues which faced the President. I
think, however, that something
smells when the President re
mains blissfully ignorant of what
is happening in Cuba while Con
gressmen and even private citi
zens know the score. Either the
entire intelligence system of the
U.S. is completely ineffectual, or
else the President intentionally
suppressed the facts and avoided
taking action until the eleventh
hour. If the former is the case,
the CIA, the military intelligence
agencies, and the State Depart
ment are overdue for a sweeping
overhaul; if the latter, the Presi
dent has been guilty of negligence
approaching the criminal.

Recently African Premiers Se
kou Toure and Ben Bella have
been received in this country with
great cordiality and respect.
The question I wish to pose,
therefore, is how is it that our
relations with such nationalist
and revolutionary leaders as
Toure and Bella can be carried
out with such intelligent diplo
macy and tolerant understanding,
while, at the same time, our re
lations with the nationalist and
revolutionary government of
Cuba are marked by aggressive
hostility and extreme impatience?
After all, if we compare the
words and deeds, the goals and
programs, of African socialism
with the Cuban variety, there
seems to be a high level of ideo
logical affinity. Both Toure and
Bella, and Nkrumah and Nasser
as well, are revolutionary social
ists. All have set out in a no less
deliberate manner toward build
ing a socialist state than has Cas
tro. Interestingly, in doing so the
Castro government has been char
acterized by a more democratic
and tolerant attitude toward its
opposition, a higher degree of
popular support, and a lack of
corruption so characteristic of the
African governments. All these
new governments are also anti-
American, though Ihc Cubans
more vociferously so because
they have been unduly provoked.

If these revolutionaries have so
much in common, where then lies
the key to our difference in atti
tudes toward Africa on the one
hand and Cuba on the other? One
obvious difference is that Premier
Castro has allied himself with the
Soviets in the Cold War. But one
must clearly agree that the only
course we left the Cubans was a
defensive alignment with the So
viet Union. With the advent of the
radical regimes in Africa we did
not respond with trade boycotts,
embargoes, severance of diplo
matic relations, and military sup
port for counter-revolution. If we
had they too would now be “com
munist.” The only real difference
seems to be that the Cubans had
the misfortune of having to throw
out the Americans rather than
the British or French.

Our very policy, certainly not a
communist conspiracy, has cre
ated a Marxist-Leninist Cuba. We
now have to learn to live with it.
I suggest that the only way to
solve the Cuban problem is to
drop completely the hypocritical,
insane, and immoral notions of
invading a country because it
chooses to defend itself against
a very real milhary threat, to ac
cept the Cuban’s standing offer of
negotiation of differences, and to
reestablish normal diplomatic and
trade relationships.
