## A 						Tale of Two Riots: A Parable on Protests 
### RICHARD WEINIG CHARLES LOFGREN 
Once upon a time, the government of the United States, with
the consent of the Supreme Court of that land, did send to a Groat
City by a Great Bay, a congressional investigatory committee. This,
so that the Government might gain the knowledge necessary for
rigorous enforcement of that which the Supremo Court had desig-

>s, with
a Great

nated as the supreme law of the-<
land.
In that country, there dwelt
students, watched over, by their
professors by day. And the stu
dents, having received great en
lightenment, believed with all
their hearts, and all their minds,
and all their souls, that the ac
tions of the Government, though
approved by the Supreme Court,
were immoral, unconstitutional,
and did intolerably infringe upon
the liberty of the people.
Lo, the students resolved to
abandon their lethargic frolick
ing: to no longer limit their con
cerns to mere drinking, dating,
and the debaucherous pursuit of
happiness. Having girded on the
armor of righteousness, they re
solved to express their indigna
tion at the Government's excres
cences in the most spectacular
way possible.
VERILY, THEY rose up in
haste and did trek lo the Great
City by the Great Bay; and did
sit. stand, and lie in the hallways,
doorways, and stairways of the
City Hall. They did, moreover,
raise their voices in protest, yea,
to such pitch and intensity that
the court in session two stories
above them was forced to recess
until such time as the words of
the learned judge could once
again be heard in the courtroom.
In time, the police of the Great
City attempted to quiet, then dis
perse, the students, and wide
spread rioting did there ensue.
Students were injured, arrested,
and even cast into dungeons.
And, 10, the student newspaper
of a Great Private University
near the Groat City and 88 mem
bers of the faculty of the Great
University did immediately raise
the hue and cry in affirmation of
the students’ right to demon
strate, yea, to riot, if their actions
were prompted by conscience.
QUOTH an epistle which those
faculty members did send forth
to the Mayor of the Great City;
“The demonstration was for the
most part a responsible protest
by mature college students
against what they deeply felt to
be the Committee’s intolerable in
fringement of civil freedoms . . .
The failure of the police in asses
sing the nature of the crowd and
their brutality in dispersing them
turned a reasonable . . . legiti
mate . . . demonstration into a
riot.”
Furthermore, the student news
paper did call upon all students
to bring together much silver for
to pay barrister fees in defense of
their unfortunate follows, whose
demonstration and rioting was
suppressed by “black-shirted” po
lice who “looked tougher than a
stucco bathtub,” who outnumber
ed the students by a two to one
margin, and who worked diligent
ly to “further the impression of
a police state.”
Thus did the students and fac
ulty of the Great University un
mistakably proclaim the doctrine
that civil disobedience, even vio
lent civil disobedience, should bo
condoned and even commended if
such was the way in which col
lege students chose to express
their profoundest political convic
tions.
AND IT came to pass, two
years later, that the same govern
ment of the United States, with
the blessing of the same Supreme
Court, sought to enforce the su
preme law of the land by attempt
ing to enroll an individual at a
university in darkest Mississippi.

In that university, there dwelt
students who believed with all
their hearts, and all their minds,
and all their souls that the ac
tions of the Government, though
approved by the Supreme Court,
were immoral, unconstitutional,
and did intolerably transgress up
on the liberty of the people.
Therefore, the students re
solved to protest against this gov-1
ernmental transgression in the
most spectacular way possible.
They banded themselves together
and commenced to obstruct the
Government’s course of action.
And, 10, when federal marshals
attempted to quiet the students,
so that they might better hear
the words of the President, vio
lent rioting did ensue. Two per
sons were killed, scores were in
jured, 200 students were arrested, j
and the community was occupied
by more American soldiers than
were then stationed in West Ber
lin and South Vietnam combined.
BUT IN the Great University
near the Great City by the Great
Bay. no protestations of police
brutality were heard, no student
defense fund was raised, and the
88 faculty members sent no letter
to the Attorney General defend
ing the demonstrators. One
might, with more than idle curi
osity, wonder why.
The question is germane and,
perhaps, a bit embarrassing to
some. How, with any degree of
logical consistency, can one de
scribe the San Francisco HUAC
riots as “a reasonable protest by
mature college students” against
governmental action which they
felt to be unconstitutional and
immoral and, in the next breath,
condemn the rioting at “Ole Miss”
which was, presumably, prompt
ed by the same conviction?
If one believes, as we do, that
violent civil disobedience has no
moral or useful function in a
democratic society, such as that
in which we presently live, one
has no choice but to consider the
one as morally reprehensible and
unjustifiable as the other; and
has no choice but to deplore stu
dent assininity, rather than police
brutality, in each case.
IF, HOWEVER, one affirms the
premise that civil disobedience,
even when carried to riot propor
tions, is an acceptable form of ex
pression in our present democrat
ic society when prompted by sin
cere moral or political convictions
on the part of the demonstrators j
—as did the signatories of the let
ter to Mayor Christopher which
defended student rioters and de
cried police brutality two years

spread rioting did there ensue.
Students were injured, arrested,
and even cast into dungeons.
And, 10, the student newspaper
of a Great Private University
near the Groat City and 88 mem
bers of the faculty of the Great
University did immediately raise
the hue and cry in affirmation of
the students’ right to demon
strate, yea, to riot, if their actions
were prompted by conscience.
QUOTH an epistle which those
faculty members did send forth
to the Mayor of the Great City;
“The demonstration was for the
most part a responsible protest
by mature college students
against what they deeply felt to
be the Committee’s intolerable in
fringement of civil freedoms . . .
The failure of the police in asses
sing the nature of the crowd and
their brutality in dispersing them
turned a reasonable . . . legiti
mate . . . demonstration into a
riot.”
Furthermore, the student news
paper did call upon all students
to bring together much silver for
to pay barrister fees in defense of
their unfortunate follows, whose
demonstration and rioting was
suppressed by “black-shirted” po
lice who “looked tougher than a
stucco bathtub,” who outnumber
ed the students by a two to one
margin, and who worked diligent
ly to “further the impression of
a police state.”
Thus did the students and fac
ulty of the Great University un
mistakably proclaim the doctrine
that civil disobedience, even vio
lent civil disobedience, should bo
condoned and even commended if
such was the way in which col
lege students chose to express
their profoundest political convic
tions.
AND IT came to pass, two
years later, that the same govern
ment of the United States, with
the blessing of the same Supreme
Court, sought to enforce the su
preme law of the land by attempt
ing to enroll an individual at a
university in darkest Mississippi.

In that university, there dwelt
students who believed with all
their hearts, and all their minds,
and all their souls that the ac
tions of the Government, though
approved by the Supreme Court,
were immoral, unconstitutional,
and did intolerably transgress up
on the liberty of the people.
Therefore, the students re
solved to protest against this gov-1
ernmental transgression in the
most spectacular way possible.
They banded themselves together
and commenced to obstruct the
Government’s course of action.
And, 10, when federal marshals
attempted to quiet the students,
so that they might better hear
the words of the President, vio
lent rioting did ensue. Two per
sons were killed, scores were in
jured, 200 students were arrested, j
and the community was occupied
by more American soldiers than
were then stationed in West Ber
lin and South Vietnam combined.
BUT IN the Great University
near the Great City by the Great
Bay. no protestations of police
brutality were heard, no student
defense fund was raised, and the
88 faculty members sent no letter
to the Attorney General defend
ing the demonstrators. One
might, with more than idle curi
osity, wonder why.
The question is germane and,
perhaps, a bit embarrassing to
some. How, with any degree of
logical consistency, can one de
scribe the San Francisco HUAC
riots as “a reasonable protest by
mature college students” against
governmental action which they
felt to be unconstitutional and
immoral and, in the next breath,
condemn the rioting at “Ole Miss”
which was, presumably, prompt
ed by the same conviction?
If one believes, as we do, that
violent civil disobedience has no
moral or useful function in a
democratic society, such as that
in which we presently live, one
has no choice but to consider the
one as morally reprehensible and
unjustifiable as the other; and
has no choice but to deplore stu
dent assininity, rather than police
brutality, in each case.
IF, HOWEVER, one affirms the
premise that civil disobedience,
even when carried to riot propor

Once upon a time, the government of the United States, with
the consent of the Supreme Court of that land, did send to a Groat

so that the Government might gain the knowledge necessary for
rigorous enforcement of that which the Supremo Court had desig-

a Great

nated as the supreme law of the-<

In that country, there dwelt
students, watched over, by their

their hearts, and all their minds,
and all their souls, that the ac

approved by the Supreme Court,
were immoral, unconstitutional,

the liberty of the people.

and the debaucherous pursuit of
happiness. Having girded on the
armor of righteousness, they re

VERILY, THEY rose up in
haste and did trek lo the Great
City by the Great Bay; and did
sit. stand, and lie in the hallways,

raise their voices in protest, yea,
to such pitch and intensity that
the court in session two stories

ing to enroll an individual at a
university in darkest Mississippi.

In that university, there dwelt
students who believed with all
their hearts, and all their minds,
and all their souls that the ac
tions of the Government, though
approved by the Supreme Court,
were immoral, unconstitutional,
and did intolerably transgress up
on the liberty of the people.
Therefore, the students re
solved to protest against this gov-1
ernmental transgression in the
most spectacular way possible.
They banded themselves together
and commenced to obstruct the
Government’s course of action.
And, 10, when federal marshals
attempted to quiet the students,
so that they might better hear
the words of the President, vio
lent rioting did ensue. Two per
sons were killed, scores were in
jured, 200 students were arrested, j
and the community was occupied
by more American soldiers than
were then stationed in West Ber
lin and South Vietnam combined.
BUT IN the Great University
near the Great City by the Great
Bay. no protestations of police
brutality were heard, no student
defense fund was raised, and the
88 faculty members sent no letter
to the Attorney General defend
ing the demonstrators. One
might, with more than idle curi
osity, wonder why.
The question is germane and,
perhaps, a bit embarrassing to
some. How, with any degree of
logical consistency, can one de
scribe the San Francisco HUAC
riots as “a reasonable protest by
mature college students” against
governmental action which they
felt to be unconstitutional and
immoral and, in the next breath,
condemn the rioting at “Ole Miss”
which was, presumably, prompt
ed by the same conviction?
If one believes, as we do, that
violent civil disobedience has no
moral or useful function in a
democratic society, such as that
in which we presently live, one
has no choice but to consider the
one as morally reprehensible and
unjustifiable as the other; and
has no choice but to deplore stu
dent assininity, rather than police
brutality, in each case.
IF, HOWEVER, one affirms the
premise that civil disobedience,
even when carried to riot propor
tions, is an acceptable form of ex

Once upon a time, the government of the United States, with
the consent of the Supreme Court of that land, did send to a Groat
City by a Great Bay, a congressional investigatory committee. This,
so that the Government might gain the knowledge necessary for
rigorous enforcement of that which the Supremo Court had desig-

>s, with
a Great

nated as the supreme law of the-<
land.
In that country, there dwelt
students, watched over, by their
professors by day. And the stu
dents, having received great en
lightenment, believed with all
their hearts, and all their minds,
and all their souls, that the ac
tions of the Government, though
approved by the Supreme Court,
were immoral, unconstitutional,
and did intolerably infringe upon
the liberty of the people.
Lo, the students resolved to
abandon their lethargic frolick
ing: to no longer limit their con
cerns to mere drinking, dating,
and the debaucherous pursuit of
happiness. Having girded on the
armor of righteousness, they re
solved to express their indigna
tion at the Government's excres
cences in the most spectacular
way possible.
VERILY, THEY rose up in
haste and did trek lo the Great
City by the Great Bay; and did
sit. stand, and lie in the hallways,
doorways, and stairways of the
City Hall. They did, moreover,
raise their voices in protest, yea,
to such pitch and intensity that
the court in session two stories
above them was forced to recess
until such time as the words of
the learned judge could once
again be heard in the courtroom.
In time, the police of the Great
City attempted to quiet, then dis
perse, the students, and wide
spread rioting did there ensue.
Students were injured, arrested,
and even cast into dungeons.
And, 10, the student newspaper
of a Great Private University
near the Groat City and 88 mem
bers of the faculty of the Great
University did immediately raise
the hue and cry in affirmation of
the students’ right to demon
strate, yea, to riot, if their actions
were prompted by conscience.
QUOTH an epistle which those
faculty members did send forth
to the Mayor of the Great City;
“The demonstration was for the
most part a responsible protest
by mature college students
against what they deeply felt to
be the Committee’s intolerable in
fringement of civil freedoms . . .
The failure of the police in asses
sing the nature of the crowd and
their brutality in dispersing them
turned a reasonable . . . legiti
mate . . . demonstration into a
riot.”
Furthermore, the student news
paper did call upon all students
to bring together much silver for
to pay barrister fees in defense of
their unfortunate follows, whose
demonstration and rioting was
suppressed by “black-shirted” po
lice who “looked tougher than a
stucco bathtub,” who outnumber
ed the students by a two to one
margin, and who worked diligent
ly to “further the impression of
a police state.”
Thus did the students and fac
ulty of the Great University un
mistakably proclaim the doctrine

such was the way in which col

in which we presently live, one

unjustifiable as the other; and

brutality, in each case.

Once upon a time, the government of the United States, with
the consent of the Supreme Court of that land, did send to a Groat
City by a Great Bay, a congressional investigatory committee. This,
so that the Government might gain the knowledge necessary for
rigorous enforcement of that which the Supremo Court had desig-

>s, with
a Great

nated as the supreme law of the-<
land.
In that country, there dwelt
students, watched over, by their
professors by day. And the stu
dents, having received great en
lightenment, believed with all
their hearts, and all their minds,
and all their souls, that the ac
tions of the Government, though
approved by the Supreme Court,
were immoral, unconstitutional,
and did intolerably infringe upon
the liberty of the people.
Lo, the students resolved to
abandon their lethargic frolick
ing: to no longer limit their con
cerns to mere drinking, dating,
and the debaucherous pursuit of
happiness. Having girded on the
armor of righteousness, they re
solved to express their indigna
tion at the Government's excres
cences in the most spectacular
way possible.
VERILY, THEY rose up in
haste and did trek lo the Great
City by the Great Bay; and did
sit. stand, and lie in the hallways,
doorways, and stairways of the
City Hall. They did, moreover,
raise their voices in protest, yea,
to such pitch and intensity that
the court in session two stories
above them was forced to recess
until such time as the words of
the learned judge could once
again be heard in the courtroom.
In time, the police of the Great
City attempted to quiet, then dis
perse, the students, and wide
spread rioting did there ensue.
Students were injured, arrested,
and even cast into dungeons.
And, 10, the student newspaper
of a Great Private University
near the Groat City and 88 mem
bers of the faculty of the Great
University did immediately raise
the hue and cry in affirmation of
the students’ right to demon
strate, yea, to riot, if their actions
were prompted by conscience.
QUOTH an epistle which those
faculty members did send forth
to the Mayor of the Great City;
“The demonstration was for the
most part a responsible protest
by mature college students
against what they deeply felt to
be the Committee’s intolerable in
fringement of civil freedoms . . .
The failure of the police in asses
sing the nature of the crowd and
their brutality in dispersing them
turned a reasonable . . . legiti
mate . . . demonstration into a
riot.”
Furthermore, the student news
paper did call upon all students
to bring together much silver for
to pay barrister fees in defense of
their unfortunate follows, whose
demonstration and rioting was
suppressed by “black-shirted” po
lice who “looked tougher than a
stucco bathtub,” who outnumber
ed the students by a two to one
margin, and who worked diligent
ly to “further the impression of
a police state.”
Thus did the students and fac
ulty of the Great University un
mistakably proclaim the doctrine
that civil disobedience, even vio
lent civil disobedience, should bo
condoned and even commended if
such was the way in which col
lege students chose to express
their profoundest political convic
tions.
AND IT came to pass, two
years later, that the same govern
ment of the United States, with
the blessing of the same Supreme
Court, sought to enforce the su
preme law of the land by attempt
ing to enroll an individual at a
university in darkest Mississippi.

In that university, there dwelt
students who believed with all
their hearts, and all their minds,
and all their souls that the ac
tions of the Government, though
approved by the Supreme Court,
were immoral, unconstitutional,
and did intolerably transgress up
on the liberty of the people.
Therefore, the students re
solved to protest against this gov-1
ernmental transgression in the
most spectacular way possible.
They banded themselves together
and commenced to obstruct the
Government’s course of action.
And, 10, when federal marshals
attempted to quiet the students,
so that they might better hear
the words of the President, vio
lent rioting did ensue. Two per
sons were killed, scores were in
jured, 200 students were arrested, j
and the community was occupied
by more American soldiers than
were then stationed in West Ber
lin and South Vietnam combined.
BUT IN the Great University
near the Great City by the Great
Bay. no protestations of police
brutality were heard, no student
defense fund was raised, and the
88 faculty members sent no letter
to the Attorney General defend
ing the demonstrators. One
might, with more than idle curi
osity, wonder why.
The question is germane and,
perhaps, a bit embarrassing to
some. How, with any degree of
logical consistency, can one de
scribe the San Francisco HUAC
riots as “a reasonable protest by
mature college students” against
governmental action which they
felt to be unconstitutional and
immoral and, in the next breath,
condemn the rioting at “Ole Miss”
which was, presumably, prompt
ed by the same conviction?
If one believes, as we do, that
violent civil disobedience has no
moral or useful function in a
democratic society, such as that
in which we presently live, one
has no choice but to consider the
one as morally reprehensible and
unjustifiable as the other; and
has no choice but to deplore stu
dent assininity, rather than police
brutality, in each case.
IF, HOWEVER, one affirms the
premise that civil disobedience,
even when carried to riot propor
tions, is an acceptable form of ex
pression in our present democrat
ic society when prompted by sin
