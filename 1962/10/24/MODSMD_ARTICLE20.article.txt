Editor, The Daily:
From time to time in the his
tory of every individual unusual
provocation makes a resort to the
pen inevitable and justifiable.
Such provocation was proffered
in The Daily editorial of Tuesday,
October 23, entitled “Invade
Cuba.” Still, I do not intend to
shoot the responsible editor, for
several reasons: first, my action
would be disproportionate to the
alleged offense; second, such a
violently illegal action might be
smirch somewhat my claim to be
acting righteously: third, my ac
tion might offend some of the
editor’s friends, who could pro
cure guns as deadly as mine;
fourth, the people who favor nei
ther of us particular ly, and even
some of my own friends who re
spect law, might be somewhat
alienated by my unilateral move,
and I am not so “inner-directed”
as to enjoy that thought. When I
take a moment to stop and think
about these things (and I admit
it is not easy to do while I am

irritated or afraid), I feel less
like tightening my finger on the
trigger and more like finding an
other way out such as asking

an impartial third party to inves
tigate the dispute.
Tim Sherwood
Editor, The Daily:
1 do not approve of the United
States’ blockade of Cuba. I can
not see how the fact in itself of
Cuba’s possession of intermedi
ate-range missiles, presuming
that they have nuclear warheads,
very much lessens our security
when the Russians could deci
mate this country any day they
chose anyway.
But the Cubans and the Rus
sians will consider our blockade
a provocative act, and hence the
blockade will increase the danger
to us. Fidel Castro is a cruel man,
and I would rather see a better
man rule Cuba, but I greatly
doubt that any military action or
the threat of it by this country
can cause Cuba to be ruled more
humanely. If we were to occupy
Cuba, the Cuban people would
feel so outraged that sooner or
later their 1 support would enable
a rebel leader to expel us and to
become a dictator probably no
loss draconic, and certainly no
less hostile to the United States,
than Castro now is. And merely
our blockade will, I fear, antago
nize many Latin-Americans so
much that it will make it all the
more likely that other Castros
will come to power in other coun
tries there. 1 do not think that
Communism can ever be checked
or overthrown in an impoverished
country by armed force or the
threat of it. but only by economic
aid, and by pressure on govern
ments which preserve the wealth
of the few at the expense of mis
ery for the many to change their
policies, so that the conditions
that make people accept Commu
nist tyranny as the lesser 1 evil can
be eradicated.

smirch somewhat my claim to be
acting righteously: third, my ac

editor’s friends, who could pro
cure guns as deadly as mine;
fourth, the people who favor nei
ther of us particular ly, and even
some of my own friends who re
spect law, might be somewhat
alienated by my unilateral move,

take a moment to stop and think
about these things (and I admit
it is not easy to do while I am

irritated or afraid), I feel less

other way out such as asking

an impartial third party to inves

Tim Sherwood
Editor, The Daily:
1 do not approve of the United
States’ blockade of Cuba. I can
not see how the fact in itself of
Cuba’s possession of intermedi
ate-range missiles, presuming
that they have nuclear warheads,
very much lessens our security
when the Russians could deci
mate this country any day they
chose anyway.
But the Cubans and the Rus
sians will consider our blockade
a provocative act, and hence the
blockade will increase the danger
to us. Fidel Castro is a cruel man,
and I would rather see a better
man rule Cuba, but I greatly
doubt that any military action or
the threat of it by this country
can cause Cuba to be ruled more
humanely. If we were to occupy
Cuba, the Cuban people would
feel so outraged that sooner or
later their 1 support would enable
a rebel leader to expel us and to
become a dictator probably no
loss draconic, and certainly no
less hostile to the United States,
than Castro now is. And merely
our blockade will, I fear, antago
nize many Latin-Americans so
much that it will make it all the
more likely that other Castros
will come to power in other coun
tries there. 1 do not think that
Communism can ever be checked
or overthrown in an impoverished
country by armed force or the
threat of it. but only by economic
aid, and by pressure on govern
ments which preserve the wealth
of the few at the expense of mis
ery for the many to change their
policies, so that the conditions
that make people accept Commu
nist tyranny as the lesser 1 evil can
be eradicated.
Ken Morris
Editor, The Daily:
From time to time in the his
tory of every individual unusual
provocation makes a resort to the
pen inevitable and justifiable.
Such provocation was proffered
in The Daily editorial of Tuesday,
October 23, entitled “Invade
Cuba.” Still, I do not intend to
shoot the responsible editor, for
several reasons: first, my action
would be disproportionate to the
alleged offense; second, such a
violently illegal action might be
smirch somewhat my claim to be
acting righteously: third, my ac
tion might offend some of the
