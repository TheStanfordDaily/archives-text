# Civil Defense

Stanfordâ€™s civil defense proce
dures have not been changed in
light of the Cuba situation, ac
cording to File Chief John Man
sion, civil defense co-ordinator.
There arc no marked shelters.
In case of attack, which would be
signalled by a three-minute wail
ing siren, people should take shel
ter in the corridors of the lower
floors of buildings, Marston said.
A survey is being conducted by
the Federal government to find
areas that may lie used as fallout
shelters. These areas will be
marked then stocked with food
and supplies. This action is not
expected for at least 30 days,
Marston said.
The Stanford civil defense or
ganization was established in
World War II and has been kept
active since. It is designed to act
in either natural disaster or in
event of war.
There are limited food and
medical supplies stockpiled on the
campus. These include a 600-bed
hospital of pneumatic construc
tion and the necessary medical
supplies.
In the event of disaster the
Stanford civil defense organiza
tion will operate with the Santa
Clara county organization. So far
there have been no new federal
or state directives.
ago one cannot, without repudi
ating this premise, condemn any
conceivable form of civil disobe
dience which seems motivated by
conscience: even civil disobedi
ence as despicable as that which
erupted in Oxford, Mississippi,
three weeks ago.
