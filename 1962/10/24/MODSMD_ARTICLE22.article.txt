## Ice Hockey Good Clean Sport 
### Glenn Alford 
Know what the most dangerous physical contact sport in the
world is? Football, maybe. Bull fighting, perhaps. Crocodile wrestl
ing, possibly. I might have answered one of those to the question if
it has been asked of me before October 10.
But that night I went to the Cow Palace in San Francisco and
witnessed an ice hockey match between the San Francisco Seals and
the Portland Buckaroos.
Before entering the arena, all I knew about ice hockey was that
you try to score more goals into a net than your opponent, and that
there is a lot of fighting and physical contact on the ice. To say that
there is lots of physical contact in ice hockey is like' saying the San
Francisco Giants hit a leather-covered sphere.
And is there danger involved in ice hockey? The first thing that
met my eye when I entered the press area was a notice that veteran
Seal defense-man Jean-Marc Picard would be unable to participate
in that night’s contest because someone had slashed his throat with
a razor-sharp skate when he had fallen on the ice. Twenty-two
stitches were taken.
Hooray for Referee Popp
The game started auspiciously with the introduction of the
players. Quite naturally, the Seals got all the cheers, with mostly
silence greeting the Portland players. Then, the announcemet of
officials. “Referee tonight will be Number Three. Papp.” What fol
lowed was the longest boo to an introduction of an official that I
have ever heard. I soon found out why.
In the second period, Papp whistled Seal defense-man Tom
Thurlby to the penalty area for' two minutes, to the thunderous boos
of the 6,000 audience. All he did was hit an opposing player with the
blade of his hockey stick. Amid the boos that followed, SF owner
Coley Hall rushed up to Papp from his seat near the players’ bench
and shook his fist at the official, shouting unmentionables at him
that could be heard all over the arena.
“Good 01’ Coley,” I heard someone behind me say. as Papp
motioned another Seal to the penalty box for a “bench penalty.”
With only four Seals o ice agaist six Buckarooe, it seemed that a
big Portland gain would follow, but an over-anxious Buck accidental
ly elbowed Seal Nick Nickoski in the stomach trying to got the
puck. The Buck bench was outraged at the removal from the game
of the poor boy, who guilty only of trying to play the game too hard.
Seal fans had a different viewpoint. “You still stink Papp!”
About five minutes after the game started, a Buckaroo stag
gered out of the arena on the arm of a policeman, and the call came
over the public address system for a doctor to report to their
dressing room. Fans were heard to cheer and laugh at this comic
relief.
A Toot for Tom Thurlby
Moments later, Thurlby was tooted down by Papp after a Buck
aroo was seen to fly through the air and land on the hard ice with
a soggy plop. “Tommy’s starting early this year,” the fans said
jovially.
Later in the game, the Seals were ahead and seemed ready to
extend their 3-2 lead as a Buck was out with a two-minute penalty.
A Seal accidentally passed the puck in front of his goal to a Buck
aroo. As the Buckaroo tied the game up at 3-3 from five feet with
a slap shot travelling some 70 M.P.H., I heard a fan yell at the
goalie, “Bentley, you chicken!”
The Seals again had the advantage and Portland was fighting
back when three 200-pound Buck farwards broke past the defense
and set sail for the goal, with only the 165-pound Bentley between
them and the tying score. The goalie dove into their midst and
retrieved the puck. “It’s about time, Bentley, you chicken!” I heard
the fan behind me shout.
The Seals by now had warmed to their task and set about
methodically beating the Bucks into the sideboards and pulverizing
them on the ice. One sportswriter in front of me turned and said to
another, “They’re sure in good shape this year.”
The next morning in the newspaper, I saw the game described
as a “clean, hard-fought contest.”
Oh yes, the Seals won 4-3.
