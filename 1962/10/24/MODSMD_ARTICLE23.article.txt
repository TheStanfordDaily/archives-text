# Soccer Squad Meets CCSF Here Today
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Revenge will be the motive of
the Stanford soccer team today
when it meets the powerful City
College of San Francisco in a non
league affair at 3 p.m. on Stan
ford’s Harry Maloney Field.
This is the second of two meet
ings between CCSF and Stanford.
Earlier this year, the Tribe fell be
fore CCSF 4-1, but showed prom
ise after being behind 3-0 at the
end of the first quarter. They
have since Jived up to that prom
ise, tromping a good San Fran
cisco State team 7-2, and slaugh
tering Menlo College twice.
CCSF boasts the best goalie in
college soccer today in Gary De
long, who was virtually all of the
San Franciscans’ defense the last
time Stanford saw them.
Stanford Coach Fred Priddle
plans to start the same unit that
has won three straight games
since the initial loss to City Col
lege. Goalie will be Kent Mueller,

Fullbacks will be Sandy Pofahl
and Rich Lonergan. At halfback
will be Jim Armstrong, Bill
Teusch, and Don Burr, and at
forward the Cards will have Ed
Clark, A1 Nioli, Stu Rawlings, Don
Griffith, and Ken Stevens.
Also sure to see action are Klas
Bergman and Tom Paulson. Paul
son will be tested at goalie to de
termine if his injured back can
stand the strain, while Bergman
will play at a forward position.
