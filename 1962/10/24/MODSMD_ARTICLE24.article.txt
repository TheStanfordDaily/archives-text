# Naranja: Ready, Willing, and Able
## 
### 
The powerhouse of womenâ€™s
intramural football, Naranja of
Lagunita, opened up the season
last Sunday with a full squad
practice. Naranja had an unde
feated year in 1961, beating Hurl

hurt, 13-6, in its only game.
This year the team features
such stars as Sandy Denius, Ruth
Rouse, Kris Mu Hick, Penny Alex
ander and Genie Sharp. But realiz
ing that merely an outstanding

first string will not suffice in the
tough, seven-women, touch foot
ball competition, Naranja also has
depth, with 15 players composing
the squad.
With all this talent, experience,

and depth, Naranja lacks only one
tiling an opponent. Anyone man
aging a female team interested in
playing Naranja this fall, contact
Ruth Rouse in Lag to schedule a
game.
