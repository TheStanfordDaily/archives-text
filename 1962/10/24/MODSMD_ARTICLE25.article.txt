# HANG ON FOR WIN
## Frosh Beat San Jose State 21-12 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Stanford’s freshmen football
team, completely dominating play
in the first half, coasted to a 21-
12 win over San Jose Stale Sat
urday at Stanford Stadium.
The victory, viewed by some 50
rabid fans, 48 rallycommers, who
were setting up card stunts for
the varsity fiasco, and two sports
writers, left the Little Red with a
2-0 record.
Till'; INDIANS rolled to a 21-0
half-time lead, led once again by
a hard charging line and smooth
work in the backfield. Stanford
scored first in the opening quar
ter, without benefit of a pass. The
key gain in the long drive came

on a third down and 19 yards to
go play, when quarterback Mike
Connelly picked up (he first down
on a keeper play. Six plays later
I Glenn Myers dove in from one
I yard out. The kick failed, and
Stanford led by 0-0.
San Jose started to drive as ihe j
second period got underway, but j
fullback Charley Harraway’s fum
ble on the Stanford 40 was recov
ered by Myers stopping the threat.
The Cards put together another j
steady drive, sparked by a 19 yard
pass from Connelly to Ray Hand
ley that placed the ball on the SJS
nine. In his usual deceptive man- i
ner, Connelly ran for the score
from the seven, and after Joel Kay j
kicked the extra point, Stanford
had a 13-0 advantage.
TDK SPARTANS again started
to move after taking the kickoff, |
but a long pass play from quar-.
j terback Ken Berry to end Tim ;
! Knowles was called hack by a 15 |
I yard penalty. San Jose was forced j
j to punt, a play that might have
cost them the game. Tom Fox
took the kick on the Spartan 45
and sprinted untouched into the
end zone behind a wall of block-1
ers. Bob Stoecker added a two
point conversion, giving the In
j dians their 21-0, half-time margin. |
| The second half looked like an
\ other game. San Jose’s long-slum-
I bering offense suddenly came
! alive. From his own 27, Haifa
i way gained 21 yards on a pitch
j out. The Berry-to-Knowles com
bination netted 15 yards through
the air, and a personal foul
against Stanford put the ball on
Ihe Indian’s 12 yard line. A Berry
completion to Don Mills moved
the ball to the 5, and, finally, Har
raway picked up the score on the
next play.
STANFORD was immediately
forced to punt, and the Spartans
started another drive. On two
important third down and one
plays, first Mike Foley and then
Gary Scardina got the first downs.
The march carried into the fourth
quarter. Berry passed to John
Owens for 12 yards and then
lugged the ball himself to the

Stanford 23. Five plays later he
passed to Knowles for another
score, closing tlie gap to 21 12.
The jittery Cards, perhaps start
ing to look over their shoulders
at this point, saw Connelly’s pass
picked off by San Jose's Ned Reil
ley. The Indians finally came out
of their second half stuper in time
to recover a fumble on the 39.
They were able to hold off (he
Spartans for the remaining three
minutes, preserving the 21-12 ad
vantage.
The gap that Stanford was able
to open up in the first half was
the result of great team effort,
as was the case against USC last
week. In the second half the team
let down noticeably, hut still had
enough to hang on to the victory.
Connelly and Handley again turn
ed in great performances, as did
Glenn Myers in the backfield. The
entire line hit well on offense and
defense, particularly in the first
half.

AN UNIDENTIFIED San Jose back becomes a believer as he is smothered by an equally unidentified
Stanford lineman in Saturday's frosh game. Moving in to join the fun are tackle Bill Ogle (76) and
guard Lowell Wilson (64) for Stanford. Neatly taking themselves out of the play at the right are
two would-be San Jose blockers. Papooses won, 21-12.
