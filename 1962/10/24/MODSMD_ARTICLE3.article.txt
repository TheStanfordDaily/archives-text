# CRAIG:
## Prestige Falls In W. Germany 
### NANCY MARSHALL 
The mildly declining prestige of
German democracy is a more
serious problem than the alleged
rise of nationalism, militarism,
and neo-Nazism in present-day
Germany, said Gordon Craig, pro
fessor of German history in a
Tuesday Evening Series lecture
last night.
Craig, who has just returned
from six months as honorary pro
fessor at the Free University of
Berlin refuted the declaration by
Katherine Ann Porter in her cur
rent best-seller “Ship of Fools,”
that “the Germans have not
changed at all, that they are as
dangerous as they always were,
and that as soon as they get back
their power they will do it again.”
“BUT THE GERMANS have
changed,” Craig said. The dream
of German glory had certainly
died, and it is no longer a possi
bility to romanticize nuclear war.
Turning to the progress of
democracy in modern Western
Germany, the speaker said no
major party does not accept the
federal constitution and the re
publican form of government.
The revival of national socialist
splinter groups William Shirer
spoke of last year is confined to
the age group that was in its
prime in the 1930’5.
“Rather, more palpable con
cerns are rushing down upon
Germany,” Craig said. Despite
what is said about the progress of
democracy, it has been jeopard
ized by developments of the re
cent past.
“MORE IMPORTANT than
concern over neo-Nazism,” Craig
said, “is Adenauer’s refusal to
step out of office, which has
caused tho government’s prestige
to diminish. The government ar
gues over his interactibility, and
this hinders it from developing
constructive ideas concerning
both domestic and international
policies.
KZSU will rebmadcast Craig’s
speech tonight at 8:15 pan.
