# Rosencranz Concerned By Althen's Removal
## 
### PHILIP DeGUERE 
In a letter written yesterday
to Aldus Gaither, president of
the University of Colorado’s stu
dent body, ASSU President Armin
Rosencranz expressed “grave con
cern” over Editor Gary Althen’s
removal.'
Citing the free press as “one of
the concomitants of academic
freedom and student autonomy,”
j Rosencranz conveyed his belief
that tlte press loses its freedom
“when the president of the uni
versity unilaterally removes the
editor.”
CARL MITCHAM, the Univer-
I slty of Colorado senior whose let
[ ters printed in the college news
' paper resulted in the All hen’s dis

missal slated Monday that “the
whole affair indicates the shabby
nature of the American press,”
because he was quoted out of con
text for “sensationalist” purposes.
Although Mitcham stated that
he believed Althen’s printing of
the second letter did not show
poor editorial judgment, Rosen
| cranz questioned Althen’s discre
| tion. "It seems clear that your
| editor used poor judgment in his
| editorial policy. Perhaps his lack
I of judgment was serious enough
| to have merited his censure by a
1 vote of the Daily staff or the stu-
I dent body. The regrettable aspect
I of the affair is that the students
| were not allowed to deal with the
I situation themselves,” wrote Ro-
I sencranz.

Rosencranz concluded his letter
with the hope that the final deci
sion on Althen’s status would rest
with the student body.
MITCHAM CONTENDS that
the press in the Boulder area mis
represented the message of his
article as a personal tirade against
Senator Goldwater rather than
I stating his criticism of all poli-
I ticians.
The entire article was a discus
] sion of American politics and be
| gan with a review of Goldwater’s
two books, “The Conscience of a
I Conservative” and “Why Not Vic
tory?” He took issue with a num-
I her of Goldwater’s statements,
i but, claimed Mitcham, his criti
j cisms remained within the con-
I text of the review.
