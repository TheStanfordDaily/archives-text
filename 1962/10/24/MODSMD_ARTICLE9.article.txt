## Concern Heightens Over Cuba, China Tension Rises In Cuba Crisis China Seeks Peace Talks 
### 
The United States and Russia
headed into a possible military
showdown as some 25 Communist
ships bore down on a U.S. Atlan
tic fleet pledged to halt and
search them for any offensive
arms for Cuba.
At least 40 ships and 20,000
American men wore in the Carib
bean area. A special target of the
U.S. blockaders was a huge Sovi
et ship presumably rigged to car
ry 1,000- and 2,000-mile missiles.
However, the first test may come
from Red vessels that reach Cuba
sooner. Officials said they knew
where the approaching Commu
nist ships were and the Navy was
keeping a watchful eye on them.
THE .SOVIET Union, in swift
reaction to the U.S. blockade,
cancelled all troops leaves, or
dered the entire Communist bloc
to step up its military prepared
ness, and accused the United
States of “taking a step along the
road of unleashing a thermonu
clear world war.”
It called a meeting of military
leaders of the eight-nation War
saw Pact the “Communist
NATO”—and ordered the “united
arm forces” of the Soviet bloc to
increase their land and naval pre
paredness.
In reaction to these develop
ments, the Organization of Amer
ican States, acting nearly unani
mously, yesterday endorsed Pres
ident Kennedy's decision to throw
an armed blockade around Fidel
Castro’s Cuba, The resolution
was personally presented by Sec
retary of State Dean Rusk who
was making a rare appearance
before the council. The members
present took to heart Rusk's
warning that U.S. cities were not
the only strategic targets for So
viet missiles which have been
placed in Cuba.
IN EMERGENCY session yes
terday, the United States urged
the U.N. Security Council to ap
prove a resolution calling for dis
mantling and withdrawal of So
viet-supplied missile bases from
Cuba under U.N. supervision.
Russia countered with a resolu
tion for withdrawal of a U.S.
arms blockade of Cuba. It called
for the United States, Cuba, and
the Soviet Union to “enter into
negotiations with the purpose of
normalizing the situation, thus
removing the throat of war.”
Cuba said that it would not ac
cept U.N. observers on its soil
as proposed by the United States.
The impact of heightening ten
sions was felt elsewhere through
out the world.
• In Berlin some 5,000 U.S.
combat troops with tanks staged
war games yesterday as isolated
Berlin braced to meet any coun
ter-measures against the Cuban
blockade.
• Units of the First Marine
Division have been embarked
from Camp Pendleton. Calif., to
spend an indefinite time at sea,
the Pacific Fleet Headquarters in
Pearl Harbor announced yester
day.
• Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara last night ordered all
Navy and Marine personnel held
on active duty for as much as a
year beyond the expiration of
their normal tours.
• On Wall Street stocks took
their worst trouncing in four
months in the wake of the strong
U.S. stand in the Cuban situa
tion. Even the stalwart blue chips
turned green in the face of the
explosive situation in (he Carib
bean, after putting up a bold
front until mid-afternoon.

NEW DELHI Communist
China, its troops daily driving
deeper into Indian territory, called
suddenly today for an end of the
border fighting and a meeting of
the Chinese and Indian heads of
state to seek a peaceful settlement
of their bloody dispute.
The Red Chinese proposal for
negotiations was contained in Pei
ping Radio broadcast in the Chi
nese language. Shortly afterward
the Communist New China news
agency carried it in an English
language broadcast.
IN MAKING the proposal, the
Chinese government said it was
“inconceivable” that the border
dispute can bo settled by force
alone.
It proposed that the forces of
each side withdraw 20 kilometers
—12.5 miles —from the line of ac
tual control “and disengage.” The
communist statement said that
India has rejected three previous
Chinese proposals for negotia
tions.
China proposed a meeting be
tween Premier Jawaharlal Nehru
of India and Premier Chou En-lai
of China to work out a settlement.
The new Chinese bid came as
Chinese Communist troops, under
orders from Peiping to ignore the
boundaries, drove deeper into In
dia despite stiff resistance from
defending Indian forces.
AN INDIAN SPOKESMAN ad
mitted that Red forces are threat
ening Twang, a town of about
25,000, which is about 16 miles
south of the McMahon line on the
eastern sector of the broad battle
front. He said the situation on
the western front in Ladakh was
unchanged.
Chinese Communist broadcasts
claimed Red troops were advanc
ing on both sectors of the front,
almost 1,000 miles apart, scoring
new victories in spite of counter
attacks by Indian soldiers.
A Communist New China news
agency report said yesterday that
more Indian strongpoints fell to
the Chinese in the Chip Chap and
Galwan River valleys on the west
ern front.
At the same time it was offi
cially disclosed that Soviet Pre
mier Nikita S. Khrushchev and
Nehru had exchanged “communi
cations” since the undeclared bor
der war erupted last week.
A FOREIGN ministry spokes
man said Nehru received a letter
from Khrushchev last Saturday—-
the same day the Reds launched
the offensive and Nehru replied
on Monday. The contents of the
letters were not disclosed but re
liable sources said it concerned
the Sino-Indian dispute.
Diplomatic reports in London
Monday said Nehru had appealed
to Khrushchev to intervene with
Peiping to call off "aggression”
against India.
On the fighting front, a defense
ministry spokesman said the Chi
nese have driven seven miles from
Khinemane which fell to the
Reds last Saturday.
Khinemane was one of India’s
key defense posts in the North-
East Frontier Agency NEAF
along the disputed border with
Communist-occupied Tibet.
