EAT, SLEEP, AND MATRICULATE
The trouble with early morning classes is that you’re ton sleepy.
At late morning classes you’re to<> hungry. At early afternoon
classes you’re too logy. At late afternoon classes you’re too
hungry again. The fact is—and we might as well face it—there
is no good time of day to take a class.
What shall we do then? Abandon our colleges to the ivy? f
say no! I say America did not become the hope of mankind and
the world’s largest producer of hutterfats and tallow by running
away from a fight!
If you’re always too hungry or too sleepy for class, then let's
hold classes when you’re not too hungry or sleepy: namely, when
you're eating or sleeping.
(’lasses while eating are a simple matter. Just have a lecturer
lecture while the eaters eat. Hut watch out for noisy food. I
mean who can hear a lecturer lecture when everybody is crunch
ing celery or rnat/.o or like that? Serve quiet stuff like anchovy
paste on a doughnut, or steaming bowls of lamb fat.
And kindly observe silence while lighting your post-prandial
Marlboro Cigarette. Don’t be striking kitchen matches on your
:
TMicftout fawny food-'
jeans. Instead carry an ember from the dormitory fireplace in
your purse or pocket. Place the Marlboro against the ember.
Light it quietly. Smoke it quietly. Oh, I know 1 ask a great
deal! 1 know that one’s natural instinct upon encountering
Marlboro’s fine flavor and filter is to throw back one’s head and
bellow great, rousing cries of joy. But you must not. You must
contain your ecstacy, lest you disturb the lecturing lecturer.
You can, if you like, permit yourself a few small shudders of
pleasure as you smoke, but take care not to wear garments
which will set up a clatter when you shudder like taffeta, for
example, or knee cymbals.
Let us turn now to the problem of learning while sleeping.
First, can it be done?
Yes, it can. Psychologists have proved that the brain is
definitely able to assimilate information during sleep. Take, for
instance, a recent experiment conducted by a leading Eastern
university (Stanford). A small tape recorder was placed under
the pillow of the subject, a freshman named (Hebe Sigafoos.
When ( Hebe was fast asleep, the recorder was turned on. Softly,
all through the night, it repeated three statements in (Hebe's
slumbering ear:
1. Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109 and is called “The
Founder of English Eclectic Philosophy.
2. The banana plant is not a tree but a large perennial herb.
8. The Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914 at
Sarajevo by a young nationalist named Mjilas ('vet nic, who has
been called "The Trigger of World War 1.
When (Hebe awoke in the morning, the psychologists said to
him, “Herbert Spencer lived to the age of 109. What is he
called?”
Glebe promptly replied, “Perennial Herb.”
Next they asked him, “What has Mjilas Cvetnic been called?”
Replied Glebe, “Perennial Serb.”
Finally they said, “Is the banana plant a tree?”

EAT, SLEEP, AND MATRICULATE
The trouble with early morning classes is that you’re ton sleepy.
At late morning classes you’re to<> hungry. At early afternoon
classes you’re too logy. At late afternoon classes you’re too
hungry again. The fact is—and we might as well face it—there
is no good time of day to take a class.
What shall we do then? Abandon our colleges to the ivy? f
say no! I say America did not become the hope of mankind and
the world’s largest producer of hutterfats and tallow by running
away from a fight!
If you’re always too hungry or too sleepy for class, then let's
hold classes when you’re not too hungry or sleepy: namely, when
you're eating or sleeping.
(’lasses while eating are a simple matter. Just have a lecturer
lecture while the eaters eat. Hut watch out for noisy food. I
mean who can hear a lecturer lecture when everybody is crunch
ing celery or rnat/.o or like that? Serve quiet stuff like anchovy
paste on a doughnut, or steaming bowls of lamb fat.
And kindly observe silence while lighting your post-prandial
Marlboro Cigarette. Don’t be striking kitchen matches on your
:
TMicftout fawny food-'
jeans. Instead carry an ember from the dormitory fireplace in
your purse or pocket. Place the Marlboro against the ember.
Light it quietly. Smoke it quietly. Oh, I know 1 ask a great
deal! 1 know that one’s natural instinct upon encountering
Marlboro’s fine flavor and filter is to throw back one’s head and
bellow great, rousing cries of joy. But you must not. You must
contain your ecstacy, lest you disturb the lecturing lecturer.
You can, if you like, permit yourself a few small shudders of
pleasure as you smoke, but take care not to wear garments
which will set up a clatter when you shudder like taffeta, for
example, or knee cymbals.
Let us turn now to the problem of learning while sleeping.
