# Dean Calls Provision of Constitution 'Unwise'
## 
### WILLIAM REPPY Associate Editor 
Dean of Students H. Donald Winbigler yesterday criticized the
proposed new ASSU constitution for relieving Legislature of the
obligation to grant or deny official recognition to new student
organizations.

He charged that “ it would seem unwise for LASSU to

abrogate its authority and re-'
sponsibility in this area.”
The new constitution would re
quire only that student organiza
tions “register with (he ASSU and
pledge to abide by the Funda
mental Standard,” according to
ASSU President, Armin Rosen
cranz.

Under the existing constitu
tion Legislature must vote its of
ficial approval of student organ
izations before they can begin to
operate on campus.

“CENSORING is something
Legislature has no desire to par
ticipate in.” Rosencranz said.
“We feel it would be irresponsi
ble to assume control over a func
tion we consider improper,” was
his rebuttal to Winbigler’s asser
tion that LASSU is responsible
for controlling student groups
permitted on campus.
The Doan said that securing
“assurance that (an) organiza
tion is integrated with the ASSU
and existing student organiza
tions both structurally and with
respect to function ... is within
the jurisdiction of LASSU.”

WHILE THIS step in the offi
cial recognition of an organiza
tion should be handled by LASSU,
another phase of the process “is
clearly a matter for the Universi
ty to determine and no doubt it
should be so recognized in the
proposed now constitution,” Win
bigler said.
This is the determining that an
organization is within the general
framework of University policy.
If the new constitution is ap
proved the University will be the
sole judge of an organization’s
fate.

IN REGARD to this possibility
Winbigler said;
“If the entire process were
thrown back to the University,
it undoubtedly would be admin
istered by the Dean of Students’
Office with the advice of a faculty
committee. In this event I sur
mise that in each case the advice
of LASSU would be sought” with
regard to determining if an or
ganization is integrated with
ASSU and existing groups.

Rosencranz said that even un
der the new Constitution LASSU
approval would be required of
student organizations that draw
on ASSU funds.
