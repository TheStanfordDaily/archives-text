# Speakers Reject Cuban Blockade
## 
### CHRIS CHRISMAN 
Three professors registered
their protest to the Cuban block
ade in the opening remarks of a
discussion of the Cuban crisis in
Tresidder’s Upper Lounge last
night.
Drs. George Leppert, Bruce
Franklin, and Hal Holman point
ed out that the Cuban quarantine
was unethical, hypocritical and a
threat to humanity.
Leppert, of the Nuclear Engi
neering Dept., began the talks,
stating that White House mail
was running 12 to one in favor of
Kennedy’s action. What concerned
Leppert was why one out of 12
did not support it.
Speaking for that minority,
Leppert said that since he knew
nuclear weapons and their ef
fects and was a member of the
human race, he felt he must pro
test against anything that makes
possible a thermonuclear war.
AN ACTION such as the block
ade must be judged on three
counts, suggested Dr. Franklin
of the English Dept., the prag
matic, the ideological, and the
ethical. The U.S., he said, failed
on all three points when they sup
ported the counter-revolution
aries. Applying the three tests to
the Cuban blockade, Franklin
said that while the pragmatic test
was hard to apply, the U.S. defi
nitely failed the ideological test
by its violation of international
law. “The ethical test,” he said,
“I can leave to your own judg
ment.”
Dr. Holman of the Medical
School pointed out the hypoc
risy of the blockade in the light
of our 15-year-old policy of de
terrence, by which we have al
ways maintained that bases on
foreign territory when requested
by the government involved are
perfectly moral and legal. “We
have established by our own con
duct a policy we are now deny
ing to our own adversary," ho
concluded.
These remarks were followed
by a serious discussion, in which
students and faculty endeavored
to understand the issues involved
in the Cuban blockade.
