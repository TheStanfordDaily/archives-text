“HELP! INVASION!” was the cry at the ASSU office when this fearsome foursome of Cubans marched
in. Straight from the Stanford UN, (left to right) B. Roca (E. B. Schnoller) holding the chicken, F. Castro
(Jerry Jackson) chairman of the group and also the smallest, R. Castro holding the placard, and M.
Gavez (Ed Blair) with rifle, paid a complementary visit to the offices of Armin Rosencranz. The chicken,
Fidel, will be dinner; they plan to camp somewhere in the area.
