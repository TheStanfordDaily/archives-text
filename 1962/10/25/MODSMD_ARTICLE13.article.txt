## U.S. Blockade Meets First Test As Russian Vessels Turn Back 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Some
of the 25 Communist ships under
U.S. surveillance in the Atlantic
and which were apparently
once headed toward U.S. forces
blockading Cuba have apparently
changed course.
The Defense Department made
the announcement last night in
one of the most cryptic state
ments of the Cuban crisis. It
also said that American block
ading forces had not yet been
forced to order any of the vessels
to halt.
This meant that at that late
hour none of the Communist ves
sels had tried to run the blockade,
although Defense Secretary Mc-
Namara had said that he expect
ed them to make the attempt
some time yesterday.
THE ANNOUNCEMENT came
as United Nations Secretary-Gen
eral U Thant sent identical ap
peals to President Kennedy and
Soviet Premier Khrushchev seek
ing to ease the Cuban situation.
Kennedy has turned down
Thant’s appeal, according to
Press Secretary Pierre Salinger.
These developments, plus a
Moscow statement by Khrush
chev, had the effect of easing—

although slightly the tenseness
that has hung over Washington
since the crisis burst on the
world Monday night.
IN REPLY to a telegram from
British pacifist-philosopher Rus
sell, Khrushchev was quoted by
the official Soviet Tass news
agency as saying that the Soviet
Union “will take no rash decis
ions” as a result of the Cuban
crisis.
But he also was quoted as say
ing that if the United States gov
ernment “carries out its planned
program of piratical action, then
of course we shall have to make
use of the means of defense
against the aggressor; we have
no other way out.”
SUPPORT for the United
States’ firm stand came from
many countries and took a vari
ety of forms.
• In Ottawa, the Canadian gov
ernment said it would refuse to
allow munitions to be carried
aboard Cuba-bound planes land
ing at Canadian airfields. Canada
thus .joins the United States in
taking steps to prevent Russia
from shipping offensive weapons
to Cuba by air.
• French ambassador Roger
Seydoux gave his country’s full
support to the U.S. quarantine
and attempt to remove Soviet
missiles and their bases from
Cuba. Seydoux was the first
speaker at last night’s meeting of
the UN Security Council.
• EARLIER IN THE day the
council heard Britain accuse Rus
sia of reckless double dealing and
sinister deceit in establishing

missile bases in Cuba. Ireland in
dicated support without specific
ally saying so.
• Venezuela, speaking to the
council for all Latin America, ex
pressed continental concern
about the hemispheric throat and
called upon Russia to end it.
• A State Department official
said several Latin American
countries had offered warships or
port facilities to support the U.S.
blockade. Ships were offered by
Argentina and port facilities for
the U.S. fleet by Costa Rica and
Honduras.

A poll taken last night of
20 living groups showed that
of those who answered 267
favored invasion of Cuba and
1849 did not.
