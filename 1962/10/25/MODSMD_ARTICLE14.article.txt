### ANN TODD 
“The wish to remedy local
grievances always outweighed
any feeling of mutual solidarity,”
Dr. Carlisle Aylmer Macartney
summed up as the reason for the
weakness of the Central Euro
pean states, in a lecture, “East
Central Europe Since 1918 A
Retrospect and an Evaluation,”
at Tresidder Union yesterday. He
defined the Central European
states as those which lie between
Germany on the West and Russia
on the East.
After giving the historical
background of the area, Macart
ney, lecturer and teacher at Ox
ford on problems of Central Eu
rope, stated, “It is still not irrele
vant to power whether one nation
dominates these states, for they
are still a factor in the balance of
power.”
“IF WE AGAIN have the op
portunity to play with the map,”
he continued, “we should draw
the frontiers along ethnic lines,
for these people are more united
through racial origins.”
When asked about the likeli
hood of a disengagement of So
viet and American troops in the
area. Macartney stated that it is
unlikely unless power weakens
in Moscow, and “they show no
sign of weakening.” Ho added
that a “neutralized Central Eu
rope is a greater possibility than
a united one, for Russia would
not accept a united one at her
front door.”
