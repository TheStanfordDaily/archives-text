At the University of Colorado a storm is raging over the rights
and the responsibilities of the university newspaper. The editor
has been fired for publishing an article by a member of the staff
calling Senator Goldwater a fool and murderer in the context of a
book review. The editor also printed a letter by the hook reviewer
that called former President Eisenhower a “futzer,” however that
may be defined.
It is unfair to judge the editor on the basis of a quotation
taken out of context from an article in the newspaper. Yet, it woidd
appear that the editor exercised poor judgment in publishing
either the letter or the book review. For this negligence President
Quigg Newton fired Gary Althen, the editor.
Even granted the impropriety of the article and letter, the
president’s action is pre-emptory and irresponsible. It is possible
for the president to enforce responsibility upon the newspaper by
firing those whose own sense of responsibility may be wanting.
However, it is impossible to foster responsibility by discouraging
the initiative of students who are learning responsibility the only
way possible: through practical experience. Admonition is prefer
able to pre-emptive action under the circumstances.
Undeniably, a free press is dangerous and a free student press
even more dangerous. Irresponsibility and negligence are always
potential concomitants, but responsibility and judgment are im
possible to learn under conditions of censorship and surveillance.
