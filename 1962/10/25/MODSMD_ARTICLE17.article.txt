## 'Cognitive Dissonance' Motivates Behavior 
### PAGE EDWARDS 
(“Cognitive Dissonance,” by
Leon Festinger, Scientific Ameri
can, October.)
Here is an experiment involv
ing cognitive dissonance to try on
your roommate.
Leon Festinger, professor of
psychology at Stanford, suggests:
“BUY TWO presents, choosing
things you are reasonably sure
he will find about equally attrac
tive. Find some plausible excuse
for having both of them in your
possession, show them to him
and ask him to tell you how at
tractive each one is to him. After
you have obtained a good mea
surement of attractiveness, tell
him that he can have one of them,
whichever he chooses. The other
you will return to the store. After
he has made his choice, ask him
once more to evaluate the attrac
tiveness of each of them. If you
compare the evaluation of attrac
tiveness before and after the
choice, you will probably find that
the chosen present has increased
in attractiveness and the rejected
one decreased.”
The behavior can be explained
by cognitive dissonance, a theory
Festinger began to develop in
1951 at Stanford.
The theory centers, says Fes
tinger in the article, on the idea
that if a person knows various
things that are not psychological
ly consistent with another, he will
in a variety of ways, try to make
them more consistent.
TWO ITEMS of information
that psychologically do not fit
together are said to be in disso
nant relation to each other. The
items of information may he
about behavior, feelings, opinions,
things in the environment and so
on. The word “cognitive” simply
emphasizes, according to Festin
ger, that the theory deals with
relations among items of infor

mation.
Cognitive dissonance is a mo
tivating state of affairs. Just as
hunger impels a person to eat,
dissonance impels a person to
change an existing opinion or be
havior to relieve dissonance and
create consistency in opinion, feel
ing or things in the environment.
Festinger’s theory attempts to
prove that “the grass is usually
not greener on the other side of
the fence and that grapes are
sourest when they are in easy
reach.”
FESTINGER writes that to un
derstand cognitive dissonance as
a motivating state it is necessary
to have a clearer conception of
the conditions that produce it.
The simplest example of the the
ory can be given in terms of a
person’s expectation. When such
an expectation is not fulfilled dis
sonance exists.

If a person is standing unpro
tected in the rain and not getting
wet, to regain consistency, the
person would probably go inside.
Aided by experiments, graphs
and cartoons by Blechman, Fes
tinger explains the theory of cog
nitive dissonance by showing its
applications to specific situations
—the effects of making a decis
ion, of lying and of temptation.

ONE OF Blechman’s cartoons
portrays a man deciding between
two identical women—a dissonant
dilemma. After placing a ring on
the left hand of one woman to re
lieve the dissonance (ie. to make
the grass greener on his side) he
conceives the chosen woman as
an angel. The other, left sitting
on the couch, has taken on de
monic characteristics in the man’s
mind—horns and a tail.
The Scientific American article
is not written in involved scien
tific language but is light and
easy to understand. Blechman’s
cartoons also aid immensely to
illustrate Festinger’s point.
