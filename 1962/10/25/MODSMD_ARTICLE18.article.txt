# Bolshoi Performs 'Swan Lake' Brilliantly in San Francisco Debut
## 
### PAMELA NOWLIN 
(The Bolshoi ballet is presently
performing at the Fox Theatre in
San Francisco.)
Despite the fact that a good
portion of San Francisco society
found it inconvenient to arrive on
time for the Premiere Opening of
the Bolshoi ballet, the audience
witnesed one of the most brilliant,
if lengthy, versions, of Peter Tchai
kovsky's Swan Lake ever per
formed in this country.
The technical precision of the
twenty-four swans in the corps de
ballet was most impressive. The
Bolshoi appears to be one of the
few ballet companies around that
demands as high standards of per
fection from their corps as from
their soloists. Credit should also
go to the-choreographer here, for
smooth, uncluttered blocking of
the corps’ movements. One of the
high points was the “Dance of the
Little Swans” in Act 11. Thanks
to the lightness and suppleness of
the dancers, noise from the toe
slippers was nearly inaudible.
Prima Ballerina Maya Pliset
skaya is everything that has been
claimed of her. Her interpretation
of Odette’s first meeting with
Prince Seigreid in Act II was so

sensitive, she cast a spell over
more than a few members of the
audience. Her gracious “swan
like” movements though techni
cally difficult appeared effortless.

Nicolai Fadeyechev as Prince
Seigfreid gave fluidity rather
than strength to his role. Al
though his dancing was supei’b,
his dramatic interpretation was
somewhat flighty and unconvinc
ing. Both the Court Jester and the
Sorcerer danced spectacular
roles; the former with wit and
exuberance although he was seen
a little too often. His uncountable
“tours a la seconde” were charac
teristic of the strength of his role.
The sets were in extremely
good taste, ornate without being
oppressing. The costuming em
phasized simplicity with the Little
Swans, color and vitality in the
Court scenes. The orchestra had
its ups and downs which was
partly due to its motley character.
Lack of rehearsal time with the
American musicians may have
also contributed.

Hopefully the Bolshoi will
make repeated tours of (he
United States in the future. It is
seldom ballet-goers in San Fran
cisco witness such a night of clas
sic excellence.

Swans, color and vitality in the
Court scenes. The orchestra had
its ups and downs which was
partly due to its motley character.
Lack of rehearsal time with the
American musicians may have
also contributed.

Hopefully the Bolshoi will
make repeated tours of (he
United States in the future. It is
seldom ballet-goers in San Fran
cisco witness such a night of clas
sic excellence.
(The Bolshoi ballet is presently
performing at the Fox Theatre in
San Francisco.)
Despite the fact that a good
portion of San Francisco society
found it inconvenient to arrive on
time for the Premiere Opening of
the Bolshoi ballet, the audience
witnesed one of the most brilliant,
if lengthy, versions, of Peter Tchai
kovsky's Swan Lake ever per
formed in this country.
The technical precision of the
twenty-four swans in the corps de
ballet was most impressive. The
Bolshoi appears to be one of the
few ballet companies around that
demands as high standards of per
fection from their corps as from
their soloists. Credit should also
go to the-choreographer here, for
smooth, uncluttered blocking of
the corps’ movements. One of the
high points was the “Dance of the
Little Swans” in Act 11. Thanks
to the lightness and suppleness of
the dancers, noise from the toe
slippers was nearly inaudible.
Prima Ballerina Maya Pliset
skaya is everything that has been
claimed of her. Her interpretation
of Odette’s first meeting with
Prince Seigreid in Act II was so

sensitive, she cast a spell over
more than a few members of the
audience. Her gracious “swan
like” movements though techni
cally difficult appeared effortless.

Nicolai Fadeyechev as Prince
Seigfreid gave fluidity rather
than strength to his role. Al
though his dancing was supei’b,
his dramatic interpretation was
somewhat flighty and unconvinc
ing. Both the Court Jester and the
Sorcerer danced spectacular
roles; the former with wit and
exuberance although he was seen
a little too often. His uncountable
“tours a la seconde” were charac
teristic of the strength of his role.
The sets were in extremely
good taste, ornate without being
oppressing. The costuming em
phasized simplicity with the Little
Swans, color and vitality in the
Court scenes. The orchestra had
its ups and downs which was
partly due to its motley character.
