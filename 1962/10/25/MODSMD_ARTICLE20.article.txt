This year, the French govern
ment and 1 tie Parliament had to
decide in what direction the
French economy was going to
move. We adopted the Fourth
Plan, and it was the occasion for
everybody to think about the util
ity- the necessity of an econom
ic plan and the purposes of such
an enterprise. That is one of the
reasons why this question is so
real and interesting at this time,
in France, and even in foreign
countries where government offi
cials and economists are inter
ested in the French experience.
1. The origins and dominant
ideas of the plan.
THE FRENCH experiment in
planning goes back fifteen years.
The origin was the decision taken
in 194.1 by the Provisional Govern
ment of the Republic, under Gen
eral do Gaulle, to have a Modern
ization and Equipment Plan
drawn up to face the difficulties
created by the war. The wind of
reform that was blowing over
France brought with it, along
with the idea of nationalizing the
key sectors of the economy, the
ideal of substituting the plan for
certain market mechanizations
that had lasted before the war to
remedy the economic and social
consequences of the great crisis
of the 19.30’5. But more than ide
ology, a realistic appraisal of the
country’s situation prompted a de
sire for planning in order to max
imize national income with limit
ed means. The choice, in this First
Plan was in favor of the basic
sectors of the economy. One of
the refreshing aspects of this plan
was the working methods, which,
under Jean Monnet’s influence
were adopted.
The idea was that the plan was
a collective enterprise in whose
preparation everyone affected by
it implementation would be di
rectly or indirectly associated.
This concept of “concerted econ
omy” was very quickly adopted
by the government officials, the
businessmen and some of the
workers’ unions and the experi
ence showed that it worked very
well.
In the Second Plan, the concern
with providing for the key indus
tries began to give way to a con
cern for harmonized growth. The
main point of this plan was to
produce better under competitive
conditions of quality and price,
and on the whole the target fig
ures of the second plan were ex
ceeded.
THE THIRD PLAN (1958-61)
was a true development plan
which sought, under conditions of
monetary stability and balanced
foreign payments, to achieve a
major economic expansion, in
creasing national product by 20
per cent in four years.
2. Why an economic plan and
what kind?
The modern economy requires
the employment of large invest
ments whose profitability may be
profoundly affected by changes in
environment, which are very dif
ficult to forecast. Each private
company tries to predict these
changes by the study of the mar
ket. The guiding idea of indica
tive planning is to coordinate all
the partial studies, by doing on a
nation-wide scale what the iron
and steel manufacturers? for in
stance do with regard to their
supplies and their markets.
BUT THE plan is not only a
substitute for the “generalized
market.” Insofar as it seeks to
fill the gaps and correct the faults
in the spontaneous evolution of
the economy, it is an affirmation
of will. For instance, significant
choices were made in the Fourth
Plan.
The first choice, envisioned in
conformity with the opinion of
the Economic and Social Council
about the desirable structure of
final demand is in favor of direct
ing that demand toward the col
lective investments services in
preference to proliferation of in
dividual consumers goods (the
“gadget civilization”).
The second choice is in favor of
social action for the benefit of
most needy sectors of the popu
lation (families, students, wage
earners and farm workers).
THE THIRD choice is for ac
tion designed to reduce regional
imbalances to the greatest possi
ble extent. The economic theory
of optional location has not been
developed very much but this ac
tion is one of the most interest
ing in public affairs.
Two main problems now con
front the people in charge of the
French Plan: the extension of the
idea of planning from the nation
al to the multi-national scale (a
European Plan) and the improve
ment of the “democratic” way of
preparing the plan.
No definite answer can be given
to these questions, which are very
many-sided.
THUS WE MUST answer
through the plan this essential
question: What content will man
give to the Affluent Society, pro
claimed by K. J. Galbraith? Pow-
