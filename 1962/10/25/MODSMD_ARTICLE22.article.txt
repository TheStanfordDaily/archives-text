University life and student affairs in West Berlin are closely
connected with the political situation. The old Berlin Humboldt Uni
versity, which was founded in 1810, is located in the Eastern part of
the city. Soon after the war was over, the communists occupied this

school and made it a center fc* +
their ideology and propaganda.
Every free expression of opin
ion was suppressed, and those
students who defended an inde
pendent and neutral position in
the student councils had to flee to
universities in West Germany. At
this time, when all efforts to es
tablish the basic rights of free
dom and justice in the old school
failed, the call for a new founding
of a free university in the West
ern sector of Berlin grew louder
and louder.
THE EDITORS of the student
magazine “Colloquium’ started a
campaign, calling for a new, in
dependent university, where the
Berlin students could study ac
cording to their own wishes. The
students who were involved in
this campaign were consequently
expelled from the University. On
April 23, 1948, the campaign cul
minated in an impressive protest
meeting of the Berlin student
body in the British sector border
ing on the Soviet sector.
The students again demanded a
new free university and asked the
city authorities and the occupying
powers for support. This help was
gradually granted and in Octo
ber, 1948, the formation of the
Free University was an estab
lished fact. More than 2,000 stu
dents who were still enrolled in
the old Berlin University signed
the lists for application.
In December, 1948, lectures be
gan. and the ceremonious inau
guration took place. There were
still a lot of difficulties to over
come. Nothing like a university
campus existed at that time. The
lectures were hold in various
buildings all over the town, and
there was no furniture available;
the students had to sit on chests
or bring their own chairs. The
teaching staff had to be com
pleted and a new library built out
of nothing.
NOWADAYS The Free Univer
sity is one of the best and largest
schools in Germany: There are
about 14.000 students, of which
the majority are residents of
West Berlin.
With the help of the Ford
Foundation and the West German
Government the buildings of the
various faculties and institutes
were erected. Most of these form
the main campus in the suburban
district of Dahlem, but a large
number of institutes and depart
ments still are spread all over
the city. The pressure of increas
ing student numbers and the in
creasingly specialized sciences
compelled the University to a
forced enlargement. A construc
tion plan was set up in 1960
which includes 52 new construc
tion projects for the next ten
years.
Since the founding of the uni
versity thousands of students
have completed their studies in
freedom. Before the erection of
the wall about 25 per cent came
from the East Zone of Germany,
either as refugees or still as resi
dents of East Berlin, crossing the
border every day. The Free Uni
er, consumption, creation, leisure
. . . ? More exactly, in what pro
portions do these complimentaiy
objectives have to be contained?
To answer this question, it is
necessary, according to the
French philosopher Gaston Bryer,
who created the recent “Prospec
tive Movement,” to “analyze in
depth, to take the long view, the
broad view, to think of man.”

►
versify became an important
bridge between both parts of Ger
many, and in many ways helped
to ease the material need and
spiritual isolation of students in
East Germany.
THE BUILDING of the wall
came as a complete surprise to
everybody. Some of the border
crossing students happened to be
in West Berlin on that day, and
they decided not to return. The
University tried to support them
as much as possible, especially in
the first few days, when they
were left destitute away from
their homes.
Other students living in East
Berlin were forbidden to cross the
border any more; they also were
denied the chance to continue
their studies in East Germany
and were forced to work in fac
tories or on farms. More students
from West Germany and abroad
have taken their place. The idea
behind this is to bring every stu
dent from West Germany for one
semester to Berlin to experience
the Berlin situation. This, of
course, would go far beyond the
capacity of the Free University.
There are certain plans under
discussion to build an additional
university in West Berlin for this
purpose.
The Free University is to be
distinguished from West German
universities by its legal structure.
It has its own administrative
management and its own personal
sovereignty; it receives a lump
sum subsidy from the state. The
Free University was actually
founded by the students them
selves, and ever since, the stu
dents have had a strong voice in
all campus concerns. The student
representation consists of an
elected Parliament and an execu
tive power, which is split up into
departments of political, finan
cial, interior, and exterior con
cern. This government works
closely together with the univer
sity administration.
The students of the Free Uni
versity are very proud of the fact
that they have a seat and voice in
the faculties, the Senate and the
board of trustees. This achieve
ment is unique since in most
other universities, in Germany as
well as in other countries, the
students have no vote in admin
istrative matters.
This privilege which the stu
dents of the Free University have
is partly due to the special posi
tion and tasks of the university
and the active part the students
took in its founding and evolu
tion. Most students are quite
aware of the doubtful political
situation and take the chance to
share responsibilities in the stu
dent body organizations as an ex
perience for their future life.

minated in an impressive protest
meeting of the Berlin student
body in the British sector border
ing on the Soviet sector.
The students again demanded a
new free university and asked the
city authorities and the occupying
powers for support. This help was
gradually granted and in Octo
ber, 1948, the formation of the
Free University was an estab

dents who were still enrolled in
the old Berlin University signed
the lists for application.
In December, 1948, lectures be
gan. and the ceremonious inau

still a lot of difficulties to over
come. Nothing like a university
campus existed at that time. The
lectures were hold in various
buildings all over the town, and
there was no furniture available;
the students had to sit on chests
or bring their own chairs. The
teaching staff had to be com
pleted and a new library built out
of nothing.
NOWADAYS The Free Univer
sity is one of the best and largest
schools in Germany: There are
about 14.000 students, of which
the majority are residents of
West Berlin.
With the help of the Ford
Foundation and the West German
Government the buildings of the
various faculties and institutes
were erected. Most of these form
the main campus in the suburban
district of Dahlem, but a large
number of institutes and depart
ments still are spread all over
the city. The pressure of increas
ing student numbers and the in
creasingly specialized sciences
compelled the University to a
forced enlargement. A construc
tion plan was set up in 1960
which includes 52 new construc
tion projects for the next ten
years.
Since the founding of the uni
versity thousands of students
have completed their studies in
freedom. Before the erection of
the wall about 25 per cent came
from the East Zone of Germany,
either as refugees or still as resi
dents of East Berlin, crossing the
border every day. The Free Uni
er, consumption, creation, leisure
. . . ? More exactly, in what pro
portions do these complimentaiy
objectives have to be contained?
To answer this question, it is
necessary, according to the
French philosopher Gaston Bryer,
who created the recent “Prospec
tive Movement,” to “analyze in
depth, to take the long view, the
broad view, to think of man.”

►
versify became an important
bridge between both parts of Ger
many, and in many ways helped
to ease the material need and
spiritual isolation of students in
East Germany.
THE BUILDING of the wall
came as a complete surprise to
everybody. Some of the border
crossing students happened to be
in West Berlin on that day, and
they decided not to return. The
University tried to support them
as much as possible, especially in
the first few days, when they
were left destitute away from
their homes.
Other students living in East
Berlin were forbidden to cross the
border any more; they also were
denied the chance to continue
their studies in East Germany
and were forced to work in fac
tories or on farms. More students
from West Germany and abroad
have taken their place. The idea
behind this is to bring every stu
dent from West Germany for one
semester to Berlin to experience
the Berlin situation. This, of
course, would go far beyond the
capacity of the Free University.
There are certain plans under
discussion to build an additional
university in West Berlin for this
purpose.
The Free University is to be
distinguished from West German
universities by its legal structure.
It has its own administrative
management and its own personal
sovereignty; it receives a lump
sum subsidy from the state. The
Free University was actually
founded by the students them
selves, and ever since, the stu
dents have had a strong voice in
all campus concerns. The student
representation consists of an
elected Parliament and an execu
tive power, which is split up into
departments of political, finan
cial, interior, and exterior con
cern. This government works
closely together with the univer
sity administration.
The students of the Free Uni
versity are very proud of the fact
that they have a seat and voice in
the faculties, the Senate and the
board of trustees. This achieve
ment is unique since in most
other universities, in Germany as
well as in other countries, the
students have no vote in admin
istrative matters.
This privilege which the stu
dents of the Free University have
is partly due to the special posi
tion and tasks of the university
and the active part the students
took in its founding and evolu
tion. Most students are quite
aware of the doubtful political
situation and take the chance to
share responsibilities in the stu
dent body organizations as an ex
perience for their future life.

versify became an important

THE BUILDING of the wall
came as a complete surprise to
everybody. Some of the border
crossing students happened to be
in West Berlin on that day, and
they decided not to return. The
University tried to support them
as much as possible, especially in
the first few days, when they
were left destitute away from
their homes.
Other students living in East
Berlin were forbidden to cross the
border any more; they also were
denied the chance to continue
their studies in East Germany
and were forced to work in fac
tories or on farms. More students
from West Germany and abroad
have taken their place. The idea
behind this is to bring every stu
dent from West Germany for one
semester to Berlin to experience
the Berlin situation. This, of
course, would go far beyond the
capacity of the Free University.
There are certain plans under
discussion to build an additional
university in West Berlin for this
purpose.
The Free University is to be
distinguished from West German
universities by its legal structure.
It has its own administrative
management and its own personal
sovereignty; it receives a lump
sum subsidy from the state. The
Free University was actually
founded by the students them
selves, and ever since, the stu
dents have had a strong voice in
all campus concerns. The student
representation consists of an
elected Parliament and an execu
tive power, which is split up into
departments of political, finan
cial, interior, and exterior con
cern. This government works
closely together with the univer
sity administration.
The students of the Free Uni
versity are very proud of the fact
that they have a seat and voice in
the faculties, the Senate and the
board of trustees. This achieve
ment is unique since in most
other universities, in Germany as
well as in other countries, the
students have no vote in admin
istrative matters.
This privilege which the stu
dents of the Free University have
is partly due to the special posi
tion and tasks of the university
and the active part the students
took in its founding and evolu
tion. Most students are quite
aware of the doubtful political
situation and take the chance to
share responsibilities in the stu
dent body organizations as an ex
perience for their future life.

University life and student affairs in West Berlin are closely
connected with the political situation. The old Berlin Humboldt Uni
versity, which was founded in 1810, is located in the Eastern part of
the city. Soon after the war was over, the communists occupied this

school and made it a center fc* +
their ideology and propaganda.
Every free expression of opin
ion was suppressed, and those
students who defended an inde
pendent and neutral position in
the student councils had to flee to
universities in West Germany. At

failed, the call for a new founding

expelled from the University. On
April 23, 1948, the campaign cul

meeting of the Berlin student
body in the British sector border
ing on the Soviet sector.
The students again demanded a
new free university and asked the
city authorities and the occupying
powers for support. This help was
gradually granted and in Octo

Free University was an estab

the old Berlin University signed
the lists for application.
In December, 1948, lectures be

still a lot of difficulties to over

campus existed at that time. The
lectures were hold in various

there was no furniture available;

everybody. Some of the border
crossing students happened to be
in West Berlin on that day, and
they decided not to return. The
University tried to support them
as much as possible, especially in
the first few days, when they
were left destitute away from
their homes.
Other students living in East
Berlin were forbidden to cross the
border any more; they also were
denied the chance to continue
their studies in East Germany
and were forced to work in fac
tories or on farms. More students
from West Germany and abroad
have taken their place. The idea
behind this is to bring every stu
dent from West Germany for one
semester to Berlin to experience
the Berlin situation. This, of
course, would go far beyond the
capacity of the Free University.
There are certain plans under
discussion to build an additional
university in West Berlin for this
purpose.
The Free University is to be
distinguished from West German
universities by its legal structure.
It has its own administrative
management and its own personal
sovereignty; it receives a lump
sum subsidy from the state. The
Free University was actually
founded by the students them
selves, and ever since, the stu
dents have had a strong voice in
all campus concerns. The student
representation consists of an
elected Parliament and an execu
tive power, which is split up into
departments of political, finan
cial, interior, and exterior con
cern. This government works
closely together with the univer
sity administration.
The students of the Free Uni
versity are very proud of the fact
that they have a seat and voice in
the faculties, the Senate and the
board of trustees. This achieve
ment is unique since in most
other universities, in Germany as
well as in other countries, the
students have no vote in admin
istrative matters.
This privilege which the stu
dents of the Free University have
is partly due to the special posi
tion and tasks of the university
and the active part the students
took in its founding and evolu
tion. Most students are quite
aware of the doubtful political
situation and take the chance to
share responsibilities in the stu
dent body organizations as an ex
perience for their future life.

University life and student affairs in West Berlin are closely
connected with the political situation. The old Berlin Humboldt Uni
versity, which was founded in 1810, is located in the Eastern part of
the city. Soon after the war was over, the communists occupied this

school and made it a center fc* +
their ideology and propaganda.
Every free expression of opin
ion was suppressed, and those
students who defended an inde
pendent and neutral position in
the student councils had to flee to
universities in West Germany. At
this time, when all efforts to es
tablish the basic rights of free
dom and justice in the old school
failed, the call for a new founding
of a free university in the West
ern sector of Berlin grew louder
and louder.
THE EDITORS of the student
magazine “Colloquium’ started a
campaign, calling for a new, in
dependent university, where the
Berlin students could study ac
cording to their own wishes. The
students who were involved in
this campaign were consequently
expelled from the University. On
April 23, 1948, the campaign cul
minated in an impressive protest
meeting of the Berlin student
body in the British sector border
ing on the Soviet sector.
The students again demanded a
new free university and asked the
city authorities and the occupying
powers for support. This help was
gradually granted and in Octo
ber, 1948, the formation of the
Free University was an estab
lished fact. More than 2,000 stu
dents who were still enrolled in
the old Berlin University signed
the lists for application.
In December, 1948, lectures be
gan. and the ceremonious inau
guration took place. There were
still a lot of difficulties to over
come. Nothing like a university
campus existed at that time. The
lectures were hold in various
buildings all over the town, and
there was no furniture available;
the students had to sit on chests
or bring their own chairs. The
teaching staff had to be com
pleted and a new library built out
of nothing.
NOWADAYS The Free Univer
sity is one of the best and largest
schools in Germany: There are
about 14.000 students, of which
the majority are residents of
West Berlin.
With the help of the Ford
Foundation and the West German
Government the buildings of the
various faculties and institutes
were erected. Most of these form
the main campus in the suburban
district of Dahlem, but a large
number of institutes and depart
ments still are spread all over
the city. The pressure of increas
ing student numbers and the in
creasingly specialized sciences
compelled the University to a
forced enlargement. A construc
tion plan was set up in 1960
which includes 52 new construc
tion projects for the next ten
years.
Since the founding of the uni
versity thousands of students
have completed their studies in
freedom. Before the erection of
the wall about 25 per cent came
from the East Zone of Germany,
either as refugees or still as resi
dents of East Berlin, crossing the
border every day. The Free Uni
er, consumption, creation, leisure
. . . ? More exactly, in what pro
portions do these complimentaiy
objectives have to be contained?
To answer this question, it is
necessary, according to the
French philosopher Gaston Bryer,
who created the recent “Prospec
tive Movement,” to “analyze in
depth, to take the long view, the
broad view, to think of man.”

bridge between both parts of Ger
many, and in many ways helped
to ease the material need and
spiritual isolation of students in
East Germany.
