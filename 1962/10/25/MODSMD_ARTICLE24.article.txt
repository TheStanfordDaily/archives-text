Editor, The Daily:
Your "Invade Cuba” editorial
has appalled me. For four weeks
I was under the impression that
the Daily editors were among the
more intelligent and liberal ele
ments on campus, only to be
rudely awakened by Tuesday’s
editorial. You did an excellent job
of exposing the fundamental as
sumption of our position in all its
absurdity—thal we are right and
they are wrong—and then pro
ceeded to embrace it. If you did
not see this absurdity, your po
sition could bo excused by igno
rance, but you saw it fully and
still accepted it.
Don’t you realize that every na
tion in history, from Rome to Hit
ler. has condoned its actions on
grounds of moral right? Haven’t
you ever learned that proceeding
on the assumption that you have
true knowledge or true goodness
will have the most dire conse
quences, ranging from prejudice
to Inquisition? Don't you see that
no intercourse among nations is
possible if each insists on its pos
sessing a monopoly on goodness?
However, Wednesday you shift
ed to a different tack. No longer
is it a matter of morality—now it
is a question of expediency. All
right, let us be expedient. Granted
that Soviet missiles in Cuba have
military potential, they represent
only an increase over Russia’s
present capacity to thoroughly
destroy us. Kennedy himself ac
knowledges this when he says
that even the victor (presumably
meaning us) will have ashes in
his mouth. Your statement that
Castro will now be in a position
to blackmail anyone makes the
thoroughly improbable assump
tion that Khrushchev will bo fool
ish enough to give Castro any
control whatever over the mis
siles. We have given no such con
trol even to Britain, and Khrush
chev knows as much about the
risks of accidental war as we do.
Your argument that if we are go
ing to invade Cuba we should do
it now is logically sound, but
makes the reprehensible assump
tion that we must invade Cuba
sooner or later. I see no more
necesity of this than of Russia’s
invading Turkey.
When the very existence of the
human race is hanging in a most
precarious balance, this is no time
for irrational patriotism and sa
ber-rattling. For God’s (and
man’s) sake, think of the conse
quences before screaming
“Fight”!

still accepted it.
Don’t you realize that every na
tion in history, from Rome to Hit
ler. has condoned its actions on
grounds of moral right? Haven’t
you ever learned that proceeding
on the assumption that you have
true knowledge or true goodness
will have the most dire conse
quences, ranging from prejudice
to Inquisition? Don't you see that
no intercourse among nations is
possible if each insists on its pos
sessing a monopoly on goodness?
However, Wednesday you shift
ed to a different tack. No longer
is it a matter of morality—now it
is a question of expediency. All
right, let us be expedient. Granted
that Soviet missiles in Cuba have
military potential, they represent
only an increase over Russia’s
present capacity to thoroughly
destroy us. Kennedy himself ac
knowledges this when he says
that even the victor (presumably
meaning us) will have ashes in
his mouth. Your statement that
Castro will now be in a position
to blackmail anyone makes the
thoroughly improbable assump
tion that Khrushchev will bo fool
ish enough to give Castro any
control whatever over the mis
siles. We have given no such con
trol even to Britain, and Khrush
chev knows as much about the
risks of accidental war as we do.
Your argument that if we are go
ing to invade Cuba we should do
it now is logically sound, but
makes the reprehensible assump
tion that we must invade Cuba
sooner or later. I see no more
necesity of this than of Russia’s
invading Turkey.
When the very existence of the
human race is hanging in a most
precarious balance, this is no time
for irrational patriotism and sa
ber-rattling. For God’s (and
man’s) sake, think of the conse
quences before screaming
“Fight”!

Editor, The Daily:
Your "Invade Cuba” editorial
has appalled me. For four weeks
I was under the impression that
the Daily editors were among the
more intelligent and liberal ele
ments on campus, only to be
rudely awakened by Tuesday’s
editorial. You did an excellent job
of exposing the fundamental as
sumption of our position in all its
absurdity—thal we are right and
they are wrong—and then pro
ceeded to embrace it. If you did
not see this absurdity, your po
sition could bo excused by igno
rance, but you saw it fully and
still accepted it.
