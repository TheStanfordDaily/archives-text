# ELECTIONS IN JUNE?
## Fate of Democracy in Peru In Hands of Military Junta 
### R. G. OFFUTT 
The Peruvian political attitude
can best be described as pessimis
tic. This pessimism is adequately
explained by the current state of
affairs, but its intensity is better
understood with a quick look at
Peru’s turbulent political history.
Until Manual Prado's election in
1956 Peru was traditionally ruled
by military dictatorships. If one
asked, “Who is the President to
day?”, the only possible answer
was, “Until yesterday Lopez,” or
Sanchez or whoever had occupied
the presidential palace the day
before. Commercial groups or ele
ments from the oligarchy occa
sionally appeared in the cabinets,
but the termination of a success
ful military career was always
seen in terms of political involve
ment at the executive level.
Prado was no “philosopher
king.” He did, however, try to
foster an understanding and ap
preciation for democracy. These
efforts did not prevent Ultra-
Conservatives from pigeonholing
needed reform bills. But the
voters took their cue from Pra
do’s assurances, and over 80 per
cent of those eligible cast a ballot
in the last elections. Aside from
the boisterous party rallies in
Lima, the election was unusually
calm in Peruvian terms. “El Vie
jito,” as Prado is called, had
brought Peru to a refreshing level
of civic culture.
WE ARE all familiar with the
episodes loading up to the mili
tary coup-d’etat on July 18. The
old APRA-military feud flared
anew, and this combined with a
good amount of demogoguery
among the candidates to bring
Peru’s experiment in democracy
to an abrupt end.
There were minor outbreaks of
violence, but an attempted nation
al strike by APRA failed. Pessi
mism and resignation already
guaranteed at least ephemeral
complacency to the Orwellian big
brother—the military junta. Some
muttered, “Oh well, we’ve seen it
all before” and by July the situ
ation was described as “normal.”
“Normal” in Peru, however,
means political stagnation and an
acute need for social legislation.
This need focuses on the indian
mestizo population, about 86 per
cent. A few mixed-bloods have
bridged the gap to the emergent

middle class but the two groups
still generally fall together in the
morass of social discontent.
THE PERUVIAN Indian lives
in exile in his own country. His
hopes are continually thwarted by
acute discrimination. Constitu
tionally ho Is an equal, but it
never quite works out that way
in practice. I realize that our own
South is not worthy of emulation
in this sense, but the comparison
here is not between Cuzco and
Mississippi. The Indian-Spanish
antagonism stems from the prej
udices of the conquest. It need
hardly be reiterated that the fa
bled “conquistadores,” after fall
ing on their knees, fell with equal
fervor on the Indians.
In the altiplano the “indio” is
virtually a beast of burden. These
descendants of the once-proud In
cas chew coca incessantly to
dampen the pains of a sub-human
status and stand bleary eyed wait
ing for some “criollo” to load them
to the breaking point. Then they
plod through the streets, almost
invisible under the huge load.
Living solely from what he can
cultivate in a few furrows at the
bleak 13,000-foot altitude, the In
dian’s average daily caloric in
take is about 1500. An American
housewife, the TV serial type,
averages 2200.
A TRUE 20th century serfdom
binds thousands of them to the
groat haciendas. While I was in
Cuzco in June, three of these cam
pesinos came into the local news
paper office: one without hands,
another with only one eye, and a
third with only one foot. These
deformities were not congenital,
but were all the result of beatings
received at the nearby “Estancia
Santa Rosa.” All victims were
under 21 years of age.
In the past six years more than
100 campesinos have been shot
and killed and scores injured by
the police. Their only crime was a
“protest occupation” of some re
mote corner of a hacienda—a pro
test against inhuman treatment.
The administrative agencies con
cerned defended their brutality
by shouting “Communist inspira
tion.” This is beginning to sound
paranoic. Even if the charge were
true, the alleged communists
would have been acting more hu
manely than those allegedly dem
ocratic politicians with whom the
Allianza works.
Revolt generally has a cause
and one need not look far to find
it here. The government archives
in Lima are full of bills and dust.
This dust fills the gap between
social legislation, in the rare
cases that it passes, and its im
plementation. The Indian pa
tience, contrary to popular belief,
also has a limit.

AGRARIAN REFORM? Per
haps, but Peru, like Bolivia, Is
blessed with 1and—496,233 square
miles. In some departments such
as Loreto the whole Italian penin
sula fits with ease. The virtually
unihabited lowlands east of the
Andes comprise almost one-half
of the land. In short, only 3 per
cent of Peru’s superficial area is
under cultivation, but over 60
per cent of the population is in
agriculture.
No drastic Cuban-style land re
form is necessary. The present in
justices would bo greatly reduced
by social legislation protecting
(he workers physically and finan
cially. The inequality in the land
distribution could be salved with
colonization projects. In San
Martin department and near Tin
go Maria such projects have been
quite successful, but they arc only
a scratch on the surface.
Educational reform? Improve
ment of transportation and com
munication? These and other so
cial ills have been the subject of
serious studies in Peru. But basic
to all is the lack of connection
and ensuing impossibility of com
munication between the two social
groups. The 12 per cent ruling
white minority arc preoccupied
with the newest theories on mili
tary seniority and presidential
succession. At the other extreme
the Mestizo-Indian population is
occupied only with getting enough
to eat. The legislators come large
ly from the former group, and the
members of (he latter group are
concerned with social legislation.
THE MILITARY junta has
promised elections in June of
1963. In the remaining seven
months these officers can either
obliviously wait or initiate a ba
sis for intelligent legislation in
the return to constitutionality.
Depending on their choice two
possibilities exist for Peru.
1. It will remain “normal” and
nothing will happen. The Castro
image, with or without Russian
missiles, will become stronger,
and the guerrilla bands will find
increased sympathy among the
campesinos. As a result General
Godoy will have to postpone the
elections indefinitely for reasons
of internal security.
2. The administrative cliques,
military and civil, will realize that
precisely those irate Indians
whom they called “communists”
are in reality Peruvians not
Peruvians of the Lima cafe soci
ety, but hungry and pessimistic
Peruvians of the altiplano and
the Amazon basin Peruvians,
whose ancestors had established
one of the highest degrees of so
cial integration known to history,
before their last chief was garrot
ed by an illiterate swines’ herd
named Pizarro.
