# NSA Congress Modifies Rules
## 
### TOM GREY Alternate Delegate, NSA CONGRESS 
At the 15lh annua] congress of
the National Student Association
this summer in Columbus, Ohio,
a number of changes were made
in the rules and procedures which
further fortified the organiza
tion’s almost obsessive concern
with democratic procedure.
First, a provision was made
that when a resolution is passed,
and at least 20 per cent of those
present and voting favor an op
posed or different resolution on
the same subject, the second reso
lution shall be adopted as a mi
nority report, and printed and cir
culated by the national office.

A second important procedural
change forbade the delegates to
the Congress to refer all legisla
tion which had not been voted on
to the National Executive Com
mittee for acceptance or defeat
by that body. Now an individual
motion, second, discussion, and
vote is required for each bill
which is referred to the Executive
Committee,
This measure came in answer
to criticism that too much NSA
legislation is never voted on by
the full Congress, but rather is
passed or defeated by the officers
of the various regions, who make
up the NEC.
In practice it turns out that be
cause of its unwieldy size, the full
Congress cannot possibly act on
all the necessary legislation each
year. The new rule enables the
delegates as a group to select
those individual pieces of pro
posed legislation which they deem
worthy of consideration, even
though they did not have time to
vote on them. Those considered
unimportant, or too controversial
to be decided upon by any group
but the Congress itself, are al
lowed to die on the table.

A long standing implicit policy
of NSA was made explicit, with
the purpose in mind of clearing
up some misunderstandings about
the association. It was made part
of the constitution of NSA that
no member school is in any way
bound by any policy declaration
or resolution of the association.
Such policy declarations and reso
lutions represent only the opinion
of the majority of members, and
those in the minority are obvious
ly free to disagree with or oppose
them.
All this constitutional reform
was the result of political action
on the part of students, most of
them conservatives, who had
come to believe that the NSA was
here to stay, that it was a worth
while forum of student opinion
and framework for student serv
ice and action, and that if there
were things about it they didn’t
like, all they had to do was
i change them.
