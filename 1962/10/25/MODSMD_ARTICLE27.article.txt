# Stanford Frosh Athletes Possibly Best in School's History
## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
This year’s group of freshman
athletes is possibly the best in
Stanford history. The group is
led by a towering All-American
basketball player, and includes the
all-time high school discus cham
pion, and one of the nation’s out
standing high school milers.
The basketball player is center
Ray Kosanke, who at 6-9, 228 lbs,
was the largest player to be
named to the high school All-
American team last year. Kosan
ke has a remarkably light touch
for such a big man, hitting with
soft jumpers and hooks from as
far as 25 feet. His height, weight,
and spring make him a powerful
rebounder, and, since he also pos
esses remarkable speed, he is the
ideal big man around whom to
build an offense.
Kosanke averaged 25 points a
game during his senior year in

Tucson, Arizona, and led his team
to the state championship. He
was elected captain of the all-city
team, captain of the all stale team
and the most valuable player in
the state all-star game.
IN THE FORECOURT with Ko
sanke will be another high school
All American, Bob Bedell from
Los Angeles. Bedell at 6-7, 185
pounds, is at a disadvantage under
the boards, but, his speed and agil
ity more than compensate for his
lack of muscle.
During his junior and senior
years, Bedell averaged 27 points;
he was named the All-CIF player
of the year after his final season.
AN OUTSTANDING break
away runner on the Stanford
freshman football team is shifty
Ray Handley from Reno High
School. Although he is not blind
ingly fast, Handley is a powerful
runner with exceptional running
balance who can cut while going
nearly full speed.
In his first game for Stanford,
he broke loose for a game-win
ning, 85 yard touchdown run. This
was the longest touchdown run of
Handley’s career, although in high
school he reeled off scoring
sprints of 79, 61, and 55 yards.
In the same backfield with
Handley is Bob Sloecker, both an
outstanding fullback and Stan
ford’s greatest prospect ever in the
discus throw. He holds the all
time high school discus record
record with a heave of 195-4
A versatile performer, Stoecker
plans to compete in the decathon
as well as in other track events,
and in football.
In addition to breaking the dis
cus record, Stoecker has run the
high hurdles in 14.6 and put the
shot 59’ 11”. For two years he
was named to the All-American
high school track squad.
THE STANFORD freshman
baseball team will also have out
standing performers, among them
pitchers Gil Hopper and Terry
Docken and catcher Jimmy Hibbs.
Hopper is a 6-2, righthander. He
has a well developed repetoire of
pitches although the fast ball is
his best. He had a 16-1 record over
his junior and senior years in
Park Forest, Illinois. During the
latter year, he had a 1.000 ERA,
gave up one walk, and struck out
13 per game.
TERRY DOUKEN the other out
standing pitcher on the squad is
not as big or as fast as Hopper,
but be is just as effective. Docken
moves the ball around, mixing a
sneaky fastball with a great curve.
In high school he compiled a won
and lost mark of 13-1, while being
named twice to the all-city team
and selected twice as player of the
year in his league. During his
senior year he struck out 70 bat
ters in 50 innings.
Jimmy Hibbs from Los Angeles
will catch these two pitchers.

Hibbs is an outstanding defensive
catcher with a fine aim. Offen
sively, he is a line drive hitter,
who has never batted less than
.300 in high school.
Last summer Hibbs hit .373 for
the Dodger Rookies, an amateur
team sponsored by the L.A. Dodg
ers.
THE FRESHMAN track team
has one of last year’s greatest

high school milers in Dick Deub
ner.
LAST YEAR Deubner ran the
two mile in 9:15.9, the best time
ever recorded by a high school
athlete. He also broke a 50-year
old Oregon record by turning a
1:53.6 in the quarter mile. In ad
dition he was the Oregon state
champion in the mile with a time
of 4:11.2.
Stoecker and Deubner are not

(he only stars in the freshman
track team. Coach Payton Jordan
says that George Porter from
Shreveport, Louisiana, will he the
greatest javelin thrower in the
history of the university. Last
year he broke his state high school
javelin mark with a throw of 216
feet. The son of a former Golden
Gloves welter-weight boxing
champion, Porter was all-state in
track for two years.
