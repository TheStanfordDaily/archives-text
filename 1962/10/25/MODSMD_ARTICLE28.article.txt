## Cards Drub CCSF As Griffith Doubles 
### GERALD FRY 
Stanford’s soccer team upset
powerful City College of San
Francisco yesterday 3-1. CCSF
had come into the game undefeat
ed and untied.
It was a big victory for the
Tribe, who had lost 4-1 to CCSF
in their first league encounter,
despite playing them off the field
in the last three quarters.
CCSF HELD STANFORD to a
1-1 tie at the half, but Stanford
erupted for two goals in the sec
ond half to win. Sophomore for
wards Don Griffith and Stu Rawl
ings, and soph goalie Kent Muel
ler, led Stanford.
Griffith scored twice, and Rawl
ings once, to account for all the
goal-making. Mueller, one of Stan
ford’s two fine goalies, played an
outstanding game, coming up with
some beautiful saves. Tom Paul

son, the other goalie, and another
soph, also turned in an outstand
ing game.
Coach Priddle was extremely
pleased with the team’s showing,
and lauded the fine defensive
work by the aforementioned Muel
ler and Paulson, plus backs Bill
Teusch, Jim Armstrong, Don
Burr, Sandy Pofahl and Rich Lon
ergan which limited the San Fran
ciscans to one goal.
