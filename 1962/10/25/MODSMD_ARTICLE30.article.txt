# T-Formation Bruins Will Host Cards in Los Angeles
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
UCLA, the surprise of the
AAWU football season, will host
Stanford Saturday in the Cards’
third league football game.

The Bruins have won two and
lost one, but the real story is that
they defeated Ohio State, which
had been everyone’s choice as the
best in the U.S. Their other win

I was a 35-T slaughter of Colorado
| State. The score might have
mounted to the ridiculous if the
Bruins hadn’t suffered a letdown
following their all-out effort the
week before.
UCLA’s loss came last week to
a good Pittsburgh team 8-6.
THIS YEAR’S version of UCLA
is different from any in the
school’s history, for this is the
I first time the Bruins have ever
! used the T-formation. Coach Bill
Barnes abandoned the single-wing
I at the insistence of the school’s
[alumni, and because of the diffi
[ culty of obtaining players to fit
the formation.
! Tailbacks like Bill Kilmer and
I other recent UCLA greats don’t
j grow on trees. Perhaps the lack
I of an able tailback was another
j factor in Barnes’ decision. Mike
Haffner, second-string tailback
and the most prolific soph ground
gainer in Bruin history, was a re
turnee, but he was a better runner
than a passer.
On the other hand, Barnes had
[ available Ezell Singleton, a good
I passer but mediocre ball-toter, and
j soph Larry Zeno, likewise.
THE DECISION to revert to the
T has borne fruit. The first “T”
| play the Bruins used this year,
i Kermit Alexander rambled 45
I yards for a touchdown behind per
i feet blocking. Zeno marched ihc
| Bruins down for a field goal late
in the game to clinch for UCLA
II what everyone had rated a sure
! win for Ohio State.
j The win over Colorado State
1 j speaks for itself, and though the
;! Bruins lost to Pitt, Barnes called
I it the best game his boys played
. this year.
[ Alexander’s running and defen-
I sive play have been the brightest
i star in the UCLA sky to date, but
[ Zeno’s passing and field goal kick
ing, and the line play of captain
and center Andy Von Sonn <211),
| end Mel Profit (2151, guard Joe
| Bauwens (225), and tackle Phil
i Oram (221), also loom large ob
j stacles for Stanford to overcome.
A disappointment has been
, Haffner. A bad knee forced him
to the sidelines for the season,
j The leading ball-carrier in the
AAWU last year has been touted
j as an All-Coast candidate, along
I with Alexander, Von Sonn and
j Profit.
RUGGED LINE play, and out
| standing work in the defensive
backfield have characterized the
: UCLA defense. The Bruins have
| allowed only one touchdown in
each of their three games,
j On the other hand, Stanford has
j scored only four times in an equal
number of games. The lack of
; Stanford touchdown production
bodes ill for the Stanford chances
Saturday.


KERMIT ALEXANDER is UCLA's top rusher, as well as best defensive
back. The shifty Alexander ran 45 yards against Ohio State the
first time he carried the ball this year.
