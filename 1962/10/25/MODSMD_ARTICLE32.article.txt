Hero’s Ihis week’s lesson in rationalizing a football loss away.
Last Saturday, Stanford was blanked by Washington, 14-0, but des
pite the impotence indicated by the Indians’ score, they unveiled a
passing game that harked back to the Stanford teams of the past
decade, directed by quarterbacks Brodie, Norman, and Garrett among
other All-Americans.
In witnessing their third straight disappointment, Indian fans
also saw the Tribe’s most exciting and consistent offensive produc
tion (outside the ten yard line, that is I of 1962. mainly due to an
accelerated passing attack. Stanford quarterbacks completed ten
of 20 passes, a respectable 50 percent, compared to 40 percent in pre
vious games. Those ten completions were good for 140 yards, 60
yards more than the per-game average prior to Saturday.
But even more impressive than the statistics was the method of
operation of the offense. When obvious passing situations occurod,
quarterbacks Thurlow and Weaver dropped back with poise and
confidence and hit their receivers with refreshing accuracy.
THURLOW TO JESSEN FOR A FIRST DOWN
The most impressive instance of Stanford newly matured pass
ing might occured in the second quarter and was a key play in a
58 yard, near-scoring drive. With fourth down and 11 yards to go
on Washington’s 30, Stanford de-

cided to test the reliability of the
passing game in a crucial situa
tion by trying for the first down
instead of the field goal. Thurlow
called for an up-and-in pattern to
flanker Chris Jessen and hit him
with a 19 yard streak at the 11.
After the game, Coach Jack
Curtice, although unenthusiastlc
about the outcome, was pleased
with the arrival of the passing
game. “We really pick them apart.
Both those boys (Thurlow and
Weaver) had a lot of poise and
waited to fine the open receiver.”
STANFORD PASSERS MATURE
Although it was overdue, the
arrival has been expected since

i the beginning of the season. Cur
lice has always been noted for his advocacy of the forward pass and
Stanford has featured great passing quarterbacks for the last ten
years. Although Thurlow and Weaver have never been rated with
outstanding quarterbacks of the past, they were always considered
more than adequate.
With the lack of varsity experience, however, (Thurlow came
down with mononucleosis after five games last year and Weaver
hadn’t played since his freshman year at Colorado in I960), it took
them four games to come around (assuming they have come around
now).
Besides the maturation of Thurlow and Weaver, a couple of for
mation and personnel changes were also responsible for the Tribe’s
t improved passing. For the first time this year, Curtice flanked a
j halfback, to be used as a pass re-

ceiver; he also lined the right end
up tight. Previously, the right
halfback had been slotted (be
tween tackle and end) and used
primarily as a blocker. The new
formation allows Frank Patitucci.

end, who is notoriously lax on
blocking and defense, but notably
accomplished at pass catching. He
responded beautifully by catching
three of the four passes thrown
within his amazing teach, ac
counting for 57 yards.

’.lessen is now firmly settled in
Curtice’s offense and that Cur

for one thing: a dislocated finger

Hero’s Ihis week’s lesson in rationalizing a football loss away.
Last Saturday, Stanford was blanked by Washington, 14-0, but des
pite the impotence indicated by the Indians’ score, they unveiled a
passing game that harked back to the Stanford teams of the past
decade, directed by quarterbacks Brodie, Norman, and Garrett among
other All-Americans.
In witnessing their third straight disappointment, Indian fans
also saw the Tribe’s most exciting and consistent offensive produc
tion (outside the ten yard line, that is I of 1962. mainly due to an
accelerated passing attack. Stanford quarterbacks completed ten
of 20 passes, a respectable 50 percent, compared to 40 percent in pre
vious games. Those ten completions were good for 140 yards, 60
yards more than the per-game average prior to Saturday.
But even more impressive than the statistics was the method of
operation of the offense. When obvious passing situations occurod,
quarterbacks Thurlow and Weaver dropped back with poise and
confidence and hit their receivers with refreshing accuracy.
THURLOW TO JESSEN FOR A FIRST DOWN
The most impressive instance of Stanford newly matured pass
ing might occured in the second quarter and was a key play in a
58 yard, near-scoring drive. With fourth down and 11 yards to go
on Washington’s 30, Stanford de-

cided to test the reliability of the
passing game in a crucial situa
tion by trying for the first down
instead of the field goal. Thurlow
called for an up-and-in pattern to
flanker Chris Jessen and hit him
with a 19 yard streak at the 11.
After the game, Coach Jack
Curtice, although unenthusiastlc
about the outcome, was pleased
with the arrival of the passing
game. “We really pick them apart.
Both those boys (Thurlow and
Weaver) had a lot of poise and
waited to fine the open receiver.”

Although it was overdue, the
arrival has been expected since

Stanford has featured great passing quarterbacks for the last ten
