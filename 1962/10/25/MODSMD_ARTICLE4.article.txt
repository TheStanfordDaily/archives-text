## 
### 
A number of Stanford students
engaged in a spontaneous pro
test against President Kennedy's
Cuban blockade yesterday on the
patio at Tresidder Union. The
protest began at 12:15 p.m. With
in an hour 150 to 200 students
were standing on table tops, flow
er pots, and the balcony to hear
speeches by Saul Landau, Peter
Eisenberg, and Allen Young, said
KZSU reporter Ken Byram.
Landau first gave a warning of
the dangers of nuclear war, and
stated that those in favor of war
wanted to die, Byram reported.
Eisenberg then staled that the
U.S. activities demonstrated “new
acts of belligerency against Cu
ba.” He recited the high spots in
the history of American-Cuban
relations beginning in January
and February of 1959, when the
U.S. misunderstood and miscon
strued Castro’s trials of Batista’s
murderers.
EISENBERG used as examples
the cutting off of the sugar trade
and oil in June 1960 and the U.S.
support of the Bay of Pigs inva
sion to illustrate the error in
policy of what Eisenberg termed
the professed “moral” U.S. gov
ernment.
A new invasion, which is being
discussed in Washington, would
he disastrous for U.S. foreign
policy, the Marines, Cubans, and
even the rest of the world, said
Eisenberg.
During his speech Eisenberg
encouraged all students to think
about the importance of the pres
ent situation. He suggested that
they then act and express their
opinions by writing to Congress
men and to newspapers.
YOUNG ENFORCED the opin
ions of the preceding speakers
with a moderate statement that
the blockade violated the morali
ty on which U.S. policy should be
based, Byram said.
The formal protestation ended
at 1:30 p.m., with no official ob
jections. However, small groups
continued on the subject for
much of the afternoon at the
Union.

with a moderate statement that
the blockade violated the morali
ty on which U.S. policy should be
based, Byram said.
The formal protestation ended
at 1:30 p.m., with no official ob
jections. However, small groups
continued on the subject for
much of the afternoon at the
Union.
A number of Stanford students
engaged in a spontaneous pro
test against President Kennedy's
Cuban blockade yesterday on the
patio at Tresidder Union. The
protest began at 12:15 p.m. With
in an hour 150 to 200 students
were standing on table tops, flow
er pots, and the balcony to hear
speeches by Saul Landau, Peter
Eisenberg, and Allen Young, said
KZSU reporter Ken Byram.
Landau first gave a warning of
the dangers of nuclear war, and
stated that those in favor of war
wanted to die, Byram reported.
Eisenberg then staled that the
U.S. activities demonstrated “new
acts of belligerency against Cu
ba.” He recited the high spots in
the history of American-Cuban
relations beginning in January
and February of 1959, when the
U.S. misunderstood and miscon
strued Castro’s trials of Batista’s
murderers.
EISENBERG used as examples
the cutting off of the sugar trade
and oil in June 1960 and the U.S.
support of the Bay of Pigs inva
sion to illustrate the error in
policy of what Eisenberg termed
the professed “moral” U.S. gov
ernment.
A new invasion, which is being
discussed in Washington, would
he disastrous for U.S. foreign
policy, the Marines, Cubans, and
even the rest of the world, said
Eisenberg.
During his speech Eisenberg
encouraged all students to think
about the importance of the pres
ent situation. He suggested that
they then act and express their
opinions by writing to Congress
men and to newspapers.
YOUNG ENFORCED the opin
ions of the preceding speakers
with a moderate statement that
the blockade violated the morali
ty on which U.S. policy should be
based, Byram said.
The formal protestation ended
at 1:30 p.m., with no official ob
jections. However, small groups
continued on the subject for
