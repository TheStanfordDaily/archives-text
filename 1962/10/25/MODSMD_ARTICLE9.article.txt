# Lecturer Finds Chinese Restive Under Peiping
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
“There is quite a bitter feeling
among Chinese under the Com
munist regime,” according to Dr.
M. J. Moijer, research professor
at the University of Washington,
in a question-and-answer period
following his travelog speech en
titled “A Visit to Communist
China,” yesterday in Tresidder
Union,
Meijer served on the staff of
The Netherlands embassy in Pei
ping from 1955 to 1958 and revisit
ed the mainland in 1961. He con
trasted the “friendliness” of the
people toward foreigners in 1958
to the "definite hostility” which
he encountered in his 1961 trip.
He concluded that their animosity
seemed to be aroused by the
sight of a “well-fed and well
dressed" foreigner.
HE ADDED, however, that the
feeling against Communism
which he termed as “running
high,” would very probably not
have rebellious overtones because
the Communists had too tight a
grip on (ho government and the
people were not enthused by the
alternative rule of Chiang Kai-
Chek.
When queried about the conflict
between India and China, Meijer
said he "just did not know” why
the Communists started the fight
or how they proposed to end it.
He rejected the popular theory
that the Communist leaders are
trying to keep the peasants con
centrating on fighting rather than
eating since there is a famine in
China.
THE SPEAKER called this ex
planation “hackneyed” and “fa
cile." He also rebutted the argu
ment that the Chinese are inter
ested in expanding to gain food
producing areas, “Certainly, the
annexation of the Himalayas
would adfl little to the Chinese
grain supply,” ho said.
Meijer also noted that he saw
"no Russians at all” on his last
trip and that the Communists
talked to refused to discuss the
Si no-Soviet rift or even answer
questions about it.
The speech itself was an ex
planation of random color slides
that Meijer took when he was in
China. He used them to contrast
the clean and modern look of
Peiping to the bleakness of the
countryside and to show the
transformation of Shanghai from
a bustling international port to a
“relatively quiet” city.

“There is quite a bitter feeling
among Chinese under the Com
munist regime,” according to Dr.
M. J. Moijer, research professor
at the University of Washington,
in a question-and-answer period
following his travelog speech en
titled “A Visit to Communist
China,” yesterday in Tresidder
Union,
Meijer served on the staff of
The Netherlands embassy in Pei
ping from 1955 to 1958 and revisit
ed the mainland in 1961. He con
trasted the “friendliness” of the
people toward foreigners in 1958
to the "definite hostility” which
he encountered in his 1961 trip.
He concluded that their animosity
seemed to be aroused by the
sight of a “well-fed and well
dressed" foreigner.
HE ADDED, however, that the
feeling against Communism
which he termed as “running
high,” would very probably not
have rebellious overtones because
the Communists had too tight a
grip on (ho government and the
people were not enthused by the
alternative rule of Chiang Kai-
Chek.
When queried about the conflict
between India and China, Meijer
said he "just did not know” why
the Communists started the fight
or how they proposed to end it.
He rejected the popular theory
that the Communist leaders are
trying to keep the peasants con
centrating on fighting rather than
eating since there is a famine in
China.
THE SPEAKER called this ex
planation “hackneyed” and “fa
cile." He also rebutted the argu
ment that the Chinese are inter
ested in expanding to gain food
producing areas, “Certainly, the
annexation of the Himalayas
would adfl little to the Chinese
grain supply,” ho said.
Meijer also noted that he saw
"no Russians at all” on his last
trip and that the Communists
talked to refused to discuss the
Si no-Soviet rift or even answer
questions about it.
The speech itself was an ex
planation of random color slides
that Meijer took when he was in
China. He used them to contrast
the clean and modern look of
Peiping to the bleakness of the
countryside and to show the
transformation of Shanghai from
a bustling international port to a
“relatively quiet” city.
