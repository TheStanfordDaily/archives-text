FOR ONE-STOP SHOPPING IN 63
ITS EXCITING!
This is about the best thing that’s happened to buying cars since
Chevrolet started building them— four entirely different kinds of
cars to choose from at your Chevrolet dealer’s One-Stop Shopping
Center. If you’re a luxury-lover, you'll probably want to go no further
than those 13 plush new Jet-smooth ’63 Chevrolet. Want to give your
budget an even bigger break? Step over and see what’s new with those
10 nifty models of the '63 Chevy 11. Or maybe you’ve been eyeing
sports-car caps, in which case have a go at a sporty new ’63 Corvair
(8 of them, including three snazzy bucket-seat Monzas and those big
Greenbrier Sports Wagons). There’s even something for the all-out
sports-car set-the daring Corvette Sting Ray. Picking a new car has
never been easier. (Unless you’d like to own them all!)
