# Professors to Analyze Cold War Developments
## 
### 
The Cuban crisis and its rela
tion to other major international
problems between the Soviets and
the West will be analyzed today
by three Stanford professors in a
panel discussion at 4:15 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
Speaking will be political science
professors Jan Trlska and Robert
North and history professor John
Johnson. Robert Horn, professor j
of political science, will moderate i
l he panel discussion, co-sponsored
by the Political Union and the HR. |
HORN SAID he expected Tris
ka, an expert in Soviet politics, to
concentrate on possible Russian j
reactions that may develop from}
the U.S. quarantine on Cuba.
Triska will draw his conclusions
from past patterns of action by
the Soviets, Horn said.
“Triska has degrees in both I
political science and law and is S
something of an expert in inter-1
national law questions,” Horn |
asserted.
Noi'th was in Washington, D.C., j
and Florida while the Cuban crisis j
developed and interviewed many j
prominent Cuban exiles, Horn
said. North reported he would j
discuss the implications of the |
interviews.
NORTH WILL also outline the
“appalling alternatives forced on |
our government" by the crisis— !
alternatives that he learned of j
while in Washington, Horn said.
Johnson, a specialist in Latin j
American afairs, will give atten-1
tion to the impact of the crisis on
the free nations of Central and
South America.
The discussion will be the first
in a number of presentations by
political experts co-sponsored by j
HR and Political Union. Questions
may he directed from the floor to j
any of the three speakers after

Ihe panel discussion.
HORN EMPHASIZED that the
world situation is still critical des
pite an apparently mild reaction
by the Soviets to the quarantine
declared by President Kennedy.
At first “people became very
excited,” Horn said. “But there
has been a let-down. The Ameri
can people think, ‘oh, well, now
it’s all right.’ But the danger is
by no means over.
“Most people speak of this prob
lem as the ‘Cuban crisis’,” Horn
said. “But the Cuban aspect is in
many respects not the most im
portant.” Much very much of
the problem lies in Berlin, not
Havana, he said.
As moderator, Horn said he
would try to direct part of the
discussion to exploring tlie Berlin
and Sino-Indian aspects of the
world crisis.
