## Arms Shipment Stop Offered By Russians 
### 
MOSCOW (UPl)—Premier Ni
kita S. Khrushchev last night of
fered to suspend Soviet arms
shipments to Cuba for a two to
three week period if the United
States lifts its blockade during
that lime.

Khrushchov accepted the pro
posal of United Nations Acting
Secretary General Thant in a
message made public by the offi
cial Tass news agency.
THE UNITED STATES accept
ed Thant’s appeal for talks aimed
at ending the crisis but did not
say whether it would accept his
proposal on the suspension of
the Soviet arms shipments and
the U.S. blockade for a cooling
off period.
“I welcome your initiative,”
Khrushchev told Thant. “I under
stand your anxiety in connection
with the situation which has de
veloped in the area of the Carib
bean Sea, as the Soviet govern
ment, too, considers this situation
to be a very dangerous one, de
manding an immediate interven
tion by the United Nations.
Western observers in Moscow
pointed out the Khrushchev’s call
for U.N. intervention was not
spelled out in detail and could
range from a U.N. debate on the
solution to the use of U.N. ob
servers or troops to enforce com
pliance with the agreement.

THANT SENT notes to Khrush
chev and President Kennedy
Wednesday night appealing for a
cooling-off period. Ho also asked
Cuban President Osvaldo Dorti
cos to stop construction of major
military facilities for a period of
three weeks.

Earlier yesterday U.S. forces
allowed a Soviet oil tanker to
pass through the Cuban blockade
without incident but the Defense
Department said that other Rus
sian ships are on the way and
will have to be stopped and
searched.
