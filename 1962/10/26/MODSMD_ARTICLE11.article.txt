The Institute of International
Relations and the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University
clashed yesterday over office fa
cilities for the Latin American
Desk of 1.1. R., headed by Charles
Kendall. According to Kendall,
“Our activities are at a standstill
until we receive the necessary fa
cilities.”
The conflict came to a head
when Latin American Desk mem
bers moved a desk from the old
1.1. R. shack to the new loft. Fred
Nelson, student financial man
ager, insisted that the desk be re
turned, saying “1.1. R. is circum
venting A.S.S.U.”
BESIDES the circumvention,
Nelson opposed the 1.1. R. action
because, “We did provide area
which has never been used to ca
pacity.”
Jim Clause, affiliations vice
president of 1.1. R., answered,
“Available space is not enough
to accommodate the one hundred
members we have working from
12 to 6 p.m.”
Nelson stated, however. “There
are three tables downstairs in the
A.S.S.U. offices for overflow, and
also at no time have all meeting
rooms been used; these would
provide for overflow.” Nelson
continued, “Productiveness of an
organization certainly doesn’t de
pend on whether its desks are up
stairs or down. There is no rela
tionship between the level of ac
tivities and the desk space.”
CONTINUING, Nelson said,
“The ASSU is to spend $30,000
furnishing the new offices; we
have already committed $26,000
now. There are other organiza
tions, too.”
Kendall agreed that there are
many other clubs, but ho added,
“No one can argue that foreign
students haven’t become more im
portant.”
“One out of ten students at
Stanford," Clause injected, “is a
foreign student. They are the
most talented and gifted from
their countries. It’s time we start
looking to make a neighbor. Fred
must realize it's no longer 1948
(when HR was formed) but 1962.
We can’t be stopped by lack of
facilities.”
NELSON AGREED, “1.1. R.
does more work and work on a
higher level than other organiza
tions.” Continuing, he said, “I
made an offer based on compro
mise.” The 1.1. R. said it wasn’t
sufficient.

(when HR was formed) but 1962.
We can’t be stopped by lack of
facilities.”
NELSON AGREED, “1.1. R.
does more work and work on a
higher level than other organiza
tions.” Continuing, he said, “I
made an offer based on compro
mise.” The 1.1. R. said it wasn’t
sufficient.
The Institute of International
Relations and the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University
clashed yesterday over office fa
cilities for the Latin American
Desk of 1.1. R., headed by Charles
Kendall. According to Kendall,
“Our activities are at a standstill
until we receive the necessary fa
cilities.”
The conflict came to a head
when Latin American Desk mem
bers moved a desk from the old
1.1. R. shack to the new loft. Fred
Nelson, student financial man
ager, insisted that the desk be re
turned, saying “1.1. R. is circum
venting A.S.S.U.”
BESIDES the circumvention,
Nelson opposed the 1.1. R. action
because, “We did provide area
which has never been used to ca
pacity.”
Jim Clause, affiliations vice
president of 1.1. R., answered,
“Available space is not enough
to accommodate the one hundred
members we have working from
12 to 6 p.m.”
Nelson stated, however. “There
are three tables downstairs in the
A.S.S.U. offices for overflow, and
also at no time have all meeting
rooms been used; these would
provide for overflow.” Nelson
continued, “Productiveness of an
organization certainly doesn’t de
pend on whether its desks are up
stairs or down. There is no rela
tionship between the level of ac
tivities and the desk space.”
CONTINUING, Nelson said,
“The ASSU is to spend $30,000
furnishing the new offices; we
have already committed $26,000
now. There are other organiza
tions, too.”
Kendall agreed that there are
many other clubs, but ho added,
“No one can argue that foreign
students haven’t become more im
portant.”
“One out of ten students at
Stanford," Clause injected, “is a
foreign student. They are the
most talented and gifted from
their countries. It’s time we start
looking to make a neighbor. Fred
must realize it's no longer 1948
(when HR was formed) but 1962.
