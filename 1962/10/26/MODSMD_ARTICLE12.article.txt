### CARRIE BRAND 
“I wholeheartedly like and sup
port the American action in the
Cuban situation,” said Professor
Jan Triska in an informal discus
sion last night in the Junipero
lounge.
Triska, an authority on Soviet
foreign policy and a member of
Stanford’s Political Science De
partment, was the first in a series
of Thursday night speakers pre
sented by the Political Union.
Triska expressed the view that
the crisis was essentially over and
the next few days will be a “mop
ping up procedure.” He feels that
the United States’ stand has great
ly promoted her prestige, since it
is the first time that America has
taken the initiative and Russia is
merely reacting.
It is probable, Triska asserted,
that the shipping of offensive mis
siles to Cuba did not even involve
a major policy decision, but was
merely a variation of the types
of missiles already being trans
ported.
In this case, Khrushchev’s de
layed response may be an indica
tion of his surprize at America’s
firm opposition. “Khrushchev’s re
sponse may be an indication of
his surprise at America’s first op
position. “Khrushchev’s response
when it did come was exactly
what we in the Political Science
Department expecteu,” he contin
ued. Khrushchev is in a very weak
position and is backing down be
cause the facts are against him.
Already official Russian state
ments are disclaiming any offen
sive intentions against the United
States.
The return of several Soviet
ships proves the initial success of
the American quarantine, and the
maintenance of the blockade is
no longer a major part of the
issue.
