# Men's Council

Tlie announcement by Men’s Council that drunkenness will he
prosecuted as a violation of the Fundamental Standard confuses
rather than clarifies the* jurisdiction of student judicial bodies.
In the past, liquor violations have been explicitly divorced from
violations of the Fundamental Standard because the Fundamental
Standard Commission understood that if a liquor violation were a
violation of the Fundamental Standard, respect for the Standard
would disappear. And since the Fundamental Standard is closely
linked with the Honor system, anything that tends to discredit the
one discredits the other. Therefore, it is unwise to link liquor with
the standards of integrity and honesty embodied in the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code.
Men’s Council has stated that the condition of intoxication per
se is subject to disciplinary action. The student who has not drunk
on campus but who has had a few off campus and who has then
returned to campus is liable to be prosecuted. Such jurisdiction
goes beyond what should be the concern of Men’s Council: dis
orderly conduct that may or may not result from offenders’ being
intoxicated, and violation of the prohibition against on-campus
consumption of liquor.
Men’s Council asserts that it is not especially interested in pros
ecuting students who are intoxicated but not engaged in disorderly
conduct. If this is so, why has the Council announced it considers
intoxication a Fundamental Standard violation that is subject to
prosecution?
