## Cuba Invasion Would Be Naked US. Imperialism 
### JOHN HARPER 
I am in complete accord with
the student poll which over
whelmingly voted against an in
vasion of Cuba. Moreover, I
gravely question the wisdom of
the blockade itself.
No slogans of democracy, na
tional security and the like can
obscure the fact that an invasion
of Cuba would be naked imperial
ism. The same imperialism we
protested in Hungary, Algeria,
Angola, and Tibet, and are now
protesting in India.
Perhaps the Cuban Revolution
has been betrayed. But it was not
a totalitarian elite—but the Cu
ban masses—who in 1958 effected
the downfall of the old regime, a
regime that cannot be dissociated
from U.S. capital and govern
ment. It is for the Cuban people
—not U.S. regulars or C.1.A.-
sponsored armed exiles—to de
cide the future of their nation.
Only if the Cuban people ask for
U.S. aid—as the Hungarian work
ers begged for Western interven
tion in 1956—d0 we, a democratic
state, have justification to in
vade.
Furthermore, I consider Ken
nedy’s unprecedented peacetime
blockade of an independent na
tion completely unwarranted. I
cannot be lured into the fantastic
assumption that Cuba threatens
an immediate attack on the U.S.
or its allies or represents a base
more dangerous to the U.S. than
Turkey and West Germany are to
Russia.
Those circled maps in recent
issues of the newspapers might
lead some to believe that the U.S.
was hitherto not a target area.
This is fallacious. Innumerable
ICBM’s on Russian and Eastern
European soil are now aimed at,
all major centers of the U.S. and
its allies, and the Russian nuclear

armed submarine fleet off our
coast is presumably not decreas
ing. As to the cries that there
is an insufficient warning sys
tem to the South and that the
proximity of missiles might not
give us enough warning to launch
a counterattack, I counter that
the Defense Department is quite
capable of hastily constructing an
efficient warning system and
that submarines can approach
closer than Cuba’s 90 miles.
I do not advocate the installa
tion of missiles in Cuba or any
where. But missiles in Cuba do
not in the least alter the com
plexion of the present “balance
of terror.” The Caribbean is not
a U.S. lake as many since Teddy
Roosevelt would lead us to be
lieve. I consider the U.S.’s devia
tion from its historic policy of
freedom of the seas in peacetime
to have been provoked by differ
ent motives.

Since Castro confiscated U.S.
capital in 1958, there has been
constant agitation for invasion of
Cuba, even before we were con
vinced that Castro’s regime was
communist. And, although I ad
vocate the overthrow of any un
democratic regime, I cannot but
view the U.S.'s hopeful interven
tion in Cuba—now or before—as
anything other than to reclaim
that capital and to quiet a hostile
voice in the Western hemisphere.

The conservative forces in our
country have so effectively agi
tated on this point that they now
have considerable force.

Many Republican candidates
have exploited the Cuban issue as
their major campaign issue. I be
lieve that Kennedy’s declaration
—perhaps understandable—is ap
peasement to the war-hungry vo
cal minority and a high-priced
gamble to attain a true New
Frontier majority in Congress.
