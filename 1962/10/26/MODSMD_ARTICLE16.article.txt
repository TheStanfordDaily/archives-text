Editor, The Daily:
Concerning the article in The
Daily on Dr. M. J. Meijer's recent
talk, I would like to take excep
tion to Dr. Meijer’s rebuttal of
the argument that the Red Chi
nese are interested in gaining
food-producing areas.
The control of food-producing
areas is essential to the over-all
objective of Red China: to domi
nate the whole of Asia. If their
armies are to function in the
field, the Red Chinese will need
food, as much as they need it at
present for their starving popu
lation.
Now what part do the Hima
layas play in the acquisition of
food-producing areas? Reading
the daily news media and a
study of a map of Asia are suffi
cient to provide the answer. The
two areas, in the mountains, that

are the scenes of the heaviest
fighting are adjacent to the In
dus-Ganges valley region, which
is the principal food-producing
area of India. With this region
under their control, the Red Chi
nese pose a greater threat than
presently to the rest of the In
dian sub-continent, the Middle
East, Burma, and, eventually, the
Southeast Asian peninsula.
Thus, the control of the Hima
layas provides a stepping-stone
for Red China to “jump-off” into
the Indian sub-continent. A per
son who does not think that the
over-all objective of Rod China is
the domination of the whole of
Asia, has a very short-sighted
conception of the future history
of Asia, and particularly of the
present Sino-Indian border con
flict.
