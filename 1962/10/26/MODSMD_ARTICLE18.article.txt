## Another Parable On Two Protests In Two Cities 
### C. R. GALLISTEL 
Once there were two scribes
who had chosen many ages ago
for some forgotten reason of
their own to dwell in a dark cave
where the light of what little
truth there was in the world
came hardly at all. The air of the
cave was heavy with a Lethean
dampness that dulled and be
fogged their memories. Here the
scribes undertook to publish in
the world commentaries on what
came to pass. They set these
commentaries down in the man
ner of the Book of Our Lord, per
haps with the intent to lend them
the appearance of truth. But veri
ly I say unto you, what they re
lated bore small semblance to
what was; for they saw very lit
tle of the world clearly from
their place in the cave and that
little they did horribly confound.
And there was in the country
at that time a government which
did sometimes overstep the legal
bounds which wise and freedom
loving men had laid down for it.
A small band of students to
whom the freedom of the individ
ual was sacred sought to attend a
hearing where it was feared that
the government would again so
err; but they were unjustly de
nied entrance; whereupon they
stood in peaceable though vocal
protest without the doors of the
hearing room until a crazed agent
of the government turned water
upon them, and other agents of
the government carried them
away, doing much violence to
their persons. And be it noted
that all violence was on the part
of the government.
And there was also in the coun
try another group who believed
passionately in their own free
dom but would deny the freedom
of others who were of a darker
skin. When the government
sought to enforce the freedom of
the dark skinned ones, rioters
took up arms and shot at the
agents of the government, and
stoned them, and threw burning
torches at them, and caused loss
of life thereby.
Now the scribes proclaimed
that both these events were of
the same ilk, and they railed
against those outside who saw by
a better light and forgot not so
quickly and hence perceived a
great difference. Indeed, these
cave dwellers did publish malici
ous doctrines. But let us not con
demn them; rather let us pray in
the manner of Our Lord: “Fa
ther, forgive them; for they know
not what they say.”

skin. When the government
sought to enforce the freedom of
the dark skinned ones, rioters
took up arms and shot at the
agents of the government, and
stoned them, and threw burning
torches at them, and caused loss
of life thereby.
Now the scribes proclaimed
that both these events were of
the same ilk, and they railed
against those outside who saw by
a better light and forgot not so
quickly and hence perceived a
great difference. Indeed, these
cave dwellers did publish malici
ous doctrines. But let us not con
demn them; rather let us pray in
the manner of Our Lord: “Fa
ther, forgive them; for they know
not what they say.”
Once there were two scribes
who had chosen many ages ago
for some forgotten reason of
their own to dwell in a dark cave
where the light of what little
truth there was in the world
came hardly at all. The air of the
cave was heavy with a Lethean
dampness that dulled and be
fogged their memories. Here the
scribes undertook to publish in
the world commentaries on what
came to pass. They set these
commentaries down in the man
ner of the Book of Our Lord, per
haps with the intent to lend them
the appearance of truth. But veri
ly I say unto you, what they re
lated bore small semblance to
what was; for they saw very lit
tle of the world clearly from
their place in the cave and that
little they did horribly confound.
And there was in the country
at that time a government which
did sometimes overstep the legal
bounds which wise and freedom
loving men had laid down for it.
A small band of students to
whom the freedom of the individ
ual was sacred sought to attend a
hearing where it was feared that
the government would again so
err; but they were unjustly de
nied entrance; whereupon they
stood in peaceable though vocal
protest without the doors of the
hearing room until a crazed agent
of the government turned water
upon them, and other agents of
the government carried them
away, doing much violence to
their persons. And be it noted
that all violence was on the part
of the government.
And there was also in the coun
try another group who believed
passionately in their own free
dom but would deny the freedom
of others who were of a darker
skin. When the government
