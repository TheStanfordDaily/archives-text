# LIPPMANN ON CUBA:
## Diplomacy Must Not Abdicate In Favor of Forcible Action 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
It is Wednesday morning as I am writing this article, and the
President’s proclamation of a selective blockade has just gone into
effect. We are now waiting for the other shoe to drop. There are a
number of Soviet and Communist bloc ships on their way to Cuba.
One in particular is presumed to be carrying contraband. There has

as yet been no contact between'
these ships and our forces and we
do not know what orders Moscow
has given to the ship captains.
For the present, all depends
upon these orders. As of the pres
ent moment we do not know
whether the orders are to turn
away from Cuba, to proceed and
submit to search, or to proceed
and to refuse to submit to search.

i+ ———
' supposing that there is no shoot
' ing conflict at sea. And it is here,
I believe, that diplomacy must
; not abdicate.
There are three ways to get rid
• of the missiles already in Cuba,
i One is to invade and occupy Cu-
I ha. The second way is to institute
I a total blockade, particularly of
oil shipments, which would in a
, few months ruin the Cuban econ
i omy. The third way is to try, I
> repeat to try, to negotiate a faee
■ saving agreement.
1 I hasten to say at once that I
. am not talking about and do not
, believe in a “Cuba-Berlin” horse
trade. Cuba and Berlin are wholly
j different cases. Berlin is not an
I American missile base, it is not
. a base for any kind of offensive
[ action, as Cuba is byway of be
. coming.
The only place that is truly
. comparable with Cuba is Turkey.
, This is the only place where there
. are strategic weapons right on
. the frontier of the Soviet Union.
, There are none in Norway, there
, arc none in Iran, there are none
t in Pakistan. There are some in
[ Italy. But Italy is not on the
• frontier of the Soviet Union.
THERE IS another important
, similarity between Cuba and
Turkey. The Soviet missile base
| in Cuba, like the U.S.-NATO base
, in Turkey, is of little military
value. The Soviet military base in
, Cuba is defenseless, and the base
in Turkey is all but obsolete. The
two bases could be dismantled
. without altering the world bal
, ance of power.
, If, as the first concrete step in
the disarmament we’ve talked so
| much about, there could be an
agreement to remove offensive
weapons from fringe countries, it
would not mean, of course, that
Turkey would cease to be under
1 the protection of NATO. Norway
does not have strategic weapons
on her soil and she is still an
allied nation. Great Britain, which
is a pillar of NATO, is actually
liquidating U.S. missile and
bomber bases on her own soil in
accordance with Western strate
gic doctrine.
For all these reasons I say that
an agreement of this sort may be
feasible and that there may exist
away out of the tyranny of auto
matic and uncontrollable events.

Until we do
know, we can
only speculate
as to whether
the Soviets will
engage them
selves at sea on
the way to Cuba,
will submit to
the blockade and
retaliate cls e
where, or will

limit themselves to violent state
ments without violent action.
There are those, for whose judg
ment I have profound respect,
who think that it is now too late
for this country to influence the
decisions of the Soviet Union
and that the President is now ir
retrieveabiy committed to a
course which can end only with a
total blockade or an invasion of
Cuba.
They may be right. But I have
lived through two world wars,
and in both of them, once we
were engaged, we made the same
tragic mistake. We suspended di
plomacy when the guns began to
shoot. In both wars as the result
we achieved a great victory but
we could not make peace. There
is a mood in this country today
which could easily cause us to
make the same mistake again.
Wte must in honor attempt to
avoid it.
I SEE DANGER of this mis
take in the fact that when the
President saw Mr. Gromyko on
Thursday, and had the evidence
of the missile build-up in Cuba,
he refrained from confronting
Mr. Gromyko with this evidence.
This was to suspend diplomacy
If it had not been suspended, the
President would have shown Mr.
Gromyko the pictures, and told
him privately about the policy
which in a few days he intended
to announce publicly. This would
have made it more likely that
Moscow would order the ships
not to push on to Cuba. But if
such diplomatic action did not
change the orders, if Mr. Khrush
chev persisted in spite of it, the
President’s public speech would
have been stronger. For it would
not have been subject to the criti
cism that a great power had is
sued an ultimatum to another
great power without first at
tempting to negotiate the issue.
By confronting Mr. Gromyko pri
vately, the President would have
given Mr. Khrushchev what all
wise statesmen give their adver
saries—the chance to save face.
There is, I know, no use crying
over spilt milk. But I am making
the point because there is still so
much milk that can be spilt.
We have, we must note, made
two separate demands. One is
that no more “offensive weap
ons” shall be brought into Cuba.
On this demand, we shall soon
have a showdown. Considering
the unanimity of the other Amer
ican states, considering the stra
tegic weakness of the Soviet Un
ion in this hemisphere, there is
reason to hope that the quaran
tine of Cuba will work, though
we must expect retaliation else
where.
But the President has laid
down a second demand, which is
that the missile installations al
ready in Cuba be dismantled and
removed. How this is to he done
is a very great question, even

Until we do
know, we can
only speculate
as to whether
the Soviets will
engage them
selves at sea on
the way to Cuba,
will submit to
the blockade and
retaliate cls e
where, or will

limit themselves to violent state
ments without violent action.
There are those, for whose judg
ment I have profound respect,
who think that it is now too late
for this country to influence the
decisions of the Soviet Union
and that the President is now ir
retrieveabiy committed to a
course which can end only with a
total blockade or an invasion of
Cuba.
They may be right. But I have
lived through two world wars,
and in both of them, once we
were engaged, we made the same
tragic mistake. We suspended di
plomacy when the guns began to
shoot. In both wars as the result
we achieved a great victory but
we could not make peace. There
is a mood in this country today
which could easily cause us to
make the same mistake again.
Wte must in honor attempt to
avoid it.
I SEE DANGER of this mis
take in the fact that when the
President saw Mr. Gromyko on
Thursday, and had the evidence
of the missile build-up in Cuba,
he refrained from confronting
Mr. Gromyko with this evidence.
This was to suspend diplomacy
If it had not been suspended, the
President would have shown Mr.
Gromyko the pictures, and told
him privately about the policy
which in a few days he intended
to announce publicly. This would
have made it more likely that
Moscow would order the ships
not to push on to Cuba. But if
such diplomatic action did not
change the orders, if Mr. Khrush
chev persisted in spite of it, the
President’s public speech would
have been stronger. For it would
not have been subject to the criti
cism that a great power had is
sued an ultimatum to another
great power without first at
tempting to negotiate the issue.
By confronting Mr. Gromyko pri
vately, the President would have
given Mr. Khrushchev what all
wise statesmen give their adver
saries—the chance to save face.
There is, I know, no use crying
over spilt milk. But I am making
the point because there is still so
much milk that can be spilt.
We have, we must note, made
two separate demands. One is
that no more “offensive weap
ons” shall be brought into Cuba.
On this demand, we shall soon
have a showdown. Considering
the unanimity of the other Amer
ican states, considering the stra
tegic weakness of the Soviet Un
ion in this hemisphere, there is
reason to hope that the quaran
tine of Cuba will work, though
we must expect retaliation else
where.
But the President has laid
down a second demand, which is
that the missile installations al
ready in Cuba be dismantled and
removed. How this is to he done
is a very great question, even

It is Wednesday morning as I am writing this article, and the
President’s proclamation of a selective blockade has just gone into
effect. We are now waiting for the other shoe to drop. There are a
number of Soviet and Communist bloc ships on their way to Cuba.
One in particular is presumed to be carrying contraband. There has

as yet been no contact between'
these ships and our forces and we
do not know what orders Moscow
has given to the ship captains.
For the present, all depends
upon these orders. As of the pres
ent moment we do not know
whether the orders are to turn
away from Cuba, to proceed and
submit to search, or to proceed
and to refuse to submit to search.

There are three ways to get rid

Until we do
know, we can
only speculate
as to whether
the Soviets will
engage them
selves at sea on
the way to Cuba,
will submit to
the blockade and
retaliate cls e
where, or will

limit themselves to violent state
ments without violent action.
There are those, for whose judg
ment I have profound respect,
who think that it is now too late
for this country to influence the
decisions of the Soviet Union
and that the President is now ir
retrieveabiy committed to a
course which can end only with a
total blockade or an invasion of
Cuba.
They may be right. But I have
lived through two world wars,
and in both of them, once we
were engaged, we made the same
tragic mistake. We suspended di
plomacy when the guns began to
shoot. In both wars as the result
we achieved a great victory but
we could not make peace. There
is a mood in this country today
which could easily cause us to
make the same mistake again.
Wte must in honor attempt to
avoid it.
I SEE DANGER of this mis
take in the fact that when the
President saw Mr. Gromyko on
Thursday, and had the evidence
of the missile build-up in Cuba,
he refrained from confronting
Mr. Gromyko with this evidence.
This was to suspend diplomacy
If it had not been suspended, the
President would have shown Mr.
Gromyko the pictures, and told
him privately about the policy
which in a few days he intended
to announce publicly. This would
have made it more likely that
Moscow would order the ships
not to push on to Cuba. But if
such diplomatic action did not
change the orders, if Mr. Khrush
chev persisted in spite of it, the
President’s public speech would
have been stronger. For it would
not have been subject to the criti
cism that a great power had is
sued an ultimatum to another
great power without first at
tempting to negotiate the issue.
By confronting Mr. Gromyko pri
vately, the President would have
given Mr. Khrushchev what all
wise statesmen give their adver
saries—the chance to save face.
There is, I know, no use crying
over spilt milk. But I am making
the point because there is still so
much milk that can be spilt.
We have, we must note, made
two separate demands. One is
that no more “offensive weap
ons” shall be brought into Cuba.
On this demand, we shall soon
have a showdown. Considering
the unanimity of the other Amer
ican states, considering the stra
tegic weakness of the Soviet Un
ion in this hemisphere, there is
reason to hope that the quaran
tine of Cuba will work, though
we must expect retaliation else
where.
But the President has laid
down a second demand, which is
that the missile installations al
ready in Cuba be dismantled and
removed. How this is to he done
is a very great question, even

It is Wednesday morning as I am writing this article, and the
President’s proclamation of a selective blockade has just gone into
effect. We are now waiting for the other shoe to drop. There are a
number of Soviet and Communist bloc ships on their way to Cuba.
One in particular is presumed to be carrying contraband. There has

as yet been no contact between'
these ships and our forces and we
do not know what orders Moscow
has given to the ship captains.
For the present, all depends
upon these orders. As of the pres
ent moment we do not know
whether the orders are to turn
away from Cuba, to proceed and
submit to search, or to proceed
and to refuse to submit to search.

we could not make peace. There
is a mood in this country today
which could easily cause us to
make the same mistake again.
Wte must in honor attempt to
avoid it.
I SEE DANGER of this mis
take in the fact that when the
President saw Mr. Gromyko on
Thursday, and had the evidence
of the missile build-up in Cuba,
he refrained from confronting
Mr. Gromyko with this evidence.
This was to suspend diplomacy
If it had not been suspended, the
President would have shown Mr.
Gromyko the pictures, and told
him privately about the policy
which in a few days he intended
to announce publicly. This would
have made it more likely that
Moscow would order the ships
not to push on to Cuba. But if
such diplomatic action did not
change the orders, if Mr. Khrush
chev persisted in spite of it, the
President’s public speech would
have been stronger. For it would
not have been subject to the criti
cism that a great power had is
sued an ultimatum to another
great power without first at
tempting to negotiate the issue.
By confronting Mr. Gromyko pri
vately, the President would have
given Mr. Khrushchev what all
wise statesmen give their adver
saries—the chance to save face.
There is, I know, no use crying
over spilt milk. But I am making
the point because there is still so
much milk that can be spilt.
We have, we must note, made
two separate demands. One is
that no more “offensive weap
ons” shall be brought into Cuba.
On this demand, we shall soon
have a showdown. Considering
the unanimity of the other Amer
ican states, considering the stra
tegic weakness of the Soviet Un
ion in this hemisphere, there is
reason to hope that the quaran
tine of Cuba will work, though
we must expect retaliation else
where.
But the President has laid
down a second demand, which is
that the missile installations al
ready in Cuba be dismantled and
removed. How this is to he done
is a very great question, even

It is Wednesday morning as I am writing this article, and the
President’s proclamation of a selective blockade has just gone into
effect. We are now waiting for the other shoe to drop. There are a
number of Soviet and Communist bloc ships on their way to Cuba.
One in particular is presumed to be carrying contraband. There has

as yet been no contact between'
these ships and our forces and we
do not know what orders Moscow
has given to the ship captains.
For the present, all depends
upon these orders. As of the pres
ent moment we do not know
whether the orders are to turn
away from Cuba, to proceed and
submit to search, or to proceed
and to refuse to submit to search.

i+ ———
' supposing that there is no shoot
' ing conflict at sea. And it is here,
I believe, that diplomacy must
; not abdicate.
There are three ways to get rid
• of the missiles already in Cuba,
i One is to invade and occupy Cu-
I ha. The second way is to institute
I a total blockade, particularly of
oil shipments, which would in a
, few months ruin the Cuban econ
i omy. The third way is to try, I
> repeat to try, to negotiate a faee
■ saving agreement.
1 I hasten to say at once that I
. am not talking about and do not
, believe in a “Cuba-Berlin” horse
trade. Cuba and Berlin are wholly
j different cases. Berlin is not an
I American missile base, it is not
. a base for any kind of offensive
[ action, as Cuba is byway of be
. coming.
The only place that is truly
. comparable with Cuba is Turkey.
, This is the only place where there
. are strategic weapons right on
. the frontier of the Soviet Union.
, There are none in Norway, there
, arc none in Iran, there are none
t in Pakistan. There are some in
[ Italy. But Italy is not on the
• frontier of the Soviet Union.
THERE IS another important
, similarity between Cuba and
Turkey. The Soviet missile base
| in Cuba, like the U.S.-NATO base
, in Turkey, is of little military
value. The Soviet military base in
, Cuba is defenseless, and the base
in Turkey is all but obsolete. The
two bases could be dismantled
. without altering the world bal
, ance of power.
, If, as the first concrete step in
the disarmament we’ve talked so
| much about, there could be an
agreement to remove offensive
weapons from fringe countries, it
would not mean, of course, that
Turkey would cease to be under
1 the protection of NATO. Norway
does not have strategic weapons
on her soil and she is still an
allied nation. Great Britain, which
is a pillar of NATO, is actually
liquidating U.S. missile and
bomber bases on her own soil in
accordance with Western strate
gic doctrine.
For all these reasons I say that
an agreement of this sort may be
feasible and that there may exist
away out of the tyranny of auto
matic and uncontrollable events.

Until we do
know, we can
only speculate
as to whether
the Soviets will
engage them
selves at sea on
the way to Cuba,
will submit to
the blockade and
retaliate cls e
where, or will

limit themselves to violent state
ments without violent action.
There are those, for whose judg
ment I have profound respect,
who think that it is now too late
for this country to influence the
decisions of the Soviet Union
and that the President is now ir
retrieveabiy committed to a
course which can end only with a
total blockade or an invasion of
Cuba.
They may be right. But I have
lived through two world wars,
and in both of them, once we
were engaged, we made the same
tragic mistake. We suspended di
plomacy when the guns began to
shoot. In both wars as the result
we achieved a great victory but
we could not make peace. There
is a mood in this country today
which could easily cause us to
make the same mistake again.
Wte must in honor attempt to
avoid it.
