Editor, The Daily:
The Daily has been publishing
cartoons by Herblock for years.
But why? Political cartoons cer
tainly do have a purpose; good
ones can state the essence of a
situation and make a significant
comment upon it with a clarity
and vividness that can be
achieved by no other means. Hu
mor and ridicule usually add to
this effectiveness, but there is a
fine line between mature irony
and the childish name-calling that
Herblock indulges in. Though we
can thank God and our founding
fathers that we have a handsome
presidential family, the Cuban
crisis is little clarified by depict
ing Khrushchev as an ill-humored
and ugly old man, or by cartoons
showing him throwing hob nail
boots and otherwise molesting
tender young girls labelled
“Peace.” “Europa,” “the World,”
or any other stereotype that
comes to mind. Such appeals to
the basest emotions have no place
in a newspaper, and Herblock, in
spite of his practiced drawing
style, should be eliminated from
the Daily for his lack of taste.
