Editor, The Daily:
I should like to repeat in this
letter the point I made in a verbal
statement yesterday at Tresidder
Union. This is no longer the time
for moral disquisitions but the
time for action, if we are going
to survive as free individuals.
The fact is that the Soviet Union
has not claimed officially or un
officially either control or re
sponsibility upon the rocket
launching sites in Cuba. Here lies
the vital difference between the
controversial Cuban bases and
the American bases throughout
the world which are officially and
opetdy operated and controlled by
the U.S, forces and for which,
consequently, the U.S. is respon
sible.
The policy of “throw the stone
and hide the hand” can be toler
ated, perhaps, with stones, but
certainly not with nuclear bombs.
If the Soviet Union made an
agreement with the Cubans for

the lease of launching sites to be
entirely controlled by the Rus
sians, then the Soviet Union
should say so officially and then
we should see what our next
move should be. The issue would
be a different one; certainly not
as dangerous as the present one,
although very dangerous indeed.
But in absence of official ad
mission of property, control and
responsibility on the part of the
Soviet Union, the free world is
loft with no other choice but to
assume that the Cuban govern
ment has control of said launch
ing sites.
Now, this is something the free
world cannot permit. The fate of
mankind cannot depend on the
mood of an irresponsible and
temperamental rebel. The point
is that the Russians and the
Americans both have much to
lose in the event of a nuclear war.
This fact keeps us alive. But the
Cuban government does not have
much to lose. As a political sys
tem they doomed themselves in
front of their people by going
too far to the left. They are in a
closed end road and they know it.
Let us remember that the favor
ite death for a rebel is to die
killing.
And let us remember as well
that one of the most common,
efficient and unfortunately in
nocuous ways of liquidating or
harming an enemy is to hire and
arm an assassin, or in this case,
a doomed “desperado.”
In the light of this line of think
ing I fully support the policy of
Mr. Kennedy in relation with the
blockade of Cuba.

Editor, The Daily:
Those who may be rejoicing
over the news that the loyalty
provisions of the National De
fense Education Act have been
repealed had better take a closer
look at what transpired in Wash
ington.
Three new amendments to the
Act were approved clauses
which represent a new insult to
the students of America and
which are another example of
perverted patriotism destroying
civil liberties.
The most important of the
three amendments makes it a
crime for any member of a com
munist organization, as the term
is defined in the Subversive Ac
tivities Control Act of 1950 (also
known as the Internal Security
Act and the McCarran Act), to
apply for aid and try to use it.
The penalty is five years in jail
or a $lO,OOO fine or both.
What falls under the rubric of
“communist” or “membership” is
so vaguely defined that an in
dividual could end up in jail for
signing a petition or attending a
meeting of some organization
whose views on a particular issue
happened to coincide with those
of the communists.

Allen Young
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to repeat in this
letter the point I made in a verbal
statement yesterday at Tresidder
Union. This is no longer the time
for moral disquisitions but the
time for action, if we are going
to survive as free individuals.
The fact is that the Soviet Union
has not claimed officially or un
officially either control or re
sponsibility upon the rocket
launching sites in Cuba. Here lies
the vital difference between the
controversial Cuban bases and
the American bases throughout
the world which are officially and
opetdy operated and controlled by
the U.S, forces and for which,
consequently, the U.S. is respon
sible.
The policy of “throw the stone
and hide the hand” can be toler
ated, perhaps, with stones, but
certainly not with nuclear bombs.
If the Soviet Union made an
agreement with the Cubans for

the lease of launching sites to be
entirely controlled by the Rus
sians, then the Soviet Union
should say so officially and then
we should see what our next
move should be. The issue would
be a different one; certainly not
as dangerous as the present one,
although very dangerous indeed.
But in absence of official ad
mission of property, control and
responsibility on the part of the
Soviet Union, the free world is
loft with no other choice but to
assume that the Cuban govern
ment has control of said launch
ing sites.
Now, this is something the free
world cannot permit. The fate of
mankind cannot depend on the
mood of an irresponsible and
temperamental rebel. The point
is that the Russians and the
Americans both have much to
lose in the event of a nuclear war.
This fact keeps us alive. But the
Cuban government does not have
much to lose. As a political sys
tem they doomed themselves in
front of their people by going
too far to the left. They are in a
closed end road and they know it.
Let us remember that the favor
ite death for a rebel is to die
killing.
And let us remember as well
that one of the most common,
efficient and unfortunately in
nocuous ways of liquidating or
harming an enemy is to hire and
arm an assassin, or in this case,
a doomed “desperado.”
In the light of this line of think
ing I fully support the policy of
Mr. Kennedy in relation with the
blockade of Cuba.

Those who may be rejoicing
over the news that the loyalty
provisions of the National De
fense Education Act have been
repealed had better take a closer
look at what transpired in Wash
ington.
Three new amendments to the
Act were approved clauses
which represent a new insult to
the students of America and
which are another example of
perverted patriotism destroying
civil liberties.
The most important of the
three amendments makes it a
crime for any member of a com
munist organization, as the term
is defined in the Subversive Ac
tivities Control Act of 1950 (also
known as the Internal Security
Act and the McCarran Act), to
apply for aid and try to use it.
The penalty is five years in jail
or a $lO,OOO fine or both.
What falls under the rubric of
“communist” or “membership” is
so vaguely defined that an in
dividual could end up in jail for
signing a petition or attending a
meeting of some organization
whose views on a particular issue
happened to coincide with those
of the communists.
