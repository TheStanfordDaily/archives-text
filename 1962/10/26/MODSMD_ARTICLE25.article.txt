# PART OF LONG-RANGE PLAN
## Physics' 'Box' Joins 'Tank' 
### RICK SEIFERT 
Nestled between the '“tank”
and a wasteland turned weed
patch, the now Varion Physics
Laboratory is perhaps the worst
single piece of architecture to
blemish the Stanford campus
since Stern Hall.
The new building, which casts
its gloom over Lomita Drive, dis
plays what is euphemistically la
beled a "massive” appearance.
The four-foot thick cement walls
which define the basement, are
not, however, without function.
They barricade a small nuclear
accelerator and its radiation from
the rest of the campus.
THE COLOR of the building
makes a completely ineffective
attempt at matching the Quad’s
sandstone hue. Since building
costs antiquate sandstone con
struction, a color that falls some
where between an infectious yel
low and a nauseous orange, has
been swabbed on the exterior of
the building. Hence the feeling
conveyed to the viewer is not
aesthetic hut rather anesthetic.
The shape of the building has
cleverly made the transition from
the tank form of the neighboring
Physics Lecture Hall. The idea
here is that if the student can’t
study in a barrel, perhaps he will
have better luck in a cement shoe
box.
Fortunately the Varian Build
ing cannot be judged as a single
structure, for it is but one part
of a complete group of science
buildings yet to be built.
HENCE THE real problems
surrounding the architecture of
the new laboratory will be re
moved as funds are made avail
able for the completion of the
entire project. Moreover, the pres
ent piece-meal appearance of the
campus will disappear as such an
ticipated building groups are
completed.
The back side of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, although it is an eye
sore now, will eventually be hid
den from view. So too will the
new science buildings blend with
the “Great Quadrangle" when
Lomita Drive is transformed into
an elaborate mall which will dis
play a pond and modern statuary
forms.
When dealing with an exten
sive, long-range building pro
gram like Stanford’s, fortunately,
one cannot judge the architectur
al effectiveness of one building
until the entire project has been
completed.

Lomita Drive is transformed into
an elaborate mall which will dis
play a pond and modern statuary
forms.

one cannot judge the architectur

THE NEW PHYSICS Building has been criticized for its drabness
and lack of aesthetic appeal. It is part of a major new construc
tion program.
Nestled between the '“tank”
and a wasteland turned weed
patch, the now Varion Physics
Laboratory is perhaps the worst
single piece of architecture to
blemish the Stanford campus
since Stern Hall.
The new building, which casts
its gloom over Lomita Drive, dis
plays what is euphemistically la
beled a "massive” appearance.
The four-foot thick cement walls
which define the basement, are
not, however, without function.
They barricade a small nuclear
accelerator and its radiation from
the rest of the campus.
THE COLOR of the building
makes a completely ineffective
attempt at matching the Quad’s
sandstone hue. Since building
costs antiquate sandstone con
struction, a color that falls some
where between an infectious yel
low and a nauseous orange, has
been swabbed on the exterior of
the building. Hence the feeling
conveyed to the viewer is not
aesthetic hut rather anesthetic.
The shape of the building has
cleverly made the transition from
the tank form of the neighboring
Physics Lecture Hall. The idea
here is that if the student can’t
study in a barrel, perhaps he will
have better luck in a cement shoe
box.
Fortunately the Varian Build
ing cannot be judged as a single
structure, for it is but one part
of a complete group of science
buildings yet to be built.
HENCE THE real problems
surrounding the architecture of
the new laboratory will be re
moved as funds are made avail
able for the completion of the
entire project. Moreover, the pres
ent piece-meal appearance of the
campus will disappear as such an
ticipated building groups are
completed.
The back side of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, although it is an eye
sore now, will eventually be hid
den from view. So too will the
new science buildings blend with
the “Great Quadrangle" when
Lomita Drive is transformed into
an elaborate mall which will dis
play a pond and modern statuary
forms.
