Editor, The Daily;
I was shocked to read of the
reasons Drs. Leppert, Franklin
and Holman gave for protesting
the Cuban blockade. They would
have us believe that the blockade
is “unethical, hypocritical and a
threat to humanity.” It is, in fact,
hypocritical, but hypocrisy will
always exist where two powers
with different sets of values
clash. But if it was unethical to
blockade Cuba then it was equal
ly unethical for us to enter World
War I. It wasn’t our war, but w’e
made it our war because it posed
a threat to humanity and that
threat) had to be answered. We
are still fighting that war, and
although the location of the en
emy has changed, his goal has
not. That goal is world domina
tion and no ethical question is
going to slop him.
The only thing that the Cuban
blockade is not is legal. But we
are fighting a war and not play
ing football. Wo do not have to
give up the ball after every score
or allow the adversary equal
time at each goal. This is war,
gentlemen, and we must stop try
ing to win it with the pop-guns
and pea-shooters of legal and eth
ical righteousness and use the
biggest weapon we’ve got—the
only truly ultimate weapon—that
we are right and they are wrong
and we don’t have to retreat.
