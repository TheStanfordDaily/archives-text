the Cards competition for first.
In a meet last year, he outran
all the Stanford entrants. How
ever, in cross meets the first five
men on a team count in the scor
ing, and USC finished well back.
UC LA ALSO lacked depth last
year, and their one outstanding
runner, Mil Dahl, graduated,
thereby crippling the team con
siderably.
Both schools have added junior
college transfers and freshmen to
their squads, however, and these
new men may give Stanford a
hard race.
The Indians will race Deubner,
Harry McCalla, Weym Kirkland,
Paul Schlicke, Bill Pratt, Bob
Milt/, and Harlan Andrews
against the Bruins and Trojans.
Deubner and McCall have the
