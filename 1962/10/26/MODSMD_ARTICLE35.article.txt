# Hickey's Concern Is LA—Not Waterfield
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (UP! I Bob,
Waterfield’s tenure as coach of!
the Rams is supposed to be at
stake when the Los Angeles club |
tangles with the San Francisco |
30’ers on Sunday. San Francisco |
coach Red Hickey isn’t about to j
offer any sympathy to Water- i
field.
"1 don’t know about the report j
on his job,” says Hickey. “But
I do know this: We have pre- |
pared for the Rams just as
though they had a 6-0 record, in-|
stead of 0-6.
“TIIFKF is so much tradition
al rivalry involved in this game* ]
that it’s a tossup.”
The report is that Waterfield
is ranging on the ragged edge of
being given bis walking papers, j
Counting the last three exhibition
games of the season, the Rams
now have lost nine straight.
Last Sunday they were upset
by the Minnesota Vikings, 38-14.
That wouldn’t have been so bad
except that the Vikings ran up a
31-0 lead in the first half and then
coasted to victory.
