## Stanford Meets USC In Top Team Battle 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
The top two teams in AAWU
water polo meet this afternoon in
Los Angeles when DSC hosts
Stanford. The game will decide
first place temporarily, but the
outcome will he more important
as an indication of the Trojans’
and Indians’ relative strengths in
a head-on meeting.
USC, coached by Neil Kohlhase,
coach of the 1956 and 1960 U.S.
Olympic teams, is currently lead
ing the AAWU with a 2-0 record.
Stanford is second, having beaten
Cal in its only league game so
far. Thc> Indians’ over-all record
is 8-1, their only loss coming last
Saturday against the powerful
Olympic Club of San Francisco.
STANFORD COACH Jim
Gaughran feels that win today
will definitely establish the Tribe
as the AAWU favorite. “If we
cun win in SC’s home pool,” he

said, “we certainly ought to be
able to beat them here (on No
vember 19»; two wins over them
will probably mean the champion
ship for us.”
The Indians have all sorts of
precedents to overcome, however.
SC has either won or tied for the
AAWU championship every year
since 1954.
TOMORROW Stanford plays
UCLA at 10 a.m. in Westwood in
another, but much easier, league
game. UCLA stands fourth and
last in the league, with a 0-2
record.
Stanford’s starting lineup for
these two games will be un
changed from the past few
weeks. In the front line is Marty
Hull, Pete Pettigrew, and Ron
Kovas; the guards are Don Bueh
ler, Mike Conn, and Bill Lorton;
the goalie is George Stransky.
