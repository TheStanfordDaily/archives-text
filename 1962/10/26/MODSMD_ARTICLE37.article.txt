# Bruin Gridders Host Unbeaten Indian Frosh
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Winners of their first two
games against Southern Califor
nia and San Jose, Stanford’s
frosh gridders risk their unbeat
en record against UCLA tomor
row in the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum. The game is a prelim
inary to the varsity clash.
The Bruin frosh is led by Rod
Sherman, a quarterback who
does everything but give rub
downs to his teammates during
half-time. Red, who led all South
ern California high school players
in scoring last season, is a power
ful, extremely swift sprinter. He
possesses an accurate passing
arm and did all the punting and
place kicking for his school last
year.
It is Red’s passing that could
pose a particular threat to the
Cards. Last week, against a San
Jose team outplayed noticeably
in I he lino, the Indians were weak
on pass defense. The Spartans’
Ken Berry was able to complete
8 of 16 attempts, despite a hard
rush. Berry often found his re
ceivers, especially Tim Knowles,
all alone in the Stanford second
ary. San Jose was able to net 95
yards through the air, while
Stanford was held to one comple
tion and 19 yards gained.
Prospects are not all dim by
any means. The San Jose game
revealed a new defensive star.
Roger Clay, who started the sea
son as a third string halfback,
was moved to guard. Roger re
sponded by leading the team in
tackles, playing a fine game be
fore coming out with a sore knes.
If Sherman can be contained,
Stanford should continue its win
ning streak. The offense, led by
quarterback Mike Connelly, half
back Ray Handley, and fullbacks
Glenn Myers and Bob Steecker,
should be able to move the ball
effectively. It’s up to the defense.
