# BRUINS FAVORED BY NINE
## Tribe Seeks Upset at UCLA 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford will be trying for its
first football win over UCLA
since 1958 tomorrow in the Los
Angeles Coliseum. The Indians
have' received some fearful heat
ings from UCLA in the last three
years, including 13-5. 8-26, and
0-20, but all would be right in the
world if the Cards could pull off
an upset against the nationally

ranked Bruins.
UCLA has been established as a
nine-point favorite by the wire
services. Coach Jack Curtice ex
pressed fear earlier this week
that the annual mid-term let
down may strike Stanford, as
most of the Indian footballers
have mid-terms coming up very
soon.

Indian co-captain Ed Cumings
tried to convince his teammates
to be rested for this game. If
they can pull off the upset, it
would be the Indians first win
since beating Michigan State a
month ago.
Stanford's biggest hope for vic
tory may be through the airways.
Quarterback Steve Thurlow pass
ed at his best a week ago against
Washington, a team w'hich al
ways boasts an outstanding pass
defense. Clark Weaver, whose
passing hasn’t lived up to the
promise shown in the spring con
test against the Stanford Alumni,
also can fling the ball.
UCLA can be passed against.
Even lowly Colorado State com
pleted eleven tosses against the
Bruins.
On the other hand. UCLA has a
rugged ground defense, slopping
mighty Ohio State three times
inside the ten-yard line with goal
line stands. A week later, Ohio
State ran for 515 yards against
Illinois.

The Bruins aren’t exactly an
offensive power. Take away the
Colorado State debacle won by
UCLA 35-7, in which the Colo
radans lost their twentieth
straight game, and the Uclans
have managed exactly 15 points.
Pittsburgh, a team which allowed
Cal 24 points, held UCLA to six.
Coach Billy Barnes described the
contest as his boys’ best of the
season.

Soph quarterback Larry Zeno
paces the UCLA offense. He has
run for 112 yards and added an-

other 243 in the air. E/.ell Single
ton is the other Bruin quarter
back. Leading UCLA rusher,
soph fullback Warren Jackson,
and sub-fullback Mitch Dimkich,
both may not play against Stan
ford. Jackson has a bruised el
bow, while Dimkich has leg trou
ble.
Kermit Alexander, who ran 45
yards for a score the first lime

in the school’s history UCLA ever
used the T-formation, has aver
aged over seven yards per carry,
and is one of the better defensive
backs in the AAWU.
Line mainstays for the Bruins
include Andy Von Sonn, Joe Bau
wens, Phil Oram, and Mel Profit.
The first three are interior line
men, while Profit as an end. is
the leading Bruin pass receiver
and an outstanding defensive
end.
Stanford starters in the line
will probably he Steve Pursell
and Frank Patitucci at ends;
Frank Atkinson and A1 Hilde
brand at tackles; Marv Harris
and Frank Dubofsky at guards;
and C. B. Simons at center.
In the backfield will be either
Thurlow or Weaver at quarter
back; J. D. Lodato, leading Stan
ford rusher with 153 yards, and
Danny Spence at halfbacks; and
Ed ummings at fullback.
However being in the starting
lineup doesn’t mean playing most
of the game. The starters are
chosen depending on whether
Stanford takes the offense or de
fense. However if goes tomorrow,
ends Bob Howard and Guy Roun
saville; tackles Chuck Buehler,
Bom Nichols and Dick Lceuwen
burg; guards Jack Chappie and

Randy Vahan, and center Carl
Schrader will all see plenty of
action in the line.

Backs Tim Hansel, Gary Sar
gent, Dick Ragsdale, Tony De
Lellis and Ken Babajian will like
ly play as much as the starters


UCLA’s LARRY ZENO, left, and Stanford's Clark Weaver, right, will
both see plenty of actiort at quarterback in tomorrow's UCLA-Stan
ford clash. Zeno, a sophomore, in last week's loss to Pitt, picked
up over half of UCLA's total yardage with 132 yards passing and
55 yards rushing. Weaver alternates with Steve Thurlow in guid
ing Stanford's offense.
