## 
### 
John Steinbeck, a Stanford stu
dent in the early 1920’5, was
a wan led the 1962 Nobel Prize for
Literature yesterday. He became
the sixth American to receive the
literature award.
In announcing the award, the
Swedish Academy praised Stein
beck for “his at one and the same
time realistic an d imaginative
writings, distinguished as they are
by a sympathetic humor and so
cial perception.”
Born in Salinas, Steinbeck be
came famous in the 1930’s for 1 his
novels and short stories about the
“common people” and the depres
sion. In 1940 his novel “Grapes of
Wrath” won him the Pulitzer
Prize.
While Steinbeck left Stanford
without receiving a diploma, he is
the first Stanford student to he
awarded a Nobel Prize.
Margery Baily, professor emeri
tus of English at Stanford and
one of Steinbeck’s English profes
sors, said that although she didn’t
think he is a “great writer,” nev
ertheless, in his works before
1940, he exhibited “an objective
but profound sympathy with his
subjects,”
Steinbeck is not taught here on
a regular basis, because as Assist
ant Professor Howard B. Franklin
commented, “It seems that he’s
not that good a writer.”
