ing overwhelmed the mountaintop monastery town of Tawang,
where the Dalai Lama once sought sanctuary from the Communists,
a spokesman announced yesterday. The occupation Wednesday of the
350-year-old holy Himalayan village, where 600 monks with shaven
heads had lighted butter in lamps and chanted prayers against the
‘'Godless invaders,” was the Chinese Communists’ biggest victory
in their border war with India.
“We shall never surrender.” Indian Prime Minister Nehru told
his Congress Party yesterday in the wake of the Communist ad
vance. “Irrespective of frequent reverses and setbacks, we will
strengthen our defenses and prepare for final victory.”
Shortly after the fall of Tawang was announced, the Communist

general of the Chinese Army, urging India to accept the cease-fire
plan offered by the Chinese government Wednesday and supported
by Russia.
