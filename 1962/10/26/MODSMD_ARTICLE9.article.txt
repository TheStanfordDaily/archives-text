# Speakers Disagree on Cuba
## 
### 
A cry for "one desperate voice
of reason” conflicted with the be
lief that “survival is more impor
tant than morality” at an informal
open discussion yesterday after
noon at Tresidder Union. The
forum on the Cuban crisis allowed
students to express their views
about the Cuban blockade.
Several speakers took the stand
that “life is the most important
value in the world,” and that “the
Cuban blockade brings man to the
precipice of war.” This attitude
was attacked on the basis that
“our national survival is threat
ened when temperamental revolu
tionaries control nuclear weap
ons.”
A well-known campus conserva
tive asserted that “it is immoral
for one government to impose
upon another an unwanted re
gime,” but that “the U.S. merely
no longer allows Mr. Khrushchev
to help Cuba.
Cuban representatives of the
Stanford United Nations ended
the discussion with a plea of
“leave us alone. We don't want
to invade your country.” These
words were followed by the stated
hope that the various speeches
would elicit student opinion in the
form of letters to Congressmen.
