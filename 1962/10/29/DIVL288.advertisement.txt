Another week begins,
and what better time
to consider slipping in
to R A to slip into one
of our new jackets.
And, from our vast
selection, you might
well consider this one
—a quilted nylon
number—warm and
easy-fitting for real
comfort. Reversible
too, black to blue or
black to olive. An
excellent choice for
cool campus nights
and for the snow
country later. 19.95
or 22.95 does it.
