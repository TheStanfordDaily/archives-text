### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Legislature last Thursflay pass- ;
od an amendment to (ho ASSU
By-laws establishing procedure
for University approval of over- ■
night functions.
LASSU’s act climaxed a con-!
ccrted attempt by the ASSU of- 1
fice, AWS, various living groups, I
and the Dean’s Office to provide |
a substitute for the blind and
blanket approval now granted to
overnight functions.
THK BY-LAW amendment re
quires the person in charge of an
overnight activity to submit an
application to the ASSU Vice i
President at least two weeks be
fore the scheduled overnight. The [
application must include:
• A planned schedule of pro- \
gram and entertainment.
• A description, from the man-1
ager of the facility involved, of
the accommodations available, [
unless a current copy of such a
description is already on file in j
the ASSU office as a result of an j
overnight previously held at the j
specified facility.
• The names, addresses, and i
telephone numbers of adult i
guests. ‘‘At least two suitable
couples shall be required as adult |
guests for a group of more than |
ten people; one couple may serve j
for a group of ten or less. . . . j
At least one week in advance of |
the party, the adult guests will i
be sent a letter outlining their |
functions. . . . An adult guest is i
primarily an honored guest and
secondarily a source of authori-1
ty.”
APPLICATIONS must he ap
proved by the ASSU, and this ap- j
proval endorsed by the Dean of ]
Students. For approval it is re-1
quired that “the men attending i
the party (be) registered Stan- j
ford students, faculty or alumni, j
In the event that there are male j
guests in the parly, the president I
of the group assumes response j
taility for the good conduct of all j
those male guests.”
The president and social chair
man of an organizing group also ■
boar individual responsibility for i
the good conduct of the party in
general.
The final article of the amend- j
merit, designed to cover special |
cases not already provided for, j
reads as follows:
“Small groups wishing to make I
(dans for overnight parties shall
carry out (he above policy in so I
far as it is applicable, including |
a written statement addressed to
the Vice President of ASSU with
copies to the President of AWS
and the Office of the Dean of
Students. The person in charge of
the party will have ultimate re
sponsibility over and above the
rest of the group.”
