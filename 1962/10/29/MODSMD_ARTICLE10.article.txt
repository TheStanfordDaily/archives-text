## Khrushchev Agrees To Dismantle Bases 
### 
WASHINGTON ( DPl)—Nikita
Khrushchev dramatically agreed
yesterday to tear down his Cuban
missile bases under United Na
tions inspection and President
Kennedy immediately hailed the
Soviet premier’s action as a
“statesmanlike” step toward

peace.
In a remarkable letter to the
President, Khrushchev appeared
to have agreed to all the steps
laid down by Kennedy for a solu
tion—or at least negotiations
looking toward a solution—of the
crisis that has hung war clouds
over the world for a week.
AT THE same time, Cuban
Premier Fidel Castro fired off a
demand that the United States
get out of its Guantanamo naval
base as one of five conditions he
posed for settling the crisis. He
also said “violations” of Cuban
air and naval space must stop.
Khrushchev also called for an
end to U.S. air surveillances of
Cuba. Although his language was
mild, he said such flights could
have “dangerous consequences.”
He said reasons should be given
for any more flights.
However, the United States
maintained its air surveillance,
as well as its naval blockade, of
Cuba to see that the bases actual
ly were dismantled. It also was
prepared to press for dispatch of
U.N. representatives to Cuba as
fast as possible.
KHRUSHCHEV told the Presi
dent he already had ordered his
officers in Cuba to stop building
missile bases, dismantle those al
ready built and return the weap
ons to Russia. In addition, he
agreed that U.N, representatives
should “certify” that steps had
been taken.
The Khrushchev letter was in
reply to a Kennedy message in
which the President said the
United States would end its naval
blockade of Cuba and give assur
ances of no invasion of the island
if Russia tore down its bases and
sent no more offensive arms to
Castro.
Khrushchev’s reply arrived at
the White House about noon
while the President was closeted
with his National Security Coun
cil. Ho promptly issued a state
ment without waiting for a full
translation by his experts, al
though an English version had
been made available by the press.
"I WELCOME Chairman
Khrushchev’s statesmanlike de
cision to stop building bases in
Cub a, dismantling offensive
* weapons and returning them to
I the Soviet Union under United
j Nations verification.” the Presi

dent said.
“This is an important and con
structive contribution to peace.”
He also promised to get in
touch with Secretary General
Thant of the United Nations
“with respect to reciprocal mea
sures to assure peace in the Ca
ribbean area.” The President had
told Khrushchev previously that
U.N. negotiations on a permanent
solution of the crisis could start
in New York almost immediately
if the Cuban bases were removed.
“IT IS MY earnest hope,” the
President said, “that the govern
ments of the world can, with a
solution of the Cuban crisis, turn
their urgent attention to the com
pelling necessity for ending the
arms race and reducing world
tensions.”
He said this applied to the War
saw-NATO pact confrontation, as
well as other areas of the world.
Khrushchev also brought up in
his letter what he said was a new
violation of Soviet air space by
an America n reconnaissance
plane. He said the incident oc
curred Sunday when one of the
planes flew across the Chukotka
Peninsula, Soviet territory closest
to Alaska.
REMINDING Kennedy that he
had promised no more U2 flights
over Russia, the premier asked
whether this was a “provocation”
and warned that such aircraft
could “easily be mistaken for a
bomber with nuclear weapons”
since the United States keeps
such bombers aloft at all times.

He also promised to get in
touch with Secretary General
Thant of the United Nations
“with respect to reciprocal mea
sures to assure peace in the Ca
ribbean area.” The President had
told Khrushchev previously that
U.N. negotiations on a permanent
solution of the crisis could start
in New York almost immediately
if the Cuban bases were removed.
“IT IS MY earnest hope,” the
President said, “that the govern
ments of the world can, with a
solution of the Cuban crisis, turn
their urgent attention to the com
pelling necessity for ending the
arms race and reducing world
tensions.”
He said this applied to the War
saw-NATO pact confrontation, as
well as other areas of the world.
Khrushchev also brought up in
his letter what he said was a new
violation of Soviet air space by
an America n reconnaissance
plane. He said the incident oc
curred Sunday when one of the
planes flew across the Chukotka
Peninsula, Soviet territory closest
to Alaska.
REMINDING Kennedy that he
had promised no more U2 flights
over Russia, the premier asked
whether this was a “provocation”
and warned that such aircraft
could “easily be mistaken for a
bomber with nuclear weapons”
since the United States keeps
such bombers aloft at all times.
WASHINGTON ( DPl)—Nikita
Khrushchev dramatically agreed
yesterday to tear down his Cuban
missile bases under United Na
tions inspection and President
Kennedy immediately hailed the
Soviet premier’s action as a
“statesmanlike” step toward

peace.
In a remarkable letter to the
President, Khrushchev appeared
to have agreed to all the steps
laid down by Kennedy for a solu
tion—or at least negotiations
looking toward a solution—of the
crisis that has hung war clouds
over the world for a week.
AT THE same time, Cuban
Premier Fidel Castro fired off a
demand that the United States
get out of its Guantanamo naval
base as one of five conditions he
posed for settling the crisis. He
also said “violations” of Cuban
air and naval space must stop.
Khrushchev also called for an
end to U.S. air surveillances of
Cuba. Although his language was
mild, he said such flights could
have “dangerous consequences.”
He said reasons should be given
for any more flights.
However, the United States
maintained its air surveillance,
as well as its naval blockade, of
Cuba to see that the bases actual
ly were dismantled. It also was
prepared to press for dispatch of
U.N. representatives to Cuba as
fast as possible.
KHRUSHCHEV told the Presi
dent he already had ordered his
officers in Cuba to stop building
missile bases, dismantle those al
ready built and return the weap
ons to Russia. In addition, he
agreed that U.N, representatives
should “certify” that steps had
been taken.
The Khrushchev letter was in
reply to a Kennedy message in
which the President said the
United States would end its naval
blockade of Cuba and give assur
ances of no invasion of the island
if Russia tore down its bases and
sent no more offensive arms to
Castro.
Khrushchev’s reply arrived at
the White House about noon
while the President was closeted
with his National Security Coun
cil. Ho promptly issued a state
ment without waiting for a full
translation by his experts, al
though an English version had
been made available by the press.
