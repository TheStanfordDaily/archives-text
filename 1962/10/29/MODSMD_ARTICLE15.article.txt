# Founding Grant

According to the Founding Grant of Stanford, “the University
shall forever be kept out of politics.” This and other sections of the
Founding Grant explicitly forbid “partisan political activity” on
campus. However, the Grant does not define “partisan.”
By the University’s definition partisan refers not only to issues
between political parties but also to clearly non-partisan issues
that cut across Democratic-Republican lines; civil rights, peace,
and nuclear testing.
Groups like the Forum for the Discussion of Non-violent
Alternatives to War may not take part in “activity” since they are
“partisan.” And in order for any group to hold meetings open to
non-members, the group must be registered within the Political
Union as a caucus. Even then, of course, only advocacy is per
mitted; activity is still verboten. The University has also defined
“activity” to include distribution of leaflets encouraging action
such as an organized protest.
Over the years, of course, the Founding Grant’s interpretation
has changed markedly. Less than ten years ago it was called
illegal to allow anyone representing a national political party to
speak on campus. Ever since that prohibitive interpretation was
modified, politicians from the far left and the far right have been
granted the privilege of a platform on University grounds.
