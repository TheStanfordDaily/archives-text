# Political Expression

Although Tresidcler Union may be a building of many valu
able uses, its most recent and prominent use is as a platform for
all sorts of dangerous radicals. Leftists, for instance. Students
who protest President Kennedy’s blockade of Cuba are being
allowed a free forum for speaking their views. They are even
being allowed to say in meetings open to the public that the
President’s action is immoral.

At noontime last Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, students
mounted the concrete slabs surrounding the Union tree installa
tions and started to harangue anyone stopping to listen. The size
of the crowds seems to vary from 75 to 150, a majority of whom
have appeared to support the blockade despite the views of most
of the speakers.

Friday’s program lasted for three hours of semi-spontaneous
discussion. When the group broke up at 3 p.m., nearly a dozen
speakers had been recognized by the graduate student coordinat
ing the discussion. Since the affair was not entirely spontaneous
but was in fact organized in order to protest the Kennedy foreign
policy, most of the speakers were opposed to a Cuban invasion
and even the present quarantine. Occasionally, an advocate of
blockade and invasion would rise to defend American policy.
The most amusing incident to date was the very brief heckling
of a leftist speaker by an elderly and distinguished gentleman who
happened by and could not resist the temptation to get in a
couple of good words for capitalism. As the speaker was dis
cussing some of the merits of Castroism, the gentleman strolled by,
overheard him, trudged over to the “free speech area” and re
minded the speaker to “tell them about the concentration camps.”
