Editor, The Daily:
Printed in yesterday’s Daily
(Thursday) was a report that, in
a poll taken of 2,116 students in
20 living groups, 1849 students
“din not favor” invasion of Cuba
(no qualification was given), and
that only 267 persons favored
such a move. I wish to bring to
the attention of Daily readers
that the question asked by the
pollsters was: “Do you think the
U.S. should invade Cuba immedi

ately.” The last word was em
phasized. Such a course of action,
obviously, could be precipitous,
and detrimental to the peace.
Most students, therefore, intelli
gently answered “no.” My own
observation has been, however,
that these students are generally
quite prepared to support such
an invasion if it becomes neces
sary to “dismantle or eliminate”
(Kennedy, Monday) the Cuban
IRBM bases.
