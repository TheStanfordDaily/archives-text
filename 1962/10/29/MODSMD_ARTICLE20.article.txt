Editor, The Daily:
A disturbingly ominous impli
cation of this government’s ac
tion in the Caribbean this past
two weeks, so far as 1 am able to
discern from the various anal
yses, has yet to be made explicit
to the American people. In effect,
the United States has now put
itself on record as basing its
policy on the recognition that nu
clear deterrence does not pre
clude, and in fact docs actually
encourage, military initiative in
the world to achieve political
goals. This is a recognition we
made long ago with regard to
Communist moves about the
globe, and political pressure in
this country to reverse the fact
of Communist initiative was one
good reason for bringing about
the present state of affairs with
regard to Cuba. The concept of
massive retaliation, then, has
been turned by both sides from a
preventative of piecemeal aggres
sion into an implement for its
dissemination. Each side now cal
culates moves which it would not
have made within the normal pre
nuclear power structure, based
on the belief that the opponent
will "back down’’ rather than
risk nuclear holocaust.
This illustrates why, even if
Kennedy's immediate objectives
are gained in the Cuban action,
this country and the entire world
stand to lose in the long run.
The official recognition of the use
of deterrence to sustain ultima
tums to a sovereign people, ac
cording to this analysis, sets a
precedent by which we either in
vite Russia to do the same when
she feels her security threatened,
or deter her from doing so. But
we have already observed that
the concept of massive retali
ation does not provide such a de
terrence; therefore the only al
ternative seems to be the appli
cation of the same concept of nu
clear deterrence to limited areas.
Thus Kennedy has in effect hand
ed new argumentative ammuni
tion to the proponents of a limit
ed nuclear capability.
According to cold rationality
this concept of a limited deter
rent force is correct, and will
prove wrong only because it re
fers to human beings rather than
to deductive automatons. The
concept of deterrence, carried to
its most irreducible factor of one
man who should recognize his
self-interest to the extent of tak
ing no overt action against an op
ponent, only postpones that even
tual episode when one man will
not recognize that self-interest.
In the meantime that one man
(whether it be a Castro or a Chi
ang Kai-shek) will have been fur
nished with an arsenal of "limit
ed” nuclear weapons with which
to strengthen his demands.
Thus Kennedy’s action in Cuba
portends a terrifying concatena
tion of events, and at the same
time strengthens the hand of
those pressure groups, in and out
of the Pentagon, which are doing
the most to bring that concatena
tion into being. The arguments
sustaining this direction of for
eign policy may be reduced to
this: if we can make Khrushchev
back down now, we can make
him (or for that matter anyone
else we don’t like) do it again in
the future. The American people
may thus be placed in the fearful
position of “winning” in Cuba at
the price of abdicating their pur
suit of a more permanent victory
through disarmament.

The Affiliations Division of the
Institute of International Rela
tions needs space badly. The pur
pose of this Division is twofold,
first that of affiliations of Stan
ford to the world, and second, an
increasing emphasis on affilia
tions at home, in which the at
tempt is to got the international
students associated with Stan
ford students.
The issue that developed be
tween myself and the Student Fi
nancial Manager, Fred Nelson,
was that Affiliations had no for
mal facilities because of the move
from the I-Shack into the new
Union. Fred Nelson promised one
desk, (perhaps more later) and
filing cabinets, when they arrive.
But meanwhile, the problem has
been that all of the 100 members
of the Area Desks are students,
and are pledged to three hours a
week (which we haven’t been
able to fulfill because of the lack
of facilities.) This time spent is
generally from 1-6 in the after
noon, and it has been impossible
to put people into the “overflow”
space in the new Union during
these hours.
What culminated the argument
was that in the old I-Shack there
were several desks not in use. I
told Charles Kendall to move one
into the Loft until our desk
(hopefully desks) arrives. Fred
Nelson, on the basis of the fact
that it was rather anaesthetic,
demanded that the desk be re
moved; I said no. Despite the
threat that the HR would be
charged the cost of having the
desk moved back into the I-Shack
(to collect dust), I have main
tained the position that the situa
tion is serious enough to warrant
the presence of "unaesthetic”
functional working conditions ...
