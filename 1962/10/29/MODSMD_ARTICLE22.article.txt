# EUROPE UNITED?
## Ideology, National Interest Led to Coal-Steel Community 
### DAVE KENNEDY UR Political Analyst 
When the French National Assembly rejected the European
Defense Community treaty in 1954, European federalists well rea
lized that all hopes for immediate formation of the proposed Euro
pean Political Community were shattered.
Federalists settled down for a long, painful effort to shape a

political union. What have been - *
their successes, and what is the
present outlook.?
TO ANSWER such questions,
it is well to examine the bases of
the original consensus that led to
the formation of the European
Coal and Steel Community
(ECSO in 1952. If the consensus
rested upon devotion to the Euro
pean ideal, to federalism and in
tegration as basic aims in them
selves, then political integration
would seem inevitable.
But if the consensus were the
result of a coincidence of the sep
arate national interests, in a cir
cumstance unlikely to be repeat
ed, then the likelihood of a fed
eralized Europe would be remote.
A scrutiny of European poli
tics in 1952 does not, unfortunate
ly, indicate which of the above
two explanations is correct. In
deed, it seems that both were true
to some degree, and the problem
becomes one of assigning relative
importance.
IT IS immediately obvious that
the “Christian” (i.e. Catholic)
parties in all of the six nations
were represented in the various
cabinets in 1952, and were in fact
the governing parties in all but
Holland and France. ToChristian-
Democrats in all countries, it was
clear that a new solution was
needed for the problems of an
ailing Europe. Integration seemed
a logical answer, and it was pro
vided with powerful doctrinal
support derived from Church tra
dition since Charlemagne, the
Holy Roman Empire, and Dante.
It would seem, therefore, that
the Christian-Democratic parties
throughout Europe reacted in a
common response to the ideologi
cal concept of a United Europe.
But this ideological commit
ment could not alone be suffici
ently persuasive to inspire the
national parliaments to ratify the
ECSC treaty. Each nation con
sidered the treaty, and indeed the
whole idea of European integra
tion in relation to its own nation
al interest.

Germany saw integration as a
means of removing Allied con
trols on steel production and coal
export, and of easing the restric
tions on amalgamation and car
tellization, traditions of German
big business.

FRANCE saw an effective
means of preventing a German
resurgence disproportionate to
the recovery of the rest of Eu
rope, and also a means of lessen
ing the urgency of German
claims to the troublesome Saar
region.
Italian need for investment
capital and for reduction of tar
iffs on sorely needed coal and
iron ore did much to sway De-
Gasperi’s parliament. Holland
saw that she must turn more at
tention to European markets aft
er the loss of Indonesia.

Hence, it was a wedding of ide
ological commitment derived
from a long Catholic tradition (It
is interesting to note that Mon
net, Schumann. Adenauer, DeGas
peri and Spaak—the foremost
voices of European unity—are
Catholics) with the exigencies of
national interest as briefly out
lined above, that led to the ratifi
fieation of the ECSC treaty, the
first step toward European inte
gration.
What has been the fate of these
two motives since 1952? On the
national political level, economic
prosperity and the many advan-

tages to various separate groups
have slowly but perceptibly add
ed strength to the basic ideologi
cal commitment to a United Eu
rope.

There has arisen no homogene
ous opposition to integration, and
even the parties of the left have
abandoned their previous con
demnation and have openly
voiced support for ESCS, Eurat
om, and EEC. An excellent ex
ample is Italy, where the Nenni
Socialists, originally bitterly op
posed to the ECSC treaty and to
any integration plans, have not
only adopted a position of sup
port but have even agreed to join
the Christian-Democrats, who are
philosophically committed to Eu
ropean integration.

ON A POPULAR level, the past
ten years have seen the educa
tion of a new European genera
tion that looks upon itself as “Eu
ropean” rather than Italian,
French or German. Such institu
tions as the College of Europe are
producing an articulate group of
dynamic young people who are
carrying the message of Euro
pean unity to their countries.

On the institutional level, 1958
saw a great step forward when
the Common Assembly of the
ECSC was smoothly transformed
into the European Parliamentary
Assembly, and the three execu
tives of ECSC, Euratom, and EEC
were made responsible to it.
This assembly is a truly supra
national body, with provisions for
membership by universal elec
tion. Its members are nearly all
federalists, and they act in close
co-operation with the three exec
utive “Authorities” to overcome
what have been called the “centri
fugal” forces working in the
Council of Ministers.

It is, however, in this Council
of Ministers that the real power
locus of the European Communi
ty lies. The various ministers are
each separately responsible to
their national governments. And
it is these national governments
that have displayed the greatest
inertia in the move to integration.
France in particular has shown
an annoying tendency to reap the
advantages of the common insti
tutions while still pursuing a uni
lateral policy of military develop
ment. She has shown a marked
reluctance to relinquish any sov
ereignty in the effort to give
more power to the supranational
institutions that men like Monnet
and Schumann, ironically of
French nationality, labored so
hard to erect.
Strong as are the economic ex
igencies for political union, per
vasive as is the ideological com
mitment among the young to a
United Europe, committed as are
the supranational assemblies to
the federal ideal, the move to po
litical integration now demands
greater political commitment by
the governments of Europe. With
out such a commitment, the ex
perience of the last ten years
could prove to he useless. In the
long sweep of history that has
been Europe’s, ten years is not
such a long time. Europe is now
in a trial stage, not irrevocably
committed to political federation.
It is conceivable that the oppor
tunity could be lost due to the
intransigence of conservative,
rightist reluctance to break out
of the confines of narrow nation
alist thought and to proceed
boldly to that political union
which vision and courage can
create for the benefit of the en
tire Atlantic Community.
