Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Community is an
important part of the University.
The citizens of the nearby towns
give much to Stanford and its
students and faculty, but on cer
tain occasions it seems as though
the people of the area, are re
ceiving more than the students,
who should perhaps be consider
ed. On Thursday afternoon and
Friday evening Stanford was able
to host two dance groups, spon
sored by Stanford organizations,
at no expense to the audience.
Unfortunately the majority of
the audience was not of the Stan
ford student body. One of the
primary purposes of bringing out
standing speakers and entertain
ment to Stanford is to give the
student, on a limited budget, the
chance to a cultural and intellec
tual experience that might not
be able to be had if tickets and a

trip to San Francisco were re
quired. The examples of the Tahi
tian and Thai dance groups are
not rare; they merely stand out
as happening two days in a row.
We don’t ask the University to
exclude the Stanford Community
or its citizens, but when the poli
cy is stated to check student body
cards, then let’s check them and
give Stanford students a mini
mum fighting chance to partake
in a valuable aspect of university
life.
As a final request to the fami
lies that attend these perform
ances, we understand your desire
to introduce your children to the
higher forms of entertainment,
but the appreciation level of a
chattering, or worse, a sleeping
child does not seem to merit a
seat over anyone, student or citi
zen. standing outside for two
hours waiting to he admitted.

Over the weekend about 100
Stanford faculty and staff mem
bers wired President Kennedy
“not to commit aggression
against Cuba,” to settle the prob
lem of Cuban missile bases “by
diplomatic negotiation” rather
than military action and not per
mit “our great nation to stand ac
cused ... as a reckless gambler
with humanity’s stake in surviv
al.” (Palo Alto Times, October
271
What is not recorded is that
the remaining members of the
staff either refused or were not
asked to sign such a telegram. I
was one of those who refused.
The telegram seemed to me to
presume to instruct the President
in a highly complex international
situation in which the signers did
not know all the relevant facts.
It also implied a moral judgment
against the United States which,
in the first place, was completely
debatable in view of the self de
fense issue involved and in the
second place tried to limit the
President's freedom of action in
a national emergency while leav
ing the Soviets and Cubans com
pletely free to do whatever they
pleased. It struck me as odd that
the signers believed they could
run American foreign policy
from behind academic desks,
without knowing, for example,
the answers to numerous key
questions. How largo and danger
ous was the Cuban missile build
up? Was it controlled by Cuban
or by Soviet nationals? What was
its possible relationship to events
in Berlin and elsewhere? Were
the signers willing to risk break
ing up NATO, with or without
the consent of its individual
members, for the sake of “diplo
matic negotiation”? And so on.
A general telegram of this sort
is simply meaningless. It is a
good example of a growing phe
nomenon which might be called
academic hubris.
As teachers we violently resent
any effort by retired admirals,
politicians, administrators, busi
men, professional educators, or
anyone else to tell us what to
teach or how. Academic freedom
is (properly in most cases) our
defense. Wo are likely to add that
only we understand what the
teaching situation requires. Many
of us seem to feel no hesitation,
however, in telling the other fel
low what to do in other fields
whether we understand the total
situation or not, as in the tele
gram under consideration. I am
quite aware of the rights of free
speech and protest, of course. But
the points in question are wheth
er we really know all the issues
connected with our protest, and
whether Kennedy and his advis
ers may not be better prepared
to deal with them, both in factual
knowledge and in political exper
ience, than we are.
Other examples of academic
hubris have turned up frequently
in the past week. No sooner had
the President given his “block
ade” speech than Linus Pauling
immediately excoriated him in
terms which no human being
should use to another, and which
would have given grounds for a
libel suit in any private context.

At that time Pauling did not
even know the relevant photo
graphs and the Russian admis
sions that subsequently came to
light. And on Thursday three of
our Stanford colleagues broad
cast over a Berkeley radio sta
tion (Palo Alto Times, October
26) an attack on American policy
which seems to have specialized
in describing it as preparing a
“blood bath” and “rape of the
revolution,” while Congress
frothed at the mouth “like rabid
dogs” and “thought up every
thing that a ghoul could do.”
Surely we have a right to expect
a more intellectually responsible
presentation of the intricacies of
the Cuban problem from men of
academic rank.
The most ludicrous, if well
meant, example of academic hu
bris has been given us by Ber
trand Russell in England. Writing
his intimate and not too impar
tial personal letters to Khrush
chev, Castro, and Kennedy, he
has in effect arrogated to himself
the position of unofficial ruler of
England while his mobe of non
violent marchers have battled vi
olently with the police protecting
the house of that country’s Prime
Minister. Mr. Russell, now 90
years old. knows nothing of what
is really going on, has seen none
of the evidence of Russian pene
tration of our hemisphere, and is
being used by Khrushchev for all
attainable propaganda purposes.
It would seem that a little more
humility in sticking to something
we as academic people under
stand and a good deal more faith
in our elected political leaders
might well bo in order. Our pri
mary obligation to society is ex
ploration and interpretation in
the areas of our teaching. The
fact that wo hold forth from lec
ture platforms in classrooms does
not make us demigods. As a pri
vate citizen every man is entitled
to his own opinion. As an organiz
ed and publicized pressure group
our obligation is to know before
wo speak, and then to speak wise
ly and temperately.
