## Papooses Handed First Loss by UCLA 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Three bad breaks and UCLA
Frosh quarterback Rod Sherman
were too much for the Stanford
Frosh to overcome, and the Bru
babes were 22-12 winners Satur
day in the Coliseum.
The bad breaks, in order, were
a clipping penalty which nullified

Ray Handley’s 55-yard punt re
turn, and two pass interference
penalties, one which gave the Bru
babes the ball on the one yard
line, from where they scored, and
a second which gave UCLA an
other chance after they missed
their third conversion. Given the
gift, they took advantage and put
the game out of reach.
SHERMAN ran and passed for
205 yards, looking like a future
Terry Baker in the process. He
passed for one touchdown, ran for
a pair of (wo-point conversions,
and drove the Brubabes downfield
for their other (wo scores. Seven
of his eight completions were to
end Bob Richardson, for 122 yards.
The first break of the game
fluttered from a referee’s pocket
as Handley was racing 55 yards
with a punt midway through
the first quarter untouched by
human hands, behind perfect in
terference. In fact, it was too
perfect, as an Indian was detected
clipping.
UCLA scored first. Sherman hit
Richardson with a 21-yard scoring
pass. With the extra point blocked,
the score was 6-0 shortly into the
second quarter.
UCLA again got the ball after
Stanford punted, and marched 72
yards in 10 plays. A pass inter
ference call on Stanford after a
Bruin receiver apparently stum
bled and fell, put the ball on the
one. Fullback Jack Blaine’s plunge
and Sherman’s conversion made
the score 14-0 at the half.
The Cards got on the scoreboard
early in the fourth quarter, hav
ing earlier failed to score after
fullback Glenn Myers almost sin
gle-handedly carrying the ball to
the UCLA one. Card second-string
quarterback Don Cook hit George
Lawson on a 24-yard aerial for the
score.
Blaine again struck paydirt for
the Bruins to make the score an
insurmountable 22-6. His 1-yard
plunge climaxed an 80-yard ad
vance in 11 plavs.
THE PAPOOSES tallied on the
last play of the game. Cook hit
Joe Miller behind two Uclan safe
tymen and Miller outsped them
over the last 30 yards of a 67-yard
scoring burst.
Stanford bright spots were the
running of Handley and Myers,
who each gained 60 yards, and the
passing of Cook, the only effective
aerial attack that Stanford has
shown in any of its three games.
