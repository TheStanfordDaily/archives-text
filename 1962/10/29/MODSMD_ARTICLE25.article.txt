# Long Distance Runners Lonely. Beat USC, UCLA
## 
### 
Stanford’s cross country team
had to grope its way through a
thick fog for four miles on a hilly
course, but still turned in a con
vincing win over USC and UCLA
in Los Angeles Saturday.
The triangular score was Stan
ford 29, UCLA 49, USC 49.
Consistent team running won
the race for the Indians. The Tro
jans captured first and third
places, but the first five Tribe
runners were within eight places
of each other, and won easily.
USC’s GREAT distance man,
Julio Marin, won handily with a
20:35 time. Stanford freshmap
Dave Deubner dueled with fresh
man Bruce Bess, former Califor
nia mile champ, in the last 100
yards. Deubner finally pulled
away to take second in 20:50.
The race was run on UCLA’s
brand new Westwood course.
Much of the course was gravel,
and there was hardly any level
ground at all. Naturally, this
tended to slow the runners down
a bit.
Indians Harry McCalla, Weym
Kirkland, Harlan Andrews, and
Paul Schlicke finished fifth, sixth,
seventh, and ninth, respectively.
This clinched it for the Cards,
since two of the USC men finished
well back.
STANFORD DOMINATED the
race early, with all seven runners
in front, paced by Schlicke, after
two miles. However, Marin then
made his move and slowly in
creased his lead to a 15 second
bulge at the finish.
The meet was a preliminary to
a Stanford - San Jose showdown
next Saturday with Cal and UCLA
at Berkeley., San Jose is the only
team that has given the Indians
any tough competition this year,
having beaten Stanford twice.
