# South Teams Sink SU Water Poloists Twice
## 
### 
Stanford’s highly reputed water
polo team got two unexpected
black eyes this weekend when it
lost games to USC and UCLA in
Los Angeles. Both victors out
played their reputations in beat
ing a Stanford team that had
been favored to win the AAWU
championship.
An 8-5 win Friday for the Tro
jans boosted their undefeated
league record to 3-0. It was close
at the half as the Trojans led 2-1;
(heir fast swimming defense had
held the Indians’ high scoring at
tack for the first 14 minutes.
Then, early in the second half,
some beautifully executed passes
and deflection shots in front of
Stanford’s goal produced three
scores for USC, making the score
5-2.
THE SCORE wasn’t the In
dians’ only problem at that point.
Several of their starters were in
foul trouble: in fact, Ron Kovas,
a forward, had accumulated his
limit of four fouls in the first
quarter. As it turned out, Marty
Hull, Stanford’s leading scorer,
fouled out midway in the third
period, and by the fourth quarter,
five of the seven first-stringers
were disqualified.
The Trojans capitalized, open
ing up an 8-3 lead and then coast
ed in as Stanfor d scored two goals
in the last few minutes.
THE TRIBE moved to West
wood on Saturday for what was
expected to be an easy win to
even up their weekend record,
since Cal had beaten UCLA and
Stanford had trounced Cal; but it
didn’t work out that way.
Throughout the game, the
Bruins concentrated on defense,
dropping off two men in front of
their goal whenever Stanford
had the ball in the offensive zone.
Their tactics were successful as
the Indians could hit on only 13
per cent of their' shots (3/241.
Meanwhile, UCLA maintained
a one-goal lead for most of the
first three quarters. Finally in
the fourth period, they went
ahead 4-2, and effectively stalled
out the rest of the game despite
Hull’s second goal of the day,
which made the score 4-3.
The two losses leave Stanford
tied with Cal for third at 1-2;
USC leads the AAWU and UCLA
is second. The Tribe gets a
chance to redeem itself this week,
with three games scheduled.
