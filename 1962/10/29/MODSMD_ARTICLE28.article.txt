# Interceptions, Aggressive Line Pace Tribe Over UCLA 17-7
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
LOS ANGELES- Take as ingre
dients six fumbles, six intercepted
passes and two high centers over a
would-be punter’s head and you’ve
baked last Saturday's Stanford-
UCLA football game. The pigskin
went back and forth like a tennis
ball, hut Stanford managed to win
convincingly 17-7 before 33,415 in
the Colliseum.
Stanford fumbled four times,
intercepted five passes, two more
than UCLA completed, and suf
fered through the two bad cen
ters. The utter futility of trying
to move the ball is apparent in
that two of the game’s three
touchdowns were scored by the
defense.
FRANK PATITUC'CI rambled
82 yards with a fumbled pitchout
for the game’s first score, and
Carl Jones outsped the whole
Stanford team, running hack A1
Curr’s fumble 81 yards for the
only Uclan touchdown.
Standout players in the game
were Stanford ends Patitucci and
Bob Howard, defensive backs Tim
Hansel and Dick Ragsdale, and
quarterback Steve Thurlow.
Patitucci scored a touchdown on

the fumble runback, intercepted a
pass, dropped Bruin quarterback
E'/.ell Singleton for a key loss and,
time after time, along with How
ard, either took out interference
or stopped the ball carrier on the
Bruin end sweep. Howard turned
in a whale of a defensive effort.
In general, it was the line play by
these two that caused the UCLA
passing game so much grief, as
at least three times Larry Zeno
threw the ball right to a Card
defender while trying to escape
from one or both of the two.
RAGSDALE intercepted two
passes and Hansel one, while
Thurlow, the offensive standout,
accounted for 40 yards rushing
and 91 passing.
Zeno started the Bruins out like
a house afire, running for 33 yards
the first three times he carried the
ball, but after moving the Bruins
34 yards on the ground, he in
explicably passed on a first down.
Ragsdale intercepted and Stanford
fans breathed a sigh of relief—
for one play.
J. D. Lodato hit the line and
fumbled the ball right back to the
Bruins on the 12. Then came Pati
tucci’s shocker. Zeno pitched out
to Kermit Alexander and the ball
went off his fingertips. Patitucci
picked it out of the air and chugg
ed 82 yards. A key block removed
two pursuers, and he simply out
ran the very swift Alexander to
the end zone. Stan Lindskog’s
placement was good for 7-0 with
only 3:35 gone in the game.
STANFORD MOUNTED one of
its few offensive drives of the
1962 football season late in the
first quarter, and 15 plays later,
Lindskog booted a 25-yard field
goal for a 10-0 advantage.
Only seconds later, Stanford
was on the move again. Two plays
after the kickoff, Hansel inter
cepted a pass and ran it back 27
yards to the UCLA 39. Five plays
later, the Cards had a first down
on the 14. Curr took a pitchout
and lost the ball when he was
tackled behind the line. Jones
grabbed the ball and outran Thur
low 81 yards to the goal. Zeno
converted and the score was 10-
7 at halftime.
Lindskog had saved what ap
peared a golden opportunity for
the Baby Blue midway through
the first quarter. On fourth down,
a bad pass from center went high
over his head from the 38 to the
12. He picked it up and kicked it
on the run 34 yards and out of
trouble.
THE SECOND HALF started
once again like a tennis match.
Lodato fumbled the kickoff after
returning it to the 35. The Uclans
were in business, but Howard

ended the threat on the 17 by
shooting the gap and dropping
Zeno for a five-yard loss.
Stanford and UCLA traded
punts, and Stanford started to
move from its own 11. Thurlow
completed three of three passes
for 28 yards and three first downs
in the 89 yard drive. John Paye’s
one yard plunge culminated the
drive six seconds into the fourth
quarter.
The Bruins squandered their
only scoring opportunity of the
last period. Another bad pass
from center on an attempted punt
put Lindskog in trouble, but he
chased the ball, which went off

his fingertips, and booted it like
a soccerball on the ground close I
to the sidelines, and booted it |
again as a Bruin prepared to;
scoop it up and run with it for j
the game’s third touchdown on ai
fumble recovery. The ball went
out of bounds on the 42.
ZENO DROVE the Baby Blue
to the 24, but on third down threw ;
the ball right into the aims of
Anthony DeLellis and that was
the game.
In the final analysis it was the!
Stanford pass defense that won
the game for the Big Rerl. UCLA
completed but three of 17 and j
five found their way into Stanford I
hands. The three completions I
were for 36 yards, but Stanford I
ran its interceptions back 50 j
yards.


THE QUICK-HITTING Stanford secondary gang tackled UCLA all
afternoon. Here Dick Ragsdale (12), Steve Purcell (80), Marv Harris
(68) and Tim Hansel (27) subdue a Bruin runner.

THE SECOND HALF started
once again like a tennis match.
Lodato fumbled the kickoff after
returning it to the 35. The Uclans
were in business, but Howard

ended the threat on the 17 by
shooting the gap and dropping
Zeno for a five-yard loss.
Stanford and UCLA traded
punts, and Stanford started to
move from its own 11. Thurlow
completed three of three passes
for 28 yards and three first downs
in the 89 yard drive. John Paye’s
one yard plunge culminated the
drive six seconds into the fourth
quarter.
The Bruins squandered their
only scoring opportunity of the
last period. Another bad pass
from center on an attempted punt
put Lindskog in trouble, but he
chased the ball, which went off

his fingertips, and booted it like
a soccerball on the ground close I
to the sidelines, and booted it |
again as a Bruin prepared to;
scoop it up and run with it for j
the game’s third touchdown on ai
fumble recovery. The ball went
out of bounds on the 42.
ZENO DROVE the Baby Blue
to the 24, but on third down threw ;
the ball right into the aims of
Anthony DeLellis and that was
the game.
In the final analysis it was the!
Stanford pass defense that won
the game for the Big Rerl. UCLA
completed but three of 17 and j
five found their way into Stanford I
hands. The three completions I
were for 36 yards, but Stanford I
ran its interceptions back 50 j
yards.

LOS ANGELES- Take as ingre
dients six fumbles, six intercepted
passes and two high centers over a
would-be punter’s head and you’ve
baked last Saturday's Stanford-
UCLA football game. The pigskin
went back and forth like a tennis
ball, hut Stanford managed to win
convincingly 17-7 before 33,415 in
the Colliseum.
Stanford fumbled four times,
intercepted five passes, two more
than UCLA completed, and suf
fered through the two bad cen
ters. The utter futility of trying
to move the ball is apparent in
that two of the game’s three
touchdowns were scored by the
defense.
FRANK PATITUC'CI rambled
82 yards with a fumbled pitchout
for the game’s first score, and
Carl Jones outsped the whole
Stanford team, running hack A1
Curr’s fumble 81 yards for the
only Uclan touchdown.
Standout players in the game
were Stanford ends Patitucci and
Bob Howard, defensive backs Tim
Hansel and Dick Ragsdale, and
quarterback Steve Thurlow.
Patitucci scored a touchdown on

the fumble runback, intercepted a
pass, dropped Bruin quarterback
E'/.ell Singleton for a key loss and,
time after time, along with How
ard, either took out interference
or stopped the ball carrier on the
Bruin end sweep. Howard turned
in a whale of a defensive effort.
In general, it was the line play by
these two that caused the UCLA
passing game so much grief, as
at least three times Larry Zeno
threw the ball right to a Card
defender while trying to escape
from one or both of the two.
RAGSDALE intercepted two
passes and Hansel one, while
Thurlow, the offensive standout,
accounted for 40 yards rushing
and 91 passing.
Zeno started the Bruins out like
a house afire, running for 33 yards
the first three times he carried the
ball, but after moving the Bruins
34 yards on the ground, he in
explicably passed on a first down.
Ragsdale intercepted and Stanford
fans breathed a sigh of relief—
for one play.
J. D. Lodato hit the line and
fumbled the ball right back to the
Bruins on the 12. Then came Pati
tucci’s shocker. Zeno pitched out
to Kermit Alexander and the ball
went off his fingertips. Patitucci
picked it out of the air and chugg
ed 82 yards. A key block removed
two pursuers, and he simply out
ran the very swift Alexander to
the end zone. Stan Lindskog’s
placement was good for 7-0 with
only 3:35 gone in the game.
STANFORD MOUNTED one of
its few offensive drives of the
1962 football season late in the
first quarter, and 15 plays later,
Lindskog booted a 25-yard field
goal for a 10-0 advantage.
Only seconds later, Stanford
was on the move again. Two plays
after the kickoff, Hansel inter
cepted a pass and ran it back 27
yards to the UCLA 39. Five plays
later, the Cards had a first down
on the 14. Curr took a pitchout
and lost the ball when he was
tackled behind the line. Jones
grabbed the ball and outran Thur
low 81 yards to the goal. Zeno
converted and the score was 10-
7 at halftime.
Lindskog had saved what ap
peared a golden opportunity for
the Baby Blue midway through
the first quarter. On fourth down,
a bad pass from center went high
over his head from the 38 to the
12. He picked it up and kicked it
on the run 34 yards and out of

explicably passed on a first down.
Ragsdale intercepted and Stanford
fans breathed a sigh of relief—
for one play.
J. D. Lodato hit the line and
fumbled the ball right back to the
Bruins on the 12. Then came Pati
tucci’s shocker. Zeno pitched out
to Kermit Alexander and the ball
went off his fingertips. Patitucci
picked it out of the air and chugg
ed 82 yards. A key block removed
two pursuers, and he simply out
ran the very swift Alexander to
the end zone. Stan Lindskog’s
placement was good for 7-0 with
only 3:35 gone in the game.
STANFORD MOUNTED one of
its few offensive drives of the
1962 football season late in the
first quarter, and 15 plays later,
Lindskog booted a 25-yard field
goal for a 10-0 advantage.
Only seconds later, Stanford
was on the move again. Two plays
after the kickoff, Hansel inter
cepted a pass and ran it back 27
yards to the UCLA 39. Five plays
later, the Cards had a first down
on the 14. Curr took a pitchout
and lost the ball when he was
tackled behind the line. Jones
grabbed the ball and outran Thur
low 81 yards to the goal. Zeno
converted and the score was 10-
7 at halftime.
Lindskog had saved what ap
peared a golden opportunity for
the Baby Blue midway through
the first quarter. On fourth down,
a bad pass from center went high
over his head from the 38 to the
12. He picked it up and kicked it
on the run 34 yards and out of
trouble.
THE SECOND HALF started
once again like a tennis match.
Lodato fumbled the kickoff after
returning it to the 35. The Uclans
were in business, but Howard

ended the threat on the 17 by
shooting the gap and dropping
Zeno for a five-yard loss.
Stanford and UCLA traded
punts, and Stanford started to
move from its own 11. Thurlow
completed three of three passes
for 28 yards and three first downs
in the 89 yard drive. John Paye’s
one yard plunge culminated the
drive six seconds into the fourth
quarter.
The Bruins squandered their
only scoring opportunity of the
last period. Another bad pass
from center on an attempted punt
put Lindskog in trouble, but he
chased the ball, which went off

his fingertips, and booted it like
a soccerball on the ground close I
to the sidelines, and booted it |
again as a Bruin prepared to;
scoop it up and run with it for j
the game’s third touchdown on ai
fumble recovery. The ball went
out of bounds on the 42.
ZENO DROVE the Baby Blue
to the 24, but on third down threw ;
the ball right into the aims of
Anthony DeLellis and that was
the game.
In the final analysis it was the!
Stanford pass defense that won
the game for the Big Rerl. UCLA
completed but three of 17 and j
five found their way into Stanford I
hands. The three completions I
were for 36 yards, but Stanford I
ran its interceptions back 50 j

LOS ANGELES- Take as ingre
dients six fumbles, six intercepted
passes and two high centers over a
would-be punter’s head and you’ve
baked last Saturday's Stanford-
UCLA football game. The pigskin
went back and forth like a tennis
ball, hut Stanford managed to win
convincingly 17-7 before 33,415 in
the Colliseum.
Stanford fumbled four times,
intercepted five passes, two more
than UCLA completed, and suf
fered through the two bad cen

to move the ball is apparent in
that two of the game’s three
touchdowns were scored by the
defense.
FRANK PATITUC'CI rambled
82 yards with a fumbled pitchout
for the game’s first score, and
Carl Jones outsped the whole
Stanford team, running hack A1
Curr’s fumble 81 yards for the
only Uclan touchdown.
Standout players in the game
were Stanford ends Patitucci and
Bob Howard, defensive backs Tim
Hansel and Dick Ragsdale, and
quarterback Steve Thurlow.
Patitucci scored a touchdown on

the fumble runback, intercepted a
pass, dropped Bruin quarterback
E'/.ell Singleton for a key loss and,
time after time, along with How
ard, either took out interference
or stopped the ball carrier on the
Bruin end sweep. Howard turned
in a whale of a defensive effort.
In general, it was the line play by
these two that caused the UCLA
passing game so much grief, as
at least three times Larry Zeno
threw the ball right to a Card
defender while trying to escape
from one or both of the two.
RAGSDALE intercepted two
passes and Hansel one, while
Thurlow, the offensive standout,
accounted for 40 yards rushing
and 91 passing.
Zeno started the Bruins out like
a house afire, running for 33 yards
