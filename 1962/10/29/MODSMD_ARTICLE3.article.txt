### PAGE EDWARDS 
Demonstrations, both admon
ishing and praising the United
States foreign policy, held in
front of the Civic Center in San
Francisco Saturday were orderly
and sincere outcries of the Ameri
can people.
At 10:50 a.m. Saturday, a group
of Cuban immigrants marched
around Union Square carrying
signs, “Cuban mothers are for
Kennedy” and “We are behind
anything Kennedy does.” The
group led by three children carry
ing the Cuban flag marched from
the square down Powell street
onto Market to the Civic center.
A few onlookers along the way
applauded.
CROSSING McAllister, voices
from two public address systems
could be heard.
The Cubans, men women, and
children about 350 in all closed
• ranks and approached a small
j group of Pro-Blockade demon
j strators.
Across the park, approximately
| 1,500 peace demonstrators spoke
; calmly and unemotionally against
j the blockade, invasion and war.
THE CUBANS began their
j chant “We're for Kennedy.” A
Cuban mother, fired with omo
| lion and enthusiasm, introduced
j the Cuban delegation to the Pro
j Blockade group.
From across the park, the quiet
orderly crowd heard calm speak
' ers quote the Pope and Bertrand
j Russell, “If you love life demon
strate now.” Peace demonsrators
I presented well organized and
carefully conceived appeals to
j “save humanity.” Among the
i speakers was John Howard, a
i Stanford graduate in sociology.
, Howard gave a sincere analysis
of the blockade and its effects.
The gayly colored signs from
I the Pro-Blockade side read: “I’d

rather smoke a Red Havana than
a White Owl” and “Cubans want
Freedom.”
SIGNS IN THE peace contin
gent read: “We need Russell,”
“No War” and “Stop.”
In the Pro-Blockade area, a
red-eyed, boarded young man
from the other camp was speak
ing to a well-dressed, elderly lady
on “parasitic capitalism,” “In my
23 years,” said the man, “I have
probably had my eyes open more
than you have in ever how many
years you have been alive.” Other
personal debates-drew small curi
ous crowds.
