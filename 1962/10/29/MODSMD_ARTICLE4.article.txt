PARIS French President Charles dc Gaulle, who had staked
his future on the outcome, appeared headed for another victory at
the polls Sunday in a nationwide referendum to decide whether
France should break with tradition and elect its presidents by direct
popular vole.
De Gaulle had vowed to resign unless the plan was approved.
“Vote for me or I go,” is what de Gaulle, in effect, told the nation.
He took office in 1959 for a scheduled seven year term.
Faced with this threat, French voters were supporting him on
the basis of the early returns. A ministry of interior spokesman said
“the vote is running about 65 per cent” for de Gaulle. But in the
fourth referendum in De Gaulle’s four years as President it ap
pealed that at least 25 per cent of the total electorate failed to ballot.
RED CHINESE OPEN NEW FRONT NEW DELHl—Hordes of
Chinese Communist troops opened a new fighting front in the west
ern sector of the Sino-Indian border yesterday. At the same time, an
Indian Government spokesman emphatically denied there was any
truth to persistent rumors that Indian Defense Minister V. K. Krish
na Menon was stepping down from his post. Krishna Menon, long
time friend of the Peiping regime, has recently come under heavy
criticism. The spokesman said the Reds expanded the undeclared
border war to the Damchok region of southern Ladakh with attacks
in “considerable strength” against three or four Indian posts. He
said the Indian forces hurled back all but one of (he assaults.

THANT WILL GO TO CUBA— UNITED NATIONS—U.N. Acting
Secretary General Thant yesterday accepted Premier Fidel Castro’s
invitation to come to Havana tomorrow to discuss the Cuban crisis.
Thant will take along a number of aides, some of whom he proposes
to have remain in Cuba after he returns to New York, a U.N.
spokesman said.

Union. Now that philosophy has
conquered Cuba.
But in the nuclear age the U.S.
cannot support and defend the
victims of Communist expansion
without running the risk of global
annihilation. That is our dilemma,
he said.

PARIS French President Charles dc Gaulle, who had staked
his future on the outcome, appeared headed for another victory at
the polls Sunday in a nationwide referendum to decide whether
France should break with tradition and elect its presidents by direct
popular vole.
De Gaulle had vowed to resign unless the plan was approved.
“Vote for me or I go,” is what de Gaulle, in effect, told the nation.
He took office in 1959 for a scheduled seven year term.
Faced with this threat, French voters were supporting him on
the basis of the early returns. A ministry of interior spokesman said
“the vote is running about 65 per cent” for de Gaulle. But in the
fourth referendum in De Gaulle’s four years as President it ap
pealed that at least 25 per cent of the total electorate failed to ballot.

said the Indian forces hurled back all but one of (he assaults.

THANT WILL GO TO CUBA— UNITED NATIONS—U.N. Acting
Secretary General Thant yesterday accepted Premier Fidel Castro’s
invitation to come to Havana tomorrow to discuss the Cuban crisis.
Thant will take along a number of aides, some of whom he proposes
to have remain in Cuba after he returns to New York, a U.N.
spokesman said.

Union. Now that philosophy has
conquered Cuba.
But in the nuclear age the U.S.
cannot support and defend the
victims of Communist expansion
without running the risk of global
annihilation. That is our dilemma,
he said.
