By JOHN K. BONINE
University of Colorado students
voted approximately 2000 to 900
against a resolution to censure
university President Quigg New-1
ton for his action in dismissing |
Gary Allhen, 21, from his post as I
editor of the Colorado Daily, said !
student body President Ardus j
Gaither in an interview yesterday. |
Gaither said the unofficial ref- j
erendum, which was completed j
last Thursday, failed because it j
was “worded in a very loaded I
fashion” and because “a rather ]
impetuous group of students”
tried to conduct it outside of the j
Associated Students organization. |
ALTHOUGH most of the stu-1
dents supported Newton’s dismis- !
sal of Alt hen, Gaither said, there I
was some objection to the man- |
nor in which it was done,
220(1 students jammed the Glenn j

Miller ballroom of the university’s
Memorial Center, Tuesday, to hear
Newton.
Newton said he had fired editor
Alt hen for “acts of editorial irre
sponsibility” in publishing articles
attacking Son. Barry Goldwater,
former President Dwight D. Eisen
hower, and President Kennedy.
Goldwater charged that the arti
cle in which he had been called a
“murderer” was libelous. Both i
articles were written by Carl A.
Mitcham. 21, from Dallas, Texas.
NEWTON said earlier that Al
then was “not qualified” to be
editor because of his printing of
the second Mitcham article after
having been admonished for the
first. It was in the second article
that Mitcham called Eisenhower
an “old futzer ”
The editor’s acts. Newton said j
in his speech Tuesday, “have dam-1

aged the university and . . . we
cannot risk further damage by
permitting the editor to retain his
position.”
While noting his intention to
protect academic freedom at CU,
Newton warned: “The banner of
academic freedom must not be
debased by misusing it to justify
irresponsible actions which endan
ger the university.”
HE ADDED, “The fundamental
motive of my actions in this case
is to protect your academic free
doms, not diminish them. I want
more student participation in uni
versity administration, not less.
But I want it in the hands of re
responsible students, and so must
you.”
Gaither said that Newton’s
speech “didn’t change anyone’s
mind” because most of the stu
dents already supported Newton.
