# Professors Analyze America's Position In Cuban Situation
## 
### PAUL RICCI 
The Cuban situation was explor-!
Ed I'riday by a panel composed of j
three Stanford professors, Jan F. j
Triska, John Johnson, and Robert
C. North. Each took up that aspect
of the situation which coincided
with his specialty. The moderator
was Professor Robert Horn of the
Political Science Department.
Horn set the tone of the dis
cussion by recalling Abraham
Lincoln’s observation that crises
would be so much easier to handle
if we first knew “where we are
and whither we are tending.”
JOHNSON, who spoke first, is
from the History Department and
specializes in Latin American his
tory. He outlined what he thought
would be the effects of the Presi
dent’s move upon the Latin Amer
ican countries.
In his opinion the Cuba quaran
tine is not only bound to weaken
the Organization of American
States but will also cause Cuban
youth to rally around Castro,
their defender against the Yankee
Colossus. Any invasion of Cuba
would prove to be a blood bath
because the Cubans will fight, he
said.
TRISKA, who spoke next,
brought to the topic his extensive
knowledge of international law
and of Soviet foreign policy.
In his opinion Khrushchev was
caught by surprise by Kennedy,
and the Soviet Premier’s reaction
I was predictable. Triska also hy
pothesized that Khrushchev may
be thinking in terms of “spheres
jof interest.” Since we did not
I threaten his sphere of interest in
j Hungary, ho sees no immediate
I need to threaten our sphere of
j interest in Cuba, Triska said.
IN NORTH'S analysis, we have
been living in a dilemma which
the Cuban situation has suddenly
brought to a sharp focus. For
years now the U.S. has been op
posed to the expansionist, de
structive philosophy of the Soviet
