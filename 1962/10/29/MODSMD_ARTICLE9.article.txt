# Drinking Or Possession Violates Liquor Policy
## 
### 
in accordance with the Funda
mental Standard and University
policy. Men’s and Women's Coun
cils would like to emphasize that
drunkenness, drunken and disor
derly conduct, and drunken driv
ing are sufficient grounds for
suspension from the University.
This holds regardless of the place
of consumption.
Possession or consumption of
liquor on campus by any student
is also a violation of the Stan
dard. Each case will receive in
dividual consideration with the
Council reserving the right to re
view the decisions of subordinate
councils.
Peter Hoglund, Men’s Council,
said “Violations of the Funda
mental Standard that come up be
fore Men’s Council will be en
forced in a manner consistent
with the above statement of poli
cy.”
