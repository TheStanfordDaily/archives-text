# Wright Says De Gaulle Made Political Error
## 
### HICK SEIFERT 
Cordon Wright, Stanford Professor of European History, said
yesterday that Freneh President Charles de Gaulle made a stra
tegic blunder in placing the issue of electoral reform before the
French electorate without first submitting the proposal to the
French Parliament. Wright said that “France may pay heavily

for this mistake in de Gaulle's i
strategy.” If the French Presi
dent fails to get a supporting,
Parliament in next month’s elec-1
tions, the political tension in |
France is certain to mount, bring-!
ing either the dissolution of Par- i
liamenl by de Gaulle or the Gen-1
eral’s abdication from office,
Wright added,
THE HISTORIAN went on to
say that de Gaulle was right in
advocating a change in the proc
ess of electing the head of the
state, but that his method of
achieving his end was wrong.
Wright said that the President
could have first submitted his
proposal to the Parliament as an
amendment to the Constitution.
Had he then failed to gain the
necessary two-thirds approving
vote from the legislature, the
President could have turned to
the referendum procedure as a
last resort.
By circumventing the Parlia
ment, Wright said, de Gaulle
"flouted his own constitution”
and forced every political party
in France, with the exception of
his own. to oppose him.
Commenting on the results of
Sunday’s vote, in which de Gaulle
won 62 per cent of the votes cast,
the French historian said that
according to de Gaulle sources
before the election, any voter ap
proval of more than 60 per cent
would be considered a "success”
by the President’s political camp
as opposed to the “triumph” label
that had been attached to a larg
er approving percentage. Wright
noted that it was significant that
the one area of Franco voting
against de Gaulle was the South
west, stronghold of the Left.
WRIGHT added that few
Frenchmen were actually voting
on the issue of electing a Presi
dent by popular vote, but instead
they were voting on de Gaulle’s
popularity by virtue of the Pres
ident’s own threat to retire.
Wright concluded by saying
that de Gaulle’s majority was
small enough to be encouraging
to French political parties facing
(he November elections. The sup
port of the President was not
strong enough to exclude the pos
sibility of their gaining enough
votes to defeat de Gaulle, he
added.
