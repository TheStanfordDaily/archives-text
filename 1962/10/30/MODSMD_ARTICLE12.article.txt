# Successful Diplomacy

### 
As the threat of war has finally subsided after a week of acute
danger, the success of President Kennedy’s Cuban policy is be
coming apparent. He has taken a “hard” line in Cuba, not the
hardest line of all the alternative actions, hut still a forceful stand.
His policy has had unquestionable success in attaining the objec
tive's for which it was designed. No further offensive arms will be
brought into Cuba, and the Soviet Union has indicated its inten
tion to dismantle its MRBM and IRBM sites.
It is unlikely that a softer line on Cuba would have produced
an equally decisive diplomatic victory. Just as any measure short
of blockade would have diminished the diplomatic coup, so too
would have any measure beyond blockade.
An invasion might have and might still depose Castro, but an
attack on Cuba would certainly have been a military action
offending the non-aligned nations. The advantages vis-a-vis the
liabilities of an invasion are difficult to assess. But it is not diffi
cult to see that an invasion would have been a diplomatic misfor
tune relative to the diplomatic success of the blockade. Apparent
ly, blockade and the threat of invasion have accomplished the
President’s purpose, making recourse to war unnecessary.
The diplomatic failure of invasion might have been worth the
military victory of invasion, yet the President’s objectives have
been accomplished without a bloody war. Everyone who sup
ported Mr. Kennedy’s limited objectives (removing all offensive
missiles from Cuba) must admit the brilliant success of his policy
over the past week. And everyone who advocated more ambitious
objectives (deposing Castro) must content himself with the suc
cess of the President’s more limited policy.
