Editor, The Daily:
I do not like to engage in pub
lic controversy with a friend and
departmental colleague. But Pro
fessor Paul Kocher's letter of Oc
tober 29 defines the academic ob
ligation in away which seems to
me dangerously narrow, and re
pugnant to one of the great tra
ditions of the modern university.

This is the tradition that the
university community (in away
difficult for the business commu
nity, for instance) should bring
to bear on public life a reasoned,
disinterested, critical flow of
thought, and should do every
thing in its power to substitute
moral choice and coolness for
brutal realism in public affairs.
It should for instance bring to
bear the historian’s long view of
the nature of crisis. According to
this tradition the close filiations
that exist in England between Ox
ford, “The London Times” and
the British Cabinet, or between
Harvard and Washington today,
are normal rather than deviant
parts of the political process.

PROFESSOR Kocher on the
contrary seems to share the posi
tion taken by the most conserva
tive part of the business commu
nity: that the university should
remain an ivory tower inhabited
by specialists. In even larger
terms he seems to propose that
public opinion should have no
part in the decisions taken by the
nation’s leaders in times of crisis.
Professor Kocher’s most famil
iar argument is that the Presi
dent and his advisers are possess
ed of factual knowledge which
we do not share. It is true
given the double-talk and double
think of international exchange,
and the rhetoric of poker and
computer—that it was impossible
for us to know the exact nature
of the crisis, and whether the
real issue was in Cuba, Berlin or
elsewhere. I suspect we still do
not know. But in this connection
I would note several things:
i) The telegram did not pro
pose specific political advice, hut
merely urged negotiation as an
alternative to invasion. The gen
eral purpose of our telegram was
to propose, on behalf of a size
able group of academic people,
coolness and restraint. In this
connection I propose that it is al
ways within the legitimate prov
ince of any citizen to pass moral
judgment on his government,
even though that judgment be
misinformed.

ii) The presidential adviser in
hours of crisis and overburden
may find it difficult to think with
desirable detachment, and might
benefit by restraining influences.
Of the two presidential advisers
known to me personally, one—a
man whom in other contexts I
greatly admire—is known to be

“gambler.” He is also, to judge
by a recent television appearance,
in a state of serious and advanced
fatigue.
iii) The argument that only the
‘insider’ is capable of accurate
political judgment has always
been used in support of unpopu
lar or seemingly perverse posi
tions. It was, for instance, the ar
gument constantly used to sup
port the State Department’s
Vichy policy, with its assumption
that General De Gaulle could
never become an important po
litical force in post-war France.
It was the argument used in de
fence of friendly policies toward
Batista and Trujillo. It was the
insider’s view, held until a few
days before the 1959 takeover—
that Fidel Castro could never
come to power in Cuba.
It appears we have survived
this crisis. It moreover appears
that we shall have to live with
Fidel Castro (if we honor our
October 27 engagement) until in
ternal overthrow or assassination
ends his career. But there will be
other crises in Latin-America de
manding thoughtful and inform
ed response. We shall have to
learn to tolerate the emergence
of left-of-center governments in
Latin-America, and the broad im
pulse to social change, and we
shall have to respond in such a
way as to discourage these left
of-center governments from be
coming Soviet satellites. We
shall, minimally, have to develop
a new pattern of consultation not
only with official representatives
of the O.A.S. but with pro-Amer
ican liberals who are not present
ly in office and who are therefore
all the freer to advise us candidly.
We shall have to develop sources
of information more responsible
than the C.I.A. concerning Latin-
American economics and Latin-
American sensibilities.

IN ALL THIS, I suggest, the
academic community should as
sume leadership, and Stanford
especially, with its Hispanic-
American Center and with its
other experts in Latin-American
affairs. For if there is any one
provable proposition concerning
governmental knowledge and ig
norance, it is that Washington
has shown itself chronically inept
in its assessment of this region.
It has consistently misunderstood
both Latin-American aspirations
and the hard facts of Latin-Amer
ican political institutions.

Professor Kocher is correct in
suggesting that it would be de
sirable to know how many re
fused to sign the telegram as well
as how many signed it. In our
own department ten full profes
sors agreed to sign the telegram.
Two declined.
