## Stegner's 'Wolf Willow' Reveals Paradox of the Plains 
### ROSALIND GREENE 
“Wolf Willow,” by Wallace Stegncr: The Viking Press, Inc.,
307 pages, $5 95.

Nowadays them’s a lot of talk of frontiers. The old frontier, the
new frontier, the lost frontier, the scientific frontier, the internation
al frontier (a Woman’s League for the Promotion of an Afro-Ameri
can Cultural Frontier hovers as the inevitable next step). “Wolf
Willow” by Wallace Stegner is about a last frontier, “A History, a

Story, and a Memory of the Last-*
Plains Frontier.” It is about a ter
ritory just above the Canadian
border called Cypress Hills, and
about away of life in a prairie
town above Montana called
Whitemud, and it is about the
men who tried to make a go of it
there.
IT IS AN exciting history, par
tially because it happened so fast
-—“ From grizzlies, buffalo, and
Indians ... to Dust Bowl and
near de-population” in only about
sixty years—and partially be
cause there are men still alive
who remember almost the whole
of it. It is exciting because it was
full of difficulties and human
hardship, and these are always
principal sources of human inter
est. Sometimes, it is unimportant
where the fact ends and fiction
begins, and Fenimore Cooper’s
Indians and the Royal Mounties
and Silting Bull might all seem
to get buried in the same snow
storm. But as a point of fact, Mr.
Stegner admits that not only did
the imagined romantic heroes of
the Plains exist in the lore of the
town, but they actually provided
a pattern of behavior for the men
and boys to match and live up to.
The narrative is sometimes
simply a factual chronicle of this
expedition or that settlement, or
an account of how one Canadian
treaty with the Sioux was honor
ed while an American treaty
shamefully was not. All these
events Mr. Stegner reports most
soberly and properly. But it is his
personal recollections, the trans
lation onto these pages of his own
experiences as a boy in a frontier
town that make the writing come
alive. John Updike has said that
when “the private game of fitting
life into language, or fitting
words to things” fascinates the
writer sufficiently, we are
brought into his sphere of exper
ience, and we will be fascinated.
Mr. Stegner has a keen sense of
honesty, and his narrative and
dialogue allow us an awareness,
a recognition of what the experi
ence of life in the hinterlands
must have been, must still be for
that matter.
HE ASKS: “How does one
know in his bones what this con
tinent has meant to Western man
unless he has . . . made trails
and paths on an untouched coun
try and built human living places,
however transitory, at the edge
of a field that he helped break
from prairie sod? How does one
know what wilderness has meant
to Americans unless he has
shared the guilt of wastefully and
ignorantly tampering with it in
the name of Progress?” And
surely it is true that the concepts
of freedom, of wilderness, of a
place to make a new beginning
are basic to the American char
acter, and that a loss of these as
physical realities is one of the
ironies of our national develop
ment.
There is more than a little nos
talgia in Wallace Stegner’s back
ward glance to his boyhood, a
sweetness in his memories that
rises from more than the smell
of wolf willow blooming at the
river's edge, an identity with the
frontier and its lore that extends
easily from the adventures of the
cowboys on the Plains to the me
morabilia found at the town
dump. Still, it’s something of a
paradox. The Plains which en
couraged freedom and individual
ity in their sons, trapped and
frustrated the homesteaders in
their attempt to make a decent
life there.

town above Montana called
Whitemud, and it is about the

there.

personal recollections, the trans
lation onto these pages of his own
experiences as a boy in a frontier
town that make the writing come
alive. John Updike has said that
when “the private game of fitting
life into language, or fitting
words to things” fascinates the
writer sufficiently, we are
brought into his sphere of exper
ience, and we will be fascinated.
Mr. Stegner has a keen sense of
honesty, and his narrative and
dialogue allow us an awareness,
a recognition of what the experi
ence of life in the hinterlands
must have been, must still be for
that matter.
HE ASKS: “How does one
know in his bones what this con
tinent has meant to Western man
unless he has . . . made trails
and paths on an untouched coun
try and built human living places,
however transitory, at the edge
of a field that he helped break
from prairie sod? How does one
know what wilderness has meant
to Americans unless he has
shared the guilt of wastefully and
ignorantly tampering with it in
the name of Progress?” And
surely it is true that the concepts
of freedom, of wilderness, of a
place to make a new beginning
are basic to the American char
acter, and that a loss of these as
physical realities is one of the
ironies of our national develop
ment.
There is more than a little nos
talgia in Wallace Stegner’s back
ward glance to his boyhood, a
sweetness in his memories that
rises from more than the smell
of wolf willow blooming at the
river's edge, an identity with the
frontier and its lore that extends
easily from the adventures of the
cowboys on the Plains to the me
morabilia found at the town
dump. Still, it’s something of a
paradox. The Plains which en
couraged freedom and individual
ity in their sons, trapped and
frustrated the homesteaders in
their attempt to make a decent
life there.
