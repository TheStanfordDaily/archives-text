## 'Kingston Trio Tragic Reminder Of Tin Pan Alley' 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
The Kingston Trio is a tragic
reminder of the omnivorous
ghost of Tin Pan Alley that never
ceases to haunt contemporary
folk music.
In the fall of 1959 the Kingston
three rose up and took a recep
tive public by storm with songs
like “Coplas” and “MTA.” In
three years they did more than
the popularizing Weavers had
been able to do in ten; they took
campus after campus by storm,
overwhelmed the juke boxes with
45 rpm singles, and triumphed
over topical comedians and torch
singers in countless night clubs
across the country.
AT THE SAME time they did
their homework: taking a cue
from Harry Belafonte, they main
tained a research staff and voice
teachers to dredge up ethnic
songs with wide appeal and in
fused them with the unmistak
able boisterous Kingston tenor.
But as they found themselves
competing with other groups
whose success they had made pos
sible, the Trio began to depend
more and more on a thinly dis
guised rock-and-roll style. Per
haps this is all for the best:
thousands of high school and col
lege students seem to have given
them up in favor of more endur
ing singers. And the vocal style
and chordings of the Trio’s later
albums have provided a bridge
by which many talented guitar
ists have given up rock-and-roll
for the wider horizons of folk
music.
But it is evident that the King
ston Trio has nearly gone under
as anything more than a quietly
persisting landmark. Their latest
Capitol album, “Something Spe
cial,” (T 1747), is a last gasp.
WHAT IS special about the re
cording is that we now have the
Kingston Trio supported by
massed orchestra and chorus. As
one might expect, there is not a
single word on the songs them
selves, only a lot of self-congratu
lations on the large-scale ar
rangements.
Most of the record is as sterile
as an echo chamber. If the Trio
is not fitting venerable spirituals
into a ghastly Chubby Checker
format, they dissolve into an ane
mic sentimentality. The only re
minder of the old Kingston sound
is "Away Rio”; hut with the chor
al background we might just as
well be singing along with Mitch.
The Grand Ole Opry fiddling
behind “Old Joe Clark” is effec
tive; but here the Kingstons can
not maintain the mood set by the
accompaniment.
HOWEVER, the real question
is, what can anyone learn from
it? Folk music appeals to our
generation because it tends to
take popular song out of the
hands of an entertainment-indus
try priesthood and to turn every
man into his own music-maker. It
is in a sense tragic to see three
singers of a certain folk talent
swallowed up by massed orches
-1 tra and chorus.

three years they did more than
the popularizing Weavers had
been able to do in ten; they took
campus after campus by storm,
overwhelmed the juke boxes with
45 rpm singles, and triumphed
over topical comedians and torch
singers in countless night clubs
across the country.
AT THE SAME time they did
their homework: taking a cue
from Harry Belafonte, they main
tained a research staff and voice
teachers to dredge up ethnic
songs with wide appeal and in
fused them with the unmistak
able boisterous Kingston tenor.
But as they found themselves
competing with other groups
whose success they had made pos
sible, the Trio began to depend
more and more on a thinly dis
guised rock-and-roll style. Per
haps this is all for the best:
thousands of high school and col
lege students seem to have given
them up in favor of more endur
ing singers. And the vocal style
and chordings of the Trio’s later
albums have provided a bridge
by which many talented guitar
ists have given up rock-and-roll
for the wider horizons of folk
music.
But it is evident that the King
ston Trio has nearly gone under
as anything more than a quietly
persisting landmark. Their latest
Capitol album, “Something Spe
cial,” (T 1747), is a last gasp.
WHAT IS special about the re
cording is that we now have the
Kingston Trio supported by
massed orchestra and chorus. As
one might expect, there is not a
single word on the songs them
selves, only a lot of self-congratu
lations on the large-scale ar
rangements.
Most of the record is as sterile
as an echo chamber. If the Trio
is not fitting venerable spirituals
into a ghastly Chubby Checker
format, they dissolve into an ane
mic sentimentality. The only re
minder of the old Kingston sound
is "Away Rio”; hut with the chor
al background we might just as
well be singing along with Mitch.
The Grand Ole Opry fiddling
behind “Old Joe Clark” is effec
tive; but here the Kingstons can
not maintain the mood set by the
accompaniment.
HOWEVER, the real question
is, what can anyone learn from
it? Folk music appeals to our
generation because it tends to
take popular song out of the
hands of an entertainment-indus
try priesthood and to turn every
man into his own music-maker. It
is in a sense tragic to see three
singers of a certain folk talent
swallowed up by massed orches
-1 tra and chorus.
The Kingston Trio is a tragic
reminder of the omnivorous
ghost of Tin Pan Alley that never
ceases to haunt contemporary
folk music.
In the fall of 1959 the Kingston
three rose up and took a recep
tive public by storm with songs
like “Coplas” and “MTA.” In
