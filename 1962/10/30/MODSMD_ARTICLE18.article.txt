Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Kocher’s intelligent and
well formulated letter of Get. 29
appears to be an example of a
growing reluctance on the part of
many citizens to express their
opinions on matters of public
policy.
In the past few weeks I have
heard several faculty members
say “They don’t want to tell
others how to vote,” or “to in
struct the President on the Cuban
situation.’’ Mr. Kocher apparent
ly considers this prudent silence
preferable to what he calls “aca
demic hubris”; in his opinion, a
teacher is not so well versed in
political affairs as Kennedy or
his advisers. It appears that: the
professor’s place is behind the
lecture platform and the poli
tician’s is at the helm of the ship
of state.
THIS FEAR of treading on red
carpets is not unusual in aca
demic circles. The Milton expert
is seldom bold enough to venture
an opinion on Shakespeare, and
the authority on Cripple Creek,
Colorado, expects students of Chi
cago or Miami history to mind
their own business.
Whatever the merits or de
merits of such specialization may
be, I am content to let the author
ities divide the academic pie in
whatever way they choose. I am
concerned, however, when ex
perts suggest that only other ex
perts are qualified to pronounce
on public matters, for our de
mocracy is based on the theory
that the people at large should
govern for themselves rather
than abdicate in favor of well
meaning (or not so well mean
ing) professionals.
It well may be that the people
make mistakes, but the demo
cratic theory is that it is better
for the people to choose their
own mistakes than it is for pow
erful “authorities” to choose for
them.
IF WE NO longer believe in
the democratic theory, or if the
world has truly become too com
plicated for the private citizen to
judge intelligently, we might as
well abandon petitions and tele
grams to the President, and elec
tions as well.
I should suggest, however, that
what is needed is not so much a
choice between the leaders and
the people as a distinction be
tween matters of fact and mat
ters of value. Mr. Kocher is per
fectly correct in suggesting that
Mr. Kennedy and his advisers
know' far better than we how ex
tensive the Cuban missile buildup
was, whether it was controlled
by Cuban or Soviet nationals, etc.
There is little doubt that Edward
Teller or the Chiefs of Staff can
tell us a great deal about the pos
sibility of a nuclear war and the
effect it would have. As responsi
ble citizens, we have a duty to
learn the facts that such authori
ties make available to us.
But there is no reason why a
private citizen should embrace
the expert’s value system along
with his erudition. There is no
guarantee that a nuclear scientist
who might preach “freedom at all
costs” has a message more sig
nificant than the pacifist who in
sists that violence is always met
with more violence.
IT IS QUITE obvious that vari
ous citizens with identical sources
of information can embrace dif
ferent systems of value, and ideas
on methods to preserve those
values. Just as it is the govern
ment’s responsibility to provide
us with pertinent information, it
is our responsibility to acquaint
ourselves with the facts, and to
relate them to our set of values.
If we are convinced that our
ideas have some worth, there is
no reason why we should not ex
ercise “those rights of free
speech and protest,” which Mr.
Kocher recognizes, to make our
views known.
There is no reason w'hy dent
ists, doctors, trade unionists,
plumbers, or teachers should not
organize themselves into an “or
ganized and publicised pressure
group” in an attempt to influence
others, for this is the way demo
cratic process works. This is the
way the electorate informs its
representatives of its wishes.
There is no reason why we
should put a “good deal more
faith in our elected political lead
ers” if we sincerely feel they are
betraying our interests, for we
elect representatives in the belief
that they are responsive to our
desires, not only during political
campaigns, but every day they
are in office.
Hubris? Inordinate pride?
Hopefully we “know our places”
as informed citizens and are do
ing our small part, by reminding
our representatives of their re
sponsibility to consider the elec
torate’s opinions, in preventing
our leaders from committing hu
bris.

Carolyn Higgins
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Kocher’s intelligent and
well formulated letter of Get. 29
appears to be an example of a
growing reluctance on the part of
many citizens to express their
opinions on matters of public
policy.
In the past few weeks I have
heard several faculty members
say “They don’t want to tell
others how to vote,” or “to in
struct the President on the Cuban
situation.’’ Mr. Kocher apparent
ly considers this prudent silence
preferable to what he calls “aca
demic hubris”; in his opinion, a
teacher is not so well versed in
political affairs as Kennedy or
his advisers. It appears that: the
professor’s place is behind the
lecture platform and the poli
tician’s is at the helm of the ship
of state.
THIS FEAR of treading on red
carpets is not unusual in aca
demic circles. The Milton expert
is seldom bold enough to venture
an opinion on Shakespeare, and
the authority on Cripple Creek,
Colorado, expects students of Chi
cago or Miami history to mind
their own business.
Whatever the merits or de
merits of such specialization may
be, I am content to let the author
ities divide the academic pie in
whatever way they choose. I am
concerned, however, when ex
perts suggest that only other ex
perts are qualified to pronounce
on public matters, for our de
mocracy is based on the theory
that the people at large should
govern for themselves rather
than abdicate in favor of well
meaning (or not so well mean
ing) professionals.
It well may be that the people
make mistakes, but the demo
cratic theory is that it is better
for the people to choose their
own mistakes than it is for pow
erful “authorities” to choose for
them.
IF WE NO longer believe in
the democratic theory, or if the
world has truly become too com
plicated for the private citizen to
judge intelligently, we might as
well abandon petitions and tele
grams to the President, and elec
tions as well.
I should suggest, however, that
what is needed is not so much a
choice between the leaders and
the people as a distinction be
tween matters of fact and mat
ters of value. Mr. Kocher is per
fectly correct in suggesting that
Mr. Kennedy and his advisers
know' far better than we how ex
tensive the Cuban missile buildup
was, whether it was controlled
by Cuban or Soviet nationals, etc.
There is little doubt that Edward
Teller or the Chiefs of Staff can
tell us a great deal about the pos
sibility of a nuclear war and the
effect it would have. As responsi
ble citizens, we have a duty to
learn the facts that such authori
ties make available to us.
But there is no reason why a
private citizen should embrace
the expert’s value system along
with his erudition. There is no
guarantee that a nuclear scientist
who might preach “freedom at all
costs” has a message more sig
nificant than the pacifist who in
sists that violence is always met
with more violence.
IT IS QUITE obvious that vari
ous citizens with identical sources
of information can embrace dif
ferent systems of value, and ideas
on methods to preserve those
values. Just as it is the govern
ment’s responsibility to provide
us with pertinent information, it
is our responsibility to acquaint
ourselves with the facts, and to
relate them to our set of values.
If we are convinced that our
ideas have some worth, there is
no reason why we should not ex
ercise “those rights of free
speech and protest,” which Mr.
Kocher recognizes, to make our
views known.
There is no reason w'hy dent
ists, doctors, trade unionists,
plumbers, or teachers should not
organize themselves into an “or
ganized and publicised pressure
group” in an attempt to influence
others, for this is the way demo
cratic process works. This is the
way the electorate informs its
representatives of its wishes.
There is no reason why we
should put a “good deal more
faith in our elected political lead
ers” if we sincerely feel they are
betraying our interests, for we
elect representatives in the belief
that they are responsive to our
desires, not only during political
campaigns, but every day they
are in office.

Hopefully we “know our places”
as informed citizens and are do
ing our small part, by reminding
our representatives of their re

organize themselves into an “or
ganized and publicised pressure
group” in an attempt to influence
others, for this is the way demo
cratic process works. This is the
way the electorate informs its
representatives of its wishes.
There is no reason why we
should put a “good deal more
faith in our elected political lead
ers” if we sincerely feel they are
betraying our interests, for we
elect representatives in the belief
that they are responsive to our
desires, not only during political
campaigns, but every day they
are in office.
Hubris? Inordinate pride?
Hopefully we “know our places”
as informed citizens and are do
ing our small part, by reminding
our representatives of their re
sponsibility to consider the elec
torate’s opinions, in preventing
our leaders from committing hu
bris.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Kocher’s intelligent and
well formulated letter of Get. 29
appears to be an example of a
growing reluctance on the part of
many citizens to express their
opinions on matters of public
policy.
In the past few weeks I have
heard several faculty members
say “They don’t want to tell
others how to vote,” or “to in
struct the President on the Cuban
situation.’’ Mr. Kocher apparent
ly considers this prudent silence
preferable to what he calls “aca
demic hubris”; in his opinion, a
teacher is not so well versed in
political affairs as Kennedy or
his advisers. It appears that: the
professor’s place is behind the
lecture platform and the poli
tician’s is at the helm of the ship
of state.
THIS FEAR of treading on red
carpets is not unusual in aca
demic circles. The Milton expert
is seldom bold enough to venture
an opinion on Shakespeare, and
the authority on Cripple Creek,
Colorado, expects students of Chi
cago or Miami history to mind
their own business.
Whatever the merits or de
merits of such specialization may
be, I am content to let the author
ities divide the academic pie in
whatever way they choose. I am
concerned, however, when ex
perts suggest that only other ex
perts are qualified to pronounce
on public matters, for our de
mocracy is based on the theory
that the people at large should
govern for themselves rather
than abdicate in favor of well
meaning (or not so well mean
ing) professionals.
It well may be that the people
make mistakes, but the demo
cratic theory is that it is better
for the people to choose their
own mistakes than it is for pow
erful “authorities” to choose for
them.
IF WE NO longer believe in
the democratic theory, or if the
world has truly become too com
plicated for the private citizen to
judge intelligently, we might as
well abandon petitions and tele
grams to the President, and elec
tions as well.
I should suggest, however, that
what is needed is not so much a
choice between the leaders and
the people as a distinction be
tween matters of fact and mat
ters of value. Mr. Kocher is per
fectly correct in suggesting that
Mr. Kennedy and his advisers
know' far better than we how ex
tensive the Cuban missile buildup
was, whether it was controlled
by Cuban or Soviet nationals, etc.
There is little doubt that Edward
Teller or the Chiefs of Staff can
tell us a great deal about the pos
sibility of a nuclear war and the
effect it would have. As responsi
ble citizens, we have a duty to
learn the facts that such authori
ties make available to us.
But there is no reason why a
private citizen should embrace
the expert’s value system along
with his erudition. There is no
guarantee that a nuclear scientist
who might preach “freedom at all
costs” has a message more sig
nificant than the pacifist who in
sists that violence is always met
with more violence.
IT IS QUITE obvious that vari
ous citizens with identical sources
of information can embrace dif
ferent systems of value, and ideas
on methods to preserve those
values. Just as it is the govern
ment’s responsibility to provide
us with pertinent information, it
is our responsibility to acquaint
ourselves with the facts, and to
relate them to our set of values.
If we are convinced that our
ideas have some worth, there is
no reason why we should not ex
ercise “those rights of free
speech and protest,” which Mr.
Kocher recognizes, to make our
views known.
There is no reason w'hy dent
ists, doctors, trade unionists,
plumbers, or teachers should not
organize themselves into an “or
ganized and publicised pressure
group” in an attempt to influence
