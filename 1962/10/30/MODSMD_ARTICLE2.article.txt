## Support Poor For De Gaulle 
### 
PARIS lUPI) President
Charles de Gaulle was reported
yesterday to be disappointed but
not seriously shaken by the indi
cations of slipping popular sup
port in the results of Sunday’s
constitutional referendum. The
government let it be known that
de Gaulle will stay in office.
Many of his supporters have
urged de Gaulle to take the load
in the election contest against
the alliance of old-line political
parties which now oppose him.
It was likely, however, that de
Gaulle would resist this tempta
tion which would undermine the
t osition he has maintained as
the "arbiter” of the nation, stand
ing over and above party politics.
THE LIBERAL newspaper “Le
Monde,” in an analysis of France’s
present political situation, point
ed out that if de Gaulle cam
paigned and suffered a sharp de
feat following his reduced vote in
the referendum, his prestige
would suffer grave damage.
De Gaulle’s margin of victory
was narrow, even though he had
warned the nation in effect "vote
for me or I quit.”
"Yes” votes constituted 61.75
per cent of the valid ballots cast.
But 22.75 per cent of the regis
tered voters did not ballot. Thus
the "yes” ballots amounted in
fact to only 46.44 per cent of the
entire electorate of 27.5 million.
