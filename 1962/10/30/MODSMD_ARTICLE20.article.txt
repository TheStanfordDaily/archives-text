# Players Wear Helmets, But Football In Ivy League Just Isn't the Same
## 
### RON RAPOPORT 
Ron Rapoport, Daily co-editor
of volume 141 (1962) and sports
editor of volume 138 (1961), Is
currently attending the School of
Journalism at Columbia Univer
sity in New York City. The fol
lowing is his reaction to one of
the less renowned wonders of
that eastern metropolis Ivy
League football.

NEW YORK -II has become al
most commonplace to compare
collegiate football as it is prac
ticed in this corner of the coun
try unfavorably to the kind play
ed anywhere else. Indeed, a spec
tator whose previous viewing has
all been between Ann Arbor and
Berkeley somehow finds himself,
upon entrance to an Ivy League
stadium, unprepared for what
might be happening on the field.
Maybe they’ve switched to touch
this year; who knows?
It takes no time at all to dis
cover that there is only one sport
in New York and that is profes
sional baseball. And there is only
one team and that is the Yankees.
New Yorkers have come to ex
pect pennants and world cham
pionships as (hey expect rain, and
in fact such triumphs come with
greater regularity. When the
Yanks clinch the pennant or
leave an Alou brother stranded
on third base in the ninth inning
of the seventh game, it is taken
here as a matter of course. News
papers write editorials saying
that all is right with the world
after all, Cuba and Mississippi
notwithstanding.
BUT COLLEGE football is
another matter. And this is not
because the differences between
Middlewestern or Western and
Ivy League play are all that
great. The ball is the same size,
after all. and there are 11 play
ers on a side and they all wear
shoulder pads and helmets and
they all love their mothers and
beat their wives.
The differences are more com
plicated than they might seem,
and this is because the greatest
differences are harder to isolate.
Perhaps it first becomes notice
able days before even the first
game is seen. Negotiating a sub
way entrance on a weekday one
is apt to be stopped in his tracks
; by the Columbia football team,
cleated shoes slung over shoul
ders, emerging en masse from
underground. Baker Field, site
of home games and practice ses
sions. is about five miles from
the Morningside Heights campus.
If there is anything calculated to
destroy the image of a football
team it is the thought of players
fighting commuters for a place
on the subway so as not to be
late to practice.
COLUMBIA opened its season
in September with a close 22-20
win over Brown. The Lions
(that’s Columbia) are co-cham
pions of the league with Harvard
and beat Brown 50-0 last year.
Brown scored in the last minute
and had they made a two-point
conversion the game would have
been a tie.
Columbia had given them this
chance by foolishly trying for a
two-pointer on its final score in
stead of the sure kick which
would have put them nine points
ahead and out of reach. Columbia
Coach Buff Donelli had miscal
culated the score and thus called
for the two-point try. Columbia
fans were frantic as well they
might have been.
Donelli had several tricks for

Brown that day, not the least of
which was electing to kick off
after Brown had scored a touch
down. Most fans didn’t know' a
team even had this option and
w'ere about ready to rush the
referees until someone producer!
a rule book and discovered it was
legal; stupid, hut legal. Donelli
seems to trust his defense more
than his offense, a trust not en
tirely meritorious.
QUARTERBACKING the Lions
is the most heralded and possibly
the best sophomore to enter the
Ivy League in a decade, a 19-year
old superstar named Archie Rob
erts. Archie passes, runs, kicks
(he does this besti, and goes on
both offense and defense. A
writer has said that Columbia has
returned to the days of Sid Luck
man, a quarterback searching for
a team.
In its second game, Princeton,
obviously the class of the league,
beat Columbia 32-0. The Tigers
(that’s Princeton) used a single
wing attack and all five touch

downs that day were scored by a
different tailback. Nobody has
suggested a look at Princeton’s
recruiting tactics but Columbia
would have liked to, no doubt.
Stanford may be the Harvard of
the West but Princeton is the
Ohio State of the East.
HOMECOMING was against
Yale, and Columbia intercepted
five passes to keep the Eli from
the door and win 14-10.
The bands in this league, dis
daining uniforms, wear dark
slacks and blazers of the school
color. Halftime shows are not
complex and Columbia’s is the
only marching band in memory
which includes oboes.
Every time Columbia scores a
touchdown the band and students
breaks into a catchy song the
lyrics of which run:
Who owns New York, Who
owns New York,
Who owns New York the
people say.
We own New York, We own
New York
COLUMBIA.
The question is highly rhetor
ical.

NEW YORK -II has become al
most commonplace to compare
collegiate football as it is prac
ticed in this corner of the coun
try unfavorably to the kind play
ed anywhere else. Indeed, a spec
tator whose previous viewing has
all been between Ann Arbor and
Berkeley somehow finds himself,
upon entrance to an Ivy League
stadium, unprepared for what
might be happening on the field.
Maybe they’ve switched to touch
this year; who knows?
It takes no time at all to dis
cover that there is only one sport
in New York and that is profes
sional baseball. And there is only
one team and that is the Yankees.
New Yorkers have come to ex
pect pennants and world cham
pionships as (hey expect rain, and
in fact such triumphs come with
greater regularity. When the
Yanks clinch the pennant or
leave an Alou brother stranded
on third base in the ninth inning
of the seventh game, it is taken
here as a matter of course. News
papers write editorials saying
that all is right with the world
after all, Cuba and Mississippi
notwithstanding.
BUT COLLEGE football is
another matter. And this is not
because the differences between
Middlewestern or Western and
Ivy League play are all that
great. The ball is the same size,
after all. and there are 11 play
ers on a side and they all wear
shoulder pads and helmets and
they all love their mothers and
beat their wives.
The differences are more com
plicated than they might seem,
and this is because the greatest
differences are harder to isolate.
Perhaps it first becomes notice
able days before even the first
game is seen. Negotiating a sub
way entrance on a weekday one
is apt to be stopped in his tracks
; by the Columbia football team,
cleated shoes slung over shoul
ders, emerging en masse from
underground. Baker Field, site
of home games and practice ses
sions. is about five miles from
the Morningside Heights campus.
If there is anything calculated to
destroy the image of a football
team it is the thought of players
fighting commuters for a place
on the subway so as not to be
late to practice.
COLUMBIA opened its season
in September with a close 22-20
win over Brown. The Lions
(that’s Columbia) are co-cham
pions of the league with Harvard
and beat Brown 50-0 last year.
Brown scored in the last minute
and had they made a two-point
conversion the game would have
been a tie.
Columbia had given them this
chance by foolishly trying for a
two-pointer on its final score in
stead of the sure kick which
would have put them nine points
ahead and out of reach. Columbia
Coach Buff Donelli had miscal
culated the score and thus called
for the two-point try. Columbia
fans were frantic as well they
might have been.
Donelli had several tricks for

Brown that day, not the least of
which was electing to kick off
after Brown had scored a touch
down. Most fans didn’t know' a
team even had this option and
w'ere about ready to rush the
referees until someone producer!
a rule book and discovered it was
legal; stupid, hut legal. Donelli
seems to trust his defense more
than his offense, a trust not en
tirely meritorious.
QUARTERBACKING the Lions
is the most heralded and possibly
the best sophomore to enter the
Ivy League in a decade, a 19-year
old superstar named Archie Rob
erts. Archie passes, runs, kicks
(he does this besti, and goes on
both offense and defense. A
writer has said that Columbia has
returned to the days of Sid Luck
man, a quarterback searching for
a team.
In its second game, Princeton,
obviously the class of the league,
beat Columbia 32-0. The Tigers
(that’s Princeton) used a single
wing attack and all five touch

downs that day were scored by a
different tailback. Nobody has
suggested a look at Princeton’s
recruiting tactics but Columbia
would have liked to, no doubt.
Stanford may be the Harvard of
the West but Princeton is the
Ohio State of the East.
HOMECOMING was against
Yale, and Columbia intercepted
five passes to keep the Eli from
the door and win 14-10.
The bands in this league, dis
daining uniforms, wear dark
slacks and blazers of the school
color. Halftime shows are not
complex and Columbia’s is the
only marching band in memory
which includes oboes.
Every time Columbia scores a
touchdown the band and students
breaks into a catchy song the
lyrics of which run:
Who owns New York, Who
owns New York,
Who owns New York the
people say.
We own New York, We own
New York

they all love their mothers and

COLUMBIA opened its season
in September with a close 22-20
win over Brown. The Lions
(that’s Columbia) are co-cham
pions of the league with Harvard
and beat Brown 50-0 last year.
Brown scored in the last minute
and had they made a two-point
conversion the game would have
been a tie.
Columbia had given them this
chance by foolishly trying for a
two-pointer on its final score in
stead of the sure kick which
would have put them nine points
ahead and out of reach. Columbia
Coach Buff Donelli had miscal
culated the score and thus called
for the two-point try. Columbia
fans were frantic as well they
might have been.
Donelli had several tricks for

Brown that day, not the least of
which was electing to kick off
after Brown had scored a touch
down. Most fans didn’t know' a
team even had this option and
w'ere about ready to rush the
referees until someone producer!
a rule book and discovered it was
legal; stupid, hut legal. Donelli
seems to trust his defense more
than his offense, a trust not en
tirely meritorious.
QUARTERBACKING the Lions
is the most heralded and possibly
the best sophomore to enter the
Ivy League in a decade, a 19-year
old superstar named Archie Rob
erts. Archie passes, runs, kicks
(he does this besti, and goes on
both offense and defense. A
writer has said that Columbia has
returned to the days of Sid Luck
man, a quarterback searching for
a team.
In its second game, Princeton,
obviously the class of the league,
beat Columbia 32-0. The Tigers
(that’s Princeton) used a single
wing attack and all five touch

downs that day were scored by a
different tailback. Nobody has
suggested a look at Princeton’s
recruiting tactics but Columbia
would have liked to, no doubt.
Stanford may be the Harvard of
the West but Princeton is the
Ohio State of the East.
HOMECOMING was against
Yale, and Columbia intercepted
five passes to keep the Eli from
the door and win 14-10.
The bands in this league, dis
daining uniforms, wear dark
slacks and blazers of the school
color. Halftime shows are not
complex and Columbia’s is the
only marching band in memory
which includes oboes.
Every time Columbia scores a
touchdown the band and students
breaks into a catchy song the
lyrics of which run:
Who owns New York, Who
owns New York,
Who owns New York the
people say.
We own New York, We own
New York
