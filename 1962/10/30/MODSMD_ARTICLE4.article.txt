I'nili'il Press International
WASHINGTON The United States suspended its arms block
ade of Cuba Monday for the two days that United Nations Secretary
General U Thant is on the island supervising the removal of Russian
missiles.
The suspension was ordered at Thant’s request, according to a
White House report. It began at daylight today and will remain in
effect for the full 48 hours that the Secretary General is in Cuba.
The suspension was at least a temporary reversal of the U.S.
decision to keep the quarantine in effect until United Nations inspec
tors have confirmed that the Soviet weapons indeed are being re
turned to Russia.
Pentagon spokesman said the warships that have been enforcing
j the blockade will remain in their assigned areas while the suspension
i is in effect
; RUSSIAN LINK MOSCOW -The government newspaper Izvestia
! told the Soviet people last night the United Stales had been poised
| to invade Cuba and that the Soviet decision to dismantle rocket bases
j there showed “the wisdom of the Soviet government.”
Izvestia’s treatment of the Cuban crisis was typical of the effort
j by Soviet newspapers and radio to portray Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev’s rocket base decision not as a loss but as a wise step in
the interest of peace.
