# Business Office Considers Filling Lake Lag Year-Round

Like the Roman goddess Pro-!
serpina, Lake Lagunita each year 1
spends six months above ground
and six months below it. Many
students would like to see the
lake become a permanent resi
dent on terra firma rather than
under it half the year, and the fi
nancial justification for this
move is being considered by the
University.
From January to June, Lagu
nita goes through the annual rit
ual of filling, vegetating, stink
ing, and finally draining. As ex
plained by Seraphim F. Post of
the Business Office, this cycle
may eventually become a finan
cial disadvantage to the Univer
sity as well as a nuisance for
these reasons.
At the present. Stanford ob
tains all the water it needs from
five deep wells located on cam
pus. Until this summer. Palo
Alto was also pumping water
from the ground—ten times as
much water as the University
uses. At that time the city de
cided to purchase more water
from the mountains.
THU USE of these deep wells
had continually lowered the wa
ter table. Since Palo Alto quit
pumping, the water table has
risen somewhat but could start
another downtrend, which would
make well water increasingly
more expensive to pump.
A permanent Lagunita would
alleviate this problem. During its
six month existence each year,
the lake is continuously filling
and draining at the same time.
The water supplied by the over
flow of Searsville Lake via San
Francisquito Creek percolates
through the lake bottom and
raises the water table. Lake
water works its way down into
the table each year in this man
ner. In June, after percolation
from Lagunita is cut off, the
water table goes down, and
pumping becomes progressively
more expensive.
Shallow wells and pipe lines
would make this fate unneces
sary and would eventually turn
a financial advantage as well.
The lake would bo allowed to fill
in the regular way, with the re
sulting rise in the water table.
Then, shallow wells would be
built to pump the water at much
less expense. If rainfall were
light, pipe lines would bring in
more water from the two south
ern lakes Searsville and Felt
or wells could step up pumping
so as to replenish the lake.
THERE ARE two obstacles
confronting this solution; money
and tradition. The project’s cost
is estimated to be between $150,-

000 and $200,000. Pipe systems,
shallow wells and chlorinators,
and physical redevelopment of
the lake itself would all have to
be paid for. Plant growth is one
of the main reasons the lake
must be drained each June.
Weeds and other vegetation
would be chemically brought
under control. Recreation facili
ties for year-around activities
could be built. An understanding
regarding the usage of the lake
would have to be worked out.
Also, year-round supervision
would be necessary: fences might
bo built near certain hanks to cur
tail unwanted trespassing.
If the money is spent to make
the lake permanent, one tradition
will die, or at least be .trans
planted. The annual bonfire on
the dry bed of Lagunita before
the Big Game will have to go, or
it will turn into a rather soggy
affair. That is, unless someone
can invent away to make a float
ing bonfire feasible.
The water research engineers
and the men of the Business Of
fice are more concerned with the
financial angle. If they develop
plans to make the lake perma
nent, it would please most stu
dents, and certainly add beauty
to the area around Lake Lagu
nita.

LAKE LAG, now in its seasonal dry slump, may become self-respectfully wet, if proposed plans are
carried out.
