# Candidate Gubser Fears Complacent Attitudes on Cuba
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
“We have no right to be com
placent about Cuba tonight, 1 ’ as
serted Charles S. Guhser, incum
bent Republican candidate for
Congress from Santa Clara
County at a dinner last night at
the Elk’s Lodge in San Jose.
“My feelings about Cuba were
perhaps different from most of
yours.” he said. “Before the
President's proclamation last
Monday you were complacent;
because of this I and my fellow
congressmen were worried. Last
Monday you became worried, and
we were relieved.
"Now',” he added, “you are
complacent again, and I am again
worried.”
By this complacency, he re
peated, “we refuse to look reali
ty square in the face.”
Referring to the negotiation
phase into which the Cuban
crisis has now passed, Guhser
cautioned that “our military has
never lost a square inch of terri
tory, but I cannot say the same
for the negotiation table.”
Russia is like a good boxer, he
said, who, w'hen in a bad position,
puts his aims around you, “not
because he loves you, but because
he needs time to rest, so that he
can come back in the next round
and beat you."
Turning to domestic issues,
Guhser attacked the King-Ander
son Medicare bill because it “pays
for less than 40 per cent of hos
pitalization costs, taxes the wage
earner, who is least able to pay,
and is compulsory.
He said the King-Anderson bill
would raise social security taxes
from 9% per cent of the worker’s
wage to 11% per cent. He pointed
to his own plan for medical care
for the aged which he asserted
would provide greater coverage
but would preserve a citizen’s
right to refuse aid.
In closing, Gubser called for
less government interference in
areas which could be handled lo
cally. “Ask not your country to
do for you,” he said, “what you
can do for yourself.”
