The South West African Com
mittee (SWAC) headed by Susie
Goodwillie, has been established
as part of the Institute of Inter
national Relations African Desk
to study South West and raise
funds for the education of prom
ising students from that area.
The Stanford committee was
organized this September follow
ing the passing of a resolution at
the National Students Associa
tion Congress in August which
urged the establishment of such
committees on American cam
puses to study the problems of
South West and raise necessary
funds.
Stanford students became es
pecially involved in the activity
through their connection with
Allard Lowenstein, former As
sistant Dean of Men, who out
lined the intensity of the apar
their injustices in South West as
a result of first hand experience.
IN HIS BOOK, “Brutal Man
date,” Lowenstein states: “With
fanatic thoroughness the govern
ment . . . determines everything
about everyone by his race and
determines as well what that race
is. Once a man has been investi
gated and categorized as white,
black, or other, the government
tells him where he may live, what
kinds of jobs he may hold, what
schools ho may attend and what
he will be taught there, if and
where he may travel, whom he
may marry, and what if any, po
litical rights he is to have.”
The first step of tlie Stanford
committee is to inform citizens
of the Stanford area about the
I existing conditions In South
I West. “Our first project was a

display along the stairs in the |
main library,” stated Miss Good-1
willie. “We hope to place addi- 1
tional displays in the Union and I
elsewhere on campus in the fu
ture.”
CONTINUING she said, “We
also want to initiate panel dis
cussions, presenting both Amer
ican and African students on
campus, who have, regarding
South West, both the wisdom and
knowledge to share with the rest
of the community. . . . We hope
to invite individual speakers from
the campus, as well as from out
j side the Bay Area.”
! Besides informing the commit
! nity of the situation, the commit
j tee “has begun an extensive cor
j respondence seeking information
j from African students who might
Ibe interested and qualified for
scholarships,” she continued.
“Also,” says Miss Goodwillie,
“we have written to private in
-1 stitutions and foundations in the
country which, if unable to es
pouse our cause financially
might, in some way, be able to
lend information and advice.”
THE COMMITTEE is closely
1 following the action of the Unit
■ ed Nations on the issue, and “We
hope our work will possibly en
, hance the scholarship programs
the UN is presently struggling to
advance in this area,” explained
Miss Goodwillie.
Other programs are tentative
-1 ly planned. The committee has
■ subscribed to UN publications
about South West and intends to
subscribe to at least one of sev-
I i eral African publications such as
! I “Contact” and “Drum" which
■ would “provide vital and first
i hand information about the im
i mediate crisis in Africa.”

to study South West and raise
funds for the education of prom
ising students from that area.
The Stanford committee was
organized this September follow
ing the passing of a resolution at
the National Students Associa
tion Congress in August which
urged the establishment of such
committees on American cam
puses to study the problems of
South West and raise necessary
funds.
Stanford students became es
pecially involved in the activity
through their connection with
Allard Lowenstein, former As
sistant Dean of Men, who out
lined the intensity of the apar
their injustices in South West as
a result of first hand experience.
IN HIS BOOK, “Brutal Man
date,” Lowenstein states: “With
fanatic thoroughness the govern
ment . . . determines everything
about everyone by his race and
determines as well what that race
is. Once a man has been investi
gated and categorized as white,
black, or other, the government
tells him where he may live, what
kinds of jobs he may hold, what
schools ho may attend and what
he will be taught there, if and
where he may travel, whom he
may marry, and what if any, po
litical rights he is to have.”
The first step of tlie Stanford
committee is to inform citizens
of the Stanford area about the
I existing conditions In South
I West. “Our first project was a

display along the stairs in the |
main library,” stated Miss Good-1
willie. “We hope to place addi- 1
tional displays in the Union and I
elsewhere on campus in the fu
ture.”
CONTINUING she said, “We
also want to initiate panel dis
cussions, presenting both Amer
ican and African students on
campus, who have, regarding
South West, both the wisdom and
knowledge to share with the rest
of the community. . . . We hope
to invite individual speakers from
the campus, as well as from out
j side the Bay Area.”
! Besides informing the commit
! nity of the situation, the commit
j tee “has begun an extensive cor
j respondence seeking information
j from African students who might
Ibe interested and qualified for
scholarships,” she continued.
“Also,” says Miss Goodwillie,
“we have written to private in
-1 stitutions and foundations in the
country which, if unable to es
pouse our cause financially
might, in some way, be able to
lend information and advice.”
THE COMMITTEE is closely
1 following the action of the Unit
■ ed Nations on the issue, and “We
hope our work will possibly en
, hance the scholarship programs
the UN is presently struggling to
advance in this area,” explained
Miss Goodwillie.
Other programs are tentative
-1 ly planned. The committee has
■ subscribed to UN publications
about South West and intends to
subscribe to at least one of sev-
I i eral African publications such as
! I “Contact” and “Drum" which
■ would “provide vital and first
i hand information about the im
i mediate crisis in Africa.”
The South West African Com
mittee (SWAC) headed by Susie
Goodwillie, has been established
as part of the Institute of Inter
