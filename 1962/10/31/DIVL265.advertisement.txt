GLOOM AT THE TOP
Oh, sure, you’ve been busy, what with going to classes, doing
your homework, catching night crawlers, getting married
but can’t you pause for just a moment and give thought to that
dear, dedicated, lonely man in the big white house on the hill?
I refer, of course, to the Proxy.
(It is interesting to note here that college presidents are al
ways called “Proxy.” Similarly, trustees arc called “Trixie.”
Associate professors arc called “Axy-Pixy.” Bursars arc called
“Foxy-Woxy.” Students arc called “Algae.”)
But I digress. We were speaking of the Proxy, a personage at
once august and pathetic. Why pathetic? Well sir, consider how
Proxy spends his days. He is busy, busy, busy. He talks to
deans, he talks to professors, he talks to trustcees, he talks to
alumni. In fact, he talks to everybody except the one group
who could lift his heart and rally his spirits. I mean, of course,
the appealingest, endcariugest, winsomest group in the entire
college—you, the students.
It is the Proxy’s sad fate to be forever a stranger to your
laughing, golden selves. He can only gaze wistfully out the
window of his big white house on the hill and watch you at your
games and sports and yearn with all his tormented heart to bask
in your warmth. But how? It would hardly be fitting for Proxy
to appear one day at the Union, clad in an old rowing blazer,
and cry gaily, “Heigh-ho, chaps! Who’s for sculling?”
No, friends, Prexy can’t get to you. It is up to you to get to
him. Call on him at home. Just drop in unannounced. He will
naturally he a little shy at first, so you must put him at his
case. Shout, “Howdy-doody, sir! I have come to bring a little
sunshine into your drear and blighted life!” Then yank his
necktie out of his vest and scamper goatlike around him until
he is laughing merrily along with you.
Then hand him a package and say, “A little gift for you, sir.”
“For me?” he will say, lowering his lids. “You shouldn’t
have.”
“Yes, I should,” you will say, “because this package is
a carton of Marlboro Cigarettes, and whenever I think of
Marlboro, I think of you.”
“Why, hey?” he will say curiously.
“Because Marlboros have taste, and so do you,” you will
reply.
“Aw-, go on,” he will say, blushing furiously.
“It's true,” you will say. “Moreover, Marlboro has a filter,
and so do you.”
“In my swimming pool, you mean,” he will say.
“Yes,” you will say. “Moreover, Marlboro has a soft pack,
and so do you.”
“My limp leather brief case, you mean,” he will say.
“Yes,” you will say. “Moreover, the Marlboro box has a
flip-top, and so do you.”
“But I don’t have a flip-top,” he will say.
“But you will,” you will say. “Just light a Marlboro, and
taste that tasty taste, and you will surely flip your top.”
Well sir, you will have many a good chuckle about that, you
may be sure. Then you will say, “Goodbye, sir, I will return
soon again to brighten your lorn and desperate life.”
“Please do,” he will say. “But next time, if you can possibly
manage it, try not to come at four in the morning.”
