We went to the mountain to
make 1963 Ford-built cars
go 30,000 to 100,000
miles between major
chassis lubrications
Quite a task faced Ford Motor Company
engineers when they set out to eliminate the
traditional trip to the grease rack every
1,000 miles.
Like Mohammed, they went to the mountain—
Bartlett Mountain on the Continental Divide in
Colorado. More molybdenite is mined there
than in the rest of the world combined. And
from molybdenite ore comes the amazing
“moly” grease that helps extend the chassis
lubrication intervals for Ford-built cars. This
grease sticks tenaciously to metal, stands up
under extreme pressures and resists moisture,
pounding and squeezing. It is slicker than
skates on ice!
New, improved seals were developed. Bushings,
bearings and washers of many materials were
investigated. Slippery synthetics, like nylon
and teflon, were used a number of new ways.
The search for means to extend chassis lubri
cation also led to New Orleans-where
experimental suspension ball joints tested in
taxicabs in regular service went two years
without relubrication.
It took time. And ingenuity. But the effort paid
off when Ford-built cars were the first to build
in chassis lubrication good for 30,000 miles or
two years-whichever came first.
Another assignment completed-another
“Ford First” and another example of how Ford
Motor Company provides engineering leader
ship for the American Road.
