# Homecoming Designs Reviewed by Cardinals
## 
### 
At homocoming Stanford shows
off tho campus to alumni and “the
little old ladies of Palo Alto,” Jim
Rogers, president of Cardinals
Board, said yesterday, explaining
why designs for homecoming dec
orations are being strictly cen
sored this year.
All designs that were deemed
offensive in any way by Cardinals
were returned for revision by the

living groups that submitted
them, he said.
“STUDENTS HAVE tbo tenden
cy to create risque an 1 off-color
designs, forgetting th o overall
purpose of homecoming,” said
Handy Dales, homecoming pub
licity co-chairman.
Of eighteen designs submitted,
seven failed (o meet the standards
of good taste set by Cardinals, he
said.
A toilet included in one sketch
was held to be “in bad taste” and
was changed to a garbage can.
The word “flush” was stricken
from the slogan of another pro
posed decoration. Censors request
ed that a girl, depicted with lavish
curves in a third design, appear
“stick-like”.
LIVING GROUPS are usually
willing to modify their designs
when the house decoration chair
man is contacted by the Board,
Rogers said.
“Injun Science Downs Trojan
Defiance” is the theme for home
coming weekend, Nov. 9-11. How
ever, none of the proposed decora
tions were disqualified for failure
lo adhere to the theme, he added.
Should a living group change
its design after approval by Cardi
nals, it is subject to a $lOO fine to
be imposed by Legislature, Rog
ers said. Cardinals Board has the
sole power lo judge if an altera
tion has been made.
BOTH THE DEAN’S Office and
Legislature delegated to Cardinals
Board the responsibility of setting
standards for homecoming decora
tions in order to give the censor
ship function to students, Rogers
said.
Until last year campus living
groups put up homecoming dec
orations without any official ap
proval. Legislature then decided
that if the homecoming decoration
tradition were to be continued, the
designs must be “well done” in
every respect, Rogers said.
"More groups arc participating
this year than ever before even
though control measures arc now
enforced,” Dales said. Stern Hall
and the fraternities in particular
are showing more enthusiasm.
LIVING GROUPS are compet
ing for five awards: sweepstakes,
application of theme, best use of
humor, best use of color, and
animation. Most of the decora
tions planned for this year fea
ture moving parts, Rogers said.
Governor Pat Brown, columnist
Herb Caen, Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler, and a Stanford
pom pon girl of 1932 have been
invited to judge the decorations.
Dean of Women Lucilc Allen will
announce the winning entries at
the homecoming football game.
Stanford originally celebrated
homecoming weekend with a pa
rade of floats Saturday morning
through downtown Palo Alto,
Rogers said. Although these pa
rades attracted large crowds, con
struction of floats was costly and
time-consuming. Five years ago
students decided to replace floats
with stationary exhibits on cam
pus.
