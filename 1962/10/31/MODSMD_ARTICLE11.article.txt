# Eisenhower on Cuba
## 
### 
Former President Eisenhower’s remarks Monday crediting the
Republican party with inspiring President Kennedy’s quarantine
of Cuba are disputable. Mr. Eisenhower said he was “proud,
indeed, that it was a recommendation of the Republican leaders
of Congress that first inspired the joint Congressional resolution
under which the President was able to act in this latest crisis,
forcefully and with the certainty of Congressional approval of
his act.”
Mr. Eisenhower’s remarks are partisan and misleading if they
are intended to imply that President Kennedy would not have
acted if Republicans had not prodded him. The challenge to
U.S. prestige, inherent in the Soviet Union’s attempt to put
IRRM s in Cuba, required a special kind of action, and the Presi
dent would have had to act even if the Congressional resolution
had urged inaction.
Mr. Eisenhower has taken credit also for the ability of Presi
dent Kennedy to act with armed force, saying: “the present mili
tary readiness would not exist were it not for the work of those
eight years (of mine).’ But it is common knowledge that Secre
tary McNamara has drastically upgraded the U.S. conventional
war capability so that this country may wage conventional war at
several danger spots at once. The United States’ ability to fight
simultaneously in Berlin, South Vietnam, and the Caribbean has
been developed under the Kennedy Administration, not under
the Eisenhower Administration. And the success of the President’s
Cuba policy has depended on the U.S.’s ability to counter Russian
pressure elsewhere in the world while we were engaged in a
Caribbean venture. In the light of these considerations, Mr. Eisen
hower’s remarks seem ironically out of place.
