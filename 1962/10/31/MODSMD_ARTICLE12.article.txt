Editor, The Daily:
Occasionally a malicious ru
mor, ungrounded in fact, can un
dermine years and even decades
of good will. We, the officers of
the Stanford “Chaparral,” take
this opportunity to officially deny
any connection whatsoever with
the recent unfortunate induction
of Dean David Larimer into the
armed services. Though we have
had our small differences with
the Deans’ offices small in com
parison with our large areas of
agreement—we would certainly
never resort to such blatant use
of our “connections,” unless it
were absolutely necessary.
Let us also squelch, once and
for all, the absurd allegation that
Dean Donald Winbigler is in any
sense “next,” and reassure him
that the unpleasant incident of
one year and four months ago is
no more than a small nettle in
the minds of our staffers. Bar
ring some unforeseen incident,
his place in the hearts of the
Stanford student body shall re
main perpetually secure.

This Thursday LASSU will
vote on a proposal to abolish
class government, with the excep
tion of the senior class.

In the proposed charter the
purpose given to the senior class
government is twofold. First, this
government “shall be a means of
organization for its members,
providing the senior class with
an elected committee to take care
of all senior class affairs within
and without the University. This
organization shall thus provide
an opportunity for seniors to as
sume social responsibility for
their own affairs.” For what rea

son is this responsibility accord
ed only to the senior class? Are
not the other classes capable of
handling their own affairs?
The second purpose, as stated
by the new proposal, is that "this
form of organization shall exist
for the purpose of providing a
means of identification and ve
hicle of allegiance for its mem
bers with the University, thus to
provide a basis for future organ
ization as an alumni group.” Does
this mean that each class must
wait until its senior year before
unifying and gaining recognition
as a class? In accordance with
this idea is it possible for a class
to assume responsibility and gain
unity in one short year after hav
ing been without this for the pre
vious three years?
Two years ago Steve Corker
ran for re-election to class presi
dency on the platform that he
would resign if elected. He did
this because he felt class govern
ment was a farce. Obviously
others also feel that this is true.
If it is true that class govern
ment beyond social organization
is meaningless, then whose fault
is it? It is certainly not the fault
of class government, for they
would and will welcome any re
sponsibility that will enable them
to take a more active and more
meaningful part in University
life.
Finally, I ask one more ques
tion of LASSU. What possible
benefit will come with the abo
lition of class government? It is
my opinion that only harm can
come from this action; and there
fore I feel that LASSU should
not be considering the abolition
of class government, but rather
the extension of those powers and
responsibilities that will give it
more meaning.

of class government, for they
would and will welcome any re
sponsibility that will enable them
to take a more active and more
meaningful part in University
life.
Finally, I ask one more ques
tion of LASSU. What possible
benefit will come with the abo
lition of class government? It is
my opinion that only harm can
come from this action; and there
fore I feel that LASSU should
not be considering the abolition
of class government, but rather
the extension of those powers and
responsibilities that will give it
more meaning.

Occasionally a malicious ru
mor, ungrounded in fact, can un
dermine years and even decades
of good will. We, the officers of
the Stanford “Chaparral,” take
this opportunity to officially deny
any connection whatsoever with
the recent unfortunate induction
of Dean David Larimer into the
armed services. Though we have
had our small differences with
the Deans’ offices small in com
parison with our large areas of
agreement—we would certainly
never resort to such blatant use
of our “connections,” unless it
were absolutely necessary.
Let us also squelch, once and
for all, the absurd allegation that
Dean Donald Winbigler is in any
sense “next,” and reassure him
that the unpleasant incident of
one year and four months ago is
no more than a small nettle in
the minds of our staffers. Bar

his place in the hearts of the

This Thursday LASSU will
vote on a proposal to abolish
class government, with the excep
tion of the senior class.

In the proposed charter the
purpose given to the senior class
government is twofold. First, this
government “shall be a means of
organization for its members,
providing the senior class with
an elected committee to take care
of all senior class affairs within
and without the University. This
organization shall thus provide
an opportunity for seniors to as
sume social responsibility for
their own affairs.” For what rea

son is this responsibility accord
ed only to the senior class? Are
not the other classes capable of
handling their own affairs?
The second purpose, as stated
by the new proposal, is that "this
form of organization shall exist
for the purpose of providing a
means of identification and ve
hicle of allegiance for its mem
bers with the University, thus to
provide a basis for future organ
ization as an alumni group.” Does
this mean that each class must
wait until its senior year before
unifying and gaining recognition
as a class? In accordance with
this idea is it possible for a class
to assume responsibility and gain
unity in one short year after hav
ing been without this for the pre
vious three years?
Two years ago Steve Corker
ran for re-election to class presi
dency on the platform that he
would resign if elected. He did
this because he felt class govern
ment was a farce. Obviously
others also feel that this is true.
If it is true that class govern
ment beyond social organization
is meaningless, then whose fault
is it? It is certainly not the fault
of class government, for they
would and will welcome any re
sponsibility that will enable them
to take a more active and more
meaningful part in University
life.
Finally, I ask one more ques
