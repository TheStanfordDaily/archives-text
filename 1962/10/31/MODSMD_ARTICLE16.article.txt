# Stanford Players' 'Macbeth' 'Struggling to be Different'

### THEODORE HOFFMAN 
(Editor's note: Mr. Hoffman is
the Director of the Stanford Play
ers production of “Macbeth”
opening Friday night at 8:H0 in
Memorial Auditorium)
The trouble with Shakespeare
productions is that everybody
loves them, loves to do them,
loves to see them, loves to talk
about is fine, but we
also seem to love to do them all
alike. In that big inflated tone,
anguished for tragedy, chirpy
for comedy, every man for him
self, conscientiously shoving the
whole alleged meaning of the
play into his every line.
In Shakespeare’s comedy we
keep everybody prancing around.
Tragedy we play static and por
tentous, and squeeze into it a
few nervous ballets of battle,
procession, or courtly posturing.
Occasionally, to be original, some
one tries the gibbicky “Puck on
Roller Skates” approach and
dresses the play in some post-
Elizabethan period, which pro
vides a change only for the eyes.
EVERY YOUNG actor wants
to play Shakespeare’s tragic
heroes, and every young actor
proceeds to play all of Shakes
peare’s tragic heroes alike. The
body posture may vary from
slumped to rigid hut what we get
are melancholy Danes, melan
choly Britons, melancholy Moors,
and melancholy Greeks, filled
with agonized self-recognition
and the opposite of catharsis
from first to last, relieved only
by comics who suffer from the
same ailments.
I’d like our Macbeth to be dif
ferent no melancholy Scot, and
no bitter mother figure for Lady
Macbeth. But it’s never easy to
escape the fashionable vices,
however good your intentions.
University theatre is never the
ideal laboratory for experimenta
tion, contrary to its propaganda.
You have less rehearsal time
than in the professional theatre,
and far less discipline, training,
and experience. You either pro
duce an unrealized but gratingly
discernible concept, or you do
with good spirit and pretence to
profundity what comes easiest to
all involved.
At best, our “Macbeth” will be
struggling to be different. I’d like
to believe that it will be Shakes
pearean, but since Shakespearean
means using one of those patent
ly inaccurate half-timbered anti
quarian fantasies for a stage, and
19th century acting for style, I
suppose we can only measure suc
cess by the degree to which we’re
accused of not being Shakes
pearean.
BUT SHAKESPEARE’S “Mac
beth” is the one we are aiming at.
The Memorial Auditorium has a
big stage, and Shakespeare’s
plays were played on a large
open stage, with two, at most
three, entrances, a few moveable
set pieces—thrones, statuary,
tables, canopies, mounds, and
such—and lots of costumes on a
small number of actors. We use
scenery in “Macbeth,” as you
must in a proscenium theatre, if
only to mask the stage walls, but
it is carefully (and handsomely)
designed to establish the three
acting locales in the play: an
open space, a palace courtyard,
and the interior of a palace, mi
nus all those places literal minded
editors fill in from Hollinshed
and their own ignorance of the
theatre.

As for “Macbeth,” I prefer to
see it as Shakespeare applying
Renaissance dramaturgy to (he
morality aspect of blood tragedy.
We get the medieval wheel of
fortune, the rise and fall from

power of a man who embraces
evil, and the triumph of meticu
lous and outraged goodness. In
"Macbeth” the symptoms and

stages of the course of evil are
graphically illustrated. The ero
sion of goodness, or the making
of a monster; as you will. At any
rate, no tragic recognition in
Macbeth. Catharsis in the audi
ence, or nowhere.
Theatrically, we have a moral
melodrama, which doesn’t mean
hammy self-indulgence, but a
large, firm, unsubtle structure
filled with human detail. I’d like
to see a rich, clean, strong and
measured production of “Mac
beth,” a fitting tribute to James
1, after all that Elizabethan con
fusion and flummery.
