## Opponents of Apartheid

The structure of government
apartheid legislation rests on the
basic, (and to most South Afri
cans, self-evident), assumption
that the white man (known in
South Africa as the “European”
despite the fact that he has been
there more than 300 years now),
is superior to the African. The
government insists on referring
to the Africans as “Natives,” de
spite repeated requests by the
Africans for this to stop, as they
regard the term “native” as being
derogatory.
The white man, according to
the government, is charged with
the Christian duty of guiding the
“native” to see what is good for
him. The term “guardian," as
used by the South African gov
ernment, means that the white
man knows at all times what is
“good” for the black man. (A
skeptic may suggest that the
white man does only what is
good for himself, but the govern
ment would deny this strongly).
In terms of apartheid—or sep
arate development—policy, cer
tain areas of the country have
been set aside for the African.
These areas are to be known as
the “Traditional Bantu Home
lands.” These areas are seen as
being the African’s “own,” and
nowhere else in the country may
he own any property. The gov
ernment information (in some
parts of the world this would be
called “propaganda”) depart
ment, proclaims to the world

that here the African is to be al
lowed to “develop along his own
lines” (with government guid
ance). In this way the “govern
ment is fulfilling its Christian
duty to the indigenous people.”
The government is not quite so
enthusiastic in letting the world
know that these areas constitute

13 per cent of the country’s land
area, while the Africans consti
tute 80 per cent of the country’s
population.
Seen against this attempt to
separate the different population
groups in order to make impossi
ble any form of contact or under
standing, beyond that of the tra
ditional master-servant relation
ship, it is understandable that
student organizations have be
come involved in the struggle
against the government. The gov
ernment is busy at the moment
removing the remaining non
white students from the English
universities. These universities
have traditionally been “open”
universities, but in accordance

with government policy, no more
non-whites may be enrolled. The
English universities will then
shortly join the ranks of what
are known by the African stu
dents as (he “lily-white schools”—
i.e. the Africans universities.

Any organization in South
Africa that incurs the govern
ment’s displeasure is labelled
"Communist,” after this has been
done, it is a simple matter for the
government to ban it under the
Suppression of Communism Act.
In this way certain avowed anti
communists have been labelled
and removed from the ranks of
the opposition. Albert Luthuli,
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1961, is reduced to political
impotence, as is Patrick Duncan,
the editor-owner of a militantly
anti-communist newspaper. The
National Union of South African
Students has boon accused of be
ing communist inspired, so that
when the government decides
that the organization is becoming
a threat to its authority, it will
be a simple matter to ban it.
