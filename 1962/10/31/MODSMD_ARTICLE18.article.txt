Editor, The Dully:
I am reluctant to continue
‘Taffaire Cuba” in your columns,
hut since I assume that I am the
other of the two professors in the
English Department who did not
sign the letter to President Ken
nedy, I should like to make clear
my reasons for not so doing.
I am not against any group
(even one composed of English
professors!) making representa
tions to our national government
on behalf of any cause. In a day
of governmont-by-lobbies. I see
no reason why Ph.D.’s, even
though not in Washington and
therefore non-Harvard, should
not make their voices heard in
the service of what seems reason
able and just to them as citizens.
I have done so and I shall con
tinue to do so. And if the cloak
of a united academia gives those
voices authority in important
circles, I would consider it one of
the rare tributes paid in our soci
ety to egg-heads and long-hairs

(even though that union would
seem to be incompatible).
The corollary to this, however,
is that to carry weight such rep
resentation should be based on
broad moral issues and should in
voke basic principles rather than
detailed blue prints for action.
The trouble with people who
write letters, whether- “liberal” or
“reactionary,” and send them out
for joint signature, is that they
often do have a blueprint which
they want to sec implemented.
One is forced, therefore, to accept
their propositions in toto or not
at all; footnotes which take ex
ception wordd seem a little dull.
It is easy to blink at this difficul
ty and to sign blithely after reas
suring oneself that the general
tenor of the representation would
be useful. This, I think, is wrong
on two counts. First, it endangers
one’s own integrity. And second
ly, the detailed “programs,” be
ing openly arguable in detail,
tend to alienate support which
should be lined up behind the
basic principles urged by the
signers themselves.

Thus, as concerns the present
letter: its urging, to all possible

limits, of a policy of cool-headed
negotiation in the face of a ple
thora of hot-tempered advice to
the contrary, seemed to be alto
gether admirable and important.
But the letter did not stop there.
It went on to foresee the possible
abandonment of our missile bases
in Turkey—it had, in other
words, a “program”—and it was
just here that I took exception.
Perhaps we should abandon those
bases, but this is a problem in
diplomatic negotiation where by
no means all the counters are
known to me or to my intelligent
colleagues. My detailed advice to
Mr. Kennedy at this point, there
fore, has exactly no meaning, and
its meaninglessness tends to blan
ket and to weaken the terribly
important principle of negotia
tion which is really at the heart
of the whole business.
I’m quite willing to cry "fire”
and even to show the firemen
where the conflagration is, but I
do not think the cause of public
safety is best served by my
wresting the hoses out of their
hands.

John VV. Dodds
Professor of Knglish
Editor, The Dully:
I am reluctant to continue
‘Taffaire Cuba” in your columns,
hut since I assume that I am the
other of the two professors in the
English Department who did not
sign the letter to President Ken
nedy, I should like to make clear
my reasons for not so doing.
I am not against any group
(even one composed of English
professors!) making representa
tions to our national government
on behalf of any cause. In a day
of governmont-by-lobbies. I see
no reason why Ph.D.’s, even
though not in Washington and
therefore non-Harvard, should
not make their voices heard in
the service of what seems reason
able and just to them as citizens.
I have done so and I shall con
tinue to do so. And if the cloak
of a united academia gives those
voices authority in important
circles, I would consider it one of
the rare tributes paid in our soci
ety to egg-heads and long-hairs

(even though that union would
seem to be incompatible).
The corollary to this, however,
is that to carry weight such rep
resentation should be based on
broad moral issues and should in
voke basic principles rather than
detailed blue prints for action.
The trouble with people who
write letters, whether- “liberal” or
“reactionary,” and send them out
for joint signature, is that they
often do have a blueprint which
they want to sec implemented.
One is forced, therefore, to accept
their propositions in toto or not
at all; footnotes which take ex
ception wordd seem a little dull.
It is easy to blink at this difficul
ty and to sign blithely after reas
suring oneself that the general
tenor of the representation would
be useful. This, I think, is wrong
on two counts. First, it endangers
one’s own integrity. And second
ly, the detailed “programs,” be
ing openly arguable in detail,
tend to alienate support which
should be lined up behind the
basic principles urged by the
signers themselves.

Thus, as concerns the present
letter: its urging, to all possible

limits, of a policy of cool-headed
negotiation in the face of a ple
thora of hot-tempered advice to
the contrary, seemed to be alto
gether admirable and important.
But the letter did not stop there.
It went on to foresee the possible
abandonment of our missile bases
in Turkey—it had, in other
words, a “program”—and it was
just here that I took exception.
Perhaps we should abandon those
bases, but this is a problem in
diplomatic negotiation where by
no means all the counters are
known to me or to my intelligent
colleagues. My detailed advice to
Mr. Kennedy at this point, there
fore, has exactly no meaning, and
its meaninglessness tends to blan
ket and to weaken the terribly
important principle of negotia
tion which is really at the heart
of the whole business.
