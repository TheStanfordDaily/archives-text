# Amid Tumult West Coast Football Emerges Triumphant—Tough on SU
## 
### BOB SCHADER 
As everyone knows, the cru
cial issues of this season on the
Stanford sporting scene are: (1)
whether continued “police brutal
ity” will be required to complete
the long delayed integration of
the rooting section, and (2) the
valiant fight of the Tresidder Me
morial Union billiard players to
keep their society untainted by
roving bands of the Peninsula’s
youth. Lying behind these fre
quently obfuscating points of ten
sion, is our primary concern each
fall quarter football.
True, Stanford is having its ups
and downs once again, but it’s
different this year. The Indians
are playing strong foolbalL and
losing, not to just anyone, but to
Coast teams. This discrimination
isn’t simply the result of regional
favoritism: Stanford has been
beaten by some pretty strong ball
clubs. Washington, which showed
us rather haphazard scoring and
a defense which looked like noth
ing so much as calculated retreat,
is as good as any football team in
the nation. WSU, regardless of its
statistical failing against the In
dians, has managed a 4-1-1 record
thus far and possesses, statisti
cally, a very potent offense. The
OSU Beavers who engineered
Stanford’s most decisive defeat
have lost but two of their six con
tests, both to strong football ag
gregations.
OUK THEME: West Coast foot
ball is better this year. Just as
Stanford remembers the Michigan
State game, UCLA won’t soon for
get their 9-7 humbling of Ohio
State. USC’s string of non-con
ference victims Duke, SMU,
lowa and Illinois—can all testify
to the strength of at least one
West Coast outfit. Washington,
while not playing teams of the
same caliber, has looked no less
impressive. At the University of
Oregon where they have been

playing some of the best western
football the last few years, things
are better than ever. After losing
the season opener to powerful
Texas, the Ducks have blitzed
their way to four wins and a lie
implemented by what may be the
most explosive offense in the na
tion. They have beaten Rice, Utah,
and the Air Force Academy. Of
the major West Coast schools,
only California has been beaten
consistently in non - conference
games, losing to Missouri, Duke,
Pittsburgh, and Penn State, all
of which are regarded as powers
within their own regions. And
from none of them did the Bears
take abuse in such quantities as
their brothers at USC heaped
upon them in the Coliseum two
weeks ago.

The quality of the game itself
has improved along with the
changing distribution of inter-re
gional scores. It has been several
years since we have seen a team
with a throwing quarterback, a
receiver, and a prayer attempt to
hurl itself to a winning season.
The balanced attack is a prime
characteristic of this year’s West
ern football. This balance ranges
fro m USC's production of 796
yards on the ground against 847
yards by air, to Washington’s
powerful 1394-yard ground game
which is only for interest’s sake
loosened up by 333 yards worth
of passing. Just as there are no
teams throwing the ball exclusive
ly so there are none willing to
content themselves with an un
mitigated ground game, no matter
how deep in backfield talent.

DEFENSE and better condition
ing have been vital. Few West
Coast teams can approach the Big
Ten schools on a pounds per man
basis, yet no other region has
equalled their success against the
big mid - westerners defensively.
Stanford held “big, strong, and
fast” Michigan State to 13 points.

Since then the Spartans have tal
lied 38 points against North Caro
lina, and reached totals of 28 and
31 points against neighboring
Michigan and NotreDame. UCLA
held Ohio State, a team both deep
and wide, to one touchdown. On
the previous weekend the Colum
bus colossi had scored 41 points
against North Carolina State, and
the following Saturday they stack
ed their scorn upon trackbacked
Illinois to the tune of 51-15.
Better recruiting has been cited
as a causal factor, but considering
that most of the ball players come
from within the area, one school’s
improved enlistment program
doesn’t explain it’s rivals’ equal
success. The argument attribut
ing the talent to simple population
rise (what could be more simple)
is more than matched by the con
current heightening of University
academic requirements.
A more likely explanation is
that coaches are getting better
performance from the same cali
ber athlete. The ideas and suc
cesses of grave young men such
as Washington’s Jim Owens have
exerciser! a profound influence on
West Coast football thought. John
McKay of USC, Marv Levy of Cal
and Bill Barnes of UCLA are all
young men operating with vary
ing degrees of success. The pres
ence of a youthful football coach
in a university’s athletic depart
ment is not necessarily contem
poraneous with gridiron great
ness. However, it is apparent that
the West’s young men, like their
fevered colleagues at West Point,
Texas, Missouri and elsewhere
have most successfully portrayed
to their charges the apotheosis of
victory, that most significant con
tribution of football to the Ameri
can Way of Life.
Among institutional factors, the
extensive California junior col
lege system ranks high. It has
given the high school hotshot an
opportunity to boost the slumping
OPA while refining his extracur
ricular art form. The JC’s are
naturally first rate recruiting
grounds for California’s univer
sities, but a glance at a roster of
the northern schools shows that
none of them has been reluctant
to encourage well chosen Califor
nia lads to complete their studies
amid the scenic beauties of Eu
gene, Corvallis, Pullman or Seat
tle.
If Coast football seems good
this year, it looks better for next
season. At USC, Washington
State and California the team
spirit is dominated by younger
ball players. Though not animat
ed by equal Messianic zeal, soph
omores and juniors at Stanford,
UCLA, Washington and Oregon
have been no less conspicuous in
their lineups.
Stanford may have had a rough
time so far this season, but the
immediate future looks little bet
ter. There is, of course, still the
championship of Santa Clara
County, and the greater Bay Area
grid crown will probably be re
tained. However, USC and Oregon
will doubtless be unimpressed.
Now if only the Indians had an
other soft touch from the Big Ten
or the Southeast Conference.

tribution of football to the Ameri
can Way of Life.
Among institutional factors, the
extensive California junior col
lege system ranks high. It has
given the high school hotshot an
opportunity to boost the slumping
OPA while refining his extracur
ricular art form. The JC’s are
naturally first rate recruiting
grounds for California’s univer
sities, but a glance at a roster of
the northern schools shows that
none of them has been reluctant
to encourage well chosen Califor
nia lads to complete their studies
amid the scenic beauties of Eu
gene, Corvallis, Pullman or Seat
tle.
If Coast football seems good
this year, it looks better for next
season. At USC, Washington
State and California the team
spirit is dominated by younger
ball players. Though not animat
ed by equal Messianic zeal, soph
omores and juniors at Stanford,
UCLA, Washington and Oregon
have been no less conspicuous in
their lineups.
Stanford may have had a rough
time so far this season, but the
immediate future looks little bet
ter. There is, of course, still the
championship of Santa Clara
County, and the greater Bay Area
grid crown will probably be re
tained. However, USC and Oregon
will doubtless be unimpressed.
Now if only the Indians had an
other soft touch from the Big Ten
or the Southeast Conference.
As everyone knows, the cru
cial issues of this season on the
Stanford sporting scene are: (1)
whether continued “police brutal
ity” will be required to complete
the long delayed integration of
the rooting section, and (2) the
valiant fight of the Tresidder Me
morial Union billiard players to
keep their society untainted by
roving bands of the Peninsula’s
youth. Lying behind these fre
quently obfuscating points of ten
sion, is our primary concern each
fall quarter football.
True, Stanford is having its ups
and downs once again, but it’s
different this year. The Indians
are playing strong foolbalL and
losing, not to just anyone, but to
Coast teams. This discrimination
isn’t simply the result of regional
favoritism: Stanford has been
beaten by some pretty strong ball
clubs. Washington, which showed
us rather haphazard scoring and
a defense which looked like noth
ing so much as calculated retreat,
is as good as any football team in
the nation. WSU, regardless of its
statistical failing against the In
dians, has managed a 4-1-1 record
thus far and possesses, statisti
cally, a very potent offense. The
OSU Beavers who engineered
Stanford’s most decisive defeat
have lost but two of their six con
tests, both to strong football ag
gregations.
OUK THEME: West Coast foot
ball is better this year. Just as
Stanford remembers the Michigan
State game, UCLA won’t soon for
get their 9-7 humbling of Ohio
State. USC’s string of non-con
ference victims Duke, SMU,
lowa and Illinois—can all testify
to the strength of at least one
West Coast outfit. Washington,
while not playing teams of the
same caliber, has looked no less
impressive. At the University of
Oregon where they have been

playing some of the best western
football the last few years, things
are better than ever. After losing
the season opener to powerful
Texas, the Ducks have blitzed
their way to four wins and a lie
implemented by what may be the
most explosive offense in the na
tion. They have beaten Rice, Utah,
and the Air Force Academy. Of
the major West Coast schools,
only California has been beaten
consistently in non - conference
games, losing to Missouri, Duke,
Pittsburgh, and Penn State, all
of which are regarded as powers
within their own regions. And
from none of them did the Bears
take abuse in such quantities as
their brothers at USC heaped
upon them in the Coliseum two
weeks ago.

The quality of the game itself
has improved along with the
changing distribution of inter-re
gional scores. It has been several
years since we have seen a team
with a throwing quarterback, a
receiver, and a prayer attempt to
hurl itself to a winning season.
The balanced attack is a prime
characteristic of this year’s West
ern football. This balance ranges
fro m USC's production of 796
yards on the ground against 847
yards by air, to Washington’s
powerful 1394-yard ground game
which is only for interest’s sake
loosened up by 333 yards worth
of passing. Just as there are no
teams throwing the ball exclusive
ly so there are none willing to
content themselves with an un
mitigated ground game, no matter
how deep in backfield talent.

DEFENSE and better condition
ing have been vital. Few West
Coast teams can approach the Big
Ten schools on a pounds per man
basis, yet no other region has
equalled their success against the
big mid - westerners defensively.
Stanford held “big, strong, and
fast” Michigan State to 13 points.

Since then the Spartans have tal
lied 38 points against North Caro
lina, and reached totals of 28 and
31 points against neighboring
Michigan and NotreDame. UCLA
held Ohio State, a team both deep
and wide, to one touchdown. On
the previous weekend the Colum
bus colossi had scored 41 points
against North Carolina State, and
the following Saturday they stack
ed their scorn upon trackbacked
Illinois to the tune of 51-15.
Better recruiting has been cited
as a causal factor, but considering
that most of the ball players come
from within the area, one school’s
improved enlistment program
doesn’t explain it’s rivals’ equal
success. The argument attribut
ing the talent to simple population
rise (what could be more simple)
is more than matched by the con
current heightening of University
academic requirements.
A more likely explanation is
that coaches are getting better
performance from the same cali
ber athlete. The ideas and suc
cesses of grave young men such
as Washington’s Jim Owens have
exerciser! a profound influence on
West Coast football thought. John
McKay of USC, Marv Levy of Cal
and Bill Barnes of UCLA are all
young men operating with vary
ing degrees of success. The pres
ence of a youthful football coach
in a university’s athletic depart
ment is not necessarily contem
poraneous with gridiron great
ness. However, it is apparent that
the West’s young men, like their
fevered colleagues at West Point,
Texas, Missouri and elsewhere
have most successfully portrayed
to their charges the apotheosis of
victory, that most significant con
tribution of football to the Ameri
can Way of Life.

bus colossi had scored 41 points
against North Carolina State, and
the following Saturday they stack
ed their scorn upon trackbacked
Illinois to the tune of 51-15.
Better recruiting has been cited
as a causal factor, but considering
that most of the ball players come
from within the area, one school’s
improved enlistment program
doesn’t explain it’s rivals’ equal
success. The argument attribut
ing the talent to simple population
rise (what could be more simple)
is more than matched by the con
current heightening of University
academic requirements.
A more likely explanation is
that coaches are getting better
performance from the same cali
ber athlete. The ideas and suc
cesses of grave young men such
as Washington’s Jim Owens have
exerciser! a profound influence on
West Coast football thought. John
McKay of USC, Marv Levy of Cal
and Bill Barnes of UCLA are all
young men operating with vary
ing degrees of success. The pres
ence of a youthful football coach
in a university’s athletic depart
ment is not necessarily contem
poraneous with gridiron great
ness. However, it is apparent that
the West’s young men, like their
fevered colleagues at West Point,
Texas, Missouri and elsewhere
have most successfully portrayed
to their charges the apotheosis of
victory, that most significant con
tribution of football to the Ameri
can Way of Life.
Among institutional factors, the
extensive California junior col
lege system ranks high. It has
given the high school hotshot an
opportunity to boost the slumping
OPA while refining his extracur
ricular art form. The JC’s are
naturally first rate recruiting
grounds for California’s univer
sities, but a glance at a roster of
the northern schools shows that
none of them has been reluctant
to encourage well chosen Califor
nia lads to complete their studies
amid the scenic beauties of Eu
gene, Corvallis, Pullman or Seat
tle.
If Coast football seems good
this year, it looks better for next
season. At USC, Washington
State and California the team
spirit is dominated by younger
ball players. Though not animat
ed by equal Messianic zeal, soph
omores and juniors at Stanford,
UCLA, Washington and Oregon
have been no less conspicuous in
their lineups.
Stanford may have had a rough
time so far this season, but the
immediate future looks little bet
ter. There is, of course, still the
championship of Santa Clara
County, and the greater Bay Area
grid crown will probably be re
tained. However, USC and Oregon
will doubtless be unimpressed.
Now if only the Indians had an
other soft touch from the Big Ten
or the Southeast Conference.
As everyone knows, the cru
cial issues of this season on the
Stanford sporting scene are: (1)
whether continued “police brutal
ity” will be required to complete
the long delayed integration of
the rooting section, and (2) the
valiant fight of the Tresidder Me
morial Union billiard players to
keep their society untainted by
roving bands of the Peninsula’s
youth. Lying behind these fre
quently obfuscating points of ten
sion, is our primary concern each
fall quarter football.
True, Stanford is having its ups
and downs once again, but it’s
different this year. The Indians
are playing strong foolbalL and
losing, not to just anyone, but to
Coast teams. This discrimination
isn’t simply the result of regional
favoritism: Stanford has been
beaten by some pretty strong ball
clubs. Washington, which showed
us rather haphazard scoring and
a defense which looked like noth
ing so much as calculated retreat,
is as good as any football team in
the nation. WSU, regardless of its
statistical failing against the In
dians, has managed a 4-1-1 record
thus far and possesses, statisti
cally, a very potent offense. The
OSU Beavers who engineered
Stanford’s most decisive defeat
have lost but two of their six con
tests, both to strong football ag
gregations.
OUK THEME: West Coast foot
ball is better this year. Just as
Stanford remembers the Michigan
State game, UCLA won’t soon for
get their 9-7 humbling of Ohio
State. USC’s string of non-con
ference victims Duke, SMU,
lowa and Illinois—can all testify
to the strength of at least one
West Coast outfit. Washington,
while not playing teams of the
same caliber, has looked no less
impressive. At the University of
Oregon where they have been

playing some of the best western
football the last few years, things
are better than ever. After losing
the season opener to powerful
Texas, the Ducks have blitzed
their way to four wins and a lie
implemented by what may be the
most explosive offense in the na
tion. They have beaten Rice, Utah,
and the Air Force Academy. Of
the major West Coast schools,
only California has been beaten
consistently in non - conference
games, losing to Missouri, Duke,
Pittsburgh, and Penn State, all
of which are regarded as powers
within their own regions. And
from none of them did the Bears
take abuse in such quantities as
their brothers at USC heaped
upon them in the Coliseum two
weeks ago.

The quality of the game itself
has improved along with the
changing distribution of inter-re
gional scores. It has been several
years since we have seen a team
with a throwing quarterback, a
receiver, and a prayer attempt to
hurl itself to a winning season.
The balanced attack is a prime
characteristic of this year’s West
ern football. This balance ranges
fro m USC's production of 796
yards on the ground against 847
yards by air, to Washington’s
powerful 1394-yard ground game
which is only for interest’s sake
loosened up by 333 yards worth
of passing. Just as there are no
teams throwing the ball exclusive
ly so there are none willing to
content themselves with an un
mitigated ground game, no matter
how deep in backfield talent.

DEFENSE and better condition
ing have been vital. Few West
Coast teams can approach the Big
Ten schools on a pounds per man
basis, yet no other region has
equalled their success against the
big mid - westerners defensively.
Stanford held “big, strong, and
fast” Michigan State to 13 points.

Since then the Spartans have tal
lied 38 points against North Caro
lina, and reached totals of 28 and
31 points against neighboring
Michigan and NotreDame. UCLA
held Ohio State, a team both deep
and wide, to one touchdown. On
the previous weekend the Colum

gional scores. It has been several
years since we have seen a team
with a throwing quarterback, a
receiver, and a prayer attempt to
hurl itself to a winning season.
The balanced attack is a prime
characteristic of this year’s West
ern football. This balance ranges
fro m USC's production of 796
yards on the ground against 847
yards by air, to Washington’s
powerful 1394-yard ground game
which is only for interest’s sake
loosened up by 333 yards worth
of passing. Just as there are no
teams throwing the ball exclusive
ly so there are none willing to
content themselves with an un
mitigated ground game, no matter
how deep in backfield talent.

DEFENSE and better condition
ing have been vital. Few West
Coast teams can approach the Big
Ten schools on a pounds per man
basis, yet no other region has
equalled their success against the
big mid - westerners defensively.
Stanford held “big, strong, and
fast” Michigan State to 13 points.

Since then the Spartans have tal
lied 38 points against North Caro
lina, and reached totals of 28 and
31 points against neighboring
Michigan and NotreDame. UCLA
held Ohio State, a team both deep
and wide, to one touchdown. On
the previous weekend the Colum
bus colossi had scored 41 points
against North Carolina State, and
the following Saturday they stack
ed their scorn upon trackbacked
Illinois to the tune of 51-15.
Better recruiting has been cited
as a causal factor, but considering
that most of the ball players come
from within the area, one school’s
improved enlistment program
doesn’t explain it’s rivals’ equal
success. The argument attribut
ing the talent to simple population
rise (what could be more simple)
is more than matched by the con
current heightening of University
academic requirements.
A more likely explanation is
that coaches are getting better
performance from the same cali
ber athlete. The ideas and suc
cesses of grave young men such
as Washington’s Jim Owens have
exerciser! a profound influence on
West Coast football thought. John
McKay of USC, Marv Levy of Cal
and Bill Barnes of UCLA are all
young men operating with vary
ing degrees of success. The pres
ence of a youthful football coach
in a university’s athletic depart
ment is not necessarily contem
poraneous with gridiron great
ness. However, it is apparent that
the West’s young men, like their
fevered colleagues at West Point,
Texas, Missouri and elsewhere
have most successfully portrayed
to their charges the apotheosis of
victory, that most significant con
tribution of football to the Ameri
can Way of Life.
Among institutional factors, the
extensive California junior col
lege system ranks high. It has
given the high school hotshot an
opportunity to boost the slumping
OPA while refining his extracur
ricular art form. The JC’s are
naturally first rate recruiting
grounds for California’s univer
sities, but a glance at a roster of
the northern schools shows that
none of them has been reluctant
to encourage well chosen Califor
nia lads to complete their studies
amid the scenic beauties of Eu
gene, Corvallis, Pullman or Seat
tle.
If Coast football seems good
this year, it looks better for next
season. At USC, Washington
State and California the team
spirit is dominated by younger
ball players. Though not animat
ed by equal Messianic zeal, soph
omores and juniors at Stanford,
UCLA, Washington and Oregon
have been no less conspicuous in
their lineups.
Stanford may have had a rough
time so far this season, but the
immediate future looks little bet
ter. There is, of course, still the
championship of Santa Clara
County, and the greater Bay Area
grid crown will probably be re
tained. However, USC and Oregon
will doubtless be unimpressed.
Now if only the Indians had an
other soft touch from the Big Ten
or the Southeast Conference.
As everyone knows, the cru
cial issues of this season on the
Stanford sporting scene are: (1)
whether continued “police brutal
ity” will be required to complete
the long delayed integration of
the rooting section, and (2) the
valiant fight of the Tresidder Me
morial Union billiard players to
keep their society untainted by
roving bands of the Peninsula’s
youth. Lying behind these fre
quently obfuscating points of ten
sion, is our primary concern each
fall quarter football.
True, Stanford is having its ups
and downs once again, but it’s
different this year. The Indians
are playing strong foolbalL and
losing, not to just anyone, but to
Coast teams. This discrimination
isn’t simply the result of regional
favoritism: Stanford has been
beaten by some pretty strong ball
clubs. Washington, which showed
us rather haphazard scoring and
a defense which looked like noth
ing so much as calculated retreat,
is as good as any football team in
the nation. WSU, regardless of its
statistical failing against the In
dians, has managed a 4-1-1 record
thus far and possesses, statisti
cally, a very potent offense. The
OSU Beavers who engineered
Stanford’s most decisive defeat
have lost but two of their six con
tests, both to strong football ag
gregations.
OUK THEME: West Coast foot
ball is better this year. Just as
Stanford remembers the Michigan
State game, UCLA won’t soon for
get their 9-7 humbling of Ohio
State. USC’s string of non-con
ference victims Duke, SMU,
lowa and Illinois—can all testify
to the strength of at least one
West Coast outfit. Washington,
while not playing teams of the
same caliber, has looked no less
impressive. At the University of
Oregon where they have been

playing some of the best western
football the last few years, things
are better than ever. After losing
the season opener to powerful
Texas, the Ducks have blitzed
their way to four wins and a lie
implemented by what may be the
most explosive offense in the na
tion. They have beaten Rice, Utah,
and the Air Force Academy. Of
the major West Coast schools,
only California has been beaten
consistently in non - conference
games, losing to Missouri, Duke,
Pittsburgh, and Penn State, all
of which are regarded as powers
within their own regions. And
from none of them did the Bears
take abuse in such quantities as
their brothers at USC heaped
upon them in the Coliseum two
weeks ago.

The quality of the game itself
has improved along with the
changing distribution of inter-re
gional scores. It has been several
years since we have seen a team
with a throwing quarterback, a
