Listening to the introductions of the starting players before the
Stanford-UCLA game on television last week dramatized a signifi
cant difference between the two teams. You didn't notice anything
very extraordinary about the Indians; except for their massive si/e.
they seemed like average American college students.
But then came the Bruins: “Mel Profit, end, 6-5, 208 . . . Physi
cal Education major; Phil Oram, tackle, 6-1 .. . Physical Education
major; Dave Stout . . . Physical Education major . . .” Anri so it
went, through seven of the starting eleven players. A look at the
Bruin roster shows 18 P.E. majors out of 49 players.
Certainly there’s nothing very sinister or even extraordinary
about a boy who majors in Physical Education. It’s just that out of
a random sample of male students from a major university such as
UCLA, you would hardly expect to find thirty per cent P.E. majors.
One Out of 67 at Stanford
This figure of thirty per cent is fairly representative of West
Coast teams, too. USC also has thirty per cent P.E. majors, Oregon
has forty-eight per cent, Washington twenty, and Cal sixteen. The
only strikingly different percentage is found at Stanford, where,
out of 67 players listed, one is a P.E. major.
The point is that at most West Coast schools, the athletes, par
ticularly football players, represent a caliber of student different
from the rest of the student body. The difference is indicated by
their academic intersts and activities at school, and is a result of
the high pressure means used to attract them and the concentration
on athletics which is forced into their campus life by the department
of athletics.
This is not true at Stanford, however. Although Stanford does
try to attract athletes out of high school and does give them aid
during their undergraduate years, the means used here fall far
short of the ones used by most other schools; and, more important,
Stanford’s means ultimately make no noticeable differentiation be
tween the athletes and the rest of the Stanford studnts on the whole.
The average gpa of athletes at Stanford is above the over-all men's
average, while the percentage of athletes who graduate is greater
than the comparable percentage of male students who enter Stanford.
There are several reasons for this difference between Stanford
and other western schools. To begin with, Stanford’s rigid entrance
requirements apply equally to athletes as to non-athletes. True, an
accomplished athletic record in high school may compensate for a
mediocre college board score, but no more so than election to a
couple of high student body offices. As a result, the students
accepted by Stanford are distributed over a narrow range of rela
tively high intelligence, making for a homogeneously bright student
body r .
These entrance requirements exclude a lot of athletes who would
be eligible at other western schools where entrance requirements
range from merely a state high school diploma at Oregon State to a
B average and a very minimal score on the college boards at Cal.
That isn’t the whole story, either. Thanks to the high incidence
of junior colleges on the Coast, several schools have made to order
farm systems as well as a means for accepting players with inade
quate high school records. If these players can maintain an accept
able grade average in junior college for one or two years (the
criteria for acceptability vary among the schools), they can enter
the major university and compete in athletics. There is a new, Cali
fornia restriction to this practice, requiring (hat the athlete’s class
have graduated from the junior college before he is eligible to play
for the four-year school, but this restriction applies only to Cal
and UCLA.
Indian Athletes Get Less Financial Aid
Stanford’s financial aid to athletes does not even approach that
of the other' West Coast schools in either amount or- scope and is
thus Jess attractive. The Stanford Buck Club (an alumni group)
contributes money to be given as athletic grants-in-aid, based strictly
on the financial need of the student and covering only the cost of
tuition, which is substantially higher here than anywhere else on
the Coast. On this year’s varsity and frosh teams only fifty per cent
of the players receive money from the grant-in-aid program; another
thirty per cent have purely academic scholarships, awarded by the
university, not the Department of Athletics; the rest support them
selves. The only other construable form of support is the priority
given athletes for about one-sixth of the university hashing jobs
which pay for meals only.
The grants-in-aid cover far less in percentage of college costs
than the amount allowed by the AAWU rules. The conference allows
athletes to receive the full costs of tuition, room, and board in the
form of wages for a 250-hour-per-school-year job supplemented by a
subsistence grant. And this is still more conservative than the NCAA
limit of tuition, room, board, books, plus SIS per month with no
work required, which is in effect at the two non-AAWU, Oregon
schools.
Total Football at Washington
There is also a vast difference between the life of football
players at Stanford and those at at least one other AAWU school.
We take it for granted that the players live in their individually
chosen living groups, have a job if they want, go to parties, and
carry a normal academic load. However, at the University of Wash
ington, western football’s most consistent pawer in the last few
years, the institution of “total football’’ has been installed. This
means that during the fall, the sum and substance of a player’s life
at school is football. From the beginning of fall practice to the last
game of the season the players eat. sleep, watch football films, and
study (if they have time) together at the crew house. This all-per
vasive presence of football keeps the players concentrating on the
game and prevents letdowns due to concern with problems outside
the sphere of football.
This type of athletic brainwashing is not only undesirable at a
primarily academic institution like Stanford, but it is impossible
When players must maintain at least a C average on a 13-unit
program and when many of them are paying their own way through
school, you can’t tell them when to study, when to sleep, and when
to watch football films.
So what is Stanford doing competing against schools which
attract athletes from a much broader base due to their lower en
trance requirements, more attractive financial aid, and tapping of
junior colleges; and which sometimes manipulate their players into
football as away of life?
A New League of High Academic Schools
When the Pacific Coast Conference broke up in 1958 due to
disputes which had festered for years over aid to athletes and
scheduling, Stanford looked around for some equally academically
oriented schools to form a league above the Ivy League de-emphasis
level hut not quite good enough to be a farm system for professional

| football. Vanderbilt and Tulane,
| bastions of learning in the South,
who are annually crushed hy
their rival schools in the South
eastern Conference, were also
anxious for such an arrangement.
But geography (provided enough
other schools could have been
found) made such a league im
possible due to time and cost con
siderations, and the idea was
dropped.
Spurning an alinement with
smaller institutions in the Bay
Area, Stanford joined the AAWIJ
but maintained the more strin
gent aid restrictions from the old
PCC as a compromise.

the Coast. On this year’s varsity and frosh teams only fifty per cent
of the players receive money from the grant-in-aid program; another
thirty per cent have purely academic scholarships, awarded by the
university, not the Department of Athletics; the rest support them
selves. The only other construable form of support is the priority
given athletes for about one-sixth of the university hashing jobs
which pay for meals only.
The grants-in-aid cover far less in percentage of college costs
than the amount allowed by the AAWU rules. The conference allows
athletes to receive the full costs of tuition, room, and board in the
form of wages for a 250-hour-per-school-year job supplemented by a
subsistence grant. And this is still more conservative than the NCAA
limit of tuition, room, board, books, plus SIS per month with no
work required, which is in effect at the two non-AAWU, Oregon
schools.
Total Football at Washington
There is also a vast difference between the life of football
players at Stanford and those at at least one other AAWU school.
We take it for granted that the players live in their individually
chosen living groups, have a job if they want, go to parties, and
carry a normal academic load. However, at the University of Wash
ington, western football’s most consistent pawer in the last few
years, the institution of “total football’’ has been installed. This
means that during the fall, the sum and substance of a player’s life
at school is football. From the beginning of fall practice to the last
game of the season the players eat. sleep, watch football films, and
study (if they have time) together at the crew house. This all-per
vasive presence of football keeps the players concentrating on the
game and prevents letdowns due to concern with problems outside
the sphere of football.
This type of athletic brainwashing is not only undesirable at a
primarily academic institution like Stanford, but it is impossible
When players must maintain at least a C average on a 13-unit
program and when many of them are paying their own way through
school, you can’t tell them when to study, when to sleep, and when
to watch football films.
So what is Stanford doing competing against schools which
attract athletes from a much broader base due to their lower en
trance requirements, more attractive financial aid, and tapping of
junior colleges; and which sometimes manipulate their players into
football as away of life?
A New League of High Academic Schools
When the Pacific Coast Conference broke up in 1958 due to
disputes which had festered for years over aid to athletes and
scheduling, Stanford looked around for some equally academically
oriented schools to form a league above the Ivy League de-emphasis
level hut not quite good enough to be a farm system for professional

| football. Vanderbilt and Tulane,
| bastions of learning in the South,
who are annually crushed hy
their rival schools in the South
eastern Conference, were also
anxious for such an arrangement.
But geography (provided enough
other schools could have been
found) made such a league im
possible due to time and cost con
siderations, and the idea was
dropped.
Spurning an alinement with
smaller institutions in the Bay
Area, Stanford joined the AAWIJ
but maintained the more strin
gent aid restrictions from the old
PCC as a compromise.

Listening to the introductions of the starting players before the
Stanford-UCLA game on television last week dramatized a signifi
cant difference between the two teams. You didn't notice anything
very extraordinary about the Indians; except for their massive si/e.
they seemed like average American college students.
But then came the Bruins: “Mel Profit, end, 6-5, 208 . . . Physi
cal Education major; Phil Oram, tackle, 6-1 .. . Physical Education
major; Dave Stout . . . Physical Education major . . .” Anri so it
went, through seven of the starting eleven players. A look at the
Bruin roster shows 18 P.E. majors out of 49 players.
Certainly there’s nothing very sinister or even extraordinary
about a boy who majors in Physical Education. It’s just that out of
a random sample of male students from a major university such as
UCLA, you would hardly expect to find thirty per cent P.E. majors.
One Out of 67 at Stanford
This figure of thirty per cent is fairly representative of West
Coast teams, too. USC also has thirty per cent P.E. majors, Oregon
has forty-eight per cent, Washington twenty, and Cal sixteen. The
only strikingly different percentage is found at Stanford, where,
out of 67 players listed, one is a P.E. major.
The point is that at most West Coast schools, the athletes, par
ticularly football players, represent a caliber of student different
from the rest of the student body. The difference is indicated by
their academic intersts and activities at school, and is a result of
the high pressure means used to attract them and the concentration
on athletics which is forced into their campus life by the department
of athletics.
This is not true at Stanford, however. Although Stanford does
try to attract athletes out of high school and does give them aid
during their undergraduate years, the means used here fall far
short of the ones used by most other schools; and, more important,
Stanford’s means ultimately make no noticeable differentiation be
tween the athletes and the rest of the Stanford studnts on the whole.
The average gpa of athletes at Stanford is above the over-all men's
average, while the percentage of athletes who graduate is greater
than the comparable percentage of male students who enter Stanford.
There are several reasons for this difference between Stanford
and other western schools. To begin with, Stanford’s rigid entrance
requirements apply equally to athletes as to non-athletes. True, an
accomplished athletic record in high school may compensate for a
mediocre college board score, but no more so than election to a
couple of high student body offices. As a result, the students
accepted by Stanford are distributed over a narrow range of rela
tively high intelligence, making for a homogeneously bright student
body r .
These entrance requirements exclude a lot of athletes who would
be eligible at other western schools where entrance requirements
range from merely a state high school diploma at Oregon State to a
B average and a very minimal score on the college boards at Cal.
That isn’t the whole story, either. Thanks to the high incidence
of junior colleges on the Coast, several schools have made to order
farm systems as well as a means for accepting players with inade
quate high school records. If these players can maintain an accept
able grade average in junior college for one or two years (the
criteria for acceptability vary among the schools), they can enter
the major university and compete in athletics. There is a new, Cali
fornia restriction to this practice, requiring (hat the athlete’s class
have graduated from the junior college before he is eligible to play
for the four-year school, but this restriction applies only to Cal
and UCLA.
Indian Athletes Get Less Financial Aid
Stanford’s financial aid to athletes does not even approach that
of the other' West Coast schools in either amount or- scope and is
thus Jess attractive. The Stanford Buck Club (an alumni group)
contributes money to be given as athletic grants-in-aid, based strictly
on the financial need of the student and covering only the cost of
tuition, which is substantially higher here than anywhere else on
the Coast. On this year’s varsity and frosh teams only fifty per cent
of the players receive money from the grant-in-aid program; another
thirty per cent have purely academic scholarships, awarded by the
university, not the Department of Athletics; the rest support them
selves. The only other construable form of support is the priority

Bruin roster shows 18 P.E. majors out of 49 players.
Certainly there’s nothing very sinister or even extraordinary
about a boy who majors in Physical Education. It’s just that out of
a random sample of male students from a major university such as
UCLA, you would hardly expect to find thirty per cent P.E. majors.
One Out of 67 at Stanford
This figure of thirty per cent is fairly representative of West
Coast teams, too. USC also has thirty per cent P.E. majors, Oregon
has forty-eight per cent, Washington twenty, and Cal sixteen. The
only strikingly different percentage is found at Stanford, where,
out of 67 players listed, one is a P.E. major.
The point is that at most West Coast schools, the athletes, par
ticularly football players, represent a caliber of student different
from the rest of the student body. The difference is indicated by
their academic intersts and activities at school, and is a result of
the high pressure means used to attract them and the concentration
on athletics which is forced into their campus life by the department
of athletics.
This is not true at Stanford, however. Although Stanford does
try to attract athletes out of high school and does give them aid
during their undergraduate years, the means used here fall far
short of the ones used by most other schools; and, more important,
Stanford’s means ultimately make no noticeable differentiation be
tween the athletes and the rest of the Stanford studnts on the whole.
The average gpa of athletes at Stanford is above the over-all men's
average, while the percentage of athletes who graduate is greater
than the comparable percentage of male students who enter Stanford.
There are several reasons for this difference between Stanford
and other western schools. To begin with, Stanford’s rigid entrance
requirements apply equally to athletes as to non-athletes. True, an
accomplished athletic record in high school may compensate for a
mediocre college board score, but no more so than election to a
couple of high student body offices. As a result, the students
accepted by Stanford are distributed over a narrow range of rela
tively high intelligence, making for a homogeneously bright student
body r .
These entrance requirements exclude a lot of athletes who would
be eligible at other western schools where entrance requirements
range from merely a state high school diploma at Oregon State to a
B average and a very minimal score on the college boards at Cal.
That isn’t the whole story, either. Thanks to the high incidence
of junior colleges on the Coast, several schools have made to order
farm systems as well as a means for accepting players with inade
quate high school records. If these players can maintain an accept
able grade average in junior college for one or two years (the
criteria for acceptability vary among the schools), they can enter
the major university and compete in athletics. There is a new, Cali
fornia restriction to this practice, requiring (hat the athlete’s class
have graduated from the junior college before he is eligible to play
for the four-year school, but this restriction applies only to Cal
and UCLA.
Indian Athletes Get Less Financial Aid
Stanford’s financial aid to athletes does not even approach that
of the other' West Coast schools in either amount or- scope and is
thus Jess attractive. The Stanford Buck Club (an alumni group)
contributes money to be given as athletic grants-in-aid, based strictly
on the financial need of the student and covering only the cost of
tuition, which is substantially higher here than anywhere else on
the Coast. On this year’s varsity and frosh teams only fifty per cent
of the players receive money from the grant-in-aid program; another
thirty per cent have purely academic scholarships, awarded by the
university, not the Department of Athletics; the rest support them
selves. The only other construable form of support is the priority
given athletes for about one-sixth of the university hashing jobs
which pay for meals only.
The grants-in-aid cover far less in percentage of college costs
than the amount allowed by the AAWU rules. The conference allows
athletes to receive the full costs of tuition, room, and board in the
form of wages for a 250-hour-per-school-year job supplemented by a
subsistence grant. And this is still more conservative than the NCAA
limit of tuition, room, board, books, plus SIS per month with no
work required, which is in effect at the two non-AAWU, Oregon
schools.
Total Football at Washington
There is also a vast difference between the life of football
players at Stanford and those at at least one other AAWU school.
We take it for granted that the players live in their individually
chosen living groups, have a job if they want, go to parties, and
carry a normal academic load. However, at the University of Wash
ington, western football’s most consistent pawer in the last few
years, the institution of “total football’’ has been installed. This
means that during the fall, the sum and substance of a player’s life
at school is football. From the beginning of fall practice to the last
game of the season the players eat. sleep, watch football films, and
study (if they have time) together at the crew house. This all-per
vasive presence of football keeps the players concentrating on the
game and prevents letdowns due to concern with problems outside
the sphere of football.
This type of athletic brainwashing is not only undesirable at a
primarily academic institution like Stanford, but it is impossible
When players must maintain at least a C average on a 13-unit
program and when many of them are paying their own way through
school, you can’t tell them when to study, when to sleep, and when
to watch football films.
So what is Stanford doing competing against schools which
attract athletes from a much broader base due to their lower en
trance requirements, more attractive financial aid, and tapping of
junior colleges; and which sometimes manipulate their players into
football as away of life?
A New League of High Academic Schools
When the Pacific Coast Conference broke up in 1958 due to
disputes which had festered for years over aid to athletes and
scheduling, Stanford looked around for some equally academically
oriented schools to form a league above the Ivy League de-emphasis
level hut not quite good enough to be a farm system for professional

| football. Vanderbilt and Tulane,
| bastions of learning in the South,
who are annually crushed hy
their rival schools in the South
eastern Conference, were also
anxious for such an arrangement.
But geography (provided enough
other schools could have been
found) made such a league im
possible due to time and cost con
siderations, and the idea was
dropped.
Spurning an alinement with
smaller institutions in the Bay
Area, Stanford joined the AAWIJ
but maintained the more strin
gent aid restrictions from the old
PCC as a compromise.

Listening to the introductions of the starting players before the
Stanford-UCLA game on television last week dramatized a signifi
cant difference between the two teams. You didn't notice anything
very extraordinary about the Indians; except for their massive si/e.
they seemed like average American college students.
But then came the Bruins: “Mel Profit, end, 6-5, 208 . . . Physi
cal Education major; Phil Oram, tackle, 6-1 .. . Physical Education
major; Dave Stout . . . Physical Education major . . .” Anri so it
went, through seven of the starting eleven players. A look at the

athletes to receive the full costs of tuition, room, and board in the
form of wages for a 250-hour-per-school-year job supplemented by a
subsistence grant. And this is still more conservative than the NCAA
limit of tuition, room, board, books, plus SIS per month with no
work required, which is in effect at the two non-AAWU, Oregon
schools.
Total Football at Washington
There is also a vast difference between the life of football
players at Stanford and those at at least one other AAWU school.
We take it for granted that the players live in their individually
chosen living groups, have a job if they want, go to parties, and
carry a normal academic load. However, at the University of Wash
ington, western football’s most consistent pawer in the last few
years, the institution of “total football’’ has been installed. This
means that during the fall, the sum and substance of a player’s life
at school is football. From the beginning of fall practice to the last
game of the season the players eat. sleep, watch football films, and
study (if they have time) together at the crew house. This all-per
vasive presence of football keeps the players concentrating on the
game and prevents letdowns due to concern with problems outside
the sphere of football.
This type of athletic brainwashing is not only undesirable at a
primarily academic institution like Stanford, but it is impossible
When players must maintain at least a C average on a 13-unit
program and when many of them are paying their own way through
school, you can’t tell them when to study, when to sleep, and when
to watch football films.
So what is Stanford doing competing against schools which
attract athletes from a much broader base due to their lower en
trance requirements, more attractive financial aid, and tapping of
junior colleges; and which sometimes manipulate their players into
football as away of life?
A New League of High Academic Schools
When the Pacific Coast Conference broke up in 1958 due to
disputes which had festered for years over aid to athletes and
scheduling, Stanford looked around for some equally academically
oriented schools to form a league above the Ivy League de-emphasis
level hut not quite good enough to be a farm system for professional

| football. Vanderbilt and Tulane,
| bastions of learning in the South,
who are annually crushed hy
their rival schools in the South
eastern Conference, were also
anxious for such an arrangement.
But geography (provided enough
other schools could have been
found) made such a league im
possible due to time and cost con
siderations, and the idea was
dropped.
Spurning an alinement with
smaller institutions in the Bay
Area, Stanford joined the AAWIJ
but maintained the more strin
gent aid restrictions from the old
PCC as a compromise.

Listening to the introductions of the starting players before the
Stanford-UCLA game on television last week dramatized a signifi
cant difference between the two teams. You didn't notice anything
very extraordinary about the Indians; except for their massive si/e.
they seemed like average American college students.
But then came the Bruins: “Mel Profit, end, 6-5, 208 . . . Physi
cal Education major; Phil Oram, tackle, 6-1 .. . Physical Education
major; Dave Stout . . . Physical Education major . . .” Anri so it
went, through seven of the starting eleven players. A look at the
Bruin roster shows 18 P.E. majors out of 49 players.
Certainly there’s nothing very sinister or even extraordinary
about a boy who majors in Physical Education. It’s just that out of
a random sample of male students from a major university such as
UCLA, you would hardly expect to find thirty per cent P.E. majors.
One Out of 67 at Stanford
This figure of thirty per cent is fairly representative of West
Coast teams, too. USC also has thirty per cent P.E. majors, Oregon
has forty-eight per cent, Washington twenty, and Cal sixteen. The
only strikingly different percentage is found at Stanford, where,
out of 67 players listed, one is a P.E. major.
The point is that at most West Coast schools, the athletes, par
ticularly football players, represent a caliber of student different
from the rest of the student body. The difference is indicated by
their academic intersts and activities at school, and is a result of
the high pressure means used to attract them and the concentration
on athletics which is forced into their campus life by the department
of athletics.
This is not true at Stanford, however. Although Stanford does
try to attract athletes out of high school and does give them aid
during their undergraduate years, the means used here fall far
short of the ones used by most other schools; and, more important,
Stanford’s means ultimately make no noticeable differentiation be
tween the athletes and the rest of the Stanford studnts on the whole.
The average gpa of athletes at Stanford is above the over-all men's
average, while the percentage of athletes who graduate is greater
than the comparable percentage of male students who enter Stanford.
There are several reasons for this difference between Stanford
and other western schools. To begin with, Stanford’s rigid entrance
requirements apply equally to athletes as to non-athletes. True, an
accomplished athletic record in high school may compensate for a
mediocre college board score, but no more so than election to a
couple of high student body offices. As a result, the students
accepted by Stanford are distributed over a narrow range of rela
tively high intelligence, making for a homogeneously bright student
body r .
These entrance requirements exclude a lot of athletes who would
be eligible at other western schools where entrance requirements
range from merely a state high school diploma at Oregon State to a
B average and a very minimal score on the college boards at Cal.
That isn’t the whole story, either. Thanks to the high incidence
of junior colleges on the Coast, several schools have made to order
farm systems as well as a means for accepting players with inade
quate high school records. If these players can maintain an accept
able grade average in junior college for one or two years (the
criteria for acceptability vary among the schools), they can enter
the major university and compete in athletics. There is a new, Cali
fornia restriction to this practice, requiring (hat the athlete’s class
have graduated from the junior college before he is eligible to play
for the four-year school, but this restriction applies only to Cal
and UCLA.
Indian Athletes Get Less Financial Aid
Stanford’s financial aid to athletes does not even approach that
of the other' West Coast schools in either amount or- scope and is
thus Jess attractive. The Stanford Buck Club (an alumni group)
contributes money to be given as athletic grants-in-aid, based strictly
on the financial need of the student and covering only the cost of
tuition, which is substantially higher here than anywhere else on
the Coast. On this year’s varsity and frosh teams only fifty per cent
of the players receive money from the grant-in-aid program; another
thirty per cent have purely academic scholarships, awarded by the
university, not the Department of Athletics; the rest support them
selves. The only other construable form of support is the priority
given athletes for about one-sixth of the university hashing jobs
which pay for meals only.
The grants-in-aid cover far less in percentage of college costs
than the amount allowed by the AAWU rules. The conference allows
athletes to receive the full costs of tuition, room, and board in the
form of wages for a 250-hour-per-school-year job supplemented by a
