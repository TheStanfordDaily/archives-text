# 12 Undefeated Mural Teams
## 
### 
With the intramural football i
season just past the halfway I
mark, 12 teams are still unde
feated in the running for the uni-1
versity championship.
The perennially strong Phi Kap
team boasts an impermeable de
fense, having held -three oppo
nents scoreless. Ends Chuck Hor
ton and Keith Wood have provid
ed most of the points, while de
fensive end Marco Magnano has
picked off numerous intercep
tions.
Quarterback Craig Nelson has
almost single-handedly sparked
SAE to three shutout victories.
Nelson has accounted for all nine
SAE touchdowns, running for
three and passing for six more.
His favorite targets, ends Morgan
Halvorson and Chuck Swanson,
have snagged two TD passes
tipiece.
Vying with SAE for (he league
three championship is a powerful
Theta Delt team. With tailback
John Wells directing their seven
man Shotgun formation, the The
tas have run up 98 points in three
games.
The Phi Delts took a huge step
toward a league title yesterday
when they downed previously un
beaten Phi Sigma Kappa, 13-7. A
tunning offense has paid off for
the Phi Delts this year, with half
backs Jim Gruettner and Phil
Humphreys supplying most of
the yardage.
A potent passing game has |
paced the Law School team to |
four wins. Other aerial powers
are the DU’s and (he Betas. The
Beta team relies on ends Jim
Lynden and Don Malcolm for
their scoring, while end Bill Twist
has scored seven TD’s for the DU [
squad.
Rinconada and Otero lead the
Wilbur teams, and a hefty Bur
bank team is currently the best |
among Stern houses.

With the intramural football i
season just past the halfway I
mark, 12 teams are still unde
feated in the running for the uni-1
versity championship.
The perennially strong Phi Kap
team boasts an impermeable de
fense, having held -three oppo
nents scoreless. Ends Chuck Hor
ton and Keith Wood have provid
ed most of the points, while de
fensive end Marco Magnano has
picked off numerous intercep
tions.
Quarterback Craig Nelson has
almost single-handedly sparked
SAE to three shutout victories.
Nelson has accounted for all nine
SAE touchdowns, running for
three and passing for six more.
His favorite targets, ends Morgan
Halvorson and Chuck Swanson,
have snagged two TD passes
tipiece.
Vying with SAE for (he league
three championship is a powerful
Theta Delt team. With tailback
John Wells directing their seven
man Shotgun formation, the The
tas have run up 98 points in three
games.
The Phi Delts took a huge step
toward a league title yesterday
when they downed previously un
beaten Phi Sigma Kappa, 13-7. A
tunning offense has paid off for
the Phi Delts this year, with half
backs Jim Gruettner and Phil
Humphreys supplying most of
the yardage.
A potent passing game has |
paced the Law School team to |
four wins. Other aerial powers
are the DU’s and (he Betas. The
Beta team relies on ends Jim
Lynden and Don Malcolm for
their scoring, while end Bill Twist
has scored seven TD’s for the DU [
squad.
Rinconada and Otero lead the
Wilbur teams, and a hefty Bur
bank team is currently the best |
among Stern houses.
