# Schorer Depicts Biographer As Drudge, Critic and Artist
## 
### LYNN SUSAG 
"Biography reduced to its
simplest terms is the interpene
tration of one mind by another,”
Mark Schorer said last night in
(he Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture, “Burdens of Biography.”
Schorer, head of the English de
partment at Cal, a literary his
torian and critic, spent nine years
researching and writing tho bi
ography, “Sinclair Lewis: An
American Life.”
Schorer used often amusing
anecdotes from his own experi
ence with Lewis and his life to
exemplify his points.
BCHOKEB SAID it is difficult
to define biography or set up
rules for its composition. In fic
tion a man is free to invent a sub
ject and handle it. A biographer
is a man in chains. He is given
his subject and must stay within
the facts. “This is both a burden
and pleasure to carry,” Schorer
said.
The burdens of biography lie
in the fact that a biographer
must be three persons—a drudge,
a critic and an artist. The biog
rapher must first accumulate all
details about the subject. The
hazard is that a prominent man
is sometimes a mythological
man, Schorer said. In his own ex
perience Schorer found that Sin
clair Lewis’ own autobiographi
cal sketches were often deliberate
softenings and a confusion of
facts and Lewis’ friends told con
flicting tales about him.
As a critic the biographer is
obliged to read the complete
works of the subject, some a sec
ond or- third time, to find a clue
to the mind of the subject, Schor
er said. Schorer found Sinclair
Lewis’ novels built on one basic
idea; the attempt to escape from
restrictions of self to a freedom
that doesn’t exist.
AS AN ARTIST, tire biogra
pher- has to not only make the
subject live, but reanimate the
history of the time in which he

lived. He needs to give the facts
a general shape, form and plot.
“The facts of Lewis’ life were
obliging,” Schorer said. There
was the quarrel of the environ
ment with Lewis, Lewis’ quarrel
with his environment, his quar
rel with himself and his attempt
to escape himself.
The biographer must also
choose a type of prose appropri
ate to the tone of the subject’s
life and works. Schorer explained
that he struck a casual conversa
tional and sometimes rambling,
ironical and snide tone in his
work because ho wanted the read
er to feel as if ho were talking
directly to Lewis.

analysed art of Biography last night.
"Biography reduced to its
simplest terms is the interpene
tration of one mind by another,”
Mark Schorer said last night in
(he Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture, “Burdens of Biography.”
Schorer, head of the English de
partment at Cal, a literary his
torian and critic, spent nine years
researching and writing tho bi
ography, “Sinclair Lewis: An
American Life.”
Schorer used often amusing
anecdotes from his own experi
ence with Lewis and his life to
exemplify his points.
BCHOKEB SAID it is difficult
to define biography or set up
rules for its composition. In fic
tion a man is free to invent a sub
ject and handle it. A biographer
is a man in chains. He is given
his subject and must stay within
the facts. “This is both a burden
and pleasure to carry,” Schorer
said.
The burdens of biography lie
in the fact that a biographer
must be three persons—a drudge,
a critic and an artist. The biog
rapher must first accumulate all
details about the subject. The
hazard is that a prominent man
is sometimes a mythological
man, Schorer said. In his own ex
perience Schorer found that Sin
clair Lewis’ own autobiographi
cal sketches were often deliberate
softenings and a confusion of
facts and Lewis’ friends told con
flicting tales about him.
As a critic the biographer is
obliged to read the complete
works of the subject, some a sec
ond or- third time, to find a clue
to the mind of the subject, Schor
er said. Schorer found Sinclair
Lewis’ novels built on one basic
idea; the attempt to escape from
restrictions of self to a freedom
that doesn’t exist.
AS AN ARTIST, tire biogra
pher- has to not only make the
subject live, but reanimate the
history of the time in which he

lived. He needs to give the facts
a general shape, form and plot.
“The facts of Lewis’ life were
obliging,” Schorer said. There
was the quarrel of the environ
ment with Lewis, Lewis’ quarrel
with his environment, his quar
rel with himself and his attempt
to escape himself.
The biographer must also
choose a type of prose appropri
ate to the tone of the subject’s
life and works. Schorer explained
that he struck a casual conversa
tional and sometimes rambling,
ironical and snide tone in his
work because ho wanted the read
er to feel as if ho were talking
directly to Lewis.
