# HOUSEWIVES BLASE
## Apathy Greets Thurber's Canvassing 
### KICK SEIFERT 
Mistaken identity with the late humorist and
an occasional ominous fence signifying a “dog
situation” stand out as milestones in a thoroughly
uneventual afternoon spent plodfling a middle
class suburban neighborhood with democratic con
gressional candidate James P. Thurber.
With few exceptions, stony-faced housewife
followed stony-faced housewife in answering door
after door after door. Not one question was
thrown out to the young candidate, not one com
ment for or against his program was offered. In
fact, not even one handshake materialized as the
afternoon wore on. The only truly enthusiastic
welcome that was predominant and indeed un
faltering, came from Palo Alto’s dynamic dog
population which lavishes in its social security.
PKKHAPS THU APATHY mcethfg James
Thurber's door to door campaign can be attributed
to the candidate’s warm but "non-projecting” per
sonality. The slim Stanford graduate presents a
quiet, uneasy-going, and entirely stagnant ap
proach to each and every apathetic and uninform
ed lady of the household. “Hello, my name's
James Thurber and I'm running for Congress

from your district and I'd appreciate your sup
port and I'd like to leave this pamphlet with you.”
The line is without a word’s variation. A news
paper lying in the middle of the sidewalk is ig
nored and left undelivered. A pack of cub scouts
are playing in the street and pass by without
Thurber’s recognition. Hopefully, the candidate
is too big for the shoes of the political backslapper,
but the real question remains; can he win despite
his lack of political flair?
Thurber is not discouraged by his blase re
ception, instead he hopes that enough housewives
will remember his undeniably warm smile to
vote for him next Tuesday. Moreover, even if the
smile doesn’t make an impression, his New From
tier pamphlet lingers for the Master of the house
hold to praise or tear up.
The electorate of the Tenth Congressional Dis
trict must choose next Tuesday between Gubser,
a man who has a well-known name, and Thurber,
a man who has a well-known smile. The hope of
the optimist is that the voters will know more
about the candidates than the above and vote
accordingly. To date, there is very little support
for this hope.

PKKHAPS THU APATHY mcethfg James
Thurber's door to door campaign can be attributed
to the candidate’s warm but "non-projecting” per
sonality. The slim Stanford graduate presents a
quiet, uneasy-going, and entirely stagnant ap
proach to each and every apathetic and uninform
ed lady of the household. “Hello, my name's
James Thurber and I'm running for Congress

from your district and I'd appreciate your sup
port and I'd like to leave this pamphlet with you.”
The line is without a word’s variation. A news
paper lying in the middle of the sidewalk is ig
nored and left undelivered. A pack of cub scouts
are playing in the street and pass by without
Thurber’s recognition. Hopefully, the candidate
is too big for the shoes of the political backslapper,
but the real question remains; can he win despite
his lack of political flair?
Thurber is not discouraged by his blase re
ception, instead he hopes that enough housewives
will remember his undeniably warm smile to
vote for him next Tuesday. Moreover, even if the
smile doesn’t make an impression, his New From
tier pamphlet lingers for the Master of the house
hold to praise or tear up.
The electorate of the Tenth Congressional Dis
trict must choose next Tuesday between Gubser,
a man who has a well-known name, and Thurber,
a man who has a well-known smile. The hope of
the optimist is that the voters will know more
about the candidates than the above and vote
accordingly. To date, there is very little support
for this hope.

JAMES P. THURBER contacts his headquarters as the Democratic
candidate begins his final week of campaigning for the United
States Congress.
Mistaken identity with the late humorist and
an occasional ominous fence signifying a “dog
situation” stand out as milestones in a thoroughly
uneventual afternoon spent plodfling a middle
class suburban neighborhood with democratic con
gressional candidate James P. Thurber.
With few exceptions, stony-faced housewife
followed stony-faced housewife in answering door
after door after door. Not one question was
thrown out to the young candidate, not one com
ment for or against his program was offered. In
fact, not even one handshake materialized as the
afternoon wore on. The only truly enthusiastic
welcome that was predominant and indeed un
faltering, came from Palo Alto’s dynamic dog
population which lavishes in its social security.
