### 
United Press International
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. Acting Secretary General Thant re
ported from Havana last night that he mot with Premier Fidel
Castro for two hours and 10 minutes on the dismantling of Soviet
missile bases in Cuba. He called the meeting “very useful.” Another
meeting is scheduled for this morning at 10 a.m. EST.
While the Havana talks on removing the Soviet rocket installa-1
tions and ending the Caribbean crisis went on, it was disclosed here
that Castro has recalled the Cuban ambassador to the U.N., Mario
Garcia-Inchaustegui, who last week vowed that United Nations ob
servers would never be admitted into Cuba.
With Thant in the initial session were U.N. undersecretaries
Omar Loutfi of the United Arab Republic and Hernano Tavares de
Sa of Brazil and Brigadier Indar Jit Rikhye of India, the secretary
general’s military adviser.
Participating on the Cuban side with Castro were President
Osvaldo Dorticos and Foreign Minister Raul Roa.
Fidel Castro, out to show Cubans and the world that he is still
the maximum leader of Cuba, ordered daily war maneuvers to coin
cide with the visit of the United Nations rocket dismantling dele
gation.
He demanded the return of Guantanamo naval base to Cuba.
The Soviets have been silent on this point. Naval exercises began
today off Cuba’s north coast within 20 miles of Havana.
BED CHINA LOSES AGAIN IN UN -UNITED NATIONS—The
General Assembly buried the China issue again yesterday by voting
down for the second year in a row a Russian move to expel Nation
alist China from the United Nations and to seat Communist China
instead. The vote on the Soviet resolution was 56-42 in favor of
Nationalist China with 12 delegations abstaining.
The 110-nation assembly thus enabled the Formosa government
of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to remain in tho United Nations
for at least another year, as it has every years since the admission
of Red China became an annual question in 1950.
The only big “issue” in the debate was Communist China’s
armed invasion of Northern India. The Indian delegation still voted
to seat Peiping in the United Nations but bitterly denounced the
Chinese as aggrssors.
Russia avoided mention of the dispute between China and
India until after the vote was recorded. Then Soviet Deputy For
eign Minister Valerian A. Zorin made clear Russia’s support for
Peiping. He told the assembly the dispute ought to be settled peace
fully by negotiation on the basis of the Chinese Communist pro
posals of Oct. 24, which India rejected here Monday.
INDIAN ARMY LAUNCHES CCOUNTERATTACK - NEW DELHI—
Indian troops, backed by artillery and heavy mortar fire, launched
a counter-offensive against invading Chinese Red forces on the
northeast frontier yesterday for the first time since the Chinese
surged over the border nearly two weeks ago.
A Defense Ministry spokesman said Indian troops counter
attacked at two points in the North East Frontier Agency fNEFAI
in the limited offensive action that followed days of Indian with
drawals and heavy casualties. It came only a day after the United
Stales answered an Indian appeal with a pledge to rush arms and
ammunition to bolster this nation’s defenses.
BOTH POWERS TEST BOMBS—WASHINGTON—Russia continu
ed its atmospheric nuclear test series yesterday with a sub-megaton
blast over the Arctic, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission an
nounced yesterday. Announcement of the Soviet shot, the 26th an
nounced one of the series, came after the United States conducted
a plane-drop shot over its Johnston Island test area. The American
shot was the 34th announced so far in the new series.
Russia’s stepped up nuclear weapons testing, coinciding with
the cooling of the Cuba crisis, stirred diplomatic speculation here
yestei’day that Premier Nikita Khrushchev may be clearing the
decks for an imminent new test ban move.
COMMUNISTS MAY HOLD “SUMMIT”— MOSCOW—Premier Ni
kita S. Khrushchev may have summoned top leaders of the Com
munist bloc nations to Moscow to explain his missile withdrawal
from Cuba, Western diplomatic sources said yesterday. The specula
tion was based on the unexpected arrival Monday night of Antonin
Novotny, president and Communist party chief of Czechoslovakia,
accompanied by a large delegation of Czech high party officials.
Novotny’s visit had not been announced in advance. No reason
was given for his trip in the official Soviet news agency 'Pass
report on his arrival. The sources said the pretext for the Communist
“summit” meeting could be provided by the Nov. 7 celebrations
marking the 45th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.

alist China from the United Nations and to seat Communist China
instead. The vote on the Soviet resolution was 56-42 in favor of
Nationalist China with 12 delegations abstaining.
The 110-nation assembly thus enabled the Formosa government
of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to remain in tho United Nations
for at least another year, as it has every years since the admission
of Red China became an annual question in 1950.
The only big “issue” in the debate was Communist China’s
armed invasion of Northern India. The Indian delegation still voted
to seat Peiping in the United Nations but bitterly denounced the
Chinese as aggrssors.
Russia avoided mention of the dispute between China and
India until after the vote was recorded. Then Soviet Deputy For
eign Minister Valerian A. Zorin made clear Russia’s support for
Peiping. He told the assembly the dispute ought to be settled peace
fully by negotiation on the basis of the Chinese Communist pro
posals of Oct. 24, which India rejected here Monday.
INDIAN ARMY LAUNCHES CCOUNTERATTACK - NEW DELHI—
Indian troops, backed by artillery and heavy mortar fire, launched
a counter-offensive against invading Chinese Red forces on the
northeast frontier yesterday for the first time since the Chinese
surged over the border nearly two weeks ago.
A Defense Ministry spokesman said Indian troops counter
attacked at two points in the North East Frontier Agency fNEFAI
in the limited offensive action that followed days of Indian with
drawals and heavy casualties. It came only a day after the United
Stales answered an Indian appeal with a pledge to rush arms and
ammunition to bolster this nation’s defenses.
BOTH POWERS TEST BOMBS—WASHINGTON—Russia continu
ed its atmospheric nuclear test series yesterday with a sub-megaton
blast over the Arctic, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission an
nounced yesterday. Announcement of the Soviet shot, the 26th an
nounced one of the series, came after the United States conducted
a plane-drop shot over its Johnston Island test area. The American
shot was the 34th announced so far in the new series.
Russia’s stepped up nuclear weapons testing, coinciding with
the cooling of the Cuba crisis, stirred diplomatic speculation here
yestei’day that Premier Nikita Khrushchev may be clearing the
decks for an imminent new test ban move.
COMMUNISTS MAY HOLD “SUMMIT”— MOSCOW—Premier Ni
kita S. Khrushchev may have summoned top leaders of the Com
munist bloc nations to Moscow to explain his missile withdrawal
from Cuba, Western diplomatic sources said yesterday. The specula

Novotny, president and Communist party chief of Czechoslovakia,
accompanied by a large delegation of Czech high party officials.
Novotny’s visit had not been announced in advance. No reason
was given for his trip in the official Soviet news agency 'Pass
report on his arrival. The sources said the pretext for the Communist
“summit” meeting could be provided by the Nov. 7 celebrations
marking the 45th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.

ed its atmospheric nuclear test series yesterday with a sub-megaton
blast over the Arctic, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission an
nounced yesterday. Announcement of the Soviet shot, the 26th an
nounced one of the series, came after the United States conducted
a plane-drop shot over its Johnston Island test area. The American
shot was the 34th announced so far in the new series.

the cooling of the Cuba crisis, stirred diplomatic speculation here

decks for an imminent new test ban move.
COMMUNISTS MAY HOLD “SUMMIT”— MOSCOW—Premier Ni
kita S. Khrushchev may have summoned top leaders of the Com
munist bloc nations to Moscow to explain his missile withdrawal
from Cuba, Western diplomatic sources said yesterday. The specula
tion was based on the unexpected arrival Monday night of Antonin
Novotny, president and Communist party chief of Czechoslovakia,
accompanied by a large delegation of Czech high party officials.
Novotny’s visit had not been announced in advance. No reason
was given for his trip in the official Soviet news agency 'Pass
report on his arrival. The sources said the pretext for the Communist
“summit” meeting could be provided by the Nov. 7 celebrations
marking the 45th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. Acting Secretary General Thant re
ported from Havana last night that he mot with Premier Fidel
Castro for two hours and 10 minutes on the dismantling of Soviet
missile bases in Cuba. He called the meeting “very useful.” Another
meeting is scheduled for this morning at 10 a.m. EST.
While the Havana talks on removing the Soviet rocket installa-1
tions and ending the Caribbean crisis went on, it was disclosed here
that Castro has recalled the Cuban ambassador to the U.N., Mario
Garcia-Inchaustegui, who last week vowed that United Nations ob
servers would never be admitted into Cuba.
With Thant in the initial session were U.N. undersecretaries
Omar Loutfi of the United Arab Republic and Hernano Tavares de
Sa of Brazil and Brigadier Indar Jit Rikhye of India, the secretary
general’s military adviser.
Participating on the Cuban side with Castro were President
Osvaldo Dorticos and Foreign Minister Raul Roa.
Fidel Castro, out to show Cubans and the world that he is still
the maximum leader of Cuba, ordered daily war maneuvers to coin
cide with the visit of the United Nations rocket dismantling dele
gation.
He demanded the return of Guantanamo naval base to Cuba.
The Soviets have been silent on this point. Naval exercises began
today off Cuba’s north coast within 20 miles of Havana.
BED CHINA LOSES AGAIN IN UN -UNITED NATIONS—The
General Assembly buried the China issue again yesterday by voting
down for the second year in a row a Russian move to expel Nation
alist China from the United Nations and to seat Communist China
instead. The vote on the Soviet resolution was 56-42 in favor of
Nationalist China with 12 delegations abstaining.
The 110-nation assembly thus enabled the Formosa government
of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to remain in tho United Nations
for at least another year, as it has every years since the admission
of Red China became an annual question in 1950.
The only big “issue” in the debate was Communist China’s
armed invasion of Northern India. The Indian delegation still voted
to seat Peiping in the United Nations but bitterly denounced the
Chinese as aggrssors.
Russia avoided mention of the dispute between China and
India until after the vote was recorded. Then Soviet Deputy For
eign Minister Valerian A. Zorin made clear Russia’s support for
Peiping. He told the assembly the dispute ought to be settled peace
fully by negotiation on the basis of the Chinese Communist pro
posals of Oct. 24, which India rejected here Monday.
