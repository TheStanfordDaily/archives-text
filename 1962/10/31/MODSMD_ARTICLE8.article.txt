# Nominations Opened For ASSU Elections
## 
### 
Nominations for the first ASSU elections of the school year
open today at 8 a.m., the election committee announced yesterday.
A1 Holroyde, the election committee chairman, also announced that
voting on the proposed new ASSU constitution will take place in
conjunction with the primary elections on November 14.
Nominations are open for Men’s and Women’s Council mem-

bers, Legislature Representa
tives, Class officers, and Head
Yell Leader. The nomination pe
titions are to be signed by 15
eligible voters. The petitions
must bo submitted to the ASSU
offices by November 6 and placed
in the “nominations” box.
IF TUB NKVV constitution is
approved in the November 14
primary the voting procedure will
be radically changed. The pro
posed constitution provides for
direct representation in LASSU
of the various living groups.
These include fraternities, eating
clubs, unit houses of Wilbur,
Stern, Florence Moore and La
gunita, Women’s Row houses,
wings of Roble, and floors of
Branner. The present constitution
provides for one representative
from each of the various living
groups rather than for one from
each of the houses themselves.
Primary elections for the
LASSU offices as stated in the
old constitution would, therefore,
be void if the new constitution is
approved. Candidates would be
permitted to continue campaign
ing during the week of November
14 to November 21, and subse
quent elections will be then held.
Candidates for Head Yell Lead
er and pom pon girls will try out
at the University of Southern
California-Stanford football game
on November 10.
