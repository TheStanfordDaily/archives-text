## Thant's Mission Unsuccessful: U.S. Resumes Cuban Blockade 
### 
United Press International
WASHINGTON The United States resumed total surveillance
of Cuba, including a naval blockade, at daybreak today in the ab
sence of what the White House last night called ‘‘effective
United Nations arrangements” for the inspection of dismantling
Russian arms in Cuba.
President Kennedy met with his National Security Council ex
ecutive committee as United Nations Secretary-General Thant flew
back from Cuba where he conferred for two days with Premier
Fidel Castro.
Although Thant had yet to report to Kennedy, it was evident
to the U.S. government that arrangements for U.N. inspection of the
dismantling of Russian missile bases in Cuba had not been com
pleted.
The White House said last night that the voluntary suspension
of the naval quarantine ‘‘will come to an end at daybreak today
and the quarantine will be reinstituted at that time.”
Reports reaching Washington from a variety of sources indi
cated that Russia was hurrying to carry out Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev’s pledge to dismantle the Soviet bases and return the
weapons to the Soviet Union.
But Castro seemed to be balking at unconditional U.N. obser
vation of this operation. Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mi
koyan is headed for Cuba, perhaps to force Castro into line on a
settlement.
As Thant concluded his Cuba trip, a U.N. announcement said
that discussions on a Caribbean settlement Would continue in New
York. The announcement said there was general agreement that
the world organization should participate in settlement of the
problem.

harlal Nehru yesterday bowed to a storm of protest over India’s
“shocking” military unpreparedness in the border war with Com
munist China and ousted American-baiting, Russian-liking V. K.
Krishna Menon as minister of defense.
A government announcement said Nehru will take over the
defense ministry in addition to his current posts as premier and
foreign minister. Krishna Menon, 65, was demoted to minister of
defense production in a move effective today.
Military sources said India’s defenses were in a “shocking state”
because of Krishna Menon’s unwillingness to make plans for or oven
to believe in the possibility of Chinese aggression. They said even
U.S. arms shipments might be delayed because the Indian defense
department had “no coherent plans” for a buildup.
INDIA REQUESTS MILITARY AID -WASHINGTON—U.S. trans
ports will begin an airlift of American small arms and other military
supplies to India this week to help that country meet “premeditated
Chinese aggression,” the State Department announced yesterday.
Slate Department Press Officer Lincoln White said the U.S. aid
to India will Include “light infantry weapons, ammunition, transport
and communications equipment.”
“We expect the first priority items to be airlifted to India this
week,” White said. He had no additional information on the timing
of the shipments, but said he did not believe they had begun yet.
The aid is being sent at the request of Indian Prime Minister
Nehru. Nehru also asked Britain and Canada for arms aid, and
diplomatic officials said these two countries were coordinating ef
forts with the United States in providing weapons for India.

U.S. LAUNCHES SATELLITE SUCCESSFULLY—CAPE CANA

leap into space yesterday to help scientists of many nations find out
exactly what shape the world is in.
The 355-pound moonlet, named Anna, was hurled into an orbit
about 700 miles above earth by a two-stage Thor-Able-Star rocket
launched at 3:08 a.m. EST. Anne has one major goal—to serve as a
reference point in space in a $l2 million program to find out the
precise shape of the earth.

Russian arms in Cuba.
President Kennedy met with his National Security Council ex
ecutive committee as United Nations Secretary-General Thant flew
back from Cuba where he conferred for two days with Premier
Fidel Castro.
Although Thant had yet to report to Kennedy, it was evident
to the U.S. government that arrangements for U.N. inspection of the
dismantling of Russian missile bases in Cuba had not been com
pleted.
The White House said last night that the voluntary suspension
of the naval quarantine ‘‘will come to an end at daybreak today
and the quarantine will be reinstituted at that time.”
Reports reaching Washington from a variety of sources indi
cated that Russia was hurrying to carry out Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev’s pledge to dismantle the Soviet bases and return the
weapons to the Soviet Union.
But Castro seemed to be balking at unconditional U.N. obser
vation of this operation. Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mi
koyan is headed for Cuba, perhaps to force Castro into line on a
settlement.
As Thant concluded his Cuba trip, a U.N. announcement said
that discussions on a Caribbean settlement Would continue in New
York. The announcement said there was general agreement that
the world organization should participate in settlement of the
problem.

“shocking” military unpreparedness in the border war with Com

Krishna Menon as minister of defense.
A government announcement said Nehru will take over the
defense ministry in addition to his current posts as premier and
foreign minister. Krishna Menon, 65, was demoted to minister of
defense production in a move effective today.
Military sources said India’s defenses were in a “shocking state”
because of Krishna Menon’s unwillingness to make plans for or oven
to believe in the possibility of Chinese aggression. They said even
U.S. arms shipments might be delayed because the Indian defense
department had “no coherent plans” for a buildup.
