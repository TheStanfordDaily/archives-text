# New Election Proposal Comes Before LASSU
## 
### 
A new proposal for the election
of LASSU representatives, a pos
sible abolition of class govern
ment, and a modification in over
night restrictions will come be
fore Legislature this evening.
Under the new election propos
al, participation in the primary
election would determine the
number of representatives elected
to Legislature. Participation by
30 per cent of a constituency in
the primary election would en
sure maximum representation.
THE PROPOSAL stipulates
that there shall be one represen
tative for every 75 students in a
constituency, or one representa
tive for every 25 students who
participate in the election, which
ever is less.
The proposal also states that
there must be at least one repre
sentative for each undergraduate
living group, which includes fra
ternities, eat ing clubs, unit houses
of Stern, Wilbur, Florence Moore,
Lagunita, Toyon, independents,
Women’s Row houses, Union,
Branner, and wings of Roble.
Thus undergraduate residences in
general will not be affected by
the participation clauses.
The representation of off-cam
pus independents and graduate
students will depend almost en
tirely upon their participation in
the primaries, with the stipula
tion that the off-campus inde
pendents as a whole, and the vari
ous graduate schols, will receive
at least one representative.
BECAUSE it is possible for as
many as 40 graduate students to
be on legislature the way the pro
posed constitution now reads, an
amendment to the executive ar
ticle will be proposed.
The article now reads, “Candi
dates must have been registered
in the University at least two full
quarters at the time of the elec
tion.” The proposed amendment

would change this to, “Candidates
must be registered in the Univer
sity at the time of the election.”
Legislature is expected to hear
a report from the By-laws Com
mittee, which is now in the proc
ess of revising the skeleton
amendment to the by-laws which
dealt with overnights. Legisla
ture passed this amendment at
its last meeting.
Article XIII, concerning class
government, will also be consid
ered. A motion for the abolition
of class government is expected.

The representation of off-cam
pus independents and graduate
students will depend almost en
tirely upon their participation in
the primaries, with the stipula
tion that the off-campus inde
pendents as a whole, and the vari
ous graduate schols, will receive
at least one representative.
BECAUSE it is possible for as
many as 40 graduate students to
be on legislature the way the pro
posed constitution now reads, an
amendment to the executive ar
ticle will be proposed.
The article now reads, “Candi
dates must have been registered
in the University at least two full
quarters at the time of the elec
tion.” The proposed amendment

would change this to, “Candidates
must be registered in the Univer
sity at the time of the election.”
Legislature is expected to hear
a report from the By-laws Com
mittee, which is now in the proc
ess of revising the skeleton
amendment to the by-laws which
dealt with overnights. Legisla
ture passed this amendment at
its last meeting.
Article XIII, concerning class
government, will also be consid
ered. A motion for the abolition
of class government is expected.
A new proposal for the election
of LASSU representatives, a pos
sible abolition of class govern
ment, and a modification in over
night restrictions will come be
fore Legislature this evening.
Under the new election propos
al, participation in the primary
election would determine the
number of representatives elected
to Legislature. Participation by
30 per cent of a constituency in
the primary election would en
sure maximum representation.
THE PROPOSAL stipulates
that there shall be one represen
tative for every 75 students in a
constituency, or one representa
tive for every 25 students who
participate in the election, which
ever is less.
The proposal also states that
there must be at least one repre
sentative for each undergraduate
living group, which includes fra
ternities, eat ing clubs, unit houses
of Stern, Wilbur, Florence Moore,
Lagunita, Toyon, independents,
Women’s Row houses, Union,
Branner, and wings of Roble.
Thus undergraduate residences in
general will not be affected by
the participation clauses.
