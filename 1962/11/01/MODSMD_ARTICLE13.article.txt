# Sears Shows Freud's Error

### PATRICIA LONG 
Freud’s “psychography”—biog
raphy through psychoanalysis—
of Leonardo da Vinci is based on
faulty information, Dr. Robert
Scais, Dean of the School of Hu
manities, said yesterday after
noon in a speech at Tresidder.
This fact does not, however,
discount the validity of Freud’s
method of applying analytical
techniques to learn more about
deceased persons, he stated.
Leonardo was “neurotic in that
he clearly suffered from work
and sexual inhibitions,” Soars
continued, but he was still a ge
nius. He was driven to work and
unable to complete his projects
easily and on time.
FREUD was possibly jealous of
Leonardo, Sears said, because he
could expand his genius in both
art and science. Freud, on the
other hand, although a potential
ly great writer, was forced to
limit himself to one field, science.
His interpretations of Leonar
do’s inhibitions are based on
three types of data: records of
Leonardo’s contemporaries which
tell of his family life and other
“external” events; Leonardo’s
own experiences, especially as
seen through his writings; and
his products, such as paintings.
Sears termed the latter “the out
come of personality when it
comes in conflict with the real
world.”
The “vulture recollection” of
Leonardo is the basis of much of
Freud’s conclusions. In this pas
sage the artist recalls a vulture
striking his lips with its tail.
USING his experience of in
terpreting dreams. Freud termed
this a “screen memory.” He said
it signified Leonardo's tendency
to be a passive homosexual
(Sears prefers to use the term,
“homoerotism” which does not
connote behavior), and his desire
to be nursed by his mother.
The faulty information Freud
used is primarily connected with
“the vulture recollection.” For
an analysis of this, Sears called
on Dr. Meyer Shapiro, a Colum
bia University professor of art
history.

Shapiro has translated this
passage and found that the bird
in question was not a vulture but
a kite. The German translation
Freud used was incorrect in this
“minor” point.
In an era when it was believed
that infants destined for great
ness were given signs, Leonardo
interpreted his recollection: “I
am destined to invent a fly
ing machine.” The kite, whose
tail was used as a model for the
design of ships’ rudders, was also
to be the model for Leonardo’s
“flying machine.”
