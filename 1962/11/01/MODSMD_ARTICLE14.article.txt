# AID Impedes Book Project
## 
### 
Recent objections by the Unit
ed States Agency for internation
al Development have placed new
obstacles in the path of the UR
“Books for Africa’’ program.
AID had agreed to furnish $20,-
000 necessary to transport nearly
100,000 books collected in a year
and-a-half campaign by Stanford
students in the Institute of In
ternational Relations. The books
are to be shipped to secondary
schools and teacher training col
leges in Kenya, Uganda, Tangan
yika. and Zanzibar.
SINCE A paid project admin
istrator was not included in the
original HR outline of the pro
gram, AID questions the recent
appointment of Hugh Rudorf to
this post, according to Robert W.
Powers, acting AID representa
tive in Nairobi.

Rudorf will be directly respon
sible to Professor Paul R. Hanna,
professor of education and gen
eral project supervisor.
AID also insists that U.S. ship
ping facilities be used in trans
porting the books to Africa, says
Powers. A representative of the
American President Lines will be
available to advise the HR on
shipping details.
AID FURTHER requests that
the original deadline for the proj
ect be changed from June 30 to
March 31, 1963, as AID prefers
to limit its support to the cost of
processing the 100.000 hooks on
hand and does not wish to extend
coverage to include any addition
al books.
In January Jim Haas, student
chairman of the “Books for Afri
ca” drive, requested assistance
from the AID office in East Afri
ca. He was referred to the U.S.
Book Exchange, then to AID in
Washington and finally back to
AID in East Africa. In June the
Agency agreed to provide the
$20,000 needed to process and
ship the books to Africa.
