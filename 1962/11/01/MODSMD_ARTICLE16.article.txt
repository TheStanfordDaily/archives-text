# Neutralism and India
## 
### 
For the last few days the Cuban crisis has overshadowed the
news and potential effect of the Sino-Indian conflict. The fact
that India has finally been confronted by the Chinese colossus
may make for a more realistic Indian attitude toward Communist
China. As the UN representative from Nationalist China observed,
Indian Defense Minister Krishna Menon, the man who has landed
Red China in the past as a peace-loving government, was directing
the Indian effort to blunt the Chinese attack.
A more realistic Indian altitude toward Red China does not
require that India abandon neutralism and join the SEATO alli
ance, India’s neutralism is born of realism, for India cannot afford
to spend money on armaments when her people cannot afford the
necessities of life. An alliance with the West would require jnst
such an expenditure on a weapons industry at the expense of
industry that could otherwise produce consumer goods. Until last
week it seemed that India would easily succeed in avoiding war
with China by following a neutralist foreign policy; and it is
still probable that th<> conflict can be negotiated so that India
may continue its economic progress and thereby stand as an im
pressive showpiece of democratic government in Asia.
A more realistic attitude toward Red China does not even
require that India oppose Red China’s entry into the United
Nations, for her support of Peking’s admission is based on the;
reality that Peking is the actual government of China and that to
isolate an enemy from the community of nations hinders the
negotiation of differences.
However, a more realistic attitude does imply that the Indian
government would support U.S. diplomatic policy in Asia when
that policy is designed to promote the interest of the non-Com
munist nations. India could remain a neutral and still give the
United States more moral support than she has in the past.
