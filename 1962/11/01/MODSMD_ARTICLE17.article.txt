## 'Cuban Crisis Vindicates Conservatives' Stand' 
### RICHARD WEINIG CHARLES LOFGREN 
Two scribes who have often
been accused of publishing “ma
licious doctrines” do send forth
another commentary from their
“dark cave where the light of
what little truth there fis| in the
world [comesj hardly at all.”
Please note that we make no
denial of being cave dwellers.
Our only hope is that our liberal
critics will someday realize that
in absence of infallible informa
tion and perfect reason, they too
dwell in dark, cavernous sur
roundings. Once each has taken
cognizance of his habitat, the
question most germane is this:
“Who is closest to the cave’s en
trance, through which come those
small rays of light and truth?”
And the present Cuban situation
indicates that we have been some
what closer to the entrance to the
cave than a number of persons
seem to think.
IF THE “Lethean dampness”
which permeates the cave has not
entirely “dulled and fogged” our
memories, one might recall that
which one author of this column
wrote in The Daily of May 29,
1961, At that time he predicted
that, even if American foreign
policy were to be bounded by
“containment” premises, action
must be taken against Cuba soon
er or later.
The other author, on October
2, 1962, gave a resume of pub
lished intelligence reports on the
Cuban arms buildup, stating in
part; “Castro now possesses So
viet-made missiles with ranges of
up to 1700 miles, which may be
fired from nine existing missile
bases and soon from 15 additional
bases which are now under con
struction.” He concluded by ask
ing: “How, in other than election
year rhetoric, could Mr. Kennedy
contend that ‘Cuba does not con
stitute a serious threat lo any
other part of this hemisphere’?”
No more than a week before
announcing the “quarantine,” the
President stumped the country
proclaiming that all politicians
Who called for a blockade of Cu
ba “should be kept at home by
the voters and replaced by some
one who has some understanding
of what the 20th century is all
about.” Since that time, Mr. Ken
nedy appears to have crawled a
bit nearer to the cave’s entrance.
BUT, CASTING all “I told you
so’s” aside, . . . any reasonable
policy with regard to Cuba is
contingent upon the resolution of
two questions: (a) What objec
tives should any American for
eign policy seek to achieve in
Latin America? and (b) What
are the objectives of the Soviet
Union in this regard?
It is our firm belief that the
United States should, in coopera
tion with the nations involved,
seek to build a Latin America

in which the people of each na
tion are free to choose the form
of government under which they
wish to live; to enjoy the highest
possible degree of material pros
perity; and to lead their lives as
they see fit.
RUSSIAN objectives seem per
fectly clear. Military and econom
ic aid to Cuba is merely a part of
Mr. Khrushchev’s strategy to
bring Latin America under com
munist domination via a series of
“national liberation movements”
or revolutions similar to that
which deposed Batista and
brought Castro to power.
If Cuba were armed with mis
siles and nuclear warheads, any
action by the United States and
the OAS to prevent limited ag
gression would be confronted
with a grave psychological, if not
physical deterrent.
BUT THE basic revolutionary
threat presented by Castro’s
Cuba will not be appreciably re
duced by Premier Khrushchev’s
agreement to remove such weap
ons. The governments of Haiti,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama,
and the Dominican Republic have
reported that Cuban agents have
been fomenting revolution in
their countries for some months
past. Moreover, Havana-directed
terrorists have crippled as much
as one sixth of Venezuela’s oil
production in the last week.
Thus, the Soviet and Cuban ob
jectives must be recognized for
what they are: the desire to im
pose upon the people of Latin
America communist govern
ments, which will all but irrevoc
ably deny to them the right of
self-determination.

It is in accord with this reality
and with the objectives which we
have previously posited that
American policy toward Cuba
should be formulated. Wo would,
therefore, suggest the following
course of action;
(1) The United States should
serve further warning to Mr. Cas
tro that future Cuban attempts
to bring any Latin American na
tion under communist domination
by overt or covert military action
shall be considered as an act of
war against a member of the
OAS and will be dealt with ac
cordingly.
(2) The United States should
serve notice to the Cuban people
that if they choose to revolt
against Mr. Castro, this nation
will not stand idly by; and
American action will not be lim
ited to mere protestations of Cas
tro brutality or to one of Mr.
Stevenson’s fine speeches in the
General Assembly of the United
Nations.

(3) The United States should
expand its program of economic
aid and technical assistance in
Latin America in an attempt to
lessen the economic appeal of
communism in this area.

Please note that we make no
denial of being cave dwellers.
Our only hope is that our liberal
critics will someday realize that
in absence of infallible informa
tion and perfect reason, they too
dwell in dark, cavernous sur
roundings. Once each has taken
cognizance of his habitat, the
question most germane is this:
“Who is closest to the cave’s en
trance, through which come those
small rays of light and truth?”
And the present Cuban situation
indicates that we have been some
what closer to the entrance to the
cave than a number of persons
seem to think.
IF THE “Lethean dampness”
which permeates the cave has not
entirely “dulled and fogged” our
memories, one might recall that
which one author of this column
wrote in The Daily of May 29,
1961, At that time he predicted
that, even if American foreign
policy were to be bounded by
“containment” premises, action
must be taken against Cuba soon
er or later.
The other author, on October
2, 1962, gave a resume of pub
lished intelligence reports on the
Cuban arms buildup, stating in
part; “Castro now possesses So
viet-made missiles with ranges of
up to 1700 miles, which may be
fired from nine existing missile
bases and soon from 15 additional
bases which are now under con
struction.” He concluded by ask
ing: “How, in other than election
year rhetoric, could Mr. Kennedy
contend that ‘Cuba does not con
stitute a serious threat lo any
other part of this hemisphere’?”
No more than a week before
announcing the “quarantine,” the
President stumped the country
proclaiming that all politicians
Who called for a blockade of Cu
ba “should be kept at home by
the voters and replaced by some
one who has some understanding
of what the 20th century is all
about.” Since that time, Mr. Ken
nedy appears to have crawled a
bit nearer to the cave’s entrance.
BUT, CASTING all “I told you
so’s” aside, . . . any reasonable
policy with regard to Cuba is
contingent upon the resolution of
two questions: (a) What objec
tives should any American for
eign policy seek to achieve in
Latin America? and (b) What
are the objectives of the Soviet
Union in this regard?
It is our firm belief that the
United States should, in coopera
tion with the nations involved,
seek to build a Latin America

in which the people of each na
tion are free to choose the form
of government under which they
wish to live; to enjoy the highest
possible degree of material pros
perity; and to lead their lives as
they see fit.
RUSSIAN objectives seem per
fectly clear. Military and econom
ic aid to Cuba is merely a part of
Mr. Khrushchev’s strategy to
bring Latin America under com
munist domination via a series of
“national liberation movements”
or revolutions similar to that
which deposed Batista and
brought Castro to power.
If Cuba were armed with mis
siles and nuclear warheads, any
action by the United States and
the OAS to prevent limited ag
gression would be confronted
with a grave psychological, if not
physical deterrent.
BUT THE basic revolutionary
threat presented by Castro’s
Cuba will not be appreciably re
duced by Premier Khrushchev’s
agreement to remove such weap
ons. The governments of Haiti,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama,
and the Dominican Republic have
reported that Cuban agents have
been fomenting revolution in
their countries for some months
past. Moreover, Havana-directed
terrorists have crippled as much
as one sixth of Venezuela’s oil
production in the last week.
Thus, the Soviet and Cuban ob
jectives must be recognized for
what they are: the desire to im
pose upon the people of Latin
America communist govern
ments, which will all but irrevoc
ably deny to them the right of
self-determination.

It is in accord with this reality
and with the objectives which we
have previously posited that
American policy toward Cuba
should be formulated. Wo would,
therefore, suggest the following
course of action;
(1) The United States should
serve further warning to Mr. Cas
tro that future Cuban attempts
to bring any Latin American na
tion under communist domination
by overt or covert military action
shall be considered as an act of
war against a member of the
OAS and will be dealt with ac
cordingly.
(2) The United States should
serve notice to the Cuban people
that if they choose to revolt
against Mr. Castro, this nation
will not stand idly by; and
American action will not be lim
ited to mere protestations of Cas
tro brutality or to one of Mr.
Stevenson’s fine speeches in the
General Assembly of the United
Nations.

(3) The United States should
expand its program of economic
aid and technical assistance in
Latin America in an attempt to
lessen the economic appeal of
communism in this area.

cognizance of his habitat, the
question most germane is this:
“Who is closest to the cave’s en
trance, through which come those
small rays of light and truth?”
And the present Cuban situation
indicates that we have been some
what closer to the entrance to the
cave than a number of persons
seem to think.
IF THE “Lethean dampness”
which permeates the cave has not
entirely “dulled and fogged” our
memories, one might recall that
which one author of this column
wrote in The Daily of May 29,
1961, At that time he predicted
that, even if American foreign
policy were to be bounded by
“containment” premises, action
must be taken against Cuba soon
er or later.
The other author, on October
2, 1962, gave a resume of pub
lished intelligence reports on the
Cuban arms buildup, stating in
part; “Castro now possesses So
viet-made missiles with ranges of
up to 1700 miles, which may be
fired from nine existing missile
bases and soon from 15 additional
bases which are now under con
struction.” He concluded by ask
ing: “How, in other than election
year rhetoric, could Mr. Kennedy
contend that ‘Cuba does not con
stitute a serious threat lo any
other part of this hemisphere’?”
No more than a week before
announcing the “quarantine,” the
President stumped the country
proclaiming that all politicians
Who called for a blockade of Cu
ba “should be kept at home by
the voters and replaced by some
one who has some understanding
of what the 20th century is all
about.” Since that time, Mr. Ken
nedy appears to have crawled a
bit nearer to the cave’s entrance.
BUT, CASTING all “I told you
so’s” aside, . . . any reasonable
policy with regard to Cuba is
contingent upon the resolution of
two questions: (a) What objec
tives should any American for
eign policy seek to achieve in
Latin America? and (b) What
are the objectives of the Soviet
Union in this regard?
It is our firm belief that the
United States should, in coopera
tion with the nations involved,
seek to build a Latin America

in which the people of each na
tion are free to choose the form
of government under which they
wish to live; to enjoy the highest
possible degree of material pros
perity; and to lead their lives as
they see fit.
RUSSIAN objectives seem per
fectly clear. Military and econom
ic aid to Cuba is merely a part of
Mr. Khrushchev’s strategy to
bring Latin America under com
munist domination via a series of
“national liberation movements”
or revolutions similar to that
which deposed Batista and
brought Castro to power.
If Cuba were armed with mis
siles and nuclear warheads, any
action by the United States and
the OAS to prevent limited ag
gression would be confronted
with a grave psychological, if not
physical deterrent.
BUT THE basic revolutionary
threat presented by Castro’s
Cuba will not be appreciably re
duced by Premier Khrushchev’s
agreement to remove such weap
ons. The governments of Haiti,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama,
and the Dominican Republic have
reported that Cuban agents have
been fomenting revolution in
their countries for some months
past. Moreover, Havana-directed
terrorists have crippled as much
as one sixth of Venezuela’s oil
production in the last week.
Thus, the Soviet and Cuban ob
jectives must be recognized for
what they are: the desire to im
pose upon the people of Latin
America communist govern
ments, which will all but irrevoc
ably deny to them the right of
self-determination.

It is in accord with this reality
and with the objectives which we
have previously posited that
American policy toward Cuba
should be formulated. Wo would,
therefore, suggest the following
course of action;
(1) The United States should
serve further warning to Mr. Cas
tro that future Cuban attempts
to bring any Latin American na
tion under communist domination
by overt or covert military action
shall be considered as an act of
war against a member of the
OAS and will be dealt with ac
cordingly.
(2) The United States should
serve notice to the Cuban people
that if they choose to revolt
against Mr. Castro, this nation
will not stand idly by; and
American action will not be lim
ited to mere protestations of Cas
tro brutality or to one of Mr.
Stevenson’s fine speeches in the
General Assembly of the United
Nations.

(3) The United States should
expand its program of economic
aid and technical assistance in
Latin America in an attempt to
lessen the economic appeal of
communism in this area.
Two scribes who have often
been accused of publishing “ma
licious doctrines” do send forth
another commentary from their
“dark cave where the light of
what little truth there fis| in the
world [comesj hardly at all.”
Please note that we make no
denial of being cave dwellers.
Our only hope is that our liberal
critics will someday realize that
in absence of infallible informa
tion and perfect reason, they too
dwell in dark, cavernous sur
roundings. Once each has taken
cognizance of his habitat, the
question most germane is this:
“Who is closest to the cave’s en
