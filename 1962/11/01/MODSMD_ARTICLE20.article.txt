## Kennedy Preferred Settlement To Crusades' of Wilson, FDR 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The outcome of these anxious days shows that the President
has used military force boldly and successfully to achieve a specific
and limited objective. Cuba is lo be disarmed and neutralized as a
strategic base in the Western hemisphere. There has been no ap
peasement and there has been no retreat or surrender. At the same

time the President has obtained*
his objective without total block
ade, bombing, or invasion. This
was possible because he sought a
negotiated settlement which did
not call for and does not mean an
unconditional surrender. The crux
of the settlement is the dismantl
ing under UN supervision of the
strategical weapons in return for
the President’s promise that Cuba
will not be blockaded or invaded.
This result could not have been
achieved at all without readiness
to use the military power of the
United States, which in the Ca
ribbean is overwhelming. But the
results could not have been
achieved simply and peaceably if
the President had made his objec
tive, not the dismantling of the
bases but, unconditional surren
der—that is to say, the dismantl
ing of Castro’s Communist re
gime.

f
he watched carefully and no ad
ventures in Latin America will he
permitted. Castro will have to
consider whether he can long
survive with the economic sup
port of only the Communist bloc,
and how. if he can’t, he can work
his way back into the community
of American states.
That is for the future.
The Kennedy-Khrushchev Cuba
settlement envisages efforts to
reach other settlements, some
steps in disarmament, possibly
some kind of redeployment as
between the NATO and the War
saw Pact countries. In this the
rule might well be to reduce ten
sion by making first those agree
ments which do not seriously
matter.

TO BE SURE, the United
States is quite capable of invad
ing Cuba and destroying the Cas
tro regime. But it is not capable
of doing this without serious
losses (the current estimate has
been 40,000 casualties) and with
out unmeasurable conflicts with
the Soviet Union and with our
allies and friends all over the
world.
Like a good general, the Presi
dent has known what to go for
and where to stop.
Remembering how in the first
World War Wilson was driven by
the war fever into an extreme po
sition which left Central Europe
in chaos remembering how in
the second World War Roosevelt
went over to unconditional sur
render, and thus not only pro
longed the war but made it insol
uble by bringing the Russians
into Europe—remembering that
in the Korean war, when Gen.
Mac Arthur had won the war by
his brilliant campaign from the
Inchon landing, President Tru
man yielded to the extremists
and pushed on to the Yalu River
and a military and political dis
aster—l was afraid when I heard
President Kennedy on Monday,
Oct. 22, that once again we were
on the line of unconditional sur
render and that once again we
would squander an attainable
victory by engaging in a crusade
to get rid of Castro.
This anxiety, I am happy to
say, was unfounded. Thus, as I
have learned since then, Ken
nedy did what Wilson, Roosevelt,
and Truman did not do. He kept
open the channel of diplomatic
communication with his adver
sary and he did not fall in with
those who in this war crisis, as
in all other war crises of this
century wanted not a settlement
hut a crusade.
As in all good settlements,
neither party is a loser and both
are the gainers. President Ken
nedy has freed the United States
and the Western hemisphere
from a very serious danger—
that there would be established
in our midst, and within reach of
a desperate and somewhat de
mented Castro, sufficient nuclear
power to strike a terrible blow
without warning. Chairman
Khrushchev has freed himself of
a very dangerous entanglement
in an area where the vital inter
ests of the Soviet Union are not
involved.
To my mind the biggest mys
tery of this whole affair is why
or how Chairman Khrushchev
ever got himself entangled in a
serious military way with Castro
and Cuba. Whatever the explana
tion, by stepping back he has
got rid of the entanglement.
WE ARE NOT, of course, at
the end of the Cuban problem.
But Castro and his Cubans now
know that they do not have the
military backing of the Soviet
Union, and that while they will
not he blockaded or invaded by
the United States, they will still
