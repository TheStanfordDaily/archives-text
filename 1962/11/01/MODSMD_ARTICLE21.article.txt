Kditor, The Daily:
After nearly four years of suf
fering and three prescription
changes, I feel as if 1 must sup
port a cause close to the retina of
every Stanford student’s eyes,
This reference to eye strain can
only apply to that center of intel
lectual turbulence known as the
Reserve Book Room. After col
lecting one’s book, a feat which
is in itself a worthy accomplish
ment, our hero is seen stumbling j
down what appears to be a dark
and damp passage, but what is in
reality a row between desks. Aft
er locating an empty perch by
, skillful use of a white cane, one
is ready for the major task of
his journey—that of reading his
book. Possibly he will be lucky
and be sitting directly under one
of the few lights that are still on.
If so, he will probably be able to
read 10 to 15 pages before uncon
trollable eye strain assaults him.
He will then be seen to squirm,
and consequently squeak his
chair, and his hands will be seen
to clench and attack the pupils
with unadulterated passion. He
will shift again and groan pro
fanities until finally surrendering
and groping his way from the en
veloping darkness.
Why must we stand back and
allow this insult to our intelli
gence and physical well being
conquer us? Did Mrs. Stanford
I state in her will that the “egg
carton” lights shall remain in
tact until the last one has flick
ered its final beam? There ap
pear to be only two solutions to
this ever present problem.
First, that this plea on behalf
of thousands of suffering eye
halls will prompt some action by
the proper authorities, whether
they be student or administra
tive.
And second, that bespectacled
and red eyed students of Stan
ford boldly, and without fear, at
tack the RBR at its weakest
point by ripping out, stepping on,
and completely annihilating
every light which adorns the ceil
ing. It will thus be necessary for
new, and more modern fixtures
to be installed in place of the
present antiaues.
Arise suffering ones and we
shall march on our enemy to
gether.
