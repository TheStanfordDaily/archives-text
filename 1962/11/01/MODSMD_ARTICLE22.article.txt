# RENFRO AGAINST TRIBE AGAIN
## Favored Ducks, Speedy Backs Await Tribe 
### JUSTIN BECK 
University of Oregon halfback
Mel Renfro should be a happy
man right now; Stanford is com
ing to Portland, Saturday.
Last year Renfro, a 9.6 sprint
er who can do almost everything,

did just about that against (he
Indians. He got his hands on the
football five times that afternoon
and accounted for all three of
Oregon’s touchdowns in (he
Ducks’ 19-7 win.
The 180-pound junior picked up
his first score on a four-yard
plunge the first lime he carried
the ball; he passed 39 yards for a
second score, and, after the In
dians got close, 13-7, he returned
a kickoff 94 yards for the final
touchdown. He also picked up
another 15 yards on a reverse and
caught a pass for 17 yards.
THIS YEAR the Ducks supply
Renfro, the nation’s seventh lead
ing rusher, with plenty of help,
too. Their backfield is loaded
with speed, mainly in the form
of sophomore halfbacks Larry
Hill and Lu Bain and senior full
back Jim Josephson. This year,
Hill has gone 49 yards for one
score and 50 yards on a pass
from Renfro for another.

Oregon’s line is bulwarked by
252-pound tackle Steve Barnett,
a second team All-American last
year, and 220-pound guard Mick
ey Ording. Barnett, a senior, was
All-Coast in both his sophomore
and junior seasons. Ording, All
Coast last year, is ranked as one
of the best guards in the coun
try and is probably the best on
the coast.
OREGON'S SPEED and line

add up to a high powered offense.
The offense’s only weak spot at
the season’s start was quarter
back where last year’s leader,
senior Doug Post, was lost with
a knee injury. However, sopho
more Bob ißerry, his replacement,
has done a good job in guiding
the Ducks to a 4-1-1 record.
Last year, the Tribe couldn’t
stop Renfro, or Oregon, and this
year it won’t be any easier.


STEVE BARNETT is known in Oregon as the “Baby Buffalo." The
250-pound tackle is a genuine All-American, equally adept at offense and defense.
