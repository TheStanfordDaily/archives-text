# Professor Chen Reads Paper on Chinese Poet
## 
### 
David Y. Chen of the Depart
ment of Asian Languages will
read a paper entitled “The Liter
ary Background of Li Ho (791-
817)” when the Seminar on East
Asian Thought and Society meets
tonight. The meeting will be held
in the lounge of Bowman Alumni
House at 7:45.
Professor Chen says, “Li Ho,
known as the ‘Ghostly Genius,’
was a major writer in the golden
age of Chinese poetry during the
T’ang. This paper will reconsider
Lo Ho’s position in Chinese Lit
erature by an analysis of his po
etic form with reference to his
literary heritage.”
Li Ho, Chen adds, has recently
attracted the attention of modern
critics because of his striking af
finity with modern poetics.
Refreshments will be served
after the reading.
