# Goetz Views Berlin Before, After Bombing
## 
### 
Dr. Rolf Goetz, news editor
and author for Radio In Ameri
can Sector Berlin, guided ap
proximately 73 people on an ex
cursion to West Berlin via 35mm
slides shown in the Rinconada
lounge last night.
Goetz, sponsored by the Gor
man Ministry, began the trip
with an imaginary flight from
the air port in Hanover to West
Berlin.
IN' A SERIES of flashbacks
to the war and ruin in Berlin,
Goetz pointedly illustrated the
build-up and reconstruction West
Berlin has undergone since the
war. Simultaneously, Goetz con
trasted the West Berlin build-up
with still-shambled East Berlin.
West Berlin now has a new
Congress Hall, nicknamed the
“Pregnant Oyster,” divided high
ways with no speed limit and the
Berlin Hilton with, as Goetz de
scribes it, “good beer, ice cream
and coca cola.”
Illustrating the contrast in
progress between the two sectors
in Berlin, Goetz explained why
he bc.lieved East Berlin has re
mained stagnant. “The commu
nists,” he said, “do not believe in
the past history of a nation as do
the German people.” West Ber
liners, he said, are rebuilding the
past and looking toward the fu
ture.
GOETZ CONCLUDED the pic
ture tour of Berlin with the his
tory of the wall. He said that the
purpose of the wall is not to keep
anyone out but to keep the East
Berliners in. Goetz believes that
93 per cent of the people in East
Berlin would come to the free
sector if they were allowed to. He
said that since 1950, 11 million
people have fled from the eastern
section of (lie city. Since the wall,
August, 1961, 12,300 have es
caped, he added.
