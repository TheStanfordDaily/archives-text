# Police to Combat Agressive' Dogs
## 
### 
Tresidder Union has gone to
the dogs.
At least these were the fears
of Police Chief Gordon Davis yes
terday when he asked the Santa
Clara County Health Service to
make periodical checks around
the campus to pick up any un
leashed dogs unaccompanied by
their owners. He said that the
animals were becoming an in
creasing nuisance, especially in
the Tresidder Union area.
Chief Davis said a number of
students have encouraged the
dogs to beg for handouts from
the people eating on the patio
with the result that the animals
are becoming aggressive. Some
have even learned to enter the
dining room through the auto
matic doors, he reported.

He said that the unleashed
dogs would be picked up and
taken to the San Jose Animal
Shelter where their owners can
claim thorn. They would be held
there for four days and then be
made available for sale. He warn
ed that the County Health Serv
ice will pick up loose animals
anywhere on campus, not just in
the Union area.
