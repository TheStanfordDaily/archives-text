Not my church—Not your church
but the
CHURCH of
CHRIST
Matt. 16:16—1 8; Rom. 16:16
Christ established his church
not upon Peter (Gr.PETROS), a
temporary stone, but upon (Gr.
PETRA), the eternal truths that
inspire faith, confirm the divin
ity of Christ, and that caused
Peterto confess to Christ: "Thou
art the Christ, the son of the
living God".
You also can learn, believe,
and obey the same truths from
the Bible that inspired faith,
hope, and love and that caused
Christ to add early disciples to
his church. Acts 2:37-47. To
obey 99% Bible and 1 % some
thing else is to become some
thing else.
In Acts 2:37-47 there existed
one church. This church hon
ored Christ in name (Acts 4:12)
and in doctrine (Acts 2:42).
