BAHA'U'LLAH
"The Promised One
Has Come"
"The lovers of mankind,
these are the superior men,
of whatever nation, creed
or color they may be."
"The vitality of men s be
lief in God is dying out in
every land; nothing short
of his wholesome medicine
can ever restore it. The
: corrosion of ungodliness is
eating into the vitals of
human society; what else
but the Elixir of His potent
Revelation can cleanse and
revive it."
