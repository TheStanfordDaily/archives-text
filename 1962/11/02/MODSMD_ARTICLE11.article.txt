# LASSU Opposes Proposition 24; Class Governments Get Reprieve
## 
### 
Two resolutions were passed
by LASSU last night concerning
the forthcoming California elec
tions. In one, the legislature went
on record disapproving Proposi
tion 24, the subversive control
amendment.

In other business, the legisla
ture approved all amendments to
the constitution, but failed to
reach any decision on class gov
ernment abolition and overnight
restrictions.

The legislature meeting, which
was delayed a half hour so that
representatives could hear the
talk by Professor Wasserstrom
on Proposition 24, the Francis
Amendment, began with a dis
cussion of state propositions af
fecting higher education.
A resolution was passed ex
pressing the legislatureâ€™s approv
al of Proposition 13, tax exemp
tion on property used exclusively
for educational purposes by pri
vate colleges and universities.
Then, after some debate, a reso
lution was passed disapproving
Proposition 24. The vote was 15-3
with two abstaining.

THE controversial amendment
by substitution motion to abolish
class government was re-intro
duced early in the meeting. Be
cause of the large amount of
work remaining on the constitu
tion, it was moved and passed to
limit debate on the motion to 15
minutes. Jerry Jackson then
moved that the motion be refer
red to the By-laws Committee.

Explaining his motion, Jackson
said that the 15-minute debate
would not allow the legislature
to give careful attention to the
now issue that has been intro
duced, namely the suggestion by

Junior Class President Richard
Hillman that the class govern
ments be given new responsibili
ties. The motion passed by a 9-6
vote.

President Armin Rosencranz
pointed out that since this motion
will not bo acted on before the
Fall elections the amendment mo
tion would have no bearing on
the forthcoming freshman class
officer election. It is believed that
since legislature did not vote on
the amendment, the future of
class government has taken a
turn for the better. Indications
are that class governments will
lake over certain campus activi
ties presently under the super
vision of the Associated Students.

ALL ARTICLES of the pro
posed new constitution were riis

cussed and met with final approv
al. A motion that a statement bo
inserted in the Judicial article,
stipulating that a person should
not bo required to testify against
himself, was defeated. A motion
which would give the accused
the right to confront his accuser
met a similar fate. All other ar
ticles were approved after brief
discussion.
The By-law Committee, report
ing on the proposal to modify
overnight restrictions, said that
there would be two meetings
Monday to hear arguments con
cerning the overnight provisions
now in effect. It was pointed out
that the provisions passed last
week were still in effect.
Other business before the legis
lature included the approval of
an ad hoc Committee on Aesthet
ics and Logistics in the ASSU Of
fice. Explaining his proposal, Ro
sencranz explained that owing to
the recent disputes over office
space and purchase of new desks,
the legislature should assume the
job of making policy decisions
about the kind of desks.

All living groups that are
planning Big Game Over
nights must register their
functions in the ASSU office
by Nov. 12. Social chairmen
may now pick up copies of
the new procedures on over
night registration in the
ASSU Office. Priscilla Fer
guson, ASSU vice-president,
will answer any questions.
