# DU PLESSIS:
## South Africa Facing 'Inevitable' Revolution 
### SUSAN BROWN 
“I feel that my thinking is in
a very real way limited by my en
vironment," wrote Adrian du
Plessis from his home in South
Africa, when he applied for an
ASSU scholarship last year.
"Meeting new thoughts and ideas
is the essence of a true education
and in this country we are ex
tremely handicapped in that wo
tend to be insulated, both because
of our geographical position and
because of our pre-occupation
with internal problems which
breeds limited outlook.”
Du Plessis is now an ASSU
scholar studying political science
at Stanford, and is living this
quarter in Toyon, as a member
of Los Arcos Eating Club. He at
tended the University of Natal in
Durban and served there last
year as student body president.
“There are English, Afrikaans,
and non-European universities in
South Africa," he explained. The
Afrikaans are all-white, but Eng
lish universities have traditional
ly admitted a limited number of
Africans. A recent law in South
Africa, however, has ruled that
all university enrollment be de
termined by race; soon each Af
rican tribe, the Indians, and the
Europeans will be restricted to
their own separate universities.
DU PLESSIS has been very ac
tive in the National Union of
South African Students
(NUSAS), to which the English
and non-European universities
are affiliated. Because most of
the students in his country are
so apathetic, he explained, a
quite liberal minority has been
able to gain election to student
offices, and their opinions are
reflected in the activities of their
local and national student or
ganizations.
NUSAS schedules inter-racial
conferences, sponsors activities
aimed at reducing racial tension,
and tries to enhance educational
opportunities for African youth.
The organization is largely sup

ported by foreign contributions,
particularly from N.S.A. in the
United States and from the Scan
dinavian countries, Du Plessis
said.
He feels that the white liberals
in South Africa will have no in
fluence in bringing about a more
moderate opinion or policy among
the majorities of racially-minded
whites and blacks. "Because we
see a non-racial society as the
only solution,” said Du Plessis,
"we are denounced by the apar
theid whites as well as by most
blacks, who want to throw the
Europeans out.”
“A REVOLUTION is inevitable
in South Africa,” he continued,
“in twenty years, at the most, al
though today most whites are un
concerned even about such a pos
sibility.” He sees the only pos
sible tasks of the white liberals as
attempting to act as a buffer be
tween the violent forces, and as
trying to aid in the education of
moderate African leaders.
Du Plessis has been an active
participant in the UNESCO-spon
sored International Work Camps
Association, which arranges work
camps on a non-racial basis, and
has attended one in Basutoland.
He also spent three months work
ing in a copper mine in Northern
Rhodesia, nine miles from the
Congolese border. As he was
there six months after the Congo
crisis began in 1960, he had a
great deal of contact with refu
gees. who were pouring into the
town where he lived, and thus
had a unique personal opportuni
ty to learn of the problems asso
ciated with the crisis.
When asked about his impres
sions about the recent incident
in Mississippi, Du Plessis said, “I
was amazed that such a situation
could arise, and that a man like
Barnett would receive so much
support.” He found it very sur
prising that student leadership at
Stanford did not organize or ex
press support for Meredith, es
pecially after NSA had called for
it.

He feels that the white liberals
in South Africa will have no in
fluence in bringing about a more
moderate opinion or policy among
the majorities of racially-minded
whites and blacks. "Because we
see a non-racial society as the
only solution,” said Du Plessis,
"we are denounced by the apar
theid whites as well as by most
blacks, who want to throw the
Europeans out.”
“A REVOLUTION is inevitable
in South Africa,” he continued,
“in twenty years, at the most, al
though today most whites are un
concerned even about such a pos
sibility.” He sees the only pos
sible tasks of the white liberals as
attempting to act as a buffer be
tween the violent forces, and as
trying to aid in the education of
moderate African leaders.
Du Plessis has been an active
participant in the UNESCO-spon
sored International Work Camps
Association, which arranges work
camps on a non-racial basis, and
has attended one in Basutoland.
He also spent three months work
ing in a copper mine in Northern
Rhodesia, nine miles from the
Congolese border. As he was
there six months after the Congo
crisis began in 1960, he had a
great deal of contact with refu
gees. who were pouring into the
town where he lived, and thus
had a unique personal opportuni
ty to learn of the problems asso
ciated with the crisis.
When asked about his impres
sions about the recent incident
in Mississippi, Du Plessis said, “I
was amazed that such a situation
could arise, and that a man like
Barnett would receive so much
support.” He found it very sur
prising that student leadership at
Stanford did not organize or ex
press support for Meredith, es
pecially after NSA had called for
it.
“I feel that my thinking is in
a very real way limited by my en
vironment," wrote Adrian du
Plessis from his home in South
Africa, when he applied for an
ASSU scholarship last year.
"Meeting new thoughts and ideas
is the essence of a true education
and in this country we are ex
tremely handicapped in that wo
tend to be insulated, both because
of our geographical position and
because of our pre-occupation
with internal problems which
breeds limited outlook.”
Du Plessis is now an ASSU
scholar studying political science
at Stanford, and is living this

“There are English, Afrikaans,
and non-European universities in
South Africa," he explained. The
Afrikaans are all-white, but Eng
lish universities have traditional
ly admitted a limited number of
Africans. A recent law in South
Africa, however, has ruled that
all university enrollment be de
termined by race; soon each Af
rican tribe, the Indians, and the
Europeans will be restricted to
their own separate universities.

are affiliated. Because most of
the students in his country are
so apathetic, he explained, a
quite liberal minority has been
able to gain election to student
offices, and their opinions are
reflected in the activities of their
local and national student or

NUSAS schedules inter-racial

aimed at reducing racial tension,
