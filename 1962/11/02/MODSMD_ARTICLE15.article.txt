Editor, The Daily:
The Monash University Stu
dents’ Representative Council,
Victoria, Australia, passed a reso
lution on 2nd October that the fol
lowing statement be sent to ma
jor publications throughout the
United States of America.

“Through the medium of the
Australian Press, we have receiv
ed reports describing the recent
events concerning the attempted
exclusion of negro student James
Meredith from the University of
Mississippi. The Students’ Repre
sentative Council of Monash Uni
versity, Victoria, deplores the
fact that students of the Univer
sity of Mississippi have actively
participated in upholding the ra
cialist policies of segregationist,
Governor Barnett.
We consider that the actions of
these students constitute a fla
grant breach not only of the prin
ciples of liberty and equality as
out in the Declaration of Inde
pendence but are a regression to
wards the worst tyjie of fascist
behaviour.
This blatant exhibition of racial
discrimination will, we feel, af

feet considerable harm to Ameri
ca’s image, that of a powerful na
tion and people assisting those of
races and countries which are in
a more unfortunate situation
than themselves.

Inevitably the ‘incidents’ of the
South will have damaging effects
on American relationships with
the coloured peoples of the world
to the detriment of official U.S.
policy which has endeavoured to
embrace and befriend all the
races of the free world, no matter
what their colour or creed.

This behaviour on the part of
the Mississippi students is all the
more deplorable in that educated
people have actively expressed a
primitive racial intolerance. Edu
cation should breed justice and a
consciousness of human values,
instead it would appear that
these students of the South have
been unable to suppress their in
herent inbred bias. The Univer
sity-educated should have suffici
ent; foresight to be social reform
ers, not advocates of a partisan
policy which is the antithesis of
democracy.”

The Monash University Stu
dents’ Representative Council,
Victoria, Australia, passed a reso
lution on 2nd October that the fol
lowing statement be sent to ma
jor publications throughout the
United States of America.

“Through the medium of the
Australian Press, we have receiv
ed reports describing the recent
events concerning the attempted
exclusion of negro student James
Meredith from the University of
Mississippi. The Students’ Repre
sentative Council of Monash Uni
versity, Victoria, deplores the
fact that students of the Univer
sity of Mississippi have actively
participated in upholding the ra
cialist policies of segregationist,
Governor Barnett.
We consider that the actions of
these students constitute a fla
grant breach not only of the prin
ciples of liberty and equality as
out in the Declaration of Inde
pendence but are a regression to
wards the worst tyjie of fascist
behaviour.
This blatant exhibition of racial
discrimination will, we feel, af

feet considerable harm to Ameri
ca’s image, that of a powerful na
tion and people assisting those of
races and countries which are in
a more unfortunate situation
than themselves.

Inevitably the ‘incidents’ of the
South will have damaging effects
on American relationships with
the coloured peoples of the world
to the detriment of official U.S.
policy which has endeavoured to
embrace and befriend all the
races of the free world, no matter
what their colour or creed.

This behaviour on the part of
the Mississippi students is all the
more deplorable in that educated
people have actively expressed a
primitive racial intolerance. Edu
cation should breed justice and a
consciousness of human values,
instead it would appear that
these students of the South have
been unable to suppress their in
herent inbred bias. The Univer
sity-educated should have suffici
ent; foresight to be social reform
ers, not advocates of a partisan
policy which is the antithesis of
democracy.”
