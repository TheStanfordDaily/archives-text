# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Requiem for a Heavyweight' Actually a Very Good Movie 
### STEVE ZOUSMER Contributing Editor 
(“Requiem for a Heavyweight" is playing at the Park Theater
in Menlo Park.)

“Requiem for a Heavyweight,” a movie about a prizefighter who
has lost his punch and a lot of his mind, packs a hig wallop and
plenty of talent. It is a very good movie. The oppressive sordidness
and cruelty of the “fight game” hit you like a ninety-minute upper
cut and leave you with the sweaty, uncomfortable feeling that your

head is wedged up inside a punch-'
ing bag.
The acting in the former TV
play by Rod Sel ling is excellent.
Anthony Quinn and Jackie Glea
son are great and Mickey Rooney
and Julie Harris do well in small
er roles. The only flaw in the
acting is the real fighters Holly
wood has dug up for atmosphere:
such screen favorites as Jack
Dempsey, Cassius Clay, and the
immortal Paoli Rossi, whoever he
is.

for him as “Big Chief Mountain,”
a wrestling member of the clown
and grunt set. But then the gang
sters come in. and the gun moll
leader of the hoods, who is a ra
ther absurd leftover from Ca
pone days, tells Mache that her
boys will carve him up now be
cause Mountain has refused to
wrassle for the pay-off money.
So Mountain decides that if
Mache’s bod is at stake, he will
eat his pride and go sling the
bulls around in the ring upstairs.
That’s the story. It’s a good one
and the acting is fine. The only
trouble is that the unbroken
grimness makes it difficult to en
dure; how long can you eat pop
corn in a graveyard, even if the
graveyard is an Oscar winner?

QUINN plays Mountain Rivera,
formerly the fifth-ranked heavy
weight contender but now k has
been pug well on his way to
bumsville. In the opening five
minutes we see through his eyes
what it looks like to gel smeared
in the fight ring, and this must
stand as one of the best, scenes
ever filmed. Opponent Cassius
Clay jabs, prances around, finally
comes in with the knockout
punch. From the canvass our
vision is blurred by the effect of
the punch and the dazzling flash
bulbs and floodlights at ringside.
The crowd curses and shouts, the
world whirls, and we are helpless.
Mountain is carried to the
dressing room, where the doctor
declares that he can never fight
again. But after seventeen years
of wiping out people in the ring,
Mountain knows no other trade.
This is the dilemma. Who will
lend a hand to the ugly and blur
ry-minded but pathetic stumble
bum?
Not his manager, “Mache”
(Gleason). Mache needs money
to pay off the gamblers who lost
big betting on his prediction that
the Mountain couldn’t last four
rounds against Clay (he went
seven), and the only way Mache
can get this money is by getting
Mountain to turn wrestler.
BUT BEHIND his scar tissue,
Mountain is a sensitive guy who
can’t take being laughed at, as
wrestlers are laughed at. Mache.
his guardian for all these years,
tells Mountain, “You owe me.”
Mountain’s second throughout
his career I Mickey Rooney) does
not want to see the boxer humili
ated, used by Mache. “•Hey
Mache,” he says. “Yeah,’ says
Mache. “You stink,” he says.
Also coming to Mountain’s aid
is a wide- and wet-eyed social
worker, Miss Miller (Julie Har
ris). She will help him get a job
as a camp counsellor. But by the
time Mountain shows up for an
interview with the camp owners,
Mache has gotten him drunk. The
camp owners don’t cotton to the
idea of a booze-hounding monster
around the campfire with their
scouts.
MOUNTAIN runs away and
Miss Miller follows him to his
apartment deep in the garbage
section of New York City. Miss
Miller has guts, as well as tears
and sympathy. Mountain regrets
that he’s just not counsellor ma
terial, but he is touched by her
attention and affection. Then,
briefly going off his psychologi
cal cliff, the Mountain makes, a
try for the crevice of her Fuji

leaves.
Mache gets him as far as the
dressing room before poor Moun
