Editor, Tin* Daily:
Chaparral really has no need
for more people to come to its
keg party this afternoon but,
since Chappie people are well
known for their tendency to fink
out when it comes to working on
the magazine, we invite you to
come anyway if you’ll say that
you’ll maybe work for us some
time if you feel like it. Chappies
will be wailing for neophytes
(that’s what we call suckers who
come to work for us) between
two o’clock and three-thirty Fri
day afternoon at our office, a
gross old shack between the wom
en’s gym and geology corner
(which is quite an interesting
combination, we think). Appear
and you’ll be whisked off to
Chaparral fun and frolic.

Editor, The Daily:
I feel obliged to correct a mis
take which appeared in my arti
cle on South Africa in the Daily
of Wednesday.
You printed the following sen
tence: “The English universities
will then shortly join the ranks of
what are known by the African
students as the ‘lily-white
schools,’ i.e. the Africans univer
sities.’’ This sentence is meaning
less and should have read “ . . .
i.e. the Afrikaans universities.”
Afrikaans is a language de
rived mainly from Dutch, and
spoken by 60 per cent of the
white population, known as “Af
rikaners.” The Afrikaans univer
sities have never admitted any
non-white students, hence the
term “lily-white,” used to de
scribe them by the African stu
dents.
By inadvertently equating “Af
rican’ and "Afrikaans” you have
done something akin to naming
Governor Barnett national chair
man of the N.A.A.C.P.
It is interesting to reflect that
any editor of a South African
publication who confused these
terms may be accused of deliber
ately insulting one of the racial
groups in the country, thus caus
ing friction between the races.
This, as defined by the recent
Sabotage Act. is sabotage, and
the onus would be on the editor
to prove that this was not his in
tention. Conviction under this act
carries a minimum penalty of
five years imprisonment; the
maximum is death.

(Editor’s note: Willing but un
able to prove his good intentions,
the editor pleads guilty.)
