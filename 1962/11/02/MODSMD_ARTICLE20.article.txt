# ASSU SCHOLAR:
## 'West Must Not Yield on Berlin To Communists' 
### KLAUS R. SCHERPE 
(Editor’s note: Klaus Scherpe
is a native of Berlin and is pres
ently an ASSU foreign scholar
studying English and German lit
ature. In 1949, for political rea
sons, his family moved to West
Berlin from Last Berlin.)
Since November 27, 1958, when
the Soviet Union started its well
known attack on the legal Four
Power Status of Beilin, the peace
of the world has been threatened
as much as ever before in post
war history.
Many people are not yet fully
aware that Berlin is not and has
never been an isolated problem.
Any decisions and agreements
over Berlin have to be found in
the larger scope of the Western
policy as a whole. As such, fail
ure and success of the allied poli
cy over Berlin will be viewed by
the world, especially the neutral
countries in Africa and Asia.
BKKLIN IS, indeed, only .a
crystallization point of world poli
tics, a barometer of the cold war.
The Kremlin intends no more
and no less than a new trial of
strength to prove its superiorly
over the West. What were the
main Soviet goals in starting the
Berlin crisis? First, to eliminate
Berlin as a symbol of freedom;
then, to complete the division of
Germany, and secure the Com
munist stronghold in central
Europe.
The reason for the stirring up
of the Berlin question was to find
out where there are weak points
in the West. The Soviets have the
power of artifically creating a
crisis, wherever and whenever
they want. Thus they impress
public opinion in the Western
countries in order to keep a pres
sure on the politicians to make
concessions in the face of a war
like situation. Since this is so,
any negotiations at which West
Berlin will be the only subject
under discussion appears to Ber
liners, as unrealistic and danger
ous.
Nothing can be gained by giving
in in Berlin. The Berliners be
lieve very strongly in the guar
antees which President Kennedy
has given for their security and
welfare. So it would have a dis
astrous effect on the Berlin popu
lation if any American troops
were to Ik* removed from Berlin:
even the replacement of allied
troops by UN representatives
would be a shock.
THE SOVIETS are quite aware
of the genera] feeling in the Unit
ed States to compromise rather
than risk on all-out war. As long
as we still leave some doubt
about the extent of our willing
ness to fight back, we risk hav
ing further aggression on the
part of the Communists.
THE ACT of terror of August
13, 1961, was wholly illegal since
East Berlin, which also is under
Four Power administration, was
formally annexed by the East
German regime. We should be
firm in preventing any more vio
lation of the rights which the
three allies hold over the whole
of Berlin territory.
It became evident during the
past few months that the Krem
lin aims primarily at getting a
de facto recognition of the East
German puppet government. In
order to get this recognition as
sured, the Soviets increase the
pressure on Berlin. We should
realize that giving in here means
to complete the division of Ger
many and encourage the Com
munist aggression into Western
Europe. It would mean to give up
17 million people in East Ger
many and East Berlin for whom
we have been the only hope for
freedom and peace for the past
10 years.
THERE HAS been some excite
ment about anti-American dem
onstrations on the part of the
West Berliners when an East
German youth who had tried to
escape w’as left bleeding behind
the wall, the Americans standing
by without coming to his aid.
Most of (he West Berliners feel
very sorry for these demonstra
tions of an irresponsible minori
ty, because they realize that any
disagreement between the Ber
liners and their American friends
would bring advantage for the
Communist side.
The Berliners expect the Amer
icans, British and French to hold
a firm position in Berlin, accord
ing to their legal rights. The
guarantees given by President
Kennedy and the NATO coun
tries should be reaffirmed again
and again. Our final aim and de
sire is to bring about the removal
of the wall of shame and to re
store to Berlin the functions of a
real German capital city. This can
be achieved only when everybody
in the Free World realizes that
he has to support this aim, not
only because he sympathizes
with the pitiable situation of the
Divided City and the people liv
ing there, but because every
thing he believes in may be se
cured or lost with the fate of
! this town.
