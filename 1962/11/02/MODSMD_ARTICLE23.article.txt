# DUCKS' HAVE TOP OFFENSE
## Indians' Task is Clear—Upset Oregon 
### JUSTIN BECK 
With memories of UCLA fresh
in their minds the Indians go for
their second upset win in a row
as they take the field against the

Oregon Ducks tomorrow at 1:30
in Portland’s Multnomah Stadi
um.
Rated a 13-point underdog, the
Cards have the work cut out for
them. Oregon has lost only one
game this year, a 25-13 loss to
Texas in the season’s opener, and
has gone on to a current 4-1-1 rec
ord.
FIRST THE Indians have to
stop the nation’s top offense, a
powerhouse averaging 413 yards
a game. Second they have to get

a consistent attack of their own
going.
Stanford’s defense, the best in
the AAWU, is going to meet what
is probably its toughest test of
the season in Oregon. The Ducks
have great speed with halfbacks
Mel Renfro, probably the best
halfback on the coast, and Larry
Hill; good depth at fullback with
Bruce Snyder, Jim Josephson,
and Duane Cargill; and good
passing with surprising sopho
more Bob Berry at quarterback.

Ronfro can also throw tho half
back pass, tossing two touch
down passes this year.
Oregon’s All-American tackle,
Steve Barnett and All-Coast
guard Mickey Ordlng, stand out
on a forward wall averaging 215
pounds a man. Ron Snidow, the
other tackle, handles the Ducks’
punting.
THE INDIANS have been
working mainly on offense this
week, trying to develop an at
tack that can score consistently.
Fortunately for the Tribe, the
Webfoots’ defense Is not as solid
is their offense, and Stanford’s
offense, last in the AAWU, has
been looking better as of late,
Steve Thurlow, one of Coach
Jack Curtice’s alternating quar
terbacks has, on the basis of the
last two games, looked as if he is
going to give the Indians a steady
pasing attack, a characteristic of
most of Curtice’s teams. The In
dian running game has shown
promise too, with tho steady run
ning of halfback Jack Lodato and
the improvement of sophomore
halfback John Paye.
In the Indian offense clicks,
and the defense proves that it is
a match for the Ducks’ offense,
the Cards may do something that
they haven’t done since 1956
beat Oregon.
Probable starting lineups:
OREGON STANFORD
Imwall LER Patitucci
Snidow LTR Atkinson
Thomas LGR Dubofsky
Dixon C Simons
Ording RGL Harris
Barnett RTL Buehler
Willener REL Pursell
Berry Q Thurlow
Renfro LHR Sargent
Hill RHL Lodato

MEL RENFRO is a jack-of-all trades. Against Stanford last year he
ran for two touchdowns and passed for the third in a 19-7 Oregon
win. He also broad jumps 26-feet for the track team.

Jack Curtice’s alternating quar
terbacks has, on the basis of the
last two games, looked as if he is
going to give the Indians a steady
pasing attack, a characteristic of
most of Curtice’s teams. The In
dian running game has shown
promise too, with tho steady run
ning of halfback Jack Lodato and
the improvement of sophomore
halfback John Paye.
In the Indian offense clicks,
and the defense proves that it is
a match for the Ducks’ offense,
the Cards may do something that
they haven’t done since 1956
beat Oregon.

MEL RENFRO is a jack-of-all trades. Against Stanford last year he
ran for two touchdowns and passed for the third in a 19-7 Oregon
win. He also broad jumps 26-feet for the track team.
With memories of UCLA fresh
in their minds the Indians go for
their second upset win in a row
as they take the field against the

Oregon Ducks tomorrow at 1:30
in Portland’s Multnomah Stadi
um.
Rated a 13-point underdog, the
Cards have the work cut out for
them. Oregon has lost only one
game this year, a 25-13 loss to
Texas in the season’s opener, and
has gone on to a current 4-1-1 rec
ord.
FIRST THE Indians have to
stop the nation’s top offense, a
powerhouse averaging 413 yards
a game. Second they have to get

a consistent attack of their own
going.
Stanford’s defense, the best in
the AAWU, is going to meet what
is probably its toughest test of
the season in Oregon. The Ducks
have great speed with halfbacks
Mel Renfro, probably the best
halfback on the coast, and Larry
Hill; good depth at fullback with
Bruce Snyder, Jim Josephson,
and Duane Cargill; and good
passing with surprising sopho
more Bob Berry at quarterback.

Ronfro can also throw tho half
back pass, tossing two touch
down passes this year.
Oregon’s All-American tackle,
Steve Barnett and All-Coast
guard Mickey Ordlng, stand out
on a forward wall averaging 215
pounds a man. Ron Snidow, the
other tackle, handles the Ducks’
punting.
THE INDIANS have been
working mainly on offense this
week, trying to develop an at
tack that can score consistently.
Fortunately for the Tribe, the
Webfoots’ defense Is not as solid
is their offense, and Stanford’s
offense, last in the AAWU, has
been looking better as of late,
Steve Thurlow, one of Coach
Jack Curtice’s alternating quar
