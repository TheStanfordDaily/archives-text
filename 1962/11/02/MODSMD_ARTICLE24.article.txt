# Papoose Gridders Ready Defense for Cal Passing Threat
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Thoir victory streak snapped
at two straight, Stanford’s fresh
man football team attempts to
end the season on a winning note
tomorrow when the Indians take
on California’s first-year men at
10:30 in Stanford Stadium.
The Bears will undoubtedly re
sort to a passing attack against
the Cards, having watched with
interest the seeming ease with
which UCLA’s flashy quarter
back Rod Sherman picked Stan
ford’s secondary apart with his
bullet passes last weekend. The
Card defense not only allowed
Bruin receivers, especially Bob
Richardson, to get clear, but was
guilty of two pass interference
penalties as well.
STANFORD HAS a strong,
fairly swift defensive backfield,
but their experience against
passes has been somewhat limit
ed. The Indians’ first game,
against SC, was played in con
ditions that made passing a non
existent threat. In the next two
games, against San Jose and
UCLA, quarterbacks Ken Berry
and Sherman were able to chalk
up considerable yardage by pass
ing.
Meanwhile, Stanford’s long
dormant passing attack showed
signs of awakening against the
Bruins. Led by the throwing of
second string quarterback Don
Cook, the Cards scored both of
their touchdowns through the air.
The new found aerial threat,
mixed with the consistantly ef
fective running of Glenn Myers,
Ray Handley and Mike Connelly,
should offer Cal’s defense plenty
to keep them occupied.
Stanford apeared to hit their
peak in the first game of the sea
son, a convincing win over
Southern California. After this
upset, they were barely able to
hang on against a rugged San
Jose State team. This preceded
the loss to UCLA. If Stanford is
to beat the Cal bear, they must
combine the aggressive, spirited
line play of the first game with
the offensive strength of the sec
ond and third games.
