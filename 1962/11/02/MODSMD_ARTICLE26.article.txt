# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Soccer Team Prepares To Stop Jim Lynch 
### Glenn Alford 
For the pasl four years Soccer Coach Fred Priddle has been pre
dicting a Northern California Inter-Collegiate Soccer Conference
championship for the Big Red. Stanford did manage to take the
NCISC title once, and on the two occasions they didn’t make it, one
man was largely responsible. This same man is the obstacle Stanford
must overcome tomorrow if they arc to win this year and make
Coach Priddle’s prediction come true.
USF invades the Farm tomorrow to play Stanford for the right
to represent the NCISC in the NCAA soccer playoffs. Priddle will
start a sophomore-studded lineup including Kent Mueller and Tom
Paulson, goalies; Sandy Pofahl and Rich Lonergan, fullbacks; Jim
Armstrong, Bill Teusch and Don Burr, halfbacks; Larry Chukwude
he, A1 Nnoli, Stu Rawlings, Don Grifilh, and either Ed Clark or Klas
Bergman, forwards.
Jim Lynch is the name of the obstacle, and he plays the center
forward position for the University of San Francisco. Lynch played
for the Dons last year, and for two seasons previously he saw action
for City College of San Francisco.
He started his dirty work in the autumn of 1959, while wearing
a CCSF uniform. Stanford had come off a hard-fought win over the
Cal Aggies and were making noises like champs. Lynch led CCSF
to a stunning 2-1 win over Stanford in one of the best-played collegi
ate soccer games ever. He toed both of the visitors’ goals.
In 1960 it was more of the same. Stanford was riding high after
having tumbled USF, power of the NCISC for as long as any local
soccer coaches care to remember. The Indians visited CCSF and
went away defeated 5-1. Lynch scored three times and assisted a
fourth goal. This was the year Stanford won the conference title, as
California defeated Stanford during the regular season, but was
caught using eight ineligible players and had to forfeit their games
after the campaign was over.
Last season. Stanford was a pre-season favorite to take all the
marbles, with two returning all-conference players and one returning
second team all-leaguer. Ineligibilities cost Stanford the champion
ship that year, as two of the three aforementioned stars had to drop
out. Still, Stanford trounced Cal to keep them out of the NCAA
playoffs, but lost 3-1 to USF, eventual NCISC entrant in the playoffs.
That Man Again
Should Stanford beat the Dons they will likely go to the regional
NCAA playoffs, regardless of the outcome of their appearance
against San Jose State. Even if they do lose to USF they possibly
will be the NCISC playoff representative, since USF still has to play
powerful California, and has already bowed to San Francisco State,
a team the Cards massacred 7-2.
The only other potential West Coast representatives are UCLA,
USC and Cal Poly, but these are dark horses. Traditionally, the
NCISC champ is chosen to represent the West Coast.
If Stanford does receive the West Coast nomination the hooters
will journey to the Midwest on November 17 to meet either St. Louis,
Michigan State or the Air Force Academy. They will play in St.
Louis, East Lansing or Colorado Springs, depending on who repre
sents the Midwest.
Meet Me in St. Louis
Should they win again, they will play in St. Louis on Thanks
giving Day. Another triumph would put them in the finals two days
later.
Stanford’s play of late has been nothing short of sensational,
leading me to believe that Stanford not only will contain the great
Lynch well enough to win, but will also march right through all their
opposition into the NCAA finals.
This is more than a just slightly rash statement, but there is
one other factor to be considered. After having viewed the playoff
contest last year between St. Louis and USF. Priddle said that Stan
ford. then fourth in the league, would have beaten the other team.
Stanford will definitely not finish fourth this year.
