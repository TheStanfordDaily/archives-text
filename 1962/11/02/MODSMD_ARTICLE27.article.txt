# Stanford Harriers Face San Jose State
## 
### PETE KING 
Although they’ll be underdogs,
Stanford’s fast-improving cross
country team should give un
beaten San Jose State its tough
est race yet tomorrow in a four
way duel at Berkeley with Cal
and UCLA.
The Spartans are rated by
Stanford coach Payton Jordan as
the finest team in the country.
They have overwhelmed all of
their-opponents, having posted a
pair of 21-43 and 19-40 wins over
the Indians. Last week SJS fresh

man Danny Murphy set a Stan
ford course record of 20:09.2 in a
dual meet with the Tribe.
However, San Jose’s initial two
wins over Stanford were lopsided
mainly because the Spartans
were in much better condition.
The Card harriers have since
been reducing San Jose’s early
season conditioning advantage,
and last week they breezed to
victories over UCLA and USC.
Harry McCalla, Dave Deubner,
Paul Schlicke, Harlan Andrews,
Weym Kirkland, Bob Miltz, and
Bill Pratt will run tomorrow for
Stanford.
