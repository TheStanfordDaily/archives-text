# Nasty Chappie On Sale; Could Lead to Uprisings
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Do you like God? Then you're
going to abhor the Chappie’s ini
tial effort of the year, uncaged
today.
For an inflationary penny a
page 40 of each you can bo
blighted by countless sacrileges
defaming Memorial Church, Min
to, Mormons, Moses, and mora
lists.
Listed in a parody of the Stan
ford “Time Schedule” is this per
version: “Second coming of Christ
(classes as usual) . . . Oct. 31,”
A photo of Mom Chu in “Chap
pie Guide to Campus Landmarks”
disgracefully desecrates this holy
edifice; it is pictured draped in a
“Bingo Tonight” banner.
NOB SHOULD Jane Stanford’s
girdles highly personal objects

be mentioned in print.
The Time Schedule, accurately
reproduced on the cover, may fool
some profs and drive the regis
trar’s office frantic. It may also
result in a ban-the-Chappie move
ment that would have HUAC
rioters weeping in shame.
Dr Eickart is scandalously
linked with the feminine breast;
Stern, with turkeys and Thurs
days. Insults are slung at PACE,
the Sequoia, the geography de
partment. Scotty Thompson, and
Branner girls.
And what smutty insults, dear
readers. Pure and chaste Cardi
nals Board will reel in agony if
a Chappie comes its way.

FORTUNATELY, much of the
issue is no worse than the usual
Chaparral chaff.
A pictoral review of the Friends
of Wagnerian Opera is totally de
void of humor merely a poor ex
cuse to preserve in half-tone for
time immemorial the degenerate
visages of vain Chappie staffers
and associates.

They weren’t clever enough to
mock religion in this story with
out a deviation from the plot, the
discovery by a former Old Boy
of gold tablets in the hills . . .

Most of the cartoons, as is the
Chappie’s habit, have been lifted
from Eastern college humor mag
azines. The .jokes, again as usual,
carry overtones of sex that send
Chappie staffers into paroxysms
of ribald laughter and leave the
rest of us cold.

THE BEST STOHV in this pot
pourri of uncouth trivia is “Pas
sion on the Pav”, written, to no
one’s surprise, by a member of
the Daily Staff, Contributing Edi
j tor Steve Zousmer, who at his
J worst outshines the lackluster
Chappie crew.
In “Common Freshman Ques
| tions” Stanford women are ac-
I cused of wearing no pants, no
I lipstick, and straight hair.
We wonder if the entire female
i student body is capable of carry
j ing away the Chappie shack with
j the staff inside and dumping it
i into the bay. No, I guess not. The
I stench would drive them away.
