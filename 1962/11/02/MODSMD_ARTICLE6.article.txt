# Opposition Voiced By Wosserstrom To Proposition 24
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
If Proposilion 24 is voted into
the state constitution next Tues
day, it will tend to make citizens
afraid to join organizations which
advocate any cause, said Professor
Richard Wosscrstrom of the Law
School and Philosophy Depart
ment yesterday in a question and
answer period following his
speech on the proposition in Tres
idder Union.
Wosserstfom objected to the
amendment itself, which deals
with defining and imposing sane- J
(ions on communist and subver
sive organizations, on the grounds !
that it is "far too sweeping, casts I
a net over people who might he I
harmless, and makes any govern
mental body or state official from i
local tax assessor to attorney gen
eral judges of who and what are I
subversive.
HE SCORED the proposal that
a local tax assessor should have
such power and termed such offi
cials “unlikely and incompetent”
to perform such a task.
He called the six-page document
“an incredible piece of draftman
ship, sloppily put together, and
unclear.”
For the purpose of explanation,
ho divided the proposed amend
ment into three sections: 1) defi
nition of persons and organiza
tions to be affected by the amend
ment; 2) how persons and orga
nizations will be Judged subver
sive and enumeration of who will
do the judging; and 3) sanctions
to be imposed on those judged sub
versive.
In the first section, Wosser
strom found the definition a sub
versive organization too compli
cated and ambiguous for under
standing. The second section
would penalize those who “may
not have even known the organi
zation they joined was subver
sive.”
FINALLY, the third section im
poses “very harsh” restrictions on
subversives. An y organization
judged to be subversive will not
be allowed to run candidates for
office and will not receive tax
exemptions. Any individual be
i longing to such an organization
will not be able to hold any gov
ernment job and will not be al
lowed to run for office.
For these reasons, Wosserstrom
said, the amendment would sup
press the desire to join, support,
or contribute to any organization
which is controversial.

He called the six-page document
“an incredible piece of draftman
ship, sloppily put together, and
unclear.”
For the purpose of explanation,
ho divided the proposed amend
ment into three sections: 1) defi
nition of persons and organiza
tions to be affected by the amend
ment; 2) how persons and orga
nizations will be Judged subver
sive and enumeration of who will
do the judging; and 3) sanctions
to be imposed on those judged sub
versive.
In the first section, Wosser
strom found the definition a sub
versive organization too compli
cated and ambiguous for under
standing. The second section
would penalize those who “may
not have even known the organi
zation they joined was subver
sive.”
FINALLY, the third section im
poses “very harsh” restrictions on
subversives. An y organization
judged to be subversive will not
be allowed to run candidates for
office and will not receive tax
exemptions. Any individual be
i longing to such an organization
will not be able to hold any gov
ernment job and will not be al
lowed to run for office.
For these reasons, Wosserstrom
said, the amendment would sup
press the desire to join, support,
or contribute to any organization
which is controversial.
If Proposilion 24 is voted into
the state constitution next Tues
day, it will tend to make citizens
afraid to join organizations which
advocate any cause, said Professor
Richard Wosscrstrom of the Law
School and Philosophy Depart
ment yesterday in a question and
answer period following his
speech on the proposition in Tres
idder Union.
Wosserstfom objected to the
amendment itself, which deals
with defining and imposing sane- J
(ions on communist and subver
sive organizations, on the grounds !
that it is "far too sweeping, casts I
a net over people who might he I
harmless, and makes any govern
mental body or state official from i
local tax assessor to attorney gen
eral judges of who and what are I
subversive.
HE SCORED the proposal that
a local tax assessor should have
such power and termed such offi
cials “unlikely and incompetent”
to perform such a task.
