# Class Leaders Fight Abolition
## 
### 
LASSU’s proposal to abolish
class government has met with
strong objections from class offi
cers.
Sophomore class president John
Bryson said that he and his col
leagues had been elected on a
platform of extending class gov
ernment into new and more vital
fields of endeavor.
Bryson said it would be appro
priate to delay the abolition meas
ure until the end of the school
year so that this attempt could be
evaluated. The sophomore class,
he said, has already planned two
hostels for winter quarter and
has slated others for spring quar
ter.

JUNIOR CLASS president Rich
ard Hillman said the university
should delegate more, not less,
responsibility to class govern
ment. At present its only duty is
to provide one class function a
year. Hillman said that each class
plans and executes as many serv
ice projects as it can. Juniors
have been active in promoting the
conversion of Lake Lagunita to
a year-round service and in a
nation-wide study of ways to ease
useless grade-pressure, he said.

Hillman added that other uni
versity organizations form such
an interlocking matrix of preroga
tives that any active class govern
ment ends up “stepping on other
people’s toes.” If the Legislature
would assign class governments
definite and inviolable functions,
Hillman concluded, they could be
come a far more important part
of university life.
