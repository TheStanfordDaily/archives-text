Observe! Those super
comfortable shoes you
see on campus and on
weekends are none
other than R A’s fam
ous Clark Desert
Boots®, perhaps the
most practical foot
wear ever fashioned
for all-around use.
Brushed buck uppers
resist scuffing, never
need shining. High
cut keeps out stones.
Cushioned rubber
soles for stealthy
walking, here or any
where. This, verily, is
a shoe you’ll live in,
1 2.95 per pair.
