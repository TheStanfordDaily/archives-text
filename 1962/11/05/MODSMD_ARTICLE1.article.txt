NEW DELHI American arms aid continued to pour into India
yesterday where lighting in the undeclared border war with Red
China was reported to be almost at a standstill. Both sides shifted
reinforcements and built up their supplies for possible new clashes
before the snows of winter virtually close off the fighting areas
high in the Himalayas.
A defense ministry spokesman announced that Indian troops
battled a Communist Chinese patrol attempting a probing attack in
the northeast near the Burma border and forced it to retreat. The
probing attack came some 15 miles southeast of the disputed McMa
hon border line—the farthest penetration by the Chinese in this
region.
At the other extreme of the 2,000-mile border front, the spokes
man said the invading Chinese fired on an Indian transport plane
near the vital Chusul airstrip in southern Ladakh. He said the plane
returned to its base without damage. American arms aid for India
continued to pour into Calcutta, although a virtual news blackout
covered the airlift in what appeared to be the first step in imposing
a limited press censorship.
RED LEADERS CONFER MOSCOW Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev conferred with leaders of his two most important Euro
pean allies yesterday in apparent major effort to coordinate post-
Cuba Communist policy, particularly on Berlin. Taking part in the
Moscow talks with the Soviet leader were East German party chief
Walter Ulbricht and Polish Communist party leader Wladyslaw
Gomulka. Although there was no official news on the content of the
talks with Khrushchev, speculation here centered on the probability
that the Soviet leader was explaining his Cuban venture and possibly
mapping a new Berlin move or a Communist bloc effort to pump
more economic aid into Cuba.
SOVIETS OUST EMBASSY CLERK MOSCOW The Soviet Union

Jacob, of Egg Harbor. N.J., who has been with the American Embassy

MIKOYAN TALKS WITH CASTRO HAVANA Soviet First
Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, remaining here despite the death
of his wife in Moscow, met for nearly six hours yesterday with
Premier Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials to "settle differ
ences’’ on the removal of Soviet missiles. No statement was issued
after Mikoyan left the palace, and it was not known whether the
talks on proposed international inspection of the missile bases will
continue today. They began Saturday.
