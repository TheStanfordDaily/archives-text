## 
### 
Professor Ralph J. Smith, fac
ulty member of the Electrical
Engineering Department and ac
tive supporter of undergraduate
affairs, will give his “last lecture”
this afternoon at 4:30 in the Tre
sidder Union lounge.
Smith, the third professor in
the “My Last Lecture” series, has
chosen to speak on the effects of
modern technological advances
on society.
As an insight to his views on
the issue, Smith says, “Beware
of teachers who quote from the
dead and leaders who are always
looking backward. There is a
bright future for the student who
dares to ride the tides of prog
ress.’’

Smith will bo speaking from
the vantage point of many years
of experience observing the prog
ress of technology and its impli
cations for human society.
