# Peace Corps Conference Attracts Area People
## 
### SHEILA RICKETTS 
About 500 people from cities
and colleges throughout the Bay
Area filed into Dinkelspiel Audi
torium Saturday to hear an ad,
dress by Warren Wiggins, pro
gram director and number two
man in the Peace Corps; a panel
discussion by representatives of {
India, El Salvador and Africa; }
and a question and answer ses-
I sion with Peace Corps officials in
the lIR-sponsored -conference,
“The Peace Corps in Action.”
“In every country where our
volunteers have been for any
length of time we have been re
quested to send more volun
teers,” said Wiggins, commenting
on the success of the Corps in his
keynote address.
WIGGINS pointed out that the 1
! volunteers are not Americans go-1
j ing abroad to convert the people |
to a religion, to make a profit
from the economic system, to
I strengthen a military alliance, or I
I to change a political system. |
j They are Americans who want to
I give two years to making the I
1 lives of the people better. 1

These volunteers, he said,
speak the language, never enter
a PX or a commissary, and never
have a private auto. They live
under the lavys of the country
with no diplomatic immunity, at
a standard of living comparable
to that of their native co-work
ers. In the Philippines, for ex
ample, this means that the teach
ers live in simple houses and cat
fish, rice and bananas.
Wiggins mentioned a number
of discoveries made after 14
months of Peace Corps opera
tion. The first is the impact of
Peace Corps service on the vol
unteer. This is creating thou
sands of internationally aware
Americans who will start pour
ing back to this country next
summer and who will influence
and change U.S. opinion.
HE ALSO mentioned the im
pact of the volunteers on other
overseas Americans who are in
fluenced by their example, and
the impact on other countries
which are now considering or
launching similar programs.
Wiggins concluded by saying

that the volunteers serve because
of the “personal private virtue
that lies in conscience.” He tied
this individual motive to the
democratic system based on the
importance of the individual,
Fidel Gonzales, assistant min
ister of labor in Eh Salvador,
stressed his country’s need for
educational facilities, in the panel
discussion following Wiggin’s
speech. He feels that the 24 Peace
Corps volunteers now teaching in
fil Salvador arc making a real
contribution in this area.
I*. N. MENON, Consul General
of India, pointed out that India
is probably the largest underde
veloped country in the world. But
India hopes to attain a “self-sus
taining economy” in about ten
years, lie said.
India, according to Mcnon, lias
a 4000-year history and a deep
faith in its culture.
“That is why we are willing to
stand up and fight for them
against the strongest power for
evil in the world today,” ho said.
MENON ALSO mentioned In
dia’s poulation problem as some
thing that cannot be changed

overnight.
“If we had developed totali
tarian methods, we might have
been able to do something,” he
said.
Dr, Peter Duignan, curator of
the African collection in the Hoo
ver Institute, represented the Af
rican nations. He stressed the
problem of allocating resources.
THERE IS A great need for
elementary and secondary school
training, according to Duignan,
but education must compete with
the demands of other groups
such as health, agriculture, and
port and transportation construc
tion for the scarce resources and
trained manpower.
“Hopefully the presence of the
Peace Corps will relieve some of
the pressure on this problem,”
he concluded.
Wiggins, Dr. Richard Smith,
head Peace Corps physician in
Nigeria, and Dr. Donald Castle
barry, in charge of training
Peace Corps volunteers for the
Philippines at San Francisco
State College answered questions
from the floor in a two-hour ses
sion after lunch.

elementary and secondary school
training, according to Duignan,
but education must compete with
the demands of other groups
such as health, agriculture, and
port and transportation construc
tion for the scarce resources and
trained manpower.
“Hopefully the presence of the
Peace Corps will relieve some of
the pressure on this problem,”
he concluded.
Wiggins, Dr. Richard Smith,
head Peace Corps physician in
Nigeria, and Dr. Donald Castle
barry, in charge of training
Peace Corps volunteers for the
Philippines at San Francisco
State College answered questions
from the floor in a two-hour ses
sion after lunch.
About 500 people from cities
and colleges throughout the Bay
Area filed into Dinkelspiel Audi
torium Saturday to hear an ad,
dress by Warren Wiggins, pro
gram director and number two
man in the Peace Corps; a panel
discussion by representatives of {
India, El Salvador and Africa; }
and a question and answer ses-
I sion with Peace Corps officials in
the lIR-sponsored -conference,
“The Peace Corps in Action.”
“In every country where our
volunteers have been for any
length of time we have been re
quested to send more volun
teers,” said Wiggins, commenting
on the success of the Corps in his
keynote address.
WIGGINS pointed out that the 1
! volunteers are not Americans go-1
j ing abroad to convert the people |
to a religion, to make a profit
from the economic system, to
I strengthen a military alliance, or I
I to change a political system. |
j They are Americans who want to
I give two years to making the I
1 lives of the people better. 1

These volunteers, he said,
speak the language, never enter
a PX or a commissary, and never
have a private auto. They live
under the lavys of the country
with no diplomatic immunity, at
a standard of living comparable
to that of their native co-work
ers. In the Philippines, for ex
ample, this means that the teach
ers live in simple houses and cat
fish, rice and bananas.
Wiggins mentioned a number
of discoveries made after 14
months of Peace Corps opera
tion. The first is the impact of
Peace Corps service on the vol
unteer. This is creating thou
sands of internationally aware
Americans who will start pour
ing back to this country next
summer and who will influence
and change U.S. opinion.
HE ALSO mentioned the im
pact of the volunteers on other
overseas Americans who are in
fluenced by their example, and
the impact on other countries
which are now considering or
launching similar programs.
Wiggins concluded by saying

that the volunteers serve because
of the “personal private virtue
that lies in conscience.” He tied
this individual motive to the
democratic system based on the
importance of the individual,
Fidel Gonzales, assistant min
ister of labor in Eh Salvador,
stressed his country’s need for
educational facilities, in the panel
discussion following Wiggin’s
speech. He feels that the 24 Peace
Corps volunteers now teaching in
fil Salvador arc making a real
contribution in this area.
I*. N. MENON, Consul General
of India, pointed out that India
is probably the largest underde
veloped country in the world. But
India hopes to attain a “self-sus
taining economy” in about ten
years, lie said.
India, according to Mcnon, lias
a 4000-year history and a deep
faith in its culture.
“That is why we are willing to
stand up and fight for them
against the strongest power for
evil in the world today,” ho said.
MENON ALSO mentioned In
dia’s poulation problem as some
thing that cannot be changed

overnight.
“If we had developed totali
tarian methods, we might have
been able to do something,” he
said.

“That is why we are willing to
stand up and fight for them
against the strongest power for
evil in the world today,” ho said.
MENON ALSO mentioned In
dia’s poulation problem as some
thing that cannot be changed

overnight.
“If we had developed totali
tarian methods, we might have
been able to do something,” he
said.
Dr, Peter Duignan, curator of
the African collection in the Hoo
ver Institute, represented the Af
rican nations. He stressed the
problem of allocating resources.
THERE IS A great need for
elementary and secondary school
training, according to Duignan,
but education must compete with
the demands of other groups
such as health, agriculture, and
port and transportation construc
tion for the scarce resources and
trained manpower.
“Hopefully the presence of the
Peace Corps will relieve some of
the pressure on this problem,”
he concluded.

About 500 people from cities
and colleges throughout the Bay
Area filed into Dinkelspiel Audi
torium Saturday to hear an ad,
dress by Warren Wiggins, pro
gram director and number two
man in the Peace Corps; a panel
discussion by representatives of {
India, El Salvador and Africa; }
and a question and answer ses-
I sion with Peace Corps officials in
the lIR-sponsored -conference,
“The Peace Corps in Action.”
“In every country where our
volunteers have been for any
length of time we have been re
quested to send more volun
teers,” said Wiggins, commenting
on the success of the Corps in his
keynote address.
WIGGINS pointed out that the 1
! volunteers are not Americans go-1
j ing abroad to convert the people |
to a religion, to make a profit
from the economic system, to
I strengthen a military alliance, or I
I to change a political system. |
j They are Americans who want to
I give two years to making the I
1 lives of the people better. 1

These volunteers, he said,
speak the language, never enter
a PX or a commissary, and never
have a private auto. They live
under the lavys of the country
with no diplomatic immunity, at
a standard of living comparable
to that of their native co-work
ers. In the Philippines, for ex
ample, this means that the teach
ers live in simple houses and cat
fish, rice and bananas.
Wiggins mentioned a number
of discoveries made after 14
months of Peace Corps opera
tion. The first is the impact of
Peace Corps service on the vol
unteer. This is creating thou
sands of internationally aware
Americans who will start pour
ing back to this country next
summer and who will influence
and change U.S. opinion.
HE ALSO mentioned the im
pact of the volunteers on other
overseas Americans who are in
fluenced by their example, and
the impact on other countries
which are now considering or
launching similar programs.
Wiggins concluded by saying

that the volunteers serve because
of the “personal private virtue
that lies in conscience.” He tied
this individual motive to the
democratic system based on the
importance of the individual,
Fidel Gonzales, assistant min
ister of labor in Eh Salvador,
stressed his country’s need for
educational facilities, in the panel
discussion following Wiggin’s
speech. He feels that the 24 Peace
Corps volunteers now teaching in
fil Salvador arc making a real
contribution in this area.
I*. N. MENON, Consul General
of India, pointed out that India
is probably the largest underde
veloped country in the world. But
India hopes to attain a “self-sus
taining economy” in about ten
years, lie said.
India, according to Mcnon, lias
a 4000-year history and a deep
faith in its culture.
“That is why we are willing to
stand up and fight for them
against the strongest power for
evil in the world today,” ho said.
