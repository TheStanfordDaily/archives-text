# James Thurber For Congressman
## 
### 
Los Altos Mayor James P. Thurber, Stanford ’5l, is attempting
to unseat Republican Congressman Charles S. Gubser in tomor
row’s election. We hope Mr. Thurber is successful. If he is suc
cessful, the people from Santa Clara County south to San Jose
will send to Washington a man who vigorously supports President
Kennedy’s program to strengthen the ties of the United States
with the world community.
In contrast, Mr. Gubser voted against the United Nations
bond bill, which the House of Representatives passed, 257-134.
Ry voting against this measure last September 14, Congressman
Gubser is on record opposing the authorization of $lOO million
with which the U.S. w ill purchase UN bonds in order to keep the
UN solvent and strong. The U.S. is committed to buying up to
$lOO million in bonds on a dollar-for-dollar matching basis with
all other member nations. Congressman Gubser’s vote, while it
does not indicate total disapproval of the UN, does indicate that
he wants to restrict its activities and powers. Mr. Thurber is on
record in favor of the UN bond proposal because “all other pro
grams we may initiate would be futile if the United Nations is
allowed to fail.”
Mayor Thurber’s election will give support to President Ken
nedy’s program to integrate this country’s economy with that of
the Common Market. The re-election of Mr. Gubser, on the other
hand, would return to Congress a man who favors less economic
integration and at a slower pace. Last June 28, Mr. Gubser voted
to recommit the Trade Expansion Act to committee with instruc
tions to substitute in its place a one-year extension of the expiring
'I rade Agreements Act. When the motion to recommit failed by
171-253, Mr. Gubser then, and only then, gave a reluctant affirma
tive vote for the President’s Trade Expansion Act.
As the campaign has progressed, the rival camps of Mr. Gub
ser and Mr. Thurber have been more and more at each other’s
throat. Mr. Gubser has been called a Neanderthal Republican,
and Mr. Thurber has been called “uncontained mercury ’ by Mr.
Gubser, himself. Each charge (if the.latter remark may be labelled
a “charge”) seems inaccurate. Mr. Gubser is not a Neanderthal,
but he is a conservative—a signal conservative.
Mr. Thurber, on the other hand, is not “uncontained mercury,”
but he is a man of conviction and energy. (Mr. Gubser particu
larly objects to Mr. Thurber’s energy in “misrepresenting” the
Congressmans record: “Thurber’s confused—on purpose, 1 think.”)
On one point there is no confusion. The election of Mr. Thur
ber to Congress will give this district and the nation a representa
tive of stature—a man whose instinct leads him into the world
community, not with reluctance but with confidence.
