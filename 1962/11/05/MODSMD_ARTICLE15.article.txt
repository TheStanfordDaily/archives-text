# DRAMA REVIEW
## "Macbeth' Struggling, Different, Soporific" 
### JOSEPH L. JACOBS 
Theodore Hoffman, director of
the Stanford Players’ production
of “Macbeth,” said last week that
“the trouble with Shakespeare
productions is that everybody
loves them, loves to do them,
loves to see them . . . but we
also seem to love to do them all
alike.” He also said that “at best,
our 'Macbeth’ will be struggling
to be different.”
He was only partly correct. The
production was different and was
struggling, but everybody did not
love it. In fact, most of the audi
ence (including myself) found
very little to like—let alone love
—in Hoffman's long (well over
three hours) and soporific “Mac
beth.”
THE MAIN fault with the pro
duction was its pace—or, rather,
its lack of pace. Hoffman cut
very little from the full-length
script, and the production moved
at an agonizingly slow pace. The
seemingly ..interminable waits
while the sets and props were
shifted in darkness did not help.
The blocking, i.e., movement
and placement of the actors, was
also poor. Hoffman seemed to
feel that the Shortest distance be
tween two points was an arc. and
the amount of senseless crossing
and re-crossing of the stage was
amazing. This was especially true
in the final battle scenes, where
the actors established what must
be a record for the greatest
amount of useless and senseless
wandering ever achieved in one
act.

Holmes Easley’s sets were an
other of the many liabilities. All
in red, black, and white, they
were visually both impressive
and handsome. But, as I men
tioned, they took too long to shift
and were frequently meaningless
and unnecessary. Even if their
presence could be justified, there
was no excuse for placing unne
cessary props in such a position
they blocked the view of part of

the audience, as was done in the
opening scene of the second part.
Georgia Ryther’s costumes, al
though colorful, all too often
looked about five sizes too big
for the actors. Cary Clasz’s light
ing was quite effective.
STEVEN GILBORN chose to
underplay the title role. This in
terpretation was very effective
in most scenes, but although he
mercifully was not over-emotion
al, he sometimes showed almost
no emotion at all. His famous
“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and
tomorrow” speech, perhaps the
greatest in the play, was disap
pointingly flat, as was his “Is this
a dagger which I see before me?”
speech. But, on the whole, his
performance was quite good.
Ellen Headly, as Lady Macbeth,
was rather uneven; although gen
erally very good, she was fre
quently difficult to hear. She was
more feminine than the usual
Lady Macbeth, and this hurt her
in her early scenes. But her sleep
walking scene, although miser
ably blocked, was brilliant, and,
had the audience not been so
tired, she would have received a
well-deserved round of applause.

Mark Hammer, as Macduff,
was excellent, and the scene in
which he learned of his wife’s
death was one of the most effec
tive in the play. Lawrence Straw
bridge’s Banquo was also excel
lent. The banquet scene, in which
he returned as a ghost, was bril
liantly staged and acted, and was
easily the best scene of the pro
duction.

SUSAN LEIGH, Jane Loeb.
and Wendy Wood were very good
as were William Louis as the por
ter and Antony Lorraine as Dun
can. Alan Siegel’s Malcolm was
took weak, especially in the scene
in England and the final scene.
The pace of the production will
probably (and hopefully) pick up
at the performances this Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday. The
production is playing in Memori
al Auditorium.

feel that the Shortest distance be

the amount of senseless crossing

amazing. This was especially true
in the final battle scenes, where
the actors established what must
be a record for the greatest
amount of useless and senseless
wandering ever achieved in one
act.

Holmes Easley’s sets were an
other of the many liabilities. All
in red, black, and white, they
were visually both impressive
and handsome. But, as I men
tioned, they took too long to shift
and were frequently meaningless
and unnecessary. Even if their
presence could be justified, there
was no excuse for placing unne
cessary props in such a position
they blocked the view of part of

the audience, as was done in the
opening scene of the second part.
Georgia Ryther’s costumes, al
though colorful, all too often
looked about five sizes too big
for the actors. Cary Clasz’s light
ing was quite effective.
STEVEN GILBORN chose to
underplay the title role. This in
terpretation was very effective
in most scenes, but although he
mercifully was not over-emotion
al, he sometimes showed almost
no emotion at all. His famous
“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and
tomorrow” speech, perhaps the
greatest in the play, was disap
pointingly flat, as was his “Is this
a dagger which I see before me?”
speech. But, on the whole, his
performance was quite good.
Ellen Headly, as Lady Macbeth,
was rather uneven; although gen
erally very good, she was fre
quently difficult to hear. She was
more feminine than the usual
Lady Macbeth, and this hurt her
in her early scenes. But her sleep
walking scene, although miser
ably blocked, was brilliant, and,
had the audience not been so
tired, she would have received a
well-deserved round of applause.

Mark Hammer, as Macduff,
was excellent, and the scene in
which he learned of his wife’s
death was one of the most effec
tive in the play. Lawrence Straw
bridge’s Banquo was also excel
lent. The banquet scene, in which
he returned as a ghost, was bril
liantly staged and acted, and was
easily the best scene of the pro
duction.

Theodore Hoffman, director of
the Stanford Players’ production
of “Macbeth,” said last week that
“the trouble with Shakespeare
productions is that everybody
loves them, loves to do them,
loves to see them . . . but we
also seem to love to do them all
alike.” He also said that “at best,
our 'Macbeth’ will be struggling
to be different.”
He was only partly correct. The
production was different and was
struggling, but everybody did not
love it. In fact, most of the audi
ence (including myself) found
very little to like—let alone love
—in Hoffman's long (well over
three hours) and soporific “Mac
beth.”
THE MAIN fault with the pro
duction was its pace—or, rather,
its lack of pace. Hoffman cut
very little from the full-length
script, and the production moved
at an agonizingly slow pace. The
seemingly ..interminable waits
while the sets and props were
shifted in darkness did not help.
The blocking, i.e., movement
and placement of the actors, was
also poor. Hoffman seemed to
feel that the Shortest distance be
tween two points was an arc. and

and re-crossing of the stage was

in most scenes, but although he
mercifully was not over-emotion
al, he sometimes showed almost
no emotion at all. His famous
“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and
tomorrow” speech, perhaps the
greatest in the play, was disap
pointingly flat, as was his “Is this
a dagger which I see before me?”
speech. But, on the whole, his
performance was quite good.
Ellen Headly, as Lady Macbeth,
was rather uneven; although gen
erally very good, she was fre
quently difficult to hear. She was
more feminine than the usual
Lady Macbeth, and this hurt her
in her early scenes. But her sleep
walking scene, although miser
ably blocked, was brilliant, and,
had the audience not been so
tired, she would have received a
well-deserved round of applause.

Mark Hammer, as Macduff,
was excellent, and the scene in
which he learned of his wife’s
death was one of the most effec
tive in the play. Lawrence Straw
bridge’s Banquo was also excel
lent. The banquet scene, in which
he returned as a ghost, was bril
liantly staged and acted, and was
easily the best scene of the pro
duction.

SUSAN LEIGH, Jane Loeb.
and Wendy Wood were very good
as were William Louis as the por
ter and Antony Lorraine as Dun
can. Alan Siegel’s Malcolm was
took weak, especially in the scene
in England and the final scene.
The pace of the production will
probably (and hopefully) pick up
at the performances this Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday. The
production is playing in Memori
al Auditorium.
