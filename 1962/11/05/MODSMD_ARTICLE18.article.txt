## Russia Forced to Acknowledge Chinese Dominance in Asia 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
It is no doubt a coincidence that the Chinese invasion of India
became critical just as the Cuban affair was coming to a head. But
while the two crises on opposite sides of the world are not connected,
they are in highly important ways related. In Cuba the Soviet Union
has had to abandon an effort to extend its power in the Americas;

in the Sino-Indian conflict it is<
confronted with a distinct and
dramatic loss of influence and
power in the heart of Asia.
Quite rightly, our attention has
been fixed upon the confrontation
over Cuba, which has been the
more immediate danger since it
was a confrontation of the two
nuclear powers. What is going on
in India does not involve immedi
ately the risk of a sudden world
wide catastrophe. But by any
standard except that of the nu
clear age, the events in Asia are
momentous.
The Chinese have compelled
the Russians to acknowledge that
Peking, and not Moscow any
longer, is dominant inside of
Asia. Until very recently the in
fluence of the Soviet Union in
Delhi rested primarily on the be
lief, which the Soviet Union cul
tivated, that Russia would be the
protector of India against aggres
sion from China.

Because of this
belief the Indian
government has
felt it unneces
sary to make
any defensive
military agree
ment with the
West. It, has
heeded the ad
vice from Mos
cow that it

should not take the matter of the
Chinese incursions, which have
been going on for five years, to
the United Nations. Moreover,
the Indian government has saved
on armaments in order not to in
terfere with its economic devel
opment.
The whole structure of Indian
policy and of Soviet influence
has been shattered in the past
fortnight. According to a “high
Soviet military source,” the Sovi
et Union has cancelled its agree
ment to sell a dozen MiG-21 jet
fighters to India. Pravda and Iz
vestia have for the first time
ceased to lie neutral in the Sino-
Indian frontier dispute, and have
supported the Chinese case
against the so-called McMahon
Line. But most important of all,
the Soviet Union has been un
able to contain the Chinese ag
gression, which is now reaching
the point where Chinese armies
may soon have opened the way
to invasion of the Indian plain.
THE INDIAN policy of non
alignment, which depended on
Soviet support against China, has
broken down, and the proof is
that Prime Minister Nehru has
openly appealed to the United
States for military aid. This ap
peal was made specific on last
Monday, and has already been
acted upon favorably.
We are concerned also because
we are the ally of Pakistan, and
the attitude of Pakistan towards
the defense of India is of para
mount importance. The best part
of the Indian army, which ought
to be facing the Chinese, is in
fact facing Pakistan because of
the hitherto insoluble , conflict
over Kashmir. There is no time
to solve the Kashmir problem be
fore the defense of India is se
cured, and it is highly important
therefore that some kind of mili
tary standstill on Kashmir be ar
ranged in order to release the In
dian army for the Chinese war.
THE BRITISH and the Ameri
can governments are both work
ing on this, and we must hope
that the Pakistanis will cease to
rejoice in the troubles of India,
and will realize that if they let
India fall they will have betrayed
their own vital interests.

We are, of course, deeply con
cerned also with the global im
plications of the change in the

Soviet position in Asia. This Chi
nese aggression is not only a
peril to India. It is a peril not
only to the political influence of
Moscow, but also to the vital in
terests of Russia from the Urals
to the Pacific.
We must be very discreet. But
there is some ground for think
ing that we may be nearer than
we thought possible or likely a
fortnight ago to the day, which
Gen. de Gaulle has long been an
ticipating, when Russia will rec
ognize that she is primarily a
European power, and that her
security and the protection of her
vital interests must be sought in
the West.

It is no doubt a coincidence that the Chinese invasion of India
became critical just as the Cuban affair was coming to a head. But
while the two crises on opposite sides of the world are not connected,
they are in highly important ways related. In Cuba the Soviet Union
has had to abandon an effort to extend its power in the Americas;

in the Sino-Indian conflict it is<
confronted with a distinct and
dramatic loss of influence and
power in the heart of Asia.
Quite rightly, our attention has
been fixed upon the confrontation
over Cuba, which has been the
more immediate danger since it
was a confrontation of the two
nuclear powers. What is going on
in India does not involve immedi
ately the risk of a sudden world
wide catastrophe. But by any
standard except that of the nu
clear age, the events in Asia are
momentous.
The Chinese have compelled
the Russians to acknowledge that
Peking, and not Moscow any
longer, is dominant inside of
Asia. Until very recently the in
fluence of the Soviet Union in
Delhi rested primarily on the be
lief, which the Soviet Union cul
tivated, that Russia would be the
protector of India against aggres
sion from China.

Because of this
belief the Indian
government has
felt it unneces
sary to make
any defensive
military agree
ment with the
West. It, has
heeded the ad
vice from Mos
cow that it

should not take the matter of the
Chinese incursions, which have
been going on for five years, to
the United Nations. Moreover,
the Indian government has saved
on armaments in order not to in
terfere with its economic devel
opment.
The whole structure of Indian
policy and of Soviet influence
has been shattered in the past
fortnight. According to a “high
Soviet military source,” the Sovi
et Union has cancelled its agree
ment to sell a dozen MiG-21 jet
fighters to India. Pravda and Iz
vestia have for the first time
ceased to lie neutral in the Sino-
Indian frontier dispute, and have
supported the Chinese case
against the so-called McMahon
Line. But most important of all,
the Soviet Union has been un
able to contain the Chinese ag
gression, which is now reaching
the point where Chinese armies
may soon have opened the way
to invasion of the Indian plain.

Quite rightly, our attention has
been fixed upon the confrontation
over Cuba, which has been the
more immediate danger since it
was a confrontation of the two
nuclear powers. What is going on
in India does not involve immedi
ately the risk of a sudden world
wide catastrophe. But by any
standard except that of the nu
clear age, the events in Asia are
momentous.
The Chinese have compelled
the Russians to acknowledge that
Peking, and not Moscow any
longer, is dominant inside of
Asia. Until very recently the in
fluence of the Soviet Union in
Delhi rested primarily on the be
lief, which the Soviet Union cul
tivated, that Russia would be the
protector of India against aggres
sion from China.

Because of this
belief the Indian
government has
felt it unneces
sary to make
any defensive
military agree
ment with the
West. It, has
heeded the ad
vice from Mos
cow that it

should not take the matter of the
Chinese incursions, which have
been going on for five years, to
the United Nations. Moreover,
the Indian government has saved
on armaments in order not to in
terfere with its economic devel
opment.
The whole structure of Indian
policy and of Soviet influence
has been shattered in the past
fortnight. According to a “high
Soviet military source,” the Sovi
et Union has cancelled its agree
ment to sell a dozen MiG-21 jet
fighters to India. Pravda and Iz
vestia have for the first time
ceased to lie neutral in the Sino-
Indian frontier dispute, and have
supported the Chinese case
against the so-called McMahon
Line. But most important of all,
the Soviet Union has been un
able to contain the Chinese ag
gression, which is now reaching
the point where Chinese armies
may soon have opened the way
to invasion of the Indian plain.
THE INDIAN policy of non
alignment, which depended on
Soviet support against China, has
broken down, and the proof is
that Prime Minister Nehru has
openly appealed to the United
States for military aid. This ap
peal was made specific on last
Monday, and has already been
acted upon favorably.
We are concerned also because
we are the ally of Pakistan, and
the attitude of Pakistan towards
the defense of India is of para
mount importance. The best part
of the Indian army, which ought
to be facing the Chinese, is in
fact facing Pakistan because of
the hitherto insoluble , conflict
over Kashmir. There is no time
to solve the Kashmir problem be
fore the defense of India is se
cured, and it is highly important
therefore that some kind of mili
tary standstill on Kashmir be ar
ranged in order to release the In
dian army for the Chinese war.
THE BRITISH and the Ameri
can governments are both work
ing on this, and we must hope
that the Pakistanis will cease to
rejoice in the troubles of India,
and will realize that if they let
India fall they will have betrayed
their own vital interests.

We are, of course, deeply con
cerned also with the global im
plications of the change in the

Soviet position in Asia. This Chi
nese aggression is not only a
peril to India. It is a peril not
only to the political influence of
Moscow, but also to the vital in
terests of Russia from the Urals
to the Pacific.
We must be very discreet. But
there is some ground for think
ing that we may be nearer than
we thought possible or likely a
fortnight ago to the day, which
Gen. de Gaulle has long been an
ticipating, when Russia will rec
ognize that she is primarily a
European power, and that her
security and the protection of her
vital interests must be sought in
the West.

It is no doubt a coincidence that the Chinese invasion of India
became critical just as the Cuban affair was coming to a head. But
while the two crises on opposite sides of the world are not connected,
they are in highly important ways related. In Cuba the Soviet Union
has had to abandon an effort to extend its power in the Americas;

in the Sino-Indian conflict it is<
confronted with a distinct and
dramatic loss of influence and
power in the heart of Asia.
Quite rightly, our attention has
been fixed upon the confrontation
