## 
### 
(Editor’s note: Reprinted be
low are the texts of two resolu
tions on Propositions 12 and 24
adopted by , Legislature last
Thursday evening.)
PROPOSITION 12;
Be it resolved that the Legisla-j
ture of Stanford University ex- j
presses its strong support for
California Proposition 13 which
provides property tax exemption |
on all land used exclusively for i
educational purposes by private
colleges and universities.
PROPOSITION 24:
WHEREAS:It is generally recog
nized that the fundamental ba
sis of academic freedom is the
opportunity to search and ques
tion freely, without fear of any
reprisal. Today, more than ever
before, freedom to inquire, par
ticularly freedom to study po
litical, social, philosophical, and
economic relationships and
problems upon which national
policies must ultimately be
based, requires freedom of
thought, of inquiry, and of ex
pression, particularly within
the walls of the classroom. The
critical nature of our times,
therefore, calls for more, not
less, freedom to inquire and to ;
express conclusions reached:
and
WHEREAS: Proposition 24, de
nies State University employ
ment and a University degree
qualifying one to teach in the
public schools to persons be
cause of their present or past
associations, or because of re
fusal to testify before govern
mental committees regarding
one’s associations: and
WHEREAS: Proposition 24 in
flicts these penalties without
regard for due process of law.
The due process requirement
that a regulation be clearly
drafted is violated by the vague
definitions of “communist ac
tion, communist front, and sub
versive organizations.” Due
process is further denied in
that power to make findings
under the proposed amendment
is granted to a proliferation of
individuals and organizations
which do not observe the due
process procedures of hearings,
confrontation of one’s accuser’s,
the presentation of witnesses
on one’ own behalf, and repre
sentation by counsel.
Therefore, be it resolved that;
The Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
express its opposition to the so
called Francis Amendment, Prop
osition 24, and strongly urge its |
rejection by the voters of the!
State of California.
