# Craig Calls Berlin Red Trouble Spot

“Berlin has been a source of
trouble since the war for the So
viets as well as for the United
States,” said Dr. Gordon Craig.
Professor of History, in his talk
on “Berlin: Past, Present, and Fu
ture” last night in the Otero
lounge. “Being placed inside East
Germany, West Berlin is like a
hundred-watt bulb in a shabby
room.”
Khrushchev had three main
purposes in allowing Ulbricht to
build the Wall, said Craig:
first, to lower the morale of West
Berlin; second, to prop up the Ul
bricht regime; and third, to les
sen U.S. support in West Berlin.
On the contrary, just the opposite
occurred, and the Wall itself is an
obvious propaganda liability to
the Soviets.
“The fact that the Wall did not
pay off for Ulbricht and Khrush
chev as planned makes the situ
ation even more dangerous,” said
Craig. Moreover, public opinion

in West Berlin runs strongly
against the Wall.
As Craig said, “There is great
difficulty in finding a viable so
lution for Berlin. One possible
answer might bo a modus vivendi
which gives the East German
government a form of recogni
tion, but which also gives the
West assurance of access to Ber
lin and which would lead to nego
tiations about the Wall, and pos
sibly to negotiations toward
German re unification,”
