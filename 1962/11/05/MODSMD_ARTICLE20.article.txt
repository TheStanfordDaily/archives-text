# STANFORD NEARS WEST COAST CHAMPIONSHIP
## Chukwudebe's Overtime Goal Settles Frustrating but Satisfying Soccer Win 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford broke the Jim Lynch
jinx and all but clinched a berth

in the NCAA soccer playoffs Sat
urday with a 2-1 squeaker over
USF. The game was played at
Stanford before a wildly enthusi
astic crowd that included Harry
Maloney, Stanford soccer, fencing
and boxing coach for many years,
and the man for whom the Card
soccer field is named,
Larry Chukwudebe knocked in
Stanford’s winning goal with less
than two minutes remaining in a
ten-minute overtime period. He
took advantage of a tangie in

front of I ho USF goal and knood
the ball into the net.
I.YXCH, WHO has made a hah
it of single-handedly defeating
Stanford, did his best to become
a spoiler again. He netted the
lone USF goal on a 45-foot blast,
and came very close to winning
the game for the Dons with a
break away, bullet shot that Card
Goalie Kent Mueller brilliantly
deflected out of bounds.
The lone obstacle between Stan
ford and a trip to the mid-West
to represent the West Coast in
the soccer playoffs is San Jose
State, a team that Stanford earli
er defeated easily 4-3 in a prac
tice gome. If the Cards win, they
are an automatic selection. How
ever if Stanford loses and Cali
fornia wins next week, a playoff
between the two teams will be
necessary to determine the West

Coast champion.
The contest had a confused be
ginning, with the USF varsity
failing to appear by the 2 p.m.
gametime. The referees finally
gave USF an extra 30 minutes to
show. The game began at 2:30
with USF using- their junior var
sity to avoid the forfeit.
IN THE FIRST quarter. Stan
ford scored against a makeshift
aggregation due to USF's late
arrival. Klas Bergman was
awarded an indirect free kick on
a foul called near the USF net.
Bergman shot the hall to Stu
Rawlings, who headed the ball
into the goal for a 1-0 Stanford
lead.
The Dons toughened after their
varsity arrived in the middle of
the first quarter, and tied the
score on Lynch’s shot halfway
through the second period.
Stanford dominated play in the
second half, but was unable to
push in the go-ahead score until
the overtime. Bergman, Chuk
wudebe and A1 Nnoli continually
got I tie ball deep into USF terri
tory, but couldn’t hold the advan
tage.
IT WAS fitting that Chukwude
be get the winning score, as he
marely missed clinching the con
test with only 15 seconds remain
ing in regulatoin play. He stode
the ball, dribbled past a defense
man and shot (he ball toward the
far corner; it hit the post and
agonizingly caromed away.
The first eight minutes of the
overtime were uneventful, but
the remainder had Stanford play
ers and spectators screaming.
The Cards got the ball at mid
field on fullback Sandy Pofahl’s
long boot. The Tribe moved into
position and bombarded the goal
with shots before Chukwudebe
scored.
The contest could best be
termed loosely played, as the
Cards often forgot teamwork in
the heat of battle and failed to
take advantage of passing oppor
tunities. However, nothing can be
taken away from the magnificent
play of center-halfback Bill
Teusch. who hounded Lynch
from start to finish and did well
to hold him to two breakaways
and one goal. He and goalie Muel
ler, fullbacks Pofahl and Rich
Lonergan, and halfbacks Don
Burr and Jim Armstrong were
the core of a rugged defense that
made the Dons fight for every
yard.

In all other weekend sports,
Stanford was victorious. The
water polo team won three
sanies with a great show of
offense; the frosh football
team beat Cal, 30; and the
cross country team won a
quadrangular meet at Cal.

Stanford broke the Jim Lynch
jinx and all but clinched a berth

in the NCAA soccer playoffs Sat
urday with a 2-1 squeaker over
USF. The game was played at
Stanford before a wildly enthusi
astic crowd that included Harry
Maloney, Stanford soccer, fencing
and boxing coach for many years,
and the man for whom the Card
soccer field is named,
Larry Chukwudebe knocked in
Stanford’s winning goal with less
than two minutes remaining in a
ten-minute overtime period. He
took advantage of a tangie in

front of I ho USF goal and knood
the ball into the net.
I.YXCH, WHO has made a hah
it of single-handedly defeating
Stanford, did his best to become
a spoiler again. He netted the
lone USF goal on a 45-foot blast,
and came very close to winning
the game for the Dons with a
break away, bullet shot that Card
Goalie Kent Mueller brilliantly
deflected out of bounds.
The lone obstacle between Stan
ford and a trip to the mid-West
to represent the West Coast in
the soccer playoffs is San Jose
State, a team that Stanford earli
er defeated easily 4-3 in a prac
tice gome. If the Cards win, they
are an automatic selection. How
ever if Stanford loses and Cali
fornia wins next week, a playoff
between the two teams will be
necessary to determine the West

Coast champion.
The contest had a confused be
ginning, with the USF varsity
failing to appear by the 2 p.m.
gametime. The referees finally
gave USF an extra 30 minutes to
show. The game began at 2:30
with USF using- their junior var
sity to avoid the forfeit.
IN THE FIRST quarter. Stan
ford scored against a makeshift
aggregation due to USF's late
arrival. Klas Bergman was
awarded an indirect free kick on
a foul called near the USF net.
Bergman shot the hall to Stu
Rawlings, who headed the ball
into the goal for a 1-0 Stanford
lead.
The Dons toughened after their
varsity arrived in the middle of
the first quarter, and tied the
score on Lynch’s shot halfway
through the second period.
Stanford dominated play in the
second half, but was unable to
push in the go-ahead score until
the overtime. Bergman, Chuk
wudebe and A1 Nnoli continually
got I tie ball deep into USF terri
tory, but couldn’t hold the advan
tage.
IT WAS fitting that Chukwude
be get the winning score, as he
marely missed clinching the con
test with only 15 seconds remain
ing in regulatoin play. He stode
the ball, dribbled past a defense
man and shot (he ball toward the
far corner; it hit the post and
agonizingly caromed away.
The first eight minutes of the
overtime were uneventful, but
the remainder had Stanford play
ers and spectators screaming.
The Cards got the ball at mid
field on fullback Sandy Pofahl’s
long boot. The Tribe moved into
position and bombarded the goal
with shots before Chukwudebe
scored.
The contest could best be
termed loosely played, as the
Cards often forgot teamwork in
the heat of battle and failed to
take advantage of passing oppor
tunities. However, nothing can be
taken away from the magnificent
play of center-halfback Bill
Teusch. who hounded Lynch
from start to finish and did well
to hold him to two breakaways
and one goal. He and goalie Muel
ler, fullbacks Pofahl and Rich
Lonergan, and halfbacks Don
Burr and Jim Armstrong were
the core of a rugged defense that

the heat of battle and failed to
take advantage of passing oppor
tunities. However, nothing can be
taken away from the magnificent
play of center-halfback Bill
Teusch. who hounded Lynch
from start to finish and did well
to hold him to two breakaways
and one goal. He and goalie Muel
ler, fullbacks Pofahl and Rich
Lonergan, and halfbacks Don
Burr and Jim Armstrong were
the core of a rugged defense that
made the Dons fight for every
yard.

In all other weekend sports,
Stanford was victorious. The
water polo team won three
sanies with a great show of
offense; the frosh football
team beat Cal, 30; and the
cross country team won a
quadrangular meet at Cal.

Stanford broke the Jim Lynch
jinx and all but clinched a berth

in the NCAA soccer playoffs Sat
urday with a 2-1 squeaker over
USF. The game was played at
Stanford before a wildly enthusi
astic crowd that included Harry
Maloney, Stanford soccer, fencing
and boxing coach for many years,
and the man for whom the Card
soccer field is named,
Larry Chukwudebe knocked in
Stanford’s winning goal with less
than two minutes remaining in a
ten-minute overtime period. He
took advantage of a tangie in

front of I ho USF goal and knood
the ball into the net.
I.YXCH, WHO has made a hah
it of single-handedly defeating
Stanford, did his best to become
a spoiler again. He netted the
lone USF goal on a 45-foot blast,
and came very close to winning
the game for the Dons with a
break away, bullet shot that Card
Goalie Kent Mueller brilliantly
deflected out of bounds.
The lone obstacle between Stan
ford and a trip to the mid-West
to represent the West Coast in
the soccer playoffs is San Jose
State, a team that Stanford earli
er defeated easily 4-3 in a prac
tice gome. If the Cards win, they
are an automatic selection. How
ever if Stanford loses and Cali
fornia wins next week, a playoff
between the two teams will be
necessary to determine the West

Coast champion.
The contest had a confused be
ginning, with the USF varsity
failing to appear by the 2 p.m.
gametime. The referees finally
gave USF an extra 30 minutes to
show. The game began at 2:30
with USF using- their junior var
sity to avoid the forfeit.
IN THE FIRST quarter. Stan
ford scored against a makeshift
aggregation due to USF's late
arrival. Klas Bergman was
awarded an indirect free kick on
a foul called near the USF net.
Bergman shot the hall to Stu
Rawlings, who headed the ball
into the goal for a 1-0 Stanford
lead.
The Dons toughened after their
varsity arrived in the middle of
the first quarter, and tied the
score on Lynch’s shot halfway
through the second period.
Stanford dominated play in the
second half, but was unable to
push in the go-ahead score until
the overtime. Bergman, Chuk
wudebe and A1 Nnoli continually
got I tie ball deep into USF terri
tory, but couldn’t hold the advan
tage.
IT WAS fitting that Chukwude
be get the winning score, as he
marely missed clinching the con
test with only 15 seconds remain
ing in regulatoin play. He stode
the ball, dribbled past a defense
man and shot (he ball toward the
far corner; it hit the post and
agonizingly caromed away.
The first eight minutes of the
overtime were uneventful, but
the remainder had Stanford play
ers and spectators screaming.
The Cards got the ball at mid
field on fullback Sandy Pofahl’s
long boot. The Tribe moved into
position and bombarded the goal
with shots before Chukwudebe
scored.
The contest could best be
termed loosely played, as the
Cards often forgot teamwork in
the heat of battle and failed to
take advantage of passing oppor
tunities. However, nothing can be
taken away from the magnificent
play of center-halfback Bill
Teusch. who hounded Lynch
from start to finish and did well
to hold him to two breakaways
and one goal. He and goalie Muel
ler, fullbacks Pofahl and Rich
Lonergan, and halfbacks Don
Burr and Jim Armstrong were
