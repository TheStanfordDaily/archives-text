# Oregon Offense Too Good For Indians. As Expected
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Once again Oregon’s Mel Ren
fro showed Stanford how good a
halfback can be. He scored three
touchdowns against the Indians,
and with sophomore quarterback
Bob Berry adding a fourth, Ore-
I gon coasted to a 2814 win over
I Stanford, Saturday, in Portland’s
I Multnomah Stadium.
While Renfro got the touch
downs. it was Berry who must
gel the credit for the Oregon win.
Although the quarterback from
San Jose completed only three of
i seven passes for the Webfoots,
! one a 42-yard touchdown pass to
j Renfro; however, it was his run
| ning that hurt the Indians most,
j Berry continually kept the Ore
| gon attack going with keepers,
| picking up a total of 48 yards on
j eight attempts.
[ The Indians were able to slow
; the Oregon offense, holding them
i to 320 yards total yardage, far
j below their 413-yard average.
However, Oregon was able to con
! tain the Stanford offense com
pletely until the fourth quarter
j when, with a 21-0 margin, Oregon
| coach Len Casanova began emp
| lying the Oregon bench.
THE DUCKS were never really
I threatened after Berry plunged
i across the Stanford goal line mid
! way in the opening quarter for
j the first Webfoot touchdown.
While Renfro was making the
score 21-0 with second and third
i quarter touchdowns, Stanford
was an example of offensive fu
tility. The only sustained Indian
! drive of the game’s first forty -
| five minutes ended in the second
: quarter when Renfro intercepted
ja pass from quarterback Clark
| Weaver on the Oregon eight.
WEAVER FINALLY engineer
| ed a fourth-quarter drive from
1 the Stanford 32-yard line that put
j the Indians in scoring column, al
| though they still trailed 21-8 after
j a two-point conversion.
However, any lingering doubts
j by any of Ihe 29,805 in attendance
that Stanford was still in the
j game were quickly ended. Berry,
I Renfro, halfback Larry Hill, and
fullback Jim Josephson com
j bined in a 44-yard scoring drive,
i with Renfro getting his third slx
| pointer of the day on an eight
yard run.
The Indians took advantage of
| a two-yard punt by the Webfoots’
! reserve punter, Chuck Miller, for
their final touchdown. Miller,
hurried by a hard Stanford rush,
punted the ball high in the air,
but not very far. the pigskin com
i ing to rest on the Oregon 42-yard
! line.

Thurlow completed a pair of
passes to halfback Chris Jessen
to move (he ball to the nine. On
the next play, Thurlow, trying to
run the ball across, was hit and
fumbled at the five. The ball con
tinued without Thurlow into the
Oregon end zone wheie Stanford
center Carl Schrader recovered
it to make the final score 28-14.
STANFORD'S BIGGEST ac
complishment of the afternoon
seemed to be containing Oregon’s
breakaway speed. The Ducks
turned loose Hill (64 yards
in 10 attempts), Renfro, (63 yards
in 14 attempts), and Berry on the
Stanford defense, and they could
only grind out yardage in an un
spectacular though reliable man
ner; their attack, with the single
exception of Berry’s 42-yard pass
to Renfro, lacked the long scoring
plays of previous Oregon games.
AT I.FAST the Indians can re

lax for a while now. They won't
face Renfro for another year.
