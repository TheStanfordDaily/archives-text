## 
### 
By PAGE EDWARDS
An almost unheard of, but
highly rewarding, field of study—
Broadcasting and Film has re
cently transferred to the Depart
ment of Communications at Stan
ford.
The recent transfer places all
the areas of mass media study
under one department to provide
a more comprehensive and di
verse study of communications.
THE NEW division in the Com
munications Department present
ly is undergoing a period of inte
gration with the other tw'o divi
sions in the department, the In
stitute for Communication Re
search and the division of Jour
nalism.

With the merger, the students
in the Communications Depart
ment will he provided with a
greater opportunity to indulge in
the process of creating films,
television productions and radio
shows.
Associate Executive Head of
the Communications Department,
Stanley T. Conner said that, the
merger of the Broadcasting and
Film division will enable non-ma
jors also to take the courses in
the division with the only restric
tion being the usual prerequisites
required for advanced courses.
THE BROADCASTING and
Film division schedules courses
dealing with every conceivable
aspect of film, radio and tele
vision. The courses range from
theory and history of production
to writing and criticism.
The Practice in Film course, of
fered autumn quarters, allows
the student to produce his own
non-fiction film. The department
supplies the necessary equipment
and materials. The course famili
arizes the student with the ele

i ments of lighting, editing, sound
j recording and the various other
1 techniques of production.
The broadcasting and film writ
ing courses assist the student in
creating education programs, an
nouncements and drama scripts.
I Courses are also offered in the
[ history of both film and broad-
I casting, studying each as it has
j developed as an art form and
i media for communication.
THE HISTORY courses develop
I a working knowledge of film and
; broadcasting which can be di
rectly applied to criticism. The
division offers an advanced
course in broadcasting and film
criticism exploring its objectives
and importance in society.
This little-heard-of department
j is said to have the broadest liber-
I al arts curriculum of any depart
ment at Stanford. The student is
required to take 25 units of the
ory and production in the depart
ment to obtain a firm back
ground in the media.
