is not "for sissies”? H Classroom teachers of the West,
Alaska and Hawaii do so with the help of our Standard
School Broadcast, which, by dramatizing music from
symphony to jazz, adds a colorful dimension to learn
ing Gary and 2Vz million other boys and girls hear
this weekly radio program in their classrooms. : Has
it inspired in Gary a zest for the violin? Honestly, no.
Rut he now thinks the trombone is "swell,” and plays
it with vigor. His parents credit this new interest to the
classroom music. Hi Who knows how many children
have discovered an exciting new world through this
public service program? It has just started its 35th
consecutive year, so we have served quite
a few school generations. H Tune in some
Thursday. Adults enjoy the program, too.
