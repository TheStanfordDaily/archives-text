ENGINEERS- Can you intersect each of these
circles using 3 straight lines, without retracing or
removing your pencil from the paper?

ALL OUR PROBLEMS
ARE NOT THIS SIMPLE
We say “our” advisedly.
YOU have to decide which companies to
see about your future job. At a time when
you’ve already got more to do than you
can reasonably handle, it would be help
ful if making that job choice could be done
for you by slide rule —or computer.
If it's any consolation, WE are facing much
the same problem —from the opposite
side of the fence. We've got to make deci
sions about a lot of young Engineers like
you —also without benefit of slide rule or
computer. We must decide who would be
of help to us in tackling assignments in
today’s technologies of the aerospace and
electronics industries.
You DO have one advantage we haven't
you probably know something about
General Dynamics already. We’d like to
even the score a bit by finding out more
about you. A discussion might solve both
our problems.
Our Representative will be on your campus shortly with information about positions in
each of these divisions:
in CALIFORNIA —Convair and Astronautics Divisions in San Diego; Pomona Division in
Pomona
in NEW YORK Electronics and Telecommunication Divisions in Rochester
in TEXAS Fort Worth Division in Fort Worth
Incidentally, our man will have the solution to the puzzle along, just in case you missed it.
Why not make a date to see us at your Placement Office now?
