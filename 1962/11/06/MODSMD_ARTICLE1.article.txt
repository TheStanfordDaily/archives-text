# LASSU to Reconsider Policy for Overnights
## 
### 
The status of overnight policy
for the Stanford student body is
still in question, according to Jer
ry Jackson, chairman of LASSU
By-law Committee. Overnight
policy was discussed at a LASSU
meeting two weeks ago when
ASSU Vice-President Priscilla
Ferguson introduced an amend
ment to the ASSU By-laws re
garding overnights.

The draft of the amendment
was a part of a recommendation
made by the joint Faculty-Stu
dent Committee on Student Af
fairs and Services to President
Sterling.
The greater part of the amend
ment was accepted as proposed
and became part of the By-laws.
Several points of the original
draft were altered somewhat,
however, and at least two para
graphs were deleted entirely.
THE QUESTION of overnight
policy was reopened, according
to Maureen Strain, a student
member of the Student Affairs
Committee, because members of
the committee felt that LASSU
was presented with the contents
of the amendment immediately
before having to vote on it, and
did not have enough time to con
sider and discuss it with their
living groups.

In a letter to Jackson last
week. Dr. Eric Hutchinson, chair
man of the committee stated that
“ . . . a number of recommenda
tions that the Committee on Stu
dent Services and Affairs regard
as essential to the successful op
eration of overnight parties wore
rejected.”

JACKSON SAID that this con
sideration, plus what he termed
“strong opposition to the policy
in general” expressed to him per
sonally by representatives of
four fraternities, led him to move
at LASSU last Thursday that the
question be reopened and refer
red to the By-laws Committee for
a recommendation.
Parts of the proposal which the
Committee on Student Affairs

and Services are particularly in
terested in seeing reinstated into
the policy, according to Miss
Strain, are:
4. (That) The accommodations
(for overnights) should he ade
quate for housing men and wom
en separately, should have ade
quate facilities to allow social
dancing, games, etc. The facilities
should lie in a community and in
no way isolated. There should lie
a high standard of cleanliness,
adequate lighting both inside and
outside, locks on the doors and
windows and a telephone avail
able. (This is in accordance with
AWS Social Regulations. The
President and Social Chairman pf
the living group would be in
structed that they do not merely
share in group responsibility but
bear individual responsibility
also). . . . ami may be subject to
judicial action over and above
any applied to the group as a
whole in the event of a violation
of the Fundamental Standard.
4. (d.) The President and Social
Chairman of an organizing group
provide assurance to the Vice
President of ASSU and the Dean
of Students that the above condi
tions (of overnight policy) will
be met.
There will be an open hearing
on the overnight policy tonight
at 7:30 in Room 267-268 of Tre
sidder Union. At this time the
Rules and By-laws Committee
will hear opinions on the policy
from representatives of the living
groups and will then formulate a
recommendation for LASSU.
The policy will probably be de
cided at the LASSU meeting this
Thursday night.
