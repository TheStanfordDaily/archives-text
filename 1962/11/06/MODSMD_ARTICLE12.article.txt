Republican incumbent Charles
Guhser of the 10th Congressional
District and Democratic chal
lenger James Thurber clashed on
Medicare and foreign aid last
Sunday in the last of the “Candi
dates and Issues” series present
ed at the First Congregational
Church in Palo Alto.
Gubser asserted that the King-
Anderson Bill “doesn’t do what
the people think.” He said the
hill “provides only 40 per cent of
the cost of hospitalization for
those over 65, and is a tax against
the working man. who is least
able to afford it.”
Gubser spoke in favor of his
own medical care bill which, he
said, would provide greater cover
age and would bo financed out of
general revenue.
CANDIDATE Thurber counter
ed with the assertion that the
King-Anderson Bill covered 60
per cent of the cost of hospitaliza
tion.
Referring to a canvass which
he had made of the voters in the
10th Congressional District, he
said that elderly voters “can
meet the doctor hills, the drug
bills, and the dental bills, but
they can’t meet the hospitaliza
tion costs. These are the costs
covered by the King-Anderson
Bill.”
When questioned about foreign
aid. Thurber voiced objection to-
Congressional action cutting off
aid to Yugoslavia and Poland.
CONCERNING the sending of
surplus food to Communist-con
trolled countries, Thurber assert
ed that “there are no political
bounds to hunger. I am in favor
of sending surplus food to needy
people everywhere.”
In answer to the surplus food
question, Gubser said that “to
answer in the negative would be
inhumane, but we should avoid
strengthening a nation avowed to
our destruction, except if giving
food would not contribute to their
military potential.”
