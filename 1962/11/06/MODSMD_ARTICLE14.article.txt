# Brown for Governor
## 
### 
Because gubernatorial candidate Richard Nixon has been un
able to find an issue with which he can effectively attack Gover
nor Brown’s record, Mr. Nixon has had to attack the Governor’s
personality. By attacking the personality instead of the record,
Mr. Nixon has gained political advantage, for the Governor’s
record is on the whole very good while his personality is less than
dynamic. But the overriding consideration is the incumbent’s
record—not his personality. And since the incumbent’s record is
good, we support Governor Brown in his bid for re-election.
Mr. Nixon has scored the Governor for bis irresolution in “get
ting the chiselers off the welfare rolls,” but this is hardly the mo
mentous issue that will rally the electorate behind the challenger.
Nor is anti-Communism a very solid issue unless the electorate is
convinced that California’s state government is threatened by in
ternal subversion. Furthermore, Mr. Nixon may rail against high
taxes’ scaring business away from California, but California’s econ
omy is accelerating faster than the economies of most states.
In an oblique way civil liberties were an issue several weeks
ago when Mr. Nixon stated that if elected he would issue an
executive decree to forbid from speaking at state universities
those persons taking the Fifth Amendment when questioned on
Communist activities by a legislative committee. In short, Mr.
Nixon’s respect is low for the principle of not having to testify
against oneself, even though the Constitution respects this prin
ciple.
Although Mr. Nixon’s position on speaker bans mav not be a
central issue in the campaign, it does indicate a general attitude
on his part that is extremely important: internal subversion is such
a threat to California that civil liberties should be restricted to
halt the internal Communist menace. Mr. Nixon’s decree, while
not abridging civil rights, does abridge the civil privileges of
speakers and of students desiring to hear and evaluate “danger
ous” opinions.
Because of Mr. Nixon’s attitude toward civil liberties and be
cause he has not been able to show that California is retrogressing
under the Brown Administration, we urge the re-election of Ed
mund G. (Pat) Brown for another term as Governor of California.

Although Mr. Nixon’s position on speaker bans mav not be a
central issue in the campaign, it does indicate a general attitude
on his part that is extremely important: internal subversion is such
a threat to California that civil liberties should be restricted to
halt the internal Communist menace. Mr. Nixon’s decree, while
not abridging civil rights, does abridge the civil privileges of
speakers and of students desiring to hear and evaluate “danger
ous” opinions.
Because of Mr. Nixon’s attitude toward civil liberties and be
cause he has not been able to show that California is retrogressing
under the Brown Administration, we urge the re-election of Ed
mund G. (Pat) Brown for another term as Governor of California.
Because gubernatorial candidate Richard Nixon has been un
able to find an issue with which he can effectively attack Gover
nor Brown’s record, Mr. Nixon has had to attack the Governor’s
personality. By attacking the personality instead of the record,
Mr. Nixon has gained political advantage, for the Governor’s
record is on the whole very good while his personality is less than
dynamic. But the overriding consideration is the incumbent’s
record—not his personality. And since the incumbent’s record is
good, we support Governor Brown in his bid for re-election.
Mr. Nixon has scored the Governor for bis irresolution in “get
ting the chiselers off the welfare rolls,” but this is hardly the mo
mentous issue that will rally the electorate behind the challenger.
Nor is anti-Communism a very solid issue unless the electorate is
convinced that California’s state government is threatened by in
ternal subversion. Furthermore, Mr. Nixon may rail against high
taxes’ scaring business away from California, but California’s econ
omy is accelerating faster than the economies of most states.
In an oblique way civil liberties were an issue several weeks
ago when Mr. Nixon stated that if elected he would issue an
executive decree to forbid from speaking at state universities
those persons taking the Fifth Amendment when questioned on
Communist activities by a legislative committee. In short, Mr.
Nixon’s respect is low for the principle of not having to testify
against oneself, even though the Constitution respects this prin
ciple.
