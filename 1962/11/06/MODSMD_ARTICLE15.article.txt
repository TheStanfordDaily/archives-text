## Catch-22' Shows Citizen Trapped in Wartime 
### ROSALIND GREENE 
“Catch-22” by Joseph Heller:
Dell Paperbacks, 75 cents, 468
pages, unabridged.
“Catch-22” by Joseph Heller is,
he assures us, a fictitious novel,
in which he describes the action
of the 256 th Squadron of the
United States Air Force. The ac
tion takes place during the final
months of World War 11, and un
winds from a small island in the
Mediterranean called Pianosa.
The objectives of the fighting
men of the 256 th become appar
ent as Capt. Yossarian, bombar
dier and hero, boldly sums up his
personal goal: “I don’t want to
be in the war anymore.”
HELLER, himself a veteran of
World War 11, describes the man
iacal activities of the armed
forces organization, which turns
out to be even less intelligent in
wartime than in peacetime. His at
titude is tongue in check toward
the administrators, compassion
ate toward the men in combat,
and protective toward himself, —
which is doubtless why he states
so emphatically on the page pre
ceding chapter one that he made
the whole mad thing up, that any
resemblance to reality is purely
coincidental, and therefore he is
free of any libelous intent regard
ing the esteemed Air Force of the
United States of America.
The essential issue that Heller
probes in this novel is, of course,
no more fictitious than war it
self. It’s simply a World War II
version of the Good Soldier
Schwek. Yossarian is the embodi
ment of the youthful male citizen
trapped in a world gone berserk.
His sense of logic tells him not to
accept active combat duty; his
sense of self-preservation tells
him not to adjust to it. Conse
quently, the war for Yossarian is
one frantic attempt after another
to get out of it, and “Catch-22” is
a running account of those at
tempts.
Mr. Heller has for the ‘organi
zation’ a natural irreverence
which emanates through each
characterization and every situa
tion. There is no directive issued
that is not bird-brained or sense
less, no maneuver ordered that is
not irresponsible or unnecessary.
The purpose of the war degener
ates into a project to give some
purpose to the lives of a few
otherwise purposeless individuals
—the administrators. As to the

enemy, Yossarian explains realis
tically that “the enemy is anyone
who wants to get me killed.”

NOT ALL OF the men share
Yossarian’s sentiments, only the
men who have to fly the combat
missions. The administrators
have their own problems. Capt.
Black, for instance, is anxious
that the men sign loyalty oaths
before going into combat. “All of
the enlisted men and officers on
combat duty had to sign a loyalty
oath to get their map cases from
the intelligence tent, a second
loyalty oath to receive their flak
suits and parachutes from the
parachute tent, a third loyalty
oath ... to ride from the squad
ron to the airfield in one of the
trucks.” “The important thing is
to keep them pledging,” Black ex
plained. As the war lasts, Yos
sarian finds his way to the Base
Hospital psychiatrist.
“You’re immature,” the psy
chiatrist observes. “You've
been unable to adjust to the
idea of war.”
“Yes, sir.”
“You had a morbid aversion
to dying. You probably resent
the fact that you’re at war and
might get your head blown off
any second.”
“I more than resent it sir.
I’m absolutely incensed.”
“Then you admit you’re
crazy, do you?”
"Crazy?” Yossarian was
shocked. “What are you talk
ing about? Why am I crazy?
You’re the one who’s crazy!”

WITH A performer’s sense of
timing, Heller creates official con
fusion after confusion, and ex
ploits their comic potential to the
hilt. He systematically extends
the illogical and ludicrous to their
logical conclusions, and with this
technique, and wartime as the
setting, the possibilities for com
edy become limitless. The dia
logue which supports all this ac
tion is an easy banter that cap
tures the drama of the episodes
and the personalities of the men.
However, the prospect of being
shot to death while in the back
end of a bomber is the reality to
which Heller always returns. Be
cause the men in the Squadron
are endowed with an innocence,
such death is unjust and pathetic,
a sickening reality. Yossarian
considers such a death unnatural,
but not everybody does. That’s
the catch. In away, that’s “Catch
-22.”
