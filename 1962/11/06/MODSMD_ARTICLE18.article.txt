## Nixon and Chotiner: Together Once Again 
### RON BASS Contributing Editor 
Democrats are grand sports. Somehow they happened to get
word that Mr. Murray Chotiner, a private citizen who lias been

much in the news of late, has I
money and creative energy in pi
Jars about Governor Pat Brown,
Chotiner’s part, but due to some
technical legal mix-up it seems
that he cannot send any more of
them through the mails. The
Democrats, square-shooters that
they are, proceeded to buy out
Paladin’s Saturday night time
slot just to give the people of
California a chance to see Mr.
Chotiner’s handiwork. That’s the
American Way.
The name of the show was
“Nixon and Chotiner: Together
Again,” and starred all-time ob
jective columnist Drew Pearson,
with a kangaroo court including
Stanley Mosk, Eugene Wyman
and Tom Lynch. Yet, it was about
the gentlest ding session I have
ever witnessed. No one so much
as raised his voice in what was
clearly a grim effort to avoid
counter-charges of smearism. In
point of fact, there was such a
lackluster absence of emotion
that one might have been tempt
ed to listen to the issues if there
had been any.
ACTUALLY, there was a brief
attempt at a positive presentation
as Attorney-General Mosk and
San Francisco Attorney Lynch
dutifully recited some painfully
nebulous statistics on crime and
punishment. Especially punish
ment, which they assure us has
been both “tough” and “humane.”
The main points of the show
were negative ones. They were
delivered with all the finesse of
Attila the Hun, but they were
most effective.
For an opener, Pearson trotted
out a little pamphlet entitled the
"California Dynasty of Commu
nism.” They showed a photo
graph from the pamphlet of Pat
Brown bowing to Nikita Khrush
chev. Then they showed the origi
nal uncut photo, which displayed
Gov. Brown bowing to a little
Laotian girl. Pearson informed us
that Richard Nixon had disavow
ed connection with this leaflet.
He then brought forward a young
lady who said that she had paid
$1 at Republican Headquarters
for some Republican materials,
and had been given this “Dynasty
of Communism” pamphlet along
with other literature.
The next case in point was en
titled “Pat Brown and the CDC.”
This showed a picture of Brown
applauding and explained that he
was displaying his approval of
the CDC’s stand on the admission
of Communist China to the Unit
ed Nations. This would seem to
be a less than accurate assertion
since Brown has repeatedly
voiced strong opposition to the
Peking admission. The uncut pho
to was then flashed on the screen,
showing Brown applauding the
speech of a polio-stricken girl at
a banquet. When informed of this
picture Nixon remarked, “If it’s
a fake picture, let them prove
it.” which is a terrific comeback.
Mr. Chotiner had apparently told
a group of Young Republicans
earlier in the year that a million
copies of this pamphlet would be
distributed in California.
FOR SHEER volume the cham
pion has to be the post card poll.
These cards held that Brown is a
captive of the CDC, and were
printed in numbers nearing two
million at an estimated cost of
$150,000. That is pretty expensive
mud. The name on the card is the
"Committee for the Preservation
of the Democratic Party.” but the
address is that of Nixon’s Los
Angeles Headquarters. Unfor
tunately, only 500,000 were mail
ed before the court injunction
shut down the presses, so Murray

cards. He can always paper his
walls with them. The cards asked
for money to be sent to a San
Francisco bank. The bank quickly
denied any connection with this
enterprise, and the court forced
Nixon to return all the money.

There have been three law
suits in the last two weeks alleg
ing that Murray’s literature has
attempted to “injure, discredit
and defame” the Governor while,
“violating the election code.” Up
on presentation of the materials
in question, all three pleas were
met with speedy injunctions.
Apparently the researchers had
really dug deeply into the Chot
iner files, for they came up with
one of his instruction pamphlets
which advised, “start out early
and destroy a man’s reputation.”
HERE AGAIN they attempted
to throw in positive remarks
about Brown’s record, including
a quote by Chief Justice Warren
that California “law enforcement
was the finest of any one of the
fifty states.” This was followed
by statistics and banal personal
compliments.
Then back to the smut. The
clincher was a pamphlet which
led off with “Have you had
enough of: High Taxes, Dope
Peddlers. Communist Sympathiz
ers?” The leaflet finished with,
“Vole for Richard Nixon, he’ll re
store our freedoms.” In view of
his anomalous stand on Universi
ty speakers, perhaps there should
have been an asterisk adding,
we take the fifth amend
ment.”

Let me emphasize these “facts”
about the Nixon-Chotiner Cam
paign were compiled by “Demo
cratic Associates Inc.”, and pre
sented as a paid political mes
sage. One may doubt the objec
tivity of the presentation, or even
more validly point out that the
program has failed to establish
the sainthood of Governor Brown.
Still, the pamphlets exist, the
court injunctions exist, and Nix
on and Chotiner are indeed back
together again.

AT THE CLOSE of the broad
cast, Pearson turned an austere
eye on all of us in T.V.-land and
made three closing remarks.
One of these was an expression
of gratitude to Governor Brown
for a campaign that had been
“constructive.” True or false,
that statement was hardly justi
fied by the evening’s presenta
tion.

He also stated that it was a
shame that the people of Cali
fornia were ignoring “the real is
sues, better schools, hospitals,
and transportation.” and closed
with the remark that Nixon was
“not following tactics that make
democracy live." These are per
haps the two saddest truths of
this election.
