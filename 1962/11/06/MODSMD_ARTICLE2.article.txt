### SUSAN BROWN 
I “Is Kennedy’s Cuba Policy
Right?” was the topic discussed
by four graduate students yester
day at Tresidder Union in a pro
gram co-sponsored by the Latin
| American Desk of the HR and the
| Political Union.
The panel W’as moderated by
I Ronald Chilcote. Assistant to the
Director of the Hispanic-Amcri
can Studies Department.
I Tom O’Leary, political science
Ph.D. candidate, opened the dis
cussion by stating his “qualified
support” for Kennedy’s recent
policy.
“IT IS NAIVE to say that the
[Cubans were setting up missile
i bases just for defense,” O’Leary
j said. Kennedy’s policy was a
| gamble, he continued, but in the
long run it “may have been more
dangerous to allow Cuba and
then others to install missile
bases.”
Dale Johnson, Ph.D. candidate
in sociology, believes that “the
administration’s action has served
to give courage to those who wish
militarily to annihilate Cuba and
overthrow Castro.”
OF KENNEDY’S “dangerous,”
“immoral” and “unintelligent”
policy, Johnson is “seriously
ashamed.” “We must ask our
selves what would have been dif
ferent if we had stepped in and
helped” Castro with the revolu
tion, he said.
Dick Weinig, M.A. candidate in
political theory, stated that in
light of the Soviet Union’s guid
ing motives to dominate the
world and to remove popular
rights of self-determination and
civil rights, Cuban defenses must
be considered immoral, because
by U.S. definition their purposes
are immoral.
Ole Holsti, who is working un
der Professor Robert North of
the Political Science Department
j on the Conflict Project, considers
1 Kennedy’s policy “essentially a
stall for time.”
THE MOVE showed that both
j East and West can remain ration
al in their serious attempts to
| avoid atomic war, Holsti said.
| But the Cuban policy cannot be
! applied to Berlin, and next time
jwe might not be so lucky with
I such a policy, he warned.
