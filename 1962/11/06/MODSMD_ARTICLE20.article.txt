Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Adrian dn Plessis’ article
j on South Africa in the Daily of
October 31 was, unfortunately,
| composed of a collection of inac
| curate and half-accurate plati
jtudes. on which I did not think it
I possible to make any meaningful
I comment. In his subsequent let
tci of November 2, however, and
j in some of his remarks quoted by
Susan Brown in her article of the
same date, he did inadvertently
touch on an issue which I feel
obliged to comment upon.
In his'” letter Mr. Du Plessis
states that “ . . , inadvertently
equating ‘African’ and ‘Afrika
ans’ ...” is an absurdity” . . .
akin to naming Governor Barnett
national chairman of the
N.A.A.C.P.” While the intention
may not have been this, it is cer
tainly easy to read in this face
tious remark the implication that
being an Afrikaner carries with
it the necessary characteristic of
being reactionary. Even a cursory
look at the facts should be suffi
cient to support the opposite con
clusion. I shall limit myself to
two observations to support this
contention.
On the political plane I think it
is relevant to point to the impor
tant role of Afrikaners in the re
cent formation of the Progressive
Party.
This party, after a relatively
brief politic al existence and while
putting up candidates in only 22
of the 73 contested seats, succeed
ed in the last general election in
drawing ten per cent of the vote
cast, and even Mr. Allard I.owen
stein in his recent Itook manages
to see in this a ray of hope for re
solving South Africa’s political
problems. The leader of the Pro
gressive Parly, Dr. Jan Steytler,
is an Afrikaner, and so are many
other prominent members, such
as Professor P. V. Pistorius and
Dr. I. S. Fourie.

Outside the active political
arena it is possible to draw up
an impressive list of more or less
outspoken Afrikaner critics of
the government, many of whom
are on the faculties of Mr. Du
Plessis’ “lily white schools.’’ Pro
fessor Ben Marais and the al
ready mentioned Professor Pis
torius are but two of these who
are relatively well-known in the
United States.

The above discussion may ap
pear to be no more than an emo
tional reaction. Had this been the
case, I would not have burdened
the readers of the Daily with this
letter. I think, however, that Mr.
Du Plessis’ remarks and my com
ments thereon provide a good il
lustration of what I regard as
one of the major flaws in think
ing about South Africa in liberal
circles, namely a large degree of
ignorance about political currents
within the Afrikaner community.

The stereotype belief is all too
often that Afrikaners form a
monolithic, reactionary unity, and
the result has been that Afri
kaners have not been welcome in
liberal circles in South Africa un
less they were willing to re
nounce all ties with Afrikaner
dom. It is my belief that as far as
Afrikaners are concerned, this
lias in no small degree been the
reason for tin* lack of influence
of liberals in South Africa of
which Mr. Du I’lessis speaks.

Mr. Du Plessis was frank
enough to admit of a degree of
insulation from (he outside world
that he feels exists in South Afri
ca; perhaps he will be equally
frank in admitting that for lan
guage and other reasons, most of
the people in the circles in which
he moves in South Africa, tend
to be insulated from thought in
the Afrikaans community on
their doorstep.
But the importance of all this
is not confined to South African
politics. On more than one occa
sion at Stanford I have run into
people who are quite vociferous
in their criticism of and advice to
South Africans who were com
pletely taken aback on learning
that there even exist such beings
as Afrikaners.

Also, among those who had
heard something about the exis
tence of Afrikaners, it has been
by experience that my mere stat
ing that I am an Afrikaner, is
usually enough to classify me in
the political spectrum. Conse
quently conversations tend to be
confined to such harmless topics
as the similarity between the cli
mate in the Cape Province and
that in California before the
smog took over. This, I submit, is
not a very useful procedure for
promoting international under
standing.
For those who still think that
I am making a big noise about a
triviality, I conclude with the fol
lowing quotation from an article
in the May ,1962, issue of “Africa
Report” by Professor Edwin S.
Munger, one of the very few for
eign observers who has found it
necessary to incorporate knowl
edge of Afrikaans and Afrikaners
in his assortment of tools for an
alyzing the South African situa
tion:
“In foreign reporting, just as
in South African politics, an im
portant segment of Afrikaner
feeling is not adequately reflect
ed.” I also urge them to read this
penetrating and provocative ar
ticle by one of the more astute
American students of African af
fairs.

I comment. In his subsequent let
tci of November 2, however, and
j in some of his remarks quoted by
Susan Brown in her article of the
same date, he did inadvertently
touch on an issue which I feel
obliged to comment upon.
In his'” letter Mr. Du Plessis
states that “ . . , inadvertently
equating ‘African’ and ‘Afrika
ans’ ...” is an absurdity” . . .
akin to naming Governor Barnett
national chairman of the
N.A.A.C.P.” While the intention
may not have been this, it is cer
tainly easy to read in this face
tious remark the implication that
being an Afrikaner carries with
it the necessary characteristic of
being reactionary. Even a cursory
look at the facts should be suffi
cient to support the opposite con
clusion. I shall limit myself to
two observations to support this
contention.
On the political plane I think it
is relevant to point to the impor
tant role of Afrikaners in the re
cent formation of the Progressive
Party.
This party, after a relatively
brief politic al existence and while
putting up candidates in only 22
of the 73 contested seats, succeed
ed in the last general election in
drawing ten per cent of the vote
cast, and even Mr. Allard I.owen
stein in his recent Itook manages
to see in this a ray of hope for re
solving South Africa’s political
problems. The leader of the Pro
gressive Parly, Dr. Jan Steytler,
is an Afrikaner, and so are many
other prominent members, such
as Professor P. V. Pistorius and
Dr. I. S. Fourie.

Outside the active political
arena it is possible to draw up
an impressive list of more or less
outspoken Afrikaner critics of
the government, many of whom
are on the faculties of Mr. Du
Plessis’ “lily white schools.’’ Pro
fessor Ben Marais and the al
ready mentioned Professor Pis
torius are but two of these who
are relatively well-known in the
United States.

The above discussion may ap
pear to be no more than an emo
tional reaction. Had this been the
case, I would not have burdened
the readers of the Daily with this
letter. I think, however, that Mr.
Du Plessis’ remarks and my com
ments thereon provide a good il
lustration of what I regard as
one of the major flaws in think
ing about South Africa in liberal
circles, namely a large degree of
ignorance about political currents
within the Afrikaner community.

The stereotype belief is all too
often that Afrikaners form a
monolithic, reactionary unity, and
the result has been that Afri
kaners have not been welcome in
liberal circles in South Africa un
less they were willing to re
nounce all ties with Afrikaner
dom. It is my belief that as far as
Afrikaners are concerned, this
lias in no small degree been the
reason for tin* lack of influence
of liberals in South Africa of
which Mr. Du I’lessis speaks.

Mr. Du Plessis was frank
enough to admit of a degree of
insulation from (he outside world
that he feels exists in South Afri
ca; perhaps he will be equally
frank in admitting that for lan
guage and other reasons, most of
the people in the circles in which
he moves in South Africa, tend
to be insulated from thought in
the Afrikaans community on
their doorstep.
But the importance of all this
is not confined to South African
politics. On more than one occa
sion at Stanford I have run into
people who are quite vociferous
in their criticism of and advice to
South Africans who were com
pletely taken aback on learning
that there even exist such beings
as Afrikaners.

Also, among those who had
heard something about the exis
tence of Afrikaners, it has been
by experience that my mere stat
ing that I am an Afrikaner, is
usually enough to classify me in
the political spectrum. Conse
quently conversations tend to be
confined to such harmless topics
as the similarity between the cli
mate in the Cape Province and
that in California before the
smog took over. This, I submit, is
not a very useful procedure for
promoting international under
standing.
For those who still think that
I am making a big noise about a
triviality, I conclude with the fol
lowing quotation from an article
in the May ,1962, issue of “Africa
Report” by Professor Edwin S.
Munger, one of the very few for
eign observers who has found it
necessary to incorporate knowl
edge of Afrikaans and Afrikaners
in his assortment of tools for an
alyzing the South African situa
tion:
“In foreign reporting, just as
in South African politics, an im
portant segment of Afrikaner
feeling is not adequately reflect
ed.” I also urge them to read this
penetrating and provocative ar
ticle by one of the more astute
American students of African af
fairs.

Susan Brown in her article of the
same date, he did inadvertently
touch on an issue which I feel
obliged to comment upon.
In his'” letter Mr. Du Plessis
states that “ . . , inadvertently
equating ‘African’ and ‘Afrika
ans’ ...” is an absurdity” . . .
akin to naming Governor Barnett
national chairman of the
N.A.A.C.P.” While the intention
may not have been this, it is cer
tainly easy to read in this face
tious remark the implication that
being an Afrikaner carries with
it the necessary characteristic of
being reactionary. Even a cursory
look at the facts should be suffi
cient to support the opposite con
clusion. I shall limit myself to
two observations to support this
contention.
On the political plane I think it
is relevant to point to the impor
tant role of Afrikaners in the re
cent formation of the Progressive
Party.
This party, after a relatively
brief politic al existence and while
putting up candidates in only 22
of the 73 contested seats, succeed
ed in the last general election in
drawing ten per cent of the vote
cast, and even Mr. Allard I.owen
stein in his recent Itook manages
to see in this a ray of hope for re
solving South Africa’s political
problems. The leader of the Pro
gressive Parly, Dr. Jan Steytler,
is an Afrikaner, and so are many
other prominent members, such
as Professor P. V. Pistorius and
Dr. I. S. Fourie.

Outside the active political
arena it is possible to draw up
an impressive list of more or less
outspoken Afrikaner critics of
the government, many of whom
are on the faculties of Mr. Du
Plessis’ “lily white schools.’’ Pro
fessor Ben Marais and the al
ready mentioned Professor Pis
torius are but two of these who
are relatively well-known in the
United States.

The above discussion may ap
pear to be no more than an emo
tional reaction. Had this been the
case, I would not have burdened
the readers of the Daily with this
letter. I think, however, that Mr.
Du Plessis’ remarks and my com
ments thereon provide a good il
lustration of what I regard as
one of the major flaws in think
ing about South Africa in liberal
circles, namely a large degree of
ignorance about political currents
within the Afrikaner community.

The stereotype belief is all too
often that Afrikaners form a
monolithic, reactionary unity, and
the result has been that Afri
kaners have not been welcome in
liberal circles in South Africa un
less they were willing to re
nounce all ties with Afrikaner
dom. It is my belief that as far as
Afrikaners are concerned, this
lias in no small degree been the
reason for tin* lack of influence
of liberals in South Africa of
which Mr. Du I’lessis speaks.

Mr. Du Plessis was frank
enough to admit of a degree of
insulation from (he outside world
that he feels exists in South Afri
ca; perhaps he will be equally
frank in admitting that for lan
guage and other reasons, most of
the people in the circles in which
he moves in South Africa, tend
to be insulated from thought in
the Afrikaans community on
their doorstep.
But the importance of all this
is not confined to South African
politics. On more than one occa
sion at Stanford I have run into
people who are quite vociferous
in their criticism of and advice to
South Africans who were com
pletely taken aback on learning
that there even exist such beings
as Afrikaners.

Also, among those who had
heard something about the exis
tence of Afrikaners, it has been
by experience that my mere stat
ing that I am an Afrikaner, is
usually enough to classify me in
the political spectrum. Conse
quently conversations tend to be
confined to such harmless topics
as the similarity between the cli
mate in the Cape Province and
that in California before the
smog took over. This, I submit, is
not a very useful procedure for
promoting international under
standing.
For those who still think that
I am making a big noise about a
triviality, I conclude with the fol
lowing quotation from an article
in the May ,1962, issue of “Africa
Report” by Professor Edwin S.
Munger, one of the very few for
eign observers who has found it
necessary to incorporate knowl
edge of Afrikaans and Afrikaners
in his assortment of tools for an
alyzing the South African situa
tion:
“In foreign reporting, just as
in South African politics, an im
portant segment of Afrikaner
feeling is not adequately reflect
ed.” I also urge them to read this
penetrating and provocative ar
ticle by one of the more astute
American students of African af
fairs.
