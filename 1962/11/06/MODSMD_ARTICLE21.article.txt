## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
On Saturday afternoon Marty j
Hull demonstrated that ho is one |
of Die greatest collegiate water }
polo players in the country. In a |
personal showdown with Ron j
Crawford, the three-time All- j
American center forward of Long j
Beach State. Hull scored seven j
goals in nine attempts, far out
shining Crawford in leading his |
team to a 10-9 victory.
The game was the best Stan- j
ford has played all year and the j
most exciting that has been seen j
here in many seasons.
For the first three quarters. !
Stanford, playing near-perfect j
water polo, outclassed Long I
Beach State by a substantial mar- [
gin. The team which was ranked
first in the nation before the
game, fell behind 4 1 by the end j
of the first quarter. Hull had two
goals and Boh Farrell and Pete
Pettigrew one each. However, de
fensive specialist Don Buehler’s
three fouls were an indication of
impending trouble.
By half time Stanford led 8-2,
Hull and Jim Youd had scored
three more goals, but Buehler
was forced to retire after his
fourth foul. Pettigrew with three
and Hull with two were also in
danger.

In the third quarter Pettigrew
committed his fourth and left the
game. However, Hull scored Stan
ford’s ninth goal and his sixth,
and by the end of the period, the
Indians still had a comfortable
9 ! lead.
Long Beach State showed that
their high ranking was no mis
take as they roared back with
three quick goals in the first
three minutes of the fourth peri
od.
Then Hull lunged out of the
water, grabbed a penalty pass
from Mike Conn in one hand, and
smashed it by the Long Beach
goalie, for what proved to be the
winning margin. This scoi'e was
Hull’s final effort, for he fouled
out shortly after. Long Beach got
two more goals against the weak
ened Stanford team.
With a minute left it was 10-9
and Long Beach definitely had
the upper hand. However, Stan
ford gained possession and calm
ly froze the ball until the final
gun.
On Friday afternoon Stanford
asserted their superiority over
another strong team, UCLA. The
Bruins had edged the Tribe 4-3
in LA a week before, but this
time Stanford destroyed the
Uclans 15-3.
Stanford led 5-0 at the half,
with Hull, despite an injured
hand, leading the way with three
goals. Bill Lorton and Pettigrew

had one apiece. The game was
never in doubt thereafter. In the
second half Hull scored three
more times-. Pettigrew got two
more and Lorton got one.
The Stanford juggernaut team
swamped San Jose State 10-2 on
Saturday morning. Hull, playing
but ten minutes, scored four
goals. Pettigrew and second
string center forward, Brian
Beck, a fine shooter in his own
right, had two each.

All American center forward Ron Crawford of Long Beach looks on.
On Saturday afternoon Marty j
Hull demonstrated that ho is one |
of Die greatest collegiate water }
polo players in the country. In a |
personal showdown with Ron j
Crawford, the three-time All- j
American center forward of Long j
Beach State. Hull scored seven j
goals in nine attempts, far out
shining Crawford in leading his |
team to a 10-9 victory.
The game was the best Stan- j
ford has played all year and the j
most exciting that has been seen j
here in many seasons.
For the first three quarters. !
Stanford, playing near-perfect j
water polo, outclassed Long I
Beach State by a substantial mar- [
gin. The team which was ranked
first in the nation before the
game, fell behind 4 1 by the end j
of the first quarter. Hull had two
goals and Boh Farrell and Pete
Pettigrew one each. However, de
fensive specialist Don Buehler’s
three fouls were an indication of
impending trouble.
By half time Stanford led 8-2,
Hull and Jim Youd had scored
three more goals, but Buehler
was forced to retire after his
fourth foul. Pettigrew with three
and Hull with two were also in
danger.

In the third quarter Pettigrew
committed his fourth and left the
game. However, Hull scored Stan
ford’s ninth goal and his sixth,
and by the end of the period, the
Indians still had a comfortable
9 ! lead.
Long Beach State showed that
their high ranking was no mis
take as they roared back with
three quick goals in the first
three minutes of the fourth peri
od.
Then Hull lunged out of the
water, grabbed a penalty pass
from Mike Conn in one hand, and
smashed it by the Long Beach
goalie, for what proved to be the
winning margin. This scoi'e was
Hull’s final effort, for he fouled
out shortly after. Long Beach got
two more goals against the weak
ened Stanford team.
With a minute left it was 10-9
and Long Beach definitely had
the upper hand. However, Stan
ford gained possession and calm
ly froze the ball until the final
gun.
On Friday afternoon Stanford
asserted their superiority over
another strong team, UCLA. The
Bruins had edged the Tribe 4-3
in LA a week before, but this
time Stanford destroyed the
Uclans 15-3.
Stanford led 5-0 at the half,
with Hull, despite an injured
hand, leading the way with three
goals. Bill Lorton and Pettigrew

had one apiece. The game was
