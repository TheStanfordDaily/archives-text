## 
### 
! Sophomore Paul Schlieke set a |
j new Stanford three-mile record j
j last Saturday to lead Stanford’s!
cross country team to a convinc
j ing win over UCLA, Cal, and i
Santa Barbara in a meet at Ber j
I keley.
The score was Stanford 2(i. i
UCLA -19. Cal 51, and Santa Bar -i
bara 104.
SCHI.K KM KAN a 0! second
last lap and a 2:10 final half mile,
finishing with his usual kick in
14:10.8 to break Keith Wallace’s
1959 mark of 14:14.1.
Stanford's Harry McCalla set
a brisk pace, leading for most of
the first 11 laps. Then Schlieke
flashed by him and pulled away
steadily for the final quarter
mile. McCalla was second in
14:14, and Cal's John Hatton
notched third in 14:18.
The Tribe’s great depth was ap
parent in the win, since despite
the loss of three good runners to
various ailments, tin 1 Indians still
captured three of the first four
places. Dave Deubner, out with a
I bruised foot; Bob Miltz, sidelined
j by a virus; and Weym Kirkland,
| injured with a pulled muscle, did
not run for Stanford.
SAN JOSH STATUS team,

which has two victories over the
Cards and was expected to be at
the meet, had raced the day be
fore and was not present,
The use of the track was neces
sitated by the washing out of

Cal’s regular cross country |
course by rain. Cal's band, prac- |
ticing on the field, obligingly sub- j
slituted for the missing obstacles, j

blaring loud, slow marches which
drowned out the starter's gun and
encouraged the runners to break
stride in lime to the music.
