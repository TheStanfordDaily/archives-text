# SMITH:
## Future Holds Development 
### BETSY WRIGHT 
There will be more exciting de
velopments in the next 40 years
than in the past 4,000. We need
to develop the skills and take the
risks so (hat this exciting life
will have meaning for all of us,
according to Professor Ralph J.
Smith in Tresidder Union yester
day afternoon. For his “last lec
ture,’’ he spoke on the effects of
modern technological advances
on society.
Emphasizing that ho was ad
dressing the “uncommon man,”
the Stanford student. Professor
Smith explained his thesis by
elaborating on its four basic
points,
FIRST, HE said that too many
persons distrust the present and
fearing the future are “looking
backward.” They want the “good
old days” but they’re forgetting
its bad points and also the ex
amples of these wonderful times
and the resulting “opportunities
beyond comprehension.”
Secondly, he said there is a
“fear of being replaced by new
and not well understood devices,”
i.e. technological unemployment.
But the machines in agriculture
and industry free those like Stan
ford students from the labor mar
ket. making opportunities to ad
vance our education, he said.
Third, there is “the desire to
know, which by man’s very na
ture” forces him to go, to try, to
move on toward “new spheres of
knowledge” and new realms of
humanism.
WE MUST keep an open mind,
he said, not trusting things simp
ly because they are printed in a
book, or ‘ratified by the seal of
ages.”
Fourth and finally, ho said. “I
am an optimist.” The future is
bright.
