SAN FRANCISCO (UPI)-Richard M. Nixon and Gov. Ed
mund G. Brown traded election-eve broadsides last night as their
marathon contest for governor neared its bitter end.

Nixon, in a telecast to be 1;
blast at Brown and the Dcmocr;

•earned to five cities, readied a
ats for what lie said was a cam
paign of “innuendoes.” Brown,
rounding out a one-day 11-city
“prop stop” tour of the entire
state, replied that (he former vice
president had conducted "one of
the dirtiest campaigns in Cali
fornia's history.”
The 57-year-old governor ac
cused Nixon and the Republicans
of trying throughout the cam
paign to make it appear that he
was “soft on Communism and
soft on crime.”
NIXON HAD BEEN scheduled
to make a traditional “gel out the
vote” television appeal yesterday
hut changed his mind and said he
would “take off the gloves and
fight back at these personal at
tacks against me and my family.”
“It’s very late in the cam
paign,” Brown replied, “and at
this eleventh hour I think the
voters of California would wel
come something from Mr. Nixon
other than invective about alleged
bumblers, carpet baggers, dere
licts and second raters who are
soft on Communism and crime.”
Pat Nixon, stumping in place
of her husband, yesterday termed
this campaign the “lowest” in
which she has participated.
“I HAVE been in many cam
paigns,” Mrs. Nixon said, “but
this is the lowest I have ever been
in—when you attack a man’s
family.”
Last-minute public opinion
polls showed Brown a slim favor
ite although many political ex
perts rated it strictly even with
perhaps as few as 50.000 votes
deciding the winner. The state
has 7.5 million registered voters,
4,289.000 of them Democrats.
