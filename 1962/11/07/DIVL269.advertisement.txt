I’ve had three
interviews

But your fourth interview might
be the most important. Especially if
it’s with the man from JPL
That's right, Jet Propulsion laboratory.
Caltech operates JPL for NASA.
Gives the place a campus
atmosphere. 3500 people there.
Eleven hundred of them are scientists
and engineers. The rest are
technicians, secretaries, librarians - -
all kinds of people to back up these
scientists and engineers.
JPL’s job? Space exploration.
Designing the spacecraft and
instrumentation that'll explore the
moon and planets. They want to find
out what the moon is made of and
if there's life on other planets. And
they will. They're a dedicated bunch.
And they like their work. After all, what
could be more fascinating and more
challenging than the work they do?

the man from JPL Make an
