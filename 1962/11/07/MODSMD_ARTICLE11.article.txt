# Governor Brown Leads Nixon By 100,000 Votes at Midnight
## 
### SAN FRANCISCO (UPI 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown grabbed
the load before 12 p.m. last night
over former Vice President Rich
ord M. Nixon in their race for
governor of California and clung
to his margin with more than 54
per cent of the expected vote
counted.
But eventual winner of the race
a contest that could mean po
litical oblivion for the loser—re
mained in doubt. Nixon’s spokes
men said it “looks like a horse

race all night long,’’
U.S. Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel,
GOP whip in the Senate, won re
election over State Sen. Richard
Richards of Los Angeles, the
same man he boat six years ago.
Returns from 15,751 of the 31,-
820 state precincts compiled at
midnight PST gave Brown 1,140,-
142, Nixon 1,034,748,
Balmy Indian summer weather
and the red hot Brown-Nixon con
test lured what may prove to be
a record off-year turnout in Cali
fornia. With 7,5 million register
ed voters, divided almost 3-2
Democratic, about 80 per cent or
6 million of them went to the
polls.
The initial trend, particularly
in populous Los Angeles County
which has 40 per cent of the state
vote, showed Brown’s margin to
be so close that Nixon still could
overcome the 57-year-old gover
nor’s lead.
The fate of two Republican
congressmen who are members
of the John Birch Society also
was unknown because of the
slowness of the count. Incumbent
GOP congressman John H. Rous
selot was trailing Democrat Ron
old B. Cameron on inconclusive,
fragmentary returns and Repub
lican. Congressman Edgar W.
Hiestand was neck-and-neck with
Los Angeles Councilman Everett
G. Murkhalter, D, with only a
handful of votes counted.
Incumbent Republican Charles
Gubser led Democrat James
Thurber in the race for the 10th
congressional seat. At midnight
PST, with only 226 of the dis
trict’s 1019 precincts reporting,
Gubser was loading Thurber by
a vote of 3830-2521.


GOVERNOR BROWN, at his headquarters last night said "I have a
victory statement in this pocket and another statement in this one."

Gubser led Democrat James
Thurber in the race for the 10th
