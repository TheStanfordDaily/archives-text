# ST&T to Answer Questions on Policy
## 
### 
Why isn’t there more careful
selection of Stanford students
and faculty? Just what does Mrs.
Stanford’s will say?
These questions and many
more will be directed toward a
panel of Stanford administrators
tomorrow at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The program “Stan
ford Perspective," is being spon
sored by the Stanford Today and
Tomorrow Committee.
After a brief introduction of
the panel, the moderator will di
rect questions to Alf. E. Brandin,
Vice President for Business Af
fairs; Kenneth M. Cuthbertson,
Vise President for Finance and
Chairman of PACE; Frederic O.
Glover, Executive Assistant to
the President; Lyle M. Nelson,
Director of University Relations;
and Robert J. Wert, Vice Provost.
“Stanford Perspective” should
answer many of the questions
which occur most frequently
among students showing concern
over university policy and admin
istrative decisions,” said John
Frohnmayer, Chairman of ST&T,
