When the ASSU Legislature adopted resolutions approving
Proposition 13 and condemning Proposition 24 last Thursday, they
departed from tradition in order to'take a stand on political issues.
(Proposition 13 provides for further tax exemption for private
universities. Proposition 24 is the anti-subversive proposal.)
In the past Legislature has cautiously avoided mixing in state
or national political issues. Two years ago they even balked at
passing a resolution approving the Peace Corps idea being pub
licized by Senator Humphrey. Although more controversial issues
than Proposition 13 and less universally condemned Propositions
than 24 would have caused Legislature to balk this time also, the
fact is that Legislature was willing to speak out on political issues.
Ihe precedent is welcome as an indication that the Stanford
•student community is willing to take political stands publicly.
