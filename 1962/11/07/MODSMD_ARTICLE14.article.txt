# FILM FESTIVAL
## 'By Treating Reality With Artificiality Bulgarian Film Becomes Small Bomb' 
### JANET LYN KIPPEN 
The sixth San Francisco Inter
national Film Festival opened at
the Metro Theater Thursday eve
ning with “Sun and Shadow,” the
first Bulgarian film ever entered.
If it was this "first” that war
ranted it the opening night spot,
one might hope they consider a
different system of selection.
The brooding story takes place
on the coast of the Black Sea and
concerns two young lovers threat
ened by shadows of death, atomic
war and intolerance. One pre-
Festival critic had hailed it “a
leading contender for the Golden
Gate award honors” on the
strength of that nation capturing
the top prize earlier this year at
Czechoslovakia’s Karlovy Vary
festival. There is little in the film
to support such predictions.
IN THE TITLE, Director Ran
gel Vulchanov has aptly describ
ed the film content and format.
“Sun” sequences have the two
“translucent” characters meet
ing on a bathing beach, falling in
love during romps in and out and
under the water, up and down the
lifeguard tower, over hill and
dune. In sudden and brutal juxta
position comes a “shadow” . . .
illusory sequences which simply
burst upon the screen in all man
ner of gimmickry.
The technical apparatus by
which Vulchanov presents the
shadows are reminiscent of sci
ence-fiction thrillers. Winds
sweep the beaches, umbrellas go

helter-skelter, the camera reels
and tilts, lights flash and fade,
superimposition flourishes. Then
off in the distance we hear an
American-type voice doing the fa
miliar countdown. 3-2-f. kaboom.
It is made quite clear who the
Bulgarians feel is threatening
their existence. When the smoke
clears a people-less paper-mache
and dry ice vapor world is left.
Beyond technical and propa
gandists considerations, there is
another . . . that of the “trans
lucent” characters. Vulchanov
says of them, "They are not con
crete people hut simply an idea
about people.” One wonders
whether he coined the term be
fore or after the film was made.
If the translucency concept
catches on, it should be a great
boon to those film makers who
never seem able to present a
character who is real and believ
able.
VULCHANOV’S theme is time
ly and well-chosen, as the threat
of mass annihilation is a very
real fear of man. But by treating
one of the hardest of all realities
with translucency, artificiality
and gimmicry, a potentially effec
tive missile becomes just a small
bomb.
“Sun and Shadow” was the
first of 23 film entries from 18
nations. Including the newsreel,
cartoon, short subject and non
theatrical 16mm entries, a total
of 34 nations are represented in
this festival, by far the largest
in its six-year history.
