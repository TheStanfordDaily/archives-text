Editor, The Daily:
The concept of “Atlantic Com
munity” involves some sort of
integration of both sides of the
Atlantic. Europe is currently
moving toward integration, but
what of the larger question of At
lantic integration? Must the lead
ership come from Europe? Might
not a suitable first step on this
side of the Atlantic be the inte
gration of Canada and the United
States? This would give impetus
to Europe’s own integration and
make for an easier transition to
a truly Atlantic Community.
In Europe there are two cur
rents, underlying the various
movements toward European in
tegration: idealism and practical
nationalism. If these two motives
cease to co-exist, and the Euro
pean governments revert to pure
ly national orientations, integra
tion will be stalled. (Of course it
would proceed if the governments
chose idealism.) Dave Kennedy,
in his HR political analysis col
umn in The Daily, October 29,
clarified this issue.
Idealism and practical nation

alism do not presently coincide
for the United States and Canada.
Instead, each country looks to
ward Europe for its cues. They
do so, moreover, with nationalist
outlooks (which is not to say that
this does not have its place). Still,
the question arises: What must
conditions be before we cons
ciously move toward Canadian-
U.S. integration? Must we be
faced with immediate and con
tinual threats (as Western Eu
rope is by Russia) before we see
the value in integration? Is over
whelming calamity the only im
petus we can expect, as when
Churchill offered dual citizenship
to France during World War II?
Or can we, by the very act of our
early, constructive planning, gain
the strength-in-unity that will all
the better avert such calamities
and promote mutual welfare?
To be sure, this is but a brief
sketch. I hope that the llR’s At
lantic Community Conference on
December 1 will consider the
question of constructive action on
this side of the ocean toward the
goal of Atlantic Community.
