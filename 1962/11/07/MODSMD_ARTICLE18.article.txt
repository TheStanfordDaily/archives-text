West Berlin today still is the 1
It has more than 6,000 industrial p
ployees. West Berlin’s electronics i
of Switzerland and Austria toget
typesetting and printing machine
market for the city’s products is.'t
of course, the Federal Republic
of Germany. Thus West Berlin
produces every third dress that is
worn in West Germany, every
third cigarette that is smoked
and every third film that is
shown in West Germany. In 1960
West Berlin’s exports amounted
to $305,750,000, which is twice as
much as Ireland’s.
The measures taken by the
communists on August 13, 1961
were also directed toward de
stroying West Berlin’s flourish
ing industry and the Berliner’s
will to survive. But instead of the
expected breakdown of the city’s
economy the Wall Has but served
to intensify the determination to
develop and strengthen the busi
ness climate.
NEVERTHELESS there is no
denying the fact that Berlin in
its geographically isolated posi
tion has a bunch of economic
problems. Businessmen’s interest
in investing in West Berlin is not
strong enough because of the
doubtful political situation.
Transportation to and from West
Berlin is difficult because of the
East German control and their
charging of money for using the
access roads.
After the crucial days of Au
gust, 1961. the 63,000 East Ber
liners coming to work in West
Berlin were kept away from their
jobs. As it was almost impossible
to obtain additional labor in Ber
lin since there were only 13,000
unemployed with 24,000 unfilled
vacancies by the end of Septem
ber 1961, the Berlin economy and
administration introduced auto
mation equipment and tried to re
cruit skilled and other labor from
West Germany. As a matter of
fact 7,5000 workers came to Ber
lin during the following months.
The Berlin Senate will try to at
tract 15,000 to 20,000 new workers
to Berlin each year.
To this end, certain material
advantages for those interested
in coming to Berlin have been in
troduced. In addition to West
German Government measures of
aid, there are new taxation pref
erences and extra allowances for
those who take employment in
the city; credits are given to as
sist young married couples who
settle in West Berlin.
HUNDREDS of West Berlin
shops and movie theaters near
the Wall had to close their doors
because their customers from
East Berlin stayed away. The
Berlin Senate has worked out an
aid plan to meet their material
losses.
The West Berlin economy is
now in a situation in which it
cannot be satisfied by merely
stabilizing conditions. The con
stant communist pressure and
threat on the city demands coun
termeasures and new goals. Even
before the outbreak of the Berlin
Crisis the nations of the Euro
pean Economic Community in
their constituting meeting in
Rome in 1957 offered their aid to
the West Beilin economy: “In
accordance with the desire to
strengthen their ties with Berlin,
the ratifying nations will support
all measures within the Commu
nity necessary to improve Ber
lin’s economic and social situa
tion, to further Berlin’s program
of reconstruction and secure its
economic stability.”
With this assurance and the ac
tive support of the West German
Government, an expansion of in
dustry is a vital necessity if West
Berlin wants to survive at least
the next twenty years. An expan
sion of industry will mean a de
cisive change in economic policy.
Government intervention and fi

largest industrial city in Germany.
)lants and more than a million em
industry produces more than those
her. It is the largest producer of
?s in Germany. The main export

nancial aid must not be the only
source for increasing production
and welfare. The Berlin Admin
istration basically rejects such
government intervention which
might have compelled some pri
vate businessmen to remain in
Berlin. It will be of great politi
cal and economic significance
that further West German and
foreign private investments are
encouraged. For this reason, a
lasting agreement which would
legally secure the right of access
to Berlin for everybody should
be the next step to be taken. (The
attainment of economic expan
sion has to depend on private in
terest and initiative to secure a
natural development of the city’s
industry.)
THE WEST German Govern
ment aid plan as the only re
source for the economic develop
ment would only bring about an
artificial stability.
An important factor in the eco
nomic planning of the city gov
ernment is the structure of the
city’s population. The ratio of
women in Berlin is greater than
in any other part of Germany;
44 per cent of them have regular
employment. Berlin also has to
meet the problem of a population
that in proportion is too old. It
follows that steps must be taken
to rectify this situation, mainly
to attract and assist young peo
ple and provide the older people
with the opportunity to play an
active roll in a society that needs
them.

West Berlin’s gross national
product increased after the erec
tion of the wall. A lively interest
for investing money in Berlin
has been shown by American cir
cles. The Government aid plan
will provide even more support
for the Berlin economy next year.
West Berlin’s production index
has reached its highest point
since 1945 this year. These facts
show, that West Berlin’s econom
ic situation is not as bad as it is
sometimes believed to be. It may
be true that a decision over Ber
lin will not come from political
action but according to the city’s
economic failure or success. A
careful planning of the city’s eco
nomic development must there
fore be the basis for any further
considerations of the Berlin prob
lem.
