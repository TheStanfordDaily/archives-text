Editor, The Dally:
In reply to Mr. Brand’s letter, I
would like to make the following
points.
1). I did not use the word “ab
surdity” at any stage. Mr.
Brand’s quotation seems to imply
this.

2). He is quite correct when he
says “While the intention may
not have been this ...” I cer
tainly did not wish to convey the
impression that all Afrikaans
speaking South Africans are
what Mr. Brand calls “reaction
aries.” It is just that the vast ma
jority of them are; as are the
majority of English-speaking
South Africans as well. Mr.
Brand will probably agree with
this comment.

3.) I did not “inadvertently”
touch on the issue. It was deliber
ate.

4). I am sorry that he feels my
letter was composed of “inaccu
rate and half-accurate plati
tudes.” The implication of dis
honesty does not worry me par
ticularly, I am disappointed how
ever. that he found it impossible
“to make any meaningful com
ment" on my platitudes. Surely

if the article was as inaccurate
as he suggests, he should have
been able to correct my distor
tions of fact; or does he believe
that it is always easier to dis
credit the man than to attack his
ideas?
5). The Progressive Party’s
"ray of hope’ has been fairly con
vincingly extinguished by re
sounding defeats in every by
election since the general elec
tion.
