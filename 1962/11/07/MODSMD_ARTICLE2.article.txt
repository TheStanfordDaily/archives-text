# Herbert Presents Strange Antarctic'
## 
### 
“The Strange Antarctic” was
discussed yesterday afternoon in
Tresidder by Wally W. Herbert,
who spent the last 18 months as
a member of the New Zealand
Expedition at Scott Base.
The strangeness of Antarctica
is found in the amazing contrasts
on the continent, said Herbert.
Aided by colored slides, he pre
sented the differences between
huts built by explorers fifty
years ago and present shelters at
McMurdo Sound and Scott Base;
the monotony of glacial land
scapes and the pastel beauty of
the mountain ranges; the blind
ing winter blizzards and the crisp
summer vistas; and living condi
tions in comfortable American
and New Zealand bases against
the spartan British bases.
HERBERT has participated in
both British and New Zealand
expeditions, but prefers the more
rugged British conditions. Such
challenges as running out of food
give one interesting memories of
an Antarctic winter, ho feels.
Polar exploration affords many
unique experiences. A white-out,
caused when a cloud blots out the
horizan. is “just like being inside
of a ping-pong ball.” In Herbert’s
opinion, the Antarctic is most
beautiful in the spring when the
sun has just returned to the con
tinent.
Herbert first went to Anarctica
in 1954 as a surveyor with the
British Antarctic Expedition at
Hope Bay. Last summer a group
under his direction set up a sur
vey station on the highest moun
tain yet climbed on the continent.
“WITHIN THE next ten years
there might be a community of
women in Antarctica,” said Her
bert. Asked if a mixed expedition
would work, he said, “Believe me
it doesn’t.” Herbert considers his
18-month stay on the continent
as a “most extraordinary stag
party.” If women were to invade
this last male outpost, then men
will have no other choice but to
go to the moon, said Herbert.

will have no other choice but to
go to the moon, said Herbert.
