# FILM FESTIVAL
## Indian, Argentine Movies to Play Tonight in City 
### PAGE EDWARDS 
The sixth annual San Francisco
Film Festival presents tonight at
8:45 at the Metro theater (Union
and Webkter streets) two pre
miere films, “Waves After
Waves,” an entry from India and

"Three Times Anna,” Argen
tina's entry.
The Festival which began last
Wednesday will run until next
Tuesday. Tickets for the evening
premieres are $2.50 and there
should be no need to call for res
ervations.

A NUMBER of the films in the
Festival are of the quasi-artsy
craft sy category and almost with
out exception display quality
photographic techniques hacked
by mediocre script and sound
track.
The two films scheduled for to
night may not fall into that cate
gory, In fact, they may turn out
to be more than helpful hints in
home movie making.
The Indian entry, “Waves After
Waves,” is a first film for all con
cerned, except the composer,
Ravi Shankar. Each member of
the cast is either an unknown bit
player or a non-actor who has
never been in front of a movie
camera before. Such is the case
for the two leads.
THE SCORE includes a taste of
traditional Indian music which
counterpoints the lyric, the ma
turing years of two young boys
and a girl residing in a small,
tranquil fishing village. The film
had good reviews in India.
The second feature, “Three
Times Anna” from Argentina, is
three separate stories centering
on the love and loneliness of An
na (Maria Vaner).
In the first story, Anna loves
unwisely and loses her child. The
second Anna, an unhappy student
searching for “kicks,” finds only
loneliness. The third, and more
intriguing Anna, exists only in
the imagination of a shy intro
verted dreamer.
THE THREE stories, relatively
unconnected as they are, should
be an interesting study in versa
tile acting.
Three films were shown Friday
night, one was of extremely high
quality“ David and Lisa,” the
United Stales entry.
The photography is not excep
tional nor is the script a slice of
life satiated with hidden inner
message. The movie is simply a
well told story of two emotion
ally disturbed teenagers who un
knowingly assist each other to
gain a grasp of life.
THE FILM is well cast with
Keir Dullea as David and Janet
Margolin as Lisa.
The action takes place in a
school for retarded children. Da
vid, an unemotional machine, is
afraid of feeling any inward com
passion for anything and abhors
displays of emotion. David’s ill
ness is manifested in a fear that
he will die if anyone touches him.
Lisa, in apposition, is irration
ally emotional, but (the film was
not produced in Hollywood) she
is not a nymphomaniac. When
Lisa is Lisa, all the time she
speaks in rhyme, all the time in
rhyme. When she is Murial, she
communicates by writing mes
sages in childish scrawl on a
large tablet.
GRADUALLY and painfully,
Lisa begins to trust David, and
he feels love for her. The slow
agonizing process of the two try
ing to attain a grasp of reality is
artfully rendered, and relief and
thankfulness evoke tears when
the two adolescents simply gain
the ability to communicate with
one another.
The entry from France, “Amer
ica the Unexpected,” is a somno
lent movie. The film is supposed
to catch many small details of
American culture that a French
tourist would see but details the
American considers every-day.
The film does catch many small
details and makes us laugh at our
foibles, but it is entirely too long.
The travel documentary begins
at sun rise on the Golden Gate
bridge and takes us on a tour of
the United States. A clever script
helps hold the details together,
but even a clever script without
backing becomes boring.
I SLEPT at various intervals
after the first hour. It was quite
an experience waking one time in
Disneyland face to face with the
mechanical hippo and the next be
hind the scenes of a strip joint.
The final scenes were aboard
an aircraft carrier in the Atlan
tic. As the jets whisked off the
deck, a chorus of 150 male and
female voices sang alternate
“Ooooo’s’ and “Eeeee's’ in four
part harmony.

In the first story, Anna loves
unwisely and loses her child. The
second Anna, an unhappy student
searching for “kicks,” finds only
loneliness. The third, and more
intriguing Anna, exists only in
the imagination of a shy intro
verted dreamer.
THE THREE stories, relatively
unconnected as they are, should
be an interesting study in versa
tile acting.
Three films were shown Friday
night, one was of extremely high
quality“ David and Lisa,” the
United Stales entry.
The photography is not excep
tional nor is the script a slice of
life satiated with hidden inner
message. The movie is simply a
well told story of two emotion
ally disturbed teenagers who un
knowingly assist each other to
gain a grasp of life.
THE FILM is well cast with
Keir Dullea as David and Janet
Margolin as Lisa.
The action takes place in a
school for retarded children. Da
vid, an unemotional machine, is
afraid of feeling any inward com
passion for anything and abhors
displays of emotion. David’s ill
ness is manifested in a fear that
he will die if anyone touches him.
Lisa, in apposition, is irration
ally emotional, but (the film was
not produced in Hollywood) she
is not a nymphomaniac. When
Lisa is Lisa, all the time she
speaks in rhyme, all the time in
rhyme. When she is Murial, she
communicates by writing mes
sages in childish scrawl on a
large tablet.
GRADUALLY and painfully,
Lisa begins to trust David, and
he feels love for her. The slow
agonizing process of the two try
ing to attain a grasp of reality is
artfully rendered, and relief and
thankfulness evoke tears when
the two adolescents simply gain
the ability to communicate with
one another.
The entry from France, “Amer
ica the Unexpected,” is a somno
lent movie. The film is supposed
to catch many small details of
American culture that a French
tourist would see but details the
American considers every-day.
The film does catch many small
details and makes us laugh at our
foibles, but it is entirely too long.
The travel documentary begins
at sun rise on the Golden Gate
bridge and takes us on a tour of
the United States. A clever script
helps hold the details together,
but even a clever script without
backing becomes boring.
I SLEPT at various intervals
after the first hour. It was quite
an experience waking one time in
Disneyland face to face with the
mechanical hippo and the next be
hind the scenes of a strip joint.
The final scenes were aboard
an aircraft carrier in the Atlan
tic. As the jets whisked off the
deck, a chorus of 150 male and
female voices sang alternate
“Ooooo’s’ and “Eeeee's’ in four
part harmony.
The sixth annual San Francisco
Film Festival presents tonight at
8:45 at the Metro theater (Union
and Webkter streets) two pre
miere films, “Waves After
Waves,” an entry from India and

"Three Times Anna,” Argen
tina's entry.
The Festival which began last
Wednesday will run until next
Tuesday. Tickets for the evening
premieres are $2.50 and there
should be no need to call for res
ervations.

A NUMBER of the films in the
Festival are of the quasi-artsy
craft sy category and almost with
out exception display quality
photographic techniques hacked
by mediocre script and sound
track.
The two films scheduled for to
night may not fall into that cate
gory, In fact, they may turn out
to be more than helpful hints in
home movie making.
The Indian entry, “Waves After
Waves,” is a first film for all con
cerned, except the composer,
Ravi Shankar. Each member of
the cast is either an unknown bit
player or a non-actor who has
never been in front of a movie
camera before. Such is the case
for the two leads.
THE SCORE includes a taste of
traditional Indian music which
counterpoints the lyric, the ma
turing years of two young boys
and a girl residing in a small,
tranquil fishing village. The film
had good reviews in India.
The second feature, “Three
Times Anna” from Argentina, is
three separate stories centering
on the love and loneliness of An
na (Maria Vaner).
In the first story, Anna loves
unwisely and loses her child. The
second Anna, an unhappy student
searching for “kicks,” finds only
loneliness. The third, and more

he feels love for her. The slow
agonizing process of the two try
ing to attain a grasp of reality is
artfully rendered, and relief and
thankfulness evoke tears when
the two adolescents simply gain
the ability to communicate with
one another.
The entry from France, “Amer
ica the Unexpected,” is a somno
lent movie. The film is supposed
to catch many small details of
American culture that a French
tourist would see but details the
American considers every-day.
The film does catch many small
details and makes us laugh at our
foibles, but it is entirely too long.
The travel documentary begins
at sun rise on the Golden Gate
bridge and takes us on a tour of
the United States. A clever script
helps hold the details together,
but even a clever script without
backing becomes boring.
I SLEPT at various intervals
after the first hour. It was quite
an experience waking one time in
Disneyland face to face with the
mechanical hippo and the next be
hind the scenes of a strip joint.
The final scenes were aboard
an aircraft carrier in the Atlan
tic. As the jets whisked off the
deck, a chorus of 150 male and
female voices sang alternate
“Ooooo’s’ and “Eeeee's’ in four
part harmony.
The sixth annual San Francisco
Film Festival presents tonight at
8:45 at the Metro theater (Union
and Webkter streets) two pre
miere films, “Waves After
Waves,” an entry from India and

"Three Times Anna,” Argen
tina's entry.
The Festival which began last
Wednesday will run until next
Tuesday. Tickets for the evening
premieres are $2.50 and there
should be no need to call for res
ervations.

A NUMBER of the films in the
Festival are of the quasi-artsy
craft sy category and almost with
out exception display quality
photographic techniques hacked
by mediocre script and sound
track.
The two films scheduled for to
night may not fall into that cate
gory, In fact, they may turn out
to be more than helpful hints in
home movie making.
The Indian entry, “Waves After
Waves,” is a first film for all con
cerned, except the composer,
Ravi Shankar. Each member of
the cast is either an unknown bit
player or a non-actor who has
never been in front of a movie
camera before. Such is the case
for the two leads.
THE SCORE includes a taste of
traditional Indian music which
counterpoints the lyric, the ma
turing years of two young boys
and a girl residing in a small,
tranquil fishing village. The film
had good reviews in India.
The second feature, “Three
Times Anna” from Argentina, is
three separate stories centering
on the love and loneliness of An
na (Maria Vaner).
In the first story, Anna loves
unwisely and loses her child. The
second Anna, an unhappy student
searching for “kicks,” finds only
loneliness. The third, and more
intriguing Anna, exists only in
the imagination of a shy intro
verted dreamer.
THE THREE stories, relatively
unconnected as they are, should
be an interesting study in versa
tile acting.
Three films were shown Friday
night, one was of extremely high
quality“ David and Lisa,” the
United Stales entry.
The photography is not excep
tional nor is the script a slice of
life satiated with hidden inner
message. The movie is simply a
well told story of two emotion
ally disturbed teenagers who un
knowingly assist each other to
gain a grasp of life.
THE FILM is well cast with
Keir Dullea as David and Janet
Margolin as Lisa.
The action takes place in a
school for retarded children. Da
vid, an unemotional machine, is
afraid of feeling any inward com
passion for anything and abhors
displays of emotion. David’s ill
ness is manifested in a fear that
he will die if anyone touches him.
Lisa, in apposition, is irration
ally emotional, but (the film was
not produced in Hollywood) she
is not a nymphomaniac. When
Lisa is Lisa, all the time she
speaks in rhyme, all the time in
rhyme. When she is Murial, she
communicates by writing mes
sages in childish scrawl on a
large tablet.
GRADUALLY and painfully,
Lisa begins to trust David, and
he feels love for her. The slow
