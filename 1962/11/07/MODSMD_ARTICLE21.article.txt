# STAFF OPINION
## Overnight Restrictions Should Be Rejected 
### WILLIAM REPPY Associate Editor 
Here’s an idea to solve the prob
lems concerning regulation of
overnights at Stanford.
Although the committee which
drafted the proposed restrictions
now before LASSU surely gave
the matter a great deal of
thought, a simple yet foolproof
solution to the problem of regu
lating overnights was overlooked.
Why not require that all Stan
ford women attending overnight
parties be equipped with chastity
belts? After a girl is locked in,
the key could be placed in an in
violable place like the ASSU
vault. Only upon her safe return
from the party would the appara
tus be unlocked.
Certainly the overnight restric
tions proposed by the student
faculty committee contain a glar
ing flaw. They demand “locks on
the doors and windows’’ at over
night facilities, but this is obvi
ously not enough. Lecherous
Stanford men won’t be turned
away unless the windows are
equipped with bars or unbreak
able glass.
SERIOUSLY, however, we feel
that adoption by LASSU of the
stringent restrictions on over
nights proposed by the commit
tee would be a grievous mistake.
It would be an outright denial
of social freedom, and this seems
quite incompatible with Stan
ford’s vigorous promotion of in
tellectual and academic freedom.
What a foolish paradox we'd
have at Stanford. We can bring
communist lecturers to campus
because we trust our students to
judge speakers on their merits.
But, we don’t trust our women to
decide for themselves what kind
of social functions they will at
tend.
Arc we intellectually adults
and socially infants?

SUCH RESTRICTIONS on so
dal activities are not even neces
sary. Guides for conduct have al
ready been set up in Stanford’s
traditional Fundamental Stand
ard.

The adoption of these new over
night restrictions would be a
clear admission that the Funda
mental Standard at Stanford is
dead.
If Fun Stan is truly forgotten
or ignored, then legislation far
more encompassing than mere
limitation on overnight parties is
badly needed,
THE LANGUAGE of the com
mittee recommendations implies
that overnight parties are now
merely disgusting sex orgies.
Most of us have probably heard
shady rumors about overnights.
However, conclusive evidence of
wide-spread degeneracy at over
nights should be offered to the
student body for its consideration
before LASSU passes legislation
crippling the planning of social
events by living groups.
THE PROPOSED restrictions
would definitely cripple the plan
ning of overnights. Many living
groups would be forced to aban
don their favorite spots tradi
tional party locations. The rule
that “facilities should be in a
community and in no way iso
lated” eliminates Carmel Valley,
Lake Tahoe, Big Sur, Russian
River, and many other delightful
localities.
It takes a highly fertile imagi
nation to conclude that these
spots inherently lead to sin.
Once a place is found, these
proposed rules will in no way
stop a Stanford couple that wants
to sleep together from doing so.
To do that would require the as
signing to each couple a Univer
sity proctor who would keep
them continually under surveil
lance.
STUDENTS might react to
these overnight rules as America
reacted to prohibition—with in
creased deceit.
Women could get to overnight
parties by signing out for an
overnight weekend in care of one
of the adult hostesses. Technical
ly she would be staying with the
hostess, and the procedure would
bo strictly legal.
Men’s residences would be
tempted lo have overnights at
which all girls attending were
from schools other than Stan
ford—San Jose State, Mills, Cal,
etc. The University has not at
tempted to control functions
which don’t involve its women.
BY EAR THE most galling as
pect of the proposed restrictions
is the insult slung at Stanford
women. Evidently, the student
faculty committee which came up
with the proposal believes the
women arc unable to take care of
themselves.
Our women aren't fools. Those
who have doubts about over
nights ought not to attend them.
Those who do go should have
dates that they trust. To impose
Big Brotherism on Stanford
women is to deny them freedom
of choice.
If you agree that Stanford
women are mature enough to
make their own social decisions;
that the proposed rules cannot
achieve their goals of completely
eliminating sex at overnights;
that social freedom at a Univer
sity should be protected as vig
orously as intellectual and aca
demic freedoms; and that the
Fundamental Standard is not
dead at Stanford—let your feel
ing be known to your LASSU
representative.
If the student body is clearly
against the scheme, Legislature
will have no alternative but to
reject the anti-overnight bill, de
spite any pressures from other
sources, despite threats that all
overnights will be abolished if the
measure isn’t approved.
Its defeat will vindicate student
government at Stanford.
