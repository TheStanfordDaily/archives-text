# Stanford Leads in Pass Defense but SC Dominates AAWU
## 
### 
Stanford grabbed the AAWU
lead in passing defense from
UCLA this week, in the only
change in the league leaders from
last week. Powerful USC still
heads scoring defense, total de
fense, total offense, and rushing
defense. Washington maintained
a lead in rushing offense, and Cal
remained the league’s top passing
threat.
Stanford’s total defense is still
the best in the league, allowing
240 yards per game. Cal’s is the
worst, a generous 349 yards pet
game. The USC offense is grind
ing out yardage at a workman
like 321 yards per game clip.
Washington’s strong running at
tack has netted 231 yards pet
game on the ground for the Hus
kies, although the Seattle passing
attack is the worst in the league,
51 yards per game. Stanford is
the only team in the AAWU
which has not yet passed for a
touchdown.
The Stanford defensive unit al
lowed Oregon only 79 yards
through the air, although it must
be admitted that the Ducks didn’t
really have to pass. The Indians
are now allowing 87 yards per
game via passes, this against
some of the best collegiate pass
ers in the country.
On the strength of their ground

game, Jim Owen’s Huskies are
still holding down second place in
total offense, with 282 yards per
game. Cal is third, mainly on the
resurgence of the Bear passing
attack since the advent of sopho
more sensation Craig Morton.
Stanford’s total offense is lowest
in the league, 240 yards per game,
despite junior Steve Thurlow’s
holding down second position in
individual total offense.

Stanford grabbed the AAWU
lead in passing defense from
UCLA this week, in the only
change in the league leaders from
last week. Powerful USC still
heads scoring defense, total de
fense, total offense, and rushing
defense. Washington maintained
a lead in rushing offense, and Cal
remained the league’s top passing
threat.
Stanford’s total defense is still
the best in the league, allowing
240 yards per game. Cal’s is the
worst, a generous 349 yards pet
game. The USC offense is grind
ing out yardage at a workman
like 321 yards per game clip.
Washington’s strong running at
tack has netted 231 yards pet
game on the ground for the Hus
kies, although the Seattle passing
attack is the worst in the league,
51 yards per game. Stanford is
the only team in the AAWU
which has not yet passed for a
touchdown.
The Stanford defensive unit al
lowed Oregon only 79 yards
through the air, although it must
be admitted that the Ducks didn’t
really have to pass. The Indians
are now allowing 87 yards per
game via passes, this against
some of the best collegiate pass
ers in the country.
On the strength of their ground

game, Jim Owen’s Huskies are
still holding down second place in
total offense, with 282 yards per
game. Cal is third, mainly on the
resurgence of the Bear passing
attack since the advent of sopho
more sensation Craig Morton.
Stanford’s total offense is lowest
in the league, 240 yards per game,
despite junior Steve Thurlow’s
holding down second position in
individual total offense.

change in the league leaders from
last week. Powerful USC still
heads scoring defense, total de
fense, total offense, and rushing
defense. Washington maintained
a lead in rushing offense, and Cal
remained the league’s top passing
threat.
Stanford’s total defense is still
the best in the league, allowing
240 yards per game. Cal’s is the
worst, a generous 349 yards pet
game. The USC offense is grind
ing out yardage at a workman
like 321 yards per game clip.
Washington’s strong running at
tack has netted 231 yards pet
game on the ground for the Hus
kies, although the Seattle passing
attack is the worst in the league,
51 yards per game. Stanford is
the only team in the AAWU
which has not yet passed for a
touchdown.
The Stanford defensive unit al
lowed Oregon only 79 yards
through the air, although it must
be admitted that the Ducks didn’t
really have to pass. The Indians
are now allowing 87 yards per
game via passes, this against
some of the best collegiate pass
ers in the country.
On the strength of their ground

game, Jim Owen’s Huskies are
still holding down second place in
total offense, with 282 yards per
game. Cal is third, mainly on the
resurgence of the Bear passing
attack since the advent of sopho
more sensation Craig Morton.
Stanford’s total offense is lowest
in the league, 240 yards per game,
despite junior Steve Thurlow’s
holding down second position in
individual total offense.
