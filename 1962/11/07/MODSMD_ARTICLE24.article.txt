# Kay's Field Goal Wins for Frosh in Little Big Game
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
j A fourth quarter field goal hy
j Joel Kay, combined with a rugged
defense, led Stanford’s frosh giad
ders to a 3-0 victory over Cal in
the Little Big Game Saturday at
Stanford Stadium.
Most of the contest looked more
like a mass blood-letting than a
I football game. While fumbles
I bounced by and pass interceptions
j flew overhead, the two linos me
' thodically tore each other apart.

In the opening moments of play,
Stanford’s Tom Ross recovered a
Bear fumble on the Indian 37 yard
lino. A long pass from Don Cook
to Alan Oppenheimer moved the
ball to the California 35. Cook
then hit Joe Miller in the end zone
for a seeming touchdown, but the
play was nullified by an offside
penalty against the Cards. Cali
fornia’s defense stiffened, and
Stanford was forced to punt.
WITH MINUTES remaining in
the first period, the Cards drove
to Cal’s 2(1 yard line, hut again a
penalty, this time for holding,
stifled the scoring threat. With a
first down and 27 yards to go,
Cook’s pass was intercepted by
Sinclair.
Seconds later the Bears return
ed the favor by fumbling on their
own 12, Ross again recovering for
the Cards. Two completions by
Mike Connelly brought the hall to
Cal’s 21, but Don Cook's second
intercepted pass of the game turn
ed the ball back over to California.
Paced by the passing combine
tion of Jim Hunt to Don Mosher,
Cal then marched steadily to the
Indian 33. At this point the pendu
lem swung back in favor of Stan
ford. Big John Mason, a standout
in this game, intercepted Hunt's
pass on the Card 32 and returned
it all the way to Cal’s 21. It ap
peared then Stanford would final
ly break the scoreless lie, but Con
nelly fumbled at the Cal goal line,
muffing another scoring oppor
tunity.

THE TWO TEAMS remained
deadlocked throughout the third
quarter. Late in this period the
Cards finally mounted the only
scoring effort of the afternoon.
Taking the ball at their own 6,
the Indians moved steadily across
the field. Connelly sparked the
drive with timely passes and runs,
the key play coming on his 21
yard run on a third down and 8
yards to go play. The drive was
stopped at the 4, but Kay’s field
goal was enough to insure vic
tory.

The Bears were not yet through
for the afternoon. With 2 minutes
remaining in the game and the
ball on their own 20, Hunt and

Mosher combined in a desperate
bid to salvage the win. Two
straight passes from Hunt to
Mosher moved the ball to the In
dian 32. Two plays later, Hunt
again found his favorite target at
the Stanford 25. Another pass to
the hard working half hack put
the hall on (he Card 7, hut Hunt
overshot the exhausted Mosher in
the end zone as the gun sounded.
STANFORD'S offensive was led
by Connelly, who passed and ran
effectively, and Bob Stoecker,
who sparked the ground game.
Defense standouts included Ma
son, Lowell Wilson, who led the
(earn in tackles, and Tom Ho
bosky.
The victory left Stanford with
a 3 wins and 1 defeat record for
the season. California won one of
their three tilts this year.
