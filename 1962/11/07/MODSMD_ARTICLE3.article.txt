The benefit from the National
Student Association for Stanford
| will be realized only if the work
lis carried out by the students,
i said Fred Goff, Stanford NSA co
{ordinator, last night in Tresidder.
“The work and benefits can not
be imported from the national of
fices, but must be implemented
here,” he said.
Goff also emphasized that
while student action is good, it is
not always possible. “Student in
volvement in the form of ac
quaintance and expression is,
however, possible,” he said.
ONE EXAMPLE of student ac
tion that has already been start-
I od is the South West Africa Com
j mittee, under the HR, which is
| working with the NSA to estab-
I lish scholarships and placement
j for South African and South
'West African students in the
United States.
j Goff noted that the Communist
i countries are spending large
j amounts of money with scholar-
I ships and propaganda to influ
ence the students of the world
and particularly of (he underde
veloped nations.
The first thing that the stu
dents at Stanford can do to help
to counteract the Communist in
fluence is to become informed of
the international student activi
ties. Projects can then bo initiat
ed on campus with the help of
NSA. to support those student
groups in favor of the U.S., and
help combat the actions of those
groups opposed to the U.S. poli
cies.
