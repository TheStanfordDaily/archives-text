### 
United Press International
WASHINGTON—Russian diplomats are hedging somewhat on
whether the Soviet Union will withdraw from Cuba let bombers
capable of carrying nuclear warheads, U.S. officials said yesterday.
The 20 or more Soviet Ilushin-28 bombers have become a pos
sible sticky point in negotiations for removal of threatening weapons
from Fidel Castro’s island nation. Officials said special U.S. nego
tiator John J. McCloy had confronted Vasily V. Kuznetsov, Premier
Nikita Khrushchev’s personal representative in New York, with the
fact that U.S. aerial reconnaissance showed no evidence that the
bombers were being re-crated for shipment back to he Soviet Union.
Kuznetsov’s reply was vague, officials said.
But more IL-28s than had been observed previously have been
spotted recently on the ground. A U.S. official said this probably
meant some planes had previously been camouflaged.
U.N. CENSURES SOUTH AFRICA —UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The
United Nations General Assembly yesterday censured South Africa
for racial discrimination and recommended its isolation from the
world community, a move that would mean a rupture of diplomatic
relations and a trade embargo.
But South Africa stood firm. South African Foreign Minister
Eric H. Louw told the assembly, “we know we are acting in the in
terests of the bantu native and other non-white population of our
country.” He said nothing about South Africa leaving the U.N. as
had been predicted in some quarters.
It was the first time in U.N. history that the General Assembly
moved to outlaw a member. The General Assembly voted 67 to 16,
with 23 abstentions, for the Afro-Asian measure. '
