## Mixed Results End Governors Races 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI (—Three
GOP presidential possibilities
Gov. Nelson A, Rockefeller, Wil
liam W. Scranton and George
Romney won governorship vic
tories last night. Their victories
came as the Republicans wrested
five major statehouses from
Democratic control.
But the Democrats countered
by capturing the statehouses of
California, New Hampshire, Ver
mont, New Mexico, Massachu
setts, and Wisconsin.
Rockefeller' won reelection in
New York by a less-than-predict
ed margin over Democratic new
comer Robert M. Morgenthau in
a showing that could affect any
bid for the presidency.
Scranton, a 45-year-old one
term House member, won the
Pennsylvania governorship with
an impressive victory over veter
an Democrat Richardson Dil
worth, former Philadelphia may
or, while Romney unseated Dem
ocratic Gov. John B. Swainson in
Michigan after trailing in the
early returns.
The GOP also picked up the
Democratic-held statehouses in
Ohio, Oklahoma and Colorado.
The Democrats retained con
trol of Congress by wide margins
early today—but still undecided
races held the key as to whether
the new House would be more or
less friendly to President Ken
nedy.
The Democrats, who had led in
the critical House race all night,
nailed down control of the cham
ber at midnight PST. The Demo
crats were favored to win enough
undecided seats to maintain their
present House strength of 263
seats. This feat has not been du
plicated since the 1934 mid-term
election of Franklin 'D. Roose
velt’s first term. Major upsets
were scored in the following
races.
In the Senate, James Martin
became the first Republican since
Reconstruction to be elected
Senator from Alabama. Gov.
Gaylord Nelson (Dem) defeated
24-year veteran incumbent Alex
ander Wiley I Rep) in Wisconsin.
Another major upset hung in the
balance as Indiana voted the
Democratic challenger Birch
Bayh into a very tight race with
three-term Republican Plomer
Capehart.
Other Senators won easy elec
tion. They were: Democrats Carl
I Hayden (Ariz.), William Ful
i bright (Ark.), Frank Lausche
1 (Ohio), Ted Kennedy (Mass.),
Abraham Ribicoff (Conn.), and
Republicans Everett Dirksen
(111.). Thurston Morton (Ken.),
George Aiken (Vermont), and
Jacob Javits (N.Y.).
In the House, the defeat of
Walter Judd (Rep) of Minnesota
and Democratic novelist James
Michner of Pennsylvania were
the main upsets of the night.
