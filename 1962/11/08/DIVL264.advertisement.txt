...still a mysterious concept to science. Time is only an idea,
an abstraction...an area of shadow, speculation—and surprise.
Once our master timekeeper-EARTH-IS RUNNING DOWN! Friction from
ocean tides is almost imperceptibly, but definitely, slowing the earth’s
rotation, gradually disqualifying the turning globe as our most accurate
time measure. Science has already devised more dependable timing devices.

OYSTER TIME. TIDAL TELEPATHY?
An Atlantic Ocean oyster will con
tinue to open up for feeding ac
