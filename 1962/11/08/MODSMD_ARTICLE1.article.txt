# Defeated Nixon Prepares Long Political Holiday
## 
### 
Governor Edmund G. Brown
knocked Richard M. Nixon
through the political ropes
Wednesday and the former vice
president surrendered his role as
active leader of the Republican

Party.
The former vice president con
ceded defeat hy Brown after trail
ing from the start in a race that
apparently sealed his doom as a
future national political figure,
Nixon, who had never before
lost an election in California, said
grimly yesterday that he planned
a long holiday from politics as a
result of his defeat.
IN WHAT HJE termed “my last
press conference” at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel, Nixon aired his ob
jections to many things in the
campaign the attitude of victor
ious incumbent Brown, the press
coverage, and the intervention of
the Federal Communications Com
mission.

Gov. Brown, in a jovial victory
mood, declined yesterday to make
any public comment on Nixon’s
appraisal of Tuesday’s election.
Brown, the first Democrat gover
nor to win re-election in California
history, told a press conference at
his Los Angeles home:
“I’m not going to make any
statement on Mr. Nixon’s post
mortem. I will not indulge in such
things. Mr. Nixon has his opinions
and I have mine.’’
THE GOVERNOR said he felt
ho won re-election because he “dis
cussed issues’’ and stood on his
record of advances in water proj
ects, education and highways.
Rep. Charles Gubser defeated
Democrat James Thurber 3-2 in
yesterday’s local race for Con
gress. Thurber said today that
he was not particularly surprised
at his defeat to incumbent Gubser.
The Cuban crisis combined with
his opponent’s membership on the
Armed Services Committee hurt
the Thurber campaign more than
any other issue, the young Stan
ford graduate commented.
