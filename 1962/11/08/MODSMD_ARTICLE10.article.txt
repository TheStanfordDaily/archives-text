# By-Laws Committee Reviews Overnights
## 
### 
After hearing the opinions of students from various living
groups, the By-laws Committee of Legislature on Tuesday eve
ning reincorporated most of the recommendations of the Student
Affairs Committee into the overnight amendment passed by
LASSU two weeks ago. The Committee, pending approval by

Legislature, eliminated the “isola -t
tion” clause from the accommo
dations section, toned down the
requirement that the President
and Social Chairman assume in
dividual responsibility for the
group, and added a number of
requirements for formal approval
of overnights.
THE COMMITTEE recom
mended the following changes in
the recently passed By-law
amendment; (changes are in
bold face).
• The section on adult guests
was modified to read: “At least
two suitable couples shall be re
quired as adult guests ... It is
expected that the adult guests
will enter into the parly and be
available throughout the party.
THE ADULT GUESTS, which
may be RA’s, are the official
chaperones of the overnight. The
bold-faced addition was made to
insure that the adult guests
would remain on the premises
during an overnight.
• A section on accommoda
tions, which LASSU struck from
the original proposal, was added:
“The accommodations should be
adequate for housing men and
women separately and should
have adequate facilities to allow
the planned program. There
should be a high standard of
cleanliness, adequate lighting
both inside and outside, locks on
the doors and windows and a tele
phone available. Special cases,
such as overnights planned out

by the Special ASSU Conunittee
«n Overnights."
This section is essentially a re
statement of section C in the
AWS regulations on overnight
policy. The last sentence was add
ed to allow for legitimate over
night requests which for special
reasons cannot satisfy the above
listed accommodations require
ments.
• THE SECTION of Formal
Approval was changed consider
ably.
The following sentence was de
leted: “This committee (on over
nights) shall insure that the
President and Social Chairman of
an organizing group are explicit
ly Instructed that they do not
merely share in group r<*iponsi
bility for the good conduct of the
party, hut liear individual respon
[ sibility also.’’
SEVERAL additions were also
[made: “In keeping with the spirit
[and policy governing overnight
j parties, approval for a party
I shall be withheld unless:
a. More than half the member
ship or twenty members of the
sponsoring organization, which-
I ever is less, sign up for the party.
Subsequent failure of the mini
mum number to attend the party
may constitute grounds for re
voking overnight privileges, ex
i cept as provided in Section 6, be
low.” This section was added so
that a minority of the sponsoring
group could not, by their actions,
implicate the entire group, or
make the entire group responsi
ble in absentia for the actions of
a few members.
“d. The President and Social
Chairman of an organizing group
provide assurance that the above
conditions have been met.
| e. That the President and So
cial Chairman of an organizing
group sign the following:
| “ ‘As President and Social
Chairman of , we certify
! to the ASSU Vice President and
| the Dean of Students that the fol
lowing conditions will be met on
lour overnight function:
1, 2, 3, 4, (Sections sa, sb, sc,
sd).
j 5. Tile group accepts responsi
bility for physical damage done
by any member of the group,
their dates, or any other male
I guests, and will make reparation
j payments for this damage’.’’
1 SECTION 11 was reworded to
j read: “Small groups not fulfilling
the numerical requirements of 5a
above, ami wishing to make plans
for overnight parties shall carry
j out the above policy in so far as
il is applicable. Living groups or
| ASSU groups maintaining funds
on deposit with the Student's Or
jganization Fund may appropriate
these funds for the use of small
{groups of that organization, not
{complying with sa, above, with
out incurring responsibility in
(heir capacity as a house or or-
I ganization.”
i IT WAS pointed out by the By
laws Committee that the Special
ASSU Committee on Overnights,
under the direction of the ASSU
Vice President, would be respon
sible for determining w'hal por
tions of the By laws would be
“applicable” for a particular
| small group.

groups, the By-laws Committee of Legislature on Tuesday eve
ning reincorporated most of the recommendations of the Student
Affairs Committee into the overnight amendment passed by
LASSU two weeks ago. The Committee, pending approval by

Legislature, eliminated the “isola -t
tion” clause from the accommo
dations section, toned down the
requirement that the President
and Social Chairman assume in
dividual responsibility for the
group, and added a number of
requirements for formal approval
of overnights.
THE COMMITTEE recom
mended the following changes in
the recently passed By-law
amendment; (changes are in
bold face).
• The section on adult guests
was modified to read: “At least
two suitable couples shall be re
quired as adult guests ... It is
expected that the adult guests
will enter into the parly and be
available throughout the party.
THE ADULT GUESTS, which
may be RA’s, are the official
chaperones of the overnight. The
bold-faced addition was made to
insure that the adult guests
would remain on the premises
during an overnight.
• A section on accommoda
tions, which LASSU struck from
the original proposal, was added:
“The accommodations should be
adequate for housing men and
women separately and should
have adequate facilities to allow
the planned program. There
should be a high standard of
cleanliness, adequate lighting
both inside and outside, locks on
the doors and windows and a tele
phone available. Special cases,
such as overnights planned out

by the Special ASSU Conunittee
«n Overnights."
This section is essentially a re
statement of section C in the
AWS regulations on overnight
policy. The last sentence was add
ed to allow for legitimate over
night requests which for special
reasons cannot satisfy the above
listed accommodations require
ments.
• THE SECTION of Formal
Approval was changed consider
ably.
The following sentence was de
leted: “This committee (on over
nights) shall insure that the
President and Social Chairman of
an organizing group are explicit
ly Instructed that they do not
merely share in group r<*iponsi
bility for the good conduct of the
party, hut liear individual respon
[ sibility also.’’
SEVERAL additions were also
[made: “In keeping with the spirit
[and policy governing overnight
j parties, approval for a party
I shall be withheld unless:
a. More than half the member
ship or twenty members of the
sponsoring organization, which-
I ever is less, sign up for the party.
Subsequent failure of the mini
mum number to attend the party
may constitute grounds for re
voking overnight privileges, ex
i cept as provided in Section 6, be
low.” This section was added so
that a minority of the sponsoring
group could not, by their actions,
implicate the entire group, or
make the entire group responsi
ble in absentia for the actions of
a few members.
“d. The President and Social
Chairman of an organizing group
provide assurance that the above
conditions have been met.
| e. That the President and So
cial Chairman of an organizing
group sign the following:
| “ ‘As President and Social
Chairman of , we certify
! to the ASSU Vice President and
| the Dean of Students that the fol
lowing conditions will be met on
lour overnight function:
1, 2, 3, 4, (Sections sa, sb, sc,
sd).
j 5. Tile group accepts responsi
bility for physical damage done
by any member of the group,
their dates, or any other male
I guests, and will make reparation
j payments for this damage’.’’
1 SECTION 11 was reworded to
j read: “Small groups not fulfilling
the numerical requirements of 5a
above, ami wishing to make plans
for overnight parties shall carry
j out the above policy in so far as
il is applicable. Living groups or
| ASSU groups maintaining funds
on deposit with the Student's Or
jganization Fund may appropriate
these funds for the use of small
{groups of that organization, not
{complying with sa, above, with
out incurring responsibility in
(heir capacity as a house or or-
I ganization.”
i IT WAS pointed out by the By
laws Committee that the Special
ASSU Committee on Overnights,
under the direction of the ASSU
Vice President, would be respon
sible for determining w'hal por

ning reincorporated most of the recommendations of the Student
Affairs Committee into the overnight amendment passed by
LASSU two weeks ago. The Committee, pending approval by

Legislature, eliminated the “isola -t
tion” clause from the accommo
dations section, toned down the
requirement that the President
and Social Chairman assume in
dividual responsibility for the
group, and added a number of
requirements for formal approval
of overnights.
THE COMMITTEE recom
mended the following changes in
the recently passed By-law
amendment; (changes are in
bold face).
• The section on adult guests
was modified to read: “At least
two suitable couples shall be re
quired as adult guests ... It is
expected that the adult guests
will enter into the parly and be
available throughout the party.
THE ADULT GUESTS, which
may be RA’s, are the official
chaperones of the overnight. The
bold-faced addition was made to
insure that the adult guests
would remain on the premises
during an overnight.
• A section on accommoda
tions, which LASSU struck from
the original proposal, was added:
“The accommodations should be
adequate for housing men and
women separately and should
have adequate facilities to allow
the planned program. There
should be a high standard of
cleanliness, adequate lighting
both inside and outside, locks on
the doors and windows and a tele
phone available. Special cases,
such as overnights planned out

by the Special ASSU Conunittee
«n Overnights."
This section is essentially a re
statement of section C in the
AWS regulations on overnight
policy. The last sentence was add
ed to allow for legitimate over
night requests which for special
reasons cannot satisfy the above
listed accommodations require
ments.
• THE SECTION of Formal
Approval was changed consider
ably.
The following sentence was de
leted: “This committee (on over
nights) shall insure that the
President and Social Chairman of
an organizing group are explicit
ly Instructed that they do not
merely share in group r<*iponsi
bility for the good conduct of the
party, hut liear individual respon
[ sibility also.’’
SEVERAL additions were also
[made: “In keeping with the spirit
[and policy governing overnight
j parties, approval for a party
I shall be withheld unless:
a. More than half the member
ship or twenty members of the
sponsoring organization, which-
I ever is less, sign up for the party.
Subsequent failure of the mini
mum number to attend the party
may constitute grounds for re
voking overnight privileges, ex
i cept as provided in Section 6, be
low.” This section was added so
that a minority of the sponsoring
group could not, by their actions,
implicate the entire group, or
make the entire group responsi
ble in absentia for the actions of
a few members.
“d. The President and Social
Chairman of an organizing group
provide assurance that the above
conditions have been met.
| e. That the President and So
cial Chairman of an organizing
group sign the following:
| “ ‘As President and Social
Chairman of , we certify
! to the ASSU Vice President and
| the Dean of Students that the fol
lowing conditions will be met on
lour overnight function:
1, 2, 3, 4, (Sections sa, sb, sc,
sd).
j 5. Tile group accepts responsi
bility for physical damage done
by any member of the group,
their dates, or any other male
I guests, and will make reparation
j payments for this damage’.’’
1 SECTION 11 was reworded to
j read: “Small groups not fulfilling
the numerical requirements of 5a
above, ami wishing to make plans
for overnight parties shall carry
j out the above policy in so far as
il is applicable. Living groups or
| ASSU groups maintaining funds
on deposit with the Student's Or
jganization Fund may appropriate
these funds for the use of small
{groups of that organization, not
{complying with sa, above, with
out incurring responsibility in
(heir capacity as a house or or-
I ganization.”
i IT WAS pointed out by the By
laws Committee that the Special
ASSU Committee on Overnights,
under the direction of the ASSU
Vice President, would be respon
sible for determining w'hal por
tions of the By laws would be
“applicable” for a particular
| small group.
