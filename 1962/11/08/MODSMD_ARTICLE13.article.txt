# Administrative Panel
## 
### 
Frequently in the past, misunderstandings between the Uni
versity and the student body have been attributed to “a failure of
communication.” This explanation is to a degree accurate, and
with this failure in mind Stanford Today and Tomorrow is spon
soring a panel discussion between high-ranking University admin
istrators this afternoon.
To the extent that students misunderstand the complexities of
University administration, this panel will clear up those misunder
standings. But the discussion will not, of course, succeed in
forging agreement where there is substantive disagreement be
tween students and administration. If students interpret the ban
on “partisan political activity” differently from the University,
then this panel will not manufacture unanimity. But there is no
intention on the part of Stanford Today and Tomorrow to create
by the panel discussion agreement where there is divergence.
Their intent is merely to detail the complexities of making policy.
Messrs. Brandin, Cuthbertson, Clover, and Wert will not, how
ever, restrict their discussion to the complexities of decision-mak
ing: they will discuss substantive problems such as the dictates
of the Founding Grant, long-range academic planning, and the
University’s need for funds beyond those provided by tuition.
With the PACE fund drive taking up so much time, it is ex
traordinary that so many administrators are available to speak
directly to students about University policy. The fact that an
extra 20 minutes will he devoted to answering questions from
the floor should provide an opportunity unavailable to students
iu the past. Hopefully, the panel idea is not an isolated program
but is part of a regular format that may be used frequently in
the future.
