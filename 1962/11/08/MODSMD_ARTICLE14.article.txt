# RECORD REVIEW
## Theodore Bikel, Josh White Sing In 'The Folk Scene' 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
The easiest and most pleasant
way to become acquainted with
the broad spectrum of folk music
is byway of one of the many
“folk samplers” being released
by record companies today. The
most recent sampler, Electra
Records’ “The Folk Scene” (SMP
-6), exhibits a wide range of sing
ers, modes, and moods.
The folk sampler is the record
industry’s answer to the publish
ing house’s short-story or play
anthology. It is a collection of the
best bands on each of several
records in the company’s regular
catalogue, and thus can usually
be sold at two dollars. The sam
pler is good advertising for the
record company, and a safe be
ginning for the newcomer to folk
music, who may be wary of buy
ing a whole album by a single un
familiar performer.

Electra Records has hitherto
released three other samplers,
"Folk Festival" (SMP-2), “Folk,
Jazz, and Pop Festival” (SMP-3),
and “Folk Sampler Five.” (SMP
-5). “Folk Sampler Five” seems
the most consistently excellent
of the series, better even than
the present album. But “The
Folk Scene” represents a new
reaching out to include and popu
larize less familiar but equally
valuable singers who record for
Electra.

“The Folk Scene" includes such
Electra regulars as Theodore Bi
kel, Josh White, and Cynthia
Gooding. At the same time it in
troduces the Pennsylvania balla
deer Ed McCurdy with his ver
sion of “Gypsy Laddie,” Sandy
Paton with his moving “Daily
Growing,” and Jack Elliott’s
quietly satirical “Talking Dust
Bowl.” As an innovation the pres
ent album includes premiere re
cordings of Oscar Brand's “Squid
Jiggin’ Ground” and the Lime
lighters’ “Greenland Fisheries."
On one of the most successful
bands, Bob Gibson sings his stir
ring version of “Gilgerry Moun
tain.” To balance the whole al
bum, two banjoists execute an
adroit breakdown in “Flopeared
Mule.”
