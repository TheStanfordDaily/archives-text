Editor, The Daily:
Your critique of the Stanford
Players’ production of “Macbeth”
apparently reflects a considerable
segment of opinion. However,
there are those of us who came
away with more favorable im
pressions; and I feel it is only
fair—both to potential theatre
goers and especially to the peo
ple who worked so hard and long
on the production—that our side
be vocal.
I would like to assure Theo
dore Hoffman and company that
they succeeded preeminently in
their struggle to be different.
Never before have I seen such
original creativeness in an ama
teur stage production.
As the curtain rose, the scene
ry proved not only impressive,
but indeed marvellous. In retro
spect. it is difficult to understand
how such simple and modernistic
props created such a colorfully
real atmosphere. The black-outs
used to shift scenery were rela
tively short; at any rate, the new
scenery was worth waiting for.
The pacing of the play ate up
three hours almost before I knew
they were gone. The ingenious
technique of merely dimming
lights between scenes to indicate
passage of time really kept
things going. And the increased
pace near the end, involving
many crossings and recrossings
of characters on the stage, effec
tively imparted the bustle of
battle.
Best of all, however, were the
character interpretations: none
of the ranting and raving so char
acteristic of amateur renditions
of Shakespeare, just relatively
good acting. True, Steve Gilborn
did underplay some of Macbeth’s
lines; but he was generally very
convincing: and his “Tomorrow
and tomorrow and tomorrow” so
liloquy was one of the very high
est points of the play—the de
spair and infinite weariness of
the bloody Macbeth were perfect
ly portrayed.
Ellen (Lady Macbeth) Headly
gave a surprising femininity to
her part, a femininity which, 1
become more and more certain,
is most appropriate to Lady Mac
beth. The sleep-walking scene
and the scene wherein she con
spires to do away with the noble
Duncan are memorable.
Among the rest of the cast, the
witches, Macduff, and Banquo
stood out. With very few excep
tions, supporting parts were well
played.

Your critique of the Stanford
Players’ production of “Macbeth”
apparently reflects a considerable
segment of opinion. However,
there are those of us who came
away with more favorable im
pressions; and I feel it is only
fair—both to potential theatre
goers and especially to the peo
ple who worked so hard and long
on the production—that our side
be vocal.
I would like to assure Theo
dore Hoffman and company that
they succeeded preeminently in
their struggle to be different.
Never before have I seen such
original creativeness in an ama
teur stage production.
As the curtain rose, the scene
ry proved not only impressive,
but indeed marvellous. In retro
spect. it is difficult to understand
how such simple and modernistic
props created such a colorfully
real atmosphere. The black-outs
used to shift scenery were rela
tively short; at any rate, the new
scenery was worth waiting for.
The pacing of the play ate up
three hours almost before I knew
they were gone. The ingenious
technique of merely dimming
lights between scenes to indicate
passage of time really kept
things going. And the increased
pace near the end, involving
many crossings and recrossings
of characters on the stage, effec
tively imparted the bustle of
battle.
Best of all, however, were the
character interpretations: none
of the ranting and raving so char
acteristic of amateur renditions
of Shakespeare, just relatively
good acting. True, Steve Gilborn
did underplay some of Macbeth’s
lines; but he was generally very
convincing: and his “Tomorrow
and tomorrow and tomorrow” so
liloquy was one of the very high
est points of the play—the de
spair and infinite weariness of
the bloody Macbeth were perfect
ly portrayed.
Ellen (Lady Macbeth) Headly
gave a surprising femininity to
her part, a femininity which, 1
become more and more certain,
is most appropriate to Lady Mac
beth. The sleep-walking scene
and the scene wherein she con
spires to do away with the noble
Duncan are memorable.
Among the rest of the cast, the
witches, Macduff, and Banquo
stood out. With very few excep
tions, supporting parts were well
played.
