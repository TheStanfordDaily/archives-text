# CAMPUS OPINION
## Overnight' Rules Planned to Protect, Not to Regulate 
### WILLIAM BUTLER amd 
C’HUC’K BISCHOFF
Representatives on the Student
Affairs and Services Committee
Mr. Reppy’s fulminalions yes
terday against the current at
tempt at codification of over
night policy by LASSU, though
slightly amusing, were pro
foundly disturbing in that they
revealed an almost total igno
rance of the purposes of this codi
fication.
Prior to this time, most of the
policies governing overnights
have been unwritten and un
known, leading to a great deal of
misunderstanding and unconsci
ous violation. The major part of
the “new” overnight policy is
nothing more than the formal
statement of what overnight poli
cy has always been.
SEVERAL OF the most impor
tant clauses in the policy are,
however, new. One of the pur
poses of these clauses is to spell
out for the Presidents and Social
Chairmen guidelines which the
ASSU committee will use in ap
proving their overnights. In this
sense, the setting up of specific
rules will ease the responsibility
of these officers, in interpreting
the Fundamental Standard by
telling them more precisely what
their responsibilities - are. Also,
the ASSU overnight registration
committee will be protected from
charges of favoritism, and their
policy will he perpetuated in
years hence.
The complaint that the codifi
cation nullifies the Fundamental
Standard shows a misunderstand
ing of its essential purpose,
which is to amplify and publicize
the meaning of the Fundamental
Standard, not to replace it. It is
not our intention to legislate mor
als. but merely to create a situa
tion in which it is possible for
each individual to make his own
decisions about his own moral
conduct—the very “social free
dom’’ about which Mr. Reppy is
most concerned.
In the past, for example, over
nights have taken place in which
it has not been possible for an in
dividual girl to choose separate
accommodations. No question has
been raised about the ability of
Stanford women to make decis
ions for themselves if they are
given the opportunity to do so.
Furthermore, it is specious reas
oning to suggest that a girl
makes the decision whether she
wishes to accept coeducational
sleeping facilities at the time
when she accepts an invitation
to an overnight from any man,
regardless of how well she knows
him.
CERTAIN OF Mr. Reppy’s
complaints concerning technical
details of the proposed policy,
were valid but already have been
corrected, at the open meeting of
the LASSU By-Laws Committee
Tuesday night (at which he was
conspicuously absent, it may be
noted). Without repeating the
specific changes reported else
where in today’s Daily, it might
be noted that the phrase “the fa
cilities should be in a community
and in no way isolated” have
been dropped.
We regret, however, that the
By-Laws Committee did not vote
to accept perhaps the most imt
portant recommendation of the
Student Affairs Committee:
“This committee shall insure
that the President and Social
Chairman of an organizing
group, or their specifically des
ignated representatives are ex
plicitly instructed that they do
not merely share in group re
sponsibility for the good con
duct of the party but bear in
dividual responsibility and may
be subject to judicial action
over and above any applied to
the group as a whole in the
event of a violation of the Fun
damental Standard if proof of
negligence in taking prevent
ive measures can be shown.”
Both the judicial councils and
the Dean’s Office have always
recognized that the elected offi
cials of any group bear increased
responsibility. In this sense, the
above statement is only a recog
nition of the obvious. The inten
tion of the committee is to give
student leaders an explicit state
ment of this fact with the hope
that they will recognize their re
sponsibility and take increased
preventive measures. The pro
posed policy does not mean that
Presidents or Social Chairmen
will be held responsible for viola
tions of good conduct over which
they can have no control. If a
formal complaint is filed against
a particular living group, it is not
unreasonable for the officers of
that group to be asked what pre
ventive measures they as organ
izers have taken.
MR. RKPPV calls the proposals
a “stringent” “anti-overnight
bill.” We submit that it is rather
a liberal proposal. In the modern
sense of the word, “liberal” in
cludes the idea that at times a
government must act to protect
the individual against the group.
The defeat of the policy far from
“vindicating student government
at Stanford,” would in fact con
stitute a lamentable abdication of
student responsibility.

tion of the committee is to give
student leaders an explicit state
ment of this fact with the hope
that they will recognize their re
sponsibility and take increased
preventive measures. The pro
posed policy does not mean that
Presidents or Social Chairmen
will be held responsible for viola
tions of good conduct over which
they can have no control. If a
formal complaint is filed against
a particular living group, it is not
unreasonable for the officers of
that group to be asked what pre
ventive measures they as organ
izers have taken.
MR. RKPPV calls the proposals
a “stringent” “anti-overnight
bill.” We submit that it is rather
a liberal proposal. In the modern
sense of the word, “liberal” in
cludes the idea that at times a
government must act to protect
the individual against the group.
The defeat of the policy far from
“vindicating student government
at Stanford,” would in fact con
stitute a lamentable abdication of
student responsibility.

Representatives on the Student
Affairs and Services Committee
Mr. Reppy’s fulminalions yes
terday against the current at
tempt at codification of over
night policy by LASSU, though
slightly amusing, were pro
foundly disturbing in that they
revealed an almost total igno
rance of the purposes of this codi
fication.
Prior to this time, most of the
policies governing overnights
have been unwritten and un
known, leading to a great deal of
misunderstanding and unconsci
ous violation. The major part of
the “new” overnight policy is
nothing more than the formal
statement of what overnight poli
cy has always been.
SEVERAL OF the most impor
tant clauses in the policy are,
however, new. One of the pur
poses of these clauses is to spell
out for the Presidents and Social
Chairmen guidelines which the
ASSU committee will use in ap
proving their overnights. In this
sense, the setting up of specific
rules will ease the responsibility
of these officers, in interpreting
the Fundamental Standard by
telling them more precisely what
their responsibilities - are. Also,
the ASSU overnight registration
committee will be protected from
charges of favoritism, and their
policy will he perpetuated in
years hence.
The complaint that the codifi
cation nullifies the Fundamental
Standard shows a misunderstand
ing of its essential purpose,
which is to amplify and publicize
the meaning of the Fundamental
Standard, not to replace it. It is
not our intention to legislate mor
als. but merely to create a situa
tion in which it is possible for
each individual to make his own
decisions about his own moral
conduct—the very “social free
dom’’ about which Mr. Reppy is
most concerned.
In the past, for example, over
nights have taken place in which
it has not been possible for an in
dividual girl to choose separate
accommodations. No question has
been raised about the ability of
Stanford women to make decis
ions for themselves if they are
given the opportunity to do so.
Furthermore, it is specious reas
oning to suggest that a girl
makes the decision whether she
wishes to accept coeducational
sleeping facilities at the time
when she accepts an invitation
to an overnight from any man,
regardless of how well she knows
him.
CERTAIN OF Mr. Reppy’s
complaints concerning technical
details of the proposed policy,
were valid but already have been
corrected, at the open meeting of
the LASSU By-Laws Committee
Tuesday night (at which he was
conspicuously absent, it may be
noted). Without repeating the
specific changes reported else
where in today’s Daily, it might
be noted that the phrase “the fa
cilities should be in a community
and in no way isolated” have
been dropped.
We regret, however, that the
By-Laws Committee did not vote
to accept perhaps the most imt
portant recommendation of the
Student Affairs Committee:
“This committee shall insure
that the President and Social
Chairman of an organizing
group, or their specifically des
ignated representatives are ex
plicitly instructed that they do
not merely share in group re
sponsibility for the good con
duct of the party but bear in
dividual responsibility and may
be subject to judicial action
over and above any applied to
the group as a whole in the
event of a violation of the Fun
damental Standard if proof of
negligence in taking prevent
ive measures can be shown.”
Both the judicial councils and
the Dean’s Office have always
recognized that the elected offi
cials of any group bear increased
responsibility. In this sense, the
above statement is only a recog
nition of the obvious. The inten
tion of the committee is to give
student leaders an explicit state

and in no way isolated” have
been dropped.
We regret, however, that the
By-Laws Committee did not vote
to accept perhaps the most imt
portant recommendation of the
Student Affairs Committee:
“This committee shall insure
that the President and Social
Chairman of an organizing
group, or their specifically des
ignated representatives are ex
plicitly instructed that they do
not merely share in group re
sponsibility for the good con
duct of the party but bear in
dividual responsibility and may
be subject to judicial action
over and above any applied to
the group as a whole in the
event of a violation of the Fun
damental Standard if proof of
negligence in taking prevent
ive measures can be shown.”
Both the judicial councils and
the Dean’s Office have always
recognized that the elected offi
cials of any group bear increased
responsibility. In this sense, the
above statement is only a recog
nition of the obvious. The inten
tion of the committee is to give
student leaders an explicit state
ment of this fact with the hope
that they will recognize their re
sponsibility and take increased
preventive measures. The pro
posed policy does not mean that
Presidents or Social Chairmen
will be held responsible for viola
tions of good conduct over which
they can have no control. If a
formal complaint is filed against
a particular living group, it is not
unreasonable for the officers of
that group to be asked what pre
ventive measures they as organ
izers have taken.
MR. RKPPV calls the proposals
a “stringent” “anti-overnight
bill.” We submit that it is rather
a liberal proposal. In the modern
sense of the word, “liberal” in
cludes the idea that at times a
government must act to protect
the individual against the group.
The defeat of the policy far from
“vindicating student government
at Stanford,” would in fact con
stitute a lamentable abdication of
student responsibility.

Affairs and Services Committee
Mr. Reppy’s fulminalions yes
terday against the current at
tempt at codification of over
night policy by LASSU, though
slightly amusing, were pro
foundly disturbing in that they
revealed an almost total igno
rance of the purposes of this codi
fication.
Prior to this time, most of the
policies governing overnights
have been unwritten and un
known, leading to a great deal of
misunderstanding and unconsci
ous violation. The major part of
the “new” overnight policy is
nothing more than the formal
statement of what overnight poli
cy has always been.
SEVERAL OF the most impor
tant clauses in the policy are,
however, new. One of the pur
poses of these clauses is to spell
out for the Presidents and Social
Chairmen guidelines which the
ASSU committee will use in ap
proving their overnights. In this
sense, the setting up of specific
rules will ease the responsibility
of these officers, in interpreting
the Fundamental Standard by
telling them more precisely what
their responsibilities - are. Also,
the ASSU overnight registration
committee will be protected from
charges of favoritism, and their
policy will he perpetuated in
years hence.
The complaint that the codifi
cation nullifies the Fundamental
Standard shows a misunderstand
ing of its essential purpose,
which is to amplify and publicize
the meaning of the Fundamental
Standard, not to replace it. It is
not our intention to legislate mor
als. but merely to create a situa
tion in which it is possible for
each individual to make his own
decisions about his own moral
conduct—the very “social free
dom’’ about which Mr. Reppy is
most concerned.
In the past, for example, over
nights have taken place in which
it has not been possible for an in
dividual girl to choose separate
accommodations. No question has
been raised about the ability of
Stanford women to make decis
ions for themselves if they are
given the opportunity to do so.
Furthermore, it is specious reas
oning to suggest that a girl
makes the decision whether she
wishes to accept coeducational
sleeping facilities at the time
when she accepts an invitation
to an overnight from any man,
regardless of how well she knows
him.
CERTAIN OF Mr. Reppy’s
complaints concerning technical
details of the proposed policy,
were valid but already have been
corrected, at the open meeting of
the LASSU By-Laws Committee
Tuesday night (at which he was
conspicuously absent, it may be
noted). Without repeating the
specific changes reported else
where in today’s Daily, it might
be noted that the phrase “the fa
cilities should be in a community
and in no way isolated” have
been dropped.
