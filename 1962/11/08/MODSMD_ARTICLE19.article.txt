## Implications of Soviet Retreat In Cuba, India Worldwide 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
We appear to have come to one of those moments in history
when the state of things, which for good or evil, was fairly steady,

is suddenly shaken up. No one can now see better than dimly
what will be the new shape of things.
But we can, though very tentatively, see some of the implica

tions and side effects of the two"
obvious major crises we are now
living through—the one in this
hemisphere around Cuba and the
other in Asia around the invasion
of India.

As for Cuba, though the full
agreement about verification of
the removal of the strategic
weapons is still to be worked out,
there is no doubt that the United
States has the upper hand in this
part of the world. For if Castro
attempts to frustrate the imple

mentation of the
Kennedy-
K hr ushchev
agreement, he
will lay himself
open to heavy
penalties from a
tightened block
ade. The Soviet
Union cannot
now protect him
in his recalcit

ranee. It will not protect him be
cause its own interest is to write
off the Cuban military venture
as fairly as possible. It is dis
mantling its own missiles and it
does not have the naval power to
challenge, even if it wanted to
risk war for Castro, the blockade
of, let us say, oil shipments.
' Castro has been deprived of the
military protection of the Soviet
Union, and if he is to replace it
with some guarantee besides the
promise of the United States not
to invade him, his best course is
to invite the Organization of
American States to make Cuba a
neutralized island which will con
tentrate its attention on its own
internal development.
WHAT IS happening in Cuba
is having far reaching effects not
only in Latin America but, al
most certainly, in Africa and the
Middle East and Asia. Cuba itself
is not very interesting to Afri
cans and Arabs and Asians. But
by conjunction with the Chinese
invasion of India, the effects of
the Cuban affair are compound
ed. Both in Cuba and in India (he
Soviet Union has had to water
down or write off the promises of
support which it had made.
India's foreign policy under
Nehru lias, as he himself has con
fessed, been based on an illusion.
But what was the illusion? Not
(hat the Chinese were too kind to
hurt India: Red China has been
nibbling at the Indian frontier for
five years. The Indian illusion
was that the Soviet Union was
the paramount power in the Com
munist orbit and that it would
and could prevent China from
committing a serious aggression
against India.
It is not, I think, an exaggera
tion to say that these parallel and
coinciding crises in the Americas
and in Asia have reduced dramat
ically the value of the Soviet
guarantee to a distant country.
THIS WILL have great rever
berations in the underdeveloped
and unaligned and newly-liberat
ed nations. They will no longer
have India as their leader and
their spokesman and their exam
ple, for India will no longer be
unaligned.
Not being myself a Kremlin
ologist, I do not know what will
be the effect of the two great
crises on the internal situation of
the Soviet Union. But if we sup
pose that in the crunch the vital
interests of the Soviet Union will
be put ahead of the Communist
ideology, then, so it now appears,
the Soviet Union may be enter
ing upon an internal conflict of
enormous proportions.
The Soviet Union finds itself

contained and blocked in both di
rections. In the West, towards
Europe and the Americas, the nu
clear balance of power is against
her, and her two attempts to close
the gap -by resuming testing and
by planting first-strike missiles
in Cuba—have failed.
IN THE EAST, Red China is
consolidating control of the Ti
betan plateau which threatens
Soviet Siberia. By the blow at In
dia, Red China has dethroned the
Soviet Union in India and shown
that neutralism in Asia will not
be tolerated. Overriding all this
is the prospect that Red China
is growing in strength in spite of
its economic troubles, and that in
the years to come Red China will,
with its vast armies and with nu
clear weapons, threaten the
whole Soviet position from the
Urals to the Pacific.

The crucial question is, it seems
to me, whether the Kremlin will
take a short or a long view of the
situation.

For on the long view, which is
that of the security and well-be
ing of the Soviet people and the
peace of (he world, the true in
terest of Russia is to make peace
in Europe and with the West,
and, to speak indiscreetly, to rec
ognize that the containment of
Red China is becoming much
more important than any other
Soviet interest.

and unaligned and newly-liberat
ed nations. They will no longer
have India as their leader and
their spokesman and their exam
ple, for India will no longer be
unaligned.
Not being myself a Kremlin
ologist, I do not know what will
be the effect of the two great
crises on the internal situation of
the Soviet Union. But if we sup
pose that in the crunch the vital
interests of the Soviet Union will
be put ahead of the Communist
ideology, then, so it now appears,
the Soviet Union may be enter
ing upon an internal conflict of
enormous proportions.
The Soviet Union finds itself

contained and blocked in both di
rections. In the West, towards
Europe and the Americas, the nu
clear balance of power is against
her, and her two attempts to close
the gap -by resuming testing and
by planting first-strike missiles
in Cuba—have failed.
IN THE EAST, Red China is
consolidating control of the Ti
betan plateau which threatens
Soviet Siberia. By the blow at In
dia, Red China has dethroned the
Soviet Union in India and shown
that neutralism in Asia will not
be tolerated. Overriding all this
is the prospect that Red China
is growing in strength in spite of
its economic troubles, and that in
the years to come Red China will,
with its vast armies and with nu
clear weapons, threaten the
whole Soviet position from the
Urals to the Pacific.

The crucial question is, it seems
to me, whether the Kremlin will
take a short or a long view of the
situation.

For on the long view, which is
that of the security and well-be
ing of the Soviet people and the
peace of (he world, the true in
terest of Russia is to make peace
in Europe and with the West,
and, to speak indiscreetly, to rec
ognize that the containment of
Red China is becoming much
more important than any other
Soviet interest.

We appear to have come to one of those moments in history
when the state of things, which for good or evil, was fairly steady,

is suddenly shaken up. No one can now see better than dimly
what will be the new shape of things.
But we can, though very tentatively, see some of the implica

tions and side effects of the two"
obvious major crises we are now
living through—the one in this
hemisphere around Cuba and the
other in Asia around the invasion
of India.

As for Cuba, though the full
agreement about verification of
the removal of the strategic
weapons is still to be worked out,
there is no doubt that the United
States has the upper hand in this
part of the world. For if Castro
attempts to frustrate the imple

mentation of the
Kennedy-
K hr ushchev
agreement, he
will lay himself
open to heavy
penalties from a
tightened block
ade. The Soviet
Union cannot
now protect him
in his recalcit

ranee. It will not protect him be
cause its own interest is to write
off the Cuban military venture
as fairly as possible. It is dis
mantling its own missiles and it
does not have the naval power to
challenge, even if it wanted to
risk war for Castro, the blockade
of, let us say, oil shipments.
' Castro has been deprived of the
military protection of the Soviet
Union, and if he is to replace it
with some guarantee besides the
promise of the United States not
to invade him, his best course is
to invite the Organization of
American States to make Cuba a
neutralized island which will con
tentrate its attention on its own
internal development.
WHAT IS happening in Cuba
is having far reaching effects not
only in Latin America but, al
most certainly, in Africa and the
Middle East and Asia. Cuba itself
is not very interesting to Afri
cans and Arabs and Asians. But
by conjunction with the Chinese
invasion of India, the effects of
the Cuban affair are compound
ed. Both in Cuba and in India (he
Soviet Union has had to water
down or write off the promises of
support which it had made.
India's foreign policy under
Nehru lias, as he himself has con
fessed, been based on an illusion.
But what was the illusion? Not
(hat the Chinese were too kind to
hurt India: Red China has been
nibbling at the Indian frontier for
five years. The Indian illusion
was that the Soviet Union was
the paramount power in the Com
munist orbit and that it would
and could prevent China from
committing a serious aggression
against India.
It is not, I think, an exaggera
tion to say that these parallel and
coinciding crises in the Americas
and in Asia have reduced dramat
ically the value of the Soviet
guarantee to a distant country.

berations in the underdeveloped

ade. The Soviet
Union cannot
now protect him
in his recalcit

ranee. It will not protect him be
cause its own interest is to write
off the Cuban military venture
as fairly as possible. It is dis
mantling its own missiles and it
does not have the naval power to
challenge, even if it wanted to
risk war for Castro, the blockade
of, let us say, oil shipments.
' Castro has been deprived of the
military protection of the Soviet
Union, and if he is to replace it
with some guarantee besides the
promise of the United States not
to invade him, his best course is
to invite the Organization of
American States to make Cuba a
neutralized island which will con
tentrate its attention on its own
internal development.
WHAT IS happening in Cuba
is having far reaching effects not
only in Latin America but, al
most certainly, in Africa and the
Middle East and Asia. Cuba itself
is not very interesting to Afri
cans and Arabs and Asians. But
by conjunction with the Chinese
invasion of India, the effects of
the Cuban affair are compound
ed. Both in Cuba and in India (he
Soviet Union has had to water
down or write off the promises of
support which it had made.
India's foreign policy under
Nehru lias, as he himself has con
fessed, been based on an illusion.
But what was the illusion? Not
(hat the Chinese were too kind to
hurt India: Red China has been
nibbling at the Indian frontier for
five years. The Indian illusion
was that the Soviet Union was
the paramount power in the Com
munist orbit and that it would
and could prevent China from
committing a serious aggression
against India.
It is not, I think, an exaggera
tion to say that these parallel and
coinciding crises in the Americas
and in Asia have reduced dramat
ically the value of the Soviet
guarantee to a distant country.
THIS WILL have great rever
berations in the underdeveloped
and unaligned and newly-liberat
ed nations. They will no longer
have India as their leader and
their spokesman and their exam
ple, for India will no longer be
unaligned.
Not being myself a Kremlin
ologist, I do not know what will
be the effect of the two great
crises on the internal situation of
the Soviet Union. But if we sup
pose that in the crunch the vital
interests of the Soviet Union will
be put ahead of the Communist
ideology, then, so it now appears,
the Soviet Union may be enter
ing upon an internal conflict of
enormous proportions.
The Soviet Union finds itself

contained and blocked in both di
rections. In the West, towards
Europe and the Americas, the nu
clear balance of power is against
her, and her two attempts to close
the gap -by resuming testing and
by planting first-strike missiles
in Cuba—have failed.
IN THE EAST, Red China is
consolidating control of the Ti
betan plateau which threatens
Soviet Siberia. By the blow at In
dia, Red China has dethroned the
Soviet Union in India and shown
that neutralism in Asia will not
be tolerated. Overriding all this
is the prospect that Red China
is growing in strength in spite of
its economic troubles, and that in
the years to come Red China will,
with its vast armies and with nu
clear weapons, threaten the
whole Soviet position from the
Urals to the Pacific.

The crucial question is, it seems
to me, whether the Kremlin will
take a short or a long view of the
situation.

For on the long view, which is
that of the security and well-be
ing of the Soviet people and the
peace of (he world, the true in
terest of Russia is to make peace
in Europe and with the West,
and, to speak indiscreetly, to rec
ognize that the containment of
Red China is becoming much
more important than any other
Soviet interest.

We appear to have come to one of those moments in history
when the state of things, which for good or evil, was fairly steady,

is suddenly shaken up. No one can now see better than dimly
what will be the new shape of things.
But we can, though very tentatively, see some of the implica

tions and side effects of the two"
obvious major crises we are now
living through—the one in this
hemisphere around Cuba and the
other in Asia around the invasion
of India.

As for Cuba, though the full
agreement about verification of
the removal of the strategic
weapons is still to be worked out,
there is no doubt that the United
States has the upper hand in this
part of the world. For if Castro
attempts to frustrate the imple

mentation of the
Kennedy-
K hr ushchev
agreement, he
will lay himself
open to heavy
penalties from a
tightened block
