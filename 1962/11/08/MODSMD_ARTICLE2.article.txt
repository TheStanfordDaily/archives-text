# ST&T to Present University Plans
## 
### 
What are Stanford’s long-range
plans for honors programs? Who
determines the policy of the uni
versity?
These and other pertinent ques
tions about Stanford will be dis
cussed this afternoon by a panel
of Stanford administrators in a
program “Stanford Perspective,”
at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel.
The program is sponsored by
the Stanford Today and Tomor
row Committee whose chairman,
John Frohnmayer, will moderate.
Frohnmayer will pose a series of
prepared questions to members
of the panel.
The purpose of the panel dis
cussion, as stated by Mike Walsh,
Assistant Student-Alumni Coor
dinator, is to “interest a signifi
cant number of students in com
ing out ot ‘meet’ the top people
in the university, and to find out
‘just what the heck they do’.” He
stated further that the panel
would try to answer some of the
questions which are based on mis
understanding or misinformation.
