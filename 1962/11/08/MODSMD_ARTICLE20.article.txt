Editor, The Daily:
Judging from his latest re
sponse, the differences between
Mr. Du Plessis and mo boil down
to two issues, one of which is due
to a misunderstanding by Mr.
Du Plessis of a somewhat care
less phrase in my letter, the
other of a more fundamental na
ture.
First, I assure Mr. Du Plessis
that my characterization of his
article was intended as just that,
and not as a personal attack on
him. The outright inaccuracies in
his article are confined to trivi
alities such as official race termi
nology. I termed the article half
accurate because it attempts to
sketch tremendously complex is
sues in too simple terms. The
platitudinous nature of the article
can be confirmed by looking into
any of the John Gunther-type
journalistic books about South
Africa that have appeared in re
cent years. I did not and do not
imply dishonesty on Mr. Du Ples
sis’ part; I prefer to think that
the shortcomings of his article
were due to space limitations.
Secondly, concerning the future
role of the Progressive Party, my
own view is that it is likely that
South Africa’s problems will be
resolved in the end by negotiation
rather than through the polls.
While their future at the polls
may not be rosy, it is my opinion
that the Progressive program can
provide a useful and realistic ba
sis for such negotiations. This, I
believe, cannot be said of the un
compromising program of the
Liberal Party. If a compromise
can not be arrived at, I agree that
a violent revolution is probably
inevitable. I prefer, however, to
take the optimistic view, and this,
as far as I can judge from his
various remarks, is perhaps the
basic difference between Mr. Du
Plessis’ and my views.
