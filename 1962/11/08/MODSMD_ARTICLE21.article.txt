Now on sale at the Bookstore
is the new Stanford Directory
consisting of two parts, faculty
and staff, and students. Prices for
each are 50 cents..
Included in the Student Direc
tory are class and major classifi
cation, telephone number and lo
cal addresses as well as the new
addition of complete homo ad
dresses. Post office boxes are
not listed. The directory also con
tains statistics about Stanford, a
list of honor students and a list

Until five years ago the direc

“Bawl-Out” because student
grade point averages were pub
