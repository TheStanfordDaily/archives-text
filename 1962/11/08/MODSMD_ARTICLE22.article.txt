# ORIGINALITY STIFLED?
## College Board Criticized On Validity of Testing 
### 
By NORMAN GREENBERG
Most of the colleges in this
country are compelled to find
some standard means of judging
their applicants. The multiple
choice aptitude tests satisfy this
need; yet, because of the power
of these tests to directly affect
the future of millions of people,
their validity and merit has been
constantly questioned. The Edu
cational Testing Service, upon
which Stanford relies, has especi
ally fallen prey to this criticism.
Dr. Banesh Hoffman, profes
sor of mathematics at New
York’s Queens College and a for
mer member of the Institute for
Advanced Studies at Princeton,
recently summarized his criti
cisms in the book, “The Tyranny
of Testing.” Dr. Hoffman stated
that the multiple-choice tests
stifle thought and originality, pe
nalize the bright student and fa
vor the glib, fast-working and
test-broken candidate; the stress
on recognition and even guess
work tends to corrupt the learn
ing process itself, with the filled
in box replacing the essay; and,
finally, too many questions on
the tests are ambiguous.
DR. HOFFMAN cites the title,
“English Composition Test,” as
an example of the tendency of
the multiple-choice tests to mis
lead and camouflage their inade
quacies. The better score achieved
by those who “prepare” for these
tests is a further basis of criti
cism.
Stanford, although recognizing
the dangers suggested by Dr.
Hoffman, considers these tests
the host means available of test
ing applicants. This is the view

expressed by Dr. Rixford Snyder,
Stanford Director of Admissions,
and Dean Keough, admissions di
rector of the Stanford Law
School. However, both men quali
fied this, Dr. Snyder saying that
an objective balance is necessary
while assessing these tests. The
test judges only aptitude, Snyder
said, and does not necessarily re
veal the quality of the student.
Snyder said that Stanford does
not intend to require applicants
to take the College Entrance Ex
amination Board achievement
tests but shall continue to re
quire Scholastic Aptitude Tests.
Dean Keough recognized these
tests as good “indications of abil
ity.” He stressed that they are
used in conjunction with other
records.
IT MUST be realized that initi
ative, creativity, and enterprise
are not commensurate qualities.
Aptitude, however, readily lends
itself to the demands of the col
leges. Necessity and expediency
demand that the multiple choice
tests be used, he said.
