## Card Soccer Team Priddle's Best Ever 
### Glenn Alford 
The soccer team that Coach Fred Priddle describes as “the best
in my 10 years at Stanford’’ will oppose San Jose State Saturday in
a do or die attempt to win the Northern California Intercollegiate
Soccer Championship. The game will be played on Stanford’s Harry
Maloney Field starting at 10:30 a.m.
Priddle’s statement that this is his best ever team comes as
something of a shock, despite the Indian’s position atop the four
year schools of the NCISC. Priddle has had some outstanding teams
in his ten years, including one league champion, and has coached
six All-Americans in that time.
When asked why he rated this group so high, Priddle said that
it was primarily because of the spirit, teamwork and the many
capable replacements.
The Stanford spirit is obvious on the field. Stanford is no longer
a country-club team of gentlemen, because of the many scrapping
sophomores and the inspiration of the co-captains Sandy Pofahl and
A1 Nnoli. A goal is greeted with shouts of enthusiasm and congratu
lations, not a so-what attitude.
Six Passing Halfbacks
The six fine halfbacks on the Stanford team are passers, not
prone to hang onto the ball too long, and forwards Nnoli, Klas Berg
man and Larry Chukwudebo are classy playmakers.
Replacements are available at all positions. There are two excel
lent goalies, three good back substitutes, all of whom have startec
at least one game, and several reserve forwards.
Priddle said that three members of his 1962 team are likely tc
join his six other All-Americans. Nnoli, back Bill Teusch, who die
such an outstanding job of containing high-scoring USF forwarc
Jim Lynch, and goalie Kent Mueller are the possibilities.
Priddle had special praise for center-forward Stu Rawlings, whe
may be the best man at that position Priddle has ever had, by the
time he graduates. Even when Rawlings plays poorly he scores
crucial goals. He didn’t play well against Cal or USF in the last twe
weeks, but scored the goal in the last four minutes that gave Stan
ford a 2-1 win over the Bears and tallied the Cards’ first goal agains
USF, the one that gave them a chance to get in the overtime period
Priddle had a gleam in his eye when he said that there is nc
reason for Stanford not to dominate the league for the next twe
years, with four sophomores starting now, and two excellent full
backs and three fine forwards moving up from the frosh team.
