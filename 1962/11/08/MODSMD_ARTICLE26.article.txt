Stanford’s high scholastic and intellectual orientation is usually
considered to be a drawback to its athletic program. The strict aca
demic entrance requirements, which reflect Stanford’s emphasis on
scholarship, discourage or prevent the vast majority of outstanding
high school athletes from even considering applying here.
Ironically, however, in several cases, Stanford has achieved
athletic superiority, not only in spite of this academic orientation,
but because of it. I refer to the instances where foreigners have come
to Stanford, primarily for (he academic advantages of a first class
American university and have discovered after their arrival here
that they could contribute substantially on the athletic field.
Soccer Stars from Foreign Countries
Their contributions have been concentrated mostly in soccer.
Until recently, foreigners dominated soccer. Such stars as Bernle

Naggs from England ( All-Ameri
can in 1960), Charles Anntcq
(now a semi-pro player in his
native Belgium), Roger 1 DeWeist
from Belgium, Wolfgang Storch
and Jan Achenbach from Ger
many (both all-league in I960),
and Emannuel Andah from
Ghana (all-league in 1960) have
led the team to one championship
and several high finishes in the
last few years. USE, dominated
by second generation Americans,
for whom soccer is the first love,
has been the toughest competi
tion during this time.
However, due to new enthusi
asm for collegiate soccer on the
part of the American students
here, Coach Fred Priddle says
that he depends much less on
foreigners now than when he
started coaching, ten years ago.
“The great influx of students

who have played soccer in prep school has been the main factor.
Nevertheless, the influence of foreigners is still great on the
soccer field. If you attend a Stanford soccer game, one of first things
you will notice is the African, built like a tank, operating in the
middle of Stanford’s offense. He is 5-10, 160-pound forward Albert
Nnoli from Nigeria. Nnoli is an excellent ball handler and an aggres
sive competitor; he was all-league last year.
Two years ago, before coming to the United States, he played on
the amateur team representing his city, Enugu; later he was se
lected to the all star team for his region, to play in the all-Nigeria
competition.
African Scholarship Program of American Universities
Nnoli is at Stanford in the African Scholarship Program of
American Universities t ASPAi, a program in which costs are shared
by the American university, private foundations (such as the Ford
Foundation) and the governments of the U.S. and the student’s
country. The scholarships are awarded on the basis of high school
grades, aptitude tests, and personal interviews.
Larry Chukwudebe, who scored the winning goal against USF
last week, is another Nigerian forward. Although he has been handi
capped this year by minor injuries and almost total absence from
the practice field, he has been valuable whenever he has been able
to play. Chukwudebe also competes for the track team. As a 23-9
broad jumper, he won two dual meets in 1961 and had the third best
mark on the team. Chukwudebe is also on an ASPA scholarship.
Another scholarship plan, entirely paid for by the government of
Ghana, has sent Stanford perhaps its most exciting player in years,
Emmanuel Andah. A compact 5-5, 155 pounds, Andah approaches
soccer with the enthusiasm of a cheetah chasing a gazelle and has
just about as much speed; he has run a 10.6 100-meter dash while
training for Ghana’s 1960 Olympic team. Andah was such a break
away threat that it became standard practice for Stanford’s oppo
nents to guard him with two men. He made all-league in 1960 and
second team all-league last year.
Priddle says that “Andah has had more influence on soccer at
Stanford than any other player in the last ten years. With his out
standing maneuvering and ball handling, he has given players at
Stanford a first-hand example of what can be done with a soccer
ball.”
Priddle credits the foreign players, in general, with having
stimulated soccer interest by exposing the native players to the
subtler aspects of the game. “The foreigners have a much deeper
understanding of the game since they have been playing it all their
lives. Soccer to them is like baseball and football to American boys.”
The American players are happy to have players such as Nnoli
and Andah on their side. The foreigners’ skill and knowledge of the
game is a source of confidence for the Americans. Fullback Rich
Lonergan said. “With their speed and great kicking power, they are
always a threat to break away; in a close game, we usually try to
set them up for a crucial goal.” Mike Tippett, a first-string wing for
the past two years, emphasized their consistency in handling the
ball; “it’s reassuring to know when they have the ball, they prob
ably aren’t going to make a mistake.”
Stanford’s Attraction for Foreign Scholars
Two factors are primarily responsible for Stanford’s attracting
these foreign scholars to Palo Alto, The first is Stanford’s reputa
tion as one of the outstanding universities of the U.S. While the
name Stanford is not exactly a household word in Europe, Asia, and
Africa, and few people outside of California know that there is a
Harvard on the 1 Pacific Coast, nevertheless, when foreigners seek
information concerning American schools, Stanford is sure to be
considered.
The secctnd factor is Stanford's desire to bring foreign scholars
here, not only to create good will but to broaden the cultural and
political scope of the campus. To carry out this desire, Stanford is
currently associated with foreign scholarship programs in every part
of the world. In addition Stanford has its own ASSU scholar program
under which Stanford students, (he university, and private sources
combine to pay Ihe costs for one year here.
This year, Stanford is spending $30,000 alone for undergraduate
foreign students who comprise only four per cent of the total for
eign students. In all, this money and interest has resulted in 650
foreign students this year at Stanford (about eight per cent of the
student body). Over two-thirds are on some kind of scholarship plan.

middle of Stanford’s offense. He is 5-10, 160-pound forward Albert
Nnoli from Nigeria. Nnoli is an excellent ball handler and an aggres
sive competitor; he was all-league last year.
Two years ago, before coming to the United States, he played on
the amateur team representing his city, Enugu; later he was se
lected to the all star team for his region, to play in the all-Nigeria
competition.
African Scholarship Program of American Universities
Nnoli is at Stanford in the African Scholarship Program of
American Universities t ASPAi, a program in which costs are shared
by the American university, private foundations (such as the Ford
Foundation) and the governments of the U.S. and the student’s
country. The scholarships are awarded on the basis of high school
grades, aptitude tests, and personal interviews.
Larry Chukwudebe, who scored the winning goal against USF
last week, is another Nigerian forward. Although he has been handi
capped this year by minor injuries and almost total absence from
the practice field, he has been valuable whenever he has been able
to play. Chukwudebe also competes for the track team. As a 23-9
broad jumper, he won two dual meets in 1961 and had the third best
mark on the team. Chukwudebe is also on an ASPA scholarship.
Another scholarship plan, entirely paid for by the government of
Ghana, has sent Stanford perhaps its most exciting player in years,
Emmanuel Andah. A compact 5-5, 155 pounds, Andah approaches
soccer with the enthusiasm of a cheetah chasing a gazelle and has
just about as much speed; he has run a 10.6 100-meter dash while
training for Ghana’s 1960 Olympic team. Andah was such a break
away threat that it became standard practice for Stanford’s oppo
nents to guard him with two men. He made all-league in 1960 and
second team all-league last year.
Priddle says that “Andah has had more influence on soccer at
Stanford than any other player in the last ten years. With his out
standing maneuvering and ball handling, he has given players at
Stanford a first-hand example of what can be done with a soccer
ball.”
Priddle credits the foreign players, in general, with having
stimulated soccer interest by exposing the native players to the
subtler aspects of the game. “The foreigners have a much deeper
understanding of the game since they have been playing it all their
lives. Soccer to them is like baseball and football to American boys.”
The American players are happy to have players such as Nnoli
and Andah on their side. The foreigners’ skill and knowledge of the
game is a source of confidence for the Americans. Fullback Rich
Lonergan said. “With their speed and great kicking power, they are
always a threat to break away; in a close game, we usually try to
set them up for a crucial goal.” Mike Tippett, a first-string wing for
the past two years, emphasized their consistency in handling the
ball; “it’s reassuring to know when they have the ball, they prob
ably aren’t going to make a mistake.”
Stanford’s Attraction for Foreign Scholars
Two factors are primarily responsible for Stanford’s attracting
these foreign scholars to Palo Alto, The first is Stanford’s reputa
tion as one of the outstanding universities of the U.S. While the
name Stanford is not exactly a household word in Europe, Asia, and
Africa, and few people outside of California know that there is a
Harvard on the 1 Pacific Coast, nevertheless, when foreigners seek
information concerning American schools, Stanford is sure to be
considered.
The secctnd factor is Stanford's desire to bring foreign scholars
here, not only to create good will but to broaden the cultural and
political scope of the campus. To carry out this desire, Stanford is
currently associated with foreign scholarship programs in every part
of the world. In addition Stanford has its own ASSU scholar program
under which Stanford students, (he university, and private sources
combine to pay Ihe costs for one year here.
This year, Stanford is spending $30,000 alone for undergraduate
foreign students who comprise only four per cent of the total for
eign students. In all, this money and interest has resulted in 650
foreign students this year at Stanford (about eight per cent of the
student body). Over two-thirds are on some kind of scholarship plan.

Nigerian Plays for Stanford
Stanford’s high scholastic and intellectual orientation is usually
considered to be a drawback to its athletic program. The strict aca
demic entrance requirements, which reflect Stanford’s emphasis on
scholarship, discourage or prevent the vast majority of outstanding
high school athletes from even considering applying here.
Ironically, however, in several cases, Stanford has achieved
athletic superiority, not only in spite of this academic orientation,
but because of it. I refer to the instances where foreigners have come
to Stanford, primarily for (he academic advantages of a first class
American university and have discovered after their arrival here
that they could contribute substantially on the athletic field.
Soccer Stars from Foreign Countries
Their contributions have been concentrated mostly in soccer.
Until recently, foreigners dominated soccer. Such stars as Bernle

(now a semi-pro player in his
native Belgium), Roger 1 DeWeist
from Belgium, Wolfgang Storch
and Jan Achenbach from Ger
many (both all-league in I960),
and Emannuel Andah from
Ghana (all-league in 1960) have
led the team to one championship
and several high finishes in the
last few years. USE, dominated
by second generation Americans,
for whom soccer is the first love,
has been the toughest competi

nents to guard him with two men. He made all-league in 1960 and
second team all-league last year.
Priddle says that “Andah has had more influence on soccer at
Stanford than any other player in the last ten years. With his out
standing maneuvering and ball handling, he has given players at
Stanford a first-hand example of what can be done with a soccer
ball.”
Priddle credits the foreign players, in general, with having
stimulated soccer interest by exposing the native players to the
subtler aspects of the game. “The foreigners have a much deeper
understanding of the game since they have been playing it all their
lives. Soccer to them is like baseball and football to American boys.”
The American players are happy to have players such as Nnoli
and Andah on their side. The foreigners’ skill and knowledge of the
game is a source of confidence for the Americans. Fullback Rich
Lonergan said. “With their speed and great kicking power, they are
always a threat to break away; in a close game, we usually try to
set them up for a crucial goal.” Mike Tippett, a first-string wing for
the past two years, emphasized their consistency in handling the
ball; “it’s reassuring to know when they have the ball, they prob
ably aren’t going to make a mistake.”
Stanford’s Attraction for Foreign Scholars
Two factors are primarily responsible for Stanford’s attracting
these foreign scholars to Palo Alto, The first is Stanford’s reputa
tion as one of the outstanding universities of the U.S. While the
name Stanford is not exactly a household word in Europe, Asia, and
Africa, and few people outside of California know that there is a
Harvard on the 1 Pacific Coast, nevertheless, when foreigners seek
information concerning American schools, Stanford is sure to be
considered.
The secctnd factor is Stanford's desire to bring foreign scholars
here, not only to create good will but to broaden the cultural and
political scope of the campus. To carry out this desire, Stanford is
currently associated with foreign scholarship programs in every part
of the world. In addition Stanford has its own ASSU scholar program
under which Stanford students, (he university, and private sources
combine to pay Ihe costs for one year here.
This year, Stanford is spending $30,000 alone for undergraduate
foreign students who comprise only four per cent of the total for
eign students. In all, this money and interest has resulted in 650
foreign students this year at Stanford (about eight per cent of the
student body). Over two-thirds are on some kind of scholarship plan.

Nigerian Plays for Stanford
Stanford’s high scholastic and intellectual orientation is usually
considered to be a drawback to its athletic program. The strict aca
demic entrance requirements, which reflect Stanford’s emphasis on
scholarship, discourage or prevent the vast majority of outstanding
high school athletes from even considering applying here.
Ironically, however, in several cases, Stanford has achieved
athletic superiority, not only in spite of this academic orientation,
but because of it. I refer to the instances where foreigners have come
to Stanford, primarily for (he academic advantages of a first class
American university and have discovered after their arrival here
that they could contribute substantially on the athletic field.
Soccer Stars from Foreign Countries
Their contributions have been concentrated mostly in soccer.
Until recently, foreigners dominated soccer. Such stars as Bernle

Naggs from England ( All-Ameri
can in 1960), Charles Anntcq
(now a semi-pro player in his
native Belgium), Roger 1 DeWeist
from Belgium, Wolfgang Storch
and Jan Achenbach from Ger
many (both all-league in I960),
and Emannuel Andah from
Ghana (all-league in 1960) have
led the team to one championship
and several high finishes in the
last few years. USE, dominated
by second generation Americans,
for whom soccer is the first love,
has been the toughest competi
tion during this time.
However, due to new enthusi
asm for collegiate soccer on the
part of the American students
here, Coach Fred Priddle says
that he depends much less on
foreigners now than when he
started coaching, ten years ago.
“The great influx of students

who have played soccer in prep school has been the main factor.
Nevertheless, the influence of foreigners is still great on the
soccer field. If you attend a Stanford soccer game, one of first things
you will notice is the African, built like a tank, operating in the
middle of Stanford’s offense. He is 5-10, 160-pound forward Albert
Nnoli from Nigeria. Nnoli is an excellent ball handler and an aggres
sive competitor; he was all-league last year.
Two years ago, before coming to the United States, he played on
the amateur team representing his city, Enugu; later he was se
lected to the all star team for his region, to play in the all-Nigeria
competition.
African Scholarship Program of American Universities
Nnoli is at Stanford in the African Scholarship Program of
American Universities t ASPAi, a program in which costs are shared
by the American university, private foundations (such as the Ford
Foundation) and the governments of the U.S. and the student’s
country. The scholarships are awarded on the basis of high school
grades, aptitude tests, and personal interviews.
Larry Chukwudebe, who scored the winning goal against USF
last week, is another Nigerian forward. Although he has been handi
capped this year by minor injuries and almost total absence from
the practice field, he has been valuable whenever he has been able
to play. Chukwudebe also competes for the track team. As a 23-9
broad jumper, he won two dual meets in 1961 and had the third best
mark on the team. Chukwudebe is also on an ASPA scholarship.
Another scholarship plan, entirely paid for by the government of
Ghana, has sent Stanford perhaps its most exciting player in years,
Emmanuel Andah. A compact 5-5, 155 pounds, Andah approaches
soccer with the enthusiasm of a cheetah chasing a gazelle and has
just about as much speed; he has run a 10.6 100-meter dash while
training for Ghana’s 1960 Olympic team. Andah was such a break
away threat that it became standard practice for Stanford’s oppo
nents to guard him with two men. He made all-league in 1960 and

political scope of the campus. To carry out this desire, Stanford is
currently associated with foreign scholarship programs in every part
of the world. In addition Stanford has its own ASSU scholar program
under which Stanford students, (he university, and private sources
combine to pay Ihe costs for one year here.
This year, Stanford is spending $30,000 alone for undergraduate
foreign students who comprise only four per cent of the total for
eign students. In all, this money and interest has resulted in 650
foreign students this year at Stanford (about eight per cent of the
student body). Over two-thirds are on some kind of scholarship plan.

Nigerian Plays for Stanford
Stanford’s high scholastic and intellectual orientation is usually
considered to be a drawback to its athletic program. The strict aca
demic entrance requirements, which reflect Stanford’s emphasis on
scholarship, discourage or prevent the vast majority of outstanding
high school athletes from even considering applying here.
Ironically, however, in several cases, Stanford has achieved
athletic superiority, not only in spite of this academic orientation,
but because of it. I refer to the instances where foreigners have come
to Stanford, primarily for (he academic advantages of a first class
American university and have discovered after their arrival here
that they could contribute substantially on the athletic field.
Soccer Stars from Foreign Countries
Their contributions have been concentrated mostly in soccer.
Until recently, foreigners dominated soccer. Such stars as Bernle

Naggs from England ( All-Ameri
can in 1960), Charles Anntcq
(now a semi-pro player in his
native Belgium), Roger 1 DeWeist
from Belgium, Wolfgang Storch
and Jan Achenbach from Ger
many (both all-league in I960),
and Emannuel Andah from
Ghana (all-league in 1960) have
led the team to one championship
and several high finishes in the
last few years. USE, dominated
by second generation Americans,
for whom soccer is the first love,
has been the toughest competi
tion during this time.
However, due to new enthusi
asm for collegiate soccer on the
part of the American students
here, Coach Fred Priddle says
that he depends much less on
foreigners now than when he
started coaching, ten years ago.
“The great influx of students

who have played soccer in prep school has been the main factor.
Nevertheless, the influence of foreigners is still great on the
soccer field. If you attend a Stanford soccer game, one of first things
you will notice is the African, built like a tank, operating in the
middle of Stanford’s offense. He is 5-10, 160-pound forward Albert
Nnoli from Nigeria. Nnoli is an excellent ball handler and an aggres
sive competitor; he was all-league last year.
Two years ago, before coming to the United States, he played on
the amateur team representing his city, Enugu; later he was se
lected to the all star team for his region, to play in the all-Nigeria
competition.
African Scholarship Program of American Universities
Nnoli is at Stanford in the African Scholarship Program of
American Universities t ASPAi, a program in which costs are shared
by the American university, private foundations (such as the Ford
Foundation) and the governments of the U.S. and the student’s
country. The scholarships are awarded on the basis of high school
grades, aptitude tests, and personal interviews.
Larry Chukwudebe, who scored the winning goal against USF
last week, is another Nigerian forward. Although he has been handi
capped this year by minor injuries and almost total absence from
the practice field, he has been valuable whenever he has been able
to play. Chukwudebe also competes for the track team. As a 23-9
broad jumper, he won two dual meets in 1961 and had the third best
mark on the team. Chukwudebe is also on an ASPA scholarship.
Another scholarship plan, entirely paid for by the government of
Ghana, has sent Stanford perhaps its most exciting player in years,
Emmanuel Andah. A compact 5-5, 155 pounds, Andah approaches
soccer with the enthusiasm of a cheetah chasing a gazelle and has
just about as much speed; he has run a 10.6 100-meter dash while
training for Ghana’s 1960 Olympic team. Andah was such a break
away threat that it became standard practice for Stanford’s oppo
nents to guard him with two men. He made all-league in 1960 and
second team all-league last year.
Priddle says that “Andah has had more influence on soccer at
Stanford than any other player in the last ten years. With his out
standing maneuvering and ball handling, he has given players at
Stanford a first-hand example of what can be done with a soccer
ball.”
Priddle credits the foreign players, in general, with having
stimulated soccer interest by exposing the native players to the
subtler aspects of the game. “The foreigners have a much deeper
understanding of the game since they have been playing it all their
lives. Soccer to them is like baseball and football to American boys.”
The American players are happy to have players such as Nnoli
and Andah on their side. The foreigners’ skill and knowledge of the
game is a source of confidence for the Americans. Fullback Rich
Lonergan said. “With their speed and great kicking power, they are
always a threat to break away; in a close game, we usually try to
set them up for a crucial goal.” Mike Tippett, a first-string wing for
the past two years, emphasized their consistency in handling the
ball; “it’s reassuring to know when they have the ball, they prob
ably aren’t going to make a mistake.”
Stanford’s Attraction for Foreign Scholars
Two factors are primarily responsible for Stanford’s attracting
these foreign scholars to Palo Alto, The first is Stanford’s reputa
tion as one of the outstanding universities of the U.S. While the
name Stanford is not exactly a household word in Europe, Asia, and
Africa, and few people outside of California know that there is a
Harvard on the 1 Pacific Coast, nevertheless, when foreigners seek
information concerning American schools, Stanford is sure to be
considered.
The secctnd factor is Stanford's desire to bring foreign scholars
here, not only to create good will but to broaden the cultural and
political scope of the campus. To carry out this desire, Stanford is
currently associated with foreign scholarship programs in every part
of the world. In addition Stanford has its own ASSU scholar program
under which Stanford students, (he university, and private sources
combine to pay Ihe costs for one year here.
This year, Stanford is spending $30,000 alone for undergraduate
foreign students who comprise only four per cent of the total for
eign students. In all, this money and interest has resulted in 650
foreign students this year at Stanford (about eight per cent of the
student body). Over two-thirds are on some kind of scholarship plan.
