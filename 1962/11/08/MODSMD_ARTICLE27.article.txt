# POSSIBLY BEST TEAM IN U.S.
## SC Features Passing, Running, Catching,Punting;Defense,too 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
To anyone watching the college
football game of the week on
television last Saturday, it was
obvious he was seeing the best
team on the West Coast, and per
haps (he best in the country
USC. The Trojans are currently
ranked second and third in the
U.S. by the major news services,
which is almost tantamount to
first place considring the usual
slighting of western teams by na
tional polls.
The Trojans lead the AAWU
with wins over Washington and
Cal in (heir only league play.
They have a 6-0 record over all,
having beaten lowa and Duke,
which both had high national
rankings at the time.
SC’S OFFKNSF is a combina
tion of flawless execution and
pro-like versatility; in fact, their
style is more reminiscent of
great professional teams than of
outstanding collegiate teams.
Rarely does one find such bal
ance between passing and rush
ing in a college offense. SC is
averaging 321 yards per game, 55
per cent of which comes on (he
ground and 45 per cent through
the air.
The quarterbacking is divided
between junior Pete Beathard
and senior Bill Nelson, one- and
two-year lettermen respectively.
They are both completing passes
around the fifty per cent mark,
and not on dinky stuff, either;
their average completion gains
about 17 yards. Two of their most
impressive totals are ten touch
down passes and only one inter
ception in 116 throws.
Complementing their passing
ability is their threat of running.
Disregarding their yardage lost
while trying to pass, they have
each netted nearly four yards per
carry.
THE PRIMARY target on the
other end of the passing attack is
a 6-5, 225-pound junior All-Coast
end, Hal Bedsole. Bedsole is an
integral part of Beathard’s and
Nelson’s success, having caught
20 passes for six TD’s so far.
When he doesn’t simply outrun
the defenders for a pass, he uses
his height and leg spring to get
the ball. His rather impressive
array of scoring recept ions include
gains of 79. 73, 59. 51, and 25
yards.
USC’s second leading receiver,
wiln 12 catches, is junior half
back Willie Brown. He is better
known, however, for his rushing;
at 5-11, 170 pounds, he is Troy’s
fastest back. His fat, 6,4 rushing
average, includes TD runs of 73
and 19 yards. He also ran back a
kickoff 92 yards against SMU.
WHILE BROWN uses his speed
to turn the ends, fullback Ben
Wilson, a senior, just jolts his
way up the middle. And at 6-0,
225 pounds, he is pretty success

ful at it. Although handicapped
by injuries in the early part of
the season. Wilson has a 3.3-yard
average.
The remaining, slot back, who
lives in the shadow of Brown and
Wilson, is Ken Del Conte, a fas
cinating combination of a shifty
running hack and a fast pass re
ceiver. He has caught six passes
for 56 yards and has gained 5.2
yards per carry. Three times last
week Del Conte ran (he same
swing pattern to the detriment
of Washington; ho went in mo
tion, caught (he ball at about (he
line of scrimmage, and faked (wo
defenders each time, for three of
the easiest-appearing ten-yard
gains possible.
As if all these SC backfield
stars need anything else going
for them, Coach John McKay, in
his third year there, Iris installed
the distracting "I formation;” the
backs all line up directly behind
the quarterback in an “1” and
then shifi out at the last minute
to their correct position for the
particular pla\ This maneuver
prevents the opposition from di
agnosing the play and shifting
its defense accordingh before the
ball is snapped.
BEFORE THE season, everyone
knew the Trojans were strong
offensively, but their defense was
thought to he questionable. De
spite this pessimism, however,
Troy’s record is amazing. It has
shutout two teams, Washington
and lowa, held SMU to a field
goal, and completely fallen apart
in allowing Cal and Duke one
touchdown apiece; Duke even
converted. SC did have somewhat
of a lapse, however, in surrender
ing 2 TD’s to Illinois, Thus SC
has allowed only one of its op
ponents to score more than once.
THE TRO.IA N S' backfield
speed has been outstanding in
contributing to this defensive ef

fort; it has intercepted 15 passes,
by far the best mark in the
AAWU. As for the line, they
must be pretty good too, as SC
also leads the AAWU in rushing
defense, allowing only 145 yards
per game.
Besides all their offense and
defense, SC has still another
league-leading mark; its punter,
Ernie Jones, has an excellent 40.3
yard average.
