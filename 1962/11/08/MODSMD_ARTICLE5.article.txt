# Stilwell, Flügge-Lotz Still Lead In Tight Red Hot Prof Contest
## 
### 
Dr. Donald Stilwell of the Medi
cal School recaptured the lead
yesterday in one of the hottest
Red Hot Prof contests in recent
history. Dr. Stilwell fought his
way to the top with 7912 votes,
deposing for mer loader Mrs. Irm
gard Fltigge ■ Lotz, professor of
aeronautical engineering.
But Mrs. Fliigge-Lotz is still
gamely clinging to second place
with 7010 votes. Following in third
place is Dr. Allard Lowenstein,
last year's Assistant Dean of Men,
with 3590; Biophysics Professor
Victor Burns is fourth with 1527.
SUPPORTING Dr. Stilwell in
his surge to power are the Medical
School and Wilbur' Hall, where he
is a faculty resident at Trancos.
If he retains the load, Dr. Stilwell

will lead yells at the Homecoming
Rally tonight and at the USC
game Saturday.
Dr. Stilwell commented that he
considered his success “a some
what ambivalent honor,” and that
he would, “not entirely willingly,
respond in the same spirit as the
challenge which is presented.” “If
I win. I will accept with all mod
esty, bearing in mind (hat the stu
dent has every right to strike hack
at the professor,” he said.
MRS. FLUGGE-LOTZ, still well
in the race for this year’s profes
sional cheerleader, said: “I haven’t
the slightest idea what the mean
ing of Red Hot Prof is. I didn’t
know about it until last night.”
Dr. Stilwell’s victory is far from
assured as the Law School, which
sponsored last year’s winning can
didate, Professor Hancock, has not
yet announced whom it intends to
support.
To prevent confusion, during
the last half hour all votes will
not be tallied, and must be in an
envelope and placed in a box at
the polls before 4:15.
All proceeds from the contest
will be added to the World Univer
sity Service fund which will go
to help build a tuberculosis sana
torium in Japan. WUS chairman,
Wynn Meagher, stated, “The $3OO
collected so far is far short of the
goal for the contest.”
