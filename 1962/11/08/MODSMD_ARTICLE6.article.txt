NAVY TO INSPECT SOVIET SHIPS— WASHINGTON The U.S.
Navy prepared to begin inspecting Soviet ships carrying missiles out
of Cuba today, as diplomats worked late into the night on a U.S.-
Soviet agreement for this encountet- at sea. The Soviet Union in

arrangements for the U.S. Navy to “contact” the Soviet ships at sea
and count the missiles.

Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev announced last night that the cur
rent series of Soviet nuclear tests would end by Nov. 20 and sug
gested that now was a good time for East-West agreement on an
atomic test ban. Khrushchev, in his first meeting with the press
since the Cuban crisis, told newsmen and diplomats at a reception
that the world had come “very close, very close” to a thermonuclear
conflict over Cuba. Both sides were ready, he said. He admitted the
Soviets had placed 40 rockets on the island for “the defense of
Cuba but said “now wo have taken out our rockets and they are
probably on the way back.”
