# Social Chairmen Claim Overnight Rules Unneeded
## 
### 
Most social chairmen at campus
living groups oppose adoption by
Legislature of new restrictions on
overnight parties, according to a
telephone poll yesterday.
Most of those contacted felt re
vision was unnecessary. Social
chairmen for men’s residences
denied that their overnights
forced women to sleep with their
dates.
“Muir’s overnights have been
some of the best parties of the
year and yet have not been sexual
orgies,” said Muir Social Chair
man, Troop Petrone.
“A STANFORD WOMAN is
less likely to put herself in a com
promising position on an over
night than she is on a private
date,” he said.
Judy Garfield said the women
at Jordan “just don’t like” the pro
posed restrictions. They’re “too
unwieldy and simply impossible,”
she charged.
This was a common complaint.
Said Martin Gibson, Theta Chi:
LASSU has enough trouble keep-

ing tab on residences, and all the
added red tape would only incite
students to ignore ASSU restric
tions. They’ll turn in the kind of
report LASSU wants to see and
then make last minute changes,
he said.
TROOP AGREED that groups
will try to evade the rules. These
restrictions will only encourage
more violation, said Janey Clifton
of Jordan. It’s an insult to the
women, she said.
It’s an insult to the Stanford
male, said an Alpha Dolt spokes
man.
Sherry Page, Hurlburt, said the
regulations were a good idea:
“Overnights are held for specific
purposes and the rules arc de
signed to defeat these purposes.”
But, she lamented, they won’t
change the situation very much.
LEE SNELLER, Delta Chi, also
thought the proposed regulations
were “basically good,” but said
that the red tape would mean “an
awful lot of extra work” for so
cial chairmen.
Gibson also blasted the clause
saddling group social chairmen
and presidents with individual re
sponsibility for misconduct of
others. The responsibility should
fall on the entire group, he said.
There must be some better way
to handle the whole problem. Miss
Garfield said.

The By-law regulations con
cerning: overnights, passed
two w r ecks ago by Legisla
ture, are in effect for Big
Game overnights. Presidents
and Social Chairmen of
groups planning overnights
are reminded that they must
complete all registration pro
cedures by Monday, Novem-
Ihm- 12. Failure to do this will
result in cancellation of the
overnight.
