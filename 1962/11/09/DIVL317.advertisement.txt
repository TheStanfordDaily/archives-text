CHURCH of
CHRIST
Peter, as guided by the Holy
Spirit, used the keys of the
kingdom when he explained to
believers that they must repent
and be baptized (immersed)
for remission of sins.
When people today obey the
same instructions, they become
children of God just as did the
early disciples. To obey part
Bible and part something else
is to become something other
than a child of God.
Churches of Christ seek to
restore the divinely approved
plan of redemption that was
taught, believed and obey at
the time when the church had
its beginning. (Acts 2:37-47.
