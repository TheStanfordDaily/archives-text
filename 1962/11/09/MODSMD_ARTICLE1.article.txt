# British Laborite Urges Joining Common Market
## 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
C. Anthony Crosland, Labor
member of Parliament, presented
his objections to his party’s oppo
sition to Britain's .joining the
Common Market to a largo audi
ence in Trosiddcr Lounge last
night.
Most of the common arguments
advanced for British participation
in the European Economic Com
munity, Crosland began, are na
ive and easily refuted. Joining
the EEC would not increase total
British exports, nor wotdd it in
fuse Britain with “(hi' bracing
winds of competition,” which
could better be provided by do
mestic measures.
BUT BRITISH national life
could be quickened by the “psy
chological shock-affects” of going
Into Europe, Crosland continued
a shock-effect which the six
present members of the EEC
have already fell beneficially.
In addition, Crosland suggest
ed, Britain by virtue of her Com
monwealth experience is needed
to keep the EEC mindful of its
responsibilities to the underde
veloped countries. Statesmen In
both Europe and Britain have be
gun to clamor for Britain to enter
the EEC and keep it from falling
under a Franco-German hegem
ony.
The standard objection to Brit
ain’s joining is that she would
lose her Commonwealth trading
preferences, hut the Influence of
this change has boon greatly
overestimated.
IF BRITAIN stayed outside the
Common Market she would face
increasing isolation, a continuing

lack of national orientation, and
a possible European nuclear
force separate from the United
States.
Joining the common market
would reduce Britain’s tendency
to play-act its former world role
by assuming bigger international
burdens than it can handle, and
would give her a new perspective,
“a new sense of where our des
tinies lie,” Crosland added.
In analysing the curious role
reversal which has made the La
bor Party the opponent of Brit
ish participation and the Conserv
atives its arch-defenders. Cros
land pointed to the traditional pa
triotism and “almost xenophobia”
of the working movement in for
eign policy.
The Conservatives adopted the
issue because they saw Ihe nation
going stagnant, because they
wanted to distract attention from
their own blatant domestic fail
ures, and because they saw the
EEC as the coming corner of the
political power that they love so
much.
