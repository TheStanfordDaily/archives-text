ing from student evaluation of
faculty to the management of the j
Bookstore.
WHEN ASKED if (he student
body could expect another in- j
crease in tuition or room and
board payments in the near fu
ture, Cuthbertson gave a flat
out “yes” reply. Although hikes
in the student bills were inevita
ble, the university has tried to!
phase increases in order to lessen
the financial burden.
Glover said that students could
expect a more formal stand by
the Administration concerning
partisan political activity on
campus.

istration encourages political de
bate and interest although it for
bids politically ambitious groups
to use the Stanford name
to lend prestige to their causes. |

cent stand denouncing Proposi-1
tion 24 was compatible with the ]
Administration’s policy, Glover j
said that he felt the body had
“pressed beyond the boundaries.”
COMMENTING on ways in
which students could evaluate in
structors, Robert Wert, vice pro
vost, said that although past at
tempts at turning out “scratch (
sheets” at Stanford had been “un-1
organized,” such a document j
could benefit the academic com- j
m unity.
