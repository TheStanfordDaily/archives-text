## 
### 
Gaining 38,000 votes in the last
half hour of polling, Anatomy
Professor Donald Stilweil was
swept to an easy victory in this
year's Red Hot Professor Contest.
When the running tabulation
was hailed a half-hour before the
polls closed, Dr. Stilweil had only
a fair lead over the second-place
Professor Irmegard FluggeLotz.
But the sealed votes cast in the
closing minutes of the contest
contained $3BO all for Stilweil.
The final count for Stilweil, who
was supported by a Med School-
Wilbur Hall coalition, was 56,364.
Finishing behind Stilweil were
Mrs. Flliggc-Lotz, professor of
aero and astronautics, with 11,650
votes; William Estes, professor
of psychology, with 5,507 votes;
and "exiled” Allard Lowcnstein
with 3,741 voles.
This year’s Red Hot Professor
Contest took in $876.92 for the
World University Service’s tuber
culosis sanitorium project in
Japan. The total fell short of last
year's $1,028 mark because the
Law School and the Business
Schools failed to sponsor candi
dates as they have in the past,
according to Larry Tester, of
wus.


PROFESSOR DONALD STILWELL, faculty resident of Trancos, was
overwhelmingly elected "Red-Hot Prof for 1962 yesterday. Stil
well outdistanced his nearest rival Prof. Irmgard Flugge-Lotz
$563.64 to $1 16.50.
