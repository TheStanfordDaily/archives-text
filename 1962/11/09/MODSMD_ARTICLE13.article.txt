# Stegner to Discuss Man's Environment
## 
### 
Is progress in the best interest
of mankind? Will man exhaust
his natural resources and starve
to death, or will the products
of his continual technological
advancements be the means by
which man will destroy himself?
Professor Wallace Stegner of
the English Department will dis
cuss these and other questions in
his lecture, “Man, a Disease of
His Environment,” Monday at 4:30
p.m. in the Tresidder Lounge.
Stegner served as an assistant
to the secretary of the Interior in
Washington, D.C., last year and
worked on a program for the ex
pansion of national parks. He is
also a member of the National
Park Advisory Board.
Stegner is the director of the
Creative Writing Program at
Stanford. His literary accomplish
ments include the authorship of
six books: “Remembering Laugh
ter,” “Fire and Ice,” “Big Rock
Candy Mountain,” “Preacher and
the Slave,” “Mormon Country,”
and “City of the Living.” He is
also the editor of two collections
of short stories: “Great American
Short Stories,” and “Stanford
Short Stories.”
Stegner has been awarded many
honors, of which a Guggenheim
Fellowship and a Rockerfeller
Foundation grant are only a part.
Discussion and coffee will follow
the program.
