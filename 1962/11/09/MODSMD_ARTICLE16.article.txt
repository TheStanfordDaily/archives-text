# Student Elections

### 
II the student elections and Constitutional referendum excite
flic same kind of interest as elections did last autumn, less than
lialf the student body will vote. Not that this is a major catastro
phe, but if Stanford is to retain any student government, it is in
the interests of students to direct the course of their government.
Except for occasional referenda students have no opportunity
to affect directly the decisions made in the name of students.
Therefore, election of officers in student government is the easiest
way to prevent incompetent decisions—by voting down incompe
tent candidates.
Occasionally, this would mean voting down every candidate
lor an office. Not that this either is a major catastrophe, but it is
an impossibility. So the only recourse is to vote for the most
competent of the incompetent or to abstain, as the habit seems
to be.
This habit, proceeding also from a belief in the impotence and
insignificance of student government, could well affect the out
come of the Constitutional referendum. If all those students dis
satisfied with the status quo in student government would indicate
their displeasure by voting for a change, they will get that change
in th(‘ form of a radically altered structure of government.
