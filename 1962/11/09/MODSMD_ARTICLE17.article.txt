Editor, Tlic Daily:
Your Mi'. Reppy has gone a bit
overboard in his objections to (ho
proposed overnight policy. His
error is in assuming that LASSU
is trying to legislate morality. He
has to admit (his near the end of
of ins article (“Once a place is
found, these proposed rules will
in no way stop a Stanford couple
that wants to sleep together from
doing so”) hut he insists that this
is (he intent of the regulations.
The regulations are points of
common-sense planning that a
wise social chairman would make
sure of with or without rules.
They provide for locks on doors,
REAL (as opposed to fictitious)
adult guests, available telephones
and transportation, planned activ
ities, and social areas besides
bedrooms for (hose who would
appreciate them. Unfortunately,
the planners of overnights some
times neglect to check these
things, and their guests may be
disappointed or inconvenienced.
Certainly the regulations do not
enforce “chastity,” or attempt to.
They are in one sense a planning
guide to social chairmen, and in
another, an attempt to give equal
consideration to the people who
do not want to sleep with their
dates. If a girl wishes to go on an
overnight, she should have the
right to expect a lock on her
door, which she could lock or
leave unlocked at her discretion
—there are sometimes other
guests at a resort or motel be
sides those on the overnight. She
should have the right to know
that a sober adult (not a police
man) is available in case of acci
dent or illness (I suppose people
are as prone to appendicitis on
overnights as any place else). She
and all guests should appreciate
that (ho officers of the sponsoring
group have accepted responsibili
ty for the event.

There is only one reasonable
objection to the overnight policy
in my mind, and that is the “red
tape” factor. Certainly written
statements take more time than
tacit assumptions, but here again
I would think that a good social
chairman would take some time
in investigating the facilities for
rooms, dancing, etc., whether or
not he were required to do so.
But it is this red tape that is at
issue anyone who has studied
the regulations will realize that

they do not and cannot enforce a
particular morality on overnight
participants.

The statement from the Men’s
and Women’s Councils on the in
tention to enforce the school’s |
liquor policy was welcome r-ead- j
ing to the parents of an aspiring |
member of September '63’s fresh-1
man class.
If “Stanford’s new boys and
girls ~ . chafe at Stanford’s
quaint old ways” where the ban
ning of liquor is concerned, as
‘‘Time’ reports, then maybe the
Admissions Office should take ad
vantage of a little informal pre
selection by seeing that a state- j
ment of the school’s policy on |
liquor be included in the “Bulle-!
tin” they send prospective stu-1
dents. (The 1960 edition we were i
sent has none.)
The East provides a number of
highly ranked schools where
drinking is allowed to dominate
the social life. The number of first
class schools where it does not is
small. I know, because we have
been at some pains to ferret out
Just such a school. I am grateful
to Stanford University for pro
viding a fine education in an at
mosphere where students can re
spect an administration that up
holds the law of the State, where
campus police are not in the po
sition of habitually closing their
eyes to law infraction, where as
young adults, students are given
the opportunity to develop social
skills and may learn to enjoy one
another without depending on the
stultifying effects of alcohol.
I hope that future incoming
classes will be increasingly com
posed of men and women who ac
cept Stanford’s policy on liquor.

In yesterday’s review of the
opinions of social chairmen on
the proposed overnight policy,
not only was my name misspelled
and my residence incorrectly
given, but a statement was at
tributed to me which was not
mine. I did not say and do not
feel that the policy is “an insult
to the women.” Hopefully such
carelessness is not characteristic
of the Daily’s handling of this is
sue.

of ins article (“Once a place is
found, these proposed rules will
in no way stop a Stanford couple
that wants to sleep together from
doing so”) hut he insists that this
is (he intent of the regulations.
The regulations are points of
common-sense planning that a
wise social chairman would make
sure of with or without rules.
They provide for locks on doors,
REAL (as opposed to fictitious)
adult guests, available telephones
and transportation, planned activ
ities, and social areas besides
bedrooms for (hose who would
appreciate them. Unfortunately,
the planners of overnights some
times neglect to check these
things, and their guests may be
disappointed or inconvenienced.
Certainly the regulations do not
enforce “chastity,” or attempt to.
They are in one sense a planning
guide to social chairmen, and in
another, an attempt to give equal
consideration to the people who
do not want to sleep with their
dates. If a girl wishes to go on an
overnight, she should have the
right to expect a lock on her
door, which she could lock or
leave unlocked at her discretion
—there are sometimes other
guests at a resort or motel be
sides those on the overnight. She
should have the right to know
that a sober adult (not a police
man) is available in case of acci
dent or illness (I suppose people
are as prone to appendicitis on
overnights as any place else). She
and all guests should appreciate
that (ho officers of the sponsoring
group have accepted responsibili
ty for the event.

There is only one reasonable
objection to the overnight policy
in my mind, and that is the “red
tape” factor. Certainly written
statements take more time than
tacit assumptions, but here again
I would think that a good social
chairman would take some time
in investigating the facilities for
rooms, dancing, etc., whether or
not he were required to do so.
But it is this red tape that is at
issue anyone who has studied
the regulations will realize that

they do not and cannot enforce a
particular morality on overnight
participants.

ing to the parents of an aspiring |
member of September '63’s fresh-1
man class.
If “Stanford’s new boys and

Admissions Office should take ad
vantage of a little informal pre

ment of the school’s policy on |
liquor be included in the “Bulle-!
tin” they send prospective stu-1
dents. (The 1960 edition we were i
sent has none.)
The East provides a number of
highly ranked schools where
drinking is allowed to dominate
the social life. The number of first
class schools where it does not is
small. I know, because we have
been at some pains to ferret out
Just such a school. I am grateful
to Stanford University for pro
viding a fine education in an at
mosphere where students can re
spect an administration that up
holds the law of the State, where
campus police are not in the po
sition of habitually closing their
eyes to law infraction, where as
young adults, students are given
the opportunity to develop social
skills and may learn to enjoy one
another without depending on the
stultifying effects of alcohol.
I hope that future incoming
classes will be increasingly com
posed of men and women who ac
cept Stanford’s policy on liquor.

common-sense planning that a
wise social chairman would make
sure of with or without rules.
They provide for locks on doors,
REAL (as opposed to fictitious)
adult guests, available telephones
and transportation, planned activ
ities, and social areas besides
bedrooms for (hose who would
appreciate them. Unfortunately,
the planners of overnights some
times neglect to check these
things, and their guests may be
disappointed or inconvenienced.
Certainly the regulations do not
enforce “chastity,” or attempt to.
They are in one sense a planning
guide to social chairmen, and in
another, an attempt to give equal
consideration to the people who
do not want to sleep with their
dates. If a girl wishes to go on an
overnight, she should have the
right to expect a lock on her
door, which she could lock or
leave unlocked at her discretion
—there are sometimes other
guests at a resort or motel be
sides those on the overnight. She
should have the right to know
that a sober adult (not a police
man) is available in case of acci
dent or illness (I suppose people
are as prone to appendicitis on
overnights as any place else). She
and all guests should appreciate
that (ho officers of the sponsoring
group have accepted responsibili
ty for the event.

There is only one reasonable
objection to the overnight policy
in my mind, and that is the “red
tape” factor. Certainly written
statements take more time than
tacit assumptions, but here again
I would think that a good social
chairman would take some time
in investigating the facilities for
rooms, dancing, etc., whether or
not he were required to do so.
But it is this red tape that is at
issue anyone who has studied
the regulations will realize that

they do not and cannot enforce a
particular morality on overnight
participants.

The statement from the Men’s
and Women’s Councils on the in
tention to enforce the school’s |
liquor policy was welcome r-ead- j
ing to the parents of an aspiring |
member of September '63’s fresh-1
man class.
If “Stanford’s new boys and
girls ~ . chafe at Stanford’s
quaint old ways” where the ban
ning of liquor is concerned, as
‘‘Time’ reports, then maybe the
Admissions Office should take ad
vantage of a little informal pre
selection by seeing that a state- j
ment of the school’s policy on |
liquor be included in the “Bulle-!
tin” they send prospective stu-1
dents. (The 1960 edition we were i
sent has none.)
The East provides a number of
highly ranked schools where
drinking is allowed to dominate
the social life. The number of first
class schools where it does not is
small. I know, because we have
been at some pains to ferret out
Just such a school. I am grateful
to Stanford University for pro
viding a fine education in an at
mosphere where students can re
spect an administration that up
holds the law of the State, where
campus police are not in the po
sition of habitually closing their
eyes to law infraction, where as
young adults, students are given
the opportunity to develop social
skills and may learn to enjoy one
another without depending on the
stultifying effects of alcohol.
I hope that future incoming
classes will be increasingly com
posed of men and women who ac
cept Stanford’s policy on liquor.

In yesterday’s review of the
opinions of social chairmen on
the proposed overnight policy,
not only was my name misspelled
and my residence incorrectly
given, but a statement was at
tributed to me which was not
mine. I did not say and do not
feel that the policy is “an insult
to the women.” Hopefully such
carelessness is not characteristic
of the Daily’s handling of this is
sue.
