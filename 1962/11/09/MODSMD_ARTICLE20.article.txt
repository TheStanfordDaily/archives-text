## Elections Show Strength Of Center in U.S. Politics 
### WALTER MIPPMANN 
As I read tho election returns on Wednesday morning, the domi
nant majority, not only in the country as a whole but also within
each of the parties, is not on the left or on the right hut in the
center. The big Republican victories east of the Mississippi—in New
York, Pennsylvania, Michigan— were won by conservative but pro
gressive men Rockefeller and+

Javits, Scranton and Romney. (I
do not know about Mr. Rhodes in
Ohio.) The biggest Republican de
feat that of Mr. Nixon in Cali
fornia was the defeat of a poli
tician who does not have the con
fidence of moderate men.
There is nothing in the returns
to suggest that there is « Repub
lican majority, much less a popu
lar majority, for Sen. Goldwater
and those to the right of him. The I
Republican party will have to go
to the country in 1964 as the con
servative and progressive party
of Rockefeller, Javits. Scranton,
and Romney.

The Demo
crals have lost,
if indeed they
have losi them,
only a handful
of seats in the
House. Accord
ing to the rules
of the political
game as played
for half a cen
tury, when the

party in power loses little if any
thing in a mid-term election, it
really wins a victory. President
Kennedy has had a sizeable vote
of approval.
I do not know, and it may he
impossible to know, how big a
part the Cuban affair played in
the outcome. But in the long view
President Kennedy, who is a man
in the center, is entitled to feel
that he represents and reflects a
great centrist majority.
To be a man of the center is to
be at once conservative, liberal,
and progressive. Mr. Kennedy
has always been a man of the
center and in leading the Demo
cratic Administration to the cen
ter position, he has led the Demo
cratic party to the place where
the big majority live.
THE ELECTION has shown
that the Democrats are still the
majority party in the country.
But, of course, they are not a
united party. They are divided
into three wings—a very conserv
ative wing based on the South, a
liberal and progressive wing
based on the industrial centers in
the North and East, and a cen
trist wing which might just as
well he called the Kennedy ad
ministration wing.
If we ask ourselves whether
President Kennedy can turn his
victoi’y in the election into hard
votes for his legislative program,
I would guess that he will not be
able to do that in any large meas
ure. He is likely to do something
better on certain of his welfare
measures because the Rockefel
ler-Romney-Scranton Republicans
will want to identify themselves
with measures that are popular
in the great urban centers. There
is also a chance that, because
Gov. Rockefeller is a modern edu
cated man in economic theory,
the President may win support
for the critical and important
matter of installing an expan
sionary fiscal policy.
But if the President makes
some headway in these matters,
it will not be spectacular. There
is no popular support for inno
vations at home. The President’s
great support is in the field of
our vital national and interna
tional interests.
HERE HIS stature has grown
greatly since he first went to the
White House, and with the new
international prospects that are
opening up since Cuba and the
Chinese lndian war, it is good to
know that in the search for peace
with honor he can count upon
such substantial popular support,
