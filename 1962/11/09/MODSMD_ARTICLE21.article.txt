## Brazilian Movies At S.F. Festival Powerful Moving' 
### ROBERT SHURE 
Two powerful and moving
films from Brazil, differing wide
ly in context, have been among
the highlights of San Francisco’s
current International Film Fes
tival at the Metro Theater.
“Keeper of Promises” was the
winner of the Golden Palm
Award as Best Film at the
Cannes Festival earlier this year.
Through its excellent pacing and
brilliant acting and directing, the
film conveys its symbolic theme
with force and clarity.
The story concerns a farmer
who has promised to carry a
huge wooden cross into a church
if his wounded donkey is saved.
The vow was made to Santa Bar
bara, and on the “Day of Santa
Barbara” following the animal’s
recovery, the poor farmer drags
his burden thirty miles, to the
church steps.
His motives are doubted, how
ever, and he is barred from the
church. Subsequently, various
groups in the village—as well as
the press -use him as a means of
extending their own political and
religious goals. A car nival atmos
phere develops, and the interplay
between the different people in
volved, with their conflicting and
intertwining motivations, forms
the dramatic core of the film.
The steady build to the climax
is tense and continually engross
ing.
“Keeper of Promises” was writ
ten and directed by Anselmo Du
arte, for years Brazil’s leading
film actor. The picture stars Le
onardo Villar as the farmer,
Gloria Menez.es as his downtrod
den wife, and Dionisio Azevedo
as Father Olavo, who stands be
tween the farmer and the fulfill
ment of his promise.
The second Brazilian film
shown at the Festival, “The No
Good Ones.” is a highly contro
versial entry first introduced at
the Berlin Festival in July. The
theme is sordid and harshly re
alistic, yet because of magnifi
cent camera work and deft handl
ing of the action, the film must
rank as a promising work of art.
“The No Good Ones” depicts
the moral decay of a segment of
today’s youth. Three of the four
characters involved cast aside all
other values in a desperate at
tempt for money, through black
mail, extortion and brutal intimi
dation. The uninhibited portrayal
of the action—all of which takes
place in a single day—is unusual
even in the framework of con
temporary cinema.
Producer and star of the film
is Jece Valadao. The director is
Ruy Guerra, and the other char
acters are played by Daniel Filho,
Norma Benguel and Lucy Car
valho.
