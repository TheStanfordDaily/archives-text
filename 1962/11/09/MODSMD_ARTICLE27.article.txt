# Stanford Looks for Third Big Upset of Season, Against USC
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
USC, leading Ihe AAWU and
bound for its first Rose Bowl
since 1954, invades the Farm to
day in preparation for its game
against Stanford, tomorrow at
1:30 in Stanford Stadium. The In
dians, with a 1-2 record in league

play so far and a 3-4 mark
over-all, will be seeking their
third win in their history of
AAWU competition.
The Trojans are conservative
14-point favorites, hut Stanford
has been at its best twice this
year when it was expected to lose
dismally: the Indians beat Michi
gan State, also a 14-point favorite,
and UCLA, a nine-point favorite.
USC features an explosive at
tack which has averaged 21
points a game and is leading the
league in total offense. On the
other hand, Stanford is leading
the league in total defense, al
lowing just 240 yards per game;
its beefy line (averaging 226

pounds per man), and adroit
backfield, aggressive linebackers
iiave been the main reasons for
this defensive effort. Neverthe
less, when the Trojans and In
dians clash tomorrow, it may be
one of the most offensive games
in recent Stanford history.
ALTHOUGH STANFORD has
faced other powerful offensive
teams this year, USC presents a
new challenge, since its attack
is so versatile. Against Michigan
State, Washington, and Oregon,
stopping the running backs was
Ihe Indians’ main concern;
against Washington State and
Oregon Slate, passing was the
chief threat.

However, stacking your de
fense against Troy is rather im
prudent, as the Huskies found
out last week in losing 14-0.
Washington concentrated on stop
ping the great passing combina
tion of Pete Beathard or Bill Nel
son-to-Hal Bedsole, double-team
ing Bedsole Ihe whole game;
Bedsole was held to just one re
ception (for a TD), but mean
while, SC’s array of speedy and
powerful backs were turning the
ends and going up the middle like
crazy to rack up 247 yards on the
ground and two early touchdowns

to salt the crucial game away.
Indian Coach Jack Curtice
doesn’t really need any warning
about SC’s running prowess; all
he has to do is recall last year’s
15-30 loss in the Coliseum, in
which the Trojans gained 310
yards rushing, led by Beathard’s
124 yards, including one scoring
run for 69 yards.
CUBTICK IS not forgetting
about Bedsolc, though. “We’ll be
trying everything to stop him,”
Curtice said; “sometimes the de
fensive end will drop off and
double team him, and sometimes
he’ll fire in, trying to rush the
passer.” No one man will guard
Bedsole the whole game, since he
changes back and forth from left
to right end.
Meanwhile, if Stanford is to
threaten, it will have to depend
on its quarterbacks to lead a con
sistent passing attack. All week,
along with their defensive drills,
the Indians have been preparing
to provide pass protection against
SC’s lino, which averages a solid
and mobile 207 pounds. Steve
Thurlow, Stanford's best passer,
is completely recovered from the
elbow he bruised last week
against Oregon and will start as
usual.

USC, leading Ihe AAWU and
bound for its first Rose Bowl
since 1954, invades the Farm to
day in preparation for its game
against Stanford, tomorrow at
1:30 in Stanford Stadium. The In
dians, with a 1-2 record in league

play so far and a 3-4 mark
over-all, will be seeking their
third win in their history of
AAWU competition.
The Trojans are conservative
14-point favorites, hut Stanford
has been at its best twice this
year when it was expected to lose
dismally: the Indians beat Michi
gan State, also a 14-point favorite,
and UCLA, a nine-point favorite.
USC features an explosive at
tack which has averaged 21
points a game and is leading the
league in total offense. On the
other hand, Stanford is leading
the league in total defense, al
lowing just 240 yards per game;
its beefy line (averaging 226

pounds per man), and adroit
backfield, aggressive linebackers
iiave been the main reasons for
this defensive effort. Neverthe
less, when the Trojans and In
dians clash tomorrow, it may be
one of the most offensive games
in recent Stanford history.
ALTHOUGH STANFORD has
faced other powerful offensive
teams this year, USC presents a
new challenge, since its attack
is so versatile. Against Michigan
State, Washington, and Oregon,
stopping the running backs was
Ihe Indians’ main concern;
against Washington State and
Oregon Slate, passing was the
chief threat.

However, stacking your de
fense against Troy is rather im
prudent, as the Huskies found
out last week in losing 14-0.
Washington concentrated on stop
ping the great passing combina
tion of Pete Beathard or Bill Nel
son-to-Hal Bedsole, double-team
ing Bedsole Ihe whole game;
Bedsole was held to just one re
ception (for a TD), but mean
while, SC’s array of speedy and
powerful backs were turning the
ends and going up the middle like
crazy to rack up 247 yards on the
ground and two early touchdowns

to salt the crucial game away.
Indian Coach Jack Curtice
doesn’t really need any warning
about SC’s running prowess; all
he has to do is recall last year’s
15-30 loss in the Coliseum, in
which the Trojans gained 310
yards rushing, led by Beathard’s
124 yards, including one scoring
run for 69 yards.
CUBTICK IS not forgetting
about Bedsolc, though. “We’ll be
trying everything to stop him,”
Curtice said; “sometimes the de
fensive end will drop off and
double team him, and sometimes
he’ll fire in, trying to rush the
passer.” No one man will guard
Bedsole the whole game, since he
changes back and forth from left
to right end.
Meanwhile, if Stanford is to
threaten, it will have to depend
on its quarterbacks to lead a con
sistent passing attack. All week,
along with their defensive drills,
the Indians have been preparing
to provide pass protection against
SC’s lino, which averages a solid

about Bedsolc, though. “We’ll be
trying everything to stop him,”
Curtice said; “sometimes the de
fensive end will drop off and
double team him, and sometimes
he’ll fire in, trying to rush the
passer.” No one man will guard
Bedsole the whole game, since he
changes back and forth from left
to right end.
Meanwhile, if Stanford is to
threaten, it will have to depend
on its quarterbacks to lead a con
sistent passing attack. All week,
along with their defensive drills,
the Indians have been preparing
to provide pass protection against
SC’s lino, which averages a solid
and mobile 207 pounds. Steve
Thurlow, Stanford's best passer,
is completely recovered from the
elbow he bruised last week
against Oregon and will start as
usual.

USC, leading Ihe AAWU and
bound for its first Rose Bowl
since 1954, invades the Farm to
day in preparation for its game
against Stanford, tomorrow at
1:30 in Stanford Stadium. The In
dians, with a 1-2 record in league

play so far and a 3-4 mark
over-all, will be seeking their
third win in their history of
AAWU competition.
The Trojans are conservative
14-point favorites, hut Stanford
has been at its best twice this
year when it was expected to lose
dismally: the Indians beat Michi
gan State, also a 14-point favorite,
and UCLA, a nine-point favorite.
USC features an explosive at
tack which has averaged 21
points a game and is leading the
league in total offense. On the
other hand, Stanford is leading
the league in total defense, al
lowing just 240 yards per game;
its beefy line (averaging 226

pounds per man), and adroit
backfield, aggressive linebackers
iiave been the main reasons for
this defensive effort. Neverthe
less, when the Trojans and In
dians clash tomorrow, it may be
one of the most offensive games
in recent Stanford history.
ALTHOUGH STANFORD has
faced other powerful offensive
teams this year, USC presents a
new challenge, since its attack
is so versatile. Against Michigan
State, Washington, and Oregon,
stopping the running backs was
Ihe Indians’ main concern;
against Washington State and
Oregon Slate, passing was the
chief threat.

However, stacking your de
fense against Troy is rather im
prudent, as the Huskies found
out last week in losing 14-0.
Washington concentrated on stop
ping the great passing combina
tion of Pete Beathard or Bill Nel
son-to-Hal Bedsole, double-team
ing Bedsole Ihe whole game;
Bedsole was held to just one re
ception (for a TD), but mean
while, SC’s array of speedy and
powerful backs were turning the
ends and going up the middle like
crazy to rack up 247 yards on the
ground and two early touchdowns

to salt the crucial game away.
Indian Coach Jack Curtice
doesn’t really need any warning
about SC’s running prowess; all
he has to do is recall last year’s
15-30 loss in the Coliseum, in
which the Trojans gained 310
yards rushing, led by Beathard’s
124 yards, including one scoring
run for 69 yards.
CUBTICK IS not forgetting
about Bedsolc, though. “We’ll be
trying everything to stop him,”
Curtice said; “sometimes the de
fensive end will drop off and
double team him, and sometimes
he’ll fire in, trying to rush the
passer.” No one man will guard
Bedsole the whole game, since he
changes back and forth from left
to right end.
