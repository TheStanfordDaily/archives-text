# SJS Speed Tests SU Booters

### GLENN ALFORD 
Beep! Beep! Whoosh!
The blur (hat you just missed
seeing was the San Jose State
soccer team. The Spartans, fea
turing three men capable of run
ning the 100-yard dash in 9,5 or
better, invade Stanford tomorrow
at 10:30 a.m.
Stanford hopes to clinch a
berth in the NCAA soccer play
offs with a victory. Spartan
chances of an upset rest chiefly
with the chance that one of their
swifties can sneak behind the
Card defense and put in a sur
prise goal or two.
THE THREE SJS sprinters
are Dennis Johnson, 9.3, Jim
Omagbemi, 9.4, and Lloyd Murad,
9.4.
Stanford has speed of its own
to match the Spartans swift for
wards. Backs Sandy Pofahl and
Bill Teusch should be able to run
fast enough to corral any SJS
upset ideas. Rich Lonergan, Jim
Armstrong and Don Burr haven’t
had any trouble with fast opposi
tion forwards that were much
better players than those of SJS,
and there’s little reason to sus
pect that they’ll have trouble to
morrow.

The Spartans also have a rug
ged defense, led by two backs
who rated Ail-NCISC considera
tion at City College of San Fran
cisco before transferring to San
Jose. They are halfback Dave
Kingsley and fullback Ed Zumot.
Other Spartan defensemen are
Valdis Svans, Diet war Demeter
and Slobodan Caleb.
STANFORD Coach Fred Prid

die, while not fearing the Spar
lons and predicting a Stanford
victory, says that San Jose is a
good team, not having hit its po
tentiality yet this year. He thinks
that even if they hit it against
Stanford, the Big Red should win
anyway.

Stanford's starting goalie will
probably be Kent Mueller, though
Tom Paulsen should see action.
Starting forwards will be
chosen from among A1 Nnoli,
Larry Chukwudebe, Stu Rawl
ings, Don Griffith, Ed Clark, and
Klas Bergman.

better, invade Stanford tomorrow
at 10:30 a.m.
Stanford hopes to clinch a
berth in the NCAA soccer play
offs with a victory. Spartan
chances of an upset rest chiefly
with the chance that one of their
swifties can sneak behind the
Card defense and put in a sur
prise goal or two.
THE THREE SJS sprinters
are Dennis Johnson, 9.3, Jim
Omagbemi, 9.4, and Lloyd Murad,
9.4.
Stanford has speed of its own
to match the Spartans swift for
wards. Backs Sandy Pofahl and
Bill Teusch should be able to run
fast enough to corral any SJS
upset ideas. Rich Lonergan, Jim
Armstrong and Don Burr haven’t
had any trouble with fast opposi
tion forwards that were much
better players than those of SJS,
and there’s little reason to sus
pect that they’ll have trouble to
morrow.

The Spartans also have a rug
ged defense, led by two backs
who rated Ail-NCISC considera
tion at City College of San Fran
cisco before transferring to San
Jose. They are halfback Dave
Kingsley and fullback Ed Zumot.
Other Spartan defensemen are
Valdis Svans, Diet war Demeter
and Slobodan Caleb.
STANFORD Coach Fred Prid

die, while not fearing the Spar
lons and predicting a Stanford
victory, says that San Jose is a
good team, not having hit its po
tentiality yet this year. He thinks
that even if they hit it against
Stanford, the Big Red should win
anyway.

Stanford's starting goalie will
probably be Kent Mueller, though
Tom Paulsen should see action.
Starting forwards will be
chosen from among A1 Nnoli,
Larry Chukwudebe, Stu Rawl
ings, Don Griffith, Ed Clark, and
Klas Bergman.
Beep! Beep! Whoosh!
The blur (hat you just missed
seeing was the San Jose State
soccer team. The Spartans, fea
turing three men capable of run
ning the 100-yard dash in 9,5 or
better, invade Stanford tomorrow
