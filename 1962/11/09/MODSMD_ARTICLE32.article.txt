# Water Poloisfs Attempt To Drown Unbeaten USC
## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
j The Stanford water polo team
i will seek revenge tomorrow morn
, ing at 11, when powerful USC
j comes to Palo Alto. The Trojans J
j are the only college team with a
j convincing defeat over the Tribe I
| this season. Two weeks ago USC
i outplayed and outscored Stanford I
■ 8-3 in Los Angeles.
Last weekend, however, the In
i dians, disgusted with their sloppy
; play and two losses of the pre
j vious week, turned in three im
pressive wins, against UCLA,
Long Beach Stale, and San Jose
State. Thus, Stanford is in a fine
position to avenge its disappoint
| ing previous performance against
I the Trojans.
The Trojans presently lead the
AAWU with a record of 5-0. With
two wins and two losses, Stanford
is in second place. If the Tribe
beats USC, they have a chance to
tie for first place, should the Tro
jans lose a second conference
game.
SC has a balanced team, with
; no outstanding players. Stanford
j is known as a fast-break team, but
j the Trojans use this method of
| attack even more.
The Indians play Fullerton Jun-
I ior College today at 3:30. Fuller-
I ton is the best junior college team
jin the country, even better than j
I Cerritos, whom Stanford edged by j
j the slim margin of 5-3 earlier this
I season.
I Tomorrow morning at 10:00, the,
| Stanford freshman will play near
| by Menlo-Atherton High School,
j the finest high school team in
j northern California. The fresh-!
' rnan team has been steadily im-1
| proving and last weekend snapped |
1 the San Jose State frosh winning j

streak. Menlo Atherton and Stan
ford are the only teams who have
defeated the powerful Spartan
freshmen this season.
