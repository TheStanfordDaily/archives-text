# Indian Students Discuss Effect of Chinese Attack
## 
### KENT SMITH 
The Chinese invasion of north
ern India will have “long range
effects” both in Asia and the
world, three Indian students
agreed in an interview last week
at the International Center.

Singh Walia, Special Program
Ph.D. candidate, said that India
is very likely to alter her tradi
tional policy of nonalignment and
shift “toward the West” because
in “the hour of crisis” help is
coming from the West,
WALIA ADDED that “it would

have been inopportune for the
United States to put any pre-con
ditions to its arms assistance.
This will have a good psychologi
cal effect by making acceptance
of the arms ‘volitional’ on the
part of India.”
It is not “a physical string”
that now ties India to the free
world, said Bal Jindal, Mining
Engineering graduate student,
"hut rather a psychological one.”
“Perhaps it is the stronger
string,” he added.
Praising the “spontaneous giv
ing” fi'om the United States, Gita
Kulshreshtha, Education gradu
ate student, said that “America
has probably done the best thing
that she could do.”
REFERRING TO a letter she
had received from India, Gita re
ported an “awakening to the dan
gers of Communism” and a “defi
nite antagonism" toward its poli
cies.

All three expressed great con
fidence in the Indian leaders, es
pecially in Prime Minister Nehru,
and they each pointed to the new
“unity and cohesion” among the
people.
The fighting, declared Walia, is
bound to have a “derogatory ef
fect on Indo-Soviet relations”: it
has “brought into sharp focus the
naked motivations of the Com
munist bloc,” he said,
RUSSIA HAS “let India down,”
said Gita. Nevertheless, Jindal
cautioned, India will go to “no
vast extremes” in response to the
crisis.
The influence of India’s Com
munist Party lias greatly declin
ed. the three foreign students
agreed.
Walia quoted the Hindustan
Times as saying that the Commu
nists, an officially recognized
party in India, “wavered for ton
days before coming out openly
against Chinese aggression.”
"Their indecisiveness was ex
pensive,” said Walia.
IF THE Communists had not
supported the government, “they
would have received no backing
at all,” said Jindal, because “the
nationalism feeling rose so great
ly.”
He pointed to West Bengal
State, which had been “considered
a Communist stronghold.” Dur
ing the 1962 elections, however,
their influence “fell badly.”
“Their hold has declined” all over
India, declared Jindal.
Asked why India still continues
to support the admission of Com
munist China to the U.N., Jindal
explained that China, by not be
ing a member, is therefore not
under the provisions of the U.N.
Charter.
MEMBERSHIP “might have an
effect on China’s policies,” he
said. However, Jindal added, it
would “be hard to say” what In
dia’s position on the issue will be
next year.
Commenting on the real nature
of the fighting, Walia said that it
was “primarily an ideological
war” between Communism and
democracy. “The area in dispute

does not itself have economic im
portance,” he added.
Jindal noted that both China and
India face “similar problems of
population and hunger” and that
the outcome of their rivalry “will
have a powerful impact upon the
younger nations."
IN SPITE OF the new require
ments of war on the economy of
India, Walia pointed to Nehru’s
statement in the Hindustan Times
that “the third o-Year Plan will
not he changed.” Jindal also ex
pected no “big changes,” especial
ly “no immediate production of
armaments."
Asked how Gandhi might han
dle the present crisis, Gita said,
“1 don’t think there is anything
else to do when they are fighting
at your doorstep," liut, she added,
the problem with the British "was
not comparable”; at that time
there was “no immediate dan
ger.”

ing the 1962 elections, however,
their influence “fell badly.”
“Their hold has declined” all over
India, declared Jindal.
Asked why India still continues
to support the admission of Com
munist China to the U.N., Jindal
explained that China, by not be
ing a member, is therefore not
under the provisions of the U.N.
Charter.
MEMBERSHIP “might have an
effect on China’s policies,” he
said. However, Jindal added, it
would “be hard to say” what In
dia’s position on the issue will be
next year.
Commenting on the real nature
of the fighting, Walia said that it
was “primarily an ideological
war” between Communism and
democracy. “The area in dispute

does not itself have economic im
portance,” he added.
Jindal noted that both China and
India face “similar problems of
population and hunger” and that
the outcome of their rivalry “will
have a powerful impact upon the
younger nations."
IN SPITE OF the new require
ments of war on the economy of
India, Walia pointed to Nehru’s
statement in the Hindustan Times
that “the third o-Year Plan will
not he changed.” Jindal also ex
pected no “big changes,” especial
ly “no immediate production of
armaments."
Asked how Gandhi might han
dle the present crisis, Gita said,
“1 don’t think there is anything
else to do when they are fighting
at your doorstep," liut, she added,
the problem with the British "was
not comparable”; at that time
there was “no immediate dan
ger.”
The Chinese invasion of north
ern India will have “long range
effects” both in Asia and the
world, three Indian students
agreed in an interview last week
at the International Center.

Singh Walia, Special Program
Ph.D. candidate, said that India
is very likely to alter her tradi
tional policy of nonalignment and
shift “toward the West” because
in “the hour of crisis” help is
coming from the West,
WALIA ADDED that “it would

have been inopportune for the
United States to put any pre-con
ditions to its arms assistance.
This will have a good psychologi
cal effect by making acceptance
of the arms ‘volitional’ on the
part of India.”
It is not “a physical string”
that now ties India to the free
world, said Bal Jindal, Mining
Engineering graduate student,
"hut rather a psychological one.”
“Perhaps it is the stronger
string,” he added.
Praising the “spontaneous giv
ing” fi'om the United States, Gita
Kulshreshtha, Education gradu
ate student, said that “America
has probably done the best thing
that she could do.”
REFERRING TO a letter she
had received from India, Gita re
ported an “awakening to the dan
gers of Communism” and a “defi
nite antagonism" toward its poli
cies.

All three expressed great con
fidence in the Indian leaders, es
pecially in Prime Minister Nehru,
and they each pointed to the new
“unity and cohesion” among the
people.
The fighting, declared Walia, is
bound to have a “derogatory ef
fect on Indo-Soviet relations”: it
has “brought into sharp focus the
naked motivations of the Com
munist bloc,” he said,
RUSSIA HAS “let India down,”
said Gita. Nevertheless, Jindal
cautioned, India will go to “no
vast extremes” in response to the
crisis.
The influence of India’s Com
munist Party lias greatly declin
ed. the three foreign students
agreed.
Walia quoted the Hindustan
Times as saying that the Commu
nists, an officially recognized
party in India, “wavered for ton
days before coming out openly
against Chinese aggression.”
"Their indecisiveness was ex
pensive,” said Walia.

ing” fi'om the United States, Gita
Kulshreshtha, Education gradu
ate student, said that “America
has probably done the best thing
that she could do.”
REFERRING TO a letter she
had received from India, Gita re
ported an “awakening to the dan
gers of Communism” and a “defi
nite antagonism" toward its poli
cies.

All three expressed great con
fidence in the Indian leaders, es
pecially in Prime Minister Nehru,
and they each pointed to the new
“unity and cohesion” among the
people.
The fighting, declared Walia, is
bound to have a “derogatory ef
fect on Indo-Soviet relations”: it
has “brought into sharp focus the
naked motivations of the Com
munist bloc,” he said,
RUSSIA HAS “let India down,”
said Gita. Nevertheless, Jindal
cautioned, India will go to “no
vast extremes” in response to the
crisis.
The influence of India’s Com
munist Party lias greatly declin
ed. the three foreign students
agreed.
Walia quoted the Hindustan
Times as saying that the Commu
nists, an officially recognized
party in India, “wavered for ton
days before coming out openly
against Chinese aggression.”
"Their indecisiveness was ex
pensive,” said Walia.
IF THE Communists had not
supported the government, “they
would have received no backing
at all,” said Jindal, because “the
nationalism feeling rose so great
ly.”
He pointed to West Bengal
State, which had been “considered
a Communist stronghold.” Dur
ing the 1962 elections, however,
their influence “fell badly.”
“Their hold has declined” all over
India, declared Jindal.
Asked why India still continues
to support the admission of Com
munist China to the U.N., Jindal
explained that China, by not be
ing a member, is therefore not
under the provisions of the U.N.
Charter.
MEMBERSHIP “might have an
effect on China’s policies,” he
said. However, Jindal added, it
would “be hard to say” what In
dia’s position on the issue will be
next year.
Commenting on the real nature
of the fighting, Walia said that it
was “primarily an ideological
war” between Communism and
democracy. “The area in dispute

does not itself have economic im
portance,” he added.
Jindal noted that both China and
India face “similar problems of
population and hunger” and that
the outcome of their rivalry “will
have a powerful impact upon the
younger nations."
IN SPITE OF the new require
ments of war on the economy of
India, Walia pointed to Nehru’s
statement in the Hindustan Times
that “the third o-Year Plan will
not he changed.” Jindal also ex
pected no “big changes,” especial
ly “no immediate production of
armaments."
Asked how Gandhi might han
dle the present crisis, Gita said,
“1 don’t think there is anything
else to do when they are fighting
at your doorstep," liut, she added,
the problem with the British "was
not comparable”; at that time
there was “no immediate dan
ger.”
The Chinese invasion of north
ern India will have “long range
effects” both in Asia and the
world, three Indian students
agreed in an interview last week
at the International Center.

Singh Walia, Special Program
Ph.D. candidate, said that India
is very likely to alter her tradi
tional policy of nonalignment and
shift “toward the West” because
in “the hour of crisis” help is
coming from the West,
WALIA ADDED that “it would

have been inopportune for the
United States to put any pre-con
ditions to its arms assistance.
This will have a good psychologi
cal effect by making acceptance
of the arms ‘volitional’ on the
part of India.”
It is not “a physical string”
that now ties India to the free
world, said Bal Jindal, Mining
Engineering graduate student,
"hut rather a psychological one.”
“Perhaps it is the stronger
string,” he added.
