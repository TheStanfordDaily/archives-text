# Major Changes Made In Int'l Student Program
## 
### SUSAN BROWN 
Major reorientation and reor
ganization of all the manifold as
pects of the foreign student pro
grams at Stanford, together with
reallocation and expansion of ex
isting funds, are underway as a
result of recommendations made
by the Special Committee for
Foreign Scholarship Problems.
The Committee, composed of
about ten student, faculty, and
administration members, conduct
ed a year-long survey of existing
foreign student programs.
THE PRESENT ASSU Scholar
program, within the next three
years, probably will be replaced
by a greatly expanded program
designed to bring more students
from the underdeveloped lands
to Stanford (possibly in conjunc
tion with exchanges) and to grant
scholarships to highly qualified
foreign students who are already
at Stanford.
The Foreign Scholarship Com
mission (FSC) program, which
until now has been of direct bene
fit only to the annual ten ASSU
Scholars, will be expanded so as
to reach the entire foreign stu
dent population.
Rationale behind this major
change lies in the desire to bring
foreign student programs, includ
ing the ASSU Scholar Program,
up to date. When the ASSU
Scholarships were established by
a student referendum in 1948,
there was a great need to intro
duce European students—leaders
in student as well as academic af
fairs—to the Stanford campus.
THE FSC, composed solely of
students, was established for the
purpose of selecting the Scholars,
planning for them programs
which would increase their
knowledge and understanding of
the U.S., and helping to integrate
them into student affairs on cam
pus, in order to maximize the re
ciprocal benefits to be derived
from their presence at Stanford.
Under the ASSU Scholar pro
gram, each year about ten schol
ars have received full scholar
ships, supported by ASSU, Uni
versity, and Jiving group funds.
Today, so many Stanford stu
dents are now introduced to the
European continent directly, and
so many new kinds of scholar
ships are offered to European
students for study in the U.S., the
original need for Stanford to
bring European students to the
campus has greatly diminished.
AT THE SAME time, since 1948,
the foreign student population
has grown from about 150 to over
650 students, now representing
over 70 countries. A large portion

of these students have been lead
ers in their countries in academic
and student affairs.

But because of the set-up of the
foreign student programs on cam
pus, many of these people have
been overlooked. As a result,
Stanford students and faculty
have missed out on valuable op
portunities to learn from the stu
dents, and the foreign students
themselves have not had the op
portunities to learn many of the
things for which they came. Oft
en, after a year, they have re
turned to their home count ides,
only because of a lack of funds,
leaving Stanford with their work
unfinished.

Under the new plans, a survey
is underway to evaluate the ex
tent of the human resources rep
resented among the foreign stu
dents at Stanford. With this as a
basis, the FSC programs of semi
nars, trips, and personal aid to
help the foreign students benefit
most from their study at Stan
ford, will be expanded to embrace
the entire 650 instead of just ten.
In addition, qualified foreign stu
dents will be invited to give guest
lectures in classes as well as for
campus and community organiza
tions.

THREE DIVISIONS of the HR
have been greatly affected by
this new proposal. The Interna
tional Division, headed by Gor
don Adams, will be in charge of
on-campus foreign student activi
ties, such as I-Club, the pie-regis
tration program, and a proposed
people-to-people program. The
Education Desk, under the direc
tion of Bill Rentz, will handle a
speakers’ bureau. The area desks,
representing Africa, Asia, Europe,
and Latin America, under the di
rection of the Affiliations Divis
ion, which is headed by Jim
Clause, will broaden their ac
tivities.

Acting on the principle that
specialized interest will be more
efficient and thorough, during
the next three years the area
desks will take over the selection
of those scholars who until now
have been chosen by the P’SC,
making the latter organization
more of a co-ordinating board.
The present Berlin and Keio
University (Japan) affiliations
and annual student exchanges,
which up to now have been oper
ated jointly by the UR and the
FSC, will continue, and it is
hoped that new affiliations and
student exchanges will be opened
this year with African and Latin
American universities.
THE ACTIVITIES of the Latin
American Desk, chaired by
Charlie Kendall, exemplify those
of other area desks. Latin Ameri
ca Desk holds bi-weekly lunch
eons for Latin American and U.S.
students and sponsors weekly
seminars or panel discussions.
Its members publish a bi-quar
terly Latin American affairs
newsletter and exchange it with
the university in Caracas, Vene
zuela, and are developing an af
filiation program with a universi
ty in Latin America. The Desk is
exploring the possibility of work
ing with the State Department on
cultural exchanges, and next
quarter will make information
available to students interested in
teaching in Latin America.
The Special Committee's rec
ommendations also included mak
ing more on-campus living space
available to foreign students, and
expansion of the dining hall eat
ing program which has been es
tablished by the HR.

tivities.

Acting on the principle that
specialized interest will be more
efficient and thorough, during
the next three years the area
desks will take over the selection
of those scholars who until now
have been chosen by the P’SC,
making the latter organization
more of a co-ordinating board.
The present Berlin and Keio
University (Japan) affiliations
and annual student exchanges,
which up to now have been oper
ated jointly by the UR and the
FSC, will continue, and it is
hoped that new affiliations and
student exchanges will be opened
this year with African and Latin
American universities.
THE ACTIVITIES of the Latin
American Desk, chaired by
Charlie Kendall, exemplify those
of other area desks. Latin Ameri
ca Desk holds bi-weekly lunch
eons for Latin American and U.S.
students and sponsors weekly
seminars or panel discussions.
Its members publish a bi-quar
terly Latin American affairs
newsletter and exchange it with
the university in Caracas, Vene
zuela, and are developing an af
filiation program with a universi
ty in Latin America. The Desk is
exploring the possibility of work
ing with the State Department on
cultural exchanges, and next
quarter will make information
available to students interested in
teaching in Latin America.
The Special Committee's rec
ommendations also included mak
ing more on-campus living space
available to foreign students, and
expansion of the dining hall eat
ing program which has been es
tablished by the HR.
Major reorientation and reor
ganization of all the manifold as
pects of the foreign student pro
grams at Stanford, together with
reallocation and expansion of ex
isting funds, are underway as a
result of recommendations made
by the Special Committee for
Foreign Scholarship Problems.
The Committee, composed of
about ten student, faculty, and
administration members, conduct
ed a year-long survey of existing
foreign student programs.
THE PRESENT ASSU Scholar
program, within the next three
years, probably will be replaced
by a greatly expanded program
designed to bring more students
from the underdeveloped lands
to Stanford (possibly in conjunc
tion with exchanges) and to grant
scholarships to highly qualified
foreign students who are already
at Stanford.
The Foreign Scholarship Com
mission (FSC) program, which
until now has been of direct bene
fit only to the annual ten ASSU
Scholars, will be expanded so as
to reach the entire foreign stu
dent population.
Rationale behind this major
change lies in the desire to bring
foreign student programs, includ
ing the ASSU Scholar Program,
up to date. When the ASSU
Scholarships were established by
a student referendum in 1948,
there was a great need to intro
duce European students—leaders
in student as well as academic af
fairs—to the Stanford campus.
THE FSC, composed solely of
students, was established for the
purpose of selecting the Scholars,
planning for them programs
which would increase their
knowledge and understanding of
the U.S., and helping to integrate
them into student affairs on cam
pus, in order to maximize the re
ciprocal benefits to be derived
from their presence at Stanford.
Under the ASSU Scholar pro
gram, each year about ten schol
ars have received full scholar
ships, supported by ASSU, Uni
versity, and Jiving group funds.
Today, so many Stanford stu
dents are now introduced to the
European continent directly, and
so many new kinds of scholar
ships are offered to European
students for study in the U.S., the
original need for Stanford to
bring European students to the
campus has greatly diminished.
AT THE SAME time, since 1948,
the foreign student population
has grown from about 150 to over
650 students, now representing
over 70 countries. A large portion

of these students have been lead
ers in their countries in academic
and student affairs.

But because of the set-up of the
foreign student programs on cam
pus, many of these people have
been overlooked. As a result,
Stanford students and faculty
have missed out on valuable op
portunities to learn from the stu
dents, and the foreign students
themselves have not had the op
portunities to learn many of the
things for which they came. Oft
en, after a year, they have re
turned to their home count ides,
only because of a lack of funds,
leaving Stanford with their work
unfinished.

Under the new plans, a survey
is underway to evaluate the ex
tent of the human resources rep
resented among the foreign stu
dents at Stanford. With this as a
basis, the FSC programs of semi
nars, trips, and personal aid to
help the foreign students benefit
most from their study at Stan
ford, will be expanded to embrace
the entire 650 instead of just ten.
In addition, qualified foreign stu
dents will be invited to give guest
lectures in classes as well as for
campus and community organiza
tions.

THREE DIVISIONS of the HR
have been greatly affected by
this new proposal. The Interna
tional Division, headed by Gor
don Adams, will be in charge of
on-campus foreign student activi
ties, such as I-Club, the pie-regis
tration program, and a proposed
people-to-people program. The
Education Desk, under the direc
tion of Bill Rentz, will handle a
speakers’ bureau. The area desks,
representing Africa, Asia, Europe,
and Latin America, under the di
rection of the Affiliations Divis
ion, which is headed by Jim
Clause, will broaden their ac

portunities to learn from the stu
dents, and the foreign students
themselves have not had the op
portunities to learn many of the
things for which they came. Oft
en, after a year, they have re
turned to their home count ides,
only because of a lack of funds,
leaving Stanford with their work
unfinished.

Under the new plans, a survey
is underway to evaluate the ex
tent of the human resources rep
resented among the foreign stu
dents at Stanford. With this as a
basis, the FSC programs of semi
nars, trips, and personal aid to
help the foreign students benefit
most from their study at Stan
ford, will be expanded to embrace
the entire 650 instead of just ten.
In addition, qualified foreign stu
dents will be invited to give guest
lectures in classes as well as for
campus and community organiza
tions.

THREE DIVISIONS of the HR
have been greatly affected by
this new proposal. The Interna
tional Division, headed by Gor
don Adams, will be in charge of
on-campus foreign student activi
ties, such as I-Club, the pie-regis
tration program, and a proposed
people-to-people program. The
Education Desk, under the direc
tion of Bill Rentz, will handle a
speakers’ bureau. The area desks,
representing Africa, Asia, Europe,
and Latin America, under the di
rection of the Affiliations Divis
ion, which is headed by Jim
Clause, will broaden their ac
tivities.

Acting on the principle that
specialized interest will be more
efficient and thorough, during
the next three years the area
desks will take over the selection
of those scholars who until now
have been chosen by the P’SC,
making the latter organization
more of a co-ordinating board.
The present Berlin and Keio
University (Japan) affiliations
and annual student exchanges,
which up to now have been oper
ated jointly by the UR and the
FSC, will continue, and it is
hoped that new affiliations and
student exchanges will be opened
this year with African and Latin
American universities.
THE ACTIVITIES of the Latin
American Desk, chaired by
Charlie Kendall, exemplify those
of other area desks. Latin Ameri
ca Desk holds bi-weekly lunch
eons for Latin American and U.S.
students and sponsors weekly
seminars or panel discussions.
Its members publish a bi-quar
terly Latin American affairs
newsletter and exchange it with
the university in Caracas, Vene
zuela, and are developing an af
filiation program with a universi
ty in Latin America. The Desk is
exploring the possibility of work
ing with the State Department on
cultural exchanges, and next
quarter will make information
available to students interested in
teaching in Latin America.
The Special Committee's rec
ommendations also included mak
ing more on-campus living space
available to foreign students, and
expansion of the dining hall eat
ing program which has been es
tablished by the HR.
Major reorientation and reor
ganization of all the manifold as
pects of the foreign student pro
grams at Stanford, together with
reallocation and expansion of ex
isting funds, are underway as a
result of recommendations made
by the Special Committee for
Foreign Scholarship Problems.
The Committee, composed of
about ten student, faculty, and
administration members, conduct
ed a year-long survey of existing
foreign student programs.
THE PRESENT ASSU Scholar
program, within the next three
years, probably will be replaced
by a greatly expanded program
designed to bring more students
from the underdeveloped lands
to Stanford (possibly in conjunc
tion with exchanges) and to grant
scholarships to highly qualified
foreign students who are already
at Stanford.
The Foreign Scholarship Com
mission (FSC) program, which
until now has been of direct bene
fit only to the annual ten ASSU
Scholars, will be expanded so as
to reach the entire foreign stu
dent population.
Rationale behind this major
change lies in the desire to bring
foreign student programs, includ
ing the ASSU Scholar Program,
up to date. When the ASSU
Scholarships were established by
a student referendum in 1948,
there was a great need to intro
duce European students—leaders
in student as well as academic af
fairs—to the Stanford campus.
THE FSC, composed solely of
students, was established for the
purpose of selecting the Scholars,
planning for them programs
which would increase their
knowledge and understanding of
the U.S., and helping to integrate
them into student affairs on cam
pus, in order to maximize the re
ciprocal benefits to be derived
from their presence at Stanford.
Under the ASSU Scholar pro
gram, each year about ten schol
ars have received full scholar
ships, supported by ASSU, Uni
versity, and Jiving group funds.
Today, so many Stanford stu
dents are now introduced to the
European continent directly, and
so many new kinds of scholar
ships are offered to European
students for study in the U.S., the
original need for Stanford to
bring European students to the
campus has greatly diminished.
AT THE SAME time, since 1948,
the foreign student population
has grown from about 150 to over
650 students, now representing
over 70 countries. A large portion

of these students have been lead
ers in their countries in academic
and student affairs.

But because of the set-up of the
foreign student programs on cam
pus, many of these people have
been overlooked. As a result,
Stanford students and faculty
have missed out on valuable op
portunities to learn from the stu
dents, and the foreign students
themselves have not had the op
