# Endowed History Chair
## 
### 
The University has recently announced that it has been Riven
money to endow another professorship in the History Department.
The novel feature of the gift is that it will provide for the annual
appointment of a European professor to teach here as a Visiting
Professor. According to Vice-Provost Robert Wert, the search for
a scholar to hold the Chair for the next academic year is presently
underway.

This new endowed professorship will vitalize further an al
ready outstanding department, but the establishment of this new
Chair has a meaning that is not confined to the context of the
History Department alone. The new Chair suggests that the Uni-

versity is increasingly able to look to European universities for
scholars to visit Stanford in a teaching capacity.
However, the University will not be hiring professors from
Europe in the same way or on the same scale as they have been
raiding East Coast universities, for these raids have meant the
addition of 125 new faculty members in the last 18 months. Al
though this figure does not represent the net change in the size of
the faculty, it does indicate the kind of expansion which the $lOO
million PACE fund drive is making possible.
This expansion is giving new depth to the faculties of most
departments. And although new appointments are frequently
made to strengthen a department’s graduate instruction, the result
always is to improve the department’s undergraduate instruction,
too. In the case of the newly endowed history professorship, the
University expects that the recipient will teach courses to hoth
graduate students and undergraduates. The upshot will he to
strengthen hoth the graduate and undergraduate divisions.
Similar endowed professorships, if instituted in many other
departments in the humanities, could remake Stanford’s reputa
tion—a reputation that lingers even as it becomes less and less
accurate: that Stanford is a great technological institute and sci
ence center, but that as a university of the humanities, Stanford
is not of the first rank. This reputation persists even as humanists
of international reputation join the University’s faculty.
The present vitality of the History Department and its increas
ing vitality is evident, the new Chair being partial evidence. And
this same evidence supports the conclusion that the University’s
concern for the humanities is real and, occasionally, dramatic.

This expansion is giving new depth to the faculties of most
departments. And although new appointments are frequently
made to strengthen a department’s graduate instruction, the result
always is to improve the department’s undergraduate instruction,
too. In the case of the newly endowed history professorship, the
University expects that the recipient will teach courses to hoth
graduate students and undergraduates. The upshot will he to
strengthen hoth the graduate and undergraduate divisions.
Similar endowed professorships, if instituted in many other
departments in the humanities, could remake Stanford’s reputa
tion—a reputation that lingers even as it becomes less and less
accurate: that Stanford is a great technological institute and sci
ence center, but that as a university of the humanities, Stanford
is not of the first rank. This reputation persists even as humanists
of international reputation join the University’s faculty.
The present vitality of the History Department and its increas
ing vitality is evident, the new Chair being partial evidence. And
this same evidence supports the conclusion that the University’s
concern for the humanities is real and, occasionally, dramatic.
The University has recently announced that it has been Riven
money to endow another professorship in the History Department.
The novel feature of the gift is that it will provide for the annual
appointment of a European professor to teach here as a Visiting
Professor. According to Vice-Provost Robert Wert, the search for
a scholar to hold the Chair for the next academic year is presently
underway.

This new endowed professorship will vitalize further an al
ready outstanding department, but the establishment of this new
Chair has a meaning that is not confined to the context of the
History Department alone. The new Chair suggests that the Uni-

versity is increasingly able to look to European universities for
scholars to visit Stanford in a teaching capacity.
However, the University will not be hiring professors from
Europe in the same way or on the same scale as they have been
raiding East Coast universities, for these raids have meant the
addition of 125 new faculty members in the last 18 months. Al
though this figure does not represent the net change in the size of
the faculty, it does indicate the kind of expansion which the $lOO
million PACE fund drive is making possible.
