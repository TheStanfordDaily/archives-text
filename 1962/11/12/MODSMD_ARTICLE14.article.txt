# RECORD REVIEW
## 'Veritas' Distributing Record By Joan Baez as an Unknown 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
Veritas Cultural Records, who
recorded Joan Baez when she was
virtually unknown, has begun to
distribute this first recording,
“Folk Singers ’Round Harvard
Square.” For many listeners, the
quiet coffee-house atmosphere of
this original album may prove a
relief from the “public personali
ty” which Miss Baez has increas
ingly adopted on her Vanguard
disks.

Miss Baez shares the album
with Bill Wood, then a Harvard
senior, who has since done gradu
ate work in bio-chemistry here at
Stanford, and by Ted Alevizos, a
vigorous Boston singer of Greek
songs and English ballads. Bill
Wood joins Miss Baez in duets
for a third of the first side, and
the two of them are joined by
Alevizos in the last band of the
second side.

There is a dreamlike quality
about the six solos which Miss
Baez is allotted, most evident in
the flowing “Lowlands.” “Banks
of the Ohio” sounds quite differ
ent without the assistance (or
was it interference?) of the
Greenbriar Boys of Volume Two.
“O What a Beautiful City” and
“What You Gonna Call Your
Pretty Little Baby” emerge as
out of a swirling mist; and Miss
Baez achieves a successful cross
racial adaptation of Odetta’s

"Sail Away, Ladies.” Two of the
duets seem undistinguished; but
Miss Baez’s soprano is beautifully
counterpointed by Bill Wood in
“Kitty.”
Both Bill Wood and Ted Ale
vizos bring forth solo perform
ances equal to Miss Baez’s. One
of the most amusing songs
around is Bill Wood’s “Le Cheval
Dans La Beignoire,” consisting
of a deadpan English joke about,
a dead horse in the bathtub, fol
lowed by a breathless French
song repeating the story. Wood’s
versatile guitar and flexible sing
ing bring forth effective inter
pretations of “John Henry,”
“Travelin’ Shoes,” and “The Bold
Soldier.” Alevizos’ best is “As
trapsen (The Sun Is Risen”;
“Lass from the Low Country”
runs a close second.

This album was originally re
leased in a limited edition; it
may have since been re-recorded
from the original tapes. At any
rate, copies have been turning up
sporadically in this area. It might
also be available directly from
Veritas (Copley Square, Boston,
Massachusetts).

“Folk Singers ’Round Harvard
Square” is a record which anyone
who likes Joan Baez can be proud
to own. It emanates that rare
quality which seems already to
be disappearing on the first Van
guard album; that of a voice cry
ing out of the wilderness.

quality which seems already to
be disappearing on the first Van
guard album; that of a voice cry
ing out of the wilderness.
Veritas Cultural Records, who
recorded Joan Baez when she was
virtually unknown, has begun to
distribute this first recording,
“Folk Singers ’Round Harvard
Square.” For many listeners, the
quiet coffee-house atmosphere of
this original album may prove a
relief from the “public personali
ty” which Miss Baez has increas
ingly adopted on her Vanguard
disks.

Miss Baez shares the album
with Bill Wood, then a Harvard
senior, who has since done gradu
ate work in bio-chemistry here at
Stanford, and by Ted Alevizos, a
vigorous Boston singer of Greek
songs and English ballads. Bill
Wood joins Miss Baez in duets
for a third of the first side, and
the two of them are joined by
Alevizos in the last band of the
second side.

There is a dreamlike quality
about the six solos which Miss
Baez is allotted, most evident in
the flowing “Lowlands.” “Banks
of the Ohio” sounds quite differ
ent without the assistance (or
was it interference?) of the
Greenbriar Boys of Volume Two.
“O What a Beautiful City” and
“What You Gonna Call Your
Pretty Little Baby” emerge as
out of a swirling mist; and Miss
Baez achieves a successful cross
racial adaptation of Odetta’s

"Sail Away, Ladies.” Two of the
duets seem undistinguished; but
Miss Baez’s soprano is beautifully
counterpointed by Bill Wood in
“Kitty.”
Both Bill Wood and Ted Ale
vizos bring forth solo perform
ances equal to Miss Baez’s. One
of the most amusing songs
around is Bill Wood’s “Le Cheval
Dans La Beignoire,” consisting
of a deadpan English joke about,
a dead horse in the bathtub, fol
lowed by a breathless French
song repeating the story. Wood’s
versatile guitar and flexible sing
ing bring forth effective inter
pretations of “John Henry,”
“Travelin’ Shoes,” and “The Bold
Soldier.” Alevizos’ best is “As
trapsen (The Sun Is Risen”;
“Lass from the Low Country”
runs a close second.

This album was originally re
leased in a limited edition; it
may have since been re-recorded
from the original tapes. At any
rate, copies have been turning up
sporadically in this area. It might
also be available directly from
Veritas (Copley Square, Boston,
Massachusetts).
