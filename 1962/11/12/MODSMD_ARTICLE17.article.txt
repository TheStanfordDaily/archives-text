## Shirer: Two Germanies Preferable to Reunification 
### Bv GARY GREEN 
“A journalist who has lived through a period of history is at
least as qualified to write history as a professor of history,” stated
journalist-historian William L. Shirer in an interview at the
Hoover Institute Friday.
Shirer, whose best-selling book “The Rise and Fall of the Third

Reich” has been a subject of corH
troversy on two continents, was
at Stanford to do research for a
book about the collapse of the
Third Republic in France. ‘‘You
get ticketed in a subject in this
country,” he explained in answer
to a question about his reasons
for changing his field of study.
“I’ve spent about as much time
in France as in Germany,” he
added. His new book will cover
the period of the Third Republic,
ending with the establishment of
the Vichy regime in 1940.
SHIRER acknowledged that a
groat many more documents on
the topic are available than he
had initially realized. A consider
able portion of the book will in
volve the military aspects of the
collapse.
Shirer, who has been severely
criticized for his characteriza
tion of the German people, ex
pressed considerable caution
about any attempt to define “na
tional traits” in a people. ‘Tve
been clobbered on this,” he added
with an experienced smile.
He approached the current
Franco-German rapprochement
with guarded optimism. “You
can’t help but welcome it,” he
said, but he also acknowledged the
possibility that it may be “just
an agreement between two old
men.” “I’m slightly skeptical
till I see,” he concluded.
A REVIVAL of either German
or French militarism is always
possible, according to Shirer, but
two major realities in the present
European situation have greatly
reduced this danger. He first
cited the existence of a powerful
Russian nation. France or Ger
many “couldn’t afford militar
ism” with Russians at the Elbe.
The second factor is the Com
mon Market and the trend toward
European unity.
The recent incident in West
Germany in which the editors of
the magazine “Der Spiegel” were
jailed and accused of treason was
taken by Shirer as an example of
the shallowness and vulnerability
of German democracy. He felt
that the worst accusation that
would be made in a similar case
in the United States would be
bribing an official. He said that
the most serious charge which
“Der Spiegel” apparently made
was to the effect that the Ger
man army is not very good
(“which makes me feel pretty
good,” Shirer added).
He agreed that much of the
problem in Europe today is po
litical apathy produced by ma
terial wealth. But this attitude
apparently does not seem too
serious to Shirer. who referred to
Europe’s materialism as “a new
toy.”
H E STRONGLY criticized
American policy toward Ger
many at several points. “Our gov
ernment has been 100 per cent
pro-Adenauer,” he claimed. There
has been more citicism of the
Chancellor among German intel
lectual circles than is apparent
in the American press, he stated.
Asked his opinion of Adenauer,
Shirer said:“He’s like a guy you
had in California. He just wanted
to cling to power.”
He called a two-Germany
American policy “the only policy
that makes any sense.” Not only
the Soviet Union but our Western
Allies are opposed to reunifica
tion of Germany, he stated. He
admitted, however, that we had
committed ourselves to the point
where it would be difficult to
carry out such a drastic revision
of policy. Although he believes
that serious discussion of a new
German policy is taking place in

Washington, he was pessimistic
about the response by the Ameri
can public, which would probably
see the change as “appeasement.”
While refusing to be a prophet,
Shirer had some comments on the
political futures of France and
Germany. “What I’d like to see,”
he said, “is young men coming
up in the parties in France.” He
would welcome some new leader
ship with “the toughness of Cle
menceau.”

In reference to the German po
litical future, Shirer discussed
Ludwig Erhardt, minister of eco
nomics, as a possible successor to
Adenauer. He said that he likes
Erhardt better personally as well
as favoring his political policies.
Erhardt, he felt, would be more
favorably disposed to Britain.
