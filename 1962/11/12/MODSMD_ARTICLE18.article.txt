Editor, The Daily:
It was with some dismay that
we noted the presence of several
high school busses as we parked
near Memorial Auditorium for
Thursday evening’s performance
of “Macbeth,” but the audience
proved far worse than we could
have expected. An undercurrent
of chatter and giggles continued
throughout the play, and loud
guffaws greeted Lady Macbeth’s
“out damned spot” scene and
drowned the actors’ voices as
Macbeth donned his armor. The
dramatic duel between Macbeth
and Matduff nearly became a
mockery as the groups of high
schoolers egged each other on to
greater and greater discourtesies.
The cast is to be commended
for bravely refusing to become
rattled and for giving what might
have been, with a sympathetic
audience, a very good and force
ful performance. But, although
the actors were given a chance to
prove their mettle, the evening
was ruined for the small portion
of the audience that really came
to see the play. In the future it
would be well to refrain from
selling large blocks of tickets to
the high schools, or at least to
devote one night exclusively to
them and to announce it as such
so that serious theatregoers could
take warning and buy tickets for
another performance.
