# House Drawing Rules Changed
## 
### PATRICIA LONG 
A new priority system will be
in effect in Thursday’s drawing
for women who wish to change
their residence.

Under the new system, women
in upperclass houses who want
to move (first movers) are third
instead of fifth in line. Sponsors,
overseas women and women who
have taken a quarter out will
have first and second priority if
they are returning to their previ
ous residence.

This change was made “be
cause of widespread criticism last
spring that upperclass girls who
wanted to move found it almost
impossible to do so.” said Barbara
Higgins, chairman of the AWS
Housing Committee. “Some girls
were even ending up in houses
they wanted less than their origi
nal one,” she added.

The priority of women who
have never been assigned to an
upperclass residence such as
sophomores overseas fall quarter

—has thus been lowered. Since
those are usually sophomores,
Miss Higgins explained, they will
be able to get used to a house
more easily, and may always
move later as a first mover.

A Court of Appeals, a proposed
addition to the housing policy,
will be voted upon at the next
AWS board meeting. If passed,
beginning winter quarter the
court would give women an op
portunity to register complaints
about housing. Whenever justi
fied, a woman’s priority status
will be adjusted through the
Court.

Drawing for changes of hous
ing next quarter will be Thurs
day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in
Room 275 of Tresidder. Women
may draw alone or in pairs only.
Friday they may look at the
list of numbers drawn and ap
proximate vacancies available
and drop out if they think their
chances of getting the desired
change are poor. Those lists will
bo posted in the Housing Office,
Room 101a on Inner Quad from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
