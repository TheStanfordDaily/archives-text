## 'Larger LASSU To Represent Students Well' 
### JOHN STEINBRUNER 
(Editor’s note: The following
article is tiie first in a four-part
series on the proposed final draft
of a new Constitution for the As
sociated Students. Today’s article
evaluates the legislative branch
as it would exist if the new Con
stitution is passed in the student
referendum on Tuesday and Wed
nesday of next week. The text of
the Constitution will be published
in The Daily this Wednesday.)

In assessing the changes pro
posed in the now legislative ar
ticle, it is necessary to consider
the general vision of student gov
ernment in which the proposal is
cast.

Organized student concern in
the educational process is begin
ning to emerge on the campus.
Students for the first time are be
ing invited to participate in vary
ing degrees and capacities in the
University policy committees ad
vising the President.
THE STUDENT Affairs and
Services Committee has five stu
dents as full members for the
first time. Dr. Wert’s housing
committee and the General
Studies Committee have both in
dicated a desire for some level of
student participation. Students
now have a major role in the ori
entation of students going to the
foreign campuses. Student educa
tional programs are proliferating
in the HR and the Political Union
and in ad hoc groups formed for
specific purposes. Matters of uni
versity policy are topics of gener
al campus discussion.

The ASSU as the central stu
dent organization is assuming an
increasingly important role in
this concern in education. When
student opinion is represented in
the decision-making process of
the University, it is done through
the ASSU.

The proposals now in process
to change the system of rush are
being developed under the joint
action of the ASSU president and
the Dean of Men. The overnight
policy generated in the Student
Affairs and Services Committee
came to the Legislature for action
of the students. To Legislature
fell the decision of reconciling the
conflicting ASSU and Board of
Trustees policies on liquor. Legis
lature recently took the initiative
in expressing student endorse
ment of proposition 13 and explic
it opposition to proposition 24
both on the California election
ballot.
THE CHARGE that student
government is not doing anything
is made these days only by a very
imperceptive person.
The increased activity of stu
dent government in developing
and articulating student convic
tions on educational policy, in the
implementation of these policies,
and in the development of educa
tional programs supplementing
the formal curriculum demands
increased involvement of the stu
dent body at large. The procedure
of representation is particularly
in need of revision. It is to this
end and in this context that the
legislative changes are proposed.
The salient feature of the ar
ticle is the increased size of the
proposed legislature. Every living
group would he represented by at
least one member with an ideal
ratio of one to seventy-five. Un
der this system many legislature
members could be elected at regu
lar living group elections, and
these would know virtually all of
(heir constituency. Communica
tion from Legislature could not
help but increase, and substantial
feed-back from the students at
large would be possible for the
first time. Under such a system
Legislature could much more
reasonably claim to represent the
student viewpoint.
Those who are mathematically
inclined will have decided that
Legislature would contain 125
members if this proposal were
enacted, and this to some has
been a point of disfavor. The as
sumption of the dissenter seems
to have been that some place be
tween 25 and 125 lies the limit of
manageability. Such an assertion
is patently absurd.
With any facility at all in the
rules of parliamentary procedure
a body this large and larger can
be handled with efficiency as was
abundantly demonstrated at the
NSA congress this summer. Fur
thermore the increased size
would allow sub-committee or
ganization which in fact would
greatly increase the operative
power of the Legislature.
The new method of representa
tion is a crucial aspect of the pro
posed constitution and should be
seen in the broad context here in
dicated. Student government is
representing the students and
will continue to do so. It should
be made representative.
