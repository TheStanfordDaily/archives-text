# Trojan Juggernaut Buries Stanford
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
The USC Trojans waited till the
end of the first half Saturday to

reveal (he offensive artistry that
should earn them a first plaee
national ranking. Then they
molded five near flawless touch
down marches in burying Stan
ford 39-14.

For nearly the entire first half,
SC toyed with the Indians in a
virtual standoff. With four min
utes left before the intermission,
SC led by a skimpy 3-0 score, had
rolled up just 110 yards as com
pared to Stanford’s 97, and had
confined its offense to power runs
inside the tackles which were
eventually contained on every
series of downs. Thus, it had been
a pretty unimpressive exhibition
for a 14-point favorite and the
second ranked team in the coun
try.

But when SC got the ball at its
own 20 with 3:55 remaining, it
went to a new style of attack.
The Trojans had tried only two
passes previously, but now they
got rid of the pigskin as if their
quarterbacks were kosher; at one
point they passed on five consecu
tive plays. Using sideline patterns
so that the receivers could step
out of bounds to stop the clock,
SC clicked off 12 plays in two
minutes and 12 seconds, going 80
yards for a touchdown and a 10-0
lead at halftime.
EARLY IN the second half, the
Indians had a couple of discour
aging incidents before SC pro
ceeded to four more TD’s and a
safety. First, they learned that a
concussion suffered by Ed Cum
mings in the second quarter
would sideline the All-AAWU
linebacker for the rest of the
game. (Cummings will play next
week). Second, after forcing
Troy to punt from inside its own
ten, safety Dick Ragsdale
dropped the punt and SC recover
ed the ball on Stanford’s 38 to
continue the havoc they had
started at the end of the first
half. On the day, they gained 216
yards rushing and 201 passing
(17/29) and made 23 first downs
from their versatile attack, which

Stanford coach Jack Curtice call- |
ed a “smorgasbord offense."
SC’S OFFENSE was a thor-,
ouhgly trained combination of in
dividual back field talent and team
organization. Nearly every play \
began with the quarterback,
either Pete Beathard or Bill Nel
sen, rolling out with excellent
protection: both the guards
would pull out from the line and
run interference along with the
fullback, while the center and
tackles would protect behind the
quarterback.
While the Stanford defensive
linemen were picking their way
through this maze of Trojan
blockers, the defensive backs
were bewildered by the quarter
backs pass-run option. If Bea
thard or Nelsen did not keep the
ball (which they did for a total
gain of 75 yards), they could
pass to their halfback, who had
gone in motion, for a consistent
gain of ten yards on a swing pass
pattern, or they could stop and
set themselves for a longer,
downfield pass.
Such long passes either set up
or accounted for four of SC’s
touchdowns. Beathard completed
passes of 2k and 38 yards to Bed
sole in the first and second scor
ing drives respectively. The third
touchdown scored on a 29-yarder
by Nelsen. Finally, in engineering
the fourth TD drive, Nelsen add
ed competions of 22 and 27 yards
to Troy’s list of aerial accom
plishments.
MEANWHILE, Stanford’s of
fense had its most productive
day; it nearly matched SC with
21 first downs while gaining 327
yards. Most impressive was the
Tribe’s passing, as quarterbacks
Clark Weaver and Steve Thur
low completed ten of 14 and ten
of 15 respectively. Weaver mixed
his throwing and his 4.7-yard
rushing average in directing
touchdown drives of 65 and 70
yards in the fourth quarter.
Frank Patitucci was the top re
ceiver with seven catches.

backs pass-run option. If Bea
thard or Nelsen did not keep the
ball (which they did for a total
gain of 75 yards), they could
pass to their halfback, who had
gone in motion, for a consistent
gain of ten yards on a swing pass
pattern, or they could stop and
set themselves for a longer,
downfield pass.
Such long passes either set up
or accounted for four of SC’s
touchdowns. Beathard completed
passes of 2k and 38 yards to Bed
sole in the first and second scor
ing drives respectively. The third
touchdown scored on a 29-yarder
by Nelsen. Finally, in engineering
the fourth TD drive, Nelsen add
ed competions of 22 and 27 yards
to Troy’s list of aerial accom
plishments.
MEANWHILE, Stanford’s of
fense had its most productive
day; it nearly matched SC with
21 first downs while gaining 327
yards. Most impressive was the
Tribe’s passing, as quarterbacks
Clark Weaver and Steve Thur
low completed ten of 14 and ten
of 15 respectively. Weaver mixed
his throwing and his 4.7-yard
rushing average in directing
touchdown drives of 65 and 70
yards in the fourth quarter.
Frank Patitucci was the top re
ceiver with seven catches.
The USC Trojans waited till the
end of the first half Saturday to

reveal (he offensive artistry that
should earn them a first plaee
national ranking. Then they
molded five near flawless touch
down marches in burying Stan
ford 39-14.

For nearly the entire first half,
SC toyed with the Indians in a
virtual standoff. With four min
utes left before the intermission,
SC led by a skimpy 3-0 score, had
rolled up just 110 yards as com
pared to Stanford’s 97, and had
confined its offense to power runs
inside the tackles which were
eventually contained on every
series of downs. Thus, it had been
a pretty unimpressive exhibition
for a 14-point favorite and the
second ranked team in the coun
try.

But when SC got the ball at its
own 20 with 3:55 remaining, it
went to a new style of attack.
The Trojans had tried only two
passes previously, but now they
got rid of the pigskin as if their
quarterbacks were kosher; at one
point they passed on five consecu
tive plays. Using sideline patterns
so that the receivers could step
out of bounds to stop the clock,
SC clicked off 12 plays in two
minutes and 12 seconds, going 80
yards for a touchdown and a 10-0
lead at halftime.
EARLY IN the second half, the
Indians had a couple of discour
aging incidents before SC pro
ceeded to four more TD’s and a
safety. First, they learned that a
concussion suffered by Ed Cum
mings in the second quarter
would sideline the All-AAWU
linebacker for the rest of the
game. (Cummings will play next
week). Second, after forcing
Troy to punt from inside its own
ten, safety Dick Ragsdale
dropped the punt and SC recover
ed the ball on Stanford’s 38 to
continue the havoc they had
started at the end of the first
half. On the day, they gained 216
yards rushing and 201 passing
(17/29) and made 23 first downs
from their versatile attack, which

Stanford coach Jack Curtice call- |
ed a “smorgasbord offense."
SC’S OFFENSE was a thor-,
ouhgly trained combination of in
dividual back field talent and team
organization. Nearly every play \
began with the quarterback,
either Pete Beathard or Bill Nel
sen, rolling out with excellent
protection: both the guards
would pull out from the line and
run interference along with the
fullback, while the center and
tackles would protect behind the
quarterback.

ceeded to four more TD’s and a
safety. First, they learned that a
concussion suffered by Ed Cum
mings in the second quarter
would sideline the All-AAWU
linebacker for the rest of the
game. (Cummings will play next
week). Second, after forcing
Troy to punt from inside its own
ten, safety Dick Ragsdale
dropped the punt and SC recover
ed the ball on Stanford’s 38 to
continue the havoc they had
started at the end of the first
half. On the day, they gained 216
yards rushing and 201 passing
(17/29) and made 23 first downs
from their versatile attack, which

Stanford coach Jack Curtice call- |
ed a “smorgasbord offense."
SC’S OFFENSE was a thor-,
ouhgly trained combination of in
dividual back field talent and team
organization. Nearly every play \
began with the quarterback,
either Pete Beathard or Bill Nel
sen, rolling out with excellent
protection: both the guards
would pull out from the line and
run interference along with the
fullback, while the center and
tackles would protect behind the
quarterback.
While the Stanford defensive
linemen were picking their way
through this maze of Trojan
blockers, the defensive backs
were bewildered by the quarter
backs pass-run option. If Bea
thard or Nelsen did not keep the
ball (which they did for a total
gain of 75 yards), they could
pass to their halfback, who had
gone in motion, for a consistent
gain of ten yards on a swing pass
pattern, or they could stop and
set themselves for a longer,
downfield pass.
Such long passes either set up
or accounted for four of SC’s
touchdowns. Beathard completed
passes of 2k and 38 yards to Bed
sole in the first and second scor
ing drives respectively. The third
touchdown scored on a 29-yarder
by Nelsen. Finally, in engineering
the fourth TD drive, Nelsen add
ed competions of 22 and 27 yards
to Troy’s list of aerial accom
plishments.
MEANWHILE, Stanford’s of
fense had its most productive
day; it nearly matched SC with
21 first downs while gaining 327
yards. Most impressive was the
Tribe’s passing, as quarterbacks
Clark Weaver and Steve Thur
low completed ten of 14 and ten
of 15 respectively. Weaver mixed
his throwing and his 4.7-yard
rushing average in directing
touchdown drives of 65 and 70
yards in the fourth quarter.
Frank Patitucci was the top re
ceiver with seven catches.
The USC Trojans waited till the
end of the first half Saturday to

reveal (he offensive artistry that
should earn them a first plaee
national ranking. Then they
molded five near flawless touch
down marches in burying Stan
ford 39-14.

For nearly the entire first half,
SC toyed with the Indians in a
virtual standoff. With four min
utes left before the intermission,
SC led by a skimpy 3-0 score, had
rolled up just 110 yards as com
pared to Stanford’s 97, and had
confined its offense to power runs
inside the tackles which were
eventually contained on every
series of downs. Thus, it had been
a pretty unimpressive exhibition
for a 14-point favorite and the
second ranked team in the coun
try.

But when SC got the ball at its
own 20 with 3:55 remaining, it
went to a new style of attack.
The Trojans had tried only two
passes previously, but now they
got rid of the pigskin as if their
quarterbacks were kosher; at one
point they passed on five consecu
tive plays. Using sideline patterns
so that the receivers could step
out of bounds to stop the clock,
SC clicked off 12 plays in two
minutes and 12 seconds, going 80
yards for a touchdown and a 10-0
lead at halftime.
EARLY IN the second half, the
Indians had a couple of discour
aging incidents before SC pro
ceeded to four more TD’s and a
