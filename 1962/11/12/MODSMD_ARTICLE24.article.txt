# Jack Curtice: 'SC Best in the Country,' But John Mackay Not Overconfident
## 
### GERRY FRY MARSHALL COOK 
Coach John McKay of the USC
Trojans was surprisingly modest
following his team’s 3914 trounc
ing of Stanford. He said that he
couldn't say if his team was the
best in the country, hut added
that he felt that his Trojans
could knock off a number of
teams in the country and that a
number of teams could beat his
squad.
LAST SEASON USC had all its
big horses, Pete Beathard, Hal
Kedsole, Willie Brown and Ben
Wilson, but they finished the sea
son with only a 4-5-1 record. Mc-
Kay said that if USC had had
seven points last year in the ap
propriate spots, they would have
harl an 8-2 record. He also pointed
out that so far this season USC
has not had an important injury.
At the beginning of the season,
coach McKay stated that USC
flidn’t have a good line, but Sat
urday he said that his forward
wall turned out much better than
expected, because of the tremen
dous play of the junior college
transfers and sophmores.
McKay felt that lowa was the
best team that USC had faced so
far and expects UCLA to provide
the biggest obstacle in its drive
for an undefeated season.

Although losing to the Trojans
by 25 points, many of Stanford’s
varsity players found the wide
gap hard to believe.
Starting guard Frank Dubof
sky summed up the general atti
tude. “It didn’t feel like we were
getting beaten that badly.
Against Oregon we felt like we
had been put through a grinder
after the game, but SC just didn't
hit that hard.”
TACKLE AL Hildebrand, who
turned in a fine performance in
the game, felt that SC’s success
came from the fact that they exe
cuted their plays perfectly. “They
are a well coached team,” he of
fered. “Every man carried out his
assignment.”
The man who enjoyed his finest
day as a varsity player, quarter
back Clark Weaver, praised the
Trojan’s excellent pasing attack.
When asked about his own suc
cess passing (he completed 10 of
14 for 112 yards), he replied, “It
doesn’t count unless you win.”
Coach Jack Curtice called the
Trojans “the best team I’ve seen
in my five years on the coast.”
He also said that he will vote for
them as (he top team in the coun
try.
CURTICE was impressed with
the variety displayed by SC’s of
fense. He felt that Stanford play
ed a good defensive game, partic
ularly in stopping Ben Wilson
and Willie Brown. “Our boys
were always right with the SC
receivers on defense, but they
(SC) managed to get the ball
anyway.”
The Stanford coach praised
Frank Patitucci, Weaver, Kent
Colberg, Steve Pursell, Hilde
brand and Dan Conaway.
Not all of the players agreed
with the general opinion of SC’s
ability. Defensive halfback Tim
Hansel didn’t, feel that SC’s All-
American candidate end, Hal Bed
sole, should even be chosen to an
All-Coast team. “He doesn’t have
exceptionally good moves or
speed.”

and Willie Brown. “Our boys
were always right with the SC
receivers on defense, but they
(SC) managed to get the ball
anyway.”
The Stanford coach praised
Frank Patitucci, Weaver, Kent
Colberg, Steve Pursell, Hilde
brand and Dan Conaway.
Not all of the players agreed
with the general opinion of SC’s
ability. Defensive halfback Tim
Hansel didn’t, feel that SC’s All-
American candidate end, Hal Bed
sole, should even be chosen to an
All-Coast team. “He doesn’t have
exceptionally good moves or
speed.”
Coach John McKay of the USC
Trojans was surprisingly modest
following his team’s 3914 trounc
ing of Stanford. He said that he
couldn't say if his team was the
best in the country, hut added
that he felt that his Trojans
could knock off a number of
teams in the country and that a
number of teams could beat his
squad.
LAST SEASON USC had all its
big horses, Pete Beathard, Hal
Kedsole, Willie Brown and Ben
Wilson, but they finished the sea
son with only a 4-5-1 record. Mc-
Kay said that if USC had had
seven points last year in the ap
propriate spots, they would have
harl an 8-2 record. He also pointed
out that so far this season USC
has not had an important injury.
At the beginning of the season,
coach McKay stated that USC
flidn’t have a good line, but Sat
urday he said that his forward
wall turned out much better than
expected, because of the tremen
dous play of the junior college
transfers and sophmores.
McKay felt that lowa was the
best team that USC had faced so
far and expects UCLA to provide
the biggest obstacle in its drive
for an undefeated season.

Although losing to the Trojans
by 25 points, many of Stanford’s
varsity players found the wide
gap hard to believe.
Starting guard Frank Dubof
sky summed up the general atti
tude. “It didn’t feel like we were
getting beaten that badly.
Against Oregon we felt like we
had been put through a grinder
after the game, but SC just didn't
hit that hard.”
TACKLE AL Hildebrand, who
turned in a fine performance in
the game, felt that SC’s success
came from the fact that they exe
cuted their plays perfectly. “They
are a well coached team,” he of
fered. “Every man carried out his
assignment.”
The man who enjoyed his finest
day as a varsity player, quarter
back Clark Weaver, praised the
Trojan’s excellent pasing attack.
When asked about his own suc
cess passing (he completed 10 of
14 for 112 yards), he replied, “It
doesn’t count unless you win.”
Coach Jack Curtice called the
Trojans “the best team I’ve seen
in my five years on the coast.”
He also said that he will vote for
them as (he top team in the coun
try.
CURTICE was impressed with
the variety displayed by SC’s of
fense. He felt that Stanford play
ed a good defensive game, partic
ularly in stopping Ben Wilson
and Willie Brown. “Our boys
