Rawlings’ four goals, Stanford ■
clinched an invitation to the
NCAA soccer playoffs with a
j well-played 6-4 victory over San
Jose State. The match was held
t Saturday on Stanford’s Harry
Maloney Field.
The Indians meet either Mich
igan State or St. Louis in their
first NCAA match. The Spartans
| and Billikens played Saturday for
the right to oppose Stanford as
the Mid-Western representative,
j The game probably will be played
a week from tomorrow on the
1 home field of the Mid-Western op
ponent. Semi-final and final
games will be played on Thanks

I thereafter on St. Louis’ field.'
i RAWLINGS scored the first
i four Stanford goals, as San Jose I
lived up to their rating as a good
! team that might reach the height
I of its potential against Stanford.
The Spartans played Stanford to
a stand-still in the first half, and
; in fact led the Far Western rep
resentatives for awhile at 1-2 in
the second quarter.
Stanford broke to a very quick
lead with only 1:47 gone in the
first quarter, as Rawlings headed
| Ed Clarke’s perfect pass into the
net.
Dave Kingsley evened the
score-sheet 12 minutes later,
striking after a series of cross
field passes left the ball in posi
tion for an open shot. Valdis
Svans put the Spartans ahead
briefly, with 2:20 gone in the sec
ond quarter, but Rawlings’ sec
ond goal knotted the score at 2-2
at the half. A1 Nnoli’s pass left
the lanky center-forward in a
good position to fake out SJS
goalie, Slobodan Galeb, and burn
the ball into the net.
A THREE-GOAL outburst with
in the middle nine minutes of the
third quarter salted away the
Stanford win. Rawlings got the
first two, once taking advantage
of the goalie’s mistake and scor
ing. His first goal was a rebound
of a shot that Galeb let bounce
off his chest. The second was set
up by passes from Klas Bergman
; and Don Griffith.

Griffith made the final goal of
the third period spurt. He got
good passes from Rawlings and
Bergman, and lobbed the ball
over Caleb’s head. Larry Chuk
wudebe tallied Stanford’s final

goal halfway through tho fourth
quarter.
Two final San Jose tallies by
Efiok Akpan were meaningless.
The outstanding play of the
game was turned in by Stanford
goalie Kent Mueller. One of the
SJS swifties in the front line,
Amagh Nuoka, maneuvered past
the fullbacks on a breakaway.
Mueller came out to meet him,
and deflected the hall, while be
ing bowled over by his own half
back, who had dropped back to
help. Mueller injured a kidney on
the play and had to be taken out
of the game. He’ll be ready for
the NCAA playoffs, however.
STANFORD Soccer Coach Fred
Priddle singled out Rawlings,
Nnoli and fullback Sandy Pofahl
as Stanford’s top players, though
the work of goalies Mueller and
!Tom Paulson, fullback Kent
| Smith, and forwards Bergman
land Grifith cannot be overlooked.

Stanford win. Rawlings got the
first two, once taking advantage
of the goalie’s mistake and scor
ing. His first goal was a rebound
of a shot that Galeb let bounce
off his chest. The second was set
up by passes from Klas Bergman
; and Don Griffith.

Griffith made the final goal of
the third period spurt. He got
good passes from Rawlings and
Bergman, and lobbed the ball
over Caleb’s head. Larry Chuk
wudebe tallied Stanford’s final

goal halfway through tho fourth
quarter.
Two final San Jose tallies by
Efiok Akpan were meaningless.
The outstanding play of the
game was turned in by Stanford
goalie Kent Mueller. One of the
SJS swifties in the front line,
Amagh Nuoka, maneuvered past
the fullbacks on a breakaway.
Mueller came out to meet him,
and deflected the hall, while be
ing bowled over by his own half
back, who had dropped back to
help. Mueller injured a kidney on
the play and had to be taken out
of the game. He’ll be ready for
the NCAA playoffs, however.
