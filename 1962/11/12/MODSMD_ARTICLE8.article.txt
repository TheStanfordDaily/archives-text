# NAACP Protests 'Ghetto' Housing
## 
### DEAN SAVAGE Contributing Editor 
Thc Palo Alto chapter of the
NAACP is continuing its stepped
up campaign to help members of
minority groups to find housing.
Persuasion, picketing and legal
action are three methods used by
members in their efforts to elim
inate discriminatory housing, ac
cording to Mrs. Doris Jones,
Committee chairman.
The case of Stanley Puryear, a
Negro mathematician employed
at Lockheed who had charged
that a Sunnyvale apartment
house owner had refused to rent
to him on racial grounds, was de
cided in Puryear’s favor on Oct.
30.
AN AEE-WHITE Jury awarded
Puryear $3OO damages after I!L>
hours deliberation in Sunnyvale
Municipal court. He did not, how
ever, get the apartment, which
had been lot in the interim de
spite a sustained picketing effort
by the NAACP.
Another suit filed by Henry
Organ against the Taylor Con
struction Co. of Oakland, owners
of the Towne House Apartments
at 183 Del Medio Avenue in
Mountain View, has not yet come

to trial. Twenty-five NAACP
members and sympathizers, in
cluding five Stanford students,
picketed the apartment house last
1 Sunday.
Organ, a Lockheed engineering
psychologist, has found another
apartment but will continue with
| his suit in the hope that the per
vasive discriminatory housing
I problem may be somewhat les
sened in the Palo Alto area. A
| number of other cases have re
cently been settled both in and
cut of court.
THE BASIC reasons for picket-
I ing are three, according to Mrs.
Jones: to publicize the problem,
i to let minorities know there is a
I group willing to help them, and
| to bring pressure to bear upon
landlords.
One of the greatest problems
we have, said Mrs. Jones, is that
most minority group members
just aren’t aware we exist. The
Palo Alto chapter has been work
ing for several years to find hous
! ing but only recently decided to
i step up their program. Part of
:lhe reason has been an outbreak
1 of new incidents, Mrs. Jones
| added.
I The increased activity has

aroused reaction on the pail of
some landlords.
LAST WEEK in Ihe Palo Alto
Times. Dr. Lloyd Wallers, vice
president of the Santa Clara
County Apartment House Own
ers Association, stated that the
group opposed discrimination but
also “feel it is our right to rent
to anyone of our choice.”
If an owner turns down a Cau
casian, there is no problem, but
if he turns down a Negro, he is
accused of discrimination. There
is a question of economics in
volved.
“There are plenty of places for
members of minority groups to
live but some want to go where
they are not acceptable,” Walters
I continued.
WALTERS, the owner of an
eight-unit apartment in San Jose,
said that if he allows a majority
; of units to bo rented to members
I of a minority “I’ll have a ghetto.”
j Walters was unavailable for fur
ther comment.
| No picketing is planned in the
immediate future, Mrs, Jones re
i ported. The action taken depends
I on the individual incident and no
| case demanding this type of pro-
I test is currently being handled.
