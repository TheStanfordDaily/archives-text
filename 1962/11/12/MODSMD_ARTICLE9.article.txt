# Kornberg Talk Explains DNA

“This is microscopic space” said
Dr. Arthur Kornberg, referring
to the world of the molecules that
make up the living cell. Dr. Korn
berg, speaking Sunday night in
the Rinconada lounge, explained
that these molecules combine to
form the language of heredity.

Deoxyribonucleic acid, com
monly called DNA, is the chemi
cal expression of the language.
“DNA is a long message spelled
in four letters” Kornbcrg said.
The DNA is composed of four
distinct molecules which form a
spiral chain: the order of the
molecules in the chain relates the
message, he said.

If a molecule is out of place a
mutation may result, Kornberg
said. The danger of a mutation is
increased by radiation because
radiation can displace a molecule
from its proper position, he add
ed.
Through a series of chemical
steps the DNA causes the produc
tion of proteins and enzymes, ba
sic constituents in living matter.
One of the enzymes, he said, also
aids in the reproduction of DNA.
Every cell In a man. ho said,
has the same DNA. It is the
uniqueness of one’s DNA which
gives him a personal heredity.
