In chain drag lost, truck raises
heavy dust clouds to check air filter efficiency.
Results: Up to 30,000 miles between filter changes in Ford-built cars for ’63!
The 1963 Ford-built cars you see on the road these days can
eat dust and keep coming back for more, thanks to improved
carburetor air filters.
In our continuing quest to build total quality and service
saving features into Ford-built cars, our engineering research
staff explored the entire field of physical chemistry for new
air-purifying properties in materials.
The result: a filtering material made of chemically treated
wood pulp and paper that permits Ford-built cars under
normal operation to go from 24,000 to 30,000 miles before
carburetor air filter replacement is required.
The new, tougher filter paper is accordion folded to increase
surface area four-fold, permitting higher filtration in a smaller
package. The more matter it accumulates, the better it filters
right up to its full rated service life. It saves owners time and
money. It keeps Ford-built engines livelier longer.
