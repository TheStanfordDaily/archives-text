# LASSU to Reconsider Overnight Amendment
## 
### MARGARET HARDING Associate Editor 
The proposed amendment to the ASSU hy-laws defining oxer
night policy, xxhich was defeated at last Thursdays LASSU
meeting, will be considered again at this weeks meeting.
The amendment, which contains the majority of the recom
mendations about overnight policy made by the Committee on
Student Affairs and Services, is*

being brought up again because,
according to ASSU Vice Presi- ]
dent Priscilla Ferguson, it con- j
tains provisions which are “de- j
sirable and might be passed if all j
LASSU members are present.” j
Many LASSU members wore ah- j
sent when the overnight policy!
was voted on last week.
DEAN OF STUDENTS H. Don
aid Winbigler, declining to make j
a definite statement until after j
the LASSU meeting Thursday, j
said that the provisions which j
LASSU had defeated were “do- |
sirable and would make it possi- 1
bio for overnight parties to con- <
tinue.”
It is general knowledge, he said, |
that the present overnight policy |
has been the subject of much j
criticism. It is, of course, he add- i
ed, conceivable that either the j
Administration or the Associated j
Students may take steps to abol
ish overnights if some revision j
of the present overnight policy is!
not made.
THE AMENDMENT, an adap
tation of the Student Affairs I
Committee recommendations, I
adds to the present by-l;»ws pro-:
visions for locked doors and win- j
dows at overnight locations, per-1
sonal responsibility for social |
chairmen and house presidents, |
and special arrangements for out- j
door and small group overnights. •
Parts of the original Student!
Affairs Committee recommenda- j
tions were passed by LASSU two
weeks ago. This amendment was!
then sent to the By-laws Commit
tee. This committee reinstated
some of the portions of the origi
nal recommendations which
LASSU had deleted when it pass
ed the amendment the week be
fore. This revised amendment is
the one which was defeated last
week and will be reconsidered
this week.
