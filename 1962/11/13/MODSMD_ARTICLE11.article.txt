# Tuition Raised Again; $l5O More Per Year
## 
### 
Undergraduate tuition at Stan
ford will increase from $1260 to
$l4lO per academic year, effec
tive next fall, President Sterling
announced yesterday.
The increase, Stanford's sev
enth since World War 11,
amounts to $5O each for autumn,
winter and spring quarters. Sum
mer tuition will be increased, but
will remain substantially below
the rest of the academic year.
President Sterling said the in
crease will permit the University
to continue to raise faculty and
staff salaries and to extend the
student financial aid program.
Every effort will be made to as
sure that no student is denied an
opportunity to attend Stanford
solely for lack of funds, ho added.
DURING THU past decade,
student scholarship assistance
has increased dramatically, rising
from $460,000 in 1952 to $5,177,000
I in 1962. Nearly half the freshman
I ( lass receives aid averaging more
[than $l,OOO per recipient, he said.
Even with the increase, Presi
| dent Sterling said, tuition will
]cover only about 46 per cent of
the University’s operating costs.
Of the remainder, 20 per cent
comes from endowment and the
balance from private gifts.
More than 50 other colleges and
universities already have estab
lished tuition and fee payments
higher than those at Stanford, ac
cording to 1962-63 data published

by the Life Insurance Agency
Management Association. All
eight Ivy League institutions, in
cluding Harvard, have higher
rates, ranging from $1520 to
$1775 annually.
BASIC COSTS for a year’s
study at Stanford now total ap
proximately $2860, excluding
transportation to and from the
campus. Besides tuition, this fig
ure includes room and board,
books and supplies, laundry and
cleaning, and recreational ex
penses, he said.
Historically, Stanford levied no
formal tuition until 1920, when
the trustees approved a $4O per
quarter fee.
