# ASSU SCHOLAR:
## 'Shirer's Resentful Arguments Based on Misleading Ideas' 
### KLAUS R. SCHERPE 
(Editor's note: Klaus Scherpe
from Berlin is an ASSU foreign
scholar. In HMD, for political rea
sons, his family moved from East
Berlin to West Berlin.)

I doubt it. I doubt it very much
that a journalist who has lived
through a period of history is at
least as qualified to write history
as a professor. At least Mr. Shir
er is not, though his rise as a
writer of history was made pos
sible by thousands of readers
who were at least strongly inter
ested in his pseudo version of
history.
Mr. Shirer is one of those peo
ple who carry a conviction
(around with them) which makes
them deaf to any other- logical
argument. He belongs to this
group of people whom he tried
to find in Germany, who cannot
realize that limes have changed,
who carry their out-of-date opin
ion into new situations and try
to infect people against their own
better-knowing.
WHAT DOES Mr-. Shirer fear?
Most people in this country fear
the communists with their ide
ology of expansion and world
leadership. Not so Mr, Shirer. He
fears German militarism and
welcomes the existence of a pow
erful Russian nation that can
hold the Germans at the Elbe.
Now he has learned by the “Der
Spiegel” affair that the German
army is not very strong at all,
which “makes him feel pretty
good.” Reading Mr. Shirer, one
gets the idea that the War is not
yet over; at least 15 years of
world-history have escaped his
mind.
Mr. Shirer finds himself with
strange bedfellows: the commu
nist agitators who want to make
us believe that the danger for the
world comes from the Germans
again, thus concealing their own
aggressive aims. Obviously Mr.
Shirer wants to see the US Army
as weak as possible, too, since he
rejoices at the German Army’s
being weak, although West Ger
many is one of the closest allies

of the United States, His point of
view is not wholly unfavourable
to communist aims. Mr. Shirer is
the best help for communist prop
aganda, which tries to sow mis
trust and hatred in the Western
Alliance. Mr. Shirer also fights
for the idea of two German states
to be established, a goal which
the communists have pursued for
the last ten years. He advocates
a drastic revision of Western poli
cy to achieve the legal division of
Germany for good.
At this point we have to ask
ourselves what is most dangerous
in Mr. Shirer’s mind: a mistaken
judgment of present-day Ger
many or a naive attitude toward
the communists.
THE EXISTENCE of the Com
mon Market is for Mr. Shirer a
good means to withhold Germany
from future greatness. Even Mr.
Shirer should realize that it
might be more than that, and per
haps one should remind him that,
Germany has shown more inter
est and activity in the trend to
ward European unity than any of
the countries concerned. But this
does not fit into Mr. Shirer’s pic
ture; neither does the rapproche
ment between France and Ger
many which, after all, he “can’t
help but welcome.”
For Mr. Shirer most of the evil
in our world is concentrated in
open or in secret development
somewhere in West Germany. He
should look across the Wall into
the East sometime on his search
for people who “do it again.” I
am sure he would find out that
the East German communists “do
it even better” than the Nazis
ever could.
The West Germans try to bear
the burden of their recent history.
They feel guilty for all Germans
and try to help those who have
suffered most from the Hitler re
gime. if material aid can be help
at all. In the Federal Republic of
Germany the Germans have tried
to build up a democracy on the
basis that what had happened
should never happen again. This
has been achieved by now,
though there still are defects (but

probably no more than in any
other country). What the Ger
mans need is support in their
struggle for a lasting form of de
mocracy and not suspicion to
ward everything they are doing.
If there are defects one should
try to help the Germans to over
come them and not push them
back into an historic position
from which they struggle to free
1 hemselves.
MR. SHIRER has promised us
another book about the collapse
of the Third Republic in France.
He will probably write some
more books during the next few
years, but I seriously doubt that
he will ever write a valuable
book on history at all. He ex
cludes himself from any consider
ations as a serious historian since
his arguments are full of resent
ment; and presume basic ideas
that are misleading. One should
continue to read Mr. Shirer since
his books can be very educating
in many respects.
However, to read nothing but
Shirer, as some people certainly
will, would mean to limit oneself
to Mr. Shirer’s narrowminded
ness, which in our present politi
cal situation would not only be ir
responsible but extremely dan
gerous.

who carry their out-of-date opin
ion into new situations and try
to infect people against their own
better-knowing.
WHAT DOES Mr-. Shirer fear?
Most people in this country fear
the communists with their ide
ology of expansion and world
leadership. Not so Mr, Shirer. He
fears German militarism and
welcomes the existence of a pow
erful Russian nation that can
hold the Germans at the Elbe.
Now he has learned by the “Der
Spiegel” affair that the German
army is not very strong at all,
which “makes him feel pretty
good.” Reading Mr. Shirer, one
gets the idea that the War is not
yet over; at least 15 years of
world-history have escaped his
mind.
Mr. Shirer finds himself with
strange bedfellows: the commu
nist agitators who want to make
us believe that the danger for the
world comes from the Germans
again, thus concealing their own
aggressive aims. Obviously Mr.
Shirer wants to see the US Army
as weak as possible, too, since he
rejoices at the German Army’s
being weak, although West Ger
many is one of the closest allies

of the United States, His point of
view is not wholly unfavourable
to communist aims. Mr. Shirer is
the best help for communist prop
aganda, which tries to sow mis
trust and hatred in the Western
Alliance. Mr. Shirer also fights
for the idea of two German states
to be established, a goal which
the communists have pursued for
the last ten years. He advocates
a drastic revision of Western poli
cy to achieve the legal division of
Germany for good.
At this point we have to ask
ourselves what is most dangerous
in Mr. Shirer’s mind: a mistaken
judgment of present-day Ger
many or a naive attitude toward
the communists.
THE EXISTENCE of the Com
mon Market is for Mr. Shirer a
good means to withhold Germany
from future greatness. Even Mr.
Shirer should realize that it
might be more than that, and per
haps one should remind him that,
Germany has shown more inter
est and activity in the trend to
ward European unity than any of
the countries concerned. But this
does not fit into Mr. Shirer’s pic
ture; neither does the rapproche
ment between France and Ger
many which, after all, he “can’t
help but welcome.”
For Mr. Shirer most of the evil
in our world is concentrated in
open or in secret development
somewhere in West Germany. He
should look across the Wall into
the East sometime on his search
for people who “do it again.” I
am sure he would find out that
the East German communists “do
it even better” than the Nazis
ever could.
The West Germans try to bear
the burden of their recent history.
They feel guilty for all Germans
and try to help those who have
suffered most from the Hitler re
gime. if material aid can be help
at all. In the Federal Republic of
Germany the Germans have tried
to build up a democracy on the
basis that what had happened
should never happen again. This
has been achieved by now,
though there still are defects (but

probably no more than in any
other country). What the Ger
mans need is support in their
struggle for a lasting form of de
mocracy and not suspicion to
ward everything they are doing.
If there are defects one should
try to help the Germans to over
come them and not push them
back into an historic position
from which they struggle to free
1 hemselves.
MR. SHIRER has promised us
another book about the collapse
of the Third Republic in France.
He will probably write some
more books during the next few
years, but I seriously doubt that
he will ever write a valuable
book on history at all. He ex
cludes himself from any consider
ations as a serious historian since
his arguments are full of resent
ment; and presume basic ideas
that are misleading. One should
continue to read Mr. Shirer since
his books can be very educating
in many respects.
However, to read nothing but
Shirer, as some people certainly
will, would mean to limit oneself
to Mr. Shirer’s narrowminded
ness, which in our present politi
cal situation would not only be ir
responsible but extremely dan
gerous.

I doubt it. I doubt it very much
that a journalist who has lived
through a period of history is at

Mr. Shirer is one of those peo

world comes from the Germans
again, thus concealing their own
aggressive aims. Obviously Mr.
Shirer wants to see the US Army
as weak as possible, too, since he
rejoices at the German Army’s
being weak, although West Ger
many is one of the closest allies

of the United States, His point of
view is not wholly unfavourable
to communist aims. Mr. Shirer is
the best help for communist prop
aganda, which tries to sow mis
trust and hatred in the Western
Alliance. Mr. Shirer also fights
for the idea of two German states
to be established, a goal which
the communists have pursued for
the last ten years. He advocates
a drastic revision of Western poli
cy to achieve the legal division of
Germany for good.
At this point we have to ask
ourselves what is most dangerous
in Mr. Shirer’s mind: a mistaken
judgment of present-day Ger
many or a naive attitude toward
the communists.
THE EXISTENCE of the Com
mon Market is for Mr. Shirer a
good means to withhold Germany
from future greatness. Even Mr.
Shirer should realize that it
might be more than that, and per
haps one should remind him that,
Germany has shown more inter
est and activity in the trend to
ward European unity than any of
the countries concerned. But this
does not fit into Mr. Shirer’s pic
ture; neither does the rapproche
ment between France and Ger
many which, after all, he “can’t
help but welcome.”
For Mr. Shirer most of the evil
in our world is concentrated in
open or in secret development
somewhere in West Germany. He
should look across the Wall into
the East sometime on his search
for people who “do it again.” I
am sure he would find out that
the East German communists “do
it even better” than the Nazis
ever could.
The West Germans try to bear
the burden of their recent history.
They feel guilty for all Germans
and try to help those who have
suffered most from the Hitler re
gime. if material aid can be help
at all. In the Federal Republic of
Germany the Germans have tried
to build up a democracy on the
basis that what had happened
should never happen again. This
has been achieved by now,
though there still are defects (but

probably no more than in any
other country). What the Ger
mans need is support in their
struggle for a lasting form of de
mocracy and not suspicion to
ward everything they are doing.
If there are defects one should
try to help the Germans to over
come them and not push them
back into an historic position
from which they struggle to free
1 hemselves.
MR. SHIRER has promised us
another book about the collapse
of the Third Republic in France.
He will probably write some
more books during the next few
years, but I seriously doubt that
he will ever write a valuable
book on history at all. He ex
cludes himself from any consider
ations as a serious historian since
his arguments are full of resent
ment; and presume basic ideas
that are misleading. One should
continue to read Mr. Shirer since
his books can be very educating
in many respects.
However, to read nothing but
Shirer, as some people certainly
will, would mean to limit oneself
to Mr. Shirer’s narrowminded
ness, which in our present politi
cal situation would not only be ir
responsible but extremely dan
gerous.

I doubt it. I doubt it very much
that a journalist who has lived
through a period of history is at
least as qualified to write history
as a professor. At least Mr. Shir
er is not, though his rise as a
writer of history was made pos
sible by thousands of readers
who were at least strongly inter
ested in his pseudo version of
history.
Mr. Shirer is one of those peo
ple who carry a conviction
(around with them) which makes
them deaf to any other- logical
argument. He belongs to this
group of people whom he tried
to find in Germany, who cannot
realize that limes have changed,
who carry their out-of-date opin
ion into new situations and try
to infect people against their own
better-knowing.
WHAT DOES Mr-. Shirer fear?
Most people in this country fear
the communists with their ide
ology of expansion and world
leadership. Not so Mr, Shirer. He
fears German militarism and
welcomes the existence of a pow
erful Russian nation that can
hold the Germans at the Elbe.
Now he has learned by the “Der
Spiegel” affair that the German
army is not very strong at all,
which “makes him feel pretty
good.” Reading Mr. Shirer, one
gets the idea that the War is not
yet over; at least 15 years of
world-history have escaped his
mind.
Mr. Shirer finds himself with
strange bedfellows: the commu
