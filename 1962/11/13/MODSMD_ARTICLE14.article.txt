## ASSU President to Have Veto, To Be Relieved of LASSU Duties 
### ROBERT SAYLER 
(Editor's note: The following is
an article written last spring; by
last year’s ASSU President, Rob
ert Sayler, now at Harvard Law
School. The changes in the execu
tive article of the Constitution
are essentially the same as those
proposed last spring.)

The shortcomings of the Exec
utive Article of the 1952 ASSU
Constitution consistently have
been a target for many sorts of
marksmen. So much so in fact,
that the executive section merited
the initial consideration of the
Committee on Student Goals.
During the past five months
the five changes discussed below,
among others, have received our
conscientious study.
THE PRESIDENT of the Asso
ciated Students will be relieved
of his duties as “President of the
Legislature.” As we have indi
cated, our profound hope is that
the students can begin to partici
pate actively in the University
community and the University
decision-making process. To ac
complish this, the Legislature
must effectively communicate
with the students and the execu
tive must communicate these
views to the administration and
faculty.
The executive cannot perform
his expanded function if he must
simultaneously shoulder the re
sponsibility of an expanded Legis
lature. The legislative duties of
the President currently occupy

well over one-third of his time;
chairing the proposed Legislature
with substantial increases in
numbers as well as issues, will
be, as we see it. a full-time task.

A Chairman elected by Legis
lature from their membership is
necessary if the President is to
be permitted to execute policy
and to guarantee the direction of
a student government which is
preparing abruptly to change its
course. In short, standing square
ly between the student body and
an adequate representation of
their views, is an executive with
too little time to act effectively.
THE ARGUMENTS supporting
an executive veto are cut from
the same bolt of cloth as those
which have called for executive
in separation from the Legisla
ture. The executive is the liaison
between the Legislature on the
one hand and the administration,
faculty, student judiciary, and all
other official agencies of the
ASSU on the other.

While it is likely that a presi
dential veto will be used sparing
ly, it is fair to assert that the in
dividual members of the Legisla
ture could not reasonably be ex
pected to have acquired the same
unbiased objectivity or thorough
knowledge that the President has
gained. It is our feeling that the
President should be empowered
with a veto on all non-budgetary
items unless two-thirds of the
Legislature elects to override the
presidential negative.
