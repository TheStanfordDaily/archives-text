# GRAND DESIGN
## Realism of Atlanticians' Supplants Idealism of Willkie's One World 
### TOM GREY IIR Political Analyst 
Registration is going on this
week for the HR’s main Fall
Quarter conference, “The Grand
Design: The United States and
the Atlantic Community.” Averell
Harriman will keynote the con
ference, Assistant Secretary of
Commerce Hickman Price will
speak, and there will be a faculty
panel and student seminars.
The conference should produce
wide interest on the campus and
beyond. The kind of excitement
that once was stirred up among
students by Wendell Willkie’s
One World, or by the World Fed
eralists, now is engendered by the
set of institutions, policies, ideas
and hopes which we group under
the rather vague concept of “The
Atlantic Community.”
THE STUDENTS who are to
day confirmed “Atlanticians”
pride themselves on being hard
headed and realistic, as contrast
ed with the naive one-worlders
of an earlier day. They are pur
suing strictly limited goals, they
say—the community of a restrict
ed group of nations, with a large
ly common heritage and culture,
and with relatively parallel na
tional interests.
And what is more, they have

an institutional framework to j
start with one which has shown |
that in certain areas it really |
works. The Coal and Steel Com- j
munity, the Common Market, |
Euratom, NATO, the Organiza
tion for Economic Cooperation
and Development: all these rep
resent steps already taken by the
sovereign states of Western Eu
rope and North America toward
cooperation and community.
From these beginnings, the j
faithful project a vision of the
future, one which has been wide
ly referred to by the New Fron
tier term of the Grand Design.
They see a Europe great, united, j
and growing, moving ahead on ]
the basis of her shiny new Indus-1
trial plant built from the ruins j
of the war by American aid and
investment. They see American, !
British, and Canadian industry,
no longer protected by tariffs, be
ing stimulated to a new era of
growth and productivity.
ON THE political scene, they
see a powerful and democratic
United Europe and an equally
mighty North America drawn in
creasingly closer together by
their economic ties, their common
opposition to Soviet imperialism,
and their common heritage of
liberal democracy. The new Eu
rope to them is simply a new and
strong partner in America’s mes
sianic goal of making the world
safe for democracy.
Culturally, the increased inter
change, both economic and politi
cal, within the Atlantic Commu
nity will mix all that is best in
the varied and rich cultures of
the old and new world, creating
new and vigorous strains. With
the breakdown of national boun
daries, with increased travel and
commerce between the nations,
and with the striving for common
goals, will come an end to the
fierce rivalries and unthinking
prejudices which have divided
the Western World in the past.
It is a lovely vision, and it ap
pears to be somewhat more solid
ly founded than similar such
visions of the past Dante’s vis
ion of “De Monarchia, Kant’s of
“On Perpetual Peace,” and many
others which live today only as
ideas.
BIT THERE are serious prob
lems which confront the immedi
ate development of the Atlantic
Community. It may be only luck
and historical accident that it has
gotten as far as it has since 1945.
More important, there may be in
ternal contradictions in the very
concept outlined above which
when clarified will show that peo
ple, when they refer to “the At
lantic Community” can have in
mind any of two or three very dif
ferent and even mutually exclu
sive things.

British, and Canadian industry,
no longer protected by tariffs, be
ing stimulated to a new era of
growth and productivity.
ON THE political scene, they
see a powerful and democratic
United Europe and an equally
mighty North America drawn in
creasingly closer together by
their economic ties, their common
opposition to Soviet imperialism,
and their common heritage of
liberal democracy. The new Eu
rope to them is simply a new and
strong partner in America’s mes
sianic goal of making the world
safe for democracy.
Culturally, the increased inter
change, both economic and politi
cal, within the Atlantic Commu
nity will mix all that is best in
the varied and rich cultures of
the old and new world, creating
new and vigorous strains. With
the breakdown of national boun
daries, with increased travel and
commerce between the nations,
and with the striving for common
goals, will come an end to the
fierce rivalries and unthinking
prejudices which have divided
the Western World in the past.
It is a lovely vision, and it ap
pears to be somewhat more solid
ly founded than similar such
visions of the past Dante’s vis
ion of “De Monarchia, Kant’s of
“On Perpetual Peace,” and many
others which live today only as
ideas.
BIT THERE are serious prob
lems which confront the immedi
ate development of the Atlantic
Community. It may be only luck
and historical accident that it has
gotten as far as it has since 1945.
More important, there may be in
ternal contradictions in the very
concept outlined above which
when clarified will show that peo
ple, when they refer to “the At
lantic Community” can have in
mind any of two or three very dif
ferent and even mutually exclu
sive things.

Registration is going on this
week for the HR’s main Fall
Quarter conference, “The Grand
Design: The United States and
the Atlantic Community.” Averell
Harriman will keynote the con
ference, Assistant Secretary of
Commerce Hickman Price will
speak, and there will be a faculty
panel and student seminars.
The conference should produce
wide interest on the campus and
beyond. The kind of excitement
that once was stirred up among
students by Wendell Willkie’s
One World, or by the World Fed
eralists, now is engendered by the
set of institutions, policies, ideas
and hopes which we group under
the rather vague concept of “The
Atlantic Community.”
THE STUDENTS who are to
day confirmed “Atlanticians”
pride themselves on being hard
headed and realistic, as contrast
ed with the naive one-worlders
of an earlier day. They are pur
suing strictly limited goals, they
say—the community of a restrict
ed group of nations, with a large
ly common heritage and culture,
and with relatively parallel na
tional interests.
And what is more, they have

an institutional framework to j
start with one which has shown |
that in certain areas it really |
works. The Coal and Steel Com- j
munity, the Common Market, |
Euratom, NATO, the Organiza
tion for Economic Cooperation
and Development: all these rep
resent steps already taken by the
sovereign states of Western Eu
rope and North America toward
cooperation and community.
From these beginnings, the j
faithful project a vision of the
future, one which has been wide
ly referred to by the New Fron
tier term of the Grand Design.
They see a Europe great, united, j
and growing, moving ahead on ]
the basis of her shiny new Indus-1
