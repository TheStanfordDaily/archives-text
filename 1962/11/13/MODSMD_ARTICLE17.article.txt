# SPAIN IN TURMOIL
## Spanish Democrats Losing Hope in U.S. Government

One does not have to wait to get into Spain itself to begin ob
serving its plight. On the train from Paris to Madrid, I shared a
compartment with six Spanish workers who were taking a two and
a half week vacation to see their families in Spain, Shortly they
would be on their way back to the factories in Germany which paid
them eight to ten times the*

wages they could earn in their
own country.
These men were representative
members of a workers’ movement
—400,000 strong—which has left,
Spain in search of higher paying
jobs and freer working condi
tions. Though Franco is broad
casting to the world that the
Spanish economy is now rising at
a rate of 3.7 per cent per year, he
fails to mention that the cost of
living is going up 7 1 -! per cent
per year and that the average
workers’ wages are increasing at
a rate of I*6-2 per cent per year.
He fails to point out that those
who benefit most from his im
provements are the haves rather
than the have-nots.
AS THE TRAIN neared Madrid
one of the workers called my at
tention to the large estates off in
the distance: “See. that is where
a capitalist lives, and there lives
another; the capitalists live well
but some day they will pay.”
These comments, ideas and vo
cabularies which I heard time
and again in Spain bore striking
resemblance to those blared daily
over Radio Espafta Independiente
from Prague it being the only
radio supporting the workers’
struggle for basic civil rights and
liberties and better wages. The
only message from The Voice of
America was one which could be
inferred from its silence.

papers carried photographs of
Stevenson smiling as he con
versed with Munoz Grandes, the
Foreign Minister, and other no
tables of the dictator’s govern
ment. An accompanying article
told how he discussed the bases
and other political matters of mu
tual interest. This rebuff by the
supposed figurehead of the liber
al democrats of the U.S. and his
country—ambassador to the U.N.
shattered the hopes of the oppo
sition which thought that it could
at least express its problems and
ideas to the representatives of the
American people.

What the Spanish people do
know about the United States is
that some of its leaders and rep
resentatives such as Stevenson,
Rusk and Ambassador Wood
ward, have been photographed
chatting amicably with Franco,
Munoz Grandes (Franco’s Vice
Premier and former commander
of the Blue Division) and other
eminent members of the Falange
who use U.S. arms to help keep
the Spaniards in line under the
dictatorial regime.
They see the 45,000 U.S. mili
tary personnel living on their lav
ish fenced-off bases (3 SAC. 1
naval air, 1 naval supply and a
few radar bases). They hear
about the $543 million in military
aid the American people have
given Franco since 1953 when the
U.S. government decided that its
need for bases justified a new
friendly policy towards Franco,
ONE OF THE leaders of the
Union of Democratic Forces (a
monarchist group) who at one
time looked to the U.S. as the
hope of the Spanish people, now
had this to say: “The U.S. likes
this government because you can
pay bribes in the right places and
can get what you want. If an
other government were in, you
would have to go to the people.
You want democracy only for
yourselves.” Others asked:
“Hasn’t your country learned its
lesson after Batista?”
The final blow against possible
contact between the Spanish op
position and the U.S. government
came when Stevenson, on his
summer trip through Spain, de
clared that he had to turn down
the opposition’s request for an
interview because he was not go

What the Spanish people do
know about the United States is
that some of its leaders and rep
resentatives such as Stevenson,
Rusk and Ambassador Wood
ward, have been photographed
chatting amicably with Franco,
Munoz Grandes (Franco’s Vice
Premier and former commander
of the Blue Division) and other
eminent members of the Falange
who use U.S. arms to help keep
the Spaniards in line under the
dictatorial regime.

can get what you want. If an
other government were in, you
would have to go to the people.
You want democracy only for
yourselves.” Others asked:
“Hasn’t your country learned its
lesson after Batista?”
The final blow against possible
contact between the Spanish op

One does not have to wait to get into Spain itself to begin ob
serving its plight. On the train from Paris to Madrid, I shared a
compartment with six Spanish workers who were taking a two and
a half week vacation to see their families in Spain, Shortly they
would be on their way back to the factories in Germany which paid
them eight to ten times the*

wages they could earn in their
own country.
These men were representative
members of a workers’ movement
—400,000 strong—which has left,
Spain in search of higher paying
jobs and freer working condi
tions. Though Franco is broad
casting to the world that the
Spanish economy is now rising at
a rate of 3.7 per cent per year, he
fails to mention that the cost of
living is going up 7 1 -! per cent
per year and that the average
workers’ wages are increasing at
a rate of I*6-2 per cent per year.
He fails to point out that those
who benefit most from his im
provements are the haves rather
than the have-nots.
AS THE TRAIN neared Madrid
one of the workers called my at
tention to the large estates off in
the distance: “See. that is where
a capitalist lives, and there lives
another; the capitalists live well
but some day they will pay.”
These comments, ideas and vo
cabularies which I heard time
and again in Spain bore striking
resemblance to those blared daily

from Prague it being the only
radio supporting the workers’
struggle for basic civil rights and
liberties and better wages. The

One does not have to wait to get into Spain itself to begin ob
serving its plight. On the train from Paris to Madrid, I shared a
compartment with six Spanish workers who were taking a two and
a half week vacation to see their families in Spain, Shortly they
would be on their way back to the factories in Germany which paid
them eight to ten times the*

wages they could earn in their
own country.
These men were representative
members of a workers’ movement
—400,000 strong—which has left,
Spain in search of higher paying
jobs and freer working condi
tions. Though Franco is broad
casting to the world that the
Spanish economy is now rising at
a rate of 3.7 per cent per year, he
fails to mention that the cost of
living is going up 7 1 -! per cent
per year and that the average
workers’ wages are increasing at
a rate of I*6-2 per cent per year.
He fails to point out that those
who benefit most from his im
provements are the haves rather
than the have-nots.
AS THE TRAIN neared Madrid
one of the workers called my at
tention to the large estates off in
the distance: “See. that is where
a capitalist lives, and there lives
another; the capitalists live well
but some day they will pay.”
These comments, ideas and vo
cabularies which I heard time
and again in Spain bore striking
resemblance to those blared daily
over Radio Espafta Independiente
from Prague it being the only
radio supporting the workers’
struggle for basic civil rights and
liberties and better wages. The
only message from The Voice of
America was one which could be
inferred from its silence.

Stevenson smiling as he con

Foreign Minister, and other no

told how he discussed the bases

supposed figurehead of the liber

What the Spanish people do
know about the United States is
that some of its leaders and rep
resentatives such as Stevenson,
Rusk and Ambassador Wood

chatting amicably with Franco,
Munoz Grandes (Franco’s Vice
Premier and former commander
of the Blue Division) and other
eminent members of the Falange
who use U.S. arms to help keep
the Spaniards in line under the
dictatorial regime.

given Franco since 1953 when the
U.S. government decided that its
need for bases justified a new
friendly policy towards Franco,

this government because you can
pay bribes in the right places and
can get what you want. If an
other government were in, you
would have to go to the people.
You want democracy only for
yourselves.” Others asked:
“Hasn’t your country learned its
lesson after Batista?”
The final blow against possible
contact between the Spanish op
position and the U.S. government
came when Stevenson, on his
summer trip through Spain, de
clared that he had to turn down
the opposition’s request for an
