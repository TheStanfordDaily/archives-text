# Lepper'-Parker Opposes Dave Moir In Hard-Fought Yell Leader Contest
## 
### 
DOUGLAS MOIR:
School spirit is perhaps the only
campus activity; except for book
stoi e - line - waiting, anxiety - over -
grade-experiencing, voting, and
(hopefully) graduating; in which
the great body of Stanford stu
dents participate both individual
ly and collectively and thus place
their efforts, or antics, directly in
the public eye and subject them
selves to public scrutiny. The task
of guiding, directing, and sum
moning forth the volatile Stan
ford spirit demands dedication,
sincerity, and creative humor
without offensiveness ... I have
it.

TOM ‘GARY LEPPER’ PARKER:
As head yell-leader candidates
(s) I propose the following:
a. To make the Stanford root
ing section a strong unit with its
primary purpose to support the

Stanford athletic teams. This can
be done in a number of ways.
When a crowd wants to cheer, I
will provide the correct cheer at
the correct time. When there is
ah indication that no cheer is
wanted, no cheer shall be given.
And when the crowd looses in
terest, there will always be some
sort of humor provided by (us).
b. To clean up and raise the
quality of cheers. It has often
been said that there are two kinds
of cheers; clean ones and funny
ones. I disagree. Wit and sax - -
casm are much more appealing to
the intelligent mind than “gross
ness.”

c. Not to detract, but to add to
athletic contests with clever en
trances and stunts that make peo
ple want to be part of an organ
ized rooting section (vending soap,
pushing our way through hot dog
and pepsi vendors).
