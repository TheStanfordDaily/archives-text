# Six Seek LASSU From Stern And Engineering
## 
### 
Stern

MAX GKUENBERG:
Stern has always had fine rep
resentation in the legislature. I
would like to continue this tradi
tion. Specifically I shall try to im
prove the poor menus, low grade
food substitute, and lack of seat
ing in the heads.
We must continue to encourage
fine people to live here; to attract
the best freshmen and transfer
students. If elected I shall work
with patience, prudence, and per
severence to give Stern a legisla
tive member truly representative
of a fine hall.

LEONARD SNAIDER:
I am a senior who has served
actively in house and all-Stern
policy making. Stern residents
arc being economically harmed by
certain university policies. If elect
ed I would ask why our dormitory
store charges in excess of retail,
why the Stern houses are denied
the receipts from their vending
iachinos, and why Stanford stu
dents pay more for the same in
surance policy than Cal students.
1 will not be a silent ‘yes man’.
BUD WEDIN:
The primary aim of the Stern
representative to LASSU is in
bringing the important legislative
issues to the attention of all Stern
residents so they may form opin
ions on these issues and, hence,
provide him with a true picture of
student opinion in Stern. I will
make every effort to close the gap
that now exists between the resi

dents of Stern and their represen
tation in LASSU by increasing
communication and contact from
LASSU to Stern and from Stern
to its LASSU representation.
KEITH KANAGA
Engineering
BARKY FEACHSBABT:
I am running for this office in
order to be able to represent my
constituents to the best of my
ability in all areas of cencern to
them.
In particular, I am strongly in
favor of reducting the “red tape”
associated with (he strict ASSU
control of finances of graduate
student and professional organ
izations. I feel that the treasurers
of these organizations are mature
and honest enough to be able to
manage a small petty cash fund
outside of the ASSU, if the organ
ization so desires.
THOMAS M. COVER:
In the past I have voted against
the following issues favored by
LASSU; right to recall Daily edi
tor, increasing red tape for over
nights, restriction of guests at
Sunday movies. I have opposed
LASSU directing the end of the
all men rooting section and the
disbanding of class governments
because I believed that those peo
ple most directly affected should
decide.
I favor quarter rather than year
long Crothers contracts, the Grad
uate Club, and a reasonable Leg
islature.

MAX GKUENBERG:
Stern has always had fine rep
resentation in the legislature. I
would like to continue this tradi
tion. Specifically I shall try to im
prove the poor menus, low grade
food substitute, and lack of seat
ing in the heads.
We must continue to encourage
fine people to live here; to attract
the best freshmen and transfer
students. If elected I shall work
with patience, prudence, and per
severence to give Stern a legisla
tive member truly representative
of a fine hall.

LEONARD SNAIDER:
I am a senior who has served
actively in house and all-Stern
policy making. Stern residents
arc being economically harmed by
certain university policies. If elect
ed I would ask why our dormitory
store charges in excess of retail,
why the Stern houses are denied
the receipts from their vending
iachinos, and why Stanford stu
dents pay more for the same in
surance policy than Cal students.
1 will not be a silent ‘yes man’.
BUD WEDIN:
The primary aim of the Stern
representative to LASSU is in
bringing the important legislative
issues to the attention of all Stern
residents so they may form opin
ions on these issues and, hence,
provide him with a true picture of
student opinion in Stern. I will
make every effort to close the gap
that now exists between the resi

dents of Stern and their represen
tation in LASSU by increasing
communication and contact from
LASSU to Stern and from Stern
to its LASSU representation.

BARKY FEACHSBABT:
I am running for this office in
order to be able to represent my
constituents to the best of my
ability in all areas of cencern to
them.
In particular, I am strongly in
favor of reducting the “red tape”
associated with (he strict ASSU
control of finances of graduate
student and professional organ
izations. I feel that the treasurers
of these organizations are mature
and honest enough to be able to
manage a small petty cash fund
outside of the ASSU, if the organ
ization so desires.
THOMAS M. COVER:
In the past I have voted against
the following issues favored by
LASSU; right to recall Daily edi
tor, increasing red tape for over
nights, restriction of guests at
Sunday movies. I have opposed
LASSU directing the end of the
all men rooting section and the
disbanding of class governments
because I believed that those peo
ple most directly affected should
decide.
I favor quarter rather than year
long Crothers contracts, the Grad
uate Club, and a reasonable Leg
islature.
