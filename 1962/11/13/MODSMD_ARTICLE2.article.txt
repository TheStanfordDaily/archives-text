Shoes are required at all times.
Quad clothes arc to be worn at
all times on the 2nd floor of Tres

may be worn in the downstairs
food service area and in the game
rooms and bowling alley.
THE ONLY EXCEPTION to
the above regulations is made for
the art students whose work

wear jeans or slacks to the art
classes while walking through the
Quad area, long coats must be
worn.
