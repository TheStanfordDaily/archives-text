## CANDIDATES PRESENT STATEMENTS LASSU Positions Attract Seventeen Candidates from Freshman Dorms 
### 
Wilbur
ROGER MERTZ:
Platform; My primary purpose
as a Wilbur representative to
LASSU will be to represent accu
rately and to the best of my abil
ity the views of those whom I
represent. I am strongly in favor
of the preservation and, if neces
sary, the expansion of academic
and personal freedoms on campus.
I am interested in Stanford stu
dents becoming leaders of stu
dents throughout t h e United
Stales. Any effective measures
aimed towards this end, I would
support. In addition I never have,
do not now, and never will favor
the Eighteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution.
JOHN DEBS:
Wilbur must be represented in
LASSU by two interested and able
individuals. Too often Freshman
class representatives do not have
the experience or the willingness
to make their constitutents’ voices
heard. I have already represented
Wilbur in LASSU as a substitute.
I am willing and able to forcefully
represent Wilbur. LASSU’s ac
tions affect us Freshman directly.
When' voting for this office, re
member the ni dividuals you
choose to represent you carry an
important responsibility. Vote
wisely.
BRAD DESSERY:
As Wilbur representative I
would ensure the following:
1. All issues brought before
LASSU of relevance to Freshmen
men would be presented to bach
Wilbur resident through the
houses or through open forum
meetings if necessary.
2. I would vote for the best in
terests of the Wilbur Houses at
all times.
3. I would carry to LASSU any
ideas or propositions offered by
Wilbur Hall residents.
I have experience in student
government,
THOMAS KNIGHT KERWIN:
I believe: (1) LASSU has ac
quired a habit of passing unrealis
tic and slipshod legislation (such
as the much criticized overnight
regulations) and should legislate
with more care and less dictating
of morals. (2) The new constitu
tion should be adopted. Remem
ber: More things are done by
Knight—Thomas Knight Kerwin.

STEVE EERICK:
It is very difficult for LASSU
to accurately represent the entire
student body with such a small
number of people. If I am elected
as the Wilbur representative, I
shall try to send opinion polls to
each of the houses on topics which
are likely to be discussed. I know
how easy it is for Legislature
meetings to degenerate into petty

quarrels, but 1 believe that my
experience in this field, as presi
dent pro tem of a large high
school legislature, will aid mo in
helping to eliminate much of this
useless quibbling.
DAVE GUGGENHIME:
I, Dave Guggenhime, am run
ning for Wilbur Rep to LASSU
for two main reasons. First, I
have a desire to become knows as
an integral part of the freshman
class. Secondly I have an even
stronger desire to serve you in
the student government here at
Stanford. Thank you for letting
me give you eye fatigue and re
member if you want determina
tion, not ability vote for Dave
Guggenhime.

Branner
MARCIA HILDEBRAND:
The role of a freshman in any
office, and particularly in LASSU,
is twofold: Since he has been here
less than a quarter, it is impossi
ble for him to know fully the inner
workings of the organization: it
is not for him to go gung-ho for
any radical reforms at the begin
ning. Instead, it is his responsi
bility to acquaint himself with
the purposes and procedures of
his organization, with the intent
to improve them later on. And
his obligation, furthermore, is to
make sure those freshmen he rep
resents know exactly what he is
doing and why.
SUZANNE STOPPLE:

First, I would like to express
my sincere thanks to the Stanford
CHAPARRAL, for its enlighten
ing remarks on the nature and
purpose of the LASSU ....
If elected, I shall assiduously up
hold the popular opinion of Bran
ner women on LASSU regulation.
I am a firm supported of the
Fundamental Standard and the
individual responsibility which it
places on each Stanford Student.
I see the Stanford woman as a
mature and thinking individual,
and therefore oppose an altera
tion of the current University pol
icy on “overnights”.

RUTH THOMPSON;
Because the freshman class
composes approximately one quar
ter of the undergraduate students
at Stanford, it is important that
they be adequately represented in
its student government. As Bran
ner Representative I would see
that my part of the class, the
Branner girls, are properly repre
sented by informing them of is
sues being discussed in legislature
and by getting their opinions on
such issues. In certain cases, such
as that of the new constitution, I
don’t feel that the girls have been
given enough background on the
situation to be able to vote with
conviction. I would hope to be
able to inform Branner girls more
completely on ponding issues as
representative to LASSU.
VALERIE JOHNSON
Roble

1)1 AN BICE:
Ruble's representative to LASSU
must be a competent person who ■
will act and vote according to the I
girls’ views and opinions. In re
turn for my promise to fulfill
these responsibilities, I ask your
support.
I have previously served on stu
dent legislatures and I feel that
the knowledge gained from these
experiences will enable me to rep
resent Roble more effectively and
make certain that our opinions
are known and heeded.
MARTY MASKALL:
Roble needs a vigorous contact
with LASSU. Such a representa
tive would effectively communi
cate the feelings of her electors to
the legislature and would also
acquaint them with the signifi
cance of each campus issue. The
new constitution would increase
Roble’s representation in LASSU,
thus providing a more accurate
picture of Roble opinion. Reflect
ing the feelings of each member
of Roble is almost an impossible
task for one person. However,!
Roble’s support would enable me
to work toward this ideal.
KAY MUELEEB:
I feel the LASSU Representa
tive from Roble must communi
cate the ideas of Roble to LASSU.
It is important that the legisla
ture knows the opinions of fresh
man women on proposed legisla
tion. It is no less important that
Roble knows the decisions of

I feel the LASSU Representa

Wilbur
ROGER MERTZ:
Platform; My primary purpose
as a Wilbur representative to
LASSU will be to represent accu
rately and to the best of my abil
ity the views of those whom I
represent. I am strongly in favor
of the preservation and, if neces
sary, the expansion of academic
and personal freedoms on campus.
I am interested in Stanford stu

Stales. Any effective measures
aimed towards this end, I would
support. In addition I never have,
do not now, and never will favor
the Eighteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution.
JOHN DEBS:
Wilbur must be represented in
LASSU by two interested and able
individuals. Too often Freshman
class representatives do not have
the experience or the willingness
to make their constitutents’ voices
heard. I have already represented
Wilbur in LASSU as a substitute.
I am willing and able to forcefully
represent Wilbur. LASSU’s ac
tions affect us Freshman directly.
When' voting for this office, re
member the ni dividuals you
choose to represent you carry an
important responsibility. Vote
wisely.
BRAD DESSERY:
As Wilbur representative I
would ensure the following:
1. All issues brought before
LASSU of relevance to Freshmen
men would be presented to bach
Wilbur resident through the
houses or through open forum
meetings if necessary.
2. I would vote for the best in
terests of the Wilbur Houses at
all times.
3. I would carry to LASSU any
ideas or propositions offered by
Wilbur Hall residents.
I have experience in student
government,
THOMAS KNIGHT KERWIN:
I believe: (1) LASSU has ac
quired a habit of passing unrealis
tic and slipshod legislation (such
as the much criticized overnight
regulations) and should legislate
with more care and less dictating
of morals. (2) The new constitu
tion should be adopted. Remem
ber: More things are done by
Knight—Thomas Knight Kerwin.

STEVE EERICK:
It is very difficult for LASSU
to accurately represent the entire
student body with such a small
number of people. If I am elected
as the Wilbur representative, I
shall try to send opinion polls to
each of the houses on topics which
are likely to be discussed. I know
how easy it is for Legislature
meetings to degenerate into petty

quarrels, but 1 believe that my
experience in this field, as presi
dent pro tem of a large high
school legislature, will aid mo in
helping to eliminate much of this
useless quibbling.
DAVE GUGGENHIME:
I, Dave Guggenhime, am run

for two main reasons. First, I
have a desire to become knows as
an integral part of the freshman

stronger desire to serve you in
the student government here at
Stanford. Thank you for letting
me give you eye fatigue and re

Branner
MARCIA HILDEBRAND:
The role of a freshman in any
office, and particularly in LASSU,
is twofold: Since he has been here
less than a quarter, it is impossi
ble for him to know fully the inner
workings of the organization: it
is not for him to go gung-ho for
any radical reforms at the begin
ning. Instead, it is his responsi
bility to acquaint himself with
the purposes and procedures of
his organization, with the intent
to improve them later on. And
his obligation, furthermore, is to
make sure those freshmen he rep
resents know exactly what he is
doing and why.
SUZANNE STOPPLE:

First, I would like to express
my sincere thanks to the Stanford
CHAPARRAL, for its enlighten
ing remarks on the nature and
purpose of the LASSU ....
If elected, I shall assiduously up
hold the popular opinion of Bran
ner women on LASSU regulation.
I am a firm supported of the
Fundamental Standard and the
individual responsibility which it
places on each Stanford Student.
I see the Stanford woman as a
mature and thinking individual,
and therefore oppose an altera
tion of the current University pol
icy on “overnights”.

RUTH THOMPSON;
Because the freshman class
composes approximately one quar
ter of the undergraduate students
at Stanford, it is important that
they be adequately represented in
its student government. As Bran
ner Representative I would see
that my part of the class, the
Branner girls, are properly repre
sented by informing them of is
sues being discussed in legislature
and by getting their opinions on
such issues. In certain cases, such
as that of the new constitution, I
don’t feel that the girls have been
given enough background on the
situation to be able to vote with
conviction. I would hope to be
able to inform Branner girls more
completely on ponding issues as
representative to LASSU.

of Roble is almost an impossible

Wilbur
ROGER MERTZ:
Platform; My primary purpose
as a Wilbur representative to
LASSU will be to represent accu
rately and to the best of my abil
ity the views of those whom I
represent. I am strongly in favor
of the preservation and, if neces
sary, the expansion of academic
and personal freedoms on campus.
I am interested in Stanford stu

Stales. Any effective measures
aimed towards this end, I would
support. In addition I never have,
do not now, and never will favor
the Eighteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution.
JOHN DEBS:
Wilbur must be represented in
LASSU by two interested and able
individuals. Too often Freshman
class representatives do not have
the experience or the willingness
to make their constitutents’ voices
heard. I have already represented
Wilbur in LASSU as a substitute.
I am willing and able to forcefully
represent Wilbur. LASSU’s ac
tions affect us Freshman directly.
When' voting for this office, re
member the ni dividuals you
choose to represent you carry an
important responsibility. Vote
wisely.
BRAD DESSERY:
As Wilbur representative I
would ensure the following:
1. All issues brought before
LASSU of relevance to Freshmen
men would be presented to bach
Wilbur resident through the
houses or through open forum
meetings if necessary.
2. I would vote for the best in
terests of the Wilbur Houses at
all times.
3. I would carry to LASSU any
ideas or propositions offered by
Wilbur Hall residents.
I have experience in student
government,
THOMAS KNIGHT KERWIN:
I believe: (1) LASSU has ac
quired a habit of passing unrealis
tic and slipshod legislation (such
as the much criticized overnight
regulations) and should legislate
with more care and less dictating
of morals. (2) The new constitu
tion should be adopted. Remem
ber: More things are done by
Knight—Thomas Knight Kerwin.

STEVE EERICK:
It is very difficult for LASSU
to accurately represent the entire
student body with such a small
number of people. If I am elected
as the Wilbur representative, I
shall try to send opinion polls to
each of the houses on topics which
are likely to be discussed. I know
how easy it is for Legislature
meetings to degenerate into petty

quarrels, but 1 believe that my
experience in this field, as presi
dent pro tem of a large high
school legislature, will aid mo in
helping to eliminate much of this
useless quibbling.
DAVE GUGGENHIME:
I, Dave Guggenhime, am run

for two main reasons. First, I
have a desire to become knows as
an integral part of the freshman

stronger desire to serve you in
the student government here at
Stanford. Thank you for letting
me give you eye fatigue and re

Branner
MARCIA HILDEBRAND:
The role of a freshman in any
office, and particularly in LASSU,
is twofold: Since he has been here
less than a quarter, it is impossi
ble for him to know fully the inner
workings of the organization: it
is not for him to go gung-ho for
any radical reforms at the begin
ning. Instead, it is his responsi
bility to acquaint himself with
the purposes and procedures of
his organization, with the intent
to improve them later on. And
his obligation, furthermore, is to
make sure those freshmen he rep
resents know exactly what he is
doing and why.
SUZANNE STOPPLE:

First, I would like to express
my sincere thanks to the Stanford
CHAPARRAL, for its enlighten
ing remarks on the nature and
purpose of the LASSU ....
If elected, I shall assiduously up
hold the popular opinion of Bran
ner women on LASSU regulation.
I am a firm supported of the
Fundamental Standard and the
individual responsibility which it
places on each Stanford Student.
I see the Stanford woman as a
mature and thinking individual,
and therefore oppose an altera
tion of the current University pol
icy on “overnights”.

RUTH THOMPSON;
Because the freshman class
composes approximately one quar
ter of the undergraduate students
at Stanford, it is important that
they be adequately represented in
its student government. As Bran
ner Representative I would see
that my part of the class, the
Branner girls, are properly repre
sented by informing them of is
sues being discussed in legislature
and by getting their opinions on
such issues. In certain cases, such
as that of the new constitution, I
don’t feel that the girls have been
given enough background on the
situation to be able to vote with
conviction. I would hope to be
able to inform Branner girls more
completely on ponding issues as
representative to LASSU.

support.
I have previously served on stu
dent legislatures and I feel that
the knowledge gained from these
experiences will enable me to rep
resent Roble more effectively and
make certain that our opinions
are known and heeded.
MARTY MASKALL:
Roble needs a vigorous contact
with LASSU. Such a representa
tive would effectively communi
cate the feelings of her electors to
the legislature and would also
acquaint them with the signifi
cance of each campus issue. The
new constitution would increase
Roble’s representation in LASSU,
thus providing a more accurate
picture of Roble opinion. Reflect
ing the feelings of each member
of Roble is almost an impossible
task for one person. However,!
Roble’s support would enable me
to work toward this ideal.
KAY MUELEEB:
I feel the LASSU Representa
tive from Roble must communi
cate the ideas of Roble to LASSU.
It is important that the legisla
ture knows the opinions of fresh
man women on proposed legisla
tion. It is no less important that
Roble knows the decisions of
Wilbur
ROGER MERTZ:
Platform; My primary purpose
as a Wilbur representative to
LASSU will be to represent accu
rately and to the best of my abil
ity the views of those whom I
represent. I am strongly in favor
of the preservation and, if neces
sary, the expansion of academic
and personal freedoms on campus.
I am interested in Stanford stu
dents becoming leaders of stu
dents throughout t h e United
Stales. Any effective measures
aimed towards this end, I would
support. In addition I never have,
do not now, and never will favor
the Eighteenth Amendment to
the United States Constitution.
JOHN DEBS:
Wilbur must be represented in
LASSU by two interested and able
individuals. Too often Freshman
class representatives do not have
the experience or the willingness
to make their constitutents’ voices
heard. I have already represented
Wilbur in LASSU as a substitute.
I am willing and able to forcefully
represent Wilbur. LASSU’s ac
tions affect us Freshman directly.
When' voting for this office, re
member the ni dividuals you
choose to represent you carry an
important responsibility. Vote
wisely.
BRAD DESSERY:
As Wilbur representative I
would ensure the following:
1. All issues brought before
LASSU of relevance to Freshmen
men would be presented to bach
Wilbur resident through the
houses or through open forum
meetings if necessary.
2. I would vote for the best in
terests of the Wilbur Houses at
all times.
3. I would carry to LASSU any
ideas or propositions offered by
Wilbur Hall residents.
I have experience in student
government,
THOMAS KNIGHT KERWIN:
I believe: (1) LASSU has ac
quired a habit of passing unrealis
tic and slipshod legislation (such
as the much criticized overnight
regulations) and should legislate
with more care and less dictating
of morals. (2) The new constitu
tion should be adopted. Remem
ber: More things are done by
Knight—Thomas Knight Kerwin.

STEVE EERICK:
It is very difficult for LASSU
to accurately represent the entire
student body with such a small
number of people. If I am elected
as the Wilbur representative, I
shall try to send opinion polls to
each of the houses on topics which
are likely to be discussed. I know
how easy it is for Legislature
meetings to degenerate into petty

quarrels, but 1 believe that my
experience in this field, as presi
dent pro tem of a large high
school legislature, will aid mo in
helping to eliminate much of this
useless quibbling.
DAVE GUGGENHIME:
I, Dave Guggenhime, am run
ning for Wilbur Rep to LASSU
for two main reasons. First, I
have a desire to become knows as
an integral part of the freshman
class. Secondly I have an even
stronger desire to serve you in
the student government here at
Stanford. Thank you for letting
me give you eye fatigue and re
member if you want determina
tion, not ability vote for Dave
Guggenhime.

Branner
MARCIA HILDEBRAND:
The role of a freshman in any
office, and particularly in LASSU,
is twofold: Since he has been here
less than a quarter, it is impossi
ble for him to know fully the inner
workings of the organization: it
is not for him to go gung-ho for
any radical reforms at the begin
ning. Instead, it is his responsi
bility to acquaint himself with
the purposes and procedures of
his organization, with the intent
to improve them later on. And
his obligation, furthermore, is to
make sure those freshmen he rep
resents know exactly what he is
doing and why.
SUZANNE STOPPLE:

First, I would like to express
my sincere thanks to the Stanford
CHAPARRAL, for its enlighten
ing remarks on the nature and
purpose of the LASSU ....
If elected, I shall assiduously up
hold the popular opinion of Bran
ner women on LASSU regulation.
I am a firm supported of the
Fundamental Standard and the
individual responsibility which it
places on each Stanford Student.
I see the Stanford woman as a
mature and thinking individual,
and therefore oppose an altera
tion of the current University pol
icy on “overnights”.

RUTH THOMPSON;
Because the freshman class
composes approximately one quar
ter of the undergraduate students
at Stanford, it is important that
they be adequately represented in
its student government. As Bran
ner Representative I would see
that my part of the class, the
Branner girls, are properly repre
sented by informing them of is
sues being discussed in legislature
and by getting their opinions on
such issues. In certain cases, such
as that of the new constitution, I
don’t feel that the girls have been
given enough background on the
situation to be able to vote with
conviction. I would hope to be
able to inform Branner girls more
completely on ponding issues as
representative to LASSU.
