# Efron Runs Unopposed
## 
### 
BRAD EFRON:
There are those who would
welcome the opportunity to
run unopposed in this elec
tion, therby foregoing a gold
en opportunity to present
one’s philosophy of student
government to one’s constit
uents. I am one of those. It
means I’ll probably win. My
philosophy is actually quite
simple: I am against any ex
tension of the red tape and
petty rules which currently
beset the Stanford student
body.
