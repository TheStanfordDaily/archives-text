# Frosh President Post Draws Crowd
## 
### 
TERRY TAKETA:
A President should provide the
class with vigorous, active leader
ship. He must not be a mere fig
urehead. I would like the oppor
tunity to prove that I can be an
active loader. My program will
include; (1) agitating to increase
the importance of our class on
campus, (2) forming an advisory
council drawn from each of the
Frosh living groups, (3) with the
aid of this council, coordinating
Freshmen activities and ideas.
CHRIS KIRBY:
Last year the student body
thought Armin Rosencranz was
joking when he advocated the abo
lition of class government. Ho
wasn’t.
The problem this year is to
have class government. It is the
only effective method of organiza
tion for a large university.
Class government belongs.
Rather than curtainling class ac
tivities, we must expand and en
rich their scope, both socially and
intellectually- I» class sponsored
lectures and seminars, 2) inter
class competition, 3) volunteer
service projects, 41 street dances.
No annihilation without repre
sentation.
DAN JAN/EN:
In government on campus, the
freshmen class has a total repre-"
sentatlon of six. Two of these
representatives are the Freshman
President and Vice President.
There is now an attempt being
made In abolish class government

j entirely and further reduce our I
number of representatives. If [
elected president I will work to j
attain more representation for the j
Freshmen class. Finally, I will ,
work to assure the permanence of
the class officer system at Stan-1
ford. The spearhead of my cam- j
paign is representation,
RICHARD VVKISS:
I pledge myself to a program of
■ increased communication between
the students and the student gov
ernment. For it is my belief that
good student government requires
participation by all the students,
and that the class of 1966 can be

most successful if its leaders are
fully aware of the thoughts of its
individual members. In addition,
I pledge to act according to the
dictates of my conscience and the
desires of my fellow students.
GREGG ROCKWELL:
During high school he served as
a member of the Student Council
for three years and was Student
Body President. If elected he will
gain for the Freshman Class a
stronger voice in student govern
ment. He will form his class into
a unified body, representing them
and their ideas to the University
and the public. Greg Rockwell

will wisely and successfully lead
the Class of '66 through its first
adventure s of life at Stanford.
MICHAEL MOORE:
The actual power of the Fresh
man Class President is quite lim
ited. The president’s tangible func
tions are basically the organiza
tion of a very few social functions.
However, I feel the president may
assume a more significant role.
This would consist of such intan
gible activities as class unification
and purpose. If the president com
pletes the above tasks, then lie
will have fulfilled his obligations.
In the process he will have given

true meaning to class government.
JOHN TATUM:
As freshman class president mv
goals in office will be: to ensure
the freshmen of a greater voice
in student affairs, since such an
important part of the student
body should have its say in what
goes on; to coordinate the activi
ties of all the freshmen living
groups, so as to decrease the
amount of time and money wast
ed in duplication of activities; and
to provide an efficient organiza
tion tor the planning of some
really tremendous parties.
