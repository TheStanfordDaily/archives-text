RRAI) FREEMAN:
Men’s Council is a judiciary
body which is guided to an extent
by established precedents. How
ever, it is equally important that
a member of Men’s Council care
fully consider the individual cir
cumstances of each case. I also
feel that the purpose of a decision
reached by the Council should be
corrective rather than punitive.

In recent practice in a few liv
ing groups, minor matters which
might have been taken to Men’s
Council have been handled by
councils within the group. This
seems to me a progressive innova
tion which should be further in
troduced and strengthened.

MARTIN GERRY:
The main function of Men’s
Council at Stanford is to hear “all
cases involving violation of the

disciplinary regulations.” There
are many types of violations, and
I feel that punishment should
vary accordingly. The most im
portant qualification for Men’s
Council is the ability to put viola
tions in their proper perspective.
This allows the council to treat
fairly the matter brought before
it. I have this qualification, and
I ask you for vour vot<\

CHUUK PATTEN:
I strongly believe that the pur
pose of a student judiciary group
is to allow the defendent the op
portunity of being judged by his
own peer group. The point here
that needs greater emphasizing is
that it is a student council and
not the dean’s council. The deci
sions of the council should be
made independently of the dean’s
office: if this is not done than

there is no actual need for the
council.
BILL SMILAND:
(11 Men’s Council’s emphasis
should not he primarily punitive,
but rather educative, and, when
ever possible, preventive.
<2) Each case should be treated
as an individual one, with all its
peculiar and special aspects being
considered. Leniency is in order
for first offenders and victims of
circumstance.

(3) 1 believe in student-admin
istered justice, limited by th c
check of the Dean’s Office.
(41 I believe in the worth and
j value of the Fundamental Stand
i ard and the Honor Code in devel
j oping individual responsibility in
our students.

reached by the Council should be
corrective rather than punitive.

In recent practice in a few liv
ing groups, minor matters which
might have been taken to Men’s
Council have been handled by
councils within the group. This
seems to me a progressive innova
tion which should be further in
troduced and strengthened.

MARTIN GERRY:
The main function of Men’s
Council at Stanford is to hear “all
cases involving violation of the

disciplinary regulations.” There
are many types of violations, and
I feel that punishment should
vary accordingly. The most im
portant qualification for Men’s
Council is the ability to put viola
tions in their proper perspective.
This allows the council to treat
fairly the matter brought before
it. I have this qualification, and
I ask you for vour vot<\

CHUUK PATTEN:
I strongly believe that the pur
pose of a student judiciary group
is to allow the defendent the op
portunity of being judged by his
own peer group. The point here
that needs greater emphasizing is
that it is a student council and
not the dean’s council. The deci
sions of the council should be
made independently of the dean’s
office: if this is not done than

there is no actual need for the
council.
BILL SMILAND:
(11 Men’s Council’s emphasis
should not he primarily punitive,
but rather educative, and, when
ever possible, preventive.
<2) Each case should be treated
as an individual one, with all its
peculiar and special aspects being
considered. Leniency is in order
for first offenders and victims of
circumstance.

(3) 1 believe in student-admin
istered justice, limited by th c
check of the Dean’s Office.
(41 I believe in the worth and
j value of the Fundamental Stand
i ard and the Honor Code in devel
j oping individual responsibility in
our students.

RRAI) FREEMAN:
Men’s Council is a judiciary
body which is guided to an extent
by established precedents. How
ever, it is equally important that
a member of Men’s Council care
fully consider the individual cir
cumstances of each case. I also
feel that the purpose of a decision
reached by the Council should be
corrective rather than punitive.
