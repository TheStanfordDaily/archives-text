# Two Seek Posts on Women's Council
## 
### 
SALLY PAYTON:
The enforcement of social reg
ulations by Women’s Council
should not have the punitive over
tones of law enforcement in the
greater community. Every wom
an coming before the Council
should be presumed innocent, as-

LASSU, many of which, such as
the overnight policy, directly af
fect Roble girls. I feel the new
constitution, which will increase
Roble representation from one
girl to three, will improve com
munication between Roble and
LASSU.
JAN ORKNEY:
Will the Roble LASSU Repre
sentative you elect truly represent
you? Or will she represent only
the feelings and beliefs of herself
and her close friends? If elected,
I pledge to discover your views
through discussions and question
aires, and then to present them to
LASSU. By electing a representa
tive that will make Roble’s views
knowm, we can demonstrate that
the Stanford women are not apa
thetic, but have a sincere interest
in their University.
BECKY lIOEFER:
As a freshman LASSU repre |
sentative, I would be the direct j
link between the girls of Roble j
and all-campus government. I
would fulfill this responsibility by
conducting polls and being avail
able to discuss issues so that I
could accurately represent Roble’s
views. I would inform Roble girls
of the legislature’s actions.
Most important, I would con
sider the long-range effects of leg
islation on the entire student body
as well as the immediate effects
on the entire student body as well
as the immediate effects on us as
freshmen.
JUDI CARPENTER:
The Stanford Legislature is not
presently a true representative
j body. Instead, it reflects only the
! personal opinion of 40 people. If
elected, I would institute a weekly
poll in Ruble on matters presently
before the legislature. The basis
of my actions in LASSU would be
j a reflection of that poll. YOU
| would he represented. In this way,
| Roble girls, each of you would
have a voice in OUR student gov
ernment.
SARA HITCHENS

sumed to be intelligent, mature,
and responsible. I would uphold
also a policy of constitency and
examination of precedent in con
sidering cases to ensure that per

sonal vindictiveness and vitupera
tion does not enter into any deci
sion.
