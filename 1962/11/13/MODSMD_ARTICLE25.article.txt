# Four Girls And Two Boys Compete for '66 V.P. Post
## 
### 
DAFRI MORGAN:
Our class needs unity. To I
achieve this, we must get to know
each other. The only all-frosh j
j place on campus is the Civ Libe, I
| and we can’t talk there. We need
I a Union-type Frosh center where
| wo can all get together and relax,
i Pre-Reg week was great for meet
ing people, but since then, we’ve
! gotten into a rut where we see
; the same people. We need to meet
! more people and get more united.
STAN COCKS:
The ASSU Constitution states
| (hat the Vice-President, besides
being assistant to the President,
shall “serve as general chairman
over all standing and non-standing
committees” of his class. To co
ordinate the many committees
which will crop up in the Fresh
man class, the Vice-President will
have to roly on careful planning
and organization to help the class
government run efficiently and i
smoothly. Because I know I can
do this job effectively, I strongly
hope for your vote.
PEGGY MeFADDEN:
Class officers can be important
and can usefully serve to unite a
class, if they have the full support
of their class. As freshman vice
president I would add enthusiasm,
imagination, and hard work to the
planning of all class functions.
Our class needs good leadership
to bring out its greatness. So for
“Togetherness for ’66,” for imagi
native leadership, for great class
functions, get out to vote for
; unity for the frosh for Peggy
i McFadden.

DON GRAY:
Render to Sterling what is Sterl
j ing’s and to ourselves what is fun.
j When we have a little spare time
j on week-ends, we should be able
to enjoy it. The Vice-Presidency,
in my hands, would be expanded
as far as possible into social activi
ties. As general chairman of last
week’s Wilbur Homecoming
Dance, I’ve demonstrated my abil
ity in this field. Just for fun, vote
Gray for Vice. Thank you.

EDVIGE RUDDOCK:
I am dissatisfied with the pres
! ont feeling that the social inter
i ests of the frosh men and women
i are irreconcilable. Although the
i ratio is a problem it is greatly
j exaggerated. Dean Allen and oth
| ers have led frosh men to believe
■ | that it is extremely difficult for
, j them to date freshmen women be
i : cause of the upper-class rush. The
■ dorms and libes are full, however,
I of attractive, but dateless girls.
1 1 Although exchanges and open
j houses help this situation. I would
like to promote more interclass
I social functions.

Class officers can be important
and can usefully serve to unite a

imagination, and hard work to the
