# DeLeilis May Be Out; Cummings OK
## 
### 
Stanford’s football team came
out of Saturday's 39-14 drubbing
by USC with one major injury
and a few minor ones. Fullback
Tony DeLeilis suffered a left
shoulder separation, and it is

doubtful that he will play against
San Jose State this Saturday.
Fullback and linebacker Ed
Cummings did not play in the
second half against USC because
of a mild concussion, but will play
this week. Tackle A1 Hildebrand
twisted his left knee in the game.
However, Hildebrand should be
healthy for the contest this week.
Otherwise, only normal aches
and pains are bothering the In
dians. Jim Schroyer was shaken
up a bit in the game, but is all
right.
