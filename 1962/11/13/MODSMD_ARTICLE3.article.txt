### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
“Nature is flat on her back ,
with our teeth in her throat, say- '
ing ‘Uncle’!” Professor Wallace '
Stegner. Director of Stanford’s i
Creative Writing Department and i
former assistant to the Secretary 1
of the Interior, told his audience
in Tresidder's Upper Lounge yes
terday afternoon.
Man’s tinkering with his en- \
vironment is a sort of “Faustion j
original sin,” he continued; it is i
also irreversible, for “like a ■
water skier, once he gets up he
has to keep going.” But man’s i
unusual insensitive quantitative j
approach to natural resources de- i
files Nature. We have manufac- !
lured never-bef ore-seen lethal
products, like certain insect sprays !
and Strontium 90, which never
disappear, only accumulate. We
are losing our reverance for life,
our contact with the biological
community to which we belong,
he continued.
STEGNER TRACED the record
of American conservation, from
the early spoilers through the
first scientific ecologists to the
“wilderness philosophers” like
Thoreau and the contemporary
Aldo Leopold, whose “Sand Coun
ty Almanac” Stegner compared
to Walden for the sense of wilder-
I ness as a symbol of rebaptism
land rejuvenation. This respect
1 for the life of the land is grow
ling in America; but with its com
bing must go the traditional no
li ion of Progress.
| Stegner considered inadequate
jthe three main literary solutions
I to this problem; Cursing the au-
Itomotive civilization; celebrating
the life close fo the earth tas does
j Robert Frost 1; and giving up
j civilization for mere animal life
| (as do Steinbeck and Kcrouac).
“Like the Japanese, wo should
i not touch the land unless we are
I sure we are improving it,” Slog
nor concluded.
