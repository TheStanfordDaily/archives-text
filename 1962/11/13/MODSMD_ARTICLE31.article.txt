## Naranja Women Win 2nd Title With 19-6 Win Over Cardenal 
### ROCKY HIGGINS 
Naranja wrapped up its second
consecutive Women’s Touch Foot
ball Championship Sunday, de
feating Cardenal 19 6 before an
estimated crowd of 50 on the
men’s intramural field, deeming
with pride, winning coach Rocky
Riggings drawled after the game,
"I’m proud as peaches of my
girls, today.”
Cardenal was in trouble from
the opening play. Naranja defen
sive halfback Jean Doble picked
off her first of two Cardenal pas
ses and returned it to the oppo
nent’s five yard line. On Naranja’s
first play from scrimmage, scat
back Aimee Dorr raced the final
five yards making it 6-0 Naranja
with two minutes gone.
CARDENAL came back strong,
driving well into Naranja terri
tory before being forced to relin
quish the ball on downs. But Car
denal was not to be denied; half
back Margie Merris intercepted a
Naranja pass and raced all alone
into the end zone knotting the
score at 6-all.
Within seconds Naranja’s
Aimee Dorr took a handoff from
tailback Ruth Rouse, turned left
end, and scampered 50 yards be
hind effective blocking; the point
was good and Naranja led 13-6.
In the second half nefther team
was able to mount a consistent
attack, due largely to the im
proved defensive effort of both
teams.
A TRIBUTE to the effort ex
pended by both clubs and their
coaches, Higgins and Doug
Brooks, in preparation for the
game was the fact not a single
penalty was called throughout the
length of this hard-fought contest

—or should this be a tribute to
the referees, Jack Thomas and
Ron Fisher?
