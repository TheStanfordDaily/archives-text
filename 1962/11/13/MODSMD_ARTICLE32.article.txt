### JIM DONOVAN 
The .Stanford water polo team
on Saturday lost to USC and with
defeat went all hope of the AAVVU
championship. The game was a
wild, free-scoring, poorly offici
ated affair, in which Southern Cal
prevailed, after a double overtime,
9-8. With this frustrating loss
chaffing (hem, the Indians will
definitely be "up” for the Football
College game on Wednesday at

3:30.
The Indians fell behind 2-3 at
halftime and were still one goal
hack, 3-4, by the end of the third
period. A fourth quarter spurt,
in other words, three goals by
Marty Hull, put Stanford ahead
6-5. However, USC tied the game
on a much disputed penally shot
with 25 seconds to go.
The Trojans scored on the first
play of the initial overtime period,
but Stanford grabbed the lead
again. Hull set up Pettigrew in
front and it was seven all. Then
with a minute remaining in the
five minute period, Pettigrew
passed to Ron Kovas who blasted
in a shot from the extreme right
corner of the pool. The second
overtime period was a different
story. A weakened Stanford team,
with both Pettigrew and defensive
act Don Buehler out of the game
on fouls, could not contain the
be 11 e r balanced Trojans, who
scored twice to make (he final
score 9-8.
Pettigrew played his finest
game of the year, scoring four
goals and setting up three others
with perfect passes. Hull turned
in his usual superlative perform
ance. He had four goals and near
ly won the game for Stanford,
when he put in three during the

final period.
Goalie George Stransky was
amazing. Time and again he foiled
what seemed to be sure goals.
Stransky stopped at least five
which were shot from but three
feet away.
Stanford played a very shoddy
first half against Fullerton Junior
College on Friday. By intermis
sion the score was tied 1-1 and
(here seemed little to choose be
tween the two teams.
The second half saw a disgusted

Stanford team swamp bewildered
Fullerton, scoring nine goals to
its one.

The Trojans scored on the first
play of the initial overtime period,
but Stanford grabbed the lead
again. Hull set up Pettigrew in
front and it was seven all. Then
with a minute remaining in the
five minute period, Pettigrew
passed to Ron Kovas who blasted
in a shot from the extreme right
corner of the pool. The second
overtime period was a different
story. A weakened Stanford team,
with both Pettigrew and defensive
act Don Buehler out of the game
on fouls, could not contain the
be 11 e r balanced Trojans, who
scored twice to make (he final
score 9-8.
Pettigrew played his finest
game of the year, scoring four
goals and setting up three others
with perfect passes. Hull turned
in his usual superlative perform
ance. He had four goals and near
ly won the game for Stanford,
when he put in three during the

final period.
Goalie George Stransky was
amazing. Time and again he foiled
what seemed to be sure goals.
Stransky stopped at least five
which were shot from but three
feet away.
Stanford played a very shoddy
first half against Fullerton Junior
College on Friday. By intermis
sion the score was tied 1-1 and
(here seemed little to choose be
tween the two teams.
The second half saw a disgusted

Stanford team swamp bewildered
Fullerton, scoring nine goals to
its one.
The .Stanford water polo team
on Saturday lost to USC and with
defeat went all hope of the AAVVU
championship. The game was a
wild, free-scoring, poorly offici
ated affair, in which Southern Cal
prevailed, after a double overtime,
9-8. With this frustrating loss
chaffing (hem, the Indians will
definitely be "up” for the Football
College game on Wednesday at

3:30.
The Indians fell behind 2-3 at
halftime and were still one goal
hack, 3-4, by the end of the third
period. A fourth quarter spurt,
in other words, three goals by
Marty Hull, put Stanford ahead
6-5. However, USC tied the game
on a much disputed penally shot
with 25 seconds to go.
