# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Loss of Goalie Not a Crushing Blow 
### Glenn Alford 
Stanford Soccer Coach Fred Priddle received a mixture of good
and bad news yesterday. While learning that Stanford definitely will
go to St. Louis as the Far West’s representative to the NCAA soccer'
playoffs, he also discovered that Kent Mueller, Stanford's fine goalie,
will be unable to play in those playoffs.
Mueller bruised a kidney and broke a small bone in his back
while charging out of the goal last Saturday to deflect a San Jose
shot. He was bowled over by Stanford's Bill Teusch, who was also
trying to stop the shot and couldn't check his momentum in time.
MUELLER PICKED himself off the ground though obviously
in pain, went back to the net to-stop a corner kick, and after Stan
ford cleared the ball to mid-field he collapsed.
Mueller’s loss hurts Stanford, though not as much as might be
expected. A team losing its first string goalie could be totally de
moralized, but Stanford loses no quality whatsoever, only depth.
He was second string when the season started, but moved to the
first team when regular goalie Tom Paulson hurt his tailbone at the
very beginning of the season. Mueller played so well that Priddle
kept him in the lineup. This allowed Paulson to recover slowly and
not reinjure himself. Paulson was just getting back to his top form
when Mueller was hurt.
STANFORD’S OPPONENT in the quarter-finals of the NCAA
tourney will be the St. Louis Billikens. The Tribe will fly to the Mid-
West this weekend to face St. Louis either on Saturday or Sunday
night. A win in that game would place Stanford in a Thanksgiving
Day game. Another triumph and Stanford would find itself in the
finals.
Priddle thinks his team can do it, and so do I. The Cards have
scored 43 goals and given up only 17 in compiling a 19-2 record. Stan
ford defeated CCSF, a feat accomplished only twice in the last four
years, and avenged one of their two losses in doing so.
