COMMITTEES:
AN AGONIZING RE-APPRAISAL
To those of you who stay out of your student government
because you believe the committee system is just an excuse
for inaction, let me cite an example to prove that a committee,
properly led and directed, can be a great force for good.
bast week the Student Council met at the Duluth College
of \etorinary Medicine and Belles Lettres to discuss purchasing
a new doormat for the students union. It was, I assure you, a
desperate problem because Sherwin K. Sigafoos, janitor of the
students union, threatened flatly to quit unless a new doormat
was installed immediately. “I’m sick and tired of mopping that
dirty old floor,” said Mr. Sigafoos, sobbing convulsively. (Mr.
Sigafoos, once a jolly outgoing sort, has been crying almost
steadily since the recent death of his pet wart hog who had
been his constant companion for 22 years. Actually, Mr. Sigafoos
is much better off without the wart hog, who tusked him
viciously at least once a day, but a companionship of 22 years
is, I suppose, not lightly relinquished. The college tried to give
Mr. Sigafoos a new wart hog—a frisky little fellow with floppy
ears and a waggly tail—but Mr. Sigafoos only turned his back
and (Tied the harder.)

Rut 1 digress. The Student Council met, discussed the door
mat for eight or ten hours, and then referred it to a committee.
There were some who scoffed then and said nothing would
ever be heard of the doormat again, but they reckoned without
Invictua Millstone.
Invictus Millstone, chairman of the doormat committee,
was a man of action —lithe and lean and keen and, naturally, a
smoker of Marlboro Cigarettes. Why do I say “naturally”?
Because, dear friends, active men and women don’t have time
to brood and bumble about their cigarettes. They need to be
certain. 1 hey must have perfect confidence that each time they
light up they will get the same gratifying flavor, the same
Selectrate filter, the same soft soft-pack, the same flip top
flip-top box. In brief, dear friends, they need to be sure it’s
Marlboro—for if ever a smoke was true and trusty, it’s Marlboro.
(let some soon. Get matches too, because true and trusty
though Marlboros are, your pleasure will be somewhat limited
unless you light them.
Well sir, Invictus Millstone chaired his doormat committee
with such vigor and dispatch that when the Student Council
met only one week later, he was able to rise and deliver the
following recommendations:
1. That the college build new schools of botany, hydraulic
engineering, tropical medicine, Indo-Germanic languages, and
millinery.
2. That the college drop football, put a roof on the stadium,
and turn it into a low-cost housing project for married students.
3. That the college raise faculty salaries by $5OOO per year
across the board.
4. That the college secede from the United States.
5. That the question of a doormat for the students union
be referred to a subcommittee.
So lot us hear no more defeatist talk about the committee
system. It cun be made to work! «i iwa m,«sbuinaa

You don’t need a committee to tell yon how good Marlboros
are. You just need yourself, a Marlboro, and a set of taste
buds. Buy some Marlboros soon at your favorite tobacco
counter.

2. That the college drop football, put a roof on the stadium,

AN AGONIZING RE-APPRAISAL
To those of you who stay out of your student government
because you believe the committee system is just an excuse
for inaction, let me cite an example to prove that a committee,
properly led and directed, can be a great force for good.
bast week the Student Council met at the Duluth College
of \etorinary Medicine and Belles Lettres to discuss purchasing
a new doormat for the students union. It was, I assure you, a
desperate problem because Sherwin K. Sigafoos, janitor of the
students union, threatened flatly to quit unless a new doormat
was installed immediately. “I’m sick and tired of mopping that
dirty old floor,” said Mr. Sigafoos, sobbing convulsively. (Mr.
Sigafoos, once a jolly outgoing sort, has been crying almost
steadily since the recent death of his pet wart hog who had
been his constant companion for 22 years. Actually, Mr. Sigafoos
is much better off without the wart hog, who tusked him
viciously at least once a day, but a companionship of 22 years
is, I suppose, not lightly relinquished. The college tried to give
Mr. Sigafoos a new wart hog—a frisky little fellow with floppy
ears and a waggly tail—but Mr. Sigafoos only turned his back

There were some who scoffed then and said nothing would
ever be heard of the doormat again, but they reckoned without
Invictua Millstone.
Invictus Millstone, chairman of the doormat committee,
was a man of action —lithe and lean and keen and, naturally, a
smoker of Marlboro Cigarettes. Why do I say “naturally”?
Because, dear friends, active men and women don’t have time
to brood and bumble about their cigarettes. They need to be
certain. 1 hey must have perfect confidence that each time they
light up they will get the same gratifying flavor, the same
Selectrate filter, the same soft soft-pack, the same flip top

Marlboro—for if ever a smoke was true and trusty, it’s Marlboro.
