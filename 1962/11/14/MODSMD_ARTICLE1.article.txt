Phillip Coombs spoke of the “sunny side of foreign policy— I
not the material that composes the screaming headlines, but the |
stuff of which ultimately real freedom, peace, and progress must j
be made,” last night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

ford this week as a member of
the visiting committee of the
School of Education, spoke on
“Education and United States
Foreign Policy.’’
Foreign policy is not static al
though the objectives are con
stant, Coombs said. The moans of
policy must be flexible to meet
the vast transformations going
on in the world today. In order to
meet (his demand, Coombs pro
posed adding a fourth dimension
to the political, economic, and
military components of foreign
policy. We need a human, educa
tional, or cultural component to
deal with the power inherent in
ideas and people, Coombs said.
COOMBS divided his lecture
into two parts, a consideration of
the changes that have taken place
in the post-war’ world and foreign
policy and a consideration of the
immediate and long range future.
Changes that have taken place
in the world are the explosions of
the populations of the family of
nations and the family of man,
the explosion of the knowledge
of our environment and the break
through in the fields of transpor
tation and communications.
Coombs also cited the more
subtle but Just as explosive forces
of the spread of the idea of prog
ress and the ideological struggle
taking place between the Com
munist and democratic societies.
America has taken a 180-degree
turn in foreign policy but needs
the fourth component of educa
tion today.
IN THi.S field America does not
have to start from scratch be
cause private and government
programs already exist.
