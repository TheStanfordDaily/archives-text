# IIR Book Collection for Africa To be Shipped to Asia Instead
## 
### 
Stanford students “Books for Africa” program has become a
“Books for Asia” project instead. Most of the I 18-sponsored col
lection of 75,000 used high school texts will go to the Asia Foun
dation because the Agency for International Development’s
promise of $20,000 to cover shipping costs failed to materialize.

■ An anonymous private donation
of $5OO will send three tons of
books, approximately 2600 vol
umes, to Stanford graduate Rich
ard Hawkins, who is now teach
ing at Mwpwapwa College in
Tanganyika.
JIM HAAS, cordinator of the
book drive for nearly two years,
reported that the Navy would
come to the HR’s rescue for the
second lime during the campaign.
Carleton Lowenberg, chief of the
Asia Foundation’s books program
will inspect the collection tomor
row in the old Whisman School
in Mountain View. Then the Navy
under "Project Handclasp” will
ship the books to the Philippines,
Japan, and Malaya. The Navy
previously loaned a San Bruno
warehouse for storage of the
books.
Haas and his committee began
canvassing California high
schools for their outdated texts
in 1960. Before negotiations be
tween the University and AID
broke down late this summer, the
books had been destined for
schools in eastern Africa.
HAAS commented, “Naturally,
I am disappointed because I feel
there is a greater need for the
hooks in Africa, but the decision
to send most of the books to Asia
was the only alternative.”
Volunteers interested in help
ing “Books for Asia” tomorrow
from 8 a.m.-5 p.m. at the Whis
man School should contact Jim
Haas at the HR.
