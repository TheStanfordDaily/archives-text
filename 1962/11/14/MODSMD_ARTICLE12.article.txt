The tuition raise announced
'yesterday will help improve the
' caliber of instruction through the
expansion of the faculty and
through increased salaries, said
Robert Beyers of the University
Relations-News Services Depart
ment yesterday.
Beginning next fall, tuition
; rates will increase $5O per quar
j ter for the Schools of Law, En
gineering, Mineral Sciences, and
! Humanities and Sciences.
INCREASING operating costs
necessitated the increase, Beyers
continued. During 1962, for ex
ample, the University will receive
$11.7 million in tuition and fees,
yet will spend about $15.7 million
on instruction. This figure ex
cludes costs of libraries, aids, and
administration.
Student financial aid has in
creased ten-fold in the last ten
years as have loan funds. The
PACE program is seeking $lO
million for student programs.
Boyers said, $7 million of which
! will go for scholarships and
loans.
