# SPAIN IN TURMOIL
## Fate of Democracy in Spain Rests Partly in Hands of American People

(Editor’s note: Before return
ing to (he U.S. from the Helsinki
Youth Festival, the author spent
six days in Madrid with Allard
J.owensteiii, who was at the time
carrying on extensive talks with
the various factions of the Span
ish Opposition. This article is the
last of a two-part series.)

The second day in Madrid I
helped record the tale of the wife
of one of the Asturian miners
who had been arrested during the
strikes last spring. Only after a
careful check, making sure that
we were alone, did she begin her
halting narrative, telling how her
husband and eleven of his com
panions had been arrested for
taking part in the strikes and
were taken to the Provincial pris
on at Vizcaya.
The men wore not told the
charges against them until they
were told what to confess while
they were being tortured. Not un
til three days after the arrests
did the wife find out where her
husband was and it was 24 days
before she was able to speak to
him.
HE TOLD her of the way the
prisoners had been hung by their
thumbs and lashed with cats-o’
nine-tails with little metallic tips,
how they were forced to kneel on
gravel and garbanzos (a prickly
shelled pea—chick-pea) while
guards sat on their shoulders and
insulted them, how their finger
tips were singed with matches,
how they were beaten with clubs
and hoses; there were many more
unmentionable tortures.
She told of the worker who
when informed that he would
have to undergo 30 days of these
tortures if he would not divulge
the names of those who had led
the strikes, chose to take his life
by slashing his jugular vein and
wrists. A guard, on seeing the
blood flowing out from under the
cell door rushed him to the hos
pital where he was revived with
transfusions. But when he came

to, he once again tore off the ban
dages crying to the doctor that
he could not go back and face the
tortures.
We not only spoke with the
workers but; also with bankers,
clergymen, liberals in the govern
ment, “intellectuals” and stu
dents.
LATE ONE evening we had a
rendezvous with a secretary of
one of the socialist youth groups
who told about the wave of stu
dent arrests in Valencia, Barce
lona and Madrid following the
student sympathy demonstra
tions. The way these students are
tried is even more farcical than
Castro’s drumhead trials. The
charges against them are usual
ly “military rebellion,” an of
fense which is characterized by
any act contrary to public order.
The trials are announced 24
hours beforehand; the defendant
must choose his counsel from a
list of military lawyers; he may
submit his defense in writing
only, and there can be nothing
added during the trial; the pris
oner’s dossier can be opened only
within the 24 hours preceding the
trial and no appeal is allowed.
The sentences range from six
months to 10 years. Another
charge frequently used is “illegal
organization” which incurs even
heavier penalties than military
rebellion.
The student also told of the
spies in the classrooms wailing to
report dissident elements and of
the state controlled SEJ, the only
legal student union. During other
conversations we learned that the
repressive measures, formerly re
served for critical members of
the lower classes, were now being
levied against members of the
upper classes as well. Nicolas
Sartorius, the son of a Spanish
Admiral and general, who was
imprisoned, tortured and beaten,
is a case in point. One student
group had 143 members, 142 of
which were in jail; the remaining
member wqs under close observa
tion and the only way to commu
nicate with him over the phone
was by code.

The point which was constant
ly being brought up was that, in
the eyes of the Spanish people,
the United States was rapidly
changing its role. At one time
looked to as the hope of the dem
ocratic forces, it is now turning
everyone in the opposition to the
left. Franco wants U.S. support
for Spain’s application for mem
bership in the Common Market,
and its claim on its territories in
North Africa. It wants more U.S.
military (“to fight Communism”)
and economic aid and —as strange
as this may sound it wants the
bases retained.
MANY SPANISH leaders feel
that the last chance for the U.S.
to change its course will come
next spring when the bases come
up for renegotiation. Their stra
tegic value has often been ques
tioned. And as John Gunther
points out in “Inside Europe To
day”: ... it is always danger
ous for a democracy, like the
U.S., to become too closely in
volved with a dictator or semi
dictator, no matter how conveni
ent this may seem to he. It is the
people who count in the long run,
and no regime is worth support
ing if it keeps citizens down—if
only for the simple reason that
they will kick it out in lime.”
Already Franco is raising the
cry against Communism, paving
the way for renegotiations. His
Ministry of Information and
Tourism promises a free press,
failing to mention that the new
form of censorship—self-censor
ship will increase the tension
rather than decrease it. “You
know, in Spain it is still not
possible to preach the word of
God without terror?” was a com
ment which brought to mind an
other control.
In the words of Hugh Thomas,
noted scholar of the Spanish
Civil War, “No one should think
that because the second Republic
failed, democracy is unworkable
in Spain.” Much of the decision
on whether or not Spain is to
have the opportunity to establish
a democracy rests in the hands of
the American people.
