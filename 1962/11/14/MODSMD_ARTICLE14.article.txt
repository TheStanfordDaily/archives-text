Editor, The Daily:
The announced tuition raise
probably will not be of more than
passing interest to students
whose tuition is provided by their
families or by scholarships. But
for those students who are forced
to work during the school year
because they are not wealthy, be
cause their grades are low, or be
cause they dislike taking money
from their parents, the increase
will he a severe financial blow
which will force a few students
out of school despite the prom
ised extra aid. As one faced by
this possibility, I claim the right
as a member of the Stanford fam
ily to comment and question.
The administration announced
in the spring of 1961 that tuition
would be raised once every three
years, starting in the fall of 1961.
Any one class was to incur only
one increase. Simple math reveals
the next increase should occur in
full 1964, not fall 1963. And the
Class of 1964 has now incurred
two raises. Is the printed word of
the administration to be believed
by the students?
The world is told the tuition
raises and PACE are needed to
maintain Stanford’s place as a
great university. This claim is
granted without disputing its in
herent assumption. The meager
ness of the library has received
national mention. Many courses
are given by instructors who,
though they know the subject
well, cannot teach it to their stu
dents. There is a need for class
rooms. So, in the face of needs
for books, teachers, and rooms—
the very heart of any university
purporting to greatness, what is
the first visible use of the new
money? The new Union. A union
is necessary as a meeting place
for faculty and students. But I
wonder how many students would
name a bowling alley, a pool hall,
a new barber shop, a travel bu
reau, and executive offices and
meeting rooms for the adminis
tration puppet show, i.e. student
government, as more necessary to
their education than better books,
profs, and rooms. While tuition
does not go directly into the build
ings, I think every student feels
a few of his pennies paid for Tre
sidder. I ask if tuition must be
raised more than planned, why
were not the vital ingredients of a
great university obtained first
and the frills added later?
