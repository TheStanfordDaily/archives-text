## Atlantic Community: Balance of Power Or Community of Mutual Interest? 
### TOM GREY IIR Political Analyst 
It may be that those who believe that a genuine Atlantic Com
munity is on the way, and see as evidence for this the strong develop
ment of the Common Market, are seriously confusing two things.
The first is a broad federation or close alliance of all the nations of
the “Western World”—dedicated to democratic ideals, and united by
culture, common interest, and op-4 —-

position to Soviet expansionism.
The second is a strong federal
Europe.
THESE TWO may well be in
compatible. Western Europe,
dominated by Germany and
France, has since the war become
a powerful and rapidly growing
economic unit through the reduc
tion of internal tariffs and the
creation of a common external
tariff. Though the Market’s ex
ports and imports have shown an
initial rise, the general tendency
in recent years has been a strong
advance in the standard of living
of the Western European popula
tion.
If this development continues,
we can foresee a gradual wage
price spiral in these countries,
leading eventually to a U.S.-style
economy, with its emphasis on
the affluent domestic consumer.
This means a relative de-empha
sis on keeping prices competitive
in the international market, and
could result in a relatively self
contained area with a high living
standard.
Such an area would no doubt
increasingly develop political self
consciousness, “European” na
tional pride, and some kind of
federal state apparatus. It would
be unlikely to continue a foreign
policy which was simply an ad
junct of U.S. anti-Sovietism.
TWO COURSES would be open
to it. First, it could gradually
turn its vast economic resources
to fulfilling its defense needs, de
velop a nuclear capability, a mis
sile force, and a large standing
army. As it became a factor in
the international military bal
ance, Europe could assert itself
as a third force in the world, and
could follow a foreign policy of
its own choosing, knowing that it
was in a strong bargaining posi
tion vis-a-vis both the Soviet bloc

and the United States.
Second, it could forego the ex
pensive paraphernalia of modern
international blackmail, and neu
tralize itself militarily. It could
reach an accommodation with the I
Soviet Union, withdrawing itself j
from the Western military camp
in return for trade concessions in
Eastern Europe. Such an accom
modation might even include the
demilitarization and partial au
tonomy of the communist states
of Eastern Europe.
Such a development might seem i
far-fetched at first, but the fob j
lowing facts should be taken into
account. 1) The Soviet bloc is
proving less and less of an eco
nomically viable unit Czecho
slovakia, East Germany, and Po
land all hadly need trade with (he
west; 2) The removal of Ameri
can military power from Europe
would bo a more than tempting
quid pro quo for Russia.
FURTHER, the Common Mar
ket may not be ideologically so
close to us as we think. As sev
eral British elder statesmen
pointed out last week, France has
moved to an autocratic govern
ment, and there are persistent
doubts about how strong democ
racy is in West Germany—doubts
which have not been lessened by
the recent “Der Spiegel” affair.
Both as a matter of economic
advantage, and because of its geo
political situation, Western Eu
rope is quite likely to opt for a
“third position,” with ties to both
East and West, rather than turn
to a close and unified Atlantic
Community.
Events of recent months have
made it less and less likely that
Britain will ever join the Com
mon Market. Public sentiment in
Europe—particularly in Catholic
Europe, which dominates the
Common Market—is by no means
markedly pro-British. To say that
British public sentiment is not
pro-Continent would be an under
statement.
THE FUTURE of the Atlantic 1
Community is quite probably not I
the rosy vision sketched in my I
last article. More likely, Europe
will continue to grow strong and
unified, and as it does so. become j
more and more independent of
the United States. Britain is liable
to remain a third element, less |
powerful than the other two but i
clearly independent of both of
them. The Atlantic Community
will then remain what it has al
ways been except for the abnor
mal post-war period—a balance
of powers, rather than a commu
nity of mutual interest.
