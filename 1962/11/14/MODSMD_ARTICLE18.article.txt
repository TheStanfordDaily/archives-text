## Appointment of Judicial Officers To Replace Election System 
### JAMES WOOLSEY 
During the last several years there have boon many complaints
leveled against the government of the ASSU, its structure as well as
its over all purposes.
It has become increasingly elear that certain changes are essen
tial if student government is to be a focus for meaningful student
activity. Suggestions have been+

solicited from living groups and
organizations for nearly a year,
land many of these have been in
corporated ifito the new docu
jment. It is not anticipated that
each of you will heartily endorse
all of the new answers; there will
be no campaign to try to persuade
you that this document is a pana
cea. We do submit it to you, how
ever, as a framework for a more
rational, representative student
government, one which will en
courage Stanford students to re
alize their potentials and to fulfill
their responsibilities in both the
university community and the
outside world.
IN THIS context we must ex
amine the judicial system of the
I proposed Constitution. Any suc
|cessful judicial system must have
two principal features: it must
be clearly structured and it must
(enjoy the confidence of those
| over whom it has jurisdiction.
I The revision of the Stanford ju
dicial system was undertaken in
i order to create the first of these
(vital conditions and to significant
ly improve the ,second.
The structure of the ASSU ju
dicial system has been a constant
[source of befuddlement to those
j connected with it. Students have
I long been confused about and un
duly suspicious of the deans’ role
in the judicial process.
Since in many cases it was the
job of the deans’ office to deter
mine which judicial council had
jurisdiction, students often felt
that the deans always led council
members by the hand through
mazes of sometimes-followed
I precedent and expedient ly-flexiblc
liniversity policy.
I STUDENT confidence in the ju
| dicial system was also weakened
by its lack of formal structure,
or, less euphemistically, by the
fact that it was not really a sys
tem at all. Although the old con
stitution made it possible for a
higher council to review the de
cisions of lower councils, no for
mal machinery for such review
was provided.
Unclear structure and confus
ing paths of appeal and recall
were not, however, the only
sources of student and adminis
tration criticism. It was general
ly agreed that as a process of
choosing judicial council mem
bers, all campus elections were
more than unsatisfactory. Many
potentially-excellent judicial coun
cil members hesitated to subject
themselves to the pressure and
the political rat-race of an elec
tion.
The old adage, “The judicial
mind does not seek election,” has
here contained more than a ker
nel of truth. This reluctance was
clearly evidenced by the dearth
of candidates for judicial, posi
tions from many living areas; off
campus residents, for example,
often felt it useless to oppose a
candidate having the financial
and political backing of an entire
fraternity. It was felt that some
sort of procedure could be found
which would make it equally pos
sible for all capable students to
serve in this important and theo
retically non-political capacity.
FINALLY, a glance at the cam
paign posters of the last few
years shows eloquently (hat, in
choosing judicial council mem
bers, the process of an all-campus
election does very little to con
vince anyone of the seriousness
of purpose or the integrity of the
Stanford judicial system.
Several changes, which should
go far toward eliminating these
difficulties, are being submitted
to you for approval in the new
I constitution. First of all, the sec

retaries of the Judicial Council.
' Men’s Council, and Women’s
(Council are made specifically re
! sponsible for keeping records, re
| viewing regularly the decisions
| of subordinate councils, receiving
I complaints, and presenting evi
dence to the proper council. In
border-line cases of jurisdiction
;<do six or seven men constitute
a fraternity “as a whole”?), the
(chairman of Men’s Council will
arbitrate after consulting the
j subordinate councils involved,
i Men’s Council will continue to re
l fer cases on a permanent basis
to those subordinate councils
which function responsibly (cer
! tain fraternity and Stern house
Councils, Freshman Men’s Conn
j oil) but may withdraw this right,
I as it can now, if the subordinate
[council should begin to neglect
(its obligations and responsibili
ties.
j Secondly, since all complaints
will be referred to and through
(the council system, there will be
i no more basis for the charge that
the deans are the major-domos
| behind the student councils.
Finally, Men’s Council will be
| appointed twice a year in groups
(of two and three by a board con
[ sisting of the ASSU president or
| his representative, two members
of Men’s Council, and two mem
bers of legislature; Women’s
(Council will he appointed by a
j similar board consisting of the
president of the AWS or her rep
j resentative, two members of
Women’s Council, and two mem
| bers of legislature. A system of
written applications and try-outs,
[ similar to the system of sponsor
I selection, will give everyone, even
(the non-politicians, an opportuni
ty to apply.
