Editor, The Daily:
Dean Winbigler’s statesman
like position on overnights, as re
ported in Tuesday’s Daily, seems
to be “Either go along complete
j ly with what the Administration
wants or we’ll really put it to
| you.” This is what is known at
j Stanford as “Responsible Student
j Government.”
[ I was one of the six (out of
sixteen) irresponsible student
governors who voted against the
additional overnight restrictions
last Thursday. The reasons seem
ed quite simple: Legislature had
j already voted enough additional
!l ed tape to protect the honor of
the most virginal Branner fresh
man. The proposed further re
strictions would have
1 put the President and So
jcial Chairman of the sponsoring
group in unreasonable jeopardy.
2 —made it virtually impossible
to hold an overnight anywhere
except in the Cabana motel.
Ordinarily, when a by-law
amendment is defeated it is not
reproposed for a decent interval,
usually at least a year. Now how
ever the Administration has
spoken, and our responsible stu
dent leaders are falling all over
each other to push it through this
week. Responsible to whom?
When it was asked last Thursday
j how many of the legislators had
! even discussed the issue with
their constituents, four people
I raised their hands and the rest
just laughed.
| This is an issue of real impor
! tance. thkt will affect the quality
of social life at Stanford nega
tively if it is railroaded through.
There is still time to coerce your
i LASSU representative to vote
“irresponsibly,”
