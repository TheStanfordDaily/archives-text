## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Two Stanford players were in
cluded on the Northern California
Intercollegiate Soccer Conference
All-NCISC team announced yes
terday by the NCISC Coaches.
In all, Stanford placed four men
on the first and second teams,
while Cal, third place finisher in
t he league, placed seven. City Col
lege of San Francisco, though in
eligible to send its twice-beaten

team to the NCAA playoffs be
cause of its junior college rating,
placed three men on the All-
NCISC team.
Stanford Coach Fred Priddle ex
pressed amazement that Cal could
place so many of its players on
the honor squad while finishing
third in the conference, and was
even more amazed that the best
goalie in the nation, Gary DeLong
of CCSF, should he placed on the
second team, while a Cal goalie
that he rated as no better than
the third or fourth best that Stan
ford has faced this year could be
named to the first team of the
honor squad.
Stanford selections were for
ward A1 Nnoli and halfback Bill
Teusch, first team; forwards Klas
Bergman and Stu Rawlings, sec
ond team; and goalie Kent Muel
ler, fullbacks Rich Lonergan and
Sandy Pofahl and forward Ed
Clark, honorable mention.
Nnoli, Stanford co-captain along
with Pofahl, was the classiest
playmaker and best ball-handler
in the league. He wasn’t a high
scorer, with many of his shots
missing the net by the smallest
of margins.
Teusch was a bulwark of the
Stanford defense that allowed
only 17 goals in 12 games. He
reached his peak in the USF game
that allowed Stanford to reach the
NCAA soccer playoffs. Teusch
allowed the great USF forward,
Jim Lynch, all-conference for four
years, only two shots at the goal
in the entire game.
Rawlings was the leading Stan
ford scorer, wrapping up his first
year of varsity soccer with four
goals to defeat San Jose State 6-4.
Bergman, a late starter because
of mononeucleosis, played his best
ball against USF and San Jose,
setting up plays with brilliant
passing.
Of the eight Stanford players
named to the honor team, only
two, Pofahl and Teusch. graduate.
