# Frosh Cage Star Benched by Injury
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
For Iwo years freshman Ray
Kosanke, a considerably bigger
than average man at 6’9”, has
lived with a bigger than average
dread. That dread Is now gone,
but his much-anticipated debut on
the Stanford basketball squad
will be postponed.
Two years ago, while playing
basketball in a summer league,
Kosanke injured his knee at
tempting to rebound. The extent
of the Injury was not determined
then, but the knee gave Ray a
good deal of pain. Twice he was
put on crutches to try to take
pressure off of the damaged
joint.
Ray is back on crutches for the
third time in two years, but now
the end of his worry is in sight.
He entered Stanford’s hospital
Thursday to have the much pul
off operation. The cartilage was
found to be damaged, but no liga
ments were torn.
Ray's reputation on the basket
ball court preceded him to Stan
ford this year. While playing for
Tucson High School, Ray was
named to the High School All-
American team, one of thirty
boys in the country to be so hon
ored. He averaged 24 points a
game in his senior year, one of
the big reasons why Tucson com
piled a 21 wins and 0 defeats rec
ord and won the State champion
ship.
Although immediate success
cannot be guaranteed in an oper
ation of this nature, Ray expects
to be playing again soon after the
Christmas holiday. This is great
news for Stanford’s basketball
hopes, and a big relief, after two
years of anxiety, for Ray Ko
sanke.
