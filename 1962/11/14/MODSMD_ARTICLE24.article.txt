# Handley, Connelly Pace Strong Running Attack as Frosh Complete 3-1 Season
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Led by a consistently produc
tive ground game and a rugged
defense, Stanford’s freshman
football team enjoyed a winning
season under coach Dan Stavely.
Although Stanford’s three wins in
four games were largely team ef
forts. many individuals distin
guished themselves as possible
future varsity stars.
In the first game, played here
on a field where duck blinds
wouldn’t have seemed out of
place, the Indians upset favored
USC by a 13-6 margin. Troy

scored first, Mike Garrett tally
ing from 48 yards out, but Stan
ford soon took the lead on a long
drive sparked by passes from
quarterback Mike Connelly to
halfback Pete Middlekauff. Ray
Handley’s 86-yard run in the final
quarter put the game out of SC's
reach.
NEXT THE CARDS topped San
Jose State, 21-12, rolling up a
21- lead in the first half. The
game was played in Stanford’s
Stadium, hut the crowd that view
ed it could have been housed com
fortably in a phone booth. Stan
ford's first two scores came as
the result of long sustained
drives. The marches were paced
by the running of Connelly,
Handley, and fullback Glenn
Myers.
The final Indian tally was
scored by Tom Fox, who raced
43 yards to the end zone on a
punt return. San Jose, utilizing
the pass-catch combination of
Ken Berry to Tim Knowles and
(he running of Charlie Harroway,
could do no better than make the
game close in the second half.
Traveling to Los Angeles for
their only away game, the In
dians had trouble containing
UCLA’s versatile quarterback
Rod Sherman and sustained their
only loss, falling to the Bruins
22- Sherman’s 203 yards gained
rushing and passing overshadow
ed fine performances by Handley
and Myers carrying the ball, and
Don Cook passing. Cook hit end
Joe Miller with a 67-yard touch
down pass on the final play of
the game.
STANFORD BOUNCED back
the next week, edging California
by a 3-0 score. Joel Kay’s fourth
quarter field goal broke the tie
in a game in which the ball
changed hands more times than a
copy of Playboy in the Wilbur
dorms. There were so many fum
bles, the game began to resemble
a soccer* match without goalies.
In the final moments, Cal’s quar
terback Jim Hunt fired four com
pletions to halfback Jerry Mosh
er, but. the drive fell short at
Stanford’s seven-yard line.
After the Cal game, the frosh
voted for the player they felt best
represented good sportsmanship
and ability both on and off the
field. Their choice was Ray Hand
ley. Handley’s playing record left
little to be desired; he led the
team in rushing, averaging six
yards per carry; total offense;
and pass receiving. He was sec
ond to Tom Fox in punt and kick
off returns, and third in tackles.

He also had one of the team’s
four pass interceptions.
ANOTHER STANDOUT per
former was Mike Connelly, whose
accumulation of 245-yard total
offense was just one yard less
than Handley’s effort. Connelly's
clevei' play-calling continually
sustained Card drives.
Glenn Myers, the Papoose full
back, also played fine hall all
year. Myers was the squad’s
third best rusher, and also led the
team in tackles.
STANFORD’S IMPRESSIVE
rushing attack would not have
been possible without the great
play of the interior line. Gary
Pettigrew, Delos Brown, Bill
Ogle, Lowell Wilson, Arnie
Krogh, and Roger Clay consist
ently opened up holes for the
runners and gave the passers ex
cellent protection.
On defense, Myers, Wilson,
John Mason, Tom Robesky, Pete
Middlekauff, Tom Ross, and
Craig Ritchey were the main rea
son why the Indians allowed only
slightly over 200 yards and ten
points per game. Averaging only
12 points itself, defense was a
vital part of the Tribe’s success
this year.
