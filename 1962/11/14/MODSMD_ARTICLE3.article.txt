C HINESE RECALL AMBASSADORS WASHINGTON—State De-;
partment officials yesterday reported evidence of far-ranging policy !
discussions taking place in the Far East wing of the troubled Sino-1
Soviet bloc.
They said Red China in recent weeks had called home for con- j
sultation its ambassadors in at least a dozen foreign countries, in
cluding all the Communist East European satellites.
State Department sources said the massive recall operation did
not appear to have stemmed directly from the Cuban crisis, since
some of the ambassadors were recalled before it reached its peak.

BRITISH TESTS LONDON Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
said Britain would be ready to call off its planned nuclear test in
Nevada if there was any chance of reaching agreement on a test ban
treaty. But Macmillan, under sharp attack by the press and opposi
tion political parties for deciding to hold the test, indicated he
thought chances of reaching a test ban treaty in time was unlikely.
