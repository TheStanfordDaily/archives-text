# Women Eat at Encina!
## 
### JAMES POAGE 
Undergraduate women are eat
| ing in Encina Dining Hall this
[year for the first time.
Encina has been primarily a!
i men's dining hall serving Crolh- j
ers Hall, Crothers Memorial Hall,
[off-campus students, and Toyon j
| independents, although graduate |
women have in previous years
eaten there.
, | The undergraduate women
1 come from Mariposa, which for-1
! merly housed graduates, and
. i from Huston, which last year
; : was the Women’s Rest Home.}
iThese residences presently lack)
. adequate dining facilities.
. | Lucile Allen. Dean of Women, j
. said that the women will eat
. i there the rest of this quarter al
j j though there are no present plans j
■ beyond that time. She said there
is “nothing permanent about it.”
5 j While coed dining exists, it is i
' admittedly small. Encina has 725
I meal ticket holders but only 67
»!aro women, and of that figure
[only 33 are undergraduate worn

Francis Walters, the Encina
1 j Food Director, in commenting on j
-[the coed dining in Encina, statedi
, j that the mixed dining created no j
1 problems. "I as director am de- [

lighted to have them here.” A
room was set aside for the wom
en to use if they wished, but they
usually prefer to eat in the regu
lar rooms.
The reaction of the students
j eating in Encina is overwhelm
! ingly favorable toward coed din
| ing. One senior from Mariposa
said that the meals were more
j interesting and enjoyable. Almost
all of the students claimed that
I coed mixing on an informal basis
j was beneficial.
j An off-campus senior who for
merly lived in Stern commented
that topics of conversation differ
ed from those in other men’s din
} ing halls, but this was the only
: difference he observed.
| Another student commented
| that you really have to watch
your manners with women eating
i in the dining hall. But its worth
j it, he added.
j The major complaint among
| the men is that there are too few
I women eating there. Most men
[are in favor of expanding the co
ed dining.
In commenting on the mixed
dining in Encina, many students
j mentioned that Encina differed
j slightly from other campus din
i ing facilities in that many gradu
j ate and foreign students eat
| there, and that this may have
been why the transition was
'made so easily.
