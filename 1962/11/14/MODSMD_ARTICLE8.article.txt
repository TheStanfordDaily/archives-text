### MARY KAY BECKER 
Three winners of the coveted |
Prix do la Critique, awarded by j
Paris critics to outstanding
young artists, are currently being i
represented in an exhibit of con- j
temporary expressionistic paint- j
ing at the Lanyon Art Gallery in
the Old Stanford Barn. The ar
tists Bernard Buffet, Sayed Ra
za, and Claude Weisbuch—demon
strate a divergence of the styles
of painting which have captured
this prize over the last 14 years.
The work of Buffet, who was
only 19 when he won the award,
falls into definite periods. Repre
sented in the exhibit are the still
i life period. 1947-50; his larger
works of 1954-56; and the period
of stark, so-called “concentration
camp’’ figures of 1951-53. Buffet
builds his pictures up in linear
patterns, often creating a mood
of forceful introspection. “L’ Es
pagnole,” a haunting portrait of
a woman, illustrates this charac
teristic.
Sayed Raza, who received the
award in 1956, employs in his
landscapes all the techniques of
i the abstract artist to achieve his
i personal form of expressionism.
This personal approach is exem
i plified in his painting, “Trishna”
(meaning “thirst”), a landscape
of a desert area.
Claude Weisbuch, last year’s
; I winner of the prize, uses the hu
’ man figure and anatomy as a ve
■ hide. “Par Id,” his largest work
; in the show, was among the
. paintings which won him the
> award. His linear build-up and en
crusted brush strokes give an
• unusual force to the “circus bark
. er.”
