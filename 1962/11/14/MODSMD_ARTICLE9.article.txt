# Gaieties Has Plot For First Time In 51-Year History
## 
### 
For the first time in its fifty
one year history, Big Game Gai
eties has a plot.
The plot, centering around the
adventures of two Stanford fresh
men when they first arrive on the j
Farm, will, according to director |
I Phil Ellis, unify the twenty origi- j
nal musical productions featured j
! in the show.
Called “Once Around the
j Quad,” the show will be set on
| the Stanford campus and at such j
student meeting places as |
j “Greedy's” ice cream parlor and |
j “Papa’s O.” Janice Wright and [
Wilbur Hall, typical freshmen, I
| bravely face hordes of Pre-Reg \
Com members, sponsors, frater- i
j nity men, appointments with ad
visers, the Freshman Convoca-
S tion, and the hustling of seniors,
j Random (Chappie Queen) Choice
j and Bart Bain.
j A drinking song, a fight song,
I a love song, and a new Alma
1 Mater will be heard in the show, j
I along with a scene featuring the'
Alpha Sigma Sigma guys and
j stunts “borrowed” from Rally |
i Com Big Game plans. The fresh- j
i man convocation will feature
speeches by the University Presi
dent, the ASSU President and the
I Dean of Students, and a parody
of the academic procession.
Gaieties will be presented next
week in Memorial Auditorium on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thurs
day at 8:30 and Friday at 9:30
; j after the Big Game bonfire,
j Tickets aie on sale at Tresidder
I Union Box Office and at Engi
-1 neering Corner.
