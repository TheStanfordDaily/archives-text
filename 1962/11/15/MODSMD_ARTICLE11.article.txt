# SRI Becomes World's Largest Research Center

Today a person can’t fly, write a check,
I or make a phone call without coming in
! contact with something that has been de
; velopcd at Stanford Research Institute.
Only 16 years ago. Stanford Research In
stitute was started. Then, in 1946, it con
| sisted of three people working in the Phy
; sics Building at Stanford. Today, in 1962,
: it is the largest independent, privately open-
I ated. non-profit scientific research organiza
tion in (he world. It employs over 2,000
| people, of whom over half are scientists and
j research specialists.
Its headquarters are in nearby Menlo Park,
| but SRI has branches in Pasadena, Wash
> ington, D.C., and Zurich. Switzerland; and
! offices are maintained in New York, London,
I Honolulu. Tokyo, Detroit, Milan and Madrid,
i Research teams are also located throughout
I the world, and SRI even has staff members
! on a converted yacht which sails all over the
| world taking data.
STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE was
i founded at the urging of West Coast busi
! ncssmen who felt the need for a research
; center on the West Coast and felt that Stan-
I ford could best fulfill what they had in mind.
Today, however, 70 per cent of the work done
at SRI originates on the East Coast, and 10
per cent of its research is international in
origin.
Stanford .Research Institute is not a part
of Stanford, but an affiliate of the Univer
sity. Members of the SRI Board of Directors
are elected by the Stanford Board of Trus
tees, and the President of the University is
ex officio Chairman of the Board. But hi all
other respects, SRI is like a separate corp
oration in which the Stanford Board of Trus
tees holds all the stock.
Although over thirty million dollars worth

I of research work is done at SRI each year,
| SRI is a non-profit organization. Anyone
i who wants a project done at SRI first sub
j mils his ideas or problems. This “clientele"
■ includes federal and foreign governments,
| businesses, associations, and even individuals.
If SRI agrees to undertake a project, the
i fee charged is equal to the cost of performing
the work plus a small percentage for over
head. SRI does not accept projects which
j would be merely repeat research or testing,
I unless there is a particular bug to be worked
out. All rights to developments belong to the
j client. SRI holds no patents, and all inven
j tions made at SRI are sold to interested
j firms.
STANFORD AND SRI cooperate in many
i ways. All personnel, facilities, and resources
j are shared. Many University projects are
; carried out in SRI laboratories, and some
| SRI staff members teach at Stanford. Stan
j ford frequently gives financial backing to
j SRI projects which are too advanced to at-
J tract other sponsors, and SRI pays Stanford
j a fee each year for the use of its library
j facilities. An example of this close coopora
! tion is the 150-foot radar saucer which was
i built by SRI engineers with Stanford funds
on Stanford property, and is operated by
both institutions.
In addition to scientific and engineering
research, SRI has great interest in economics
and business. A quarterly magazine, the
“Stanford Research Institute Journal,” and
a bi-monthly pamphlet, “.Research for Indus
try,” are both published at SRI. Each issue
of the “SRI Journal” is devoted to thoughts
and developments of top SRI personnel on
a subject of contemporary interest and im
portance, such as space travel or disarma
ment. “Research for Industry” summarizes
new developments and results of projects
which are of interest and merit.

Stanford students are welcome to consult
with experts in their fields of interest, bul
it is impossible to see all that goes on at SRI.
A great many of the current projects are
classified, and it would require two lull days
to thoroughly tour the facilities.
SKI DOES RESEARCH in four main areas
the life sciences, the physical sciences, en
gineering, and economics and management
sciences. New divisions of these sciences,
such as bionics and bioengineering, are con
stantly being created to meet new demands.
SRI reacts to as well as develops changes.
Today, a great amount of research work is
being concentrated upon space efforts. Many
projects are dropped because they are no
longer of any value, and many far-advanced
projects for which there is yet no need are
being developed.
Research work at SRI is commissioned
from every imaginable source. At the mo
ment, SRI is planning a system of elemen
tary education for Nationalist China, devel
oping a network of efficient transportation
in Nigeria, and studying the effects of sci
ence and technology on U.S. foreign policy
for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
ONE OF THE MOST outstanding exam
ples of the work done at SRI has been the
development of an electronic data system for
use in banking, called ERMA. Bank of Amer
ica bought ERMA; but new machines had to
be developed at SRI to make ERMA’s work
easier, such as check sorters and machines
which could “ read" the information on
checks. Today ERMA, or similar systems,
are used in 85 per cent of all American banks.
SRI expects even more expansion of its
fields in the future, as science becomes more
highly' specialized. Already, research is being
performed on cancer cures, food for astro
nauts. and rocket motors using liquid pro
pellants.
