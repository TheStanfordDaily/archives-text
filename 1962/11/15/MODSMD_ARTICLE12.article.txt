# Glover Explains Campus Partisan Politics Policy
## 
### NORMAN GREENBERG 
The student gatherings in front
of Tresidder during the Cuban
crisis and the Daily’s advocacy of
gubernatorial candidate Pat
Brown are not inconsistent with
the University’s policy concerning
partisan politics, according to
Frederic O. Glover, executive as
sistant to the president.
Glover also said that President
Sterling’s advocacy of Proposi
tion 13 is the University’s advo
cacy and reflects the best inter
ests of Stanford as an institution
of higher learning; the bill is not
considered partisan. Partisan poli
tics,, labeled by “Time” magazine
of Nov. 9, 1962, as an example of
Stanford’s “quaint old ways,” re
mains a campus issue.
THE FOUNDING GRANT ini
tially established the University’s
policy: “The University must be
forever maintained upon a strict
ly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis. It must never become an
instrument in the hands of any
political party or any religious

sect or organization,”
Mrs. Stanford, in an address
before the Trustees on Oct. 3,
1902, added, “I desire that the
University shall forever be kept
out of politics. ... It is possible
that cases might arise where a
mere suggestion might be under
stood to be a covert demand.”
UNTIL J94H, partisan politics
was never a contested issue. The
Young Republicans and Young
Democrats quickly complied with
the University’s position and hold
their activities apart from the
campus.
Although the election of Her
bert Hoover to the Presidency in
1928 inspired enthusiasm through
out the campus, the Rally Com
mittee assured the student body
in the Stanford Daily of Novem
ber 5, 1928 that “the greeting
| for President Hoover] will be es
sentially non-partisan in spirit,
and not a political rally in any
sense.” The administration was
firm, the student body secure,
and all went well.
Ever since 1948, however, w'hen
students protested denial of free
speech, the University’s position
concerning partisan politics has
been questioned and attacked by
a great number of student
groups. This culminated, last
year, in the administration’s ex
pulsion from campus of the For
um for the Discussion of Non-Vi
olent Alternatives to War, despite
the protests of the student Legis
lature.
WITH THE INTENTION of fi
nally explaining the University’s
policy, Glover said that the fol
lowing statement may be accept
ed as the policy of the president,
until a clearer is issued within
the next few wrecks: “It is the
policy of the University that the
name of Stanford should not bo
exploited in support of any par
ticular political or social cause
. . . except where necessary, on
the University’s own initiative, to
protect its institutional interests
and discharge its educational ob
ligations.”
Glover added, “There is strong
evidence to suggest that partisan
commitments and advocacy tend
to handicap objective discussion
of important issues.” Students are
not being deprived of important
privileges, Glover said.
GLOVER STRESSES that this
is not a new interpretation of the
Founding Grant’s original state
ment, rather the University has
always interpreted partisan poli
tics in the same light. Specific
rules may change, but the Univer
sity’s over-all policy has never
varied, Glover said.
To prove Stanford’s liberal at
titude towards partisan politics,
Glover cited the establishment of
the Political Union in 1953, de
spite delay due to student apathy,
as representing the results of the
University’s search for an effec
tive means of political communi
cation.
THE UNIVERSITY did not in
terfere in any manner with the
speakers who were invited to the
campus last year, Agnes Nohren
berg, Director of the Committee
on Public Exercises, said. Those
speakers who have come to the
campus in the past two years in
clude the following; (1960-61)
John Kennedy, Richard Nixon,
Barry Goldwaler, and William F.
Buckley; (1961-62) Joseph Shell,
socialist Norman Thomas, Dr.
Fred Schwartz, and Gus Hall,
chairman of the American Com
munist Party, who was not al
lowed to speak on the UC cam
pus in Berkeley.
