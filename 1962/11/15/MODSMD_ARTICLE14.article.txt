# Cornell Drafts New NSA Election Plan
## 
### 
Cornell University’s National
Student Association commission
has drafted a new system for the
election in February of six dele
gates to the NSA Congress.
One delegate will be the presi
dent of the Executive Board. Two
others will be members of the
Cornell NSA commission, which
is chosen by the Executive Board
on recommendation of the com
mission. One of these two dele
gates will be the commission’s
chairman. The remaining three
delegates will be elected by the
entire Cornell student body.
Cornell’s NSA commission will
designate several issues upon
which the candidates will be ex
pected to express their views. The
candidates will also be expected
to answer questions from other
candidates and interested parties
concerning these views.
