# Increase in Tuition
## 
### 
By raising tuition for next year from $1260 to $lllO, the Uni
versity has become Ibe target for extensive and caustic criticism.
Most of this criticism is unjust; much of it is misdirected.
The Universityâ€™s critics argue that the increase in tuition places
an unreasonable financial burden upon students, yet the fathers
of most Stanford students earn substantial salaries as businessmen,
business executives, and professional white-collar workers. In
order to aid students from less wealthy families, the University
and other agencies have appropriated six million dollars this year
for scholarships, fellowships, and loans.
Nevertheless, the critics contend that the parents of a great
many students are neither so wealthy as to afford the increased
tuition nor so needy as to be eligible for scholarships. This criti
cism may be just to a certain extent, but if it is just, the University
should be criticised for an inadequate program of financial aid,
not for its policy of raising tuition. The University is entirely con
sistent with egalitarian principles in charging high tuition to those
who can afford it and in aiding those who cannot afford it.
