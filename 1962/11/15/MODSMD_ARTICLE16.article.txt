# Divisive Effect of Tribalism Most Destructive in Kenya
## 
### HILARY SIMS 
One of the salient problems of
“uhuru” (freedom) in East Afri
ca is tribalism. In Tanganyika
alone have the divisive effects of
tribalism been kept to a mini
mum.
In Uganda there is a sharp an
tagonism between the four agri
cultural, Bantu kingdoms (which
are solidly unified around their
kings) and the pastoral Nilotic
peoples for whom tribal senti
ments have been modified by a
desire for unity as a nation state.
To placate the autonomous de
sires of the kingdoms, Uganda,
made independent last October 9,
has been established as a semi
federal, semi-unitary state; the
kingdoms do retain some powers
which in other areas are adminis
tered by the central government.
IN KENYA the destructive as
pects of tribalism are at their
worst. The principal antagonism
stems from the distrust of the
numerically superior, politically
conscious Kikuyu from whose
depths sprang the Man Mau. The
less-developed, smaller tribes fear
that their welfare will be slighted
for the better-educated, larger
tribes.
At Makerere University Col
lege, which draws its students
from all three territories, tribal
ism is exhibited in a modified
microcosm. The college, by mix
ing members of different tribes
in the halls, serves to remove the
blind mistrust of one tribe for
another.
Mistrust and antipathy though
lessened still exist and are mani
fested in the tendency of mem
bers of one tribe to monopolize
one table at meals and talk in
their vernacular to the exclusion
of others. The less sophisticated
girls make it clear they would
never marry outside their tribe,
for to do so would be virtual ex
ile.
OCCASIONAL slurs are made
against people on the basis of a
negative (to another tribe) tribal
characteristic. The a-political Ba
ganda disparage the intense na
tionalism of the Kikuyu.
Recognition of tribal differ
ences often surmounts racial dif
ferences. One afternoon in Kenya
a Kikuyu boy took me and an
African girl out to visit his old
high school. We got onto a bus
and he looked at the other people
in the bus and looked at the two
of us and said, “you know, you
two are the only non-Kikuyu on
the bus.”

The Tanganyikan students were
very sensitive about their tribal
backgrounds. Since the ideology
of Tanganyika is to emphasize
unity and de-emphasize races and

tribes, the students made a point
of identifying themselves as Tan
ganyikans without any tribal ad
jectives. They have the least sym
pathy for the tribal hostilities ex
hibited by students from other
territories.
AROUND the campus were
signs in tribal languages adver
tising meetings of the tribal
clubs, organized to bring mem
bers together socially and to dis
cuss, in their own language, prob
lems at home.
The tribal clubs are giving way
however to the more dynamic
“national” discussion groups
which concentrate on talking out
problems (including tribal con
flict) besetting their territories
and arriving at some resolution.
Sharp, but well thought out ex
changes characterized these meet
ings, and the resolutions were
often embodied in letters to na
tional leaders in an attempt to
add a significant voice to deliber
ations at that level. Many stu
dents upon graduation move
right up the political ladder.
Some were already the leaders of
“Youth Wings” to political par
ties. It was through Makerere
students that I got on the inside
of political developments in their
territories.
Students are well aware of the
damaging effects of tribalism, and
a discussion of its place in the
university highlighted the school
newspaper for a couple of weeks.
When the local tribe, the Bagan
da. developed a strictly tribal
party based on loyalty to their
king, most other students dissoci
ated themselves from “such pro
vincialism.”
IT WAS interesting to be in on
the change of opinions, the loos
ening of stereotypes by students.
Enforced proximity, common in
terests—in sports and academia
broke down the previously blind
cultural barriers and students
learned to recognize each other as
individuals. One Uganda girl con
fided to me that before coming
to Makerere she thought mem
bers of her neighboring tribe
were literally “red devils.” Now
she counts members of that tribe
among her close friends.
Living at Makerere as a regu
lar student gives one the unique
opportunity to know students
from various tribes well, go with
them into their home districts,
learn from them. What about their
tribes they consider set them
apart from their contemporaries;
and to see, in this vertigo of
change which is Africa, the con
stantly shifting interaction be
tween their tribal heritages and
the ideas of nationalism and mod
ern development.

“national” discussion groups
which concentrate on talking out
problems (including tribal con
flict) besetting their territories
and arriving at some resolution.
Sharp, but well thought out ex
changes characterized these meet
ings, and the resolutions were
often embodied in letters to na
tional leaders in an attempt to
add a significant voice to deliber
ations at that level. Many stu
dents upon graduation move
right up the political ladder.
Some were already the leaders of
“Youth Wings” to political par
ties. It was through Makerere
students that I got on the inside
of political developments in their
territories.
Students are well aware of the
damaging effects of tribalism, and
a discussion of its place in the
university highlighted the school
newspaper for a couple of weeks.
When the local tribe, the Bagan
da. developed a strictly tribal
party based on loyalty to their
king, most other students dissoci
ated themselves from “such pro
vincialism.”
IT WAS interesting to be in on
the change of opinions, the loos
ening of stereotypes by students.
Enforced proximity, common in
terests—in sports and academia
broke down the previously blind
cultural barriers and students
learned to recognize each other as
individuals. One Uganda girl con
fided to me that before coming
to Makerere she thought mem
bers of her neighboring tribe
were literally “red devils.” Now
she counts members of that tribe
among her close friends.
Living at Makerere as a regu
lar student gives one the unique
opportunity to know students
from various tribes well, go with
them into their home districts,
learn from them. What about their
tribes they consider set them
apart from their contemporaries;
and to see, in this vertigo of
change which is Africa, the con
stantly shifting interaction be
tween their tribal heritages and
the ideas of nationalism and mod
ern development.
One of the salient problems of
“uhuru” (freedom) in East Afri
ca is tribalism. In Tanganyika
alone have the divisive effects of
tribalism been kept to a mini
mum.
In Uganda there is a sharp an
tagonism between the four agri
cultural, Bantu kingdoms (which
are solidly unified around their
kings) and the pastoral Nilotic
peoples for whom tribal senti
ments have been modified by a
desire for unity as a nation state.
To placate the autonomous de
sires of the kingdoms, Uganda,
made independent last October 9,
has been established as a semi
federal, semi-unitary state; the
kingdoms do retain some powers
which in other areas are adminis
tered by the central government.
IN KENYA the destructive as
pects of tribalism are at their
worst. The principal antagonism
stems from the distrust of the
numerically superior, politically
conscious Kikuyu from whose
depths sprang the Man Mau. The
less-developed, smaller tribes fear
that their welfare will be slighted
for the better-educated, larger
tribes.
At Makerere University Col
lege, which draws its students
from all three territories, tribal
ism is exhibited in a modified
microcosm. The college, by mix
ing members of different tribes
in the halls, serves to remove the
blind mistrust of one tribe for
another.
Mistrust and antipathy though
lessened still exist and are mani
fested in the tendency of mem
bers of one tribe to monopolize
one table at meals and talk in
their vernacular to the exclusion
of others. The less sophisticated
girls make it clear they would
never marry outside their tribe,
for to do so would be virtual ex
ile.
OCCASIONAL slurs are made
against people on the basis of a
negative (to another tribe) tribal
characteristic. The a-political Ba
ganda disparage the intense na
tionalism of the Kikuyu.
Recognition of tribal differ
ences often surmounts racial dif
ferences. One afternoon in Kenya
a Kikuyu boy took me and an
African girl out to visit his old
high school. We got onto a bus
and he looked at the other people
in the bus and looked at the two
of us and said, “you know, you
two are the only non-Kikuyu on
the bus.”

The Tanganyikan students were
very sensitive about their tribal
backgrounds. Since the ideology
of Tanganyika is to emphasize
unity and de-emphasize races and

tribes, the students made a point
of identifying themselves as Tan
ganyikans without any tribal ad
jectives. They have the least sym
pathy for the tribal hostilities ex
hibited by students from other
territories.
AROUND the campus were
signs in tribal languages adver
tising meetings of the tribal
clubs, organized to bring mem
bers together socially and to dis
cuss, in their own language, prob
lems at home.

from all three territories, tribal
ism is exhibited in a modified
microcosm. The college, by mix
ing members of different tribes
in the halls, serves to remove the
blind mistrust of one tribe for
another.
Mistrust and antipathy though
lessened still exist and are mani
fested in the tendency of mem
bers of one tribe to monopolize
one table at meals and talk in
their vernacular to the exclusion
of others. The less sophisticated
girls make it clear they would
never marry outside their tribe,
for to do so would be virtual ex
ile.
OCCASIONAL slurs are made
against people on the basis of a
negative (to another tribe) tribal
characteristic. The a-political Ba
ganda disparage the intense na
tionalism of the Kikuyu.
Recognition of tribal differ
ences often surmounts racial dif
ferences. One afternoon in Kenya
a Kikuyu boy took me and an
African girl out to visit his old
high school. We got onto a bus
and he looked at the other people
in the bus and looked at the two
of us and said, “you know, you
two are the only non-Kikuyu on
the bus.”

The Tanganyikan students were
very sensitive about their tribal
backgrounds. Since the ideology
of Tanganyika is to emphasize
unity and de-emphasize races and

tribes, the students made a point
of identifying themselves as Tan
ganyikans without any tribal ad
jectives. They have the least sym
pathy for the tribal hostilities ex
hibited by students from other
territories.
AROUND the campus were
signs in tribal languages adver
tising meetings of the tribal
clubs, organized to bring mem
bers together socially and to dis
cuss, in their own language, prob
lems at home.
The tribal clubs are giving way
however to the more dynamic
“national” discussion groups
which concentrate on talking out
problems (including tribal con
flict) besetting their territories
and arriving at some resolution.
Sharp, but well thought out ex
changes characterized these meet
ings, and the resolutions were
often embodied in letters to na
tional leaders in an attempt to
add a significant voice to deliber
ations at that level. Many stu
dents upon graduation move
right up the political ladder.
Some were already the leaders of
“Youth Wings” to political par
ties. It was through Makerere
students that I got on the inside
of political developments in their
territories.
Students are well aware of the
damaging effects of tribalism, and
a discussion of its place in the
university highlighted the school
newspaper for a couple of weeks.
When the local tribe, the Bagan
da. developed a strictly tribal
party based on loyalty to their
king, most other students dissoci
ated themselves from “such pro
vincialism.”
IT WAS interesting to be in on
the change of opinions, the loos
ening of stereotypes by students.
Enforced proximity, common in
terests—in sports and academia
broke down the previously blind
cultural barriers and students
learned to recognize each other as
individuals. One Uganda girl con
fided to me that before coming
to Makerere she thought mem
bers of her neighboring tribe
were literally “red devils.” Now
she counts members of that tribe
among her close friends.
Living at Makerere as a regu
lar student gives one the unique
opportunity to know students
from various tribes well, go with
them into their home districts,
learn from them. What about their
tribes they consider set them
apart from their contemporaries;
and to see, in this vertigo of
change which is Africa, the con
stantly shifting interaction be
tween their tribal heritages and
the ideas of nationalism and mod
ern development.
One of the salient problems of
“uhuru” (freedom) in East Afri
ca is tribalism. In Tanganyika
alone have the divisive effects of
tribalism been kept to a mini
mum.
In Uganda there is a sharp an
tagonism between the four agri
cultural, Bantu kingdoms (which
are solidly unified around their
kings) and the pastoral Nilotic
peoples for whom tribal senti
ments have been modified by a
desire for unity as a nation state.
To placate the autonomous de
sires of the kingdoms, Uganda,
made independent last October 9,
has been established as a semi
federal, semi-unitary state; the
kingdoms do retain some powers
which in other areas are adminis
tered by the central government.
IN KENYA the destructive as
pects of tribalism are at their
worst. The principal antagonism
stems from the distrust of the
numerically superior, politically
conscious Kikuyu from whose
depths sprang the Man Mau. The
less-developed, smaller tribes fear
that their welfare will be slighted
for the better-educated, larger
tribes.
