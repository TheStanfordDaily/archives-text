## U.S.S.R. Can Have No Interest In Leaving Bombers to Castro 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
While the Cuban question is far from being settled, it has
almost, (hough not entirely, ceased to be a major issue between the
Soviet Union and the United States. Having removed its strategic
missiles, which represented a very large military investment in
Cuba, the Soviet Union can have no interest in leaving the bombers
in Castro’s hands. These bombers*- —

are dangerous weapons in the
hands of an unstable character
like Castro. The bombers are
slow and old and vulnerable, and
though they could do much dam
age in a surprise raid if equip
ped with nuclear bombs, it is
most improbable that the Soviet
Union is entrusting nuclear
bombs to Castro. We must not
forget that the President has put
Mr. Khrushchev on public notice
that a nuclear strike from Cuba
will be treated as a nuclear strike
from the Soviet Union.
Theoretically, anything is pos
sible. But it is most improbable
that Mr. Khrushchev would dis
mantle the powerful Soviet mis
siles which were under Soviet
control, and leave Castro with a
few dozen obsolete bombers
equipped with nuclear bombs
which could initiate a thermonu
clear catastrophe.
On Cuba as a military base the
United States has prevailed, and
what remains is an issue between
Castro on the one hand and on the
other hand the United States, the
Latin American republics, and
the Soviet Union itself.

■ It appears that
I Mr. Mikoyan has
I had a hard and
I not very success-
If u 1 encounter
I with Castro in
I Havana. If so, he
I has not yet play
| his trump
I;a r d, which
I would be to tell
I Castro that if he

obstructs the complete fulfill
ment of the Khrushchev-Kennedy
agreement, the economic help
which Is indispensible to Cuba
will be cut down. Mr. Khrushchev
has done that to Red China.
There is no reason why he could
not or would not do it to Red
Cuba.
In any event, the objective is
the disarmament of offensive
weapons in Cuba. Even if the
Soviet Union does not compel
Cuba to give up the bombers, the
United States has the power, if
the power is used under a man
date from the Organization of
American States, to solve the
bomber problem.
IF POWER is needed to solve
it. it could be a blockade of oil
shipments. But a better solution
would be for the Organization of
American States to tell Castro
that the military neutralization
of Cuba is the price of a collec
tive guarantee against invasion
or blockade.
The sooner the Cuban problem
can be made into a problem of
the Western hemisphere, the bet
ter the prospects of making some
progress in East-West relations.
I realize that it is possible that
Mr. Khrushchev will make a sur
prise move somewhere to recoup
some of the prestige which he
lost in Cuba. But, at least for the
moment, this does not seem like
ly. Mr. Khrushchev, with Mr.
Kennedy’s help, has taken the
line that Cuba was not a defeat
but an example of statesmanship
to save the peace of the world.
For Mr. Khrushchev personal
ly, and for the Soviet Union in its
present position in the world, this
is the logical line to take. It
seems most likely to me that the
aftermath of the Cuban crisis will
be some important attempts to
work out a temporary accommo
dation with the West.
MY HOPE that this can hap
pen rests in the main on two ma
jor developments in the world
balance of power. One is the in
dubitable nuclear superiority of
the United States. The other is
the indubitably deep conflict be-

tween Russia and China. The
combined effect of these two fac
tors is to induce Moscow to avoid
a simultaneous mortal conflict
both in Asia and in the West.
The inducement to seek an ac
commodation in the West is
greatly reinforced by the enor
mous success of the mixed econ
omies of Western Europe. It is
now certain that the Communist
parties are not going to take over
Italy or France or any other
Western European state. It is
quite the other way around: the
East European Communist states
and the Soviet Union itself will
be greatly attracted and much
pressed to come to economic
terms with the great markets
and the great suppliers of the
West.
For the Soviet Union this is the
way to peace and prosperity and
it is only with peace and pros
perity that Mr. Khrushchev and
the present Russian regime can
hope to flourish. All the other
ways lead only to the increasing
ly insupportable costs of the
race in armaments and at the end
of it the catastrophic nightmare
of thermonuclear war.
AS CUBA is being liquidated
as a Soviet-American problem, it
seems likely that the nuclear
powers will get to, or at least get
much nearer to, an agreement, to
stop testing. As a matter of fact,
the United States has already
stopped testing and the Soviets
will stop next Tuesday.
The incentive to resume testing
in the near future is not very
strong. There is probably less and
less to be learned. On the other
hand, the incentive is strong to
reach an agreement in order to
stop or to slow down the spread
of nuclear weapons. We are all
afraid of nuclear weapons in
China, and no one really wants
to see them in Germany.
If a test ban is agreed to, there
is a very fair chance of some
progress in the reductions of ar
maments. The most promising
path here is to begin with the
reduction of what are called
“first-strike” weapons, missiles
and slow bombers which are good
only for a surprise attack. Be
cause they would be wiped out so
easily and so quickly, they are
provocative without being defen
sive. Both in the Soviet Union
and in the West, there are a lot of
such antiquated but provocative
weapons, and the world would he
a much safer place if they could
be eliminated.
THE WEAPONS which would
remain for a second strike after
a surprise attack would be the
Polaris, missiles in truly hard
ened sites, and certain kinds of
bombers which would somehow
survive a first strike. They are
defensive and deterrent against
surprise attacks. Thus there
would be no need to have total
disarmament which no country
would in fact accept.
All this rests on the supposi
tion that Berlin will be left to
simmer while these accommoda
tions are being attempted.
