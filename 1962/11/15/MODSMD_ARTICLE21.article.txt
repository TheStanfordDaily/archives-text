# HAMLET
## German Film Lacks Grandeur Of Passion 
### M. PERCINAL 
The German entry in the San
Francisco International Film Fes
tival was William Shakespeare’s
“Hamlet,” Before the world pre
miere Maximilian Schell, the
Hamlet, had these words to say:
“Theatre demands three things;
a script, an audience, and a per
former. At least we know that
the script of our play is good.”
That done, the latest production
of the 360-year-old drama began.
It illumined no new depths, but
it routed the belief, if belief there
was, that Hamlet is Shakespeare’s
drooping violet fragile, melan
choly, “chop fallen.” Schell’s
Prince was virile and nervously
exciting. His soliloquies were
spoken with manly feeling.

IN OTHER moments the brilli
ant mind facilely disposed of such
pairs as Claudius and Polonius,
Rosencrantz and Gulldenstern as
does lightning with an ill tree,
splitting it open and revealing the
diseased insides. Indeed, this
Hamlet, had he been set. to an
other task, would “have prov’d
most royally.”

Yet such was not the Dane’s
lot. and such was not Mr. Schell’s
ability to reach and explore the
further borders of a personality
whose potentiality is his down
fall. whose hatred is his love.
Hamlet might so prize life were
it not for Denmark’s “rotten”
state and his dread commission
“to set it right.” One could not
sense the noble struggle of Ham
let grappling with his most mor
tal enemy—himself.

That grandeur of passion was
absent from the film. For gravity
was substituted Germanic heavy
footedness. The "mighty oppo
sites,” Hamlet and Claudius,
waged a melodramatic cloak and
dagger affair. The scenes between
Ophelia and Hamlet were overly
sensual and did not search for
the key to mutual understanding
and sympathy.

PERHAPS the director, Franz
Peter Wirth, felt that since such
an attempt was not pursued by
Shakespeare, he may as well de
lete it entirely for an element
more theatrically attractive.
However, if Shakespeare posed
the problem, it ought to be pre
sented in any production. Ophe
lia’s “mad” scene evoked no pity.
Gertrude, performed by Wanda
Roth, alone approximated the
depth of her role. The viewer was
deeply moved to see this figure
thwarted in her attempts to serve
the two masters of her soul.
Finding it impossible to aban
don either one for the other, she
walked the middle ground. In |
other words, she divorced herself
from her society, upon which ac
tion tragedy inevitably follows.
This tragedy also had recognition
as Gertrude, in her final words
to Hamlet, chose to identify her
self with him and his cause, de
spite what had gone before, and
to die in his forgiveness.
POLONIUS is amusing in so
much as he is a rather bland
character who gets tripped up in
his function of court busybody
and chatterbox.
To superficially gloss him but,
in the end, to substantially de
tract from his character, the di
rector gives him an up-town,
monocle-like eye glass and has
him snatch the noted “neither a
borrower nor a lender be” speech
from some old tome and repeat
it boringly by rote to the glassy
eyed Laertes. Such treatment viti
ates any knowledge that Polonius
has gained from years as Lord
Chamberlain and an observer of
men and behavior.
One mismanagement of textual
intent was boldly evident. In the
final scene, Hamlet, upon dis
covering from the dying Gertrude
and Laertes the guilt of the King,
dashes to his revenge and in fren
zy wounds the King with the en
venomed rapier and forces him
to drink of the poisoned goblet,
his charge now carried out and
his death made meaningful to
Shakespeare’s audience. But here
the two combatants glower at
each other until it seems (the
camerawork is intentionally
faulty) that Claudius scrapes
himself with the rapier which
Hamlet holds in his hand and
freely drinks the potion.
OF COURSE, this is the sophis
ticated approach, but tampering
with the author’s objective in this
scene damages the climactic
structure of the play. Conse
quently the slipping of action and
life with the parting words be
tween Horatio and Hamlet, pro
vides the apt denoument as well
as a statement of Shakespeare’s
tragic vision at this junction in
his career’, but are lost on an un
prepared, unmotivated audience.
At least an hour’s worth of text
has been cut, and all for the bet
ter as the flowing language of
“Hamlet” does not fare well un
der the cacaphonous translation.
In summary, the audience was
politely receptive; the perform
ance of the title role was techni
cally varied and energetic but
fell short in finding a style which
could carry the character’s depth
and scope; the script proved best
and held untapped resources.
