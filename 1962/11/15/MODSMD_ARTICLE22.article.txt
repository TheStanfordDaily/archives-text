Assoc. Professor of English
Those who read the first issue
of KRINO last May will be eager
to see whether Raymond Frier’s
modestly printed journal has
lived up to its promise of becom
ing an organ of critical thought
to reckon with. They will discover
once more (hat KRINO provides
an outlet for a kind of reflective
writing that in recent years has
had no medium of its own among
campus publications.
This issue contains “Epigrams
and Essays” by William Alan Sal
isbury, a reinterpretation of "The
Poem of Job” by Professor Ed
win Good, a sonnet by undergrad
uate Robert Rosch, and the first
installment of a four-part essay
on “The Translucence of the Eth
ic of Authenticity” by graduate
student Jonathan Ketchum.
THE EDITOR’S preface de
fines the function of KRINO
(the title is the Greek for “I dis
tinguish” or “judge”). Criticism
“is by no means the opposite of
affirmation”: it is rather “the
hidden spring in the development
of human consciousness or self
consciousness—a hidden spring
which is in reality a type of af
firmation.” Hence its purpose is
constructive vis-a-vis the develop
ment of the criticizing subject.
For though it may involve anni
hilating the object under scru
tiny, its aim is wholeness of
meaning rather than the disjoint
edness that frets and disables
modern man.
With varying success, the con
tributions endeavor to present
“this via negativa to conscious
ness.” Like the speaker in Emily
Dickinson’s “I heard a fly buzz,”
the speaker in Mr. Rosch’s sonnet

disallows the assurances demand
ed by conventional postures in
confronting another’s death. With
a simple power worthy of Miss
Dickinson herself. Mr. Rosch con
cludes of the dying man’s strug
gle for the ultimate answer: “The
only resolution of his plea / Was
that he passed the question on to
me.”

Applying sound textual criti
cism, Professor Good finds in
“the poem of Job” not principal
ly an effort to fathom good and
evil. Rather it “is an investiga
tion of the degeneration of a
great man in order to apprehend
the character of true religion.”
Job is saved from the inadequate
theology through which he has
tried to make over God in his own
image only by the ironic voice
out of the whirlwind. Suddenly
God makes him see that his re
ligion has almst become (as it
does for multitudes who do not
“consider”) mere “manipulation
of the deity.”
EXCEPT FOR the penetrating
observations on music, Mr. Salis
bury’s reflections are a bit pon
derous; the epigrams especially
lack the Gallic salt that puts sa
vor into the aphorism. But the
essays plead land this is the im
portant thing* for wholeness,
rather than debilitating self-di
vision, in human cognitive and
moral acts.
Mr. Ketchum treats of refound
ing ethics on a “constitutive,”
rather than discriminative, basis.
If the reader has (he patience to
struggle through the disconcert
ingly opaque discussion of “trans
lucence,” he cannot but suspect
that when they appear, Sections
11-IV will merit close attention
(and serious criticism), if not as
sent.
But Mr. Ketchum threatens to
dazzle the reader, rather than to

radiate intellectual light lo him,
by a flashing display of word
lore. The merits of resolving con
ceptual terms to their roots are
obvious, but sometimes one feels
that the author has succumbed
to the besetting temptation of
“etymologists” (pace Isidore of
Seville), to juggle root elements
until they finally produce, not un
derstanding, but a combination
that matches the preconceptions
of the manipulator.

AT LEAST two other contribu
tors to those first issues of KRI
NO have likewise tended to dis
solve, rather than resolve, the
constituftve meanings of terms
by this kind of verbal atomizing.
Paradoxically, the magazine may
be in danger of extending the sort
of intellectual atomization and
scale-tipping against which, by its
very title and the emblem on the
cover that is its hallmark, it pro
fesses to stand forth.
Yet if it has a long journey to
come, KRINO is flinging down a
conscientious intellectual chal
lenge to the unexamined and the
disintegrative.

an outlet for a kind of reflective
writing that in recent years has
had no medium of its own among
campus publications.
This issue contains “Epigrams
and Essays” by William Alan Sal
isbury, a reinterpretation of "The
Poem of Job” by Professor Ed
win Good, a sonnet by undergrad
uate Robert Rosch, and the first
installment of a four-part essay
on “The Translucence of the Eth
ic of Authenticity” by graduate
student Jonathan Ketchum.
THE EDITOR’S preface de
fines the function of KRINO
(the title is the Greek for “I dis
tinguish” or “judge”). Criticism
“is by no means the opposite of
affirmation”: it is rather “the
hidden spring in the development
of human consciousness or self
consciousness—a hidden spring
which is in reality a type of af
firmation.” Hence its purpose is
constructive vis-a-vis the develop
ment of the criticizing subject.
For though it may involve anni
hilating the object under scru
tiny, its aim is wholeness of
meaning rather than the disjoint
edness that frets and disables
modern man.
With varying success, the con
tributions endeavor to present
“this via negativa to conscious
ness.” Like the speaker in Emily
Dickinson’s “I heard a fly buzz,”
the speaker in Mr. Rosch’s sonnet

disallows the assurances demand
ed by conventional postures in
confronting another’s death. With
a simple power worthy of Miss
Dickinson herself. Mr. Rosch con
cludes of the dying man’s strug
gle for the ultimate answer: “The
only resolution of his plea / Was
that he passed the question on to
me.”

Applying sound textual criti
cism, Professor Good finds in
“the poem of Job” not principal
ly an effort to fathom good and
evil. Rather it “is an investiga
tion of the degeneration of a
great man in order to apprehend
the character of true religion.”
Job is saved from the inadequate
theology through which he has
tried to make over God in his own
image only by the ironic voice
out of the whirlwind. Suddenly
God makes him see that his re
ligion has almst become (as it
does for multitudes who do not
“consider”) mere “manipulation
of the deity.”
EXCEPT FOR the penetrating
observations on music, Mr. Salis
bury’s reflections are a bit pon
derous; the epigrams especially
lack the Gallic salt that puts sa
vor into the aphorism. But the
essays plead land this is the im
portant thing* for wholeness,
rather than debilitating self-di
vision, in human cognitive and
moral acts.
Mr. Ketchum treats of refound
ing ethics on a “constitutive,”
rather than discriminative, basis.
If the reader has (he patience to
struggle through the disconcert
ingly opaque discussion of “trans
lucence,” he cannot but suspect
that when they appear, Sections
11-IV will merit close attention
(and serious criticism), if not as
sent.
But Mr. Ketchum threatens to
dazzle the reader, rather than to

radiate intellectual light lo him,
by a flashing display of word
lore. The merits of resolving con
ceptual terms to their roots are
obvious, but sometimes one feels
that the author has succumbed
to the besetting temptation of
“etymologists” (pace Isidore of
Seville), to juggle root elements
until they finally produce, not un
derstanding, but a combination
that matches the preconceptions
of the manipulator.

AT LEAST two other contribu
tors to those first issues of KRI
NO have likewise tended to dis
solve, rather than resolve, the
constituftve meanings of terms
by this kind of verbal atomizing.
Paradoxically, the magazine may
be in danger of extending the sort
of intellectual atomization and
scale-tipping against which, by its
very title and the emblem on the
cover that is its hallmark, it pro
fesses to stand forth.
Yet if it has a long journey to
come, KRINO is flinging down a
conscientious intellectual chal
lenge to the unexamined and the
disintegrative.

on “The Translucence of the Eth
ic of Authenticity” by graduate
student Jonathan Ketchum.
THE EDITOR’S preface de
fines the function of KRINO
(the title is the Greek for “I dis
tinguish” or “judge”). Criticism
“is by no means the opposite of
affirmation”: it is rather “the
hidden spring in the development
of human consciousness or self
consciousness—a hidden spring
which is in reality a type of af
firmation.” Hence its purpose is
constructive vis-a-vis the develop
ment of the criticizing subject.
For though it may involve anni
hilating the object under scru
tiny, its aim is wholeness of
meaning rather than the disjoint
edness that frets and disables
modern man.
With varying success, the con
tributions endeavor to present
“this via negativa to conscious
ness.” Like the speaker in Emily
Dickinson’s “I heard a fly buzz,”
the speaker in Mr. Rosch’s sonnet

disallows the assurances demand
ed by conventional postures in
confronting another’s death. With
a simple power worthy of Miss
Dickinson herself. Mr. Rosch con
cludes of the dying man’s strug
gle for the ultimate answer: “The
only resolution of his plea / Was
that he passed the question on to
me.”

Applying sound textual criti
cism, Professor Good finds in
“the poem of Job” not principal
ly an effort to fathom good and
evil. Rather it “is an investiga
tion of the degeneration of a
great man in order to apprehend
the character of true religion.”
Job is saved from the inadequate
theology through which he has
tried to make over God in his own
image only by the ironic voice
out of the whirlwind. Suddenly
God makes him see that his re
ligion has almst become (as it
does for multitudes who do not
“consider”) mere “manipulation
of the deity.”
EXCEPT FOR the penetrating
observations on music, Mr. Salis
bury’s reflections are a bit pon
derous; the epigrams especially
lack the Gallic salt that puts sa
vor into the aphorism. But the
essays plead land this is the im
portant thing* for wholeness,
rather than debilitating self-di
vision, in human cognitive and
moral acts.
Mr. Ketchum treats of refound
ing ethics on a “constitutive,”
rather than discriminative, basis.
If the reader has (he patience to
struggle through the disconcert
ingly opaque discussion of “trans
lucence,” he cannot but suspect
that when they appear, Sections
11-IV will merit close attention
(and serious criticism), if not as
sent.
But Mr. Ketchum threatens to
dazzle the reader, rather than to

radiate intellectual light lo him,
by a flashing display of word
lore. The merits of resolving con
ceptual terms to their roots are
obvious, but sometimes one feels
that the author has succumbed
to the besetting temptation of
“etymologists” (pace Isidore of
Seville), to juggle root elements
until they finally produce, not un
derstanding, but a combination
that matches the preconceptions
of the manipulator.

AT LEAST two other contribu
tors to those first issues of KRI
NO have likewise tended to dis
solve, rather than resolve, the
constituftve meanings of terms
by this kind of verbal atomizing.
Paradoxically, the magazine may
be in danger of extending the sort
of intellectual atomization and
scale-tipping against which, by its
very title and the emblem on the
cover that is its hallmark, it pro
fesses to stand forth.
Yet if it has a long journey to
come, KRINO is flinging down a
conscientious intellectual chal
lenge to the unexamined and the
disintegrative.
(Editor’s note: KRINO goes on
sale today for 35 cents.)

Assoc. Professor of English
Those who read the first issue
of KRINO last May will be eager
to see whether Raymond Frier’s
modestly printed journal has
lived up to its promise of becom
ing an organ of critical thought
to reckon with. They will discover
once more (hat KRINO provides
an outlet for a kind of reflective
writing that in recent years has
had no medium of its own among
campus publications.
This issue contains “Epigrams
and Essays” by William Alan Sal
isbury, a reinterpretation of "The
Poem of Job” by Professor Ed
win Good, a sonnet by undergrad
uate Robert Rosch, and the first
installment of a four-part essay
on “The Translucence of the Eth
