# More Decentralized Responsibility, Less Red Tape in New Constitution
## 
### JAMES WOOLSEY 
Besides significant changes in
the legislative, executive, and ju
dicial sections, the proposed
ASSU constitution provides for a
far less time-consuming and far
simpler manner of handling stu
dent groups. It will not be neces
sary, if the constitution is ap
proved hy the student body and
the President of the University,
for all groups to have complete
constitutions approved by Legis
lature before they may hold
meetings.
A process of registration (still
to bo worked out by by-laws) is
envisioned, which would protect
the University from the use of its
name for partisan political or
sectarian religious reasons, guar
antee observance of the Funda
mental Standard, and insure fiscal
soundness. The constitution does
not pre-suppose a liberalization
of the University’s policy on stu
dent groups, but it provides the
opportunity for more decentrali
zation of responsibility, less red
tape, and hopefully, a much-need
ed proliferation of small, infor
mal groups and societies of all
varieties such as one finds at
; many other campuses.
IN A SECOND change of this
nature, the responsibility of the
judicial councils is restricted to
enforcing ASSU regulations,
rules, by-laws, and. of course, the
Fundamental Standard. As under
the old constitution* LASSU re
mains the final arbiter of what
! lies within the Fundamental
Standard and what does not; al
i though it is assumed that, for all
i normal purposes, university regu-
I lations and state law arc included
! within the Standard’s framework,
this is not true of necessity.
If, for example, Legislature
should feel that a certain type
of action by a student or a stu
dent group was not to be a vi

olation of the Fundamental Stan
dard even though it violated
University policy (as it can and
has done), it could withdraw juris
diction in such matters from the
judicial council. This action
would not, it is felt, be at all a
common one, but it would serve
to clear up some of the fuzzy dis
tinctions which now exist and
would prevent student-adminis
tration conflict over such ques
tions as who can interpret the
Founding Grant.
To cite one example, last
spring after the student Forum
for the Discussion of Non violent
Alternatives to War was ap
proved by Legislature as being
an acceptable ‘non-partisan”
group, the group was prevented
from holding an open meeting on
campus because it was decided
by the administration that the
group was indeed “partisan.” The
hue and cry which ensued injured
both student-administration rela
tions and the prestige of student
government. Under the new con
stitution there is no assumption
that Legislature or the judicial
councils can interpret University
policy; the ASSU may enforce it
if it wishes, or it may withdraw,
but the ill-feeling which has
arisen in the past from conflict
with the administration and from
students' feelings that “the ad
ministration really runs student
government” will be a thing of
the past.
THE PRESENT document is a
product of months of compromise
and revision, according to pro
posals by many campus living
groups and organizations. Fur
ther revisions are still possible,
however, and some have already
been proposed. Amendments were
suggested after the constitution
went to press, for example, by
both IFC and Stern, outlining a
clearer delineation of the juris
diction of house judicial councils.
