# Struggling San Jose State Places Hopes on Carter-Johnson Tandem
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Don’t look now, but Stanford
has been cast in the favorite’s
role for Saturday’s football game.

Stanford is expected to dump low
ly San Jose State in the annual
Indian breather before Big Game.
The Spartans have struggled

I through a miserable season, hav
ing won only one game while los
ing seven and tying one. San Jose
I has been plagued by a very weak

I line and a constant rotation of
quarterbacks. Three signal callers
have directed the Spartan attack
this year, with Dave Bonillas,

Rand Carter and Bob Kane all
failing to make up for the loss by
graduation of last season’s top col
legiate passer Chon Gallegos. To
add to the problem, all five of San
Jose’s starting interior linemen of
last year graduated, along with
their top pass catcher, end Oscar
Donahue.
SAN JOSE has two weapons
which could prove dangerous. Car
ter’s passing, mostly to end Dave
Johnson, has resulted in several
touchdowns throughout the sea
son. Rand has rolled up 744 yards
through the air, 331 of these yards
accounted for by Johnson’s recep
tions. The Spartans also possess
break away threats in halfbacks
Walter Roberts and Jerry Colletto
and fullback Johnny Johnson.
Roberts, however, will be out of
Saturday’s contest with a broken
toe.
Speed and adequate passing
have been more than overshadow
ed by lack of team depth. This
was evident in SJS’s first game of
the year, when they fell to Utah
State by a 29-18 score. The only
bright spot for San Jose came on
a 57 yard pass play from Carter
to Johnson. Next the Spartans
were routed by Washington State,
falling 49-8. Continuing their los
ing ways, San Jose ran its record
to 0-4 with defeats to California
and Oregon.
FINALLY AVOIDING the loss
column, San Jose next tied a weak
Idaho team, 12-12. The Spartans,
led by Johnny Johnson’s running,
dominated (he game, but seven
fumbles ruined their chances. The
winless siege continued with
losses at the hands of Arizona
State, 44-8, and New Mexico, 25-13.
At last the battered and bent
Spartans broke the string and
nipped the University of the Pa
cific, 24-22, thanks to two more
long touchdown passes from Car
ter to Dave Johnson. It was back
to defeat last week, the San Jose
State team losing a 20-14 decision
to Fresno State.
San Jose’s only hope Saturday
seems to be the passing combina
tion of Carter to Dave Johnson
and the running of Johnny John
son and Colletto.
