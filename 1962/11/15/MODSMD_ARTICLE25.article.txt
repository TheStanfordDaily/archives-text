To most people Professor Leo Weinstein is known as a scholar
of French anti world literature. But to the players on Stanford’s
soccer team, and now to this writer, he is an equally avid scholar of
soccer as well as a skillful participant of the game. Every Tuesday
and Thursday when the alumni play the varsity, Professor Wein
stein Joins in with the same speed and adroit ball handling, except
for the effects of age, that he developed during his 30 years of
amateur play in Europe and America.
Since Weinstein came to America from Germany in 1938, he has
followed international and American soccer, which has not been as
unvital as most spoi l fans might think, as closely as a New Yorker
from the Bronx follows the Yankees. During this time Weinstein
recalls two outstanding American soccer feats. In the international
amateur-professional competition for the World Cup in 1930, the
American representative made it to the semi-finals, by far the best
showing up to that time for an American team.
But the “most glorious moment” came in 1950 World Cup games
in Brazil. That year the Americans beat the English, the people who
had invented soccer and who had consistently been producing the
best teams in the world. “I was in France at the time.” relates
Weinstein, “When I read the score (1-0) in a French newspaper, I
was sure it was a misprint. So I got an English paper, and when I
saw the black borders around the front page, I knew there was no
mistake.
“For the U.S. to beat England was unheard of. Every European !
fan was amazed but hardly an American even knew about it; in fact, |

there wasn’t even an ineh of cov
erage about it in any of the
American papers, not even in the
New York Times."
Soccer a Minor Sport in America
For anyone who has been ex
poser) to soccer, it is hard to un
derstand why this internationally
appreciated sport, which consis
tently draws a hundred thousand
per game in some places, has re
ceived so little attention in the
United States. For excitement
and drama, soccer is at least the
equal of any major sport here;
individual techniques such as ball
handling and faking are as finely
developed as dribbling and faking
in basketball; teamwork must hr*
as exactly coordinated as the co
operation of a second base-short
stop combination in baseball; tre
mendous stamina is required,
since well over half of the 65- by

IfO-yard field must be covered at all times by the 20 players (not
counting the two goalies).
Despite its low scoring, soccer has no scarcity of electrifying
plays; accurate passes kicked at a precise speed to a precise spot,
deceptive footwork used together with head and shoulder fakes,
“heading" the ball to block a shot or make a pass, and diving saves
by the goalie are all necessary for a winning effort along with the
actual scoring plays. With no time outs for rest or team huddles, the
full one hour and 28 minutes in consumed by a continuous flow
of such plays.
Safer than Baseball or Football
Soccer even eliminates one of the detriments of most of Ameri
ca’s major sports—serious injuries. In the 15 years Weinstein has
coached or watched collegiate soccer at Stanford, the most serious
injury has been a broken leg, and only one of these has occurred
in that time. Most soccer injuries are confined to the pulled muscle,
sprained or twisted ankle level of criticalness.
Nevertheless, with all its excitement, skills, and relative safety,
soccer has not achieved major status among American sports.
Weinstein sees two reasons for this, one psychological and one
financial. Soccer was introduced in America primarily by German
immigrants and has since been concentrated in areas where people
of German ancestry have settled, such as St. Louis. The anti-German
feelings which have grown out of the two world wars fought against
Germany have thus been attached to soccer as a stigma in many
areas.
Further, when soccer has expanded to other areas, it has grown
along ethnic group lines, as illustrated by the names of some of the
teams in San Francisco’s amateur leagues: Teutonia, Hakoah, Mexi
co AC, and El Salvador. Such teams are usually dominated by first-,
second-, or third-generation immigrants, who are more likely to
speak German. Spanish, or Italian on the field than English. It is
little wonder that few thoroughly Americanized youths are attracted
to such a foreign setting: thus skill and appreciation of the game
rarely develop except in the children of a few minority groups. With
the German stigma and the “old country” setting, then, soccer has

retained an image as a “foreign
ers’ ” sport.
Soccer has never climbed out of
the ethnic group level because its
immigrant supporters have never
had the money or influence to
promote it beyond the local level.

American promoters have never
supported soccer because with
its ten-month annual season, it
presents a competitive threat to
baseball and football.
ANOTHER REASON for soc
cer's non-acceptance in the U.S.
according to Weinstein, is the dis
comfort it creates in the Ameri
can spectator. By its nature as a
sport of continuous action, soccer
demands continuous concentra
tion and alertness in order to get
full appreciation of the game; a
goal should he seen not merely as
a well-placed shot past the goalie,
but as a sequence of passes,
fakes, and dribbles which bring
the ball up the field and set some
one up in good position to make
an effective shot.
While such a sequence of con
certed team effort does not al
ways lead to a goal due to a fine
play by the goalie or a defensive
back, nevertheless, on each drive
up field, there is the possibility
of a goal; thus the soccer specta
tor watches the pattern of each
drive, observing not only what
each player does with the ball
when he has it, but also what
other players are doing in order
to get in position to receive a
pass or take a shot. This intense
observation goes on 22 minutes
a quarter for four quarters.
However, in baseball and foot
ball. the spectator has a much
more relaxed time of it for he
can often anticipate what is going
to happen and then concentrate
only on the appropriate part of
the field. W T ith a runner at first
base in a close game, he knows
the batter will bunt, and concen
trates on the area around the
plate where the hall will be bunt- i
ed.
FURTHERMORE, time outs for
rest, huddles, or foul shooting, j
break the high pitch and excite- 1
ment generated by the action |
and offer the spectator a lull for ]
relaxation. Sometimes these I
lime outs come at a climax, when
a football team is on the verge of j
[ a touchdown or when a basket-1
iball team is making a dramatic
S comeback. “To a soccer fan, a |
! lime out at a time like this is!
like cutting a good movie in the j
| middle or abruptly stopping a 1
I love scene before its completion.!
“In the opposite way,” says j
Weinstein, “American sports fans i
j have reacted with discomfort to I
1 soccer. They enjoy the game for |
about twenty minutes but then!
their attention begins to lag; they
like the excitement but they can’t
take it for such a sustained time,
because they’re conditioned by!
American sports to expect a time j
out for momentary relaxation.” |
I, ATK L Y, however, soccer i
| seems to be overcoming obstacles j
in its path to popularity. The ex
pansion of intercollegiate compe
tition and an international profes-1
sional summer tournament which
has sky-rocketed from a substan
tial deficit to a profit in three
years, are indications of this
trend.
Soccer is an excellent game and
provides the United Slates an op
portunity to compete with other
countries in a sport which is
more truly international than any
other.
