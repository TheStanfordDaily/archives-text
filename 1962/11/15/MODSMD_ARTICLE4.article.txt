## 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
A panel of six graduate stu
dents argued the international
legal aspects of the recent Cuban
crisis yesterday afternoon in Tre
sidder Upper Lounge.
James Campbell and Charles
Heard defended the American
blockade, maintaining that the
U.S. followed Article 51 of the
United Nations Charter in defend
ing itself against Soviet aggres
sion. Cuban consuls Peter Salo
and Friedrich Plickert countered
that Article 51 only allows self
defense after “armed attack,” and
that the U.S. is bound by two ar
ticles of the OAS treaty to desist
from intervention in any Latin
American country.
Neutral consul K. Venkata Ra
man contended that the phrase
“armed attack” is an outmoded
World War II relic in this age of
global intrigue and nuclear mis
siles. USSR consul Thomas Cul
ver undermined the American
contention that the Cuban action
is justified by Monroe Doctrine
obligations to countries whom
Cuba has molested.
U.N. consul Steven Ferrand,
while not participating in the de
bate. clarified the Secretariat’s
position by explaining that U
Thant was invited to inspect the
Cuban situation by the three in
volved powers, but may have dif
ficulty getting a permanent Ob
server Corps without offending
someone by extending the sphere
of his office.
Culver said that the Cuban mis
siles were entirely under Russian
control, while Cuban consuls Salo
and Pickert maintained that there
is a joint Cuba-Soviet cooperation
in all phases of the Cuban mili
tary.
