### MARION SULLIVAN 
Registration for the Atlantic
Community Conference on Dec.
1, is from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at En
gineering Corner. Tomorrow is the
last day to register and pay the
$3 fee. The conference lias been
planned by HR to acquaint stu
dents with the idea of an inter
national community and the
leaders connected with it.
Scott Thompson, President of
the HR, has said this is the
“foremost opportunity anywhere
for students to see an idea devel
oping." It has “attracted wide at
tention in Washington.” he said.
THE CONFERENCE will be
limited to 100 students. It will
thus be possible for each partici
pant to take an active and per
sonal role. Each will be able to
speak with the important figures
attending, both at lunch and dur
ing the several receptions.
The conference deals with the
most important idea before us to
day, said Thompson. This is the
“future of America.”
The concept of an Atlantic
Community has been endorsed
by leaders in the U.S. and in Eu
rope. Among them are Ludwig
Erhard, Nelson Rockefeller, Wal
ter Lippmann, Christian Herter,
and Joseph Kraft.
The Declaration of Paris said
“We, the citizen delegates to the
Atlantic Convention of NATO na
tions are convinced that our sur
vival as free men, and the possi
bility of progress for all men, de
mand the creation of a true At
lantic Community within the next
decade."
AVERILL HAKRIMAN, Assis
tant Secretary of State, former
roving ambassador, Ambassador
to Russia and to Great Britain,
will deliver the keynote address
and present the Administration’s
position at the conference.
Harriman said, “In addition to
the keynote address you have in
vited me to deliver, I should be
glad to take part in one of the
afternoon seminars and am anxi
ous to meet as many of your stu
dents as possible throughout the
day. That is the part I enjoyed
the most on my last visit to Stan
ford.”
Another very important speak
er will be Germany’s pre-eminent
military expert, Baron Karl Von
Guttenberg. He is flying from
Germany for this one conference.
Hickman Price, Assistant Secre
tary of Commerce and engineer
of the Trade Expansion Bill, will
also be here.
HONORARY CHAIRMAN of
the ACC is Dr. Karl Brandt, who
was on Eisenhower’s Council of
Economic Advisors. He is very
intimately connected with the
economic aspects of the Commu
nity.
The idea of an Atlantic Com
munity was thought of before the
Second World War by Clarence
Streit who was spoken of as ideal
istic and visionary. Since the War,
the necessity for less limited
world trade has again brought
forth the idea of a broad commu
nity of nations.
