edged the challenged s) Tom ‘Gary Lepper’ Parker 1047 to 936
to win the position of head yell leader. Brad Freeman and Bill
Smiland won the two open seats on Men’s Council.
Gale Davidson and Sally Payton, the only candidates, were
elected to Women’s Council. Ap-+

proximately 2,200 students voted
in the two-day balloting.
Terry Taketa completely domi
nated the race for freshman class
president but was forced into a
run-off with Chris Kirby because
of the large eight-man field. Ta
keta received 339 votes while
Kirby led the rest of the pack j
with 96 tallies.
THE HACK for freshman class |

ly, while Dafri Morgan barely
missed getting into the run-off |
with 166 votes.

ture; Brad Efron (unopposed*,

neering; and Bud Wedin, Stern. 1
Blachsbart defeated Tom Cover I
while Wedin collected over one
fourth of the votes cast at Stern,
thus avoiding a run-off.
There will be four run-offs for
Legislature representative, in
cluding the second seat from
Stern. Contestants in the final
election next Tuesday and
V/ednesday will be Marcia Hilde- j

IN THE RACE for head yell I
leader the lead changed hands
several times, and Moir was not
assured of victory until the last
tally was announced. Both can
didates had promised to eliminate
“gross” yells if elected.
Smiland and Freeman ran far
ahead of the four other candi
dates for Men’s Council. Free-1
man received 913 votes, Smiland

garnered 819 votes, and the four
other candidates togther totaled
only 769 votes.
In next Tuesday’s final elec
tion the new ASSU constitution
will also be on the ballot. Legis
lature made a few minor changes
last night but the draft is essen
tially the same as that which ap
peared in the Daily Wednesday.
