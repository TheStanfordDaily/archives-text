# Pre-Reg Process To Start Monday
## 
### 
Students wishing to pre-regis
ter for Winter Quarter must con
sult their advisers Monday, Tues
day, or Wednesday, or they will
forfeit that privilege, according
to Harvey Hall, registrar.
Study cards of students other
than freshmen and undergradu
ate transfers need be signed only
once a year. “It is no longer ob
ligatory for' these students to see
their advisers more than once a
year, but it is hoped they will do
so more often,” Hall said.
Reasons for the change are to
develop students’ sense of per
sonal responsibility, to encourage
student-adviser consultation at
other times than pre-reg, to pro
mote long term academic plan
ning, and to reduce the time spent
in clerical work, according to
Hall.
All signing of class lists will
take place November 26-Decem
ber 3. Juniors, seniors and gradu
ates sign according to the follow
ing schedule:
E-K November 26 a.m.
L-R November 26 p.m.
S-Z November - 27 a.m.
A-D November 27 p.m.
Freshmen and sophomores may
sign at the time designated on
their study list cards or any time
thereafter.
