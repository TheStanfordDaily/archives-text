# Air of Peace Surrounds Mausoleum
## 
### MARION SULLIVAN 
One of the most stirring structures at Stan
ford is the Mausoleum. This granite building is
the burial place of the University founders, Sena
tor and Mrs. Stanford, and their son, Leland Stan
ford. Jr.
Near the building is the; crypt holding the
ashes of Mrs. Stanford's brother, Henry C. La
throp.
THE SECLUDED site is located at the end of
Campus Drive near the Museum. There is an air
of peace there which is emphasized by the lovely
old oak in front of the building. The tree is old and
dying, just as the knowledge and love of the spot
is waning for those who do not recognize it as a
parking spot.
The Mausoleum is protected by four marble
sphinxes and an ornamental row of columns.
Lovely bronze gates guard the entrance. The only
other ornamentation is the names of the three
people buried there. The three coffins were each
carved from a solid block of Italian marble.
EACH OF THE building’s huge granite blocks
were pre-cut in the East and shipped to California.
The smallest of the blocks weighs over a ton.
Building was begun in JBSiS.

Separated from the Mausoleum by a formal
garden is the “Angel of Grief’’ statue. It is a copy
of one designed for the Paris Rothschild family
by W. W. Story. Mrs. Stanford had this statue
carved from white Italian Carrara marble in 1901.
From the quarry the statue was shipped to
Genoa on a sailboat and from there it was taken
to New Orleans.
The SL’-foot carving weighs seven tons. Be
cause of its immensity it had to be pushed on
rollers the mile and a half from the New Orleans
docks to the railroad tracks.
THE WING TIPS were broken off as the angel
was being put on the railroad flatcar. Finally it
reached the campus after a journey which lasted
more than three months.
In the spring of 1901 as the statue was being
put in its position, someone described it as “a
noble figure cast in an utter abandonment of grief
upon a pedestal, with head bowed upon arm.
Feeling pervades every line from the relaxed arm
thrown over the front to the droop of the folded
wings.”
Five years later the $4,000 statue was shattered
by an earthquake. An exact copy was commis
sioned and now replaces the or iginal.
