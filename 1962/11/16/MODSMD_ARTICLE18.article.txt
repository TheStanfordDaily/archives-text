# Partisan Politics: Stanford's Name
## 
### 
In the two weeks before the November 6 elections, the Uni
versity’s name at least twice became involved in political issues,
and the University may have overlooked the strictures of the
Founding Grant that allegedly forbid the use of the University’s
name in partisan issues.
First, the Legislature passed a resolution urging the defeat of
Proposition 24 (Anti-subversive amendment), and, second, the
University distributed a series of postcards urging the passage of
Proposition 13 (further tax exemption for private universities).
Although the University has not sent a formal communication
to Legislature protesting their stand as “partisan,” President Ster
ling’s executive assistant, Frederic O. Glover, said publicly last
week that Legislature “pressed beyond the boundaries” in oppos
ing Proposition 24. Presumably, the University did not press be
yond the boundaries by advocating the adoption of Proposition
13, in Mr. Glover’s view.
II Mr. Glover’s statement, made extemporaneously rather than
formally, is not the University’s position toward Legislature’s
resolution, then all is well since the University is being consistent
in permitting themselves and the students to speak out collectively
on political issues.
But if the University were to disapprove of Legislature’s action,
the inconsistency would be blatant. Printed below is the text of
the message distributed by mail “To Alumni, Parents, and Friends
of Stanford.” Note the implied definition of “non-partisan” in the
sixth sentence:
“Private colleges and universities enroll one-third of all Cali
fornia's full-time, four-year students.
“Like Stanford, many private institutions plan further growth.
Their expansion will enhance the vigor and independence of all
higher education in California.
“You can support this growth by voting YES on Proposition 13
at the November 6 election.
“This nonpartisan proposition provides property tax exemption
on all land used exclusively for educational purposes by private
colleges and universities. It was approved by a 103-1 vote of the
Legislature and has the endorsement of both major political
parties, both gubernatorial candidates, and a host of state and
local organizations.
“Stanford already enjoys this exemption, thanks to a State con
stitutional provision adopted by the voters in 1900 and special
action by the State Legislature three years ago. Although it there
fore has no direct stake in Proposition 13, Stanford supports
passage of the measure as a means to foster continued growth of
private higher education in this state.”
J. E. Wallace Sterling, President
A “non-partisan” proposition is one approved by the state
legislature (albeit not unanimously), endorsed by both major
political parties, both gubernatorial candidates, and a host of state
and local organizations. By this definition Proposition 24 is also
“non-partisan” although the state legislature never voted upon it,
for the groups urging the defeat of Proposition 24 included: the
state chairmen of both political parties, both Governor Brown and
Mr. Nixon, a host of state and local organizations, and the state
attorney general as well.
In the light of these facts we can only hope that Mr. Glover’s
remarks of last week are not University policy of this week.
