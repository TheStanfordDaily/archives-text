# Comparative Tuitions
## 
### 
Stanford’s tuition for die academic year 1963-64 will be high
but still not so high as any of the eight Ivy League institutions.
Since Stanford shares much in common with these universities, it
it revealing to see that Stanford has not yet seen fit to reach and
surpass her Eastern counterparts in amount of tuition levied. A
glance at the statistics below will show that an education in Palo
Alto is inexpensive compared to four years in Hanover, Cam
bridge, or Providence.
1962-63 tuitions are;
U. of Penn $1630 Columbia $1585
Brown 1600 Dartmouth .... 1550
Cornell 1600 Yale 1550
Princeton 1600 Harvard 1520
These amounts correspond to Stanford’s present (1962-63)
tuition, which is $1260, but which will grow to $l4lO next year.
In the context of California state universities, of course, Stanford
does not fare so well, tuition at Berkeley being $143 for state
residents and $643 for non-residents.
