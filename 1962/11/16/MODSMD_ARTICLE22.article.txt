# AGAINST AGGRESSORS
## Gandhi Would Prefer Force To Humiliating Surrender'

The undeclared border “war” between India and China has posed
many an interesting problem to the political and military analyst.
But even the policy-makers are so overwhelmingly in the dark that
it is almost impossible to construct a comprehensive and meaningful
theory. Such a theory must be able to explain the motivation behind

the Chinese aggression, unpre--
paredness on the part of India’s
Government and to impose the
limits for the possible outcome,
simultaneously and consistently.
Its repercussions on the interna
tional power balance, in general,
and on South East Asian politics
in particular constitute a separ
ate and important subject. Simi
larly its effects on Indian foreign
policy are also of paramount im
portance.
It would be premature at this
stage to attach so much atten
tion to the downfall of Menon as
many influential Western ob
servers seem to do. There is no
doubt that many sanguine links
in the non-alignment policy of In
dia are shattered. It is a painful
realization, indeed.

But one should not be hasty in
predicting a break in the Indo-
Soviet relationship which Khru
shchev so carefully developed. In
dian policy-makers have learned
to ‘understand the Soviet difficul
ty.’ It would take a still larger
shock to accomplish this.
I am especially interested in the
philosophical issue which is usu
ally avoided. Now that India is
already involved in the war with
a firm stand arousing unprece
dented emotional upheaval in the
masses, a point of no return has
already been reached. Many jour
nalists think that this tension
spot in Himalaya is comparable
to other contemporary tension
spots—Cuba and Berlin or at any
rate Korea and Vietnam. I dis
agree with this theory which
states that a single war is fought
at different fronts.
I do not want to say that there
is no connection between the
forces that create tension in each
of these spots. But I for one do
not agree to consider it as a part
of the international crusade
against communism pure and
simple. Communism is no more
univocal than the so-called ‘free
world.’ At the same time, I am
not willing to interpret this
“war” as a simple feudal fight
for a certain land economically
worthless at that» piece of land.
A REALLY mysterious logic is
behind this Chinese ‘action.’ We
are aware of the basic belief of
the Chinese communists in
force. But any theory regarding
Chinese motivation is as convinc
ing as any other.
What makes this war different
from, say, a possible war around
Cuba? I think that the Crisis in
the Caribbean has a logic of its
own. The behavior of the U.S.,
Cuba and Soviet Russia is clearly
explainable and justifiable (given
the stakes and gains involved).
As far as Vietnam and Korea are
concerned there was no direct
confrontation of comparable pow
ers involved. Remarkably enough,
major powers are apparently
only indirectly involved in all of
these conflicts. A kind of ‘chess
rationality’ prevails in every case.
Of course, this is quite a delicate
and hence dangerous situation
given the nature of power bal
ance and "means” of war.
In case of Sino-Indian war
there is no rationality of any
kind. It all sounds irrational, con
fusing and (cruelly) funny. Other
issues afford a plausible solution,
at least on paper. The main fac
tors in each other issue are con
sistent with the power balance
and the nature of arms in the
sixties. This is not true about the
Sino-Indian war. All other poten
tial ‘showdowns’ will not be long
drawn. This war, barring a mira
cle, is going to result in a per
manent stalemate. In terms of

casualties, this war is not going
to be a "thrilling” one. It is most
likely to be a strenuous, heart
breaking and possibly “boring"
ordeal for India.
THOUGH one cannot assess the
Chinese motivation, it is relative
ly easier to explain why India
suddenly changed its earlier pos
ture. Admitting the errors of past
is not enough. Can there be con
vincing justification for India to
mobilize all its resources eco
nomic, military, diplomatic, and
sentimental—on a war footing?
First, one must see if there is any
alternative to the use of force.
Taking into account the stand of
both of the countries, it is impos
sible to prepare a formula which
can be even ‘theoretically’ accept
able to both of the countries. One
can see that there is some room
for maneuvering either in the
case of Cuba or Berlin. A solution
that is mutually acceptable (at
least theoretically) can be de
vised.
Of course, mere theoretical ac
ceptability is not sufficient to
avoid a showdown. When an is
sue becomes a matter of prestige
it becomes more difficult and
complicated for a diplomat to of
fer an honorable escape for his
opponent, a condition vitally ne
cessary for arty lasting attempt at
negotiations. In case of Sino-ln
dian war when all the atmosphere
is charged with emotions it is a
near impossibility.
That India must fight without
sparing any effort, despite the
awareness that the fight is not
going to l>e conclusive, is unavoid
able. But is it a fight for that
‘sacred soil’ or for ‘the prestige of
India’? 1 advocate, in my capacity
as a sane peace lover, the use of
force and grateful acceptance of
American military aid. But I can
not accept commonly advocated
reasons which, in essence, turn
this war into a medieval crusade.
I think that to fight for a piece
of land is not only ‘uneconomic’
but philosophically wrong. And
to fight for the sake of prestige
is a morally bankrupt motive. A
saner reason can be found easily.
One must be proud that India
was only reluctantly pushed into
this manslaughter business by
the reckless and irresponsible ac
tion by Communist China. Even
that could be tolerated to a cer
tain extent but violent actions
guided by violent and treacherous
philosophy based on lies and
wrong conception of human be
ings is unacceptable.
We are defending human be
ings and sanity and not the land
in and for itself. We can fight
with a non-sentimental rationale.
War with China and use of
force have become unchallenge
able propositions in a fortnight in
India. But still there is a ques
tion: how <o reconcile this with
Gandhi?
Gandhi believed in only one
weapon—non-violence. This looks
pretty ridiculous in the world
with missiles and bombs. But one
must not forget that Gandhi at
tached a qualitatively different
significance than did the medi
eval saints. Gandhi conceived non
violence to be a social dynamic
for a disarmed community. Earli
er, non violence was considered to
be a virtue (a rare one, at that)
to be monopolized by a few
prophets and saints. He wondered
why could it not be used on an
‘assembly line scale’? Used on an
assembly line scale, it can prove
to be effective. But its effective
ness requires a very high degree
of morale, courage, calmness and

firmness, absence of masochistic
submission among masses. To
fight an imperialist power ex
treme rigidity may not be neces
sary.
A fairly diluted use of this
weapon proved to be sufficiently
successful against Britons who
themselves had their own diffi
culties. But the kind of aggres
sion China has launched necessi
tates a strictly rigid adherence
to the conditions required for the
effectiveness of mass scale non
violent resistance. I need not say
that such conditions are not ob
tainable in India. This leaves only
one sane alternative for India and
that is: conventional resistance.
To be sure, Gandhi would have
preferred a brave and sane use of
force for a secular human cause
Ilian a cowardly, helpless and hu
miliating surrender to an aggres
sive, philosophy and wicked en
emy.
Wo should, however, remember
that Gandhi led the independence
struggle not for a sentimental
and nationalist cause. Ho used to
say (and meant it) that he is as
good friend of England as that of
India. He did not fight to liberate
‘his sacred motherland’ but he be
lieved in freedom deeply. Similar
ly. Indians should shed sentimen
tal causes and fight the aggres
sors to protect the reason and
freedom. I remember an old say-
I ing, “Land does not belong to
[ anybody, we belong to land.’’ If
I we do not get rid of sentimentali
' ty we cannot deserve the victory.
