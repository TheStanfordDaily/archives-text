# Central African University Multiracial

### RICHARD VAN HORN 
The University College of Rho
desia and Nyasaland must rank
as one of the most unusual uni
versities of the world. It is a mul
tiracial school of whites and Af
ricans in a country which has l
been rigidly segregated for the |
last three decades. It presupposes !
the equality of the African with 1
the European in a society which
adamantly denies this possibility.
Its own student community, re
flecting the tensions of the out
side community, is split into con
flicting racial groups. The Amer
ican student who studies there
cannot help being caught up in
the tide of the conflict.
The University College, located
in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia,
is just six years old, but in those
six years it has been a center of
controversy and conflict. As the
only public institution in South
ern Rhodesia which is truly mul
tiracial, it has been a focal point
for political issues. Government
propaganda for multiracialism
based on the university antago
nizes many Africans who do not
believe the government is sincere
in its efforts to achieve multira
cialism, and it angers the white j
conservatives who loathe the ;
thought of integration. Yet de-1
spite this adversity, the univer
sity has made remarkable gains !
in education.
THE CONTROVERSY centered
on the university highlights an-1
other concern: can multiracialism
work? The answer is “No” as it |
concerns the university under the I
present conditions, but it does not j
exclude the possibility of success j
in the whole society. The race re-1
lations within the university re
flect the tensions from without, i
and no student can divorce him
self from the fears, anxieties and j
politics of the community at j
large. Every action of the stu- j
dent body which involves racial j
themes is observed by the coun- (
try, and the students have come
to expect unfavorable reaction j
from the press.
Recently the Governor General |
of Mozambique, the Portuguese |
colony which borders Southern l
Rhodesia on the east, was invited ,
to visit the university. The Afri-1
can students declared they would j
demonstrate against him. A small
but powerful group of white con
servative students made it known I
that they would physically re- I
pulse this demonstration. Finally, i
in order to overcome an open i
racial battle on campus, a third j
group of students staged a dem
onstration to mock the other two 1
demonstrations. They carried |
around placards with such say- j
ings as “Repent, The End of the |
World Is Nigh,” and “We Want |
Alcoholic Referendum.” Their
antics helped draw the attention j
away from the original demon- j
strations, and they prevented an
ugly race fight. But the racial
cleavage was cut deeper.
NO STUDENT who is interest
ed in the activities of the univer
sity can cut himself off from the
racial conflict within the school,
and no one is more aware of this j
than a visiting American student. 1
The African students, who hear j
the American government talk j
about “Africa for the Africans”
and the joys of democracy, ex
pect the American student, to
sympathize with their cause. The
Southern Rhodesians think the
white American must side with
them by virtue of his while skin
and his western culture. The
American must be a diplomat in j
the true sense of the word. If he i
fails, he will make enemies, but |
if he succeeds, he can participate j
in the two conflicting societies, a
feat which almost no Rhodesian j
or African can yet do.
