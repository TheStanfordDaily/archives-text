Editor, The Daily:
I was very gratified to read
Mr. Glover’s remarks in Thurs
day’s Daily in reference to par
tisan politics on campus. In par
ticular the quotations from the
Founding Grant and from Mrs.
Stanford, both more fully quoted
than ever before, were enlighten
ing beyond measure. For I can
not see how any rational person
can read those two quotations
and come to any conclusion other
than that what is specifically pro
hibited is the official involvement
of the University apparatus in
political pressure.
Mr. Glover states that the ad
mnlstratlon policy is that the
students shall be prevented from
engaging in political activity on
campus (he specifically forbids
the use of the Stanford name but
seems to equate this with on
campus activity) but that the Uni
versity shall bo able to back other
measures like the recent Propo
sition 13. This is an exact and
complete reversal of the language
of the two quotes in question. By
their language they say nothing
about what the students may or
may not do on or off campus so
long as this does not represent
the action of the University ad
ministration. But what IS speci
fically forbidden is action such
as that taken in support of Prop
osition 13.
How can the administration
shackle the rising student inter
est in the name of a ban which
applies only to themselves and
not to the students, while they
are at the same time violating
that very provision?
Robert Siemer
Editor, The Daily:
A free society, especially in a
time of crisis, can only be main
tained against the inroads of ig
norance and narrowness by the
determination of some paid of so
ciety to insure a free and un
hampered exchange of ideas. The
university, as the summit of the
educational system and the intel
ligent clearing house of society
bears this responsibility.
Unfortunately the administra
tion and board of trustees at Stan
ford have set themselves a lesser
task. They view the university as
a producer of intelligent, well
rounded functionaries of society
in the fields of law, business,
medicine, education, etc., and
they would apparently leave the
protection of freedom in the so
ciety they are serving to other
forces, or other universities. Or,
as Fred Glover, the executive as
sistant to President Sterling
phrased it in yesterday’s Daily,
the “name of Stanford” is only
to be used by Stanford “to pro
tect its institutional interests and
discharge its educational obliga
tions.”
This attitude was best illustrat
ed last year by the administra
tion’s shabby treatment of the
students who formed the Forum
for the Discussion of Non- Violent
Alternatives to War.
Instead of guaranteeing the
light of this minority fringe
group to stimulate discussion on
a vital contemporary problem, the
administration contrived to deny
them this right, on the basis of
arguments that were indefensible
even in terms of the Founding
Grant, as the reader knows if ho
followed this controversy.
It was best illustrated this year
by the administration’s attitude
on Proposition 24. Proposition 24
was a direct assault on the prin
ciple of the free society. It was
• defeated by the active defense of
that principle by a great variety
of responsible civic and business
groups. Did the Stanford admin
istration pitch in on this noble
cause? On the contrary, they re
mained silent, and when the stu
dents, through Legislature, took

the initiative in voicing Stan
ford’s opposition to Proposition
24 a high official of the universi
ty stated publicly that they were
“going too far.” I don’t think
they were “going too far,” and I
don’t think that Stanford will be
a great university until its presi
dent and board of trustees are
willing to go a little further in
the defense of a free society.
Bill l allison
Editor, The Daily:
I realize that a good university
seeks to contribute not only to
the cultural development of its
student body, but also to the sur
rounding community. However,
the welfare of its students should
bo its primary concern. This does
not seem to be the case at Stan
ford. Too many students have
been turned away from afternoon
and evening lectures because of
an over crowded auditorium
crowded with people from Palo
Alto and their children. The “first
come, first served” basis for ad
mittance is not fair since class
schedules often do not permit
students to arrive early for these
events. But they would at least
like to feel that they have a fight
ing chance to get a seat! The
after-rally dance last Friday
night was so crowded with “Paly
High” students that it was almost
impossible to move. Often one
cannot bowl because the alleys
are being used by members of
the “community.”
I do not wish to deprive these
people of enjoying our facilities,
hut the students should have first
choice. It would not be difficult
to check attendance at the dances
and lectures by asking that stu
dent body or faculty identification
cards be shown at the door. This

procedure could also be used to
alleviate the overcrowded condi
tions in the Union recreational
facilities.

If there are adequate facilities
for both university members and
the community—fine! But if not,
the university members should
be admitted first.

Editor, The Daily:
I was very gratified to read
Mr. Glover’s remarks in Thurs
day’s Daily in reference to par
tisan politics on campus. In par
ticular the quotations from the
Founding Grant and from Mrs.
Stanford, both more fully quoted
than ever before, were enlighten
ing beyond measure. For I can
not see how any rational person
can read those two quotations
and come to any conclusion other
than that what is specifically pro
hibited is the official involvement
of the University apparatus in
political pressure.
Mr. Glover states that the ad
mnlstratlon policy is that the
students shall be prevented from
engaging in political activity on
campus (he specifically forbids
the use of the Stanford name but
seems to equate this with on
campus activity) but that the Uni
versity shall bo able to back other
measures like the recent Propo
sition 13. This is an exact and
complete reversal of the language
of the two quotes in question. By
their language they say nothing
about what the students may or
may not do on or off campus so
long as this does not represent
the action of the University ad
ministration. But what IS speci
fically forbidden is action such
as that taken in support of Prop
osition 13.
How can the administration
shackle the rising student inter
est in the name of a ban which
applies only to themselves and
not to the students, while they
are at the same time violating
that very provision?
Robert Siemer
Editor, The Daily:
A free society, especially in a
time of crisis, can only be main
tained against the inroads of ig
norance and narrowness by the
determination of some paid of so
ciety to insure a free and un
hampered exchange of ideas. The
university, as the summit of the
educational system and the intel
ligent clearing house of society
bears this responsibility.
Unfortunately the administra
tion and board of trustees at Stan
ford have set themselves a lesser
task. They view the university as
a producer of intelligent, well
rounded functionaries of society
in the fields of law, business,
medicine, education, etc., and
they would apparently leave the
protection of freedom in the so
ciety they are serving to other
forces, or other universities. Or,
as Fred Glover, the executive as
sistant to President Sterling
phrased it in yesterday’s Daily,
the “name of Stanford” is only
to be used by Stanford “to pro
tect its institutional interests and
discharge its educational obliga
tions.”
This attitude was best illustrat
ed last year by the administra
tion’s shabby treatment of the
students who formed the Forum
for the Discussion of Non- Violent
Alternatives to War.
Instead of guaranteeing the
light of this minority fringe
group to stimulate discussion on
a vital contemporary problem, the
administration contrived to deny
them this right, on the basis of
arguments that were indefensible
even in terms of the Founding
Grant, as the reader knows if ho
followed this controversy.
It was best illustrated this year
by the administration’s attitude
on Proposition 24. Proposition 24
was a direct assault on the prin
ciple of the free society. It was
• defeated by the active defense of
that principle by a great variety
of responsible civic and business
groups. Did the Stanford admin
istration pitch in on this noble
cause? On the contrary, they re
mained silent, and when the stu
dents, through Legislature, took

the initiative in voicing Stan
ford’s opposition to Proposition
24 a high official of the universi
ty stated publicly that they were
“going too far.” I don’t think
they were “going too far,” and I
don’t think that Stanford will be
a great university until its presi
dent and board of trustees are
willing to go a little further in
the defense of a free society.
Bill l allison
Editor, The Daily:
I realize that a good university
seeks to contribute not only to
the cultural development of its
student body, but also to the sur
rounding community. However,
the welfare of its students should
bo its primary concern. This does
not seem to be the case at Stan
ford. Too many students have
been turned away from afternoon
and evening lectures because of
an over crowded auditorium
crowded with people from Palo
Alto and their children. The “first
come, first served” basis for ad
mittance is not fair since class
schedules often do not permit
students to arrive early for these
events. But they would at least
like to feel that they have a fight
ing chance to get a seat! The
after-rally dance last Friday
night was so crowded with “Paly
High” students that it was almost
impossible to move. Often one
cannot bowl because the alleys
are being used by members of
the “community.”
I do not wish to deprive these
people of enjoying our facilities,
hut the students should have first
choice. It would not be difficult
to check attendance at the dances
and lectures by asking that stu
dent body or faculty identification
cards be shown at the door. This

procedure could also be used to
alleviate the overcrowded condi
tions in the Union recreational
facilities.

Mary Durbin
Editor, The Daily:
I was very gratified to read
Mr. Glover’s remarks in Thurs
day’s Daily in reference to par
tisan politics on campus. In par
ticular the quotations from the
Founding Grant and from Mrs.
Stanford, both more fully quoted
than ever before, were enlighten
ing beyond measure. For I can
not see how any rational person
can read those two quotations
and come to any conclusion other
than that what is specifically pro
hibited is the official involvement
of the University apparatus in
political pressure.
Mr. Glover states that the ad
mnlstratlon policy is that the
students shall be prevented from
engaging in political activity on
campus (he specifically forbids
the use of the Stanford name but
seems to equate this with on
campus activity) but that the Uni
versity shall bo able to back other
measures like the recent Propo
sition 13. This is an exact and
complete reversal of the language
of the two quotes in question. By
their language they say nothing
about what the students may or
may not do on or off campus so
long as this does not represent
the action of the University ad
ministration. But what IS speci
fically forbidden is action such
as that taken in support of Prop
osition 13.
How can the administration
shackle the rising student inter
est in the name of a ban which
applies only to themselves and
not to the students, while they
are at the same time violating
that very provision?
Robert Siemer
Editor, The Daily:
A free society, especially in a
time of crisis, can only be main
tained against the inroads of ig
norance and narrowness by the
determination of some paid of so
ciety to insure a free and un
hampered exchange of ideas. The
university, as the summit of the
educational system and the intel
ligent clearing house of society
bears this responsibility.
Unfortunately the administra
tion and board of trustees at Stan
ford have set themselves a lesser
task. They view the university as
a producer of intelligent, well
rounded functionaries of society
in the fields of law, business,
medicine, education, etc., and
they would apparently leave the
protection of freedom in the so
ciety they are serving to other
forces, or other universities. Or,
as Fred Glover, the executive as
sistant to President Sterling
phrased it in yesterday’s Daily,
the “name of Stanford” is only
to be used by Stanford “to pro
tect its institutional interests and
discharge its educational obliga
tions.”
This attitude was best illustrat
ed last year by the administra
tion’s shabby treatment of the
students who formed the Forum
for the Discussion of Non- Violent
Alternatives to War.
Instead of guaranteeing the
light of this minority fringe
group to stimulate discussion on
a vital contemporary problem, the
administration contrived to deny
them this right, on the basis of
arguments that were indefensible
even in terms of the Founding
Grant, as the reader knows if ho
followed this controversy.
It was best illustrated this year
by the administration’s attitude
on Proposition 24. Proposition 24
was a direct assault on the prin
ciple of the free society. It was
• defeated by the active defense of
that principle by a great variety
of responsible civic and business
groups. Did the Stanford admin
istration pitch in on this noble
cause? On the contrary, they re
mained silent, and when the stu
dents, through Legislature, took

the initiative in voicing Stan
ford’s opposition to Proposition
24 a high official of the universi
ty stated publicly that they were
“going too far.” I don’t think
they were “going too far,” and I
don’t think that Stanford will be
a great university until its presi
dent and board of trustees are
willing to go a little further in
the defense of a free society.
Bill l allison
Editor, The Daily:
I realize that a good university
seeks to contribute not only to
the cultural development of its
student body, but also to the sur
rounding community. However,
the welfare of its students should
bo its primary concern. This does
not seem to be the case at Stan
ford. Too many students have
been turned away from afternoon
and evening lectures because of
an over crowded auditorium
crowded with people from Palo
Alto and their children. The “first
come, first served” basis for ad
mittance is not fair since class
schedules often do not permit
students to arrive early for these
events. But they would at least
like to feel that they have a fight
ing chance to get a seat! The
after-rally dance last Friday
night was so crowded with “Paly
High” students that it was almost
impossible to move. Often one
cannot bowl because the alleys
are being used by members of
the “community.”
I do not wish to deprive these
people of enjoying our facilities,
hut the students should have first
choice. It would not be difficult
to check attendance at the dances
and lectures by asking that stu
dent body or faculty identification
cards be shown at the door. This

procedure could also be used to
alleviate the overcrowded condi
tions in the Union recreational
facilities.
