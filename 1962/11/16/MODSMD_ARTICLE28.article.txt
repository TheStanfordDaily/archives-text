# Stanford Booters Face St. Louis In Quest for NCAA Championship
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The Stanford soccer team goes
for broke tomorrow when they
tackle the St. Louis Billikens in
St. Louis. The game will be play
ed under the lights.
The Indians will robably face

as tough an opponent as they
have faced all year, as the mid
westerners have most of a team
returning that lost to the eventu
al NCAA champions, West Ches
ter State, by one goal in the
NCAA finals last year’.
The Billikens rely on a wide
open passing game and strong
defense.
Should Stanford win tomor
row’s game, they will advance to
the NCAA semi-final round to be

played on Thanksgiving Day.
Another win and the Tribe would
find itself in the final round one
week from tomorrow.
Stanford Coach Fred Priddle is
short of soccer players at the
moment, with an injury removing
goalie Kent Mueller from action.
Forward Larry Chukwudebe, the
man who got the winning goal
against USF, may not make the
trip because of personal reasons.
With Mueller out, Tom Paul
son is Priddle’s choice to start in
the goal. Paulson started the sea
son as regular goalie, but an in
jury removed him from the ros
ter. He is back now, at full play
ing strength.

Stanford is set at fullback if
Rich Lonergan’s foot rounds into
shape. He suffered a bad sprain
against USE, and only time will
tell if he is able to play his usual
strong game. Should he be in
capacitated, Kent Smith will open
with co-captain Sandy Pofahl as
starting fullbacks.
Even if Chukwudebe doesn’t
play, Stanford has a quintet of
capable forwards. A1 Nnoli was
All-NCISC, and Stu Rawlings and
Klas Bergman rated second team
mention. Wing Ed Clark was an
honorable mention choice. Don
Griffith, the fifth man, has put in
several goals for the Tribe this
year.

against USF, may not make the
trip because of personal reasons.
With Mueller out, Tom Paul
son is Priddle’s choice to start in
the goal. Paulson started the sea
son as regular goalie, but an in
jury removed him from the ros
ter. He is back now, at full play
ing strength.

Stanford is set at fullback if
Rich Lonergan’s foot rounds into
shape. He suffered a bad sprain
against USE, and only time will
tell if he is able to play his usual
strong game. Should he be in
capacitated, Kent Smith will open
with co-captain Sandy Pofahl as
starting fullbacks.
Even if Chukwudebe doesn’t
play, Stanford has a quintet of
capable forwards. A1 Nnoli was
All-NCISC, and Stu Rawlings and
Klas Bergman rated second team
mention. Wing Ed Clark was an
honorable mention choice. Don
Griffith, the fifth man, has put in
several goals for the Tribe this
year.
