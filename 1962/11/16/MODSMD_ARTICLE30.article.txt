# Inconsistent Card Gridders Favored Against Consistently Poor San Jose
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Stanford’s inconsistent Indians
should finally have an opportuni
ty to relax tomorrow when they
meet their w'eak sister from San
Jose. Game time is 1:30 in Stan-

ford Stadium.

The Cards, who have played
both exceptionally good and bad
games this season, take on a San
Jose team that has been consis
tently terrible. The Spartans rec
ord of one victory, seven defeats,
and one tie compares quite un
favorably with the Indians’ mark
of three wins and five losses, a
record which Includes upsets over
Michigan Stale and UCLA.
Despite this obvious indication
of Stanford’s superiority, Coach
Curtice is a little uneasy about
the game. “It would be quite a
way for them (San Jose) to end
the season if they could knock
us off,” he explained. "They’ll
really be up for this one,”
CURTICE ALSO mentioned the
possibility of some of the Stan
ford players looking past the San
Jose game to the Big Game next

week. To avoid 1 his, Curtice ran
the team through drills stressing
fundamentals all week. “We’ve
stressed nothing but the San Jose
game in practice all week, and
our kids should be ready for
them. They’ve put a lot of effort
and desire into preparation for
this one,’’ he stated.

The Spartans will center their
offense on the passing of junior
quarterback Rand Carter, an ac
curate tosser with a 55 per cent
completion average this season.
His primary targets have been
Dave Johnson. Greg Rocha, and
Charles Elder. Dave Bonillas, a
senior who has tossed for one
touchdown this year, backs up
Carter at quarterback.
San Jose will probably attempt
to upset Stanford with an on
slaught of passes, but the Spar
tans also have a fine running at
tack. Fullback Johnny Johnson
leads Ean Jose with a 495-yard
total on the ground, good for a
3.9 pards per carry average. Half
back Jerry Colletto is averaging
9.8 yards per carry, having pack
ed the ball only 1(5 times.
Judging from past perform
ances, San Jose’s major weakness
has been their defense. A porous
line and lack of depth in the sec
ondary have placed the Spartans
on the wrong end of several lop
sided scores. San Jose has been
especially weak on pass defense,
and this should give Stanford a
good chance to put the passing of
Steve Thurlow and Clark Weaver
on display.

STANFORD’S defense received
a tremendous lift when it was
learned that Ed Cummings, who

sustained a head injury against
the Trojans, will be able to play
against San Jose. Stanford’s mid
dle linebacker on defense, Cum
mings has been leading the squad
in tackles week after week.
San Jose will enter Saturday’s
game without the services of
their number one halfback Wal
ter Roberts. Roberts injured his
toe in practice. Stanford will field
only two fullbacks. Ken Babajian
and Cummings, as both Tony De
Kellis and Dan Conaway are out
with injuries. These are the only
injuries, however, so both teams
are at almost full strength.
The unpredictable Indians will
finally have a chance to conform
to the experts’ pick Saturday
against San Jose. Stanford is, and
well should be, the* favorite.
