# UC at Santa Cruz Eyes Multi-College
## 
### 
BERKELEY (UPD—The now
University of California campus
at Santa Cruz may be modeled
after the multi-college arrange
ment of Oxford and Cambridge,
the university’s board of regents
indicated yesterday. The board’s
committee on educational policies
gave provisional approval to
plans for ultimately building 27
small residential colleges with
individual enrollments ranging
from 350 to 1,000 students.
The committee thus indicated
its approval of a growing trend
toward setting up small colleges
with emphasis on the humanities
and social sciences, with closer
relationships between professor
and student.
The first institution to open on
the Santa Cruz campus would be
Cowell College, scheduled to be
gin classes in September, 1963.
Cowell will bo financed with $6
million from the state construc
tion bonds authorized by voters
Nov. 6. About $2 million in feder
al housing loans knd an $BOO,OOO
gift from the S. H. Cowell Foun
dation also will be available.
The land 2,000 acres of rolling
hills and redwood groves al
ready is owned by the university.
The individual colleges would be
separated by deep canyons and
creeks.
Dean E. McHenry, chancellor of
Santa Cruz campus, said science
will not be neglected at the school
but it will not become a techno
logical research center as the
university’s Berkeley campus
has.
