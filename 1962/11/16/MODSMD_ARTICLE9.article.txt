A BIG DISCARD PILE mounts as HR members sort out some 60,000
books headed for Asia at an abandoned school house in Mountain View. All books on music and religion and those printed
before 1944 (except English texts) are being put aside. The first
load leaves for Japan within two weeks. Vandals got into the
school several weeks ago and caused havoc for the HR by turning
over all the crates and breaking windows. From left: Nancy Rich,
Nancy Smith, Jim Haas (chairman, HR Books for Africa/Asia drive)
and Bill Reed.
