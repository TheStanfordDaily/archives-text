Applications for summer travel-study
programs to HAWAII, the ORIENT, and
SOUTH AMERICA are now being ac
cepted by Howard Tours of Oakland.
All three programs offer six units of
university credit for students wishing
a summer of fun combined with aca
demic credit.
Next summer's tour of 56 days to
Hawaii costs $589, plus $9 fax. This
price includes roundtrip jet between
the West Coast and Hawaii, campus
residence, and the most diversified
itinerary of dinners, parties, shows,
cruises, sightseeing events, beach ac
tivities, and cultural entertainment;
plus all necessary tour services.
Waikiki apartment living, steamship
passage, and visits to Neighbor Islands
are available at adjusted tour rates.
Steamship travel, however, will be at
a premium. Therefore, interested trav
elers should apply early to protect
their reservations.
1963 will be the "Big Summer in
Hawaii" because this is the biennial
year of the world famous Trans-Pacific
Yacht Race from Los Angeles to Ha
waii, with everybody sharing in the
extra fun and added excitement.
In addition to Hawaii, Howard
Tours offers a 67 day study program
to the Orient and another study tour

Both are San Francisco State College
summer session study tours. For free
