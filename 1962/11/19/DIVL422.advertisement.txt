Shakespeare never sold life
insurance as far as we know.
But we do know that the bard's
words could have been written
just for our business.
Delaying the start of your life
insurance program could be
costly. When you think you're
ready to purchase insurance,
you may not be insurable.
And the cost will never be as
low as it is today.
Our campus office specializes
in planning life insurance pro
grams for young men. Stop by
or telephone.
