# New Constitution Opportunity for Change
## 
### 
Believing that any change is for the better in student govern
ment’s structure and, moreover, believing that the proposed con
stitution is a sound change, we hope that the campus will vote
overwhelmingly in its favor tomorrow and Wednesday.
Anyone unfortunate enough to he present at the weekly meet
ings of Legislature recognizes the need for a change. Legislature
is unrepresentative and overburdened with trivia. It has exclusive
ness without functionality. The meetings of the Thursday Evening
Club are devoted to trivia (approving the constitutions and min
utes of the ski club) and meddling (in the affairs of the Institute
of International Relations, notably).

Under the new constitution, the Legislature will provide all
inclusive representation by living groups and will find itself di
vested of the trivial concerns that now occupy so much of its time.
Being a truly representative body, it will have the ability to speak
accurately for the student body on political issues or educational
policies. Instead of approving constitutions of small groups, Legis
lature could discuss and make recommendations for an enlarged
honors program or an improved General Studies curriculum. The
possibilities are limited only by the interests of the student body.
No longer would Legislature spend time on the ski club by
laws or on the by-laws of every student group wanting to organize
formally. And if a group comes into conflict with the Founding
Grant, the University and not the Legislature will have to say so
and will have to define explicitly their interpretation of the Grant.
The Legislature w ill not be put in the position of having to inter
pret the Founding Grant, and of, as a front for the University,
forcing the disbanding of an organization. If non-partisan groups
are to he defined as "partisan and therefore he denied the right
to hold open meetings, the University will have to play censor
and policeman; students will not have to censor themselves in the
name of Senator or Mrs. Stanford.

Of all the positive points in favor of the proposed constitution,
the most significant is the decentralization of authority. In the
constitution proposed and defeated last spring, the Inter-Fra
ternity Council appeared to be a subordinate body to the Legisla
ture. This fall’s proposed document makes it abundantly clear
that IFC is in no way a subsidiary of Legislature.
Another change from the constitution proposed last spring will
have far-reaching effects. The provision for proxy voting by repre
sentatives from the graduate schools has been abolished. A single
graduate representative could have controlled a block of twenty
votes under last spring’s proposal; this defect has been corrected.
In short, the flaws of last spring’s proposal have been elimi
nated, and if the constitution passes, a more orderly and more
functional structure will result. The proposed constitution will re
place an unrepresentative and useless Legislature with a repre
sentative body whose duties will no longer be confined to trivia
and censorship. The change would be welcome.
