An examination of Stanford’s tuition rates over the last twelve
years shows an increase of 113 per cent—from $660 in 1952 to
$l4lO for $1963-64. And although tuition income has risen this
much, it has become increasingly inadequate to pay the salaries
of Stanford instructors; the budget allocation for instruction has
multiplied nearly four times in twelve years. The upshot is that
whereas tuition more than covered cost of instruction in 1952,
today it covers only two-thirds of the faculty’s collective salary:
11.7 million dollars from tuition falls four million dollars short of
the amount allocated for instruction. It is for the purpose of
meeting this increased expense that the University has raised tu
ition again this year (even with the increase, tuition income will
not pay for the entire cost of faculty salaries).
This background information when tied with the vigorous
financial aid program vindicates the University’s decision to raise
tuition. As tuition has climbed 113 per cent since 1952, the total
amount of student aid has increased 1,200 per cent: from $500,000
to six million dollars. These figures compare to the total revenue
accruing from tuition: from 4,8 million dollars in 1952 to 11.7
million dollars in 1962.

Over the decade the University has had to raise tuition to
attract and retain a distinguished faculty, and in order not to
penalize the less wealthy thereby, the University has expanded
its financial aid program twelve-fold. The collective result of each
increase (in faculty salary rates, tuition and financial aid) has
been to improve the University’s education without excluding able
but needy students.
