## Is Stanford Worth $12,000 For Education by T.A.?' 
### STEPHEN MURATA 
By now you know that the administration has just announced
another rise in tuition for 1963-64. Last year it was a $6O jump in
room and board, the year before another increase in tuition of over
$2OO a year. Each year the cost of getting an education at Stan
ford goes up, and there seems to be no end in sight. It would seem

logical then, that every under--*
graduate, especially the freshmen
should ask, “Will it be worth it?
Will it be worth $12,000-15.000 and
four years of my life to come to
Stanford for my education, or
could my undergraduate years be
spent more profitably else
where?”
I am a senior and so it is too
late fo. me to change. But still I
ask myself the same question
from my different viewpoint. It
then becomes “Has Stanford been
worth it?” I wonder!
I A>l NOT so concerned with
the latest $l5O increase, which
pales into insignificance beside
the other costs. Nor is the issue
the validity of the reasoning by
which the administration ration
alizes further increases in cost.
Rather the question is whether
Stanford is living up to its repu
tation for giving a superior un
dergraduate education.
An analysis such as this can
turn to many problem areas, and
I choose in this article to dwell
on something everyone is famili
ar with, and what I term “Educa
tion by T.A.”
STANFORD HAS a ratio of
almost one graduate student to
every undergraduate. Stanford
also has a large number of huge
introductory survey courses—the
social sciences, humanities, math
ematics, and languages that al
most everyone must take.

T.A.’?” Who am I to ask? I am a
student who came to Stanford
seeking the best possible educa
tion. I need help. I need guidance.
If the University sends me to
someone who cannot give me that
help, that guidance, then he is
useless to me no mater how good
his background in the subject.

Unfortunately the departments
have sought to alleviate the en
rollment crush by using gradu
ates as readers, graders, and
teaching assistants or T.A.’s,
Even more unfortunately, it
seems that many of these people
have had little training in instruc
tion and possess even less of a
desire to teach.

You know the type. The math
T.A. who comes in to teach the
Math 10 section, who splashes
illegible formulae on the board
while mumbling into the same,
who is affronted by the question
which might prevent the comple
tion of the material which he
wanted to finish that day.
Or the organic chem lab as
sistants who occasionally wander
about the lab, but who can be
found most often in the stock
room. slinging the bull. Where
are they to demonstrate the pre
cautions in handling the danger
ous reagent or to put out the lab
fire you have just started?

OR HOW ABOUT the econom
ics T.A. who comes to section
without having done the problem
set which the students were re
quired to turn in. How else can
he answer questions other than
the way he does, right off the top
of his head? Exaggerated exam
ples? I only wish they were.
From the civ section to the
modern language class, you are
familiar with the teaching assist
ant. Unfortunately it has been my
observation that it will take an
average of about two years to get
past them in your major depart
ment. You will never be through
with them in the introductory
survey courses.
This is not to say that good
teaching assistants are not
around. In this, as in other criti
cisms, the conscientious T.A.’s
will get too little recognition. Yet
it is worth noting that in over
three years here I have had only
two graduate assistants whom I
considered good. Their quality of
teaching, however, should not be
the exception, hut the rule.
So I ask the question, “Is the

From the civ section to the
modern language class, you are
familiar with the teaching assist
ant. Unfortunately it has been my
observation that it will take an
average of about two years to get
past them in your major depart
ment. You will never be through
with them in the introductory
survey courses.
This is not to say that good
teaching assistants are not
around. In this, as in other criti
cisms, the conscientious T.A.’s
will get too little recognition. Yet
it is worth noting that in over
three years here I have had only
two graduate assistants whom I
considered good. Their quality of
teaching, however, should not be
the exception, hut the rule.

By now you know that the administration has just announced
another rise in tuition for 1963-64. Last year it was a $6O jump in
room and board, the year before another increase in tuition of over
$2OO a year. Each year the cost of getting an education at Stan
ford goes up, and there seems to be no end in sight. It would seem

logical then, that every under--*
graduate, especially the freshmen
should ask, “Will it be worth it?
Will it be worth $12,000-15.000 and
four years of my life to come to
Stanford for my education, or
could my undergraduate years be
spent more profitably else
where?”
I am a senior and so it is too
late fo. me to change. But still I
ask myself the same question
from my different viewpoint. It
then becomes “Has Stanford been
worth it?” I wonder!
I A>l NOT so concerned with
the latest $l5O increase, which
pales into insignificance beside
the other costs. Nor is the issue
the validity of the reasoning by
which the administration ration
alizes further increases in cost.
Rather the question is whether
Stanford is living up to its repu
tation for giving a superior un
dergraduate education.
An analysis such as this can
turn to many problem areas, and
I choose in this article to dwell
on something everyone is famili
ar with, and what I term “Educa
tion by T.A.”
STANFORD HAS a ratio of
almost one graduate student to
every undergraduate. Stanford
also has a large number of huge
introductory survey courses—the
social sciences, humanities, math
ematics, and languages that al
most everyone must take.

T.A.’?” Who am I to ask? I am a
student who came to Stanford
seeking the best possible educa
tion. I need help. I need guidance.
If the University sends me to
someone who cannot give me that
help, that guidance, then he is
useless to me no mater how good
his background in the subject.
