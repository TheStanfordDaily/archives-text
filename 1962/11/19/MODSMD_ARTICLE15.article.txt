# RECORD REVIEW
## Judy Collins Shows 'Promising' Talent 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
It is always gratifying to dis
cover a young folk singer on the
way to a wider reputation. Judy
Collins has already appeared in
such folk-music Meccas as Chi
cago’s Gate of Horn, but she has
made only one record. “A Maid of
Constant Sorrow” iEKL-209),
shows promise of better things
to come.
Miss Collins is a master of nar
rative song; she can perform the
whole of a long murder-ballad
like “Tim Evans” without losing
her audience’s attention. She
strikes an unbending pose, bor
dering on the almost masculine
severity of Joan of Arc.
One could hardly imagine her
bursting forth with spontaneous
joy or boisterous humor. But for
the kind of tragic dignity repre
sented by the title-song, “A Maid
of Constant Sorrow,” she is un
surpassed.
Miss Collin’s discriminate se
lection of songs is commendable.
She can take an old song like
“Hangman, slack up your rope”
and by a twist make it into
“Pricklie Pear,” a song with en
tirely altered significances.
Her “John Riley” is the beauti
ful, rarely-found version which
Joan Baez has transmuted into a
modern retelling of Ulysses’ re
turn to the faithful Penelope. And
Miss Collins’ powerful vibrato
stitches itself into the very seam
of Scotch and Irish songs such as
“Wild Mountain Thyme,” and
“Bold Fenian Men.”
Judy Collins’ inexperience is
evident in the rather overwrought
lone of the album. But that is the
only defect that mars the arrest
ing effect of this emerging virtu
oso.
