Editor, The Dully:
Certainly “the University must
be forever maintained upon a
strictly non-partisan and non-sec
tarian basis,” as the Founding
Grant states. In view of this I
cannot understand why Memorial
Church is on the campus. Though
it includes many denominations,
it is not, nor can it be, all-inclu
sive. If one grants it the right to
be here, then it follows that other
religious groups must have a sim
ilar right. Furthermore—and per
haps a more pressing issue— in
respect to the Founding Grant’s
stricture against both partisan
and sectarian activities, it fol
lows that if religion is not ban
ned, politics should not be banned.
