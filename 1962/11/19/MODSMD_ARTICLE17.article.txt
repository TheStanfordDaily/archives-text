Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday night, November 13,
llie residents of Stern Hall sat
down to dinner to find handbills
distributed by and in support of
Brad Freeman, a candidate for
Men’s Council. This distribution
is a violation of election rules
which state that no handbills are
to be distributed in dining halls.
Mr. Freeman was accompanied
and aided in distribution by Beau
Bianchi, a member of Men’s Coun
cil.
The violation was reported to
the Election Judgment Board,
which delayed a decision on it un
til after the election. When a de
cision was finally reached, the
committee chose to overlook the
violation.
A second violation of election
rules was made by Mr. Freeman
when he tore down an opponent’s
properly placed campaign post
ers. This infraction was made at
the request of Mi 1 . Bianchi, acting
as a member of Men’s Council.
We draw several conclusions
from the facts stated above:
First, Mr. Freeman has exer
cised very poor .judgment in both
of these incidents. As a candidate
running for election to Men’s
Council, it is his duty to make
himself aware of election rules
and to abide by them. In both of
these incidents he has failed to
do this.
Second, in failing to take action
on Mr. Freeman’s first violation,
the Election Judgment Board has
pointed out a need for clarifica
tion of election rules and their
enforcement.
Third, in requesting Mr. Free
man to tear down election post
ers, Mr. Bianchi has taken it upon
himself to exercise powers which
neither he, nor Men’s Council as
a whole, possesses.
We feel that these incidents re
flect unfavorably not only on the
individuals involved, but also on
Men’s Council and student gov
ernment as a whole. If student
government is to remain an active
force at Stanford, such incidents
as these must be avoided.

Editor, The Daily;
If the University administra
tion is bewildered by the continu
ing undercurrent of protest
among the student body and even
among numbers of the faculty
assuming that they have been
bothering 1o read the Daily—per
haps an explanation would help:
Not only at Stanford but also
at many other American univer
sities there seems to be a marked
increase in the percentage of stu
dents who 11 are interested in
knowledge and truth for their
own sake and not only for the
good jobs which a diploma can
ensure, and 2) are endowed with
a social awareness which will not
allow them to keep to themselves,
letting society continue on its
course without their influence.
Some of these students are “im
practically idealistic” like the
members of “Forum” while
others are “practically idealless”
like many a campus politician.
But all have in common an inter
est in the world around them, the
ability either to govern them
selves or to learn to do so, and
indeed a driving instinct to de
mand the right to govern their
own actions.
Now the University administra
tion has done a wonderful job of
attracting outstanding scholars to
the faculty here. Likewise the
rising entrance requirements
have forced upward the “quality”
of each entering class. Given the
combination of a socially aware
student body and a faculty well
able to stimulate their minds, we
have at Stanford a great univer
sity struggling to be born, to
burst forth with all the many ac
tivities which make a university
a living thing.
But when one analyzes the ad
ministration’s action and state
ments to determine what mental
picture they hold of the student
body for whom they are provid
ing this outstanding faculty and
these growing facilities, one can
only conclude (hat we, the student
body, are still thought of in terms
of the pre-war hard-drinking, an
ti-intellectual student stereotype
which we are told once roamed
these hallowed halls in search of
anything but knowledge.
Perhaps the faltering moves of
this Fall towards increasing con
| act between the student body and
the administration will make the
I latter realize that the “aware”
and “active” students do not need
and do not want to be protected
from themselves.
Granted that the administra
tion is safe in its exercise of ab-
I solute and often arbitrary power,
yet still they ought to realize the
I revolution which seethes beneath
i their feet and which no amount
. of “Let them eat cake” decrees
■ can squelch.
