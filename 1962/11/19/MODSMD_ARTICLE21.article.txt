# History of Gaieties Plagued by Criticism, Technical Problems

### MARGE HARDING 
“You could take a thousand
Stanford women and train them
for a thousand years and you still
couldn’t get a decent 20-girl line
out of them.” complained the dis
gruntled reviewer of the 1935 Big
Game Gaieties.
The first Big Game Show ap
peared after the second Cal-Stan
ford game in 1892, when Stan
ford rooters attended an after
noon show in San Francisco put
on by a professional company.
1895 SAW THE first “all-Stan
ford production,” jointly directed
by the Mandolin Club, the Band,
the Glee Club, and the Vaudeville
Club, and held in San Francisco.
The Daily of November 18,
1895, warned the student writers
of the show: “Let there be no at
tempt at coarseness or even a
suspicion of grossness or vulgar
ity, for the reputation of our col
lege depends upon the character
of the show.” This first show set
the traditional pattern for the Big
Game show: it made fun of facul
ty members, student organiza
tions, and Stanford traditions and
featured a farce entitled “Trilby,
the Coed, or Svengali's Forward
Pass.”

The show was termed "an un
qualified success,” and an at
tempt was made to present the
same kind of show the next year.
Troubles began to plague the
show, however. In 1895, a feud
between campus music organiza
tions was patched up just in time
to begin rehearsals. In 1896 the
show was recast because “there
was much objection to permitting
University women to act in San

] Francisco.”
AFTER 1896, there was no stu
dent Big Game show until 1905,
when the show was first pre
sented on campus at the old As
sembly Hall. These early shows
were plays with variety shows be
tween the acts. They withstood
the assaults of reviewers, who
like the one in 1935 quoted above,
remained anonymous.

Ram’s Head Productions took
over the annual show in 1925. An
exasperated reviewer suggested
that it would be better to “con
fine the chorus to a few simple
maneuvers. Balancing on one foot
and singing at the same time pre
sent too many difficulties.”

“Good clean fun” described the
third annual “Big Game Gaieties”
in 1928. The same sort of fun was
attempted in the 1935 Gaieties,
but relations between the Dean’s
office and Ram’s Head seemed
cooler in 1935. “The show is as
clean as a Boston edition of
“Ulysses,” a spokesman said,
“and was kept so by the same
process.”
THAT YEAR’S SHOW suffered
from lack of adequate rehearsals”
and was the last Gaieties given in
the old Assembly hall—the cor
nerstone for the new' Memorial
Auditorium had already been
placed. One Winstead Weaver,
better known in Stanford annals
as “Doodles” Weaver, stood alone

on the darkened stage and deliv
ered an eulogy in the form of
Puck’s speech, which reduced the
audience to tears.
The tradition of an all-Stanford
Big Game show has continued to
the present. The curtain rises to
morrow night on the 1962 ver
sion of Big Game Gaieties. Direc
tor Phil Ellis has promised that
it will be “the biggest and best
Gaieties yet,” and hopes that 1962
Stanford Students will give it the
same enthusiastic support that
the Big Game Show was given in
1892.

The tradition of an all-Stanford
Big Game show has continued to
the present. The curtain rises to
morrow night on the 1962 ver
sion of Big Game Gaieties. Direc
tor Phil Ellis has promised that
it will be “the biggest and best
Gaieties yet,” and hopes that 1962
Stanford Students will give it the

the Big Game Show was given in
1892.
“You could take a thousand
Stanford women and train them
for a thousand years and you still
couldn’t get a decent 20-girl line
out of them.” complained the dis
gruntled reviewer of the 1935 Big
Game Gaieties.
The first Big Game Show ap
peared after the second Cal-Stan
ford game in 1892, when Stan
ford rooters attended an after
noon show in San Francisco put
on by a professional company.
1895 SAW THE first “all-Stan
ford production,” jointly directed
by the Mandolin Club, the Band,
the Glee Club, and the Vaudeville
Club, and held in San Francisco.
The Daily of November 18,
1895, warned the student writers
of the show: “Let there be no at
tempt at coarseness or even a
suspicion of grossness or vulgar
ity, for the reputation of our col
lege depends upon the character
of the show.” This first show set
the traditional pattern for the Big
Game show: it made fun of facul
ty members, student organiza
tions, and Stanford traditions and
featured a farce entitled “Trilby,
the Coed, or Svengali's Forward
Pass.”

The show was termed "an un
qualified success,” and an at
tempt was made to present the
same kind of show the next year.
Troubles began to plague the
show, however. In 1895, a feud
between campus music organiza
tions was patched up just in time
to begin rehearsals. In 1896 the
show was recast because “there
was much objection to permitting
University women to act in San

] Francisco.”
AFTER 1896, there was no stu
dent Big Game show until 1905,
when the show was first pre
sented on campus at the old As
sembly Hall. These early shows
were plays with variety shows be
tween the acts. They withstood
the assaults of reviewers, who
like the one in 1935 quoted above,
remained anonymous.

Ram’s Head Productions took
over the annual show in 1925. An
exasperated reviewer suggested
that it would be better to “con
fine the chorus to a few simple
maneuvers. Balancing on one foot
and singing at the same time pre
sent too many difficulties.”

“Good clean fun” described the
third annual “Big Game Gaieties”
in 1928. The same sort of fun was
attempted in the 1935 Gaieties,
but relations between the Dean’s
office and Ram’s Head seemed
cooler in 1935. “The show is as
clean as a Boston edition of
“Ulysses,” a spokesman said,
“and was kept so by the same
process.”
THAT YEAR’S SHOW suffered
from lack of adequate rehearsals”
