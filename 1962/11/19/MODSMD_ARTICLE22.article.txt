## Facts Reveal Immorality and Incompetence in Cal's History 
### PAGE EDWARDS 
The University of California is
an evil school. Its founding pr in
ciples have been blackly aborted
from the beginning and have re
mained in their abortive state to
this very day.
The University of California
has similar possessions and goals
as Stanford—axe and tower-wise

hut from the southern vantage
point Cal's sinful, greedy and por
nographic existence becomes evil
to the point of contempt during
the week of Big Game.

STANFORD has a tower, Cal a
symbol hidden in a black cloud of
sin hanging over the campus on
Strawberry Crock.
Cal cheats for- the tin axe, wc
relinquish it morally as victors
over bad.

The only white spot in Cal’s
history rests in the mid-nine
teenth century when the trade
school (in those days) was found
ed by a Yale clergyman from
Massachusetts. Henry Durant.
Henry was, said the San Francis
co Chronicle, “a weak-voiced but
strong-willed man who came to
California ‘with college on the
brain’.”

BUT, AS IT may be expected,
even though the founder was
highly principled, the Berkeley
campus, in those days, was re
duced to a fandango dance hall.
Henry Durant was educating the
gold miners but not in Greek,
Latin and Mining Arts.
Clark Kerr, the present presi
dent of Cal, was described by
the Cal Pelican—a poor imitation
of Stanford’s humor magazine
in very bad terms. The hallowed
president was termed, “The man

who looks like a scholar is presi
dent of the university. He is a
liber al because “Time” said so. He
used to tattle on the university
to the State Committee on Com
munism and he got his just re
wards. He knows who pays the
bills, little children.” The ques
tionable humor in this statement
is not in point; the Cal Pelican
has shown disrespect for tire ad
ministration.

The Examiner on Nov. 22. 1951,
said objectively of the Cal root
ing section at the UCLA game,
“Huge signs raised at the UCLA
game contained the lowest of four
letter words.” And of the USC
game that season the Examiner
said, “there was a pornographic
picture seven feel long and three
feet wide, which cannot bo de
scribed for obvious reasons, with
references to USC on the bot
tom.” At that same game the Ex
aminer- reported that “vulgar gas
inflated objects floated over the
field for mothers, wives, daugh
ters, sisters to see ... it made
little difference.”

AND STILL, according to a
story in Time magazine, “350
white rats are born in the base
ment of the Life Sciences Build
ing every day.”
More, the celebrated professor
of political science and co-author
of “The Ugly American” and
"Fail-Safe,” Eugene Burdick,
wrote in an article for the New
York Times magazine read by
millions throughout the nation
that “18,000 gallons of graip al
cohol are consumed each year on
the campus—for laboratory pur
poses. And, last but not all, care
lessness and dishonesty are repre
sented by the fact that, as Bur
dick reports, 330,000 test tubes
are broken or stolen every year.
So we must hate Cal. We must
hold these documented facts over
the entire university’s head for
one week the week of Big Game.
Then we may all return to our
normal apathy toward the "com
munity of scholars” to the north.

the surrounding buildings.

The University of California is

The University of California

hut from the southern vantage

to the point of contempt during

STANFORD has a tower, Cal a
symbol hidden in a black cloud of
sin hanging over the campus on
Strawberry Crock.
Cal cheats for- the tin axe, wc
relinquish it morally as victors

The only white spot in Cal’s
history rests in the mid-nine
teenth century when the trade
school (in those days) was found
ed by a Yale clergyman from
Massachusetts. Henry Durant.
Henry was, said the San Francis
co Chronicle, “a weak-voiced but
strong-willed man who came to
California ‘with college on the
brain’.”

BUT, AS IT may be expected,
even though the founder was
highly principled, the Berkeley
campus, in those days, was re
duced to a fandango dance hall.
Henry Durant was educating the
gold miners but not in Greek,
Latin and Mining Arts.
Clark Kerr, the present presi
dent of Cal, was described by
the Cal Pelican—a poor imitation
of Stanford’s humor magazine
in very bad terms. The hallowed
president was termed, “The man

who looks like a scholar is presi
dent of the university. He is a
liber al because “Time” said so. He
used to tattle on the university
to the State Committee on Com
munism and he got his just re
wards. He knows who pays the
bills, little children.” The ques

is not in point; the Cal Pelican
has shown disrespect for tire ad
ministration.

The Examiner on Nov. 22. 1951,
said objectively of the Cal root

“Huge signs raised at the UCLA
game contained the lowest of four
letter words.” And of the USC
game that season the Examiner
said, “there was a pornographic
picture seven feel long and three
feet wide, which cannot bo de
scribed for obvious reasons, with
references to USC on the bot
tom.” At that same game the Ex
aminer- reported that “vulgar gas
inflated objects floated over the
field for mothers, wives, daugh

little difference.”
