# Surgeons Develop Artery Operation
## 
### 
A team of Medical School sur
geons, working at the Veterans
Administration Hospital in Palo
Alto, has successfully cleaned out
a completely blocked coronary
artery which crippled a 47-ycar
old man, William Davis, of Han
ford, Calif. The Stanford sur
geons used a new method in
which the heart is stopped and
repair is made without cutting
the coronary artery.
In the past, a high mortality
rate from an operation of this
type was often caused by the ne
cessity of cutting into the coro
nary artery. The team of sur
geons instead made an Incision
into the aorta, making the poten
tial complications less likely.
The team of surgeons, assisted
and directed by Dr. John Connol
ly and Dr. Frederic Eldridge,
both of whom are on the Medical
School and VA staffs, used a
heart-lung machine and kept Da
vis’ body temperature to 49 de
grees F. during the operation.
This operation was the first to
utilize a method of examining
and evaluating the severity and
the success of the operation by
X-ray techniques. An ink dye was
injected into Davis’ heart, and X
days were taken.
It is believed that Davis will be
able to lead a completely normal
life.
