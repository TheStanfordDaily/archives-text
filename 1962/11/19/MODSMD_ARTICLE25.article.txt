# USC Trojans Look for Roses; Washington Has Slight Chance
##

It’s “big game” week up and
down the West Coast this Satur
day with nothing much at stake
except tradition.

To all intents and purposes
Southern California has the Rose
Bowl bid wrapped up. The Tro
jans are unbeaten this year with
an 8-0 record and the next best
mark is a 6-1-2 performance post
ed by University of Washington.

Technically, USC still could
lose to UCLA and Notre Dame,
which would give the Trojans
two losses against one for Wash
ington, provided the Huskies beat
Washington Slate.

"We still have hope,” says
coach Jim Owens of Washington.

But the Huskies were beaten
14-0 by the Trojans earlier and
when it comes down to voting it
looks like coach Johnny McKay
and his boys are a shoo-in.
USC had a problem with fum
bles and other miscues Saturday
in turning back Navy, 13-6.

“It was one of our worst games
of the season,” said McKay. “But
you have to give Navy credit for
making us look bad, I guess.”

Willie Brown was the hero of
this game with a 56-yard run that
set up the insurance touchdown
in the third quarter.
Meanwhile, UCLA was getting
clobbered by Washington, 30-0.
Hucky sophomore fullback Jun
ior (Instant) Coffeey scored two

touchdowns and consistently
ripped the Bruin line.
“I don’t see how that club ever
lost to USC,” said UCLA coach
Bill Barnes. “I’m going to have a
look at the movies to see how it
was done.’’
California was ripped by Kan
sas, 33-21, hut went down swing
ing on the arm of sophomore
quarterback Craig Morton, who
completed 10 of 19 passes for 170
yards.
Morton again was lauded for
his great passing, this time by
Kansas coach Jack Mitchell.
“He’s the finest we’ve seen all
year,” said Mitchell.
Oregon State’s Terry Baker
ran and passed for 389 yards in
the Beaver win over Colorado
Slate, 25-14.
Oregon, walloped by Ohio
State, 26-7. had a rough afternoon
as the Buckeyes bottled up Mel
Renfro and capitalized on Web
foot errors.

It’s “big game” week up and
down the West Coast this Satur
day with nothing much at stake
except tradition.

To all intents and purposes

which would give the Trojans

Washington Slate.

"We still have hope,” says
