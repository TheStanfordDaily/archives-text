LOS ANGELES (LIPD —Bolt
ing Bill Kilmer scored twice to
pace the San Francisco Forty
Niners to a 24-17 victory Sunday
over the hapless Los Angeles
Rams.

The loss was the Rams’ ninth
in ten league games, the only vic
tory coming over San Francisco
when the two teams met the first
time this year three weeks ago,
But it was an entirely different
story for San Francisco Sunday.
Kilmer and his fellow offensive
backs primarily quarterback
John Brodie, halfback Jim John
son and fullback J. D. Smith—
ran almost at will over the Rams.

Kilmer amassed 101 yards on
the ground, while Smith picked
up 82 yards. Brodie completed 17
of 21 passes for 281 yards.
The score could have been as
lopsided as the statistics—if the
Forty-Niners had not lost the hall
on fumbles twice inside the Ram
five and had one field goal at
tempt blocked.
After Los Angeles took a brief
lead on Danny Villanueva’s 43-
yard field goal in the first, San
Francisco took command in the
second as Kilmer scored his first
touchdown on a three-yard pass
from Brodie. San Francisco wid
ened the gap with 10 points in the
third period, a 38-yard field goal
by Tommy Davis and Kilmer’s
second touchdown which came
on a three-yard off tackle push
to culminate a 71-yard drive.
Los Angeles was able to man
only one drive good for 91 yards

which came early in the fourth
period when veteran Zeke Brat

kowski took over for rookie Ron
Miller. End Jim Phillips took a
27-yard pass from Bratkowski
on the goal line for the Rams’
first touchdown in more than 11
quarters of play.
The Rams scored again with
less than two minutes of play
after recovering a Forty Niner
fumble on the San Francisco 12,
with the touchdown play a 10-
yard Bratkowski-to-Bass pass.
The Ram scoring ended a touch
down drought which had seen
them fail to cross the goal line in
the last two games.
San Francisco’s final touch
down came midway in the fourth
period on a 37-yard Brodie to
Johnson pass play.

Rams.

The loss was the Rams’ ninth
in ten league games, the only vic
tory coming over San Francisco
when the two teams met the first
time this year three weeks ago,
But it was an entirely different
story for San Francisco Sunday.
Kilmer and his fellow offensive
backs primarily quarterback
John Brodie, halfback Jim John
son and fullback J. D. Smith—
ran almost at will over the Rams.

Kilmer amassed 101 yards on
the ground, while Smith picked
up 82 yards. Brodie completed 17
of 21 passes for 281 yards.
The score could have been as
lopsided as the statistics—if the
Forty-Niners had not lost the hall
on fumbles twice inside the Ram
five and had one field goal at
tempt blocked.
After Los Angeles took a brief
lead on Danny Villanueva’s 43-
yard field goal in the first, San
Francisco took command in the
second as Kilmer scored his first
touchdown on a three-yard pass
from Brodie. San Francisco wid
ened the gap with 10 points in the
third period, a 38-yard field goal
by Tommy Davis and Kilmer’s
second touchdown which came
on a three-yard off tackle push
to culminate a 71-yard drive.
Los Angeles was able to man
only one drive good for 91 yards

which came early in the fourth
period when veteran Zeke Brat

kowski took over for rookie Ron
Miller. End Jim Phillips took a
27-yard pass from Bratkowski
on the goal line for the Rams’
first touchdown in more than 11
quarters of play.
The Rams scored again with
less than two minutes of play
after recovering a Forty Niner
fumble on the San Francisco 12,
with the touchdown play a 10-
yard Bratkowski-to-Bass pass.
The Ram scoring ended a touch
down drought which had seen
them fail to cross the goal line in
the last two games.
San Francisco’s final touch
down came midway in the fourth
period on a 37-yard Brodie to
Johnson pass play.
