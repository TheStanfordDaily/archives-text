# GIRLS IN PANIC OVER 'BIG GAME HUNT ON THIRD FLOOR
## Cal Invades Robleâ€”Barrel of Trouble for Campus Police 
### 
Shrill, hysterical screams and
shrieks from the third floor shat
tered the tranquil atmosphere of
Roble Hall after dinner last night.
In panic the police and press
were summoned.
And what was all the commo
tion about? A panty raid? No,
sir. The girls from 3-A and 3-B
had discovered swarms of mice
scurrying about the corridors.
Some of the little creatures
were painted blue and gold proof
that unimaginative Cal pranksters
had been in the farm. iCal men
pulled the same out moded color
ed-mice stunt in Roble before the
'6O Big Game.)
A flustered campus cop climbed
to the third floor, braving the hy
sterical multitude and the sacred
anti-man rules of the convent
dorm. He estimated that 200 mice

had entered Roble concealed in
two pairs of trousers with the
legs tied up evidence he discover
ed at the scene.
Robl e switchboard directors,
who see every man that comes
and goes - -were at a loss to ex
plain how the mice were smug
gled in.
After the flash of panic passed,
the bravest Roble women attempt-

Ed to capture the rodent-invaders
with shoe - boxes. Corridor 3-A.
which seemed to have fewer mice,
was using a wastebasket to keep
the tiny terrors. On 3-B the cap
tive mice were escaping from a
smallish cardboard box.
Stanford police now have the
captured mice in a barrel. Per
plexed officers have yet to figure
out what to do with them.
