# SJS Coach Titchenal Blames Rugged Indian Line, Leaky Spartan Secondary
## 
### DAVID A. NYBERG 
San Jose coach Bob Titchenal
gave credit for Stanford’s 21-9
victory to the passing of Clark
Weaver and Steve Thurlow.
“Your interior line,was gooci and
(Ed) Cummings made us give up
his side of the line, but the pass
ing hurt us most. Our pass de
fense wasn’t good either.’’
When asked to compare Stan
ford to Cal (who beat SJS 25-8),
Titchenal creased his brow and
said, “When wo played them we
saw mostly a running game. Now
they have a fine passer in
(Craig) Morton, and it’s hard to
tell how much better they’ll be.
The game will b close.”
QUARTERBACK Rand Cartel
admitted that, “I purposely
stayed away from Cummings,
he's probably the best linebacker
we’ve seen all season. During the

first half, I thought we would win
but those bad breaks late in the
second quarter hurt us and we
came back cold after halftime.”
Halfback Walt Roberts, leading
SJS ground-gainer with a 7.6
rushing average, thought that
Stanford has one of the better
lines he’s run against, singling
out Frank Patitucci and Ed Cum
mings as the roughest to get by.
“Stanford has a good chance
against Cal, but I’d say it’s going
to be a toss-up.”
STARTING TACKLE Larry
Hansen said only “that 77 and 78
(Chuck Hartwig and Chuck
Buehler) played a helluva ball
game. The line itself is big, and
strong, but not too quick. Cum
mings, though, is the best I’ve
seen. Cal has a good line, too, and
they’re faster. Boy, I’d like to see
that game next week.”
