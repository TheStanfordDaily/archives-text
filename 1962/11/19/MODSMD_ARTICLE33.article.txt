# Accurate Passing Leads Stanford Over Fast San Jose State, 21-9
## 
### MARSHALL LOOK 
Stanford managed to beat down
a stubborn San Jose team Satur
day and salvage a 21 ■ 9 victory,
aided by several key penalties and
fumbles by the Spartans, but they
did so in a very unconvincing
manner. In fact, the game began
to look like a well known quiz
program. At any moment, I ex
pected the public address an
nouncer to say “Will the real con
querors of Michigan State and
UCLA stand up please”? It was
hard to tell which team was
the heavy favorite and which the
one with u record of one win,
sven defeats, and one tie.
San Jose’s Jerry Colletto sped
for a 50 yard opening kickoff re
turn and raised a few eyebrows in
the process. After the first play
from scrimmage, when Jerry
Johnson powered over tackle for
15 yards to the Stanford 31, it be
gan to look like another long day
for the Tribe. However, the drive
was promptly halted, and the two
teams settled down to a scoreless
first quarter in which they took
turns fumbling and punting.
Early in the second quarter the
Indians drove deep into Spartan
territory, only to have Steve Thur
low’s pass intercepted by Johnson,
who played a tremendous game
on offense and defense.
Late in the second stanza, the
Spartans mounted a drive, led by
the fine running of reserve full
back Herb Engel, Sun Jose was
stopped on the Stanford three, but I
Bob Paterson kicked his first field j
goal of the year, giving the Spar
tans a 3-0 lead.
AT THIS POINT the Indians
finally got on the scoreboard on
a weird play. From his own 46,
Steve Thurlow faded back to pass.
The Spartans put a big rush on,
forcing Thurlow to retreat far be
hind the line of scrimmage. Final
ly Steve lofted a high floating
aerial that must have reminded
Giant fans of Stu Miller. Danny
Spence pulled it in on the goal
line and dove past his slipping de
fender for the touchdown. Thur
low added the two point conver
sion on a keeper, and Stanford
owned a slim 8-3 lead at the half.
Dick Ragsdale’s 33 yard return
of a San Jose punt with 5 min
utes gone in the third quarter set
up Stanford’s second tally. With
Clark Weaver directing play, the
Cards drove for the score from
the Spartan 30, the big play com
ing when pass interference was
called on San Jose’s Willie Wil
liams. This put the ball on the
Spartan eight, an d three plays
later Weaver carried it over for
his third score of the year. Clark
was unsuccessful in a 2 point con
version try.
RAND CARTER, San Jose’s
speedy and effective quarterback,
opened the final period with a 37
yard pass to Jerry Colletto, hut
the play was called back by a clip
ping penalty. The next time San
Jose gained possession of the ball,
Carter fired a 17 yard touchdown
pass to Walter Roberts, who, mo
ments before, had set up the
touchdown with a 56 yard gallop.
An unsuccessful attempt at the
two-point conversion left San
Jose behind by a 14-9 margin.
Stanford finally came out of
hiding and claimed the victory,
which everyone had assumed they
would waltz off with, on a 43 yard
march to a final touchdown.
Another pass interference call,
coupled with a great catch of a
Thurlow pass by Bob Howard, set
up the score. Thurlow tallied for
the Cards on a five-yard keeper.
Lindskog’s conversion hiked the
score to 21-9, where it stayed for
the remaining seven minutes of
play.
SAN .lOSK depended on great
speed to keep Stanford’s defense
scrambling all afternoon. Most
of their 8 pass completions came
on .Rand Carter roll out plays
where the swift sophomore would
outrun pursuing Indians and flip
passes to the flaring halfback
Roberts. Roberts also sparked the
running attack, netting 61 yards
and averaging 7.63 yards per
carry. For his fine play, Roberts
was voted the back of the game.
Johnny Johnson performed bril
liantly on defense for the Spar

tans.
The punting of Bob Paterson
must also he considered a factor
in San Jose’s fine showing. Pater
son averaged 45 yards per punt
for seven boots, and had one out
of danger kick travel 73 yards.
STANFORD was sparked by an
above par passing performance
by Steve Thurlow, whose 8 com
pletions in 15 attempts netted 164
yards for the Indians. J. D. Loda

to led the Card’s ground attack,
especially in the first half. How
ard and Frank Patitucci were re
sponsible for 6 of Stanford’s 10
pass receptions, the latter player
gaining recognition as lineman of
the game.
The defensive star was, as
usual, F.d Cummings, who made
19 tackles, more than three times
as many as anyone else on the
team.


FULLBACK JOHNNY JOHNSON, stalwart of the Spartan offense is
tackled by Guy Rounseville, defensive end. In pursuit are tackle
Al Hildebrand (75), and linebacker Kent Colberg. The Indians held
the swift runner to a total of 49 yards.
