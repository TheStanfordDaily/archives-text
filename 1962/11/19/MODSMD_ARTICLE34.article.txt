### GLENN ALFORD 
ST. LOUIS St. Louis’ scoring j
machine played the Stanford In
dians off their feet Saturday
night, and the Bills cake-walked
to a 9-3 win over the Cards.
Stanford played ( he highly
rated Billikens almost even over
the last 50 minutes, but couldn’t
overcome a five-zero St. Louis
lead that the home team grabbed
with only 10 minutes gone in the
second quarter.
A1 Nnoli, all ■ NCISC forward
played his best game of the year,
scoring two Stanford goals and
setting up Klas Bergman for the
third. Tom Paulson and Rich Lon
ergan also shone brightly for
Stanford, but they were unable
to overcome the individual bril
liance of St. Louis halfback Don
Ceresia, and forwards Gerry Ba
lassi, Tom Klein, Tom Mataya and
Tim Knox,
Halfback Ceresia, was the best
man on the field, blanketing Stan
ford’s high-scoring Stu Rawlings,
and breaking up many Card pass
patterns. Balassi, two-year all-
American, scored the first two Bill
goals, the ones that broke Stan
ford’s heart. Klein scored three
times and assisted two, while Ma
taya tallied twice, and Knox, a re
serve, scored twice and assisted a
third.
Nnoli got Stanford’s first goal,
with the Cards behind 5-0; after
dribbling into position, he set up

the second of the Indian scores
with a bullet shot off goalie Roger
Rupp’s hands that Larry Chuk
'wudebe rebounded in. Nnoli got
the third goal on somewhat of a
rarity. He blasted a direct free
kick between the heads of two
backs and through the goalies
hands for the final 9-3.
Bergman gave a brilliant dis
play of dribbling, starting many
Card offensives. Paulson was out
standing in the goal, despite giv
ing up nine scores, two men were
constantly clear and he had to
make a move, with his foes al

ways making the proper pass and
kick. Lonergan was the taackfield
bulwark.
Stanford concluded a highly
successful season, tying for the
championship of the NCISC. They
just walked into something they
didn’t expect, a team that was
good enough to administer the
only American defeat suffered by
the Hamburg Club of Germany.

with the Cards behind 5-0; after
dribbling into position, he set up

the second of the Indian scores
with a bullet shot off goalie Roger
Rupp’s hands that Larry Chuk
'wudebe rebounded in. Nnoli got
the third goal on somewhat of a
rarity. He blasted a direct free
kick between the heads of two
backs and through the goalies
hands for the final 9-3.
Bergman gave a brilliant dis
play of dribbling, starting many
Card offensives. Paulson was out
standing in the goal, despite giv
ing up nine scores, two men were
constantly clear and he had to
make a move, with his foes al

ways making the proper pass and
kick. Lonergan was the taackfield
bulwark.
Stanford concluded a highly
successful season, tying for the
championship of the NCISC. They
just walked into something they
didn’t expect, a team that was
good enough to administer the
only American defeat suffered by
the Hamburg Club of Germany.
ST. LOUIS St. Louis’ scoring j
machine played the Stanford In
dians off their feet Saturday
night, and the Bills cake-walked
to a 9-3 win over the Cards.
Stanford played ( he highly
rated Billikens almost even over
the last 50 minutes, but couldn’t
overcome a five-zero St. Louis
lead that the home team grabbed
with only 10 minutes gone in the
second quarter.
A1 Nnoli, all ■ NCISC forward
played his best game of the year,
scoring two Stanford goals and
setting up Klas Bergman for the
third. Tom Paulson and Rich Lon
ergan also shone brightly for
Stanford, but they were unable
to overcome the individual bril
liance of St. Louis halfback Don
Ceresia, and forwards Gerry Ba
lassi, Tom Klein, Tom Mataya and
Tim Knox,
Halfback Ceresia, was the best
man on the field, blanketing Stan
ford’s high-scoring Stu Rawlings,
and breaking up many Card pass
patterns. Balassi, two-year all-
American, scored the first two Bill
goals, the ones that broke Stan
ford’s heart. Klein scored three
times and assisted two, while Ma
taya tallied twice, and Knox, a re
serve, scored twice and assisted a
third.
