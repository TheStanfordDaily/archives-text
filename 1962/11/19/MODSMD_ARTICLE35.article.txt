# Curtice Lauds Speedy Spartan Backs, Stanford Morale, Secondary Defense
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Even though the Indians had
only beaten lowly San Jose State,
there was a distinctly cheery at
mospherc in their dressing room,
which hadn’t seen a win since
the Michigan Stale game, seven
weeks ago. ' Did you see the op
tion Thurlow that I ran?” kidded
end Frank Patitucci; he was re
ferring to a desperation lateral
quarterback Steve Thurlow made
in the fourth quarter; the play
lost five yards.
“I don’t know why they didn’t
throw to me more,” said 252
pound tackle Dick Lettwenburg,
"I have great hands.”
Meanwhile Frank Dubofsky and
Chuck Hart wig scanned the latest
copy of Playboy, while Ed Cum
mings, A1 Hildebrand, and Path
tucci carried on a highly intellec
tual conversation concerning the
relative merits of their girlfriends.
C OACH JACK CURTICE was
also happy. “Although the team
wasn't perfect. I’m always glad
to win one,” he said, “It’s hard
to get the team up before the Big
Game, but I thought they played
pretty well, especially on pass de
fense. San Jose hit well on one
pattern, but except for that, I
don’t think (hey completed one
pass.” He was referring to the
pattern on which the flanker ran
i deep and the light halfback, usual
ly Cass Jackson, ran down-and-out
below the flanker. The defensive
end or linebacker was supposed to
cover the short man, but he was
usually too shallow, and Jackson
caught passes for yards on that
pattern.
“San Jose has a bunch of hust
lers, who can really blister you,”
continued Curtice. “There was a
good example of what speed alone
will do for you in the fourth quar
ter. On a rollout pass by their
halfback (Walt Roberts), we had
all their receivers covered. But
! Roberts cut back and I thought
I he was going to go all the way;
| he left some of our best men with
I their hands stretched out empty.”

(Dick Ragsdale finally made the |
tackle after a gain of ,16 yards. )
ONE OF TIIK FLAYS that real-1
ly broke the Spartans was a 54
yard touchdown pass from Thur
low to Danny Spence with 1:18
left in the second quarter to make
(he score 6-3. It was the same
type of unfortunate long gainer
that has plagued Stanford so often
in the last two years, just when
time seems to be running out in
the first half. Thurlow said that
the play had been called to the
other side of the field. "All the
receivers were covered so I rolled
back to the other side and saw
Spence beyond his man and threw
it.”
According to Spence, “It was
kind of a fluke. I was running a
long diagonal pattern to draw
the safety out of position and

open up the center of the field for
the left end, (Bob Howard), who
was the primary receiver. But the
safety had seen Howard run that
pattern before, so he stayed with
him instead of me, and I was wide
open.” Actually, the left defensive
halfback came over and fell down
in trying to deflect the pass.
Spence caught the ball alone and
went into the end zone, for Stan
ford’s first touchdown pass this
year.

usually too shallow, and Jackson
caught passes for yards on that
pattern.
“San Jose has a bunch of hust
lers, who can really blister you,”
continued Curtice. “There was a
good example of what speed alone
will do for you in the fourth quar
ter. On a rollout pass by their
halfback (Walt Roberts), we had
all their receivers covered. But

ONE OF TIIK FLAYS that real-1
ly broke the Spartans was a 54
yard touchdown pass from Thur
low to Danny Spence with 1:18
left in the second quarter to make
(he score 6-3. It was the same
type of unfortunate long gainer
that has plagued Stanford so often
in the last two years, just when
time seems to be running out in
the first half. Thurlow said that
the play had been called to the
other side of the field. "All the
receivers were covered so I rolled
back to the other side and saw
Spence beyond his man and threw
it.”
According to Spence, “It was
kind of a fluke. I was running a
long diagonal pattern to draw
the safety out of position and

open up the center of the field for
the left end, (Bob Howard), who
was the primary receiver. But the
safety had seen Howard run that
pattern before, so he stayed with
him instead of me, and I was wide
open.” Actually, the left defensive
halfback came over and fell down
in trying to deflect the pass.
Spence caught the ball alone and
went into the end zone, for Stan
ford’s first touchdown pass this
year.
Even though the Indians had
only beaten lowly San Jose State,
there was a distinctly cheery at
mospherc in their dressing room,
which hadn’t seen a win since
the Michigan Stale game, seven
weeks ago. ' Did you see the op
tion Thurlow that I ran?” kidded
end Frank Patitucci; he was re
ferring to a desperation lateral
quarterback Steve Thurlow made
in the fourth quarter; the play
lost five yards.
“I don’t know why they didn’t
throw to me more,” said 252
pound tackle Dick Lettwenburg,
"I have great hands.”
Meanwhile Frank Dubofsky and
Chuck Hart wig scanned the latest
copy of Playboy, while Ed Cum
mings, A1 Hildebrand, and Path
tucci carried on a highly intellec
tual conversation concerning the
relative merits of their girlfriends.
C OACH JACK CURTICE was
also happy. “Although the team
wasn't perfect. I’m always glad
to win one,” he said, “It’s hard
to get the team up before the Big
Game, but I thought they played
pretty well, especially on pass de
fense. San Jose hit well on one
pattern, but except for that, I
don’t think (hey completed one
pass.” He was referring to the
pattern on which the flanker ran
i deep and the light halfback, usual
ly Cass Jackson, ran down-and-out
below the flanker. The defensive
