# Russell Stops the Stilt
## 
### 
The old champions, the Boston
I Celtics, danced their way past the
| San Francisco Warriors with the
1 defensive magic of Bill Russell.
I Russell dunked Wilt Chamberlain
in cold water which completely
turned off the Warrior's’ offense.
Tommy Heinsohn led the Bos
tonians with 2S points, while Torn
Sanders had 26 and Sam Jones
potted 25 in their 127-109 victory.
Big Bill held Wilt to 13 points
in the first hall and then let up
when the Celtics had tire contest
iced.
Warrior guard, Guy Rodgers,
added a spot of comic relief when
ho took a swing at Clyde Love!-
lotte (eight inches taller and GO
pounds heavier t and then allowed
himself to Ire chased off the court
and into the stands by 240 pound
Celtic Jim Luscutoff.
Russell looked like the same
man who befuddled the Stilt in
the championship playoff games
of last year. The former USF All-
American is the only man who is
able to continually block the 7’ 1”
260 pound scoring machine. Rus
sell is 6' 10” 215 pounds. It now
appears that Russell has the edge
in the greatest two player duel in
professional basket ball.
