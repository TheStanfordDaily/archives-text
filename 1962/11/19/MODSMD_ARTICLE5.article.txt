# Robinson Explains African Venture
## 
### NORMAN GREENBERG 
Dr. James Robinson, who
climbed from the slums of Knox
ville, Tennessee, to become a
world-renowned author, lecturer,
and social worker, presented his
philosophy and described his
work in an absorbing speech last
night at Solo Lounge. Robinson,
the grandson of a slave, is the
originator and director of “Oper
ation Crossroads Africa,” a pro
gram which sends students to
Africa each summer to live,
work, and study with Africans.

In his book. “The Emergent Af
ricans,” Robinson explains his
project; “The key words in the
crossroads experience are con
frontation. identification, under
standing, and working.” Every
man must be a credit to his reas
on for being, he said, for nobody
in this world exists without a di
vine purpose. Robinson empha
sized that one must fulfill his pur
pose on earth by making his oc
cupation a vocation, which is a
divine call for the best service of
humanity.

Man is motivated by many sub
tle forces which test the depth of
his life. Too many people con
form to the feelings of others.
And these “robot tendencies” are
responsible for most racial prob
lems, Robinson said.
U.S. treatment of African stu
dents, according to the “laissez
faire Americanization” philoso
phy is “bunk,” Robinson said.
We must consider the depth and
diversity of the loneliness of
these students. For “indifference
to human beings is worse than
hatred.”

Operations Crossroads presents
America’s best image to Africa
and, above all, improves the lives
of the participating students,
Robinson said.
The African Desk of HR will
have information and application
forms for those interested in the
project. Six Stanford students
will be selected as participants
in the program for the coming
year, Robinson said. The cost of
the summer program is $9OO.
