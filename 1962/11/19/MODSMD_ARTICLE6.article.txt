# Stanford Patrolmen Charged In Long Series of Burglaries
## 
### DANIEL SCHWARTZ Staff Editor 
One former and one present
patrolman of the Stanford Police
Department have been arrested
within the past five days by the
Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Of
fice and charged with burglaries
committed while walking on
their beats, the Sheriffs Office
revealed late Friday evening.

Hartley E. (Jacki Conrade, 45,
who had been dismissed from the
police force August 5 for “unoffi
cerlike conduct,” was taken into
custody last Wednesday, and re
leased the next day after posting
the $2lOO bail.
WESLEY J. LOCKLEAR, 32,
who walked the 8 p.m. to 4 a.m.
"Quad Beat” with Conrade before
his dismissal, was arrested Friday
night just before he was to go on
duty, and was released the next
day, also on $2lOO bail.

The arrests wore the product of
an 18 -month investigation con
ducted by the Sheriff’s office into
th e disappearance of “several
thousand dollars” worth of equip
ment from the offices and class
rooms on Quad, Sgt. Ray Howard
of the Sheriff’s Office told The
Daily.
Howard, who had conducted the
investigation with his partner,
Sgt. Walt Bettencourt, and Cap
tain William Salt, Head of the De
tective Division of the Sheriff's
Office, told The Daily Friday that
Conrade, who had been “suspected
for some time,” had been finally
apprehended through a cancelled
check for $75. payment for a tape
recorder which he had allegedly
stolen, and then sold.
A SEARCH of Conrade’s home
uncovered another recorder. Upon

questioning, Conrade admitted
stealing throe other tape record
ers, which he had also sold for $75
each. Howard said that Conrade
implicated Locklear in connection
with the thefts.

A sixth tape recorder was re
covered upon the arrest of Lock
lear Friday. Howard said.
The three sold tape recorders
were recovered from the pur
chasers, who all “just thought
they were getting a good bargain,”
Salt said. The recorders are val
ued “in excess of $2OO each,” he
added.
Both Locklear and Conrade
have admitted taking the record
ers.

SALT SAID that the investiga
tions were continuing and that
"there were probably more arrests
to come.”

Lieutenant John W. Gilkey, of
the Stanford Police Department,
said that he and Chief Gordon R.
Davis had been working closely
with the Sheriff's Office ever
since Conrade’s dismissal in Au
gust.
Gilkey told The Daily that the
investigations had not been term
inated because all of the stolen
equipment had not yet been re
covered. "No other member of
the present staff,” he said, “was
implicated.”
“There is no place on my force
for a crooked cop,” he said.
GILKEY said that Conrade, who
had been on the force since March,
1961, was dismissed because he
was suspected of taking part in
the burglaries.
He said that although there are
always a few losses, a large num
ber of things showed up missing
while Conrade was on the job.
“Either Conrade was doing a bad

job or taking it himself,” Gilkey
said. Conrade had not been ar
rested until now. he added, be
cause none of the stolon material
had been recovered.
Gilkey said that Locklear, who
had come just four months ago
from the University of California
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory
Security Police with “the highest
recommendations,” had probably
been pulled into tire burglaries by
Conrade.

GILKEY said that lie was “very
much surprised” when he learned
that Locklear had also been ar
rested.

Conrade, who said that his law
yer had told him to make no com
ments, told The Daily yesterday:
“Now they’re trying to involve me
in things that don't even exist.”
Locklear could not be reached.

Salt said Friday that police had
hoped that the story would not
break until the middle of this
week, when he hoped to be able
to finish the entire investigation,
but the discovery of the cancelled
check and the necessity to arrest
Locklear, “forced it all to roll fast
once it got started.”
HE EXPLAINED that Conrade
and Locklear had probably taken
the equipment while on their beat,
entering the rooms with a pass
key, and “hiding it in the bushes
until near the end of the shift
when they took it to their cars.”

Ho also explained that the Sher
iff’s Office was involved from the
start because all such cases are
referred automatically to their of
fice. The Stanford Police Depart
ment, he explained, was actually
a security police, paid by the
University. Stanford officers are
made special deputies by the Sher
iff’s Office after passing a six
month probation period. The Sher
iff’s Office is the actual policing
agency, he said.
Frederic O. Glover, Executive
Assistant to the President of the
Univei’sity, told The Daily yester
day that he didn’t know the facts,
and didn’t want to make any state
ment.

ALF E. BRAN DIN, Vice Presi
dent of Business Affairs, also de
clined to make a statement.
Chief Davis left for a confer
ence in Los Angeles early Friday
afternoon, and will not be back
until tomorrow, his wife told The
Daily. He cannot be reached, she
said.

“Now they’re trying to involve me

Locklear could not be reached.

Salt said Friday that police had
hoped that the story would not
break until the middle of this
week, when he hoped to be able
to finish the entire investigation,
but the discovery of the cancelled
check and the necessity to arrest
Locklear, “forced it all to roll fast
once it got started.”
HE EXPLAINED that Conrade
and Locklear had probably taken
the equipment while on their beat,
entering the rooms with a pass
key, and “hiding it in the bushes
until near the end of the shift
when they took it to their cars.”

Ho also explained that the Sher

start because all such cases are
referred automatically to their of

a security police, paid by the
University. Stanford officers are
made special deputies by the Sher

HARTLEY E. (JACK) CONRADE
Former Stanford Policeman


WESLEY J. LOCKLEAR
University Patrolman
One former and one present
patrolman of the Stanford Police
Department have been arrested
within the past five days by the
Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Of
fice and charged with burglaries
committed while walking on
their beats, the Sheriffs Office
revealed late Friday evening.

Hartley E. (Jacki Conrade, 45,
who had been dismissed from the
police force August 5 for “unoffi
cerlike conduct,” was taken into
custody last Wednesday, and re
leased the next day after posting
the $2lOO bail.
WESLEY J. LOCKLEAR, 32,
who walked the 8 p.m. to 4 a.m.
"Quad Beat” with Conrade before
his dismissal, was arrested Friday
night just before he was to go on
duty, and was released the next
day, also on $2lOO bail.

The arrests wore the product of
an 18 -month investigation con
ducted by the Sheriff’s office into
th e disappearance of “several
thousand dollars” worth of equip
ment from the offices and class
rooms on Quad, Sgt. Ray Howard
of the Sheriff’s Office told The
Daily.
Howard, who had conducted the
investigation with his partner,
Sgt. Walt Bettencourt, and Cap
tain William Salt, Head of the De
tective Division of the Sheriff's
Office, told The Daily Friday that
Conrade, who had been “suspected
for some time,” had been finally
apprehended through a cancelled
check for $75. payment for a tape
recorder which he had allegedly
stolen, and then sold.
A SEARCH of Conrade’s home
uncovered another recorder. Upon

questioning, Conrade admitted
stealing throe other tape record
ers, which he had also sold for $75
each. Howard said that Conrade
implicated Locklear in connection
with the thefts.

A sixth tape recorder was re
covered upon the arrest of Lock
lear Friday. Howard said.
The three sold tape recorders
were recovered from the pur
chasers, who all “just thought
they were getting a good bargain,”
Salt said. The recorders are val
ued “in excess of $2OO each,” he
added.
Both Locklear and Conrade
have admitted taking the record
ers.

SALT SAID that the investiga
tions were continuing and that
"there were probably more arrests
to come.”

Lieutenant John W. Gilkey, of
the Stanford Police Department,
said that he and Chief Gordon R.
Davis had been working closely
with the Sheriff's Office ever
since Conrade’s dismissal in Au
gust.
Gilkey told The Daily that the
investigations had not been term
inated because all of the stolen
equipment had not yet been re
covered. "No other member of
the present staff,” he said, “was
implicated.”
“There is no place on my force
for a crooked cop,” he said.
GILKEY said that Conrade, who
had been on the force since March,
1961, was dismissed because he
was suspected of taking part in
the burglaries.
He said that although there are
always a few losses, a large num
ber of things showed up missing
while Conrade was on the job.
“Either Conrade was doing a bad

job or taking it himself,” Gilkey
said. Conrade had not been ar
rested until now. he added, be
cause none of the stolon material
had been recovered.
Gilkey said that Locklear, who
had come just four months ago
from the University of California
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory
Security Police with “the highest
recommendations,” had probably
been pulled into tire burglaries by
Conrade.

GILKEY said that lie was “very
much surprised” when he learned
that Locklear had also been ar
rested.

Conrade, who said that his law
yer had told him to make no com
ments, told The Daily yesterday:
“Now they’re trying to involve me
in things that don't even exist.”
Locklear could not be reached.

ued “in excess of $2OO each,” he
added.
Both Locklear and Conrade
have admitted taking the record
ers.

SALT SAID that the investiga
tions were continuing and that
"there were probably more arrests
to come.”

Lieutenant John W. Gilkey, of
the Stanford Police Department,
said that he and Chief Gordon R.
Davis had been working closely
with the Sheriff's Office ever
since Conrade’s dismissal in Au
gust.
Gilkey told The Daily that the
investigations had not been term
inated because all of the stolen
equipment had not yet been re
covered. "No other member of
the present staff,” he said, “was
implicated.”
“There is no place on my force
for a crooked cop,” he said.
GILKEY said that Conrade, who
had been on the force since March,
1961, was dismissed because he
was suspected of taking part in
the burglaries.
He said that although there are
always a few losses, a large num
ber of things showed up missing
while Conrade was on the job.
“Either Conrade was doing a bad

job or taking it himself,” Gilkey
said. Conrade had not been ar
rested until now. he added, be
cause none of the stolon material
had been recovered.
Gilkey said that Locklear, who
had come just four months ago
from the University of California
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory
Security Police with “the highest
recommendations,” had probably
been pulled into tire burglaries by
Conrade.

GILKEY said that lie was “very
much surprised” when he learned
that Locklear had also been ar
rested.

Conrade, who said that his law
yer had told him to make no com
ments, told The Daily yesterday:
“Now they’re trying to involve me
in things that don't even exist.”
Locklear could not be reached.

Salt said Friday that police had
hoped that the story would not
break until the middle of this
week, when he hoped to be able
to finish the entire investigation,
but the discovery of the cancelled
check and the necessity to arrest
Locklear, “forced it all to roll fast
once it got started.”
HE EXPLAINED that Conrade
and Locklear had probably taken
the equipment while on their beat,
entering the rooms with a pass
key, and “hiding it in the bushes
until near the end of the shift
when they took it to their cars.”

Ho also explained that the Sher
iff’s Office was involved from the
start because all such cases are
referred automatically to their of
fice. The Stanford Police Depart
ment, he explained, was actually
a security police, paid by the
University. Stanford officers are
made special deputies by the Sher
iff’s Office after passing a six
month probation period. The Sher
iff’s Office is the actual policing
agency, he said.
Frederic O. Glover, Executive
Assistant to the President of the
Univei’sity, told The Daily yester
day that he didn’t know the facts,
and didn’t want to make any state
ment.

ALF E. BRAN DIN, Vice Presi

Chief Davis left for a confer

afternoon, and will not be back
until tomorrow, his wife told The

said.

recorder which he had allegedly
stolen, and then sold.
A SEARCH of Conrade’s home
