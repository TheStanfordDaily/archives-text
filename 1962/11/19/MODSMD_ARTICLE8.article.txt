Variety is the keynote of the
j First Annual Student Art Show
which opened Saturday in Tresid
| der Memorial Union. There is
i variety in .subject, media, and also
j the interests of the students who
| entered the exhibit.
Though the majority of entries
are from art majors, there are
others from students majoring in
subjects as diverse as chemistry,
physics, psychology, history, Eng
lish, Spanish literature, German,
business administration, and
speech and drama,
THE ENTRIES are exhibited
through-out th e main lobby of
! Tresidder and also in the show
| cases along the upper walk-ways.
Entries vary in media from oils,
watercolor, and ink, to wire and
! wood sculpture, and copper jewel
ry.
Ali el Jabri, an architecture ma
! jor, has several entries in the
j show'. An intriguing one is his
[ costume designs for “Hamlet.”
! The king’s costume is silver, the
j queen’s a hot pink, each overlaid
with an intricate flame-like gold
1 pattern. Another of his entries is

“Innocent Apple Cider,” a collage
of real textures including wood,
iron, a woven mat, a leaf, and
paper.
DAVID SHEA, a psychology
major, has done pencil drawings
of an evidently favorite subject
for him, locomotives. There is
also a scale model of a train in
his “Composition in Rod and Yel
low.”
An art major, Warren Wood
painted “Festival" in oils, build
ing up succeeding layers of
orange, blue, and green, and using
a palette knife for texture effects
in the non-objective composition.
Wood also has made unique use
of an every-day object, the blade
from a rotary lawnmower. Far
from ordinary however, this one
has been painted with the intense
reds, yellows, and blues Wood
used in “Tivoli Two.”

Sherry Smith, an art major,
uses non-glare glass over her
painting, “Panther," and achieves
a curious effect of light in the
abstract design of natural forms
she has chosen to portray a pan
ther’s habitat.
“FOREST," BY Claire Hartzell,
speech and drama, utilizes another

light effect. After painting, the
paper has been roughed up to tear
off bits of it, producting white
dabs of sunlight on the landscape.
David Seaman’s “Presence #37”
is a study of linear perspective, as
dark vertical poles fade into the
atmospheric intense gold back
ground. Seaman is a German ma
jor.
Betty McFarland, a chemistry
major, has entered her sculpture,
“Sheltered.” Done in wood, it is
the figure of a child securely hud
dled up atop a stack of planks.
THERE IS ALSO one showcase
with a branch in it and on that
branch are the jewelry entries.
There are copper enameled medal
lions. bracelets, and earrings, and
two hand maid, smoothly curved,
gold and pearl rings.
These are only a few of the
many entries that mark an excel
lent beginning for the newly in
augurated annual student art
show.
