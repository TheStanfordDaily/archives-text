HAPPY TALK
A.s we all know, conversation is terribly important on a date.
W hen hills in the conversation run longer than an hour or two,
one s partner is inclined to grow logy even sullen. But oc
casionally one finds it difficult to keep the talk going, especiallv
when one is ha ving a first date with one. \\ hat, then, does one do?
, If one is wise, one follows the brilliant example of Harlow
Thurlow.
Harlow Thurlow prepares. That is his simple secret. When
Harlow is going to take out a new girl, he makes sure in advance
that the conversation will not languish. Before the date, he
goes to the library and reads all 24 volumes of the encyclopedia
and transcribes their contents on his cuffs. Thus he makes sure
that no matter what his date’s interests arc, he will have ample
material to keep the conversation alive.
fake, for example, Harlow’s first date with Priscilla de
(lasser, a fine, strapping, blue-eyed broth of a girl, lavishly
constructed and rosy as the dawn.
Harlow was, as always, prepared when he called for Priscilla,
and, as always, he did not start to converse immediately. First
he took her to dinner because, as everyone knows, it is useless
to try to make conversation with an unfed coed. Her attention
span is negligible. Also, her stomach rumbles so loud it is diffi
cult to make yourself heard.

So he took her to a fine steak house where he stoked her with
gobbets of Black Angus and mounds of French fries and thick
ets of escarole and battalions of petit fours. Then, at last,
dinner was over and the waiter brought two finger bowls.
“I hope you enjoyed your dinner, my dear,” said Harlow,
dipping into his finger bowl.
“Oh, it was grandy-dandy!” said Priscilla. “Now let's go
someplace for ribs.”
“Later, perhaps,” said Harlow. “But right now, I thought
we might have a conversation.”
“Oh, goody, goody, two-shoes!” cried Priscilla. “I been
looking everywhere for a hoy who can carry on a intelligent
conversation.”
“Your search is ended, madam,” said Harlow, and pulled
back his sleeves and looked at his cuffs to pick a likely topic to
start the conversation.
Oh, woe! Oh, lackaday! Those cuffs on which Harlow had
painstakingly transcribed so many facts those cuffs on which
he had noted such diverse and fascinating information—those
cuffs, I say, were nothing now but a big, blue blur! For Harlow
poor I lurlow!—splashing around in the finger bowl, had gotten
his cuffs wet and the ink had run and not one word was legible!
And Harlow poor Harlow! looked upon his cuffs and broke
out in a night sweat and fell dumb.
“1 must say,” said Priscilla after several silent hours, “that
you arc a very dull fellow. I’m leaving.”
With that she flounced away and poor Harlow was too
crushed to protest. Sadly he sat and sadly lit a cigarette.
All of a sudden Priscilla came rushing back. “Was that,” she
asked, “a Marlboro you just lit?”
“Yes,” said Harlow.
“Then you are not a dull fellow,” she cried, and sprang into
his lap. “You are bright! Anybody is bright to smoke such a
perfect joy of a cigarette as Marlboro which is just chock full
of yummy flavor, which has a Selectrate filter which comes in a
soft pack that is really soft, and a Flip-Top Box that really flips,
and which can be bought wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty
states and Duluth . . . Harlow, tiger, wash your cuffs and
be my love.”
“Okay,” said Harlow, and did, and was. © io«am«iBhuim»»
