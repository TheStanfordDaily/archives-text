Assignment: make our cars
more rust resistant
//

A%.
Salt-water bath is one of tests
used to check rust protection
built into Ford-built cars.
Result: ’63 Ford-built cars are
better protected against rust
than ever before
To tackle this assignment, Ford Motor Company
engineers turned to zinc. Galvanized, or zinc-clad,
steel has long been noted for its resistance to corro
sion. It presented special problems which had limited
its use in automotive applications, however. It was
hard to weld, difficult to paint.
Our engineers developed special techniques to solve
the welding problem. They found a process which
eliminates the crystalline pattern on galvanized steel
and produces a surface that will accept a high-quality
paint job.
Now zinc can be married to steel and used for vital
underbody parts and rocker panels of Ford-built cars.
The zinc coating forms a tough barrier to corrosive
moisture—and if corrosion attacks, the zinc sacrifices
itself through galvanic action, saving the steel.
Other avenues explored in the fight against rust also
brought results: special zinc-rich primers to protect
key body areas, aluminized and stainless steels to
extend muffler life, quality baked-enamel finishes that
are more durable (and look better).
Another step forward in total quality—and another
example of how Ford Motor Company provides engi*
peering leadership for the American Road.
