NEW DELHl—Chinese Communist hordes overran the Indian
mountain airbase town of Bomdila yesterday in a major break
through that turned the undeclared border war into a full-fledged
invasion threatening the rich plains of northern India 25 miles away.
The news was so grave Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru made an
unscheduled radio appearance last night to inform the nation of the
loss and announce he had asked the United States and Britain for
“massive” military aid for what he called India’s fight to maintain
its independence.
The State Department, meanwhile, said this country was giving
“urgent and sympathetic” attention to requests by India for arms,
including transport planes and mountain warfare equipment.
ADENAUER GOVERNMENT IN DANGER BONN- All five free
Democratic Party (FDPi ministers resigned yesterday from the co
alition cabinet because of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s refusal to
fire Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss, threatening a crisis that
could topple Adenauer from power after 13 years. The FDP had
given Adenauer an ultimatum to oust Strauss or face the loss of its
vital parliamentary support. It said it could not participate in a
government with Strauss because of his alleged role in the contro
versial case of the news magazine Dei Spiegel.
