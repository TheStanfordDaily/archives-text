# Men's Council Election
## 
### 
The improprieties exposed in last week’s Men’s Council elec
tion tend to discredit the Council, one of the candidates for Men’s
Council, and especially the system of electing Men’s Council in
stead of appointing the Council.
Beau Bianchi, the member of Men’s Council who authorized
candidate Brad Freeman to tear down several campaign posters
of another candidate, is guilty of gross mis judgment. Mr. Bianchi’s
part in the affair was improper since Men’s Council has no au
thority over electioneering, since he was a campaign aide for
Mr. Freeman, and since he is Mr. Freeman’s fraternity brother.
Mr. Bianchi told Mr. Freeman to take the posters down be
cause “J thought they were in had taste.” When the posters were
removed, the voting for the primary was over but presumably the
election was not over since there might have been a final if Mr.
Smiland and Mr. Freeman had not won majorities in the primary.
When Mr. Bianchi had the posters removed, he “knew the election
was won since Freeman and Smiland were five times ahead.”
The chief importance of this dispute would seem to be its
role as an illustration that Men’s Council should be appointed as
in the proposed constitution, not elected as under the present
constitution of the ASSU.
