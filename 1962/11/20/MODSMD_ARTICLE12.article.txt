## The 						Points of My Compass: Collected E. B. White Letters

“The Points of My Compass”
by E. B. White: Harper & Row,
.$l.OO, 240 pages, unabridged.
“The Points of My Compass”
by E. B. White is a collection of
letters to the “New Yorker” pre
senting a kaleidoscopic view of
life as seen through the eyes of
“a self-appointed foreign corres
pondent who elected to stay at
home.” Rearranging geography
to fulfill this desire, Mr, White
chose a place in New York to be
the center of his compass. Let
ters from the East bear datelines,
not from Singapore or New Del
hi, but from Allen Cove, his home
in Maine, or Turtle Bay in New
York. Other delightfully named
places such as Fiddler Bayou and
Jeffreys Hook round out the
globe and recreate for the reader
events ranging from a circus in
Florida to a storm on the Alas
kan seas.
Any reader, having moved to a
new home, can smile and sympa
thize with the author’s difficulty
in leaving an old one.
“ALL SORTS of special prob
lems arise during the days of dis
posal. Anyone who is willing to
put his mind to it can get rid of
a chair, say, but what about a
trophy? Trophies are like
leeches. The ones made of paper
. . . can be burned if you have
the guts to light the match, but
the ones made of bronze not only
are indestructable but are almost
impossible to throw away, be
cause they usually carry your
name, and a man doesn’t like to
throw away his good name, or
even his bad one. Some busybody
might find it.”
Mr. White is a realist, but a
sentimental one. He gives us the
addresses of pigeon nests in New
York City, relates the problems

of buying a new ear, discusses
political campaigns and the dan
gers of fallout.
His vision is of “shapes—not
the shape of things to come but
the shape of things that are.” The
shapes of television and the U.N.
come before us in realistic form.
Several of the letters, written
some five or six years ago, ai’e
not changed but brought up to
date in postscripts.
The humor is that of a man
truly in love with life. His de
fense of Thoreau’s “Walden,” be
ing itself almost Thoreauvian in
character reveals such a man. A
description of a snowstorm
touches his reader with a deep
appreciation of beauty.
“AS I SAT at table, gnawing
away at a piece of pie, snow be
gan falling. At first it was an al
most imperceptible spitting from
the gray sky, but it soon thicken
ed and came driving in from the
northeast. I watched it catch
along the edge of the drive, pow
der the stone wall, dust the
spruce cover on the flower bor
ders, coat the plowed land, and
whiten the surface of the dark
frozen pond, and I knew that all
along the coast, from Kittery on,
the worst mistakes of men were
being quietly erased, the lines of
their industrial temples softened,
and U.S. 1 crowned with a cold,
inexpensive glory.”
Mr. White, also the author of
“The Second Tree From the Cor
ner,” recipient of the gold medal
from the National Institute of
Arts and Letters in 1960, has
written in “The Points of My
Compass” a very different col
lection of essays. This book, call
ed by one magazine article writer
“a very ‘sec’ but nourishing sher
ry,” is to bo highly recommended
to all readers, both young and old
alike.
