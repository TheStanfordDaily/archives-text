Editor, The Daily:
Regarding my recent landslide
victory in the LASSU elections:
1) This is, despite outward ap
pearances, a true example of de
mocracy in action. The graduate
students of the School of Earth
Sciences have, by their massive
reaction to the elections, clearly
indicated their faith in LASSU’s
ability to carry on in its usual
fashion without our aid and/or
abettance.
2) It is also a prime example
of the power of a small but well
organized minority group, en
dowed with a clear vision of its
duty to posterity, to gain its ob
jectives in a free election.
3) I would like to thank the
multitudinous members of my
party machinery, who by their
diligent campaigning and tireless
efforts made this victory a reali
ty. Thank you for your confi
dence in me, whoever you may
be.
4) As duly elected representa
tive and charismatic leader of the
Mineral and Earth Scientists of
Stanford University (MESSU), I
shall attempt to carry out my
part in this farce to the fullest
extent of my inability.

Editor, Tlie Daily:
Canon Bryan Green has come
again and gone, having renewed
in his audience a sense of hu
mility and a knowledge of the
practicality of religion. He de
voted his sermon not to the usual
transcendant matters, but to mat

ters of peculiar interest at Stan
ford: he answered a year-old crit
icism from a Stanford professor.
The professor had accused Green
of arrogance in making all man
kind accomplice to the Crucifix
ion. Such Pharisees may swat the
gnat of a loose sentence (so said
the rector from Birmingham),
but they will swallow the camel
of godlessness and sexual indul
gence.

To the layman, who may not
understand why Gi’een’s critic is
particularly liable to godlessness
and sexual indulgence, he will ex
plain. He, the humble canon, will
hand down the definition of hu
mility- humility, the possession
of the uneducated, the child-like,
and the Christian.

The Pharisaic attitude may
have its good points, Green had
the Grace to say; but the Phari
see does not have a humble
awareness of his own inadequacy.
The Pharisee and the faculty
member will deny their guilt; but
the Christian, like Canon Green,
will admit his faults. The flimsi
ness of the statement about the
Crucifixion matters not at all: he
will build on stone and assert
again the guilt of his critic in the
death of Jesus. Humbling himself
before God, he will unashamedly
confess his shame and admit to
the correctness of his universal
condemnation. Surely we, his au
dience, faced with his example,
will echo his prayer for us and
for his benighted critic: God,
make us aware of our own self
centeredness.
