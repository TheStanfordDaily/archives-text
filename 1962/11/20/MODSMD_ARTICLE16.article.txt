# ALLIANCE TO HELP?
## Brazil Beset with Problems In Economy, Political Structure 
### BRIAN JENSEN 
(Editor’s note: Brian Jensen Is a former editor of (lie Yale Daily

a year studying economic and political conditions in Latin and
South America.)
SAC) PAULO, Brazil—Cuba has compelled most Latin Ameri
can countries to raise their heads above the murky waters of
ambiguity and to announce their deepest convictions as regards
hemisphere solidarity. Brazil, largest in size and population and
ostensibly the most industrialized South American country, has

tried to assert herself during this- 1
crisis as the leader of hemisphere
policy by attempting to peace
fully bring Fidel back into the
hemisphere fold, while at the
same moment securing assurance
that no missile bases will be es
tablished in the hemisphere.
While the success of this move
is very much in doubt owing to
wide divergence of opinion over
Cuba, it nevertheless sheds some
light on Brazil’s internal econom
ic and political affairs as well as
the present struggle Brazil is ev
periencing in connection with the
Alliance for Progress.
Since Janio Quadros' hasty and
unexpected resignation jango
Goulart has been waging a pain
ful war to consolidate his politi
cal position. As a result of the
fact that a conservative congress
has been unwilling to give Jango
the power he wants he has ap
pealed to the laboring masses to
back him with a plebiscite.
If the plebiscite is successful
then Jango will end up with pow
er litle short of that of a dictator.
But it is this political jockeying
around which has left the country
in a state of turmoil; much need
ed reform has been neglected
while the economic position of the
country has deteriorated consid
erably. (At any rate the printing
business, i.e. currency printing,
has seen no lack of demand).
THE BRAZILIAN Cuban move
was clearly designed to help cre
ate an international image of a
powerful Brazil under the com
mand of a strong President with
full support of the country, and
President Kennedy’s forthcoming
visit was expected to contribute
to Goulart’s strength. We must
question whether foreign policy
designed under circumstances
such as these can contribute
much to the world outside of con
fusion.
The Brazilian stand on Cuba
reflects the growing division in
internal politics. Both the north
and the south —where economic
control is in the hands of a feu
dal aristocracy, where poverty is
widespread, and where political
control has fallen into the hands
of leftists—have found a power
ful symbol in Fidel and naturally
wish to remain associated with
him. And Brazil’s President Gou
lart is a wealthy southern far
mer.

scribed above has caused Brazil
to have a mild case of economic
thrombosis. Most of the relevant
indicators of an economy’s health
point to one conclusion—Brazil is
practically bankrupt—she suffers
from acute capital shortage.
THIS PAST year will show the
highest percentage of inflation in
Brazil’s history—officially record
ed at 50 per cent but will most
likely top 70 per cent. Brazil’s
exchange balance has plummeted
to record indebtedness, and the
dollar value has shot up accord
ingly—much of this owing to the
fact that most of Brazil’s for
eign income comes from agricul
tural commodities like coffee
whose world prices have been de
clining while her foreign expendi
tures are made on heavy indus
trial equipment where prices
have been increasing.
The number of new industry
starts in Brazil has suffered a
shock and slipped from between
1300-1400 in ’6O and ’6l to an es
timated 800 for 1962. A close look
at newly created industry also
shows that a majority are in the
non-productive speculative fields
of real estate-investment, com
merce and construction. I Sao
Paulo’s building boom has made
this the fastest growing city in
the world—no one can save so
that most of the money has fled
into construction somehow it
seems unreal to say that this
building boom reflects a sound
and growing economy). When
you consider that Brazil needs to
create jobs for an ever augment
ing labor force, (hen the inflation
is producing negative contribu
tions—and yet many Brazilian
politicians, students and econo
mists maintain that hyperinfla
tion is a necessary stimulant for
rapid economic growth. Of
course, Brazil’s decision to limit
profit remittance has scared
away most foreign investment.
Many American firms have
frankly stated no more dollars
for Brazil. And one discovers the
interesting paradox that several
American firms have not yet re
mitted even one dollar, but rather
have plowed all profits back into
local expansion. Along comes the
law and the American stockhold
ers yell—the forbidden fruit only
becomes precious when it is for
bidden. Here as in the political
realm Brazil has only been able
to pursue an economic policy
which might be termed—respon
sive—a patching up of catastro
phe-—a sort of putting the finger
in the dike approach.

On the other hand, the wealthy
industrialized states of Sao Paulo
and Guanabarra would like to be
rid of the devil Fidel forever. Sao
Paulo’s extreme conservative
leanings were reflected in the re
cent election of wealthy industri
alist Ademar de Barros as Gover
nor who is strongly anti-commu
nist, anti-reformist, pro-Ademar,
and pro-America.
THEREFORE for the time be
ing national policy be it foreign
or economic becomes a compro
mise between these two opposing
political forces-—the highly con
servative and the pink leftist.
While this divorce exists one
cannot expect too much real prog
ress in Brazil, ami all political
energy is expended in efforts to
retain the delicate balance of
power. However, if real progress
does not arrive soon in all of Bra
zil, we may see a civil war make
the division real rather than nom
inal.

It is into this confusion that the

right may have to be rewritten

SAC) PAULO, Brazil—Cuba has compelled most Latin Ameri
can countries to raise their heads above the murky waters of
ambiguity and to announce their deepest convictions as regards
hemisphere solidarity. Brazil, largest in size and population and
ostensibly the most industrialized South American country, has

tried to assert herself during this- 1
crisis as the leader of hemisphere
policy by attempting to peace
fully bring Fidel back into the
hemisphere fold, while at the
same moment securing assurance
that no missile bases will be es
tablished in the hemisphere.
While the success of this move
is very much in doubt owing to
wide divergence of opinion over
Cuba, it nevertheless sheds some
light on Brazil’s internal econom
ic and political affairs as well as
the present struggle Brazil is ev
periencing in connection with the
Alliance for Progress.
Since Janio Quadros' hasty and
unexpected resignation jango
Goulart has been waging a pain
ful war to consolidate his politi
cal position. As a result of the
fact that a conservative congress
has been unwilling to give Jango
the power he wants he has ap
pealed to the laboring masses to
back him with a plebiscite.
If the plebiscite is successful
then Jango will end up with pow
er litle short of that of a dictator.
But it is this political jockeying
around which has left the country
in a state of turmoil; much need
ed reform has been neglected
while the economic position of the
country has deteriorated consid
erably. (At any rate the printing
business, i.e. currency printing,
has seen no lack of demand).
THE BRAZILIAN Cuban move
was clearly designed to help cre
ate an international image of a
powerful Brazil under the com
mand of a strong President with
full support of the country, and
President Kennedy’s forthcoming
visit was expected to contribute
to Goulart’s strength. We must
question whether foreign policy
designed under circumstances
such as these can contribute
much to the world outside of con
fusion.
The Brazilian stand on Cuba
reflects the growing division in
internal politics. Both the north
and the south —where economic
control is in the hands of a feu
dal aristocracy, where poverty is
widespread, and where political
control has fallen into the hands
of leftists—have found a power
ful symbol in Fidel and naturally
wish to remain associated with
him. And Brazil’s President Gou
lart is a wealthy southern far
mer.

scribed above has caused Brazil
to have a mild case of economic
thrombosis. Most of the relevant
indicators of an economy’s health
point to one conclusion—Brazil is
practically bankrupt—she suffers
from acute capital shortage.
THIS PAST year will show the
highest percentage of inflation in
Brazil’s history—officially record
ed at 50 per cent but will most
likely top 70 per cent. Brazil’s
exchange balance has plummeted
to record indebtedness, and the
dollar value has shot up accord
ingly—much of this owing to the
fact that most of Brazil’s for
eign income comes from agricul
tural commodities like coffee
whose world prices have been de
clining while her foreign expendi
tures are made on heavy indus
trial equipment where prices
have been increasing.
The number of new industry
starts in Brazil has suffered a
shock and slipped from between
1300-1400 in ’6O and ’6l to an es
timated 800 for 1962. A close look
at newly created industry also
shows that a majority are in the
non-productive speculative fields
of real estate-investment, com
merce and construction. I Sao
Paulo’s building boom has made
this the fastest growing city in
the world—no one can save so
that most of the money has fled
into construction somehow it
seems unreal to say that this
building boom reflects a sound
and growing economy). When
you consider that Brazil needs to
create jobs for an ever augment
ing labor force, (hen the inflation
is producing negative contribu
tions—and yet many Brazilian
politicians, students and econo
mists maintain that hyperinfla
tion is a necessary stimulant for
rapid economic growth. Of
course, Brazil’s decision to limit
profit remittance has scared
away most foreign investment.
Many American firms have
frankly stated no more dollars
for Brazil. And one discovers the
interesting paradox that several
American firms have not yet re
mitted even one dollar, but rather
have plowed all profits back into
local expansion. Along comes the
law and the American stockhold
ers yell—the forbidden fruit only
becomes precious when it is for
bidden. Here as in the political
realm Brazil has only been able
to pursue an economic policy
which might be termed—respon
sive—a patching up of catastro
phe-—a sort of putting the finger
in the dike approach.

On the other hand, the wealthy
industrialized states of Sao Paulo
and Guanabarra would like to be
rid of the devil Fidel forever. Sao

SAC) PAULO, Brazil—Cuba has compelled most Latin Ameri
can countries to raise their heads above the murky waters of
ambiguity and to announce their deepest convictions as regards
hemisphere solidarity. Brazil, largest in size and population and
ostensibly the most industrialized South American country, has

tried to assert herself during this- 1
crisis as the leader of hemisphere
policy by attempting to peace
fully bring Fidel back into the
hemisphere fold, while at the
same moment securing assurance
that no missile bases will be es
tablished in the hemisphere.
While the success of this move
is very much in doubt owing to
wide divergence of opinion over
Cuba, it nevertheless sheds some
light on Brazil’s internal econom
ic and political affairs as well as
the present struggle Brazil is ev
periencing in connection with the
Alliance for Progress.
Since Janio Quadros' hasty and
unexpected resignation jango
Goulart has been waging a pain
ful war to consolidate his politi
cal position. As a result of the
fact that a conservative congress
has been unwilling to give Jango
the power he wants he has ap
pealed to the laboring masses to
back him with a plebiscite.
If the plebiscite is successful
then Jango will end up with pow
er litle short of that of a dictator.
But it is this political jockeying
around which has left the country
in a state of turmoil; much need
ed reform has been neglected
while the economic position of the
country has deteriorated consid
erably. (At any rate the printing
business, i.e. currency printing,
has seen no lack of demand).
THE BRAZILIAN Cuban move
was clearly designed to help cre
ate an international image of a
powerful Brazil under the com
mand of a strong President with
full support of the country, and
President Kennedy’s forthcoming
visit was expected to contribute
to Goulart’s strength. We must
question whether foreign policy
designed under circumstances
such as these can contribute
much to the world outside of con
fusion.
The Brazilian stand on Cuba
reflects the growing division in
internal politics. Both the north
and the south —where economic
control is in the hands of a feu
dal aristocracy, where poverty is
widespread, and where political
control has fallen into the hands
of leftists—have found a power
ful symbol in Fidel and naturally
wish to remain associated with
him. And Brazil’s President Gou
lart is a wealthy southern far
mer.

scribed above has caused Brazil
to have a mild case of economic
thrombosis. Most of the relevant
indicators of an economy’s health
point to one conclusion—Brazil is
practically bankrupt—she suffers
from acute capital shortage.
THIS PAST year will show the
highest percentage of inflation in
Brazil’s history—officially record
ed at 50 per cent but will most
likely top 70 per cent. Brazil’s
exchange balance has plummeted
to record indebtedness, and the
dollar value has shot up accord
ingly—much of this owing to the
fact that most of Brazil’s for
eign income comes from agricul
tural commodities like coffee
whose world prices have been de
clining while her foreign expendi
tures are made on heavy indus
trial equipment where prices
have been increasing.
The number of new industry
starts in Brazil has suffered a
shock and slipped from between
1300-1400 in ’6O and ’6l to an es

control has fallen into the hands
of leftists—have found a power
ful symbol in Fidel and naturally
wish to remain associated with
him. And Brazil’s President Gou
lart is a wealthy southern far
mer.

scribed above has caused Brazil
to have a mild case of economic
thrombosis. Most of the relevant
indicators of an economy’s health
point to one conclusion—Brazil is
practically bankrupt—she suffers
from acute capital shortage.
THIS PAST year will show the
highest percentage of inflation in
Brazil’s history—officially record
ed at 50 per cent but will most
likely top 70 per cent. Brazil’s
exchange balance has plummeted
to record indebtedness, and the
dollar value has shot up accord
ingly—much of this owing to the
fact that most of Brazil’s for
eign income comes from agricul
tural commodities like coffee
whose world prices have been de
clining while her foreign expendi
tures are made on heavy indus
trial equipment where prices
have been increasing.
The number of new industry
starts in Brazil has suffered a
shock and slipped from between
1300-1400 in ’6O and ’6l to an es
timated 800 for 1962. A close look
at newly created industry also
shows that a majority are in the
non-productive speculative fields
of real estate-investment, com
merce and construction. I Sao
Paulo’s building boom has made
this the fastest growing city in
the world—no one can save so
that most of the money has fled
into construction somehow it
seems unreal to say that this
building boom reflects a sound
and growing economy). When
you consider that Brazil needs to
create jobs for an ever augment
ing labor force, (hen the inflation
is producing negative contribu
tions—and yet many Brazilian
politicians, students and econo
mists maintain that hyperinfla
tion is a necessary stimulant for
rapid economic growth. Of
course, Brazil’s decision to limit
profit remittance has scared
away most foreign investment.
Many American firms have
frankly stated no more dollars
for Brazil. And one discovers the
interesting paradox that several
American firms have not yet re
mitted even one dollar, but rather
have plowed all profits back into
local expansion. Along comes the
law and the American stockhold
ers yell—the forbidden fruit only
becomes precious when it is for
bidden. Here as in the political
realm Brazil has only been able
to pursue an economic policy
which might be termed—respon
sive—a patching up of catastro
phe-—a sort of putting the finger
in the dike approach.

On the other hand, the wealthy
industrialized states of Sao Paulo
and Guanabarra would like to be
rid of the devil Fidel forever. Sao
Paulo’s extreme conservative
leanings were reflected in the re
cent election of wealthy industri
alist Ademar de Barros as Gover
nor who is strongly anti-commu
nist, anti-reformist, pro-Ademar,
and pro-America.
THEREFORE for the time be
ing national policy be it foreign
or economic becomes a compro
mise between these two opposing
political forces-—the highly con
servative and the pink leftist.
While this divorce exists one
cannot expect too much real prog
ress in Brazil, ami all political
energy is expended in efforts to
retain the delicate balance of
power. However, if real progress
does not arrive soon in all of Bra
zil, we may see a civil war make
the division real rather than nom
inal.

SAC) PAULO, Brazil—Cuba has compelled most Latin Ameri
can countries to raise their heads above the murky waters of
ambiguity and to announce their deepest convictions as regards
hemisphere solidarity. Brazil, largest in size and population and
ostensibly the most industrialized South American country, has

tried to assert herself during this- 1
crisis as the leader of hemisphere
policy by attempting to peace
fully bring Fidel back into the
hemisphere fold, while at the
same moment securing assurance
that no missile bases will be es
tablished in the hemisphere.
While the success of this move
is very much in doubt owing to
wide divergence of opinion over
Cuba, it nevertheless sheds some
light on Brazil’s internal econom
ic and political affairs as well as
the present struggle Brazil is ev
periencing in connection with the
Alliance for Progress.
Since Janio Quadros' hasty and
unexpected resignation jango
Goulart has been waging a pain
ful war to consolidate his politi
cal position. As a result of the
fact that a conservative congress
has been unwilling to give Jango
the power he wants he has ap
pealed to the laboring masses to
back him with a plebiscite.
If the plebiscite is successful
then Jango will end up with pow
er litle short of that of a dictator.
But it is this political jockeying
around which has left the country
in a state of turmoil; much need
ed reform has been neglected
while the economic position of the
country has deteriorated consid
erably. (At any rate the printing
business, i.e. currency printing,
has seen no lack of demand).
THE BRAZILIAN Cuban move
was clearly designed to help cre
ate an international image of a
powerful Brazil under the com
mand of a strong President with
full support of the country, and
President Kennedy’s forthcoming
visit was expected to contribute
to Goulart’s strength. We must
question whether foreign policy
designed under circumstances
such as these can contribute
much to the world outside of con
fusion.
The Brazilian stand on Cuba
reflects the growing division in
internal politics. Both the north
and the south —where economic
control is in the hands of a feu
dal aristocracy, where poverty is
widespread, and where political
control has fallen into the hands
of leftists—have found a power
ful symbol in Fidel and naturally
wish to remain associated with
him. And Brazil’s President Gou
