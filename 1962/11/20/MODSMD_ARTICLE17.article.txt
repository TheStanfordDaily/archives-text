# Rosencranz Urges Students To GROWL Today
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOƑERSON 
ASSU President Armin Rosen
cranz, in an interview Friday, en
dorsed the proposed constitution
which will come before the elec
torate today and tomorrow.
“I urge all students to GROWL,
‘Get Rosencranz Off Wally’s
Legislature’, and approve the new
constitution,” said Rosencranz,
referring to the fact that the new
constitution would remove him as
presiding officer of Legislature
and allow him to devote his time
more fully to the duties of the
ASSU’s chief executive.
Rosencranz asserted that the
old constitution provided neither
for adequate representation nor
for separation of executive and
legislative powers.
“Even a cursory reading of the
old constitution reveals that it is
a finky document,” he said.
“For example,” he said, “under
the old constitution LASSU
spends a good portion of its time
censoring student groups. If a
group comes in and wants to
form, and there is nothing in the
Fundamental Standard prevent
ing this, then I say, godammit,
let it form.”
Rosencranz commended the ef
forts to eliminate the major
flaws of the old constitution, and
asserted that the proposed re
placement “is a vast improve
ment over that old and finky doc
ument which is now in effect.”
“Some people say they aren’t
completely satisfied with the pro
posed constitution,” he said, “hut
remember, a vole for the new
constitution is a vote against the
old.”
The ASSU President reiterated
the need to provide for a larger,
representative legislature, and ap
pointed instead of elected judici
ary, and a separation of execu
tive and legislative authority.
“For once the campus activists
have come up with something
which I can support. The thing to
do is growl and pass the bloody
thing.” he concluded.
to be suffering from a curious
form of Parkinson’s disease-—too
many groups are handing out
funds and too many groups
claim to have priority for the
funds. The resulting lack of con
trol has created a Pandora’s box
for local politicians whose
tongues can make anything look
like a need.
The local small-town rural
mayors are especially suspect in
this case since they are very
much like feudal landlords, and
it is easy for us to guess where
the money will find home. We
must further question whether
the purported objectives of in
creasing educational opportuni
ties and health will really solve
very much since education will
only breed discontent if no chal
lenging jobs exist for the educat
ed, while additional health meas
ures will only succeed in enlarg
ing the vast population explosion
problem which in South America
is the highest per capita in the
world.
With such a rapidly increasing
population, it is virtually impos
sible to make real gains in the
per capita standard of living. Fi
nally it must be realized that the
Alliance is in substance an aid
program, but that the amount of
aid promised for the next twenty
years is barely enough to cover
the losses Latin America has suf
fered in her balance of payments
owing to commodity price de
clines.
WHETHER or not the Alliance
can make a significant contribu
tion to the problem is a serious
question. But first it ought to de
fine itself more clearly, take a
tougher line which in turn might
force the Brazilian government
to reciprocate and sharpen up its
objectives.
Basically the Alliance should
be considered as a tool to assist
the latent private initiative which
is waiting for a chance to make
Brazil go—the real key to prog
ress in Brazil and in the under
developed world for that matter
is the effective organization of
the vast potential of human and
physical resources. This is a job
which only well trained men, di
rected by the right incentives can
accomplish. This is a job for pri
vate industry, with proper help
from government since few gov
ernments in the world would re
ceive a passing mark in a man
agement course.

Rosencranz asserted that the

form, and there is nothing in the
Fundamental Standard prevent

Rosencranz commended the ef

asserted that the proposed re

“Some people say they aren’t
completely satisfied with the pro

many groups are handing out

tongues can make anything look
like a need.
The local small-town rural
mayors are especially suspect in
this case since they are very
much like feudal landlords, and
it is easy for us to guess where
the money will find home. We
must further question whether
the purported objectives of in
creasing educational opportuni

only breed discontent if no chal
lenging jobs exist for the educat

ures will only succeed in enlarg
ing the vast population explosion
problem which in South America
is the highest per capita in the
world.
With such a rapidly increasing
population, it is virtually impos
sible to make real gains in the
per capita standard of living. Fi

Alliance is in substance an aid
program, but that the amount of
aid promised for the next twenty
years is barely enough to cover
the losses Latin America has suf
fered in her balance of payments
owing to commodity price de
clines.
WHETHER or not the Alliance
can make a significant contribu
tion to the problem is a serious
question. But first it ought to de
fine itself more clearly, take a
tougher line which in turn might
force the Brazilian government
to reciprocate and sharpen up its
objectives.
Basically the Alliance should
be considered as a tool to assist
the latent private initiative which
is waiting for a chance to make
Brazil go—the real key to prog

developed world for that matter

the vast potential of human and
physical resources. This is a job
which only well trained men, di
rected by the right incentives can
accomplish. This is a job for pri

constitution would remove him as
presiding officer of Legislature
and allow him to devote his time
more fully to the duties of the
ASSU’s chief executive.
Rosencranz asserted that the
old constitution provided neither
for adequate representation nor
for separation of executive and
legislative powers.
“Even a cursory reading of the
old constitution reveals that it is
a finky document,” he said.
“For example,” he said, “under
the old constitution LASSU
spends a good portion of its time
censoring student groups. If a
group comes in and wants to
form, and there is nothing in the
Fundamental Standard prevent
ing this, then I say, godammit,
let it form.”
Rosencranz commended the ef
forts to eliminate the major
flaws of the old constitution, and
asserted that the proposed re
placement “is a vast improve
ment over that old and finky doc
ument which is now in effect.”
“Some people say they aren’t
completely satisfied with the pro
posed constitution,” he said, “hut
remember, a vole for the new
constitution is a vote against the
old.”
The ASSU President reiterated
the need to provide for a larger,
representative legislature, and ap
pointed instead of elected judici
ary, and a separation of execu
tive and legislative authority.
“For once the campus activists
have come up with something
which I can support. The thing to
do is growl and pass the bloody
thing.” he concluded.
to be suffering from a curious
form of Parkinson’s disease-—too
many groups are handing out
funds and too many groups
claim to have priority for the
funds. The resulting lack of con
trol has created a Pandora’s box
for local politicians whose
tongues can make anything look
like a need.
The local small-town rural
mayors are especially suspect in
this case since they are very
much like feudal landlords, and
it is easy for us to guess where
the money will find home. We
must further question whether
the purported objectives of in
creasing educational opportuni
ties and health will really solve
very much since education will
only breed discontent if no chal
lenging jobs exist for the educat
ed, while additional health meas
ures will only succeed in enlarg
ing the vast population explosion
problem which in South America
is the highest per capita in the
world.
With such a rapidly increasing
population, it is virtually impos
sible to make real gains in the
per capita standard of living. Fi
nally it must be realized that the
Alliance is in substance an aid
program, but that the amount of
aid promised for the next twenty
years is barely enough to cover
the losses Latin America has suf
fered in her balance of payments
owing to commodity price de
clines.
WHETHER or not the Alliance
can make a significant contribu
tion to the problem is a serious
question. But first it ought to de
fine itself more clearly, take a
tougher line which in turn might
force the Brazilian government
to reciprocate and sharpen up its
objectives.
Basically the Alliance should
be considered as a tool to assist
the latent private initiative which
is waiting for a chance to make
Brazil go—the real key to prog
ress in Brazil and in the under
developed world for that matter
is the effective organization of
the vast potential of human and
physical resources. This is a job
which only well trained men, di
rected by the right incentives can
accomplish. This is a job for pri
vate industry, with proper help
from government since few gov
ernments in the world would re
ceive a passing mark in a man
agement course.
