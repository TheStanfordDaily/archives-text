# Big Game Axe Resides in New Union After Extended Absences from Farm
## 
### ANN TODD 
“Give ’em—the Axe—The Axe
—The Axe”—ln the neck is all
right but never in official sur
render after Big Game.
Now that it has found a formal
resting place in the new Union,
there is no excuse for relinquish
ing possession of the Axe (now
provided with a burglar alarm)
which can only bo lost Saturday
after a fantastic upset, namely,
Cal over Stanford.
THE AXE began as a Stanford
tradition on April 15, 1899, and
now, Big Game Week 1962, it is
again in our possession, but
somehow in between, precisely
sixty years of somehow in be
tween, the Axe has rested in Cal
hands, while enjoying the warm
Farm atmosphere for only ten.
As easily seen, the Axe has had
an erratic and somewhat unfor
tunate history, at least from an
unbiased Indian point of view.
Since the beginning of the offi
cial Axe yell in 1896, the Axe,
symbol of Stanford’s smashing
of Cal offense, has spent little
lime in Indian hands. From 1896
to 1930 Indian supporters never
saw it except when the Bears
waved it under our noses at Big
Game rallies.
Then in 1930, twenty-one brave,
courageous, and true “Sons of the
Stanford Red” conceived an Axe
Robbery which made the Great
Train Robbery seem like child’s
play or should I say Cal play.
THE STORY is true: nothing
has been changed to protect any
body. The time; April 30, 1930;
the place: Berkeley Branch of the
American Trust Company; ac
tion: after being appointed new
“guardian” of the Axe at a Greek
Theater Big Game Rally, Norman
Horner ’3l of Cal, returned the
Axe to the Trust Company, en
closed in an armored car and ac

companied by the usual fresh
man guard.
As the Cal contingent arrived
at the Trust Company, they wore
approached by a group of pho
tographers who easily posed the
freshman guard with a “Let’s
have a good shot at the Axe.’’
A good shot was right! Soon
gasping Cal freshmen were des
perately trying to escape the tear
bombs concealed in the cameras,
and poor Norman was forced to
give up possession of the Axe
minutes after becoming its
“guardian.”
CONCEALED under the sweat
er of Bob Loofbourow, the Axe
was removed from the scene of
the crime, and fifty minutes later
was on the Farm, after an eighty
five-mile-an-hour ride.
It was then decided that the
Axe would be prize to the Big
Game winner.
SINCE 1930 the Axe has travel
ed back and forth from Cal to
Stanford, and especially from
Stanford to Cal.
Most Cal and Stanford sup
porters now let Big Game decide
ownership. This Saturday marks
that time again so “Give ’Em
the Axe.” but only in the neck be
cause Tresidder Union needs dec
oration.


THE AXE, symbol of the Big Game given to the winner each year,
now resides in a case at Tresidder. It has been on the Farm for only
ten of the last sixty years.

porters now let Big Game decide
ownership. This Saturday marks
that time again so “Give ’Em
the Axe.” but only in the neck be
cause Tresidder Union needs dec
oration.


THE AXE, symbol of the Big Game given to the winner each year,
now resides in a case at Tresidder. It has been on the Farm for only
ten of the last sixty years.
“Give ’em—the Axe—The Axe
—The Axe”—ln the neck is all
right but never in official sur
render after Big Game.
Now that it has found a formal
resting place in the new Union,
there is no excuse for relinquish
ing possession of the Axe (now
provided with a burglar alarm)
which can only bo lost Saturday
after a fantastic upset, namely,
Cal over Stanford.
THE AXE began as a Stanford
tradition on April 15, 1899, and
now, Big Game Week 1962, it is
again in our possession, but
somehow in between, precisely
sixty years of somehow in be
tween, the Axe has rested in Cal
hands, while enjoying the warm
Farm atmosphere for only ten.
As easily seen, the Axe has had
an erratic and somewhat unfor
tunate history, at least from an
unbiased Indian point of view.
Since the beginning of the offi
cial Axe yell in 1896, the Axe,
symbol of Stanford’s smashing
of Cal offense, has spent little
lime in Indian hands. From 1896
to 1930 Indian supporters never
saw it except when the Bears
waved it under our noses at Big
Game rallies.
Then in 1930, twenty-one brave,
courageous, and true “Sons of the
Stanford Red” conceived an Axe
Robbery which made the Great
Train Robbery seem like child’s
play or should I say Cal play.
THE STORY is true: nothing
has been changed to protect any
body. The time; April 30, 1930;
the place: Berkeley Branch of the
American Trust Company; ac
tion: after being appointed new
“guardian” of the Axe at a Greek
Theater Big Game Rally, Norman
Horner ’3l of Cal, returned the
Axe to the Trust Company, en
closed in an armored car and ac

companied by the usual fresh
man guard.
As the Cal contingent arrived
at the Trust Company, they wore
approached by a group of pho
tographers who easily posed the
freshman guard with a “Let’s
have a good shot at the Axe.’’
A good shot was right! Soon
gasping Cal freshmen were des
perately trying to escape the tear
bombs concealed in the cameras,
and poor Norman was forced to
give up possession of the Axe
minutes after becoming its
“guardian.”
CONCEALED under the sweat
er of Bob Loofbourow, the Axe
was removed from the scene of
the crime, and fifty minutes later
was on the Farm, after an eighty
five-mile-an-hour ride.
It was then decided that the
Axe would be prize to the Big
Game winner.
SINCE 1930 the Axe has travel
ed back and forth from Cal to
Stanford, and especially from
Stanford to Cal.
Most Cal and Stanford sup
porters now let Big Game decide
ownership. This Saturday marks
that time again so “Give ’Em
the Axe.” but only in the neck be
