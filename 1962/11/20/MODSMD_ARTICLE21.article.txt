# Expanding Red 'S' First Card Stunt At College Games
## 
### AMY McINTOSH 
In 1923, a little blue “C” was
struck by a bolt of red lightning
and exploded, forming the first
expanding red “S”. Thus Stan
ford became the first University
to use card stunts in the rooting
section.
Enthusiasm in the rooting sec
tion has always been evident. In
1899, Stanford men adopted the
tradition of wearing red vests to
Big Game.
IN 1905, Stanford became the
first to perform yells at half-time.
Stanford men formed a red “S”
at games by wearing red and
white hats. Traditionally, the
most imaginative stunts have al
ways been saved for Big Game.
This year will be no exception,
according to Jerry Schaefer, Ral
ly Com chairman. The nature of
the stunts cannot be revealed be
fore the game, but approximately
eight stunts will be performed,
including a series of stunts hon
oring AI Masters, Stanford Di
rector of Athletics, who is retir
ing after thirty-eight years of
service. The finale will be the
traditional expanding red “S”.
The card stunts used to be ex
ecuted entirely by hand. After the
original idea was drawn up.
graphs were made of the rooting
section. Instructions were written
out by hand, and members of
Rally Com spent Saturday morn
ings getting the cards distributed
properly under the benches. Now,
however, the card stunts are pro
grammed on a Burroughs 220
computer, another first for the
Stanford rooting section. Larry
Tesler is in charge of the pro
gramming, and Carol Callaghan
is responsible for writing up the
data for the computer.
THE COMPUTER does the
work in far less time than before
and can figure out moves far
more easily. The computer also
eliminates the necessity of writ
ing out instructions, and the
printed slips which the computer
prints for each seat are also
easier to understand.

The cards though, still have to
be put up before the games. Bob
Diffly, of Rally Com, is in charge
of this phase. The stunts at half
time are led by Jerry Schaefer,
Rally Com chairman.


STANFORD’S expanding "s", shown climaxing the card stunts at
a recent football game, was the first card stunt ever performed in
a university rooting section.
