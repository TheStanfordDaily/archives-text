### JONNET STEINBAUM 
Oski, the University of Cali
fornia’s “bouncing symbol of
spirit,” will reign supreme today
when Cal observes “Oskie Tues
day” as part of its Big Game fes
tivities.
Throughout the day the uni
dentified member of the Oski
Committee will masquerade as
the California Golden Bear and
gambol about the campus leading
cheers in the major morning lec
ture classes and judging house
decorations in the afternoon. Oski
is further deified in the theme for
those decorations which is, this
year, “Oskie is in the Sunday
Funnies.”
CLIMAXING “Oski Tuesday”
will be the Big Game Concert
which will feature the Kingston
Trio as well as Cal’s Big Game
Queen.
Cal began its final week before
Big Game on a blue note yester
day with its traditional “Blue
Monday.” Head Yell Leader and
Supreme Court Justice of the
Kangaroo Court Roger Morgan,
acclaimed as “Authoritative
Voice of the World.” sentenced
many traitorous students for
sporting the color red. The ar
rests were made by the Califor
nians, a men’s spirit group, and
the jury equitably consisted of
any spectators who happened to

be around. .These Indian sympa
thizers were condemned to bob
for apples in Ludwig’s Fountain
or to don football uniforms in a
given time depending on whether
they were men or women.
