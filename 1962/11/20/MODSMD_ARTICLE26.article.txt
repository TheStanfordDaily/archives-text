Is Craig Morton the Back of the Year in Northern California?
Evidently he is, because the Northern California Football
Writers voted him Ihe honor in the final meeting of the 1962 season
yesterday at the Athens Club of Oakland. Morion narrowly took
honors from such as Stanford’s Ed Cummings, San Jose’s Johnny
Johnson and Santa Clara’s Ron Calcagno.
I didn’t vote for Morton as the Norcal back of the year, for the
following reasons;
Morton played in only four games in 1962. Granted he was
spectacular in those games, as he averaged over 200 yards a game
I passing. Should a man who has played in just four of nine games
he named the top man in his position in the annual race for post
season honors?
MORTON, SPEC TACULAR THOUGH he may bo, has failed to
lead Stanford to a single win in any game he participated. Another
Cal quarterback, Larry Balliett called signals in the lone Cal victory.
Calcagno, Cummings and Johnson all were the most important
individuals in whatever success their teams enjoyed in 1962.
Calgano threw for nine scores and completed 60 per cent of his
passes with Santa Clara. The junior quarterback is a good bet for
at least honorable mention Little All-America honor’s, though missing
! a game with a broken finger, and playing in several others with
i the injury.
26 Tackles Beat MSU
Cummings was a brilliant line backer. His high-poinl was mak
ing 26 tackles against Michigan State in leading a 16-13 Card tri
umph. He has 127 tackles in nine games, almost three times as many
as any other Indian.
Johnson was the leading SJS ball-carrier and was the best
defensive performer for the Spartans.
Why was Morton awarded the honor? One answer might he
that Cal always fares well on the All-Northern California honors
when the meeting in which the selections are made is held in
Oakland. The reason for this is that more reporters from the Oak
land Tribune and other East Bay newspapers are present when the
meeting is in Oakland.
This waiter' unashamedly voted for Ed Cummings. His second
choice was Johnson, and his third was Calgano. Had the purpose
of the meeting been to chose the (op Cal back, he would have voted
lor captain Larry Balliett, top Bear defensive back and one of the
leading passers in the conference. And the man who led Cal to its
only victory.
