## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
In their annual Big Game lunch
eon, held yesterday in Oakland’s
Athens Club, the Northern Cali
fornia Football Writers Associa
tion selected Stanford end Frank
Patitucoi as the Bay Area lineman
of the year. Card linebacker-full
back Ed Cummings was a popular
choice as back of the year, but
finished close behind Cal’s Craig
Morton in the balloting. San Fran
cisco State Coach Vic Rowen was
named coach of the year.
A lot of vei’bal sparring- be
tween Jack Curtice and Marv
Levy occurred at the luncheon,
but very little new was said.
THE ONLY UNKNOWN quan
tity in this year’s Big Game was
the physical condition of Craig
Morton, Cal’s soph passing whiz.
Levy said that whether he plays
or not will probably be something
decided the day of the game. Mor
ton limped off the field with about
two minutes remaining in last Sat
urday’s Cal-Kansas game, his al
ready sore knee apparently re
injured.
Stanford’s Curtice was also con
cerned with Morton’s condition.
He said, “I’m sorry Craig Morton
is hurt. If we’re going to beat
Cal, I want them to have all their
boys there. He’s the kind of fel
low any man would like his
daughter to have.”
CURTICE TABBED Steve Thur
low and Ed Cummings as the men
to watch for Stanford Saturday.

“Thurlow has improved every
game. Cummings we try to save.
He'd he tremendous on offense,
our best blocker.”
Levy underscored what every
one knows about Cal. ‘‘We haven’t
been able to keep people from
scoring. Offense hasn’t been our
problem.” He said that he doesn’t
try to coach Morton on his pass
ing, “I just tell him to keep his
fingers on the laces.”


FRANK PATITUCCI, chosen as the Bay Area Lineman of the Year
yesterday, is Stanford's leading receiver this year with 19 receptions good for 235 yards.

“Thurlow has improved every
game. Cummings we try to save.
He'd he tremendous on offense,
our best blocker.”
Levy underscored what every
one knows about Cal. ‘‘We haven’t
been able to keep people from
scoring. Offense hasn’t been our
problem.” He said that he doesn’t
try to coach Morton on his pass
ing, “I just tell him to keep his
fingers on the laces.”


FRANK PATITUCCI, chosen as the Bay Area Lineman of the Year
yesterday, is Stanford's leading receiver this year with 19 receptions good for 235 yards.
In their annual Big Game lunch
eon, held yesterday in Oakland’s
Athens Club, the Northern Cali
fornia Football Writers Associa
tion selected Stanford end Frank
Patitucoi as the Bay Area lineman
of the year. Card linebacker-full
back Ed Cummings was a popular
choice as back of the year, but
finished close behind Cal’s Craig
Morton in the balloting. San Fran
cisco State Coach Vic Rowen was
named coach of the year.
A lot of vei’bal sparring- be
tween Jack Curtice and Marv
Levy occurred at the luncheon,
but very little new was said.
THE ONLY UNKNOWN quan
tity in this year’s Big Game was
the physical condition of Craig
Morton, Cal’s soph passing whiz.
Levy said that whether he plays
or not will probably be something
decided the day of the game. Mor
ton limped off the field with about
two minutes remaining in last Sat
urday’s Cal-Kansas game, his al
ready sore knee apparently re
injured.
Stanford’s Curtice was also con
cerned with Morton’s condition.
He said, “I’m sorry Craig Morton
is hurt. If we’re going to beat
Cal, I want them to have all their
boys there. He’s the kind of fel
low any man would like his
daughter to have.”
CURTICE TABBED Steve Thur
low and Ed Cummings as the men
to watch for Stanford Saturday.
