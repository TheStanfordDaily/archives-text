The Big Game is often called the northern California’s greatest
social event of the year. It is the stimulus that sets hundreds of
people from as far away as the East Coast in motion packing for
their annual pilgrimage and lark in tlie Bay Area. Upon arrival in
either Palo Alto or Berkeley, they will engage in a weekend of remi
niscing, anecdote recalling, and back slapping more intensive than
at a cocktail party for politicians. San Francisco's Sunday papers
listed no less than 18 functions planned for Cal alums and eight
for Stanford grads to be held at settings ranging from the Palace
Hotel to Forbidden City.

Along with the oldsters, students traditionally have their great
est fling of the academic year at Big Game time. Before the
attraction of a Thanksgiving weekend at home cut into the attend
ance, Big Game overnights were so big lime that Stanford girls
didn’t even have to have locks on their doors. Even as it is now,
alumni affairs in the city must compete for space with the multitude
of student parties and overnights. Other traditional student func
tions include the Ram’s Head Big Game Gaieties, Cal’s Big Game
concert, the Bon Fire, homecoming decorations, and such spirit
raising events as “Red and White Day,” “Blue Monday,” “Axe Day,”
and “Burn the Bear Day.”
Student pranks are also in copious supply and have in the past
produced such whoppers as changing the C on the hill overlooking
Cal’s Stadium into a red S, planting bogus copies of the Daily Cali
fornian on the Berkeley Campus which proclaimed inside in thick
black type. “BEAT CAL,” and hanging “Beat Cal” banners from
the leaning tower of Pisa and the Cal Campanile.
All This and a Football Game, too
But besides all the student and alumni activity connected with
Big Game, Stanford and Cal actually engage in a 60-minute football
contest which is supposedly the center of all the excitement. Big
Game well deserves its status as the central attraction of the week
as it is known for consistently producing thrilling and unusual
football regardless of the records of the two teams through their
first nine games.
You don’t have to go hack very far for an example of this. In
1959, Stanford had won twice and Cal just once going into the Big
Giime. Yet on that day (November 21 i, Stanford’s quarterback, Dick
Norman, put on the greatest individual exhibition of passing ever.
He attempted a record 39 passes, completed 34 a record 88 per cent,
good for a record total gain of 401 yards. 12 of those passes were
caught by All-American end Chris Burford, giving him a record-tying
total for the season of 61 receptions.
With all this glory, however, Stanford still lost, 17-20. Time ran
out as Norman failed to get out of bounds on Cal’s five where he
had gained a first down after guiding the Indians 50 yards in a
futile drive.
That wasn’t the most frustrating drive of the day for the Tribe,
though. The Indians had gained 134 yards in one march and failed to
score; four penalties nullified 65 of those yards and an unsympathe
tic time keeper stranded them on Cal’s nine as the first half ended.
Thirty-six Inches Short of Victory
Big Game the year before had been just as frustrating. Stanford,
trying for its third win of the year against a Bear team that was
headed for the Rose Bowl, scored a touchdown on the end of a 70-
yard drive, with less than two minutes left; that made the score
15-16 for Cal. With everyone in the Indian rooting section holding up
two fingers disdaining a one-point conversion for a tie and calling for
a two-pointer, fullback Skip Face charged inside right end but was
dropped by two Bears one yard short of the end zone and thus one
yard short of a one-point victory.
Cal just missed a last-minute win in 1953 against a heavily
favored Indian team led by All-American quarterback Bobby Gar
rett; the Bears did manage an upset 20-20 tie however. They were
about to try a potential winning field goal from the 30 with 20 sec
onds remaining when they were penalized five yards for bringing
the kicking tee illegally onto the field; the captain of the team was
required to request the tee, which he had forgotten to do in the
excitement. As the field goal attempt, now kicked from the 35, fell
short, the Bay Area audience watching on local television thought
they were seeing some monstrous new defensive weapon for Stan
ford; it was 6-2 All-American end Sam Morley mounted on the
shoulders of 6-4 end John Steinberg and positioned in front of the
goal posts to block the kick if necessary.
In 1947, a winless Indian team looked like it was going to
achieve the upset of the Big Game series. Cal was a 10-1 favorite that
day with a 71 record, but Stanford led 18-14 with just three minutes
left; the Tribe had overcome Bear leads of 0-6 and 6-14. But an 80-
yard touchdown pass at that point from All-American Jackie Jensen
to Paul Keckley brought the Axe hack to Berkeley and left Stan
ford fans high and dry.
Stanford’s Greatest Comeback
Last minute flurries in the Big Game haven't always been so
unkind to Stanford. In 1924, the first year of Pop Warner’s T-forma
tion, underdog Stanford trailed by 6-20 with five minutes left. But
an 18-yard TD pass from Ed Walker to All-American end Ted Ship
key plus Murray Cuddeback’s PAT brought Stanford to within
seven points. However, after the Indians held, Cal punted them back
to their 13-yard line. Nevertheless, they drove up the field, and from
Cal’s 20, Walker threw another scoring pass, to Cuddeback, who a
moment later kicked the game-tying point. Although it wasn’t a
Stanford win, for those who remember it, this 20-20 tie is most
often referred to as Stanford’s greatest athletic comeback.
Student Football Manager Herbert Hoover
Even the first game in the series, the Big Game of 1892, had
some striking features. It was played in San Francisco’s baseball
grounds, a 15,000-seat stadium. However, under the direction of stu
dent football manager Herbert Hoover, only 10,000 tickets were
printed: this was rather disturbing since 20.000 people showed up
for the game.
“We had no such supply of tickets,” recounts Hoover, in Pete
Grothe’s Great Moments in Stanford Sports. “So we set up an alley
of our college boys from the box office to the gates and sold tickets
for cash—the purchasers being carefully watched so that no out
siders crowded in without having first paid their respects to the
box offices. At that time few bills were in use in California. We
dealth in silver and gold. The cash piled up behind our entrance
selling boys to the extent that it spilled on the floors; we had to
rent a wash-boiler and a dishpan from nearby householders for the
price of a free ticket.

“And while these difficulties were solved, the captains of the
two teams turned up, demanding to know where was the football. We
had overlooked that detail and had to delay the game for a half-hour
while we sent down-town for two pigskins.”
After all the trama was resolved, Stanford won the first Big
Game 14-10, and a healthy $30,000 was raked in.
