# CAL VICTORIOUS ONLY ONCE
## Feeble Bear Defense May Offset Craig Morton's Passing Threat 
### BOB SCHADER 
A glance at the statistics tells
the main story of the not-so-Gold
en Bears this season. They have
held only one opponent, unvaunt
ed San Jose Slate, to fewer than
21 points. The Spartans managed
only eight.
Their human interest theme is
more entertaining. It centers
around sophomore star Craig Mor
ton, a 6-4, 210-pound quarterback
who, in his first varsity contest
three weeks ago against Pqnn
Stale, re-established the Califor
nia single game individual total
offense mark at 285 yards.

Hurt in an early season practice,
Morton was a spectator to injuries
which put the top California quar
terback, Randy Gold, out for the
season and left alternate signal
caller Captain Larry Balliett un
able to perform up to par.
MORTON’S supporting cast on
offense is largely made up of his
classmates. 225 pound fullback
Mike Epstein and halfbacks Jim
Blakeney and Tom Blanchfield
are consistent ground gainers and
go o d receivers. Fullback Tom
Lutes and ends Ron Mazik, and
Mike Gridley are other sopho
mores who have put in worthy if
uncinema tic performances.
Among the upperclassmen who
managed to crack the starting
lineup, junior halfback Alan Nel
son, the team’s leading rusher and
senior end Bill Turner, the top
pass receiver are most accom
plished. Turner has been very
close statistically to AAWU pace
setter Hugh Campbell all season,
having caught 36 passes so far.
Senior- end Ron Vaughn has been
th e second leading receiver in
Cal’s aerially inclined offense.
The Bears’ line, slightly less
permeable tharr a box of Rice Kris
pies, has yielded to rushing of
fenses from all parts of the na
tion (Kansas, Washington, Duke,
Penn State and others less worthy
of mention) with equal alacrity.
Only the gallant Trojans of USC
disregarded the open door to Cali
fornia pay dirt, restraining them
selves to 128 yards rushing while
flying in for 329 yards and three
touchdowns.

Roger Stull ;mrt John Erby, the
line, too, is largely bouyed by
sophomores. Dave Urrea, Dennis
Abreu and Ron Calegari, young
interior linemen averaging 205
pounds, have been the defensive
standouts this season. Their ef
fectiveness has undoubtedly been
hampered by inexperience and
lack of reserve support. Balliel
has been outstanding as a defen
sive back.

Lack of defense has hurl Cal
from the first, and it doesn’t ap
pear to be getting stronger. This
is Coach Levy’s biggest worry,
and Stanford's greatest hope in
this week's contest. Offensively,
the Bears are potent and improv
ing. In Morton they have an of
fensive threat of the first order.
He has thrown for over 180 yards
per game with a .565 completion
average in his four performances.
Despite Cal’s lack of great speed,
Morion's accurate passing to num
erous receivers represents an ex
plosive threat not easily defensed.
The California eleven is spirited
and has consistently come back
to close the gap in what appeared
to be lost causes. Their losses to
Pittsburgh (26-24) and Penn State
123-21) were particularly disap
pointing. It must he remembered
also that California has played
one of the toughest intersectional
schedules in the nation while
amassing its disheartening record.


CAL END Ron Vaughn, the Bear's
third leading receiver is probably
going to be one of Craig Morton's
likely targets in Saturday's Big
Game. Vaughn has caught 16
passes for 222 yards and has
scored two touchdowns.

from the first, and it doesn’t ap
pear to be getting stronger. This
is Coach Levy’s biggest worry,
and Stanford's greatest hope in
this week's contest. Offensively,
the Bears are potent and improv
ing. In Morton they have an of
fensive threat of the first order.
He has thrown for over 180 yards
per game with a .565 completion
average in his four performances.
Despite Cal’s lack of great speed,
Morion's accurate passing to num
erous receivers represents an ex
plosive threat not easily defensed.
The California eleven is spirited
and has consistently come back
to close the gap in what appeared
to be lost causes. Their losses to
Pittsburgh (26-24) and Penn State
123-21) were particularly disap
pointing. It must he remembered
also that California has played
one of the toughest intersectional
schedules in the nation while
amassing its disheartening record.


CAL END Ron Vaughn, the Bear's
third leading receiver is probably
going to be one of Craig Morton's
likely targets in Saturday's Big
Game. Vaughn has caught 16
passes for 222 yards and has
scored two touchdowns.
