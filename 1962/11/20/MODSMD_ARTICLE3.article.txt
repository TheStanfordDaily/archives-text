## 
### NORMAN REITZ 
“We took medicine out of the ■
market place,” said Dr. D. Stark
Murray, a consultant to the Brit
ish National Health Service, in 1
his description of the Service. j
Murray was the principal
speaker presented hy the Poli i
Union in its discussion last night j
on “Medical Services: Govern-1
ment Programs and Private En
terprise.” Three American doc ]
tors also participated in the pro-j
gram: Dr. Philip Lee and Richard ;
Wilbur of the Palo Alto Medical!
Clinic and Dr. Paul O’Rourke of |
Santa Rosa.
THK NATIONAL Health Serv
ice, Murray said, has operated for !
fourteen years. Its formation, he
said, wasn’t a radical change in j
British medicine; it was the con-j
summation of a tradition estab- j
lished by the National Health In
su ranee, in effect since 1911.1
Murray cited a recent poll in
which nine out of ten who use the j
Service were satisfied with its
program of comprehensive medi
cal service.
Although medical service in;
the United States takes almost [
twice the percentage of the gross j
national product as it does in
Britain, the quality of service is
comparable, Murray said. The j
number of medical students in!
Britain and the efficiency of the |
Service are all rising, he added, j
Specialists are provided by the '
Service but it shies away from j
over-specialization, Murray said, i
