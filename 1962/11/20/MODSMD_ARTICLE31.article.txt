# Math Study Grant Awarded by NSF

### 
The School Mathematics Study
Group (SMSGI a project aimed
at remodeling the mathematics
curriculum of grammar and high
schools, was awarded $1,377,000
by the National Science Founda
tion (NSF) to continue its work,
it w'as announced yesterday.
Sponsored by the School of Ed
ucation and under Prof. Edward
G. Begle, SMSG’s “new mathe
matics” stresses the understand
ing of mathematical concepts
rathei- than rote learning of me
chanical solutions to problems.
New sample textbooks have
been completed for the fourth
through twelfth grades. SMSG
is now considering instruction on
tire kindergarten through third
grade level, high school calculus,
and a combined mathematics and
physics course for ninth graders.
One of SMSG’s biggest prob
lems, Begel said, is instructing
teachers in the use of the new cur
riculum. A series of instructional
films being prepared under anoth
er NSF grant may remedy the
solution.
A five-year follow-up analysis
of SMSG is being made to dis
cover how well the new curricu
lum works, explained Begle. One
year studies have shown SMSG
students to have an edge over stu
dents taught by other methods.
All te.Js developed by SMSG
are being translated into Spanish,
mainly for use in Puerto Rico.
