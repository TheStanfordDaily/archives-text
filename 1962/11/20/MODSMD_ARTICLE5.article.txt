# Sanford Declares College Education Must Stress Individual Development
## 
### CHRIS CHRISMAN 
“The development of the indi
vidual is the most essential ob
jective of higher education,” de
clared Psychology Professor R.
Nevitt Sanford in his talk yester
day afternoon in Tresidder.
Sanford, who recently publish
ed a major study of the American
college, called for more studies
to help achieve this goal of mak
ing students more complex and
more integrated.
Sanford, denying that all char
acter changes occur in childhood,
proposed that all aspects of the
college environment be studied to
see what promotes change and
development in the individual.
The purpose of development, he
said, is to make one ‘‘maximally
free,” and the higher the devel
opment the freer the individual.

I In his talk Sanford drew atten-
I tion to two problems common to
“underdeveloped” students in uni
versities. The first involved stu
dents who are afraid to think for
j fear that they will be changed by
their college experience, and will
| upset their parents’ expectations.
The second problem concerned
' students who come to college

with authoritarian personalities
and think of things in terms of
stereotypes and rigid categories.
The most important instrument
in meeting these problems, San
ford felt, is the impact of the pro
fessor. The influence of friend
ship groups and people who re
place traditional influences like
parents, however, must not be
overlooked, he declared.
Sanford said in conclusion that
character development was more
Important than the learning of
skills because of the difficulty of
applying college learned skills di
rectly to jobs.
Furthermore, he noted, the de
velopment the student undergoes
in college stays with him after he
has left the university.
