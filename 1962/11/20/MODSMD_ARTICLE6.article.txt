### 
Students at the University of
Michigan voted in the largest
election turnout in eight years to
remain in the National Student
Association (NSA). The final
tally i-evealod a close vote of
3,667 in favor and 3,483 opposed.

lowa, Northwestern and Ohio
State have repudiated their mem
bership in NSA. If Michigan re
signed. the Joss of another Big
Ten school would force NSA to
make some changes, said Michi
gan Daily editor Michael Olinick,
FRED GOFF, Stanford NSA
coordinator, said that he doubted
the loss of Michigan would have
had this effect.

An editorial in the Harvard
Crimson agreed that the “liberal”
stands taken by NSA do not rep
resent the American Student
community, but said that this is
‘‘only because most of the college
students in this country are obli
vious to the political issues which
USNSA considers important.”

NSA’S ATTITUDES are ‘‘liber
al because the most vocal stu
dents- those who tend to take a
stand are often liberal.” said
Goff. Conservatives were well
represented this summer, and
many reforms were passed, he
continued. One, the “disclaimer
amendment,” slates that a

school’s membership floes not ne
cessarily imply support of any
given resolution.
One of NSA’s gi'ealcst values
tionships Goff stated. “I think
anyone who attended the Helsin
ki Festival last summer will rec
ognize this value and see the ne
cessity for the NSA’s work in this
area.” he added.

Political education is the major
function of NSA, the Harvard edi
torial said, not parroting student
opinion or lobbying for student
interests.
