# Unanimous Vote of Members Rejects National Race Clause
## 
### DEAN SAVAGE Contributing Editor 
Sigma Nn fraternity voted unanimously late last night to
separate itself from the Sigma Nu national, President Tom Grey
reported. The decision, the culmination of more than two years
of investigation and thought, was reached after the majority of
members became convinced there was no hope of influencing
the national to alter the clauses in the national constitution and
by-laws which forbid accepting Negroes or Orientals as mem
bers, Grey said.

According to the four-part mu-'
tion, the Beta Chi chapter of Sig
ma Nu will redesignate itself the
Beta Chi fraternity, petition the
University to recognize the Beta
Chi fraternity as the legal suc
cessor organization to the Beta
Chi chapter of Sigma Nu, peti
tion the Beta Chi Building Cor
poration (the group made up of
old Stanford Sigma Nus which
own the house) to continue in
their capacity as trustees of Beta
Chi, and finally, to request that
the Sigma Nu national withdraw
the charter of the Beta Chi chap
ter.
IN A LETTER sent to all Sig
ma Nu alumni on November 3,
Grey outlined the history of the
problem and asked for alumni
opinion. Starting with the “en
masse” pledge class of 1960, the
discriminatory clauses had pro
voked discussion and caused con
siderable dissatisfaction among
members.
However, the majority thought
that the best method of changing
the situation was to work from
within and influence the national
to revoke the clauses.
Last spring quarter the situa
tion received public attention
when Professor of English David
Levin, in a letter to the house,
refused an invitation to a Sigma
Nu reception on the grounds that
his belief in fraternity impelled
him “to reject invitations from
social groups that deny member
ship to people of certain racial
or religious origin.”
At that time Grey stated that
the group was planning to try to
change the clauses at the nation
al convention to be held in the
summer at Pittsburgh.
HE ALSO added that it was un
true that the fraternity practiced
discrimination; the case was that
the house had never been faced
with the choice of having tg ac
sept or reject a Negro or Orien
tal. Hajime Ohta. ASSU Foreign
Scholar from Japan, was living
in the house at the time and was
extremely well-regarded.
Through last spring and sum
mer, most members favored a
“wait and see” policy, temporar
ily accepting the national’s poli
cy while working to change it.
A minority favored immediate
disaffiliation. The minority posi
tion was strengthened by a na
tional requirement that all ac
tives sign a Statement of Princi
ple which contained a justifica
tion for the fraternity’s racial
policies.
All active members of Sigma
Nu signed the pledge, some only
under pressure from house offi
cers. The officers’ feeling was
that the chapter would not be
able to accomplish anything at
the national convention if the
chapter could be accused of non
compliance with national regula
tions.

j tion to amend membership quali
i fications to exclude any mention
lof race was defeated 215-76. A

THIS FALL, the letter continu
j ed, members realized that there
j was no hope of changing national
! policy or even moving gradually
!in this direction and the main
argument for remaining with the
national collapsed.
In addition to this fundamental
disagreement, Grey noted two
other relevant factors: first, that
it was becoming increasingly dif
ficult to find freshmen who want
j ed to join a group which discrimi
nated on racial grounds, and sec
ond, that the prestige accompany
ing identification with the nation
al no longer seemed to be a deci
sive asset.
Stanford University stands
committed behind the Sigma Nu
position. In a resolution passed
in 1957 the Board of Trustees

(lo living group discrimination in

to cooperate with any group
which worked to eliminate such
discrimination.
In March, 1960, the Stanford
chapter of Alpha Tau Omega had
its national charter revoked for
pledging four Jewish students.
At that time President J. E. Wal
lace Sterling stated that the Uni
versity would “give the chapter
j every possible encouragement in
j its plans to remain active as a
local.”
I “WE ARE proud of the way
the Stanford students of the ATO
chapter have defended their prin
ciples in a trying situation,” he
added. The University is expected
to comment on the Sigma Nu ac
tion today.
i With the advent of Beta Chi,
! the number of explicitly discrim
inatory Stanford fraternities is

Sigma Nn fraternity voted unanimously late last night to
separate itself from the Sigma Nu national, President Tom Grey
reported. The decision, the culmination of more than two years
of investigation and thought, was reached after the majority of
members became convinced there was no hope of influencing
the national to alter the clauses in the national constitution and
by-laws which forbid accepting Negroes or Orientals as mem
bers, Grey said.

According to the four-part mu-'
tion, the Beta Chi chapter of Sig
ma Nu will redesignate itself the
Beta Chi fraternity, petition the
University to recognize the Beta
Chi fraternity as the legal suc
cessor organization to the Beta
Chi chapter of Sigma Nu, peti
tion the Beta Chi Building Cor
poration (the group made up of
old Stanford Sigma Nus which
own the house) to continue in
their capacity as trustees of Beta
Chi, and finally, to request that
the Sigma Nu national withdraw
the charter of the Beta Chi chap
ter.
IN A LETTER sent to all Sig
ma Nu alumni on November 3,
Grey outlined the history of the
problem and asked for alumni
opinion. Starting with the “en
masse” pledge class of 1960, the
discriminatory clauses had pro
voked discussion and caused con
siderable dissatisfaction among
members.
However, the majority thought
that the best method of changing
the situation was to work from
within and influence the national
to revoke the clauses.
Last spring quarter the situa
tion received public attention
when Professor of English David
Levin, in a letter to the house,
refused an invitation to a Sigma
Nu reception on the grounds that
his belief in fraternity impelled
him “to reject invitations from
social groups that deny member
ship to people of certain racial
or religious origin.”
At that time Grey stated that
the group was planning to try to
change the clauses at the nation
al convention to be held in the
summer at Pittsburgh.
HE ALSO added that it was un
true that the fraternity practiced
discrimination; the case was that
the house had never been faced
with the choice of having tg ac
sept or reject a Negro or Orien
tal. Hajime Ohta. ASSU Foreign
Scholar from Japan, was living
in the house at the time and was
extremely well-regarded.
Through last spring and sum
mer, most members favored a
“wait and see” policy, temporar
ily accepting the national’s poli
cy while working to change it.
A minority favored immediate
disaffiliation. The minority posi
tion was strengthened by a na
tional requirement that all ac
tives sign a Statement of Princi
ple which contained a justifica
tion for the fraternity’s racial
policies.
All active members of Sigma
Nu signed the pledge, some only
under pressure from house offi
cers. The officers’ feeling was
that the chapter would not be
able to accomplish anything at
the national convention if the
chapter could be accused of non
compliance with national regula
tions.

In March, 1960, the Stanford

Sigma Nn fraternity voted unanimously late last night to
separate itself from the Sigma Nu national, President Tom Grey
reported. The decision, the culmination of more than two years
of investigation and thought, was reached after the majority of
members became convinced there was no hope of influencing
the national to alter the clauses in the national constitution and
by-laws which forbid accepting Negroes or Orientals as mem
bers, Grey said.

According to the four-part mu-'
tion, the Beta Chi chapter of Sig
ma Nu will redesignate itself the
Beta Chi fraternity, petition the
University to recognize the Beta
Chi fraternity as the legal suc
cessor organization to the Beta
Chi chapter of Sigma Nu, peti
tion the Beta Chi Building Cor
poration (the group made up of
old Stanford Sigma Nus which
own the house) to continue in
their capacity as trustees of Beta
Chi, and finally, to request that
the Sigma Nu national withdraw
the charter of the Beta Chi chap
ter.
IN A LETTER sent to all Sig
ma Nu alumni on November 3,
Grey outlined the history of the
problem and asked for alumni
opinion. Starting with the “en
masse” pledge class of 1960, the
discriminatory clauses had pro
voked discussion and caused con
siderable dissatisfaction among
members.
However, the majority thought
that the best method of changing
the situation was to work from
within and influence the national
to revoke the clauses.
Last spring quarter the situa
tion received public attention
when Professor of English David
Levin, in a letter to the house,
refused an invitation to a Sigma
Nu reception on the grounds that
his belief in fraternity impelled
him “to reject invitations from
social groups that deny member
ship to people of certain racial
or religious origin.”
At that time Grey stated that
the group was planning to try to
change the clauses at the nation
al convention to be held in the
summer at Pittsburgh.
HE ALSO added that it was un
true that the fraternity practiced
discrimination; the case was that
the house had never been faced
with the choice of having tg ac
sept or reject a Negro or Orien
tal. Hajime Ohta. ASSU Foreign
Scholar from Japan, was living
in the house at the time and was
extremely well-regarded.
Through last spring and sum
mer, most members favored a
“wait and see” policy, temporar
ily accepting the national’s poli
cy while working to change it.
A minority favored immediate
disaffiliation. The minority posi
tion was strengthened by a na
tional requirement that all ac
tives sign a Statement of Princi
ple which contained a justifica
tion for the fraternity’s racial
policies.
All active members of Sigma
Nu signed the pledge, some only
under pressure from house offi
