HOWARD HUGHES DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS. If you are
interested in studies leading to a doctor’s degree in engineering or
physics, you are invited to apply for one of the several new awards
in 1963 on the Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowship Program.
This unique program offers the doctoral candidate the optimum
combination of high-level study at an outstanding institution plus
practical industrial experience in the Hughes laboratories.
Each Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowship usually provides about
$B,OOO annually. Of this amount approximately $l,BOO is for tuition,
thesis and research expenses, other academic fees and books. The
remainder is composed of salary earned by the fellow and a stipend.
Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowships are open to outstanding stu
dents. A master’s degree, or equivalent graduate work, is essential
before beginning the Fellowship Program.
HUGHES MASTERS FELLOWSHIPS. The Hughes Masters
Fellowship Program offers unusual opportunities for education lead
ing to a master’s degree . . . and, in addition, provides each fellow
with practical experience in the professional field of his choice.
New awards will be made in 1963 to qualified applicants possessing
a bachelor’s degree in engineering or physics.
The great majority of the award winners will be assigned to the
WORK STUDY PROGRAM and will attend a university sufficiently
near a facility of the Hughes Aircraft Company to permit them to
obtain practical experience in a professional field of their choice,
by working at the company at least half time. Those associated
with a Southern California facility usually attend the University of
Southern California or the University of California, Los Angeles. An
appropriate stipend will be awarded.
A small, highly selected group will be offered a FULL-STUDY
PROGRAM. Participants in this program will receive fellowships that
permit them to attend an outstanding university on a full-time basis
during the regular academic year with a substantial stipend.
After completion of the Master's Program, fellows are eligible to
apply for HUGHES STAFF DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS.
For both programs, typical areas of research and development to
which fellows may be assigned while working for Hughes include:
weapons control systems, guidance and control systems, infrared
search and track systems, advanced propulsion systems . . . para
metric amplifiers, masers, lasers, microwave tubes and devices,
electron-tube and solid-state displays, semiconductor materials,
digital computers, antenna arrays, aerospace vehicles and trajec
tories . . . plasma electronics; solid-state, atomic, nuclear and aero
space physics; propagation, mechanics of structures, chemistry
and metallurgy... systems design and analysis, human factors and
analysis, network analysis and synthesis . . . microminiaturization,
communications, data processing and digital computers, informa
tion theory, simulation.
The classified nature of work at Hughes makes American citizenship
and eligibility for security clearance a requirement.
Closing date for applications: February 1, 1963
