### DICAN SAVAGE Contributing Editor 
In a statement issued yester
day, University President J, E.
Wallace Sterling expressed sup
port for the decision by Sigma
Nu actives to withdraw from
their national organization and
become a local fraternity, Beta
Chi.

The president cited the reso
lution passed in 19.17 hy the
Board of Trustees committing
the University to “work actively”
with student groups opposing ra
cial and religious clauses and
practices.
“TWO ELEMENTS seem note
worthy in the action taken Mon
day night by the Stanford chap
ter of Sigma Nu,” Sterling said.
“First, (lie action was initiated by
the actives themselves and not
by the University. Second, the ac
tion was taken without reference
to any particular individual stu
dent.” The action is in keeping
with long-standing University
policy, he concluded.
The Stanford chapter is be
lieved to be the second local
(after Wesleyan in Connecticut!
to withdraw from Sigma Nu be
cause of the bias clauses.

At the old Sigma Nu house yes
terday, the Beta Chi sign went
up and members began to adjust
to the idea of living without tra
dition. There was been no reac
tion as yet from either the na
tional or the Beta Chi Building
Corporation, which owns the
house, president Tom Grey re
ported.
KAPPA ALPHA president Paul
Chester was reluctant to com
ment further on the KA program
to eliminate discrimination, even
to the point of refusing to speci
fy which groups the fraternity’s
bias clauses include. It is report
ed that Jews, as well as Negroes
and Orientals, and non-Christians

as a group, are discriminated
against.
The University, while opposed
‘o racial and religious discrimi
nation in any form, h •, sot no
time limit on correction
