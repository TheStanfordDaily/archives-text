# Plot Sparks Big Game Gaieties
## 
### LOU PADULO 
Sporting the first “plot” in
fifty years and the best show in
the past three, Rams Head’s an
nual Big Game Gaieties opened
last night in Memorial Auditori
um for a four-night run.
The extravaganza opens with
Wilbur Hall, (an unlikely name
for a Gaieties hero) bidding a sad
farewell to his lowa farm and
lowa grandmother to catch the
Southern Pacific for Stanford.
Willie meets Janice at the S.P.
i Station when their luggage gets
1 mixed up and sheepishly agree to
j see each other again. We see
.them singing in the dormitories;
j singing at the convocation; sing
ing in phone booths, campus
j “hangouts’ and oven in their
bathrooms.
NOT COUNTING the prologue,
some sixteen scenes are spread
over two acts. In the course of
the twenty-four musical produc
tions we witness the corruption
of Wilbur and Janice by two de
lightful upperclass lechers, an
: earthy campus queen. Random
Choice, and Bart Rain, a studly
Greek jock. Well meaning room
males get Wilbur and Janice back
together in time for the Big
Game Overnight.
Several of the 21 musical pro
ductions merit special comment.
“The March of the Professors,”
while pure slapstick, will be well
received. A sympathetic portray
el of “The Dean” by Myles Win
bigler and a wonderful “profes
sor of religion” made up for a
I shoddy spoof of the president,
j The song, “The President’s Ser
| mon,” was well done, and very
i much like Gilbert and Sullivan.
WILL AND HIS buddies do
“Outta My Way World” much
i better than Janice and her corri
-1 dor males do "Dollies' Devices."

Only boot-polishing Charlotte
Low, playing a lovable dwarf,
stands out in the girls’ number.
Bart Bain and his Alpha Sigma
Sigma fraternity brothers steal
top honors for their rendition of

‘‘The Alpha Sigma Sigma Guys,”
a well-written, well-sung spoof of
life among the brothers.
AT THE END, as if remember
ing the Big Game part of the
title, the nicely done “Card Bal
let” symbolically portrays the
abject conquest of a gold dancer
by a red one. While not exactly
a Bergman touch, it should mysti
fy a goodly number in an audi
ence that takes thirty seconds to
get the Alpha Sigma Sigma pun.
Peter Hayek as Bart Bain anti
Patty Heldfons as Random
Choice sang consistently well and
seemed more poised in their roles
than did the nicely sung but
stiffly played “Wilbur” of Rich
ard Grant. Lizz Kuhn was a
tempting Janice but sporadic in
her singing, depending quite
heavily on where she stood on
stage for her effectiveness.
Jim Piersal, Janet Benson and
A1 Novikoff were good in the
■ “Ballet” but most of the other
j dancing was mediocre, except for
( the all male numbers, which were
j horrible.
AS IN MOST STUDENT musi
; cals there is a great deal of awk
| wardness. Too often we see a
! panting, wheezing mob bellowing
J in unison only to suddenly hush
| and stand woodenly by to await
: a solo or dance. Also, the orches
| tra tends to get carried away and
j drown out the singers, particular
-1 ly Miss Kuhn.

Much of the dialogue is good
college parody but too much of
the obvious and the slapstick still
remain. Lighting is good, sets and
staging are excellent although
the elaborate sets cause a few un
comfortable delays.
