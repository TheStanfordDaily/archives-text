After two years of fruitless debate and bickering with the
Sigma Nu national, the University’s Beta Chi chapter has with
drawn from the national and has re-formed as Beta Chi. By leaving
Sigma Nu, the Beta Chi’s have resolved a dilemma that still
plagues numerous fraternities throughout the country. Beta Chi
no longer finds itself in the position of deploring discrimination
privately while upholding it tacitly by accepting the clause in the
national that prohibits membership to certain minorities.
Although it would be naive and inaccurate to think that all the
former members ol Sigma Nu wanted to leave the national, the
fact is that they all closed ranks at the end of their meeting and
declared their unanimity for the policy established by more than
a two-thirds vote. There can be no doubt that the University com
munity supports Beta Chi for its courageous stand against the
national discriminatory clause of Sigma Nu.
