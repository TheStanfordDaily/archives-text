Now that the Beta Chi chapter of Sigma Nu has repudiated its
national discriminatory clause, only Kappa Alpha retains a clause
that explicitly forbids membership to minorities. Since Kappa
Alpha refuses to disclose against whom their bias clause discrimi
nates, it is difficult to determine definitively what minorities are
excluded from membership.
According to Kappa Alpha President, Paul Chester, his frater
nity has been working with the national since 1957 on away to
solve the clause problem. By the end of 1964 Mr. Chester hopes
that a solution will have been found since Stanford’s chapter plans
to remain within the national.
Considering the futility of the Sigma Nil’s battle to eliminate
the clause by working within the national, it is not overly pessi
mistic to predict failure for the KA’s, a fraternity whose Southern
tics are especially strong. Instead of seceding from the campus
as they do annually, they might be well advised to secede from
their national.
