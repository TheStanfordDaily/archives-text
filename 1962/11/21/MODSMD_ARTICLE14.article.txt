# MUSICAL REVIEW
## Li'l Abner' Makes up for Imprecision With Sheer Energy, Enthusiasm 
### ROSALIND GREENE 
(Editor’s note: “Li’l Abner” is
an original musical comedy by
Norman Panama and Melvin
Frank presented by the Menlo
Players Guild at the Burgess The
atre, Menlo Park.)
An overture which seems like
fifteen minutes in duration after
only five have passed has some
thing wrong with it. For one
thing it’s too long; for another
the director probably should have
cut it out entirely unless he found
a halfway inspired pianist with
some decent arrangements. At
any rate the purpose of an over
ture is to establish the tone of the
show, not to give the audience a
couple of extra minutes of con
versation before the curtain goes
up.
The Menlo Players Guild pro
duction of “Li’l Abner” unfortu
nately fell into the usual pitfalls
of amateur presentations. It is an
ambitious production, but beset
with many problems.
THE STAGING often seems
helter-skelter, or just plain acci
dental, the scenes lack focus in
many instances and don’t seem
to go anywhere: the incidents
rather than being a consequence
of each other, appear as almost
unrelated events, and the actors
too, seem to move about in their
own little spotlight until they
happen to bump into a fellow
player, or are forced to feed him
a line. For an actor to continue
speaking to a character after that
character has gone off stage, is
not even a matter of poor acting
technique; it’s a matter of com
mon sense. It’s just not logical to
talk to someone who isn’t there.
It makes an audience wonder,
and while they’re wondering they

will probably miss the next bit
of stage business, to which the
last five bits of stage business
have been building.
In spite of what anyone might
think to the contrary, musical
productions do require some sem
blance of acting technique; it is
not simply a matter of saying the
the words loudly until you get to
the next song. Reciting is no
longer the vogue in the theatre,
neither is the technique of “show
ing an audience,” i.e„ to show I
am put out I stamp my left foot
and raise my downstage hand to
its respective hip.
A WHOLE book was written
on this style of acting, but it
went out with the Restoration,
and long before even Sir Henry
Irving trod the boards. With such
distractions it is inevitable that
the production as a whole must
suffer and become something of
an uncomfortable affair.
But, perhaps to be overly criti
cal is to belabor the point. What
this production lacked in preci
sion, it made up for in sheer en
ergy and enthusiasm. Any of us
who have an appreciation for A1
Capp’s talents will enjoy the re
incarnation of Dogpatch and all
its yokels, along with such musi
cal numbers as “Jubilation T.
Cornpone,” and the romantic bal
lad of the show, “Namely You.”
The physical aspects of the pro
duction, the sets and costumes,
were admirable and very color
ful. Probably the costuming, su
pervised by Beverly Goettleman,
did as much to establish the char
acterizations as anything. If only
a little more care were taken the
fun of the show might have been
doubled, for both actors and au
dience.
