# BOOK REVIEW
## Fail-Safe' Unrealistic Melodramatic Although Its Warning Painfully Clear 
### MARGARET HARDING Associate Editor 
“Fail-Safe," by Eugene Burdick
and Harvey Wheeler, McGraw-
Hill Book Company, Inc., 284 pp.,
$4.95.

“Fail-Safe” is a fascinating and
horrifying account of the possi
bilities and consequences of an
accidental nuclear war.
Eugene Burdick, the co author
of the controversial best-seller
“The Ugly American,” and Har
vey Wheeler have struck a blow
in this gripping novel at the
stand of the proponents of a de
terrent nuclear force. Few strong
er arguments for complete dis
armament have ever been writ
ten, for this book has not only a
logical but an emotional impact
that is likely to leave the reader
shaking and somewhat shell
shocked after he has completed
reading it and begins to under
stand its import.
The failure of one small com
ponent in one small machine,
combined with human error and
some ironical circumstances are
enough to send the United States
to the brink of war where it
teeters precariously and then
falls . . . not into an unlimited
nuclear holocaust but into an in
credible, unthinkable yet some
how logical compromise between
surrender and an all-out war.

The United States, as depicted
in the book, has built up an elab
orate defense against the eventu
ality of an accidental push of
that infamous and fatal button
that may start World War HI.
They have developed a system
known as “Fail-Safe” which the
experts claim is infallible. A com
bination of mechanical and hu
man checks and balance is sup
posed to make it impossible for
the system to fail. But it can fail.
And it does.

“Fail-Safe” is poorly written.
The writing is sensational, rob
bing the book of some of Its im
pact by being melodramatic at
points where it would have been
better to be subtle. The story is
told from the point of first one
unbelievable character and then
another. The dialogue ranges

from being unrealistic to being
more unrealistic, culminating in
an absurd conversation between
the President of the United
States and Premier Khrushchev
from their respective bombshel
ters in which they sound as if
they are discussing something of
no more importance than an in
tramural football game.
“ ‘What luck have you had in
your attacks on our bombers?’
the President asked.
“‘Luck? No luck at all,’ Khru
shchev said. 'But earned results,
yes. We have gotten 860 of our
supersonic fighters vectored in
on the hundreds of targets which
suddenly appeared on our radar
scope. That, Mr. President, was
a tender moment.’ ”
" ‘Holy Jesus,’ the words slip
ped from the President’s mouth
. . . ‘We’ve both put too damn
much trust in the system.’ ’’
In spite of its literary draw
backs, however the authors’ mes
sage is painfully clear. Either the
United States must halt their de
fense buildup and nuclear stock
piling or they will endanger the
very existence of the human race.

the system to fail. But it can fail.
And it does.

“Fail-Safe” is poorly written.
The writing is sensational, rob
bing the book of some of Its im
pact by being melodramatic at
points where it would have been
better to be subtle. The story is
told from the point of first one
unbelievable character and then
another. The dialogue ranges

from being unrealistic to being
more unrealistic, culminating in
an absurd conversation between
the President of the United
States and Premier Khrushchev
from their respective bombshel
ters in which they sound as if
they are discussing something of
no more importance than an in
tramural football game.
“ ‘What luck have you had in
your attacks on our bombers?’
the President asked.
“‘Luck? No luck at all,’ Khru
shchev said. 'But earned results,
yes. We have gotten 860 of our
supersonic fighters vectored in
on the hundreds of targets which
suddenly appeared on our radar
scope. That, Mr. President, was
a tender moment.’ ”
" ‘Holy Jesus,’ the words slip
ped from the President’s mouth
. . . ‘We’ve both put too damn
much trust in the system.’ ’’
In spite of its literary draw
backs, however the authors’ mes
sage is painfully clear. Either the
United States must halt their de
fense buildup and nuclear stock
piling or they will endanger the
very existence of the human race.

“Fail-Safe” is a fascinating and
horrifying account of the possi
bilities and consequences of an
accidental nuclear war.
Eugene Burdick, the co author
of the controversial best-seller
“The Ugly American,” and Har
vey Wheeler have struck a blow
in this gripping novel at the
stand of the proponents of a de
terrent nuclear force. Few strong
er arguments for complete dis
armament have ever been writ
ten, for this book has not only a
logical but an emotional impact
that is likely to leave the reader
shaking and somewhat shell
shocked after he has completed
reading it and begins to under
stand its import.
The failure of one small com
ponent in one small machine,
combined with human error and
some ironical circumstances are
enough to send the United States
to the brink of war where it
teeters precariously and then
falls . . . not into an unlimited
nuclear holocaust but into an in
credible, unthinkable yet some
how logical compromise between
surrender and an all-out war.

The United States, as depicted
in the book, has built up an elab
orate defense against the eventu
ality of an accidental push of
that infamous and fatal button
that may start World War HI.
They have developed a system
known as “Fail-Safe” which the
experts claim is infallible. A com
bination of mechanical and hu
man checks and balance is sup
posed to make it impossible for
the system to fail. But it can fail.
And it does.
