Kditor, The Daily:
Last week Stanford paid ap
proximately $lOOO to send its soc
cer team to St, Louis to compete
in the National Collegiate Ama
teur Association playoffs, the
team was badly beaten in the
first round by St. Louis Universi
ty, 9-3. As sophomores on the
soccer team we would like to ex
press our gratitude for this op
portunity.

Though soccer is coming up on
the West Coast, this trip into the
soccer center of the country
showed us where we stand. St.
Louis is a reservoir of soccer tal
ent: there are 332 teams in 9 age
classifications (6630 players par
ticipating) in the city. The Uni
versity of St. Louis draws on this
trained talent and their advanced
teamwork outclassed Stanford
from start to finish. But the fact
is that any mid-west team could
have dominated any West Coast
entry. USF and Cal have both
lost in the first round in the last
two years.

It will be years and years per
haps before Stanford can com
pete on equal footing with the
mid-west representative, but the
better competition we face dur
ing our season the faster we will
improve. Menlo Junior College is
no contest, but UCLA, the Air
Force Academy and the Universi
ty of British Columbia could be
worthy opponents who would
stiffen the competition. At any
rale we want to express our
thanks for the privilege and ex
perience of playing a really good
team in St. Louis and hope in the
next few years Stanford’s soccer
will continue to improve.
