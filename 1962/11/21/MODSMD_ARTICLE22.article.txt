# WAY BACK WHEN
## Harvard Flubs Chance for $25 Million Gift 
### CLYDE CHKISTOFFERSON 
Mr. and Mrs. Leland Stanford
had just returned from Europe
after the death of their son. As a
memorial to him, they had decid
ed to give the Stanford millions
to Harvard University.
It had been a long and tiring
trip, but so eager were the Stan
fords to make their donation that
they did not bother changing into
fresher attire. Looking somewhat
worn and bedraggled, they wont
directly from the ship to the of
fice of Harvard’s esteemed presi
dent, Charles W. Eliot.
THE COUPLE, exhausted from
their long ocean voyage, were
quietly ushered into the presence
of the noted Dr. Eliot. Mr. Stan
ford stated the nature of the
visit; he and his wife, in remem
brance of their son, wished to
make a donation to Harvard.
President Eliot had had a busy
morning and noted with impa
tience the obviously modest cir
cumstances of his guests. The
famed mentor had more impor
tant things to do than personally
accept every small donation that
came Harvard’s way.
Mr. Stanford retired to a chair
at one end of Eliot’s office. Mrs.
Stanford walked to a window and
surveyed part of the Harvard
campus. “I wonder how much
money it would take to build
something like that.” she said,
pointing to a nearby building.
PRESIDENT ELIOT looked
impatiently at his watch. He

wanted to taring the meeting to a
rapid close, but rather than tae
abrupt he continued patronizing
his well-meaning guests.
"Oh, I think that Chemistry
building would cost at least $250
thousand,’’ he said.
“Well, how about the entire
Chemistry department?” asked
Mrs. Stanford.

“I’m afraid that would bo at
least a million,” replied President
Eliot, hoping this rather tacky
looking couple would consider
something more in keeping with
their obviously moderate means.
“WELL THEN,” continued Mrs.
Stanford, “how much for the en

tire college?”
The great Harvard president
was now thoroughly exasperated.
“My dear madam, I should think
the whole university would cost
$25 million.”
Mrs. Stanford paused a mo
ment and said calmly, “That’s
about what we had irr mind.
Come, Leland, let’s go build one
of our own.”
And that is how the millions
that might have been Harvard’s j
went West.

visit; he and his wife, in remem
brance of their son, wished to
make a donation to Harvard.
President Eliot had had a busy
morning and noted with impa
tience the obviously modest cir
cumstances of his guests. The
famed mentor had more impor
tant things to do than personally
accept every small donation that
came Harvard’s way.
Mr. Stanford retired to a chair
at one end of Eliot’s office. Mrs.
Stanford walked to a window and
surveyed part of the Harvard
campus. “I wonder how much
money it would take to build
something like that.” she said,
pointing to a nearby building.
PRESIDENT ELIOT looked
impatiently at his watch. He

wanted to taring the meeting to a
rapid close, but rather than tae
abrupt he continued patronizing
his well-meaning guests.
"Oh, I think that Chemistry
building would cost at least $250
thousand,’’ he said.
“Well, how about the entire
Chemistry department?” asked
Mrs. Stanford.

“I’m afraid that would bo at
least a million,” replied President
Eliot, hoping this rather tacky
looking couple would consider
something more in keeping with
their obviously moderate means.
“WELL THEN,” continued Mrs.
Stanford, “how much for the en

tire college?”
The great Harvard president
was now thoroughly exasperated.
“My dear madam, I should think
the whole university would cost
$25 million.”
Mrs. Stanford paused a mo
ment and said calmly, “That’s
about what we had irr mind.
Come, Leland, let’s go build one
of our own.”
And that is how the millions
that might have been Harvard’s j
went West.
Mr. and Mrs. Leland Stanford
had just returned from Europe
after the death of their son. As a
memorial to him, they had decid
ed to give the Stanford millions
to Harvard University.
It had been a long and tiring
trip, but so eager were the Stan
fords to make their donation that
they did not bother changing into
fresher attire. Looking somewhat
worn and bedraggled, they wont
directly from the ship to the of
fice of Harvard’s esteemed presi
dent, Charles W. Eliot.
THE COUPLE, exhausted from
their long ocean voyage, were
quietly ushered into the presence
of the noted Dr. Eliot. Mr. Stan
ford stated the nature of the
visit; he and his wife, in remem
brance of their son, wished to
