# Eleven Indians in Last Game
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
There will be 25 men playing
their last college football game
this Saturday in California’s Me
morial Stadium, 11 from Stanford
and 14 from the Northern Public
Institution.
Stanford seniors are Frank At
kinson, Chuck Buehler, Gary
Craig, Ed Cummings, Tim Han
sel, A1 Hildebrand, Stan Lind
skog, Bob Price, Steve Pursell,
Gary Sargent, C. B. Simons, and
Randy Vahan.
Milking their final appearance
for Cal will be Randy Gold, Larry
Balliett, Jon Mason, Bill O'Brien.
Roger Stull, Nelson Gurll, Dave
Favro, Tom Burke, Jon Erby,
Laren Bock, Manuel Penaflor,
Bill Turner, and Ron Vaughn.
STANFORD rooters can hope
fully look forward to a repeat of
last year’s results, and to the re
tention of the Axe for another
season. In the 1961 Big Game,
several of this year’s seniors
played crucial roles.
Craig scored two of Stanford’s
three touchdowns last year, one
on a 24-yard dash around right
end, and the other on a left end
sweep for four yards. Adding ex
tra points on both of those scores
was Lindskog, whose reliable left
foot has seen heavy duty all dor

ing his varsity carper.
Craig and Cummings have
been defensive standouts all
through their careers. Cummings
was the team leader in tackles
made from his linebacker posi
tion last year, and is leading
again this season by a convincing
margin. He is rated the Indians’
number one fullback, although it
is his outstanding defensive abili
ties which have made him the
bane of opposing teams. He was
named Most Valuable Player in
1961.

PURSELL has been the regu
lar left end for two years, al
though he was out much of the
1961 season with injuries. He has
played well this year, both on of
fense and defense.

The Stanford line will be miss
ing a lot of weight next season,
with the loss of tackles Atkinson,
Hildebrand, Buehler. and center
Simons, These four have done
much to give Stanford one of the
most respected inferior lines in
the country. No opposing coach
has yet failed to mention the
near-impossibility of running the
Stanford middle, and Duffy
Dougherty of Michigan State
compared Stanford’s front wall
favorably to anything he expect
ed to see in the Big Ten. These
four seniors, it should he noted,

total very nearly an even 1000
pounds.
STULL played last season at
guard for the Bears but was
shifted this season to center to
fill a gap left by graduations.
He parallels the Stanford squad’s
shifting of tackle Simons to the
pivot position. Stull is the most
experienced lineman on the
squad, a steady performer.

Bock and Penaflor, tackles, and
guard Erby are, along with Stull,
the only two-year lettermen play
ing this season on the Cal line.
All three are listed as “experi
enced . . . strong . . . aggres
sive,’’ in the thumbnail sketches
released by the Cal publicity de
partment. All will be outweighed
by their counterparts on the
Stanford line.

Gold's appearance at the game
wall not be as a combatant. The
Bears’ star quarterback last year,
he was injured early this season
and has spent the last weeks
keeping statistics for the Cal
coaching staff. It will only be in
this capacity that the Indians
will see him Saturday.
BALLIETT has had his prob
lems this year also. A star de
fensive hack last year, he will be
ready to haunt the Stanford of
fense Saturday. He engineered a
touchdown against Kansas last
week, coming off the bench after
an injury.

Turner and Vaughn, starting
ends for the Cal eleven this year,
have been repeatedly singled out
by coach Marv Levy as key por
tions of the always dangerous
Beat aerial attack.

Turner and Vaughn, starting
ends for the Cal eleven this year,
have been repeatedly singled out
by coach Marv Levy as key por

Beat aerial attack.
There will be 25 men playing
their last college football game
this Saturday in California’s Me
morial Stadium, 11 from Stanford
and 14 from the Northern Public
Institution.
Stanford seniors are Frank At
kinson, Chuck Buehler, Gary
Craig, Ed Cummings, Tim Han
sel, A1 Hildebrand, Stan Lind
skog, Bob Price, Steve Pursell,
Gary Sargent, C. B. Simons, and
Randy Vahan.
Milking their final appearance
for Cal will be Randy Gold, Larry
Balliett, Jon Mason, Bill O'Brien.
Roger Stull, Nelson Gurll, Dave
Favro, Tom Burke, Jon Erby,
Laren Bock, Manuel Penaflor,
Bill Turner, and Ron Vaughn.
STANFORD rooters can hope
fully look forward to a repeat of
last year’s results, and to the re
tention of the Axe for another
season. In the 1961 Big Game,
several of this year’s seniors
played crucial roles.
Craig scored two of Stanford’s
three touchdowns last year, one
on a 24-yard dash around right
end, and the other on a left end
sweep for four yards. Adding ex
tra points on both of those scores
was Lindskog, whose reliable left
foot has seen heavy duty all dor

ing his varsity carper.
Craig and Cummings have
been defensive standouts all
through their careers. Cummings
was the team leader in tackles
made from his linebacker posi
tion last year, and is leading
again this season by a convincing
margin. He is rated the Indians’
number one fullback, although it
is his outstanding defensive abili
ties which have made him the
bane of opposing teams. He was
named Most Valuable Player in
1961.

PURSELL has been the regu
lar left end for two years, al
though he was out much of the
1961 season with injuries. He has
played well this year, both on of
fense and defense.

The Stanford line will be miss
ing a lot of weight next season,
with the loss of tackles Atkinson,
Hildebrand, Buehler. and center
Simons, These four have done
much to give Stanford one of the
most respected inferior lines in
the country. No opposing coach
has yet failed to mention the
near-impossibility of running the
Stanford middle, and Duffy
Dougherty of Michigan State
compared Stanford’s front wall
favorably to anything he expect
ed to see in the Big Ten. These
four seniors, it should he noted,

total very nearly an even 1000
pounds.
STULL played last season at
guard for the Bears but was
shifted this season to center to
fill a gap left by graduations.
He parallels the Stanford squad’s
shifting of tackle Simons to the
pivot position. Stull is the most
experienced lineman on the
squad, a steady performer.

Bock and Penaflor, tackles, and
guard Erby are, along with Stull,
the only two-year lettermen play
ing this season on the Cal line.
All three are listed as “experi
enced . . . strong . . . aggres
sive,’’ in the thumbnail sketches
released by the Cal publicity de
partment. All will be outweighed
by their counterparts on the
Stanford line.

Gold's appearance at the game
wall not be as a combatant. The
Bears’ star quarterback last year,
he was injured early this season
and has spent the last weeks
keeping statistics for the Cal
coaching staff. It will only be in
this capacity that the Indians
will see him Saturday.
BALLIETT has had his prob
lems this year also. A star de
fensive hack last year, he will be
ready to haunt the Stanford of
fense Saturday. He engineered a
touchdown against Kansas last
week, coming off the bench after
an injury.

fensive hack last year, he will be
ready to haunt the Stanford of
fense Saturday. He engineered a
touchdown against Kansas last
week, coming off the bench after
an injury.

Turner and Vaughn, starting
ends for the Cal eleven this year,
have been repeatedly singled out
by coach Marv Levy as key por
tions of the always dangerous
Beat aerial attack.
There will be 25 men playing
their last college football game
this Saturday in California’s Me
morial Stadium, 11 from Stanford
and 14 from the Northern Public
Institution.
Stanford seniors are Frank At
kinson, Chuck Buehler, Gary
Craig, Ed Cummings, Tim Han
sel, A1 Hildebrand, Stan Lind
skog, Bob Price, Steve Pursell,
Gary Sargent, C. B. Simons, and
Randy Vahan.
Milking their final appearance
for Cal will be Randy Gold, Larry
Balliett, Jon Mason, Bill O'Brien.
Roger Stull, Nelson Gurll, Dave
Favro, Tom Burke, Jon Erby,
Laren Bock, Manuel Penaflor,
Bill Turner, and Ron Vaughn.
STANFORD rooters can hope
fully look forward to a repeat of
last year’s results, and to the re
tention of the Axe for another
season. In the 1961 Big Game,
several of this year’s seniors
played crucial roles.
Craig scored two of Stanford’s
three touchdowns last year, one
on a 24-yard dash around right
end, and the other on a left end
sweep for four yards. Adding ex
tra points on both of those scores
was Lindskog, whose reliable left
foot has seen heavy duty all dor

ing his varsity carper.
Craig and Cummings have
been defensive standouts all
through their careers. Cummings
was the team leader in tackles
made from his linebacker posi
tion last year, and is leading
again this season by a convincing
margin. He is rated the Indians’
number one fullback, although it
is his outstanding defensive abili
ties which have made him the
bane of opposing teams. He was
named Most Valuable Player in
1961.

PURSELL has been the regu
lar left end for two years, al
though he was out much of the
1961 season with injuries. He has
played well this year, both on of
fense and defense.

The Stanford line will be miss
ing a lot of weight next season,
with the loss of tackles Atkinson,
Hildebrand, Buehler. and center
Simons, These four have done
much to give Stanford one of the
most respected inferior lines in
the country. No opposing coach
has yet failed to mention the
near-impossibility of running the
Stanford middle, and Duffy
Dougherty of Michigan State
compared Stanford’s front wall
favorably to anything he expect
ed to see in the Big Ten. These
four seniors, it should he noted,

total very nearly an even 1000
pounds.
STULL played last season at
guard for the Bears but was
shifted this season to center to
fill a gap left by graduations.
He parallels the Stanford squad’s
shifting of tackle Simons to the
pivot position. Stull is the most
experienced lineman on the
squad, a steady performer.

Bock and Penaflor, tackles, and
guard Erby are, along with Stull,
the only two-year lettermen play
ing this season on the Cal line.
All three are listed as “experi
enced . . . strong . . . aggres
sive,’’ in the thumbnail sketches
released by the Cal publicity de
partment. All will be outweighed
by their counterparts on the
Stanford line.

Gold's appearance at the game
wall not be as a combatant. The
Bears’ star quarterback last year,
he was injured early this season
and has spent the last weeks
keeping statistics for the Cal
coaching staff. It will only be in
this capacity that the Indians
will see him Saturday.
BALLIETT has had his prob
lems this year also. A star de
fensive hack last year, he will be
ready to haunt the Stanford of
fense Saturday. He engineered a
touchdown against Kansas last
week, coming off the bench after
an injury.

Turner and Vaughn, starting
ends for the Cal eleven this year,
have been repeatedly singled out
by coach Marv Levy as key por
tions of the always dangerous
Beat aerial attack.
