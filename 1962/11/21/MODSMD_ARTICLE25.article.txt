Stanford’s cross country team
set a national five-man three-mile
record of 1:10.16 Monday, in Ihe
process of handing Cal a whop
ping 15-47 defeat on the loser’s
track.
The total time for the first five
Indians across the iine was more
than a minute under the old rec

Stanford’s Dave Deubner came
within six seconds of setting a
national freshman three-mile rec
ord, winning the race in 13:57.7.
However, the freshman who holds
the record, John Macy of Hou
ston, is a 28-year-old foreigner,
so Deubner was credited with the
U.S, citizen’s frosh mark.
