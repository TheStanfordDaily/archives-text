# University of California Deifies Potential; Object of Worship is Promising Sophomore
## 
### BOB SCHADER 
At the University of California,
the deification of Potential has
reached an advanced stage. Per
formance is given due regard
only when hits of Potential are
non-existent or when Perform
ance simply stomps to the fore, a
rare event on football Saturdays
at Berkeley. The object of wor
ship is the Promising Sophomore,
a celestial being exceeded in the
hearts of Cal rooters only by the
concept of the Promising Fresh
man, an etherial image indeed.
This is well and bitching; per
haps it is the natural evolution of
football into a more meaningful
spiritual experience. At any rate.
Potentialism has made football at
California a lighter burden for
students, coaches and partici
pants alike. It’s product is an
optimism which brightens the
present with the light of the fu
ture.
Three weeks ago, however, this
entire theology was endangered
by the arrival of Performance in
the person of sophomore Craig
Morton. Against Penn State the
former Campbell High great com
pleted 20 of 28 passes for 274
yards and ran another 1] for a
first game total of 285 yards and
a new California record for total
offense in one game. Anyone fa
miliar with the prevailing plot
in Cal’s losses can at once sense
the threat inherent in a sopho
more who can perform as well as
promise. He menaces the very
basis of the UC football struc

ture.
CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL this
year has been characterized by in
spired play and several close
games despite eight losses. The
general pleasantness of Berkeley
football has gone unmarred by
talk of moral victories with the
accompanying rationalization and
underlying bitterness. In the only
contest which the Boars were fa
vored to win this season- the San
Jose game—they came through
with a solid victory. Against the
rest of their opponents the Cali
fornia eleven were billed as wide
eyed youngsters who would play
their hearts out, but really ex
pected nothing so grand as a win.
In most of their games they fol
lowed the script beautifully.
Two weeks ago, however,
the Morton-led Bears drew 43,600
customers. 12,000 more than at
tended the Penn State contest. Of
these 12,000 probably 8.000 were
predaceous fans, the sort who go
to football games simply to be
gratified with a win. These cus
tomers, who aren’t satisfied by
mere promise, are unwilling to
content themselves with singing
the Star Spangled Banner and
gazing at the pom pon girls. They
demand victory, and if not “real”
victory, then moral victory, After
a steady fare of moral victories,
the predatory fan generally
varies his diet with a coach. He
is, in short, a bestial fellow who
has no more business at a UC
football exhibition than he has at
a UC ban the bomb rally. It is he
who, if provoked, would raze the
temple of Potentialism.
THOSE WHO ATTENDED the
UCLA game did not see a win but
they did catch a glimpse of Per
formance- 198 yards net from
Morton with augmentative bits
and pieces from prominent sopho
more backs Epstein. Blakney and
Blanchfield. The essence of moral
victory was there; the Bears
needed only a gridiron Goliath
willing to take a dive in order tq
be back on the accepted, frustrat
ing path of occasional winners
which just don’t have it football
wise.

Fortunately, their next oppo
nent, Washington, had fallen only
the week before, and was in no
mood to oblige. They crushed the
Bears lifeless, 27-0. Cal was
once again safely on the path of
lenitive Potentialism.
LAST SATURDAY at Kansas.

things were definitely hack to
normal. Cal had lost again, and
again with honor, 21-33. Morton
had passed for 170 yards; the
Bears had proved that their of
fense could still fall just short
despite consistently high individ
ual performance. Coach Levy was
described as looking dejected; he
needn’t have. Kansas Mentor
Jack Mitchell handled Levy’s post
game lines with aplomb: “They’re

going to bo real good. They have
plenty of potential. Cal is a team
to look out for in the future.”
Thus the crisis has passed. The
Cult of the Underclassmen will be
reigning in Strawberry Canyon
opening Saturday 1963. The only
obstacle to the perpetuation of
this beneficent faith is the pos
sibility of a Stanford loss to Cali
fornia in the season finale. This,
as we all know, is inconceivable.
