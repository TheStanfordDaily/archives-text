"Wo were not the lost genera
tion, hut the disappointed genera
tion,’' novelist-critic Glenway Wes
cott summarized in his Tuesday
El v en i n g reminiscences on the
expatriate literary world of the
1920’5.

A literary generation mirrors
itself in reverse try the irritations
it feels with its predecessors, he
maintained; in this way the gen
eration carves out and maintains
its right to a particular mode of
literary investigation. Wescott de
clared that his own contempor
aries have given up the technical
fireworks and “guessing • game”
literature of their “father-figures”
in order to become “direct com
municators,” because they have
more important things to say and
prefer to be innovative primarily
in content rather than in style.
WESCOTT GAVE his impres
sions of “Father - figures” Ford
and Gertrude Stein. Ford, whose
detractors called “Freud Madox
Fraud,” Wescott saw as a mix
ture of Han Christian Andersen
and Edward Lear, “a Falstaff,
but a Falstaff with ideals.” To
Miss Stein, who disliked Wescott’s
writing for its syrupy sweetness,
Wescott attributed the source of
Hemingway’s “magic celequial
ism," his “basic baby-talk of the
human animal.”

Wescott said that what young
writers need most of all is publi
cation, probably in “little maga
zines,” alongside the great crea
tive figures of the ago, rather
than prize contests and high pay
ment rates.

“What an author wants most
of all is to bo kept in print,” he
maintained.
