### 
Yesterday at 2:15 p.m. the
quiet, contemplative air of the
main library was pierced by the
sound of bells and buzzers. The
cause of the excitement was a
phone call received by Mis.
Louise Gordon, assistant librari
an, informing her that a bomb
was planted in the library.
Students reluctantly evacuated
the library and a fruitless, hour
long search followed. At first the
evacuees assumed that the call
was from a Cal student, but later
they decided that the caller would
have to be able to use a phone
book and dial.
Cal students were, however,
caught by police yesterday morn
ing putting a banner on the li
brary flagpole. A Cal banner was
placed on Memorial arch Monday
morning at 3:45 a.m. long enough
for the hoaxers to get a picture.
