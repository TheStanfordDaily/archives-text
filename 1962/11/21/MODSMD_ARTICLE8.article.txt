# Big Game to Settle Success of Cal, Tribe
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Once again Stanford and Cal
football players and fans are
faced with the paradox that the
Big Game means nothing yet it
means everything. With crucial
games deciding th e champion
ships of the Big Eight, the Big
Ten, and the Southeastern Con
ference set for this weekend, one
would hardly expect the winner of
the Bay Area’s major university
championship to draw any na
tional acclaim. Even on the West
Coast, the major attractions are
in Los Angelos where USC at
tempts to stretch its unbeaten
string and in Corvallis where the
two, 7-2 Oregon Schools teams
compete for state-wide honors.
But this Saturday at 1:30, when
Stanford brings its 4-5 mark into
Memorial Stadium and Cal enters

with its lone victory in what
Blaine Newham, the Cal Daily
Sports Editor calls the “Game
of the Weak,’’ 77,000 will cheer as
if the national championship were
being played. It is precisely be
cause of their lacklustre records
that the Big Game means so much
to both teams and their rooters.
With a minimum of pleasantries
and honors to look back on this
year, their enthusiasm, held in
check by disappointments up to
now, will gush forth into the Ber
keley Bowl.

THUS the outcome of the Big
Game just about determines the
successfulness of the season for
the Indian or Bear teams.

If you don’t believe this, just
watch the reaction of the biggest
collegiate football crowd of the
season on the West Coast. Or talk
to Don Liebendorfer, Stanford’s
athletic publicity director since
1924; “There’s no question,” says
Don. “I’d rather win the Big Game
more than any other; it makes up
for a lot of disappointments in a
season, and vice versa —it can
negate a lot of successes, too.” Or
by looking in the women’s dress
ing room in the BAC where (I’ve
been told) significant dates such
as “Red and White Day,” “Burn
the Bear Day,” and “Big Game
Day” have been circled in red ever
since the November page of the
calendar made its appearance.

THE BIG GAME SERIES now
stands at 28-26-10 in favor of Cali
fornia. Last year, the Indians
started a comeback, winning 20-7
in a torrential downpour, which
demonstrated in earnest to many
West Coast fans for the first time
that football games can’t be
rained out. Stanford rooters cele
brated down on the muddy field
after the game, throwing jibes at
the Cal section as the Axe was re
trieved, and then walked home
happily with about half the field
still stuck to their feet.
THIS YEAR, a dry field and
clear weather are expected, con
ditions conducive to the kind of
offense both Cal and Stanford
have evolved since the beginning
of the season. The Indians started
this year depending completely on
rushing; they threw only six pass
es in their first game, a 6-3 vic
tory over Tulane.
At that time, Coach Jack Cur
tice’s offense, traditionally wide
open, was expected to tone itself
down during 1962 and follow its
232 pound line in a grinding,
short-gaining attack. However,
without the threat of a speed
around the ends, the rushing has
been deemphasized partly and has
gradually been integrated into a
more passing-minded offense. The
beefy line has showed its stuff on


THE STANFORD INDIAN and Oski glare at each other across a Big Game capacity crowd of 77,000.
