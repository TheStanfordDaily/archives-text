## Red Chinese Announce Cease-Fire; Warn India Not to Violate Truce 
### United Press International 
TOKYO Communist China announced its troops would cease
firing on the Sino-Indian frontier at midnight today, 8 a.m. PST, and
would withdraw on Dec. 1 to positions well behind the present
battle lines.
An official statement by the Peking government said it “sin
cerely hoped” New Delhi would make a positive response but that it
would carry out (he proposals as scheduled even if it did not receive
any reply. But if India moved into vacated spots, it said, the Chinese
would retaliate.
The gist of the proposal appeared to be that Red China would
concede India most of the territory India claims in the disputed
eastern section of their 2,500-mile border but that India would have
to give up territory it claims in the Ladakh area of Kashmir far to
the west. The Chinese plan would set up a neutral zone between the
two armies but in territory claimed by India. In the past Nehru has
rejected similar proposals. What he would do about the cease-fire
and (he Chinese proposal to withdraw remained to be seen.
The unilateral Chinese action came at a time the Chinese in one
month had overrun the 2,500 square miles in Ladakh they claim and
much of the 55,000 square miles they claim in India’s North East
Frontier Agency (NEFA).

crisis in the last week—would be removed and can be “observed and
counted as they leave.”
The President said that “inasmuch as this goes a long way
towards reducing the danger which faced this hemisphere four
weeks ago, I have this afternoon instructed the secretary of defense
to lift our Naval quarantine.”
KENNEDY SIGNS CIVIL RIGHTS ORDER WASHINGTON
With a “stroke of the pen” President Kennedy yesterday signed

Kennedy announced at his news conference that the order would

be some adverse reaction” to the order, “but I think we will be able
to proceed with our housing industry.”
