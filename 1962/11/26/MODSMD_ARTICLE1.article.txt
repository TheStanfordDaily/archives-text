# Constitution Passes 4 to 1; Taketa, McFadden Win
## 
### 
The new ASSU constitution, a
revision of the constitution which
was defeated in last spring quar
ter’s elections, was passed in last
Wednesday’s elections by almost
a four to one margin.
Armin Rosencranz, ASSU pres
ident, expressed his feelings
about the constitution in the
words of Thomas Jefferson: “The
constitution is unquestionably
the wisest ever yet presented to
man, and some of the accommo
dations of interest which it has
adopted are greatly pleasing to
we who have before had occasion
of seeing how difficult those in
terests were to accommodate. But

general concurrence of opinion
seems to authorize us to say it
has some defects.” “But,” added
Rosencranz, "those are far out
weighed by the merits.”
THE NEW constitution, which
passed 1362 to 353 votes, will
bring some significant changes to
Stanford student body govern
ment. LASSU has been enlarged
to about 120 members, in order
to provide more direct represen
tation of the students. In addi
tion, the legislature will be led
by a Speaker elected by LASSU
members instead of by the ASSU
president as it is at present.
Another major change in stu
dent body government will be the
appointment of judicial council
members. Until now those mem
bers have been elected. The new
procedure will come into effect
Spring Quarter.
The new constitution must still
be formally ratified by the trus
tees. However, they have already
seen it and had the opportunity
to comment on it and voice their
objections.
JIM WOOLSKY, administrative
assistant to Rosencranz, who has
been working on the constitution
says. “I’d like to express thanks
for the ASSU to all those who by
their suggestions, criticisms, and
votes have made it possible for
student government at Stanford
to begin the transition from con
fusion and irrelevancy to signifi
cance. I especially want to thank
the three people I feel are most
responsible for the initial step in
this transition A1 Lowenstein,
Bob Sayler, and Tom Boysen.”
Freshman class officers and
some living group representatives
to LASSU were also chosen at
last week’s elections. Freshman
president is Terence Taketa, who
defeated Christopher Kirby 511
to 234. Freshman vice-president,
Margaret McFadden, received
407 votes, while her opponent,
Donald Gray, received 314.
The now LASSU representative
from Branner is Marcia Hilde
brande (55 votes) who defeated
Ruth Thompson (51 votes). The
two now Wilbur representatives
are Jerome Debs (184 votes) and
Thomas Kerwin (208 votes); they
defeated David Guggenhime (131
votes) and Stephen Elrick (180
votes). Roble will be represented
by Janna Orkney, who received
99 votes to Maltha Maskall’s 80.
Stern’s new representative is Ver
non Wedin (189 votes) who de
feated Leonard Snaider (82
votes).

members instead of by the ASSU
president as it is at present.
Another major change in stu
dent body government will be the
appointment of judicial council
members. Until now those mem
bers have been elected. The new
procedure will come into effect
Spring Quarter.
The new constitution must still
be formally ratified by the trus
tees. However, they have already
seen it and had the opportunity
to comment on it and voice their
objections.
JIM WOOLSKY, administrative
assistant to Rosencranz, who has
been working on the constitution
says. “I’d like to express thanks
for the ASSU to all those who by
their suggestions, criticisms, and
votes have made it possible for
student government at Stanford
to begin the transition from con
fusion and irrelevancy to signifi
cance. I especially want to thank
the three people I feel are most
responsible for the initial step in
this transition A1 Lowenstein,
Bob Sayler, and Tom Boysen.”
Freshman class officers and
some living group representatives
to LASSU were also chosen at
last week’s elections. Freshman
president is Terence Taketa, who
defeated Christopher Kirby 511
to 234. Freshman vice-president,
Margaret McFadden, received
407 votes, while her opponent,
Donald Gray, received 314.
The now LASSU representative
from Branner is Marcia Hilde
brande (55 votes) who defeated
Ruth Thompson (51 votes). The
two now Wilbur representatives
are Jerome Debs (184 votes) and
Thomas Kerwin (208 votes); they
defeated David Guggenhime (131
votes) and Stephen Elrick (180
votes). Roble will be represented
by Janna Orkney, who received
99 votes to Maltha Maskall’s 80.
Stern’s new representative is Ver
non Wedin (189 votes) who de
feated Leonard Snaider (82
votes).
The new ASSU constitution, a
revision of the constitution which
was defeated in last spring quar
ter’s elections, was passed in last
Wednesday’s elections by almost
a four to one margin.
Armin Rosencranz, ASSU pres
ident, expressed his feelings
about the constitution in the
words of Thomas Jefferson: “The
constitution is unquestionably
the wisest ever yet presented to
man, and some of the accommo
dations of interest which it has
adopted are greatly pleasing to
we who have before had occasion
of seeing how difficult those in
terests were to accommodate. But

general concurrence of opinion
seems to authorize us to say it
has some defects.” “But,” added
Rosencranz, "those are far out
weighed by the merits.”
THE NEW constitution, which
passed 1362 to 353 votes, will
bring some significant changes to
Stanford student body govern
ment. LASSU has been enlarged
to about 120 members, in order
to provide more direct represen
tation of the students. In addi
tion, the legislature will be led
by a Speaker elected by LASSU
members instead of by the ASSU
president as it is at present.
