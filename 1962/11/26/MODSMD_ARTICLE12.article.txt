# Coach Curtice Deserves Renewal of Contract
## 
### 
For several weeks sportswriters and the general public have
been speculating over the fate of the University’s football coach
now that his five-year contract has nearly run out. After Stanford
whipped Cal last Saturday, one point was clarified: Coach Jack
Curtice wants to stay at Stanford as head football coach. After the
game Saturday he said that he wanted to hold onto his job; we
hope he will.

After five years at Stanford, the teams coached by Mr. Curtice
have compiled a 14-36 won-loss record. Although this record is
undistinguished, the last three years have seen a constant im
provement. In 1960 the team lost all its ten games; last year they
won four, and this year they finished with a .500 record having
won five games. This is a record of progress which, in itself, is
sufficient reason for retaining Mr. Curtice. And this year Stan
ford scored three spectacular victories, over Michigan State,
UCLA, and California; these three games alone made the season a
success. And how can you fire a coach after a season with these
victories and a .500 percentage? How can you fire a coach whose
team has improved its record over three consecutive years?
The best reason for firing a coach is that he has been a dis
credit to the sport or the University. Jack Curtice has been a
credit to both; when he loses, he loses without rancor and when
he wins, he wins gracefully. Not a practitioner of the “total foot
ball school of Bear Bryant, Mr. Curtice understands the proper
role of football at a University. Part of the reason he came to Stan
ford five years ago was his respect for Stanford as an educational
institution and not as a football factory.

Coach Curtice is now in Casey Stengel’s position when Sten
gel was managing the Boston Braves and Brooklyn Dodgers
decades ago; he finds himself blamed for events beyond his con
trol. But Stengel was given an opportunity with the Yankees, and
his reputation as a manager soared with the success of his new
team. When Mr. Curtice left Utah, he left behind him the
equivalent of Stengel’s record with the Yankees, and at Stanford
he has compiled a record similar to the Stengel Braves or Stengel
Mots. At Utah Mr. Curtice won thirty-three games, lost ten, and
tied two for the best record of any coach in the Skyline conference.
Faced with a challenge at Stanford, Mr. Curtice left Utah to
coach at a university where football is not all-important, where
glory defers to sport.
Although the coach’s won-loss record is central to his fate,
there is another oft-cited consideration: is the coach developing
the full potential of his players? This is a technical question
requiring technical competence, but it is safe to say that the foot
ball team has risen on occasion to performance far beyond its
potential. The Michigan State game is the prime example.
Effective pressure for a football coach’s removal nearly always
builds up among dissatisfied alumni. But the decision is not up to
them. It is up to the Stanford Athletic Board and the President.
The Athletic Board will recommend a course of action to the
President on the basis of a recommendation from the Athletic
Department. On more than one occasion in the past, the President
has stated that if there is one thing to which administrators are
accustomed and resistant, it is pressure. We hope the Athletic-
Board and the President will resist all alumni pressure (real,
threatened, or anticipated).

If Mr. Curtice is fired, it will ho another case of a university’s
believing its image to be tarnished and its attractiveness under
mined when its football team is not a winner. If the University
chooses to fire Mr. Curtice, it will admit that winning is the most
important criterion for judging a coach and the job lie is doing.
If, however, the University rehires Mr. Curtice, it will have vin
dicated the principle that a coach need not produce conference
winners to be a good coach.
