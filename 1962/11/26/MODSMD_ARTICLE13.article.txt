Editor, The Daily:
The former Stanford Chapter
of the Sigma Nu Fraternity, now
known as the Beta Chi Fraterni
ty, deserves strong commenda
tion for its recent unanimous vote
to disaffiliate with the National
Fraternity because of the latter’s
discriminatory policies. This ac
tion is admirable for its recog
nition that such policies are ana
chronistic in. and incompatible
with an educational environment
in which accomplishment and
worth are measured by an in
dividual’s abilities and talents. It

is admirable also for the appar
ent tolerance and restraint of the
proponents of disaffiliation in ad
vancing their position among
brother members, alumni and na
tional representatives.
I think I speak for the entire
student body in trusting that in
Stanford’s fraternity system, the
remaining vestiges of a less en
lightened era will be acknowl
edged as decadent and obsolete
and, accordingly, will be quickly
and voluntarily renounced.
