## Fehrenbacher's 'Prelude to Greatness' Delineates The Transitional Lincoln 
### 
By ROSALIND GBKENK
“Prelude To Greatness, Lincoln
in the 1850’s” by Don K. Fehren
baeher, Stanford University
Press, 205 pp., $4.75.

Both the Bible and Abraham
Lincoln lay special claim to rever
ence in the heart of the American
people. “Prelude To Greatness”
by Don E. Fehrenbacher deals
with Lincoln. In these seven es
says, some reprints which have
previously appeared elsewhere,
he centers his attention on the
“relation between a man’s rise to
power and the historical process
in which he was involved.”
It is far from a dry account.
Each of the seven essays throws
light on some event or political
activity in Lincoln's career from
1850, when he had failed to regain
his seat in the House of Repre
sentatives, to 1860, when he won
the Republican nomination and,
subsequently, the office of Presi
dent of the United States. How
Lincoln managed to rise from an
undistinguished representative to
the unchallenged leader of the
Republic, and the circumstances
which contributed to this rise be
come the crux of Eehrenbacher’s

investigation,
THK KSSAVS are remarkable
in their scrutiny and scholarship,
and in their appraisals and re
appraisals of earlier biographies
and histiographical commentaries
on Lincoln by his political con
temporaries. such as Lincoln’s
law partner, William Herndon,
by the indomitable newspaper gi
ants, such as Horace Greeley of
the N.Y. Tribune, by personal cor
respondences, by newspaper ac
counts, by such biographers as
Nevins, Beveridge, Randall, and
so the list goes on and on.
Fehrenbacher points out that
it was through these people's ef
forts, both partisan and non-par
tisan. that the legends of Lincoln
emerged—“one, the incarnatkm
of frontier America; the other,
the great national hero, Christ
like in his character and fate.”
Both images are popular; neither
one is essentially false. Neverthe
less, the author’s stated purpose
in these essays is “to delineate
the transitional Lincoln of the
1850’5,” the ambitious lawyer,
the apt politician, the vigorous
and practical man of affairs, and
the folklore of the railsplitter
sometimes gets in the way.
Fehrenbacher presupposes some
sophistication on the part of the
reader with regard to the issues
of the day, so if you’re unhappily
rusty with regard to the Dred
Scott Decision, the Wilmot Pro
viso, the Missouri Compromise,
and similar legislative maneu
vers, it might be helpful to have
some reference text within reach.
Mainly these issues are used to
give us some insight into the po
litical passions and territorial
conflicts of the day, so that we
may have a basis for understand
ing the dilemma of a young law
yer whose political life depended
upon his ability to deal with
them. Lincoln’s ability was
unique not only in dealing with
hotly controversial issues, but in
turning them to his advantage
without having to sacrifice his
own moral principles.
AS WE follow Lincoln and
Douglas on their exhaustive
schedules of campaign rallies,
conventions, debates, and
speeches, we can only wonder at.
the sheer stamina of the candi
dates. Douglas estimated that he
had given “just one hundred and
thirty speeches” during one sen
atorial contest, and in 1860, after
the Cooper Institute address. Lin
coln proceeded into New England
and began a succession of twelve
major speeches given within
thirteen days.

And this output of energy was
by no means limited to the can
didates. Fehrenbacher reports
that, “In every community fa
vored with a visit from one or
both of the candidates, there were
weeks of preparation, spurred by

a fierce resolve to outdo the en
emy in numbers, noise, and dis
play,” and the audiences though
not always courteous, were usu
ally attentive and responsive
throughout meetings that aver
aged at least, three hours in
length.
Fehrenbacher’s writing is pre
cise and to the point. He finds
slavery the crucial issue of the
period, and, thus Lincoln’s stand
on the extension of the practice
becomes a determining factor
both in his path to the presiden
cy, and in the Union’s path to
civil war. In Fehrenbacher’s
words. ‘‘Lincoln had constructed
his political philosophy upon the
belief that public policy should
reflect an ethical purpose which
was not itself subject to the daily
barter of politics.” Subsequent
events resulting from this belief
were to test the strength and
moral fiber of Lincoln and the
Nation he led.

Fehrenbacher’s writing is pre

slavery the crucial issue of the

civil war. In Fehrenbacher’s

his political philosophy upon the

Both the Bible and Abraham
Lincoln lay special claim to rever
ence in the heart of the American
people. “Prelude To Greatness”
by Don E. Fehrenbacher deals
with Lincoln. In these seven es
says, some reprints which have
previously appeared elsewhere,
he centers his attention on the
“relation between a man’s rise to
power and the historical process
in which he was involved.”
It is far from a dry account.
Each of the seven essays throws
light on some event or political
activity in Lincoln's career from
1850, when he had failed to regain
his seat in the House of Repre
sentatives, to 1860, when he won
the Republican nomination and,
subsequently, the office of Presi
dent of the United States. How
Lincoln managed to rise from an
undistinguished representative to
the unchallenged leader of the
Republic, and the circumstances
which contributed to this rise be
come the crux of Eehrenbacher’s

investigation,
THK KSSAVS are remarkable
in their scrutiny and scholarship,
and in their appraisals and re
appraisals of earlier biographies
and histiographical commentaries
on Lincoln by his political con
temporaries. such as Lincoln’s
law partner, William Herndon,
by the indomitable newspaper gi
ants, such as Horace Greeley of
the N.Y. Tribune, by personal cor
respondences, by newspaper ac
counts, by such biographers as
Nevins, Beveridge, Randall, and
so the list goes on and on.
Fehrenbacher points out that
it was through these people's ef
forts, both partisan and non-par
tisan. that the legends of Lincoln
emerged—“one, the incarnatkm
of frontier America; the other,
the great national hero, Christ
like in his character and fate.”
Both images are popular; neither
one is essentially false. Neverthe
less, the author’s stated purpose
in these essays is “to delineate
the transitional Lincoln of the
1850’5,” the ambitious lawyer,
the apt politician, the vigorous
and practical man of affairs, and
the folklore of the railsplitter
sometimes gets in the way.
Fehrenbacher presupposes some
sophistication on the part of the
reader with regard to the issues
of the day, so if you’re unhappily
rusty with regard to the Dred
Scott Decision, the Wilmot Pro
viso, the Missouri Compromise,
and similar legislative maneu
vers, it might be helpful to have
some reference text within reach.
Mainly these issues are used to
give us some insight into the po
litical passions and territorial
conflicts of the day, so that we
may have a basis for understand
ing the dilemma of a young law
yer whose political life depended
upon his ability to deal with
them. Lincoln’s ability was
unique not only in dealing with
hotly controversial issues, but in
turning them to his advantage
without having to sacrifice his
own moral principles.
AS WE follow Lincoln and
Douglas on their exhaustive
schedules of campaign rallies,
conventions, debates, and

had given “just one hundred and

dates. Douglas estimated that he
had given “just one hundred and
thirty speeches” during one sen
atorial contest, and in 1860, after
the Cooper Institute address. Lin
coln proceeded into New England
and began a succession of twelve
major speeches given within
thirteen days.

And this output of energy was
by no means limited to the can
didates. Fehrenbacher reports
that, “In every community fa
vored with a visit from one or
both of the candidates, there were
weeks of preparation, spurred by

a fierce resolve to outdo the en

play,” and the audiences though
not always courteous, were usu

length.
Fehrenbacher’s writing is pre
cise and to the point. He finds
slavery the crucial issue of the
period, and, thus Lincoln’s stand
on the extension of the practice
becomes a determining factor
both in his path to the presiden

civil war. In Fehrenbacher’s
words. ‘‘Lincoln had constructed
his political philosophy upon the
belief that public policy should
reflect an ethical purpose which
was not itself subject to the daily
barter of politics.” Subsequent
events resulting from this belief
were to test the strength and
moral fiber of Lincoln and the
Nation he led.

“Prelude To Greatness, Lincoln
in the 1850’s” by Don K. Fehren
baeher, Stanford University
Press, 205 pp., $4.75.

Both the Bible and Abraham
Lincoln lay special claim to rever
ence in the heart of the American
people. “Prelude To Greatness”
by Don E. Fehrenbacher deals
with Lincoln. In these seven es
says, some reprints which have
previously appeared elsewhere,
he centers his attention on the
“relation between a man’s rise to
power and the historical process
in which he was involved.”
It is far from a dry account.
Each of the seven essays throws
light on some event or political
activity in Lincoln's career from
1850, when he had failed to regain
his seat in the House of Repre
sentatives, to 1860, when he won
the Republican nomination and,
subsequently, the office of Presi
dent of the United States. How
Lincoln managed to rise from an
undistinguished representative to
the unchallenged leader of the
Republic, and the circumstances
which contributed to this rise be
come the crux of Eehrenbacher’s

investigation,
THK KSSAVS are remarkable
in their scrutiny and scholarship,
and in their appraisals and re
appraisals of earlier biographies
and histiographical commentaries
on Lincoln by his political con
temporaries. such as Lincoln’s
law partner, William Herndon,
by the indomitable newspaper gi
ants, such as Horace Greeley of
the N.Y. Tribune, by personal cor
respondences, by newspaper ac
counts, by such biographers as
Nevins, Beveridge, Randall, and
so the list goes on and on.
Fehrenbacher points out that
it was through these people's ef
forts, both partisan and non-par
tisan. that the legends of Lincoln
emerged—“one, the incarnatkm
of frontier America; the other,
the great national hero, Christ
like in his character and fate.”
Both images are popular; neither
one is essentially false. Neverthe
less, the author’s stated purpose
in these essays is “to delineate
the transitional Lincoln of the
1850’5,” the ambitious lawyer,
the apt politician, the vigorous
and practical man of affairs, and
the folklore of the railsplitter
