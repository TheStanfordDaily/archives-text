## 'Local Fraternities Are Improvement Over Nationals' 
### KICK SEIFERT 
The issue of racial discrimina
tion in the Sigma Nu National
Fraternity was only part of Beta
Chi’s dissatisfaction with its late
affiliation. More fundamental to
the action taken by the members
of Beta Chi was the questioning
of the value of a national affili
ation as such, with or without
membership restrictions based
on race or religion.
Unlike ATO local which has
made its break from its national
in fact but. strangely enough, not
in, name, the one-time members
of Sigma Nu have put full confi
dence in their ability to remain
active in campus affairs as a
local, Beta Chi. Furthermore,
ATO local has had feelers out to
National fraternities with reaffil
iation as a possible goal. Beta
Chi has become a local in fact,
name, and spirit.
The advantages of being a local
fraternity on the Stanford cam
pus are numerous.
Freshmen have become less
and less aware of so-called
“strong nationals” and have
chosen fraternities more and
more on the basis of what the
local chapter has to offer regard
less of national affiliation. A lo
cal fraternity recognizes this fact
and lives by it without having to
make financial and non-financial
contributions to a national or
ganization for a worthless name.
At many colleges and universi
ties, a national affiliation is a
highly prized possession because
it adds prestige to the individual
member once he has graduated
from an institution which is com
paratively unknown to prospec
tive employers and the like. Such
is not the case at Stanford and
other well-known universities for
obvious reasons.
Moreover, National Fraterni
ties make frequent attempts at
inculcating the wayward spirit of
days gone-by into students of the
modern age who receive such
nonsense as quasi-religious ini
tiation ceremonies as so much
anachronism. Brotherhood is one
thing but melodrama is another.
As a local fraternity Beta Chi
has the truly unique opportunity
of writing a Fraternity charter
and constitution that can change
with the times.

Furthermore, many fraternity
men resent having to pour money
into a national fraternity in order
to pay for such trivia as gold em
bossed membership certificates
and national fraternity maga
zines whose contents are foreign
to the reader whoever he may be.
Such misdirected funds could bo
better used at Stanford to make

obvious house improvements.
Although much praise has been
heaped upon Beta Chi for its
hard-nosed stand against racial
discrimination, commendation
should also he given to its mem
bers for the wisdom shown in
severing their national ties as
such.

At many colleges and universi
ties, a national affiliation is a
highly prized possession because
it adds prestige to the individual
member once he has graduated
from an institution which is com
paratively unknown to prospec
tive employers and the like. Such
is not the case at Stanford and
other well-known universities for
obvious reasons.
Moreover, National Fraterni
ties make frequent attempts at
inculcating the wayward spirit of
days gone-by into students of the
modern age who receive such
nonsense as quasi-religious ini
tiation ceremonies as so much
anachronism. Brotherhood is one
thing but melodrama is another.
As a local fraternity Beta Chi
has the truly unique opportunity
of writing a Fraternity charter
and constitution that can change
with the times.

Furthermore, many fraternity
men resent having to pour money
into a national fraternity in order
to pay for such trivia as gold em
bossed membership certificates
and national fraternity maga
zines whose contents are foreign
to the reader whoever he may be.
Such misdirected funds could bo
better used at Stanford to make

obvious house improvements.
Although much praise has been
heaped upon Beta Chi for its
hard-nosed stand against racial
discrimination, commendation
should also he given to its mem
bers for the wisdom shown in
severing their national ties as
such.
The issue of racial discrimina
tion in the Sigma Nu National
Fraternity was only part of Beta
Chi’s dissatisfaction with its late
affiliation. More fundamental to
the action taken by the members
of Beta Chi was the questioning
of the value of a national affili
ation as such, with or without
membership restrictions based
on race or religion.
Unlike ATO local which has
made its break from its national
in fact but. strangely enough, not
in, name, the one-time members
of Sigma Nu have put full confi
dence in their ability to remain
active in campus affairs as a
local, Beta Chi. Furthermore,
ATO local has had feelers out to
National fraternities with reaffil
iation as a possible goal. Beta
Chi has become a local in fact,
name, and spirit.
The advantages of being a local
fraternity on the Stanford cam
pus are numerous.
Freshmen have become less
and less aware of so-called
“strong nationals” and have
chosen fraternities more and
more on the basis of what the
local chapter has to offer regard
less of national affiliation. A lo
cal fraternity recognizes this fact
and lives by it without having to
make financial and non-financial
contributions to a national or
ganization for a worthless name.
