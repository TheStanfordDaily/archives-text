Editor, The Dully;
As far as I can see, The Daily
is overstepping its editorial privi
lege in condemning Kappa Alpha
Fraternity for its alleged discrim
inatory clause. The manner in
which Kappa Alpha or any other
private organization conducts its
internal affairs is not the busi
ness of The Daily.
The Daily has clearly stated its
position opposing discrimination
on several occasions. I, too, op
pose any form of discrimination,
and I would guess that most Kap
pa Alphas hold the same views,
but no one except Kappa Alpha
has any business deciding what
Kappa Alpha should do.

(Editor’s note: Yon are ill-ad
vised (« suggest that The Daily
and, in fact, “no one except Kap
pa Alpha has any business decid
ing what Kappa Alpha should do”
to combat their national discrimi
natory clause. Although The
Daily has no power in deciding
what Kappa Alpha WILL do, The
Daily does have a responsibility
in “deciding what Kappa Alpha
SHOULD do.” Not only does The
Daily have the right to comment

sity. As for the University, it has

Editor, The Daily:
The members of Rally Com.
are very fortunate indeed to be
able to use the Burrough’s 220
computer to arrange the card
stunts. We all realize how much
time and effort it saves them. It
is unfortunate, however, that
some members of Rally Com.
consider the students in the root
ing section, who must perform
the stunts, as machines also. The
students cannot perform the
stunts with computer-like speed.
The case in point, of course, is
the half-time fiasco at Berkeley
Saturday. With a set of eight
cards (sixteen colors) on his lap,
each student needs to locate the
colors that he must use in a given
stunt and arrange them in some
advantageous order. The greater
the number of color changes the
more time this takes. The direc
tor of the cards stunts at the Big
Game was completely unaware
of this fact.

Throwing the cards as many
students did cannot bo condoned,
but after yelling and screaming
to the director of the stunts failed
to bring any results, the outcome
could not have been totally un
expected. I realize that the poor
guy probably couldn’t understand
what everyone was yelling, but
couldn’t he stop and find out?
Why didn’t one of the Rally Com.
members at the bottom of the
aisles get up and tell him? They
must have realized what was
happening. I commend Roger Sal
quist’s verbal chastisement of
those who were throwing the
cards, but couldn’t he have found
out the reason for it?
I would like to offer five sug
gestions for the improvement of
the card stunts, which would
eliminate this trouble in the fu
ture.
1) Let the Head Yell Leader
lead the stunts. He has the sup
port of the student body during
the game and this support would
carry over into the half time ac
tivities as well.
2) Someone was thoughtful
enough to have the cards made
with certain often used color
combinations, such as red and
white, on the same card. Let’s use
this to our advantage. Make as
many flips as possible be from
one side of a card to the other
side.
3) The stunts are meant to be
seen by the fans. Let’s design
them with this purpose in mind.
The gold on white ‘‘ALUMNI”
during the U.S.C. game just
couldn’t be seen from the other
side of the field. The colors used
in a stunt should contrast as
much as possible.
4) Intricate, animated designs
are not necessarily the most im
pressive. Although the computer
can design them, the students
cannot perform them swiftly and
accurately. Single words of one
color on a background of another
color are visible and effective.
Witness Cal’s ‘‘FIGHT TB.”
5) The maximum of color
changes that a student should be
expected to make during a stunt
should be two or three. Cal's
script signoff required either a
change from yellow to blue to
yellow or simply yellow to blue,
yet it was very effective as all
who saw it will agree.
I only hope LASSU will not
consider eliminating card stunts
just because of the poor perform
ance at the Big Game. They
should, however, make specific
recommendations to Rally Com.
which would improve the stunts
and lighten the students’ task in
performing them.

to bring any results, the outcome
could not have been totally un
expected. I realize that the poor
guy probably couldn’t understand
what everyone was yelling, but
couldn’t he stop and find out?
Why didn’t one of the Rally Com.
members at the bottom of the
aisles get up and tell him? They
must have realized what was
happening. I commend Roger Sal
quist’s verbal chastisement of
those who were throwing the
cards, but couldn’t he have found
out the reason for it?
I would like to offer five sug
gestions for the improvement of
the card stunts, which would
eliminate this trouble in the fu
ture.
1) Let the Head Yell Leader
lead the stunts. He has the sup
port of the student body during
the game and this support would
carry over into the half time ac
tivities as well.
2) Someone was thoughtful
enough to have the cards made
with certain often used color
combinations, such as red and
white, on the same card. Let’s use
this to our advantage. Make as
many flips as possible be from
one side of a card to the other
side.
3) The stunts are meant to be
seen by the fans. Let’s design
them with this purpose in mind.
The gold on white ‘‘ALUMNI”
during the U.S.C. game just
couldn’t be seen from the other
side of the field. The colors used
in a stunt should contrast as
much as possible.
4) Intricate, animated designs
are not necessarily the most im
pressive. Although the computer
can design them, the students
cannot perform them swiftly and
accurately. Single words of one
color on a background of another
color are visible and effective.
Witness Cal’s ‘‘FIGHT TB.”
5) The maximum of color
changes that a student should be
expected to make during a stunt
should be two or three. Cal's
script signoff required either a
change from yellow to blue to
yellow or simply yellow to blue,
yet it was very effective as all
who saw it will agree.
I only hope LASSU will not
consider eliminating card stunts
just because of the poor perform
ance at the Big Game. They
should, however, make specific
recommendations to Rally Com.
which would improve the stunts
and lighten the students’ task in
performing them.

computer to arrange the card
stunts. We all realize how much
time and effort it saves them. It
is unfortunate, however, that

The case in point, of course, is
the half-time fiasco at Berkeley

cards (sixteen colors) on his lap,
each student needs to locate the
colors that he must use in a given
stunt and arrange them in some
advantageous order. The greater
the number of color changes the

is overstepping its editorial privi
lege in condemning Kappa Alpha
Fraternity for its alleged discrim
inatory clause. The manner in
which Kappa Alpha or any other
private organization conducts its
internal affairs is not the busi
ness of The Daily.
The Daily has clearly stated its
position opposing discrimination
on several occasions. I, too, op
pose any form of discrimination,
and I would guess that most Kap
pa Alphas hold the same views,
but no one except Kappa Alpha
has any business deciding what
Kappa Alpha should do.

Editor, The Daily:
The members of Rally Com.
are very fortunate indeed to be
able to use the Burrough’s 220
computer to arrange the card
stunts. We all realize how much
time and effort it saves them. It
is unfortunate, however, that
some members of Rally Com.
consider the students in the root
ing section, who must perform
the stunts, as machines also. The
students cannot perform the
stunts with computer-like speed.
The case in point, of course, is
the half-time fiasco at Berkeley
Saturday. With a set of eight
cards (sixteen colors) on his lap,
each student needs to locate the
colors that he must use in a given
stunt and arrange them in some
advantageous order. The greater
the number of color changes the
more time this takes. The direc
tor of the cards stunts at the Big
Game was completely unaware
of this fact.

Throwing the cards as many
students did cannot bo condoned,
but after yelling and screaming
to the director of the stunts failed
to bring any results, the outcome
could not have been totally un
expected. I realize that the poor
guy probably couldn’t understand
what everyone was yelling, but
couldn’t he stop and find out?
Why didn’t one of the Rally Com.
members at the bottom of the
aisles get up and tell him? They
must have realized what was
happening. I commend Roger Sal
quist’s verbal chastisement of
those who were throwing the
cards, but couldn’t he have found
out the reason for it?
I would like to offer five sug
gestions for the improvement of
the card stunts, which would
eliminate this trouble in the fu
ture.
1) Let the Head Yell Leader
lead the stunts. He has the sup
port of the student body during
the game and this support would
carry over into the half time ac
tivities as well.
2) Someone was thoughtful
enough to have the cards made
with certain often used color
combinations, such as red and
white, on the same card. Let’s use
this to our advantage. Make as
many flips as possible be from
one side of a card to the other
side.
3) The stunts are meant to be
seen by the fans. Let’s design
them with this purpose in mind.
The gold on white ‘‘ALUMNI”
during the U.S.C. game just
couldn’t be seen from the other
side of the field. The colors used
in a stunt should contrast as
much as possible.
4) Intricate, animated designs
are not necessarily the most im
pressive. Although the computer
can design them, the students
cannot perform them swiftly and
accurately. Single words of one
color on a background of another
color are visible and effective.
Witness Cal’s ‘‘FIGHT TB.”
5) The maximum of color
changes that a student should be
expected to make during a stunt
should be two or three. Cal's
script signoff required either a
change from yellow to blue to
yellow or simply yellow to blue,
yet it was very effective as all
who saw it will agree.
I only hope LASSU will not
consider eliminating card stunts
just because of the poor perform
ance at the Big Game. They
should, however, make specific
recommendations to Rally Com.
which would improve the stunts
and lighten the students’ task in
performing them.
