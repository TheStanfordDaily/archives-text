# Wafer Poloists Lose Tourney in Finals, 7-0
## 
### 
The Stanford water polo team
was defeated by the Olympic club
7-0 in the finals of the Northern
California water polo Tourna
ment on Tuesday evening. This
was Stanford’s fifth loss, against
a final total of 16 wins, the most
in the history of the university.
The Olympic club was at full
strength for one of the few times
this season and the resulting
lineup was too powerful for the
Stanford players, who neverthe
less did not play poorly. This de
feat was the first shutout that
the Indians have suffered in three
years.
GEORGE HARRISON a bul
wark of the Olympic club, who
graduated from Stanford last
year, was named the outstanding
player of the game. Art Lambert
and goalie Chris Green also

played exceptionally well for the
champions.
The Tribe gained the final
round of the tournament on the
strength of its win over Foothill
College earlier Tuesday evening.
Stanford who had beaten Foot
hill in their two previous meet
ings, put on a strong second half
rush to win 7-4.
Coach Jim Gaughran was very
pleased with his team’s showing
this season and cited Marty Hull,
George Stransky, Don Buehler,
Bill Lorton and Pete Pettigrew
as his most valuable players.
Next year’s team will be one of
the greatest in Stanford's his
tory. Only Mike Conn and Grant
Giske will have graduated and
additional help is expected from
| two outstanding Junior College
1 transfers.
