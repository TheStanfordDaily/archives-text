# Education Not Wasted—Mead
## 
### PAT LONG 
Only a woman with “hercule
an” motivation can successfully
combine a career with marriage,
because of the demands of run
ning a suburban household, said
anthropologist Margaret Mead in
a talk at Tresidder last Wednes
day on “Women’s Multiple Role.”
Nevertheless, a college educa
tion is not wasted, Miss Mead
said, for a wife with a BA gives
a family more security than the
usually small amount of money
a husband might be able to save
as security.
PEOPLE ARK “created” two
ways, Miss Mead explained. One,
by writing a poem or discovering
a new scientific theory, and the
other by developing the minds of
people who will do these things.
A woman uses her intellectual fa
cilities and college education
when she does the latter, instead
of just producing children.
A college education also pro
vides a woman with a “portable”
skill, such as teaching or nurs
ing, which she may use anytime
during her life, she continued.
Studies show that after 15 years
women are easily able to recon
tinue studies begun in college.
WOMEN WHO quit school, she
cautioned, whether high school,
college, or graduate work, have
similar feelings of dissatisfaction.
It seems that “achieving a goal
gives a girl a sense of being a
person," she said.
Continuing to speak on per
sonality, Miss Mead said that one
“develops as a person by talking
to one’s own sex about things
that matter.” Competition over
the “Saturday night date" limits
this friendship development at
colleges, she said.
The early “marriage binge” in
the U.S. stems partially from a
lack of belief in the future, she
said. People seek not security, but
greed, she explained; they want
everything now because there is
no future. This attitude, she said,
is an aspect of slum behavior.
QUESTIONS AFTER the talk
from the mainly female audience
that filled the Tresidder lounge
included ones on divorce and al
coholism. The attitude that “no
one should put up with anything
they don’t like” causes divorce,
she said.
Alcoholism is a function of the
way a society is organized, Miss
Mead stated. The barrenness of
suburban life- no community re
sponsibilities, no deep friendships
—causes women who have never
been exposed to alcoholism to
form the “cocktail hour” habit,
and from this habit alcoholism
may develop.

ning a suburban household, said
anthropologist Margaret Mead in
a talk at Tresidder last Wednes
day on “Women’s Multiple Role.”
Nevertheless, a college educa
tion is not wasted, Miss Mead
said, for a wife with a BA gives
a family more security than the
usually small amount of money
a husband might be able to save
as security.
PEOPLE ARK “created” two
ways, Miss Mead explained. One,
by writing a poem or discovering
a new scientific theory, and the
other by developing the minds of
people who will do these things.
A woman uses her intellectual fa
cilities and college education
when she does the latter, instead
of just producing children.
A college education also pro
vides a woman with a “portable”
skill, such as teaching or nurs
ing, which she may use anytime
during her life, she continued.
Studies show that after 15 years
women are easily able to recon
tinue studies begun in college.
WOMEN WHO quit school, she
cautioned, whether high school,
college, or graduate work, have
similar feelings of dissatisfaction.
It seems that “achieving a goal
gives a girl a sense of being a
person," she said.
Continuing to speak on per
sonality, Miss Mead said that one
“develops as a person by talking
to one’s own sex about things
that matter.” Competition over
the “Saturday night date" limits
this friendship development at
colleges, she said.
The early “marriage binge” in
the U.S. stems partially from a
lack of belief in the future, she
said. People seek not security, but
greed, she explained; they want
everything now because there is
no future. This attitude, she said,
is an aspect of slum behavior.
QUESTIONS AFTER the talk
from the mainly female audience
that filled the Tresidder lounge
included ones on divorce and al
coholism. The attitude that “no
one should put up with anything
they don’t like” causes divorce,
she said.
Alcoholism is a function of the
way a society is organized, Miss
Mead stated. The barrenness of
suburban life- no community re
sponsibilities, no deep friendships
—causes women who have never
been exposed to alcoholism to
form the “cocktail hour” habit,
and from this habit alcoholism
may develop.
Only a woman with “hercule
an” motivation can successfully
combine a career with marriage,
because of the demands of run
ning a suburban household, said
anthropologist Margaret Mead in
a talk at Tresidder last Wednes
