# Curtice Praises Weaver’s Leadership, Cards' Courage
## 
### PFTE KING 
Although there was a minimum
of champagne spilling, the scene
in Stanford’s locker room Satur
day was the most boisterous of
the season, as the players cele
brated their 30 13 dismemberment
of Big Game foe, California.
The coaches pulled out all stops
in praising individuals for out
standing efforts. “You made a
proud man of me in that second
half,” said head coach Jack Cur
tice to the team when they re
turned after the game, “proud
that I had a team with the cour
age and desire to come hack after
what looked like defeat.”

OUHTICK SINGLED out quar
terback Clark Weaver for special
honors. “You can’t say too much
for him (Weaver); he is a tre
mendous leader. The little fella
did a terrific job.”

Weaver, who stands 5-10 and
weighs 180, completed nine of 11
passes for three touchdowns in
the second half. He gave a lot of
credit for his success to the quar
terback rollout-option play. “That
play is always good for five
yards,” he remarked. “It puts the
pressure on the defensive half
back. He has to go for me, or the
halfback coming around for a
possible pitchout, or the end turn
ing outside for a sideline pass.
He can’t do all three.”
End Chris lessen said that Cur
tice sent in the razzle-dazzle play
on which came Stanford's first
touchdown. On that one, lessen
lined up as a flanker-back, took a

lateral pass from Weaver,
stepped back, and lofted a pass
to end Boh Howard alone in the
end zone. “1 was supposed to
throw to iDanny) Spence on the
other side of the field,” said Jos
sen. ‘‘Howard was open, so I
threw him a high, conservative
pass."
CURTICE called it the key play
of the game, recalling that he
had used it three years ago, and
last week decided to dust it off
for Cal.
Tackle Frank Atkinson credit
ed Stanford’s defensive line
changes at halftime with slowing
the Bear attack. Cal skidded from
260 yards gained in the first half
to a measly 83 in the second.
Linebacker Ed Cummings men
tioned that Cal’s delay plays up
(he middle fooled the Indians’ de
fensive secondary. ‘‘We stunted
right out of the play in the first
I half before we adjusted,” he said.
BOTH MEN had respect for
Cal’s quarterback, Craig Morton.
| ‘‘He showed great poise in the
face of our rush.” said Atkinson.
Cummings, who intercepted a
Morton aerial to set up the In
dians’ final touchdown, praised
Morton’s accuracy, but added
that his soft passes were easier
to intercept than most.
Curtice, asked to compare
Weaver to All-American Lee
Grosscup, wTiom he coached at
Utah before coming here, seemed
to think that Weaver was better.
“Clark can’t pass as well,” said
the coach, “but he is a much bet
ter runner.”
