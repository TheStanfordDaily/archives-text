# Cal Coach Dejected over Poor Season, Final Big Game Loss to Stanford
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Marv Levy was a tired, misera
ble man yesterday. His Golden
Bears had just been trounced 30-
13 by a Stanford team that ap
peared thoroughly beaten after
trailing 13-3 at the half.
A lightly-regarded, soft-throw
ing quarterback named Clark
Weaver had turned what appear
ed certain victory into an igno
minious defeat for the Bears and
Levy had to find a reason for it.
Not only did he have to explain
it to the working press, which
was gathered in a Cal dressing
room, hut also to UC students
waiting by the balcony outside
the dressing room. Finally, he
had to say a few words to his
team; a team which had lost nine
of ten games despite one of the
most brilliant passing records in
the country.

LEVY CLOSED the Cal locker
room to the press for 15 minutes
immediately after the Bears loft
the field. “I merely made an
nouncements about award din
ners coming up. and believe me
they deserve awards,” said Levy,
To the rooters assembled outside,
Levy said his thanks for their
support, and praised Stanford’s
second half offense. Coming back
from the balcony scene. Levy
said to the reporters waiting for
him, ‘‘This was the most misei’-
able day I ever spent in my life.”
Levy called the game’s turning

point the Stanford drive for a
quick score immediately after the
second half kickoff. “We should
have stopped them, but instead
they moved for 80 yards and got
back in the ball game.”
( HAIG MORTON, interviewed
after the game, said that he
wasn’t playing his best game for
60 minutes, and added his doubt
that anyone in the Cal lineup was
playing a full 60 minutes of all
out football.

Levy concluded, “You live for
this one the entire year. You hope
you can redeem the season with
a big smash against Stanford.”
Obviously they couldn’t, and
didn’t. It was another long sea
son for Levy, but with his new
contract, he’ll have at least two
more long ones.

you can redeem the season with
a big smash against Stanford.”
Obviously they couldn’t, and
didn’t. It was another long sea
son for Levy, but with his new
contract, he’ll have at least two
more long ones.
Marv Levy was a tired, misera
ble man yesterday. His Golden
Bears had just been trounced 30-
13 by a Stanford team that ap
peared thoroughly beaten after
trailing 13-3 at the half.
A lightly-regarded, soft-throw
ing quarterback named Clark
Weaver had turned what appear
ed certain victory into an igno
minious defeat for the Bears and
Levy had to find a reason for it.
Not only did he have to explain
it to the working press, which
was gathered in a Cal dressing
room, hut also to UC students
waiting by the balcony outside
the dressing room. Finally, he
had to say a few words to his
team; a team which had lost nine
of ten games despite one of the
most brilliant passing records in
the country.

LEVY CLOSED the Cal locker
room to the press for 15 minutes
immediately after the Bears loft
the field. “I merely made an
nouncements about award din
ners coming up. and believe me
they deserve awards,” said Levy,
To the rooters assembled outside,
Levy said his thanks for their
support, and praised Stanford’s
second half offense. Coming back
from the balcony scene. Levy
said to the reporters waiting for
him, ‘‘This was the most misei’-
able day I ever spent in my life.”
Levy called the game’s turning

point the Stanford drive for a
quick score immediately after the
second half kickoff. “We should
have stopped them, but instead
they moved for 80 yards and got
back in the ball game.”
( HAIG MORTON, interviewed
after the game, said that he
wasn’t playing his best game for
60 minutes, and added his doubt
that anyone in the Cal lineup was
playing a full 60 minutes of all
out football.

Levy concluded, “You live for
this one the entire year. You hope
you can redeem the season with
a big smash against Stanford.”
Obviously they couldn’t, and
