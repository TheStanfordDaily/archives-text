# San Jose State to Begin Campus FM Broadcasts
## 
### 
San Jose State College hopes
to listen to its own FM radio sta
tion, KSJS, by December 3.
Recently, an omnidirectional
antenna was installed 130 feet
above the campus atop the li
brary. The antenna will transmit
in a 10-mile radius, which will
reach Redwood City on the north,
and Morgan Hill on the south.
Plans were made three years
ago to establish an FM station
on the San Jose State campus
after a poll was taken of poten
tial listeners. Results showed that
25 per cent of the students at
that time owned FM sets, while
another 25 per cent had access to
such sets.
