# Black Predicts Increase In Scholastic Pressures
## 
### 
College campuses, like their sur
rounding society, are becoming
centers of intense emotional
stress and pressure, John D.
Black, director of Stanford’s
Counseling and Testing Center,
told the Pacific Coast College
Health Association, at a meeting
November 20.
"If I read the signs right, we’re
in for a vastly increasing mental
health problem in our colleges
and universities,” Black observed.
Black believes that the pres
sure to achieve intellectually be
gins in elementary school when
students realize how hard it is to
obtain admission to college. The
pressure does not end when the
student is finally accepted to a
college. For many students, the
problem is not simply to obtain
A.B. degrees but to qualify for
graduate or professional schools.
Twenty years ago. Black noted,
students who studied got good
grades. Today everybody studies,
but the grading curve has not
changed. The result is intense
competition, more temptation to
succeed by hook or crook, and
more hostility and anxiety. To
quit school or flunk out are as
unacceptable as a dishonorable
discharge from the service or a
felony conviction, Black added.
Black is convinced that the
pressures are equally great for
the faculty. Not only are brighter
students a challenge and a threat,
but also faculties are under groat
compulsion to do research and to
publish.
As faculty and administration
become more harried and stu
dents more serious and concern
ed, Black predicts that the po
tential for unhealthy conflict be
tween them will increase. “Boys
will bo boysi hut when obviously
bright students criticize teaching
or demand membership on uni
versity committees, the potential
ly constructive expressions of ad
olescent energy tread on sensi
tive toes,” he concluded.
