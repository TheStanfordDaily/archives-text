PARIS President Charles de Gaulle yesterday won the largest
percentage of parliamentary seats in French history and gained a
strong majority in the National Assembly with the help of his allies.
Final official returns for 4715 of the 482 seats gave de Gaulle’s
Union for the New Republic (UNR) 233 scats, just 9 short of a
majority in its own right.
TROOPS SUPPRESS AIR FORCE REVOLT— GUATEMALA CITY,
Guatemala -Troops loyal to President Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes put
down an air force revolt yesterday after three hours of fierce air-to
ground fighting. The government blamed the revolt on “Castro
Communists.” At least two civilians were killed, and scores were
injured.
The presidency announced that the three principal chiefs of the
abortive revolt fled by airplane, probably to El Salvador.
