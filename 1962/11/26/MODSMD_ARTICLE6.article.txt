# Beim Reviews African Project

“Suddenly you are experiencing
Africa. It’s no longer what you
read about in a paper; it’s a liv
ing, breathing thing,” Dave Beim,
member of last year’s Crossroads
Africa group, summed up his
African experience. “All the facts
you’ve learned become alive and
are brought into focus by real ex
perience.”
Beim and nine other students
four men and five women, spent
two months working with Afri
cans in Bouake, second largest
town in Ivory Coast. “Just know
ing the Americans in the group
was an enlightening experience,
for they came from varied back
grounds and represented all po
litical persuasions including so
cialism and pacifism.
AFTER ARRIVING in Bouake
and spending a week acquainting
themselves with the city, the ton
students received their work as
signment for the summer, given
by the Ivory Coast government,
not by Crossroads itself. Al
though it is hoped that the work
will be socially useful (such as
the construction of a school), the
most important aspect of the ex
perience is personal contact with
the group of African students
with whom the Americans work
and live. The key phrase for
Crossroads reflects its purpose—
“person to person relationship in
depth.”
“The people possessed enor

mous goodwill and were more
than hospitable,” stated Beim.
These people which Crossroads’
students met included African
student leaders, government per
sonnel, merchants, villagers and
their tribal chiefs. “Wo wore able
to form a comprehensive picture
of the African people through
meeting people from all levels,”
continued Beim.

BEIM SAID lie felt that
through Crossroads ho had met
an Africa less formidable and
more enthusiastic than he had
imagined. ‘'We ended the summer
with a two-week trip to Ghana,
as every group travels in a coun
try other than its assigned one;
we still remained close to the peo
ple. for we stayed in universities
and were in constant contact with
African students, students who
were very friendly and very
frank.”

In summary Beim explained,
“I have always preferred my sum
mers to be an extension of my
education rather than a break
from it. Crossroads Africa gave
me an education such as Stan
ford could never provide, for this
is the only way a student of Stan
ford ago can know Africa inti
mately.”

Beim and two other Crossroads
students, Tom Boysen and Pete
Schmidt will give a panel dis
cussion tomorrow at 4:30 in Tre
sidder. At this time application
forms will be available; they will
also be available in the HR loft
in Tresidder. This year marks the
first time that Stanford will be
a co-operating institution and has
a committment of at least five
and up to ten students, so that
students are advised to return ap
plications as soon as possible.
