# Stanford Beats Cal 30-13 in Big Game To Keep the Stanford Axe on the Farm
## Onslaught in Second Half Brings Victory 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Clark Weaver entered on the
scene in the second half Saturday
with a new script written by Jack
Curtice, and there ensued an ec
static Big Game second act, end
ing in a 30-13 finale. At least, for
the Stanford half of the crowd of
72,700 at Berkeley’s Memorial
Stadium it was ecstatic.
During those final 30 minutes
of the 1962 football season, the
Indians reached their peak of of
fensive and defensive proficiency.
They scored 27 points, more than
their highest total in any previ
ous complete game and netted
292 yards. Meanwhile they held
Cal’s passing attack, the eighth
most productive in the country,
to 67 yards and seven comple
tions in 20 attempts (they were
greatly aided in this accomplish
ment by Cal’s loss of Bill Turner,
its top receiver, who caught eight

passes before a knee injury
slopped him In the third quar
ter); and allowed only 16 yards
rushing by the Bear ground game
which had made 152 yards in the
first half.
FOK CAL, the defeat was par
ticularly disappointing. Playing
some of the nation’s gridiron gi
ants all year, the Bears’ best had
only been good enough to make
most of their eight previous
losses respectable. When they
won the first half Saturday by a
convincing 13-3, hcWever, it
looked like they had finally found
a major college team their own
size and were bound for a win in
the game they had most been
looking forward to all season.
The Bears had started the game
gaining tremendously on runs up
the middle, where Stanford’s de
fensive strength was supposed to
lie; they surprised the Indians at
that time with counter-runs, i.e.,
sending the ball carrier in the op
posite direction from which the
quarterback was rolling out.

Later, Cal’s heralded sophomore
passer, Craig Morton, picked
apart the Cards’ secondary, com
pleting nine of 14 for two touch
downs.
But souped-up by the fire water
Curtice served at half time and
by some devilish trickery he had
planned during the pre-game
week, the Indians became the
equal of any of Cal’s previous
opponents and took as little time
as possible in vanquishing the
Bears; less than five minutes in
to the fourth quarter, the out
come was determined.
BESIDES the appearance of
Weaver, a change in Stanford
was evident immediately after
the kickoff. On the first play,

gained nine of Stanford’s grand
first half total of 64 yards rush
