# Stanford Beats Cal 30-13 in Big Game To Keep the Stanford Axe on the Farm
## Onslaught in Second Half Brings Victory 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Clark Weaver entered on the
scene in the second half Saturday
with a new script written by Jack
Curtice, and there ensued an ec
static Big Game second act, end
ing in a 30-13 finale. At least, for
the Stanford half of the crowd of
72,700 at Berkeley’s Memorial
Stadium it was ecstatic.
During those final 30 minutes
of the 1962 football season, the
Indians reached their peak of of
fensive and defensive proficiency.
They scored 27 points, more than
their highest total in any previ
ous complete game and netted
292 yards. Meanwhile they held
Cal’s passing attack, the eighth
most productive in the country,
to 67 yards and seven comple
tions in 20 attempts (they were
greatly aided in this accomplish
ment by Cal’s loss of Bill Turner,
its top receiver, who caught eight

passes before a knee injury
slopped him In the third quar
ter); and allowed only 16 yards
rushing by the Bear ground game
which had made 152 yards in the
first half.
FOK CAL, the defeat was par
ticularly disappointing. Playing
some of the nation’s gridiron gi
ants all year, the Bears’ best had
only been good enough to make
most of their eight previous
losses respectable. When they
won the first half Saturday by a
convincing 13-3, hcWever, it
looked like they had finally found
a major college team their own
size and were bound for a win in
the game they had most been
looking forward to all season.
The Bears had started the game
gaining tremendously on runs up
the middle, where Stanford’s de
fensive strength was supposed to
lie; they surprised the Indians at
that time with counter-runs, i.e.,
sending the ball carrier in the op
posite direction from which the
quarterback was rolling out.

Later, Cal’s heralded sophomore
passer, Craig Morton, picked
apart the Cards’ secondary, com
pleting nine of 14 for two touch
downs.
But souped-up by the fire water
Curtice served at half time and
by some devilish trickery he had
planned during the pre-game
week, the Indians became the
equal of any of Cal’s previous
opponents and took as little time
as possible in vanquishing the
Bears; less than five minutes in
to the fourth quarter, the out
come was determined.
BESIDES the appearance of
Weaver, a change in Stanford
was evident immediately after
the kickoff. On the first play,

left end for a gain of 17 yards.
In the next nine plays Stanford
drove steadily on the ground to
Cal’s 25, where they were faced
with their first difficult yardage
situation, a third down and six
play. It looked like a screen pass
was developing as flanker Chris
Jessen dropped back to take a
pass about five yards from the
sideline with three blockers in
front. But SURPRISE —that pass
from Weaver had been a lateral,
and there was Jessen poised to
throw' a forward pass and there
was end Bob Howard on the five
yard line, about as unattended as
a skunk at a formal dance. It
didn’t take much imagination to
see the grin on Coach Curtice’s
face as the ball settled into How
ard’s arms for Stanford’s second
touchdown pass of the year and
Weaver’s first.

Having drawn up to 9-13, there
was still the problem of stopping
Cal. But one smothering Ed Cum
mings tackle and two blocked
passed by Cummings and Frank
Dubofsky forced Cal to punt.

STARTING FROM its own 31,
Stanford then drove the neces
sary 69 yards in nine plays, again
under Weaver’s direction. This
time the 5-9 quarterback mixed
some passes with his standard ar
ray of runs; he completed three
for-three, including a 12-yarder to
Jessen for the TD; Stanford led
16-13.

Along with his execution,
Weaver’s choice of plays on these
(wo touchdown drives was excel
lent. He exhibited a complete
mastery of the Indians’ reper
toire, keeping the defense off bal
ance by alternating Lodato. half
back John Paye, or fullback Ken
Babajian running at the interior
of the line, calling a pitchout or
a wide run with Lodato or Wea
ver himself carrying, and mixing
in an occasional pass. The half
back pass by lessen was the coup
de grace.

However, Cal started to drive
toward a go-ahead score. Starting
from the seven whore Braden
Beck’s long, high kickoff had set
up a Cummings tackle, Morton
directed and passed the Bears to
their own 38. But Frank Patituc
ci, who had just been named to
the All-AAWU defensive team,
personally took care of this drive.
Crashing from his right end po
sition on the first play of the
fourth period, he blitzed Morton
from behind, causing a fumble
which Marv Harris recovered for
Stanford on Cal’s 44.
WEAVER assumed control
again and guided the Tribe, most
ly through the air, to its third
touchdown, which made it 23-13.
When Patitucci made his second
consecutive eight-yard reception,
in the end zone, “Br’er Bar” was

really on his hack pawing the air
helplessly.
But, Stanford was not finished
yet. Four minutes later, Cum
mings intercepted a Morton pass
on Cal’s 44 and ran it back 15
yards, his final accomplishment
of the afternoon on a list of feats
that earned him the Back of the
Game honor. Weaver soon got
his fourth TD pass by throwing
18 yards to Howard, who had beat
his defender by three steps; if
was Weaver's ninth completion
in 11 attempts. When Stan Lind
skog followed with his sixth
point of the day (three conver
sion kicks and a 29-yard field
goal), Stanford then had 30
points, the most it has scored in
a Big Game since 1930.
Although Weaver (unanimous
ly voted the Back of the Game)
and Cummings received individu
al recognition, a good twenty
five players contributed vitally to
Stanford’s effort. Ends How'ard
and Patitucci, already acclaimed
for their offensive work, together
with Steve Pursell and Guy
Rounsaville, were a valuable and
aggressive corps of defensive
ends; they continually pressured
Morton on passing attempts in
the second half, sometimes pur
suing him all the way across the
field on rollouts.
The defensive backfiold of
Gary Sargent, Dick Ragsdale,
Jim Shroyer. and Tim Hansel,
switched to a man-to-man defense
in the second half and clung to
their men like ivy on a fence,
knocked several passes awry and
made a total of 22 tackles.
In the offensive backfield, Lo
dato had his best day. gaining 95
yards in 19 carries. Babajian
made some beautiful blocks to
lead interference on wide runs
and give Stanford passers protec
tion. The line, too, provided good
pass protection all day and open-

Ed up running room in the second
half, particularly between guard
and center.
Even quarterback Steve Thur
low, the forgotten man in Wea
ver’s glory, did well. He engineer
ed a first-quarter 22-yard drive
which ended in a field goal and
was Stanford's second best
rusher.
