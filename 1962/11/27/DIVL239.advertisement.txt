ANNOUNCING THE 1963-1964
AFFLERBACH FELLOWSHIPS*
BACKGROUND OF THE COMPETITION: No matter how much time our People in
Naming spend thinking up just the right color names for our shirts (Maize, Stone Green,
Peat Blue, etc.), the Eagle Secret Shoppers inevitably report that you choose your Eagle shirts
with such statements as “Gimme six of them greenish ones” or “Could I bother you for two
or three dozen of those stri-ped ones.” Our problem is in selecting names which will capture
the imagination of the shirt-buying public. NATURE OF THE COMPETITION:
The 10 Afflerbachs for 1963-64 will go to those persons suggesting the best names for our
colors. Imagination-capturing names, like Well Red, Long Green, Charlie Brown, or Navel
Orange. You may wish to inspect our shirts -for inspiration, if not purchase. Eagle shirts don’t
always have an Eagle label—some fine stores sew in their own— but if you write us, we’ll
suggest your nearest Eagle Shirt Color Inspection Station. STIPEND: The grand prize
winner will have his (or her) choice of a Traveling Afflerbach (a grand all-expense-paid weekend
at the Bush House in Quakertown—an exciting chance to become acquainted with the natives
many of whom are us, including Miss Revera Afflerbach, herself) or a Stationary Afflerbach
(a dozen Eagle Button-down shirts). The 9 other Afflerbachs will consist of a grant of four
Eagle Button-down shirts. Each, that is. RULES: The competition is open to all students
and faculty members at schools, as well as to those who have filled in the coupon below,
/
•This, actually, is Eagle’s second competition in as many years. Those of you who partook of the first, that is, what to do
with the pocket on a Shirtkerchief, will doubtless be excited to learn that the book containing many of your letters to Miss
Afflerbach has now been published by the Macmillan Co. and is now available at your bookseller. We have called it Dear
Miss Afflerbach, or The Postman Hardly Ever Rings 11,342 Times, and the price is $4.95.

ANNOUNCING THE 1963-1964
AFFLERBACH FELLOWSHIPS*
BACKGROUND OF THE COMPETITION: No matter how much time our People in
Naming spend thinking up just the right color names for our shirts (Maize, Stone Green,
Peat Blue, etc.), the Eagle Secret Shoppers inevitably report that you choose your Eagle shirts
with such statements as “Gimme six of them greenish ones” or “Could I bother you for two
or three dozen of those stri-ped ones.” Our problem is in selecting names which will capture
the imagination of the shirt-buying public. NATURE OF THE COMPETITION:
The 10 Afflerbachs for 1963-64 will go to those persons suggesting the best names for our
colors. Imagination-capturing names, like Well Red, Long Green, Charlie Brown, or Navel
Orange. You may wish to inspect our shirts -for inspiration, if not purchase. Eagle shirts don’t
always have an Eagle label—some fine stores sew in their own— but if you write us, we’ll
suggest your nearest Eagle Shirt Color Inspection Station. STIPEND: The grand prize
winner will have his (or her) choice of a Traveling Afflerbach (a grand all-expense-paid weekend
at the Bush House in Quakertown—an exciting chance to become acquainted with the natives
many of whom are us, including Miss Revera Afflerbach, herself) or a Stationary Afflerbach
(a dozen Eagle Button-down shirts). The 9 other Afflerbachs will consist of a grant of four
Eagle Button-down shirts. Each, that is. RULES: The competition is open to all students
and faculty members at schools, as well as to those who have filled in the coupon below,

Afflerbach has now been published by the Macmillan Co. and is now available at your bookseller. We have called it Dear
