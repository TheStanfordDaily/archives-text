# 570 Student Hashers Fill University Need
## 
### SANDRA SIMS 
Student hashers fill a definite
need of the University, says Mrs.
Dorothy O. Bell, Director of Uni
versity Food Services. She esti
mated the total number of hash
ers at about 570.
Each year about 50 incoming
freshmen are awarded hashing
jobs as part of their freshman
scholarships, said Mrs. Bell. If
the need continues these jobs can
be retained throughout the re
maining undergraduate years,
barring incidents which make it
either impossible or inadvisable
to continue hashing.
Vacancies are filled from a
group of students who have ap
plied for hashing jobs at the Uni
versity Food Service in Encina
Hall. Mrs. Bell estimated that
there are about 200-220 on this
waiting list, about 30 of whom
are placed each quarter.
STUDENTS applying for hash
ing jobs are grouped into four
categories according to need,
Mrs. Bell said. When openings
occur, her office tries to place
those with the most critical need

I first, but this is not always pos-
I sible, she said.“ The most deserv
ing applicant whose activity
schedule permits him to work at
the necessary hours is given the
job.
Besides the hashers who actual
ly serve the food, there are many
who are never or seldom seen at
work by the students w'hom they
are serving. These include dish
washers, table seders, those who
assist in preparing and setting
j the food out for easy pick-up by
the servers, and others, said Mrs.
j Bell.
Of these hashers, 420 work for
| full board, which usually means
j they work at all three meals
j every day, with meals “off” de
| pending on the variance of need
j in the dining room in which they
! work, Mrs. Bell explained. All
j hashers in Ruble and Lagunita
are under this system, since all
meals are served there, she said.
IN BRANNEB, Florence Moore,
! Wilbur, Stern, Encina, and the
Row Houses, some hashers work
three meals, but. others work two
meals, usually dinners, which are
“sit-down’ and require more
hashers than cafeteria service, for

one-third of their board, she said.
There are also 35 hashers at
Tresidder, who work on a cash
basis, but are placed through her
office, Mrs. Bell added.
Besides hashers, the Universi
ty Food Services employs many
people who are necessary to pre
pare 32 meals a week for Stan
ford students, Mrs. 801 l said.
These include cooks, bakers, sal
ad makers, and porters, among
others.
THEBE ARE !1 Food Service
Directors in the various Universi
ty dining halls, each of whom has
an assistant, she said. Each of
these has a Master’s degree in
dietetics, usually with emphasis
on institutional management,
plus a year of internship in the
dietetics division of a hospital.
Tlie University Food Service is
highly organized to efficiently
fill the needs of the students,
Mrs. Bell said. In addition to the
preparation and serving of the
meals at University dining halls,
the Food Service can also provide
catering for social functions and
advice to anyone who needs help
with menus, what to buy and
where to buy it, she added.

there are about 200-220 on this
waiting list, about 30 of whom
are placed each quarter.
STUDENTS applying for hash
ing jobs are grouped into four
categories according to need,
Mrs. Bell said. When openings
occur, her office tries to place
those with the most critical need

I first, but this is not always pos-
I sible, she said.“ The most deserv
ing applicant whose activity
schedule permits him to work at
the necessary hours is given the
job.
Besides the hashers who actual
ly serve the food, there are many
who are never or seldom seen at
work by the students w'hom they
are serving. These include dish
washers, table seders, those who
assist in preparing and setting
j the food out for easy pick-up by
the servers, and others, said Mrs.
j Bell.
Of these hashers, 420 work for
| full board, which usually means
j they work at all three meals
j every day, with meals “off” de
| pending on the variance of need
j in the dining room in which they
! work, Mrs. Bell explained. All
j hashers in Ruble and Lagunita
are under this system, since all
meals are served there, she said.
IN BRANNEB, Florence Moore,
! Wilbur, Stern, Encina, and the
Row Houses, some hashers work
three meals, but. others work two
meals, usually dinners, which are
“sit-down’ and require more
hashers than cafeteria service, for

one-third of their board, she said.
There are also 35 hashers at
Tresidder, who work on a cash
basis, but are placed through her
office, Mrs. Bell added.
Besides hashers, the Universi
ty Food Services employs many
people who are necessary to pre
pare 32 meals a week for Stan
ford students, Mrs. 801 l said.
These include cooks, bakers, sal
ad makers, and porters, among
others.

an assistant, she said. Each of
these has a Master’s degree in
dietetics, usually with emphasis
on institutional management,
plus a year of internship in the
dietetics division of a hospital.
Tlie University Food Service is
highly organized to efficiently
fill the needs of the students,
Mrs. Bell said. In addition to the
