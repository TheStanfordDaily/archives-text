# No Decision Announced On Curtice's Status Yet
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Contrary to a wealth of speculation, no official action has been
taken yet on the status of head football coach Jack Curtice.
A1 Masters, the director of athletics at Stanford, has the au
thority to renew or let expire Curtice’s current contract. Masters
talked to Curtice yesterday concerning such a decision, but said

that no official statement on the*
decision will be released until this
morning.
Curtice also refrained from
commenting on the talk. “I’m
leaving the announcements up to
Al; that’s the agreement we
made.”
IT IS CERTAIN, however, that
the decision has already been
reached and is wailing only to be
drafted into an official statement.
“I don’t like to hold a story,”
Masters said, “but with such an
important decision, so vital to
such a large number of people. I
want to be sure no mistakes are
made. There are a few clarifica
tions to be worked out before I

can say anything.”
Although Curtice’s contract
does not expire until February 1,
“with all the heat and pressure
raised over this issue,” Masters
continued, “some decision has to
be made now. He (Curtice) has a
right to know what our plans are.
I wanted to wait ’till the end of
the football season, though.”
CONCERNING stories yester
day in the San Francisco Exam
iner and the Palo Alto Times and
on local radio, claiming that Cur
tice’s fate is already sealed, Mas
ters said, “They are just specu
lations.”
Don Selby’s story in the Exam
iner, based on a reliable source,
claimed Curtice would be notified
of his dismissal some time yes
terday morning.
IN HIS STORY in the Times,
Sports Editior Walt Gamage ad
mitted that there was no official
word yet through either Masters
or Assistant Director of Athletics
Chuck Taylor. He based his pre
diction, however, on a decision by
university president J. E. Wallace
Sterling, “made several weeks
ago, and “learned from an au
thoritative source.”
Masters has not been confer
ring with the president, though.
“I haven’t talked to President
Sterling; I assume that I have
authority as athletic director to
make this decision,” he said.
In reaction to a story out of
Los Angeles reporting that Stan
ford alumni had contacted Navy
coach Bud Hardin about suc
ceeding Curtice possibly, Masters
said, “They had no authority to
do such a thing. It was Win
Wedge, a former Stanford foot
ball player, who is a personal
friend of Hardin, who talked to
him after the Navy-USC game
two weeks ago.”
MASTERS REVEALED that
the nine-member Board of Ath
letic Control, composed of alumni,
faculty, and students, would have
no part in the final decision.
"The Board’s last meeting was
last Friday and their next one is
not scheduled yet. They did not
discuss Curtice’s contract at the
last meeting.”
Masters’ phone line was mighty
busy yesterday. “Everyone is
calling me with their recom
mendation for the new coach—in
case we decide to go that way.”

university president J. E. Wallace
Sterling, “made several weeks
ago, and “learned from an au
thoritative source.”
Masters has not been confer
ring with the president, though.
“I haven’t talked to President
Sterling; I assume that I have
authority as athletic director to
make this decision,” he said.
In reaction to a story out of
Los Angeles reporting that Stan
ford alumni had contacted Navy
coach Bud Hardin about suc
ceeding Curtice possibly, Masters
said, “They had no authority to
do such a thing. It was Win
Wedge, a former Stanford foot
ball player, who is a personal
friend of Hardin, who talked to
him after the Navy-USC game
two weeks ago.”
MASTERS REVEALED that
the nine-member Board of Ath
letic Control, composed of alumni,
faculty, and students, would have
no part in the final decision.
"The Board’s last meeting was
last Friday and their next one is
not scheduled yet. They did not
discuss Curtice’s contract at the
last meeting.”
Masters’ phone line was mighty
busy yesterday. “Everyone is
calling me with their recom
mendation for the new coach—in
case we decide to go that way.”


HEAD FOOTBALL COACH Jack Curtice has refrained from comment
ing on his talk yesterday with Athletic Director Al Masters. Masters
has released no decision on Curtice's contract.
Contrary to a wealth of speculation, no official action has been
taken yet on the status of head football coach Jack Curtice.
A1 Masters, the director of athletics at Stanford, has the au
thority to renew or let expire Curtice’s current contract. Masters
talked to Curtice yesterday concerning such a decision, but said

that no official statement on the*
decision will be released until this
morning.
Curtice also refrained from
commenting on the talk. “I’m
leaving the announcements up to
Al; that’s the agreement we
made.”
IT IS CERTAIN, however, that
the decision has already been
reached and is wailing only to be
drafted into an official statement.
“I don’t like to hold a story,”
Masters said, “but with such an
important decision, so vital to
such a large number of people. I
want to be sure no mistakes are
made. There are a few clarifica
tions to be worked out before I

can say anything.”
Although Curtice’s contract
does not expire until February 1,
“with all the heat and pressure
raised over this issue,” Masters
continued, “some decision has to
be made now. He (Curtice) has a
right to know what our plans are.
I wanted to wait ’till the end of
the football season, though.”
CONCERNING stories yester
day in the San Francisco Exam
iner and the Palo Alto Times and
on local radio, claiming that Cur
tice’s fate is already sealed, Mas
ters said, “They are just specu
lations.”
Don Selby’s story in the Exam
iner, based on a reliable source,
claimed Curtice would be notified
of his dismissal some time yes
terday morning.
IN HIS STORY in the Times,
Sports Editior Walt Gamage ad
mitted that there was no official
word yet through either Masters
or Assistant Director of Athletics
Chuck Taylor. He based his pre
diction, however, on a decision by
university president J. E. Wallace
Sterling, “made several weeks
