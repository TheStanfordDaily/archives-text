# CONCERT REVIEW
## Oakland Symphony Orchestra Gives Spirited Performance 
### WALTER MOORE 
The Oakland Symphony Or
chestra attracted a capacity au
dience to Memorial Auditorium
Sunday afternoon. This was their
third appearance in as many sea
sons, and it speaks well for both
(he orchestra and the ASSU con
cert series management that they
are welcome guests to the Stan
ford area.

Sunday’s program demonstrat
ed once again the general level of
excellence maintained by Ger
hard Samuel in his three years
as musical director. Considering
the limited amount of rehearsal
time and heterogeneous talents
involved, Samuel has achieved a
remarkable balance and flexibili
ty among his players. There are
still intonation problems in the
winds and brass, cautious en
trances from the strings, and
rhythmic uncertainties through
out which prevent this group
from becoming a truly distin
guished ensemble.

The most serious evaluation of
the orchestra and conductor lies
in that mystic realm concerning
musical communication and style.
There was for example a notice
able lack of rhythmic buoyancy
and effervescence in the execu
tion of the Mozart A major Sym
phony K. 291. The ingratiating
give and lake between voices, the
lyricism of the aria, the sparkle
and finesse which characterize
definitive Mozart were lost in
this generally plodding atmos
phere of relaxed tempi and
square phrasing. The same com

ments might well apply to the
“Freischuetz” Overture of Weber
which preceded it on the pro
gram; a performance of subdued
ardency and poetry.
The “Orchestral Variations’’ of
Aaron Copland was the modern
work on the program. An orches
tral transcription made in 1957
of his highly-regarded Piano
Variations (1930), it employs the
full complement of orchestral
personnel to release its imagina
tive and exciting combinations
of sounds. This is a work of su
perbly controlled sonorities, tex
tures, and figurations which, de
spite the often ragged perform
ance, revealed itself as a distin
guished musical creation.
Soloist of the day was Ruggi
ero Ricci who offered a well-con
sidered and often provocative
performance of the Brahms vio
lin concerto. There was some un
evenness in his sound and intona
tion, but a personal eloquence
and individual temperament
made themselves apparent. The
cadenza to the first movement
and the exquisite measures imme
diately following were projected
with great dramatic flair and a
compassionate understanding of
the musical line and phrase.
Samuel accompanied with his ac
customed sensitivity but would
have done better by Brahms had
he assumed the soloist’s and not
his own faster tempi in the or
chestral introductions to the first
and second movements. In toto,
a good performance which con
cluded an often interesting pro
gram in spirited fashion.

full complement of orchestral
personnel to release its imagina
tive and exciting combinations
of sounds. This is a work of su
perbly controlled sonorities, tex
tures, and figurations which, de
spite the often ragged perform
ance, revealed itself as a distin
guished musical creation.
Soloist of the day was Ruggi
ero Ricci who offered a well-con
sidered and often provocative
performance of the Brahms vio
lin concerto. There was some un
evenness in his sound and intona
tion, but a personal eloquence
and individual temperament
made themselves apparent. The
cadenza to the first movement
and the exquisite measures imme
diately following were projected
with great dramatic flair and a
compassionate understanding of
the musical line and phrase.
Samuel accompanied with his ac
customed sensitivity but would
have done better by Brahms had
he assumed the soloist’s and not
his own faster tempi in the or
chestral introductions to the first
and second movements. In toto,
a good performance which con
cluded an often interesting pro
gram in spirited fashion.
The Oakland Symphony Or
chestra attracted a capacity au
dience to Memorial Auditorium
Sunday afternoon. This was their
third appearance in as many sea
sons, and it speaks well for both
(he orchestra and the ASSU con
cert series management that they
are welcome guests to the Stan
ford area.

Sunday’s program demonstrat
ed once again the general level of
excellence maintained by Ger
hard Samuel in his three years
as musical director. Considering
the limited amount of rehearsal
time and heterogeneous talents
involved, Samuel has achieved a
remarkable balance and flexibili
ty among his players. There are
still intonation problems in the
winds and brass, cautious en
trances from the strings, and
rhythmic uncertainties through
out which prevent this group
from becoming a truly distin
guished ensemble.

The most serious evaluation of
the orchestra and conductor lies
in that mystic realm concerning
musical communication and style.
There was for example a notice
able lack of rhythmic buoyancy
and effervescence in the execu
tion of the Mozart A major Sym
phony K. 291. The ingratiating
give and lake between voices, the
lyricism of the aria, the sparkle
and finesse which characterize
definitive Mozart were lost in
this generally plodding atmos
phere of relaxed tempi and
square phrasing. The same com

ments might well apply to the
“Freischuetz” Overture of Weber
which preceded it on the pro
gram; a performance of subdued
ardency and poetry.
The “Orchestral Variations’’ of
Aaron Copland was the modern
work on the program. An orches
tral transcription made in 1957
of his highly-regarded Piano
Variations (1930), it employs the
full complement of orchestral
personnel to release its imagina
tive and exciting combinations
of sounds. This is a work of su
perbly controlled sonorities, tex
tures, and figurations which, de
