# RECORD REVIEW
## Peggy Seeger As Renowned As Brother Pete in Britain 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
Pete Seeger is undoubtedly
America's best-known folk singer
and, some would say, its best. But
in England, Pete is referred to
and introduced as “Peggy See
ger’s brother.” For 27-year-old
Peggy has become the most re
nowned representative of Ameri
ca in Britain’s present outburst of
folk music activity.
Although Peggy Seeger ad
heres strictly to her American
song repertoire, she has become a
part of England. She has married
Britain’s great folk interpreter
Ewan McColl, has taken English
citizenship, and now lives in a
suburb of London. But her re
turns to the United States are en
thusiastically welcomed; and in
Seeger family concerts, even
brother Pete must sometimes
take a back-seat to Peggy.
PEGGY SEEGER has recorded
widely for Folkways, Folk-Lyric,
Vanguard, and Riverside, but per
haps her most representative al
bum is Prestige-International’s
“The Best of Peggy Seeger” (INT
33005). The album gives one a
strong impression of her inher
ently happy voice—an impression
that is reinforced by her child
like face. One can imagine her
singing “Children’s Medley” or
“The Chickens They Are Crow
ing” to a ring of delighted in
fants.
Peggy Seeger’s sense of win
der emerges in “Oh. Watch the
Stars.” But she is also capable of
the mordant social satire for
which both her brother and hus
band are noted. And she can elic
it the pathos inherent in a tragic
ballad like “Young Collins.”
Peggy’s instrumental style is a

remarkable blend of classical and
country. It is a fit vehicle for her
voice—effective without becom
ing showy or musically pedantic.
Defending eclectic instrumenta
tion in the notes to the present
album, she says that every pres
ent-day urban singer passes
through a stage “during which
he flits, musically speaking, from
one song genre to another . . .
and out of this experience, if the
singer is a creative one, will come
a personal style which will of
necessity be an amalgam of the
musical stages through which he
has passed, however mutually op
posed they may have been.”
PEGGY SEEGER’S style seems
to have arisen from exposure to a
wide range of native American
genres from the cradle onward.
Her father, Charles Seeger, was
a world-renowned pioneer folk
musicologist: her mother was a
concert-pianist and composer
turned folk music educator. Until
the end of her college years she
remained under the shadow of
her famous brother, but a trip to
Europe and a singing engage
ment with a folk-singing quartet
in England (one member of
which was Ewan McColl) nurtui’-
ed her emerging individuality. As
singing delegate to the 1957
World Youth Festival she began
to feel a real empathy with the
working class an empathy
which brought about her final
emergence as a singular perform
er.
Peggy Seeger is one of the
most substantial of the present
day city folksingers. She avoids
an overwhelming theatricity, and
yet commands respect with her
direct presentation.

working class an empathy
which brought about her final
emergence as a singular perform
er.
Peggy Seeger is one of the
most substantial of the present
day city folksingers. She avoids
an overwhelming theatricity, and
yet commands respect with her
direct presentation.
Pete Seeger is undoubtedly
America's best-known folk singer
and, some would say, its best. But
in England, Pete is referred to
and introduced as “Peggy See
ger’s brother.” For 27-year-old
Peggy has become the most re
nowned representative of Ameri
ca in Britain’s present outburst of
folk music activity.
Although Peggy Seeger ad
heres strictly to her American
song repertoire, she has become a
part of England. She has married
Britain’s great folk interpreter
Ewan McColl, has taken English
citizenship, and now lives in a
suburb of London. But her re
turns to the United States are en
thusiastically welcomed; and in
Seeger family concerts, even
brother Pete must sometimes
take a back-seat to Peggy.
PEGGY SEEGER has recorded
widely for Folkways, Folk-Lyric,
Vanguard, and Riverside, but per
haps her most representative al
bum is Prestige-International’s
“The Best of Peggy Seeger” (INT
33005). The album gives one a
strong impression of her inher
ently happy voice—an impression
that is reinforced by her child
like face. One can imagine her
singing “Children’s Medley” or
“The Chickens They Are Crow
ing” to a ring of delighted in
fants.
Peggy Seeger’s sense of win
der emerges in “Oh. Watch the
Stars.” But she is also capable of
the mordant social satire for
which both her brother and hus
band are noted. And she can elic
it the pathos inherent in a tragic
ballad like “Young Collins.”
Peggy’s instrumental style is a

remarkable blend of classical and
country. It is a fit vehicle for her
voice—effective without becom
ing showy or musically pedantic.
Defending eclectic instrumenta
tion in the notes to the present
album, she says that every pres
ent-day urban singer passes
through a stage “during which
he flits, musically speaking, from
one song genre to another . . .
and out of this experience, if the
singer is a creative one, will come
a personal style which will of
necessity be an amalgam of the
musical stages through which he
has passed, however mutually op
posed they may have been.”
PEGGY SEEGER’S style seems
to have arisen from exposure to a
wide range of native American
genres from the cradle onward.
Her father, Charles Seeger, was
a world-renowned pioneer folk
musicologist: her mother was a
concert-pianist and composer
turned folk music educator. Until
the end of her college years she
remained under the shadow of
her famous brother, but a trip to
Europe and a singing engage
ment with a folk-singing quartet
in England (one member of
which was Ewan McColl) nurtui’-
ed her emerging individuality. As
singing delegate to the 1957
World Youth Festival she began
to feel a real empathy with the
working class an empathy
