# IN 'THE NATION'
## Roszak Examines Psychoanalysis As Method in Historical Research 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
Theodore Roszak, director of Stanford’s History of Western
Civilization program, has written for this week’s (November 24»
“Nation” a quite distinguished article on "The Historian as Psychi
atrist.” Part of a special “Nation” issue on the various roles of the
historian, Roszak’s article surveys the use which historians have

already made of psychoanalytical
insights and suggests how psy
choanalysis may yet become a
liberating critique of the whole
method of historical study.
ROSZAK points out that while
the tools of the psychiatrist have
been used to write the biogra
phies of figures such as Napoleon
and the record of pathological
periods such as Hitler’s Ger
many, historians have not rea
lized the possibilities of writing
history as the study of man the
inherently neurotic animal. “For
what historians may really be
studying, not occasionally but at
all times,” says Roszak, “is dis
eased matter. Human history be
comes a case history of the great
est of all neuroses, that of civil
ized man.”
Roszak maintained that acade
micians in genera] and historians
in particular have rejected all the
truly original insights in Freud
that will not filter through the
draining-sieve of “sophisticated
prudishness and common sense.”
He praised Lewis Mumford’s
“The City in History” for its ab
sorption of psychological motifs,
but pointed to two other books
as the outstanding examples of a
Freudian reformulation of histo
riography: Norman Brown's
“Life Against Death” and “Eros
and Civilization” by Herbert
Marcuse. “Both men,” says Ros
zak, ‘seek not to destroy consci
ousness but to heighten it.”
NORMAN Brown, probably the
most original of the two, sees
man as the animal who, unable
to accept death as the natural end
of life, makes history in two
ways: by constructing artifices—
cities, pyramids, empires—that
will live after him, and by pun
ishing his intractable body with
asceticism. By sublimination man
destroys his natural life of the
body, hoping to resurrect it in
monuments of stone or volumes
of poetry.
“What is history?” summa
rizes Roszak. “It is the piece-by
piece assassination of the infant’s
polymorphously perverse body.
So far has this unrelenting re
pression of physical joy gone, that
now only an overworked genital
ity is left to us, fighting on like
an embattled aborigine driven to
the last promontory of the de
sexualized flesh.”
Marcuse’s book is an attempt at
a solution of this bleak dilemma
—a utopia of libidinal liberation:
he “has raised the hope that civili
zation may yet redeem the back
log of postponed pleasures it has
built up during the long genera
tions of primitive accumulation.”
With our modern technology, we
might eliminate the harsh dis
cipline of infants on which we
have hitherto relied to prepare
children to do the work of the
world.
HOWEVER, Roszak maintains
that history “has above all to
gain a different tone” from psy
choanalytic enlightenment. “A
grasp of how deeply diseased
man’s historical development has
been would withdraw from his
political behavior the respecta
bility he requires to take himself
seriously. It would give rise to a
new objectivity . . . the objec
tivity of the psychiatrist investi
gating the history of a sick soul,
breaking down its defenses, gaug
ing its behavior at every step by
the standards of good health and
happiness.”
Roszak seems a little too much
taken in by Marcuse’s libidinal
utopia. But his evaluation of
Norman Brown, who is becoming
recognized as one of the most in
fluential writers of the time, is
excellent. It is a pity that Dr.
Roszak did not extend his survey
to Margaret Mead’s “Sex and
Temperament in Three Primitive
Societies,” and Lionel Trilling’s

“Freud and the Crisis of Our
Culture,” which provide a germ
of the possibility that philosophy
and indeed the entire history of
ideas might be rewritten, no
longer as the interaction of trans
cendent ideas, but as the criss
crossing alliances of like tem
peraments, culminating in the
formation of an oligarchy of tem
perament which enforces the
prevalent ideals of an age.
It is all too easy for historians
of ideas to think of ideas as cold
independent realities, not taking
into account (he struggle and the
life of human temperaments be
hind them. Such an attitude can
lead to the worst neurosis of all
—a perverse mistaken love of
ideas in themselves. It is a dis
ease of which we may suspect
such diverse men as Aquinas and
Lenin to have been afflicted. Mr.
Roszak’s article is a worthy
counteractant.
