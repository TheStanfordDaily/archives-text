Editor, The Daily:
Though the Daily has the edi
torial right to comment on news
events in any way it sees fit, it
would be unfortunate if the im
pression were created that recent
comments on Beta Chi printed on
the edit page reflected the opin
ion of this house.

Last Monday night, Beta Chi
passed a resolution stating its in
tention to re designate itself Beta
Chi Fraternity, and to petition
the university for recognition as
such. The petition has been
dpawn up, but it cannot be acted
upon until the trustees’ meeting
next month. Until that time, we
are still Beta Chi chapter of Sig
ma Nu.

This house decided to leave Sig
ma Nu as a result of a compli
cated set of circumstances. We
felt that the best thing we could
do was to go local; it would make
ns a better house. This should
imply no comment by us on the
situation of Kappa Alpha; we do
not know the circumstances of
their case. We are not preaching
to anyone, but only trying to
work out the best solution for
ourselves.
One of the factors involved in
our decision was the overt racial
discrimination of our national.
Another was our judgment that
a local fraternity can make a go
of it at Stanford —indeed, that it
has certain advantages. But we
are not embarked on a crusade
against national fraternities. For
some houses, national affiliation
will continue to be advantageous
for years to come.
Nor can the fact that we have
retained our chapter name rather
than our national name be con
strued as a criticism of ATO.
The name a house chooses is en
tirely its own business. ATO de
serves nothing but credit for its
courageous stand, which blazed
the trail for future local fraterni
ties at Stanford, and for its fine
record since that time.
