## Grand Design Unattainable In Near Future 
### BERNARD C. GIRIN 
Within a few days, Stanford
students will be invited to draw
iheir attention to the problems of
a grand design, the Atlantic
Community. This community is
already a reality of which the
Western world can be proud; but
the “grand design” would trans
form this alliance to achieve a
much closer community.
The obstacles are immense, and
the realization of the “grand de
sign” is not for the near future.
One of (he difficult problems to
solve is related to the profound
divergence betwen the French
and American foreign policy.
THE FIRST obstacle is the
question of the French atomic
“force de frappe”—a first step
towards a European deterrent.
The so-called French “politique
de grandeur” is not the main
reason which has led French gov
ernments to undertake this poli
cy.
There is a more serious argu
ment, which is that the Soviet
Union does not seem to take very
seriously the threat of an Amer
ican atomic response in case the
Communists attack Europe with
conventional weapons. The Soviet
Union, in other words, does not
believe that the United States is
ready to risk its own destruction
in order to rescue Europe. And
the American stand in the Cuban
, affair does not modify the prob
, lem. An autonomous European
deterrent—even small, and by no
, means comparable with the nu
clear power of the two Greats—
would have the purpose of re-es
tablishing the balance of annihil
ation because the Russians can
not doubt the will of Europe to
fight for its own survival.
The reasons against this “force
de frappe” are quite serious, too;
the main reasons are the fear of
world war caused by the multipli
cation of countries with nuclear
weapons and the understandable
desire of the American govern
ment to keep its monopoly in or
der to determine the common
strategic policy of the Communi
ty. In other words, Americans
don’t want somebody else with
his finger on the trigger. On this
specific question, I think it is
certain Europe will have soon its
own nuclear weapons. It already
is changing the situation within
the Atlantic Community, relating
to a more equal cooperation be
tween the Allies.
THK PROBLEM of the “force
I de frappe” is only a part of a
vaster question, that of the world-
I wide objectives of Europe as a
political entity which will be a
reality very soon whatever the
institutional aspect of the unifi
cation.
The French government does
not want a neutralist Europe be
tween the United States and the
Soviet Union, but a Europe coop
erating on an equal basis with
the United States and maintain
ing some special economic links
with Africa with a consequent
discrimination against the United
States, Latin America, etc. Obvi
( ously these trade agreements
. would be accompanied by more
' or less close political links.
I The basis of this Gaullist Eu
. rope is the very close alliance be
; tween Germany and France. Eng
land will have to compromise
with these views, which are com
mon to Adenauer and De Gaulle,
but the solution is not yet in view
' because Great Britain wants at
‘ the same time to attain mutually
[ exclusive objectives: it wants to
' enter the Common Market to re
| vitalize the British economy, and
it wants to keep its preferential
1 economic relations with the Com
monwealth and its political rela
• tions with the- United States,
1 above all.
THE UNITED States also seeks
irreconcilable objectives since the
i U.S. favors an integrated political
I Europe including Great Britain—
• Great Britain which does not
i want a close political unity—and
> they want a Europe which would
- renounce a protectionist policy in
■ its economic relations with them.
■ But a common foreign tariff is in
’ dispensable for the economic uni
i ty of Europe.
> About Berlin, the Gaullist poli
cy is to support in every case
< West Germany thinking in part
- that if the Allies seem to be will
- ing to negotiate with the Rus
. sians over Berlin, Germany would
- be able to precede them in the
- negotiations leading to a turning
; over in German foreign policy.
1 On the other hand. Great Britain
■ and the United States seem more
> likely to compromise on Berlin,
but the situation has reached a
point where there is no possible
compromise in view.
These divergences are well
, known and it is trivial to recall
them. They show the difficulties,
which exist between the Allies,
when they have to compromise
on questions they consider vital
for themselves. The Atlantic
Community, which can be con
sidered a great hope, is not at
tainable in the near future: in
other words, the Atlantic Alliance
will certainly change, with the
emergence of a United Europe;
to know if it will become this
ideal Atlantic Community is a
; different question.
