# Cal Wins Ink Bowl
## 
### 
The liig Game may have been
a stunning victory for Stanford,
but for pine dramatic intensity,
it was completely overshadowed
by the Ink Bowl game Saturday
between the Stanford Gaily and
the Daily C'al, even though the
bad guys won.
With barely enough lime left
for one play, the Cal tailback
rolled out and threw a despera
tion, 30-yard pass for a touch
down and an IS-12 win.
THE STALWARTS from the
Stanford Daily had fought back
from tin* outset, after a fluke Cal
TD, to take a 12-fi lead in the sec
ond half. The punt and pass-in
terception returning of Freckles
Christofesson and a sustained
drive, respectively, set up the
two Stanford scores, which came
on two rollouts by Rambling Rog
er Mendelson,
Cal came back to lie it, how
ever, and the rest is history, un
fortunately.
