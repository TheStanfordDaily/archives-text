# OUR MAN ON THE FARM-
## Curfice Story in Examiner Is Bad Newspaper Practice Glenn Alford 
### 
The San Francisco Examiner has campaigned for the past few
years to lose the tag of sensationalism embodied in its ownership
by the Hearst Newspaper chain. The Examiner’s - search for respec
tability was set back at least twenty years by a front sports page
article written by Don Selby which ran yesterday. The article was
headlined “Stanford Will Fire Curtice Today."
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES is this type of speculation per
missible, whether it was written under orders by Sports Editor
Curley Grieve, or at Selby's discretion. It is especially pernicious
when a coach is reported to be fighting for his job, and he has just
won a major battle only two days previously. The major battle in
this case was the most decisive Stanford Big Game triumph in
several decades.
The Examiner story is surprising, since in Sunday’s edition,
right next to Selby’s Big Game story, the name of columnist Pres
cott Sullivan ran above a feature explaining why Curtice should be
rehired. The saying goes, “A hero today, a bum tomorrow,” but this
is ridiculous.
Selby’s story begins. “Stanford won the Axe, traditional symbol
of Big Game victory, last Saturday. Today, less than 48 hours later,
Stanford will use it symbolically on the neck of the victorious coach.”
This kind of purple prose supposedly went out with W. R. Hearst
himself. Worse than being bad for Curtice’s chances of being rehired,
it is stupid. Should Curtice be rehired, what would the Examiner’s
press relations with the Stanford football team be? Selby, the Ex
aminer football writer, would be fortunate to get within a mile of
the Stadium.
Stanford officials have never uttered a sound to the press for
publication concerning Curtice’s status.
Should Curtice not in* retained as head football coach and the
Examiner’s report verified, there are two possibilities as to where
tile Examiner got the information used in the article. They could
have guessed that Curtice would not be retained. But tliis isn’t likely.
No newspaper would take such a chance without some sort of proof,
whether reliable or not. Then the Examiner must have either re
ceived a news leak or been given the information in confidence.
Either possibility makes the Examiner look bad. If there was a
news leak, then the Examiner printed information that Stanford
Athletic Board tried to keep quiet and did so deliberately. If the
Examiner was told this in confidence, then it violated a confidence,
bad practice in the newspaper trade.
Selby's story closes “Next year could be a big one for Stanford.”
This after telling why Curtice won’t be around next year, and inci
dentally, mentioning the Stanford football players who will be avail
able next year.
IN CALIFORNIA MEMORIAE STADIUM Press Box last Satur
day at Big Game, a sportswriter from the Berkeley Gazette was
heard to remark that no one would ever find speculation about the
head football coaching position at Stanford in the Gazette because
such talk was bad for both the football team’s morale and the coach’s
chances of retaining his job. The Examiner would do well to exercise
such admirable restraint.
