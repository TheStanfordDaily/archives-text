### JOAN ZARO 
The “ought” can be derived from
the "is” without the use of addi-1
tional moral premises, said John
Searle yesterday evening in Tre
sidder Union lounge.
Searle, professor of philosophy
at the University of California at |
Berkeley, spoke at a meeting of,
the Stanford Philosophy Collo
quium.
Specifically, Searle set out to
prove that value statements, i.e.
that which ought to be, can logi
cally be derived from standard
descriptive statements, i.e. that
which exists or that which is.
Searle attacked the claim that
no set of descriptive statements
can entail a valuative statement
with the following counter-exam
ple:
1. Jones makes the utterance: “I
hereby promise to pay you,
Smith, $.3.”
2. Jones promises to pay Smith
$5.
3. Jones places himself under an
obligation to pay Smith $5.
4. Jones is under an obligation to
pay Smith $5.
5. Jones ought to pay Smith $5.
Any of the above series state
ments can be derived directly
from the proceeding one without
the addition of any evaluative
statements as premises, Searle
claimed.
