# Poli Union Forms Caucus for Peace
## 
### 
A Peace Caucus, under the Po
litical Union, has officially been
established by the Poli Union
Board, after receiving the approv
al of the Legislature.
"The Peace Caucus,” said Steve
Weissbluth, chairman, "wishes to
attract, as members, students
who are concerned with the is
sue of w’ar and peace and who'
disagree with the use and threats
of violence as a means to the res
olution of conflicts.”
THE CONSTITUTION of the
Caucus lists as the group’s pur
poses;
"I—To provide a forum for the
discussion, by all interested stu
dents and faculty, of all matters
pertaining to peaceful methods
of conflict resolution.
“2—To sponsor informative ac
tivities relating to peaceful alter
natives to war and peace.”
AS A MEMBER of Poli Union,
the Caucus is a recognized cam
pus group, permitted to sponsor
outside speakers and campus
wide activities.
The Peace Caucus is an out
growth of the Forum for the Dis
cussion of Non-Violent Alterna
tives to War, a student group ap
proved by the Legislature last
Spring Quarter but later prohibit
ed to sponsor outside speakers by
the Administration because of its
supposedly partisan orientation.
Many Caucus members were ac
tive in the Forum group.
