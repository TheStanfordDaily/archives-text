HAVANA Cuba said today it will permit United Nations inves
tigators to verify the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba if the
United States will agree to U.N. supervision of the dismantling of
"training camps of mercenaries, spies, saboteurs and terrorists” al
leged to be on its soil.
Replying to the Castro government’s demand for dismantling
of Cuban refugee bases in the United States, State Department
spokesman Lincoln White said;
"The Cuban government’s statement constitutes an attempt to
avoid adequate international arrangements for inspection and veri
fication that Cuba will not once again become a base for offensive
weapons. If the Cuban government is sincerely anxious about its
own security and is determined to live at peace with its neighbors,
we can think of no better method of allaying its fears than by the
presence in Cuba of representatives of the United Nations.”
INDIA FINDS TREATY UNACCEPTABLE -NEW DELHI India
said today parts of the Chinese Communist truce proposal were
“unacceptable.” However, the proposals were not rejected outright,
apparently because India did not wish to disturb the six-day-old
cease-fire. The statement read by a government spokesman was the
first official reaction to the Chinese offer although India said earlier
it was asking Peking for clarification of several points. The spokes
man said the offer still was under study.
