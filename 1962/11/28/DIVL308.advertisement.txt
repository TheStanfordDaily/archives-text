DECK THE HALLS
\Mion you think of Christmas drifts you naturally think of
Marlboro cigarettes, leading seller in flip-top box in all fifty
states—and if we annex Wales, in all fifty-one—and if we an
nex Lapland—in all fifty-two. This talk about annexing Wales
and Lapland is, incidentally, not just idle speculation. Croat
Britain wants to trade Wales to the United States for a desert.
<>reat Britain needs a desert desperately on account of the
tourist trade. Tourists are always coming up to the Prime
Minister or the Lord Privy Seal or like that and saying, “I’m
not knocking your country, mind you. It’s very quaint and
picturesque, etc. what with Buckingham Palace and Bovril
and Scotland Yard, etc., hut where's your desert?” (Before I
forget, let me point out that Scotland Yard, Britain's plain
clothes police branch, was named after Wally Scotland and
Fred 'lard who invented plain clothes. The American plain
clothes force is called the FBI after Frank B. Inchcliff, who
invented fingerprints. Before Mr. Inchcliff’s invention, every
body's fingers were absolutely glassy smooth. This, an you
may imagine, played hob with the identification of newborn
babies in hospitals, From 1701 until 1004 no American parent

ever brought home the right baby from the hospital. Thus
later 1 >ecanie known as the Black Tom Explosion.)
But J digress. England, I was saying, wants to trade Wales
for a desert. Sweden wants to trade Lapland for Frank B. Inch
cliff. The reason is that Swedes to this day still don’t have
fingerprints. As a result, identification of babies in Swedish
hospitals is so haphazard that Swedes flatly refuse to bring tbeir
babies home. There are, at present, nearly a half-billion un
claimed babies in Swedish hospitals—some of them well over
eighty years old.
But 1 digress. We were speaking of Christmas gifts which
naturally put us in mind of Marlboro cigarettes. What could
be more welcome at Christmas time than Marlboro’s flavor,
Marlboro’s soft pack, Marlboro’s flip-top box? What indeed
would be more welcome at any time of year—-winter or sum
mer, rain or shine, night or day? Any time, any season, when
you light a Marlboro you can always be certain that you will
get the same mild, flavorful, completely comfortable smoke.
There are, of course, other things you can give for Christmas
besides Marlboro cigarettes. If, for example, you are looking
for something to give a music lover, let me call to your atten
tion a revolutionary new development in phonographs (he
I-ow-fi phonograph. The Low-fi, product of years of patient
research, has so little fidelity to the record you put on it that if,
for instance, you put “Stardust” on the turntable, “Melancholy
Bal >y” will come out. This is an especially welcome gift for
people who have grown tired of “Stardust”.
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.
