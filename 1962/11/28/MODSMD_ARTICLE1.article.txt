# Lee Says Medical Aid Saved Millions of Lives
## 
### LIZ FREEMAN 
"United States foreign aid has saved easily 2l> million lives
since the end ol World War 11, stated ]>v. Russell V. Lee in his
speech “Foreign Aid and Homan Lives" at the Tuesday Evening
Series last night. The Stanford Medical School professor spoke
from his extensive experience of working with United States

foreign aid programs. Following'
the War, malaria was the "prime
epidemic disease,” he said. The
Anopheles mosquito, which trans
mits malaria by biting humans,
alights on the wall before attack
ing its victim. Walls sprayed with
DDT kill the mosquito and pre
vent the spread of the disease.
A CAMPAIGN begun in 1953
to spray every house in India
dropped the malaria occurrence
from 500 million cases a year to
zero. United States foreign aid
supplied the DDT, the necessary
vehicles, and lots of technical ad
vice.
In Africa the "problem is
dreadful,” he said, since often
there are no houses and people
sleep outside.
“ONE OF THE MOST hearten
ing examples of world coopera
tion” is the World Health Organ
ization's malaria health team, he
said, whose projects crossed even
the Bamboo Curtain and the Iron
Curtain.
“The sanitary measures are
easily supplied,” he said, but
problems come back unless we
leave educated people there. In
the foreign aid programs in South
East Asia, he explained, the local
health officers are always in
charge of the campaigns, and we
work with the ministers of health
and their health teams. Some
times the people are poorly train
ed, he said, but the experience
qualifies them to take over after
we leave.

Referring to the elimination of
malaria in the Mediterranean Ba
sin, he said. “The effect upon the
economics of these countries has
been fantastic.” Greece has de
veloped a rice crop, and for the
first time is exporting rice in
stead of importing grain. In In
dia the coal and food production
have increased greatly, he stated,
due to the improved labor force.

Anopheles mosquito, which trans
mits malaria by biting humans,
alights on the wall before attack
ing its victim. Walls sprayed with
DDT kill the mosquito and pre
vent the spread of the disease.
A CAMPAIGN begun in 1953
to spray every house in India
dropped the malaria occurrence
from 500 million cases a year to
zero. United States foreign aid
supplied the DDT, the necessary
vehicles, and lots of technical ad
vice.
In Africa the "problem is
dreadful,” he said, since often
there are no houses and people
sleep outside.
“ONE OF THE MOST hearten
ing examples of world coopera
tion” is the World Health Organ
ization's malaria health team, he
said, whose projects crossed even
the Bamboo Curtain and the Iron
Curtain.
“The sanitary measures are
easily supplied,” he said, but
problems come back unless we
leave educated people there. In
the foreign aid programs in South
East Asia, he explained, the local
health officers are always in
charge of the campaigns, and we
work with the ministers of health
and their health teams. Some
times the people are poorly train
ed, he said, but the experience
qualifies them to take over after
we leave.

Referring to the elimination of
malaria in the Mediterranean Ba
sin, he said. “The effect upon the
economics of these countries has
been fantastic.” Greece has de
veloped a rice crop, and for the
first time is exporting rice in
stead of importing grain. In In
dia the coal and food production
have increased greatly, he stated,
due to the improved labor force.
