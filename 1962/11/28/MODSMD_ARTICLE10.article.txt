# Soviet Changes Policy on EEC
## 
### KAREN ORREN IIR Political Analyst 
The reaction of the Soviet Bloc
to the Common Market has
changed in recent months from
hard ■ line opposition to sugges
tions for cooperation. Last May
Khrushchev initiated an attack on
the European Economic Commun
ity (EEC) as “a state monopoly
agreement of the finance oligar
chy of western Europe which
threatens the vital interests of all
nations.

In September, however, writing
in a Communist ideological jour
nal, Khrushchev conceded certain
significant successes to the EEC
and added. “The question arises
of possible economic cooperation
and peaceful economic competi

states with different social sys
tems, hut also among economic
associations of such states.”

The prospect of western Euro
pean nations with a combined pop

a vast mutual effort of industrial
growth and laying the ground
work for possible future political
integration is bound to provoke
ideological squirmings behind the
Iron Curtain. This is particularly
clear since it was not so long ago
that these nine western Euro

pean nations were announced to
be heading toward Capitalist de

But the more immediate explana

found in the economic situation
of the Soviet Bloc.

counterpart of the EEC, the So
viet Bloc is engaged in an intense
program of industrial expansion
and modernization. And a crucial
factor in this push is western ma
chinery and technology.
The Common Market countries
make up the biggest volume mar
ket outside the Soviet Bloc itself,
and continued access to this mar
ket is required to obtain exchange
with which to pay for machinery
uul other equipment. Also, COM
ECON seeks credit from western
Europe to finance its economic
development and to permit the
purchase of more machines.
The COMECON nations fear
iha! as internal trade barriers
disappear and a common tariff is
applied to all imports entering the
Common Market nations, goods
from the Soviet Bloc will no long
er be able to compete and trade
will be drastically reduced. Ac
tually, until now, the Common
