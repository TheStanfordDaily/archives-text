# Soviet Changes Policy on EEC
## 
### KAREN ORREN IIR Political Analyst 
The reaction of the Soviet Bloc
to the Common Market has
changed in recent months from
hard ■ line opposition to sugges
tions for cooperation. Last May
Khrushchev initiated an attack on
the European Economic Commun
ity (EEC) as “a state monopoly
agreement of the finance oligar
chy of western Europe which
threatens the vital interests of all
nations.

In September, however, writing
in a Communist ideological jour
nal, Khrushchev conceded certain
significant successes to the EEC
and added. “The question arises
of possible economic cooperation
and peaceful economic competi
tion not only among individual
states with different social sys
tems, hut also among economic
associations of such states.”

The prospect of western Euro
pean nations with a combined pop
ulation of 220,000,000 engaged in
a vast mutual effort of industrial
growth and laying the ground
work for possible future political
integration is bound to provoke
ideological squirmings behind the
Iron Curtain. This is particularly
clear since it was not so long ago
that these nine western Euro

pean nations were announced to
be heading toward Capitalist de
cay and Communist revolution.
But the more immediate explana
tion for this vacillating policy is
found in the economic situation
of the Soviet Bloc.
THROUGH the Council for Mu
tual Economic Assistance (CO
MECON!. the eastern European
counterpart of the EEC, the So
viet Bloc is engaged in an intense
program of industrial expansion
and modernization. And a crucial
factor in this push is western ma
chinery and technology.
The Common Market countries
make up the biggest volume mar
ket outside the Soviet Bloc itself,
and continued access to this mar
ket is required to obtain exchange
with which to pay for machinery
uul other equipment. Also, COM
ECON seeks credit from western
Europe to finance its economic
development and to permit the
purchase of more machines.
The COMECON nations fear
iha! as internal trade barriers
disappear and a common tariff is
applied to all imports entering the
Common Market nations, goods
from the Soviet Bloc will no long
er be able to compete and trade
will be drastically reduced. Ac
tually, until now, the Common
Market imports have increased
since union due to western Euro
pean expansion, but there is no
guarantee that this trend will con
tinue. While the volume of export
of Soviet oil to western Europe
seems likely to continue undimin
ished, the prospect is less secure
for agricultural exports coming
from the satellites, particularly in
view of the Common Market's re
cently anounced plans to cut
agricultural imports drastically.
Kllltl SIICIIKV has a personal
stake in the success of industrial
expansion in the Soviet Bloc. In
accord with his time schedule of
leaving the stage of "building so
cialism” and entering the stage of
communism around 1980, he has
upped the production goals for
COMECON'. During the period
1961-1980 industrial production is
expected to increase six times,
farm products three times, and
national income five times.
After the political defeats of
military withdrawal from Cuba
and the stalemate in Berlin, Khru
shchev cannot risk further embar
rassment in the economic sphere.
So far, however, his economic pro
gram has not been a big success.
Throughout the COMECON na
tions wages are down and prices
arc up. Czechoslovakia has com

plained of an industrial slowdown
j due to poor management, and East
German production is declining
sharply. Poland's grain deficit
forced her to purchase 300,000
tons of grain from Canada. In the
Soviet Union itself, the dramatic
30 percent rise in meat prices last
spring reflected shortages there,
although it does now appear that
the fall harvest has been success
ful. Outside COMECON the dras
tic situation in China and Cuba,
as well as industrial and agricul
tural setbacks in Yugoslavia,
cause further economic strains.
And now the Common Market
threatens to close down western
markets to COMECON and to
i clog the vital supply line of mod
ern machinery and technology.
KIIHI SIK lIEV’S early at
tempts to disrupt the Common
Market with propaganda assaults
and pressures on western Com
rnunisl parties proved ineffective.
His hints last June of U.N. sanc
tions against the EEC never ma
terialized. The Italian Communist
Parly, the largest in the West, has
publicly taken the view that, con
trary to Moscow's insistence, the
EEC is beneficial to western Euro
pean industrial workers.
Nor has Khrushchev's alterna
tive approach of peaceful coopera
tion between COMECON and EEC
shown more promising results.
He seeks the most-favored-nation
treatment for COMECON, hut has
nothing to offer in return. In a
state-controlled economy, tariffs
on imports are primarily symbolic
and thus hardly a worthwhile con
cession for bargaining with the !
West. It was over this issue that
the Russian-Erench trade nego- j
tint ions broke down last spring.
MiiAN\MIII,i;, an attempt is
being made to buttress the possi- |
ble effects of the Common Mar
ket on COMECON by stepping up ■
production within Itie Bloc. Plans
include a tightening of economic j
contracts, coordination of capital
investment, and greater speciali
zation among the countries, par
ticularly in tlie area of machinery.
Also, new devices will be tried
such as a collective bank, multi
lateral accounting, and export in
centives.
