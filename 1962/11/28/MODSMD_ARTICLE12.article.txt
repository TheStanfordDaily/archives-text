# Coach Curtice Fired, Announces Masters
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Amid longstanding complaints
and criticism of his performance
as Stanford’s head football coach,
Jack Curtice was officially fired
yesterday.

The following statement by A1
Masters, director of university
athletics, was released at 7:30
a.m. saying; “After conferences
with many people who are close
to the Stanford athletic picture;
and much deliberation, I have de
cided, in the best interest of all
parties concerned, not to recom
mend Jack Curtice for reappoint
ment as head football coach. I
have reached this decision with
great regret. All of us at Stan
ford wish Jack the very best in
the future.” The recommendation
has the approval of J. E. Wallace
Sterling, the university president.
Curtice is only the third of 23
Stanford coaches to be fired in
the 71 years of football on the
Farm. Tiny Thornhill in 1939 and
Bob Evans in 1919 were the other
two. All other coaching changes
have involved an official resigna
tion, a promotion to a new posi

tion at Stanford, or a transfer to
another school.

THE UNIVERSITY’S decision
appears to be anything but a re
cent one. Pressures for Curtice's
dismissal have been mounting at
least since 1960, when Stanford
had a 0-10 record. At that time,
only intervention by Sterling pre
vented Curtice’s dismissal in the
midst of his five-year contract.
“A trend had started over a
year ago,” admitted Masters yes
terday, implying that Curtice’s
fate was nearly sealed before the
1962 season ever started. It was
definitely sealed before last week
end’s stunning Big Game win
over Cal. The Athletic Board, an
important advisory committee to
the athletic director, which would
normally move on an issue as
vital as this one, did not discuss
Curtice’s status at their last
meeting prior to the Big Game
and have not met since. Masters
revealed, however, he has “talked
privately to all the Board mem
bers and I know their feelings. I
didn’t want them to make an of
ficial recommendation before the
Big Game, because I was afraid
the news would leak out, and I
wanted to wait till the end of the
season to notify Jack (Curtice).”
CURTICE was noticeably dis
heartened yesterday although he
had been informed by Masters on
Monday morning. “I did my best
for five years here and I’m sorry
if it wasn’t good enough. I tried
hard with the boys, got the re
cruiting going, and now we've
got some good material here. The
new coach will have a great team
next year.”

Despite all the overt pressure
during the last two weeks advo
cating his firing, Curtice claimed
he didn’t know what his fate
would be “until Monday when
Mr. Masters said my contract
would not bo renewed. A lot of
fine people have been writing me
saying they hoped I would stay.’’
Curtice is not the only one who
will lose a job in the turn over.
As of now, half of the six assis
tant coaches will be seeking new
positions, since incoming coaches
are always allowed to chose a
new staff. However, three of Cur
tice’s assistants will probably re
main in other capacities. They
are Dutch Fohring, the varsity
baseball coach; Dan Snavely, the
frosh football coach and the head
of Stanford’s athletic recruiting;
and Pete Kmetovic, the rugby
coach and an assistant football
coach here since 1950. The other
three assistants are Andy Ever
est, Jack Cross, and Leon Mc-
Laughlin.
THE JOB OF filling Curtice’s
vacancy now falls to Masters,
who is in his last year here, and
Chuck Taylor, the assistant ath
letic director who will succeed
Masters. “However, the responsi
bility is still primarily mine.”
said Masters. "I’d like to get the
job done as soon as possible, but
it will probably take at least a
month. I will give out no infor
mation on this subject, however,
until a final decision is reached.”

A speculative list of candidates
for the job includes Navy coach
Bud Hardin, Oklahoma coach
Bud Wilkinson, Oregon coach Len
Casanova, and former Stanford
quarterback and San Francisco
49er coach Frankie Albert. Along
with such big-name figures as
these, Masters says there are
many lesser known, assistant
coaches around the country who
will be considered.
