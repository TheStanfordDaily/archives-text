# Wire Service Resistant To Censorship of News
## 
### 
United Press International feature
Experience in global reporting
teaches that almost no govern
ment anywhere would scruple to
take advantage of a supine press.
That is why wire service people
are among the first to become
apprehensive when Washington
clamps down on news. They have
seen small restrictions start in
other countries and then mush
room into dark clouds that dis
tort and eventually shut out the
light.
President Kennedy’s promise
last week that a normal flow of
information would be resumed at
the Defense and State Depart
ments was a signal to all govern
ment agencies that the adminis
tration favors freedom of access
to government news sources. The
promise was made in response to
complaints by reporters.
There are numerous ways that
a powerful government can con
trol the news wholly or in part.
In South America a favorite
method is to suspend constitu
tional guarantees. There the ex
ecutive branches proclaim alerts,
partial alerts, states of siege or
emergencies as they decide po
litical conditions warrant. Each
decree .automatically .suspends
certain civil rights and these usu
ally include freedom of the press.
Today, although no censorship
law appears on the hooks in Vene
zuela, the press there is censored
completely. Censors occupy news
paper offices because press free
dom has been suspended. So have
other civil rights.
This month Luis T. Nunez of
El Universal (Caracas) took re
fuge in the Brazilian embassy in
the Venezuelan capital and then
fled to the U.S. Last April he had
been in jail because El Universal
reported that the administra
tion’s political enemies were or
ganizing in the hills. This month
his home was searched in his ab
sence by government agents.
Senor Nunez knew that if he
were locked up again his paper
might not even be permitted to
report his arrest.
Could it happen here? Proba
bly not. No national administra
tion in this country has advo
cated peacetime censorship, but
the least hint of interference
with the flow of government
news must always call for stern
resistance by the press.
Unfortunately there is a gap
in public understanding about
this, and the newspapers have not
always made their position clear.
Our cries of anguish when legiti
mate news is withheld, and our
petitions for relief, are sometimes
misinterpreted as merely self
serving.
There is no reason why the
press should be reluctant to state
its position forcefully and fre
quently. We must publish every
interesting item of government
news that we have room for, ex

cepting, of course, information
that might aid a potential enemy.
A representative government can
not be permitted to conduct the
people’s business secretly from
the people.

In that context several facts
could be cited to narrow the un
derstanding gap:
—We do have a responsible
press and where is the editor who
would deliberately jeopardize his
country’s security? In limes of
demonstrable national peril the
press accepts security guides on
specific categories of news (mili
tary information mainly) that
might, if published, endanger
the country’s safety. But the
press is only supporting the peo
ple’s right to know when it de
mands adequate assurance that
a peril point has been reached,
and once the crisis is resolved the
press must ask that the guide
lines be withdrawn. Under pres
ent world conditions similar
guidelines could cover some
phases of diplomatic maneuver
too because interim negotiations
in a crisis are on a security par
with troop movements.
—lf we did not have a respon
sible press, especially if the press
became an instrument of govern
ment policy, the people would
soon recognize that fact and
neither friend nor enemy could
believe what the press reported.
(Many editors have been proper
ly disturbed by misleading infor
mation from government sources
on incidents such as the shooting
down of the IJ2 plane over Rus
sia, Cuban surveillance and quar
antine intercepts in the Carib
bean. Misleading leaks and news
releases undermine public confi
dence.)
- The press must combat and
try to circumvent government
secrecy at every level, not be
cause the press is a Nosey Par
ker but because it has a responsi
bility to keep the people informed
of public affairs.
—lf the press should accept
the cloak of secrecy as a proper
garment for government offici
als it would soon find itself in a
grievous conspiracy to mislead
its readers. This almost happen
ed here once. FDR’s associates
concealed their apprehension
about ids state of health when he
ran for a fourth term in 1944.
World War II was not yet won
and perhaps FUR should have
been re-elected anyhow. But war
time restrictions on news had
conditioned editors not to probe
as vigorously as in peacetime,
and the public did not learn until
after the election that the Presi
dent’s health had been a cause
for concern.
Thom is no doubt that official
restrictions tend to dampen news
initiative. In countries which
have had censorship over the
years editors begin to accept it
as away of life.
