Editor, The Daily:
I would take exception to many
of the comments made in The
Daily by Rick Seifert and others
in regards to fraternities, their
nationals, and the handling of
race bias clauses.

In regards to the clauses, all
parties concerned are well aware
of the evilness of such clauses,
since they sanctify individual
feelings which we would like to
rid ourselves of completely. Yet
we are also aware that we form
our personal associations on the
basis of some sort of discrimina
tion and these are in fact preju
dices along the lines of mutual in
terests, compatibility, intelli
gence, looks, and the like.
My objection to the articles
stems from the fact that they do
not stop with criticism (which is
just and deserved) but go further
—in effect telling a fraternity
what course of action should be
taken and backhandedly casting
aspersions on their members’ in
telligence, their motives, and
their abilities to run their own
organizations. This patronizing
air of The Daily’s writers telling
a social-student organization how
to manage its affairs is very net
tling to a member and I believe
that such editorial tones will only
serve to further alienate the fra
ternities from the rest of the stu
dent community.
I suggest that the Daily would
be performing its editorial duty
more justly if it were more posi
tive in its approach to the prob
lems. Instead of encouraging se

cession from the national, it
might encourage continued hard
work and effort toward the re
moval of all bias clauses thereby
doing a service to all fraternities
and the colleges of the country as
a whole.
As far as nationals are concern
ed, many arguments can be given
for their usefulness and their de
sirability. Nationals are no more
anachronistic in the fraternity
system than they are for honor
ary societies, student organiza
tions, other social organizations,
labor unions, and management
associations. In fact, for any or
ganization with any country wide
sphere of mutual interests, it is
the rule rather than the excep
tion. The nationals do provide
funds, loans, and even local lead
ership and guidance in many in
stances. As for gold embossed
membership certificates, I have
yet to see one, and if by this is
meant a certificate’s gold seal
then I would state that almost
every organization, including the
Boy Scouts, uses these to give
recognition to its members. I
leave it to someone actively in a
fraternity to further state the
case for nationals.
Finally I would state that noth
ing but hard work by the mem
bers of fraternities can really
change their social order as it
exists today and this will be hard
coming with the present tenor of
prevailing campus opinion.
