# Peace Corps Volunteers Trained for Crises
## 
### DEAN SAVAGE Contributing Editor 
“At Rome time in the next two years, it is extremely likely that
some of you will be the only ones around who know anything
about delivering a baby and will have to do the best you can." These
words, the instructions of a doctor helping to train Peace Corps
groups in Puerto Rico, give one indication of the situations a volun-

teer should be able to cope with,"
reported 1962 Stanford graduate
Bill Hawthorne.
HAWTHORNE, a Los Altos
resident and former sponsor, re
turned last week to the Stanford
area for a brief stay after a four
month intensive training session
in Puerto Rico; he left yesterday
by air for Miami and then Peru,
where he will spend nearly two
years in the urban slums of
Lima.
Training and instruction on the
island were divided into three
sections, he said. The first 26
days were spent at a camp in the
mountains where physical con
ditioning and crisis reaction were
emphasized and tested. Long
treks and survival training in
“the most mountainous terrain
I’ve ever seen” and a night spent
alone in the jungle made up part
of a program designed to test
self-control.
“Even though you know no one
gets bitten by the tarantulas, you
have a lot of time to think about
it. The first night is particularly
hard for some of the girls,” he
continued.

Calisthenics (each morning at
6 a.m,), rockclimbing, and swim
ming were carried on closer to
camp. Climbing up a cliff nearly
150 feet high easily qualifies as a
crisis situation, especially when
you fall, he said. Trained belay
ers at the top prevent any serious
accidents. Drown proofing with
hands and legs tied, and swim
ming two miles in the ocean fully
clothed were included in the
swimming training.
ALTHOUGH no volunteer may
use these uncommon skills, there
is a transfer value in this train
ing which helps a selection board
to determine how an individual
will react in a similarly tension
filled situation. Other aspects of
camp life included hard physical
labor, language training, and a
short period spent on community
development.
The second two months were
spent at the Catholic University
of Puerto Rico, studying Spanish,
American government, Commu
nist tactics and strategy, interna
tional relations, and public health.
The Spanish language course,
which followed the FSI pattern of
instruction—constant repetition
and little emphasis on grammar
—was excellent, “the only way to
learn a language,” Hawdhorne
said. Other courses had their
faults; because the group of 56
persons was gathered from di
verse backgrounds, much of the
political instruction was carried
on at an elementary level, more
so than was necessary. This prob
lem will probably be corrected in
the near future, he added.

The final month of training
was spent in community develop
ment work and public health
training. Two weeks were spent
working, helping Puerto Ricans
to build low-cost concrete hous
ing. The island government loans
the inhabitants money to build
concrete houses, on the condition
that they put in 30 hours of work
per week toward construction.
Peace Corps labor was donated
to the project to give members a
chance to learn how to work with
people. The volunteers lived in
the same houses, cooked their
own food, and worked nine hours
a day.
DURING the public health in
struction, volunteers were able
to observe two births, talk to doc
tors and midwives, see how a
well-trained public health unit
actually operates in the field, and
learn sanitation techniques first
hand, including the construction
and care of latrines. “If the un
dergraduates in the department
could only see me,” Hawthorne, a

political science major, added
laughingly.
Hawthorne’s over-all impres
sion of the training program was
a good one. What faults do exist
are attributable mainly to the
fact that the Corps is expanding
so rapidly, he said, although
some of them may be traced di
rectly to bureaucratic mix-ups.
The director of the Puerto Ri
can program resigned less than a
month ago, and his position was
taken over by former Dean of
Men William Craig.
IN LIMA Hawthorne will work
on slum clearance and help to
construct housing. His group is
the fourth to bo sent to Peru, and
the first in the Corps to concen
trate on urban community devel
opment. The poli sci grad dis
claimed any knowledge of special
skills which would help him in
his task; the know-how necessary
for effective work would be ac
quired on the job, he said.

IN LIMA Hawthorne will work

“At Rome time in the next two years, it is extremely likely that
some of you will be the only ones around who know anything
about delivering a baby and will have to do the best you can." These
words, the instructions of a doctor helping to train Peace Corps
groups in Puerto Rico, give one indication of the situations a volun-

teer should be able to cope with,"
reported 1962 Stanford graduate
Bill Hawthorne.
HAWTHORNE, a Los Altos
resident and former sponsor, re
turned last week to the Stanford
area for a brief stay after a four
month intensive training session
in Puerto Rico; he left yesterday
by air for Miami and then Peru,
where he will spend nearly two
years in the urban slums of
Lima.
Training and instruction on the
island were divided into three
sections, he said. The first 26
days were spent at a camp in the
mountains where physical con
ditioning and crisis reaction were
emphasized and tested. Long
treks and survival training in
“the most mountainous terrain
I’ve ever seen” and a night spent
alone in the jungle made up part
of a program designed to test
self-control.
“Even though you know no one
gets bitten by the tarantulas, you
have a lot of time to think about
it. The first night is particularly
hard for some of the girls,” he
continued.

Calisthenics (each morning at
6 a.m,), rockclimbing, and swim
ming were carried on closer to
camp. Climbing up a cliff nearly
150 feet high easily qualifies as a
crisis situation, especially when
you fall, he said. Trained belay
ers at the top prevent any serious
accidents. Drown proofing with
hands and legs tied, and swim
ming two miles in the ocean fully
clothed were included in the
swimming training.
ALTHOUGH no volunteer may
use these uncommon skills, there
is a transfer value in this train
ing which helps a selection board
to determine how an individual
will react in a similarly tension
filled situation. Other aspects of
camp life included hard physical
labor, language training, and a
short period spent on community
development.
The second two months were
spent at the Catholic University
of Puerto Rico, studying Spanish,
American government, Commu
nist tactics and strategy, interna
tional relations, and public health.
The Spanish language course,
which followed the FSI pattern of
instruction—constant repetition
and little emphasis on grammar
—was excellent, “the only way to
learn a language,” Hawdhorne
said. Other courses had their
faults; because the group of 56
persons was gathered from di
verse backgrounds, much of the
political instruction was carried
on at an elementary level, more
so than was necessary. This prob
lem will probably be corrected in
the near future, he added.

The final month of training
was spent in community develop
ment work and public health
training. Two weeks were spent
working, helping Puerto Ricans
to build low-cost concrete hous
ing. The island government loans
the inhabitants money to build
concrete houses, on the condition
that they put in 30 hours of work
per week toward construction.
Peace Corps labor was donated
to the project to give members a
chance to learn how to work with
people. The volunteers lived in
the same houses, cooked their
own food, and worked nine hours
a day.
DURING the public health in
struction, volunteers were able
to observe two births, talk to doc
tors and midwives, see how a
well-trained public health unit
actually operates in the field, and
learn sanitation techniques first
hand, including the construction
and care of latrines. “If the un
dergraduates in the department
could only see me,” Hawthorne, a

political science major, added
laughingly.
Hawthorne’s over-all impres
sion of the training program was
a good one. What faults do exist
are attributable mainly to the
fact that the Corps is expanding
so rapidly, he said, although
some of them may be traced di
rectly to bureaucratic mix-ups.
The director of the Puerto Ri
can program resigned less than a
month ago, and his position was
taken over by former Dean of

Hawthorne’s over-all impres

a good one. What faults do exist
are attributable mainly to the
fact that the Corps is expanding
so rapidly, he said, although
some of them may be traced di
rectly to bureaucratic mix-ups.
The director of the Puerto Ri
can program resigned less than a
month ago, and his position was
taken over by former Dean of
Men William Craig.

construct housing. His group is
the fourth to bo sent to Peru, and

skills which would help him in
his task; the know-how necessary
for effective work would be ac

“At Rome time in the next two years, it is extremely likely that
some of you will be the only ones around who know anything
about delivering a baby and will have to do the best you can." These
words, the instructions of a doctor helping to train Peace Corps
groups in Puerto Rico, give one indication of the situations a volun-

teer should be able to cope with,"
reported 1962 Stanford graduate
Bill Hawthorne.
HAWTHORNE, a Los Altos
resident and former sponsor, re
turned last week to the Stanford
area for a brief stay after a four
month intensive training session
in Puerto Rico; he left yesterday
by air for Miami and then Peru,
where he will spend nearly two
years in the urban slums of
Lima.
Training and instruction on the
island were divided into three
sections, he said. The first 26
days were spent at a camp in the
mountains where physical con
ditioning and crisis reaction were
emphasized and tested. Long
treks and survival training in
“the most mountainous terrain
I’ve ever seen” and a night spent
alone in the jungle made up part
of a program designed to test
self-control.
“Even though you know no one
gets bitten by the tarantulas, you
have a lot of time to think about
it. The first night is particularly
hard for some of the girls,” he
continued.

Calisthenics (each morning at
6 a.m,), rockclimbing, and swim
ming were carried on closer to
camp. Climbing up a cliff nearly
150 feet high easily qualifies as a
crisis situation, especially when
you fall, he said. Trained belay
ers at the top prevent any serious
accidents. Drown proofing with
hands and legs tied, and swim
ming two miles in the ocean fully
clothed were included in the
swimming training.
ALTHOUGH no volunteer may
use these uncommon skills, there
is a transfer value in this train
ing which helps a selection board
to determine how an individual
will react in a similarly tension
filled situation. Other aspects of
camp life included hard physical
labor, language training, and a
short period spent on community
development.
The second two months were
spent at the Catholic University
of Puerto Rico, studying Spanish,
American government, Commu
nist tactics and strategy, interna
tional relations, and public health.
The Spanish language course,
which followed the FSI pattern of
instruction—constant repetition
and little emphasis on grammar
—was excellent, “the only way to
learn a language,” Hawdhorne
said. Other courses had their
faults; because the group of 56
persons was gathered from di
verse backgrounds, much of the
political instruction was carried
on at an elementary level, more
so than was necessary. This prob
lem will probably be corrected in
the near future, he added.

The final month of training
was spent in community develop
ment work and public health
training. Two weeks were spent
working, helping Puerto Ricans
to build low-cost concrete hous
ing. The island government loans
the inhabitants money to build
concrete houses, on the condition
that they put in 30 hours of work
per week toward construction.
Peace Corps labor was donated
to the project to give members a
chance to learn how to work with
people. The volunteers lived in
the same houses, cooked their
own food, and worked nine hours
a day.
DURING the public health in
struction, volunteers were able
to observe two births, talk to doc
tors and midwives, see how a
well-trained public health unit
actually operates in the field, and
learn sanitation techniques first
hand, including the construction
and care of latrines. “If the un
dergraduates in the department
could only see me,” Hawthorne, a

political science major, added
laughingly.
