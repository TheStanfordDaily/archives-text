Editor, The Daily:
Why, vve might ask, can’t Jack
Curtice be a successful coach?
As most of you know, he has just
been fired after an erratic .500
season. In contrast, the Cal coach,
Marv Levy, was recently rehired
after a consistent .100 season. We
must remember that Levy has
certain attributes that Curtice
does not—for instance, a state
supported employer. He can do
what a college football coach
should do: to physically develop
amateur athletes, rather than to
physically destroy professional
ones.

Curtice is not employed by the
state or employed for the benefit
of students. The Stanford Red is
designed to attract alumni dona
tions. Curtice must please the
alumni, graduates of a dark,
chauvinistic era when Stanford
had pitiful academic standards
and outstanding athletic teams.
It is no surprise that the prosper
ous, middle-aged alumnus should
care about football: his Stanford
and his claim to fame are non
academic. It is students, not alum
ni, who call Stanford “The Har
vard of the West.” “After all,”
the alumni would say, “who ever
hears about the Harvard team?
or the Yale team? or the MIT
team?”
There are incompatibilities of
academic merit and winning foot
ball. Traditional football powers
mid-western teams, Notre
Dame, Old Miss—are mediocre
schools; academic giants have
smalltime athletic teams. Few
good athletes will qualify for a
good college, because the mental
distribution curve for athletes is
the same as that for the general
public. Most athletes are medi
ocre students and go to mediocre
colleges. Even qualified students
cannot give the Dean passing
grades and the Coach the profes
sional devotion winning football
requires. The student body, as
spectators and rooters, suffers
(academically) from the same
conflict in a less acute form.

Good private colleges have had
to recognize the conflict between
academic standards and athletic
fame. They must, ultimately, base
their appeals for donations upon
their academic reputations. At
present, the administration is in
the painful transition to such an
academic appeal. Jack Curtice
has failed to produce Big Power
football. I say that’s great. The
administration, by firing Curtice,
has reacted negatively to the
transition to an academic appeal
for donations. Bringing back big
time football will hurt this uni
versity and will fail miserably.
