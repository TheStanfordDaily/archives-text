# MOVIE REVIEW
## Italian Film Riotous Satire On Love, Murder 
### PAGE EDWARDS 
“Divorce—ltalian Style,” win
ner of the Best Comedy award at
the Cannes Film Festival is a
must. Presently, the riotous sa
tire is playing at the Metro The
ater (Union and Webster streets)
in the city to capacity crowds at
two dollars for general admis
sion. So, it should be a long wait
for the flick to wend its way
down U.S. 101 to Peninsula the
aters.

The movie is a caricature of
love and resulting murder in
Italy. The lead, played by Marcel
lo Mastroianni of La Dolce Vita
is that of a frustrated husband
trying to rid himself of his wife,
Roselia (Daniella Roca) so he
may marry his 16-year-old neigh
bm, Stefania (Stefania San
drelle).

SINCE divorce is illegal in
Italy, Ferdanito, who has great
respect for the law, decides to
take the only other alternative—
murder—in order to relieve him
self of his wife. The Italian law
reads that a person who catches
his spouse in the act of physical,
illicit relations with another, due
to the mental anguish and emo
tional turmoil created, may shoot
either his spouse or the stranger
and partner in the affair. The
punishment for such an act is
three to seven years in prison
with possible amnesty.
To sacrifice three years is bet
ter than living with his detestable
wife, decides the pauperly baron
of the house of Chelafu in Sicily.
Ferdanito’s reasoning is that aft
er three years, with a chance for
amnesty, he will still be safely
under 40 and virile enough for
his true love, round-hipped, 16-
year-old Stefania.
But, how is Ferdanito to find
some man, any man, who is at
tracted to his unattractive wife?
Ferdanito admits that once Ro
selia had appeal. He tells us he
married her for her round-hips.
However, Ferdanito rapidly be
came bored with Roselia’s inquisi
tive affection, a curiosity mani
fested in the question, “How
much do you love me?” Ferda
nito, not the analytical type, be
comes so enraged with his wife
he begins to have visions.
AFTER A heated argument
over the soup being brewed in a
big black pot in the backyard,
Ferdanito peers through the
wooden slits in the door to his
balcony and visualizes, through
the smoke, Roselia sweating and
stirring the steaming contents
with a long pole. Ferdanito sees
himself creeping down the steps
behind his wife clad in pajamas
and black cape. Casting the cape
to the ground, he plunges a
butcher knife deep into his wife’s
back. To dispose of the body, he
gently slips Roselia into the pot
and begins to stir slowly until
all is dissolved in the carrots and
peas but a mop of hair and her
soiled dress.

Frustrations reach their apex
when Stefania, his true love, is
sent away to the Convent of the
Seven Sorrows in a nearby vil
lage. Ferdanito begins an earnest
search for a lover for his wife.
The film is hilarious in its en
tirety with no let down in acting
or pace. Ferdanito assumes and
holds a detached and unemotion
al air as he reports his story of
love and murder.

IN THE END, as you may ex
pect, Ferdanito, older and no
longer plagued by his wife, is
basking in the sun on his yacht.
Stefania, his new wife, is no
longer in the Convent of the Sev
en Sorrows and is with him on
the yacht.
