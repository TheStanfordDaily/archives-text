Editor, The Daily:
In view of approaching exams
and dead week it is reasonable
to expect the library and all
studying areas to be considerably
busier than earlier in the quarter.
Is it then too much to assume
that Stanford University, estab
lished as an educational institu
tion, is interested in such mun
dane practical matters as assur
ing its students of adequate study
facilities? Even though Stanford
is renowned for admitting only
superior students, nevertheless,
we seem to be quite human in
that knowledge, wisdom, and a
basic understanding of facts and
underlying principles don’t come
by osmosis.
When for a variety of reasons
many students are unable to
study in their living quarters and
the library becomes noisy and
crowded, the classrooms open on
quad at night are an excellent al
ternative. However, when only
two or three buildings are opened
to students and perhaps only un
til midnight, the comfortable at
mosphere and comparative quiet
are soon lost. Is the additional
cost of lighting several more
rooms for three weeks of each
quarter too great a demand to
make upon this university? I
hope not. I would like to have
confidence that somewhere with
in the administrative hierarchy
someone could see fit to make
more classrooms on quad avail
able for evening studying.
