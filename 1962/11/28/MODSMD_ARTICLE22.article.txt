### MARSHALL COOK 
| In a game that featured all the
j finesse of a bullfight, Stanford’s
freshman basketball team held
off San Mateo 65-52 yesterday on
jthe Stanford court. Two things
about the Indian team became ap- ]
parent in this contest. First of
all, the squad still needs a lot of I
practice together before it will!
jell into a smoothly functioning i
unit. Secondly, the squad lacks
depth. After a fine first unit
leaves the floor. Coach Turner’s
charges begin to look like five
lost tugboats looking for some
one to guide into port.
The frosh have been hurt by \
the absence of Ray Kosanke, the
Arizona All-American who is re
covering from a successful knee I
operation. Kosanke is off of his
crutches already, but will not be
able to begin working out with
the team until January.
While Kosanke mends, 6'6”
Wayne Brazil is holding down
the starting center job for the
Tribe. Wayne is a capable re
bounder on both the offensive
I and defensive boards. George
j Maentz, a 225-pound giant, adds
rebounding strength to the front
line. Lean Bob Bedell, who re
] sembles a flag pole with ribs un
til he starts to play basketball,
has been the team’s best scorer
| and was praised by Turner for
[his fine shooting and hustling.
Rich Baker and Mark Leap pro
vide bench strength in the fore
court.
Skip Hutchison is starting at
one guard for the frosh. He is
the team’s best shooter, possess
ing a deadly jump shot. Jim Pan
dell, the playmaker for the Tribe,
opens at the other guard position.
Bill Goodwin and Warren Boet
cher back up this effective pair.
Tomorrow night the frosh
scrimmages the varsity in what
is billed as the National Hall of
Fame Game, Judging from the
raves being drawn by the varsity
and the quality of the frosh’s
performance yesterday, the game
must be rated as about as even
as the Liston-Patterson fight. The
fiosh may be knocked out in the
first round.
The freshmen play a 17-game
schedule this season, including
j three games with California and
two meetings each with Santa
j Clara. San Jose State, and USF.
