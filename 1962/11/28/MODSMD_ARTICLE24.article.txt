# Huskies Lead AAWU Statistics
## 
### 
Washington retained its lead
in AAWU team statistics last
week, although dropping from
first to last in pass defense. The
Huskies surrendered 3-13 yards
through the air to Washington
Stale, and the pass defense lead
to UCLA, whose opponents have
only managed 99 aerial yards per
game.
Jim Owens’ fanatics retained
their lead in total defense with
239 yards per game, rushing of
fense at 251 yards per game, and
rushing defense, 117 yards per
game. League champion and Rose
Bowl representative USC heads
scoring defense with ;t stingy 55
I points in nine games, and in tolai
| offense with 332 yards per game.
1 Cal slill holds the lead in passing
I offense with 180 yards per game,
j and Washington State has scored
1 233 points in 10 games for that
lead.
USC and UCLA still have one
game remaining, the Trojans
against dangerous Notre Dame
and the Bruins against Utah.
Three of the six individual sta-
I tistics races have been all hut de
cided after ten weeks of the full
campaign. Dave Mathieson and
Hugh Campbell of Washington
State are safely in front for the
passing and receiving crowns.
Mathieson also seems to have the
total offense category locked
away.
The tight scoring race will last
another week, with USC’s Hal
Becisole attempting to surpass
George Reed of WSU. Reed has
60 points for the season, Bedsole
56 with one game remaining. Jun
ior Coffey of Washington may
see his rushing lead evaporate
this Saturday. The sophomore
fullback has only 68 yards on
Willie Brown of the Trojans.

Mathieson and Campbell locked
away their titles with great per
formances last week. Mathieson
threw 21 completions to raise his
total to 104 for the season. Camp
bell caught 10 of those 21 to end
the season with 57 receptions.
Mathieson totaled 286 yards in
the WSU cause.

Washington retained its lead
in AAWU team statistics last
week, although dropping from
first to last in pass defense. The
Huskies surrendered 3-13 yards
through the air to Washington
Stale, and the pass defense lead
to UCLA, whose opponents have
only managed 99 aerial yards per
game.
Jim Owens’ fanatics retained
their lead in total defense with
239 yards per game, rushing of
fense at 251 yards per game, and
rushing defense, 117 yards per
game. League champion and Rose
Bowl representative USC heads
scoring defense with ;t stingy 55
I points in nine games, and in tolai
| offense with 332 yards per game.
1 Cal slill holds the lead in passing
I offense with 180 yards per game,
j and Washington State has scored
1 233 points in 10 games for that
lead.
USC and UCLA still have one
game remaining, the Trojans
against dangerous Notre Dame
and the Bruins against Utah.
Three of the six individual sta-
I tistics races have been all hut de
cided after ten weeks of the full
campaign. Dave Mathieson and
Hugh Campbell of Washington
State are safely in front for the
passing and receiving crowns.
Mathieson also seems to have the
total offense category locked
away.
The tight scoring race will last
another week, with USC’s Hal
Becisole attempting to surpass
George Reed of WSU. Reed has
60 points for the season, Bedsole
56 with one game remaining. Jun
ior Coffey of Washington may
see his rushing lead evaporate
this Saturday. The sophomore
fullback has only 68 yards on
Willie Brown of the Trojans.

Mathieson and Campbell locked
away their titles with great per
formances last week. Mathieson
threw 21 completions to raise his
total to 104 for the season. Camp
bell caught 10 of those 21 to end
the season with 57 receptions.
