## DOSE KEY TO HOPES Tenth Ranked Stanford Favorites to Top AAWU 
### PETE KING 
Stanford, runner-up to UCLA
in Big Five basketball last sea
son, has potentially its finest
team in 21 years. The Indians are
rated 10th nationally by UPFs
pre-season poll, and are every
one’s favorite to win the AAWU
title.
Coach Howie Dallmar has four
starters returning from last
year’s 20-game winning team, in
cluding a 6-8 center who last sea
son became Stanford's third
highest sophomore scorer, behind
the great Hank Luisetti and Ron
Tomsic.
THAT CENTER is Tom Dose,
whose soft jump shots gave him
an average of 17 points per game,
and whose height enabled him to
lead the team in rebounding.

Dose is undoubtedly the key
man in Dallmar’s hopes for a
I great season. Dose had problems
last year on defense, with his in
j experience causing him to foul
out of seven games. However, ac
cording to Dallmar, the lofty cen
ter has progressed quite a bit
since last March. He’s put on
more weight, developed new tac
tics, and should improve on his
excellent first-year record.

The Tribe will have about the
best depth at guard on the Coast.
Loading a three-man contingent
is senior Darrell Sutherland, who
had a sensational season last
year, hitting over 15 points on
four occasions, clinching two
games on free throws, and aver
aging 11 points per game.

PROWLING THK court like a
cat, Sutherland can explode for
13 or 20 points in 10 minutes on
long, arcing shots. He almost
singlehandedly destroyed UCLA
last year, in the Bruins’ only
game here, pumping in 30 points,
the major part of which came in
the first half, when Stanford
scored 51 points.
Alternating at the other guard
spot are Don and Doug Clemet
son, a pair of identical twins who
keep the opposition befuddled
with their ball-stealing and fine
playmaking. They are at their
best when working as a team,
each possessing a sixth sense as
to what the other will do. Dall
mar calls them “two good solid
ballplayers, always dependable.”
Returning at forward is 6-4
junior Hollis Moore, tabbed by
Dallmar as “my best defensive
player and one of the mast ag
gressive on the team.” Although
not a heavy scorer, Moore stays
with his man with the adhesion
of glue, forcing them to fake
many outside shots. Last season
his passes to Dose set up numer
ous baskets.

ON THE DEBIT side, the big
gest blow is the loss of John
Windsor, the team’s second-lead
ing scorer and rebounder last
year, and all-AAWU forward. If
the Indians’ title-aspirations are
to be fulfilled, Dallmar must de
velop a suitable forward to fill
Windsor’s shoes. Senior Bob Som
mers (6-o) and sophomore Bob

Garner (6-6) have been tapped
for the job. Sommers played in
all but one game last year, while
Garner was a heavy scorer for
the frosh team.

Both men are good shots and
quick on defense, but neither has
Windsor’s rebounding ability or
aggressiveness. Right now, Som
mers is in line to start Saturday
against St. Mary’s.
Dallmar's other problem is
finding a reserve center to spell
Dose, who, as a big man, lacks
the strength to play a full 40-
minute game. Two sophomores,
John Murray and Craig Cortis,
are candidates to fill the position

'vacated last year by Mike Ledger
wood. While both have a good
shooting eye. Murray is weak on
rebounds and Cortis lacks endur
ance. However, both have im
proved since practice began, and
Dose may not have to carry too
much of the load after the season
gets underway.
.STANFORD’S offense, which
averaged (56 points a game last
year, will continue to center
around Dose as the post man,
with the fine outside shooting
of Sutherland and the Clemet
sons’ loosening up the defense
when necessary. The defense,
best in the AAWU last year,
should be improved.
In conference play, the Indians
get a break meeting UCLA, their
chief contender for the cham
pionship, twice at home, where
they were undefeated last year.
Cal, with a more experienced
squad, is a dark horse who, with
the aid of 6-10 center Cameron
Wall, may become a title con
tender. USC and Washington, hit
hard by graduation, are expected
to fight it out for the cellar.
WITH SO many seniors gone
in the conference, Stanford
should dominate the individual
statistics. Dose was the fourth
leading scorer, behind three sen
iors, last year. Sutherland topped
free throw shooters, with an 82
per cent mark, while Dose was
fifth in field goal accuracy, be
hind four seniors.
Stanford’s schedule is a con
siderably tougher one this year.
St. Mary’s, Texas, and Wyoming,
whom the Cards meet at home in
December, are all favorites in
their respective leagues. Oregon
State, which plays two games
here in January, is ranked sixth
in UPTs pre-season poll.
After Christmas, the Indians
play in the Los Angeles Classic,
meeting Northwestern in the
first round, then facing Utah
Stale or UCLA.
The schedule for December:
Date Opponent Place
Dec. 1 St. Mary’s Stan.
Dec. 3 Utah Stan.
Dec. 15 USF USF
Dec. 17-18 Oregon Eugene
Dec. 21 Wyoming Stan.
Dec. 22 Texas Stan.
Dec. 26-29 L.A, Classic LA.
