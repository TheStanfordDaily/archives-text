# Proust's Tradition Sums Up French Culture, Says Cohn
## 
### WENDY DORTORT 
The tradition of Marcel Proust
sums up the whole of French cul
ture, said Robert Cohn, member
of the Department of French and
Italian, in a speech given yester
day afternoon in Tresidder.
Cohn spoke on the develop
ment, works, tradition, and repu
tation of the French novelist
whose life work is the fifteen vol
ume production ‘‘A la recherche
du temps perdu,” or "Remem
brance of Things Past.”
THE ENTIRE WORK oscillates
between the two polos of poetry
and prose, with the poetic quality
suffusing the earlier pages; Cohn
feels that Proust was first and
last a poet, in him is a great deal
of that period in French life
which found a “sweetness in liv
ing.”
Cohn said that the Proustian
tradition is one of opposites: ex
treme precision coupled with ex
treme softness and delicacy, fu
sion of a good mind with matter,
resulting in symbolism. The
depth of an experience as con
trasted with a quantity of experi
ences was the factor influencing
Proust, whose own life was rath
er static.

Proust’s reputation in America
is pretty high, stated Cohn, al
though not as high as if was in
the 1920’5; the scrutiny by critics
has rather deflated him lately.
The whole symbolist tradition
suffers from the pragmatic ap
proach of the British, whose low
tolerance for ambiguity is the
reason why many of them are im
patient with Proust, said Cohn,
although his reputation in France
is as high if not higher than ever,
COHN SAID that John Updike
and J. D. Salinger approach
Proust, but they haven’t his
scope. They possess his sincerity,
but lack the depth of tradition
Proust carried into his art. In
Proust, said Cohn, is a secret
form of strength, extreme con
trol and architecture, and a
marked, absolute and clean trans
parent quality.
Cohn does not think that Proust
can be considered the greatest
critic of the twentieth century.
He closed by stating that Proust
was “a potentially great critic
and philosopher and other things,
but fortunately, he let those
things go.”

and J. D. Salinger approach
Proust, but they haven’t his
scope. They possess his sincerity,
but lack the depth of tradition
Proust carried into his art. In
Proust, said Cohn, is a secret
form of strength, extreme con
trol and architecture, and a
marked, absolute and clean trans
parent quality.
Cohn does not think that Proust
can be considered the greatest
critic of the twentieth century.
He closed by stating that Proust
was “a potentially great critic
and philosopher and other things,
but fortunately, he let those
things go.”
The tradition of Marcel Proust
sums up the whole of French cul
ture, said Robert Cohn, member
of the Department of French and
Italian, in a speech given yester
day afternoon in Tresidder.
Cohn spoke on the develop
ment, works, tradition, and repu
tation of the French novelist
whose life work is the fifteen vol
ume production ‘‘A la recherche
du temps perdu,” or "Remem
brance of Things Past.”
THE ENTIRE WORK oscillates
between the two polos of poetry
and prose, with the poetic quality
suffusing the earlier pages; Cohn
feels that Proust was first and
last a poet, in him is a great deal
of that period in French life
which found a “sweetness in liv
ing.”
Cohn said that the Proustian
tradition is one of opposites: ex
treme precision coupled with ex
treme softness and delicacy, fu
sion of a good mind with matter,
resulting in symbolism. The
depth of an experience as con
trasted with a quantity of experi
ences was the factor influencing
Proust, whose own life was rath
er static.

Proust’s reputation in America
is pretty high, stated Cohn, al
though not as high as if was in
the 1920’5; the scrutiny by critics
has rather deflated him lately.
The whole symbolist tradition
suffers from the pragmatic ap
proach of the British, whose low
tolerance for ambiguity is the
reason why many of them are im
patient with Proust, said Cohn,
although his reputation in France
is as high if not higher than ever,
