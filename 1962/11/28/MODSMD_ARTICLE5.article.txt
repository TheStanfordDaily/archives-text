Berlin exchange scholarship may
now be picked up at the HR Loft,
Tresidder Union.
Stanford and the Free Univer
sity of Berlin annually exchange
one student from each university
and assume full responsibility for
his tuition, room, board, books,
and spending money for one aca
demic year. This amounts to ap
proximately 400 marks per month
for the selected scholar from Stan
ford.
THE FREE UNIVERSITY pro
vides transportation from the
point of arrival in Europe to Ber
lin; if the student is eligible, he
may apply for a Fullbright travel
grant to meet expenses from the
U.S. to Europe.
Two scholars may bo sent from
Stanford this year; all interested
juniors, seniors, and graduate stu
dents are urged to apply. Dead
line for returning the applications
is January 14, 1963.
