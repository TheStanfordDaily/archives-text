### 
Phillip Grayson’s “East Wall,
West Wall,” which deals with the
conflicting demands of cultural
heritages and modern society
opens tonight at 8:30 p.m. in the
Little Theatre.

The play, produced by the Stan
ford Players, describes the efforts
of a young writer to find a viable
combination of his Jewish heri
tage and his modern personality.
Playwright Grayson, who is of
Jewish and Irish descent, has said
that this play represents his own

"break with the old world.”

the young writer who must make
this break. Hilda Allen plays Mrs.
Geller, Bernie’s mother, who rep
resents the ties of the Old World.
Playing the other three sons of
the Geller family are Edward
Rosen, Henry Ernstthal and Alvin
Kaufman, all graduate students
at Stanford.

Complicating Bcrnie’s decision
is his romantic involvement with
Verna, played by Carolyn Coon.
This relationship in “East Wall,
West Wall” in brought into fo
cus by the introduction of Bernie’s
cousin, Linda, to whom ho is also
attracted, played by Rhoda Man
heim, a graduate student at Stan
ford. Also included in the cast are
Martha Dow, Garrett Kaufman,
William Louis, and Luke Vania.
“East Wall, West Wall” is di
rected by James Kerans of the
Stanford drama staff; sets are
designed by Marshal Fisher.
Tickets for the six perform
ances are now available at both

West Wall." The Stanford Players production will run from Nov. 28 through Dec. 1 in the Little
