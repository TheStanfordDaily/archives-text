Assignment: find new ways
to reduce vehicle weight
Action: Now under Afmy test, a Ford-designed glass filament torsion
bar that’s lighter, stronger, more flexible than steel
“Looks like you’ve got something there,” the Army Tank
Command said in effect to Ford Motor Company engineers.
“Let’s do a feasibility study on tracklaying military vehicles.”
The story begins in 1957 when Ford engineers conceived
the idea of a plastic-bonded glass filament torsion bar for
vehicle suspension systems. It was a revolutionary departure
from the use of solid steel. It promised dramatic weight
savings in battle tanks, in personnel carriers and other
military vehicles. For example, as much as 1,000 pounds
in medium tanks.
Compared to steel, the tubular-shaped glass filament com
position has greater energy storage potential—is stronger
and more flexible under heavy load, it may well prove to be
the automobile suspension material of tomorrow . , . cars
suspended on glass!
