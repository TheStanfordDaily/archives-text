# 'Work With Crossroads Africa Provides Intense Experience:’ Boysen
## 
### THOMAS BOYSEN 
(Editor’s note: Thomas Boysen worked last
summer with the Crossroads Africa Project in
Southern Rhodesia. A few applications for the
program this summer are still available and
should he picked up in the HR Loft by Friday.)

After flying forty hours from New York to
Paris to Nairobi, three groups of Crossroads Afri
ca, 1962. reached their destination in Salisbury,
capital of Southern Rhodesia. There we were to
begin a one-week orientation session at the Uni
versity College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland to help
prepare us for the several months ahead. From the
moment one week earlier, when we had arrived
in Washington for an earlier orientation session,
the pace of activity had been very rapid. Our first
experiences in Salisbury clearly indicated that an
even quicker tempo would mark our summer’s
work in Africa.
THIS IMPRESSION was justified by the
events of that first Rhodesion evening which found
most of us involved with the university students
in discussions which lasted into the next morning
and stretched our hours of sleeplessness to forty
eight. In applying for positions on Crossroads, we
had, however, asked precisely for this: a rigorous
learning experience. Although motives for par
ticipating in Crossroads are numerous, most mem
bers wished to broaden their experience, not sole
ly in African affairs, but in knowledge and appre
ciation of other people and their ideas.
The orientation at University College was ex
tremely valuable in two ways. First, we came into
contact with students who articulately expressed
the conflicting positions of the white settlers and
of the Africans with regard to the many tense
political and racial questions that now make the
future of the Rhodesias so unpredictable. Second
ly, university professors lectured to us on the
geography, history, sociology, culture and politics
of tfie Rhodesias, thus providing a framework for
the many experiences of the next two months.
ONE OF THE RARE chances to relax came on

the eighteen-hour, one hundred ninety-mile train
ride from Salisbury to the Southern Rhodesian
city of Bulawayo, which was near the location of
our work project in the African township of Tsha
balala. We were met in the Bulawayo depot by the
Tshabalala town council, and from that reception
to the farewell party given by the same group
two months later we were constantly on the move.
In addition to working eight hours a day. five or
six days a week, constructing a four-room brick
school house we kept ourselves involved in the
life of both Bulawayo and Tshabalala.
Sometimes as often as six nights a week, we
were the guests of different African, European
and Indian families. Frequently we left the proj
ect by ones and twos to speak to schools and civic
groups, to visit hospitals, clinics, industries and
farms. We held basketball clinics and song fests.
We attended nationalist party rallies of twenty
thousand where a white face was identified, too
often for comfort, with the opposition party.
OX OCCASION PROMINENT figures, such as
Garfield Todd, former Prime Minister of Southern
Rhodesia, would make themselves available for
discussions. Less glamorous but equally valuable
was the contact with our African neighbors in
Tshabalala. This often took the form of an im
promptu soccer game with the kids or an equally
impromptu gathering with their father’s at the
local beer hall.
Thus, in late August, when we had finished and
dedicated the school, we were all tired but deeply
satisfied. This satisfaction resulted, in part, from
the completion of the school which we left behind
as a tangible symbol of the ideals which inspired
our presence in Tshabalala. Our satisfaction, how
ever, mostly stemmed from an awareness that our
goals of broadened knowledge and experience had
been achieved.
ALE OF US GRATEFULLY recognized that
the intensive nature of the Crossroads experience
had made this gain possible. In no other way
could we have been exposed to the great variety
of situations and opportunities that made the
summer’s work so active, rich, and exciting.

political and racial questions that now make the
future of the Rhodesias so unpredictable. Second
ly, university professors lectured to us on the
geography, history, sociology, culture and politics
of tfie Rhodesias, thus providing a framework for
the many experiences of the next two months.
ONE OF THE RARE chances to relax came on

the eighteen-hour, one hundred ninety-mile train
ride from Salisbury to the Southern Rhodesian
city of Bulawayo, which was near the location of
our work project in the African township of Tsha
balala. We were met in the Bulawayo depot by the
Tshabalala town council, and from that reception
to the farewell party given by the same group
two months later we were constantly on the move.
In addition to working eight hours a day. five or
six days a week, constructing a four-room brick
school house we kept ourselves involved in the
life of both Bulawayo and Tshabalala.
Sometimes as often as six nights a week, we
were the guests of different African, European
and Indian families. Frequently we left the proj
ect by ones and twos to speak to schools and civic
groups, to visit hospitals, clinics, industries and
farms. We held basketball clinics and song fests.
We attended nationalist party rallies of twenty
thousand where a white face was identified, too
often for comfort, with the opposition party.
OX OCCASION PROMINENT figures, such as
Garfield Todd, former Prime Minister of Southern
Rhodesia, would make themselves available for
discussions. Less glamorous but equally valuable
was the contact with our African neighbors in
Tshabalala. This often took the form of an im
promptu soccer game with the kids or an equally
impromptu gathering with their father’s at the
local beer hall.
Thus, in late August, when we had finished and
dedicated the school, we were all tired but deeply
satisfied. This satisfaction resulted, in part, from
the completion of the school which we left behind
as a tangible symbol of the ideals which inspired
our presence in Tshabalala. Our satisfaction, how
ever, mostly stemmed from an awareness that our
goals of broadened knowledge and experience had
been achieved.
ALE OF US GRATEFULLY recognized that
the intensive nature of the Crossroads experience
had made this gain possible. In no other way
could we have been exposed to the great variety
of situations and opportunities that made the
summer’s work so active, rich, and exciting.
(Editor’s note: Thomas Boysen worked last
summer with the Crossroads Africa Project in
Southern Rhodesia. A few applications for the
program this summer are still available and
should he picked up in the HR Loft by Friday.)

After flying forty hours from New York to
Paris to Nairobi, three groups of Crossroads Afri
ca, 1962. reached their destination in Salisbury,
capital of Southern Rhodesia. There we were to
begin a one-week orientation session at the Uni
versity College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland to help
prepare us for the several months ahead. From the
moment one week earlier, when we had arrived
in Washington for an earlier orientation session,
the pace of activity had been very rapid. Our first
experiences in Salisbury clearly indicated that an
even quicker tempo would mark our summer’s
work in Africa.
THIS IMPRESSION was justified by the
events of that first Rhodesion evening which found
most of us involved with the university students
in discussions which lasted into the next morning
and stretched our hours of sleeplessness to forty
eight. In applying for positions on Crossroads, we
had, however, asked precisely for this: a rigorous
learning experience. Although motives for par
ticipating in Crossroads are numerous, most mem
bers wished to broaden their experience, not sole
ly in African affairs, but in knowledge and appre
ciation of other people and their ideas.
The orientation at University College was ex
tremely valuable in two ways. First, we came into
contact with students who articulately expressed
the conflicting positions of the white settlers and
of the Africans with regard to the many tense
political and racial questions that now make the

Thus, in late August, when we had finished and
dedicated the school, we were all tired but deeply
satisfied. This satisfaction resulted, in part, from
the completion of the school which we left behind
as a tangible symbol of the ideals which inspired
our presence in Tshabalala. Our satisfaction, how
ever, mostly stemmed from an awareness that our
goals of broadened knowledge and experience had
been achieved.
ALE OF US GRATEFULLY recognized that
the intensive nature of the Crossroads experience
had made this gain possible. In no other way
could we have been exposed to the great variety
of situations and opportunities that made the
summer’s work so active, rich, and exciting.
