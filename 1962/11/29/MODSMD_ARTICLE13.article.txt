# Peace Caucus Allowed To Present Speakers
## 
### 
Now that a Peace Caucus has been established under the roof
of Political Union, the pacifist movement has a well-deserved
means of expression on campus.
Ever since the Forum for the Discussion of Non-violent Alter
natives to War lost its battle last year to sponsor outside speakers
before open meetings, there has been a vacuum of organized
pacifist discussion open to all students. Last year the Forum went
counter to University policy when it tried to present outside
speakers in meetings open to anyone interested in attending.
Labelling them a partisan group, the University forbade them
the right to present such speakers “with a University platform,”
as the saying goes.
They ran into further trouble when they became engaged ip
partisan activity in protesting the nuclear tests in process last
spring. For the balance of that quarter, they had to submit their
programs to the ASSU President for his approval.
Under Political Union the Peace Caucus will still be unable to
engage in partisan activity, but they will have the opportunity
to present outside speakers, a privilege the University denied
them last year because they were organized independently from
Political Union.
