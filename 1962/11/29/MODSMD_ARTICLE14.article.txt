Editor, The Daily;
Having in mind the differing
circumstances of the two cases,
the Inter-Fraternity Board goes
on record as supporting both the
Beta Chi chapter of the Sigma Nu
Fraternity in its recent stand
against the discrimination clause
in the national fraternity consti
tution and the Stanford chapter
of the Kappa Alpha Order in its
long and effective hut unpubli
cized attack upon the same prob
lem. IFB commends both chap
ters for their spirit and initiative.
Inter-Fraternity Board
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to make it clear to
the readei’s of the Daily that the
Mu chapter of Theta Chi is at
Cal, and that the views of James
Hammill, an alumnus of that
chapter, do not necessarily reflect
those of our chapter here at Stan
fox’d.
Personally, I see no reason to
condemn Sigma Nil’s severance
of affiliation with their national,
nor their motivations for doing
so. Neither do I feel that the
Daily has been out of place in
commenting as it has on the Sig
ma Nu action and the question
of national affiliation. Although
the advantages of becoming a
local fraternity are not as imme
diately apparent to me as they
are to Rick Seifert (an assistant
night editor of the Daily, author
of an article on this subject in
last Monday’s issue), I do not
question that it is the piexoga
tive of the Daily to comment on
this question as it sees fit.
In closing, I would once again
like to divest the members of
the Stanford chapter of Theta
Chi of association with the opin
ions expressed recently by James
Hammill.

Editor, The Daily:
Re Mr. Hammill’s criticism of
Rick Seifert’s Monday article de
fending local fraternities:
Beneath his reasoning tone,
Mr. Hammill seems to have mix
ed motives. He A) wants the
Daily to stop telling people what
they should do, and B) wants the
Daily to be "more positive” by

giving its support to national fra
ternities.

A) Though Daily editorials oc
casionally fail to carry the point,
the paper’s right to criticism is
not open to dispute. The Daily,
for better or for worse, may be
as “patronizing” as it wishes, un
til informed otherwise by the
Supreme Court. If Mr. Hammill
feels pressured by what the Daily
“tells” organizations to do, he
could at least react more intelli
gently than to bare the archetyp
al impulse to restrict the organ
of the opinion he dislikes.
B) Hammill’s deeper motive is
not, of course, to suppress the
Daily; in fact, he urges the news
paper to keep up its comment, so
long as it supports the preserva
tion of national fraternities.
Although Mr. Hammill finally
reveals his real argument, his
reasoning still stumbles. Yes,
there is a case for national fra
ternities. But the case is not that
nationals “are the rule rather
than the exception.” Filth may be
the rule in slums, but its mere
existence does not exclude the
desirability of cleaning things up,
or of taking out the slums if a
superficial cleaning won’t work.
The analogy of slums and na
tional fraternities is naturally an
overstatement, meant to expose
the fallacy of the “argument by
status quo.” But this analogy is
perhaps more accurate than the
one Mr. Hammill draws between
national fraternities and the Boy
Scouts. Even Negroes can join
the Boy Scouts; and once joined,
even they have ample opportuni
ty to earn all the badges.
Mr. Hammill has his point in
recommending that chapters
wishing revision consider work
ing within the national before
secession. But he does not begin
to address himself to the plural
ity of reasons Mr. Seifert’s ar
ticle lists in support of local fra
ternities. It is discouraging to see
that supposedly reasonable peo
ple will obscure the true merit of
an opinion by shifting criticism
to the medium of the opinion’s
expression, or by resorting to the
old rhetorical deceptions which
are used to make a right thing
seem wrong.
