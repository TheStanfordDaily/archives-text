Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Chapter of Kappa
Alpha has not sought publicity
about its part in the national ef
fort to amend the selective mem
bership clause in our Constitu
tion. We axe not seeking publici
ty now. Under the circumstances,
howevei 1 , I should like to try to
correct as much misunderstand
ing of our position as it is possi
ble to do briefly.
First, it is important for any
one interested in our chapter or
in its actions to undex-stand that
we value our connections with
the Kappa Alpha Order. We have
no desixe to have those connec
tions severed.
Second, recent developments
make us confident that our Con
stitution will be amended. At the
1959 national convention our dele
gates were in a small minority
asking for removal of the selec
tive clause. But last year the
convention came within five per
cent of the votes required to
make the amendment carry. We
think the trend is clear.
Third, the Univei’sity authori
ties are fully aware of our prob
lem and encourage our course of
action. It may be less drarrvxtic
than what some of our critics are
urging, but we believe it will
prove more effective.
Paul Chester
President, Kappa Alpha i
Editor, The Daily;
In x’eply to Monday’s editorial
we want to point out some facts
about Stanford football.
It must be made clear that
Jack Curtice is not being fired.
In the coaching business a man
signs a contract with a school and
both parties axe obligated to ful
fill that contract. At the end of
the contract period, if either pax
ty feels it would be to his disad
vantage to renew the contract,
there is no obligation to do so.
Stanford does not owe Mr. Cur
tice a job.
We agree with the editor that
a coach’s win-loss record is cen
tral to his fate. And for the peo
ple who do not play under, or
work with a coach, his win-loss
record is the only reliable criteri
on by which to judge his success
as a coach. Consider what the
win-loss record reflects at Stan
ford. It reflects the satisfaction
of the players and spectators. It
reflects the ability of Stanford to
remain the academic institution
it is and still produce competitive
teams. The win-loss record af
fects gate receipts and Buck Club
contributions, which are the chief
sources of income for Stanford
athletics.
As the editor said, the question
of whether or not a coach has
utilized the full potential of his
playex-s is technical. It can be
answered by the players them
selves. We encourage the leader
to talk to the players and find out
the technical aspects of coaching.
Stanford, even moi'e than other
schools, needs a good coach. The
academic standards and financial
aid program at Stanford put it at
a disadvantage to its rivals in
football as well as other sports.
Not only is the x-ecruiting harder
but the players can devote less
time and energy to the game.
Good coaching can do a lot to
compensate for these disadvan
tages.
To be a good coach, a man must
have the respect of his players.
He gets this respect because of
his coaching techniques, his
method of handling the men un
der him, and his ability to inspiiie
and guide the players as a team.
Because Stanford’s material re
wards axe not as high as else
whei’e, a player plays more for
his own satisfaction. His satisfac
tion and thus, his performance,
are gi’eatly dependent on the
coaching he receives.
Again, we cncoui'age the read
er to talk with members of the

team, to learn more about foot
ball and what makes it go. Find
out from these players what
more there is to football than a
win-loss record, and why they
play the game. Discover some of
the things about football that
cannot be seen from the stands
or xead in the newspaper.
We back the administration in
its decision. We hope the special
needs of Stanford football will be
carefully considered in choosing
a new coach.

ty feels it would be to his disad
vantage to renew the contract,
there is no obligation to do so.
Stanford does not owe Mr. Cur
tice a job.
We agree with the editor that
a coach’s win-loss record is cen
tral to his fate. And for the peo
ple who do not play under, or
work with a coach, his win-loss
record is the only reliable criteri
on by which to judge his success
as a coach. Consider what the
win-loss record reflects at Stan
ford. It reflects the satisfaction
of the players and spectators. It
reflects the ability of Stanford to
remain the academic institution
it is and still produce competitive
teams. The win-loss record af
fects gate receipts and Buck Club
contributions, which are the chief
sources of income for Stanford
athletics.
As the editor said, the question
of whether or not a coach has
utilized the full potential of his
playex-s is technical. It can be
answered by the players them
selves. We encourage the leader
to talk to the players and find out
the technical aspects of coaching.
Stanford, even moi'e than other
schools, needs a good coach. The
academic standards and financial
aid program at Stanford put it at
a disadvantage to its rivals in
football as well as other sports.
Not only is the x-ecruiting harder
but the players can devote less
time and energy to the game.
Good coaching can do a lot to
compensate for these disadvan
tages.
To be a good coach, a man must
have the respect of his players.
He gets this respect because of
his coaching techniques, his
method of handling the men un
der him, and his ability to inspiiie
and guide the players as a team.
Because Stanford’s material re
wards axe not as high as else
whei’e, a player plays more for
his own satisfaction. His satisfac
tion and thus, his performance,
are gi’eatly dependent on the
coaching he receives.
Again, we cncoui'age the read
er to talk with members of the

team, to learn more about foot
ball and what makes it go. Find
out from these players what
more there is to football than a
win-loss record, and why they
play the game. Discover some of
the things about football that
cannot be seen from the stands
or xead in the newspaper.
We back the administration in
its decision. We hope the special
needs of Stanford football will be
carefully considered in choosing
a new coach.

method of handling the men un
der him, and his ability to inspiiie
and guide the players as a team.
Because Stanford’s material re
wards axe not as high as else
whei’e, a player plays more for
his own satisfaction. His satisfac
tion and thus, his performance,
are gi’eatly dependent on the
coaching he receives.
Again, we cncoui'age the read
er to talk with members of the

team, to learn more about foot
ball and what makes it go. Find
out from these players what
more there is to football than a
win-loss record, and why they
play the game. Discover some of
the things about football that
cannot be seen from the stands
or xead in the newspaper.
We back the administration in
its decision. We hope the special
needs of Stanford football will be
carefully considered in choosing
a new coach.

The Stanford Chapter of Kappa
Alpha has not sought publicity
about its part in the national ef
fort to amend the selective mem
bership clause in our Constitu
tion. We axe not seeking publici
ty now. Under the circumstances,
howevei 1 , I should like to try to
correct as much misunderstand
ing of our position as it is possi
ble to do briefly.
First, it is important for any
one interested in our chapter or
in its actions to undex-stand that
we value our connections with
the Kappa Alpha Order. We have
no desixe to have those connec
tions severed.
Second, recent developments
make us confident that our Con
stitution will be amended. At the
1959 national convention our dele
gates were in a small minority
asking for removal of the selec
tive clause. But last year the
convention came within five per
cent of the votes required to
make the amendment carry. We
think the trend is clear.
Third, the Univei’sity authori
ties are fully aware of our prob
lem and encourage our course of
action. It may be less drarrvxtic
than what some of our critics are
urging, but we believe it will
prove more effective.
Paul Chester
President, Kappa Alpha i
Editor, The Daily;
In x’eply to Monday’s editorial
we want to point out some facts
about Stanford football.
It must be made clear that
Jack Curtice is not being fired.
In the coaching business a man
signs a contract with a school and
both parties axe obligated to ful
fill that contract. At the end of
the contract period, if either pax
ty feels it would be to his disad
vantage to renew the contract,
there is no obligation to do so.
Stanford does not owe Mr. Cur
tice a job.
We agree with the editor that
a coach’s win-loss record is cen
tral to his fate. And for the peo
ple who do not play under, or
work with a coach, his win-loss
record is the only reliable criteri
on by which to judge his success
as a coach. Consider what the
win-loss record reflects at Stan
ford. It reflects the satisfaction
of the players and spectators. It
reflects the ability of Stanford to
remain the academic institution
it is and still produce competitive
teams. The win-loss record af
fects gate receipts and Buck Club
contributions, which are the chief
sources of income for Stanford
athletics.
As the editor said, the question
of whether or not a coach has
utilized the full potential of his
playex-s is technical. It can be
answered by the players them
selves. We encourage the leader
to talk to the players and find out
the technical aspects of coaching.
Stanford, even moi'e than other
schools, needs a good coach. The
academic standards and financial
aid program at Stanford put it at
a disadvantage to its rivals in
football as well as other sports.
Not only is the x-ecruiting harder
but the players can devote less
time and energy to the game.
Good coaching can do a lot to
compensate for these disadvan
tages.
To be a good coach, a man must
have the respect of his players.
He gets this respect because of
his coaching techniques, his
method of handling the men un
der him, and his ability to inspiiie
and guide the players as a team.
Because Stanford’s material re
