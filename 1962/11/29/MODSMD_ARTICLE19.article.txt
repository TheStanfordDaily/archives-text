# Increasing Student Participation Accompanies Reduction of Faculty Committee Bureaucracy
## 
### STEPHEN LEOPOLD 
Student participation in the im
portant policy-making commit
tees of the University is increas
ing and may help simplify the
overly complicated procedure of
the present faculty committee
system.

Faculty committees are vital
to everyone connected with Stan
ford. As advisory bodies, they
deal with the President and
Board of Trustees, who are the
final determiners of University
policy.

The committees are divided in
to three sections the Committee
on University Policy (COUP),
(ho Committees of the Academic
Council, and the Presidential
Committees. In the first, the stu
dents have no representation;
their membership is increasing
in the second; and students have
thoroughly infiltrated the last. It
may be coincidence, but bureau
cracy recedes as the student par
ticipation advances.

IN THE COMMITTEES of the
Academic Council, students are
waging a limited war with the
faculty for representation. Also,
this branch differs from the other
two in that it deals with both
policy and administration.

In the field of administration,
it is a nearly autonomous body
while in the realm of policy, it
too is advisory to the President
and the Trustees. The policy
making functions of these com
mittees are the concern of the
student body, and in particular,
student body President Armin
Rosencranz.

What policy and what adminis
trative duties do these commit
tees have? The Academic Coun
cil is composed of approximately
600 faculty members, and it an
nually elects two committees to
represent the faculty in those
areas of administration and poli
cy which pertain to academics.
These two democratically elected
bodies are the Advisory Board
and the Executive Council and
are representative of every de
partment on the campus.

THE EXECUTIVE Committee
appoints six committees to deal
with administrative problems.
The members of those commit
tees are chosen by the Executive
Committee with the help of
Frederic Glover, Executive As
sistant to the President, who
makes sure that no man has too
many different jobs at once. Each
appointment is for three years.

Of these six committees, stu
dents are interested in represen
tation on two —Registrar’s Advis
ory and Undergraduate Admis
sions—since the other four com
mittees deal almost entirely with
administrative details. Rosen
cranz explained the students’ po
sition. “We think the committees
ought to explore further the pos
sibilities of involving students in
policy areas concerned with stan

dards of admissions and proce
dure.”

What type of committee is the
Registrar’s Advisory Committee?
Chaired by Clifford Weigle, Pro
fessor of Communications and
Journalism, this committee has 16
members. It is divided into three
subcommittees and meets only as
a committee of the whole once a
quarter to discuss policy or pro
cedural problems.
IT .SHOULD BE emphasized
that any policy decision made by
this committee is only advisory.
However, recommendations are
usually followed. One policy prob
lem discussed last year was a
proposal to eliminate the grading
curve. This is the type of issue
in which the students feel they
should have a voice.

Chairman Weigle agrees, “I am
generally in favor of student par
ticipation in advisory capacity
where student views are needed,
such as in our discussion last
year- on the elimination of the
grading curve, but we also have
technical and sensitive matters
which should not be aired to
members of the student body.”
This problem may be resolved by
using students on a part-time ba
sis in policy matters only. As di
rected by President J. Wallace
Sterling, each committee will de
cide itself if it wants student
representation.
Even though students may gain
a say in policy matters, there will
still bo the problems of bureau
cracy which is inherent in admin
istrative committees. There are
two x - easons why a charge of bu
reaucracy is valid. First, there
are too many members on each
committee, and paradoxically, the
influx of students will add to this
problem. Scheduling a meeting
for 16 faculty members is tough
work; therefore, a problem like
the elimination of the grading
curve took the Registrar’s Advis
ory Committee three months to
act.
EVEN AFTER A recommenda

tion is reached, the fate of policy
confronts the second feature of
committee bureaucracy the long
line of re-evaluations, many of
which are not necessary.
This fault is best exemplified
by the role of the Advisory Board
of the Academic Council. This
committee is fourth in a lino of
six groups that must approve any
promotion or appointment to the
faculty. The last group to handle
any promotion or appointment is
the Board of Trustees, and these
gentlemen are free to disregai'd
the previous five groups if they
wish. The Advisory Board recom
mendation is followed only be
cause of tradition.

This example of constant re
evaluation is not a rare case, it is
even more typical of the other
two branches of faculty commit
tees.
