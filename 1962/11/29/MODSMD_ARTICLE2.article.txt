# New Poll Union Caucus to Discuss Civil Rights, Partisan Politics Stand
## 
### 
Th o recently-formed Civil
Rights Caucus of the Political
Union will hold an open meeting
tonight at 936 Colorado St. in
Palo Alto. Representatives of sev
eral Peninsula civil rights groups
will be present, including the
founder of the local chapter of
the ACLU and members of
CORE and the Palo Alto Fair
Play Committee.
The new caucus will provide a
channel through which to dissem
inate information and encourage
discussion on civil rights activi
ties, and it is expected to correct
partially the blackout imposed by
the administration’s policy on
partisan political activity.

The group will not be allowed
to engage as a group in action
supporting causes such as aca
demic freedom hut will act to in
crease discussion by sponsoring
lectures, panels, and seminars.
Other probable topics include
capital punishment, censorship,
anrl restrictive real estate clauses.
This intensification of student
awareness is a principal goal,
Chairman pro-tern Marty Lebo
witz said. Another main purpose
will be to publicize and bring to
students’ attention the opportu
nities of participation in local
civil rights groups.
Thus far the caucus has about
20 members. All those interested
in the caucus and its work are
urged to attend the meeting to
night. Rides will leave the book
store parking lot at 7:15 p.m.
