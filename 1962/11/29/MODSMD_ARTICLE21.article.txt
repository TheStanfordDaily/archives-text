The University’s action to seek a new head football coach is a
decision which I feel was, unfortunately enough, necessary and
appropriate. However, the reactions of glee which met this decision
from many students and alumni, are quite inappropriate. So was the
incompassionate contempt which inspired their advocacy to “axe"
Curtice and to “get his scalp” before the decision was finally an
nounced. Neither as a man nor as a coach does Jack Curtice deserve
such sentiment.
Curtice is an excellent coach; he proved this by 33-10-2 record
in the Skyline Conference. Even with his disappointing 14-3(1 record
here, few people, even his critics, deny that his Stanford teams
lacked sound training in the techniques or the strategy of the game.
Their main failing, however, for which Curtice is blamed, was
an absence of emotional leadership and desire which prevented an
adequate realization of their potential. This failing, however, cannot
be traced back entirely to Curtice’s coaching or even to his per
sonality; it stems partially from the conditions under which he has
coached here. "Under different circumstances. Jack might well have
been a winner at Stanford,” said Chuck Taylor, assistant athletic
director and the coach who preceded Curtice.
Sorry Condition of Stanford Football
What are the circumstances which Curtice found here in 19,38?
—primarily, a football team that no one could have won with. Sure,
there was an All-American end, Chris Burford, an All-Coast quar
terback, Dick Norman, and a couple of other outstanding players
such as end Ben Robinson and fullback Skip Face; but there was
little else to work with. A record of five wins in two seasons for
teams with that small nucleus is not bad, especially considering that
six games in that period were lost by margins of three points or less.
Thus, judging entirely by the won-lost records, as football fans
are wont to do, Curtice was branded "loser” from the beginning,
unlike the previous coach, Taylor, who had gone to the Rose Bowl
his first year. Stanford people began to wonder what was behind the
great name of Jack Curtice, in view of his poor won-lost record.
With a personality and reputation like his, it was much easier for
them to see Curtice as a coach who could entertain at a banquet or
convention but not on a football field, then it was for them to look
at the material he was coaching on this field.
By the end of the dismal 1960 season of 0-10, adjectives and
nick-names which had been traditionally associated with Curtice,
such as “wise-cracking” and Cactus,” were no longer used in an
affectionate sense; the Kentucky-bred humor that had been taken
as a sign of his humility and warmness when he was a winning
coach, and which would have been just as appreciated here had he
continued to win, all of a sudden “did not fit into the Stanford image
of a football coach.”
A Change Was Necessary
Although, by 1961, new vitality in the recruiting program, in
itiated by Curtice, started to increase the depth of talent on the
field with each year, Curtice had definitely lost out with the alumni,
the students, and the players. Even with what most people con
sidered winning material, Curtice could only lead his last two teams
to seasons of four and five victories. It was evident midway through
this season, especially after the emotional flops in the Oregon State
and Washington games, that no matter how good the football
material was, a coaching change was necessary to bring out its
full potential.
Curtice more or less spelled his own fate during a pre-season
press meeting, when, speaking about Tulane’s dismal football situ
ation of the last few years and its new coach this year, he said: “If
they (players, students, faculty, alumni—everyone connected with
football at a college) did as much for the old coach as they do for the
new one, the old man could make a tremendous improvement.” It
had gotten to the point here, too, where Stanford needed a change.
Nevertheless, Curtice’s dismissal is also Stanford’s loss. While
he was a keen student and teacher Of the game, he also firmly under
stood the relative importance of football in the context of an aca
demic university: he never demanded of his players that football
become away of life.
A letter from the California High School Coaches Association
underscores this: “You have always represented a symbol for our
young coaches, and your presence here in the Bay Area has con
tributed to the type of philosophy we respect in our coaching pro
fessison.”
With conditions reversed from 1958 and great material on tap
for next year, the university would do quite well to hire another
Jack Curtice.
