# Tribe Gets Favorite's Role

### GLENN ALFORD 
It’s been a long, long time, perhaps as long
ago as the Pop Warner-Ernle Nevers football era.
since Stanford was favored to take all the mar
bles in a major sport. But now, at long last, the
Cards have been recognized officially in pre-season
as Number One. The Bay Area Basketball writers
have picked Stanford to win the AAWU Basket
ball crown.
Other world-famed authorities in basketball
have also picked Stanford the best in the AAWU;
but not best in the West. Dell Publications’ Bas
ketball Magazine is among these. Dell choses Stan
ford as a narrow favorite over UCLA in the
AAWU, but no better than seventh or eighth over
all on the Coast, selecting such as Pepperdine,
Oregon State, Seattle, St. Mary’s and others over
us.
THE UNITED PRESS International pre-season
basketball poll gave Stanford a much better break
than Dell, ranking the Cards tenth best in the
country. A board of college basketball coaches
does UPl’s polling. The only Western team UPI
ranks over us is Oregon Slate, selected sixth. Area
fans will be able to decide for themselves which
team is better January 11-12, when the Beavers
come a-visitin’.
Stanford’s opposition for the AAWU title will
come only from UCLA, USC, California and Wash
ington. Washington State isn’t included in con
ference standings, as the Cougars play only four
AAWU games, two each against Stanford and
Washington.
Strong opposition to the Stanford bid for na
tional glory should come chiefly from UCLA and
California. USC and Washington lost most of their
good players from last year’s teams that tied for
third with 5-6 slates, and probably will vie to stay
out of the cellar.
The Bruins, defending AAWU champs, have
two starters returning, but two outstanding
guards up from last year’s frosh team and two
highly-regarded JC transfers will bear watching.
Returnees are 6-2 guard Walt Hazzard and 6-5
center Fred Slaughter. The frosh hopefuls are 6-1
Freddie Goss and 6-1 Gail Goodrich. The JC trans
fers are 6-5 Keith Erickson, who was at El Camino,
and 6-3 Jack Hirsch, who averaged 23.6 at Valley
JC. Dave Waxman lettered at forward and re
turns.
CAL DEPENDS ON Camden Wall, a 6-10 none
such who flunked out last year but is back. With
out Wall the Bears are hurting at center, but with

him are a potent offensive team. Other important
Bears are 6-0 guard Dick Smith, one of the best
jump-shots on the Coast, and sophs Dan Wolthers,
who at 6-4 will he shifted from guard to forward,
and Mike Henderson, leading Bearcub scorer last
year, who will move from center to forward.
use has a slight edge over Washington, though
neither team can be taken lightly. The Trojans
have 6-7 forward Gordie Martin back, along with
veteran guard Wells Sloniger, The other three
positions depend on unknown quantities. JC trans
fer Bill Morris, California JC player of the year
at Fullerton, and frosh Allen Young who scored
2.7 points and pulled down 17 rebounds per game
with the Trobabes, and Dan Weir and Bob Rene
detti, non-lettering centers behind John Rudo
metkin last year, are the unknown quantities.
The Huskies will depend on 6-5 forward Ed
Corell’s brute strength to earn them their vic
tories in 1962-63. Corell is an outstanding re
bounder and has a good driving jump shot. He
can be handled, as Stanford’s Hollis Moore did
last year in the Pavilion. Moore held Corell score
less. The other four Huskie starters will have to
be gleaned from a mixture of freshmen and re
turning non-lettermen. 6-7 Clint Peeples and 6-8
Dale Easley lead the center candidates, while Ron
Paul and Charlie Hart probably will open at
guard. Both are 6-4.
Washington State keeps only one first-stringer,
Byron Vadset, and since they didn’t win many last
year there’s little reason to suppose they’ll do any
better.
Stanford has a scheduling break, meeting
UCLA twice in what the UCLA press book de
scribes as Stanford’s "own cozy gym." Stanford
definitely rates the favorite’s role, but then so
did USC last vear. All five of their starters were

returning from
a champ ion
ship team, but,
UCLA found a
center, Sla n
ford found an
offense and the
Trojans found
they weren’t
i nvu inerable.
Let’s hope
Stanford isn't
crushed by the
favoring man
tle before the
season opens.

Washington State keeps only one first-stringer,

Stanford has a scheduling break, meeting

Cards have been recognized officially in pre-season
as Number One. The Bay Area Basketball writers
have picked Stanford to win the AAWU Basket
ball crown.
Other world-famed authorities in basketball
have also picked Stanford the best in the AAWU;
but not best in the West. Dell Publications’ Bas
ketball Magazine is among these. Dell choses Stan
ford as a narrow favorite over UCLA in the
AAWU, but no better than seventh or eighth over
all on the Coast, selecting such as Pepperdine,
Oregon State, Seattle, St. Mary’s and others over
us.
THE UNITED PRESS International pre-season
basketball poll gave Stanford a much better break
than Dell, ranking the Cards tenth best in the
country. A board of college basketball coaches
does UPl’s polling. The only Western team UPI
ranks over us is Oregon Slate, selected sixth. Area
fans will be able to decide for themselves which
team is better January 11-12, when the Beavers
come a-visitin’.
Stanford’s opposition for the AAWU title will
come only from UCLA, USC, California and Wash
ington. Washington State isn’t included in con
ference standings, as the Cougars play only four
AAWU games, two each against Stanford and
Washington.
Strong opposition to the Stanford bid for na

California. USC and Washington lost most of their
good players from last year’s teams that tied for
third with 5-6 slates, and probably will vie to stay
out of the cellar.
The Bruins, defending AAWU champs, have
two starters returning, but two outstanding
guards up from last year’s frosh team and two

such who flunked out last year but is back. With
out Wall the Bears are hurting at center, but with

him are a potent offensive team. Other important
Bears are 6-0 guard Dick Smith, one of the best
jump-shots on the Coast, and sophs Dan Wolthers,
who at 6-4 will he shifted from guard to forward,
and Mike Henderson, leading Bearcub scorer last
year, who will move from center to forward.
use has a slight edge over Washington, though
neither team can be taken lightly. The Trojans
have 6-7 forward Gordie Martin back, along with
veteran guard Wells Sloniger, The other three
positions depend on unknown quantities. JC trans
fer Bill Morris, California JC player of the year
at Fullerton, and frosh Allen Young who scored
2.7 points and pulled down 17 rebounds per game
with the Trobabes, and Dan Weir and Bob Rene
detti, non-lettering centers behind John Rudo
metkin last year, are the unknown quantities.
The Huskies will depend on 6-5 forward Ed
Corell’s brute strength to earn them their vic
tories in 1962-63. Corell is an outstanding re
bounder and has a good driving jump shot. He
can be handled, as Stanford’s Hollis Moore did
last year in the Pavilion. Moore held Corell score
less. The other four Huskie starters will have to
be gleaned from a mixture of freshmen and re
turning non-lettermen. 6-7 Clint Peeples and 6-8
Dale Easley lead the center candidates, while Ron
Paul and Charlie Hart probably will open at
guard. Both are 6-4.
Washington State keeps only one first-stringer,
Byron Vadset, and since they didn’t win many last
year there’s little reason to suppose they’ll do any
better.
Stanford has a scheduling break, meeting
UCLA twice in what the UCLA press book de
scribes as Stanford’s "own cozy gym." Stanford
definitely rates the favorite’s role, but then so
did USC last vear. All five of their starters were

returning from
a champ ion
ship team, but,
UCLA found a
center, Sla n
ford found an
offense and the
Trojans found
they weren’t
i nvu inerable.
Let’s hope
Stanford isn't
crushed by the
favoring man
tle before the
season opens.
It’s been a long, long time, perhaps as long
ago as the Pop Warner-Ernle Nevers football era.
since Stanford was favored to take all the mar
bles in a major sport. But now, at long last, the
Cards have been recognized officially in pre-season
as Number One. The Bay Area Basketball writers
have picked Stanford to win the AAWU Basket
ball crown.
Other world-famed authorities in basketball
have also picked Stanford the best in the AAWU;
but not best in the West. Dell Publications’ Bas
ketball Magazine is among these. Dell choses Stan
ford as a narrow favorite over UCLA in the
AAWU, but no better than seventh or eighth over
all on the Coast, selecting such as Pepperdine,
Oregon State, Seattle, St. Mary’s and others over
us.
THE UNITED PRESS International pre-season
basketball poll gave Stanford a much better break
than Dell, ranking the Cards tenth best in the
country. A board of college basketball coaches
does UPl’s polling. The only Western team UPI
ranks over us is Oregon Slate, selected sixth. Area
fans will be able to decide for themselves which
team is better January 11-12, when the Beavers
come a-visitin’.
Stanford’s opposition for the AAWU title will
come only from UCLA, USC, California and Wash
ington. Washington State isn’t included in con
ference standings, as the Cougars play only four
AAWU games, two each against Stanford and
Washington.
Strong opposition to the Stanford bid for na
tional glory should come chiefly from UCLA and
California. USC and Washington lost most of their
good players from last year’s teams that tied for
third with 5-6 slates, and probably will vie to stay
out of the cellar.
The Bruins, defending AAWU champs, have
two starters returning, but two outstanding
guards up from last year’s frosh team and two
highly-regarded JC transfers will bear watching.
Returnees are 6-2 guard Walt Hazzard and 6-5
center Fred Slaughter. The frosh hopefuls are 6-1
Freddie Goss and 6-1 Gail Goodrich. The JC trans
fers are 6-5 Keith Erickson, who was at El Camino,
and 6-3 Jack Hirsch, who averaged 23.6 at Valley
JC. Dave Waxman lettered at forward and re
turns.
