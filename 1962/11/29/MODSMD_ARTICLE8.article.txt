# Belief That Nations Can Avoid War Delays Disarmament, Says Moses

### KATHLEEN DOWNING 
In the global arms race, nations
trust that their opponents are
capable of avoiding a misstep
which could cause nuclear catas
trophe, explained Dr. Lincoln
Moses last night at the Student-
Faculty Fireside discussion on
disarmament alternatives.
Action should be begun “to
ward total general disarmament,
which is the proper goal of man
at the present,” said Moses, of
the Statistics Department, but
this naive trust delays steps to
ward this goal.
“THE EXISTENCE of nuclear
weapons is hazardous,” he said.
Several solutions are advocated,
such as immediate war “which is
of course ridiculous,” he said;
paitial disarmament is also a pos
sibility. Three suggestions for
(his type of disarmament are:
first, unilateral, “which would be
an effective defense measure for
the U.S., but is unwise because it
invites Insecurity.”
A second suggestion is disar
mament only of nuclear weapons.

“Hut the world is still in a posi
tion to resolve its difficulties by
war and presumably the blue
prints for nuclear weapons would
not be lost in case a war were
begun with conventional weap
ons,” explained Moses. Some
groups advocate the “uncomfort
able” position of world disarma
ment of only conventional weap
ons; though use of nuclear weap
ons may be prohibited, the posi
tion is unstable.
IF GENERAL disarmament is
achieved, the problem of the an
archical nation-state system still
remains, Moses continued. “Just
how is a world run which,
throughout its entire history, has
depended on the institution of
war as the solution to all con
flicts?” he asked. Debate ensued
but no resolution was reached on
this major question.
Moses concluded that if general
disarmament is agreed upon in
principle, steps “must be taken
immediately to effect the neces
sary three-to-ten-year dismantle
ment and reconversion. Each mo
ment of the present stalemate
leads us closer to (he inevitable
technical misstep which will be
fatal,” he concluded.
