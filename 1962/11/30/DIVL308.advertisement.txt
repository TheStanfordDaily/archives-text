Admiration for a nice girl
caused this high school boy
from a home of criminals to
live a changed life. He ob
served, respected, and tried to
imitate a good example. Her
daily habits, manners, and ex
pressions inspired faith and
love.
Christ calls us to a higher
and better life. He shows us
that love and righteous friends
are of more value than mater
ial things. He teaches that the
kingdom of heaven can be
within you. He invites you to
be a partner in his fellowship,
body, church, kingdom. For
His Kingdom to be in you, you
must be in him. (in His fellow
ship, church, body, kingdom)
Jesus says that if you love
him you will do his command
ments. Obedience to Christ
can create a new life for you.
Do share your presence
with us as together we wor
ship our provider.
