# Students Work with Faculty on 9 of Presidential Committees
## 
### STEPHEN LEOPOLD (Second of two parts 
Until this year, University policy was form
ulated entirely by the faculty and administra
tion. This quarter, as students are being ad
mitted to the previously all-faculty presidential
committees, students are gaining a greater
voice in policy decisions.

Both the presidential committees and the
Committee on University Policy (COUP),
which has no students and is a most secretive
and bureaucratic committee, are advisory
bodies to President J. Wallace Sterling. Their
recommendations are used by the President
in his reports to the Board of Trustees, who
have the final word on policy.

THERE ARE 16 Presidential Committees.
The President creates them, defines their

powers and duties, and may modify, consoli
date, or discontinue any committee at his dis
cretion. Neither the President nor the Trustees
are bound by committee recommendations.
However, these are no powerless committees.
Traditionally, their advice is heeded, and tra
dition is a pretty powerful factor at Stanford.
Of the 16 committees, students are repre
sented on nine. They make up one-fourth to
one-third of each committee. Student Body
President Armin Rosencranz selects a panel
of names for student positions on the commit
tees. From this list, President Sterling picks
one-half to serve on the committee involved.
No student serves on more than one committee.
A representative example of how this plan
is working out can be observed by studying
the Committee on Student Affairs and Serv
ices. This committee handles such matters as

overnight policy, and sectarian activities on
campus. Problems to be discussed come from
COUP, individual students, or Legislature. The
committee is headed by Dr. Eric Hutchinson,
professor of chemistry, and has 15 faculty
members and five student members. The
students are Armin Rosencranz, Bill Butler,
Maureen Strain, Charles Bischoff, and Karen
Halverson.
SO FAR this quarter, the only problem
brought up before the committee concerned
the overnight policy. A subcommittee was
set up, with student membership, and in a
month they had proposed that a By-Laws
amendment to the Constitution was the best
solution. The committee as a whole agreed
to this and sent their recommendation to the
Legislature. Was there any student-faculty
split on this issue? "So far, students have

not been distinguishable from adults,” com
mented Hutchinson, “and there were no ser
ious disagreements on the overnight policy.”
Miss Strain, agreed with Hutchinson that
there was no discernable student-faculty split
and said, “I think that students can serve
these committees well. Active student partici
pation in faculty committees is a very good
step in the direction of belter policy.”
There are two fundamental problems in
this system. First, the lack of time; a contro
versial or difficult subject takes a quarter or
more to resolve since committees meet only
twice a month for one hour. In their last
meeting, the committees spent the whole hour
discussing a report on sectarian activities on
campus offered by a subcommittee. Although
the discussion was quite lively, the problem
was adjourned until next quarter since the

chairman was unable to find a suitable time
for another meeting this quarter.
THE OTHER basic problem is the constant
re-evaluation, most markedly illustrated by
COUP. This committee does handle some prob
lems originally, but most of its business comes
from the Executive Committee or various pres
idential committees. It would seem reasonable
for the administration to have its own com
mittee to pass on the policy findings of the
all-faculty Executive Committee, but COUP
also judges matters already discussed by the
Presidential Committees, which have admin
istrative representatives.
COUP, with 28 members, and the presi
dential committees, with as many as 20 mem
bers per committee, perhaps could function
more quickly and more efficiently if they
were reduced in size.

this system. First, the lack of time; a contro
versial or difficult subject takes a quarter or
more to resolve since committees meet only
twice a month for one hour. In their last
meeting, the committees spent the whole hour
discussing a report on sectarian activities on
campus offered by a subcommittee. Although
the discussion was quite lively, the problem
was adjourned until next quarter since the

chairman was unable to find a suitable time
for another meeting this quarter.
THE OTHER basic problem is the constant
re-evaluation, most markedly illustrated by
COUP. This committee does handle some prob
lems originally, but most of its business comes
from the Executive Committee or various pres
idential committees. It would seem reasonable
for the administration to have its own com
mittee to pass on the policy findings of the
all-faculty Executive Committee, but COUP
also judges matters already discussed by the
Presidential Committees, which have admin
istrative representatives.
COUP, with 28 members, and the presi
dential committees, with as many as 20 mem
bers per committee, perhaps could function
more quickly and more efficiently if they
were reduced in size.
Until this year, University policy was form
ulated entirely by the faculty and administra
tion. This quarter, as students are being ad
mitted to the previously all-faculty presidential
committees, students are gaining a greater
voice in policy decisions.

Both the presidential committees and the
Committee on University Policy (COUP),
which has no students and is a most secretive
and bureaucratic committee, are advisory
bodies to President J. Wallace Sterling. Their
recommendations are used by the President
in his reports to the Board of Trustees, who
have the final word on policy.

THERE ARE 16 Presidential Committees.
The President creates them, defines their

powers and duties, and may modify, consoli
date, or discontinue any committee at his dis
cretion. Neither the President nor the Trustees
are bound by committee recommendations.
However, these are no powerless committees.
Traditionally, their advice is heeded, and tra
dition is a pretty powerful factor at Stanford.
Of the 16 committees, students are repre
sented on nine. They make up one-fourth to
one-third of each committee. Student Body
President Armin Rosencranz selects a panel
of names for student positions on the commit
tees. From this list, President Sterling picks
one-half to serve on the committee involved.
No student serves on more than one committee.
A representative example of how this plan
is working out can be observed by studying
the Committee on Student Affairs and Serv
ices. This committee handles such matters as

overnight policy, and sectarian activities on
campus. Problems to be discussed come from
COUP, individual students, or Legislature. The
committee is headed by Dr. Eric Hutchinson,
professor of chemistry, and has 15 faculty
members and five student members. The
students are Armin Rosencranz, Bill Butler,
Maureen Strain, Charles Bischoff, and Karen
Halverson.
SO FAR this quarter, the only problem
brought up before the committee concerned
the overnight policy. A subcommittee was
set up, with student membership, and in a
month they had proposed that a By-Laws
amendment to the Constitution was the best
solution. The committee as a whole agreed
to this and sent their recommendation to the
Legislature. Was there any student-faculty
split on this issue? "So far, students have

not been distinguishable from adults,” com
mented Hutchinson, “and there were no ser
ious disagreements on the overnight policy.”
Miss Strain, agreed with Hutchinson that
there was no discernable student-faculty split
and said, “I think that students can serve
these committees well. Active student partici
pation in faculty committees is a very good
step in the direction of belter policy.”
