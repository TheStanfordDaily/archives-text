## Sports, Academics Not Incompatible 
### RICH SAMMONS 
In a recent letter to the editor,
written by Jacques M. Calma,
there was expressed the belief in
the incompatability of academic
merits and outstanding athletic
achievement. To have one, Mr.
Calma says, is to sacrifice the
others. He cites Notre Dame, Ole
Miss, and Midwestern schools as
institutions sacrificing academic
excellence for outstanding ath
letic programs. He cites, as do 99
per cent of all Stanford students,
Harvard as an example of the
outstanding academic institution,
which has not sacrificed its high
scholastic standings solely for an
improved athletic program. He
makes the final generalization
that the two must exist separate
ly, and that any athletic resur
gence should bo thwarted at its
roots.
Is your fear, Mr. Calma, sin
cerely one of a lower academic
standard within the school, or is
it just the fear of losing the im
age that the public now has con
cerning Stanford’s academic ex
cellence? If it is the former you
have no reason for fear because
requirements at Stanford will not
be lowered solely for the purpose
of bringing in better athletes;
and if the fear is the latter, then
I indeed feel sorrow for you, for
you value more the imago you
present as “A Stanford Man”
than you value the real worth of
the education you receive at Stan
ford.
In other words, why can’t Stan
ford remain academically excel
lent, and still strive for the pro
duction of an outstanding ath
letic program? We offer the stu
dents outstanding opportunity in
the academics, why not offer the
athletes outstanding opportunity
In that program? If we achieve
athletic excellence to parallel our
academic excellence, more power
to us. If outsiders are so narrow
minded as to say, "Stanford had
a 10-0 football record, therefore
they must be slipping academical
ly,’ let them, for we know within
ourselves the worth of a Stan
ford education, and is not the
knowing of the truth within your
self far more important than fret
ting over the image you give
someone else.

Why keep trying to bo like Har
vard, when maybe we can be
come belter than Harvard by be
ing Stanford instead of “the Har
vard of the West?” Maybe wo
will never rank ahead or even
with Harvard: maybe we will
never have the public prestige
that Harvard has. but is this so
terribly important? Perhaps we
can achieve excellence, and still
have the humility not to have to
compare ourselves at all times
with other educational institu
tions. Is the public image so im
portant that it should override
the individual confidence that wo
may build within ourselves by at
tending an outstanding institu
tion, and yet not feeling the need
to “toot our own horn?”

There is another important
point that deals with Mr. Calma’s
assumption that academic excel
lence cannot he accompanied by
outstanding athletic achievement.
Assuming that Harvard. Yale,
and Stanford are all outstanding
academic institutions, as Mr. Cal
ma does, let us consider the fol
lowing facts:
1) Harvard has been in the
National Collegiate Hockey
Championship playoffs for ten
years running, and has won the
title on a number of occasions.
2) In 1960 the Ivy League foot
ball champion was Yale, with a
national ranking of tenth. In 1961

have no reason for fear because
requirements at Stanford will not
be lowered solely for the purpose
of bringing in better athletes;
and if the fear is the latter, then
I indeed feel sorrow for you, for
you value more the imago you
present as “A Stanford Man”
than you value the real worth of
the education you receive at Stan
ford.
In other words, why can’t Stan
ford remain academically excel
lent, and still strive for the pro
duction of an outstanding ath
letic program? We offer the stu
dents outstanding opportunity in
the academics, why not offer the
athletes outstanding opportunity
In that program? If we achieve
athletic excellence to parallel our
academic excellence, more power
to us. If outsiders are so narrow
minded as to say, "Stanford had
a 10-0 football record, therefore
they must be slipping academical
ly,’ let them, for we know within
ourselves the worth of a Stan
ford education, and is not the
knowing of the truth within your
self far more important than fret
ting over the image you give
someone else.

Why keep trying to bo like Har
vard, when maybe we can be
come belter than Harvard by be
ing Stanford instead of “the Har
vard of the West?” Maybe wo
will never rank ahead or even
with Harvard: maybe we will
never have the public prestige
that Harvard has. but is this so
terribly important? Perhaps we
can achieve excellence, and still
have the humility not to have to
compare ourselves at all times
with other educational institu
tions. Is the public image so im
portant that it should override
the individual confidence that wo
may build within ourselves by at
tending an outstanding institu

to “toot our own horn?”

There is another important
point that deals with Mr. Calma’s
assumption that academic excel
lence cannot he accompanied by
outstanding athletic achievement.
Assuming that Harvard. Yale,
and Stanford are all outstanding
academic institutions, as Mr. Cal
ma does, let us consider the fol
lowing facts:
1) Harvard has been in the
National Collegiate Hockey
Championship playoffs for ten
years running, and has won the
title on a number of occasions.
2) In 1960 the Ivy League foot
ball champion was Yale, with a
national ranking of tenth. In 1961

In a recent letter to the editor,
written by Jacques M. Calma,
there was expressed the belief in
the incompatability of academic
merits and outstanding athletic
achievement. To have one, Mr.
Calma says, is to sacrifice the
others. He cites Notre Dame, Ole
Miss, and Midwestern schools as
institutions sacrificing academic
excellence for outstanding ath
letic programs. He cites, as do 99
per cent of all Stanford students,
Harvard as an example of the
outstanding academic institution,
which has not sacrificed its high
scholastic standings solely for an
improved athletic program. He
makes the final generalization
that the two must exist separate
ly, and that any athletic resur
gence should bo thwarted at its
roots.
Is your fear, Mr. Calma, sin
cerely one of a lower academic
standard within the school, or is
it just the fear of losing the im
age that the public now has con
cerning Stanford’s academic ex
cellence? If it is the former you
have no reason for fear because
