# Stanford Opens Basketball Season Saturday Against Tough St. Mary's
## 
### FETE KING 
j Stanford’s highly-touted bas
j keiball team should answer a few
| questions about its potential to
j morrow and Monday night when
j the Indians play host to St.
j Mary’s and Utah in Stanford’s
I gym. Game time is 8 both nights.
First to test the Tribe will be
a St. Mary’s team that is consid-

ered a threat for the WCAC title.
They boast two men returning
from the team that Stanford
barely beat, 71-67, last year, and
possess some promising sopho
more talent.
AT FORWARD will be one of
the finest basketball players in
the area, Steve Gray. The 6-5 sen
ior was the only unanimous
choice for the all-WCAC team
last year, and averaged over 20
points per game. He was instru
mental in rallying the Gaels from
a 63-43 deficit late in the game
witli the Indians last year, W'hich
St. Mary’s almost won. He took
high point honors with 25.
At the guard spots will be 6-1
Tom Sheridan and 6-1 Vurdell
Newsom, both fine prospects.
Sheridan garnered 10 points
against Stanford last year. They
will be backed up by 6-3 sopho
more Dick Fagliano.

The Tribe will probably be able
to score against the shorter Gaels
I he only problem appears to be
stopping Gray. Stanford coach

Howie Dallmar will undoubtedly
assign 6-4 Hollis Moore, defen
sive standout at forward, to the
high-scoring Gray. The resulting
personal duel should make for a
highly interesting contest.
THE FACT THAT Stanford
meets Utah on Monday would
have made headlines a year ago,
when the Utes could count on
All-American Billy McGill, cen
ter, for 38.8 points a game. How
ever, Utah commands consider

ably loss respect this season, hav
ing lost McGill, and it should be
primarily a building year for the
Utes.

The only starter back from last
season is 6-2 forward Bo Crain, a
capable forecourt man who aver
ages 11.5 points a game. He is an
outstanding defensive player and
an excellent rebounder, especial
ly for his size. His teammates
will include 6-6 forward John Al
len and 6-5 center Danny Hawes.

The Utes have a height prob
lem, and will probably revolt to
their usual running offense to
compensate for it. Last year with
McGill they averaged 84.8 points
a game, an indication of the ef
fectiveness of their fast break.
Defensive-minded Stanford will
probably slow them down quite a
bit, though. Two years ago a
weaker Stanford team beat a
stronger Utah squad, 59-56, and
thei’e seems to be no reason for
history not to repeat itself.

The Stanford freshmen will
play preliminary games both
nights, against the St. Mary’s
frosh and the San Jose City Col
lege team.

KC’BS will broadcast to
morrow’s Stanford basketball
game against St. Mary’s, be
ginning at 8 p.m. Don Klien
will handle the play-by-play
for the seventh straight sea
son.


DARRELL SUTHERLAND, one of
Stanford's starting guards,
is being figured to be one of the
Indians’s leading scorers this
year. The 6-4 senior starred last
year, averaging 11 points a
game.

j morrow and Monday night when
j the Indians play host to St.
j Mary’s and Utah in Stanford’s
I gym. Game time is 8 both nights.
First to test the Tribe will be
a St. Mary’s team that is consid-

ered a threat for the WCAC title.
They boast two men returning
from the team that Stanford
barely beat, 71-67, last year, and
possess some promising sopho
more talent.
AT FORWARD will be one of
the finest basketball players in
the area, Steve Gray. The 6-5 sen
ior was the only unanimous
choice for the all-WCAC team
last year, and averaged over 20
points per game. He was instru
mental in rallying the Gaels from
a 63-43 deficit late in the game
witli the Indians last year, W'hich
St. Mary’s almost won. He took
high point honors with 25.
At the guard spots will be 6-1
Tom Sheridan and 6-1 Vurdell
Newsom, both fine prospects.
Sheridan garnered 10 points
against Stanford last year. They
will be backed up by 6-3 sopho
more Dick Fagliano.

The Tribe will probably be able
to score against the shorter Gaels
I he only problem appears to be
stopping Gray. Stanford coach

Howie Dallmar will undoubtedly
assign 6-4 Hollis Moore, defen
sive standout at forward, to the
high-scoring Gray. The resulting
personal duel should make for a
highly interesting contest.
THE FACT THAT Stanford
meets Utah on Monday would
have made headlines a year ago,
when the Utes could count on
All-American Billy McGill, cen
ter, for 38.8 points a game. How
ever, Utah commands consider

ably loss respect this season, hav
ing lost McGill, and it should be
primarily a building year for the
Utes.

The only starter back from last
season is 6-2 forward Bo Crain, a
capable forecourt man who aver
ages 11.5 points a game. He is an
outstanding defensive player and
an excellent rebounder, especial
ly for his size. His teammates
will include 6-6 forward John Al
len and 6-5 center Danny Hawes.

The Utes have a height prob
lem, and will probably revolt to
their usual running offense to
compensate for it. Last year with
McGill they averaged 84.8 points
a game, an indication of the ef
fectiveness of their fast break.
Defensive-minded Stanford will
probably slow them down quite a
bit, though. Two years ago a
weaker Stanford team beat a
stronger Utah squad, 59-56, and
thei’e seems to be no reason for
history not to repeat itself.

The Stanford freshmen will
play preliminary games both
nights, against the St. Mary’s
frosh and the San Jose City Col
lege team.

KC’BS will broadcast to
morrow’s Stanford basketball
game against St. Mary’s, be
ginning at 8 p.m. Don Klien
will handle the play-by-play
for the seventh straight sea
son.


DARRELL SUTHERLAND, one of
Stanford's starting guards,
is being figured to be one of the
Indians’s leading scorers this
year. The 6-4 senior starred last
year, averaging 11 points a
game.
