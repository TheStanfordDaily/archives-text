# Dodds Claims Proof A Part Of Humanities
## 
### SANDRA SIMS 
“A certain kind of evidential
proof is just as much a part of
humanities as of science,”, said
John W. Dodds, Professor ojf Hu
manities. at his “last lecture,”
titled “How Human Are the Hu
manists?”

“Both the humanities and the
laws of science must be fit” into
a common framework, Dodd said
yesterday. “Science has its own
aesthetic beauties,” and “meta
phor, symbol, and creativity” are

all tools of the scientists, not ex
clusively of the humanists, he ex
plained.

DODDS defined humanities as
“those studies which find mean
ing in experience.”

One of the problems of the hu
manities is interpretation, he
said. “Abstractions don’t move
men, at least not until they have
been interpreted by man him
self.” he explained.
“I really suspect that good
teaching is spreading a sort of
contagion,” Dodds said. But
Dodds admitted he didn’t really
know the definition of a “good
teacher.”

The humanities deal with all
shared experience, not just gener
alized experience, Dodd said. Ho
explained that the humanities
should give the student a sense
of being a part of history. They
also should give one a quickened
awareness of his own times.

A “SENSE of history . . . puts
in relief a sense of human con
tinuity.” he said.
"Young American writers seem
to have a sense of a rising Ameri
can despair," Dodd said. He felt
that, although some W'riters have
a reason to be bitter, the wise try
to "admire good, as well as to see
evil.”
