## 
###

guard on the AAVVU squad.
Other Stanford statistics show
that sophomore J. D. Lodato was

ing and 219 rushing for a total of
| 635.

ceptions and in punt returns with
six, and Gary Craig was the
I team’s leading punter.

It may not come as a surprise
to many people, but final 1962
Stanford football statistics show
that fullback Ed Cummings, the
only Indian to receive any All-
American mention, didn’t make
it on his offensive performance.
According to Indian final sta
tistics, Cummings, who was
named third team fullback on the
American Football Coaches’ As
sociation All-American squad,
gained only 115 yards during the
season, sixth best on the Stan
ford squad.
But defensive statistics tell a
different story. Playing lineback
er, Cummings made or assisted
in 138 tackles, intercepted two
passes, and blocked two for 142
points, belter than twice as many
as the Indians’ second man, Tony
DeLilLis.
Cummings received another
honor, being named to the All-
AAWU defensive team. Another
Card, end Frank Patitucci, was
also selected as a member of that
unit. Marv Harris, a junior
guard, was named as an offensive
guard on the AAVVU squad.
Other Stanford statistics show
that sophomore J. D. Lodato was
the team’s leading rusher with
357 yards. Quarterback Steve
Thurlow led the team in passing
with 768 yards. Thurlow also
gained 194 on the ground tor 962
yards total offense, best on the

team.
Big Game hero Clark Weaver
was second in total offense.
Weaver amassed 416 yards pass
ing and 219 rushing for a total of
| 635.
In other areas, Patituccl was
the Indians’ leading pass receiver
with 22 receptions. Dick Ragsdale
paced the team with three inter
ceptions and in punt returns with
six, and Gary Craig was the
I team’s leading punter.

It may not come as a surprise
to many people, but final 1962
Stanford football statistics show
that fullback Ed Cummings, the
only Indian to receive any All-
American mention, didn’t make
it on his offensive performance.
According to Indian final sta
tistics, Cummings, who was
named third team fullback on the
American Football Coaches’ As
sociation All-American squad,
gained only 115 yards during the
season, sixth best on the Stan
ford squad.
But defensive statistics tell a
different story. Playing lineback
er, Cummings made or assisted
in 138 tackles, intercepted two
passes, and blocked two for 142
points, belter than twice as many
as the Indians’ second man, Tony
DeLilLis.
Cummings received another
honor, being named to the All-
AAWU defensive team. Another
Card, end Frank Patitucci, was
also selected as a member of that
unit. Marv Harris, a junior
guard, was named as an offensive
guard on the AAVVU squad.
Other Stanford statistics show
that sophomore J. D. Lodato was
the team’s leading rusher with
357 yards. Quarterback Steve
Thurlow led the team in passing
with 768 yards. Thurlow also
gained 194 on the ground tor 962
yards total offense, best on the

team.
Big Game hero Clark Weaver
was second in total offense.
Weaver amassed 416 yards pass
ing and 219 rushing for a total of
| 635.
In other areas, Patituccl was
the Indians’ leading pass receiver
with 22 receptions. Dick Ragsdale
paced the team with three inter
ceptions and in punt returns with
six, and Gary Craig was the
I team’s leading punter.
