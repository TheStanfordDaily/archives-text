bad academic institution itself i :
were co-champs, and in 1962 Har
vard finished second behind a |
Dartmouth team that was unde
feated and ranked 10th nation- |
ally.
3) Yale for the last decade has |
consistently produced outstand
ing swimming teams, their only
challenge in the Ivy League com
ing from Harvard and Princeton.
In the national championships
Yale has consistently finished
high.
4) Stanford under Payton Jor-1
dan has consistently produced J
strong track and field teams.
5) In 1961-62 the Stanford bas
ketball team finisher! with a 20
win. six loss record, and this year
is favored to win the West Coast i
title, a berth in the national play
offs (You’d transfer for sure if
we won that, right, Mr. Calma?),
and is ranked in the top ten
teams nationally.
6) This year the Stanford soc
cer team went to the national
championships, the water polo
team just missed, and for the last
five years Stanford has fielded
an outstanding Rugby team.
Yale, Harvard, and Stanford
have not suffered academically j
because of the above athletic i
achievements. They will continue I
not to suffer because they will
not sacrifice this academic excel- ■
lence just for the purpose of ath- ■
letic improvement. We all strive
to be outstanding, whether it be ]
in a classroom or on an athletic]
field. Few are able to be out-1
standing in both, hut this does
not mean that all efforts to
achieve these goals should be cur- !
tailed. Why not try to be the best j
academic school in the country, I
and still achieve athletic excel- j
lence. the two are not completely
incompatible.
You as a student, Mr. Calma. ]
will not suffer because you at
tend a school that also happens
to have within its student body !
many outstanding athletes. Your I
work will be good or poor be
cause of its own merit, not be
cause of the record of the football
team. Stanford will not suffer
academically, due to athletics, be
cause every athlete that gains en
trance to this institution must
first meet the academic require
ments set up for all students. If!
you feel so superior to the ath- j
lete, then I suggest you attend j
an institution which does not
strive to excel in all areas. And !
if you feel that the presence of
athletes is impeding your educa- j
tion, don’t find fault in the ath- j
letes, take a belter look at your- j
self. Take pride in your own j
work and in Stanford’s work fori
what it is, and its worth to you as !
an individual, not by the image it j
carries with those on the outside. ■
