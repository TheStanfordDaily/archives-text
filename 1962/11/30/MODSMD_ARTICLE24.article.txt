ford Frosh 70, Stanford Varsity
6.7. Of course the frosh received
a 30-point handicap, so the var- 1
sity actually won 65-35, but it j
goes into the record books as a
70-65 Frosh triumph.
The freshmen led all the way,!
having a 47-25 advantage at the |
half, and comfortably leading 1
66-47 with five minutes left. The j
varsity chose that time to run off
15 straight points and come with
in four with 1:30 left. But that
was the varsity’s high-water j
walk, as Skip Hutchinson and i
Rich Baker each sank a pair of I
charities, and the varsity was
sunk.
Tom Dose started out having a
wretched night, and it wasn’t ■
until starting frosh center Wayne
Brazil fouled out witli 15 minutes -
remaining that he faintly re- j
sembled the center that averaged j
17 points past year. Dose ended
up with 20, though he had trouble j
making his specially, the follow j
shot. Hollis Moore ended up be
hind Dose in the scoring with 15. :
The star of the game was frosh
forward Bob Bedell, who led his
team with nine points, and
grabbed off more rebounds than |
anyone else, 11. Others who!
looked good for the Frosh were
guards Jim Pandell and Skip
Hutchinson. Each contributed a j
strong floor game and some long !
jump shots.
The fine showing of the frosh
would lead one to believe that
more than a few freshmen will

be eating early dinner so they
can be on time for the 6:10 tip
off and watch their heroes in ac
tion.
