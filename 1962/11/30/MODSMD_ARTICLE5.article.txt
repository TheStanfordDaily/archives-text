# Ghosts Subject for Spiegelberg Talk
## 
### 
“Tibetan Ghost Traps” will be
the subject of a lecture at 4:30
this afternoon in Room 270. Tre
sidder, by Frederic Spiegelberg,
Professor Emeritus of Indian
Civilization. Some of the ghost
traps will be on exhibit there
until Dec. 20.

While visiting Tibetan monas
teries, Spiogelberg discovered the
ghost traps, which are weblike
contraptions placed on housetops
and over doorways. Although in
dividual traps may differ in size,
form, and meaning, their com
mon purpose is to trap or to drive
away evil spirits.
The particular type is prescrib
ed by a Lama priest according to
the situation.
