# Republicanism Must Widen Itself: Horn
## 
### LYNN SUSAG 
“In the future if Republicans
want a strong and firm America,
they need to be a party for all
and not few,’’ Steven Horn said
last night at Donner House in a
talk on “The Future of Republi
canism in California.” He said
that the future of Republicanism
in America is the same as the fu
ture of Republicanism in Califor
nia.

Horn, a former undergraduate
at Stanford who received his
Master’s degree from Harvard
and his Ph.D. in Political Science
at Stanford, has been the legisla
tive assistant to California Sena
tor Thomas Kuchel for the past
two years. He has written a book
called “Cabinet and Congress”
and is now in the process of writ
ing a book on the party's future.
THE REPUBLICAN Party was
founded a century ago to free
people and now has as its obliga
tion to free people to continue
the strain, Horn said. It needs to
be concerned with world affairs
as well as domestic affairs. He
stated the goals and beliefs that
Republicans agree on: equal op
portunity for all, individual free
dom, a belief in responsible gov
ernment at all levels and a belief
in the co-equal existence of legis
lative and executive departments.
“If the Republican Party is go
ing to mean anything, its oppor
tunity lies in the administration’s
failures,” he said. For the main
weakness, Horn cited Senator Ja
cob Javits’ statement that Presi
dent Kennedy is still acting as a
senator rather than as a presi
dent. He thinks more in terms of
elections than in fighting for pro
grams with Congress and has
flash and show but no real power
behind his recommendations.
Horn gave Kennedy’s handling of
the urban affairs department and
medicare as examples.
The Republican Party has to
have positive alternatives. Horn
said. In the economic sphere, he
said that government has to be
for the public and not only for
business or labor.
