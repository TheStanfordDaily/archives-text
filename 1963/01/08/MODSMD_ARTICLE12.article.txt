# University's Aid Needed For Resident Guests
## 
### 
Yale University lias just received national publicity for its
Chubb Fellows program by which Yale played host for five days
to Jesse Unruh, Speaker of the California state Assembly and
“Jack Kennedy’s favorite California politician” according to Time
magazine. For five days Yale wined and dined Mr. Unruh with
funds donated by Hendon Chubb, an insurance executive and
Yale graduate 95. His gift allows Yale to invite annually five
public dignitaries to spend five days in residence for the purpose
of stimulating interest in public affairs.
This kind of a program with a different purpose has just re
cently been started at Stanford, but for lack of funds it is on a
scale far more modest than that at Yale. If the money is not there,
the initiative is. Last year the Wilbur houses extended an invita
tion to Eric Fromm, and he accepted. The initiative is apparent
also in the joint Wilbur-Stern invitation accepted by former Dean
Allard K. I ..owenstein to spend several days on campus at the end
of this month.
Unfortunately, it is expensive to undertake this kind of a guest
in-residence program—a kind of program that does more to vitalize
undergraduate life than any number of bowling alleys, automatic
pinsetters, homecoming decorations or Sylvester Stomps. For $20,-
000 the University could give honoraria, food, and shelter to fif
teen distinguished guests every year, or one every two weeks.
Dean of Freshmen Dwight Clark describes the guest-in-resi
dence program as “not one speech but rather a close, sustained
contact between students and an outstanding personality, not
necessarily a political figure.” Last year, for instance, the Wilbur
houses hosted Eric Fromm for four days of intensive discussion,
and according to Dean Clark “Fromm turned out to be as inter
ested in what students were thinking as in leading discussions
himself.”
Already invited by Wilbur for the rest of the year are Republi
can Governor of Oregon Mark Hatfield ’4B and the President of
Notre Dame, tin 1 Reverend Theodore Hesburg. Their commit
ments are fairly definite but not final.
If these guest-in-residence programs are to continue and are
to attract visitors from several thousand miles away, the Univer
sity must appropriate money and time to raise money for the fi
nancing of further programs. The men in the house system have
taken the initiative in developing this unique opportunity, but
they need the aid of the University.
