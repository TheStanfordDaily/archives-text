## 'Colleges' Make Cambridge A Town in a University 
### RICHARD NELSON JONES 
"Oxford,” wrote Thomas Fuller
in 1655, “is an university in a
town, Cambridge a town in an
university.”
The “Schools” at Cambridge
originated early in the thirteenth
century. The colleges, now so
much the essence and attraction
of Cambridge life, arrived rela
tively late on the academic scene,
the products of early strivings
and failure, not the nucleus from
which all else w>as to spring.
These colleges are the result of
gradual evolution and growth.
The time element is well repre
sented by the styles of Cam
bridge architecture, which range
through the whole sequence
"from rudest Romanesque to
Grecian sophistication and the
varied, astonishing experiments
of the Victorians.”
IN THE EATER half of the
nineteenth century, as the result
of two Royal Commissions, the
university’s control over teach
ing, which for many years had
been a prerogative of the Col
leges, was restored. Thus there
are two structures- the universi
ty, which has control over teach
ing and the examination of that
teaching, and the colleges, which
are the largely autonomous liv
ing-units. A connecting link is
provided by faculty members or
dons, who are both members of
the various university faculties
and fellows of one of the twenty
some individual colleges. These
men will often lecture under the
aegis of the university as well as
supervise or tutor within a col
lege.
Cambridge is almost entirely
an undergraduate university.
There are no graduate schools,
as they are understood in Ameri
ca, though graduate work and
research is done within all facul
ties. The 7000 or so undergradu
ates enrolled at any one time
have each come for nine terms
(three years), the basic length of
time it takes to get an under
graduate degree. They are en
gaged in a system in which a
great deal of specialization is re
quired. A student on arrival will
elect to “read” a certain subject
say, Engineering, Medicine, Eco
nomics or Law and, unless he
changes his field of interest, will
rarely do or be able to gain credit
for work done in other depart
ments.

Students may, however, deride
to read one year, say, of Econom
ics and two years, say, of Eng
lish. Each course is divided into
two parts, a Part 1, which may
last one or two years, and a Part
2, which lasts the remaining
time. Examinations are given at
the end of each year with the
grading done by dividing the stu
dents, independently of any
curve, into divisions. These are
“Firsts”; "Seconds,” in which
there are two categories;
“Thirds”; “Specials,” which are
the equivalent of a pass, and
lastly those who have failed. No
official grading is done within
the academic year. Though the
intermediate grades may be of
temporary interest for something
like the procurement of employ
ment in a student’s last year, it
is in the light of his final ex
amination grade that his academ
ic achievement at Cambridge will
be regarded once he leaves.
THE METHODS of teaching
vary somewhat between the Sci
ences and the Humanities and, as
the writer is an “Arts” graduate,
his comments will be restricted
to the latter. There are two main
methods of teaching, the lecture
and the supervision hour. The
lectures are organized on a uni
versity basis by the different
faculties and are designed to
cover all aspects of the subject
which a student in any particular
year should know. These lectures,
almost invariably held in the
mornings, are completely volun
tary with attendance being very
much a function of the quality of
the lecturer—decimated classes
are certainly not unknown.

Weekly supervisions are car
ried on within the college by fac
ulty members attached to the col
lege. They consist usually of two
students going to the faculty
member’s rooms in college and
discussing with him for an hour
or more work and reading that
he has set them the previous
week. This will very often be the
only written work that they will
be required to do during the
week. As the faculty member
very often lets the student have
a large say in what they do and
as many examinations only re
quire four out of 10 essay ques
tions to be answered, there is
much individual freedom regard
ing the direction and depth of
studies as well as, within a given
week, their timing.
As seen above the college is
more than a living unit; it is
also a place of instruction. There

are about twenty men’s colleges
and only two ladies’ colleges.
Though all these communities
are independent, they are com
posed of common elements—hall,
court, chapel, library, staircase,
gateway, and combination room.
These colleges range from 250 to
750 undergraduates, roughly half
of whom live in the college either
singly or together in suites of
rooms. Whilst some dwellers may
enjoy the amenities of modern
life, there are others W'ho inherit
the rooms of Wilberforce or
Wordsworth, of Erasmus or
Gray. As a compensation for this
vicarious glory they may also in
herit a journey of at least a
courtyard to the nearest wash
room. Within their rooms stu
dents may entertain, with or
without liquor. They may also
come in contact with each other
in the chapel, on the gamesfield,
in the common room or lounge
and in the dining hall. Dinner in
hall is relatively formal with the
wearing of small black, often
soup-stained, gowns being obliga
tory.

PERHAPS the main source of
power of the colleges is that they
control entry to the university.
Applications are made to the in
dividual colleges; some colleges
require entrance examinations,
others do not; unless a college
can be found to accept a student
he will not go to the university.
Though the criteria for evalua
tion may differ somewhat, the
power of the colleges is circum
scribed by some 80 per cent of
the students being partially or
wholly dependent on some form
of state aid. The state requires
that academic ability be the main
criteria for entry. Regarding fi
nance, $1.500 would probably be
comfortably enough to cover all
a student’s expenses during the
academic year.
There are innumerable clubs at
Cambridge, mostly set up on a
university-wide scale and run by

the undergraduates, catering for
almost every conceivable interest
or idiosyncrasy. Tiddliwinks,
beagling, socialism and flying are
a few of the many interests rep
resented. The political parties.
Conservative, Labour and Liber
al, all have clubs, though enroll
ment is often more a matter of
perceived social benefits rathe.’
than political persuasion.
As Cambridge is only some lit)
miles from London, almost every
week these clubs are able to se
cure the services of some Cabinet
Minister or Member of Parlia
ment to lecture. The politicians
have another outlet in the Union,
he university debating society,
which holds wcoklv debates on
Tuesday evenings. The position
of President of the Union, for
which an undergraduate is demo
cratically elected by his fellow
union members for a period of
one term, is perhaps the most
prestigious undergraduate posi
tion in the whole university.
SPORT also plays an important
role in university and college life,
with rowing and rugby football
being the two most prominent
activities. In every sport the ma
jor match of the year is against
Oxford. This is emphasised by a
player only being regarded as a
member of a particular team for
a particular year if he plays in
this match, even (hough it may
be his only match of the season.
Vast new science laboratories
and the recent addition of
Churchill College indicate the
fact that (he university is alert
to the needs and demands of a
changing world. Yet many of the
nuances and intimacies which
make Cambridge life distinctive
—the bicycles, for instance, and
the river still remain. “Surely,”
said Coleridge, “if the Religio
Loci dwells anywhere, it must be
iwithin these courts,” the courts
lof an universal seat of learning
i now happily blended with a
| charming county town.
