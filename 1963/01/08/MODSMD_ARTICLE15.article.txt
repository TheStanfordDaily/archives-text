# SUCCESS SPOILS STANFORD
## Rating Soars as Indians Win 7; Then Tragedy Strikes in L.A. 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Stanford’s basketball team has
had its up-and-down (singular in
tended! so far this season. It now
stands at the low point of its for
tunes with a tremendous come
back to be made as the AAWU
league play begins tonight.
The height of the Indians’ suc
cess came on December 22 when
they completely dismembered the
Texas Longhorns, 72-46, in the
Pavilion. In the early going, they
pressed the visitors into 10 ball
control errors and allowed them
only seven shots and two baskets
as they ran up a 28-8 lead with
12'/2 minutes gone.
FOR THIS onesided victory,
which culminated a seven-game
winning streak since the begin
ning of the season, Stanford was
rewarded with a fourth-place na
tional ranking by UPI, the high
est a Stanford team has ever been
ranked at any time since the na
tional championship team of
1942. The 7-0 record represented
wins over St. Mary's (81-72),
Utah (81-50), USF (44-43 1, Oregon
(6.3-44 and 34-51), Wyoming (81-
62), and Texas.
Outside of the second Oregon
game where the Ducks made a
great last-minute comeback but
never really had a chance to tie,
the only real scare the Tribe had
came in the USF Gym following
finals week. That night Stanford
blew a ten-point lead early in the
second half due to cold shooting
but finally regained the lead with
five minutes left as center Tom
Dose fouled out. It remained,
however, for Hollis Moore to sink
four free throws in the last min
utel to maintain the Indians’ small
lead as Stanford tried to stall out
the rest of the game.
ALL THE OTHER, more con
vincing wins had followed a sim
ple and secure pattern let Dose
score inside. This was accom
plished by passing to him on one
side of the key, clearing that side
of the court so the defense
couldn’t double team him, and
thus allow' him to maneuver for a
short hood or layup. With Dose
nearly unstoppable in such one
against-one situations, the defen
sive center usually played in
front of him to prevent a direct
pass to him; but this tactic was
foiled by lobbing a pass to Dose
behind this defender for an easier
layup. Occasional scoring bursts
from the outside, primarily by
Moore and Don Clemetson, pre
vented the opponents from con
centrating entirely on Dose.
So, with supreme confidence,
an unbeaten record, and high na
tional recognition, the Indians en
tered the Los Angeles Basketball
Classic two weeks ago, favored
by everyone to win over a field
which included Colorado State,
USC, St. Louis, Washington, Utah
State, UCLA, and Northwestern.
Stanford’s first opponent,
Northwestern, a mediocre team,
was supposed to lack the height
or shooting to match the Indians

and was expected to lose severely.
But hustling like gremlins, they
concentrated on stopping Dose in
side, gambling (hat the other In
dians wouldn’t be able to compen
sate enough by their outside

shooting.
THEIR GAMBLE paid off as
they stayed close throughout the
first half, tied the score at half
time, and opened up a seven
point lead with five minutes left.
Stanford rallied at (hat point and
with the help of three Wildcat
free throw misses and some for
tutious officiating, went ahead as
Clemetson sank two charities
with 13 seconds left. Northwest
ern then, set up a 10-foot shot
which missed but was tipped in
to upset Stanford 62-61.
Throughout the game the Wild
cats repeatedly collapsed three
men on Dose as the ball was
lobbed in to him. Often the ball
was batted away in the air or
knocked out of Dose’s hands.
THE INDIAN'S committed a
total of 16 ball control errors, but
they weren’t all due to the Wild
cats’ tactics. They played slug
gishly all the way. and by the end
of the game, the originally non
partisan crowd was enthusiastic
ally against the favored Indians.

Dose looked downright anemic.
Although he got his normal 21
points, it took him the whole
game to do it whereas he had
usually played only 25 to 30 min
utes. Further, several rebounds
dropped to the floor near him
without even being touched by
him, and not once was he able to
pass back outside as the Wildcats
assailed him under the basket.

The other players were little
compensation for Dose; they hit
less than a third of their outside
shots, ending with a 32.3 per
centage (as opposed to North
w'estern’s 34.5). The Indians out
rebounded the shorter Wildcats
by only one and did a poor job on
the defensive board allowing the
Wildcats numerous follow shots
including the one that won the
game.

Although the Indians picked up
the tempo and looked more spir
ited the next night against USC,
they continued their cold shoot
ing, and their inaccuracy alone
cost them the game, 62-57. Hitting
18.9 per cent from the floor and
46.7 from the line in the first half,
Stanford trailed the Trojans by
16 at the intermission. In the sec
ond half, Stanford closed the gap
to five or six points several times,
but the outside shooting of Bill
Morris and Gordon Martin al
ways kept Troy at least that far
ahead. During those 20 minutes,
however, the Indians had their
only sustained period of note
worthy play. They made 14 of 31
field goal attempts and eight of
10 free throws and outrebounded
SC. 27-14.
THE FINAL NIGHT of the
tournament, Stanford found it
self playing in the preliminary to
the UCLA-Colorado State cham
pionship game, for a chance to
stay out of the cellar. The Tribe
met the only other double loser
in the tournament, Washington,
which was missing its homecourt
even more than Stanford was,
judging by the Huskies’ wins
over UCLA and Colorado State
in Seattle.

Against Washington, the Indi
ans played the same brand of ball
that lost to Northwestern but this
time it was good enough to win.
with the help of two overtime
periods and the disqualification
by fouls of Washington’s first
three guards. Stanford hit 27.3
per cent from the floor but over
came this inaccuracy by forcing
Washington into 16 ball control
errors (compared to five for
Stanford).
As it was, the Indians were for
tunate to get into the overtime.
The Huskies missed three free
throws in the last two minutes,
any one of which would have
clinched the win for them. Stan
ford finally got a chance to try
for a game-tying shot with 19
seconds left. Sophomore center
Craig Cordes, playing for Dose
who had fouled out, took a des
peration shot from 15 feet which
dropped short of the rim but
which was batted around in a re
bounding mele; the ball came
down to Moore who rolled in a
layup to tie the game -at 47-47 as
the buzzer sounded.

THE FINAL NIGHT of the

which was missing its homecourt

Against Washington, the Indi

time it was good enough to win.
with the help of two overtime
periods and the disqualification
by fouls of Washington’s first
three guards. Stanford hit 27.3
per cent from the floor but over
came this inaccuracy by forcing
Washington into 16 ball control
errors (compared to five for
Stanford).
As it was, the Indians were for
tunate to get into the overtime.
The Huskies missed three free
throws in the last two minutes,
any one of which would have
clinched the win for them. Stan
ford finally got a chance to try
for a game-tying shot with 19
seconds left. Sophomore center
Craig Cordes, playing for Dose
who had fouled out, took a des

dropped short of the rim but
which was batted around in a re

down to Moore who rolled in a
layup to tie the game -at 47-47 as

stands at the low point of its for

The height of the Indians’ suc

they completely dismembered the
Texas Longhorns, 72-46, in the
Pavilion. In the early going, they
pressed the visitors into 10 ball
control errors and allowed them
only seven shots and two baskets
as they ran up a 28-8 lead with
12'/2 minutes gone.
FOR THIS onesided victory,
which culminated a seven-game
winning streak since the begin
ning of the season, Stanford was
rewarded with a fourth-place na
tional ranking by UPI, the high
est a Stanford team has ever been
ranked at any time since the na

wins over St. Mary's (81-72),
Utah (81-50), USF (44-43 1, Oregon
(6.3-44 and 34-51), Wyoming (81-

Outside of the second Oregon
game where the Ducks made a
great last-minute comeback but
never really had a chance to tie,
the only real scare the Tribe had
came in the USF Gym following
finals week. That night Stanford
blew a ten-point lead early in the
second half due to cold shooting
but finally regained the lead with
five minutes left as center Tom
Dose fouled out. It remained,
however, for Hollis Moore to sink
four free throws in the last min
utel to maintain the Indians’ small
lead as Stanford tried to stall out
the rest of the game.
ALL THE OTHER, more con
vincing wins had followed a sim
ple and secure pattern let Dose
score inside. This was accom
plished by passing to him on one
side of the key, clearing that side
of the court so the defense
couldn’t double team him, and
thus allow' him to maneuver for a
short hood or layup. With Dose
nearly unstoppable in such one
against-one situations, the defen
sive center usually played in
front of him to prevent a direct
pass to him; but this tactic was
foiled by lobbing a pass to Dose
behind this defender for an easier
layup. Occasional scoring bursts
from the outside, primarily by
Moore and Don Clemetson, pre
vented the opponents from con
centrating entirely on Dose.
So, with supreme confidence,
an unbeaten record, and high na
tional recognition, the Indians en
tered the Los Angeles Basketball
Classic two weeks ago, favored
by everyone to win over a field
which included Colorado State,
USC, St. Louis, Washington, Utah
State, UCLA, and Northwestern.
Stanford’s first opponent,
Northwestern, a mediocre team,
was supposed to lack the height
or shooting to match the Indians

and was expected to lose severely.
But hustling like gremlins, they
concentrated on stopping Dose in
side, gambling (hat the other In
dians wouldn’t be able to compen
sate enough by their outside

shooting.
THEIR GAMBLE paid off as
they stayed close throughout the
first half, tied the score at half
time, and opened up a seven
point lead with five minutes left.
Stanford rallied at (hat point and
with the help of three Wildcat
free throw misses and some for
tutious officiating, went ahead as
Clemetson sank two charities
with 13 seconds left. Northwest
ern then, set up a 10-foot shot
which missed but was tipped in
to upset Stanford 62-61.
Throughout the game the Wild
cats repeatedly collapsed three
men on Dose as the ball was
lobbed in to him. Often the ball
was batted away in the air or
knocked out of Dose’s hands.
THE INDIAN'S committed a
total of 16 ball control errors, but
they weren’t all due to the Wild
cats’ tactics. They played slug
gishly all the way. and by the end
of the game, the originally non
partisan crowd was enthusiastic
ally against the favored Indians.

Dose looked downright anemic.
Although he got his normal 21
points, it took him the whole
game to do it whereas he had
usually played only 25 to 30 min
utes. Further, several rebounds
dropped to the floor near him
without even being touched by
him, and not once was he able to
pass back outside as the Wildcats
assailed him under the basket.

The other players were little
compensation for Dose; they hit
less than a third of their outside
shots, ending with a 32.3 per
centage (as opposed to North
w'estern’s 34.5). The Indians out
rebounded the shorter Wildcats
by only one and did a poor job on
the defensive board allowing the
Wildcats numerous follow shots
including the one that won the
game.

Although the Indians picked up
the tempo and looked more spir
ited the next night against USC,
they continued their cold shoot
ing, and their inaccuracy alone
cost them the game, 62-57. Hitting
18.9 per cent from the floor and
46.7 from the line in the first half,
Stanford trailed the Trojans by
16 at the intermission. In the sec
ond half, Stanford closed the gap
to five or six points several times,
but the outside shooting of Bill
Morris and Gordon Martin al
ways kept Troy at least that far

and was expected to lose severely.
But hustling like gremlins, they
concentrated on stopping Dose in

they stayed close throughout the

Stanford rallied at (hat point and
with the help of three Wildcat
free throw misses and some for

Clemetson sank two charities

ern then, set up a 10-foot shot
which missed but was tipped in

Throughout the game the Wild

lobbed in to him. Often the ball
was batted away in the air or
knocked out of Dose’s hands.

they weren’t all due to the Wild

Dose looked downright anemic.
Although he got his normal 21
points, it took him the whole
game to do it whereas he had
usually played only 25 to 30 min
utes. Further, several rebounds
dropped to the floor near him
without even being touched by
him, and not once was he able to
pass back outside as the Wildcats
assailed him under the basket.

The other players were little
compensation for Dose; they hit
less than a third of their outside
shots, ending with a 32.3 per
centage (as opposed to North
w'estern’s 34.5). The Indians out
rebounded the shorter Wildcats
by only one and did a poor job on
the defensive board allowing the
Wildcats numerous follow shots
including the one that won the
game.

Although the Indians picked up
the tempo and looked more spir
ited the next night against USC,
they continued their cold shoot
ing, and their inaccuracy alone
cost them the game, 62-57. Hitting
18.9 per cent from the floor and
46.7 from the line in the first half,
Stanford trailed the Trojans by
16 at the intermission. In the sec
ond half, Stanford closed the gap
to five or six points several times,
but the outside shooting of Bill
Morris and Gordon Martin al
ways kept Troy at least that far
ahead. During those 20 minutes,
however, the Indians had their
only sustained period of note
worthy play. They made 14 of 31
field goal attempts and eight of
10 free throws and outrebounded
SC. 27-14.
THE FINAL NIGHT of the
tournament, Stanford found it
self playing in the preliminary to
the UCLA-Colorado State cham
pionship game, for a chance to
stay out of the cellar. The Tribe
met the only other double loser
in the tournament, Washington,
which was missing its homecourt
even more than Stanford was,

over UCLA and Colorado State
in Seattle.

Against Washington, the Indi

with the help of two overtime
periods and the disqualification
by fouls of Washington’s first

per cent from the floor but over
came this inaccuracy by forcing
Washington into 16 ball control
errors (compared to five for
Stanford).
As it was, the Indians were for
tunate to get into the overtime.
The Huskies missed three free
throws in the last two minutes,
any one of which would have
clinched the win for them. Stan
ford finally got a chance to try
for a game-tying shot with 19
seconds left. Sophomore center
Craig Cordes, playing for Dose
who had fouled out, took a des

dropped short of the rim but
which was batted around in a re

down to Moore who rolled in a
layup to tie the game -at 47-47 as

The height of the Indians’ suc

they completely dismembered the
Texas Longhorns, 72-46, in the
Pavilion. In the early going, they
pressed the visitors into 10 ball
control errors and allowed them
only seven shots and two baskets
as they ran up a 28-8 lead with
12'/2 minutes gone.
FOR THIS onesided victory,
which culminated a seven-game
winning streak since the begin
ning of the season, Stanford was
rewarded with a fourth-place na
tional ranking by UPI, the high
est a Stanford team has ever been
ranked at any time since the na
tional championship team of
1942. The 7-0 record represented
wins over St. Mary's (81-72),
Utah (81-50), USF (44-43 1, Oregon
(6.3-44 and 34-51), Wyoming (81-

Outside of the second Oregon
game where the Ducks made a
great last-minute comeback but
never really had a chance to tie,
the only real scare the Tribe had
came in the USF Gym following
finals week. That night Stanford
blew a ten-point lead early in the
second half due to cold shooting
but finally regained the lead with
five minutes left as center Tom
Dose fouled out. It remained,
however, for Hollis Moore to sink
four free throws in the last min
utel to maintain the Indians’ small
lead as Stanford tried to stall out
the rest of the game.
ALL THE OTHER, more con
vincing wins had followed a sim
ple and secure pattern let Dose
score inside. This was accom
plished by passing to him on one
side of the key, clearing that side
of the court so the defense
couldn’t double team him, and
thus allow' him to maneuver for a
short hood or layup. With Dose
nearly unstoppable in such one
against-one situations, the defen
sive center usually played in
front of him to prevent a direct
pass to him; but this tactic was
foiled by lobbing a pass to Dose
behind this defender for an easier
layup. Occasional scoring bursts
from the outside, primarily by
Moore and Don Clemetson, pre
vented the opponents from con
centrating entirely on Dose.
So, with supreme confidence,
an unbeaten record, and high na

stands at the low point of its for

league play begins tonight.
The height of the Indians’ suc
cess came on December 22 when
they completely dismembered the
Texas Longhorns, 72-46, in the
Pavilion. In the early going, they
pressed the visitors into 10 ball
control errors and allowed them
only seven shots and two baskets
as they ran up a 28-8 lead with
12'/2 minutes gone.
FOR THIS onesided victory,
which culminated a seven-game
winning streak since the begin
ning of the season, Stanford was
rewarded with a fourth-place na
tional ranking by UPI, the high
est a Stanford team has ever been
ranked at any time since the na
tional championship team of
1942. The 7-0 record represented
wins over St. Mary's (81-72),
Utah (81-50), USF (44-43 1, Oregon
(6.3-44 and 34-51), Wyoming (81-
62), and Texas.
Outside of the second Oregon
game where the Ducks made a
great last-minute comeback but
never really had a chance to tie,
the only real scare the Tribe had
came in the USF Gym following
finals week. That night Stanford
blew a ten-point lead early in the
second half due to cold shooting
but finally regained the lead with
five minutes left as center Tom
Dose fouled out. It remained,
however, for Hollis Moore to sink
four free throws in the last min
utel to maintain the Indians’ small
lead as Stanford tried to stall out
the rest of the game.
ALL THE OTHER, more con
vincing wins had followed a sim
ple and secure pattern let Dose
score inside. This was accom
plished by passing to him on one
side of the key, clearing that side
of the court so the defense
couldn’t double team him, and
thus allow' him to maneuver for a
short hood or layup. With Dose
nearly unstoppable in such one
against-one situations, the defen
sive center usually played in
front of him to prevent a direct
pass to him; but this tactic was
foiled by lobbing a pass to Dose
behind this defender for an easier
layup. Occasional scoring bursts
from the outside, primarily by
Moore and Don Clemetson, pre
vented the opponents from con
centrating entirely on Dose.
So, with supreme confidence,
an unbeaten record, and high na
tional recognition, the Indians en
tered the Los Angeles Basketball
Classic two weeks ago, favored
by everyone to win over a field
which included Colorado State,
USC, St. Louis, Washington, Utah
State, UCLA, and Northwestern.
Stanford’s first opponent,
Northwestern, a mediocre team,
was supposed to lack the height
or shooting to match the Indians

and was expected to lose severely.
But hustling like gremlins, they
concentrated on stopping Dose in
side, gambling (hat the other In
dians wouldn’t be able to compen
sate enough by their outside

shooting.
THEIR GAMBLE paid off as
they stayed close throughout the
first half, tied the score at half
time, and opened up a seven
point lead with five minutes left.
Stanford rallied at (hat point and
with the help of three Wildcat
free throw misses and some for
tutious officiating, went ahead as
Clemetson sank two charities
with 13 seconds left. Northwest
ern then, set up a 10-foot shot
which missed but was tipped in
to upset Stanford 62-61.
Throughout the game the Wild
cats repeatedly collapsed three
men on Dose as the ball was
lobbed in to him. Often the ball
was batted away in the air or
knocked out of Dose’s hands.
THE INDIAN'S committed a
total of 16 ball control errors, but
they weren’t all due to the Wild
cats’ tactics. They played slug
gishly all the way. and by the end
of the game, the originally non
partisan crowd was enthusiastic
ally against the favored Indians.

Dose looked downright anemic.
Although he got his normal 21
points, it took him the whole
game to do it whereas he had
usually played only 25 to 30 min
utes. Further, several rebounds
dropped to the floor near him
without even being touched by
him, and not once was he able to
pass back outside as the Wildcats
assailed him under the basket.

The other players were little
compensation for Dose; they hit
less than a third of their outside
shots, ending with a 32.3 per
centage (as opposed to North
w'estern’s 34.5). The Indians out
rebounded the shorter Wildcats
by only one and did a poor job on
the defensive board allowing the
Wildcats numerous follow shots
including the one that won the
game.

Although the Indians picked up
the tempo and looked more spir
ited the next night against USC,
they continued their cold shoot
ing, and their inaccuracy alone
cost them the game, 62-57. Hitting
18.9 per cent from the floor and
46.7 from the line in the first half,
Stanford trailed the Trojans by
16 at the intermission. In the sec
ond half, Stanford closed the gap
to five or six points several times,
but the outside shooting of Bill
Morris and Gordon Martin al
ways kept Troy at least that far
ahead. During those 20 minutes,
however, the Indians had their
only sustained period of note
worthy play. They made 14 of 31
field goal attempts and eight of
10 free throws and outrebounded
SC. 27-14.
THE FINAL NIGHT of the
tournament, Stanford found it
self playing in the preliminary to
the UCLA-Colorado State cham
pionship game, for a chance to
stay out of the cellar. The Tribe
met the only other double loser
in the tournament, Washington,
which was missing its homecourt
even more than Stanford was,
judging by the Huskies’ wins
over UCLA and Colorado State
in Seattle.

Against Washington, the Indi
ans played the same brand of ball
that lost to Northwestern but this
time it was good enough to win.
with the help of two overtime
periods and the disqualification
by fouls of Washington’s first
three guards. Stanford hit 27.3
per cent from the floor but over
came this inaccuracy by forcing
Washington into 16 ball control
errors (compared to five for
Stanford).
As it was, the Indians were for
tunate to get into the overtime.
The Huskies missed three free
throws in the last two minutes,
any one of which would have
clinched the win for them. Stan
ford finally got a chance to try
for a game-tying shot with 19
seconds left. Sophomore center
Craig Cordes, playing for Dose
who had fouled out, took a des
peration shot from 15 feet which
dropped short of the rim but
which was batted around in a re
bounding mele; the ball came
down to Moore who rolled in a
layup to tie the game -at 47-47 as
the buzzer sounded.

self playing in the preliminary to
the UCLA-Colorado State cham
pionship game, for a chance to
stay out of the cellar. The Tribe
met the only other double loser
in the tournament, Washington,
which was missing its homecourt
even more than Stanford was,
judging by the Huskies’ wins
over UCLA and Colorado State
in Seattle.

Against Washington, the Indi
ans played the same brand of ball
that lost to Northwestern but this
time it was good enough to win.
with the help of two overtime
periods and the disqualification
by fouls of Washington’s first
three guards. Stanford hit 27.3
per cent from the floor but over
came this inaccuracy by forcing
Washington into 16 ball control
errors (compared to five for
Stanford).
As it was, the Indians were for
tunate to get into the overtime.
The Huskies missed three free
throws in the last two minutes,
any one of which would have
clinched the win for them. Stan
ford finally got a chance to try
for a game-tying shot with 19
seconds left. Sophomore center
Craig Cordes, playing for Dose
who had fouled out, took a des
peration shot from 15 feet which
dropped short of the rim but
which was batted around in a re
bounding mele; the ball came
down to Moore who rolled in a
layup to tie the game -at 47-47 as
the buzzer sounded.

Stanford’s basketball team has
had its up-and-down (singular in
tended! so far this season. It now
stands at the low point of its for
tunes with a tremendous come
back to be made as the AAWU
league play begins tonight.
The height of the Indians’ suc
cess came on December 22 when
they completely dismembered the
Texas Longhorns, 72-46, in the
Pavilion. In the early going, they
pressed the visitors into 10 ball
control errors and allowed them
only seven shots and two baskets
as they ran up a 28-8 lead with
12'/2 minutes gone.
FOR THIS onesided victory,
which culminated a seven-game
winning streak since the begin
ning of the season, Stanford was
rewarded with a fourth-place na
tional ranking by UPI, the high
est a Stanford team has ever been
ranked at any time since the na
tional championship team of
1942. The 7-0 record represented
wins over St. Mary's (81-72),
Utah (81-50), USF (44-43 1, Oregon
(6.3-44 and 34-51), Wyoming (81-
62), and Texas.
Outside of the second Oregon
game where the Ducks made a
great last-minute comeback but
never really had a chance to tie,
the only real scare the Tribe had
came in the USF Gym following
finals week. That night Stanford
blew a ten-point lead early in the
second half due to cold shooting
but finally regained the lead with
five minutes left as center Tom
Dose fouled out. It remained,
however, for Hollis Moore to sink
four free throws in the last min
utel to maintain the Indians’ small
lead as Stanford tried to stall out
the rest of the game.
ALL THE OTHER, more con
vincing wins had followed a sim
ple and secure pattern let Dose
score inside. This was accom
plished by passing to him on one
side of the key, clearing that side
of the court so the defense
couldn’t double team him, and
thus allow' him to maneuver for a
short hood or layup. With Dose
nearly unstoppable in such one
against-one situations, the defen
sive center usually played in
front of him to prevent a direct
pass to him; but this tactic was
foiled by lobbing a pass to Dose
behind this defender for an easier
layup. Occasional scoring bursts
from the outside, primarily by
Moore and Don Clemetson, pre
vented the opponents from con
centrating entirely on Dose.
So, with supreme confidence,
an unbeaten record, and high na
tional recognition, the Indians en
tered the Los Angeles Basketball
Classic two weeks ago, favored
by everyone to win over a field
which included Colorado State,
USC, St. Louis, Washington, Utah
State, UCLA, and Northwestern.
Stanford’s first opponent,
Northwestern, a mediocre team,
was supposed to lack the height
or shooting to match the Indians

and was expected to lose severely.
But hustling like gremlins, they
concentrated on stopping Dose in
side, gambling (hat the other In
dians wouldn’t be able to compen
sate enough by their outside

shooting.
THEIR GAMBLE paid off as
they stayed close throughout the
first half, tied the score at half
time, and opened up a seven
point lead with five minutes left.
Stanford rallied at (hat point and
with the help of three Wildcat
free throw misses and some for
tutious officiating, went ahead as
Clemetson sank two charities
with 13 seconds left. Northwest
ern then, set up a 10-foot shot
which missed but was tipped in
to upset Stanford 62-61.
Throughout the game the Wild
cats repeatedly collapsed three
men on Dose as the ball was
lobbed in to him. Often the ball
was batted away in the air or
knocked out of Dose’s hands.
THE INDIAN'S committed a
total of 16 ball control errors, but
they weren’t all due to the Wild
cats’ tactics. They played slug
gishly all the way. and by the end
of the game, the originally non
partisan crowd was enthusiastic
ally against the favored Indians.

Dose looked downright anemic.
Although he got his normal 21
points, it took him the whole
game to do it whereas he had
usually played only 25 to 30 min
utes. Further, several rebounds
dropped to the floor near him
without even being touched by
him, and not once was he able to
pass back outside as the Wildcats
assailed him under the basket.

The other players were little
compensation for Dose; they hit
less than a third of their outside
shots, ending with a 32.3 per
centage (as opposed to North
w'estern’s 34.5). The Indians out
rebounded the shorter Wildcats
by only one and did a poor job on
the defensive board allowing the
Wildcats numerous follow shots
including the one that won the
game.

Although the Indians picked up
the tempo and looked more spir
ited the next night against USC,
they continued their cold shoot
ing, and their inaccuracy alone
cost them the game, 62-57. Hitting
18.9 per cent from the floor and
46.7 from the line in the first half,
Stanford trailed the Trojans by
16 at the intermission. In the sec
ond half, Stanford closed the gap
to five or six points several times,
but the outside shooting of Bill
Morris and Gordon Martin al
ways kept Troy at least that far
ahead. During those 20 minutes,
however, the Indians had their
only sustained period of note
worthy play. They made 14 of 31
field goal attempts and eight of
10 free throws and outrebounded
SC. 27-14.
THE FINAL NIGHT of the
tournament, Stanford found it
self playing in the preliminary to
the UCLA-Colorado State cham
pionship game, for a chance to
