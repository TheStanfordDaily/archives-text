# Cards Face Tough Bear Squad

### ROGER MENDELSON 
Stanford's basketball team sets
out tonight against California in
its conquest to prove that one
L.A. Basketball Classic doesn't
make a season. Game time is 8
p.m. on the Berkeley campus and
tickets are available at the BAC

until 2 p.m.
The game also marks the
Tribe's first move toward the
AAVVU championship, which it
fell two games short of last year.
The Indians now have an 8-2
record in non-league play, having
started the season with seven
consecutive wins but then losing
two and almost dropping a third

in Los Angeles. Until the L.A.
Classic, Stanford was the AAWU
favorite, but UCLA, with a strong
performance in winning (hat
tournament, easily displaced
Stanford. However, after last
weekend’s league play, the league
competition appears to he fairly
well balanced.
CAL BEAT USC twice at Ber
keley and Washington, consider
ed to be one of the weakest
teams, shocked UCLA twice, 62-61
and 67-63, in its Seattle strong
hold. Stanford, at 0-0, stands in
the middle of the league.
Although Cal now leads (he
league, Rene Herrierias’ team
started the season rated at best
as a dark horse in the AAWU. In
fact, as an undefeated team, it
made little impression until it
beat nationally ranked Oregon
State at Corvallis for its fourth
straight win. Although it lost
twice subsequently to OSU, Cal
has beaten every other opponent,
including Seattle, another nation
ally ranked team, for a 10-2 rec
ord so far.
FROM LAST YEAR’S squad,
which finished last in the AAWU,
the Bears lost only one important
player, Denny Lewis. The flashy
passing and dribbling guard was
cut this fall for academic and dis
ciplinary reason. His loss was
softened by the return of Camden
Wall, a 6-9, center, who has been
handicapped by injuries and aca
demic inadequacy since his great
freshman performance in 1959-60.
Wall, along with 6-8 forward
Chris Carpenter, last year’s cen
ter, and 6-7 substitute center Bob
Wueste, has made Cal an excel
lent rebounding team.
The only other significant
changes from last year, other
than the added experience for
most of the players, has been the
surprising offensive production
of Wueste. Sluggish and inaccu
rate last year, Wueste is still no
Oscar Robertson, but when he
had to fill in for Wall, who in
jured a knee three weeks ago, he
scored 27 points against USF.
Since (hen he has scored in dou
ble figures several times using a
wheeling, left-handed hook shot
primarily. With Wall almost com
pletely recovered. Wueste is
again a reserve, but nevertheless,
a significant player on a team
which depends heavily on its un
usually deep and strong bench.
AFTER THE FIRST five of
Wall, forwards Carpenter and
Don Lauer, and guards Dick
Smith and Bruce Ballmer, the
Bears have four top substitutes,
Wueste, guard Dan Lufkin, and
forwards Jim Smith and Dan
Wolthers, who all average eight
to ten minutes of play.
The game tonight, rated a toss
up, matches two strong defenses.
Both teams use a full court press
throughout the game, continually
trying to force ball control er
rors.
ON OFFENSE, Cal’s style is
more deliberate than Stanford’s,
though both try to work the ball
into their center; here Stanford
has an advantage as 6-8 Tom
Dose is a better scorer than Wall
or Wueste; however, the battle
between the two big men will be
the highlight of the contest. The
outside shooting, supplied for

Cal by Dick Smith and Ballmer i
and for Stanford by Don Clemet
son, Darrell Sutherland, and Hoi
lis Moore, is about equal.
Cal’s rebounding should he su- I

perior and may compensate for
any shooting advantage Stanford
holds.
The two frosh teams meet in a
6 p.m. preliminary.

The game will be broadcast
over RGBS at 8.
