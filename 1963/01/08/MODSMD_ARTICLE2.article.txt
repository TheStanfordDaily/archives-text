## 
### 
Although, the identity of the
new Stanford football coach is
still unsettled, one thing is cer
tain a new coach will be named
within two weeks.
“I hope to name the new coach
within len days or two weeks,”
said Athletic Director A1 Masters.
"The longer we wait, the longer
preparations for spring practice
and recruiting for next season
will be delayed.”
The members may suggest
candidates for the job and may
also do much of the actual inter
viewing of the final candidates.
However, their capacity is only
advisory to Masters. In the end,
the actual decision will be made
by the president.
