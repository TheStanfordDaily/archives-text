STUDENTS get into line beside Memorial Auditorium for Registration yesterday. 9131 students, an
increase of 753 over Winter Quarter 1962 were registered. Of those registered 6940 were men and
2191 were women. Registrar Harvey Hall predicted that there will be only a small number of late
registrants due to the long Christmas vacation.
