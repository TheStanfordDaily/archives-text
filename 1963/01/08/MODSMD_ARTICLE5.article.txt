OXFORD, Miss. Negro James Meredith, under increasing pres
sure from slipping grades and shooting incidents involving his
family, said Monday that “unless definite and positive changes are
j made” he will not register for the next semester at the University
} of Mississippi. The statement by Meredith, brought an immediate
appeal from U.S- A tty, Oen. Robert F. Kennedy that state and uni
versity officials meet the conditions. Kennedy said if Meredith
leaves the school “it would bo a reflection” on the entire United
States. He also urged Meredith to consider “hopes of many of his
fellow citizens” before withdrawing.
Meredith noted that he was not quitting the school outright,
“rather my decision is not to attend the university next semester
j under the present circumstances.” University Chancellor John D.
j Williams said he did not know what Meredith meant “and until I
I do I will have no statement.”
