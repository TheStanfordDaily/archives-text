# Behavioral Center Probes Man's 'Race' With Technology
## 
### NORMAN GREENBERG 
The Center for the Advanced
Study of the Behavioral Sciences,
located on a knoll a mile west of
(ho Stanford campus, is unique
in a world which has devoted it
self for the last several centuries
primarily to basic research in the
physical sciences. The inability of
society to cope with technological
achievement is the central enig
ma which the center (initial
named Casbah is designed to
combat.
The research carried on (here
probes into the very nature of
man and his society. This includes
a study of primate behavior and
its correlation to the behavior of
man. an examination of the prob
lems of increasing labor compe
tence. the development of a new
philosophy of history, the devel
opment of computers which imi
tate the human brain’s capacity
to make decisions, and an exami
nation into the problem of how
to change the Russian attitude
of hostility towards the West.
CASBAH was founded upon the
suggestion of a committee of sci
entists to the Ford Foundation,
which appropriated $3.5 million
for the construction of its modern
; redwood-apd-glass buildings and
for its maintenance during the
first five years of operation.
Each year since its founding in
; 1954, Casbah has granted fifty
post-doctoral fellowships to out
j standing behavioral scientists,
j who represent such fields as soci
ology. psychology, philosophy.
} anthropology, history, economics,
j political science, linguistics, edu
j cation. English, literature, law,
j statistics, zoology, and fine arts.
The fellows are chosen from
[ thousands of nominations sub-
I milted by universities and re

search institutions throughout
the world, including communist
countries.
The center pays the fellows
their regular salaries and allows
them to pursue their interests
without restriction or compulsion
of any kind. They continue their
educations and engage in basic
research.
Dr. Ralph W. Tyler, director of
the center, explained that Casbah
is located at Stanford because 70
per cent of the original fellows
expressed desire to work in the
San Francisco Bay Area. This
area interested them more than
such other areas as Boston and
New York because of the climate,
the relative isolation from the
rest of the country, and the
■ available facilities. The center is
able to borrow materials from
the Stanford library.
TYLKR says that the goal of the
| center is to encourage basic re-
I search in the behavioral sciences
j because an increasing under
standing of man's thinking must
be achieved before modern tech
i nology can be successfully incor
j pointed into his societies. Tyler
| cites the case of Indians who are
I unable to incorporate modern
J technology into their lives be-
I cause their religious and mysti
| cal doctrines forbid such essen
tials as saving currency or goods.
Previous research carried on
; in the center. Dr, Tyler explained.
| has served the center’s purpose
| by analyzing areas of disharmony
j between man and his environ
ment; psychiatrists have explored
i the cause of mental breakdown,
searching for the points of con
! flict between man and his envi
ronment; sociologists have ex
amined the effect of crowding on
| human beings, finding that ex-
I cessivo crowding worsens rela

lions between men; and fellows
have examined the role of educa
tion in increased technology up
on the premise that an improve
ment in the human being is a pre
requisite to alvance culture.
Armed with the tools and pro
cedures of mathematics and cm

ploying the experimental meth
ods of physical science, behavior
al scientists at the Center for the
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences continue to search with
in the depths of man. and one
can only hope that man’s nature
is amenable to such probing.

for its maintenance during the
first five years of operation.
Each year since its founding in
; 1954, Casbah has granted fifty
post-doctoral fellowships to out
j standing behavioral scientists,
j who represent such fields as soci
ology. psychology, philosophy.
} anthropology, history, economics,
j political science, linguistics, edu
j cation. English, literature, law,
j statistics, zoology, and fine arts.
The fellows are chosen from
[ thousands of nominations sub-
I milted by universities and re

search institutions throughout
the world, including communist
countries.
The center pays the fellows
their regular salaries and allows
them to pursue their interests
without restriction or compulsion
of any kind. They continue their
educations and engage in basic
research.
Dr. Ralph W. Tyler, director of
the center, explained that Casbah
is located at Stanford because 70
per cent of the original fellows
expressed desire to work in the
San Francisco Bay Area. This
area interested them more than
such other areas as Boston and
New York because of the climate,
the relative isolation from the
rest of the country, and the
■ available facilities. The center is
able to borrow materials from
the Stanford library.
TYLKR says that the goal of the
| center is to encourage basic re-
I search in the behavioral sciences
j because an increasing under
standing of man's thinking must
be achieved before modern tech
i nology can be successfully incor
j pointed into his societies. Tyler
| cites the case of Indians who are
I unable to incorporate modern
J technology into their lives be-
I cause their religious and mysti
| cal doctrines forbid such essen
tials as saving currency or goods.
Previous research carried on
; in the center. Dr, Tyler explained.
| has served the center’s purpose
| by analyzing areas of disharmony
j between man and his environ
ment; psychiatrists have explored
i the cause of mental breakdown,
searching for the points of con
! flict between man and his envi
ronment; sociologists have ex
amined the effect of crowding on
| human beings, finding that ex-
I cessivo crowding worsens rela

lions between men; and fellows
have examined the role of educa
tion in increased technology up
on the premise that an improve
ment in the human being is a pre
requisite to alvance culture.
Armed with the tools and pro
cedures of mathematics and cm

ploying the experimental meth
ods of physical science, behavior
al scientists at the Center for the
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences continue to search with
in the depths of man. and one
can only hope that man’s nature
is amenable to such probing.
