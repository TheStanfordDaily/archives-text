# Beverage Board Voids Restaurant Liquor Ban
## 
### PAGE EDWARDS JR 
Restaurants now serving beer may soon appear one step Ironi
the Stanford campus boundary with hard liquor on the menu.
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has ruled that the law
banning on-sale liquor licenses to restaurants within a mile of
university campuses is “unconstitutional, invalid and void. The

ruling, however, can he
to the courts by ABC department
officials.
According to Doyle Jenson,
special investigator for the De
partment of Alcohol Beverage
Control in San Jose, the law -
i before it was declared unconsti
tutional—was that a restaurant
1 within a mile of a university
{ campus could not get a hard
liquor license unless it could
prove it would not be patronized
by students. Such proof is diffi
cult, and the department auto
matically denies such applications
for a license, Jensen said.
The ruling affects only restau
rants and beer parlors which
have restaurant licenses. Bars
where no food is served are still
prohibited within a mile and a
half of a campus.
THE KEEK change would prob
j ably not effect “old Palo Alto,”
according to the Palo Alto Times,
where a deed restriction on all
| lands provides that if liquor is
sold or made on the premises the
ownership of the land will revert
■ to Stanford. This clause was in
| itiated by Timothy Hopkins, who
j owned the land at the time Palo
I Alto was founded, at the request
I of Senator Leland Stanford.
Newer areas of Palo Alto, in
cluding South Palo Alto, are ex
empt from the deed restriction.
In the past five years or so,
according to Robert E, Michael
| ski, Palo Alto city attorney, beer
I licenses have been granted to
restaurants, bars and stores with-
I in a mile and a half of the cam

pus. This stems from a state
ruling making beer and wine, in
effect, non-alcoholic.
At Stanford, a spokesman said
the university would have no
comment on the ruling until fur
ther information was received.
Palo Alto has “vigorously pro
tested” granting liquor licenses
in the city limits other than on
El Camino Real, Michaelski said.
If the change stands up under
court lest. Michaelski continued,
restaurants outside of the old
town’s limits generally south of
Embarcadero Road—could sell
liquor.

restaurants outside of the old
town’s limits generally south of
Embarcadero Road—could sell
liquor.
Restaurants now serving beer may soon appear one step Ironi
the Stanford campus boundary with hard liquor on the menu.
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has ruled that the law
banning on-sale liquor licenses to restaurants within a mile of
university campuses is “unconstitutional, invalid and void. The

ruling, however, can he
to the courts by ABC department
officials.
According to Doyle Jenson,
special investigator for the De
partment of Alcohol Beverage
Control in San Jose, the law -
i before it was declared unconsti
tutional—was that a restaurant
1 within a mile of a university
{ campus could not get a hard
liquor license unless it could
prove it would not be patronized
by students. Such proof is diffi
cult, and the department auto
matically denies such applications
for a license, Jensen said.
The ruling affects only restau
rants and beer parlors which
have restaurant licenses. Bars
where no food is served are still
prohibited within a mile and a
half of a campus.
THE KEEK change would prob
j ably not effect “old Palo Alto,”
according to the Palo Alto Times,
where a deed restriction on all
| lands provides that if liquor is
sold or made on the premises the
ownership of the land will revert
■ to Stanford. This clause was in
| itiated by Timothy Hopkins, who
j owned the land at the time Palo
I Alto was founded, at the request
I of Senator Leland Stanford.
Newer areas of Palo Alto, in
cluding South Palo Alto, are ex
empt from the deed restriction.
In the past five years or so,
according to Robert E, Michael

I licenses have been granted to
restaurants, bars and stores with-
I in a mile and a half of the cam

pus. This stems from a state
ruling making beer and wine, in
effect, non-alcoholic.
At Stanford, a spokesman said
the university would have no
comment on the ruling until fur
ther information was received.
Palo Alto has “vigorously pro
tested” granting liquor licenses
