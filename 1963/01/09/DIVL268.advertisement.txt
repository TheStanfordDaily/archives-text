A GUIDE FOR THE UNMONEYED
R. L. Sigafoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when ho finished
high school ho wished mightily to go on with his education. It
seemed, however, a forlorn hope. R. L.’s father could not send
the boy to college because a series of crop failures had brought
him to the brink of disaster. (R. L.’s father raised orchids which,
in North Dakota, is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.)
It was, therefore, squarely up to R. L. Tie could go to college
only if he worked his way through. This was a prospect that
dismayed him. lie had a deep-seated fear that the task would
be too great, that he would never be able to carry on a full, busy
college life and still fir. ,1 time to do odd jobs and make money.
Racked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pondering
his dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he came upon a
park bench and sat down and lit a Marlboro cigarette. R. L.
always lit a Marlboro when he was low in his mind. R. L. also
always lit a Marlboro when he was merry. The fact is there is
no occasion—happy or sad, pensive or exuberant, cheery or
solemn —when Marlboro with its fine filter and fine flavor is
not entirely welcome, as you will discover when you go to your
favorite tobacconist and buy some, as we—the makers of
Marlboro and I and R. L. Sigafoos—hope you will do real soon.
Sitting and thinking and smoking a Marlboro on the park
bench, R. L. was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, “My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?”

Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with wispy,
snow-white hair. His skin was almost transparent, showing a
delicate tracery of fragile bones beneath. His back was bent,
and his hands trembled. But his eyes were bright and clear.
R. L. looked into those eyes, into the wrinkled face. He saw
wisdom there, and experience, and kindness. “Do you think,
sir, said 11. L., “that a boy can work his way through college
and still enjoy a rich, full campus life?”
“Why, bless you, son,” replied the stranger with a rheumy
chuckle, “of course you can. In fact, I did it myself.”
“Was it very hard?” asked R. L.
“Fes, it was hard,” the stranger admitted. “But when one
is young, all things are possible. I, for example, used to get up
at five o’clock every morning to stoke the furnace at the SAK
house. At six I had to milk the ewes at the school of animal
husbandry. At seven I gave a fencing lesson to the Dean of
Women. At eight I had a class in early Runic poets. At nine I
gave haircuts at the Gamma Phi Beta house. At ten I had dif
ferential calculus. At eleven I posed for a life class. At twelve
1 watered soup at the Union. At one I had a class in Oriental
languages. At two 1 exercised the mice in psych lab. At three
1 gave the Dean of Women another fencing lesson. At four I
had qualitative analysis. At five I went clamming. At six I cut
meat for the football team. At seven I ushed at the movies. At
eight I had my ears pierced so that at nine 1 could tell fortunes
in a gypsy tearoom. At ten I had a class in astronomy. At
eleven I tucked in the football team. At twelve I studied and
at three I went to sleep.”
“Sir,” cried R. L., “I am moved and inspired by your shin
ing example!”
“It was nothing,” said the stranger modestly, shaking his
frail white head. "It was just hard work, and hard work never
hurt anybody.”
“Would you mind telling me, sir,” said R. L., “how old you
are now?”
“Twenty-two,” said the stranger. ® isos stmiman

at five o’clock every morning to stoke the furnace at the SAK

husbandry. At seven I gave a fencing lesson to the Dean of
Women. At eight I had a class in early Runic poets. At nine I
gave haircuts at the Gamma Phi Beta house. At ten I had dif
ferential calculus. At eleven I posed for a life class. At twelve

R. L. Sigafoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when ho finished
high school ho wished mightily to go on with his education. It
seemed, however, a forlorn hope. R. L.’s father could not send
the boy to college because a series of crop failures had brought
him to the brink of disaster. (R. L.’s father raised orchids which,
in North Dakota, is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.)
It was, therefore, squarely up to R. L. Tie could go to college
only if he worked his way through. This was a prospect that
dismayed him. lie had a deep-seated fear that the task would
be too great, that he would never be able to carry on a full, busy
college life and still fir. ,1 time to do odd jobs and make money.
Racked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pondering
his dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he came upon a
park bench and sat down and lit a Marlboro cigarette. R. L.
always lit a Marlboro when he was low in his mind. R. L. also
always lit a Marlboro when he was merry. The fact is there is
no occasion—happy or sad, pensive or exuberant, cheery or
solemn —when Marlboro with its fine filter and fine flavor is
not entirely welcome, as you will discover when you go to your
favorite tobacconist and buy some, as we—the makers of
Marlboro and I and R. L. Sigafoos—hope you will do real soon.
Sitting and thinking and smoking a Marlboro on the park
bench, R. L. was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, “My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?”

Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with wispy,
snow-white hair. His skin was almost transparent, showing a
delicate tracery of fragile bones beneath. His back was bent,
and his hands trembled. But his eyes were bright and clear.
R. L. looked into those eyes, into the wrinkled face. He saw

R. L. Sigafoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when ho finished
high school ho wished mightily to go on with his education. It
seemed, however, a forlorn hope. R. L.’s father could not send
the boy to college because a series of crop failures had brought
him to the brink of disaster. (R. L.’s father raised orchids which,
in North Dakota, is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.)
It was, therefore, squarely up to R. L. Tie could go to college
only if he worked his way through. This was a prospect that
dismayed him. lie had a deep-seated fear that the task would
be too great, that he would never be able to carry on a full, busy
college life and still fir. ,1 time to do odd jobs and make money.
Racked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pondering
his dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he came upon a
park bench and sat down and lit a Marlboro cigarette. R. L.
always lit a Marlboro when he was low in his mind. R. L. also
always lit a Marlboro when he was merry. The fact is there is
no occasion—happy or sad, pensive or exuberant, cheery or
solemn —when Marlboro with its fine filter and fine flavor is
not entirely welcome, as you will discover when you go to your
favorite tobacconist and buy some, as we—the makers of
Marlboro and I and R. L. Sigafoos—hope you will do real soon.
Sitting and thinking and smoking a Marlboro on the park
bench, R. L. was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, “My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?”

Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with wispy,
snow-white hair. His skin was almost transparent, showing a
delicate tracery of fragile bones beneath. His back was bent,
and his hands trembled. But his eyes were bright and clear.
R. L. looked into those eyes, into the wrinkled face. He saw
wisdom there, and experience, and kindness. “Do you think,
sir, said 11. L., “that a boy can work his way through college
and still enjoy a rich, full campus life?”
“Why, bless you, son,” replied the stranger with a rheumy
chuckle, “of course you can. In fact, I did it myself.”
“Was it very hard?” asked R. L.
“Fes, it was hard,” the stranger admitted. “But when one
is young, all things are possible. I, for example, used to get up
at five o’clock every morning to stoke the furnace at the SAK
house. At six I had to milk the ewes at the school of animal
husbandry. At seven I gave a fencing lesson to the Dean of
Women. At eight I had a class in early Runic poets. At nine I
gave haircuts at the Gamma Phi Beta house. At ten I had dif
ferential calculus. At eleven I posed for a life class. At twelve
1 watered soup at the Union. At one I had a class in Oriental
languages. At two 1 exercised the mice in psych lab. At three
1 gave the Dean of Women another fencing lesson. At four I
had qualitative analysis. At five I went clamming. At six I cut
meat for the football team. At seven I ushed at the movies. At
eight I had my ears pierced so that at nine 1 could tell fortunes
in a gypsy tearoom. At ten I had a class in astronomy. At
eleven I tucked in the football team. At twelve I studied and
at three I went to sleep.”
“Sir,” cried R. L., “I am moved and inspired by your shin
ing example!”
“It was nothing,” said the stranger modestly, shaking his
frail white head. "It was just hard work, and hard work never
hurt anybody.”
“Would you mind telling me, sir,” said R. L., “how old you
are now?”
“Twenty-two,” said the stranger. ® isos stmiman
