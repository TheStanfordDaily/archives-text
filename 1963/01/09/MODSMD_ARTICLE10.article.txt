# Trustees Postpone Constitution OK
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees may not
act on the constitution, recently
passed by the student body, until
the end of winter quarter, ac
cording to a statement issued by
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler last night. The constitution
will not become effective until it
has been approved by the Board
of Trustees.

“The proposed new ASSU Con
stitution presupposes changes in
procedures of chartering student
groups . . . said Dean Winbig
ler. “Involved are some funda
mental questions of policy, in
cluding the legal obligations of
the University, under the Found
ing Grant . . . These questions
are now under study by the Pres
ident and the Board of Trustees

. . . it is expected that official
action on the constitution will be
taken . . . before the end of win
ter quarter.”
CONCERNING these develop
ments, ASSU President stated
that plans for electing the en
larged legislature provided for
in the new constitution would be
be implemented as soon as pos
sible, with the reservation that
the validity of the new legislature
would hinge upon the future de
cision of the Board of Trustees
regarding the constitution.

Said Rosencranz: “The new
constitution will afford the stu
dent body an outstanding oppor
tunity to speak out and take
stands on public issues affecting
the academic community.’’

In addition to the expansion of
legislature, LASSU, meeting to
night in room 267 of Tresidder,
will discuss the status of on cam
pus sectarian activities and the
right of undergraduates to evalu
ate the curriculum. Also, the ad
hoc Committee on Rushing will
give an interim report.

IT IS EXPECTED that LASSU
will reiterate their resolution of
last quarter, which stated, in
part, that;
• Fraternities, eating clubs,
unit houses of Stern, Wilbur,
Florence Moore and Lagunita,
Women’s Row Houses, Toyon In
dependents, Union, Branner, and
wings of Roble are to elect their
representatives to the now legis
lature as soon as possible in win
ter quarter.
• The present members of
Legislature will retain their seats
on the new Legislature as repre
sentatives of the student body at
large.
