# Tresidder Union Fills Role of Community Center
## 
### ROY SCHMIDT 
MDITOK’S NOTE: This is (he first of a
two-part series on the Stanford Union. To
morrow’s article will deal with the Union
organization, particularly the students’ role.

“The Stanford Union shall be a commu
nity center of the University ... It shall
provide a social, cultural, recreational, and
educational program.”
This statement, agreed upon by the Board
of Trustees in 1959, forms the basic operat
ing theory of Tresidder Memorial Union.
The goal of the Union goes far beyond
the usual “service station” concept which
merely calls for such facilities as barber
shop, soda fountain, travel agency, etc. Mem
bers of the Union Committee and Union
Board expect Tresidder to play an active
part in the educational process at Stanford
in addition to fulfilling the service role. In
the words of Dr. Chester Berry. Union Di
rector, “The union is working to combine
what people want to do in their spare time
with what they should be doing.”
THU STORY OF the development of the
present Union really goes back to 1915 when
Herbert Hoover returned from Harvard very
impressed with the value of the union on
that campus. His efforts resulted in the dedi
cation of the “Old Union” in 1922. But that
structure did not play a central role in uni
versity life. It was merely a building, with
no active organization working to achieve a
particular purpose.

A 1916 poll showed that a new union was
the most needed facility on campus. Two
years later, after the death of Donald Tre
sidder, it was decided that a new union
would be a fitting memorial to the Univer
sity’s fourth president. The next ten years
were spent largely drawing up blueprints
and throwing them away.
In 1959 Dr. Berry, a man who has spent
most of his adult life studying and working
with student unions, joined the Stanford
faculty. He organized an ad hoc committee of
over 200 interested students who worked
with faculty and administration in planning
for the present union. The committee con
ducted polls among the student body and
visited a number of student unions on the
coast.
THU FUNDS, totalling $2,385,000, includ
ing furnishings, came from a grant by Mrs.
Tresidder, contributions from friends of the
deceased president, and a federal loan.
Dr. Berry feels that Stanford is an ideal
university for a union as he envisions it.
It is residential and essentially rural, making
the students and faculty dependent on the
university community for leisure time ac
tivities. It is co-educational, a factor which
Berry believes has a unifying effect on the
student body. And finally, it has an intelli
gent student body capable of creating and
enjoying meaningful educational programs.
The Union has carried on its role of “in
formal education” primarily through pro

gramming during the first quarter of opera
tion. “Project da Vinci” is a particularly good
example of what can be achieved when all
facilities of the union are tied into one com
mon theme. That program included models
of his inventions, exhibits of his paintings,
recordings of his lute music available in the
listening rooms, books on his life in the
browsing room, as well as a number of lec
tures and a film.
THE SPECIAL PROJECTS division of
the Union is now 7 planning similar efforts
“Project Frank Lloyd Wright” and “Project
Shakespeare”—for next year.
The important point is that the really
I creative work—the developing and following
I through on ideas—is done by students. Pro
j fessional help is employed for the money
making functions of the Union; one does not
find students doing routine busy-work as in
other organizations on campus.
But as to the effect of the Union on cam
pus life in its first three months, w'ho can
really say? Dr. Berry maintains that one
really cannot measure the total effect of a
union on any campus.
“BUT YOU DO SEE people looking at our
■ art shows who have never been to a gal-
I lery,” he adds, “You often sec a person with
a bag-lunch eating on our patios with some
one who has a tray from the cafeteria. Our
collection of art prints were very much in
demand. These are all little things, but they
are things that just didn’t happen before.”
