# Military Junta's Arrests Ominous for Peru
## 
### 
The flood of arrests hy the Peruvian military junta in its purge
of alleged Communists is discouraging news for the democrats of
that nation who have been promised an election this July 9. The
news is disturbing because reports indicate that the junta’s net
has swept many non-Commnnist leftists into prison. In addition,
the junta has suspended constitutional guarantees in the name of
suppressing a Red revolution which the junta forecast for the
days from January 15 to 20. All told, those arrested now number
SOO, and they include the head of the Bank Employees Union and
the head of the Commercial Employees Union. If the pessimistic
view is correct, the junta may follow up its purge of Communists
and government opponents by postponing and ultimately pro
hibiting the promised elections.

On October 25 of this past year Richard Offut wrote in The
Daily that “In the past six years more than 100 peasants have
been shot and killed and scores injured by the police. Their only
crime was a ‘protest occupation’ of some remote corner of a
hacienda—a protest against inhuman treatment. The administra
tive agencies concerned defended their brutality by shouting
‘Communist inspiration.’ This is beginning to sound paranoic.
Even if the charge were true, the alleged Communists would have
been acting more humanely than those allegedly democratic
politicians with whom the Alliance for Progress works.”
The junta’s latest cry of wolf sounds paranoic also. Military
juntas traditionally are given to seeing Communist insurrections
where there are none, and in the process of suppressing these
insurrections, juntas are wont to neglect discriminating between
Communists and splinter left groups.
In financial appropriations, too, the junta’s paranoia is evident.
Since seizing power last June, the junta has increased the army
budget by 410 million soles, but the expenditures for education
and health have increased by only 219 million soles (20.8 soles
to the dollar). Ihe army s increased budget is designed for sup
pressing dissenters on the left not for defending the nation against
external aggression.
On Sunday the junta professed that it would not abandon its
“first obligation to hold the fairest possible elections July 9” and
to allow the election winners to take office. Since the Communist
party is now outlawed in Peru, that party cannot win the election.
Nevertheless, there is good reason to fear that if the junta does
not actually prohibit the election, it might well refuse to relin
quish power to a victorious party of the far left. By rounding up
and jailing moderates and non-Communist leftists, the junta is
showing its hand early. It can be anticipated the junta will not
permit elections that would bring to power land reformers and
proponents of social justice.
