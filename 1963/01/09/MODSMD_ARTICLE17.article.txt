In his recent book “Peasant
Nationalism and Communist
Power,” Mr. Johnson’s purpose,
apart from illuminating a rela
tively obscure period of Chinese
and Yugoslav history is to show
how the Communist Parties in
the two countries came to power
through the role they played in
the resistance movement against
the Japanese and the Germans.
The crucial decision, he believes,
was the modification of existing
Marxist policy through the adop
tion of nationalist objectives and
the utilization of the ‘national
myth.’

THE FIRST five chapters of
the book deal, in some detail,
with the rise to power of the Chi
nese Communist Party (CCP)
from the Japanese invasion in
1937. With commendable lucidity,
the author draws upon hitherto
unused Japanese archives and ex
plains why it was that the CCP,
using essentially the same organ
izational methods throughout,
captured during the war years,
(he popular suport which had
eluded it previously, Mao Tse
lung claimed that the party held
sway over nine million people in
1934; by 1945 he was claiming
some 200 millions. This spectacu
lar progress, Mr. Johnson be
lieves. is attributable to the cate
ciysmic physical and pschyologi
cal impact of the Japanese in
vasion on the Chinese peasantry.
The invasion was conducted
with a brutality which made it
impossible for the people to com
promise with the insurgents. At
the same time the traditional loci
of authority were being dissolved.

Some 100 million people, living
for the most part North of the
Yangtse River, reacted in an un
precedented fashion by resisting
Ihe foreigners. The classical po
sition of a peasantry riven from
their ancient pattern of life and
mobilized for the beginning of
a national movement was reach
ed. The CCP provided the means
by which the second stage of
Deutsch’s breakdown of the
stages of peasant mobilization
was achieved. By emerging as the
main group opposing the Japa
nese, the Communists, byway of
the communes and the intensive
indoctrination sessions, which are
so much a feature of Chinese
Communism, formed the peas
antry into new patterns of group
membership and loyalty.
THE LESSON is clear. The eco
nomic appeal of communism was
in itself insufficient to draw mass
popular support to the party;
thus its lack of success before
1937. But by capitalizing on popu
lar antagonism towards the for
eigner and by identifying itself
with the resistance movement
and the call to patriotic duty,
The Party was by 1945 able to
achieve political ascendancy,
based for the most part on the
support of rural China.
Mr. Johnson’s treatment of
Yugoslavia is less complete, and
here it seems that he might have
done better to write either a case
study of China or a comparative
study. Nevertheless, the main
points emerge clearly enough.
There was a great similarity
between the war-time experiences
of the two countries. In each case
the initial dislocation was caused
by a foreign invasion; in each
case the Communist Party took
measures to establish itself as
the leading resistance group and,
largely as a result, emerged

from Ihe war as the leading po
litical power. Communist control
developed from a hard core of
trained Marxists but not through
the classic appeal of International
communism but rather through
the nationalistic and patriotic
connotations which it adopted.
The last chapter of the book is
probably the most interesting, at
least for the non-specialist. In
this the link between comma |
nism and nationalism is explored i
and its significance for the de j
velopment of the countries in {
question is delineated.
THE BOOK is valuable as a
contribution to an understanding!
of present day relations with the :
so-called communist ‘bloc.’ Mr.
Johnson chooses to explain the I
divergences of policy between
China, Yugoslavia and Russia in
terms of their war experience and
the way in which they came to
power. Communism gained as
cendancy in these two countries
without any significant aid from
Russia and because of the appeal
to national interests the commu
nism resulting was a different
brand from the Russian variety.

Mao and Tito owe their allegi
ance more to the people of their
countries than to any Marxist
master-plan or the Soviet govern
ment. This has meant, and still
means, that they cannot be tools
of Soviet policy and this goes a
long way towards explaining dif
ference in the foreign policies of
the countries. It shows why Khru
shchev does not support Chinese
nationalistic ambitions in India
and why China can openly criti
cize Russian flirtations with
‘petty-bourgeoisie’ leaders such
as Nasser and Nehru and above
all it explains Tito’s own peculiar
type of communism.
THERE IS no doubt that much
of communist policy can be illu
minated in terms of war time ex
perience and by pointing up this
link Mr. Johnson performs a val
uable service.
