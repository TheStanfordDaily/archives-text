## Can Democracy Be Made Fit For Tempo of Modern Age? 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The coming controversy about the rules of the two Houses of
Congress is our own version of a problem which is troubling all
the big democracies. How can democratic government, which was
conceived and established in a very different era from this one, be
made fit for the crises and the tempo and the complexities of the

modern age? No big country has'
yet shown how to produce a satis
factory government when there
is liberty to dissent and agitate,
where there is a massive elector
ate and the territory is big enough
to comprise conflicting sectional
and occupational interests.
The good government which we
are looking for is one which is
stable though it can be voted out
of office, that is strong enough to
act decisively in international af
fairs and strong enough to resist
the hysteria of the crowd, that
has enough authority to impose
the national interest upon the con
flict of special interests.
Whether this is a Utopian dream
or a description of the bare mini
mum that is needed for the sur
vival of a good society, the fact
is that in the big democracies
of Western Europe, in Britain,
France, Germany, and Italy, and
in the United States and Canada
in North America, there is a wide
concern that the governments they
have been electing are inadequate
to their needs.
This has been the feeling which
brought about Gen. de Gaulle’s
return to power and approves of
or at least consents to his revolu
tionary assault on representative
parliamentary government. We
cannot as yet see where Gaiiilism
will end. lint ideologically, it is
for freedom and against democ
racy. It is for personal liberty
under authoritarian rule. While
if is preserving the liberties which
were generated in Europe in the
eighteenth and earlier centuries,
it is hostile to and s c or n f u 1
of nineteenth century democracy
with its massive electorates, its
parties, and its parliaments.
Gaullism is a radical movement
which is being watched with awe
and anxiety in the rest of West
ern Europe, particularly in the
German Federal Republic and in
Italy. In West Germany the com
ing departure of Dr. Adenauer,
that unique authoritarian patri
arch who is also anti-Prussian and
anti-Nazi, raises for the first time
since the Second World War the
question of how democratic Ger
many can organize an adequate
government. It cannot be forgot
ten that the Germans after the
First World War were unable to
do that.
In Italy today there is being
carried on a trial run of the only
visible alternative to a Gaullist
Europe. It consists of an alliance
between Democratic Socialist s and
Christian Democrats. To make the
alliance work the Socialists have
to get free of the totalitarians,
that is the Communists, on their
I e ft; the Christian Democrats
have to get free of the reactionary
and Fascist remnants on their
right. If (lie alliance can be con

solidatcd, which will Im* tested in
ilu* coming elections this spring,
there will Im* a solid majority for
a democratic progressive govern
ment. This is intended to be the
alternative to Gaullism.

It is interesting and important
to note that in West Germany
there is a growing tendency to
unite on the same formula which
is now on trial in Italy. It is
called in Germany the Grand Co
alition—the coalition of the two
largest parties, the Christian
Democrats and the Social Demo
crats. Such a government would
be the successor of the Christian
Democratic governments of Dr.
Adenauer’s heyday and of his un
stable combinations with the
smaller parties which have been
used since his power began to
decline.

The Grand Coalition cannot be
put together under Dr. Adenauer
because the partisan memories
are too bitter. It is being held in
reserve for his departure by the
leaders both of the Christian
Democrats and of the Social Dem
ocrats. That departure may in
fact como sooner than the official
date which is Oct. 1.

Considering the difficulty of
modern government, considering
that the alternative is some kind
of strong man rule, these* coali
tion experiments will no doubt
have to be made. Though we
have reason to watch them with
sympathy, we cannot forget that
as long as the coalitions hold
together, there will be no two
party system, there will be no
competent democratic opposition
which could lake over the gov
ernment. The bipartisan coali
tion governments must succeed,
for there is no orderly alterna
tive to them.

It should however be noted
lhat in this respect Italy and
Germany will be no worse off
than France, where there is not
now any orderly alternative to
Gen. de Gaulle.

The American version of the
problem arises, as I see it, out of
the fact that the American form
of government cannot be operat
ed at all in wartime and cannot
be operated successfully in peace
time except under Presidential
leadership. In domestic affairs,
which include such external af
fairs as tariffs, foreign aid, and
the character of the defense
structure, Presidential leadership
is checked and balanced and is
often vetoed and frustrated by
the rules of Congress, including
particularly the rule of seniority
and the entrenched power of the
standing committees.
