# Tribe Edges Bears 70-68
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
It took two overtimes and an
anxious 50 minutes of basketball
to do it, but Stanford won its
first AAWU league game of the
season last night, beating Cali
fornia 70-68 in a double overtime
bame at Berkeley.
With the score 55-55 a beauti
fully coached Bear squad held the
ball for a minute and fifty six
seconds at the end of the regula
tion period, trying to set up the
game winning shot; they couldn’t
do it, as Don Clemetson broke
up a pass.
WITH THE SCORE 59-59 at
the end of the first overtime,
Stanford tried the same thing;
they couldn’t do it either as Tom
Dose missed a 12-footer.
But in the wild second over
time finale, Clemetson sank 2
free throws with 2:34 gone, and
Stanford was never headed there
after.
It wasn’t that easy, however.
Cal’s 6'9” 225-pound center, Cam
den Wall, twice had a chance to
tie it on three-point plays but
missed both free throws. Clayton
Raaka’s free throw at 0:14 pro
duced the winning margin but
Wall still had time left to miss a
four-footer. As It was, however,
Wall scored 3 baskets and 2 char
ities in the overtime and led all
scorers with 22 points, and his
rebounding together with the rest
of his towering teammates nearly
toppled Stanford in the second
half after the Tribe had won the
first 20 minutes 33-27.
IT DIDN’T TAKE the Indians
long to show that they weren’t
the same team that finished a
miserable 7th in the LA Classic 2

weeks ago. Hustling like a group
of Stanford men at a San Jose
Slate mixer and provoked by the
pre-game jibes of the Cal rooting
section, the Indians moved to
early leads of 9-4 and 17-7, with
stood a Cal surge that nearly tied
it, and opened a 6-point lead at
half time.

In the second half, Cal’s gruel
ing rebounding began to pay off.
Continually getting second and
third shots, tney trailed by from
3 to 1 points for 7 minutes; in all
the Bears attempted 71 field goals
to 59 for Stanford. Dick Smith’s
field goal put Cal ahead 51-50 for
the first time with 4 minutes re
maining. Four baskets were then
traded in the remaining regula
tion time.

If there was a hero for Stan
ford it must be Lew Shupe. The
5’9” substitute guard virtually
led Stanford to the win in the
second half and overtime periods.
He scored 16 points in all, sinking
6 of 7 field goals and 4-4 from the
free throw line.

TOM DOSE was Stanford’s
leading scorer, however, with 19
points. Four of these came of
clutch free throws in the over
times.

Clcmetson’s performance was
invaluable. He scored 13 points,
but more important, he held Cal’s
Dick Smith to eight field goals in
20 attempts.
