## 
### PETE KING MARSHALL COOK 
The California frosh turned
Stanford’s mistakes into points
for a 61-50 win last night in Cal’s
gym. The loss was the first for
Stanford, following two straight
victories over St. Mary’s frosh
and San Jose City College. Cali
fornia’s record is now 4-3.

The Tribe took an early 9-
point lead on the strength of Bob
Bedell’s 14 points, then blew it
with 7 ball control errors. By half
time their lead had dwindled to
a single point.
Early in the second half Cal
grabbed the lead on a driving
layup by guard Robey Olson. The
Bears were never headed after
this shot, pulling away to a 49-40
lead that Stanford could not over
come. During this spurt Cal was
led by their big center Vortmann
and forward Myron Erickson,
who worked in close for easy
shots.

Cal kept the game out of Stan

ford’s leach in the late going by
employing an effective fast
break.

One bright note for Stanford
was the playing of Bedell, who
led all scorers in the game with
27 points. Erickson sparked Cal
with 15 points, and three other
Bears scored in double figures.

The Indians beat themselves in
the contest. They consistently
took bad shots and committed 14
ball control errors. The rebound
ing was poor, especially under
Cal’s basket.

Stanford should be helped
greatly by the return to action of
high school All-American Ray Ko
sanke. Kosanke has recovered
from a knee operation which kept,
him sidelined in Stanford’s first
two games, but he came down
with the flu and was forced to
miss the Cal encounter.
Coach Turner’s frosh will be
weakened by the loss of forward
Mark Leap. Leap has been the
sixth man for Stanford, providing
fine shooting from the corner and
timely rebounding. He is ineli
gible due to scholastic difficulties.
