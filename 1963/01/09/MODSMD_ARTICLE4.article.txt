### 
The University of California
has become the first public insti
tution in California to establish
an overseas study program, fol
lowing the examples of Stan
ford and Whittier. The campus,
in Bordeaux. France, was dedi
cated in November.

The Cal program differs from
the Stanford foreign study pro
gram in that it is directed to
wards the language major and is
not designed to be an enrichment
of the basic liberal arts education
in which all students can partici
pate.

Students arc chosen from the
various campuses of the univer
sity, Most of those selected are
juniors, but a limited number of
seniors are also accepted.
