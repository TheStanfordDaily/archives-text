ELISABPITHVILLE. Katanga, The Congo A solemn and sad
eyed Katanga President Moise Tshombe gave up yesterday and came
to Elisabethville to talk peace. Pie was promptly snubbed by United
Nations Under Secretary Ralph Bunche. It appeared that Tshombe
had waited too late to save his tottering regime although his gen
darmerie was reported to have put teeth in his threats of a scorched
earth policy by mining the dams and power stations he still controls
at Kolwezi.
Bunche advanced his departure several hours to avoid the em
barrassment of telling Tshombe he did not want to see him. Bunche
was backed by Secretary General Thant who put Tshombe on notice
(he U.N. would have no dealings with him unless he proclaims his
allegiance to the central Congolese government.
