INDIANS
Possibly, over the re
cent Holidays, you
might have a memory
slip on S/C—the won
drous deal promul
gated by Roos Atkins
which enables you to
buy what you want,
when you want it, and
take eons to pay. Now
is an excellent time to
take advantage of
same. Like for a new
stock of Mr. White
shirts, on sale, just
3.99 ea. or three for
11.75, french cuff
broadcloth or button
down oxford.
Need some?
