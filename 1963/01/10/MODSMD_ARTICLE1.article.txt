the Founding Grant. Various al
ternatives to the present ban on
sectarian activity were discussed,
most of which involved allowing
broader meanings to clauses al
lowing forms of sectarian activi
ty, or giving narrower meanings
to clauses restricting sectarian
activity.
In addition, LASSU considered
the role of students in contribut
ing to the formation of the Uni
versity decisions on matters of
curriculum. Said ASSU President
Armin Rosencranz, “We have a
stake in making this University
greater than it is today. . . . We
are Just as much concerned with
the well-being of this University
as the administration.”
