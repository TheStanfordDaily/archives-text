nifa, Women’s Row houses, To
yon Independents, Union, wings
of Roble, and Branner are to

possible, with the exception that
the graduate schools of Business,
Law, Medicine, and Education
may defer their elections until
the regular elections of their par
ticular school.
• Although new representa
tives may come to LASSU meet
ings as soon as elected, the new
legislature will not convene until
January 31, and this with the un
derstanding that its validity will
depend on the decision of Presi
dent Sterling and the Board of
Trustees regarding the new con
stitution.

• On January 31, the present
members of Legislature will be
come at large members of the
new legislature.
For moie detailed procedures,
students should consult their
present LASSU representatives.
In other business, Legislature
discussed the possibility of hav
ing some degree of sectarian ac
tivity on campus, consistent with
the Founding Grant. Various al
ternatives to the present ban on
sectarian activity were discussed,
most of which involved allowing
broader meanings to clauses al
lowing forms of sectarian activi
ty, or giving narrower meanings
to clauses restricting sectarian
activity.
In addition, LASSU considered
the role of students in contribut
ing to the formation of the Uni
versity decisions on matters of
curriculum. Said ASSU President
Armin Rosencranz, “We have a
stake in making this University
greater than it is today. . . . We
are Just as much concerned with
the well-being of this University
as the administration.”
