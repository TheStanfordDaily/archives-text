Many women students at Stan
ford are concerned about what
their field of major studies will
prepare them to do after gradu

a rewarding field that offers a
chance to be of service to others
and to grow in understanding
many kinds of people. Nurses are
in great demand and can find
many working opportunities.
The nursing program at Stan
ford takes five years of college:
two years of general studies and
three with the major emphasis
on nursing. Graduates receive a
B.S. degree, and are eligible to
take a licensing examination for
an R.N.

obstetrics, public health nursing,
advanced clinical nursing, and
psychiatric nursing. Medical-sur

obstetrics, students assist in de

to care for their babies. During
the public health nursing of the
fifth year, students spend much
time out in the community teach

nursing prerequisites can apply
to the Stanford School of Nurs

years of college. Some members
of each class have had three or
four years of college.

little girl? Chances are she'd like to be a nurse, too. After all, it beats saying "ah."
