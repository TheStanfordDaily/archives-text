Editor, The Daily:
It is heartening that a keen in
terest is being taken in the For
eign Student programmes and
that student representatives have
been appointed to the Foreign
visitors and students committee.
This is a committee, described in
the January 7 Daily, which will
administer a two and one-half
million dollar grant from the
Ford Foundation. The purpose of
the grant is to aid in foreign stu
dent work. This has been an oft
felt need on the part of the For
eign Students, and we congratu
late the new members of the
committee.

At Stanford we have a very
fine foreign student body whose
potential, we believe, has never
been adequately tapped. The In
ternational Club is an excellent
organization which has done a
lot to bring together the foreign
students and the students of the
host country. It has a member
ship of about a thousand students
which includes almost all the
foreign students of the Univer
sity and many Americans interest
ed in international brotherhood
and friendship. We feel that the
foreign visitors and student com
mittee would be able to serve its
purpose more fruitfully if it in
cluded an International Club rep
resentative s :ch as the President
of the International Club. This
would give an opportunity to
avail of the ability and enthusi
asm of the foreign student body.
Such a representative would be
of great help to the committee
since he would bring an under
standing of the needs of the for
eign students to the committee.
Such knowledge, we feel, is in
dispensable for the future suc
cess of the committee.

It was with considerable regret
that we learned of the appoint
ment of two HR vice-presidents

to fill the only student chairs of
the Foreign Visitors and Students
Committee. Certainly, one of the
student delegates to this organi
zation should be drawn from the
upper echelons of the HR, but-the
logic of appointing two to the ex
clusion of a representative of the
executive committee of the Inter
national Club wholly escapes us.

If it is indeed true, as the ar
ticle in yesterday’s Daily implies,
that the Ford grant of two and
one-half million dollars for for
eign student programs is to be
administered largely through this
committee, we find it hard to be
lieve that the Administration
does not recognize the advisabili
ty of consulting directly with for
eign students through their own
organization.

The high regard in which the
Administration holds the UR and
the large voice it has accorded
this undergraduate body has ap
parently gone to the heads of
some of its executive officers. An
organizational chart drawn up
for internal distribution within
the HR and alluded to in a Daily
article of last fall has the Inter
national Club lumped with the
Host Committee, the Foreign
Student Pre-Reg, and the Foreign
Student Eating Program under
the “direction” of an HR vice
president. Affronts of this sort
and the matter of representation
on Prof. Spaeth’s committee do
nothing to improve the already
tenuous relations between the In
stitute of International Relations
and the foreign students’ organi
zation.

It is to be hoped that in the
future it will behoove the Admin
istration and the HR to treat the
nine hundred members of the I
Club and their elected representa
tive as somewhat more than Mr.
Gordon Adams’ charges. It is
hard to see how an effective for
eign student program can be or
ganized in any other way.

It was with considerable regret
that we learned of the appoint
ment of two HR vice-presidents

to fill the only student chairs of
the Foreign Visitors and Students
Committee. Certainly, one of the
student delegates to this organi
zation should be drawn from the
upper echelons of the HR, but-the
logic of appointing two to the ex
clusion of a representative of the
executive committee of the Inter
national Club wholly escapes us.

If it is indeed true, as the ar
ticle in yesterday’s Daily implies,
that the Ford grant of two and
one-half million dollars for for
eign student programs is to be
administered largely through this
committee, we find it hard to be
lieve that the Administration
does not recognize the advisabili
ty of consulting directly with for
eign students through their own
organization.

The high regard in which the
Administration holds the UR and
the large voice it has accorded
this undergraduate body has ap
parently gone to the heads of
some of its executive officers. An
organizational chart drawn up
for internal distribution within
the HR and alluded to in a Daily
article of last fall has the Inter
national Club lumped with the
Host Committee, the Foreign
Student Pre-Reg, and the Foreign
Student Eating Program under
the “direction” of an HR vice
president. Affronts of this sort
and the matter of representation
on Prof. Spaeth’s committee do
nothing to improve the already
tenuous relations between the In
stitute of International Relations
and the foreign students’ organi
zation.

It is to be hoped that in the
future it will behoove the Admin
istration and the HR to treat the
nine hundred members of the I
Club and their elected representa
tive as somewhat more than Mr.
Gordon Adams’ charges. It is
hard to see how an effective for
eign student program can be or
ganized in any other way.

It is heartening that a keen in
terest is being taken in the For
eign Student programmes and
that student representatives have
been appointed to the Foreign
visitors and students committee.
This is a committee, described in
the January 7 Daily, which will
administer a two and one-half
million dollar grant from the
Ford Foundation. The purpose of
the grant is to aid in foreign stu
dent work. This has been an oft
felt need on the part of the For
eign Students, and we congratu
late the new members of the
committee.

At Stanford we have a very
fine foreign student body whose
potential, we believe, has never
been adequately tapped. The In
ternational Club is an excellent
organization which has done a
lot to bring together the foreign
students and the students of the
host country. It has a member
ship of about a thousand students
which includes almost all the
foreign students of the Univer
sity and many Americans interest
ed in international brotherhood
and friendship. We feel that the
foreign visitors and student com
mittee would be able to serve its
purpose more fruitfully if it in
cluded an International Club rep
resentative s :ch as the President
of the International Club. This
would give an opportunity to
avail of the ability and enthusi
asm of the foreign student body.
Such a representative would be
of great help to the committee
since he would bring an under
standing of the needs of the for
eign students to the committee.
Such knowledge, we feel, is in
dispensable for the future suc
cess of the committee.

and the foreign students’ organi

tive as somewhat more than Mr.
Gordon Adams’ charges. It is
hard to see how an effective for
eign student program can be or
ganized in any other way.
