## Nassau Encourages Europe To Give up Nuclear Illusion 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The Pact of Nassau makes two main points. One is that no
European nation can afford to build an independent nuclear force.
The second point is that, nevertheless, the art of making nuclear
weapons, the know-how and the facilities, should be maintained
and not allowed to die out in Britain and in France.

As this is written we know
that Great Britain grudgingly will
accept the agreement, and it seems
unlikely that France will ever ac

■ cept it. For it is
I !rue that the pact
I is a formal rati-
I fication of the
I American conten-
I tion, which is
I that the com-
I mancl of the nu-
I clear forces of
I the Alliance can-
I not be divided.
[ What is more, in

view of the overwhelming Ameri
can preponderance, there can in
fact be no such thing as truly in
dependendent national forces or,
though this is somewhat fudged
in the telling, a European NATO
force which is independent of the
United States.
THE AMERICAN preponder
ance may be good or bad. But it
is a fact which cannot in the fore
seeable future be changed very
much. Taking the figures which
Mr. Dean Acheson uses in the cur
rent Foreign Affairs, the United
States will this year spend on nu
clear weapons alone as much ($l5
billion» as all the European NATO
countries combined are spending
on all their defenses.
The British who have worked
hard and have spent a good deal
of money have achieved a nuclear
capacity which may be about 2
per cent of the American. Their
nuclear power, which is carried
by manned bombers, is or will
very soon be incapable of pene
trating the Soviet air defenses.
France, which is not so advanc
ed as Britain may in a few years
succeed in making herself the
nuclear equal of Britain today if
all goes well, France will have
another 2 per cent of the Ameri
can capacity. But in a very few
years the French force which con
sists of manned bombers will he
obsolete.
IT IS misleading to talk of such
small forces as independent. Even
a European NATO force drawing
on all the wealth and resources of
Europe would in a good many
years possibly reach 10 per cent
of the American force today. Is
it conceivable that such a force
could independently make a nu
clear strike against the Soviet

Union without the full coopera
tion of the American 90 per cent?
The initiative in and the veto on
the use of nuclear weapons is un
avoidable and necessary, given the
facts a$ they are.
The hard facts of the situation
sound unpleasant, particularly
when an American stresses them.
It would be better if on both sides
of the Atlantic we could come to
treat the hard facts not as the
end of the story but as the begin
ning. Within the terms of the
Pact of Nassau it will lie quite
feasible to develop an intimate
partnership in science, technology,
expertise, production facilities,
training, planning, targeting strat
egy, and the formulation of mili
tary doctrine. Apparently, because
both Britain and France are al
ready nuclear powers, this part
nership would not require an
amendment of the Atomic Energy
Act.
LOOKED at this way, which is
I believe the way the Pact is
meant to be looked at, Britain and
France would be giving up noth
ing more than an illusion, that in
the Western Alliance a very small
nuclear force could in fact be in
dependent of the preponderant nu
clear force. In place of the illu
sion of independence they would
gain a close partnership in the
development and the planning of
the preponderant force of the Alli
ance.
On reflection, this may not be
so unattractive to our European
allies. They would be trading in
dependent forces which do not
now exist for participation in
the planning and development of
forces which in fact do exist.

THE AMERICAN preponder
ance may be good or bad. But it
is a fact which cannot in the fore
seeable future be changed very

Mr. Dean Acheson uses in the cur

States will this year spend on nu
clear weapons alone as much ($l5
billion» as all the European NATO
countries combined are spending
on all their defenses.
The British who have worked
hard and have spent a good deal
of money have achieved a nuclear
capacity which may be about 2
per cent of the American. Their
nuclear power, which is carried
by manned bombers, is or will
very soon be incapable of pene
trating the Soviet air defenses.
France, which is not so advanc
ed as Britain may in a few years
succeed in making herself the
nuclear equal of Britain today if

another 2 per cent of the Ameri
can capacity. But in a very few
years the French force which con
sists of manned bombers will he
obsolete.
IT IS misleading to talk of such
small forces as independent. Even
a European NATO force drawing
on all the wealth and resources of
Europe would in a good many
years possibly reach 10 per cent
of the American force today. Is
it conceivable that such a force
could independently make a nu
clear strike against the Soviet

Union without the full coopera
tion of the American 90 per cent?
The initiative in and the veto on
the use of nuclear weapons is un
avoidable and necessary, given the
facts a$ they are.
The hard facts of the situation
sound unpleasant, particularly
when an American stresses them.
It would be better if on both sides
of the Atlantic we could come to
treat the hard facts not as the
end of the story but as the begin
ning. Within the terms of the
Pact of Nassau it will lie quite
feasible to develop an intimate
partnership in science, technology,
expertise, production facilities,
training, planning, targeting strat
egy, and the formulation of mili
tary doctrine. Apparently, because
both Britain and France are al
ready nuclear powers, this part
nership would not require an
amendment of the Atomic Energy
Act.
LOOKED at this way, which is
I believe the way the Pact is
meant to be looked at, Britain and
France would be giving up noth
ing more than an illusion, that in
the Western Alliance a very small
nuclear force could in fact be in
dependent of the preponderant nu
clear force. In place of the illu
sion of independence they would
gain a close partnership in the
development and the planning of
the preponderant force of the Alli
ance.
On reflection, this may not be
so unattractive to our European
allies. They would be trading in
dependent forces which do not
now exist for participation in
the planning and development of

The Pact of Nassau makes two main points. One is that no
European nation can afford to build an independent nuclear force.
The second point is that, nevertheless, the art of making nuclear
weapons, the know-how and the facilities, should be maintained
and not allowed to die out in Britain and in France.

force which is independent of the
United States.
THE AMERICAN preponder
ance may be good or bad. But it
is a fact which cannot in the fore
seeable future be changed very
much. Taking the figures which
Mr. Dean Acheson uses in the cur
rent Foreign Affairs, the United
States will this year spend on nu
clear weapons alone as much ($l5
billion» as all the European NATO
countries combined are spending
on all their defenses.
The British who have worked
hard and have spent a good deal
of money have achieved a nuclear
capacity which may be about 2
per cent of the American. Their
nuclear power, which is carried
by manned bombers, is or will
very soon be incapable of pene
trating the Soviet air defenses.
France, which is not so advanc
ed as Britain may in a few years
succeed in making herself the
nuclear equal of Britain today if
all goes well, France will have
another 2 per cent of the Ameri
can capacity. But in a very few
years the French force which con
sists of manned bombers will he
obsolete.
IT IS misleading to talk of such
small forces as independent. Even
a European NATO force drawing
on all the wealth and resources of
Europe would in a good many
years possibly reach 10 per cent
of the American force today. Is
it conceivable that such a force
could independently make a nu
clear strike against the Soviet

Union without the full coopera
tion of the American 90 per cent?
The initiative in and the veto on
the use of nuclear weapons is un
avoidable and necessary, given the
facts a$ they are.
The hard facts of the situation
sound unpleasant, particularly
when an American stresses them.
It would be better if on both sides
of the Atlantic we could come to
treat the hard facts not as the
end of the story but as the begin
ning. Within the terms of the
Pact of Nassau it will lie quite
feasible to develop an intimate
partnership in science, technology,
expertise, production facilities,
training, planning, targeting strat
egy, and the formulation of mili
tary doctrine. Apparently, because
both Britain and France are al
ready nuclear powers, this part
nership would not require an
amendment of the Atomic Energy
Act.
LOOKED at this way, which is
I believe the way the Pact is
meant to be looked at, Britain and
France would be giving up noth
ing more than an illusion, that in
the Western Alliance a very small
nuclear force could in fact be in
dependent of the preponderant nu
clear force. In place of the illu
sion of independence they would
gain a close partnership in the
development and the planning of
the preponderant force of the Alli
ance.
On reflection, this may not be
so unattractive to our European
allies. They would be trading in
dependent forces which do not
now exist for participation in
the planning and development of
forces which in fact do exist.
