# REACTIONS VARY
## Disillusion, Cynicism of Volunteers Contrary to Peace Corps Propaganda 
### 
(Editor’s Note: This is a letter
from Carol Langford, a Stanford
graduate now in Columbia. The
letter was received hy the Peace
Corps Desk of the Institute of
International Kelations.)
I have been meaning to write
my impressions for the Peace
Corps Desk at Stanford for some
time, but have been waiting in
hopes that I’d have something
more favorable to report. We are
at a very difficult stage right
now because we have been at our
sites only a few weeks and are
just beginning to get acquainted
with the people.
I am in a project which is doing
community development work in
the major cities of Columbia. We
are supposed to help stimulate in
terest and organize self-help pro
grams within depressed areas.
COLUMBIA has a terrible prob
lem of “la Violencia” in rural
areas. Practically every week you
read of some atrocity in which a
whole bus load of people have
been shot or some poor farmers
have been raided.

Although years ago it began as
a political struggle, now these
guerrilla attacks are mainly ban
dits and “antisociales.” Over the
last years an unbelievable num
ber of people have been killed;
more than all the American sol
diers killed in World War 11, This
has led to mass migrations of
peasants to the cities in a search
for security and augments the al
ready tremendous slum problem.

Cali, where I am stationed, is
one of the fastest growing cities
in the world. Our team of 3 PCV’s
(Peace Corps Volunteers) is
working in a district which de
veloped about 2 years ago on
land that was formerly pasture.
It is not the worst place possible
because at least the land is flat
and the climate of Cali is much
like Florida. (Some of my friends
are in Buenaventura, on the Pa
cific coast which has just ungodly
weather. (

OUR SLUM does have a new,
inadequate health center and
several programs for - improve
ments already underway, but
aside from the people and re
sources available, the physical
problems are tremendous.
The roads are so bad the city
won’t send trucks to pick up gar
bage, and to get to work in the
morning we either have to walk

a mile or so from the nearest bus,
or find a taxi driver who is un
familiar enough with the area to
be coaxed into taking us there.
There is a lovely sewage canal
which runs along the length of
the community with various little
tributaries, and the smell of the
whole place when the wind is
right can hardly be properly de
scribed.

THE BOY in our group is going
to get a house right in the middle
of our area, but the girls cannot
live there because it is such a
dangerous neighborhood and
there is no police protection.

We as PCV’s are somewhat
overwhelmed by the level of liv
ing and the lack of effort among
the people to do anything about
the condition of their houses.
There is a lot of talk and organi
zational plans, but suspicion and
rivalry dampen the few bright
spots there seem to be.
The first week we just went
around talking to people; they
were very nice to us and inter
ested in meeting Americans. We
were trying to discover just what
they felt they needed most and
their ideas for community cooper
ation.

What they really wanted us to
d« was give them lots of money.
Many Columbians think Feaee
Corps is part of the Alliance for
Progress and that we are here
with the money truck to dole
thing's out.
In our community a great many
families are now living off U.S.
surplus distributed by CARE.
Last night we had our first com
munity meeting and gave talks
in Spanish trying to explain our
role.

I may be unduly pessimistic
now, hut I wonder just how bene
ficial our project really is and if
we could ever make a dent in the
situation.

I have met many of the volun
ters from the first two Columbian
groups and was amazed at their
disillusionment and cynicism, es
pecially as contrasted to the glow
ing reports you usually hear
from P.C. propaganda.

I THINK it is the real altruist
and idealist who is hurt most.
One of the most capable and sen
sitive volunters was the first to
quit P.C. here and return to what
he felt was more valuable work
for him to dedicate himself to. I
have also met some PCV’s who

really love their work and have
been very successful.

One of the major complaints
against the PC has been the se
lection process and administra
tion. The volunteer I met who
had accomplished the most, Den
nis Grubb, had originally been
selected out and only gotten to
Columbia by going to Washing
ton, right to the top, to appeal his
case. It took him five months be
fore he got anything going, but
now, a year later, he has helped
his village build a school, two
roads, and is working on some 17
projects.
JUST BECAUSE I feel dis
heartened about what P.C. can
do about the real situation hero
does not mean I consider my ex
periences here so far as wasted.
For someone interested in get
ting to know another culture and
many kinds of people. I can’t
think of a belter way.
As a member of the P.C. prac
tically all doors are open to you
and you’re treated like an ambas
sador. Last Sunday some of us
went with the mayor and treasur
er of the city to a magnificent ha
cienda in the country where we
rode horses, swam in a lovely
pool and enjoyed a barbeque.
Monday 1 visited the impover
ished hovel of a forlorn old
woman. 1 felt sick to my stomach
just being inside that house
where three families lived with
out a stick of furniture. We had
been warned of “culture shock.”
When the half naked child she
was holding urinated on her lap
and she didn't even flinch, I knew
what the term meant.

in the world. Our team of 3 PCV’s
(Peace Corps Volunteers) is
working in a district which de
veloped about 2 years ago on
land that was formerly pasture.
It is not the worst place possible
because at least the land is flat
and the climate of Cali is much
like Florida. (Some of my friends
are in Buenaventura, on the Pa
cific coast which has just ungodly
weather. (

OUR SLUM does have a new,
inadequate health center and
several programs for - improve
ments already underway, but
aside from the people and re
sources available, the physical
problems are tremendous.
The roads are so bad the city
won’t send trucks to pick up gar
bage, and to get to work in the
morning we either have to walk

a mile or so from the nearest bus,
or find a taxi driver who is un
familiar enough with the area to
be coaxed into taking us there.
There is a lovely sewage canal
which runs along the length of
the community with various little
tributaries, and the smell of the
whole place when the wind is
right can hardly be properly de
scribed.

THE BOY in our group is going
to get a house right in the middle
of our area, but the girls cannot
live there because it is such a
dangerous neighborhood and
there is no police protection.

We as PCV’s are somewhat
overwhelmed by the level of liv
ing and the lack of effort among
the people to do anything about
the condition of their houses.
There is a lot of talk and organi
zational plans, but suspicion and
rivalry dampen the few bright
spots there seem to be.
The first week we just went
around talking to people; they
were very nice to us and inter
ested in meeting Americans. We
were trying to discover just what
they felt they needed most and
their ideas for community cooper
ation.

What they really wanted us to
d« was give them lots of money.
Many Columbians think Feaee
Corps is part of the Alliance for
Progress and that we are here
with the money truck to dole
thing's out.
In our community a great many
families are now living off U.S.
surplus distributed by CARE.
Last night we had our first com
munity meeting and gave talks
in Spanish trying to explain our
role.

I may be unduly pessimistic
now, hut I wonder just how bene
ficial our project really is and if
we could ever make a dent in the
situation.

I have met many of the volun
ters from the first two Columbian
groups and was amazed at their
disillusionment and cynicism, es
pecially as contrasted to the glow
ing reports you usually hear
from P.C. propaganda.

I THINK it is the real altruist
and idealist who is hurt most.
One of the most capable and sen
sitive volunters was the first to
quit P.C. here and return to what
he felt was more valuable work
for him to dedicate himself to. I
have also met some PCV’s who

really love their work and have
been very successful.

One of the major complaints
against the PC has been the se
lection process and administra
tion. The volunteer I met who
had accomplished the most, Den
nis Grubb, had originally been
selected out and only gotten to
Columbia by going to Washing
ton, right to the top, to appeal his
case. It took him five months be
fore he got anything going, but
now, a year later, he has helped
his village build a school, two
roads, and is working on some 17
projects.
JUST BECAUSE I feel dis
heartened about what P.C. can
do about the real situation hero
does not mean I consider my ex
periences here so far as wasted.
For someone interested in get
ting to know another culture and
many kinds of people. I can’t
think of a belter way.
As a member of the P.C. prac
tically all doors are open to you
and you’re treated like an ambas
sador. Last Sunday some of us
went with the mayor and treasur
er of the city to a magnificent ha
cienda in the country where we
rode horses, swam in a lovely
pool and enjoyed a barbeque.
Monday 1 visited the impover
ished hovel of a forlorn old
woman. 1 felt sick to my stomach
just being inside that house
where three families lived with
out a stick of furniture. We had
been warned of “culture shock.”
When the half naked child she
was holding urinated on her lap
and she didn't even flinch, I knew
what the term meant.

I have been meaning to write
my impressions for the Peace
Corps Desk at Stanford for some

hopes that I’d have something
more favorable to report. We are
at a very difficult stage right

I am in a project which is doing
community development work in
the major cities of Columbia. We
are supposed to help stimulate in

COLUMBIA has a terrible prob
lem of “la Violencia” in rural
areas. Practically every week you
read of some atrocity in which a
whole bus load of people have
been shot or some poor farmers
have been raided.

Although years ago it began as
a political struggle, now these
guerrilla attacks are mainly ban
dits and “antisociales.” Over the
last years an unbelievable num
ber of people have been killed;
more than all the American sol
diers killed in World War 11, This
has led to mass migrations of
peasants to the cities in a search
for security and augments the al

There is a lot of talk and organi
zational plans, but suspicion and
rivalry dampen the few bright
spots there seem to be.
The first week we just went
around talking to people; they
were very nice to us and inter
ested in meeting Americans. We
were trying to discover just what
they felt they needed most and
their ideas for community cooper
ation.

What they really wanted us to
d« was give them lots of money.
Many Columbians think Feaee
Corps is part of the Alliance for
Progress and that we are here
with the money truck to dole
thing's out.
In our community a great many
families are now living off U.S.
surplus distributed by CARE.
Last night we had our first com
munity meeting and gave talks
in Spanish trying to explain our
role.

I may be unduly pessimistic
now, hut I wonder just how bene
ficial our project really is and if
we could ever make a dent in the
situation.

I have met many of the volun
ters from the first two Columbian
groups and was amazed at their
disillusionment and cynicism, es
pecially as contrasted to the glow
ing reports you usually hear
from P.C. propaganda.

I THINK it is the real altruist
and idealist who is hurt most.
One of the most capable and sen
sitive volunters was the first to
quit P.C. here and return to what
he felt was more valuable work
for him to dedicate himself to. I
have also met some PCV’s who

really love their work and have
been very successful.

One of the major complaints
against the PC has been the se
lection process and administra
tion. The volunteer I met who
had accomplished the most, Den
nis Grubb, had originally been
selected out and only gotten to
Columbia by going to Washing
ton, right to the top, to appeal his
case. It took him five months be
fore he got anything going, but
now, a year later, he has helped
his village build a school, two
roads, and is working on some 17
projects.
JUST BECAUSE I feel dis
heartened about what P.C. can
do about the real situation hero
does not mean I consider my ex
periences here so far as wasted.
For someone interested in get
ting to know another culture and
many kinds of people. I can’t
think of a belter way.
As a member of the P.C. prac
tically all doors are open to you
and you’re treated like an ambas
sador. Last Sunday some of us
went with the mayor and treasur
er of the city to a magnificent ha
cienda in the country where we
rode horses, swam in a lovely
pool and enjoyed a barbeque.
Monday 1 visited the impover
ished hovel of a forlorn old
woman. 1 felt sick to my stomach
just being inside that house
where three families lived with
out a stick of furniture. We had
been warned of “culture shock.”
When the half naked child she
was holding urinated on her lap
and she didn't even flinch, I knew
what the term meant.

I have been meaning to write
my impressions for the Peace
Corps Desk at Stanford for some
time, but have been waiting in
hopes that I’d have something
more favorable to report. We are
at a very difficult stage right
now because we have been at our
sites only a few weeks and are
just beginning to get acquainted
with the people.
I am in a project which is doing
community development work in
the major cities of Columbia. We
are supposed to help stimulate in
terest and organize self-help pro
grams within depressed areas.
COLUMBIA has a terrible prob
lem of “la Violencia” in rural
areas. Practically every week you
read of some atrocity in which a
whole bus load of people have
been shot or some poor farmers
have been raided.

Although years ago it began as
a political struggle, now these
guerrilla attacks are mainly ban
dits and “antisociales.” Over the
last years an unbelievable num
ber of people have been killed;
more than all the American sol
diers killed in World War 11, This
has led to mass migrations of
peasants to the cities in a search
for security and augments the al
ready tremendous slum problem.

Cali, where I am stationed, is
one of the fastest growing cities
in the world. Our team of 3 PCV’s
(Peace Corps Volunteers) is
working in a district which de
veloped about 2 years ago on
land that was formerly pasture.
It is not the worst place possible
because at least the land is flat
and the climate of Cali is much
like Florida. (Some of my friends
are in Buenaventura, on the Pa
cific coast which has just ungodly
weather. (

OUR SLUM does have a new,
inadequate health center and
several programs for - improve
ments already underway, but
aside from the people and re
sources available, the physical
problems are tremendous.
The roads are so bad the city
won’t send trucks to pick up gar
bage, and to get to work in the
morning we either have to walk

a mile or so from the nearest bus,
or find a taxi driver who is un
familiar enough with the area to
be coaxed into taking us there.
There is a lovely sewage canal
which runs along the length of
the community with various little
tributaries, and the smell of the
whole place when the wind is
right can hardly be properly de
scribed.

THE BOY in our group is going
to get a house right in the middle
of our area, but the girls cannot
live there because it is such a
dangerous neighborhood and
there is no police protection.

We as PCV’s are somewhat
overwhelmed by the level of liv
ing and the lack of effort among
the people to do anything about
the condition of their houses.

really love their work and have
been very successful.

One of the major complaints
against the PC has been the se
lection process and administra
tion. The volunteer I met who
had accomplished the most, Den
nis Grubb, had originally been
selected out and only gotten to
Columbia by going to Washing
ton, right to the top, to appeal his
case. It took him five months be
fore he got anything going, but
now, a year later, he has helped
his village build a school, two
roads, and is working on some 17
projects.
JUST BECAUSE I feel dis
heartened about what P.C. can
do about the real situation hero
does not mean I consider my ex
periences here so far as wasted.
For someone interested in get
ting to know another culture and
many kinds of people. I can’t
think of a belter way.
As a member of the P.C. prac
tically all doors are open to you
and you’re treated like an ambas
sador. Last Sunday some of us
went with the mayor and treasur
er of the city to a magnificent ha
cienda in the country where we
rode horses, swam in a lovely
pool and enjoyed a barbeque.
Monday 1 visited the impover
ished hovel of a forlorn old
woman. 1 felt sick to my stomach
just being inside that house
where three families lived with
out a stick of furniture. We had
been warned of “culture shock.”
When the half naked child she
was holding urinated on her lap
and she didn't even flinch, I knew
what the term meant.
(Editor’s Note: This is a letter
from Carol Langford, a Stanford
graduate now in Columbia. The
letter was received hy the Peace
Corps Desk of the Institute of
International Kelations.)
I have been meaning to write
my impressions for the Peace
Corps Desk at Stanford for some
time, but have been waiting in
hopes that I’d have something
more favorable to report. We are
at a very difficult stage right
now because we have been at our
sites only a few weeks and are
just beginning to get acquainted
with the people.
I am in a project which is doing
community development work in
the major cities of Columbia. We
are supposed to help stimulate in
terest and organize self-help pro
grams within depressed areas.
COLUMBIA has a terrible prob
lem of “la Violencia” in rural
areas. Practically every week you
read of some atrocity in which a
whole bus load of people have
been shot or some poor farmers
have been raided.

Although years ago it began as
a political struggle, now these
guerrilla attacks are mainly ban
dits and “antisociales.” Over the
last years an unbelievable num
ber of people have been killed;
more than all the American sol
diers killed in World War 11, This
has led to mass migrations of
peasants to the cities in a search
for security and augments the al
ready tremendous slum problem.

Cali, where I am stationed, is
one of the fastest growing cities
in the world. Our team of 3 PCV’s
(Peace Corps Volunteers) is
working in a district which de
veloped about 2 years ago on
land that was formerly pasture.
It is not the worst place possible
because at least the land is flat
and the climate of Cali is much
like Florida. (Some of my friends
are in Buenaventura, on the Pa
cific coast which has just ungodly
weather. (

OUR SLUM does have a new,
inadequate health center and
several programs for - improve
ments already underway, but
aside from the people and re
sources available, the physical
problems are tremendous.
The roads are so bad the city
won’t send trucks to pick up gar
bage, and to get to work in the
morning we either have to walk

a mile or so from the nearest bus,
or find a taxi driver who is un
familiar enough with the area to
be coaxed into taking us there.
There is a lovely sewage canal
which runs along the length of
the community with various little
tributaries, and the smell of the
whole place when the wind is
right can hardly be properly de
scribed.

THE BOY in our group is going
to get a house right in the middle
of our area, but the girls cannot
live there because it is such a
dangerous neighborhood and
there is no police protection.

We as PCV’s are somewhat
overwhelmed by the level of liv
ing and the lack of effort among
the people to do anything about
the condition of their houses.
There is a lot of talk and organi
zational plans, but suspicion and
rivalry dampen the few bright
spots there seem to be.
The first week we just went
around talking to people; they
were very nice to us and inter
ested in meeting Americans. We
were trying to discover just what
they felt they needed most and
their ideas for community cooper
ation.

What they really wanted us to
d« was give them lots of money.
Many Columbians think Feaee
Corps is part of the Alliance for
Progress and that we are here
with the money truck to dole
thing's out.
In our community a great many
families are now living off U.S.
surplus distributed by CARE.
Last night we had our first com
munity meeting and gave talks
in Spanish trying to explain our
role.

I may be unduly pessimistic
now, hut I wonder just how bene
ficial our project really is and if
we could ever make a dent in the
situation.

I have met many of the volun
ters from the first two Columbian
groups and was amazed at their
disillusionment and cynicism, es
pecially as contrasted to the glow
ing reports you usually hear
from P.C. propaganda.

I THINK it is the real altruist
and idealist who is hurt most.
One of the most capable and sen
sitive volunters was the first to
quit P.C. here and return to what
he felt was more valuable work
for him to dedicate himself to. I
have also met some PCV’s who

really love their work and have
been very successful.
