# RECORD REVIEW
## Peter, Paul & Mary Rooted in Culture Of North Beach 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
Having left the quiet folk en
clave of San Francisco for the
turmoil of a nation-wide tour,
Peter. Paul and Mary are quickly
proving themselves just about
the best group going. Their latest
album, “Moving” (Warner Bros.
WS 1473), seems commemorative
of this extension.

In this age of increasing urban
ization, Peter, Paul and Mai'y
have achieved something of the
ethnic singer’s involvement in the
total life of a small folk commu
nity. They have thoroughly
grounded themselves in the Holy
Barbarian culture of San Fran
cisco’s North Beach, numbering
among their active enthusiasts
several well-known poets of the
Beat Generation. They seem to
have carried into the wide world
of mid-century America the bo
hemian’s obligation to achieve
above all else an effective aesthet
ic experience.

The keynote of this second al
bum is sophisticated understate
ment. The old “If I Had a Ham
mer” enthusiasm survives in “Big
Boat” and “Morning Train”; but
for the most part it has been re
placed by a versatile manipula
tion of various vocal forms.
THIS NEW format is an enter
tainment novelty, something
never seen before. It is not exact
ly folk-music; but it is not at all
run-of-the-mill popular music.
Whatever it is, it is engaging.
The most regrettable aspect of
the album is that no program
notes are provided; the origins
of this fascinating collection of
songs remains in darkness.
Two songs are immediately ap
parent renditions of folk stand
ards, with uneven success. Peter,
Paul and Mary must be commend
ed for their now arrangement of
“This Land Is Your Land,” which
has grown rather threadbare
since the Weavers arranged it ac
cording to the popular tastes of
the 1940’5. But the trio’s version
of “Flora” pales beside the stark
drama of Joan Baez’s rendition of
“The Lily of the West.”
SOME OF the songs have mere
ly been disguised by a change of
title: “Pretty Mary” is another
version of “The Wagoner’s Lad”;
“Tiny Sparrow” of “I’m Sad and
I’m Lonely;” and “Gone the Rain
bow” of “Buttermilk Hill” or
“Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier.”
But two of their most effective
pieces seem entirely new. “Man
Come Into Egypt” communicates
all the pioneer vigor of the Oran
im Zahar Troupe, and “A’Soulin’ ”
is a modern madrigal, a counter
pointed round in w'hich instru
ment painstakingly responds to
instrument, voice to voice.

The most intriguing selection
on the present album is “Puff,”
the story of a Magic Dragon. But
by far the most impressive song
is “Old Coat.” It is cast in the
form of a protest song; but the
dominant note is a congenita] pes
simism, poignant but clear-seeing,
and worthy of a Thomas Hardy.
“MOVING" presents a new
Peter, Paul and Mary. They are
more confident in the handling
of solos, of intricate instrumental
mixing, of self-dramatization.
They have left their first album
behind.

dominant note is a congenita] pes
simism, poignant but clear-seeing,
and worthy of a Thomas Hardy.
“MOVING" presents a new
Peter, Paul and Mary. They are
more confident in the handling
of solos, of intricate instrumental
mixing, of self-dramatization.
They have left their first album
behind.
Having left the quiet folk en
clave of San Francisco for the
turmoil of a nation-wide tour,
Peter. Paul and Mary are quickly
proving themselves just about
the best group going. Their latest
album, “Moving” (Warner Bros.
WS 1473), seems commemorative
of this extension.

In this age of increasing urban
ization, Peter, Paul and Mai'y
have achieved something of the
ethnic singer’s involvement in the
total life of a small folk commu
nity. They have thoroughly
grounded themselves in the Holy
Barbarian culture of San Fran
cisco’s North Beach, numbering
among their active enthusiasts
several well-known poets of the
Beat Generation. They seem to
have carried into the wide world
of mid-century America the bo
hemian’s obligation to achieve
above all else an effective aesthet
ic experience.

The keynote of this second al
bum is sophisticated understate
ment. The old “If I Had a Ham
mer” enthusiasm survives in “Big
Boat” and “Morning Train”; but
for the most part it has been re
placed by a versatile manipula
tion of various vocal forms.
THIS NEW format is an enter
tainment novelty, something
never seen before. It is not exact
ly folk-music; but it is not at all
run-of-the-mill popular music.
Whatever it is, it is engaging.
The most regrettable aspect of
the album is that no program
notes are provided; the origins
of this fascinating collection of
songs remains in darkness.
Two songs are immediately ap
parent renditions of folk stand
ards, with uneven success. Peter,
Paul and Mary must be commend
ed for their now arrangement of
“This Land Is Your Land,” which
has grown rather threadbare
since the Weavers arranged it ac
cording to the popular tastes of
the 1940’5. But the trio’s version
of “Flora” pales beside the stark
drama of Joan Baez’s rendition of
“The Lily of the West.”
SOME OF the songs have mere
ly been disguised by a change of
title: “Pretty Mary” is another
version of “The Wagoner’s Lad”;
“Tiny Sparrow” of “I’m Sad and
I’m Lonely;” and “Gone the Rain
bow” of “Buttermilk Hill” or
“Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier.”
But two of their most effective
pieces seem entirely new. “Man
Come Into Egypt” communicates
all the pioneer vigor of the Oran
im Zahar Troupe, and “A’Soulin’ ”
is a modern madrigal, a counter
pointed round in w'hich instru
ment painstakingly responds to
instrument, voice to voice.

The most intriguing selection
on the present album is “Puff,”
the story of a Magic Dragon. But
by far the most impressive song
is “Old Coat.” It is cast in the
form of a protest song; but the
dominant note is a congenita] pes
simism, poignant but clear-seeing,
and worthy of a Thomas Hardy.
