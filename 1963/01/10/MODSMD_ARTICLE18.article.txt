# Hull in P.A. Games
## 
### 
The San Francisco Olympic
Club, assisted in no small way by
Stanford all-AAWU water polo
stars, Marty Hull, Pete Pettigrew,
Bill Lorton, Don Buehler and
George Stransky, placed fourth
in the Pan American Team trials,
held in Lynwood California last
December 20-24. The team barely
missed a tie for first place when
it lost an overtime game to the
Long Beach Nu Pike team by a
score of 4-3. City of Commerce,
composed of players from the
Los Angeles area, was the even
tual winner of the Trials.
Marty Hull, the O Club’s high
scorer with sixteen goals, was
named first alternate on the team
which will represent the United
States in the Pan American
Games which are to be held in
Sao Paulo, Brazil, this April.
Goalie George Stransky was
judged the top goal keeper in the
tournament by the Olympic com
mittee. but will not go to the
games. Only one netman can be
named to the squad, and since
the winning team must represent
the U.S. as a unit, the City of
Commerce goalie was automatic
ally selected.
However, the selections for the
Olympic Games are made on an
individual basis rather than a
team basis. Thus, both Stransky
and Hull have an excellent chance
to gain a place on the U.S. Olym
pic team.
Stanford’s coach Jim Gaughran
was named the assistant manag
er-coach of the U.S. team by the
Olympic committee. Gaughran
also serves as the secretary of
the Olympic Water Polo Commit
tee,
