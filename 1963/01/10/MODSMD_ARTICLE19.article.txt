# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Of Unruly Coaches', Rowdyism And Howie Dallmar 
### Glenn Alford 
Are unruly coaches and rowdy rooting sections ruining college
basketball? A1 Lightner, a man who might be called an authoritative
source, says yes.
Lightner, sports editor of an Oregon newspaper and an ex-ref
eree, claims that such is the case, in an article in the latest Saturday
Evening Post. He was a well-known referee all along the West
Coast and was highly-regarded by the national board of referees,
which accorded him its highest honor; he was named to referee the
NCAA basketball finals in 1959.
However Lightner wasn’t fanned as an especially fine referee.
His biggest claim to fame was the almost unbelievable number of
fights lie became Involved in because of Ids outstanding character
trails.
He believed that the referee the) should be in control of the

proceedings at all times. When
other factors threatened to take
this control away from him he re
taliated with technical fouls and
disqualifications.
THE BEST KNOWN incident
involving Lightner was a 1956
basketball game between South
ern California and Cal played at
Berkeley. After being hit in the
eye by a hot penny, Lightner for
feited the game to SC despite the
game’s being televised to four'
western states. For his efforts the
fiery official received numerous
cuts, bruises and other physical
indignities (ho was hanged in ef
figy, perhaps the only referee to
he so honored.)
In another incident, a brawl
following an Oregon State Idaho
basketball game, Lightner credits
Jungle Jim Loseutoff with saving
his life. Jungle Jim dragged him
into a dressing room and threat-

end (o take on any Moscow basketball aficionados wanting to beat up
Lightner. There were no takers, so Lightner escaped with only a
few broken ribs.
Lightner also fells of the time he was ready to referee an Nt'AA
quarter-final basketball game when the two officials of the proceed
ing contest streaked out of the arena to the officials’ dressing room
pursued by a hundred or so loyal fans of the beaten team.
, The controversial Lightner reached the newspapers last year
after he was attacked while leaving the court after a UCLA-Washing
ton squeaker won by the Bruins in Seattle.
Grayson's Temper Tantrums
Lightner said he never again would referee a game on the Wash
ington home court, and furthermore said very unkind things about
Husky mentor John Grayson. It seems that Big Five referee commis
sioner Bernie Hammerback told Lightner to clamp down on Gray
son’s temper tantrums. He did and was almost killed for his trouble.
An estimate of fifty per cent is placed on the number of basket
ball games in which incidents occur ranging from rooters throwing
papers and pennies on the floor to actual riots. No estimate is placed
on the number of games in which a coach incites the rooters to
constant booing at the officials, but one gets the impression that it
is almost one hundred per cent.
These figures impress and surprise me. While my experience in
viewing college basketball is limited almost entirely to Stanford
home games at the Pavilion, I have yet to see such incidents as
brawls and |»eiiny throwing. I am positive that no such incidents have
occurred in the Pavilion in the past four years.
While Stanford students may be surprised to learn that they
comprise one of the most orderly rooting sections in all of college
basketball, this is undeniably the case. Perhaps it isn’t so surprising
to those who have seen the Cal Straw Hat Band or the St. Mary’s
rooting section in action.
A Sedate Rooting Section
The comparatively sedate Stanford stands may be attributed to
several factors, not the least of which is Coach Howie Dallmar. How

♦ many people who have viewed
Stanford basketball with any
thing approaching regularity dur
ing Dallmar’s tenure on the Farm
can remember him rising from
the bench and shouting at a ref
eree? For a Grayson or a Jack
Gardner (of Utah) to go an en
tire game without screaming,
towel throwing, inciting the
stands, toe to toe yelling with the
referee, etc., would be unthink
able. I cannot recall a technical
foul ever- being called on Dallmar
or- the Stanford bench.
Dallmar’s dislike of showboat
ing should not be mistaken for
timidity. Any referee making
what the Stanford coach consid
ers a bum call will be told about
it, but only when he is within
ear shot of the seated Dallmar.
I have seen many an official got
his ears blistered. That Dallmar
can and does do this without ne
cessarily arousing the audience
against the referees is a credit to
him and the Stanford team.
