### 
Stanford University has been
condemned as a “cultural aggres
sor" by the Red Chinese govern
ment for establishing its most
recent overseas campus on Tai
wan.

In a recent broadcast from Pe
king Radio monitored on Taiwan,
Stanford’s Center for Chinese
Studies at Taipei’s National Uni
versity was included in a sweep
ing indictment which Red China
called “the intensification of the
cultural aggression in Taiwan by
the American imperialists.’’
AFTER NOTING that (he Stan
ford Center will “make a concrete
and intensive research of Chinese
culture,” Radio Peking said, "We
all know that in recent years the
American imperialists have been
using various means of aggres
sion in Taiwan, such as building
many churches and sending a
large number of fathers and pas
tors to hatch all kinds of criminal
plots under the cover of religion
. . . The Americans have intensi
fied their subversive activities
in the fields of politics, econom
ics, and culture."
Red China also denounced as
“cultural secret agents” the oper
ations of various State Depart
ment and private foundation cul
tural and educational exchange
programs.
Instruction began September 26
for the first group of 12 Stanford
students at the Taipei campus.
They are taking intensive courses
in Mandarin Chinese under the
tutelage of qualified Taipei na
tionals.
