### ROY SCHMIDT 
(Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond of a two-part series on the
objectives ami organization of
Tresidd<T Union.)

To achieve its two-fold role of
playing an active role in the edu
cation process and providing
needed services and facilities on
campus, Tresidder Union must
be by definition an organization
as well as a building.
The organization is a unique
one at Stanford in that students,
faculty, and administration work
closely together to develop an ef
fective program.
The Union Committee, which
consists of five students, four
members of the faculty and three
administrators, heads the organi
zation and acts as an advisory
body to the University president,
who has ultimate control.
The committee meets only once
per month to discuss matters of
general policy, leaving the day
to-day operation of the Union to
the Union Board, a body com
posed entirely of students. That
body is chaired by Sandy McKen
zie, an ambitious sophomore.
The Board is composed of two
representatives of each class as
well as three members at large.
Although control theoretically
extends from the Union Commit
tee down to the Union Board and
from there to the various division
chairmen, each branch is really
semi-autonomous in so far as
planning activities goes.
Pirie Gall, who heads the Cul
tural Arts Division in addition to
holding a seat on the Union
Board, points out that flexibility

is a very important element in
the organization structure. “Each
division chairman is really quite
free to develop his own ideas;
there is a great deal of room for
creative thinking and follow
through.”
The other divisions of the or
ganization run by students arc
Program Division, headed by
Todd Davis; Games Division,
Larry Dubois; and Information
Division, Howard Stevenson.

There will lx* an orienta
tion meeting lor all people
interested in applying for the
open position on the Union
Board and for those interest
ed in working on the various
divisions of the Union organ
ization. The meeting will lx 1
held at 7:30 p.m. in Room
270, Tresidder.
