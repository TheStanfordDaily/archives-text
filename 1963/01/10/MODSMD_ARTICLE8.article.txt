# New Rush Proposal Submitted to Sterling
## 
### 
The ad hoc committee appointed by Acting Dean of Men
David Larimer and ASSU President Rosencranz to study changes
in the rush policy has submitted its compromise proposal to Pres
ident Sterling.
Legislature adopted the joint proposal of the Interfraternity

Council, the Interclub Council,4
and the Interhouse Council last
night.
THE IFC approved the joint
proposal for Living Group Selec
tion Monday night; yesterday
the Interfraternity Board, an ad
visory committee to Sterling com
posed of faculty members and
students, approved the proposal.
Sterling is now to determine the
adoption of the proposal.
The major change from the
present rush policy concerns the
restricted contact between
rushees and fraternity and eating
club members allowed during
Winter Quarter. The conditions
for this contact presented in the
new proposal are; "(1) open con
tact on the campus; (2) no con
tact off of the campus; (3) no
rushing contact in Wilbur; (4)
contact for Stern people in Wil
bur to compensate for the open
houses; (51 no commitments
made by freshmen or the upper
class living groups; and (6) ad
ditional strictures imposed by
the IFC, the ICC, and the IHC
if they so desire.”
Informal commitment will be
allowed individuals to any living
group during the first seven
weeks of Spring Quarter. On
Wednesday of the seventh week
of Spring Quarter, formal com
mitment will be made for all

living groups through the Dean
of Men’s Office.
DURING the informal commit
ment period, no pins may be is
sued, cards signed, or contact
made at meals. Otherwise the re
stricted contact conditions of
Winter Quarter will apply for
this seven-week period. Excep
tions to those conditions are open
weekend nights allowed the first,
third, and fifth weeks of Spring
Quarter off campus.
IFC recommended that the
first three-day weekend run from
Thursday through Saturday in
stead of the proposed Friday
through Sunday open nights.
Enforcement of the proposal
will be by fines for violations im
posed by the IFC, ICC, and IHC
respectively. Fines will consist of
$lOO for the first violation, $250
for the second violation, and $5OO
for each subsequent violation in
a single academic year.

committee who began work on
these policy changes last fall are:

Mike Hammer, IFC Rush Chair
man; Pat Shue, Chairman of
Stern House President’s Council;
