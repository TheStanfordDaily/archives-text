United Press International
WASHINGTON The Democratic-controllcd 88th Congress
opened yesterday by handing President Kennedy a House Rules
Committee victory that could make it easier for at least part of the
administration’s controversial legislative program. Barely three
hours after the new Congress convened, the House approved an ad
ministration proposal that permanently established its powerful
Rules Committee of the House as a 15-member body. The move was
designed to retain administration control of the committee.

FIRE SWEEPS EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NEW YORK A
series of fires swept through the towering Empire State Building
yesterday, keeping thousands of office workers from their jobs
while firemen battled flames and choking smoke a quarter of a
mile high in the world’s tallest skyscraper. The fire apparently
started in a shaft housing steam pipes, water mains and electrical
conduits. The shaft runs from the basement to the top of Manhat
tan's most famous landmark.

barbed wire as they went and signaling for aid with a burning
handkerchief when they found the exit grill to West Berlin frozen
tight.
