A five-year grant of 82.5 million to Stanford to strengthen its
international studies program was announced by the Ford Foun
dation on Dec. 20. According to Frof. Carl B. Spaeth, chairman
of tlit' International Studies Committee, the grant will support
expansion, both of teaching and research, in the international I'ield.

“The Ford grant did not include*
funds to support foreign student |
activities as such,” Spaeth said. I

strengthen its program for for-!
eign students.”

| ing European studies seminar, in-
I voicing faculty and students in
j the social sciences and human!-
| lies in detailed study of a selected
! problem every year; conduct com
parative studies of selected activi
! ties and institutions found in
(Communist bloc countries; ap
i point additional faculty members
I in East Asian studies; and con
j tinue research on the economic
impact of Portuguese policy in
