# Generally Beneficial Proposals for Rush Have Major Defect
## 
### 
In their recommendations to President Sterling for major
changes in rushing policy, the five-man committee has proposed
three excellent alterations in policy. The fourth major alteration,
however, is a mistake of the first order.
Thi> first sound change the committee proposes is to establish
open contact Winter quarter for fraternities. Since the eating clubs
already have open contact with freshmen Winter quarter, only
the fraternity system w ill be affected by section R-l. By permitting
more contact, the proposal will encourage long-term associations
and discourage some superficiality.
The same result should derive from the committee’s second
major suggestion that freshmen be permitted to make formal
commitments only in the seventh week of Spring Quarter. Al
though informal commitments are permitted earlier and undoubt
edly will be made, the requirement to delay formal pledging can
only serve to encourage sound and discourage hasty decisions.
From the point of view of developing a viable house system in the
Wilbur complex, this alteration is logical and overdue. The less
a house’s membership owes allegiance to another living group,
the more easily a house may develop its own cultural and social
programs.
Intending to accomplish the same result, the committee has
further recommended that no formal pledge activities be permitted
until the seventh week of Spring quarter. This third proposal is
also welcome as an attempt to correct imperfections in the status
quo.
However, the fourth proposal (section C-3) is a mistake: dur
ing Spring quarter freshmen may not be invited to meals at living
groups until after the Wednesday of the seventh week. According
to John Steinbruner, Head Sponsor at Wilbur and a member of
the drafting committee, the purpose of this regulation is to pre
vent the mass exodus of freshmen on specific evenings to their new
living groups. The result of such an exodus is to (Jbnfuse the
Wilbur kitchen and disrupt the unity of the houses. Furthermore,
as Ed Eschbach points out, if fraternities were permitted to have
“pledge dinners the effect of the three other major changes would
be lost, and fraternities have never been happy about having to
finance regular dinners for twenty or more pledges anyway.
All of tin 1 foregoing arguments are solid reasons for elimi
nating meal-time contact between fraternities and freshmen for
seven weeks in Spring Quarter. But these arguments are irrelevant
to the different circumstances of rush on the part of eating clubs.
There are only seven eating clubs, and their freshman members
would not constitute an exodus if they ate from time to time at
the clubs. Since eating clubs generally conduct a more informal
rush, the effect on the clubs of the first three alterations will be
negligible. The effect of tl lis meal edict, however, could seriously
disrupt eating club rush. The raison d’etre of eating clubs is im
plied in their name: they are, foremost, places where men eat to
gether. Almost the only time that an entire club is together is for
meals. By depriving the clubs of their natural rushing procedure
although not their only one, the proposed policy is a decided
mistake. It is surprising the President of ICC acquiesced in the
proposal. No doubt the ICC will have something to say on the
matter when they meet Monday night. Until then, the University
would be correct in holding the proposals in abeyance.
