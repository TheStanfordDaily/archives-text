### 
(Fditor’s note: contrary to the
information in yesterday’s Daily,
the Legislature lias not adopted,
endorsed, or commented on the
new rushing proposal drawn up
l»y the President of IFF, the IFt'
Kush Chairman, the Head Spon
sor of Wilbur, th<' ICC President,
and the Chairman of the Stern
House President's Council. Fur
thermore, although the IFC' has
endorsed the proposal, the ICC
has not considered and will not
consider the proposal until next
Monday night. The proposal,
from tiu> ad hoe committee of five
appointed by Dean Larimer and
ASSU President Annin Rosen
eranz, has been submitted already
to President -I. Wallace Sterling
for action by him. There follows
the text of the proposal.)
The committee to reconsider
the method of conducting frater
nity and eating club and non-af
filiated rush has met weekly
throughout the quarter. We have
concluded that certain changes
are desirable in the current meth

of living group selection. Al
though the particular problems
and interests of the groups we
represent are too divergent to al
low for a common agreement on
what would be the best system of
selection, we have been able to
agree on a compromise proposal
to which wc believe the particular
interests of our respective groups
are compatible and which we
think would constitute an overall
substantial improvement in the
present system. We urge the
adoption of the following propos-
