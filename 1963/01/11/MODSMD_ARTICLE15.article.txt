# MOVIE REVIEW
## Comedy, Not Striptease Featured in 'Gypsy' 
### STEVE ZOUSMER Contributing Editor 
As most of us have said at one
time or another, there’s nothing
like a good striptease. And if you
see the movie “Gypsy,” the story
of the early life of peeler Gypsy
Rose Lee, you will see nothing
like a good striptease.

However, you may be enter
tained anyway. It is a colorful
musical-comedy with fairly good
music (songs like “Small World”
and “Everything’s Coming Up
Roses”) and comedy which can
he very good when actress Rosa
lind Russell has a hand in it.
RUSSELL plays Rose Hovic.
gaudy and ambitious hell-raiser
of a mother whose only purpose
in life is that her two daughters
make it in vaudeville’s big time
—-where Rose herself had failed.
A sure thing for stardom is
daughter “Baby June,” blond and
blue-eyed child cutie who sings
and dances so well that she
charms every old lecher in the
theater. Less promising is daugh
ter Louise (Natalie Wood) who
has no talent (“I have no talent,”
she says), although we know she
will grow up to be Gypsy and
corner the affections of lechers
everywhere, even though she
never finishes a strip. A man is
needed to help manage the act,
and that man is Harvey (Karl
Malden), the reliable candy barr
salesman who falls in love with
Rose. And she falls in love with
him, despite his mushroom-like
nose.

Rose, Harvey, and the girls
troop through the brassy back
woods of the nation’s vaudeville
circuit and there is large fun and
laughs. But problems emerge.
Harvey wants to marry Rose but
because of her efforts to promote

Baby June she doesn’t have time
to look him in the nose and say
yes. The girls become adolescents
and Baby June (in real life to be
come actress June Havoc) thinks
of striking out on her own.
Only Louise causes no trouble.
Louise is a worm. Self-effacing
and pathetjc in the shadow of
glamorous Baby June, her per
sonality is totally flavorless. This
is due in part to Natalie Wood’s
cardboard performance in the
role, but it doesn’t matter because
she is in the background for most
of the picture.
HER CHANCE comes when sis
ter June runs away and gets mar
ried. “Baby June” was only thir
teen years old and this horrifies
those of us who forget that rock
and roll singer Jerry Lee Lewis
married his twelve-year-old cou
sin several years ago and hasn’t
been heard of since. Anyway, the
act is now built around Louise
and it flops. Catastrophe is in
sight when they are booked into
a burlesque house. But Rose re
fuses to quit, as a last resort
forces poor Louise to get her
good dross on and go out and take
it off for the burlesque audience.
This is the last straw for Har
vey, who stalks out forever. Shy
Louise dutifully dresses up for
her performance, looks at herself
in the mirror and experiences the
revelation that will change her
life: “Mama,” she says, amazed,
“I’m a pretty girl.” Seventeen
years old and she’d never looked
in a mirror. If nothing else, Nat
alie Wood is a pretty girl and the
line would not have been less in
congruous if she’d asked, “Hey
Ma, where’s the dental floss?”
And so, introduced as Gypsy
Rose Lee, she steps out on the
stage and strips, though she
strips like a “Lady,” i.e. removing

only fur coat and gloves. Strips
like that are very big with the
censors.
BUT IT goes over well and a
rhinestone star is born. In her
success she gets snooty and re
jects her mother, only to take
her back in the final dramatic
scene.
“Gypsy” is a fun movie with
several clever, colorful scenes
and a wonderful performance by
Rosalind Russell. Karl Malden is
good and Natalie Wood is pretty.
It is only when the picture is get
ting too long and made longer
that it loses its bounce. The moth
er-daughter conflict is tacked on
unnecessarily at the last minute,
other incidents are too facile, and
there are several loose ends, for
instance, whatever happened to
Baby June?

Louise is a worm. Self-effacing

sonality is totally flavorless. This
is due in part to Natalie Wood’s
cardboard performance in the

she is in the background for most
of the picture.

ried. “Baby June” was only thir
teen years old and this horrifies
those of us who forget that rock

sin several years ago and hasn’t
been heard of since. Anyway, the
act is now built around Louise
and it flops. Catastrophe is in
sight when they are booked into
a burlesque house. But Rose re
fuses to quit, as a last resort
forces poor Louise to get her
good dross on and go out and take
it off for the burlesque audience.
This is the last straw for Har
vey, who stalks out forever. Shy
Louise dutifully dresses up for
her performance, looks at herself
in the mirror and experiences the
revelation that will change her
life: “Mama,” she says, amazed,
“I’m a pretty girl.” Seventeen
years old and she’d never looked
in a mirror. If nothing else, Nat
alie Wood is a pretty girl and the
line would not have been less in
congruous if she’d asked, “Hey
Ma, where’s the dental floss?”
And so, introduced as Gypsy
Rose Lee, she steps out on the
stage and strips, though she
strips like a “Lady,” i.e. removing

only fur coat and gloves. Strips
like that are very big with the
censors.

rhinestone star is born. In her
success she gets snooty and re

her back in the final dramatic

“Gypsy” is a fun movie with
several clever, colorful scenes
and a wonderful performance by
Rosalind Russell. Karl Malden is
good and Natalie Wood is pretty.
It is only when the picture is get

As most of us have said at one
time or another, there’s nothing
like a good striptease. And if you
see the movie “Gypsy,” the story
of the early life of peeler Gypsy
Rose Lee, you will see nothing
like a good striptease.

However, you may be enter
tained anyway. It is a colorful
musical-comedy with fairly good
music (songs like “Small World”
and “Everything’s Coming Up
Roses”) and comedy which can

lind Russell has a hand in it.
RUSSELL plays Rose Hovic.
gaudy and ambitious hell-raiser
of a mother whose only purpose
in life is that her two daughters
make it in vaudeville’s big time
—-where Rose herself had failed.
A sure thing for stardom is
daughter “Baby June,” blond and
blue-eyed child cutie who sings
and dances so well that she
charms every old lecher in the
theater. Less promising is daugh
ter Louise (Natalie Wood) who
has no talent (“I have no talent,”
she says), although we know she
will grow up to be Gypsy and
corner the affections of lechers
everywhere, even though she
never finishes a strip. A man is
needed to help manage the act,
and that man is Harvey (Karl
Malden), the reliable candy barr
salesman who falls in love with
Rose. And she falls in love with
him, despite his mushroom-like
nose.

Rose, Harvey, and the girls
troop through the brassy back
woods of the nation’s vaudeville
circuit and there is large fun and
laughs. But problems emerge.
Harvey wants to marry Rose but
because of her efforts to promote

Baby June she doesn’t have time
to look him in the nose and say
yes. The girls become adolescents
and Baby June (in real life to be
come actress June Havoc) thinks
of striking out on her own.
Only Louise causes no trouble.
Louise is a worm. Self-effacing
and pathetjc in the shadow of
glamorous Baby June, her per
sonality is totally flavorless. This
is due in part to Natalie Wood’s
cardboard performance in the
role, but it doesn’t matter because
she is in the background for most
of the picture.
HER CHANCE comes when sis
ter June runs away and gets mar
ried. “Baby June” was only thir
teen years old and this horrifies
those of us who forget that rock
and roll singer Jerry Lee Lewis
married his twelve-year-old cou
sin several years ago and hasn’t
been heard of since. Anyway, the
act is now built around Louise
and it flops. Catastrophe is in
sight when they are booked into
a burlesque house. But Rose re
fuses to quit, as a last resort
forces poor Louise to get her
good dross on and go out and take
it off for the burlesque audience.
This is the last straw for Har
vey, who stalks out forever. Shy
Louise dutifully dresses up for
her performance, looks at herself
in the mirror and experiences the
revelation that will change her
life: “Mama,” she says, amazed,
“I’m a pretty girl.” Seventeen
years old and she’d never looked
in a mirror. If nothing else, Nat
alie Wood is a pretty girl and the
line would not have been less in
congruous if she’d asked, “Hey
Ma, where’s the dental floss?”
And so, introduced as Gypsy
Rose Lee, she steps out on the
stage and strips, though she
strips like a “Lady,” i.e. removing

only fur coat and gloves. Strips
like that are very big with the
censors.
