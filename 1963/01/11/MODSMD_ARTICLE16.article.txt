## Military Power Cannot Change Present East-West Boundaries 
### 
In a newspaper interview, Mr. Khrushchev has recently said
that the Cuban crisis in October will “leave a very deep imprint
on international relations. This was a moment when the sinister
shadow of nuclear war raced over the world. People started look
ini' at questions of peace and war in a new day.” The new way, he

added, is to forestall danger by
“way of compromise.”
We are not, I think, at (hat
point. That is to say. we are not
at the point where a settlement
of I lie cold war by compromise is
in sight. It is more exact to say
that after the Cuban crisis the
nuclear powers know better than
they did before that they cannot
initiate as against one another
important changes in the balance
of power. As between East and
West, military power cannot be
used to change existing bounda
ries.

This is a very
great lesson to
have learned.
But it does not
mean that we
are now in a
position to begin
negotiating a set
tlement of cold
war. Where we
have actually
gotten to is a
■r the compulsion

of the nuclear clanger to live with
the situation as it is.
What we have then is not peace
but a pause, and in this pause a
reduction of the pressures at the
vital points, notably Berlin, where
the danger of nuclear war is most
threatening. The effect of the
pause in the East-West conflict Is
to make more emphatic and ur

own volition to any living group
at any time during Spring that
they wish to do so. Formal com
mitments will be made for all liv
ing groups through a central of
fice (Dean of Men’s Office) on
Wednesday of the seventh week
in Spring quarter.
3. There will be no contact at
meals during Spring quarter un
til after 7 weeks.
4, No person whether or not he
has given a voluntary statement
of commitment or intention can
be considered a member or pledge
of any sort of a living group (i.e.
a house, club, or fraternity) until
the formal commitment is made.
No pledge materials are to be
distributed during this time. No
formal pledge class meetings or
formal activities of freshmen in
itiates are to be held before this
time, nor are freshmen officers
to be established.

gent the internal problems and
issues within the Communist
world and within ours.
THESE internal problems are
one reason, perhaps the main rea
son, why the pause does not mean
(hat we are in sight of a settle
ment. Neither side, neither Mr.
Khrushchev nor Mr. Kennedy,
has the power to make a settle
ment. Mr. Khrushchev is en
tangled in a struggle with China
for the leadership of the Com
munist world.
In the West, American leader
ship of the Western Alliance is
no longer accepted. It would not
be going too far to say, I think,
that, given the pause which re
sulted from the Cuban affair,
President Kennedy’s greatest task
will be to reappraise, redefine
and readjust the American role
in the Western World.
The era which began with
World War II has ended, the era
in which the United States was
at (he same time the defender
and the banker of the Western
World. The United States, to be
sure, continues to have a virtual
monopoly on nuclear weapons.
But the time has arrived when the
military defense of the Western
World, and particularly of West
ern Europe, can no longer be
borne in so extraordinarily large
a measure by the United States.
AT THE same time, the United
States is no longer able to be the
preeminent banker, and if it is to
continue to play the part it is now
playing, it will need to have still
greater cooperation from Europe.
It will have to have greater co
operation in preserving the inter
national usefulness of the dollar,
greater cooperation in the open
ing of markets to American ex
ports, greater cooperation in fi
nancing the defense of Europe
and the development of the na
tions of the Southern Hemis
phere.
The coming session of Congress
will be under the shadow of these
American needs. Can the Presi
dent obtain from Congress the
legislation to try—conceding that
no one can be absolutely sure it
will succeed—to try to overcome
the sluggishness of the American
economy since the middle of the
Fifties? This must be done if the
United States is to hold its place
in the world.
Can the administration negoti
ate successfully in Europe a co
operative defense of the dollar—
which is the reserve currency of
the non-Communist world? Un
less the administration can do
this, the withdrawal of gold—now
running at nearly a billion dollars
a year—will cause the kind of re
action in Congress and in this
country which could end in an in
sistence upon restricting Ameri
can investment abroad and on
raising the tariffs and imposing
quotas to reduce imports into the
United States.
The great design of a liberal
low-tariff area throughout the
whole non-Communist world is
not only a long way from being
realized. Because of the condition
of our international balance of
payments, the great design is
threatened by a serious relapse
into protectionism,
