How many times have eager
Stanford students been turned
away from performances and lec
tures because culture enthusi
asts from Paly got there first.
Isn't it time that some action be
taken to give priority to Stanford
students for tickets to publicized
events on campus? Perhaps ticket
sales could be limited to students
for the first few days before a
performance, and then opened to
the public. Similar priority for
free concerts and lectures should
be given to student-body-card
holders until a short time before
the scheduled event.
