# STAFF OPINION
## Both Fraternities and Freshmen Will Suffer If New Rushing Proposals Are Adopted 
### WILLIAM REPPY Associate Editor Vice-President, Chi Psi Fraternity 
One reading of the new rush
proposal on Page 2 and you know
that the anti-fraternity forces at
Stanford are at work again. How
ever, it is the freshman man on
campus who will suffer the most
if this proposal is adopted.
Of course, the worst part of
the proposal is Sec. C, 112, which
forbids freshmen to pledge the
faternity of their choice until the
seventh week of the quarter.
With rushing open houses start
ing early in winter quarter for
the first time this year, this pro
vision means rush is dragged out
for nearly three months a hell
ishly long time.
AFTER ANXIOUS weeks of
preliminaries and the hectic for
mal rush early in spring quarter,
most freshmen men will be ready
to make a decision, but the pro
posal forbids them to do so. In
stead. they may make “informal
commitments.”
For more than five weeks this
not-quite-a-pledge is forbidden to
share meals with brothers of his
chosen fraternity, to get to know
them well before the long separa
tion of summer vacation. He can
not at this time bring over to the

fraternity house his freshman
friends to promote in person their
being rushed.
How can this mixed-up fresh
man, a prospective pledge, decide
in the fraternity is the wisest
period, that formal membership
in the fraternity is the misest
choice to be made, unless he can
spend much of this time with the
fraternity members?
SURE, HE can attend parties
on the 3rd and sth Saturdays
spring quarter, but for the fresh
man men still uncertain about the
decision to be made these social
functions are not the best place
to really get to know the mem
bors of the fraternity.
How can he get to know well
his pledge brothers, the members
of his own class who will be his
closest friends, if he fears that
meeting with them will be held
a violation of Sec. C, H4, and
bring a $lOO fine?
The proposal will also be tough
on the fraternities. Rush is very
expensive and time consuming.
No house can afford anything but
an all-out effort since competi
tion is so keen. Under this pro
posal the competition would con
tinue—and with it, the spending
and lost hours—until the seventh
week.
FIGURES SHOW that grade
point averages have traditionally
dropped in spring quarter, the
rush quarter, for fraternity men
and usually for freshman men as
well. Under this proposal GPA’s
would fall even lower, for the ex
tended rush disrupts almost the
entire spring quarter as well as
most of winter quarter.
We are here at Stanford first
to study. It is foolish to take
many additional hours away from
our major pursuit—learning to
add to a rush program that is al
ready long enough!
For the sake of both the fresh

men and fraternity men, this pro
posal must be studied again be
fore it is approved.
