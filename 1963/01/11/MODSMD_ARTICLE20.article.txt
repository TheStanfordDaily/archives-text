## U.S. Must Continue to Oppose Portuguese Colonial Position 
### DANIEL SCHWARTZ Staff Editor 
At the end of last year, a treaty
expired which provided for the
U.S.-NATO base on the Azore Is
lands controlled by Portugal, a
NATO member.
The Azore base, it would seem,
is of great importance to NATO)
forces protected by long-range
bomber. In past years a large
percentage of the U.S.-NATO air
traffic through Europe went
through the Azores.
Portugal, however, has threat-1
ened to refuse to renew the treaty j
| and has even threatened to resign j
from the UN.
The reason for those threats is
the policy held by the U.S. con
cerning the Portuguese African
colonies particularly Angola and |
Mozambique.
SINCE MARCH, 1961, in “every
vote" that has gone to the UN'
about the Portuguese colonies, the I
U.S. has “been against Portugal,” )
reports a release from the Portu- j
guese - American Committee on ;
Foreign Affairs.
! The release continues: “Do you
I wonder that the Portuguese are
upset? In return for friendship
and the Azores, we (the U.S.)
have joined with the militant na
lionalist Afro-Asian bloc at the
UN and the Soviet Union in an
effort to dismember Portugal.”
The release claims: “. . . our
(the U.S. i anti-colonial policy in
Africa is fashioned by the feeling
that the Negroes in this country
want it that way.
“Or to put it in other terms,” ]
the release continues, “the Admin- [
istration seems to feel that the!
Negroes in this country back!
racism in Africa, since most of j
the leaders in the new African!
states are frankly racist. ...” |
IT IS difficult to understand
whore these ideas came from.
The accusation that an anti-1
colonial policy is dictated by the j
wishes to appease the Negro pop- j
ulation in this country is certain-1
ly way out of line. It is a ridicu- j
ious statement which seems to j
have been written by someone j
who can not recognize that a pol
icy of equality is followed not to '
appease but because it is morally !
right, and tire basis of a democ- j
racy.
The accusation of “racism”!

thrust on the new leaders of Af
rica is almost as difficult to sub
stantiate. Only in the Congo a
country ill-prepared for self-rule,
and thrown into confusion by
Europeans unwilling to give the
country a true self-rule have any
inter racial conflicts arisen.
IN ALMOST all other countries
notably the peaceful and vastly
properous giant of Nigeria,
among ol hers the Europeans and
the Africans have quietly worked
well together.
In a time of diminishing useful
ness of the long-range-bomber,
and, at the same time, the emerg
ence of a strong and independent
Africa, it would he wise for the
U.S. to continue to follow, with
scrutiny, an “anti-colonial policy.”
