# Tribe Faces Beavers; Dose to Duel Counts
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
A Stanford basketball team undefeated in double-overtime
games will face its sternest competition of tbe 1962-63 season to
night and tomorrow. The Oregon State Beavers, nationally ranked
among tbe nation’s ten best teams and sporting an 8-3 record,
visit the Farm, with action starting in the Pavilion at 8 pan. both

nights. The Indians have playedH
and won two consecutive double
overtime squeakers. The first,
and most easily forgotten, was a
poorly-played triumph over Wash
ington in the Los Angelos Clas
sic. The most recent was a 70-68
thriller over Cal last Tuesday at
Berkeley.
OREGON STATE sports the
best seven-foot basketball player
in college ranks today in Mel
Counts, who is not just another
big goon. Counts, as befits a big
man, is adept at stuffing loose
bails through the hoop at close

range. He also pops in set and
jump shots at distances up to 25
feet. The Beavers ran into a cold
streak against Idaho a year ago,
and Counts snapped them out of
it with a streak of successful
long-distance buckets.
Another well-known Beaver is
forward-guard Terry Baker. OSU
Coach Slats Gill has been rotating
Baker bteween the two positions
since the Heisman Trophy win
ner returned to the basketball
wars. Baker responded to what
might have been a confusing sit
uation with a scoring average of
close to 15.
Bill Kraus, Frank Peters, Steve
Pauly and Jim Jarvis are the sup
porting cast, and the other three
starting Beavers will be chosen
from among them. The most like
ly OSU lineup will be Pauly and
Kraus at forwards, Counts at cen
ter, and Bakei- and Peters at
guards. Jarvis had been touted as
the best basketball prospect ever
to attend Oregon State, hut he’s
had trouble scoring, averaging
only 28 per cent from the field.
GILL'S STRATEGY will he to
move Counts outside. This will
force Stanford’s own nonesuch
center, Tom Dose, to stay outside
with him on defense.
Stanford will send against this
formidable foe a starting lineup
of Dose at center, Hollis Moore
and Bob Sommers at forwards,
and Darrell Sutherland and Don
Clemetson at guards.
It was not generally known,
hut Stanford was physically far
below par at the time of this
week’s tussle with Cal. Both Dose
and Moore had the flu and missed
practices. Lew Shupe, the mighty
mite who sank the Bears with
five second half buckets and a
pair of overtime free throws,
practiced only Monday before the
game. Shupe was hobbling on a
badly turned ankle, and up ’til
game time it was doubtful
whether he could play.

BV TONIGHT, Stanford should
be at top strength. Besides the
starting five and Shupe, others
who are likely to see action are
Clayton Raaka. Craig Cordes and
Kent Hinckley.
Raaka is a good defender and
rebounder, but has had trouble
finding the scoring range. He is
perhaps the highest jumper on
the team. Cordes is steadily im
proving defensively, and he re
bounds well. Like Raaka he has
had trouble scoring. Hinckley is
one of the better shooters among
the Indian guards. A transfer
from Menlo J.C. where he played
forward, Hinckley knows where
the basket is, but still must ad
just himself to playing an un
familier position.

jump shots at distances up to 25
feet. The Beavers ran into a cold
streak against Idaho a year ago,
and Counts snapped them out of
it with a streak of successful
long-distance buckets.
Another well-known Beaver is
forward-guard Terry Baker. OSU
Coach Slats Gill has been rotating
Baker bteween the two positions
since the Heisman Trophy win
ner returned to the basketball
wars. Baker responded to what
might have been a confusing sit
uation with a scoring average of
close to 15.
Bill Kraus, Frank Peters, Steve
Pauly and Jim Jarvis are the sup
porting cast, and the other three
starting Beavers will be chosen
from among them. The most like
ly OSU lineup will be Pauly and
Kraus at forwards, Counts at cen
ter, and Bakei- and Peters at
guards. Jarvis had been touted as
the best basketball prospect ever
to attend Oregon State, hut he’s
had trouble scoring, averaging
only 28 per cent from the field.
GILL'S STRATEGY will he to
move Counts outside. This will
force Stanford’s own nonesuch
center, Tom Dose, to stay outside
with him on defense.
Stanford will send against this
formidable foe a starting lineup
of Dose at center, Hollis Moore
and Bob Sommers at forwards,
and Darrell Sutherland and Don
Clemetson at guards.
It was not generally known,
hut Stanford was physically far
below par at the time of this
week’s tussle with Cal. Both Dose
and Moore had the flu and missed
practices. Lew Shupe, the mighty
mite who sank the Bears with
five second half buckets and a
pair of overtime free throws,
practiced only Monday before the
game. Shupe was hobbling on a
badly turned ankle, and up ’til
game time it was doubtful
whether he could play.

BV TONIGHT, Stanford should
be at top strength. Besides the
starting five and Shupe, others
who are likely to see action are
Clayton Raaka. Craig Cordes and
Kent Hinckley.
Raaka is a good defender and
rebounder, but has had trouble
finding the scoring range. He is
perhaps the highest jumper on
the team. Cordes is steadily im
proving defensively, and he re
bounds well. Like Raaka he has
had trouble scoring. Hinckley is
one of the better shooters among
the Indian guards. A transfer
from Menlo J.C. where he played
forward, Hinckley knows where
the basket is, but still must ad
just himself to playing an un
