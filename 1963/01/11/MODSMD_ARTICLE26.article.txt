# New York (Columbia) Basketball Has Nowhere to Go But Up!
## 
### RON RAPOPORT Contributing Sports editor 
NEW YORK The basketball fan located in
Manhattan for the duration may have been in
trigued by an article in the theater section of a
New York daily a while ago. (This back in those
antediluvian days when there were newspapers
here. I A new musical comedy entitled “Nowhere
To Go But Up” had just opened and the impulse
to regard it as the theme for the local collegiate
basketball situation was hard to resist.
COLUMBIA, FOR instance, whose hardcourt
exploits are currently providing diversion for the
faithful in the immediate area, had a record of
three victories and 21 defeats last year and, along
with most of the other of New York's team, indeed
had nowhere to go but up. The only thing wrong
with this Broadway-provided omen was that No
where went nowhere and closed after nine per
formances.
But even though there has been nothing spec
tacular forthcoming, Columbia does seem to be
making a bid to move upward; at least a little. In
their first three games the Lions equalled last
season’s victory record by beating CCNY, Colgate
and Williams, causing some to hope that they
j might be the sleepers of the year.
But an initial loss to Rufgers, which was joined
by a few more, including an .80-70 Ivy League con
test with Cornell, showed that if Columbia is New
York’s sleeper team of the year they snore a lot.
THK LIONS PLAY in a gym which makes the
! Stanford Pavilion look like a combination of Sol
j diet ’s Field and the Taj Mahal. Temporary bleach-
I ers behind two rows of folding chairs which the
j spectator negotiates like a tight-rope provide the
only seating.
The fan (the cluck. Mark Harris would say) is
I virtually indistinguishable from his Western
j counterpart and so is the referee. When things get
1 dull on the floor these two species can be counted
I upon for entertainment. “Traveling,” shrieks the
j ref, his face crimson and his hands circling each

other epileptically. “You’re ugly, ref," complains
the fan. And so it goes.
The style of play here ensures high scoring.
When you get the ball you shoot it and if you miss
you shoot it again. Sooner or later, the strategy
runs, it will go in. With this emphasis even the
poorer teams have their share of good outside
shooters. It's all for the best, though, because
most of them have more trouble getting inside
than Adlai Stevenson.
BUT WHEN the outside shooting gets hot it's
every man for himself. Behind Colgate 29 24 with
five minutes left in the half, some of the boys with
the liking for the long ones started prompting
each other and the intermission score read 41-29
with Columbia in front. In the second half things
cooled off but those five minutes gave the Lions
the wherewithal for a TS-t>7 win.
The best of Columbia’s sharpshooters is a soph
omore guard named Neil Father. He averages
about 19 points a game, mostly on .jump shots
from 15 feet or more. Against Lehigh the other
night Farber threw in 25 points, 19 in the second
half.
But he that as it may there are no titles in
Columbia’s future this year and the purist must
turn elsewhere. Say to high schools in Nassau
County out in the wilds of Long Island.
ST. AGNES had led Malverne all the way and
was ahead 6(5-62 with six seconds left. A free threw
by a gentleman named Wandy Williams brought
Malverne a point closer and then, after Williams
missed another foul shot, a teammate grabbed the
ball and shoved it through, 66-65.
St. Agnes took the ball. but. while being
swarmed upon, a St. Agnes man panicked and
called time out. Two seconds left. A St. Agnes
player threw it in hounds the length of the court
as the buzzer rang and fans swarmed on the court.
But the ball had hit the low ceiling and the referee
ordered the clock back to two seconds. Malverne’s
ball. In to Williams who shoots and misses. St.
Agnes wins.
Two weeks later the same teams played again,
this lime with Malverne winning by a point. You
can guess who came up with a three-point play in
the last four seconds to win it.

ST. AGNES had led Malverne all the way and

by a gentleman named Wandy Williams brought
Malverne a point closer and then, after Williams
missed another foul shot, a teammate grabbed the
ball and shoved it through, 66-65.
St. Agnes took the ball. but. while being
swarmed upon, a St. Agnes man panicked and
called time out. Two seconds left. A St. Agnes
player threw it in hounds the length of the court
as the buzzer rang and fans swarmed on the court.
But the ball had hit the low ceiling and the referee
ordered the clock back to two seconds. Malverne’s
ball. In to Williams who shoots and misses. St.

Two weeks later the same teams played again,

faithful in the immediate area, had a record of
three victories and 21 defeats last year and, along
with most of the other of New York's team, indeed
had nowhere to go but up. The only thing wrong
with this Broadway-provided omen was that No
where went nowhere and closed after nine per
formances.
But even though there has been nothing spec
tacular forthcoming, Columbia does seem to be
making a bid to move upward; at least a little. In
their first three games the Lions equalled last
season’s victory record by beating CCNY, Colgate
and Williams, causing some to hope that they
j might be the sleepers of the year.
But an initial loss to Rufgers, which was joined
by a few more, including an .80-70 Ivy League con
test with Cornell, showed that if Columbia is New
York’s sleeper team of the year they snore a lot.
THK LIONS PLAY in a gym which makes the
! Stanford Pavilion look like a combination of Sol
j diet ’s Field and the Taj Mahal. Temporary bleach-
I ers behind two rows of folding chairs which the
j spectator negotiates like a tight-rope provide the
only seating.
The fan (the cluck. Mark Harris would say) is
I virtually indistinguishable from his Western
j counterpart and so is the referee. When things get
1 dull on the floor these two species can be counted
I upon for entertainment. “Traveling,” shrieks the
j ref, his face crimson and his hands circling each

other epileptically. “You’re ugly, ref," complains
the fan. And so it goes.
The style of play here ensures high scoring.
When you get the ball you shoot it and if you miss
you shoot it again. Sooner or later, the strategy
runs, it will go in. With this emphasis even the
poorer teams have their share of good outside
shooters. It's all for the best, though, because
most of them have more trouble getting inside
than Adlai Stevenson.
BUT WHEN the outside shooting gets hot it's
every man for himself. Behind Colgate 29 24 with
five minutes left in the half, some of the boys with
the liking for the long ones started prompting
each other and the intermission score read 41-29
with Columbia in front. In the second half things
cooled off but those five minutes gave the Lions
the wherewithal for a TS-t>7 win.
The best of Columbia’s sharpshooters is a soph
omore guard named Neil Father. He averages
about 19 points a game, mostly on .jump shots
from 15 feet or more. Against Lehigh the other
night Farber threw in 25 points, 19 in the second
half.
But he that as it may there are no titles in
Columbia’s future this year and the purist must
turn elsewhere. Say to high schools in Nassau
County out in the wilds of Long Island.
ST. AGNES had led Malverne all the way and
was ahead 6(5-62 with six seconds left. A free threw
by a gentleman named Wandy Williams brought
Malverne a point closer and then, after Williams
missed another foul shot, a teammate grabbed the
ball and shoved it through, 66-65.
St. Agnes took the ball. but. while being
swarmed upon, a St. Agnes man panicked and
called time out. Two seconds left. A St. Agnes
player threw it in hounds the length of the court
as the buzzer rang and fans swarmed on the court.
But the ball had hit the low ceiling and the referee
ordered the clock back to two seconds. Malverne’s
ball. In to Williams who shoots and misses. St.
Agnes wins.
Two weeks later the same teams played again,
this lime with Malverne winning by a point. You
can guess who came up with a three-point play in
the last four seconds to win it.
NEW YORK The basketball fan located in
Manhattan for the duration may have been in
trigued by an article in the theater section of a
New York daily a while ago. (This back in those
antediluvian days when there were newspapers
here. I A new musical comedy entitled “Nowhere
To Go But Up” had just opened and the impulse
to regard it as the theme for the local collegiate
basketball situation was hard to resist.
