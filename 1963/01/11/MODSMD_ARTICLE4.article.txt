# Knoles Lauds Man’s Mind In 'Last Lecture’ Series'

In man’s mine) is the solution
to the problems of modern soci
ety, said Dr. George Knoles in a
talk, “Play the Man,” at Tresid
der yesterday. Rapid technologi
cal progress has created a society
largely composed of men with
specialized knowledge who are
too well-adjusted, too “machine
like”; men should participate in
the community as whole beings,
not as mechanisms,, he said.
Science as a solution fails to
satisfy man, Knoles explained,
using atomic energy as an ex
ample: today, in one explosion
man can release energy equal to
the total of what all men before
him have released, yet he still
feels a sense of frustration and
defeat.
JUST AS MAN should not look
to science to answer the question
of the purpose of his existence,
so he should not “rely on the sav
ing grace of a transcending pur
pose or predestined end.” Knoles
continued. Instead, he should turn
to his own resources.
These resources include "man’s

ability to transcend his environ
ment and be what he dreams to
be,” and his “unconquerable
mind,” he said. They offer an al
ternative to the threat of sub
mersion within the group that
has concerned many contempo
rary writers.
He described this problem mod
ern man faces as a conflict be
tween the philosophical tradition
that emphasizes science and
“tends to reduce the human per
sonality to an instrument to be
used,” and the humanistic view
that emphasized the human being
as an individual.
The first duty of the profes
sor, Knoles said, is “to teach you
that you are a man and what an
august thing it is.” With this
knowledge, the humanistic view
as a solution is encouraged.
