# 'Stevenson Well Qualified to Speak at Stanford U.N.'
## 
### ROY SCHMIDT Contributing Editor 
Adlai Stevenson, a man who
has spent most of his 62 years in
public life with a particular
wealth of experience in interna
tional affairs, may well he the
most appropriate speaker the HR
could have found for the Stanford
United Nations.
Ambassador Stevenson’s ea
reer in foreign affairs stretches
from 1943 when he headed an eco
nomic administration mission to

Italy, to, the present day which
finds him beginning his third
year as the U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations. In that posi
tion Stevenson has spent a great
deal of time in Washington as
well as New York, helping to
shape U.S. foreign policy. His
work in the U.N. itself has won
the commendation of members of
both parties.
STEVENSON first became a
prominent figure of the public
scene In 1941 when he was named
assistant secretary of the Navy.
In 1945 he was appointed assist
ant secretary of state and at
tended the United Nations Con
ference on International Organi
zation in San Francisco as an ad
viser. He was moved up to senior
adviser to the delegatiton in 1916
and was soon after named to rep
resent the U.S. in the General
Assembly.
Stevenson returned to his home
state of Illinois to run for gover
nor in 1948 and was elected by
the largest margin ever recorded
in that state. But that stunning
victory was followed by his two
rather discouraging losses to for
mer-President Dwight Eisenhow
er in 1952 and 1956.
When President Kennedy was
elected in 1960, Stevenson seemed
to be an obvious choice lor secre
tary-of-state, and the President’s
failure to make that appointment
left many people speculating
about possible bitterness between
them arising from political differ
ences.
KENNEDY' might have been
thinking back to the Democratic
National Convention of 1956.
I speculators offered. In that con

vention it was Senator John Ken
nedy who placed Stevenson’s
name in nomination. At the time
it was believed that the junior
senator had Stevenson’s support
for the vice-presidential nomina
tion. But when Stevenson insisted
on an open nomination, Kennedy
was narrowly defeated by Estes
Kofauver.
The two seemed to be at odds
again in 1960 when they appeared
to be the two leading candidates
for the Democratic nomination.
Stevenson had a large personal
following hut refused to declare
candidacy himself or to come out
in favor of Kennedy.
Columnists are still exploiting
the idea of a split between Steven
son and the President. Recently
a Saturday Evening Post article
by Charles Barttlett and Joseph
Alsop on the Cuban crises quoted
“a source” as saying that Steven
son was ready to give up U.S.
bases in Turkey, Italy, and Brit
ain if the Soviets would remove
their missiles from Cuba.
THIS LED many to believe (hat
the story was a deliberate “news
leak” and that it meant that the
administration was preparing to
dump Stevenson as it had Ches
ter Bowles. Stevenson denied that
ho had ever proposed such a plan.
Stevenson’s articulate manner
and proficiency in writing and
speech making make him a fre
quently-quoted statesman. The
following statements were all
made by him within the last two
years and suggest something of
his position on some of the key
questions he faces In the U.N.
ON THE WOULD SITUATION:
“To me the two most dangerous

I realities we now face arc the
multiplication of nuclear weapons
and disparity of living standards
between the rich nations and the
poor.”
on i;m>i;ic o i-; vi;i.o p k d
COUNTRIES: “We arc faced
with an unprecedented challenge.
II is true that poverty, ignorance,
and disease have plagued man
kind since the beginning of re
corded history and probably be
yond that. Bui we face the chal
lenge now because, for the first
time, we have the means for do
ing away with these ancient
scourges of humanity. The job
we face is nothing less than (lie
development and execution of a
I grand strategy for world
growth.”
ON Tin: ( OLD WAR; “There
can be no peace unless there is
mutual tolerance between differ
htg peoples, systems, and cultures
. . . for it is in our acceptance
of variety and differences, har
monized but not suppressed, that
wo in our turn work not only
with the trend of history but in
accord with the ingrained diver
sity of mankind. Our faith is that
in the long contest the lotalitari
ans will gradually be converted
to our way of thinking rather
than we to theirs. Our goal is not
just to win a cold war, but to per
suade a cold world.”
ON U.S. FOREIGN POLICY:
“The beginning of wisdom in I lie
West is to have our own policy
not just a negative policy to stop
the communists but a creative
one that reflects our own vision
of a viable world society and our
own understanding of the revolu
tions through which we live.”
