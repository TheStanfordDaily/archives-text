# 'Visual Arts With Music' New Exhibit Series On Display in Tresidder Union Showcase
## 
### BETSY WRIGHT 
From Jan. 7 to Jan. 20. the
Tresidder showcases are display
ing examples of the “Visual Arts
with Music.” This series of ex
hibits seeks to show the ways in
which the visual arts and music
complement and in inspire one
another.
The display includes actual in
struments, manuscripts, engrav
ings, sketches, and a special fea
ture depicting the social environ
ment for the arts in the reign of
France’s Louis XIV.
The symbol is a “graphic repro
duction of the moment when mu
sical sound and visual beauty
demonstrate fusion.” It is the
swirling sound eddy from the
edge tone of a flute produced in
smoke.
In the 18th and 19th centuries
| musical instruments were deco-
I rated lavishly. Tresidder’s exhibit
1 contains pictures of some of these

intricate horns and rare instru
ments, but there are also two ac
tual examples, a violin and a
mandolin. The mandolin, dated
i 1789, is richly inlaid with Mother
j of-Pearl. The 19th century violin
has a scroll in the form of a hu
man head. On the back, in wood
inlays, is a view of the city of
Paris. Around the ribs of the in
strument is a Latin inscription.
One manuscript on display
shows the music for ceremonial
court dances of (ho Burgundian
culture of the 15th and 16th cen
turies. The colorful manuscript
gives the music in silver, the text
below in gold, and the dance steps
in silver.
Louis XIV reigned during the
late French Baroque period. He
encouraged development of the
arts to add to the glory of his
reign. Music, ballet, and painting
all focused on glorifying the king,
who was often allegorically per
-1 sonified as the hero.

Cameron, is part of the Visual Arts with Music exhibit currently on
display at Tresidder Memorial Union.

ing examples of the “Visual Arts

another.

France’s Louis XIV.

duction of the moment when mu
sical sound and visual beauty
demonstrate fusion.” It is the
swirling sound eddy from the
edge tone of a flute produced in
smoke.

intricate horns and rare instru
ments, but there are also two ac
tual examples, a violin and a
mandolin. The mandolin, dated
i 1789, is richly inlaid with Mother
j of-Pearl. The 19th century violin
has a scroll in the form of a hu
man head. On the back, in wood
inlays, is a view of the city of
Paris. Around the ribs of the in
strument is a Latin inscription.
