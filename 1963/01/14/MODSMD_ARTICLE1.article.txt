United Press Internal iuiuil

ACCRA. Ghana Political and military rebels overthrew the
government of neighboring Togo yesterday, shot and killed Presi
dent Sylvanus Olympic. 60, and dumped his body in front of the
U.S. Embassy.
Olympic, who visited President Kennedy last March and received
a tickertape parade down Broadway in New York, was reported
trying to take* refuge at the embassy when he was shot three times
by former members of the colonial infantry.
Members of his government were reported under arrest or
hiding.
A broadcast from the Togo capital of Lome said Antoine Me
atchi, a long-time foe of Olympic accused of participating in three
previous assassination attempts, had taken over the presidency.
Meal chi is the leader of the opposition party banned by Olympic.
Travelers reaching Here Sunday from Lome said the revolt began
at 11 o’clock Saturday night. They said Olympic was warned of the
trouble by Interior Minister Theophile Mally and escaped from his
house to the U.S. Embassy garden.
They said he hid in the garden during the night but the soldiers
tracked him down this morning, shot him and threw his body on the
embassy steps. There was no explanation why he remained in the
garden instead of trying to get in the embassy.
JFK TO TELL STATE OF THE UNION—WASHINGTON--Presi
dent Kennedy is expected to tell Congress in his State of the Union
message today that spending for defense and the U.S. man-in-moon
project will increase this year.
Advance word was that the President, delivering his address
before a joint session of the House and Senate, would attach great
significance to this country’s effort to put an astronaut on the moon
by 1970 at least.
Kennedy will follow up his State of the Union address by sending
to Congress Thursday a budget for the fiscal year starting July 1.
It is expected to call for record spending of about $99.5 billion.
The general tone of the State of the Union message was expected
to be one of measured optimism. The President’s legislative pro
posals probably will be no more controversial than those submitted
last year, chiefly because the President sees no major change in the
composition of Congress.
KATANGANS THREATEN TO HANG TSHOMBE ELISABETH
VILLE, Katanga, The Congo Elisabethville businessmen said yester
day President Moise Tshombe had flown to Kolwezi and that they
would go there to threaten him with hanging if he blew up the mines
and power dams there.
Tshombe fled across the border Friday night into Northern
Rhodesia to escape arrest by Central Congolese army officers, but
now faced two new threats—that of hanging and a military drive on
his Kolwezi stronghold by United Nations forces.
Informed sources said U.N. troops should be ready within a
week for a final push against Kolwezi. 150 miles northwest of
Elisabethville. They said another appeal would be made to Tshombe
to surrender it.
Elisabethville businessmen said they plan to go to Kolwezi to
warn Tshombe he may hang as a common criminal if he carries out
his scorched earth policy. A delegation headed by Katanga National
Bank Director Andre van Roeys may fly there for a meeting with
Tshombe to appeal to him to surrender.
