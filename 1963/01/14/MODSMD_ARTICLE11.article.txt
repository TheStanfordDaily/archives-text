Editor, The Daily:
In response to William Reppy’s
article in Friday’s Daily that
“anti-fraternity forces at Stan
ford are at work again,” I resent
any implications that the IFC
which endorsed the proposal be
fore Mr. Reppy’s article and with
fraternity interests in mind he
considered an “anti-fraternity
force.”
With an extended program, the
proposal attempts to resolve a
complaint of fraternities and of
freshman living group represent
atives in the past that both
freshmen and fraternities tend to
be superficial during rush. For
the first time, careful and infor
mal review of rushees would al
low each fraternity to select
freshmen who would fit into a
pledge class of the character each
house predesignates. In the past,
first impressions have often been
the sole criteria for selecting
pledges from a freshman class
whose members each year are
told that they have more charac
ter, more academic and extra
curricular potential than students
of previous years. Is this fair to
freshmen?
The informal commitment al
lows freshmen to think before
pledging, which assures frater
nity men that those who formally
pledge truly want to live in their
house.

Expenses incurred by fraterni
ties should he "less” than before
under the “longer” program. Con
tact with freshmen at meals (to
be resolved, in part, by IFC later
in Winter Quarter) and off-cam
pus would be more restricted, re
ducing expenses, relieving pres
sures put on social chairman,
eliminating compulsory attend
ance by fraternity men at addi
tional spring parties, while giving
fraternity men additional time to
study.
Consider too, that only about
one-half the freshman men pledge
themselves to fraternities and to
their intensive spring social pro
grams under the present system.
Under the new proposal, the re
maining half, whom Mr. Reppy
may think “not as fortunate,” will
see more of their freshman
friends and may find that their
living groups will have time to
provide social programs for them,
too.

force.”
With an extended program, the
proposal attempts to resolve a
complaint of fraternities and of
freshman living group represent
atives in the past that both
freshmen and fraternities tend to
be superficial during rush. For
the first time, careful and infor
mal review of rushees would al
low each fraternity to select
freshmen who would fit into a
pledge class of the character each
house predesignates. In the past,
first impressions have often been
the sole criteria for selecting
pledges from a freshman class
whose members each year are
told that they have more charac
ter, more academic and extra
curricular potential than students
of previous years. Is this fair to
freshmen?
The informal commitment al
lows freshmen to think before
pledging, which assures frater
nity men that those who formally
pledge truly want to live in their
house.

Expenses incurred by fraterni
ties should he "less” than before
under the “longer” program. Con
tact with freshmen at meals (to
be resolved, in part, by IFC later
in Winter Quarter) and off-cam
pus would be more restricted, re
ducing expenses, relieving pres
sures put on social chairman,
eliminating compulsory attend
ance by fraternity men at addi
tional spring parties, while giving
fraternity men additional time to
study.
Consider too, that only about
one-half the freshman men pledge
themselves to fraternities and to
their intensive spring social pro
grams under the present system.
Under the new proposal, the re
maining half, whom Mr. Reppy
may think “not as fortunate,” will
see more of their freshman
friends and may find that their
living groups will have time to
provide social programs for them,
too.

Editor, The Daily:
In response to William Reppy’s
article in Friday’s Daily that
“anti-fraternity forces at Stan
ford are at work again,” I resent
any implications that the IFC
which endorsed the proposal be
fore Mr. Reppy’s article and with
fraternity interests in mind he
considered an “anti-fraternity
force.”
