## 'Changed Rush Would Solve Some Current Problems' 
### JOHN STEINBRUNER Head Wilbur Sponsor 
It has been recognized for a number of years that the fraternity
rush policy has major effects on the other undergraduate men’s
residence systems. At Wilbur and Stern, rush and implicated
events have constituted the predominant fact of Spring Quarter
and have presented situations uncontrollable by those who hold

responsibility for the programs.t
The eating club rush regulations
have presented on paper an en
tirely different system of rush,
but the clubs ,have in practice
chosen largely to follow the fra
ternity pattern.
It requires only an enumera
tion of detail to discover that the
implications of the system of
rush are extensive throughout
these four parts of the campus.
In addition, the rush system has
come increasingly under scrutiny
in recent years as general dis
satisfaction has consolidated.
Last year the IFC voted explicit
dissatisfaction with the system
that is now in effect, and it is no
secret that such feelings are
shared in Wilbur and Stern.
GIVEN THE need for change,
therefore, and the widespread ef
fects of any rush policy, it seemed
only natural that all the groups
affected should join in a propos
al for a new policy. To this pur
pose a committee was established
by the joint action of the Dean of
Men and the ASSU President,
consisting of the people who have
signed the new proposal.
In order for the proposal to
make any sense at all, it must be
viewed with the entire men’s pro
gram in mind. The “ideal” sys
tems which were suggested by
each of the representatives in
volved were quite inconsistent
and each faced the necessity of
extensive compromise while still
maintaining those features which
were essential to the needs of his
respective part of the campus.
The proposal appears quite weak
if criticized from the viewpoint
of any one interest group alone.
Mr. Wessell in his editorial has
criticized it as an eating club
member and Mr. Reppy as a fra
ternity member. Both are quite
right in asserting that it is not
all they would desire for their
respective groups, but neither has
faced the fact that the implica
tions of rush policies are campus
wide. Mr. Reppy’s comments are
a classic illustration of why the
old system was inadequate and
why no single group would be
able to remedy it.
HE EXPRESSES the conserva
tive fraternity opinion that any
proposed change is “anti-fraterni
ty,” and he sees the whole issue
as one of insuring the conveni
ence of those who pledge a fra
ternity. (The IFC has taken, in
cidentally, a much more far
sighted view and they have been
the major force to improve the
system). Mr. Wessell is anxious
to insure that the eating club
rush is carried on under optimum
conditions. Neither has confront
ed the complex of problems asso
ciated with those who are re
jected by both selective systems
as well as those who choose a
third alternative.
The new proposal does not at
tempt to solve the problem of
people being hurt because of re
jection or the problem of disrup
tion in the Wilbur and Stern
house systems. These difficulties
are serious; but as in the past,
they will have to be met by the
individuals and groups involved,
not by an all-campus rush policy.
The new proposal attempts
first of all to provide a reasonable
system of selection, maximizing
the information available to the
potential initiate and minimizing

4-
1 the pressures on the individuals
of hoth sides. The conditions have
been set to gradually move away
from the intensive, one-week peri
[od in which rush was predomi
i nafely social in nature and con
ducted away from the campus.
IT IS HOPED that other as
pects of the living groups will be
increasingly explored by the
freshman, and that he will have
j more time, more knowledge, and
less pressure in his decision.
| These are the considerations be
! hind the longer period. In addi
| tion, it is believed that the in
• creased contact between fresh
! men and upperclassmen will con
jstitute somewhat of an improve
ment of the general campus at
mosphere.
To the greatest extent possible,
the fundamental interests of the
rushing groups—the fraternities,
the Clubs, and, to a certain ex
tent Stern—have been guaran
i teed. It is to be noted, for ex
ample, that a single-week concen
tration would still be quite pos
sible if deemed desirable by any
house, club, the IFC or ICC. The
conditions would be set for an ex
tension but not dictated.
One change that would be im
posed, however, is the nature of
the relationship between a given
house and a person who commit
ted himself to it substantially be
fore the point of official pledging
in the seventh week of Spring
Quarter. This of course is the
period now given to pledge train
ing. It was felt that the elimina
tion of pledge dinners, projects,
sneaks, meetings, and the learn
ing of pledge manuals during this
time would not constitute a ma
jor disruption in either the fra
ternity or club systems. The ma
jor “integration” of the pledge
into the living group consists in
getting to know the members and
other pledges, and this is quite
compatible with his being related
to the house and the other pro
spective pledges in an informal,
unstructural way.
THE PRIMARY reason for this
change is to maintain the integri
ty of the freshman residences as
living groups. The situation as it
now stands gives the distinct im
pression of having the “most de
sirable” freshmen selected out.
leaving the others to a “lesser”
fate. The freshmen who pledge
develop an extensive affiliation to
an outside group (which is foster
ed by that group to the greatest
extent possible) but continue to
live in Wilbur or Stern.
This, contrary to the Universi
ty’s design, reduces Wilbur es
pecially to a hotel or half-way
station, which is an abrupt
change from the first two quar
ters. More importantly, it dis
rupts the interpersonal relation
ships (between roommates, etc.)
which arise quite desirably as a
function of geographical proximi
ty throughou the first two quar
ters.
THERE CAN be assertion and
counter-assertion as to what will
happen if this proposal is enacted.
In the judgment of the authors,
in consultation with the Dean’s
office and various advisors, the
system would clear up some of
the problems which have existed
in the past and would create no
serious new ones. It is hoped that
the proposal will be enacted to
determine whether the anticipat
ed improvement will in fact oc
cur. If not, something else can
always be tried.
