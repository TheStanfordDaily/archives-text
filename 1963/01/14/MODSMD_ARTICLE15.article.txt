Editor, The Daily;
Walter Lippmann in his column
of January 9, states that Chris
tian Democrat-Social Democrat ;
coalitions are “the only visible al- i
tentative to a Gaullist Europe.”
He is missing a much better alter
native which has been visible
since Clarence Streit wrote "Un
ion Now” in 1939; it has been
steadily gaining support since
then and still is the best available
solution to the problem posed in
Mr. Lippmann’s column, and to
many other problems. This alter
native is the union of (he leading
free nations in a federal republic
like the union of the thirteen
American states established in
1789. The founding states would
be the United States, Canada,
Great Britain, and most of the
nations of Western Europe; other
free nations would be admitted
as states later.
The experience and success of
the United States, Great Britain,
and Canada with two-party sys
tems would help establish a sta
ble one through the Union; as
Mr. Lippmann indicates, a stable
two-party system is the best ar
rangement of political parties in
a free nation. The many other
benefits from such a Union would
include solutions of the problems
of Westeim unity indicated in Mr.
Lippmann’s two succeeding -col
umns; the leading free nations as
a Union could take concerted ac
tion much more effectively and
quickly than they can as separate
nations.
Douglass Morris
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct some of
the false impressions created by
William Reppy’s article concern
ing the new rush proposal which
appeared in last Friday’s Daily.
This article clearly misinterpret
ed three aspects of the proposal,
and in addition, predicted as cer
tain two consequences of the pro
posal which are anything but cer
tain.
The core of Mr. Reppy's dissat
isfaction seems to rest on the
stipulation that no rushee may
make a formal commitment to
any living group until the seventh
week of spring quarter. The
rushee is not prevented, though,
as Mr. Reppy states, from decid
ing which group he would pre
fer. Once he has decided to accept
(however informally) the bid
from one or another of the living
groups, rush is over for him.
What is the difference to the pro
spective pledge whether he signs
his pledge card the second week
of the quarter or the seventh?
Mr. Reppy is incorrect in say
ing that the proposal prohibits
a prospective pledge from bring
ing a friend to the fraternity
house and promoting him as a
rushee. Spring quarter the fresh
man is only prohibited from con
tact at the fraternity house dur
ing meals. At any other time he,
and his friend, would have the
same freedom to visit (he house
that was available during winter
quarter.
As far as the prospective
pledges getting to know each
other Spring quarter (if this is
so important), there is certainly
nothing in the proposal which
keeps them from doing so. They
are only freed from the possible
obligation of having to attend for
mal (compulsory and/or instruc
tional) pledge class meetings. I
imagine if the proposal is ap
proved, fraternities will encour
age. probably with IFC’s blessing,
that the prospective pledges oc
casionally call on one another.
Mr. Reppy seems certain that
the period between formal rush
and the seventh week of Spring
quarter will extend rush, making
it unduly expensive and time con
suming. In the past rush has been
completed in less than a week.
Under the present proposal fra
ternities would have approximate
ly the same amount of time for
formal rush plus many weeks of
relaxed contact in the winter. I
think it is reasonable to expect
that the fraternities will not need
additional time to fill their pledge
classes.
Mr. Reppy maintains that
Spring quarter GPA’s, normally
lower than fall and winter, will
drop even lower if the proposal
is put into effect. I can find no
evidence to support this. Quite to
the contrary, it appears that by
minimizing formal class activi
ties, GPA’s might actually rise,
especially for the prospective
pledge who would otherwise be
expected to participate in the ac
tivities.

(Editor’s note: If Mr. Reppy
had said “that the proposal pro
hibits a prospective pledge from
bringing a friend to the fraternity
house and promoting him as a
rushee,” then he would have been
wrong on that point. Mr. Reppy,
in fact, wrote that “the proposal
prohibits ... at this time ...”
meaning at meal time.)

Mr. Reppy maintains that
Spring quarter GPA’s, normally
lower than fall and winter, will
drop even lower if the proposal
is put into effect. I can find no
evidence to support this. Quite to
the contrary, it appears that by
minimizing formal class activi
ties, GPA’s might actually rise,
especially for the prospective
pledge who would otherwise be
expected to participate in the ac
tivities.

had said “that the proposal pro
hibits a prospective pledge from
bringing a friend to the fraternity
house and promoting him as a

wrong on that point. Mr. Reppy,
in fact, wrote that “the proposal

Editor, The Daily;
Walter Lippmann in his column
of January 9, states that Chris
tian Democrat-Social Democrat ;
coalitions are “the only visible al- i
tentative to a Gaullist Europe.”
He is missing a much better alter
native which has been visible
since Clarence Streit wrote "Un
ion Now” in 1939; it has been
steadily gaining support since
then and still is the best available
solution to the problem posed in
Mr. Lippmann’s column, and to
many other problems. This alter
native is the union of (he leading
free nations in a federal republic
like the union of the thirteen
American states established in
1789. The founding states would
be the United States, Canada,
Great Britain, and most of the
nations of Western Europe; other
free nations would be admitted
as states later.
The experience and success of
the United States, Great Britain,
and Canada with two-party sys
tems would help establish a sta
ble one through the Union; as
Mr. Lippmann indicates, a stable
two-party system is the best ar
rangement of political parties in
a free nation. The many other
benefits from such a Union would
include solutions of the problems
of Westeim unity indicated in Mr.
Lippmann’s two succeeding -col
umns; the leading free nations as
a Union could take concerted ac
tion much more effectively and
quickly than they can as separate
nations.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct some of
the false impressions created by
William Reppy’s article concern
ing the new rush proposal which
appeared in last Friday’s Daily.
This article clearly misinterpret
ed three aspects of the proposal,
and in addition, predicted as cer
tain two consequences of the pro
posal which are anything but cer
tain.
The core of Mr. Reppy's dissat
isfaction seems to rest on the
stipulation that no rushee may
make a formal commitment to
any living group until the seventh
week of spring quarter. The
rushee is not prevented, though,
as Mr. Reppy states, from decid
ing which group he would pre
fer. Once he has decided to accept
(however informally) the bid
from one or another of the living
groups, rush is over for him.
What is the difference to the pro
spective pledge whether he signs
his pledge card the second week
of the quarter or the seventh?
Mr. Reppy is incorrect in say
ing that the proposal prohibits
a prospective pledge from bring
ing a friend to the fraternity
house and promoting him as a
rushee. Spring quarter the fresh
man is only prohibited from con
tact at the fraternity house dur
ing meals. At any other time he,
and his friend, would have the
same freedom to visit (he house
that was available during winter
quarter.
As far as the prospective
pledges getting to know each
other Spring quarter (if this is
so important), there is certainly
nothing in the proposal which
keeps them from doing so. They
are only freed from the possible
obligation of having to attend for
mal (compulsory and/or instruc
tional) pledge class meetings. I
imagine if the proposal is ap
proved, fraternities will encour
age. probably with IFC’s blessing,
that the prospective pledges oc
casionally call on one another.
Mr. Reppy seems certain that
the period between formal rush
and the seventh week of Spring
quarter will extend rush, making
it unduly expensive and time con
suming. In the past rush has been
completed in less than a week.
Under the present proposal fra
ternities would have approximate
ly the same amount of time for
formal rush plus many weeks of
relaxed contact in the winter. I
think it is reasonable to expect
that the fraternities will not need
additional time to fill their pledge
classes.

are only freed from the possible
obligation of having to attend for
mal (compulsory and/or instruc
tional) pledge class meetings. I
imagine if the proposal is ap
proved, fraternities will encour
age. probably with IFC’s blessing,
that the prospective pledges oc
casionally call on one another.
Mr. Reppy seems certain that
the period between formal rush
and the seventh week of Spring
quarter will extend rush, making
it unduly expensive and time con
suming. In the past rush has been
completed in less than a week.
Under the present proposal fra
ternities would have approximate
ly the same amount of time for
formal rush plus many weeks of
relaxed contact in the winter. I
think it is reasonable to expect
that the fraternities will not need
additional time to fill their pledge
classes.
Mr. Reppy maintains that
Spring quarter GPA’s, normally
lower than fall and winter, will
drop even lower if the proposal
is put into effect. I can find no
evidence to support this. Quite to
the contrary, it appears that by
minimizing formal class activi
ties, GPA’s might actually rise,
especially for the prospective
pledge who would otherwise be
expected to participate in the ac
tivities.

(Editor’s note: If Mr. Reppy
had said “that the proposal pro
hibits a prospective pledge from
bringing a friend to the fraternity
house and promoting him as a
rushee,” then he would have been
wrong on that point. Mr. Reppy,
in fact, wrote that “the proposal
prohibits ... at this time ...”
meaning at meal time.)
Editor, The Daily;
Walter Lippmann in his column
of January 9, states that Chris
tian Democrat-Social Democrat ;
coalitions are “the only visible al- i
tentative to a Gaullist Europe.”
He is missing a much better alter
native which has been visible
since Clarence Streit wrote "Un
ion Now” in 1939; it has been
steadily gaining support since
then and still is the best available
solution to the problem posed in
Mr. Lippmann’s column, and to
many other problems. This alter
native is the union of (he leading
free nations in a federal republic
like the union of the thirteen
American states established in
1789. The founding states would
be the United States, Canada,
Great Britain, and most of the
nations of Western Europe; other
free nations would be admitted
as states later.
The experience and success of
the United States, Great Britain,
and Canada with two-party sys
tems would help establish a sta
ble one through the Union; as
Mr. Lippmann indicates, a stable
two-party system is the best ar
rangement of political parties in
a free nation. The many other
benefits from such a Union would
include solutions of the problems
of Westeim unity indicated in Mr.
Lippmann’s two succeeding -col
umns; the leading free nations as
a Union could take concerted ac
tion much more effectively and
quickly than they can as separate
nations.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct some of
the false impressions created by
William Reppy’s article concern
ing the new rush proposal which
appeared in last Friday’s Daily.
This article clearly misinterpret
ed three aspects of the proposal,
and in addition, predicted as cer
tain two consequences of the pro
posal which are anything but cer
tain.
The core of Mr. Reppy's dissat
isfaction seems to rest on the
stipulation that no rushee may
make a formal commitment to
any living group until the seventh
week of spring quarter. The
rushee is not prevented, though,
as Mr. Reppy states, from decid
ing which group he would pre
fer. Once he has decided to accept
(however informally) the bid
from one or another of the living
groups, rush is over for him.
What is the difference to the pro
spective pledge whether he signs
his pledge card the second week
of the quarter or the seventh?
Mr. Reppy is incorrect in say
ing that the proposal prohibits
a prospective pledge from bring
ing a friend to the fraternity
house and promoting him as a
rushee. Spring quarter the fresh
man is only prohibited from con
tact at the fraternity house dur
ing meals. At any other time he,
and his friend, would have the
same freedom to visit (he house
that was available during winter
quarter.
As far as the prospective
pledges getting to know each
other Spring quarter (if this is
so important), there is certainly
nothing in the proposal which
keeps them from doing so. They
are only freed from the possible
obligation of having to attend for
mal (compulsory and/or instruc
tional) pledge class meetings. I
imagine if the proposal is ap
