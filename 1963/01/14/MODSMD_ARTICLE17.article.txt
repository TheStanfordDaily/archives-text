The Stanford freshman basket
ball team split their weekend
games, trouncing Santa Clara 75-
55 after falling to the University
of San Francisco 59-47. In both
contests the Tribe was led by the
amazing shooting accuracy of
guard Skip Hutchison.
Against San Francisco Friday
night the frosh got off to a horri
ble start, tallying only two points
in the first seven minutes. Hutch
ison and forward Bob Bedell fi
nally began to connect, and Stan
ford tied the score at 12-12 with
six minutes remaining in the half.
The Dons fought back, paced by
outside shooting by Russ Gumina
and rebounding by Erwin Muel
ler, and led at half-time by a 24-21
margin.

In the second half USF slowly
began to pull away, but Hutchi
son kept Stanford close with a
brilliant shooting display, hitting
five shots in a row from the 20-

foot area. With 8:35 remaining in
the game, the frosh trailed by
only 40-35. At this point USF for
ward Joe Ellis, who had been
stilled most of the game, began
to get hot, hitting three impor
tant field goals. With three min
utes to play the Dons held a com

manrling 55-45 lead, and they held
on easily for the 59-47 victory.
HUTCHISON led all scorers
with 21 points, hitting on 10 of
15 field goad attempts. Dick Muel
ler led USF with 15 markers, fol
lowed by Russ Gumina’s 14 and
Ellis' 12.
The following night against
Santa Clara, Hutchison again led
Stanford’s attack, but this time
he had help. Bob Bedel] and

George Maentz connected early in
the game. The Tribe rolled to a
big lead before putting in the sec
ond string with 13 minutes to go
in the half. With 6’7” reserve cen
ter Rich Baker leading the at
tack, the frosh preserved a 31-26
lead at half time.

The Broncos narrowed the gap
to one point several times early
in the second half. Mike Unrein.
Tom Bender, and Walt Cardinet
sparked the Santa Clara rally.
With 11 minutes remaining in
the game, Stanford took com
mand of the game. Bob Bedell
turned in the key play, hitting a
twisting jumper in close and
drawing a foul for the three-point
play. Then Hutchison started to
hit his deadly jump shot, and
Santa Clara’s hopes for victory
wore gone.

Hutchison finished the game
with 22 points, again capturing
high point honors. Bob Bedell tal
lied 16 points, contributing great
ly to the 75-55 victory. The win
left the Indians with a 3-2 mark
