# Dallmar's Strategy
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
was a glum man Friday night aft
er Oregon State had finally won
a nip and tuck contest, 65-58, be
tween perhaps the two top teams
on the West Coast.
“Tomorrow night we’re going
to give Counts (Mel) his 20-25
points and pay more attention to
the others,” he planned. He was
disappointed with the way the
Indians had concentrated on stop
ping OSU’s 7-1, 21 points-per
game center and consequently
had neglected the other Beavers.
Counts was held to ten points but
he haft three teammates in double
figures. Dallmar was also con
cerned about Stanford’s excessive
total of ball control errors, 15,
and hoped to slow down the pace
the next night.
However, it didn’t much matter
what he had planned to do Satur
day (he Indians were unstoppa
ble regardless. They hit a dazzling
47.4 per cent of their field goal
attempts and missed only four of
28 free throws.
Counts, the backbone of OSIT’s
attack, fouled out with 11:44 left;
as it was, though, it took nearly
twenty minutes for him to get
his fifth foul. “Wo were going to
try to work on getting Counts out
of there in the second half.” said
Dallmar. “The pressure was on
him either to play Dose loose in
side or take a chance on fouling.
However, when they came out
with their full court press, we
had to go with our press offense
which sot up plenty of openings
but didn’t jeopardize Counts.”
THK ONLY sour note was the
loss of reserve center Craig Cor
des. An itinerant elbow caused
him a fractured frontal sinus
above the left eye. He will miss
next weekend’s set against Wash
ington. Hollis Moore, who didn’t
play last night, will also miss
those two games because of the
ankle he sprained Friday night
before the game. Due to the open
weekend on January 23-24, they
will miss only two games.
