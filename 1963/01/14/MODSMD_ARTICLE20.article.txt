points in the last minutes, and
linker and Peters six each in
Oregon State’s superhuman
stretch run. Stanford made nu
merous costly ball-handling mis

The weekend action proved
costly to Stanford, a team already
crippled by injuries, Cordes, who
played well on defense when Dose
tired or got in foul trouble,
caught an elbow in the forehead
Saturday that broke the frontal
lobe of his sinus cavity. He can’t
set foot on a basketball court for
two weeks. Hollis Moore sprained
an ankle Friday night in a pre

(Continued from Puff** One)
Frank Peters and Steve Pauly
look over. Pauly scored eight
points in the last minutes, and
linker and Peters six each in
Oregon State’s superhuman
stretch run. Stanford made nu
merous costly ball-handling mis
takes in the second half.

The weekend action proved
costly to Stanford, a team already
crippled by injuries, Cordes, who
played well on defense when Dose
tired or got in foul trouble,
caught an elbow in the forehead
Saturday that broke the frontal
lobe of his sinus cavity. He can’t
set foot on a basketball court for
two weeks. Hollis Moore sprained
an ankle Friday night in a pre
game drill and didn’t even suit up
for Saturday’s game. He is doubt
ful for next week’s games. How
ever, it is expected (hat he can
play against Washington.

STANFORD has already lost
Doug Clemelson with a broken
ankle and Mike Preislerwith torn
ligaments in his leg. Lew Shupe
has been recovering from a
sprained ankle.
The non-league games against
OSU left Stanford 1-0 in AAWU
play. Next week, second-place |
Washington (3-1» will face Stan- i
ford twice in the Pavilion (if j
Stanford can find five healthy!
players.)
