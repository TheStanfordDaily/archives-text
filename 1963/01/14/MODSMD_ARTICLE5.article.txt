# Stanford Edged 65-58 Friday, but Gets Beaver 96-69 Saturday Night

### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford split a pair of weekend basketball games with Oregon
State, but few people will say that the Beavers are better than
Stanford. The Cards lost a squeaker to the Beavers 65-58 Friday
night, but blasted OSU into orbit 96-69 in the Saturday tilt.
The 96-point total was a Stanford Pavilion record, the most

points ever scored against Oregon-*
State, and the second highest
point total in Stanford history.
Back in 1951, Stanford scored 103
against lowa State in an experi
mental contest.
The much heralded duel be
tween Tom Dose and OSU's Mol
Counts came out even. Counts got
10 points to Dose’s nine Friday
night, but set up many more bas
kets with his passing. Saturday,
Dose out-scored his seven-foot op
ponent 29-20, though he was out
rebounded 18-13.
But it was Dose who set the
pace. He was the aggressor. Even
when Stanford lost, he forced
Counts to shoot from the outside,
and held the State behemoth to
six points when he was guarding
him. And Dose played the best
basketball of his life in Stanford’s
win. He often broke past his tall
er foe and leaped over him for
easy layins. He hooked over him,
jumped over him, and in the end
Counts fouled out in a futile at
tempt to guard the Stanford All-
American candidate.

There was a secondary duel,
though not publicized as much
as the Dose-Counts battle, be
j tween the Beavers’ Terry Baker
and Don Clemetson. Clemetson
won that battle clearly. Though
| outscored Friday night while
| State was winning, Clemetson
I was most all of the Stanford of
fense, accumulating 21 points.
Baker played like a basketball
All-American with 25 points.
SATURDAY was all Clemet-

son’s. He scored 19 points, gath
ered five rebounds, and assisted
seven Stanford buckets. Baker
was held to 11 points by the ex
cellent defensive work of Bob
Sommers.
Though Stanford rolled to an
impressive win Saturday, the vic
tory was less decisive than the
28-point margin would indicate.
The Tribe had built up a fantas-
4l-14 lead but it was all down
hill until Counts fouled out. Stan
ford held a 53-39 halftime margin,
and at one time the Beavers cut
the advantage to 10.
When Counts fouled out Stan
ford led 65-54. Four minutes later
it was 76-54. Dose, freed from
Counts’ octopus defense, made
nine points in Stanford’s 11-point
spurt.
If it is said that Dose wrapped
up (ho contest with his closing
burst, then it must also be said
that Clemetson kept Stanford
from blowing the game complete
ly in the closing minutes of the
first half. When OSU was cutting
the huge Stanford lead in half,
the 6-1 guard made six straight
free throws to keep the Indians
out of trouble.
THE FRIDAY contest was just
one of those things. Except for
Baker’s shooting Oregon State
played poorly until nine minutes
were left in the game. Stanford
had moved out to a seemingly
comfortable lead, 52-45, on a Craig
Cordes hook shot.
At this point State’s Baker,
