# Many Respond to Union
## 
### 
Reactions to (he recreational
services offered by the new Tie
sidder Union are as varied as the
services themselves.
ON THE WHOM:, those ques
tioned felt that features such as
the howling alley and the brows
ing area were welcome additions;
and as one person said, “the pur
poses of these sections are some
not provided by other areas on
campus and are well suited to the
union area.”
Many, however, disliked the
crowded atmosphere, especially
in the games area. Included in
this area are the fourteen-lane
bowling alley and tables for pool
and table tennis. One suggestion
was that “the bowling alley
should be limited to Stanford stu
dents, faculty, and staff only.”
The Quiet Area includes a
browsing room containing a se
lection of books and also domes
tic and foreign newspapers and
magazines; there is also a collec
tion of recordings, ranging from
classical to folk singing, for en
joyment in the music listening
rooms. These two features are
much appreciated by many who

use them regularly. One person
remarked that they were “an ex
cellent addition to Stanford’s fa
cilities,” taut also suggested “a
more planned selection of hooks.”
In this area there arc also a
bridge and chess room and a pi
ano practice room.

BKSIDKS THK recreational
areas, the staff and student di
visions of Tresidder present, in
the upstairs area, a year-round
program which includes student
faculty discussions, musical per
formances, lectures, motion pic
tures; and displays of art.
