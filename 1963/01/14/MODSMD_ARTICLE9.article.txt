# Campus Reactions Vary To New Rush Proposal
## 
### PAGE EDWARDS Jr 
The new Joint Proposal for
Living Group .Selections now be
for President Sterling for adop
tion is being sheltered by some
campus factions and rejected by
others.

This fraternity rushing propos
al of open contact between frater
nity members and freshmen dur
ing winter quarter with an ex

tended commitment period in the
spring is, in general, satisfactory
to the freshmen.
HAROLD GILMAN of Arroyo
said that he did not know a great
deal about the proposal but that
it seemed to give the freshmen
l he advantage of knowing frater
nities and fraternity men better
before making a decision. R. M.
Schmidt of Cedro said that he did
not know anything about the new
proposal, and Pete Harris of Ju
nipero stated that he liked the
idea because the freshmen would
be given a better chance to see
the houses and the men in therm
The new proposal itself pro
vides for restricted contact dur
ing winter quarter between fresh
men and upperclassmen for the
purposes of rush. The contact
period will be subject to various
conditions: open contact on cam
pus only; no rushing contact in
Wilbur; also, no commitments
may be made by the freshmen to
upperclass living groups during
winter quarter.
During spring quarter the same
restricted contact applies, except
during Thursday night, Friday
and Saturday of the first week of
the quarter; and Saturday of the
third and fifth week off-campus
contact is allowed.
INDIVIDUALS may informally
pledge a house during spring
quarter, but no formal commit
ment can he made until Wednes
day of the seventh week when all
freshmen declare their living
groups for sophomore year.
No freshman will be considered
a member or pledge of any house
until a formal commitment is
made.
As to fraternity opinion, Steve
Boyers, Alpha Delta Phi presi
dent, terms the proposal a “nec
essary compromise.” Brad Free
man, rush chairman of the Beta
House, stated frankly that he did
not like the proposal.
FRIDAY afternoon Freeman
said he took a loiter opposing the
proposal to as many house presi
dents, rushing chairmen, and Wil
bur sponsors as he could find.
The letter, addressed to President
Sterling, was signed by approxi
mately 13 house presidents, 18
rush chairmen, and two sponsors,
Freeman said. “Rather than hav
ing one week of rush,” said Free
man. “we now will have 14.” He
suggests trying open contact dur
ing winter quarter for one year
and forgetting about the seven
weeks of informal commitments
in the spring.
A spokesman for the Chi Psi
house said that its members
“strongly disapproved” of the
proposal.
John Pyle, president of AKL,
said his house is somewhat divid
ed in their reactions. “Personal
ly,” said Pyle, “this needs to be
done.” He added that the seven
week wait for formal pledging
will not hurt the fraternities and
prevents the false front that exists
during the short rush we have
now. Jim Towne of the ATO
house stated that his house is not
excited about having open contact
but that it will be of some ad
vantage to the freshmen.
JIM HELTZEL, Junipero spon
sor, said that he personally likes
the proposal, for it will keep the
Wilbur housing system a cohesive
unit during spring quarter. Helt
zel also said that the additional
freshmen-fraternity contact will
assist the freshmen in making the
[ right choice of living group.
Word on the proposal’s accept-
I ance or rejection is expected from
the president’s office soon.

This fraternity rushing propos
al of open contact between frater
nity members and freshmen dur
ing winter quarter with an ex

tended commitment period in the
spring is, in general, satisfactory
to the freshmen.
HAROLD GILMAN of Arroyo
said that he did not know a great
deal about the proposal but that
it seemed to give the freshmen
l he advantage of knowing frater
nities and fraternity men better
before making a decision. R. M.
Schmidt of Cedro said that he did
not know anything about the new
proposal, and Pete Harris of Ju
nipero stated that he liked the
idea because the freshmen would
be given a better chance to see
the houses and the men in therm
The new proposal itself pro
vides for restricted contact dur
ing winter quarter between fresh
men and upperclassmen for the
purposes of rush. The contact
period will be subject to various
conditions: open contact on cam
pus only; no rushing contact in
Wilbur; also, no commitments
may be made by the freshmen to
upperclass living groups during
winter quarter.
During spring quarter the same
restricted contact applies, except
during Thursday night, Friday
and Saturday of the first week of
the quarter; and Saturday of the
third and fifth week off-campus
contact is allowed.
INDIVIDUALS may informally
pledge a house during spring
quarter, but no formal commit
ment can he made until Wednes
day of the seventh week when all
freshmen declare their living
groups for sophomore year.
No freshman will be considered
a member or pledge of any house
until a formal commitment is
made.
As to fraternity opinion, Steve
Boyers, Alpha Delta Phi presi
dent, terms the proposal a “nec
essary compromise.” Brad Free
man, rush chairman of the Beta
House, stated frankly that he did
not like the proposal.
FRIDAY afternoon Freeman
said he took a loiter opposing the
proposal to as many house presi
dents, rushing chairmen, and Wil
bur sponsors as he could find.
The letter, addressed to President
Sterling, was signed by approxi
mately 13 house presidents, 18
rush chairmen, and two sponsors,
Freeman said. “Rather than hav
ing one week of rush,” said Free
man. “we now will have 14.” He
suggests trying open contact dur
ing winter quarter for one year
and forgetting about the seven
weeks of informal commitments
in the spring.
A spokesman for the Chi Psi
house said that its members
“strongly disapproved” of the
proposal.
John Pyle, president of AKL,
said his house is somewhat divid
ed in their reactions. “Personal
ly,” said Pyle, “this needs to be
done.” He added that the seven
week wait for formal pledging
will not hurt the fraternities and
prevents the false front that exists
during the short rush we have
now. Jim Towne of the ATO
house stated that his house is not
excited about having open contact
but that it will be of some ad
vantage to the freshmen.
JIM HELTZEL, Junipero spon
sor, said that he personally likes
the proposal, for it will keep the
Wilbur housing system a cohesive
unit during spring quarter. Helt
zel also said that the additional
freshmen-fraternity contact will
assist the freshmen in making the
[ right choice of living group.
Word on the proposal’s accept-
I ance or rejection is expected from
the president’s office soon.
The new Joint Proposal for
Living Group .Selections now be
for President Sterling for adop
tion is being sheltered by some
campus factions and rejected by
others.
