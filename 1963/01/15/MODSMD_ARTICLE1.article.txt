## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI)— President Kennedy asked Congress
yesterday for a record three-year $lO billion tax cut that would be
accompanied by a slash in all federal spending except for defense
and space.
In a generally optimistic report on the State of the Union,

the President proposed that the
program be launched with a S6
billion cut this year in individual
income and corporate taxes. The
i-est of the cut would be imposed
in 1964 and 1965 If approved by
Congress, it would be the single
biggest tax reduction program in
history.
The tax program highlighted
the President’s address to a joint
session of the House and Senate,
during which he spoke soberly
hut hopefully on the nation’s fu
ture. He said steady progress had
been made toward a world of or
der. and “the recession is behind
us.”
Kennedy advised the law
makers that his fiscal 1964 budget
to be submitted Thursday will
show a deficit because of higher
spending for defense, space and
interest on the national debt. The
budget is expected to call for rec
ord spending of about $99.5 bil
lion. The President emphasized
the importance he attached to his
tax program by touching only
briefly on such New Frontier
proposals as medical care, aid to
education, farm policy and youth
training. They will be outlined in
separate messages.

HE 1)11) CALL for a domestic
youth corps whose members
would be used in mental hospi
tals,, on Indian reservations, at
training centers for the aged, and
to help combat juvenile delin
quency.

In discussing world affairs, the
President drew applause with
perhaps most coming from the
Democrats when he said the
cold war had calmed somewhat
in the wake of the Cuban missile
crisis.

HE SEKVEI) notice that ho
would submit a foreign aid pro
gram calling for about the same
amount of spending as this year,
but appealed to resurgent Euro
pean countries, as well as Japan,
to join in the effort. If the aid
program should be ended, he said,
“our failures in a dozen countries
would be sudden and certain.”
