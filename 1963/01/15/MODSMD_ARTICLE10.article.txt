# New Rush Proposals Rejected by Clubs, Partly Rejected by IFC
## 
### PHIL DE GUERE 
Last night the IFC and the ICC
both voted against the new rush
proposal, which the former body
had passed last week.
Doan Larimer, speaking at the
IFC meeting, said prior to the
vote that if no “reasonably har
monious” policy could be arrived
at by the four living groups in
volved, an alternative might l>e
for the administration to decide
upon a compromise which it felt
best for all the groups and then
to impose it.
The IFC then voted to rescind
last week’s acceptance of the pro
posal. Principle objections were
the lack of attendance at the pre
vious meeting, the lack of oppor
tunity for discussion within the
houses, and the academic and fi
nancial detriment involved in the
expanded spxing quarter rush
time.

The IFC then voted to accept
the new rush proposals that ap
ply to Autumn and Winter quar
ters but to reject the proposals
applying to Spring quarter.
The ICC, which had not yet
voted on the proposal, voted down
the proposal five to two, and with
it a revision of section C-3 which
prohibited contact at meals dur
ing the first seven weeks of
spring quarter.
As amended, section C-3 would
have allowed rushes at meals,
subject to restrictions by tho liv

ing unit's own group -IFC. ICC,
or IHC. There would have been a
limit of three rush guests per
meal.

Tho clubs voting for the pro
posal were Los Arcos and El
Campo; those voting against were
Breakers. El Capitan, El Cuadro,
El Tigre, and El Toro.

The reasons given for voting
down the rush proposal were the
restrictions on off-campus mcet-
