# Dr. Edwin M. Good Searches Religion For 'Ironic Vision'
## 
### NORMAN GREENBERG 
How can religion, which is so
conservative, so solemn and
grave, and so concerned with the
preservation of itself, have an
ironic vision? So asked Dr. Ed
win M. Good yesterday at Tresid
der Union in his speech “Religion
and the Ironic Vision.”

In answering this question,
Good defined irony as the percep
tion of the state of incongruity
aiming towards correction of the
incongruity. Religion, like the
ironic vision, is concerned with
the underlying truth in the world.
And religion finds that truth in
God’s precedence to man.
Hence, salvation, the reconcili
ation between God and man, is
given to man by God. And here
we see the first ironic vision:
man cannot take the credit for
his relationship with God. “He
who exalts himself will be hum
bled, and he who humbles him
self will be exalted.”
The creation provides a further
irony arising from the fact (hat
man is limited within the bounds
of a created being. Man must ful
fill his duty on the Earth. But
man’s tendency to deify or to de
grade the creation provides the
irony. For the former prevents
him from probing within the
secrets of nature and the latter
leads him to mutilate the Earth
of which he is a part.
Good concluded by identifying
religion as “the ground of free
dom spacious enough to permit
the widest perspective of the
world.” A man’s vision of the re
ligious truth sets him free: he
realizes that he is not responsible
for all existence, and ho realizes
his nature.

“He is neither a god nor a
worm.” Rather, he is both ridicu
lousness and splendor. We can
either “laugh the laughter of ridi
cule or the laughter of joy.” And
religion offers redemption as the
corrective and of the ironic vision.
