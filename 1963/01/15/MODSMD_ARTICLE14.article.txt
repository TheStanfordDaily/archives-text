# Representative Gubser, House Rules Committee
## 
### 
It comes as no surprise that Representative Charles Gubser,
R-Gilroy, voted to repeal reform of the House Rules Committee
in Wednesday’s roll call vote in the House. Despite predictions
of a close vote, the House voted decisively, 235-196, to retain the
“reform size’’ of fifteen members for the Rules Committee,
Mr. Gubser’s vote should not he noted today and forgotten
tomorrow, for in voting to restore the committee’s size to twelve,
Mr. Gubser voted to stifle democracy within the House. For
years the Rules Committee has been bottling up important legis
lation so that it cannot go to the floor of the' House for a vote. At
the size of twelve the Committee would have been able to obstruct
all of the President’s major legislation as it bad done so successfully
until two years ago when the Committee was expanded.
Although there is no guarantee now that the President’s pro
gram will necessarily fare well in the Rules Committee, it has a
better chance than with the smaller Committee. And although
Mr. Gubser cannot he expected to vote for the President’s pro
gram, he can he expected to vote to allow that program to come
before the whole House for debate and decision. Mr. Gubser’s
vote was an unprincipled one; it was not made in the name of
honest conservative principles. It was a vote for obstructionism
and opportunism in the name of thwarting majority rule.
Last year even with the fifteen-man Rules Committee, five of
the President’s liberal bills were killed in that Committee: general
aid to education, college aid, aid to medical and dental schools,
creation of a Department of Urban Affairs, and aid to migrant
workers. This year the President may get more legislation out of
the Rules Committee despite last year’s spotty record. If he does
have greater success in bringing hills to a vote in the House, he
will not have the likes of Mr. Gubser to thank. Their ilk prefer to
thwart the democratic process within the House.
