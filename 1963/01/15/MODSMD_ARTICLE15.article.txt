Editor, The Daily:
We, as members of the fresh
man class, feel it necessary to
make known our feelings on the
new rush proposal now under
consideration by the administra
tion. The extended seven-week pe
riod after rush is unnecessary in
our opinion to the desired pur
poses of rush. The new proposal
could only help to destroy pledge
unity and would not appreciably
help any existing Wilbur unity.

If it does have any benefits, they
could be accomplished in a much
shorter time, say two weeks. We
feel that the limited contact dur
ing Winter Quarter, coupled with
rush week, would provide ample
opportunity for a proper decision
on which house to pledge.
