# PEACE CORPS IN ETHIOPIA
## 'Adjustment Surprisingly Easy, Anticlimactic After Training Lectures' 
### TONY VIGO 
(Editor’s note: The following:are
excerpts from four letters from
Tony Vigo, a Stanford graduate
and Peace Corps Volunteer living
in Ethiopia.)

I’m stationed with one other
volunteer (Knut Royce from Car
lisle, Pennsylvania) in a very
small Eritrean village called Adi
Teclasan. It’s In fact the smallest
village in Ethiopia with Peace
Corps teachers and was to be
passed by in this project until the
two of us requested transfers
outside the urban centers of Ad
dis Ababa and Asamara.

We are both teaching in the
Teclasan Middle School (grades
5-8). Knut is teaching English,

Geography, History and Physical
Education to the sixth and sev
enth grades, while I’m teaching
English to thq, fifth and sixth.
Last week we started special
night classes for interested stu
dents and a few adults— in re
turn for tutoring in the local
language, Tigrinya. . . . I’m also
going to teach gymnastics after
school. This is the harvest time
I Nov. 13th letter) so most of the
students don’t have time for after
school activities yet. They get up
at 5 or 6 to go to work in the
fields and many of them have to
walk as far as 15 kilometers to
school in the morning. Then when
they get home they work till dark
in the fields and try to read and
do homework by moonlight.

One of the discoveries we’ve
made in Teclasan is that living in
a small village as opposed to a
city has involved us in far more
than the educational life of the
people. When we first arrived we
were naturally interested in see
ing our new home, so we took
frequent walks around the vil
lage. This curiosity apparently
amazed the villagers, as our head
master later told us, and the ma
jor topic of conversation for some
time was whose field the Peace
Corps teachers visited yesterday.

You asked how well the women
are doing. In some ways the wom
en are doing the best of all. All
of them are so very interested in
the work they’re doing and 1
think this takes the kind of per
sonal involvement that a woman
can offer. Too often I think a
man doesn’t feel the emotional
implications of his position here
and it becomes “another job.” I
really think the girls are much
happier in general than the guys.

. . . You shouldn’t over rate the
strength it takes to be here. The
adjustment is surprisingly easy,
and, in away, anticlimactic after
the many lectures in training.
You very soon become involved
in the immediate situation of
your working and teaching so
that you hardly even have time
to evaluate yourself and doubt
your effectiveness. . . . There is
one element that comes up here
more often than it did in Europe
(Vigo was at Stanford in France,
II)—a loneliness for the friend
ships of college and the somewhat
more exciting intellectual life of
college. There is a real excite
ment here but it is definitely not
the kind of intellectual thing you
find at Stanford. You worry
about how to get a particular kid
to understand a minute grammat
ical point in English, or you wor
ry because one of your classes
doesn’t pay attention when you
discuss something you think is
important for them—but there is
very little opportunity to worry
about Marcel Proust, or discuss
contemporary poetry. . . .
I’ve changed my mind a dozen
times about why I’m here or
what I want from all this, and
no doubt I’ll change my mind a
dozen times again. When an old
man, weathered and hunched and
toothless comes and grasps my
hands with both hands to show
he’s happy I’m here it almost
makes me sick to know the dif
ference there is between us. He
could never comprehend my per
sonality nor I his, but I know
why I’m here. . . .

I’m stationed with one other
volunteer (Knut Royce from Car
lisle, Pennsylvania) in a very
small Eritrean village called Adi
Teclasan. It’s In fact the smallest
village in Ethiopia with Peace
Corps teachers and was to be
passed by in this project until the
two of us requested transfers
outside the urban centers of Ad
dis Ababa and Asamara.

We are both teaching in the
Teclasan Middle School (grades
5-8). Knut is teaching English,

Geography, History and Physical
Education to the sixth and sev
enth grades, while I’m teaching
English to thq, fifth and sixth.
Last week we started special
night classes for interested stu
dents and a few adults— in re
turn for tutoring in the local
language, Tigrinya. . . . I’m also
going to teach gymnastics after
school. This is the harvest time
I Nov. 13th letter) so most of the
students don’t have time for after
school activities yet. They get up
at 5 or 6 to go to work in the
fields and many of them have to
walk as far as 15 kilometers to
school in the morning. Then when
they get home they work till dark
in the fields and try to read and
do homework by moonlight.

One of the discoveries we’ve
made in Teclasan is that living in
a small village as opposed to a
city has involved us in far more
than the educational life of the
people. When we first arrived we
were naturally interested in see
ing our new home, so we took
frequent walks around the vil
lage. This curiosity apparently
amazed the villagers, as our head
master later told us, and the ma
jor topic of conversation for some
time was whose field the Peace
Corps teachers visited yesterday.

You asked how well the women
are doing. In some ways the wom
en are doing the best of all. All
of them are so very interested in
the work they’re doing and 1
think this takes the kind of per
sonal involvement that a woman
can offer. Too often I think a
man doesn’t feel the emotional
implications of his position here
and it becomes “another job.” I
really think the girls are much
happier in general than the guys.

. . . You shouldn’t over rate the
strength it takes to be here. The
adjustment is surprisingly easy,
and, in away, anticlimactic after
the many lectures in training.
You very soon become involved
in the immediate situation of
your working and teaching so
that you hardly even have time
to evaluate yourself and doubt
your effectiveness. . . . There is
one element that comes up here
more often than it did in Europe
(Vigo was at Stanford in France,
II)—a loneliness for the friend
ships of college and the somewhat
more exciting intellectual life of
college. There is a real excite
ment here but it is definitely not
the kind of intellectual thing you
find at Stanford. You worry
about how to get a particular kid
to understand a minute grammat
ical point in English, or you wor
ry because one of your classes
doesn’t pay attention when you
discuss something you think is
important for them—but there is
very little opportunity to worry
about Marcel Proust, or discuss
contemporary poetry. . . .
I’ve changed my mind a dozen
times about why I’m here or
what I want from all this, and
no doubt I’ll change my mind a
dozen times again. When an old
man, weathered and hunched and
toothless comes and grasps my
hands with both hands to show
he’s happy I’m here it almost
makes me sick to know the dif
ference there is between us. He
could never comprehend my per
sonality nor I his, but I know
why I’m here. . . .

passed by in this project until the
two of us requested transfers
outside the urban centers of Ad
dis Ababa and Asamara.

We are both teaching in the
Teclasan Middle School (grades
5-8). Knut is teaching English,

Geography, History and Physical
Education to the sixth and sev
enth grades, while I’m teaching
English to thq, fifth and sixth.
Last week we started special
night classes for interested stu
dents and a few adults— in re
turn for tutoring in the local
language, Tigrinya. . . . I’m also
going to teach gymnastics after
school. This is the harvest time
I Nov. 13th letter) so most of the
students don’t have time for after
school activities yet. They get up
at 5 or 6 to go to work in the
fields and many of them have to
walk as far as 15 kilometers to
school in the morning. Then when
they get home they work till dark
in the fields and try to read and
do homework by moonlight.

One of the discoveries we’ve
made in Teclasan is that living in
a small village as opposed to a
city has involved us in far more
than the educational life of the
people. When we first arrived we
were naturally interested in see
ing our new home, so we took
frequent walks around the vil
lage. This curiosity apparently
amazed the villagers, as our head
master later told us, and the ma
jor topic of conversation for some
time was whose field the Peace
Corps teachers visited yesterday.

You asked how well the women
are doing. In some ways the wom
en are doing the best of all. All
of them are so very interested in
the work they’re doing and 1
think this takes the kind of per
sonal involvement that a woman
can offer. Too often I think a
man doesn’t feel the emotional
implications of his position here
and it becomes “another job.” I
really think the girls are much
happier in general than the guys.

. . . You shouldn’t over rate the
strength it takes to be here. The
adjustment is surprisingly easy,
and, in away, anticlimactic after
the many lectures in training.
You very soon become involved
in the immediate situation of
your working and teaching so
that you hardly even have time
to evaluate yourself and doubt
your effectiveness. . . . There is
one element that comes up here
more often than it did in Europe
(Vigo was at Stanford in France,
II)—a loneliness for the friend
ships of college and the somewhat
more exciting intellectual life of
college. There is a real excite
ment here but it is definitely not
the kind of intellectual thing you
find at Stanford. You worry
about how to get a particular kid
to understand a minute grammat
ical point in English, or you wor
ry because one of your classes
doesn’t pay attention when you
discuss something you think is
important for them—but there is
very little opportunity to worry
about Marcel Proust, or discuss
contemporary poetry. . . .
I’ve changed my mind a dozen
times about why I’m here or
what I want from all this, and
no doubt I’ll change my mind a
dozen times again. When an old
man, weathered and hunched and
toothless comes and grasps my
hands with both hands to show
he’s happy I’m here it almost
makes me sick to know the dif
ference there is between us. He
could never comprehend my per
sonality nor I his, but I know
why I’m here. . . .
