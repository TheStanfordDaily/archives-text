# Text of Letter to Sterling Opposing Rush Changes
## 
### 
Dear Dr. Sterling:
During the past year there have
been two separate committees on
rushing. The first of these com
mittees was the IFC rush com
mittee. This committee formu
lated a fall and winter quarter
rushing plan designed to alleviate
problems in Wilbur and Stern
Halls resulting from fraternity
rushing.
This program, passed by the
IFC last fall, consisted of open
contact during all but the first
two weeks of winter quarter. This
lengthened period of open contact
should give freshmen men ample
opportunity to investigate frater
nity living. Furthermore, those
freshmen men who would later
find fraternity living incompati
ble, should, during this extended
eight-week program, realize their
lack of common interest with fra
ternities.
The other committee was the
Living Group Selection Commit
tee appointed by Dean Larimer
and the Student Body President.
This committee, composed of
members of IFC, ICC, Stern and
Wilbur Halls, undertook a similar
but separate study. Their report
adopted everything that the IFC
Rush Committee proposed with
additional changes in spring quar
ter rush. The basic change in this
proposal, and the one to which
we take serious exception, is the
postponement of the signing of
pledge cards by the freshmen un
til seven weeks into spring quar
ter. The objective here was to de
lay decision by freshmen men
with regard to their future living
commitments as well as to pre
vent an interruption in the Wil
bur system by forestalling formal
pledge class activities for seven
weeks.

It is the feeling of the under
signed that this joint proposal
will be detrimental to the Wilbur
men, the Wilbur system, fraterni
ties, Stern Hall, and the eating
clubs. We feel that the IFC’s win
ter quarter plan eases the prob
lems of living group selection as
faced by freshmen men, and that
seven additional weeks of open
contact in spring quarter will
prove to bo superfluous and need
lessly time consuming, as well as
expensive. After the first week of
spring quarter many freshmen
men will undoubtedly have made
preliminary decisions and com
mitments. The fraternities, being
naturally concerned with secur
ing a pledge class, will continue
an intensified rush through the
seven weeks of Spring Quarter.
Contrary to the belief of the Liv
ing Group Selection Committee,
we believe that the freshmen men
will be needlessly involved in
rush at the expense of 1) study
time. 2) allegiance to the Wilbur
system, and 31 increase in emo
tional anxieties among those
freshmen who are frustrated by
the problems of living group se
lection. The fraternities will na
turally allocate more time and
money to this extra rush period.
With the present pi-essures on
fraternities for higher grades and
lower rushing expenditures, we
feel that this additional rushing
period would he unfortunate.
Last Tuesday evening an IFC
meeting was called on short no
tice. The main item on the agen
da was the Joint Living Group
Selection Committee’s rushing
proposal. Unfortunately, eight
houses were not represented at
the meeting and those representa
tives who were present had not
had an opportunity to discuss this
proposal with their rush chair
men or with their respective
houses. At this meeting a motion
was passed supporting this pro
posal. In the two days since that
meeting, there has been consider
able discontent on the row and in
Wilbur over this joint rushing
committee proposal. At a more
representative meeting, composed
of fraternity rush chairmen, to
ward the end of last fall quarter,
a unanimous vote in opposition to
this spring quarter rushing pro
posal was taken.

We had hoped that the winter
quarter- proposal adopted by IFC
would ease the pressure on fresh
men men resulting from rushing,
and are rather stunned at this
new spring quarter proposal. We
hope that this letter will give you
an opinion from those people
most closely connected with rush,
and that the final decision on this
matter will be based on an accu
rate understanding of the conse
quences involved.

Dear Dr. Sterling:
During the past year there have
been two separate committees on
rushing. The first of these com
mittees was the IFC rush com
mittee. This committee formu
lated a fall and winter quarter
rushing plan designed to alleviate
problems in Wilbur and Stern
Halls resulting from fraternity
rushing.
This program, passed by the
IFC last fall, consisted of open
contact during all but the first
two weeks of winter quarter. This
lengthened period of open contact
should give freshmen men ample
opportunity to investigate frater
nity living. Furthermore, those
freshmen men who would later
find fraternity living incompati
ble, should, during this extended
eight-week program, realize their
lack of common interest with fra
ternities.
The other committee was the
Living Group Selection Commit
tee appointed by Dean Larimer
and the Student Body President.
This committee, composed of
members of IFC, ICC, Stern and
Wilbur Halls, undertook a similar
but separate study. Their report
adopted everything that the IFC
Rush Committee proposed with
additional changes in spring quar
ter rush. The basic change in this
proposal, and the one to which
we take serious exception, is the
postponement of the signing of
pledge cards by the freshmen un
til seven weeks into spring quar
ter. The objective here was to de
lay decision by freshmen men
with regard to their future living
commitments as well as to pre
vent an interruption in the Wil
bur system by forestalling formal
pledge class activities for seven
weeks.

It is the feeling of the under
signed that this joint proposal
will be detrimental to the Wilbur
men, the Wilbur system, fraterni
ties, Stern Hall, and the eating
clubs. We feel that the IFC’s win
ter quarter plan eases the prob
lems of living group selection as
faced by freshmen men, and that
seven additional weeks of open
contact in spring quarter will
prove to bo superfluous and need
lessly time consuming, as well as
expensive. After the first week of
spring quarter many freshmen
men will undoubtedly have made
preliminary decisions and com
mitments. The fraternities, being
naturally concerned with secur
ing a pledge class, will continue
an intensified rush through the
seven weeks of Spring Quarter.
Contrary to the belief of the Liv
ing Group Selection Committee,
we believe that the freshmen men
will be needlessly involved in
rush at the expense of 1) study
time. 2) allegiance to the Wilbur
system, and 31 increase in emo
tional anxieties among those
freshmen who are frustrated by
the problems of living group se
lection. The fraternities will na
turally allocate more time and
money to this extra rush period.
With the present pi-essures on
fraternities for higher grades and
lower rushing expenditures, we
feel that this additional rushing
period would he unfortunate.
Last Tuesday evening an IFC
meeting was called on short no
tice. The main item on the agen
da was the Joint Living Group
Selection Committee’s rushing
proposal. Unfortunately, eight
houses were not represented at
the meeting and those representa
tives who were present had not
had an opportunity to discuss this
proposal with their rush chair
men or with their respective
houses. At this meeting a motion
was passed supporting this pro
posal. In the two days since that
meeting, there has been consider
able discontent on the row and in
Wilbur over this joint rushing
committee proposal. At a more
representative meeting, composed
of fraternity rush chairmen, to
ward the end of last fall quarter,
a unanimous vote in opposition to
this spring quarter rushing pro
posal was taken.

We had hoped that the winter
quarter- proposal adopted by IFC
would ease the pressure on fresh
men men resulting from rushing,
and are rather stunned at this
new spring quarter proposal. We
hope that this letter will give you
an opinion from those people
most closely connected with rush,
and that the final decision on this
matter will be based on an accu
rate understanding of the conse
quences involved.

Dear Dr. Sterling:
During the past year there have
been two separate committees on
rushing. The first of these com
mittees was the IFC rush com
mittee. This committee formu
lated a fall and winter quarter
rushing plan designed to alleviate
problems in Wilbur and Stern
Halls resulting from fraternity
rushing.
This program, passed by the
IFC last fall, consisted of open
contact during all but the first
two weeks of winter quarter. This
lengthened period of open contact
should give freshmen men ample
opportunity to investigate frater
nity living. Furthermore, those
freshmen men who would later
find fraternity living incompati
ble, should, during this extended
eight-week program, realize their
lack of common interest with fra
ternities.
The other committee was the
Living Group Selection Commit
tee appointed by Dean Larimer
and the Student Body President.
This committee, composed of
members of IFC, ICC, Stern and
Wilbur Halls, undertook a similar
but separate study. Their report
adopted everything that the IFC
Rush Committee proposed with
additional changes in spring quar
ter rush. The basic change in this
proposal, and the one to which
we take serious exception, is the
postponement of the signing of
pledge cards by the freshmen un
til seven weeks into spring quar
ter. The objective here was to de
lay decision by freshmen men
with regard to their future living
commitments as well as to pre
vent an interruption in the Wil
bur system by forestalling formal
pledge class activities for seven
weeks.

It is the feeling of the under
signed that this joint proposal
will be detrimental to the Wilbur
men, the Wilbur system, fraterni
ties, Stern Hall, and the eating
clubs. We feel that the IFC’s win
ter quarter plan eases the prob
lems of living group selection as
faced by freshmen men, and that
seven additional weeks of open
contact in spring quarter will
prove to bo superfluous and need
lessly time consuming, as well as
expensive. After the first week of
spring quarter many freshmen
men will undoubtedly have made
preliminary decisions and com
mitments. The fraternities, being
naturally concerned with secur
ing a pledge class, will continue
an intensified rush through the
seven weeks of Spring Quarter.
Contrary to the belief of the Liv
ing Group Selection Committee,
we believe that the freshmen men
will be needlessly involved in
rush at the expense of 1) study
time. 2) allegiance to the Wilbur
system, and 31 increase in emo
tional anxieties among those
freshmen who are frustrated by
the problems of living group se
lection. The fraternities will na
turally allocate more time and
money to this extra rush period.
With the present pi-essures on
fraternities for higher grades and
lower rushing expenditures, we
feel that this additional rushing
period would he unfortunate.
Last Tuesday evening an IFC
meeting was called on short no
tice. The main item on the agen
da was the Joint Living Group
Selection Committee’s rushing
proposal. Unfortunately, eight
houses were not represented at
the meeting and those representa
tives who were present had not
had an opportunity to discuss this
proposal with their rush chair
men or with their respective
houses. At this meeting a motion
was passed supporting this pro
posal. In the two days since that
meeting, there has been consider
able discontent on the row and in
Wilbur over this joint rushing
committee proposal. At a more
representative meeting, composed
of fraternity rush chairmen, to
ward the end of last fall quarter,
a unanimous vote in opposition to
this spring quarter rushing pro
posal was taken.

We had hoped that the winter
quarter- proposal adopted by IFC
would ease the pressure on fresh
men men resulting from rushing,
and are rather stunned at this
new spring quarter proposal. We
hope that this letter will give you
an opinion from those people
most closely connected with rush,
and that the final decision on this
matter will be based on an accu
rate understanding of the conse
quences involved.
