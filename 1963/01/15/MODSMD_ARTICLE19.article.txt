## New Congress to Reflect Pause in World Affairs 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The- new Congress is meeting in a time of letdown from a pro
longed crisis. There has come a pause in world affairs. For the
first time in a number of years—say since the challenge over Berlin
in 1958—the threat of thermonuclear war has receded somewhat
into the background. From Berlin, the Congo, the resumption of

nuclear testing and finally to the<
climax in Cuba, the crisis mourtt
ed. Now, for the time being at
least, in both halves of the world,
the pause which has a taint re
semblance to peace has relaxed
the tension enough to release the
rivalries and ambitions of normal
and unfrightened men.

| After the ar
mistice which
ended the fight
ing of the First
World War, Win
ston Churchill
wrote that the
battle of the gi
ants had ended
and that the
wars of the pyg
[mies had begun,
i of mortal crisis,

there are removed the unifying
pressures to hang together lest
we hang separately, the urgency
to rally around the leader lest
everything should fall apart.
Thus, with the Cuban crisis be
hind him, Mr. Khrushchev can
turn on his Chinese rivals. In the
West, dispute has broken out
over the leadership of the alli
ance. The dispute is possible, in
deed it is conceivable, only since
the alliance no longer feels that it
is seriously challenged by the So
viet Union.

WE MAY expect that the new
Congress will reflect the pause in
world affairs. In our American
constitutional experience, the
power of the President to lead is,
generally speaking, a function of
some kind of national crisis,
abroad in time of war and at
home in a time like the great de
pression of the 19305. President
Kennedy’s problem in this Con
gress is how to lead it when there
is no apparent national crisis.
There is, to be sure, plenty of
trouble and danger in the world
in which we are so deeply in
volved. But trouble which does
not carry with it the danger of
nuclear war is, for this case
hardened generation, not a real
crisis.
At home, there are many prob
lems. But there is no crisis re-

motely resembling that of the
Thirties which generated the
steam behind the New Deal.
While a great many Americans are
very angry about a good number
of things, more people are wor
ried that the government may
take away something that they
now have than are hoping that It
will provide them something
which they do not now enjoy.
This is the feeling of a satisfied
population.
And yet, under the complacent
surface, there are great matters
which need to be attended to.
These matters do not show their
consequences immediately, but
only in the long run. A prime ex
ample of this is the weakness of
American education. As we fail
to educate adequately one genera
tion of school children, the evil
results of this failure do not ap
pear fully until these children
grow up and become the unedu
cated parents of a still-less-edu
cated generation.
IT IS HARD to arouse democ
racies about the long run. This is
the President’s difficulty in deal
ing with the crucial matter of
overcoming the chronic sluggish
ness of the American economy.
The American economy is not do
ing what it could to provide the
means for meeting the long-time
needs of our expanding urbanized
population. But the American
economy, sluggish though it is,
does nevertheless provide a re
markable defense and a rising
standard of private living. The
President must try to rally the
support of a people which does
not feel itself under the pressure
of a crisis.

To achieve overwhelming per
suasion where there is no great
surge of emotion behind him. he
will have to take the risk of bor
ing the public by saying the same
thing over and over again, if pos
sible in different words. That has
not been in the Kennedy style.
But it may be indispensable.
