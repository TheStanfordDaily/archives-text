With two weeks of AAWU league play completed, Stanford has
unequivocally regained I lie favored position it held before the season
and especially before the debacle in the L.A. Classic.
UCLA, after winning the Classic, rose to the top of the league
ratings, but the Bruins immediately lost two games to lowly Wash
ington. Surprisingly strong California next drew acclaim by beating
USC twice, but has since lost consecutively to Stanford and UCLA.
So, of the established teams, Stanford tl-0» is by far in the best
position as of league play; further, its healthy split with powerful
Oregon State didn’t hurt its prospectus any. (Washington (3-1)
actually leads the AAWU, but most people refuse to take the Huskies
seriously—yet.) Cal (2-2) is third and UCLA tl-2) fourth.
Cal has basically the same team as last year. However, the added
year’s seasoning and the addition of two dependable sophomores pro
vides experience and depth, two significant strong points in the ab
sence of a wealth of individual standouts at Berkeley.
Dick Smith, a 6-0 senior guard, is the Bears' closest facsimile to
a star. He is currently scoring l(i points a game, primarily on his
consistent outside shooting and his ball stealing and break away
driving.
Camden Wall, a 6-10, 225-pound center, is a fearsome rebounder,
though not very accomplished as a scoring post man. Nevertheless,
he, along with 6-8 Chris Carpenter. 6-2 L Don Lauer, 6-7 Bob Wueste,
6-5 Jim Smith, and 6-4 Dan WoKhers, gives Cal a grueling rebound
ing attack. (Ask any Stanford player).
CAL DEPENDS ON TEAM TOGETHERNESS
But the Cal team cannot he judged by the players’ dimensions
or by their individual statistics, for its real strength lies in the
strong team cohesiveness and discipline that Coach Reno Herrerias
has taught and inspired. It is the same cohesiveness and discipline
with which Pete Newell led very unspectacular Bear teams to the
national championship and runner-up spots in 1959 and I960; neither
of these teams had an individual scorer above the 14-point per game
mark yet they both methodically and confidently handled more
highly regarded teams with Oscar Robertsons, Jerry Wests, and
Doug Smarts, while losing but six of 59 games in those two years.
Newell is currently director of athletics at Berkeley but his in
fluence is still evident on the court where the Bears use the same
deliberate control offense and tenacious defense he innovated. The
Bears’ strong sense of team play gives the individual something to
rely on during tense moments of play, while the deliberate style of
attack ensures that the Bears will rarely give up the ball on anything
other than an open, comfortable shot; sometimes they may run
methodically through the same pattern three or four times, unwilling
to risk a bad pass or force a shot where there is no opening.
In strong contrast to this style of play is the run-and-shoot
brand of ball advocated by UCLA coach John Wooden. This wide
open style, however, is well adapted to this year’s Bruin team.
Overall, the personnel is short and fast. The tallest players are 6-6
Dave Waxman, the top substitute for the second straight year, and
6-5 junior Fred Slaughter, the most effective rebounder on the Coast
at that height; his 230 pounds may have something to do with it.
However, the key man is Walt Ha/.zard, a 6-2 junior guard, who
must have been bom bouncing a basketball. It is athletic perfection
when Hazzard starts a fast break from the defensive foul circle,
glances around while dribbling at full speed to see which teammates
are with him, and finally sets up one of them for the two points.
The fast break is the backbone of the Bruin offense (the defense
is not worth mentioning), but Hazzard’s driving and passing-off are
lethal threats even in five-against-five situations.
IMPRESSIVE BRUIN SOPHOMORES
UCLA has practically compensated for the graduation of All-
AAWU veterans Gary Cunningham and John Green by the addition
of three sophs and a JC transfer, Jack Hirsch, a scrappy rebounding
but virtually non-scoring forward. The sophomores are Keith Erick
son. also a strong rebounder, and guards Gail Goodrich, the 1961

L.A. Player of the Year, and Fred
Goss, the 19(51 GIF Player of the
Year. The “G-men” averaged 24.4
and 16.8 respectively as freshmen
last year.
Goodrich and Goss, along with
Hazzard and Waxman, must pro
vide the outside shooting UCLA
needs, but which it didn’t get in
losing two games to Washington
two weeks ago in Seattle. Their
failure there was understandable,
however, since few visiting play
ers adjust to the Huskies’ home
court, which looks like it was
built for a three-ring circus rath
er than a basketball court.
At the other end of Los An
geles, the USC Trojans will em
ploy their standard heavy-footed,
head-down variation of the
Bruins' fast break attack. It will
be even less successful this year
than in the past, when slipshod
Trojan ball handling was covered
over by some outstanding indi
vidual players but still prevented
SC from fully realizing its po
tential.
Coach Forrest Twogood’s team
was decimated by graduation. He
lost four starters, including All-
AAWU John Rudometkin, Chris
Appel, and Ken Stanley. The only
returning first stringer is Gordon
Martin, a gawky 6-7 forward who
averages 17 points but shoots
about 35 per cent in the process.
The top new comers are guard
Bill Morris, last year’s JC Player
of the Year in California, averag
ing 26 points at Fullerton JC,
and Allen Young, a 6-5 forward
who averaged 28 points as a
freshman in 1962; Young is the
best all-round player on this
team, which is below par for
Troy. Its main problems are lack
of experience, consistent outside

shooting, and an adequate post,
man to score inside.
The Trojans started well, beat
ing their first nine, mediocre op
ponents but since have had better
competition and lost five of seven.
True, they beat Stanford but only
as the latter hit 19 per cent in the
first half, enabling SC to lead by
16 at the intermission.
Washington, which currently
leads the AAWU, ought soon to
he near the bottom. Coach John
Grayson’s team truly lacks poise;
a full-court press for the Husky
guards is a nightmare. Four of
last year’s starters, including All-
AAWU center Bill Hanson, gradu
ated.
The only returnee is 6-6 for
ward Ed Corell, an excellent re
bounder and dependable shooter
but not the kind of player an of
fense can be built around. Con
sequently the Huskies have a
pretty ragged attack: center Dale
Easley, a senior who has played
little heretofore, works well un
der the basket but lacks an ade
quate hook or jump shot from
the post position: 6-3 guard Char
lie Hart hustles around drawing
copious fouls but shoots poorly
from outside; and Corell makes
an outside shot or a tipin now and
then.
Washington plays a pair in the
Pavilion this weekend, and hope
fully the Indians will take advan
tage of the Northerners’ inept
ness and continue to stay on top
of the AAWU heap.
