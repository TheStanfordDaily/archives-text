## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford guards Don Clemet
son and Low Shupe wero named
co-basketball players of the week
in Northern California by the
Nor-Cal sportswrlters yesterday
at their weekly luncheon at
Rickey’s. Stanford center Tom
Dose was close behind the win
ners in the weekly tabulation.

Clemetson had an excellent
week, scoring 53 points. He hit
13 against Cal and 40 in the two
OSU games. Shupe sank the Gol
den Bears with 16 points, includ
ing six of seven floor shots, and
four of four free throws. His two
charities in the final minute of
the second overtime were the de
ciding points against Cal.

DOSE SCORED 57 for (he
week, including 29 against State’s
7-1 center Mel Counts, who is one
of the better defensive centers in
college basketball.

Other news was not so good for
Stanford Coach Howie Dallmar
yesterday. Dallmar learned that
his fine reserve center Craig Cor
des is lost for six weeks, instead
of the earlier estimate of two.
Cordes’ frontal sinus lobe was
fractured by a stray elbow in
Saturday’s action against Oregon
State.
The status of Hollis Moore’s
ankle is still unknown. Moore
says he wants to be back at prac
tice by tomorrow, but his
sprained ankle swelled up con
siderably over the weekend. He
may not play against Washing
ton. If he doesn’t, Clayton Raaka
will start at a forward. Raaka
will also see some action as a re
placement for Cordes, as will
John Murray.
DALLMAR LAUDED Shape’s
fine play against Cal. “Shupe was
the difference in the Cal game.
It’s good to have a small guy in
basketball a dominant figure.’’
Bear Coach Rene Herrerias
closed the meeting on a happy
note for Stanford basketball fans.
Herrerias said that if Stanford
beats Washington twice this
weekend, the Cards should have
clear sailing to the Big Six cham
pionship.

Cordes’ frontal sinus lobe was
fractured by a stray elbow in
Saturday’s action against Oregon
State.
The status of Hollis Moore’s
ankle is still unknown. Moore
says he wants to be back at prac
tice by tomorrow, but his
sprained ankle swelled up con
siderably over the weekend. He
may not play against Washing
ton. If he doesn’t, Clayton Raaka
will start at a forward. Raaka
will also see some action as a re
placement for Cordes, as will
John Murray.
DALLMAR LAUDED Shape’s
fine play against Cal. “Shupe was
the difference in the Cal game.
It’s good to have a small guy in
basketball a dominant figure.’’
Bear Coach Rene Herrerias
closed the meeting on a happy
note for Stanford basketball fans.
Herrerias said that if Stanford
beats Washington twice this
weekend, the Cards should have
clear sailing to the Big Six cham

four of four free throws. His two
charities in the final minute of
the second overtime were the de
ciding points against Cal.

his fine reserve center Craig Cor
