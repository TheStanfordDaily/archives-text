# Physical Chemistry Lab To Be Completed in '63
## 
### 
Work has started on the John
Stauffer Laboratory for Physical
Chemistry, a $1 million facility
which is expected to become a
national center for advanced
teaching and research in this fast
developing field.
John Stauffer, senior vice-presi
dent of the Stauffer Chemical
Company, provided the basic fi
nancing with his gift to Stan
ford’s $lOO million PACE Pro
gram last February.
President Wallace Sterling said
additional support came from the
National Science Foundation of
Washington, D.C., “in recognition
of (he importance of this project
to the nation’s progress in chem
istry.”

THK NKW laboratory will be
tho architectural twin of the ex
isting John Stauffer Chemistry
Building, dedicated in March
1961. Both buildings have played
an important part in recent re
cruitment of outstanding chem

ists, who need more space and
modern equipment for their re
search.
Equipment for the laboratory
will include nuclear magnetic
resonance apparatus, mass spec
trometers. ultraviolet and infra
red spectrometers, light-scatter
ing apparatus, calculators and
other intricate machines for as
sembling scientific statistical
data.

The Physical Chemistry labora
tory is scheduled for completion
by the close of 1963.
