# Senate Investigates Station KPFA; Suspects Communist Infiltration
## 
### LYNN SUSAG 
“We are completely confound
ed by the investigation of our
station,” Leslie Strickland, pro
motion manager of Berkeley FM
radio station KPFA said yester
day. The Pacifica Foundation, op
erator of WBAI in New York,
KPFK in Los Angeles, and
KPFA, is being investigated by
the Senate Internal Security
Committee concerning the possi
bility of Communist infiltration
in mass communications.
Hearings for the investigation
which began last Thursday con
cluded Friday. At the termina
tion of the sessions Senator
Thomas J, Dodd of Connecticut,
committee chairman, stated that
the investigation would continue
either in open or in closed execu
tive sessions.
“We are trying to have the
meetings opened up to the pub
lic,” Strickland said.
Members of the Foundation,
Trevor Thomas, president. Je
rome Shore, executive vice presi
dent, Jerome Binns. station man
ager in New York and Peter
Oregard, director, have testified
before the committee so far. No
more members of the foundation
or participants in station pro
grams have been subpoenaed this
week, Strickland said.
“We can only speculate on the
reasons for the hearings,” Strick
land said. One opinion offered by
a foundation director concerned
the station’s presentations of a
Federal Bureau of Investigation
agent reportedly critical of J.
Edgar Hoover. The Los Angeles

station has also broadcast 15-
minute news commentaries once
every two weeks by Dorothy
Healey, chairman of the Califor
nit American Communist Party,
“Anyone can hear what we
broadcast,” Strickland explained.
“We identify all speakers as
Democrats, Republicans, Commu
nists, or whatever they are.”
Strickland said that people
have responded to the investiga
tions by enormously increasing
the amount of weekly subscrip
tions. The KPFA station has no
commercial support, but is oper
ated only on listener subscrip
tions of SI 2 a year.
The New York Times in an
editorial yesterday morning criti
cized the hearings. The editorial
stated that Dodd said at the open
ing inquiry “that the subcommit
tee was not interested in knowing
whether the programming of ra
dio stations actually had come
under Communis) influence.”
Rather, he said, it would try to
find out whether there had been
“infiltration” which made such
influence “possible.”
“Under this bizarre criterion,”
the editorial continued, “the sub
committee is evidently asserting
the right to inquire into the back
ground and beliefs of everyone
working for an organ of public
opinion.” The editorial concluded,
“Pacifica’s worst sin appears to
have been the dissemination of
off beat ideas that have angered
some people and annoyed others.
The subcommittee’s inquiry looks
like an attempt to conform to a
concept of speech that is pleasing
lather than free.”

land said. One opinion offered by
a foundation director concerned
the station’s presentations of a
Federal Bureau of Investigation
agent reportedly critical of J.
Edgar Hoover. The Los Angeles

station has also broadcast 15-
minute news commentaries once
every two weeks by Dorothy
Healey, chairman of the Califor
nit American Communist Party,
“Anyone can hear what we
broadcast,” Strickland explained.
“We identify all speakers as
Democrats, Republicans, Commu
nists, or whatever they are.”
Strickland said that people
have responded to the investiga
tions by enormously increasing
the amount of weekly subscrip
tions. The KPFA station has no
commercial support, but is oper
ated only on listener subscrip
tions of SI 2 a year.
The New York Times in an
editorial yesterday morning criti
cized the hearings. The editorial
stated that Dodd said at the open
ing inquiry “that the subcommit
tee was not interested in knowing
whether the programming of ra
dio stations actually had come
under Communis) influence.”
Rather, he said, it would try to
find out whether there had been
“infiltration” which made such
influence “possible.”
“Under this bizarre criterion,”
the editorial continued, “the sub
committee is evidently asserting
the right to inquire into the back
ground and beliefs of everyone
working for an organ of public
opinion.” The editorial concluded,
“Pacifica’s worst sin appears to
have been the dissemination of
off beat ideas that have angered
some people and annoyed others.
The subcommittee’s inquiry looks
like an attempt to conform to a
concept of speech that is pleasing
lather than free.”
“We are completely confound
ed by the investigation of our
station,” Leslie Strickland, pro
motion manager of Berkeley FM
radio station KPFA said yester
day. The Pacifica Foundation, op
erator of WBAI in New York,
KPFK in Los Angeles, and
KPFA, is being investigated by
the Senate Internal Security
Committee concerning the possi
bility of Communist infiltration
in mass communications.
Hearings for the investigation
which began last Thursday con
cluded Friday. At the termina
tion of the sessions Senator
Thomas J, Dodd of Connecticut,
committee chairman, stated that
the investigation would continue
either in open or in closed execu
tive sessions.
“We are trying to have the
meetings opened up to the pub
lic,” Strickland said.
Members of the Foundation,
Trevor Thomas, president. Je
rome Shore, executive vice presi
dent, Jerome Binns. station man
ager in New York and Peter
Oregard, director, have testified
before the committee so far. No
more members of the foundation
or participants in station pro
grams have been subpoenaed this
week, Strickland said.
“We can only speculate on the
reasons for the hearings,” Strick
land said. One opinion offered by
