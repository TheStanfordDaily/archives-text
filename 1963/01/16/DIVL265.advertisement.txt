INFERIORITY CAN BE FUN
I ho socoml gravest problem confronting college students to
day is inferiority reeling*. (The first gravest problem is of
•■nurse, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority house
canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority
feelings and their possible cures.
Psychologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal
categories:
1. Physical inferiority,
2. Mental inferiority.
3. Financial inferiority.
low there is also a fourth category: ichthyological
inferiority—a feeling that other people have prettier fish -
but I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the
< beat Lakes area.)
Let us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps
the easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined to feel
interior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful home
coining queen. But we should not. look at all the people,
neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their marks in
the world. Look at Napoleon. look at Socrates. Look at
Caesar, look at Lassie.

What I mean is that you can’t always tell what’s inside a
package by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course, you
can , Take M arlboro Cigarettes, for example. .lust one glance
at that jolly red-and-white package—so bright and pert so
neat but not gaudy—so perfectly in place whether you are at
a formal dinner or a beach picnic—so invariably correct for
any time, clime, or condition one look, 1 say, at this paragon
of packs and you know it has to contain cigarettes of absolute
perfection. And you are right! That pure white Marlboro
filter, that fine, flavorful blend of Marlboro tobaccos, will
give you a smoke to make the welkin ring, whatever that is.
So those of you who have just been sitting and admiring your
Marlboro packs since the beginning of the semester, why don’t
you open a pack and light one? Light a cigarette, I mean—
not the package. Then you can settle back and smoke your
Marlboro and. at the same time, continue to gaze rapturously
at the pack. Thus you will be twice as happy as you are if
that is possible.)
But 1 digress. Ix»t us turn now to the second category—
mental inferiority. A lot of people think they are dumber tiian
other people. This is not so. It must be remembered that there
are different kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the clas
sic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and Sturbridge, stu
dents at Wake Forest. It was always assumed that Claude was
the more intelligent just because he knew more than .Star
bridge about the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the hu
manities, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten
times smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny knots.
But no matter: everybody looked down on “Stupid Sturbric Ige, ’
as they called him and looked up at “Clever Claude,” as they
called him. But who do you think turner! out to be the smart
one when their granny almost got loose and ran away? You
guessed it good old Stupid Sturbridge.
We arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.
One way to deal with this condition is to increase your income.
Mm can, for example, become a fence. Or you win pose for a
life class, if your v< >llege is well heated.
But a better way to handle financial inferiority is to accept
it philosophically. Look on the bright side of poverty. True,
others may have more money than you have, but look at all
the things you have that they don't —debts, for instance, and
hunger cramps.
And wl mt about friendship? You don’t need money to have
friends, and let me tell you something, good people: the older
you get the more you will realize that nothing is so precious as
friendship, and the richest man in the world is the one with
the most money, ® i«oa m,„ si.uiman

other people. This is not so. It must be remembered that there
are different kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the clas
sic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and Sturbridge, stu
dents at Wake Forest. It was always assumed that Claude was
the more intelligent just because he knew more than .Star
bridge about the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the hu
manities, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten
times smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny knots.
But no matter: everybody looked down on “Stupid Sturbric Ige, ’
as they called him and looked up at “Clever Claude,” as they
called him. But who do you think turner! out to be the smart
one when their granny almost got loose and ran away? You
guessed it good old Stupid Sturbridge.
We arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.
One way to deal with this condition is to increase your income.
Mm can, for example, become a fence. Or you win pose for a
life class, if your v< >llege is well heated.
But a better way to handle financial inferiority is to accept
it philosophically. Look on the bright side of poverty. True,
others may have more money than you have, but look at all
the things you have that they don't —debts, for instance, and
hunger cramps.
And wl mt about friendship? You don’t need money to have
friends, and let me tell you something, good people: the older
you get the more you will realize that nothing is so precious as
friendship, and the richest man in the world is the one with
the most money, ® i«oa m,„ si.uiman

INFERIORITY CAN BE FUN
I ho socoml gravest problem confronting college students to
day is inferiority reeling*. (The first gravest problem is of
•■nurse, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority house
canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority
feelings and their possible cures.
Psychologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal
categories:
1. Physical inferiority,
2. Mental inferiority.
3. Financial inferiority.
low there is also a fourth category: ichthyological
inferiority—a feeling that other people have prettier fish -
but I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the
< beat Lakes area.)
Let us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps
the easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined to feel
interior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful home
coining queen. But we should not. look at all the people,
neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their marks in
the world. Look at Napoleon. look at Socrates. Look at
Caesar, look at Lassie.

What I mean is that you can’t always tell what’s inside a
package by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course, you
can , Take M arlboro Cigarettes, for example. .lust one glance
at that jolly red-and-white package—so bright and pert so
neat but not gaudy—so perfectly in place whether you are at
a formal dinner or a beach picnic—so invariably correct for
any time, clime, or condition one look, 1 say, at this paragon
of packs and you know it has to contain cigarettes of absolute
perfection. And you are right! That pure white Marlboro
filter, that fine, flavorful blend of Marlboro tobaccos, will
give you a smoke to make the welkin ring, whatever that is.
So those of you who have just been sitting and admiring your
Marlboro packs since the beginning of the semester, why don’t
you open a pack and light one? Light a cigarette, I mean—
not the package. Then you can settle back and smoke your
Marlboro and. at the same time, continue to gaze rapturously
at the pack. Thus you will be twice as happy as you are if
that is possible.)

low there is also a fourth category: ichthyological
inferiority—a feeling that other people have prettier fish -
but I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the

Let us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps
the easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined to feel
interior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful home
coining queen. But we should not. look at all the people,
neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their marks in
the world. Look at Napoleon. look at Socrates. Look at
Caesar, look at Lassie.

What I mean is that you can’t always tell what’s inside a
package by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course, you
can , Take M arlboro Cigarettes, for example. .lust one glance
at that jolly red-and-white package—so bright and pert so
neat but not gaudy—so perfectly in place whether you are at
a formal dinner or a beach picnic—so invariably correct for
any time, clime, or condition one look, 1 say, at this paragon
of packs and you know it has to contain cigarettes of absolute
perfection. And you are right! That pure white Marlboro
filter, that fine, flavorful blend of Marlboro tobaccos, will
give you a smoke to make the welkin ring, whatever that is.
So those of you who have just been sitting and admiring your
Marlboro packs since the beginning of the semester, why don’t
you open a pack and light one? Light a cigarette, I mean—
not the package. Then you can settle back and smoke your
Marlboro and. at the same time, continue to gaze rapturously
at the pack. Thus you will be twice as happy as you are if
that is possible.)
But 1 digress. Ix»t us turn now to the second category—
mental inferiority. A lot of people think they are dumber tiian
other people. This is not so. It must be remembered that there
are different kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the clas
sic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and Sturbridge, stu
dents at Wake Forest. It was always assumed that Claude was
the more intelligent just because he knew more than .Star
bridge about the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the hu
manities, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten
times smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny knots.
But no matter: everybody looked down on “Stupid Sturbric Ige, ’
as they called him and looked up at “Clever Claude,” as they
called him. But who do you think turner! out to be the smart
one when their granny almost got loose and ran away? You
guessed it good old Stupid Sturbridge.
We arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority.
One way to deal with this condition is to increase your income.
Mm can, for example, become a fence. Or you win pose for a
life class, if your v< >llege is well heated.
But a better way to handle financial inferiority is to accept
it philosophically. Look on the bright side of poverty. True,
others may have more money than you have, but look at all
the things you have that they don't —debts, for instance, and
hunger cramps.
And wl mt about friendship? You don’t need money to have
friends, and let me tell you something, good people: the older
you get the more you will realize that nothing is so precious as
friendship, and the richest man in the world is the one with
the most money, ® i«oa m,„ si.uiman

INFERIORITY CAN BE FUN
I ho socoml gravest problem confronting college students to
day is inferiority reeling*. (The first gravest problem is of

canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority
feelings and their possible cures.
Psychologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal
categories:
1. Physical inferiority,
2. Mental inferiority.
3. Financial inferiority.
