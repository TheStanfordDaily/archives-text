# Abuse of Pep Pills Makes Exam Week a Tragedy, Physician Warns
## 
### WILLIAM REPPY Associate Editor (First of two parts 
Worried about finals last year, a Stanford
coed bought a supply of stimulant stay-awake
pills to help her study. For several days they
worked fine and she crammed and crammed.
Soon she needed more and more pills to fight
off sleep. She took them.

As fatigue began to engulf her, her mind
became confused and she began to suffer
from short term loss of memory. It was the
night before a final. She took a pill; five
minutes later she was tired again. She couldn’t
remember taking the last pill, so she swallow-

Ed another. Five minutes later, tired and for
getful, she took another. In one hour she
took six or seven pills.
SHE DIDN’T make it to that final. Dorm
mates discovered her in her room late the
next morning and called a doctor from the
Health Service. He found her in the condition
of a “waking coma.” "It was as if she had been
hypnotized—eyes wide open staring straight
ahead, unable to respond,” the doctor reported.
The story is true. The doctor was M. M.
Osborne, a director of the Health Service. He
related the story to point out the danger in
stimulant drugs of the amphetamine type—
like dexedrine and benzedrine (i.e. No Doze).
"They are widely used by students,” Dr.
Osborne said. Misused, they are “considerably

dangerous,” and, despite claims to the con
trary, they are habit forming. Because these
drugs can so easily be abused, the Health
Service refuses to dispense them, he explained.
Like the girl who ended up in a coma,
many students who rely on those stimulants
at finals time don’t use moderation; the re
sult is far more harm than benefit to the
users, Dr. Osborne said.
A STUDENT who has been on dexedrine
for many hours goes into a final with “a very
tired brain that won’t work,” he said. Al
though he may not realize it, he is definitely
suffering from fatigue, and the greater the
fatigue the poorer his judgment.
“This student can write an essay that is
just a bunch of nonsense and not be aware of

it; he believes he has written a fine test.”
One boy, suffering acutely from fatigue
after days of taking stay-awake pills, went
into a final and scribbled out his name for
two hours, completely unaware that he wasn’t
writing an A paper.
At an eastern school, a student, also under
influence of drugs, wrote a 10-page exam but
forgot to turn the page of the bluebook. The
result: one giant ink blotch.
EXCESSIVE USE OF stimulant pills causes
these tragic finals by rendering the brain al
most insensitive to various danger signs, for
example, the need to sleep. The mind forgets
the need for caution and loses ability to judge
physical dangers.
Dr. Osborne noted that many truck drivers

take stimulant pills to help stay awake, since
they are paid by the number ol hours they
drive. Under the influence of these drugs, he
noted, drivers have been known to race their
truck at speeds over 100 m.p.h. down the
wrong side of the road. They want to put
miles on the trucks and are oblivious to the
danger they are causing.
The pills dim other brain functions includ
ing the hunger drive, Dr. Osborne said. Am
phetamines have therefore been marketed as
aids in weight reducing, he said, but these are
still dangerous.
Tomorrow: How students come to rely on
stimulant pills for a sense of euphoria—“the
world’s a happy place.” Kick pills and narcotic
addiction.
