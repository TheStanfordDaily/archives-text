# Curriculum Expanded For Summer Term
## 
### RON BASS Contributing Editor 
This year’s Summer Quarter
curriculum is being overhauled in
order to offer all three Western
Civilization courses, a wide range
of introductory courses, and a
varied list of Senior Colloquia.
The purpose of the revision is to
provide a set of solutions to many
problems arising from restrictive
program requirements, according
to Dr. Rodney G, Minott, assistant
director of the summer session.
The chief burden on overcrowd
ed schedules during the regular
academic year is the formidable
list of General Studies require
ments. It will now bo possible to
take all three Western Civiliza
tion courses at once, completing
the entire set in one summer. A
wide range of introductory courses
in Psychology, Economics, Soci
ology, Philosophy and Geology
will also be given for those with
unfulfilled area requirements.
A CONSTANT problem for
seniors has been the difficulty of
gaining admittance to choice Col
loquia. Those who find them
selves on the short end of the
alphabet at Pre-Reg will have a
varied and accessible list of Col
loquia available during the sum
mer. This summer, Dr. Kurt
Reinhardt will offer Existential
Phenomenology and Existential
Psychology, Dr. Minott will offer
History of Militarism in the
West, and the list goes on to such
exotic titles as Absurdity and Re
volt: The Thought of Albert Ca
mus, Relation of Morals to Poli
tics. and Concepts of History in
Fiction,
For graduate students, last

year’s special program series will
be expanded, offering the oppor
tunity to take courses in Con
temporary American Fiction,
Myth and Ritual, English Novel
of the Nineteenth Century, Intro
duction to the Concepts of Phys
ics, or Hawthorne and Melville.

Language requirements may be
filled by courss at several levels
of intensity, from four-unit be
ginners courses, to six-unit courses
for those going overseas in Sep
tember, to twelve-unit intonsives
in French, German, Polish, Rus
sian and Spanish.
In the past, departments have
been slow in naming their facul
ties for the summer. As a result,
Summer Bulletins appeared late
and with many instructors un
named. This year’s Bulletin will
be available February 4. Not only
have departments named their
faculties for this summer, but
they have been asked to do so for
two or three years in advance so
that entering students will be
able to include summer courses in
their long-range schedules.
