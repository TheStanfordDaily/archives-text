# Rushing Confusion
## 
### 
Despite the confusion surrounding rush after the ICC reversed
tlu* recommendation of its President and after the IFC rescinded
its blanket approval of the new rush proposals, one tiling is clear:
any number of student representatives may pass tiny number of
resolutions and still the decision is President Sterling’s, or the
Dean s il the authority is delegated to him.
Students may like or dislike this situation, but their reaction
is irrelevant to tlu* fact of the situation. In the context of fact,
Dean David Larimer’s words are particularly important: if a rea
sonable and harmonious compromise is not worked out between
Wilbur, Stern, the clubs, and the fraternities, an alternative would
be for the Administration to decide upon a policy serving the
needs of the entire campus and then to impose it. Clearly, the
University is determined to alleviate the tensions and disruptions
of the present system, and their determination is admirable. How
ever, in their determination to solve the rushing problem there
is a possibility that the compromises acceptable to the clubs and
fraternities will be forgotten. Some of the conceivable compro
mises have not yet been explored. For instance, Monday night
the ICC voted down the proposal with an amendment allowing
living groups to rush at mealtime during Spring Quarter subject
to two limitations; those restrictions that might be imposed by
the inter-council of the living group and the restriction in number
of rushees (three) permitted to eat at any one meal. Since a
major reason for the ICC vote Monday night lay in this meal sec
tion, an increase in the number of rushees per meal might make
the ICC amenable to the rest of the proposal. The point is, there
are still many avenues to explore.
