Editor, The Daily:
The resignation of Freshman
Coach Dan Stavely is a great loss
to both the Stanford Athletic
Department, and to the Stanford
community as a whole. Coach
Stavely, in ins several years at
Stanford, has set up a recruiting
program that has gained some
top athletes for this University.
His program has given more and
better scholarships to more and
better athletes, and the founda
tions he has laid in high schools
across the country should con
tinue to benefit Stanford with
freshman prospects.
Coach Stavely's interest in each
individual player, however, car
ries beyond that person’s ability
on the football field. Certainly
the type of academic, social, and
athletic encouragement he offers
is fitting to the kind of liberal
education Stanford is trying to
give. As one person who has

greatly benefited from knowing
and working with Dan Stavely. I
would like to express not only my
appreciation to him, but also my
regret that Stanford is losing this
fine individual.
