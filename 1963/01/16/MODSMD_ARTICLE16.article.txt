## 'Undergraduate Training Degraded By Many Larger Universities'

This is part of a larger article
which appeared in the Fall issue
of “Student Government Bulle
tin.”)
What precisely is wrong with
most current higher education?
And how can these deficiencies
he remedied?
It is obviously impossible to go
into the situation in the detail
required in the short space of this
article, but there is one problem
that cries out for mention: the
way in which undergraduate
training is systematically degrad
ed by our institutions of higher
education—and particularly the
larger ones. To an ever-increas
ing extent undergraduate educa
tion is being sacrificed to research
programs, to graduate education,
and, in some cases, to special
honors programs.

It works this way. Consider
some large university-let us call
it “the U.” At the U departments
are typically relatively autono
mous. The administration does
not, in general, help or hinder the
department in its operations. Con
sider a fairly large department
in which X is one of the most dis
tinguished members. X is a schol
ar who has just been granted
$lOO,OOO from the Horde Founda
tion for some basic research. As
a result he will be devoting only
half of his time to teaching. It
has been three years since X last
had an undergraduate in his
class. He is quite content with a
situation in which his graduate
students and less creative col
leagues are largely entrusted
with undergraduate education in
mass lecture courses and infre
quent recitation sections. On the
other hand he devotes himself
diligently to the training (and
cultivation ) of graduate students.
Not only does he have a genuine
affection and concern for their
welfare, but they can be very
helpful to him in pursuit of his
research aims. And not far from
his mind is the awareness that,
though intra-university reputa
tions often depend on popularity
among undergraduates, inter-uni
versity power and prestige de
pend to a much greater extent on
the regard of graduate students.
Moreover, as a result of the con
ditions of the academic market,
his earning power ultimately de
pends more on his inter-univer
sity reputation than on his intra
university reputation. So interest
confirms what scholarly disinter
est suggests—that the right road
is the road which bypasses the
undergraduate and his problems.
The President of the U is, mean
while, beset by severe budgetary
problems. Expenses are rising at

I a faster rate than funds are in-
I creasing. The President must es
tablish priorities for the alloca-
1 1 ion of increasingly scarce re
sources. He realizes that future
availability of resources depends
heavily on the university’s public
image. Of pre-eminent impor
tance in the creation of that im
ago are the fame of his faculty,
| the beauty and adequacy of his
plant, and the establishment of a
reputation for the allocation of
funds on good sound, efficient
{ business principles. He does ev
erything possible to keep the dis
tinguished members of his faculty
—men like X. He is responsive
to the political demand for expan
sion of the U’s student body, and
is not unaffected by the imperial
ambition to CROW just for the
sake of growth. The Trustees of
the U, most of whom are conserv
ative businessmen, are not par
ticularly concerned to interfere in
the operations of the institution
as long as it remains untainted
by notoriety of any sort—especi-

ally political. They have a genu
ine respect for education, and for
a free marketplace of ideas—as
long as their appreciation is not
excessively strained by events.
I hope I have described the U
in sufficient detail to suggest the
formidable forces which work to
degrade undergraduate education.
I do not claim that this pattern
is universal or completely typi
cal —only that it is sufficiently
typical to account for the wide
spread ill with which I am heit?
concerned. I certainly do not wish
to claim that there is any simple
remedy for the resulting situa
tion. Suitable action must com
bine sound educational philoso
phy and policy, a greater sense of
personal responsibility among
those who govern our system,
and increased budgetary alloca
tions. In this establishment of
sound educational policy citizens,
parents, legislators, donors, ad
ministrators, faculty, and stu
dents all have an important role
to play.
