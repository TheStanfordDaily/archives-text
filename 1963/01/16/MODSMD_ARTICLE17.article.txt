## Increased Federal Spending Alternative to Tax Reduction 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Tax reduction first became a big public issue after the break
in the stock market last May. At that time, the indicators which
economists use to make their predictions were pointing downward.
It was generally believed that business would decline toward the
end of summer and that there would probably be another reces-

sion, like the three Eisenhower
recessions, in the late autumn or
early winter.
To avert the threatened reces
sion, a quick tax cut was much
talked about. But while the Pres
ident was interested, he found
that, last summer. Congress
would not vote a tax cut before it
adjourned. At about the same
time, the statistical indicators be
gan to be less gloomy. As it turn
ed out, though business is not
booming, it has been not too bad,
and the threat of a recession this
winter has evaporated.
The effects of this experience
are to be seen in the President’s
message on the State of the Un
ion. Whereas, last summer, he de
cided against a quick tax cut be
cause Congress would not vote it,
now he is making tax reduction
and tax reform the paramount
business before Congress. The
significant fact about all this is
that, though the pressing reasons
advanced last summer for a tax
cut do not at present exist, the
President has committed himself
more deeply than ever to tax re
duction and tax reform. What had
been talked about originally as a
remedy for the emergency of a
recession has now become, in the
absence of a recession, a proposal
for a permanent fiscal policy.
This evolution in the philoso
phy of the tax proposals is highly
significant and also, it seems to
me, constructive and sound. The
problem that has to be solved is
not how to prime the pump when
the business cycle turns down
ward, but how to cure what has
come to be a chronic sluggishness
in the American economy.
This deprives the country of
wealth ami of revenue which it
can Ul-afford to go without. Mili

tary defense is a heavy burden.
We have to pay for it now with
inadequate school buildings and
low teachers’ salaries and urban
congestion and the like. We have
to do this because we do not pro
duce Hie wealth we could produce
to support tile defense we must
have and still meet our other
needs. The burden of taxes feels
heavier than it would feel if we
were producing some $3O to $4O
billion more wealth that we could
produce.
The President is proposing a
tax program which confides the
task of expanding the economy
and stimulating growth to pri
vate enterprise—to private con
sumers, employers and investors
—and there is good reason to be
lieve that it will work.
But, as the President points out
with clarity and candor, tax re
duction and tax reform are not
the only conceivable methods of
promoting economic growth.
There is an alternative method,
which he rejects. This would be
“a massive increase In federal
spending.”
It is a necessary reminder. For
the choice before Congress is not
between the tax program on the
one hand and on the other a con
tented and complacent sluggish
ness. The tasks of the American
nation and the increasing needs
of the people have made the eco
nomic sluggishness an evil and
a peril. The compulsions and the
necessities of our time will de
mand that in one way or in an
other the economy be made to
work at or at least near full
capacity.
