# 'More Laughs in Sequoia Than in Latest Chappie'
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
The Chappie is out today—far
out. Out of touch with what
makes Stanford students laugh.
The Chappie staff has finally run
out of humor. There’s no good
old-fashioned humor and no gross
humor.
Don’t waste your money on this
issue. It’s nothing but junk, pure
and simple. I’m dead serious. If
you are dumb enough to buy a
copy don’t say I didn’t warn you
when you throw it down in dis
gust.
Personally, I think you’d find
more laughs in the Sequoia or
even in Krino—at least they’d be
a hell of a lot more enjoyable
reading. The Chappie apparently
has given up on humor and is try
ing to invade the off-beat literary
field. Two attempts at satire are
OK as far as satire goes (“Mur
der Is My Meat” by H. Kaye and
“The Incredible Bone Marrow
Monster” by B. Efron). But they
aren’t funny in the slightest. You
could find creative writing just
as good by rummaging through
a random selection of English 2
themes. J
The cartoons are worse than
ever. There are some one dozen
stupid drawings by a person called
Kelsie. That’s 12 too many. I’m
serious; they are deplorable.
The short jokes which the
Chappie uses to fill up every is
sue are old and poorly written.
One entire column of drivel on
page 18 is repeated verbatim on
page 33.
The quips advertising the Chap
pie staff on the inside front cover

are repeals from back issues, too.
It’s obvious that you don’t even
get your money’s worth of tripe
in this issue.
This Chappie introduces a new
regular department for the mag
azine called “The Animal Cor
ner.” Let’s pray they are only
kidding when they say it is going
to be a “regular” feature. All it
does is fill up a page with total
nonsense.
If you laugh at anything in this
issue you’d better go join the
Chappie staff or better yet go to
the Health Service, ’cause you are
sick.
I repeat, if you are fool enough
to buy this issue, don’t say I
didn’t warn you.
