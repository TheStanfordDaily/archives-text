Editor, The Daily:
The new rushing proposal now
being considered by President
Sterling and the university has
been advocated as being benefi
cial to the freshmen. It is felt by
some that the seven-week waiting
period and the open contact on
campus winter quarter would en
able prospective pledges to ex
amine more closely their future
living group for the following
throe years. However, we the un
dersigned. all freshmen, feel that
the new proposal, if adopted, will
not be beneficial either to the
fraternities or to the freshmen,
but it will be an unnecessary bur
den for both groups.
The fraternities will be placed
in the undesirable position of
having to host and entertain a
large group of potential pledges
for more than half of the spring
quarter. The prospective pledges
will be completely free to change
their initial choice during these
seven weeks and consequently
the actives will have to spend
more money than in the past if
they want to continue the impres
sion they created during rush
week.

An objection to past rushing
policies was the “rush week false
front” which was necessarily worn
by the fraternities. The advocates
of the new policy feel this will be
eliminated by the seven-week
rush period, thereby allowing the
prospective pledges a longer
chance to survey the fraternities
of their choice. However, open
contact during winter quartet
will give freshmen a good chance
to size up their prospective
houses and eliminate the neces
sity for the seven-week rush pe
riod. We agree rush in spring
quarter should be lengthened to
perhaps two or three weeks, but
seven weeks is much too long.
The only function of rush week
in the new policy should be to ob
serve the social life because the
rest of the house functions can
be surveyed during winter quar
ter.

It must also be considered that
the lengthy rush period, with re
stricted contact, in away under
mines its own effectiveness in
two ways. First, it negates the
prospective pledges’ the oppor
tunity to attend off-campus func
tions, except in three predeter
mined cases: these functions are
an integral part of most fraterni
ties’ social life, an important as
pect for consideration before
pledging. Also, the pledge formal
and pledge class functions will be
forced to be held a mere one or
two weeks before dead week and
finals, which are very important
to a freshman and his academic
standing. It sounds as if the new
policy wishes to dispel the
thoughts of even trying to or
ganize a pledge class.
For these reasons, we, as fresh
men of Cedro House, believe that
the new rushing proposal, as it
stands, would be detrimental
both to the fraternities and to the
freshmen, and we respectfully
urge President Sterling to reject
the rush policy as it has been
presented to him.

being considered by President
Sterling and the university has
been advocated as being benefi
cial to the freshmen. It is felt by
some that the seven-week waiting
period and the open contact on
campus winter quarter would en
able prospective pledges to ex
amine more closely their future
living group for the following
throe years. However, we the un
dersigned. all freshmen, feel that
the new proposal, if adopted, will
not be beneficial either to the
fraternities or to the freshmen,
but it will be an unnecessary bur
den for both groups.
The fraternities will be placed
in the undesirable position of
having to host and entertain a
large group of potential pledges
for more than half of the spring
quarter. The prospective pledges
will be completely free to change
their initial choice during these
seven weeks and consequently
the actives will have to spend
more money than in the past if
they want to continue the impres
sion they created during rush
week.

An objection to past rushing
policies was the “rush week false
front” which was necessarily worn
by the fraternities. The advocates
of the new policy feel this will be
eliminated by the seven-week
rush period, thereby allowing the
prospective pledges a longer
chance to survey the fraternities
of their choice. However, open
contact during winter quartet
will give freshmen a good chance
to size up their prospective
houses and eliminate the neces
sity for the seven-week rush pe
riod. We agree rush in spring
quarter should be lengthened to
perhaps two or three weeks, but
seven weeks is much too long.
The only function of rush week
in the new policy should be to ob
serve the social life because the
rest of the house functions can
be surveyed during winter quar
ter.

It must also be considered that
the lengthy rush period, with re
stricted contact, in away under
mines its own effectiveness in
two ways. First, it negates the
prospective pledges’ the oppor
tunity to attend off-campus func
tions, except in three predeter
mined cases: these functions are
an integral part of most fraterni
ties’ social life, an important as
pect for consideration before
pledging. Also, the pledge formal
and pledge class functions will be
forced to be held a mere one or
two weeks before dead week and
finals, which are very important
to a freshman and his academic
standing. It sounds as if the new
policy wishes to dispel the
thoughts of even trying to or
ganize a pledge class.
For these reasons, we, as fresh
men of Cedro House, believe that
the new rushing proposal, as it
stands, would be detrimental
both to the fraternities and to the
freshmen, and we respectfully
urge President Sterling to reject
the rush policy as it has been
presented to him.
