# LASSU Votes to Put Constitution into Effect
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
The New ASSU Constitution
has been voted into effect by
Legislature, but its formal enact
ment awaits President Sterling’s
approval. The Legislature made
this move in order to facilitate
the seating of the new Legisla
ture to bo elected this month.

In response to requests for in
formation regarding the new con
stitution and the election of mem
bers to the new Legislature, the
following facts have been com
piled:

would become effective when ap
proved by the student body and
President Sterling. Late in fall
quarter the student body ap
proved the new constitution by a
4-1 majority.
President Sterling intends to
wait until the Board of Trustees
