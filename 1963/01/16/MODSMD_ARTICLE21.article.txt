# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Stanford's Tom Dose An All-American? 
### Glenn Alford 
I owe Tom Dose an apology.
This is because of my first reaction to the front cover of the j
Stanford 1962-63 basketball press book. On that cover is a picture of
Stanford’s “Bald Bomber” kneeling alongside Coach Howie Dallmar. j
A caption reads “Stanford All-American Candidate Tom Dose, with j
Head Coach Howie Dallmar.”
I FELT THAT THIS was laying it on too thick. My remem
brances of the Dose of last year’s basketball team were fond, but

fond enough for me to stomach
| his being called an “All-American
■ Candidate.”
The Dose of 1961-62 was a good
| scorer, but inconsistent on de
fense and rebounding. He might
j score 20, but his opposing center
might also score that many and
out-rebound him to boot. This
j sort of play isn't uncommon in
j sophomore centers, but I had
j seen nothing to indicate that Dose
1 would mend his way and become
| the great center that the Stan
! ford press book hopefully said he
j could be.
That I had been wrong in my
i estimation of Dose’s ability was
! evident from the start of the sea
i son. Scoring in bundles every
game, Dose dominated every ear
| ly-season Card contest. The game

that really started to change my p| Q y up to All-American level
thinking was the first Oregon-
Stanford tilt. Dose scored 29, but more important hold Glenn Moore,
a center with a 17-point average, to a trifling three points.

A Question Mark
Even when Stanford made such a poor showing in the Los
Angelos Classic, Dose was the best player on the court all three
games. The two losses in Los Angeles made Stanford a question
mark in the strong AAWU, as the league schedule opened for the
Cards against California at Berkeley.
California was favored to win due to their strong home court
advantage and 6-10 center Camden Wall. Stanford upset the form and
won, and it was in no small measure to Dose’s work both on offense
and defense. Dose hounded Wall from start to finish, and it was only
when he got in foul trouble and had to take it easier defensively that
Wall finally started scoring. Dose was also Stanford’s high scorer
that night with 19 points.
However the topper was yet to come. Oregon State, a team pos
sessing a center who received many more All-American notices than
Dose, was coming to town for a pair of games with Stanford. Dose’s
performance in those two games was more than enough to convince
me of the error of my ways, and that Tom Dose deserved an apology.
Friday night, when Dallmar's strategy was to stop the 7-0 Mel
Counts, Dose sacrificed his scoring potential and held his foe to ten

ten points and only three goals
from the field. Saturday Dallmar
decided to give Counts his 20
points and stop the rest of the
Beavers. Dose successfully forced
his man to take longer shots and
be in poor offensive rebounding
position. With Counts outside,
Dose didn’t have to work as hard
on defense and could devote more
energy to scoring. His 29 points
is testimony that the plan worked
to perfection.
THE INDIANS now sit atop
the Big Six standings. It would
be the height of folly to say all
this is due to one man, but it
would be no more than the truth
to say that without Tom Dose,
All-American, the Indians would
not be occupying their present
exalted position atop the AAWU.
