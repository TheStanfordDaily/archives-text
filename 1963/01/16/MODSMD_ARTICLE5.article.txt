# U.S. Spy Corps Must Challenge Reds, Says Triska

### STEVE LEOPOLD 
The United States must chal
lenge the Soviet Union on all
fronts of the diplomatic Cold
War. especially in the area of un
derground intelligence, if we wish
to win the Cold War, warned Dr.
Jan Triska of the Political Sci
ence department yesterday at
Tresidder Memorial Union.

Triska used the hypothesis
that in a conventional, or in this
case, a Cold War, well-matched
enemies must employ the same
weapons system to avoid defeat.
He outlined the “trinity” of Rus
sia’s foreign policy, explaining
W'hy and where we should imitate
it.

TWO METHODS of Soviet
diplomacy are neither new nor
essentially dangerous, according
to Triska. One is the use of con
ventional diplomacy, governed by
the rules of the Congress of Vi
enna in 1815. The other is what
the Soviets call “open diplomacy,”
wherein the communists attempt
to use the United Nations, sum
mit conferences, and other inter
national organizations to spread
their propaganda line on the
“peace-loving” nature of the So
viet Union.
It is on the third front, said
Triska, that we should imitate
the Soviet method. This is the
underground intelligence corps,
of which little is known except
from information obtained from
defecting Soviet agents.

The base of Soviet subversion
in every country is the Russian
Embassy along with (he sister
Permanent Trade Delegation;
these two groups have more peo
ple on their “declared staffs”
than any other similar organiza
tion in the world. All of these
people wore trained at the Insti
tute of International Relations in
Moscow, where students study
eight hours a day and six days a
a week for six years.
THIS “SCHOOL of schemers”
turns out a “veritable armada of
spies and agents to permeate and
penetrate the countries of the
world,” explained Triska. “Each
graduate is a well-trained, dedicat
ed, and skilled professional.”
In our own Central Intelligence
Agency today between 20 and 30
thousand people are employed. Its
budget is $1 billion a year.
