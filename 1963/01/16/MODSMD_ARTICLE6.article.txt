ELISABETHVILLE—President Moise Tshombe announced the
end of Katanga’s secession from the Congo Tuesday. He said he was
surrendering his last stronghold of Kolwezi to United Nations
forces
Tshombe, in a note to the United Nations, asked for truce talks
and demanded amnesty for himself and his followers. The United
Nations announced that a previous Congolese government guarantee
of amnesty for Tshombe still held good.
But observers in Elisabethviile noted that Tshombe had made
promises in the past and broken them.
Despite Tshombe’s action there was no guarantee that soldiers
guarding the Kolwezi stronghold would give it up without a fight.
In Leopoldville yesterday, an enraged mob of more than 800
screaming Congolese burst into the British embassy, ransacked
offics, smashed windows and injured an embassy official. The rioters
were protesting Britain’s opposition to the U.N.’s use of military
force to end Katanga’s secession.
