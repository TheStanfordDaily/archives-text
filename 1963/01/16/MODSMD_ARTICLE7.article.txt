# Bloch Describes Development And History of Atomic Theory

### NORMAN REITZ 
“At the beginning of this cen
tury atoms were accepted as a
reality,” declared physics profes
sor Felix Bloch in his lecture last
night, “Half a Century of Atomic
Physics.”
But he further explained, “It
took no less than the greatest
necessity and the bravest daring
to open up the field of atomic
physics."
THE FIRST breakthrough.
Bloch said, came in 1900 when
Max Planck discovered that light
was made up of small bits of
energy called photons. This added
credence to the notion that mat
ter and energy could be quantized
or brokn down into small indi
visible units, he said.
Ernest Rutherford took the
next step, Bloch said, when he
discovered that the atom had a
structure similar to our solar
system. Rutherford conceived of
the atom as a dense nucleus sur
rounded by a cloud of moving
particles.
The major contribution was
made by Niels Bohr when he
combined Plank’s quantization
principle and Rutherford’s atomic
structure. Bohr hypothesized that
energy in the form of light or
X-rays was radiated when the
moving particles, now known as

electrons, shifted orbits in their
trips around the nucleus.
THE MOTION of the electrons
was further clarified by the prob
ability principle. The electron can
be located only with a certain
probability. The exclusion princi
ple showed that no two electrons,
spinning in the same direction,
can occupy the same orbit.
Bloch explained by analogy the
exclusion principle. “It is impos
sible to have two people sit in
the same chair unless they are of
the opposite sex.”
“The peaceful and non-peaceful
uses of atomic energy affect all
men. The world around us. and
we in it, form one entity,” said
Bloch.

The discoveries in atomic phys
ics cannot be isolated. Bloch con
cluded with the statement of
Niels Bohr, “Indeed, the problem
of the unity of knowledge can
hardly be separated from the
striving for universal understand
ing as a means of elevating hu
man culture.”
