# Non-Sectarianism Again to Concern Trustees, Students
## 
### 
The opinion is being voiced in
several circles that the present
nonsectarian policy of Stanford
with its interdenominational Me
morial Church is not enough to
meet the growing religious inter
est and the diversity of beliefs at
Stanford.
The whole issue of the non
sectarian position as it stands in
the Founding Grant has been the
topic of recent discussions of the
Committee on Student Services
and Affairs and the Board of
Trustees. The purpose of the
Committee’s discussions has been
in part to clarify present Univer
sity policy regarding religion at
Stanford. ASSU President Armin
Rosencranz said, “Past interpre
tations of the Founding Grant
tend to suggest a more restrictive
position, but the nature and ex
tent of those restrictions need to
be made clear.”
A 1902 AMENDMENT to the
Grant declares that “The Univer
sity must be forever maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and
non-sectarian basis. .. . the
moral and religious development
of the University will be better
accomplished if entirely free
from all denominational alli
ances ...”

Chuck Bischoff, a member of
the Student Affairs Committee,
has raised several questions as to
the meaning of these provisions.
In a discussion outline presented
to the Committee, he asks if pos
sibly the non-sectarian provision
applies to the University as an
institution, but not to the stu
dents themselves; if possibly the
prohibition on "denominational
alliances” means allowing sectari
an religious privileges on a non
discriminatory basis instead of
allowing no privileges at all.
There is some feeling that stu
dents should be allowed to pur
sue their religious interests with
in the Stanford “community.”
The building of a pan-sectarian
“Church House” has been pro
posed where denominations could
hold meetings on the campus and
where sectarian pastors could
meet with individual students on
an informal basis.
In lino with the most recent in
terpretation of the Founding
Grant, interdenominational meet
ings are permissablc. But the use
of University buildings for sec
tarian meetings of any kind has
been firmly opposed. It is this in
terpretation which is now being
questioned.

sue their religious interests with
in the Stanford “community.”
The building of a pan-sectarian
“Church House” has been pro
posed where denominations could
hold meetings on the campus and
where sectarian pastors could
meet with individual students on
an informal basis.
In lino with the most recent in
terpretation of the Founding
Grant, interdenominational meet
ings are permissablc. But the use
of University buildings for sec
tarian meetings of any kind has
been firmly opposed. It is this in
terpretation which is now being
questioned.
The opinion is being voiced in
several circles that the present
nonsectarian policy of Stanford
with its interdenominational Me
morial Church is not enough to
meet the growing religious inter
est and the diversity of beliefs at
Stanford.
The whole issue of the non
sectarian position as it stands in
the Founding Grant has been the
topic of recent discussions of the
Committee on Student Services
and Affairs and the Board of
Trustees. The purpose of the
Committee’s discussions has been
in part to clarify present Univer
sity policy regarding religion at
Stanford. ASSU President Armin
Rosencranz said, “Past interpre
tations of the Founding Grant
tend to suggest a more restrictive
position, but the nature and ex
tent of those restrictions need to
be made clear.”
A 1902 AMENDMENT to the
Grant declares that “The Univer
sity must be forever maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and
non-sectarian basis. .. . the
moral and religious development
of the University will be better
accomplished if entirely free
from all denominational alli
ances ...”

Chuck Bischoff, a member of
the Student Affairs Committee,
has raised several questions as to
the meaning of these provisions.
In a discussion outline presented
to the Committee, he asks if pos
sibly the non-sectarian provision
applies to the University as an
institution, but not to the stu
dents themselves; if possibly the
prohibition on "denominational
alliances” means allowing sectari
an religious privileges on a non
discriminatory basis instead of
allowing no privileges at all.
There is some feeling that stu
dents should be allowed to pur
sue their religious interests with
