### PELL FENDER 
An evaluation of the attitudes toward, the requirements of, and
the problems facing academic freedom, as it applies to past and
present universities, was the subject of Dr. Philip Rhinelander’s

speech last night at Tresidder.
Although the "authoritarian”
approach to education has been
considered, negative and positive
“tolerance” have been and are the
conflicting attitudes which decide
whether or not valid, though un
orthodox, opinions are permitted
in universities which strive to
ward academic freedom. Dr.
Rhinelander lectured. “Any real
effective definition ... of aca
demic freedom . . . requires the
conviction that unorthodoxy, or
the while, is a positive good.”
UK. RHINELANDER proceed
ed to outline a sketch of the his
tory of academic freedom as it
evolved from medieval times to
the present, noting that every
university must face the three
problems which are adamant to
its effective operation: (1) the
freedom of a university to estab
lish its principles without inter
ference, (2) the freedom of a stu
dent to act and study purpose
fully, and, (3) the freedom of a
faculty member to search and re
search without (he detriment of
close scrutinization.
UK STRESSED the importance
of this third freedom as necessary
for an academic society which is
conducive to important and pro
gressive results in scholastic
fields. In closing, Dr. Rhineland
er discussed some still-unsolved
problems which block total aca
demic freedom, and reiterated the
need for a corroboration of the
academic and “practical” commu
nities.
