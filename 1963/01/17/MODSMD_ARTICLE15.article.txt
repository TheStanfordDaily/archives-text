## Strong Congo Government Requires Riches of Katanga 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
We know from experience that in the Congo a settlement,
which looks as if it were just around the corner, usually turns out
to be a long way off. So it is with the United Nations police action
which Tshombe or perhaps his subordinates provoked before the
United Nations had completed the military buildup planned for

January. <
The mineral wealth of the prov
ince of Katanga is very great.
Mr. Colin Legion says that Ka
tanga produces some 8 per cent
of the world's copper. 60 per cent
of the uranium of the Western
World, 73 per cent of the world’s
cobalt, 80 per cent of its industri
al diamonds as well as important
quantities of gold, zinc, manga
nese and many other rare metals.
Although Katanga has only 12
per cent of the population of the
Congo, it produces 60 per cent of
the revenues. The mining wealth
of Katanga is controlled in the
main by Belgian and British in
terests, though there are some
American shareholders.
The central fact in the problem
of the Congo is that, without the
revenues from Katanga, the rest
of the Congo is doomed to misery
and backwardness and to the sav
agery that they will produce.
The international significance
of Katanga can best be appreci
ated by looking at the map which
shows that the richest part of Ka
tanga borders on Northern Rho
desia and Portuguese Angola. If
Katanga is able to secede, it will
become a theater of struggle be
tween that region of Africa which
is still under the control of white
men and Black Africa which is
now composed of independent
states.
THESE ARE facts which have
to be kept in mind when we think
about the United Nations opera
tion and the backing of that oper
ation by the United States. In
1960, with the blessing of Presi
dent Eisenhower, the United Na
tions under the leadership of Dag
Hammarskjold made the hard
and dangerous decision to inter
vene with United Nations troops
drawn from counti’ies which were

not aligned with NATO, the War
saw Pact or Red China. The Con
go had been “liberated,” in fact
cast off, before any serious effort,
had been made to prepare the
Congolese for self-government.
The immediate result of this pre
mature independence was chaos
and massacre. Who should re
store order? Belgium, Britain,
France and the United States?
There is no doubt that the Soviet
Union would have insisted on in
tervening also.
So, although Lumumba’s gov
ernment appealed to President
Eisenhower for military aid, we
turned to the United Nations as
the best hope of restoring order
and of keeping the Congo from
becoming a cockpit of the cold
war. This initial task was carried
out successfully. But it was at
once plain that the Congo would
fall into chaos unless a reason
ably strong government, using
European technicians, was estab
lished. It was evident, however,
that such a strong government
was impossible if Katanga, with
its riches, seceded from the Con
go and in effect joined the White
Rhodesians, the Portuguese and
the South Africans.
For this would make the rest
of the Congo ungovernable. It
would provoke a race war in Af
rica. It would invite Soviet or
Chinese intervention. It would
bring the United States to the
brink of a nasty tropical war.
Both Eisenhower and Kennedy
have taken the position that, in
the circumstances, the best hope
and the best bet lay in the United
Nations.

We know from experience that in the Congo a settlement,
which looks as if it were just around the corner, usually turns out
to be a long way off. So it is with the United Nations police action
which Tshombe or perhaps his subordinates provoked before the
United Nations had completed the military buildup planned for

January. <
The mineral wealth of the prov
ince of Katanga is very great.
Mr. Colin Legion says that Ka
tanga produces some 8 per cent
of the world's copper. 60 per cent
of the uranium of the Western
World, 73 per cent of the world’s
cobalt, 80 per cent of its industri
al diamonds as well as important
quantities of gold, zinc, manga
nese and many other rare metals.
Although Katanga has only 12
per cent of the population of the
Congo, it produces 60 per cent of
the revenues. The mining wealth
of Katanga is controlled in the
main by Belgian and British in
terests, though there are some
American shareholders.
The central fact in the problem
of the Congo is that, without the
revenues from Katanga, the rest
of the Congo is doomed to misery
and backwardness and to the sav
agery that they will produce.
The international significance
of Katanga can best be appreci
ated by looking at the map which
shows that the richest part of Ka
tanga borders on Northern Rho
desia and Portuguese Angola. If
Katanga is able to secede, it will
become a theater of struggle be
tween that region of Africa which
is still under the control of white
men and Black Africa which is
now composed of independent
states.
THESE ARE facts which have
to be kept in mind when we think
about the United Nations opera
tion and the backing of that oper
ation by the United States. In
1960, with the blessing of Presi
dent Eisenhower, the United Na
tions under the leadership of Dag
Hammarskjold made the hard
and dangerous decision to inter
vene with United Nations troops
drawn from counti’ies which were

not aligned with NATO, the War
saw Pact or Red China. The Con
go had been “liberated,” in fact
cast off, before any serious effort,
had been made to prepare the
Congolese for self-government.
The immediate result of this pre
mature independence was chaos
and massacre. Who should re
store order? Belgium, Britain,
France and the United States?
There is no doubt that the Soviet
Union would have insisted on in
tervening also.
So, although Lumumba’s gov
ernment appealed to President
Eisenhower for military aid, we
turned to the United Nations as
the best hope of restoring order
and of keeping the Congo from
becoming a cockpit of the cold
war. This initial task was carried
out successfully. But it was at
once plain that the Congo would
fall into chaos unless a reason
ably strong government, using
European technicians, was estab
lished. It was evident, however,
that such a strong government
was impossible if Katanga, with
its riches, seceded from the Con
