Editor, The Daily:
I have contemplated writing
this letter for a week but, because
I am not given to preaching
moral righteousness, had not.
However, a very small notice in
the “Want Ads” offering a re
ward for the return of a term pa
per from English 141 impelled me
to write. I had a sympathetic re
sponse to this ad because my
paper for 141 was also taken, and
I too would very much like it
back. But to have to pay for an
ad and hope that the offer of a
rewai’d will get the paper re
turned is indicative of a very
shabby state of human nature at
Stanford. I understand that about
eight papers for 141 were taken
and from a moral standpoint can
do no more than condemn this

form of academic dishonesty as
perhaps the most appalling.
When one cheats on an exam one
cheats oneself, but taking an
other’s paper cheats someone else
who has put extensive time, ef
fort and thought into the work.
From a personal standpoint the
loss of the paper is great: not
only do I lose the benefit of see
ing the criticisms and comments
of the pi’ofessor and lose the sat
isfaction of just having the pa
per, but also lose the value of
having the paper for future refer
ence which to an English major
and future teacher is important.
I can only hope that my paper
and any others taken were only
“borrowed” and will reappear in
the professor’s box from which
they were “borrowed.”
