# BEN BELLA: 'GENIUS'
## 'Optimistic Attitude toward Future Algeria's Greatest Human Resource' 
### GARY A. PATTON Stanford-in-France 
No longer does one find, every
day, news of Algeria given a
prominent place in the French
press; instead, France's attention
has shifted to recent develop
ments in Anglo-U.S.-Common
Market relationships—“l’affaire
Skybolt”—and Algeria has re
entered the relative obscurity it
enjoyed before 1954.
The Algerians care little for the
loss of their Continental audi
ence; they are intent, as they are
quick to inform the visitor, on
preparing for the future, a future
they await with some confidence.
That this optimism may be un
warranted is a distinct possibili
ty, and it is interesting to exam
ine an Algerian evaluation of Al
geria’s prospects, for contrast
with an “unnationalized” view.
IT IS WELL to note, in the first
place, that as far as statistics are
concerned the Algerians do not
deceive themselves at all. The Al
gerian “common man” acknowl
edges that at present almost one
half of the population is unem
ployed and that these are kept
from starvation largely through
the U.S. surplus foods program.
They point out. in addition,
that the age distribution of the
population is very unfavorable,
with somewhere between 35 and
50 per cent of the population be
ing less than 25 years old, and
they don’t try to deny that 77 per
cent of Algeria’s land area must
he classified as “waste.” The un
fortunate fact that most Algeri
ans are uneducated, many illiter
ate, is also recognized as a tre
mendous liability, yet neverthe
less the Algerian people look for
a “new Algeria” in the very fore
seeable future: five to ten years.
The origins of this optimism
are not hard to divine. The driv
ing Arab nationalism of the Al
gerians succeeded in gaining in
dependence for the country, and
having endured a bitter, seven
year war, there seems to be no
reason to the Algerians that the
country should fail in extending
its external influence and achiev
ing interna] stability and advance
ment.

THE PRIDE which Algerians
take in Algeria is obvious: now
that independence has been won,
each Algerian is credited with a
share in the military part of the
victory; former soldiers are quite

ready to enumerate the French
men they have killed. Moreover,
Ben Bella—called "more or less
of a political genius” by the U.S.
Consul in Oran—and his policy of
national self-confidence are sup
ported by the huge majority of
his countrymen. His recent pro
nouncements on the political sit
uations in Yemen and Angola
have been well received, and his
sole opposition seems to stem
from a small segment of “intel
lectuals,” who deplore his lack of
higher education.
But it would be wrong to as
sume that the optimism found
throughout Algeria is simply a
hollowheaded, if natural, re
sponse to the outcome of the war
and the proud stance assumed by
Pi’esident Ben Bella. Rather, this
confidence is based on a positive
look at the future, which empha
sizes what can be done, not what
will be hard to do, and it is this
attitude of “all things possible”
that is Algeria’s greatest human
resource at this moment.

Wherever one travels, the peo
ple will regretfully point out the
obstructions which block Alge
ria’s progress, saying, “this is a
great handicap.” But they will
quickly add that measures are
being taken to overcome these ob
stacles. Is half the population un
employed? They will soon find
work in stale-directed construc
tion programs. What of the age
distribution of the population?
“In Algeria all are the young,”
they admit, and this means a
source of capable, productive
workers in a few years. What of
the terrible educational deficien
cies in Algeria? Teachers are al
ready anxious to come to Algeria,
where the pay is higher, for in
stance, than in France, and spe
cialists of all kinds will find the
same monetary encouragements.
SOON ALSO, the many stu
dents that have been studying
overseas will return, either to be
come teachers or doctors, scien
tists, or engineers. Besides, the
Algerians point out, the Evian
agreements concluded with
F'rance were quite favorable to
Algeria, and the country has both
oil and pan-Arabian friendship
for sustenance.

It is certain that the problems
to be surmounted are great, sure
ly greater than many Algerians
realize, yet they can be overcome
if a policy of austerity and con
certed purpose is initiated, and

if the problems are met with the
positive confidence and willing
ness to work that typifies Algeri
an attitudes now.

Of course, Algeria has not yet
failed, and winter is upon us, a
winter in which food riots might
be expected if the distribution of
surplus foods breaks down. It re
mains to be seen how Algeria
will meet the trials which are
sure to come. It remains to be
seen if the country will direct its
resources into needed and worth
while endeavors, and surely M.
Ben Bella’s recent promise to An
gola that if the U.N. does not
intervene there in 1963, “Algeria
will take upon herself to aid the
liberation movements in then
armed struggle,” does not lead
one to believe that it necessarily
will.

IF ALGERIA makes the right
choices in its allocation of re
sources, if the Algerian people
remain content to work, with few
immediate, tangible rewards, and
if the belief that “all things are
possible” continues to be held by
the majority of Algerian people,
then Algeria’s new years should
be happy ones. If not, the road
may he a rocky one, leading no
where.
