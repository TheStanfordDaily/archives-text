# PENN. PROFESSOR:
## '62 Campus Censorship Rivaled Previous Years 
### 
“Campus censorship in 1962
easily rivaled that of any previous
year. From coast to coast, and
particularly in the Midwest, stu
dent bodies were quarantined
from a variety of political here
sies.” This statement was made
by Professor William W. Van
Alstyne of Ohio State University
Law School in the January issue
of the “University of Pennsyl
vania Law Review.” Professor
Van Alstyne’s article considers
the extent to which the Constitu
tion restricts the right of state
university officials to bar contro
versial speakers from campus.
The author points out that "a
considerable number of guest lec
turers, formally invited to state
university campuses by recog
nized student organizations, have
been turned away by members of
the administration. It is signifi
cant that those f to whom the stu
dents were forbidden to listen
were very often unpopular fig
ures.”

CERTAIN organizations, such
as the American Civil Liberties
Union, the National Student As
sociation, and the American Asso
ciation of University Professors,
have strenuously objected to this
state of affairs. The latter two or
ganizations have based their ar
guments essentially on policy
grounds, and not on constitution
al rights. The American Bar As
sociation’s Committee on the Bill
of Rights, however, "is of the
opinion that ‘no question of the
Bill of Rights is involved’ whore
university officials decide that
spokesmen for the Communist
party shall be denied access to
university facilities ordinarily
available for guest speakers.”
But Professor Van Alstyne
takes issue with this position. He
argues that much of what the
NSA and AAUP urge on policy
grounds is in fact fully supported
by constitutional mandates. It is
the thesis of his Article that “the
ABA Committee’s position with
regard to Communist speakers is
wrong. Settled principles of con
stitutional law require a liberality
in state university rules dealing
with guest speakers far beyond
what that Committee suggests or
what currently prevails on many
campuses.”
After describing the prevailing
Supreme Court test dealing with
the suppression of speech, the
author points out that “Universi

ties have experienced difficulty
with both parts of the test. They
have improperly identified the
kinds of evils that are constitu
tionally within their power to
prevent, and have failed to devel
op conclusive standards by w’hich
to isolate speakers whose pres
ence on campus will probably in
cite violence.”

Professor Van Alstyne’s major
objection is that state universities
decide to bar speakers on the ba
sis of their affiliations rather
than the content of the speech
they would deliver on a given oc
casion. He argues that a ban on
speech must be based on the con
tent of the proposed address rath
er than (he speaker’s background.
According to the author, a state
university may only bar a guest
speaker if the assembly which
gathers to hear him “will intoler
ably burden the school’s facili
ties.” Burden, in turn, is to be
judged on the basis of the time,
place, and manner of the pro
posed speech.
In conclusion, Professor Van
Alstyne states: “Universities
would render a far greater serv
ice by abandoning substantive
limitations on guest speakers al
together. Any other policy neces
sarily expresses a skepticism of
student intelligence and fear of
the appeal of today’s social crit
ics. Both inferences are contrary
to the categorical imperatives of
a free society.”

dents were forbidden to listen
were very often unpopular fig
ures.”

CERTAIN organizations, such
as the American Civil Liberties
Union, the National Student As
sociation, and the American Asso
ciation of University Professors,
have strenuously objected to this
state of affairs. The latter two or
ganizations have based their ar
guments essentially on policy
grounds, and not on constitution
al rights. The American Bar As
sociation’s Committee on the Bill
of Rights, however, "is of the
opinion that ‘no question of the
Bill of Rights is involved’ whore
university officials decide that
spokesmen for the Communist
party shall be denied access to
university facilities ordinarily
available for guest speakers.”
But Professor Van Alstyne
takes issue with this position. He
argues that much of what the
NSA and AAUP urge on policy
grounds is in fact fully supported
by constitutional mandates. It is
the thesis of his Article that “the
ABA Committee’s position with
regard to Communist speakers is
wrong. Settled principles of con
stitutional law require a liberality
in state university rules dealing
with guest speakers far beyond
what that Committee suggests or
what currently prevails on many
campuses.”
After describing the prevailing
Supreme Court test dealing with
the suppression of speech, the
author points out that “Universi

ties have experienced difficulty
with both parts of the test. They
have improperly identified the
kinds of evils that are constitu
tionally within their power to
prevent, and have failed to devel
op conclusive standards by w’hich
to isolate speakers whose pres
ence on campus will probably in
cite violence.”

Professor Van Alstyne’s major
objection is that state universities
decide to bar speakers on the ba
sis of their affiliations rather
than the content of the speech
they would deliver on a given oc
casion. He argues that a ban on
speech must be based on the con
tent of the proposed address rath
er than (he speaker’s background.
According to the author, a state
university may only bar a guest
speaker if the assembly which
gathers to hear him “will intoler
ably burden the school’s facili
ties.” Burden, in turn, is to be
judged on the basis of the time,
place, and manner of the pro
posed speech.
In conclusion, Professor Van
Alstyne states: “Universities
would render a far greater serv
ice by abandoning substantive
limitations on guest speakers al
together. Any other policy neces
sarily expresses a skepticism of
student intelligence and fear of
the appeal of today’s social crit
ics. Both inferences are contrary
to the categorical imperatives of
a free society.”
“Campus censorship in 1962
easily rivaled that of any previous
year. From coast to coast, and
particularly in the Midwest, stu
dent bodies were quarantined
from a variety of political here
sies.” This statement was made
by Professor William W. Van
Alstyne of Ohio State University
Law School in the January issue
of the “University of Pennsyl
vania Law Review.” Professor
Van Alstyne’s article considers
the extent to which the Constitu
tion restricts the right of state
university officials to bar contro
versial speakers from campus.
The author points out that "a
considerable number of guest lec
turers, formally invited to state
university campuses by recog
nized student organizations, have
been turned away by members of
the administration. It is signifi
cant that those f to whom the stu
dents were forbidden to listen
were very often unpopular fig
