# 'Disarm to Avoid Total Destruction

### WENDY DORTORT 
“The twentieth century may be
remembered as the century of
total destruction," stated Robert
E. Matteson. senior advisor to the
director of the U.S. Disarmament
Agency, in a speech last night at
Tresidder on “Disarmament Pros
pects After Cuba.”
Matteson said that both the
Soviet and the American people
want peace, but their respective
governments must prepare for
war. They are doing so by en
gaging in an arms race which
must inevitably lead to war. Dis
armament is no longer merely a
utopian ideal, but a necessity if
war is to be avoided.
At present, stated Matteson, we
are living under an uneasy peace
preserved by a balance of terror
in which a move by either side
may well doom both to destruc
tion. He said that disarmament
is a complicated, difficult, and
challenging problem requiring
more effective research and study
and more communication between
governments.
He said we must think beyond
our national security to a world
community: “Man must have
faith in his ability to control sci
ence and technical innovations
and to create effective institu
tions for world peace.”
