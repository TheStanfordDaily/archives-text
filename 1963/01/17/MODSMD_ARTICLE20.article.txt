Editor, The Daily:
The stench of the current Chap
arral pervades the room as we
write this protest. What justifica
tion can the Hammer and Coffin
society offer? The decline in taste
begun in the October issue has
reached a shameful level. It is dis
graceful that this university can
offer no better humor magazine.
Smut has a doubtful place in good
satire, especially when approach
ed in dime-novel fashion. It is
time a more sophisticated group
represent Stanfordâ€™s sense of hu
mor.
