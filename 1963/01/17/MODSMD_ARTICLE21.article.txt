## EEC's Trade Has Increased By 70 Percent

The modifications of European
economic development brought
about by the Europaen Economic
Community explain in a certain
measure the prosperity of Eu
rope and the deep transforma
tions which have intervened in all
European activity since the
Treaty of Rome.

I don’t want here to discuss to
what extent exactly this prosperi
ty is due to the EEC or to
other factors, but only to recall
some figures.
SINCE the beginning of the
Common Market, the European
industrial output has increased
twice as quickly as that of the
United States. In the first six
months of 1961, the industrial out
put of the Community was 30
per cent greater than in 1958 (in
the United States it has increased
by 15 per cent and in Great Brit
ain by 17 per cent).
Among the factors which ex
plain this augmentation, three
are important: the development
of intercommunitary exchanges,
the dynamism of the economic
world (willing to face the chal
lenge of the Common Market»
and the in flow of foreign capital,
attracted by the new European
prospects.
Within the Community, trade
has increased by 70 per cent; the
exchanges, if we compare to 1958
were increased by 24 per cent in
1959, 52 per cent in 1960 and 71
per cent in 1961. The French ex
ports to the other five countries
of the community have doubled
in four years, and the part played
by EEC countries in the total of
French exports has increased
from 32 to 46 per cent. And this
augmentation of intracommunity
trade has not induced a decrease
in the exchanges with the rest of
(he world which on the contrary
have increased.
IN THE SIX countries of “Lit
tle Europe” the producers have
adapted themselves to the Euro
pean scale. So many common or
ganizations have been created to
exchange information and to solve
common production problems.
At the same time, the competi
tion has become sharper, but also
the obligations have increased in
their intensity. However, a gen
eral result seems to have been a
remarkable effort on the part of
the producers, of streamlining
and modernization, and invest
ments have increased to improve
productivity.
At last, foreign investments
have been attracted and other
countries want to participate in
the experience. The United States
is interested (the American busi
nessmen being a good market for
the sale of their products) and
Great Britain and other European
countries have asked to enter in.
Some months ago an agreement
was reached between (he six and
the African countries (French
speaking Africa) about economic
cooperation.
THIS recourse looks good; but
severe problems are still to be
solved, in the near future, and
almost everything depends upon
the entry or the non-entry of
Great Britain.
The most interesting problems
could be those of which the Hall
stein Commission recently has
studied: the undertaking of Eu
ropean economic planning and the
creation of a monetary union in
three or four years.
