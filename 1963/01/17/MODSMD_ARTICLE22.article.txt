# Indian Matmen Best in Ten Years But Must Face Burly Opposition
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Stanford’s wrestlers may not
have too much varsity experi
ence, hut they seem to have plen
ty of talent. Although the squad
is composed almost entirely of
sophomores and juniors, coach
Jim Easter has called this sea
son’s matmen “the best Stanford
wrestling team in ten years.”

In their first two matches, the
Indians looked every bit that
good, shutting out Santa Clara,
34 0, last Thursday, and beating
Moffett Field, 31-7, Saturday.
Moffett's only scoring came on a
forfeit in the 137-pound class and
on a draw in heavyweight.

However, the Indians’ opposi
tion is probably going to get
stronger as the season pro
gresses, with Stanford’s toughest
matches scheduled against Cal

Poly (San Luis Obispo), January
19, Oregon State, February 8, and
San Jose State. February 13.
Coach Easter regards the Cards
as strongest in the 147- and 157-
pound classifications. The In
dians' 157-pounder, junior co-cap
tain Phil Kendall has the best var
sity record. Last year, Kendall
went unbeaten in individual meets
and finished third in the PCIWA.
The 147-poundes, junior Dan Bar
rett, won his opening match at
137, but since then has moved up
to the heavier classification.
Other Indian wrestlers include
George Musser at 123 pounds,
Tim Davis at 130, John Kay and
John Cannon at 107, Rich Schaf
fer and John Trachta at 177, Tom
Allen at 191 and Marshall How
ard at heavyweight. Indicative of
the squad’s youth, all of these are
either juniors or sophomores.
