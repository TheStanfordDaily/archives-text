# Domestic Footballers, Foreign Talent Combine to Form Strong Rugby Squad
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
Sixty players who have turned
out this quarter for varsity and
JV rugby will finally see the
fruits of (heir practice labors as
the Stanford rugby season begins
this Saturday against the Olym
pic Club of San Francisco.
Rugby is a major amateur
sport in a large portion of west
ern Europe: it once even reached
the proportions in California of
displacing collegiate football,
from 1906 to 1917, when football
injuries provoked some bad feel
ings toward the American game.
Rugby was permanently revived
at Stanford as a non-NCAA sport
in 1930.
THIS YKAR Stanford is bless
ed with an outstanding player
who knows rugby as his national
game. He is Gordon Waddell, a
grad student from Scotland in the
Business School. Waddell was
captain of the Cambridge Rugby
Club and, more impressive,
played as a back on the Scottish
international team, i.e., the “All-
Scotch team’’ against England,
Wales, France, and other national
all-star squads.

For the rest of the team coach
Pete Kmetovich relies on men
who have played no rugby out
side of Stanford but many of
whom have had extensive experi
ence in football. Their skills are
quite transferable as rugby is
described as a combination of
football and soccer. The game
was accidentally invented, so the
traditional explanation goes,
when a frustrated soccer player
picked up the ball and ran with
it in Rugby, England.
TWO VETERAN Stanford rug
gers and ex-footballers are Troy
Barbee and Randy Vahan, who
have played the game for five and
three years respectivly. They play
in two of the eight scrum posi
tions which correspond roughly
to linemen in football. The scrum
men must jump, shove, and
scramble to retrieve the ball from
set scrums and lineouts (which
approximate tip-offs and inbound
plays in basketball) and are also
the first line of tackling defense;
however, no blocking is allowed in
rugby. Others in the scrum, all
over 230 pounds, are Dick Leeu
wenberg, A1 Hildebrand, Chuck
Buehler, Dick Agnich, Tom Fort
man, and Randy Devening.

Three players on the periphery
of the scrum are breakaways Tim
Hansel and Frank Patitucci and
scrum back Steve Pursell.

THE BACKS, who primarily
pass or run with the ball in at
tempting to get a 3-point try tthe
equivalent of a touchdown), are
Waddell, Bob Price, Clark Weav
er, Brad Freeman, Hal Steuber,
and Braden Beck. Beck is also the
team’s top kicker, and thus the
team’s leading scorer, on 2-point
conversions and 3-point penalty
and drop kicks through goal
posts.

The last line of defense on the
15-man team is provided by the
fullback, who often punts the
ball out of dangerous territory.
This position will be filled by Jim
Lynden.

The Indian ruggers will com
pete in the Northern California
Rugby Union which also includes
California, USF, the Olympic
Club, the Universities Club, and
the Peninsula Ramblers, plus two
schools which compete only on
the JV level, St. Mary’s and Santa
Clara.
