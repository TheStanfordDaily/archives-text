# Stanford Art Exhibit Features Works of Dali, Klee, Masson
## 
### BETSY WRIGHT 
From Jan. 15 until Feb. 7, the
Stanford Art Gallery’s featured
exhibit is Twentieth Century
Drawings from the Museum of
Modern Art.
Prepared and circulated by the
Museum of Modern Art, New
York City, the exhibit “illustrates
the high quality of draftsmanship
within the diverse idioms of art
of this century.” It reveals the
imaginative uses to which tradi
tional forms have been applied,
and a wide range of techniques
and styles.
American artists included in
the exhibit are in the American
pre-war “isolationist" period, but
suggest a concern with the inter
national scene in either subject or
style. Another largo group of
post-war American and European
painters indicate how a tradition
of draftsmanship plus inventive
adaptation of forms is applied to
the problems of our time.
THE ARTISTS’ styles range
from the surrealism of Salvador
Dali to the whimsical drawings of
Paul Klee. The exhibit is largely
composed of pen and ink or pen
cil drawings, but there are some
paintings included.
The subconscious is explored in

Dali's “Cavalier of Death,” a
strangely contorted skeletal horse
and rider. Also in the idiom of
surrealism, there is Masson’s
“Prisoner of the Mirror: Trans
figuring Your Death,” a strange
montage of intertwined figures,
and Morris Graves’ “Nightfall
Pieces.”

Just pencil, pen and ink, draw
ings, they at first seem to bo
simply sketches of chairs, but
then the “chairs” begin to disin
tegrate. until a piece of knotted
rope and frantic red lines alone
keep them together.

For humorous satire, there is
George Gross’s “Fit for Active
Service," with a bedraggled skele
ton who is being passed by a team
of German examining physicians.
IN THE NON-OBJECTIVE style
are Periera’s “Exploration with a
Pencil," and Stuart Davis’ “Com
position No. 4," where design
alone show's the intrinsic value
of line and tone.
“Fruit, Dish, and Bottle,” by
Juan Gris, and Leger’s “Design
for Setting Creation of the
World,” are examples of cubism,
which shows the exactitude of
drawing as forms arc analyzed
and then recreated.
Included in this exhibit are ex
amples of the techniques and
trends which these style innova
tors have contributed to Twenti
eth Century Art.

within the diverse idioms of art
of this century.” It reveals the
imaginative uses to which tradi
tional forms have been applied,
and a wide range of techniques
and styles.
American artists included in
the exhibit are in the American
pre-war “isolationist" period, but
suggest a concern with the inter
national scene in either subject or
style. Another largo group of
post-war American and European
painters indicate how a tradition
of draftsmanship plus inventive
adaptation of forms is applied to
the problems of our time.
THE ARTISTS’ styles range
from the surrealism of Salvador
Dali to the whimsical drawings of
Paul Klee. The exhibit is largely
composed of pen and ink or pen
cil drawings, but there are some
paintings included.
The subconscious is explored in

Dali's “Cavalier of Death,” a
strangely contorted skeletal horse
and rider. Also in the idiom of
surrealism, there is Masson’s
“Prisoner of the Mirror: Trans
figuring Your Death,” a strange
montage of intertwined figures,
and Morris Graves’ “Nightfall
Pieces.”

Just pencil, pen and ink, draw
ings, they at first seem to bo
simply sketches of chairs, but
then the “chairs” begin to disin
tegrate. until a piece of knotted
rope and frantic red lines alone
keep them together.

For humorous satire, there is
George Gross’s “Fit for Active
Service," with a bedraggled skele
ton who is being passed by a team
of German examining physicians.
IN THE NON-OBJECTIVE style
are Periera’s “Exploration with a
Pencil," and Stuart Davis’ “Com
position No. 4," where design
alone show's the intrinsic value
of line and tone.
“Fruit, Dish, and Bottle,” by
Juan Gris, and Leger’s “Design
for Setting Creation of the
World,” are examples of cubism,
which shows the exactitude of
drawing as forms arc analyzed
and then recreated.
Included in this exhibit are ex
amples of the techniques and
trends which these style innova
tors have contributed to Twenti
eth Century Art.
