# Drug Euphoria is Escape, Not Kicks'

Some Stanford students are
hooked on non-prescription stimu
lant pills of the amphetamine
type- dexedrine and benzedrine—
admits Dr. M. M. Osborne of the
Health Service.
The drugs dim the senses of
the brain so that unpleasant sen
sations, worries, and problems
go unnoticed. The result is a sense
of euphoria- everything is OK.
In this stale, Dr. Osborne said,
people postpone work and avoid
making unpleasant decisions.
They feel on top of the world,
and don’t bother to improve
themselves.
When the effect of the drugs
wears off, the user feels even
more panicky than ever. He re
alizes he has wasted the time
I during which he was drugged,
j that deadlines are closing in on
him. Such awareness of his own
| weakness is unpleasant, but he
I knows away out of this—the
pills.
HD KEEPS taking and taking

the drugs to stavo off the depres
sion he rightfully would feel.
“Thus these pills are habit form
ing,” Dr. Osborne said.
Although I have not scon stu
dents taking these drugs for
physical kicks—as some benze
drine “addicts” do—l have found
that several students take them
because the drugs make life seem
so much better, he said. These are
anxious people. They arc only
harming themselves.
“Anxiety has a useful function;
it makes you get things done,”
the doctor noted.
There is yet another danger in
misuse of pep pills a danger
that is easy to overlook. “Almost
every addict of narcotics began
by taking amphetamines or bar
biluates (sedatives),” Dr. Os
borne said. It makes sense. When
a user of pep pills finds the drugs
are no longer giving him the men
tal boost they did at first, he
switches to stronger, more dan
gerous stuff- dope.
Tin ; A M rIIKT AM INKS do have
a role in medicine today. “When
taken in moderate doses under a
physician’s care they are neither
1 physically nor toxically danger

ous, even when taken steadily for
many years,” Dr. Osborne said.
“But this is necessary in only a
few, rare medical instances,” he
noted.
The Health Service used to get
many requests from students for
stay-awake pills. But, Dr. Osborne
said, the doctors now refuse to
dispense them since they are so
potentially dangerous.
Of course, the drugs would not
be in great demand at finals time
if students were not so prone to
procrastinate and then cram at
the last minute. But that’s just
what many students have been
doing for years and will continue
to do unless human nature
changes.
THK ANSWER to the drug
problem is to use moderation.
It’s true, one stay-awake pill
won't kill you. But don’t take that
second pill, for past experience
shows that the results can lie
tragic. Relieving a fatigued mind
and body with sleep will do far
more good than continued cram
ming which may lax the mind to
the breaking point, at which all
cramming proves to have been
futile.
