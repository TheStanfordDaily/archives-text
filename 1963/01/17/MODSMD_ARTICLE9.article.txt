## Khrushchev Cools Berlin Crisis; Seeks Russo-Chinese Truce 
### 
BERLIN (UPl)—Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev, in an
unusually mild mood, put the Berlin crisis on ice for an indefinite
period yesterday. In the same tenor, he sought to call a truce in
Moscow’s dispute with Communist China.
Obviously in top form, the Soviet leader addressed the East

'German Communist party in East
Berlin for 2 hours and 35 minutes.
While he spoke, the Communists
dispatched police reinforcements
to the east side of their Berlin
anti-refugee wall. This led to re
ports Khrushchev might tour the
wall, but such a visit failed to
materialize.

KHRUSHCHEV denounced in
directly the warlike cries of China
and called for peaceful co-exist
ence with the West. But he urged
a “halt to polemics between Com
munist parties to ... allow
some time for passions to sub
side.” The Chinese Communists
greeted his truce overture coldly.
China’s delegate, Wu Hsiu-Chuan
sat passive and poker-faced
throughout Khrushchev’s speech,
never joining in the frequent ap
lause which interrupted it.
Shortly after Khrushchov spoke
the Communist congress officials
baned American newsmen from
further direct coverage of the
conference. The ban meant that
henceforth American newsmen
will have to depend on the Com
munist East German news agency
and state radio reports for cover
age of remaining sessions.
KHRUSHCHEV restated de
mands he has been making for
more than four years for conclu
sion of a German peace treaty
and for withdrawal from isolated
West Berlin by Western troops.
He said Berlin should be convert
ed into a “free” city, garrisoned
for a period of time by foreign
troops under United Nations
command.

Khrushchev made it clear he
has not abandoned this goal and
expected to achieve it sooner or
later. But he set no new deadline
and delivered no now ultimatum.
He emphasized repeatedly, how
ever, that modern thermonuclear
warfare would be so horrible and
destructive that it no longer could
bo considered a moans for settling
East-West disputes.
