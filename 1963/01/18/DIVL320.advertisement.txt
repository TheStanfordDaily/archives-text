TO EVERY NON-COMMUNIST
Everywhere men are hungry for living brf.au. i n , >ue ted stones
that glitter but do not satisfy. They long for the hope of a new wo. Id. They are offered
the fear of world destruction or world dictatorship. In their hearts they .now that if
r men continue to live like clever, greedy beasts, sooner or later the ill be caged or shot,
Man’s attitude must change. The apple in the Garden of Eden was good. bomeLoay’s altitude
o it was wrong.
Science is good. But much of it now seems devoted to the art of destruction.
Education is good. But education nowadays seems to justify moral and pi ilual bankruptcy
nd to destroy faith.
Wealth is good. But when it becomes the aim of great societies, the character of people decays.
More wages, shorter hours, better social and economic conditions are all •; ad end all neces
ary. But in the hearts of millions of workers, white, black, yellow and brown, is a gathering
isillusionment.
Freedom is good, and is coming like a flood to Africa. But where yesterday black men hated
vhitc, now black fears black. And tomorrow may see black or red imperialism where white
imperialism reigned yesterday.
Asia hoped to teach the West the art of unity. For years India practiced a. policy of “neutrality,”
■ hich was praised to high heaven by the Red Chinese giant. Now that giant has crossed the
lation’s frontier and swallowed 30,000 square miles of Indian soil. The feet of invaders march
on land that was successfully defended during 200 years of British rule.
The Communists say that the free world is divided within itself. That is true. But has the
Communist world an answer? A Communist Ambassador from Eastern Europe said recently.
t
Italian workers, almost entirely Communist, absorbed in the Latin American play El Condor,
near Naples, November, 1962.
“There is deep division in the Communist world. Khrushchev
has moved beyond Stalin. He docs not want to force his ideas
on humanity by pointing a bayonet at their bellies. But Mao
Tse-tung believes war not only inevitable, but necessary, in
order to carry mankind into Communism. He has told us we
must risk 300,000,000 lives to do it.”
Khrushchev thinks the most dangerous anti-revolutionaries
are the Chinese. Mao Tse-tung thinks the most dangerous anti
revolutionaries are the Russians. And this peril is projected
into Europe where Albania and Yugoslavia growl and bare
their teeth as they follow their separate paths.
Ordinary men look on the policies, or lack of policies,
which brought the world to the brink of war over Otba as
insanity. They would cry “Halt,” but do not see th y.
The answer lies In the character of men.
It remains true that unless we deal with human nature dras
tically and thoroughly on a colossal scale, man will follow his
historic path to violence and destruction. Capitalism, free
enterprise and democratic socialism have failed to cure the
selfishness that permits too few to have too much, while too
many have too little. The Communist states have failed to
answer the hate and bitterness that drive men into danger.
Hating Russia or hating America or hating another class,
color, race or country multiplies the problem and cures
nothing. The free world as well as the Communist world needs
help, not hate.
Squatting in the streets, protesting about the atom bomb
and running to a safer place when danger threatens does not
seem an intelligent reply to the challenge of the century.
Those who would be willing to die for their country in war
but meanwhile insist on living comfortably, selfishly, undis
turbed, do not answer the challenge of world revolution.
Men who at international conferences talk about unity,
when at home family life, politics and industry are divided by
ambition, fear, jealousy and greed, do not convince or
change anybody.
Some criticize the “godlessncss of Communism.” But they
make excuses for promiscuity, homosexuality and indulgence
in high places. This increases security risks. It also confirms the
cynicism of those who look from outside at self-styled, God
fearing Christian societies that have become corrupted. Men
deny the power of God to cure the disease because they are in
love with the disease itself.
An answer is at large in the modern world.
It is moving massively throughout the world and changing
the outlook of continents.

Japan—‘‘New men, new nations, a new world”
Prime Minister Ikcda of Japan in October opened a new
Moral Re-Armament center at Odawara. He told the confer
ence there that his objective as Prime Minister is to double the
national income. He said, “The foundation for this should be
new men who are right and true. MRA is working to create
new men, new nations, and a new world.” Japan’s senior post
war statesman, Shigcru Yoshida, said, “I want to study MRA
so that I can make it my own and become a part of it.”
To Odawara came 6,500 people from 42 nations. One of
them was Colonel Kim Chong Pil, second man in Korea, a
country with a 60-ycar-old hatred of Japan. Yomiuri Shimbun,
Tokyo daily, said, “Japancse-Korean negotiations are at an
impasse. This meeting between Ikeda and Kim will be a climax
to lead these negotiations to a conclusion.” Colonel Kim said
at Odawara, “You have demonstrated the possibility of creat
ing one world family by transcending political, national and
racial barriers. Coining here has recalled me to God’s purpose
for my life—to restore the moral standards of my country. I
pledge myself that I will always be with you, any time, what
ever the circumstances.”
“Space Is So startling”
Leaders of Japan planned for the new space-age musical,
Space Is So Startling, to travel the land. A special train was
contributed free by the National Railways for this journey.
The play drew crowds to the theaters in Tokyo, Hokkaido
province, Osaka and Yokohama. Millions across Japan saw
it on television. Mainichi, with its four million circulation, writ
ing under the headline “Setting Theatrical Precedent,”
described the staging, music and choreography as unique and
said. “The play shows the road that humanity should choose.”
The leaders of the Zengakuren students, men who thought
Khrushchev and Stalin as reactionary as the leaders of the
West, came to picket the theater in Hokkaido. They were out
to cause a riot. But they were stunned to silence by the passion
of the MRA force for a social, economic and global revolution
far swifter and more penetrating than their own. They called
off the riot and saw I he play instead. They filled the theater
with their friends. They were still talking with members of the
cast two hoars ft er the final curtain. In the dormitories where
Marxism and rioiing were discussed until 4 a.m. they now
discuss Moral Re-Armament. These students organized show
ings of the MRA films in their university. With the money
made they travelled 712 miles by train to Odawara for
training in MRA.
The world longs for unity. In Japan Socialists and Govern
ment supporters, trade unionists and industrialists, the youth
in universities and armed forces are accepting the discipline
of unity necessary to enlist both the Communist and non-
Communist worlds in the greatest revolution of all time.
India —“ Every division can be solved”
From the Odawara Assembly, seven members of the Parlia
ment of the South Indian State of Kerala returned to a country
at war and “waking to reality,” They were some of the men
who wrested the State from Communist control three years
ago, at a time when many in New Delhi were out of touch with
reality. These seven men, representatives of bitterly opposed
democratic factions, now say, “Anti-Communism united us
to throw out the Communists, but within two months of victory
we were fighting each other again. Anti-Communism is no
basis for permanent unity. We needed a superior ideology, and
this we found in M RA.”
These men of Kerala saw Archbishop Makarios, President
of Cyprus, who was on a state visit to India. K. M. Cherian,
Chief Editor of the largest Kerala newspaper, told him, “We
bring you a message of hope —that through MRA every divi
sion and problem can be solved. This has been our experience
in Kerala.” Archbishop Makarios replied, “I greatly appreci
ate the action and purpose of Moral Re-Armament which is at
work in our country also. You have our blessing. Yours is a
right and just struggle.”
Italy—“A complete Revolution”
in Italy, the home of the Church and of the largest Com
munist Party in Western Europe, a Latin American force is
carrying MRA from city to city. The force includes students
who were militant Marxists planning bloody revolution.
Also generals, industrialists and workers’ leaders. Thousands
are massing to their support in towns and villages where pov
erty and bitterness have ruled, to hear them and sec their
play El Condor.
In Naples, where some of the audiences were 80 per cent
Communist, a Communist Professor of Philosophy said,
“MRA takes half-hearted Christians and bitter Marxists and
enlists them both in a complete revolution.”
The Naples paper Roma headlines a page on the world
development of Moral Re-Armament, “A Banner of Hope
Millions in the World Fight for Moral Re-Armament.”
The Secretary -General of the Communist Party in one town
said, “What these people say is exactly what I would like to de
fer the world. Socialism and Communism are not the final
thing. The final thing is what I have seen here.
Britain —“Next step for our people”
To Britain on December 19 came the new musical, Space
Is So Startling, direct from its Japanese journey. It will be
shown for six weeks at the Westminster Theatre. During the
last year 160,000 people have paid to see plays which arc
doing for Britain the job which this musical play has been
doing in Japan.
Miss Nora Swinburne takes the leading role in Music at
Midnight, which had its 219 th performance in Britain and is
shortly to be launched as a play—and later filmed—in the
United States.
Miss Swinburne says, “People from all over Britain write
to me and say how much the play has meant to them and what
a difference its spirit is making in the country. It is a play for
every country.”
The Vice-Chairman of 10,000 miners in a North-Eastern
coalfield of England said after seeing this play, “I am
absolutely prepared to put the same effort into the fight for
the Moral Re-Armament of my country that I put into the
Communist Party for twenty-six years. None of the major
political parties has what our country needs. The workers are
disillusioned with their leadership. What I have seen here
convinced me that this is the next step for our people.”
The American premiere is January 10th in Los Angeles’
Biltmore Theatre, followed by a national tour that includes
La Jolla, Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, through
the Southwest and across the nation.
MRA gives the worker, the housewife, the statesman, the
businessman and the ordinary man everywhere the chance to
make modern history. Its aim is a world where all hungry are
fed, all homeless housed, and where every color, class, race
and background has a proper chance to work together in
rebuilding the world.
The world will not stay the same. It will either be destroyed
or changed. Many sincere Communists think force is the only
means to change the system. Non-Communists, willing to cre
ate a revolution swifter and deeper than a revolution of force
because it changes men, will offer a greater revolution to
enlist the sincere Communists and bring hope to humanity.

MUSIC AT MIDNIGHT
By Peter Howard and Alan Thornhill
the action of this brilliant play takes place on both sides of the
Iron Curtain during twenty-tour hours of international tension.
W'hat should the Western Prime Minister do when a dictator
moves tanks into a satellite country to suppress an uprising the
Prime Minister himself has fostered? How is he to deal with the
embittered young rebel leader who is flown out to meet him with
the Ambassador? What is to be the fate of the family left behind
in the occupied country?
‘Music at Midnight’ is a subtle and exciting play which drama
tizes with rare humor and humanity the choices facing leaders
and led on both sides of the struggle —and leads to an unexpected
climax.

The world longs for unity. In Japan Socialists and Govern
ment supporters, trade unionists and industrialists, the youth
in universities and armed forces are accepting the discipline
of unity necessary to enlist both the Communist and non-
Communist worlds in the greatest revolution of all time.
India —“ Every division can be solved”
From the Odawara Assembly, seven members of the Parlia
ment of the South Indian State of Kerala returned to a country
at war and “waking to reality,” They were some of the men
who wrested the State from Communist control three years
ago, at a time when many in New Delhi were out of touch with
reality. These seven men, representatives of bitterly opposed
democratic factions, now say, “Anti-Communism united us
to throw out the Communists, but within two months of victory
we were fighting each other again. Anti-Communism is no
basis for permanent unity. We needed a superior ideology, and
this we found in M RA.”
These men of Kerala saw Archbishop Makarios, President
of Cyprus, who was on a state visit to India. K. M. Cherian,
Chief Editor of the largest Kerala newspaper, told him, “We
bring you a message of hope —that through MRA every divi
sion and problem can be solved. This has been our experience
in Kerala.” Archbishop Makarios replied, “I greatly appreci
ate the action and purpose of Moral Re-Armament which is at
work in our country also. You have our blessing. Yours is a
right and just struggle.”
Italy—“A complete Revolution”
in Italy, the home of the Church and of the largest Com
munist Party in Western Europe, a Latin American force is
carrying MRA from city to city. The force includes students
who were militant Marxists planning bloody revolution.
Also generals, industrialists and workers’ leaders. Thousands
are massing to their support in towns and villages where pov
erty and bitterness have ruled, to hear them and sec their
play El Condor.
In Naples, where some of the audiences were 80 per cent
Communist, a Communist Professor of Philosophy said,
“MRA takes half-hearted Christians and bitter Marxists and
enlists them both in a complete revolution.”
The Naples paper Roma headlines a page on the world
development of Moral Re-Armament, “A Banner of Hope
Millions in the World Fight for Moral Re-Armament.”
The Secretary -General of the Communist Party in one town
said, “What these people say is exactly what I would like to de
fer the world. Socialism and Communism are not the final
thing. The final thing is what I have seen here.
Britain —“Next step for our people”
To Britain on December 19 came the new musical, Space
Is So Startling, direct from its Japanese journey. It will be
shown for six weeks at the Westminster Theatre. During the
last year 160,000 people have paid to see plays which arc
doing for Britain the job which this musical play has been
doing in Japan.
Miss Nora Swinburne takes the leading role in Music at
Midnight, which had its 219 th performance in Britain and is
shortly to be launched as a play—and later filmed—in the
United States.
Miss Swinburne says, “People from all over Britain write
to me and say how much the play has meant to them and what
a difference its spirit is making in the country. It is a play for
every country.”
The Vice-Chairman of 10,000 miners in a North-Eastern
coalfield of England said after seeing this play, “I am
absolutely prepared to put the same effort into the fight for
the Moral Re-Armament of my country that I put into the
Communist Party for twenty-six years. None of the major
political parties has what our country needs. The workers are
disillusioned with their leadership. What I have seen here
convinced me that this is the next step for our people.”
The American premiere is January 10th in Los Angeles’
Biltmore Theatre, followed by a national tour that includes
La Jolla, Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, through
the Southwest and across the nation.
MRA gives the worker, the housewife, the statesman, the
businessman and the ordinary man everywhere the chance to
make modern history. Its aim is a world where all hungry are
fed, all homeless housed, and where every color, class, race
and background has a proper chance to work together in
rebuilding the world.
The world will not stay the same. It will either be destroyed
or changed. Many sincere Communists think force is the only
means to change the system. Non-Communists, willing to cre
ate a revolution swifter and deeper than a revolution of force
because it changes men, will offer a greater revolution to
enlist the sincere Communists and bring hope to humanity.

TO EVERY NON-COMMUNIST
Everywhere men are hungry for living brf.au. i n , >ue ted stones
that glitter but do not satisfy. They long for the hope of a new wo. Id. They are offered
the fear of world destruction or world dictatorship. In their hearts they .now that if
r men continue to live like clever, greedy beasts, sooner or later the ill be caged or shot,
Man’s attitude must change. The apple in the Garden of Eden was good. bomeLoay’s altitude
o it was wrong.
Science is good. But much of it now seems devoted to the art of destruction.
Education is good. But education nowadays seems to justify moral and pi ilual bankruptcy
nd to destroy faith.
Wealth is good. But when it becomes the aim of great societies, the character of people decays.
More wages, shorter hours, better social and economic conditions are all •; ad end all neces
ary. But in the hearts of millions of workers, white, black, yellow and brown, is a gathering
isillusionment.
Freedom is good, and is coming like a flood to Africa. But where yesterday black men hated
vhitc, now black fears black. And tomorrow may see black or red imperialism where white
imperialism reigned yesterday.
Asia hoped to teach the West the art of unity. For years India practiced a. policy of “neutrality,”
■ hich was praised to high heaven by the Red Chinese giant. Now that giant has crossed the
lation’s frontier and swallowed 30,000 square miles of Indian soil. The feet of invaders march
on land that was successfully defended during 200 years of British rule.
The Communists say that the free world is divided within itself. That is true. But has the
Communist world an answer? A Communist Ambassador from Eastern Europe said recently.
t
Italian workers, almost entirely Communist, absorbed in the Latin American play El Condor,
near Naples, November, 1962.
“There is deep division in the Communist world. Khrushchev
has moved beyond Stalin. He docs not want to force his ideas
on humanity by pointing a bayonet at their bellies. But Mao
Tse-tung believes war not only inevitable, but necessary, in
order to carry mankind into Communism. He has told us we
must risk 300,000,000 lives to do it.”
Khrushchev thinks the most dangerous anti-revolutionaries
are the Chinese. Mao Tse-tung thinks the most dangerous anti
revolutionaries are the Russians. And this peril is projected
into Europe where Albania and Yugoslavia growl and bare
their teeth as they follow their separate paths.
Ordinary men look on the policies, or lack of policies,
which brought the world to the brink of war over Otba as
insanity. They would cry “Halt,” but do not see th y.
The answer lies In the character of men.
It remains true that unless we deal with human nature dras
tically and thoroughly on a colossal scale, man will follow his
historic path to violence and destruction. Capitalism, free
enterprise and democratic socialism have failed to cure the
selfishness that permits too few to have too much, while too
many have too little. The Communist states have failed to
answer the hate and bitterness that drive men into danger.
Hating Russia or hating America or hating another class,
color, race or country multiplies the problem and cures
nothing. The free world as well as the Communist world needs
help, not hate.
Squatting in the streets, protesting about the atom bomb
and running to a safer place when danger threatens does not
seem an intelligent reply to the challenge of the century.
Those who would be willing to die for their country in war
but meanwhile insist on living comfortably, selfishly, undis
turbed, do not answer the challenge of world revolution.
Men who at international conferences talk about unity,
when at home family life, politics and industry are divided by
ambition, fear, jealousy and greed, do not convince or
change anybody.
Some criticize the “godlessncss of Communism.” But they
make excuses for promiscuity, homosexuality and indulgence
in high places. This increases security risks. It also confirms the
cynicism of those who look from outside at self-styled, God
fearing Christian societies that have become corrupted. Men
deny the power of God to cure the disease because they are in
love with the disease itself.
An answer is at large in the modern world.
It is moving massively throughout the world and changing
the outlook of continents.

Japan—‘‘New men, new nations, a new world”
Prime Minister Ikcda of Japan in October opened a new
Moral Re-Armament center at Odawara. He told the confer
ence there that his objective as Prime Minister is to double the
national income. He said, “The foundation for this should be
new men who are right and true. MRA is working to create
new men, new nations, and a new world.” Japan’s senior post
war statesman, Shigcru Yoshida, said, “I want to study MRA
so that I can make it my own and become a part of it.”
To Odawara came 6,500 people from 42 nations. One of
them was Colonel Kim Chong Pil, second man in Korea, a
country with a 60-ycar-old hatred of Japan. Yomiuri Shimbun,
Tokyo daily, said, “Japancse-Korean negotiations are at an
impasse. This meeting between Ikeda and Kim will be a climax
to lead these negotiations to a conclusion.” Colonel Kim said
at Odawara, “You have demonstrated the possibility of creat
ing one world family by transcending political, national and
racial barriers. Coining here has recalled me to God’s purpose
for my life—to restore the moral standards of my country. I
pledge myself that I will always be with you, any time, what
ever the circumstances.”
“Space Is So startling”
Leaders of Japan planned for the new space-age musical,
Space Is So Startling, to travel the land. A special train was
contributed free by the National Railways for this journey.
The play drew crowds to the theaters in Tokyo, Hokkaido
province, Osaka and Yokohama. Millions across Japan saw
it on television. Mainichi, with its four million circulation, writ
ing under the headline “Setting Theatrical Precedent,”
described the staging, music and choreography as unique and
said. “The play shows the road that humanity should choose.”
The leaders of the Zengakuren students, men who thought
Khrushchev and Stalin as reactionary as the leaders of the
West, came to picket the theater in Hokkaido. They were out
to cause a riot. But they were stunned to silence by the passion
of the MRA force for a social, economic and global revolution
far swifter and more penetrating than their own. They called
off the riot and saw I he play instead. They filled the theater
with their friends. They were still talking with members of the
cast two hoars ft er the final curtain. In the dormitories where
Marxism and rioiing were discussed until 4 a.m. they now
discuss Moral Re-Armament. These students organized show
ings of the MRA films in their university. With the money
made they travelled 712 miles by train to Odawara for
training in MRA.
The world longs for unity. In Japan Socialists and Govern

in universities and armed forces are accepting the discipline
of unity necessary to enlist both the Communist and non-
Communist worlds in the greatest revolution of all time.

on land that was successfully defended during 200 years of British rule.
The Communists say that the free world is divided within itself. That is true. But has the
Communist world an answer? A Communist Ambassador from Eastern Europe said recently.
t
Italian workers, almost entirely Communist, absorbed in the Latin American play El Condor,
near Naples, November, 1962.
“There is deep division in the Communist world. Khrushchev
has moved beyond Stalin. He docs not want to force his ideas
on humanity by pointing a bayonet at their bellies. But Mao
Tse-tung believes war not only inevitable, but necessary, in
order to carry mankind into Communism. He has told us we
must risk 300,000,000 lives to do it.”
Khrushchev thinks the most dangerous anti-revolutionaries
are the Chinese. Mao Tse-tung thinks the most dangerous anti
revolutionaries are the Russians. And this peril is projected
into Europe where Albania and Yugoslavia growl and bare
their teeth as they follow their separate paths.
Ordinary men look on the policies, or lack of policies,
which brought the world to the brink of war over Otba as
insanity. They would cry “Halt,” but do not see th y.
The answer lies In the character of men.
It remains true that unless we deal with human nature dras
tically and thoroughly on a colossal scale, man will follow his
historic path to violence and destruction. Capitalism, free
enterprise and democratic socialism have failed to cure the
selfishness that permits too few to have too much, while too
many have too little. The Communist states have failed to
answer the hate and bitterness that drive men into danger.
Hating Russia or hating America or hating another class,
color, race or country multiplies the problem and cures
nothing. The free world as well as the Communist world needs
help, not hate.
Squatting in the streets, protesting about the atom bomb
and running to a safer place when danger threatens does not
seem an intelligent reply to the challenge of the century.
Those who would be willing to die for their country in war
but meanwhile insist on living comfortably, selfishly, undis
turbed, do not answer the challenge of world revolution.
Men who at international conferences talk about unity,
when at home family life, politics and industry are divided by
ambition, fear, jealousy and greed, do not convince or
change anybody.
Some criticize the “godlessncss of Communism.” But they
make excuses for promiscuity, homosexuality and indulgence
in high places. This increases security risks. It also confirms the
cynicism of those who look from outside at self-styled, God
fearing Christian societies that have become corrupted. Men
deny the power of God to cure the disease because they are in
love with the disease itself.
An answer is at large in the modern world.
It is moving massively throughout the world and changing
the outlook of continents.

Japan—‘‘New men, new nations, a new world”
Prime Minister Ikcda of Japan in October opened a new
Moral Re-Armament center at Odawara. He told the confer
ence there that his objective as Prime Minister is to double the
national income. He said, “The foundation for this should be
new men who are right and true. MRA is working to create
new men, new nations, and a new world.” Japan’s senior post
war statesman, Shigcru Yoshida, said, “I want to study MRA
so that I can make it my own and become a part of it.”
To Odawara came 6,500 people from 42 nations. One of
them was Colonel Kim Chong Pil, second man in Korea, a
country with a 60-ycar-old hatred of Japan. Yomiuri Shimbun,
Tokyo daily, said, “Japancse-Korean negotiations are at an
impasse. This meeting between Ikeda and Kim will be a climax
to lead these negotiations to a conclusion.” Colonel Kim said
at Odawara, “You have demonstrated the possibility of creat
ing one world family by transcending political, national and
racial barriers. Coining here has recalled me to God’s purpose
for my life—to restore the moral standards of my country. I
pledge myself that I will always be with you, any time, what
ever the circumstances.”
“Space Is So startling”
Leaders of Japan planned for the new space-age musical,
Space Is So Startling, to travel the land. A special train was
contributed free by the National Railways for this journey.
The play drew crowds to the theaters in Tokyo, Hokkaido
province, Osaka and Yokohama. Millions across Japan saw
it on television. Mainichi, with its four million circulation, writ
ing under the headline “Setting Theatrical Precedent,”
described the staging, music and choreography as unique and
said. “The play shows the road that humanity should choose.”
The leaders of the Zengakuren students, men who thought
Khrushchev and Stalin as reactionary as the leaders of the
West, came to picket the theater in Hokkaido. They were out
to cause a riot. But they were stunned to silence by the passion
of the MRA force for a social, economic and global revolution
far swifter and more penetrating than their own. They called
off the riot and saw I he play instead. They filled the theater
with their friends. They were still talking with members of the
cast two hoars ft er the final curtain. In the dormitories where
Marxism and rioiing were discussed until 4 a.m. they now
discuss Moral Re-Armament. These students organized show
ings of the MRA films in their university. With the money
made they travelled 712 miles by train to Odawara for
training in MRA.
The world longs for unity. In Japan Socialists and Govern
ment supporters, trade unionists and industrialists, the youth
in universities and armed forces are accepting the discipline
of unity necessary to enlist both the Communist and non-
Communist worlds in the greatest revolution of all time.
India —“ Every division can be solved”
From the Odawara Assembly, seven members of the Parlia
ment of the South Indian State of Kerala returned to a country
at war and “waking to reality,” They were some of the men
who wrested the State from Communist control three years
ago, at a time when many in New Delhi were out of touch with
reality. These seven men, representatives of bitterly opposed
democratic factions, now say, “Anti-Communism united us
to throw out the Communists, but within two months of victory
we were fighting each other again. Anti-Communism is no
basis for permanent unity. We needed a superior ideology, and
this we found in M RA.”
These men of Kerala saw Archbishop Makarios, President
of Cyprus, who was on a state visit to India. K. M. Cherian,
Chief Editor of the largest Kerala newspaper, told him, “We
bring you a message of hope —that through MRA every divi
sion and problem can be solved. This has been our experience
in Kerala.” Archbishop Makarios replied, “I greatly appreci
ate the action and purpose of Moral Re-Armament which is at
work in our country also. You have our blessing. Yours is a
right and just struggle.”
Italy—“A complete Revolution”
in Italy, the home of the Church and of the largest Com
munist Party in Western Europe, a Latin American force is
carrying MRA from city to city. The force includes students
who were militant Marxists planning bloody revolution.
Also generals, industrialists and workers’ leaders. Thousands
are massing to their support in towns and villages where pov
erty and bitterness have ruled, to hear them and sec their
play El Condor.
In Naples, where some of the audiences were 80 per cent
Communist, a Communist Professor of Philosophy said,
“MRA takes half-hearted Christians and bitter Marxists and
enlists them both in a complete revolution.”
The Naples paper Roma headlines a page on the world
development of Moral Re-Armament, “A Banner of Hope
Millions in the World Fight for Moral Re-Armament.”
The Secretary -General of the Communist Party in one town
said, “What these people say is exactly what I would like to de
fer the world. Socialism and Communism are not the final
thing. The final thing is what I have seen here.
Britain —“Next step for our people”
To Britain on December 19 came the new musical, Space
Is So Startling, direct from its Japanese journey. It will be
shown for six weeks at the Westminster Theatre. During the
last year 160,000 people have paid to see plays which arc
doing for Britain the job which this musical play has been
doing in Japan.
Miss Nora Swinburne takes the leading role in Music at
Midnight, which had its 219 th performance in Britain and is
shortly to be launched as a play—and later filmed—in the
United States.
Miss Swinburne says, “People from all over Britain write
to me and say how much the play has meant to them and what
a difference its spirit is making in the country. It is a play for
every country.”
The Vice-Chairman of 10,000 miners in a North-Eastern
coalfield of England said after seeing this play, “I am
absolutely prepared to put the same effort into the fight for
the Moral Re-Armament of my country that I put into the
Communist Party for twenty-six years. None of the major
political parties has what our country needs. The workers are
disillusioned with their leadership. What I have seen here
convinced me that this is the next step for our people.”
The American premiere is January 10th in Los Angeles’
Biltmore Theatre, followed by a national tour that includes
La Jolla, Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, through
the Southwest and across the nation.
MRA gives the worker, the housewife, the statesman, the
businessman and the ordinary man everywhere the chance to
make modern history. Its aim is a world where all hungry are
fed, all homeless housed, and where every color, class, race
and background has a proper chance to work together in
rebuilding the world.
The world will not stay the same. It will either be destroyed
or changed. Many sincere Communists think force is the only
means to change the system. Non-Communists, willing to cre
ate a revolution swifter and deeper than a revolution of force
because it changes men, will offer a greater revolution to
enlist the sincere Communists and bring hope to humanity.

MUSIC AT MIDNIGHT
By Peter Howard and Alan Thornhill
the action of this brilliant play takes place on both sides of the
Iron Curtain during twenty-tour hours of international tension.
W'hat should the Western Prime Minister do when a dictator
moves tanks into a satellite country to suppress an uprising the
Prime Minister himself has fostered? How is he to deal with the
embittered young rebel leader who is flown out to meet him with
the Ambassador? What is to be the fate of the family left behind
in the occupied country?
‘Music at Midnight’ is a subtle and exciting play which drama
tizes with rare humor and humanity the choices facing leaders
and led on both sides of the struggle —and leads to an unexpected
climax.

ago, at a time when many in New Delhi were out of touch with
reality. These seven men, representatives of bitterly opposed
democratic factions, now say, “Anti-Communism united us
to throw out the Communists, but within two months of victory
we were fighting each other again. Anti-Communism is no
basis for permanent unity. We needed a superior ideology, and
this we found in M RA.”
These men of Kerala saw Archbishop Makarios, President
of Cyprus, who was on a state visit to India. K. M. Cherian,
Chief Editor of the largest Kerala newspaper, told him, “We
bring you a message of hope —that through MRA every divi
sion and problem can be solved. This has been our experience
in Kerala.” Archbishop Makarios replied, “I greatly appreci
ate the action and purpose of Moral Re-Armament which is at
work in our country also. You have our blessing. Yours is a
right and just struggle.”
Italy—“A complete Revolution”
in Italy, the home of the Church and of the largest Com
munist Party in Western Europe, a Latin American force is
carrying MRA from city to city. The force includes students
who were militant Marxists planning bloody revolution.
Also generals, industrialists and workers’ leaders. Thousands
are massing to their support in towns and villages where pov
erty and bitterness have ruled, to hear them and sec their
play El Condor.
In Naples, where some of the audiences were 80 per cent
Communist, a Communist Professor of Philosophy said,
“MRA takes half-hearted Christians and bitter Marxists and
enlists them both in a complete revolution.”
The Naples paper Roma headlines a page on the world
development of Moral Re-Armament, “A Banner of Hope
Millions in the World Fight for Moral Re-Armament.”
The Secretary -General of the Communist Party in one town
said, “What these people say is exactly what I would like to de
fer the world. Socialism and Communism are not the final
thing. The final thing is what I have seen here.
Britain —“Next step for our people”
To Britain on December 19 came the new musical, Space
Is So Startling, direct from its Japanese journey. It will be
shown for six weeks at the Westminster Theatre. During the
last year 160,000 people have paid to see plays which arc
doing for Britain the job which this musical play has been
doing in Japan.
Miss Nora Swinburne takes the leading role in Music at
Midnight, which had its 219 th performance in Britain and is
shortly to be launched as a play—and later filmed—in the
United States.
Miss Swinburne says, “People from all over Britain write
to me and say how much the play has meant to them and what
a difference its spirit is making in the country. It is a play for
every country.”
The Vice-Chairman of 10,000 miners in a North-Eastern
coalfield of England said after seeing this play, “I am
absolutely prepared to put the same effort into the fight for
the Moral Re-Armament of my country that I put into the
Communist Party for twenty-six years. None of the major
political parties has what our country needs. The workers are
disillusioned with their leadership. What I have seen here
convinced me that this is the next step for our people.”
The American premiere is January 10th in Los Angeles’
Biltmore Theatre, followed by a national tour that includes
La Jolla, Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, through
the Southwest and across the nation.
MRA gives the worker, the housewife, the statesman, the
businessman and the ordinary man everywhere the chance to
make modern history. Its aim is a world where all hungry are
fed, all homeless housed, and where every color, class, race
and background has a proper chance to work together in
rebuilding the world.
The world will not stay the same. It will either be destroyed
or changed. Many sincere Communists think force is the only
means to change the system. Non-Communists, willing to cre
ate a revolution swifter and deeper than a revolution of force
because it changes men, will offer a greater revolution to
enlist the sincere Communists and bring hope to humanity.

TO EVERY NON-COMMUNIST
Everywhere men are hungry for living brf.au. i n , >ue ted stones
that glitter but do not satisfy. They long for the hope of a new wo. Id. They are offered
the fear of world destruction or world dictatorship. In their hearts they .now that if
r men continue to live like clever, greedy beasts, sooner or later the ill be caged or shot,
Man’s attitude must change. The apple in the Garden of Eden was good. bomeLoay’s altitude
o it was wrong.
Science is good. But much of it now seems devoted to the art of destruction.
Education is good. But education nowadays seems to justify moral and pi ilual bankruptcy
nd to destroy faith.
Wealth is good. But when it becomes the aim of great societies, the character of people decays.
More wages, shorter hours, better social and economic conditions are all •; ad end all neces
ary. But in the hearts of millions of workers, white, black, yellow and brown, is a gathering
isillusionment.
Freedom is good, and is coming like a flood to Africa. But where yesterday black men hated
vhitc, now black fears black. And tomorrow may see black or red imperialism where white
imperialism reigned yesterday.
Asia hoped to teach the West the art of unity. For years India practiced a. policy of “neutrality,”
■ hich was praised to high heaven by the Red Chinese giant. Now that giant has crossed the
lation’s frontier and swallowed 30,000 square miles of Indian soil. The feet of invaders march
on land that was successfully defended during 200 years of British rule.
The Communists say that the free world is divided within itself. That is true. But has the
Communist world an answer? A Communist Ambassador from Eastern Europe said recently.
t
Italian workers, almost entirely Communist, absorbed in the Latin American play El Condor,
near Naples, November, 1962.
“There is deep division in the Communist world. Khrushchev
has moved beyond Stalin. He docs not want to force his ideas
on humanity by pointing a bayonet at their bellies. But Mao
Tse-tung believes war not only inevitable, but necessary, in
order to carry mankind into Communism. He has told us we
must risk 300,000,000 lives to do it.”
Khrushchev thinks the most dangerous anti-revolutionaries
are the Chinese. Mao Tse-tung thinks the most dangerous anti
revolutionaries are the Russians. And this peril is projected
into Europe where Albania and Yugoslavia growl and bare
their teeth as they follow their separate paths.
Ordinary men look on the policies, or lack of policies,
which brought the world to the brink of war over Otba as
insanity. They would cry “Halt,” but do not see th y.
The answer lies In the character of men.
It remains true that unless we deal with human nature dras
tically and thoroughly on a colossal scale, man will follow his
historic path to violence and destruction. Capitalism, free
enterprise and democratic socialism have failed to cure the
selfishness that permits too few to have too much, while too
many have too little. The Communist states have failed to
answer the hate and bitterness that drive men into danger.
Hating Russia or hating America or hating another class,
color, race or country multiplies the problem and cures
nothing. The free world as well as the Communist world needs
help, not hate.
Squatting in the streets, protesting about the atom bomb
and running to a safer place when danger threatens does not
seem an intelligent reply to the challenge of the century.
Those who would be willing to die for their country in war
but meanwhile insist on living comfortably, selfishly, undis
turbed, do not answer the challenge of world revolution.
Men who at international conferences talk about unity,
when at home family life, politics and industry are divided by
ambition, fear, jealousy and greed, do not convince or
change anybody.
Some criticize the “godlessncss of Communism.” But they
make excuses for promiscuity, homosexuality and indulgence
in high places. This increases security risks. It also confirms the
cynicism of those who look from outside at self-styled, God
fearing Christian societies that have become corrupted. Men
deny the power of God to cure the disease because they are in
love with the disease itself.
An answer is at large in the modern world.
It is moving massively throughout the world and changing
the outlook of continents.

Japan—‘‘New men, new nations, a new world”
Prime Minister Ikcda of Japan in October opened a new
Moral Re-Armament center at Odawara. He told the confer
ence there that his objective as Prime Minister is to double the
national income. He said, “The foundation for this should be
new men who are right and true. MRA is working to create
new men, new nations, and a new world.” Japan’s senior post
war statesman, Shigcru Yoshida, said, “I want to study MRA
so that I can make it my own and become a part of it.”
To Odawara came 6,500 people from 42 nations. One of
them was Colonel Kim Chong Pil, second man in Korea, a
country with a 60-ycar-old hatred of Japan. Yomiuri Shimbun,
Tokyo daily, said, “Japancse-Korean negotiations are at an
impasse. This meeting between Ikeda and Kim will be a climax
to lead these negotiations to a conclusion.” Colonel Kim said
at Odawara, “You have demonstrated the possibility of creat
ing one world family by transcending political, national and
racial barriers. Coining here has recalled me to God’s purpose
for my life—to restore the moral standards of my country. I
pledge myself that I will always be with you, any time, what
ever the circumstances.”
“Space Is So startling”
Leaders of Japan planned for the new space-age musical,
Space Is So Startling, to travel the land. A special train was
contributed free by the National Railways for this journey.
The play drew crowds to the theaters in Tokyo, Hokkaido
province, Osaka and Yokohama. Millions across Japan saw
it on television. Mainichi, with its four million circulation, writ
ing under the headline “Setting Theatrical Precedent,”
described the staging, music and choreography as unique and
said. “The play shows the road that humanity should choose.”
The leaders of the Zengakuren students, men who thought
Khrushchev and Stalin as reactionary as the leaders of the
West, came to picket the theater in Hokkaido. They were out
to cause a riot. But they were stunned to silence by the passion
of the MRA force for a social, economic and global revolution
far swifter and more penetrating than their own. They called
off the riot and saw I he play instead. They filled the theater
with their friends. They were still talking with members of the
cast two hoars ft er the final curtain. In the dormitories where
Marxism and rioiing were discussed until 4 a.m. they now
discuss Moral Re-Armament. These students organized show
ings of the MRA films in their university. With the money
made they travelled 712 miles by train to Odawara for
training in MRA.
The world longs for unity. In Japan Socialists and Govern
ment supporters, trade unionists and industrialists, the youth
in universities and armed forces are accepting the discipline
of unity necessary to enlist both the Communist and non-
Communist worlds in the greatest revolution of all time.
India —“ Every division can be solved”
From the Odawara Assembly, seven members of the Parlia
ment of the South Indian State of Kerala returned to a country
at war and “waking to reality,” They were some of the men
who wrested the State from Communist control three years
ago, at a time when many in New Delhi were out of touch with
reality. These seven men, representatives of bitterly opposed
democratic factions, now say, “Anti-Communism united us

■ hich was praised to high heaven by the Red Chinese giant. Now that giant has crossed the
lation’s frontier and swallowed 30,000 square miles of Indian soil. The feet of invaders march
on land that was successfully defended during 200 years of British rule.
The Communists say that the free world is divided within itself. That is true. But has the
Communist world an answer? A Communist Ambassador from Eastern Europe said recently.
t
Italian workers, almost entirely Communist, absorbed in the Latin American play El Condor,
near Naples, November, 1962.
“There is deep division in the Communist world. Khrushchev
has moved beyond Stalin. He docs not want to force his ideas
on humanity by pointing a bayonet at their bellies. But Mao
Tse-tung believes war not only inevitable, but necessary, in
order to carry mankind into Communism. He has told us we
must risk 300,000,000 lives to do it.”
Khrushchev thinks the most dangerous anti-revolutionaries
are the Chinese. Mao Tse-tung thinks the most dangerous anti
revolutionaries are the Russians. And this peril is projected
into Europe where Albania and Yugoslavia growl and bare
their teeth as they follow their separate paths.
Ordinary men look on the policies, or lack of policies,
which brought the world to the brink of war over Otba as
insanity. They would cry “Halt,” but do not see th y.
The answer lies In the character of men.
It remains true that unless we deal with human nature dras
tically and thoroughly on a colossal scale, man will follow his
historic path to violence and destruction. Capitalism, free
enterprise and democratic socialism have failed to cure the
selfishness that permits too few to have too much, while too
many have too little. The Communist states have failed to
answer the hate and bitterness that drive men into danger.
Hating Russia or hating America or hating another class,
color, race or country multiplies the problem and cures
nothing. The free world as well as the Communist world needs
help, not hate.
Squatting in the streets, protesting about the atom bomb
and running to a safer place when danger threatens does not
seem an intelligent reply to the challenge of the century.
Those who would be willing to die for their country in war
but meanwhile insist on living comfortably, selfishly, undis
turbed, do not answer the challenge of world revolution.
Men who at international conferences talk about unity,
when at home family life, politics and industry are divided by
ambition, fear, jealousy and greed, do not convince or
change anybody.
Some criticize the “godlessncss of Communism.” But they
make excuses for promiscuity, homosexuality and indulgence
in high places. This increases security risks. It also confirms the
cynicism of those who look from outside at self-styled, God
fearing Christian societies that have become corrupted. Men
deny the power of God to cure the disease because they are in
love with the disease itself.
An answer is at large in the modern world.
It is moving massively throughout the world and changing
the outlook of continents.

Japan—‘‘New men, new nations, a new world”
Prime Minister Ikcda of Japan in October opened a new
Moral Re-Armament center at Odawara. He told the confer
ence there that his objective as Prime Minister is to double the
national income. He said, “The foundation for this should be
new men who are right and true. MRA is working to create
new men, new nations, and a new world.” Japan’s senior post
war statesman, Shigcru Yoshida, said, “I want to study MRA
so that I can make it my own and become a part of it.”
To Odawara came 6,500 people from 42 nations. One of
them was Colonel Kim Chong Pil, second man in Korea, a
country with a 60-ycar-old hatred of Japan. Yomiuri Shimbun,
Tokyo daily, said, “Japancse-Korean negotiations are at an
impasse. This meeting between Ikeda and Kim will be a climax
to lead these negotiations to a conclusion.” Colonel Kim said
at Odawara, “You have demonstrated the possibility of creat
ing one world family by transcending political, national and
racial barriers. Coining here has recalled me to God’s purpose
for my life—to restore the moral standards of my country. I
pledge myself that I will always be with you, any time, what
ever the circumstances.”
“Space Is So startling”
Leaders of Japan planned for the new space-age musical,
Space Is So Startling, to travel the land. A special train was
contributed free by the National Railways for this journey.
The play drew crowds to the theaters in Tokyo, Hokkaido
province, Osaka and Yokohama. Millions across Japan saw
it on television. Mainichi, with its four million circulation, writ
ing under the headline “Setting Theatrical Precedent,”
described the staging, music and choreography as unique and
said. “The play shows the road that humanity should choose.”
The leaders of the Zengakuren students, men who thought
Khrushchev and Stalin as reactionary as the leaders of the
West, came to picket the theater in Hokkaido. They were out
to cause a riot. But they were stunned to silence by the passion
of the MRA force for a social, economic and global revolution
far swifter and more penetrating than their own. They called
off the riot and saw I he play instead. They filled the theater
with their friends. They were still talking with members of the
cast two hoars ft er the final curtain. In the dormitories where
Marxism and rioiing were discussed until 4 a.m. they now
discuss Moral Re-Armament. These students organized show
ings of the MRA films in their university. With the money
made they travelled 712 miles by train to Odawara for
training in MRA.
The world longs for unity. In Japan Socialists and Govern
ment supporters, trade unionists and industrialists, the youth
in universities and armed forces are accepting the discipline
of unity necessary to enlist both the Communist and non-
Communist worlds in the greatest revolution of all time.
India —“ Every division can be solved”
From the Odawara Assembly, seven members of the Parlia
ment of the South Indian State of Kerala returned to a country
at war and “waking to reality,” They were some of the men
who wrested the State from Communist control three years
ago, at a time when many in New Delhi were out of touch with
reality. These seven men, representatives of bitterly opposed
democratic factions, now say, “Anti-Communism united us
to throw out the Communists, but within two months of victory
we were fighting each other again. Anti-Communism is no
basis for permanent unity. We needed a superior ideology, and
this we found in M RA.”
These men of Kerala saw Archbishop Makarios, President
of Cyprus, who was on a state visit to India. K. M. Cherian,
Chief Editor of the largest Kerala newspaper, told him, “We
bring you a message of hope —that through MRA every divi
sion and problem can be solved. This has been our experience
in Kerala.” Archbishop Makarios replied, “I greatly appreci
ate the action and purpose of Moral Re-Armament which is at
work in our country also. You have our blessing. Yours is a
right and just struggle.”
Italy—“A complete Revolution”
in Italy, the home of the Church and of the largest Com
munist Party in Western Europe, a Latin American force is
carrying MRA from city to city. The force includes students
who were militant Marxists planning bloody revolution.
Also generals, industrialists and workers’ leaders. Thousands
are massing to their support in towns and villages where pov
erty and bitterness have ruled, to hear them and sec their
play El Condor.
In Naples, where some of the audiences were 80 per cent
Communist, a Communist Professor of Philosophy said,
“MRA takes half-hearted Christians and bitter Marxists and
enlists them both in a complete revolution.”
The Naples paper Roma headlines a page on the world
development of Moral Re-Armament, “A Banner of Hope
Millions in the World Fight for Moral Re-Armament.”
The Secretary -General of the Communist Party in one town
said, “What these people say is exactly what I would like to de
fer the world. Socialism and Communism are not the final
thing. The final thing is what I have seen here.
Britain —“Next step for our people”
To Britain on December 19 came the new musical, Space
Is So Startling, direct from its Japanese journey. It will be
shown for six weeks at the Westminster Theatre. During the
last year 160,000 people have paid to see plays which arc
doing for Britain the job which this musical play has been
doing in Japan.
Miss Nora Swinburne takes the leading role in Music at
Midnight, which had its 219 th performance in Britain and is
shortly to be launched as a play—and later filmed—in the
United States.
Miss Swinburne says, “People from all over Britain write
to me and say how much the play has meant to them and what
a difference its spirit is making in the country. It is a play for
every country.”
The Vice-Chairman of 10,000 miners in a North-Eastern
coalfield of England said after seeing this play, “I am
absolutely prepared to put the same effort into the fight for
the Moral Re-Armament of my country that I put into the
Communist Party for twenty-six years. None of the major
political parties has what our country needs. The workers are
disillusioned with their leadership. What I have seen here
convinced me that this is the next step for our people.”
The American premiere is January 10th in Los Angeles’
Biltmore Theatre, followed by a national tour that includes
La Jolla, Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, through
the Southwest and across the nation.
MRA gives the worker, the housewife, the statesman, the
businessman and the ordinary man everywhere the chance to
make modern history. Its aim is a world where all hungry are
fed, all homeless housed, and where every color, class, race
and background has a proper chance to work together in
rebuilding the world.
The world will not stay the same. It will either be destroyed
or changed. Many sincere Communists think force is the only
means to change the system. Non-Communists, willing to cre
ate a revolution swifter and deeper than a revolution of force
because it changes men, will offer a greater revolution to
enlist the sincere Communists and bring hope to humanity.

MUSIC AT MIDNIGHT
By Peter Howard and Alan Thornhill
the action of this brilliant play takes place on both sides of the
Iron Curtain during twenty-tour hours of international tension.
W'hat should the Western Prime Minister do when a dictator
moves tanks into a satellite country to suppress an uprising the
Prime Minister himself has fostered? How is he to deal with the
embittered young rebel leader who is flown out to meet him with
the Ambassador? What is to be the fate of the family left behind
in the occupied country?
‘Music at Midnight’ is a subtle and exciting play which drama
tizes with rare humor and humanity the choices facing leaders
and led on both sides of the struggle —and leads to an unexpected
climax.

Man’s attitude must change. The apple in the Garden of Eden was good. bomeLoay’s altitude

Science is good. But much of it now seems devoted to the art of destruction.
Education is good. But education nowadays seems to justify moral and pi ilual bankruptcy

Wealth is good. But when it becomes the aim of great societies, the character of people decays.
More wages, shorter hours, better social and economic conditions are all •; ad end all neces

Italy—“A complete Revolution”
in Italy, the home of the Church and of the largest Com
munist Party in Western Europe, a Latin American force is
carrying MRA from city to city. The force includes students
who were militant Marxists planning bloody revolution.
Also generals, industrialists and workers’ leaders. Thousands
are massing to their support in towns and villages where pov
erty and bitterness have ruled, to hear them and sec their
play El Condor.
In Naples, where some of the audiences were 80 per cent
Communist, a Communist Professor of Philosophy said,
“MRA takes half-hearted Christians and bitter Marxists and
enlists them both in a complete revolution.”
The Naples paper Roma headlines a page on the world
development of Moral Re-Armament, “A Banner of Hope
Millions in the World Fight for Moral Re-Armament.”
The Secretary -General of the Communist Party in one town
said, “What these people say is exactly what I would like to de
fer the world. Socialism and Communism are not the final
thing. The final thing is what I have seen here.
Britain —“Next step for our people”
To Britain on December 19 came the new musical, Space
Is So Startling, direct from its Japanese journey. It will be
shown for six weeks at the Westminster Theatre. During the
last year 160,000 people have paid to see plays which arc
doing for Britain the job which this musical play has been
doing in Japan.
Miss Nora Swinburne takes the leading role in Music at
Midnight, which had its 219 th performance in Britain and is
shortly to be launched as a play—and later filmed—in the
United States.
Miss Swinburne says, “People from all over Britain write
to me and say how much the play has meant to them and what
a difference its spirit is making in the country. It is a play for
every country.”
The Vice-Chairman of 10,000 miners in a North-Eastern
coalfield of England said after seeing this play, “I am
absolutely prepared to put the same effort into the fight for
the Moral Re-Armament of my country that I put into the
Communist Party for twenty-six years. None of the major
political parties has what our country needs. The workers are
disillusioned with their leadership. What I have seen here
convinced me that this is the next step for our people.”
The American premiere is January 10th in Los Angeles’
Biltmore Theatre, followed by a national tour that includes
La Jolla, Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, through
the Southwest and across the nation.
MRA gives the worker, the housewife, the statesman, the
businessman and the ordinary man everywhere the chance to
make modern history. Its aim is a world where all hungry are
fed, all homeless housed, and where every color, class, race
and background has a proper chance to work together in
rebuilding the world.
The world will not stay the same. It will either be destroyed
or changed. Many sincere Communists think force is the only
means to change the system. Non-Communists, willing to cre
ate a revolution swifter and deeper than a revolution of force
because it changes men, will offer a greater revolution to
enlist the sincere Communists and bring hope to humanity.

TO EVERY NON-COMMUNIST
Everywhere men are hungry for living brf.au. i n , >ue ted stones
that glitter but do not satisfy. They long for the hope of a new wo. Id. They are offered
the fear of world destruction or world dictatorship. In their hearts they .now that if
r men continue to live like clever, greedy beasts, sooner or later the ill be caged or shot,
Man’s attitude must change. The apple in the Garden of Eden was good. bomeLoay’s altitude
o it was wrong.
Science is good. But much of it now seems devoted to the art of destruction.
Education is good. But education nowadays seems to justify moral and pi ilual bankruptcy
nd to destroy faith.
Wealth is good. But when it becomes the aim of great societies, the character of people decays.
More wages, shorter hours, better social and economic conditions are all •; ad end all neces
ary. But in the hearts of millions of workers, white, black, yellow and brown, is a gathering
isillusionment.
Freedom is good, and is coming like a flood to Africa. But where yesterday black men hated
vhitc, now black fears black. And tomorrow may see black or red imperialism where white
imperialism reigned yesterday.
Asia hoped to teach the West the art of unity. For years India practiced a. policy of “neutrality,”
■ hich was praised to high heaven by the Red Chinese giant. Now that giant has crossed the
lation’s frontier and swallowed 30,000 square miles of Indian soil. The feet of invaders march
on land that was successfully defended during 200 years of British rule.
The Communists say that the free world is divided within itself. That is true. But has the
Communist world an answer? A Communist Ambassador from Eastern Europe said recently.
t
Italian workers, almost entirely Communist, absorbed in the Latin American play El Condor,
near Naples, November, 1962.
“There is deep division in the Communist world. Khrushchev
has moved beyond Stalin. He docs not want to force his ideas
on humanity by pointing a bayonet at their bellies. But Mao
Tse-tung believes war not only inevitable, but necessary, in
order to carry mankind into Communism. He has told us we
must risk 300,000,000 lives to do it.”
Khrushchev thinks the most dangerous anti-revolutionaries
are the Chinese. Mao Tse-tung thinks the most dangerous anti
revolutionaries are the Russians. And this peril is projected
into Europe where Albania and Yugoslavia growl and bare
their teeth as they follow their separate paths.
Ordinary men look on the policies, or lack of policies,
which brought the world to the brink of war over Otba as
insanity. They would cry “Halt,” but do not see th y.
The answer lies In the character of men.
It remains true that unless we deal with human nature dras
tically and thoroughly on a colossal scale, man will follow his
historic path to violence and destruction. Capitalism, free
enterprise and democratic socialism have failed to cure the
selfishness that permits too few to have too much, while too
many have too little. The Communist states have failed to
answer the hate and bitterness that drive men into danger.
Hating Russia or hating America or hating another class,
color, race or country multiplies the problem and cures
nothing. The free world as well as the Communist world needs
help, not hate.
Squatting in the streets, protesting about the atom bomb
and running to a safer place when danger threatens does not
seem an intelligent reply to the challenge of the century.
Those who would be willing to die for their country in war
but meanwhile insist on living comfortably, selfishly, undis
turbed, do not answer the challenge of world revolution.
Men who at international conferences talk about unity,
when at home family life, politics and industry are divided by
ambition, fear, jealousy and greed, do not convince or
change anybody.
Some criticize the “godlessncss of Communism.” But they
make excuses for promiscuity, homosexuality and indulgence
in high places. This increases security risks. It also confirms the
cynicism of those who look from outside at self-styled, God
fearing Christian societies that have become corrupted. Men
deny the power of God to cure the disease because they are in
love with the disease itself.
An answer is at large in the modern world.
It is moving massively throughout the world and changing
the outlook of continents.

Japan—‘‘New men, new nations, a new world”
Prime Minister Ikcda of Japan in October opened a new
Moral Re-Armament center at Odawara. He told the confer
ence there that his objective as Prime Minister is to double the
national income. He said, “The foundation for this should be
new men who are right and true. MRA is working to create
new men, new nations, and a new world.” Japan’s senior post
war statesman, Shigcru Yoshida, said, “I want to study MRA
so that I can make it my own and become a part of it.”
To Odawara came 6,500 people from 42 nations. One of
them was Colonel Kim Chong Pil, second man in Korea, a
country with a 60-ycar-old hatred of Japan. Yomiuri Shimbun,
Tokyo daily, said, “Japancse-Korean negotiations are at an
impasse. This meeting between Ikeda and Kim will be a climax
to lead these negotiations to a conclusion.” Colonel Kim said
at Odawara, “You have demonstrated the possibility of creat
ing one world family by transcending political, national and
racial barriers. Coining here has recalled me to God’s purpose
for my life—to restore the moral standards of my country. I
pledge myself that I will always be with you, any time, what
ever the circumstances.”
“Space Is So startling”
Leaders of Japan planned for the new space-age musical,
Space Is So Startling, to travel the land. A special train was
contributed free by the National Railways for this journey.
The play drew crowds to the theaters in Tokyo, Hokkaido
province, Osaka and Yokohama. Millions across Japan saw
it on television. Mainichi, with its four million circulation, writ
ing under the headline “Setting Theatrical Precedent,”
described the staging, music and choreography as unique and
said. “The play shows the road that humanity should choose.”
The leaders of the Zengakuren students, men who thought
Khrushchev and Stalin as reactionary as the leaders of the
West, came to picket the theater in Hokkaido. They were out
to cause a riot. But they were stunned to silence by the passion
of the MRA force for a social, economic and global revolution
far swifter and more penetrating than their own. They called
off the riot and saw I he play instead. They filled the theater
with their friends. They were still talking with members of the
cast two hoars ft er the final curtain. In the dormitories where
Marxism and rioiing were discussed until 4 a.m. they now
discuss Moral Re-Armament. These students organized show
ings of the MRA films in their university. With the money
made they travelled 712 miles by train to Odawara for
training in MRA.
The world longs for unity. In Japan Socialists and Govern
ment supporters, trade unionists and industrialists, the youth
in universities and armed forces are accepting the discipline
of unity necessary to enlist both the Communist and non-
Communist worlds in the greatest revolution of all time.
India —“ Every division can be solved”
From the Odawara Assembly, seven members of the Parlia
ment of the South Indian State of Kerala returned to a country
at war and “waking to reality,” They were some of the men
who wrested the State from Communist control three years
ago, at a time when many in New Delhi were out of touch with
reality. These seven men, representatives of bitterly opposed
democratic factions, now say, “Anti-Communism united us
to throw out the Communists, but within two months of victory
we were fighting each other again. Anti-Communism is no
basis for permanent unity. We needed a superior ideology, and
this we found in M RA.”
These men of Kerala saw Archbishop Makarios, President
of Cyprus, who was on a state visit to India. K. M. Cherian,
Chief Editor of the largest Kerala newspaper, told him, “We
bring you a message of hope —that through MRA every divi
sion and problem can be solved. This has been our experience

has moved beyond Stalin. He docs not want to force his ideas
on humanity by pointing a bayonet at their bellies. But Mao
Tse-tung believes war not only inevitable, but necessary, in
order to carry mankind into Communism. He has told us we
must risk 300,000,000 lives to do it.”
Khrushchev thinks the most dangerous anti-revolutionaries
are the Chinese. Mao Tse-tung thinks the most dangerous anti
revolutionaries are the Russians. And this peril is projected
into Europe where Albania and Yugoslavia growl and bare
their teeth as they follow their separate paths.
Ordinary men look on the policies, or lack of policies,
which brought the world to the brink of war over Otba as
insanity. They would cry “Halt,” but do not see th y.
The answer lies In the character of men.
It remains true that unless we deal with human nature dras
tically and thoroughly on a colossal scale, man will follow his
historic path to violence and destruction. Capitalism, free
enterprise and democratic socialism have failed to cure the
selfishness that permits too few to have too much, while too
many have too little. The Communist states have failed to
answer the hate and bitterness that drive men into danger.
Hating Russia or hating America or hating another class,
color, race or country multiplies the problem and cures
nothing. The free world as well as the Communist world needs
help, not hate.
Squatting in the streets, protesting about the atom bomb
and running to a safer place when danger threatens does not
seem an intelligent reply to the challenge of the century.
Those who would be willing to die for their country in war
but meanwhile insist on living comfortably, selfishly, undis
turbed, do not answer the challenge of world revolution.
Men who at international conferences talk about unity,
when at home family life, politics and industry are divided by
ambition, fear, jealousy and greed, do not convince or
change anybody.
Some criticize the “godlessncss of Communism.” But they
make excuses for promiscuity, homosexuality and indulgence
in high places. This increases security risks. It also confirms the
cynicism of those who look from outside at self-styled, God
fearing Christian societies that have become corrupted. Men
deny the power of God to cure the disease because they are in
love with the disease itself.
An answer is at large in the modern world.
It is moving massively throughout the world and changing
the outlook of continents.

Japan—‘‘New men, new nations, a new world”
Prime Minister Ikcda of Japan in October opened a new
Moral Re-Armament center at Odawara. He told the confer
ence there that his objective as Prime Minister is to double the
national income. He said, “The foundation for this should be
new men who are right and true. MRA is working to create
new men, new nations, and a new world.” Japan’s senior post
war statesman, Shigcru Yoshida, said, “I want to study MRA
so that I can make it my own and become a part of it.”
To Odawara came 6,500 people from 42 nations. One of
them was Colonel Kim Chong Pil, second man in Korea, a
country with a 60-ycar-old hatred of Japan. Yomiuri Shimbun,
Tokyo daily, said, “Japancse-Korean negotiations are at an
impasse. This meeting between Ikeda and Kim will be a climax
to lead these negotiations to a conclusion.” Colonel Kim said
at Odawara, “You have demonstrated the possibility of creat
ing one world family by transcending political, national and
racial barriers. Coining here has recalled me to God’s purpose
for my life—to restore the moral standards of my country. I
pledge myself that I will always be with you, any time, what
ever the circumstances.”
“Space Is So startling”
Leaders of Japan planned for the new space-age musical,
Space Is So Startling, to travel the land. A special train was
contributed free by the National Railways for this journey.
The play drew crowds to the theaters in Tokyo, Hokkaido
province, Osaka and Yokohama. Millions across Japan saw
it on television. Mainichi, with its four million circulation, writ
ing under the headline “Setting Theatrical Precedent,”
described the staging, music and choreography as unique and
said. “The play shows the road that humanity should choose.”
The leaders of the Zengakuren students, men who thought
Khrushchev and Stalin as reactionary as the leaders of the
West, came to picket the theater in Hokkaido. They were out
to cause a riot. But they were stunned to silence by the passion
of the MRA force for a social, economic and global revolution
far swifter and more penetrating than their own. They called
off the riot and saw I he play instead. They filled the theater
with their friends. They were still talking with members of the
cast two hoars ft er the final curtain. In the dormitories where
Marxism and rioiing were discussed until 4 a.m. they now
discuss Moral Re-Armament. These students organized show
ings of the MRA films in their university. With the money
made they travelled 712 miles by train to Odawara for
training in MRA.
The world longs for unity. In Japan Socialists and Govern
ment supporters, trade unionists and industrialists, the youth
in universities and armed forces are accepting the discipline
of unity necessary to enlist both the Communist and non-
Communist worlds in the greatest revolution of all time.
India —“ Every division can be solved”
From the Odawara Assembly, seven members of the Parlia
ment of the South Indian State of Kerala returned to a country
at war and “waking to reality,” They were some of the men
who wrested the State from Communist control three years
ago, at a time when many in New Delhi were out of touch with
reality. These seven men, representatives of bitterly opposed
democratic factions, now say, “Anti-Communism united us
to throw out the Communists, but within two months of victory
we were fighting each other again. Anti-Communism is no
basis for permanent unity. We needed a superior ideology, and
this we found in M RA.”
These men of Kerala saw Archbishop Makarios, President
of Cyprus, who was on a state visit to India. K. M. Cherian,
Chief Editor of the largest Kerala newspaper, told him, “We
bring you a message of hope —that through MRA every divi
sion and problem can be solved. This has been our experience
in Kerala.” Archbishop Makarios replied, “I greatly appreci
ate the action and purpose of Moral Re-Armament which is at
work in our country also. You have our blessing. Yours is a
right and just struggle.”
Italy—“A complete Revolution”
in Italy, the home of the Church and of the largest Com
munist Party in Western Europe, a Latin American force is
carrying MRA from city to city. The force includes students
who were militant Marxists planning bloody revolution.
Also generals, industrialists and workers’ leaders. Thousands
are massing to their support in towns and villages where pov
erty and bitterness have ruled, to hear them and sec their
play El Condor.
In Naples, where some of the audiences were 80 per cent
Communist, a Communist Professor of Philosophy said,
“MRA takes half-hearted Christians and bitter Marxists and
enlists them both in a complete revolution.”
The Naples paper Roma headlines a page on the world
development of Moral Re-Armament, “A Banner of Hope
Millions in the World Fight for Moral Re-Armament.”
The Secretary -General of the Communist Party in one town
said, “What these people say is exactly what I would like to de
fer the world. Socialism and Communism are not the final
thing. The final thing is what I have seen here.
Britain —“Next step for our people”
To Britain on December 19 came the new musical, Space
Is So Startling, direct from its Japanese journey. It will be
shown for six weeks at the Westminster Theatre. During the
last year 160,000 people have paid to see plays which arc
doing for Britain the job which this musical play has been
doing in Japan.
Miss Nora Swinburne takes the leading role in Music at
Midnight, which had its 219 th performance in Britain and is
shortly to be launched as a play—and later filmed—in the
United States.
Miss Swinburne says, “People from all over Britain write
to me and say how much the play has meant to them and what
a difference its spirit is making in the country. It is a play for
every country.”
The Vice-Chairman of 10,000 miners in a North-Eastern
coalfield of England said after seeing this play, “I am
absolutely prepared to put the same effort into the fight for
the Moral Re-Armament of my country that I put into the
Communist Party for twenty-six years. None of the major
political parties has what our country needs. The workers are
disillusioned with their leadership. What I have seen here
convinced me that this is the next step for our people.”
The American premiere is January 10th in Los Angeles’
Biltmore Theatre, followed by a national tour that includes
La Jolla, Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, San Francisco, through
the Southwest and across the nation.
MRA gives the worker, the housewife, the statesman, the
businessman and the ordinary man everywhere the chance to
make modern history. Its aim is a world where all hungry are
fed, all homeless housed, and where every color, class, race
and background has a proper chance to work together in
rebuilding the world.
The world will not stay the same. It will either be destroyed
or changed. Many sincere Communists think force is the only
means to change the system. Non-Communists, willing to cre
ate a revolution swifter and deeper than a revolution of force
because it changes men, will offer a greater revolution to
enlist the sincere Communists and bring hope to humanity.

MUSIC AT MIDNIGHT
By Peter Howard and Alan Thornhill
the action of this brilliant play takes place on both sides of the
Iron Curtain during twenty-tour hours of international tension.
W'hat should the Western Prime Minister do when a dictator
moves tanks into a satellite country to suppress an uprising the
Prime Minister himself has fostered? How is he to deal with the
embittered young rebel leader who is flown out to meet him with
the Ambassador? What is to be the fate of the family left behind
in the occupied country?
‘Music at Midnight’ is a subtle and exciting play which drama
tizes with rare humor and humanity the choices facing leaders
and led on both sides of the struggle —and leads to an unexpected
climax.

TO EVERY NON-COMMUNIST
Everywhere men are hungry for living brf.au. i n , >ue ted stones
that glitter but do not satisfy. They long for the hope of a new wo. Id. They are offered
the fear of world destruction or world dictatorship. In their hearts they .now that if
r men continue to live like clever, greedy beasts, sooner or later the ill be caged or shot,
Man’s attitude must change. The apple in the Garden of Eden was good. bomeLoay’s altitude
o it was wrong.
Science is good. But much of it now seems devoted to the art of destruction.
Education is good. But education nowadays seems to justify moral and pi ilual bankruptcy
nd to destroy faith.
Wealth is good. But when it becomes the aim of great societies, the character of people decays.
More wages, shorter hours, better social and economic conditions are all •; ad end all neces
ary. But in the hearts of millions of workers, white, black, yellow and brown, is a gathering
isillusionment.
Freedom is good, and is coming like a flood to Africa. But where yesterday black men hated
vhitc, now black fears black. And tomorrow may see black or red imperialism where white
imperialism reigned yesterday.
Asia hoped to teach the West the art of unity. For years India practiced a. policy of “neutrality,”
■ hich was praised to high heaven by the Red Chinese giant. Now that giant has crossed the
lation’s frontier and swallowed 30,000 square miles of Indian soil. The feet of invaders march
on land that was successfully defended during 200 years of British rule.
The Communists say that the free world is divided within itself. That is true. But has the
Communist world an answer? A Communist Ambassador from Eastern Europe said recently.
t
Italian workers, almost entirely Communist, absorbed in the Latin American play El Condor,
near Naples, November, 1962.
