## Kennedy Plans Record Budget $11.9 Billion Deficit, Tax Cut 
### 
WASHINGTON ( UPI)— President Kennedy yesterday pro
posed the biggest spending program in U.S. history—a -98.8 bil
lion red ink budget based on his proposed tax ent and calling for
a$J 1.9 billion deficit.
Republicans promptly denounced it as an incredible fiscal plan

that endangered chances for at
tax cut unless spending was trim
med drastically. Some Democrat
ic loaders praised it as progres
sive. But several key Democrats
were cautious, calling for spend
ing cuts.
THE PRESIDENT said the def
icit stemmed from the sluggish
economy, a flisease this three
year $lO billion lax cut was in
tended to cure. He called the defi
cit a transitional phase until tax
cuts boost the economy, increase
federal revenue and produce sur
pluses.
More unbalanced budgets lie
ahead, however. Treasury Sec
retary Douglas Dillon said next
year’s budget also would show a

♦
deficit and possibly the following
one. He looked for a balanced
budget in fiscal 1067 when full
employment should be reached.
Congressional GOP leaders
challenged the theory of any tax
cuts during a period of deficit fi
nancing. P'ew Republicans came
out flatly against tax reduction
now. But most said spending
must be trimmed to compensate
for the immediate loss in revenue.
PROTESTS also came from
such Democrats as chairman
Harry F. Byrd, D-Va., of the Sen
ate Finance Committee and Sen.
Clinton P. Anderson, D-N.M.
Byrd said a tax cut would boost
the deficit to $l4 billion.
Among the Democrats praising
the budget as sound was Speaker
John W. McCormack, Mass. He
said it was geared to the nation’s
actual and potential fiscal capa
city.
Kennedy told Congress that the
tax system must be revised if the
government is ever to end the
chronic deficits of recent years.
“Our present choice,” he said,
“is not between a fax cut and a
balanced budget.
“THE CHOICE, rather, is be
tween chronic deficits arising out
of a slow rale of economic growth
and temporary deficits stemming
from a tax program designed to
promote fuller use of our re
sources and more rapid economic
growth.”
The largest previous federal
outlay was in fiscal 194.T at the
peak of World War II when the
administration of the late Frank
lin D. Roosevelt spent $98.3 bil
lion, $3OO million less than the
new Kennedy program.
