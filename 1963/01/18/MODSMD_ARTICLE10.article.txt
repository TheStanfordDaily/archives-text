# Ralston Still Not 'In' As New Card Coach
## 
### 
UPI Stanford’s hunt for a
new football coach bogged down
in a sea of confusion yesterday
shortly after John Ralston of
Utah State appeared a shoo-in to
take the spot.
Ralston told the United Press
International from his Logan,
Utah home, “I am not in." He
added that, “no conclusions were
reached” following a meeting
with the Stanford brass Wednes
day.

At the same time, Bob Rey
nolds, a member of a Stanford
advisory committee on the selec
tion, was in Pebble Beach making
an 11th hour appeal to the Navy’s
Wayne Hardin to change his mind
and take the position formerly
held by Jack Curtice.

Hardin, who is playing at the
Big Crosby Gold Tournament,
Wednesday signed a new two
year pact i with the Middies and
told Reynolds that there wasn't
much chance of a change.

Reynolds, former Stanford star
and president of the Los Angeles
Angels baseball club, was report
edly one of a large segment of
Indian alumni from that part of
the state who opposed Ralston
because the latter played for arch
rival California and later was an
assistant coach there.
