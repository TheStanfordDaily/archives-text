# Sunday Night Flicks
## 
### 
Being a source of ASSU income netting $3,000 every year, the
Sunday night flicks are intended to entertain and earn money
doing it, according to Student Financial Manager Fred Nelson.
And so, the ASSU will present this Sunday “The Blob” and “I
Married a Monster from Outer Space.”
With this line-up of award-winners the student police are an
ticipating an outburst of “obscenity and vulgarity.” To prevent
these demonstrations the student police are preparing measures to
be taken against offenders. Wisecracks will be all right, but
nothing obscene.
This problem ot obscenity at the flicks has been acute in the
past when townspeople used to attend. When the problem became
especially acute this fall. Legislature acted to prevent the Univer
sity s name from becoming identified with puerile behavior of
students: they decided to refuse admission to everyone not having
a student body card or a faculty I.D. card. According to Nelson
it was either that or clean up the audience or improve the quality
of films. To have acted on the last alternative must have been
thought to be “reformist” or at least financially disastrous, for the
least straightforward alternative was chosen. Now it’s necessary
to clean up the audience, too, since a few LOL’s have been
slipping by along with an occasional faculty member.
