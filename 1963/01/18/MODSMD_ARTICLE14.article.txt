Dear Chappie, Attention Messrs.:
Coy, Jenkins, Stearns,
After every Chappie, some mul
tisigned plea to rid same of what
the writers call “SMUT” appears
in the Daily. Smut may not bo
the issue at all.
The Chappie doesn’t merit con
demnation for smut; it only mer
its condemnation for a generally
poor editorial, organizational, and
supervisory job.
“Layboy” and “Beer Belongs”
are in my estimation among the
best issues—although objection
able to some (who don’t have to
buy it if they don’t want to)—be
cause they have a topic and show
that someone in Preplanning
took the time to make certain

everyone knew the topic.
Smut is A-OK if it is carried
along in a standardized manner
—along a theme applicable to it.
A serialized comic (like Play
boy’s Fannie Annie) and the de
letion of a traditionally erotic
pose of a Stanford woman (?),
the institution of a stronger and
less back patting introduction
might do wonders to make the
Chappie a flexible institution,
rather than something that looks
like the authors mocked up at the
last moment before a midterm
with their minds on everything
else but the issue.
Could same comment about
unity apply to the Sequoia? the
Daily?
