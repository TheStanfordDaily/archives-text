# ON HOUSE RULES
## Charlie Gubser Scores Sanctimonious Sermons 
### 
(Editor’s note: In the Interests
of fair play for Charlie Gubser,
The Daily publishes the following
feature by Rep. Gubser, “On Capi
tol Hill with Charlie Gubser.” The
article came (o the attention of
The Daily through a Stanford
alumnus 'B5 who, having read the
editorial of Tu«*sday on the House
Rules Committee vote, was
prompted to write: “There are at
least two sides to every contro
versy. The newspa|>er of a great
university should reflcnt tins.
Don’t you think? Or don’t you
think?”)

Before the 88th Congress was
two hours old, it had defeated a
proposal to protect the rights of
a minority!
The new Congress had barely
begun when it was embroiled in
a battle over the House Rules.
The Democratic leadership ar
gued that the Rules Committee
should be composed of fifteen in
stead of twelve members to keep
bills from being bottled up in con
tradiction of the true “spirit of
Democracy.”
While amendments to the Rules
were being considered, Republi
cans, who comprise 40 per cent
of the House Membership, an
nounced their desire to offer
some amendments of their own.
They wanted 40 per cent or 6
members of the fifteen-man Com
mittee and the privilege of nam
ing 40 per cent of legislative com
mittee staffs to give minority
members assistance in promoting
minority views. They also asked
for an end to a rule which in
some situations denies the minor
ity any right to speak on a mat
ter before the House.
The sponsors of these “fair
play” amendments pointed out
that even though the GOP held
only 40 per cent of House seats,
48 per cent of the American peo
ple voted for Republican congres
sional candidates. They contend
ed that a sizeable minority of 48
per cent was entitled to at least
a 40 per cent voice in keeping
with the true “spirit of Democ
racy.”
But the “fair play” amend
ments met with foul play! The
majority leadership which was
urging the true “spirit of Democ
racy” in the rules fight used a
parliamentary device which de
nied the minority the opportunity
of even presenting its “fair play”
amendments, let alone voting up
on them.
So it seems that a narrow 52
per cent majority at the polls
carries with it an absolute power
of almost 100 per cent. The con
gressional patronage system pro
vides a good example.
There are approximately 1250
employees of the House of Repre
sentatives not including Members
and their staffs. Next year this

will go to about 1600. Of this
number the minority party has
the absolute right to select a
mere 33, including five policemen
and five page boys. Even the Re
publican Cloakroom where party
strategy is discussed is well
stocked with alert Democratic
pages who aren’t the least bit
hard of hearing!
I’ve personally seen enough pa
tronage employees reading news
papers in offices hidden from the
public’s beaten path on Capitol
Hill that I’m sure at least half of
them aren’t necessary. But they
aren't always idle! During the
last week many of them probably
have been busy selling $lOO tick
ets to the big Gala which Frankie
Sinatra will MC tonight. Others
have undoubtedly been helping to
make the phone calls to career
Civil Service workers who had
not responded to their “invita
tions” to attend —at a price of
$100!

Some of us who don’t agree
with the principle of the patron
age system must nevertheless ac
cept it in reality and we do. But
when we hear its managers
preach sanctimonious sermons on
the “spirit of Democracy’’ and the
“right of a minority” it some
times becomes a little too much!
