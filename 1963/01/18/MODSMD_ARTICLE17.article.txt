Editor, The Daily;
Concerning Wednesday’s re
view of the Chaparral, written by
a Daily reviewer under the pseu
donym Ellington K. Farthingale:
1— Howard Kaye's story, “Mur
der Is My Beat,” which The
Daily found “not funny in the
slightest” has been chosen for in
clusion in a nationwide anthology
of outstanding college humor.
2 Three of the Kelsie car
toons, which The Daily found
“deplorable” and “stupid,” have
been purchased by a national
magazine of wide circulation and
notoriously good taste.
Perhaps it is The Daily and
not the Chaparral’which hasfinal
ly “run out of humor.”
