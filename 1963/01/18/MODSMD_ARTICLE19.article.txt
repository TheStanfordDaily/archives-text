## Taking U.S. Military Commitment for Granted, De Gaulle Seeks Isolationist EEC without Britain 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
General De Gaulle has now said
publicly what he has been saying
privately since Britain decided to
apply for membership in the
Common Market. He is not too
much concerned about the eco
nomic matters which Mr. Heath
has been negotiating at Brussels.
These issues are not far from
settlement by compromise, and,
in any case, the general has been
willing to make arrangements
with Britain about commercial
matters. What he is resolutely op
posed to is that Britain should
profess and pretend to be a Eu
ropean power, that she should
have full membership and there
fore an equal voice with General
De Gaulle in the formation of the
political unity of Western Europe.

We must remember that while
the Common Market is a success
ful, going concern, the communi
ty as a political entity exists only
in a quite rudimentary form. To
develop the political community
will take, it is usually supposed

in Brussels and
Paris, another
three or four
years, and it is
for this forma
tive period that
General De
Gaulle wants to
exclude Great
Britain.
After that, per
haps, when a po

litical union has been established,
Britain would make an acceptable
member—if she subscribed un
conditionally to the political ar
rangements arrived at before her
admission. General De Gaulle
wants to present Britain with an
accomplished fact. He does not
intend to let Britain play her part
in accomplishing the fact.
Gaullist Europe, which is to be
organized while Britain is not
present, is to have as its core a
close partnership and alliance be
tween France and West Germany.
Around this Paris-Bonn nucleus

will gravitate Italy, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg,
pulled to Paris and Bonn by the
preeminent economic advantages
of the Common Market. In this
system. Paris will be the domi
nant political partner. It will rep
resent “Europe” in the interna
tional world.
Now that General De Gaulle
has spoken so much of his mind,
the calculations on which he is
acting will be put to the test. Can
the small continental Europe of
the six be organized as he wishes
it to be? Will Italy, Belgium and
the Netherlands accept the he
gemony of Paris plus Bonn? And,
even more critically, will West
Germany, after Adenauer de
parts, look primarily to Paris for
its foreign policy?

GENERAL De Gaulle has so of
ten been right about what he
could do that one hesitates to say
that he is not right now. But he
has certainly taken on a formida
ble task. He is proposing to iso
late the six continental countries
from the rest of Western Europe,
which includes Great Britain and
many other countries, and to iso
late this small Europe from the
Atlantic Community - which in
eludes the United States. Maybe
the Germans who come after
Adenauer will support him in
this. But he cannot count on that
with certainty. Maybe Italy and
the Low Countries will reluctant
ly acquiesce in a Gaullist Europe,
But we do not know what would
happen in such a small, isolated,
restrictive, Gaullist Europe.
There is a good reason, it seems
to me, to believe that the little
Gaullist Europe will Ik* restless
and perhaps turbulent. Recently,
when 1 was in Europe, I realized
how deep and wide is the fear of
a German and an Italian General
De Gaulle —that Is to say the
Gaullist authoritarianism without
General De Gaulle himself. For
the general is an exquisitely civi
lized Frenchman, and in his hands,
the liberties and humanities of
western civilization are quite

safe. But who would he the Ger
man General lie Gaulle, who the
Italian?

In Germany and Italy, men ask
that question. They have not for
gotten the Prussians and the
Nazis and the Fascists, and the
prospect of being locked up in
side a Gaullisl Europe is frighten
ing to them. The great majority
of people in Ihe center, the Chris
tian Democrats and the Social
Democrats, look with dismay and
foreboding on this prospect. That
is why, outside of France, there
is so strong a demand for the
presence of parliamentary Brit
ain and for a continuing associa
tion with the United States.

AGAINST this background, 1
find myself wondering about tire
timing of General Do Gaulle’s
press conference. On the one
hand, Dr Adenauer has only a
few more months in office. Unless
all the evidence now available is
false, his successor will be wholly
against the exclusion of Britain.
On the other hand, the British
government is having all the trou
bles which accumulate at the end
of a long term of office, and un
less its nerves remain very
steady, it could be provoked and
goaded into breaking off the
Brussels negotiations. Yet if Brit
tain were to withdraw its appli
cation before Dr. Adenauer quits
office, General De Gaulle’s
chances of having his way in Eu
rope would be greatly enhanced.
This is a strong reason for re
fusing to break off the negotia
tions while the true constellation
of forces within Europe is still
masked by Dr. Adenauer’s per
sonal relationship with General
De Gaulle.

As compared with what the
general said about Britain and
Europe, the passages about Po
laris and the Nassau agreement
are of minor importance. It has
never been conceivable that Gen
eral De Gaulle would not reject
the Nassau proposal. But this is
not so exciting or so important
as it sounds. For the day is a
long way off when France will
have nuclear forces that she
could or would use independently.

THE REAL situation is not that
France does not trust the United
States to deter Soviet aggression.
It is that General De Gaulle has
long been entirely sure that the
Soviet Union cannot and will not
engage in military aggression in
Europe. What Mr. Khrushchev
has just been saying in East Ber
lin has been the major premise
of General De Gaulle’s European
policy. In the maintenance of
peace, he takes the United States
for granted. He knows that we
are so irrevocably committed that
he can safely pursue an independ
ent, indeed an isolationist, Fiench
policy regardless of what wo
think of it.
