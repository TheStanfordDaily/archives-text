Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the Living
Group Selection Committee and
representative of the Stern
Houses, a group which will be
affected by the submitted propos
al, I would like to express my re
action to the committee’s deci
sion. It is necessary for one to re
alize the fact that the effects of
rush are not limited to one group
or groups. Indeed, these effects
ramify throughout the spectrum
of residence opportunities. Ac
cepting this, and given the vary
ing philosophies of the three sys
tems represented, a compromise
of sorts was inevitable. The rela
tively minor changes that have
been made, however, do not rep
resent a true compromise of phi
losophies of the groups. Rather
they constitute a pragmatic ac
commodation of incompatible
systems to each other in a fash
ion that sets the precedent for
further joint action.
Believing that the man should
choose the house and not the
house the man, I am in favor of
providing conditions which will
guarantee that this very crucial
decision be made in an objective
atmosphere where rational
thought processes can take place,
as they should on a university
campus. The proposal which has
been made will certainly not re
alize this goal. In fact it is much
closer to the positions of some of
the other groups than would have
resulted from a true compromise.
It is unfortunate that restrictions
of any type must be placed upon
what would otherwise be open ave
nues of intellectual and social
communication. Nevertheless, the
proposal does represent a new
positive attitude on the part of
the campus leadership. The status
quo is being replaced by the con
cept of total education where in
tellectual enrichment is encour
aged within the living group as
is concomitant with the concept
of a true university. The rush
proposal is a manifestation of this
new attitude. It is supported by
men who are aware of the com
plex problems inherent in the
rush question.
