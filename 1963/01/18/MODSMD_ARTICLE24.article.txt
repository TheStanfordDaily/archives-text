Editor, Tlie Daily;
“Ellington K. Farthingale’s’’ re
view of the Chaparral in Wednes
day's Daily was no review at all
—it was an hysterical attack on
something Mr, Farthingale
doesn’t seem to understand very
well: humor. This latest edition of
the Chappie is in their fine tra
dition of disrespect for the pow
ers that be (or think they be) on
the Stanford campus. It is cer
tainly no worse, and perhaps
somewhat better, than its imme
diate predecessors. In particular,

there were a large number of
| original and funny cartoons, no
] ticeably missing in the previous
issue.
It would be ridiculous for The
Daily to assign play reviews to a
reporter who happened to hate
plays. It is just as ridiculous to
give the Chaparral review to
someone with no sense of humor,
| particularly the rough and ready
j brand of humor native to Stan
ford. The Chappie deserves a fair
review, like anything else, and the
student body deserves a fair re
view of the Chappie.
