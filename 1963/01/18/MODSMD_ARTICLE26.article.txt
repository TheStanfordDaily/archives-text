# Cards Meet Upstart Huskies
## 
### PETE KING 
Washington’s unpredictable
Huskies, consigned by everyone
but themselves to the AAWU cel
lar, meet Stanford in the Pavilion
tonight and tomorrow in two bas
ketball games that will decide
the conference leadership.
The Huskies, losers in five of
their first eight games, shocked
all the forecasters two weeks ago
by edgittg UCLA twice in Seattle
and all but knocking the favored
Bruins out of the Big Six basket
ball race.
SINCE THEN they have built
their conference record to 3-1,
and basketball aficionados are
taking another look, albeit a short
one. at the upstart Huskies.
What they see is a team lack
ing any outstanding player, yet
at times managing to organize
what talent it does have into a

winning combination. Thus far
Washington is 6-6, with five of
its victories and three of its
losses coming by fewer than six
points.
The Huskies make up for a
ragged, cold-shooting offense
with a tenacious man-to-man de
fense and superior rebounding.
Their own brand of loose play
seems to be contagious, with
their opponents making more

than the usual number of mis
taks.
AT THE GUARDS are 6-3 Char
lie Hart and 6-4 Ron Paul, a pair
who specialize in missing long
shots and fouling out, hut who
can spark a comeback with their
drives and accurate passes to cen
ter Dale Easley.
Easley is a gangly, 6-7 senior,
averaging 16 points a game in
conference play. He isn’t especi
ally graceful, but can maneuver
his 210 pounds well under the
boards and his sloppy shots have
a habit of going through the
hoop.
Most dangerous Husky is 6-6
Ed Corel!, a mean-looking for
ward who Is the key man in
Washington’s attack. He leads
the AAWU in rebounding and is
third in scoring. Against UCLA,
while the Bruins were missing 15
straight shots, Corell pumped in
jump shots and lay-ins and dom
inated the backboards as Wash
ington outscored UCLA 19-1 to
wrap up the game.
At the other forward is 6-7
Steve Wilson, the Huskies’ best
shooter, who also snags plenty of
rebounds and an equal sprinkling
of fouls.
STANFORD’S lineup will read
like a wartime casualty list. Tom
Dose, the Indians’ leading scorer,
has the flu for the fourth time
this season and has missed work
outs this week, although he’ll be
playing. Forward Hollis Moore is
still nursing a sprained ankle and
is a doubtful player; guard Lew
Shupe has two sore ankles, but
should play; and reserve center
Craig Cordes is out for at least
four weeks as a result of a col
lapsed sinus cavity.

Despite those ailments, the In
dians will he strong favorites. In
a previous meeting in the L.A,
Classic, Stanford edged the Hus
kies. 63-62, in double overtime.
The game was hardly a true
comparison of the two teams.
After the first ten minutes Stan
ford led, 7-6, amid laughter from
the Spoils Arena crowd. At one
point neither team hit a basket
for nine minutes. Later on the
shooting picked up. Corell wound
up with 22 points and 16 rebounds
in a great individual effort.
TONIGHT Clayton Raaka will
be playing in place of Moore and
may substitute for Dose if the
Indians need rebounding strength.

This weekend’s basketball
games will be broadcast on

urday’s Stanford-Washington
basketball game will he tele
vised over KTVU, Channel 2,
at 8 p.m.
Washington’s unpredictable
Huskies, consigned by everyone
but themselves to the AAWU cel
lar, meet Stanford in the Pavilion
tonight and tomorrow in two bas
ketball games that will decide
the conference leadership.
The Huskies, losers in five of
their first eight games, shocked
all the forecasters two weeks ago
by edgittg UCLA twice in Seattle
and all but knocking the favored
Bruins out of the Big Six basket
ball race.
SINCE THEN they have built
their conference record to 3-1,
and basketball aficionados are
taking another look, albeit a short
one. at the upstart Huskies.
What they see is a team lack
ing any outstanding player, yet
at times managing to organize
what talent it does have into a

winning combination. Thus far
Washington is 6-6, with five of
its victories and three of its
losses coming by fewer than six
points.
The Huskies make up for a
ragged, cold-shooting offense
with a tenacious man-to-man de
fense and superior rebounding.
Their own brand of loose play
seems to be contagious, with
their opponents making more

than the usual number of mis
taks.
AT THE GUARDS are 6-3 Char
lie Hart and 6-4 Ron Paul, a pair
who specialize in missing long
shots and fouling out, hut who
can spark a comeback with their
drives and accurate passes to cen
ter Dale Easley.
Easley is a gangly, 6-7 senior,
averaging 16 points a game in
conference play. He isn’t especi
ally graceful, but can maneuver
his 210 pounds well under the
boards and his sloppy shots have
a habit of going through the
hoop.
Most dangerous Husky is 6-6
Ed Corel!, a mean-looking for
ward who Is the key man in
Washington’s attack. He leads
the AAWU in rebounding and is
third in scoring. Against UCLA,
while the Bruins were missing 15
straight shots, Corell pumped in
jump shots and lay-ins and dom
inated the backboards as Wash
ington outscored UCLA 19-1 to
wrap up the game.
At the other forward is 6-7
Steve Wilson, the Huskies’ best
shooter, who also snags plenty of
rebounds and an equal sprinkling
of fouls.
STANFORD’S lineup will read
like a wartime casualty list. Tom
Dose, the Indians’ leading scorer,
has the flu for the fourth time
this season and has missed work
outs this week, although he’ll be
playing. Forward Hollis Moore is
still nursing a sprained ankle and
is a doubtful player; guard Lew
Shupe has two sore ankles, but
should play; and reserve center
Craig Cordes is out for at least
four weeks as a result of a col
lapsed sinus cavity.

Despite those ailments, the In
dians will he strong favorites. In
a previous meeting in the L.A,
Classic, Stanford edged the Hus
kies. 63-62, in double overtime.
The game was hardly a true
comparison of the two teams.
After the first ten minutes Stan
ford led, 7-6, amid laughter from
the Spoils Arena crowd. At one
point neither team hit a basket
for nine minutes. Later on the
shooting picked up. Corell wound
up with 22 points and 16 rebounds
in a great individual effort.
TONIGHT Clayton Raaka will
be playing in place of Moore and
may substitute for Dose if the
Indians need rebounding strength.

The game was hardly a true
comparison of the two teams.
After the first ten minutes Stan
ford led, 7-6, amid laughter from
the Spoils Arena crowd. At one
point neither team hit a basket
for nine minutes. Later on the
shooting picked up. Corell wound
up with 22 points and 16 rebounds
in a great individual effort.
TONIGHT Clayton Raaka will
be playing in place of Moore and
may substitute for Dose if the
Indians need rebounding strength.

This weekend’s basketball
games will be broadcast on
radio stations K/SU, begin
ning at 6 p.m. with the frosb
game, and KCBS, 8 p in. Sat
urday’s Stanford-Washington
basketball game will he tele
vised over KTVU, Channel 2,
at 8 p.m.
Washington’s unpredictable
Huskies, consigned by everyone
but themselves to the AAWU cel
lar, meet Stanford in the Pavilion
tonight and tomorrow in two bas
ketball games that will decide
the conference leadership.
The Huskies, losers in five of
their first eight games, shocked
all the forecasters two weeks ago
by edgittg UCLA twice in Seattle
and all but knocking the favored
Bruins out of the Big Six basket
ball race.
SINCE THEN they have built
their conference record to 3-1,
and basketball aficionados are
taking another look, albeit a short
one. at the upstart Huskies.
What they see is a team lack
ing any outstanding player, yet
at times managing to organize
what talent it does have into a

winning combination. Thus far
Washington is 6-6, with five of
its victories and three of its
losses coming by fewer than six
points.
The Huskies make up for a
ragged, cold-shooting offense
with a tenacious man-to-man de
fense and superior rebounding.
Their own brand of loose play
seems to be contagious, with
their opponents making more

than the usual number of mis
taks.
AT THE GUARDS are 6-3 Char
lie Hart and 6-4 Ron Paul, a pair
who specialize in missing long
shots and fouling out, hut who
can spark a comeback with their
drives and accurate passes to cen
ter Dale Easley.
Easley is a gangly, 6-7 senior,
averaging 16 points a game in
conference play. He isn’t especi
ally graceful, but can maneuver
his 210 pounds well under the
boards and his sloppy shots have
a habit of going through the
hoop.
Most dangerous Husky is 6-6
Ed Corel!, a mean-looking for
ward who Is the key man in
Washington’s attack. He leads
the AAWU in rebounding and is
third in scoring. Against UCLA,
while the Bruins were missing 15
straight shots, Corell pumped in
jump shots and lay-ins and dom
inated the backboards as Wash
ington outscored UCLA 19-1 to
wrap up the game.
At the other forward is 6-7
Steve Wilson, the Huskies’ best
shooter, who also snags plenty of
rebounds and an equal sprinkling
of fouls.
STANFORD’S lineup will read
like a wartime casualty list. Tom
Dose, the Indians’ leading scorer,
has the flu for the fourth time
this season and has missed work
outs this week, although he’ll be
playing. Forward Hollis Moore is
still nursing a sprained ankle and
is a doubtful player; guard Lew
Shupe has two sore ankles, but
should play; and reserve center
Craig Cordes is out for at least
four weeks as a result of a col
lapsed sinus cavity.

Despite those ailments, the In
dians will he strong favorites. In
a previous meeting in the L.A,
Classic, Stanford edged the Hus
kies. 63-62, in double overtime.
