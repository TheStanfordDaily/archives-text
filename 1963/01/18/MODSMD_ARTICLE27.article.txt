# Strong Olympic Club to Test Ruggers; Hildebrand Injured
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
Stanford’s rugby squad opens
its season tomorrow against an
experience-laden Olympic Club
squad. Game time is 3 p.m. on
the rugby field.
John Hennesey, John Rosekans,
Dave Shultz, and Dave Marcelli
form the nucleus of what Stan
ford Coach Pete Kmetovic de
scribes as ‘‘a good, solid,” Olym
pic Club squad. ‘‘You have to
beat them,” he says, “They won’t

beat themselves.”
KMETOVIC’S squads don’t
beat themselves either. With a
record of 12 wins, one loss, and a
single lie last season, plus the
return of most of last year’s top
players, Stanford looks like the
class of the league.
This year the Cards have added
some valuable foreign talent in
the form of Gordon Waddell, a
grad student from Scotland and
a former member of the Scottish
all-star squad.
The international flavor will be
enhanced tomorrow by Henncsey,
an Irish import who has played
for the Olympic Club for the last
four seasons, and who is in Kme
tovic’s words, ‘‘one of the out
standing front row men in North
ern California.”
ROSEKANS is a 1919 graduate
of Stanford, and is currently pres
ident of the Northern California
Rugby Association. Shultz, an ex
cellent scrum half, is also an ex-
Stanford player.
Marcelli, another seasoned vet
eran and outstanding all-around
player, was a football standout
at St. Mary’s, back when St.
Mary’s still had football stand
outs.
A1 Hildebrand, who had been
expected to start for the Indians,
is nursing a knee injury. His
place will bo filled by Chuck
Buehler. Buehler is a second row
forward. He will be joined by
Dick Leeuwenberg, Ahead of
them will be Randy Devening at
hook and Troy Barbee and Randy
Vahan at props. Behind, Steve
Pursoll, Frank Patitucci, and Tim
Hansel will complete the Stan
ford forwards.
Starting backs are Waddell,
Bob Price, Clark Weaver. Hal
Steuber, Brad Freeman, Braden
Beck, and Jim Lynden.

The international flavor will be
enhanced tomorrow by Henncsey,
an Irish import who has played
for the Olympic Club for the last
four seasons, and who is in Kme
tovic’s words, ‘‘one of the out
standing front row men in North
ern California.”
ROSEKANS is a 1919 graduate
of Stanford, and is currently pres
ident of the Northern California
Rugby Association. Shultz, an ex
cellent scrum half, is also an ex-
Stanford player.
Marcelli, another seasoned vet
eran and outstanding all-around
player, was a football standout
at St. Mary’s, back when St.
Mary’s still had football stand
outs.
A1 Hildebrand, who had been
expected to start for the Indians,
is nursing a knee injury. His
place will bo filled by Chuck
Buehler. Buehler is a second row
forward. He will be joined by
Dick Leeuwenberg, Ahead of
them will be Randy Devening at
hook and Troy Barbee and Randy
Vahan at props. Behind, Steve
Pursoll, Frank Patitucci, and Tim
Hansel will complete the Stan
ford forwards.

Stanford’s rugby squad opens
its season tomorrow against an
experience-laden Olympic Club
squad. Game time is 3 p.m. on
the rugby field.
John Hennesey, John Rosekans,
Dave Shultz, and Dave Marcelli
form the nucleus of what Stan
ford Coach Pete Kmetovic de
scribes as ‘‘a good, solid,” Olym
pic Club squad. ‘‘You have to
beat them,” he says, “They won’t

beat themselves.”
KMETOVIC’S squads don’t
beat themselves either. With a
record of 12 wins, one loss, and a
single lie last season, plus the
return of most of last year’s top
players, Stanford looks like the
class of the league.
This year the Cards have added
some valuable foreign talent in
the form of Gordon Waddell, a
grad student from Scotland and
a former member of the Scottish
all-star squad.
