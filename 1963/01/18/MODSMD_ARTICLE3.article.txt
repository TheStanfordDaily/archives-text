### MICHAEL WAGGONER Managing Editor 
Tresidder is moderately satis
factory to those who eat there
and very unsatisfactory to those
who have their hair cut there, a
survey made by The Daily re
vealed yesterday.
The hashers interviewed said it
is a nice place to work over-all,
but they had some specific com
plaints. One hasher said she had
some doubts as to the Union’s
sanitary conditions.
A BUS BOV related a Freudian
dream sequence of fifteen white
coated robots rolling around on
tracks, pushing carts and picking
up trays.
One critic said ho was working
too long for wages too low.

nice physical plant, convenient,

a good place to take a date.”
People found the food fair
neither good or had. but like all
institution cooking, bland.

study in the Union. People who
study are bad because they make
those who want to eat. talk, and
be noisy feel guilty. Some stu
dents are worse—spreading term
papers, books, notes and type
writer around a designed-for-six
booth.
“The Union is a social center.
It is for people being personable.
Students should go to the RBR or
back to the Quad,” one student

THE TWENTY students inter
viewed about the barbershop
were almost unanimously dissat
isfied, with only a few expressing
a neutral attitude, and none fa
vorable.
“The prices.” complained one,
“arc too high.” “We wouldn’t
mind paying the high prices, if
we got good service. But we come

Even the barbers were dissatis
fied. They had had a few prob
lems with equipment, but their
main complaint was lack of cus
tomers. “Why don’t you tell the
students to come here? The
money from their haircuts helps
pay for their Union.”
