Like Stanford. Cal Poly has a young squad of which very little
j is known. However, the Mustangs have a new coach this year,
Vaughan Hitchcock, who is regarded as one of the best coaches in
the sport.
Hitchcock, in his first year as a college coach, is well known in
this area for his performance at Hayward and Castro Valley High
Schools. At both he developed a long series of outstanding wrestlers
and state championships. Among the wrestlers Hitchcock has de
veloped is Dan Barrett, Stanford’s 147-pounder.
As an aid for spectators unfamiliar with collegiate wrestling, a
brief review of wrestling rules and fundamentals will he given
before the Cal Poly meet and every following home meet.
The jayvees and frosh squad will meet San Quentin Saturday
at 11 a.m. at San Quentin, in their first meet.
