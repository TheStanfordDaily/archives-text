# Kosanke to See First Action As Frosh Meet Menlo, Sacramento
## 
### DAVID NYBERG 
Coach Bill Turner has promised
Stanford basketball fans a look
at Ray Kosanke, high school All-
American from Phoenix, Arizona,
when the freshmen battle Menlo
JC tonight and Sacramento City
College tomorrow. Kosanke’s col
legiate debut has been delayed
up till now by a knee operation
be underwent at the first of the
school year.

The starting team, however,
will be the same one which has
worked up a 3-2 record this sea
son with George Maentz and Bob
Bedell at forwards, Skip Hutch
ison and Jim Pandell in the back
court and Wayne Brazil in the
post position. Hutchison exploded
with 13 points worth of jump
shooting in last weekend’s twin
tilts, and Bedell has a high game
of 27 points against Cal. These
two with some part time help
from Kosanke, could very well

leave the Pavilion nets smolder
ing after their two nights’ work.
Menlo will depend a great deal
on the height of Lance Lund, a
6’5” forward who averages 18
points a game, and Dick Hallett,
.heir (>’t>” center to slow down the
Indian quintet while Sacramento
brings a fast but relatively small
squad to do battle.
