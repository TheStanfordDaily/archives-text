# Humanity Should Use Love To Bring Peace—Sandperl
## 
### 
By STEVE LEOPOLD
“Every man must make a per
sonal commitment to lead an ethi
cal life of truth and love, and he
must use these weapons of non
violence in the present political
struggle,” commented Ira Sand
perl, teacher at Peninsula High
School in Palo Alto and member
of the Committee on Non-Violent
Action, in a speech last night at
Tresidder Union.
Sandperl. a follower of Gandhi,
is the first of four speakers to ad
dress the new Peace Caucus of
the Political Union. His personal
credo was. “We must love one
another or die.” and he went on
to say that this individual com
mitment to peace is not enough,
“We must deal in politics, eco
nomics, and education.”
SANDPERL advocated “revo
lutionary and radical” methods of
non-violence, such as having stu
dents all over the country walk
out of their universities in pro
test against the nationalism
taught there. The object of such
acts is to replace the present in
stitutions of State, such as the
Congress, “which are ready to
kill,” with new institutions based
on non-violence and love. He said
that the insanity of today is
the fact that “each power is all
prepared to take everybody else
with them.”
THIS FACT, coupled with the
arms race, greatly worried the
bearded pacifist from Palo Alto.
He declared that he was not op
timistic although ho did think
that non-violence was more popu
lar today. “It is now bad form to
beat one’s children, but it is still
not bad form for Chinese peas
ants to kill Indian peasants in the
freezing hell of the Himalayas.”
This philosophy must be changed,
according to Sandperl, or the
world is headed for oblivion.
Sandperl could also find no sol
ace in the past. Only one man,
Gandhi of India, did something
worthwhile in the political field.
Other pacifists, namely Jesus,
Tolstoy, and Socrates taught men
how to live ethical lives, but man
kind prefers to be led by the
Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and

Nehrus because they are “practi
cal men.”
Sandperl commented on this
philosophy in his conclusion, “I
think it is more practical to fol
low the prophets and love one
another. If the holocaust comes,
most of us will be dead already—
like a dead tree that still stands
devoid of the life-giving sap of
Ive.”

Tresidder Union.
Sandperl. a follower of Gandhi,
is the first of four speakers to ad
dress the new Peace Caucus of
the Political Union. His personal
credo was. “We must love one
another or die.” and he went on
to say that this individual com
mitment to peace is not enough,
“We must deal in politics, eco
nomics, and education.”
SANDPERL advocated “revo
lutionary and radical” methods of
non-violence, such as having stu
dents all over the country walk
out of their universities in pro
test against the nationalism
taught there. The object of such
acts is to replace the present in
stitutions of State, such as the
Congress, “which are ready to
kill,” with new institutions based
on non-violence and love. He said
that the insanity of today is
the fact that “each power is all
prepared to take everybody else
with them.”
THIS FACT, coupled with the
arms race, greatly worried the
bearded pacifist from Palo Alto.
He declared that he was not op
timistic although ho did think
that non-violence was more popu
lar today. “It is now bad form to
beat one’s children, but it is still
not bad form for Chinese peas
ants to kill Indian peasants in the
freezing hell of the Himalayas.”
This philosophy must be changed,
according to Sandperl, or the
world is headed for oblivion.
Sandperl could also find no sol
ace in the past. Only one man,
Gandhi of India, did something
worthwhile in the political field.
Other pacifists, namely Jesus,
Tolstoy, and Socrates taught men
how to live ethical lives, but man
kind prefers to be led by the
Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and

Nehrus because they are “practi
cal men.”
Sandperl commented on this
philosophy in his conclusion, “I
think it is more practical to fol
low the prophets and love one
another. If the holocaust comes,
most of us will be dead already—
like a dead tree that still stands
devoid of the life-giving sap of
Ive.”
