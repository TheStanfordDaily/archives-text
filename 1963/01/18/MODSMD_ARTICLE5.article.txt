# Mrs. Tresidder Speaks At Chi Psi Fireside
## 
### 
To Stanford ski enthusiasts,
Tresidder is more than the name
of a Union. It was Donald B. Tre
sidder, for whom the Union is
named, and his wife who brought
skiing to California.
Mrs. Tresidder, as guest speak
er in the Chi Psi Fireside Lecture
Series last night, told how she and
her husband introduced skiing to
Yosemite in the late 1920’s and
early 1930’5.
“The calibre of skiing was very
amateurish then,” she said. “Even
in a minor race today, all the
skiers are much better than those
in the Nationals during the 1930’5.
The development is unbelievable.”
The improvement began when
the Tresidders brought in Euro
pean experts to teach at Yosem
ite.
Until 1931. when a facility was
established in the high country,
skiing was all done in Yosemite
Valley.
But the Tresidders were still
looking for a major ski resort for
the area. Mrs. Tresidder recalled
that she and a Swiss professional
hiked around the high country
for months before settling on
Badger Pass, which opened in
1935.
Mrs. Tresidder, a Stanford
graduate in 1915, is still an avid
skier. She has skied at most of
the famous ski areas the world
over. “Skiing has been a whole
lot of my life,” she said.
Mrs. Tresidder was first Lady
of Stanford from 1943-48 when
her husband was president of the
University.
