# Donner House Decorates Lounge

### DANIEL SCHWARTZ Staff Editor 
The members of Donner House, during Christ
mas vacation and the first part of Winter Quarter,
redecorated their lounge using their own plans,
labor and money.
University policy in the past, according to Don
ner President Robert Ricklefs, has not allowed
members of university dormitories to do any re
decorating work on any part of their dormitories,
although, in a few cases, the houses have been
able to repaint rooms or halls.
RICKLEFS TOLD THE Daily that he felt the
■‘secret of Donner’s success” was “taking the in
itiative and being persistent.”
He said that he had submitted a detailed plan
to John W. Moore, the Director of the Stern
Houses, which was then "taken into consideration”
by John E. Forsberg, the Director of Residences,
and finally by members of the Business Office.
A meeting of students and administration mem
bers was held in the first part of December to
make the final plans for the lounge. The members
of the administration stipulated that nothing “of
a permanent nature” could he built in the lounge
and thus vetoed a plan to install new ceiling light
ing and a permanent partition.
PLANS WERE APPROVED, however, for pan
elling two of the walls of the lounge and the

painting of ail necessary areas.
The expenses were taken care of by a S2OO
appropriation out of house funds and an ASSU
loan of “up to $400.”
The redecoration, which was completed Tues
day, also includes the repainting of (he entrance
and stairway, plus the hanging of pictures which
are on loan from the Stanford Museum.
A small room adjoining the main lounge will
be decorated in a gas-light fashion, although it
has not been completed because the red flocked
wall paper, which is on order, has not yet arrived.
The room will also have gas light and chandelier
fixtures.
UK KLKFS SAID THAT the greatest advan
tage of the newly redecorated lounge will be in
creased utilization, which was “not used before,
but which is now the center of the house.
An increase in house spirit has also become
apparent, he said. “Because most of the members
of the house in some way contributed to the work,
they feel more a part of the house.”
An even more important advantage, however,
he said, was to show that “an independent house
could take the initiative in their house and do a
good job.”
Ricklefs added that there apparently were
plans for future improvements of the Stern
Houses, but that Donner “just couldn't wait.”
