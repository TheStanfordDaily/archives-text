Campus religious activity, tl
turc’s affairs, and the students’ i
were the major issues discussed
Pan-sectarianism has been ap
interpretation of the Founding G
sity must he maintained upon at
strictly non-partisan basis.”
LASSU will recommend this in
terpretation to tiie administra
tion.

A RESOLUTION to condemn
the activities of the Senate Inter
nal Securities Subcommittee’s in
vestigation of the Pacifica Foun
dation led to the broader ques
tion of whether the student legis
lature has the right to speak on
behalf of the entire student body
without consulting them and
whether it has the right to recom
mend action concerning policies
which are outside the university
community. The difficulty of de
termining the wishes of their
constituents, the responsibility of
the legislature to exercise its free
judgment, and the broader inter
ests of a university were listed
in the advocacy of a greater au
thority for the legislature. Those
who rejected this authority point
ed to other means by which stu
dents could voice their opinions
(letters to The Daily, contact of
representatives, or recall of rep
resentatives) and to a more lim
ited role for the student legisla
ture member. The members of
the student legislature decided to
take this problem to their con
stituents before considering it
further.

The legislature passed a reso
lution asserting the right of the
students to help formulate the
educational policy f the Univer
sity. The resolution’s recommend
ations include student participa
tion in faculty evaluation and
student assistance in setting stan
dards for instruction.

Among other things discussed
at the legislature’s meeting were
the crowding at University func
tions, and the lack of discipline
at the Sunday night “Flicks.”
THE STUDENT members of

u* scope of the student legisla
tes in shaping university policy
! at last night’s LASSU meeting,
jproved by legislature as a valid
•rant s intention that “the Univer-

the Committee on Public Exer
cises were asked to recommend
some kind of restriction upon peo
ple who attend University func
tions and are not associated with
the University.
The problems posed by the
Sunday night Flicks include the
following: why should order be
enforced (when such movies as
the “Blob” are shown), and how
is order to be enforced (when en
thusiasm gets out-of-hand)?
Further disciplinary measures
were not recommended.
