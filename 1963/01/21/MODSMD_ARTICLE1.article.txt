## Russ Will Accept Inspection On Own Soil for Test Ban 
### 
United Press International
WASHINGTON — Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev has
agreed in principle to international inspection on Soviet soil as part
of any nuclear test ban, it was disclosed last night.
Khrushchev’s move in letters to Kennedy dated Dec. 19 and Jan.
7. and made public last night In Washington and Moscow, raised
cautious new hopes for a test ban agreement.
The exchange of letters led to U.S.-Soviet test ban talks in New
York this past week. These talks will now resume in Washington
tomorrow, with Britain also present.
In his Dec. 19 letter, Khrushchev offered “in cases when it
would be considered necessary” to permit international inspection
teams to make two to three trips a year to Russia to check against
earth tremors which might be confused with underground nuclear
tests.
This was actually a return to a position Russia took several
years ago. But in November, 1961, the Soviet Union backtracked and
completely barred the concept of any on-site inspections for a test
ban.
Khrushchev implied in his letter that U.S. officials had recently
said two to three annual inspections would be enough.
But President Kennedy, in a reply to the Soviet leader Dec. 28,
also made public last night, said Khurshchev seemed to have “some
misunderstanding” about this.
Kennedy said the only number for such inspections mentioned
earlier was “between 8 and 10.” He made clear that the two to three
inspections offered by Khrushchev were not enough, but that the
United States wanted to explore the issue in further talks.
Kennedy and Khrushchev, in their exchange, also discussed
placing unmanned, automatic monitoring devices on Soviet soil.
Khrushchev agreed, apparently for the first time, to permit
“foreign personnel” to place the “black boxes.” as they are called,
on their locations, provided measures were taken to prevent such
trips from being used for “reconnaissance" or “espionage.”
Khrushchev said he believed three such “black boxes” would be
enough. Kennedy called this “helpful” but said it “does not seem to
me to go far enough.”
The President said the locations suggested by Khrushchev were
outside the areas of highest earthquake activity in Russian. U.S.
officials said the exact number of automatic stations the United
States would agree to would depend partly on the number of on-site
inspections permitted, and on details of how they were set up.
Officials said they were “encouraged” by Khrushchev’s overture,
although they stressed it still might not mean agreement could be
reached on details.

TAX CUT PROSPECTS DIM: MANSFIELD WASHINGTON
Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield, Mont., said yesterday he
doubted that Congress would approve a tax cut this year. He thought
it probably would be 1964 before a bill was cleared by the lawmakers.
Mansfield also insisted that any tax reduction be linked with
revenue-producing reforms in the system. On this point, as on the
probable timing of a tax cut, he differed with members of his own
party as well as a number of Republicans.
