# Stanford Signs Ralston As Head Football Coach
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON Sports Editor 
Stanford signed John Ralston of Utah State to a three-year
contract as head football coach last Friday, replacing Jack Curtice,
formerly of Utah, who was fired on November 26. The announce
ment was no surprise as rumors had been centered around Ral
ston s name ever since he was seen on the campus last week.

Ralston has been considered-*
from the beginning of the 53-day
search along with about one hun
dred other names suggested by
alumni, faculty, and administra
tors. Unlike most of the others,
however, he survived the paring
down that occurred during the
various stages of the decision.
FIRST, athletic director A1
Masters and assistant director
Chuck Taylor gathered informa
tion about the candidates; their
work was supplemented by a
special six-member alumni com
mittee appointed by President
J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Thus, the original list was re
duced to 12 men, all of whom
were interviewed jointly by Ster
ling, Masters, Taylor, and John
Hurlburt, a law professor and the
representative from the faculty
athletic committee.
Utah State was Ralston’s first
head coaching position. The thir
ty-five-year-old coach was a huge
success there, compiling a 31-11-1
five-year record. When he ar
rived in 1958, the Aggies were the
New York Mets of the Skyline
Conference, but by 1960, they
were co-champs and national
rushing offense leaders. They re
peated as co-champs in 1961 and
led the U.S. in scoring and rush
ing defense that year.
RALSTON has a reputation for
stressing the fundamentals
fblocking and tackling) of foot
ball according to Taylor. Ho uses
a wing-T formation, similar to
Curtice’s, and features frequent
passes and sweeps in a wide open
offense, as substantiated by the
nation-leading statistics of his
teams.

Ralston's image in Utah is out
standing. according to several
football players from that area
now at Stanford. “I imagine the
people will make quite a stink
about him leaving,” said Dennis
Hansen, a frosh end this year
from Murray.
He is also an extremely suc
cessful recruiter. “He’s the most
personable coach I met,” said
Gary Sargent, co-captain of this
year’s Indian team and a resident
of Salt Lake City. “The strength
of his recruiting program lies in
the friendly, informal contact be
tween the high school players and
the Utah State coaches.”

SEVERAL people have empha
sized Ralston’s articulateness and
ability to communicate in all sorts
of situations. Joe Higgins, a P.E.
teacher at Stanford and formerly
a co-worker of Ralston’s as Aggie
swimming coach was very com
plimentary. “He’s a fine teacher
of the game,” said Higgins; “he
appeals to the kids and their par
nets, communicates well with the
alumni, and is a good administra
tor, establishing close, non-domi
neering interaction with his as
sistants.”

Besides his youth and abilities
as a coach, recruiter, and admin
istrator, a significant factor in
Ralston’s hiring is his indigenous
ness to the Bay Area. He was
born in Oakland and went to Cal
ifornia, where he played lineback
er and coached under Pappy Wal
dorf in 1948-51 and 1956-58 re
spectively. During the latter peri
od, he worked and lived with Jim
Lawson, a former' assistant coach
at Stanford and an influential

alumnus here. Lawson was sig
nificant in supporting Ralston for
coach.

FURTHER, Ralston coached at
two Bay Area high schools and
thus came into contact with Tay
lor, when he was head coach at
Stanford.

The Stanford community will
have a better chance to get ac
quainted with Ralston today as
he is holding a press conference
at noon and will meet the foot
ball team tonight.
