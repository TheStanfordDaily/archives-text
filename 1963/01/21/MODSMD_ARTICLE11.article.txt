# Indians Ambush UW; Lead AAWU
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford established itself as
the team to beat in the AAWU
basketball race last weekend by
sweeping a pair of games from a
highly erratic Washington team
in the Pavilion. The scores were
57-48 and 58-49.
Junior Tom Dose and Senior
Don Clemetson turned in their
usual fine performances, but
sophomore Clayton Raaka, who
played his best two games of the
season, had much to do with the
outcome.

DOSE HAD 34 points for the
two games and hold Washington
center Dale Easley to only nine
points on Saturday night. Clemel
son played brilliantly both nights,
tallying 36 points, making numer
ous steals, and making the Card
offense click with his floor lead
ership.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
decided to let Raaka, who hadn’t
played first-string basketball
since high school, play the
entire game Friday night. Raaka
justified his decision by hauling
down 17 lebounds and holding
Husky forward Ed Corell to five
of 14 shots from the field. The
next night he had nine more re
bounds and added 11 points, in
cluding some crucial free throws.
Friday night the Huskies must
have set a record for myopic
shooting. They could hit on only
two of 26 shots, the second com
ing with 11 seconds left, for a
glorious 7.7 per cent and eight
points.

ALTHOUGH hitting only 34
per cent. Stanford rapidly pulled
away from the hapless Huskies.
The Tribe held a 31-8 halftime
lead, and Indian rooter's were
gleefully waiting for the mas
sacre to continue.

However, they hadn’t figured
on the law of averages or on
Washington's rebounding. Sinking
half their shots, the Huskies
reeled off 12 straight points to
cut Stanford’s lead to 37-26.
Later, a five-minute scoring spree
produced 13 points, and the In
dians led by only seven.

CLEMETSON then took con
trol and sank six of the last eight
Card points to sew up the game.

Saturday the TV cameras
were on and Washington settled
down to business. They put two
and sometimes three men on
Dose, limiting him to two baskets.
