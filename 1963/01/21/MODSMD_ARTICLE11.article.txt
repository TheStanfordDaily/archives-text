# Indians Ambush UW; Lead AAWU
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford established itself as
the team to beat in the AAWU
basketball race last weekend by
sweeping a pair of games from a
highly erratic Washington team
in the Pavilion. The scores were
57-48 and 58-49.
Junior Tom Dose and Senior
Don Clemetson turned in their
usual fine performances, but
sophomore Clayton Raaka, who
played his best two games of the
season, had much to do with the
outcome.

DOSE HAD 34 points for the
two games and hold Washington
center Dale Easley to only nine
points on Saturday night. Clemel
son played brilliantly both nights,
tallying 36 points, making numer
ous steals, and making the Card
offense click with his floor lead
ership.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
decided to let Raaka, who hadn’t
played first-string basketball
since high school, play the
entire game Friday night. Raaka
justified his decision by hauling
down 17 lebounds and holding
Husky forward Ed Corell to five
of 14 shots from the field. The
next night he had nine more re
bounds and added 11 points, in
cluding some crucial free throws.
Friday night the Huskies must
have set a record for myopic
shooting. They could hit on only
two of 26 shots, the second com
ing with 11 seconds left, for a
glorious 7.7 per cent and eight
points.

ALTHOUGH hitting only 34
per cent. Stanford rapidly pulled
away from the hapless Huskies.
The Tribe held a 31-8 halftime
lead, and Indian rooter's were
gleefully waiting for the mas
sacre to continue.

However, they hadn’t figured
on the law of averages or on
Washington's rebounding. Sinking
half their shots, the Huskies
reeled off 12 straight points to
cut Stanford’s lead to 37-26.
Later, a five-minute scoring spree
produced 13 points, and the In
dians led by only seven.

CLEMETSON then took con
trol and sank six of the last eight
Card points to sew up the game.

Saturday the TV cameras
were on and Washington settled
down to business. They put two
and sometimes three men on
Dose, limiting him to two baskets.
Raaka and Clcmetson took up
the slack, however, and Stanford
held a shaky. 29-26 lead at the
half.

Midway in the second half the
Tribe doggedly clung to a slim
lead with the aid of 10 free
throws. Husky sophomore Dick
Lee, who had taken only three
shots all season, kept piercing
the Indian defense for easy lay
ups. and a three-point play by
Easley brought Washington to
within five points with eight min
utes remaining.
THEN RAAKA muscled his
way through three Huskies un
der the basket and scored to
make it 49-41, and Stanford coast
ed from there.

The win gave Stanford its
twelfth victory in 15 games and
a 3-0 mark in the Big Six. It was
the eighth loss in 14 games for
Washington, and gave them a 3-3
conference record. They are tied
with Cal (2-2) for second place.
In losing, Washington demon
strated that they are probably
the best rebounding team in the
conference. In the second half on
Friday night, the Huskies beat
Stanford 30-15 on the boards
while scoring 40 points. Corell
and Easley picked off 17 rebounds

apiece for the game.
WASHINGTON basketball
teams have never been known
j for their poise when away from
home. Coach John Grayson’s
j 1962-63 edition kept the tradition
alive in grand style by frittering
the ball away on errors a total of
40 times in two games. Most gen
erous Husky was temperamental
crowd-pleaser Charlie Hart. who
traveled, fouled, or threw the ball
away at least 12 times, in addi
tion to fouling out midway in the
second half of Friday’s game.
