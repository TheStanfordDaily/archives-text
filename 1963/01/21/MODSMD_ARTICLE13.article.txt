The University of Mississippi and the state are now living
through a time of troubles made inevitable by the racists who con
verged on Oxford, Miss., last September. In the eyes of the nation
Mississippi is a lawless haven for men who not only preach but
also practice disrespect for law, order, and racial equality. Al
though Southern states have for many years home the reproaches
of the North, Mississippi today must face greater trouble: the
prospect of an already deplorable educational system degenerating
into a system exalting ignorance and teaching intolerance.

At the university in Oxford thirty or forty professors are looking
for jobs somewhere else—anywhere else. These are men who find
the university administration negligent in upholding law and order
in good faith and who find the Oxford environment singularly
unsuitable for teaching. Yesterday the Associated Press quoted
one professor as saying “my only comment is that it is going to be*
hard to get a moving van here in May.” if the predicted mass
exodus comes in May, then Mississippi’s already small company
of educated men will vanish altogether and white men will be
able to live in depraved ignorance segregated from the modern,
educated world. White men will be able to live without the dis
comfort of knowing that the rest of the world is different, that the
rest of the world is working toward the solution of the Twentieth
Century’s greatest problems while Mississippi revives those of the
1860’s. Mississippi will have segregated herself from the world,
its challenges, and its progress.
