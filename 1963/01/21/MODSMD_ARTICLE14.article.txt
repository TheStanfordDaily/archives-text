Editior, The Daily:
I wish to correct an error ap
pearing in both of Mr. Reppy’s
articles on stimulant, or “pep”
•ills which appeared in The Daily
an January 16 and 17.
In both articles Mr. Reppy
states that the amphetamine, or
dexedrlne type of drug can be
purchased without prescription,
over the counter, —or at least
gives this strong impression.
Further, in his first article, he
suggests that “NoDoz” is an am
phetamine containing drug.
The amphetamines,—such as
dexedrine, benzedrine, and methe
drine, —can legally be obtained
only by prescription, and are not,
(fortunately,) available over the
counter, although there do exist
illegal black-market sources.
"NoDoz,” which is a non-pre
scription item, and which may be
legally purchased over the coun
ter, is merely caffeine in pill
form and contains no ampheta
mine whatsoever. Thus they are
by no means so dangerous, nor
truly addicting, as they fail to
provide for very long the intense
wakefulness and euphoria pro

vided by the amphetamines. Fa
tigue usually wins out in time to
save the organism from confu
sion or collapse.
However, even caffeine in high
dosage may stimulate beyond the
point of efficiency, and promote
an over-rapid jumping of the mind
from subject to subject at the ex
pense of ti'ue concentration, —par-
ticularly when coupled with fa
tigue,—and in an occasional, sus
ceptible subject, can reproduce
the effects of amphetamines.
So, at the worst, it is occasional
ly as dangerous in a crisis as the
true "pep” pills,—and a good deal
of the time it just doesn’t do what
the student hopes.
No drug of any kind can ever
take the place of regular, consci
entious study, nor implant a
Quarter’s worth of knowledge in
a few nights.

Editior, The Daily:
I wish to correct an error ap
pearing in both of Mr. Reppy’s
articles on stimulant, or “pep”
•ills which appeared in The Daily
an January 16 and 17.
In both articles Mr. Reppy
states that the amphetamine, or
dexedrlne type of drug can be
purchased without prescription,
over the counter, —or at least
gives this strong impression.
Further, in his first article, he
suggests that “NoDoz” is an am
phetamine containing drug.
The amphetamines,—such as
dexedrine, benzedrine, and methe
drine, —can legally be obtained
only by prescription, and are not,
(fortunately,) available over the
counter, although there do exist
illegal black-market sources.
"NoDoz,” which is a non-pre
scription item, and which may be
legally purchased over the coun
ter, is merely caffeine in pill
form and contains no ampheta
mine whatsoever. Thus they are
by no means so dangerous, nor
truly addicting, as they fail to
provide for very long the intense
wakefulness and euphoria pro

vided by the amphetamines. Fa
tigue usually wins out in time to
save the organism from confu
sion or collapse.
However, even caffeine in high
dosage may stimulate beyond the
point of efficiency, and promote
an over-rapid jumping of the mind
from subject to subject at the ex
pense of ti'ue concentration, —par-
ticularly when coupled with fa
tigue,—and in an occasional, sus
ceptible subject, can reproduce
the effects of amphetamines.
So, at the worst, it is occasional
ly as dangerous in a crisis as the
true "pep” pills,—and a good deal
of the time it just doesn’t do what
the student hopes.
No drug of any kind can ever
take the place of regular, consci
entious study, nor implant a
Quarter’s worth of knowledge in
a few nights.
