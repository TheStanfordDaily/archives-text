# IN THE CONGO
## Giving Katanga to Central Gov't, No Way to Halt Communist Influence 
### RICHARD WEINIG 
Tshombe has surrendered. Af
ter unleashing three wars of at
trition against him. the United
Nations—the body which is "to
save the succeeding generations
from the scourge of war” has at
last forced the secessionist Ka
tanga Province to submit to the
authority of Cyrille Adoula’s Cen
tral Congolese Government. And
one might well ponder the conse
quences of this union.
As many of my liberal brethren
well know, I am loath to hurl
psychological epithets at my po
litical opponents. But after exam
ining American support of the
United Nations policies which
have prompted Tshomhe’s sur
render, one is tempted to ask; Is
Mr. Kennedy in full possession of
his mental faculties? If so, it is
difficult to perceive how he could
affirm U Thant’s program for
“unifying” the Congo while still
professing the desirability of
weakening communist influence
in Central Africa.
On the surface, the reasons for
terminating the Katanganese se
cession seem perfectly cogent.
IT WAS, first, argued by Mr.
Thant that Katanga is an indi
genous part of the Congo: ethnic
ally, geographically, and histori
cally. As such, it Is not and has
never been a nation, entitled to
the right of self-determination.
And, as such, it must be returned
to the political entity from which
it seceded.
It was contended, secondly
that Tshombe is but a white
man’s pawn: maintained by the
Union Miniere, buttressed by ar
mies of white mercenaries, en
deared to the Soviet Union, and
entirely devoid of native support.
With such leadership, his prov
ince is misgoverned, totters on
the brink of Bolshevism, and will
continue to do so until it is placed
under the control of Adoula’s
Government.

Mr. Thant’s third, and presum
ably most important, reason for
sanctioning military action
against Katanga was economic in
nature. Without Katanganese rev
enue, he asserted, the pro-West
ern Central Government will be
unable to maintain itself. Unless
the legendary Katanganese treas
ure chest is opened to it, the
Adoula Government must be
driven into bankruptcy and de
livered into the hands of Antoine
Gizenga and his communists.
Therefore, those wishing to weak
en communist influence in the
Congo have no choice but to place
the Katanga Province under the
complete control of the Central
Government.
HOW REASONABLE, Now,
who could disagree with that?
No one could—if Mr. Thant’s ar
guments had been based upon
fact, rather than the desire to ar
ticulate a campaign platform by
which a perfectly good, second
rate, Burmese politician could
garner the Afro-Asian-Soviet
votes requisite for his election as
Secretary-General.
Unfortunately, any relationship
between Mr. Thant’s arguments
and the truth seems purely coin
cidental.

The charge that Katanga is not
a separate nation from the rest
of the Congo is rather incredible.
The Province is larger in geo
graphic area than are fully one
third of the members of the
United Nations. It is the geo
graphic key to the richest miner
al deposits in Central Africa.
MOREOVER, the Province is
economically self-sustaining. It
produces 73 per cent of the
world’s cobalt; 80 per cent of the
world's industrial diamonds; 60
per cent of the Free World’s
uranium: 8 per cent, of the
world’s copper; and is endowed
with rich agricultural potential.
Its capital, Elisabethville, has
been described by American busi
nessmen as “a potential Chicago
of Centra] Africa.” (Sen. Thomas
J. Dodd, D-Conn. “Congressional
Record,” Sept. 8, 1961. Senator
Dodd’s 73 per cent ADA voting
record hardly distinguishes him
as a right-wing extremist.)
Furthermore, in contrast to the
myth forcibly maintained by the
Belgians, Katanga has always
been a separate political entity
from the rest of the Congo—eth
nically, culturally, and historical
ly. Tribal bonds and geo-economic
propinquity bind it more closely,
if anything, to the Rhodesias
than to Leopoldville. And here, I
rely upon the testimony of such
men as Dr. Albert Schweitzer,
Howard Brinton, and Paul M.
Alexander—missionaries who had
lived in the area for nearly half a
century before the President de
cided that G. Mcnnen Williams’
expertise in the manufacture of
after shave lotion and men’s stick
deoderant eminently qualified
him to become Undersecretary
of State for African Affairs.
(Confer the “Congressional Rec
ord,” Jan. 24, 1962, pp. 766-67;
Aug. 3. 1962, pp. 14538-39.)
Also, in refreshing contradis
tinction to its counterpart in
Leopoldville, the Tshombe Gov
ernment has manifest some ability
to govern. Smith Hempstone—
who has spent more time in the
Congo and certainly in Katanga

than any other American corre
spondent concurs with Messrs.
Schweitzer, Brinton, and Alexan
der that Tshombe’s government
is the only part of the Congo in
which law and order has been
maintained. In all probability, it
has achieved a more harmonious,
productive relationship between
the black and white races than
any other state in black Africa.
(“Congressional Record." Oct. 12,
1962, p. 22049.)
MOREOVER, these gentlemen
contend that Tshombe is the most
pro-Western leader - in black Afri
ca. Having removed all commu
nists from office and government
al positions, and having expelled
all Russian and Chinese person
nel from the Province, Tshombe’s
Katanga is the only state in black
Africa to manifest a strong de
sire to affiliate itself with the
West, culturally and economical
ly. (Ibid.) His popularity with
the communists is attested to by
the fact that not only did the So
viet Union not veto United Na
tions actions against Tshombe in
the Security Council. It, in fact,
vigorously supported U Thant’s
proposals. (Hernpstone. “Congres
sional Record.” Oct. 12, 1962. p.
22060.)

In addition to these accomplish
ments, Tshombe’s popular sup
port, particularly in southern Ka
tanga, is overwhelming. In Mr.
Hempstone's words: “He is, after
all, the lawfully elected leader of
Katanga. Had his regime been
propped up only by the mining
interests and a group of mercen
aries which never in the wildest
dreams of the UN exceeded 500
and seldom, in actuality, amount
ed to a fifth of that number, sure
ly it would have toppled under
assault by UN troops in Septem
ber and December of 1961. (“Con
gressional Record.” Oct. 12, 1962.
p. 22061.)
It is difficult to see why such
credentials do not entitle Katanga
to the same l ight of self-determi
nation which both the United Na
tions and the State Department
have seen fit to recognize in
countless other African states
during the past five years; and
most recently, in the tiny, impov
erished, leaderless tracts of bush
and jungle known as Ruanda and
Burundi.

YET, NOT only has this right
been denied. The United States
has provided nearly 75 per cent
of the United Nations revenue
which has been used to force the
most valuable and pro-Western
area in black Africa under the
Central Congolese Government in
which:

The Minister of the Interior,
who controls all police is Chris
topher Gbneye, a communist loy
al to Gizenga and probably train
ed in Prague;
The Minister of Justice, who
controls the courts, is Remy
Mwamba, a communist appointed
by Gizenga;
THE PERSON second in com
mand of the Congolese Army is
General Victor Lundula, an ar
dent follower of the communist
Gizenga; (Throughout 1962, the
United Nations has flown large

bodies of Gizengist troops under
Lundula’s leadership into north
ern Katanga, where they have
engaged in widespread pillaging.»
The man who had, until recent
ly, been appointed by Adoula to
govern Katanga is Egide Bio
chely-Davidson, described by Sen
ator Dodd as “one of the most
dangerous leftists in the Congo.”
Acquaintances of Blochely-David
son have identified him as “an
agent of the Soviet Secret Po
lice.” (Sen. Dodd. “Congressional
Record. Sept. 8, 19, 22, 1961; Jan.
25, 1962, p. 765-76; Aug. 3, 1962,
p. 14533. For arguments to the
contrary, albeit weak ones, see
the remarks of Senators Church
and Humphrey. “Congressional
Record.” Sept. 20, 21, 1961.)
Furthermore, by Senator Hum
phrey’s own admission, a mini
mum of 14 and possibly as many
as 24 members of the Adoula
Cabinet were loyal followers of
the communist Gi/.enga. And by
Humphrey’s own admission, 45 of
the 115 seats of the Chamber of
Deputies were held by Gizenga’s
followers, with similar strength
in the Senate. (“Congressional
Record.” Sept. 21, 1961. p. 20609.)
Though Adoula’s cabinet has
since shrunk to 28 members. Gi
zenga’s strength has increased,
rather than abated.

TSHOMBE’S reluctance to
place his well governed, pro-
Western province under such
domination is understandable. At
tempting to halt communist influ
ence by turning Katanga’s wealth
over to such a bastion of Gizen
gists seems predicated upon the
supposition that the surest means
of preventing murder is suicide,
(Tomorrow, I will deal with
arguments that Katanganess rev
enue is necessary to prevent a
communist take-over of the Cen
tral Government.)
