### DOUG SCHWAB 
The Stanford Frosh captured
both ends of a weekend double
bill by defeating Menlo College,
70-45 Friday night, and Sacra
mento City College Saturday
night, 68-42. The Tribe boasted
a balanced offense both night
with three men in double figures
in each outing.

Against Menlo, Stanford hit a
fine 47.5 per cent from the floor,
while their tough defense held
their opponents to a very poor
28.1. Leading 39-21 at intermis
sion, Stanford eased up a bit in
the second half, and as a result,

Menlo was getting several open
shots. But they were unable to
connect, and Stanford’s superior
rebounding, led by All-American
prep star Ray Kosanke. kept the
Tribe well ahead.

Big attraction of the game was
Kosanke’s appearance, his first
of the season, because of illness.
Playing only a small part of the
contest, he scored eight points in
addition to leading the rebound
ing with nine.

Bob Bedell, Skip Hutchison,
and Jim Pandell were, as usual,
standouts for the Frosh, Pandell
leading the Tribe attack with 15
pinots. Bedell and Hutchison had
14 and 12 respectively.
Saturday night the Frosh prac
tically scored at will against a
very weak team from Sacramen
to City College. Maintaining their
hot shooting from the floor, Stan
ford hit 43.4 per cent, compared
to a pathetic 21.4 for Sacramento.
Tribe offense was again led by
Bedell and Hutchison, and by re
serve center Rich Baker who
broke into double figures with
ten points. Stanford height
showed to real advantage as they

captured 59 rebounds, 16 more
than Sacramento.
The Tribe offense, while dead
ly.. on shooting, was sloppy on
ball control both nights, commit
ting 12 errors Friday and 17 Sat
urday. Their free throw percent
age, 50 per cent and 56 per cent,
leaves a lot to be desired. Fortu-'
nately for the Frosh, their mar
gins of victory were so great both
nights that neither of these weak l
nesses showed appreciably.
Kosanke shows great potential,
and is already one of the best
team players on the squad.
The J.V. team split their week
end games, beating Mather Field
7938 Friday, and losing to the
Presidio 61-53 Saturday. Stand
outs the first game were Bob
Evans with 22 points, and Rod
Young with 16. Young led the at
task Saturday with 20 points.

Stanford’s Kughy and
Wrestling squads were active
over tile weekend, the rug
gers defeating Olympic Club
of Sun Francisco 23-11, and
the grapplers losing to Cal
Holy of San l.uis Obispo 88-3.

Young with 16. Young led the at
task Saturday with 20 points.

Stanford’s Kughy and
Wrestling squads were active
over tile weekend, the rug
gers defeating Olympic Club
of Sun Francisco 23-11, and
the grapplers losing to Cal
Holy of San l.uis Obispo 88-3.
The Stanford Frosh captured
both ends of a weekend double
bill by defeating Menlo College,
70-45 Friday night, and Sacra
mento City College Saturday
night, 68-42. The Tribe boasted
a balanced offense both night
with three men in double figures
in each outing.

Against Menlo, Stanford hit a
fine 47.5 per cent from the floor,
while their tough defense held
their opponents to a very poor
28.1. Leading 39-21 at intermis
sion, Stanford eased up a bit in
the second half, and as a result,

Menlo was getting several open
shots. But they were unable to
connect, and Stanford’s superior
rebounding, led by All-American
prep star Ray Kosanke. kept the
Tribe well ahead.

Big attraction of the game was
Kosanke’s appearance, his first
of the season, because of illness.
Playing only a small part of the
contest, he scored eight points in
addition to leading the rebound
ing with nine.

Bob Bedell, Skip Hutchison,
and Jim Pandell were, as usual,
standouts for the Frosh, Pandell
leading the Tribe attack with 15
pinots. Bedell and Hutchison had
14 and 12 respectively.
Saturday night the Frosh prac
tically scored at will against a
very weak team from Sacramen
to City College. Maintaining their
hot shooting from the floor, Stan
ford hit 43.4 per cent, compared
to a pathetic 21.4 for Sacramento.
Tribe offense was again led by
Bedell and Hutchison, and by re
serve center Rich Baker who
broke into double figures with
ten points. Stanford height
showed to real advantage as they

captured 59 rebounds, 16 more
than Sacramento.
The Tribe offense, while dead
ly.. on shooting, was sloppy on
ball control both nights, commit
ting 12 errors Friday and 17 Sat
urday. Their free throw percent
age, 50 per cent and 56 per cent,
leaves a lot to be desired. Fortu-'
nately for the Frosh, their mar
gins of victory were so great both
nights that neither of these weak l
nesses showed appreciably.
Kosanke shows great potential,
and is already one of the best
team players on the squad.
The J.V. team split their week
end games, beating Mather Field
7938 Friday, and losing to the
Presidio 61-53 Saturday. Stand
