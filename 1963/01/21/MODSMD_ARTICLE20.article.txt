# Sad Huskies
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
The Washington Huskies were
a frustrated group of basketball
players Saturday night after their
second straight nine-point loss to
Stanford.
Center Dale Easley summed up
their feeling: “We .just had a
. lousy series; we couldn’t hit our
shots and we couldn’t set up any
thing and all those turnovers!”
(Washington made 40 turnovers
or ball control errors.)
Even in losing, the Huskies’
defense was strong. They sagged
in toward the middle to keep the
hall away from Dose, and thus
forced the other Indians to shoot
from outside.
Washington had particular suc
cess with a zone defense which
they used for about ten minutes
Friday night. However, with the
score 15-5 they switched to a man
toman defense for two reasons,
according to Coach John Gray
son: “They (Stanford) were get
ting the hall in to Dose too much
(Dose had four baskets at that
point), and we wanted to keep
our boys running around more,
hoping they might pick up on of
fense then.”
