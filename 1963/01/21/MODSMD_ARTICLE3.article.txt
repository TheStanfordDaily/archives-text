# Lectures, Films Offered Today
## 
### 
A speech on the Nobel Prize
ceremony of 1961, two films on
Berlin, and a lecture on the prob
able climate of the Bay area
about a million years ago will be
given on campus today.
ROBERT HOFSTADTER, win
ner of tile 1961 Nobel Prize in
physics, will lecture on “The No
bel Prize Ceremony’’ at the after
noon Coffee Hour today at 4:30
p.m. in Room 270 of Tresiddcr.
Hofstadter, professor of physics
at Stanford, received the prize
for determining the shape and
size of the atomic nucleus.
RENATA KIEFER, the ASSU
German scholar, will show two
films this evening at 8:15 p.m. in
the I-Centor lounge: “Between
Bonn and Berlin," a color film;
and a documentary on Berlin:
“Frontier to Freedom.’’
Tomorrow afternoon at 4:15
p.m. in Room 270 of Tresidder, a
documentary on Berlin entitled
“Wall of Shame” will be shown,
in conjunction with the visit of
20 West Berlin lawyers to the
Stanford campus. This film was
originally made for the West
Berlin Senate and has been
shown in Washington, D.C.
UNEXPECTED NEW evidence
concerning the climate of San
Francisco’s Bay Area a million or
so years ago will be discussed to
day by Prof. Daniel I. Axelrod,
UCLA geologist, at 4 p.m. in
Room 320, Geology Building.

Axelrod will talk about micro
scopic fossil plants and pollens he
has found in (ho “Merced Forma
tion,” a sedimentary sandstone
stratum Just south of San Fran
cisco that was laid down in the
late Ice Age.

He has discovered seven dis
tinct zones of vegetation, each re
flecting climate changes in the
area. Some findings were surpris
ing, according to colleagues, and
may lead to changes in currently
accepted notions of what the Bay
Area’s prehistoric weather was
like.

Colleagues also remarked on
the fact that Prof. Axelrod could
learn so much by "indirect” fos
sil studies in a region where so
little direct evidence of the great
glaciers remains.

the I-Centor lounge: “Between
Bonn and Berlin," a color film;
and a documentary on Berlin:
“Frontier to Freedom.’’
Tomorrow afternoon at 4:15
p.m. in Room 270 of Tresidder, a
documentary on Berlin entitled
“Wall of Shame” will be shown,
in conjunction with the visit of
20 West Berlin lawyers to the
Stanford campus. This film was
originally made for the West
Berlin Senate and has been
shown in Washington, D.C.
UNEXPECTED NEW evidence
concerning the climate of San
Francisco’s Bay Area a million or
so years ago will be discussed to
day by Prof. Daniel I. Axelrod,
UCLA geologist, at 4 p.m. in
Room 320, Geology Building.

Axelrod will talk about micro
scopic fossil plants and pollens he
has found in (ho “Merced Forma
tion,” a sedimentary sandstone
stratum Just south of San Fran
cisco that was laid down in the
late Ice Age.

He has discovered seven dis
tinct zones of vegetation, each re
flecting climate changes in the
area. Some findings were surpris
ing, according to colleagues, and
may lead to changes in currently
accepted notions of what the Bay
Area’s prehistoric weather was
like.

Colleagues also remarked on
the fact that Prof. Axelrod could
learn so much by "indirect” fos
sil studies in a region where so
little direct evidence of the great
glaciers remains.
A speech on the Nobel Prize
ceremony of 1961, two films on
Berlin, and a lecture on the prob
able climate of the Bay area
about a million years ago will be
given on campus today.
ROBERT HOFSTADTER, win
ner of tile 1961 Nobel Prize in
