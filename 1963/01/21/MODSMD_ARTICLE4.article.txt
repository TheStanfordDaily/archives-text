# S.F. State Will Join USNSA
## 
### 
The feuding legislative and ex
ecutive branches of the San Fran
cisco State student government
decided by a 15-1 vote to join the
United States National Student
Association last week.

After a 9-8 split in a roll call
vote the bill had been sent to the
Welfare. Rules, and Finance Com
mittees for further study and was
then subjected to active discus
sion. Jay Folberg, president of
the Associated Students at SF
State, who was in favor of having
hit student body join the national
organization was opposed by his
vice-president Sheldon Bacchus
who felt that the NSA would
prove to be only one more organi
zation to join.
This decisive 15-1 vote now
places SF State among the one
year trial members who are
working out their relationship
with NSA.

Other new affiliations having
joined since November are Den
nison. Xavier, and Dayton Col
leges. Referendums for the con
tinuation of membership have
been won at Michigan, Smith, and
Women’s College at North Caro
lina.

The “heart" of the NSA opera
tion and the function which John
Steinbruner, one of the original
campaigners responsible for Stan
ford’s joining this national organ
ization, considers to have been the
most advantageous for our stu
dent body, is the national con
gress which meets once a year.
Steinbruner was one of he nine
detlegates sent by Stanford to
the 12-day congress in Columbus,
Ohio, last August. Other dele
gates included the officers of the
student body, the president of
the HR, the editor of The Daily.
The Congress was attended by
1200 people, 500 of which were of
ficial delegates.
