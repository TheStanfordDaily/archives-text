“Music touches us on every
level, to the very depth of our
existence,” declared Roger Ses
sions, noted contemporary com
poser and Professor of Music at
Princeton University in his lec
ture. the first in the Third Harry
Camp Lecture Series, yesterday.
Sessions related birth as the in
itiator of the basic properties of
life, breathing and self-assertion,
to the individual’s awareness of a
musical sense. Breathing estab
lishes a rhythm based on alter
nating tension and relaxation, or
in musical terms, upbeat and
downbeat. As a fundamental and
constant human experience,
breathing is the original motiva
tion for rhythmic feeling.
THE FIRST cries issued at birth
represent a primitive form of self
expression, undifferentiated with
respect to the outside world.
Later, the individual becomes
purposive and self-assertive, rec
ognizing his need for satisfaction.
Music is created as a fulfillment
of the composer, and is its own
excuse for being. Sessions pointed
out that a composer is not hand
ing down to the listener any emo
tional message or personal feel
ings; instead the listener’s con
templation of the music consti
tutes an experience in itself. In
this, the composition of music is
more dignified than mere self-ex
pression for “it does not merely
express, it IS.’
An understanding of music is,
therefore, not gained through an
attempt to recapture the mean
ing or personal motivations of
the composer, but rather through
frequent exposure, careful listen
ing, evaluation of the musical im
pressions, and an absorption and
recreation of the musical experi
ence by the listener’s imagina
tion.

DISCUSSING the role of the
individual in musical composition,
Sessions denounced adherence to
a rigid criterion based on tangible
and scientifically measurable reg
ulations. “This is definitely not
to say that there should be no cri
terion at all, for it is vastly im
portant to the artist, but that it
must be based on human experi
ences, values, and feelings . .. Mu
sic falls into the same category
as the excellence of wine, the
beauty of women, and the happi
ness of human beings. Who can
state definitively of what these
things consist?”
During his one-week stay on
the campus, Sessions will give
two other free lectures on music
and its relationship to man, and
the university’s Music Depart
ment will present a concert in his
honor Friday evening. All these
appearances will be in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. Sessions’ sec
ond address, “Music and Society,”
is a Tuesday Evening Series pre
sentation at 7:45 p.m.
