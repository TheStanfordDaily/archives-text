Result: New family of lightweight powerplants... including a new
V-8 that weighs 110 pounds less than the comparable V-8 it replaces
In our search to provide good performance with lighter
powerplants, Ford Motor Company engineers and
foundrymen have pioneered new techniques that now
let us cast our engine blocks with such precision that
much lighter engines are made possible.
New materials used to make cores and molds and new
casting methods enable us to make engine parts with
walls as thick as necessary—but no thicker. This
eliminates weight of extra material which must be used
to provide adequate strength with less precise casting
methods.
Reducing engine weight through precision casting
means more performance per pound—and since
lighter engines mean overall car weight cart 1)0
reduced, better fuel economy results.
Another assignment completed—another Ford First—l
and one more example of how Ford Motor Company
continues to provide engineering leadership for the
American Road.
