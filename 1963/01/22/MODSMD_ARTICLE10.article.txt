# Ralston Discusses Plans, Aims For Future of Football on Farm
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
John Ralston is going to be the boss of football at Stanford.
Any disbeliever of this fundamental truth could not have been
present at Ralston’s initial Stanford press conference held yester
day at Rickey’s. The Cal linebacker turned Stanford coach left no
doubt that he would have final say on everything to do with Stan

ford football over the next three
years.
KAI,STON SAID he would take
immediate charge of recruiting
new players, and would also be
responsible for both the offense
and defense. That he is capable of
doing all this work cannot bo
doubted. About 80 per cent of his
last Utah State football team
came from California, an impres
sive recruiting figure that most
major California schools cannot
match. At Utah Slate ho coached
national champions in both rush
ing and rushing defense.
He is known as a football fun
damentalist, and at the press con
ference noted that he was more
interested in blocking and tackl
ing than any other phase of the

game, because “that wins football
games.” However he didn't leave
out the possibility that Stanford
might do plenty of passing.
“We’ve got nothing against pass
ing. You’ve got to have both run
ning and passing to win football
games.”
AT UTAH STATE, Ralston
used the rotation of football pla
toons made famous by Paul Diet
/.el. That is, he selected three
teams, one the "Blue” for both
offense and defense, another the
“Go” strictly for offense, and fi
nally the “Stop” for defense.
Ralston said yesterday, though,
that he would like to develop four
units since he is at a major insti
tution where more material is
available. The four units would bo
split evenly between offense and
defense.
As far as past football per
formances are concerned, Ralston
said that the slate would he clean.
“I’ve got to be shown.” The show
ing will start during spring prac
tice, which will bo devoted to
teaching Ralston’s now offensive
and defensive systems. Condition
ing won’t be a major factor at
that time.
THE SYSTEMS aren't anything
radical, hut will be somewhat dif
ferent than those seen recently
on the Farm. Offensively, the
Tribe will use a tight “T” forma
tion with halfback or end flanked
on nearly all plays. The “Eagle”
defense, an arrangement that
gained Ralston wide renown
among football coaches, consists
of a non-shifting five-man line,
throe linebackers, one a rover
around the middle of the line,
and three defensive backs.
Another development released
at the conference was the an
nouncement that assistant coach
Leon McLaughlin, who had been

prominently mentioned as a head
coaching possibility, would be re
tained as a line coach. The Stan
ford players had hoped McLaugh
lin would be back.

RALSTON SAID ho would sock
McLaughlin’s advice about cer
tain matters, but that his own
decisions would be final. He said
he had pared the list of other as
sistant coach candidates from 70
to 10 or 12, including one man
from Utah State (not Tony Napp,
who is expected to become head
coach there) and several from
Stanford. Ralston said he would
name a frosh coach and three
other assistants.

A sportswriter asked Ralston
why he left Utah State, where he
had security, and came to Stan
ford. The reply was "a guy
doesn’t know when he’s well off.”
Moments later, though, a serious
Ralston said, ‘‘Stanford strives
for the best in all fields of en
deavor. As it is in academics, it
should also be in athletics.”

Ralston announced last
night in a meeting with foot
ball players that he has offer
ed Frank Williams a post as
assistant coach. Williams was
assistant football coach under
Ralston at Utah State.
