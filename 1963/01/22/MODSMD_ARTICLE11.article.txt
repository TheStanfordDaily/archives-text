# ICC Recommends Alteration of Rush
## 
### 
In a meeting last night the ICC
asked President Frank Wallace
to draw r up a proposal which
would amend the rushing pro
posal on two points as yet unac
ceptable to the eating clubs.
The first of the amendments
would stipulate that the living
groups may conduct open contact
spring quarter at meals with the
following stipulations: that there
be no more than five rushees per
meal per club, and that additional
restrictions may be imposed by
the ICC or the IFC on their own
groups.
The second amendment pro
vides for open contact with fresh
men off-campus during winter
quarter after the formal an
nouncement of open houses.
Wallace and vice-president Ed
ward Laroe plan to write a letter
shortly incorporating the two pro
posals brought up and accepted
last night.
However, informed sources in
dicate that a decision from the
administration is likely to be
forthcoming before Thursday.
