(Editor’s note: The following

present serving with the Peace
Corps in an urban development
project in one of the “harriadas”
(slums) in Lima.)

"The revolution may not come
next year or the year after, but
it will come.” This statement was
not made by a communist party
member but a Catholic priest
working in the “barriadas" of
Lima. Padre Jorge Calderon made
those remarks in the course of a
discussion with members of the
Peace Corps working in the “bar
riacla” San Martin de Porres.

Padre Jorge's depressing views
of the future of Peru find much
support among informed observ
ers of Peru. Most Peruvians I
have talked to seem to share his
belief that the revolution is on
its way. Even some members of
the American Embassy staff find
little in the future of Peru to be
hopeful about. As one official put
it, “if we work hard for six
months we may have a year, if
we work hard for a year we may
have two and so on.”
PERU is one of the few South
American countries which has
not had a strong social reform
party in power since the war.
Still about 5 per cent of the popu
lation control about 94 per cent
of the land. Less than half of the
population are literate in Spanish.
Industrialization is spotty but
progressing. On this weak base,
Peru is experiencing an enormous
population migration to the ur
ban centers from the Andes.
These poor illiterate and landless
people are forming a noose of dis
content around the cities which
may be pulled tight at any time.

Last June, Peru underwent its
second free election since the mili
tary dictatorship of Manuel
Odria. The moderate but one-time
Marxist, APRA Party of Haya de
la Torre was denied its rightful
position of influence in any new
government by a military junta.
The military, with a long stand
ing feud with APRA Party, claim
ed the elections were rigged. Un
til the most recent crisis, the
Junta, to its credit, maintained
civil liberties and is now calling
for an election in June of this
year. It is speculated that the
Junta will not be willing to re
linquish its power to the APRA
Party or any other party of a
leftist orientation which it con
siders dangerous to its position.
As Padre Jorge noted, the elec
tion will probably produce a com
promise candidate but he will be
the last President.
Even since I have been in Peru
(since Nov. 1962) the political sit
uation has been deteriorating.
Just a few miles from where I
live, a group of seventy families
staged a raid on private land in
an attempt to set up a squatter

slum settlement. Government po
lice were called in to expel the
families and in the ensuing vio
lence one man was killed and
forty wounded. When law and or
der begin to stand in the way of
the only manner a man can find
a plot of land for his home, it will
certainly render it a less desirable
social goal in the eyes of the
people.
THE SITUATION is becoming
so tense that Insignificant inci
dents may result in violence as
was the case last month in La
Oroya, where the American Cer
ro de Pasco mining company was
involved in a bloody strike. The
Cerro de Pasco Company shares
a somewhat similar popularity in
Peru as does the United Fruit
Company in Central America. An
otherwise innocent strike of some
fifty men resulted in mob vio
lence and a state of anarchy
which lasted for 24 hours. In the
process, many men were wounded
and one of the main company
buildings was burned to the
ground.
In the Andean Department of
Cuzco, groups of Indians are
staging raids and taking over the
large haciendas. Up to now the
government has been able to do
little to stop this do-it-yourself
agrarian reform movement. Part
of these raids have been under
the direction of the communist in
fluenced guerrilla leader, Hugo
Blanco. Blanco’s influence is so
great in Cuzco that he is reported
to have been able to walk the
streets unmolested in Peru’s third
largest city—a feat Fidel Castro
could not equal.
IN PADRE Jorge’s opinion,
there appears to be no real alter
native to the communist move
ment in Peru. The APRA Party
once used to hold this position
but since its coalition with the
last government of Manuel Pra
do, it became more moderate and
has lost much of its following. In
the organizations where the
APRA and communists have tra
ditionally vied for power, the
Apristas are slowly losing out.
The University of San Marcos’
student government is now com
munist controlled. The textile
union, once the favorite of the
APRA Party, has just recently
fallen under communist control.

When questioned about what
the official Church organization
was doing to provide an alterna
tive to communism in this Cath
olic country, Padre Jorge said
simply, “nothing.” The Church in
Peru, like much of Latin Ameri
ca is in the difficult position of
being supported financially by
the small wealthy class. Many of
the Church officials are of a con
servative background and do not
favor radical reform. Padre Jorge
believes the Church has lost con
tact with the masses of Peru and
the only hope of the Church is to
re-establish this contact. “If the

revolution comes, the Church will
be destroyed in Peru as it has
been in Cuba.” Padre Jorge gives
testament to his ideas in his ac
tion. A member of the wealthy
class by birth, he became a priest
and works and lives in the worst
of Lima’s slums. He refuses run
ning water in his house because
his neighbors do not have it. But
there are not enough priests in
Peru like Padre Jorge.
AGAINST this pessimistic pic
ture of present-day Peru, the peo
litical events seemed to have
reached a crisis point in the last
few days. The government claims
to have discovered a vast com
munist plot to take control of the
country. The Military Junta sus
pended all constitutional guaran
tees and rounded up all commu
nists and "violent” elements. But
this effort only seems to reflect
the desperation of the govern
ment and its forces. There seems
to be little that can be done be
cause the people with the power
to help are blind. There is enough
money among the upper-class of
Peru to solve many of the coun
try’s problems. Few of the
wealthy are able to see the on
coming revolution or else believe
they can ride it out with such
stop-gap measures as were used
in the last few days. There seems
to be little to do but wait and
hope that the Alliance for Prog
ress, in Peru’s case, is not too
little too late.
