# ASSU SCHOLAR
## Japanese Economy Combines Governmental, Private Control

The choice between capitalism
and communism is the most con
troversial point in the present
world. And each country is likely
to be forced to choose one of these
two systems. In the U.S., I think,
Americans are so much afraid of
communism that they become as
tounded and look like they have
seen nightmares when they hear
the word “Communism.” And
they finally deny everything
which is concerned about com
munism without giving any con
sideration to it.
Let’s describe the communistic
society as the society where
everything is decided by the gov
ernment instead of by the mar
ket. I think it is desirable that
the following things should be
run by government from the view
point of the benefit of the nation.
I. The adjustment of the dis
tribution of income; this can be
done only by government. In the
market there is no force nor in
citement to adjust the disparity.
The reason why government
should redistribute some part of
the income from the wealthy to
the poor is from the humanitari
an viewpoint that every human
being has his own value and dig
nity. However, this adjustment"
should be kept in balance at the
point where it does not impair the
individual ambition to raise his’
own living standard and individu
al human dignity. This idea is ac
tually carried out through the
government’s increasing the tax
rate.

11. Defense, health and educa
tion service. One may any time
become ill. In order that people
can work and enjoy daily life free
from anxiety, government should
give health service at lower price
or for nothing. In Japan all peo
ple are required to buy national
health insurance run by the gov
ernment. Then if they get ill, 50
per cent of their bills are paid by
the government. The reason why

aid to education in schools
should bo paid by government is
from the supposition that,we can
attain a much better society
when each component in the soci
ety is equally educated at the ele
mentary level than when each
member is quite unequally edu
cated with the existence of ig
norant people.
111. Public goods. Here I call
public goods such things as roads,
ports, parks, and so forth, where
people can share the utility with
each other. These things cannot
be constructed by an individual
but only by the group of individ
uals in a society.
IV. The goods where decreas
ing return to scale is conspicuous,
such as railroad, telephone,
water, power services, and so
forth. That means they need a
tremendously huge amount of
money to build and reach the
point they can get profit for the
first time.

These things cannot be easily
constructed by an individual but
once these things are constructed,
it is very probable that they will
charge high rates and enjoy an
unfair monopolistic advantage
because it is so difficult for com
petitors to enter into these fields.
In Japan just like these other
things mentioned above, salt and
cigarettes are run by the govern
ment.

There are two extreme soci
eties, one where everything is run
by government and the other
where everything is decided by
market forces. If we imagine a
graded straight line measuring
the degree of government inter
vention in the economy, all
countries in the world drop
somewhere between the two ex
tremes so far as their economics
system is concerned. I think every
country has the right of choosing
any point on the line. In Japan
since we think the system of a
mixed economy is more efficient
to develop our economy, we are
using such a system. In Soviet
Russia since they believe that the
system with everything decided
by government is more efficient,
she is choosing that system.

everything is decided by the gov
ernment instead of by the mar
ket. I think it is desirable that
the following things should be
run by government from the view
point of the benefit of the nation.
I. The adjustment of the dis
tribution of income; this can be
done only by government. In the
market there is no force nor in
citement to adjust the disparity.
The reason why government
should redistribute some part of
the income from the wealthy to
the poor is from the humanitari
an viewpoint that every human
being has his own value and dig
nity. However, this adjustment"
should be kept in balance at the
point where it does not impair the
individual ambition to raise his’
own living standard and individu
al human dignity. This idea is ac
tually carried out through the
government’s increasing the tax
rate.

11. Defense, health and educa
tion service. One may any time
become ill. In order that people
can work and enjoy daily life free
from anxiety, government should
give health service at lower price
or for nothing. In Japan all peo
ple are required to buy national
health insurance run by the gov
ernment. Then if they get ill, 50
per cent of their bills are paid by
the government. The reason why

aid to education in schools
should bo paid by government is
from the supposition that,we can
attain a much better society
when each component in the soci
ety is equally educated at the ele
mentary level than when each
member is quite unequally edu
cated with the existence of ig
norant people.
111. Public goods. Here I call
public goods such things as roads,
ports, parks, and so forth, where
people can share the utility with
each other. These things cannot
be constructed by an individual
but only by the group of individ
uals in a society.
IV. The goods where decreas
ing return to scale is conspicuous,
such as railroad, telephone,
water, power services, and so
forth. That means they need a
tremendously huge amount of
money to build and reach the
point they can get profit for the
first time.

These things cannot be easily
constructed by an individual but
once these things are constructed,
it is very probable that they will
charge high rates and enjoy an
unfair monopolistic advantage
because it is so difficult for com
petitors to enter into these fields.
In Japan just like these other
things mentioned above, salt and
cigarettes are run by the govern
ment.

There are two extreme soci
eties, one where everything is run
by government and the other
where everything is decided by
market forces. If we imagine a
graded straight line measuring
the degree of government inter
vention in the economy, all
countries in the world drop
somewhere between the two ex
tremes so far as their economics
system is concerned. I think every
country has the right of choosing
any point on the line. In Japan
since we think the system of a
mixed economy is more efficient
to develop our economy, we are
using such a system. In Soviet
Russia since they believe that the
system with everything decided
by government is more efficient,
she is choosing that system.

versity in Tokyo. He is majoring

The choice between capitalism
and communism is the most con
troversial point in the present
world. And each country is likely
to be forced to choose one of these
two systems. In the U.S., I think,
Americans are so much afraid of
communism that they become as
tounded and look like they have
seen nightmares when they hear
the word “Communism.” And
they finally deny everything
which is concerned about com
munism without giving any con
sideration to it.

al human dignity. This idea is ac
tually carried out through the
government’s increasing the tax
rate.

11. Defense, health and educa
tion service. One may any time
become ill. In order that people
can work and enjoy daily life free
from anxiety, government should
give health service at lower price
or for nothing. In Japan all peo
ple are required to buy national
health insurance run by the gov
ernment. Then if they get ill, 50
per cent of their bills are paid by
the government. The reason why

aid to education in schools
should bo paid by government is
from the supposition that,we can
attain a much better society
when each component in the soci
ety is equally educated at the ele
mentary level than when each
member is quite unequally edu
cated with the existence of ig
norant people.
111. Public goods. Here I call
public goods such things as roads,
ports, parks, and so forth, where
people can share the utility with
each other. These things cannot
be constructed by an individual
but only by the group of individ
uals in a society.
IV. The goods where decreas
ing return to scale is conspicuous,
such as railroad, telephone,
water, power services, and so
forth. That means they need a
tremendously huge amount of
money to build and reach the
point they can get profit for the
first time.

These things cannot be easily
constructed by an individual but
once these things are constructed,
it is very probable that they will
charge high rates and enjoy an
unfair monopolistic advantage
because it is so difficult for com
petitors to enter into these fields.
In Japan just like these other
things mentioned above, salt and
cigarettes are run by the govern
ment.

There are two extreme soci
eties, one where everything is run
by government and the other
where everything is decided by
market forces. If we imagine a
graded straight line measuring
the degree of government inter
vention in the economy, all
countries in the world drop
somewhere between the two ex
tremes so far as their economics
system is concerned. I think every
country has the right of choosing
any point on the line. In Japan
since we think the system of a
mixed economy is more efficient
to develop our economy, we are
using such a system. In Soviet
Russia since they believe that the
system with everything decided
by government is more efficient,
she is choosing that system.
