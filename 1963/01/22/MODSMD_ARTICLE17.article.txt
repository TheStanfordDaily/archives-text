# KATANGA SELF-CONTAINED
## Why Is JFK Unwilling to Allow Katanga Right of Self-Determination? 
### RICHARD WEINIG 
A little over one year ago, Pres
ident Kennedy assured the editor
of Izvestia that “If any nation
should choose a communist sys
tem, we would recognize and ac
cept that.” *
Such is his privilege. But if the
President truly believes that each
nation is entitled to the right of
self-determination, why has he ex
tended unqualified support to
United Nations efforts to forcibly
place Moise Tshombe’s invalua
ble, pro-Western Province under
the control of a Central Congo
lese Government in which:
THE MINISTER of the Interi
or, who controls all police, is a
communist, probaldy Prague
trained, and loyal to Gizenga;
The Minister of Justice, who
controls the courts, is a commu
nist;
The man second in command
of the Congolese Army is an ar
dent Gizengist;
FOLLOWERS of the commu
nist, Gizenga, control nearly 40

per cent of (he seats of the Ado
ula cabinet and of both houses of
Parliament.
In a word, why is the President
unwilling to extend to the friend
ly, anti-communist nation of Ka
tanga the same right—the right
of self-determination which he
so magnanimously bestows upon
the enemies of the United States?
As I noted yesterday, such ac
tion cannot be justified by argu
ments that Katanga has no legiti
mate claim to the right of self
determination because it lacks
sufficient geographic size, cultur
al unity, economic stability, or
competent leadership to be con
sidered an independent African
state. Such charges arc manifest
ly untrue.
THEREFORE, if U Thant’s Ka
tanganese war is to be justified,
one must demonstrate that Ka
tanganese revenue is necessary to
prevent collapse of the Central
Government and its replacement
by a regime even more thorough
ly riddled with communists than
is the present one. And, Walter
Lippmann’s remarks to the con
trary notwithstanding, this may
prove to be rather difficult.
If, —in Mr. Lippmann’s words—
"without the revenues from Ka
tanga, the rest of the Congo is
doomed to misery and backward
ness,’’ its plight stems less from
lack of potential non-Katangane.se
revenue than from indefensible
incompetence and corruption in
Leopoldville. This becomes readi
ly apparent if one bothers to ex
amine the amount and purpose
of Central Governmental expend
itures and the economic potential
of the non-Katanganese Congo.
During the first six months of
1961, the Central Government and
the five provinces over which it
presumably rules had a combined
income of 36 million dollars and
together expended 108 million dol
lars. This, of course, entailed a
total deficit of 72 million dollars.
During the same period of time,
the Katanga Province compiled a
balanced budget of 42 million dol
lars.
OF COURSE, in reducing its
deficit, the Central Government
could not deprive Katanga of her
entire source of income. Under
Belgian rule, half of Katanga’s
taxes to the Central Government
were returned to her. Now, "if
this proportion were halved
again,—and Katanga could not
possibly be administered for any
thing less than this— Elisabeth
ville’s subsidy to the Central Gov
ernment and the other five prov
inces over the 6-month period in
question would amount to only
31.5 million dollars.” This would
still leave the Central Govern
ment with a combined deficit of
40.5 million dollars. In short, Ka
tanga would be impoverished and
the rest of the Congo, like Pha

raoh’s cattle, would not be sig
nificantly fattened. (Smith Hemp
stone. “Congressional Record.”
Oct. 12, 1962. p. 22058.)
Obviously, the Central Govern
ment’s principal difficulties will
not be rectified by an influx of
Katanganese revenue.
Eighty per cent of Leopold
ville's resources are consumed by
the highest paid army in the
world. 25,000 soldiers most of
whom have manifest less ability
for maintaining order than for
drunken hell-raising—receive a
salary of 180 dollars a month,
twice that of an American GI.
(Sen. Thomas J. Dodd. “Congres
sional Record.” Aug. 3. 1962, p,
14538. )
THE REST of the budget seems
to be absorbed by the Congolese
counterparts of "Kingfish” Huey
Long; politicians who, though
teachers had not been paid for 15
months, voted to increase their
own salaries from 2,000 to 12,000
dollars a year; charlatans about
whom Adoula spoke with these
words to his Parliament: “Every
one of you wanted to become a
minister. To satisfy these ambi
tions, we have been forced to con
stitute a government of dishonest
and incapable persons chosen by
you or by every political party.”
(“New York Times.” June 14,
1962.»
If Adoula and the United Na
tions were to expend less effort
attempting to force their corrupt
rule upon Tshombe and would de
vote more time to restoring order
in the rest of the Congo and
cleaning house in Leopoldville,
the Central Government could
adequately maintain itself with
out filching Katanganese reve
nue.
Even without Katanga, the Con
go is still the largest nation in
Africa. Compared with most
other African states, it abounds
in natural wealth, containing
rich diamond workings; sizable
gold and tin mines; tremendous
hydroelectric potential at the
mouth of the Congo; a well de
veloped agricultural base with
such export crops as coffee and
cotton; and an unexcelled system
of natural communications in the
Congo River and its tributaries.
(“Congressional Record.” Jan. 25,
1962. p. 767.)
OF COURSE, under the Bel
gians, the rest of the Congo was
quite content to do little more
than subsist on Katanganese sub
sidies. And, unfortunately, prov
inces which prey together for a
prolonged period of time tend to
avoid productive labor of their
own at any cost. Therefore, in
stead of bothering to collect equit
able taxes on present enterprises
and maintain the order necessary
for future ventures, the Central
Government has done little more
than condone chaos in its own
provinces and cast covetous eyes
toward Katanga.
To cite but a single example,
one should examine Adoula’s
treatment of the rich diamond
workings in south Kasai. United
Nations officials have estimated
that in 1961, smugglers were al
lowed to remove 36.5 million dol
lars worth of diamonds from the
province, while the Government
feebly collected (axes on transac
tions amounting to a mere 814,000
dollars. This is by no means an
isolated instance of incompetence,
reduction of which could easily
restore solvency to Leopoldville.
(“Congressional Record.” Aug. 3,
1962, p. 14538.)
Subjugation of Katanga will
not only fail to substantially alle
viate Adoula’s financial difficul
ties. It will, in all pr obability, ir
revocably damage the Katangan
ese economy by prompting an al
most universal exodus of whites
from the area. To paraphrase
Smith Hempstone, the United
States and United Nations may
be able to forget the barbaric
Kindu and Kongolo massacres
committed by Central Govern
ment troops. “But Katanga’s
whites, reduced in number from
35,000 to about 8,000 by the UN’s
policies have not forgotten. They
are the ones who would have to
live under the unstable conditions
created by the UN. The vast ma
jority of them would leave if
Central Government troops were
brought in.” Without white tech
nological and managerial skill,
even Katanga’s economy would
quickly grind to a standstill.
(“Congressional Record.” Oct. 12,
1962. p. 22058.)
OBVIOUSLY, the economic
health of the Congo is less de
pendent upon participation by Ka
tanga than upon establishment of
order and productivity in the
other five provinces and some
manifestation of fiscal responsi
bility on the part of the Central
Government.

Therefore, present action
against Tshombe reminds one of
a fable dealing with golden eggs
and the premature slaughter of
geese. Apparently, Cyrille Adoula,
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and U
Thant think that such parables
are a bit too old-fashioned to con
sider these days.

(Tomorrow, I will deal with
probable consequences of present
|K>licies; and will suggest means
by which the West may extricate
itself from the problematic quag
mire into which it has fallen.)
