# Ruggers Beat Olympic Club in Opener
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
Stanford’s varsity ruggers open
ed their season Saturday in con
vincing fashion, downing Olympic
Club of San Francisco 23-11 on
the Stanford field.
The Olympic Club squad, sport
ing plenty of experience, led 11-10
with fifteen minutes remaining in
the second 40-minute half. Stan

ford’s younger and apparently
hotter conditioned club then reel
ed off three consecutive three
point trys for the win. Braden
Beck added two-point conversion
kicks on the last two for the final
margin.
THE OLYMPIANS had drawn
first blood on a three-point pen

alty kick. Then Gordon Waddell,
a Stanford grad student from
Scotland and currently one of the
best rugby backs on the West
Coast, broke to his left, forced an
Olympic defender to commit him
self, and then passed beautifully
to Steve Pursell, who went
straight in to tie the score. Beck
provided the go-ahead points with
a conversion and Stanford led 3-3.
From then until nearly halftime,
the game was fast moving but
scoreless, each side missing two
penalty attempts.
With three minutes to go in the
first period, Pursell scored again,
this time on a fine broken field
run (There is no blocking of po
tential tacklers allowed in Rug
by), Beck once more converted,
and the Cards carried a 10-3 ad
vantage off the field at the half.
THE EXPERIENCE of the old
er Olympic Clubbers began to
show in the early minutes of the
second half. A long, booming pen
alty kick put them within strik
ing distance. A long pass over a
lineout to a hack breaking toward
the center of the field caught the
Indians by surprise, the play go
ing some forty yards for a try.
The conversion put Olympic Club
ahead 11-10.

Once again the game settled
down; plenty of action, but no
scoring. Beck had one chance to
give the Indians the lead on a
penalty kick, but missed by
inches to the right.
Clark Weaver finally put the
Indians ahead to stay, showing
good power as he muscled over
to score from ten yards out. The
Olympic Club forwards began to
tire, and Stanford began to con
trol (he ball from lineouts, which
they had been unable to do be
fore. Dick Leeuwenburg, who
played well in the second row all
during the game, was invaluable
during this phase, powering for
control on the lineouts, and actu
ally scoring himself from a play
which began on a lineout.

WADDELL SCORED a well
earned try in the final minutes,
set up by a good pass from Frank
Patitucci. Beck converted as he
already had on Leeuwenburg’s
score for the final points.
One of the key plays of the
game, a good save by Beau Bi
anchi, staved off an Olympic Club
rally when the score was still
only 13-11 in Stanford’s favor. A
long Olympic kick sent Bianchi,
the last Stanford defender, far
back toward the Card goal. Bian
chi retrieved the ball and got off
a solid boot just over the heads
of a covei'ing mass of Olympic
Club tacklers. From midfield, the
Cards were then able to move al
most at will over their tiring op
ponents.

Once again the game settled
down; plenty of action, but no
scoring. Beck had one chance to
give the Indians the lead on a
penalty kick, but missed by
inches to the right.
Clark Weaver finally put the
Indians ahead to stay, showing
good power as he muscled over
to score from ten yards out. The
Olympic Club forwards began to
tire, and Stanford began to con
trol (he ball from lineouts, which
they had been unable to do be
fore. Dick Leeuwenburg, who
played well in the second row all
during the game, was invaluable
during this phase, powering for
control on the lineouts, and actu
ally scoring himself from a play
which began on a lineout.

WADDELL SCORED a well
earned try in the final minutes,
set up by a good pass from Frank
Patitucci. Beck converted as he
already had on Leeuwenburg’s
score for the final points.
One of the key plays of the
game, a good save by Beau Bi
anchi, staved off an Olympic Club
rally when the score was still
only 13-11 in Stanford’s favor. A
long Olympic kick sent Bianchi,
the last Stanford defender, far
back toward the Card goal. Bian
chi retrieved the ball and got off
a solid boot just over the heads
of a covei'ing mass of Olympic
Club tacklers. From midfield, the
Cards were then able to move al
most at will over their tiring op
ponents.

THE OLYMPIANS had drawn
first blood on a three-point pen

a Stanford grad student from
Scotland and currently one of the
best rugby backs on the West
Coast, broke to his left, forced an
Olympic defender to commit him
self, and then passed beautifully
to Steve Pursell, who went
straight in to tie the score. Beck
provided the go-ahead points with
a conversion and Stanford led 3-3.
From then until nearly halftime,
the game was fast moving but
scoreless, each side missing two
penalty attempts.
With three minutes to go in the
first period, Pursell scored again,
this time on a fine broken field
run (There is no blocking of po

and the Cards carried a 10-3 ad

THE EXPERIENCE of the old
