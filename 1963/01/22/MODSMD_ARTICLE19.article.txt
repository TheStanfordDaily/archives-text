### 
New Stanford football coach
John Ralston told his players last
night that he is going to stress
individual development, with no
team workouts, in spring practice
this year.
At a meeting in Encina Gym
for all players, Ralston stated
that he wants his players to be
come skilled in fundamentals,
such as blocking and tackling,
and will postpone team practices
until next fall.
"We’re going to pick our de
fensive personnel first,” said
Ralston, ‘‘then concentrate on of
fense. If you can’t stop the other
team, you can’t win games.”
He added that he hasn’t yet de
cided how he’ll make use of the
new unlimited substitution rule.
