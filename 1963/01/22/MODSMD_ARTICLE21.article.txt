### JUSTIN BECK 
Vaughan Hitchcock, a wrestling
coach with a habit of developing
winning teams, lived up to his
reputation Saturday. His Cal
Poly (San Luis Obispo) grapplers
crushed Stanford by the lopsided
score of 31-3.
Only co-captain Phil Kendall
picked up points for the Indians,
beating his opponent 4-1, in the
157-pound class. But by that time
the outcome was certain. Cal
Poly having made a clean sweep
of the first four weight classes
for a commanding 200 lead.
The visitors didn’t waste much
time showing the Indians that
Hitchcock’s talents as a coach
border on the unbelievable. At
123, Stanford’s George Musser
was pinned in 4:51, down 10-1 on
points at that lime. Tim Davis,
the Indians’ 133-pounder, was
pinned in 1:21, and, following a
forfeit to Cal Poly at 137, Dan
Barrett was likewise pinned in
8:27 at 147 pounds.
In the heavier weight classes
the Indians’ showing was only
slightly better. Following Ken
dall’s win, Stanford’s other co
captain, Jon Kay. lost a close
match, 3-1, at 167. Rich Schaeffer
was pinned in 4:40 at 177 and in
the heavyweight match Marsh
