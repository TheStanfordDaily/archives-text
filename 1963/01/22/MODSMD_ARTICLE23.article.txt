# Stanford, UCLA Install Linear Accelerators
## 
### 
Gleaming new versions of
Stanford’s once experimental lin
ear accelerator, now a valued
tool in the treatment of many
forms of cancer, is in use at the
Stanford Medical Center and the
UCLA Medical Center.
The machines, “which have led
to real advances in the treatment
of cancer,” are the first models
produced by a Palo Alto elec
tronics firm. They are valued at
$150,000 each.
