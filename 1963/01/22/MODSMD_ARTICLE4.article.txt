# Will Union Replace Quad For Studying, Comfort, Pleasure?
## 
### CHRIS CHRISMAN 
More and more students are
discovering the convenience and
comfort of studying in Tresidder
Union’s quiet lounges and pleas
ant listening rooms, but for some
students the facilities could still
be improved upon.
It all started even before Tre
sidder was dedicated when pio
neering students slipped through
unlocked windows in quest of the
comfortable studying atmosphere
of the program lounges. Other
book bugs found repose in the yet
unfinished music listening room.
This quarter at any lime during
the day when the lounges are not
being used for meetings, one can
find several dozen students curled
up with their books on the richly
cushioned couches. Absent is the
annoying din of the library for
students can retire to the restau
rant when they want to take a
break or chat with dates and
friends.
The closeness to the Row and
the convenience of the restaurant
facilities are reducing "studying
on the quad” to secondary prefer
ence. As one co-ed put it, Tresid
der is great because you can mix
business with pleasure.
The lounges arc not without
their drawbacks, however. They
have little to offer in the way of
tables to write on. Since the small
conference rooms with their largo
conference tables have not been
opened for studying, students
needing tables have invaded the
Bridge and Chess Room driving
out the few chess players who
have wanted to use the room for
its intended purpose.
According to Robert Funk, the
union’s program coordinator, this
misuse of the Bridge and Chess
Room is one of the more serious
problems remaining to be solved.
To encourage chess players to use
the room and to break up the
st udying-monopoly, the Games
Division is organizing chess tour
naments which will begin next
month. So far nothing has been
done for students needing tables.
