# WUS Requests Funds To Build TB Hospital
## 
### 
The World University Service,
an international cooperative aid
fund, has begun its funds drive
this week. The goal of the drive
is to obtain $1 from each student.
This year’s WUS project is a
new $50,000 tuberculosis sana
torium for Japanese students in
Murayama, Japan. The patients’
sojourn there, which averages ten
months, will be financed jointly
by their families, Japan WUS,
and the National Health Insur
ance Fund.
The Japan committee has sup
plied half the building’s cost. The
remainder will come from inter
national contributions. Stanford
has been asked to contribute to
this project.
WUS attempts to fight poverty
and disease among the people of
stricken countries. One of its
projects was the establishment of
several other sanatoriums in
Japan for students in the Tokyo
area.
In the last drive, in 1961, Stan
ford students donated $2300 to
WUS for the construction of a
cooperative bookstore in Basuto
land.
