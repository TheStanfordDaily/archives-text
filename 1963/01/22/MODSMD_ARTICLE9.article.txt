# Construction Starts On New Law Wing
## 
### 
Construction is now under way
on the first, phase of the Stanford
Law School’s extension program
the remodeling of the old Law
School Annex into a new south
wing.
San Francisco contractors Wag
ner and Martinez were awarded
the $525,239 job and this week
began stripping the interior back
to the original Aimaden sand
stone walls.
The existing structure consists
of a main floor with a 16-foot
ceiling and a partial basement.
UNIVERSITY planners have
designed a now full basement,
with wider and deeper windows,
surrounded by a landscaped light
well.
By raising the tile roof eight
feet, the interior will be trans
formed into three floors, all con
necting to the main Law School
building fronting on Serra Street.
The new structure will relieve
overcrowding of the main build
ing, which has become increas
ingly severe in the last decade.
Funds for the renovation came
from the $41.5 million building
program to be financed through
PACE.
The work is expected to be
completed by Sept. 1 in time for
the fail quarter.
