This pen ran save you important money on car
tridges. Ours are BIGGER and last longer (each is
good for 8 or 9 thousand words). But, even if you
didn't save a dime, this pen would be worth the
extra price. It's a Parker.
And only Parker gives you a solid 14K gold point
lipped with plathenium—one of the hardest,
smoothest alloys ever developed. It should last
you for years no matter how much you use it.
The pen won't leak the way the cheap ones do.
It has a built-in safety reservoir, and it must meet
most of the tough specifications we set for our
$lO pens.
lf you have trouble saying it, say it with a Parker.
If you're a little shy and have difficulty saying "I
love you" or even "I like you very much"—say it
with a Parker.
The new Parker Arrow' makes a beautifully ex
pressive gift and looks as if you paid a small fortune
for it.
The new Parker Arrow comes in black, dark blue,
light blue, light gray, and bright red, with a choice
of four instantly replaceable solid 14K gold points.
Gift-boxed with five free cartridges.
