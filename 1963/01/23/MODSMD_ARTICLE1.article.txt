# KPFA's License Delay Prompts Letter to FCC
## 
### 
The case of station KPFA’s free
dom of speech has aroused the
sympathy of the Associated Stu
dents. In response to the FCC’s
postponement of the station’s li
cense renewal, student body presi
dent Armin Rosencranz has mail
ed letters expressing “grave con
cern” over the action.
Addressing the letters to FCC
Chairman Newton Minow and
Senate Internal Security subcom
mittee vice chairman Thomas
Dodd, Rosencranz pointed out the
importance of KPFA in challeng
ing and stimulating its audience
and the importance to academic
freedom of being able to “express
ideas, however unorthodox, with
out fear of reprisal.”
KPFA, a listener-sponsored FM
radio station operated by the Pa
cifica Foundation, has been under
investigation in Washington by
the FCC and the Senate sub-com
mittee for alleged Communist in
filtration. While the station sched
ules news commentaries by the
California American Communist

Party and allows people to voice
(heir opinions regardless of their
political beliefs, Pacifica's acting
president Trevor Thomas has de
nied charge of Communist control
before the subcommittee.

When KPFA’s license expired
a month ago, the FCC withheld
action on a renewal until their
investigations had been complet
ed. The station is currently op
erating on a “deferred renewal
license.’’
SENATOR 1)01)1), head of the
subcommittee, has been careful in
defining the purpose of the inves
tigation to avoid accusations of
government censorship.
