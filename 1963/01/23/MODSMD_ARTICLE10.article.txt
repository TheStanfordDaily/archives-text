### 
(ASSU President Armin Rosen
cranz gave the following state
ment after President Sterling's
Convocation address yesterday.)
The entire student body is
grateful to President Sterling for
his forthright discussion of issues
which are of prime concern to the
student community and for recog
nizing the capacity of students to
contribute to the formation of
educational policy. We particular
ly welcome the increased interest
in undergraduate education and
agree that it needs critical re
examination at Stanford.
THERE IS obviously a differ
ence of opinion on the Universi
ty’s responsibility for the non
academic lives of its students. Of
course, the President of the Uni
versity is the only one who can
represent the University’s atti
tude on this question.
The fact that some students are
disorderly in rooting sections,
and others together with the
rest of the University community,
fail to keep the Union as clean as
it could be, does not seem to deny
the maturity and responsibility of
the student body. While many
may differ on the point, wo do not
view it as one of the roles of stu
dent government to keep the Uni
versity clean. Hopefully, however,
students will voluntarily respond
to the President’s suggestion in
this matter.
