# 'Tangent' Turns to Ethnicism
## 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
It is curious that, in the town
where originated the talents of
Joan Baez and the Kingston Trio,
to name only two, there is no cof
fee-house where one can sit and
drink a beer or have a sandwich
and coke while listening to the
area’s best live folk music. But
for a fact there is no such place
from San Jose to San Mateo.
Stuart Goldstein and David
Schoenstadt, two resident: doctors
at Stanford Hospital, have decid
ed to remedy this. This Friday
they will open Top of the Tan
gent, an upstairs coffee-shop over
the Tangent Restaurant (117 Uni
versity Ave., right off the Circlet.
The Top will feature a pair of
live folk singers every Friday and
Saturday night from 9 p.m. until
1 or 2 a.m.
THE TOP is an intimate room
of about twenty tables, many of
them nearly touching the stage.
Goldstein and Schoenstadt predict
it wiil be packed; they request
patrons to limit their stay to two
“sets,” or forty minutes of folk
music. The overflow from the
Top will be accommodated in the
Tangent Restaurant below, which
wall be operating as usual. Coffee,
light and dark beer, soft drinks,
hot cider, and sandwiches will be
served on both floors; and the
music upstairs will be piped to
the restaurant below, where a
checker or backgammon set will
be provided to anyone who re
quests it. There is no admission,
and no cover charge; but in order
to meet expenses (the managers
are seeking no profit) Stu and

Dave request that each person
spend a dollar.
Both of the singers opening the
Top this Friday have been re
corded by prominent companies;
and one of them is nationally
known. Bill Wood, a Ph.D. candi
date in biochemistry at Stanford,
1 is best known for his appearances
| with Joan Baez; the two were in
j separable on Joan’s first album
j (“Folksingers ’Round Harvard
(Square,” Veritas Cultural Rec
ords), Bill has also appeared on
, Epic records as the leader of The
! Raunch Hands.
Featured with Bill will be Keith
Clark, a teacher of creative writ
j ing at Palo Alto High School, and
! his son K. C. Clark, who is the
j only banjo student of Pete Sec
j gcr, a close family friend. Keith
j has written more songs than he
I has recorded; many of his songs
have been extensively popularized
| by other singers; hut Keith has
; made one record of his own for
| Folkways.
FEATURED A week later, Feb
ruary 1 and 2, will bo Tom Kal
mar and Randy Jarrell. Tom Kal
mar is a Berkeley graduate stu
dent from Australia, who has
lived in eight countries and
speaks seven languages. He star
red in the latest Berkeley Folk
Festival, and has his own folk

Festival, and has his own folk

Jarrell is an 18-year-old girl from
San Mateo who has performed in
Paris, where her father works as
a night-club guitarist. Starting
the second week the Top will of
fer at 12 p.m. a Midnight Special,

It is curious that, in the town
where originated the talents of
Joan Baez and the Kingston Trio,
to name only two, there is no cof
fee-house where one can sit and
drink a beer or have a sandwich
and coke while listening to the
area’s best live folk music. But
for a fact there is no such place
from San Jose to San Mateo.
Stuart Goldstein and David
Schoenstadt, two resident: doctors
at Stanford Hospital, have decid
ed to remedy this. This Friday
they will open Top of the Tan
gent, an upstairs coffee-shop over
the Tangent Restaurant (117 Uni
versity Ave., right off the Circlet.
The Top will feature a pair of
live folk singers every Friday and
Saturday night from 9 p.m. until
1 or 2 a.m.
THE TOP is an intimate room
of about twenty tables, many of
them nearly touching the stage.
Goldstein and Schoenstadt predict
it wiil be packed; they request
patrons to limit their stay to two
“sets,” or forty minutes of folk
music. The overflow from the
Top will be accommodated in the
Tangent Restaurant below, which
wall be operating as usual. Coffee,
light and dark beer, soft drinks,
hot cider, and sandwiches will be
served on both floors; and the
music upstairs will be piped to
the restaurant below, where a
checker or backgammon set will
be provided to anyone who re
quests it. There is no admission,
and no cover charge; but in order
to meet expenses (the managers
are seeking no profit) Stu and

Dave request that each person
spend a dollar.
Both of the singers opening the
Top this Friday have been re
corded by prominent companies;
and one of them is nationally
known. Bill Wood, a Ph.D. candi
date in biochemistry at Stanford,
1 is best known for his appearances
| with Joan Baez; the two were in
j separable on Joan’s first album
j (“Folksingers ’Round Harvard
(Square,” Veritas Cultural Rec
