# Sterling Asks Scrutiny Of Curriculum, Grants
##

By NORMAN GREENBERG
“I am not so satisfied with the
state of the University to be smug
about it. .. . Stanford enjoys
good health, but its work is never
done. And this is as it should be,”
President J. E. Wallace Sterling
explained as his view of the Uni
versity at his annual convocation
yesterday, sponsored by the Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow Com
mittee.

Specifically, Sterling stressed
the need for intensive scrutiny of
the undergraduate curriculum.
Honors courses, tutorials, courses
covering several quarters, and
classes at overseas campuses
must bo especially examined in
the near future. Federal grants
and contracts present a second
immediate problem: will reduced
or altered government spending
place the University in financial
difficulty? Will federal grants
imbalance the University curric
ulum?

BUT STERLING primarily
stressed the importance of the in
dividual student to the Universi
ty’s strength and growth. “The
quality of the University will
never exceed the quality of its
members.”
Student government, which “de
rives its authority and its being

from the Board of Trustees,”
also derives its power from the
quality of the student. The Board
of Trustees is now examining the
new constitution. The changes in
the constitution include interpre
tations of partisan politics and
sectarianism.

CONCERNING partisan poli
tics, Sterling commended mount
ing student interest in political
affairs, but demanded persuasive
proof that the “students are in
formed, mature, and therefore
responsible.’’ Behavior in the
rooting sections and the condi
tion of the grounds in front of
Tresidder Union falsify claims of
student maturity and responsi
bility. Responsible conduct and
commendable habits might be less
glamorous and interesting than
public affairs, but they are equal
ly important, Sterling said.
But there are those who say
that the University must only
concern itself with the academic
proficiency of the individual. “I
cannot accept this view; it points
to social anarchy.” And, he added,
this view demands that the Uni
versity “betray its educational
tradition and the public trust,”
The PACE program is directly
related to this concern. Sterling
said. For those who contribute
funds to the University do so with
conviction in Stanford University,
higher education, and leadership.
Unkempt, untidy, and irre
sponsible people are not leaders,
and their universit;/ is not re
sponisble, he said. Sterling added
that the PACE campaign total
has now approached $66 million.
Sterling further discussed the
relationship between graduate
and undergraduate training and
the difficulties of the increased
complexities of ihe University.
STERLING SAID that the gen
erally accepted notion that the
undergraduate training must suf
fer when the faculty is engaged
in research and graduate training
is “folklore,” because it is false.
Citing a recent Ford Foundation
grant for graduate study, Ster
ling explained that the research
strengthened the University as a
whole, the teacher taught under
graduate as well as graduate
courses, and the books used in
this project increased the library
sources for all students.

The most striking example of
the difficulties posed by the com
plexity of the University is the
recent charge that federal re
search funds were used for the
construction of the pool at the
Stanford Medical Center. Sterling
said that Washington has been
informed of its error.
