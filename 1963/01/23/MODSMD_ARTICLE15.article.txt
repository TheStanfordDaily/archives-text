The prediction that Communist China will explode a nuclear
device within two years makes urgent an agreement prohibiting
nuclear testing. It the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States
can reach agreement, the first step will have been achieved toward
nuclear disarmament. But even with those three powers abstain
ing from A-tests, the danger of nuclear war remains and perhaps
intensifies with the development of French and Chinese nuclear
capability.
Unless both France and China are included in an agreement
limiting nuclear forces, a three-power treaty would be meaningless
and dangerous, both for the Soviet Union and the United States.
As the U.S. commander of Pacific Forces, Admiral Harry D. Felt,
said, the Russians should be as disturbed as the free world.
When the Chinese are able to announce their first nuclear test
explosion, the world will be shocked and for good reason. Only
by increased effort in the negotiation of a test ban treaty will the
world be saved from the dangerous days of Chinese nuclear im
perialism.
