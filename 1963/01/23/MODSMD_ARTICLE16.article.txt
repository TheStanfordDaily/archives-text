# Cuts in Foreign Aid
## 
### 
While there may be legitimate objections to the size of Presi
dent Kennedy's predicted budget deficit, there can be no legiti
mate criticism of spending money for national security. This atti
tude seems predominant in Congress when the appropriation is for
military defense, and Congressional support for strengthening the
U.S. military forces will give short-term aid to the cause of peace.
However, Congressâ€™s attitude changes remarkably when foreign
aid outlays arc asked for. Under the leadership of men like Rep
resentative Passman (D-La.) Congress has traditionally been will
ing to finance arms but hesitant to finance programs whose effect
is to deter Communism on a long-range basis. Cutting foreign aid
appropriations is politically advantageous for most Representa
tives.
Rep. Passman is no exception, and as Chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, he can make his influence
effective. Since the House Appropriations Committee rarely over
rules its subcommittee and since the House rarely spends more
money than the Committee recommends. Rep. Passman has extra
ordinary power in foreign aid matters. This year Rep. Passman
wants to cut the aid program from the requested $4.9 billion to
less than $3.9 billion, either figure being less than ten per cent of
the military budget of $55.4 billion. If Rep. Passman is trying to
save the nation only $1 billion, he should hunt for extravagance
elsewhere in the budget.
