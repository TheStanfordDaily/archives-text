# TSHOMBE WILLING
## Loose Federation Best Solution For Halting Communism in Congo 
### RICHARD WEINIG 
I spoke yesterday of a veritable
quagmire into which the United
States has stumbled: that of de
stroying its friends and financing
the victory of its enemies.

In the name of restoring the
peace in the Congo, President
Kennedy has thrice financed war
against Tshombe, apparently not
realizing that forcible termination
of Katanga’s secession will hardly
outlast departure of the bayonets
which imposed It.

WHAT THE United States and
the United Nations fail to com
prehend is that an attack upon
Tshombe is not merely an attack
upon an individual, or a govern
ment, or a political party. It is an
assault upon the Lunda, one of
the largest tribes in Central Afri
ca, and upon the tribes which
each of Tshombe’s cabinet minis
ters represent: tribes which are
age-old enemies of those in the
northern Congo.
Therefore, surrender of Elisa
bethville, or Kamina, or Kolwezi
is but a token surrender unless
the United Nations is willing to
undertake the brutal task of de
stroying the military potential
which each of the tribes holds in
the bush. And unless the United
Nations intends to occupy Katan
ga on a permanent basis—as the
Nazis did France and Norway—
tribal warfare against the Central
Government will erupt at any op
portune time.

Thus, present policies have led
the United Nations to a rather un
pleasant choice; It may perma
nently occupy Katanga, which is
financially infeasible; or, after
nominally ending the secession,
it may turn the Province over to
the tender mercies of the Central
Government and await the hor
rors of the tribal warfare which
will ensue. (Smith Hempstone.
“Congressional Record.” Oct. 12,
1962. p. 220.19.)
IN THE NAME of restoring eco
nomic stability in the Congo, the
President has financed a policy
which will not only fail to sub
stantially alleviate the financial
difficulties in Leopoldville. It will,
in all probability, cause the col
lapse of even Katanga’s economy
by prompting an almost univer
sal exodus of whites from the
Province.

In the name of halting commu
nism in the Congo, the President
has financed a policy which will
subjugate the most valuable,
pro-Western area in black Africa
to a government so heavily rid
dled with communists that its sal
vation under any circumstances
is problematic.
In the name of building a world
under law, the President has fi
nanced a policy which openly and
flagrantly defies clearly defined
standards of international law.
U THANT’S actions are, first,
in clear violation of the mandate
given him by the General Assem
bly to use force only to quell the
outbreak of civil war. Secondly,
they transgress upon the Charter
of the United Nations: “Nothing
contained in the present Charter
shall authorize the United Na
tions to intervene in matters
which are essentially within the
domestic jurisdiction of any
state.” (Chapter I, Article 7.)
Third, in addition to violating
its own Charter, United Nations
actions to terminate the Katan
ganese secession flagrantly vio
late all international law dealing
with the problem of secession.
Under this law, secession of one
part of a nation from the rest is,
and always has been, the purely
internal concern of the state in
volved. Period. But apparently, a
new morality is emerging from a
structure on the East River.
(Hempstone. “Congressional Rec
ord.” Oct. 12, 1962. p. 22061.)
If the new premise is accepted
—that secession becomes the con
cern of an international body
when that body deems it to be
such—all manner of puzzling di
lemmas ensue.
IF THE United Nations had
existed two hundred years ago
and had seen fit to do so, would
it have been justified in prevent
ing the secession of the American
colonies from Great Britain or
the South American nations from
Spain and Portugal?
And, if the United Nations is
right today in preventing the Ka

tanganese secession, was it not
wrong yesterday in not prevent
ing the secession of Pakistan
from India; or the division of
French West Africa and French
Equitorial Africa into twelve sep
arate nations? Is this the shape
of the new’ rationale?
Mow, then, could the United
Stales be persuaded to support
such policies? This is, perhaps,
best revealed in a conversation
between Smith Hempstone and
an unnamed State Department of
ficial who is largely responsible
for present American policies:
QUESTION: “Why are we as a
nation supporting the suppres
sion of Katanga?”
ANSWER: “The President has
questioned almost every African
leader who has visited Washing
ton as to his views on Tshombe;
all of them regard him as a
stooge.”

QUESTION: “Have any of
them ever visited Katanga or
met Tshombe? Do any of them
have any real knowledge of the
situation?”

ANSWER: “Most of them don’t
know much about the situation,
but they feel strongly about it.”
QUESTION: “What you’re say
ing is that it’s better for America
to be popular than to act either
morally or intelligently?”
ANSWER: “I wouldn’t put it
that way. We just feel that Amer
ica should be in the mainstream
on questions such as this.” (“Con
gressional Record,” Oct. 12, 1962.
p. 22060.)

This is the difficulty in a nut
shell; the Afro-Asian leaders may
not know much about the situa
tion, but they do feel strongly
about it. And the United States
has no choice but to underwrite
their whims, regardless of how
detrimental this may be to the
security of the Free World or the
welfare of the African people.
How ridiculous can one get?
And, accepting present actions
in Katanga as a precedent, to

how many future wars will the
lark of knowledge and strong
whims of certain Afro-Asian
leaders commit the United
States? Speculation in the matter
is rather disturbing.
THKKKFORK, I would suggest
the following course of action.
U Thant’s policy of “reunifica
tion” should be terminated forth
with and replaced with one of
two alternatives.

If possible, a loose federation,
such as that agreed upon by
Adoula and Tshombe at Tanana
rive in March, 19G1, should be
effected. Under’ this arrangement,
limited financial aid would be
given to Leopoldville from Ka
tanga; and the United Nations
would cooperate with Adoula in
restoring order in the rest of the
Congo, particularly in eliminating
governmental corruption. Until
such reforms have been achieved,
Tshombe would retain adminis
trative autonomy of Katanga.
This would have, at least, a lim
ited chance of preventing a com
munist take-over in Leopoldville.
Moreover, Tshombe has repeated
ly expressed willingness to join
such a federation.

HOWEVER, if Leopoldville will
not consent to such an agreement,
no choice remains but to grant to
Katanga the status of an inde
pendent nation. Granted, such an
arrangement risks an even more
complete communist victory in
Leopoldville than presently ex
ists. But, unlike the Thant pro
gram, it would not precipitate an
economic collapse by inducing a
white exodus, which would open
Katanga to communist infiltra
tion also. In a word, if worst
comes to worst, it is better to lose
half of the Congo to Moscow than
all.
As when reporting the place
ment of missiles in Cuba some
three weeks before the Presi
dent’s speech of October 22, I
pray that I will be proved wrong,
but fear that I will not.
