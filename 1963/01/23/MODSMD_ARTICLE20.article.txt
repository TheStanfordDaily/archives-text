## JFK's Objective to Balance Economy Before the Budget 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
It is always necessary to remember that, when the budget
documents are presented to Congress in January, we are looking
at estimates of what may be going to happen a long time ahead.
Even if we discount the unforeseeable emergency expenditures,
the total figures purport to describe, first, what will have been

spent and received by next July-t
(fiscal 1963) and, then, what may
have been spent and received by
the July after that, (fiscal 1964).
As these estimates depend on
predictions of how good business
will be. it is not surprising that
they are never exactly right.
Thus, in the years 1958-63 inclu
sive, the actual deficits were un
derestimated five times and the
surplus was underestimated once.
The moral of the tale is to prac
tice humility.
This, the second Kennedy budg
et, differs from all preceding

budgets in that
it expresses
openly modern
economic theory
as developed in
this generation.
Other budgets,
even some of Ei
senhower’s budg
ets, have reflect
ed the theory
without acknowl

edging it. Bui this budget makes
the theory explicit. We should add
that the application of the theory
is very moderate and cautious.
The nub of the theory is that,
in the modern economy, the first
objective is not to balance the
government budget itself, but to
balance the economy; when the
economy is balanced at full ca
pacity and full employment, the
budget will itself tend to come
into balance. The budget cannot
be balanced successfully without
unacceptable hardship if (he econ
omy is not balanced.
THE FEDERAL budget is able
to exert this compensatory influ
ence on the economy, because it
controls something approaching
one-fifth of (he income received
by the public and takes in taxes
one-fifth of the people’s income.
This one-fifth multiplies its effect
on the business economy as those
who receive money from the gov
ernment spend the money in the
shops and the shopkeepers spend
their profits in other shops.
If we wish to measure the sec
ond Kennedy budget in the rough
way that this sort of thing can be
measured, we must look past the
administrative budget, wTiich is
what is usually called “The”
budget. We must look to the fed
eral portion of what are called
the “National Income Accounts.”
This budget is the most accurate
and comprehensive measure we
have of what the government
lakes from the people and what
it pays out to them.
The present estimate is that,
for this fiscal year ending June
30, the government will pay out
$4.3 billion more than it takes in.
In economic terms, this is the
true estimated deficit for fiscal

4- — •
1963. For the following year (fis
cal 1964), the estimated deficit,
or perhaps the best guess, is that,
taking account of the proposed
tax cuts, the deficit will be $7.6
billion.
IF THE BASIC theory is cor
rect, that the economy is stimu
lated to expand when more is
paid out than is taken in, then
business which is not too bad but
is sluggish now should be better
next year. We shall see. We do
know as we look back that, in
1962 when business faltered rath
er badly, there was virtually no
deficit (minus 1.7 billion) in the
national income accounts.
The annual report of the Coun
cil of Economic Advisors, which
is a most informative and impres
sive document, is required read
ing for anyone who means to dis
cuss seriously the budget and the
tax cuts and all the rest. It shows,
for instance, that there is a close
relationship between business
slack and unplanned budgetary
deficits. This is because of the re
lationship between private busi
ness deficits on capital account
and federal tax receipts. On page
76, there is a chart showing this
relationship. In 12 out of 15 cases
since 1947, there has been a strik
ing relationship between federal
deficits in the national income ac
counts and business slack. As the
economy expands, as business
spends and invests, the budgetary
receipts move toward a surplus.
When the economy contracts,
when business cuts down spend
ing and investing, government ac
counts show deficits.
This is why the administrative
budgetary deficit, such as we
have had (except only in 1959)
since 1958, cannot in fact be elim
inated “by raising tax rates or
reducing government expendi
tures.” The chronic Eisenhower -
Kennedy deficits have not been
caused by too little taxes or too
much spending. They have been
caused by the slackness and slug
gishness of the economy. It is to
this evil that the new budget is
addressed.
SINCE ALL (his is not what
the older generation was taught
in school and college, it will need
a lot of explanation and demon
stration. The President and his
Council of Economic Advisors
have made a very good beginning.
But the theory is new. and the
proof of it, though impressive, is
not yet conclusive. What we do
know with certainly is (hat the
old theory of administrative
budgets balanced annually does
not work.

It is always necessary to remember that, when the budget
documents are presented to Congress in January, we are looking
at estimates of what may be going to happen a long time ahead.
Even if we discount the unforeseeable emergency expenditures,
the total figures purport to describe, first, what will have been

spent and received by next July-t
(fiscal 1963) and, then, what may
have been spent and received by
the July after that, (fiscal 1964).
As these estimates depend on
predictions of how good business
will be. it is not surprising that
they are never exactly right.
Thus, in the years 1958-63 inclu
sive, the actual deficits were un
derestimated five times and the
surplus was underestimated once.
The moral of the tale is to prac
tice humility.
This, the second Kennedy budg
et, differs from all preceding

budgets in that
it expresses
openly modern
economic theory
as developed in
this generation.
Other budgets,
even some of Ei
senhower’s budg
ets, have reflect
ed the theory
without acknowl

edging it. Bui this budget makes
the theory explicit. We should add
that the application of the theory
is very moderate and cautious.
The nub of the theory is that,
in the modern economy, the first
objective is not to balance the
government budget itself, but to
balance the economy; when the
economy is balanced at full ca
pacity and full employment, the
budget will itself tend to come
into balance. The budget cannot
be balanced successfully without
unacceptable hardship if (he econ
omy is not balanced.
THE FEDERAL budget is able
to exert this compensatory influ
ence on the economy, because it
controls something approaching
one-fifth of (he income received
by the public and takes in taxes
one-fifth of the people’s income.
This one-fifth multiplies its effect
on the business economy as those
who receive money from the gov
ernment spend the money in the
shops and the shopkeepers spend
their profits in other shops.
If we wish to measure the sec
ond Kennedy budget in the rough
way that this sort of thing can be
measured, we must look past the
administrative budget, wTiich is
what is usually called “The”
budget. We must look to the fed
eral portion of what are called
the “National Income Accounts.”
This budget is the most accurate
and comprehensive measure we
have of what the government
lakes from the people and what
it pays out to them.
The present estimate is that,
for this fiscal year ending June
30, the government will pay out
$4.3 billion more than it takes in.
In economic terms, this is the
true estimated deficit for fiscal

4- — •
1963. For the following year (fis
cal 1964), the estimated deficit,
or perhaps the best guess, is that,
taking account of the proposed
tax cuts, the deficit will be $7.6
billion.
IF THE BASIC theory is cor
rect, that the economy is stimu
lated to expand when more is
paid out than is taken in, then
business which is not too bad but
is sluggish now should be better
next year. We shall see. We do
know as we look back that, in
1962 when business faltered rath
er badly, there was virtually no
deficit (minus 1.7 billion) in the
national income accounts.
The annual report of the Coun
cil of Economic Advisors, which
is a most informative and impres
sive document, is required read
ing for anyone who means to dis
cuss seriously the budget and the
tax cuts and all the rest. It shows,
for instance, that there is a close
relationship between business
slack and unplanned budgetary
deficits. This is because of the re
lationship between private busi
ness deficits on capital account
and federal tax receipts. On page
76, there is a chart showing this
relationship. In 12 out of 15 cases
since 1947, there has been a strik
ing relationship between federal
deficits in the national income ac
counts and business slack. As the
economy expands, as business
spends and invests, the budgetary
receipts move toward a surplus.
When the economy contracts,
when business cuts down spend
ing and investing, government ac
counts show deficits.
This is why the administrative
budgetary deficit, such as we
have had (except only in 1959)
since 1958, cannot in fact be elim
inated “by raising tax rates or
reducing government expendi
tures.” The chronic Eisenhower -
Kennedy deficits have not been
caused by too little taxes or too
much spending. They have been
caused by the slackness and slug
gishness of the economy. It is to
this evil that the new budget is
addressed.

It is always necessary to remember that, when the budget
documents are presented to Congress in January, we are looking
at estimates of what may be going to happen a long time ahead.
Even if we discount the unforeseeable emergency expenditures,
the total figures purport to describe, first, what will have been

spent and received by next July-t
(fiscal 1963) and, then, what may
have been spent and received by
the July after that, (fiscal 1964).
As these estimates depend on
predictions of how good business
will be. it is not surprising that
they are never exactly right.
Thus, in the years 1958-63 inclu
sive, the actual deficits were un
derestimated five times and the
surplus was underestimated once.
The moral of the tale is to prac
tice humility.
This, the second Kennedy budg
et, differs from all preceding

budgets in that
it expresses
openly modern
economic theory
as developed in
this generation.
Other budgets,
even some of Ei
senhower’s budg
ets, have reflect
ed the theory
without acknowl

edging it. Bui this budget makes
the theory explicit. We should add
that the application of the theory
is very moderate and cautious.
The nub of the theory is that,
in the modern economy, the first
objective is not to balance the
government budget itself, but to
balance the economy; when the
economy is balanced at full ca
pacity and full employment, the
budget will itself tend to come
into balance. The budget cannot
be balanced successfully without
unacceptable hardship if (he econ
omy is not balanced.
THE FEDERAL budget is able
to exert this compensatory influ
ence on the economy, because it
controls something approaching
one-fifth of (he income received
by the public and takes in taxes
one-fifth of the people’s income.
This one-fifth multiplies its effect
on the business economy as those
who receive money from the gov
ernment spend the money in the
shops and the shopkeepers spend
their profits in other shops.
If we wish to measure the sec
ond Kennedy budget in the rough
way that this sort of thing can be
measured, we must look past the
administrative budget, wTiich is
what is usually called “The”
budget. We must look to the fed
eral portion of what are called
the “National Income Accounts.”
This budget is the most accurate
and comprehensive measure we
have of what the government
lakes from the people and what
it pays out to them.
The present estimate is that,
for this fiscal year ending June
30, the government will pay out
$4.3 billion more than it takes in.
In economic terms, this is the
true estimated deficit for fiscal

4- — •
1963. For the following year (fis
cal 1964), the estimated deficit,
or perhaps the best guess, is that,
taking account of the proposed
tax cuts, the deficit will be $7.6
billion.
IF THE BASIC theory is cor
rect, that the economy is stimu
lated to expand when more is
paid out than is taken in, then
business which is not too bad but
is sluggish now should be better
next year. We shall see. We do
know as we look back that, in
1962 when business faltered rath
er badly, there was virtually no
deficit (minus 1.7 billion) in the
national income accounts.
The annual report of the Coun
cil of Economic Advisors, which
is a most informative and impres
sive document, is required read
ing for anyone who means to dis
cuss seriously the budget and the
tax cuts and all the rest. It shows,
for instance, that there is a close
relationship between business
slack and unplanned budgetary
deficits. This is because of the re
lationship between private busi
ness deficits on capital account
and federal tax receipts. On page
76, there is a chart showing this
relationship. In 12 out of 15 cases
since 1947, there has been a strik
ing relationship between federal
deficits in the national income ac
counts and business slack. As the
economy expands, as business
spends and invests, the budgetary
