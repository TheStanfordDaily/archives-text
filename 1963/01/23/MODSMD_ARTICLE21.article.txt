# De Gaulle's Refusal to Accept Polaris Precipitates Crisis
## 
### KENT SMITH Staff Opinion 
When Charles de Gaulle point
edly refused to take the Polaris
missiles offered him and thereby
withdrew France from the U.S.
plan for a nuclear partnership of
Europe, the long-running dis
agreements between the two al
lies turned into an open clash.
Beyond the disturbing differ
ences on the surface, the contro
versy has revealed two underly
ing forces of little-realized signi
ficance: first, the full blown rebel
lion against American influence
In the Europe of the future and
second, the startling disruption of
political unity within the Little
Europe “Six” itself.
A FEW WEEKS ago, France
appeared likely to accept the Po
laris offer. France herself could
not hope to develop a comparable
nuclear force for at least ten
years. Her main fear, that the
U.S. might not risk atomic war in
a showdown over Europe, was ap
parently resolved by a guarantee
to independent use of the Polaris
in times of great national emer
gency.

Other NATO countries, notably
Germany, expected France to
grab up the offer, creating a
three-nation atomic club, and
thereby reduce the rest of the
Alliance to second-class status.
Understandably, General De
Gaulle’s “non” was puzzling.

IN A SIMILAR 19:59 case,
France forced the U.S. to remove
its nuclear-armed air units when
the U.S. would not put the A
weapons under French control.
Rather than rising in protest, the
U.S. and President Eisenhower
continued to support De Gaulle’s
drive to restore French influence
in Europe. This time, however,
top American officials are mak
ing frantic trips to the continent
in response to an obviously major
crisis.

WHY DID De Gaulle refuse so
attractive an offer to France as
the Polaris deal? Apparently, le
President is playing a gambit a
familiar move to chessmen and
ex-generals—in which a present
sacrifice is purposely made in or
der to gain a tactical advantage
in position.
Although he has lost the Po
laris weapons system, De Gaulle
has succeeded in publicly declar
ing France free of U.S. nuclear
control and independently po
sitioned in respect to the NATO
plan.
De Gaulle's Power Drive
De Gaulle considers himself
not only the head of the new
France, finally free of the Algeri
an mess and now enjoying great
economic prosperity, but also the
leader of the new Europe. The
future of the Common Market
countries—now producing more
steel than the Soviet Union and
doing more of the world’s trade
than the U.S.—lies, De Gaulle
proclaims, in becoming an inde
pendent “third force” between the
U.S. and Russia.

IN MAKING HIS stand against
the Polaris deal, he has diametri
cally opposed the British. Clearly,
the general has refused to follow
them into the American-dominat
ed camp and has condemned
them as lackeys under U.S. or
ders.

Realizing the importance of the
gambit, De Gaulle deliberately
timed his pronouncement one
hour before President Kennedy
delivered the “State of the Un
ion” message. Purposefully up
staging Kennedy in front of the
world, he also managed to render
the President’s prepared state
ments about Atlantic unity near
ridiculous.
De Gaulle, quite probably,
would have preferred to stage his
rebellion later, when both the
Common Market and his own po
sition were considerably stronger.
Apparently, Britain’s nearness to
membership, which would un
doubtedly weaken Franco’s re
spective status, forced him to act.
Furthermore, for France to
join the multilateral nuclear plan
under NATO would have, in ef
fect, increased U.S. dominance in
West Europe and, a greater dan
ger, required her to abandon her
own atomic projects. Quite cor
rectly, only with an independent
nuclear force of its own could
France exert a decisive influence
on world affairs.
Against these pressures that
threatened to destroy his “grand
design” of a continental system
led by France, De Gaulle acted
quickly and decisively.
( an the General maintain ins
present stand?
DE GAULLE clearly cannot ac
cept the Polaris integrated de
fense system without destroying
his basic plans for the future.
And he is not the kind of man to
compromise and lose prestige
once he has really committed him
self. Also, little pressure can be
applied anywhere to make him
accept the plan.
De Gaulle’s rebellion and his in
sistence on the reality of the
“third force” and its great future,
however, seriously challenges the
plans for a united Atlantic com
munity and seriously jeopardizes
the life of the NTAO alliance.
The very heavy fighting that the
U.S. is doing in the key European
capitals to preserve these goals
could result in France’s eventual
cooperation or at least leave her
stranded alone outside NATO.
As a free power, France will
obviously forfeit for years the de
cisive influence she seeks. Never
theless, still maintaining his in
dependent position, De Gaulle and
his proposed partners can wait
while the Common Market con
tinues to grow stronger econom
ically, militarily and, necessarily,
politically.
THE ROLE THAT De Gaulle
has written for himself is pri
marily for the future. As a good
tactician, he offers many Euro
peans two things they badly
want: a strong voice in all the
decisions that affect them and a
nuclear weapons supply always
available to defend their freedom.
Faced with the Polaris propos
als, De Gaulle found himself sud
denly at a major crossroads. A
France w r eak but independent
with a promise to head a truly
powerful West Europe of the fu
ture, was infinitely better, he de
cided, than a Polaris-equipped
France always second to the
United States.
Little Europe Split
Though primarily a Washing
ton-Paris quarrel, the Polaris
controversy has also provoked a
surprising political split within
Little Europe itself. Both West

Germany and Italy, for example,
have indicated acceptance of the
American proposal for a multi
lateral atomic force, exactly op
posite the French decision.

THE U.S. HAS stressed its in
tention to move ahead vigorously
with the plan in cooperation with
the other NATO nations, regard
less of the French refusal.

To the men who signed the
Treaty of Rome—the basis of the
Common Market a politically
united Europe, free from the cen
turies-old rivalries, was the most
important goal.
In a recent report, the Commis
sion of the European Economic
Community (Common Market I
declared: “What we call the eco
nomic integration of Europe is in
essence a political phenomenon,”
that “the European Economic
Community forms a political un
ion embracing the economic and
social spheres.”
In both the Polaris dispute and
the question of Britain’s entry
into the Market, the other five
members have clearly disagreed
with France, The present disa
greements have also revealed a
fundamental issue dividing the
members of the EEC.
MOST OF THE Community, es
pecially Belgium, strongly sup
ports a final federated Europe,
united and supranational. Do
Gaulle, however, favors a “Eu
rope des Parties,” a confederation
of states presumably headed by
France.

There is a real fear, e'ven in
France, that the Gaullist plan
could lead to a serious weakening
of the Community system and a
temporary abandonment of the
European federation ideal.
The differences between De
Gaulle and his EEC partners in
both the Polaris case and the fed
eration issue definitely show sur
prising political divisions within
the union.
Germany the Key
IN RELATION to De Gaulle’s
challenge to the present Ameri
can influence, the internal con
flicts in Europe itself obviously
weaken his position. A united
EEC behind him is basic to the
success of his programs.
Although the General will stand
adamantly against the Polaris
deal for France, he will probably
not fight strongly against it for
West Germany or the others.

Rather, De Gaulle will try even
harder to cultivate their friend-1
ship, even to compromising on
basic internal policies, in order to
strengthen his hand among the
Six. Whether Little Europe is
federated or confederate, the pow
er of the “third force” would still
be consequential.
THE KEY TO WINNING the!
other five ultimately over to j
France’s position is the West Ger- ]
man Republic. The fundamental!
co-operation of Audenauer here I
becomes indispensible to De |
Gaulle. The General’s remarkable [
gesture of coming out into the j
rain to receive the Chancellor
arrived in France two days ago
. . . emphasizes the crucial im- 1
portance he gives this matter.
The posture that Germany takes |
in relation to the U.S. and France j
at Paris now will decide which |
way West Europe goes.
IF BONN AND PARIS achieve
a genuine partnership, the Com-1

inunity will be greatly strength
ened. Such increased power for
the European bloc would undoubt
edly mean a lessening of the
American influence. A wavering
or essential inaction at this lime,
however, could result in further
splits in Europe and continue the
established American hegemony.
Although the French - German
meetings are likely to produce
the expected “new intimate agree
ments and relationships between
indivisible allies”, only if the Ger
man position changes to discour
agement of British entry in the
Common Market or to rejection of
the Polaris proposals will there be
a significant Paris-Bonn alliance.
Chancellor Audenauer has so
far gone considerably out of his
way to avoid making a clear-cut
decision between France and the
U.S. Most likely, he will continue
to maintain the friendliest rela
tions he can with the two quarrel
i ling powers.
