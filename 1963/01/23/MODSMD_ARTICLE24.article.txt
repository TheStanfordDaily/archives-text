# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Pavilion Crowd Sees Two Unique Features 
### Glenn Alford 
Those lucky enough to be present in the Pavilion Saturday
night were treated to a triple feature laugh riot that has been
equalled in recent Stanford history only by the twin bill shown in
Mem And at the Sunday Flicks a few days ago, “The Blob’’ and “I
Married a Monster from Outer Space.”
The first of the three acts started at 4 p.m. when the Stanford
Braves tackled the San Francisco Presidio. The Presidio featured
Walt Torrence, a former Uclan All-Coast forward who has high
jumped 6-6, and who can do almost anything with a basketball.
Though Torrence has gained his chief fame on the basketball court,
his latest renown is of another type completely.
He is now well-known around the barracks for the quantities of
,3.2 beverage he can consume. He may or may not have consumed

some of the aforementioned fluid
before he look the court against
the Braves, but in any case he
had trouble. Eric Loehwing, a 6-8
center for Stanford who had
never played first string on any
college team until Craig Cordes
broke his frontal sinus lobe,
blocked most everything Torrence
launched toward the basket.
Despite Torrence’s difficulties,
the Presidio won because Charlie
Franklin, an ex-Oregon star,
ruined (he Braves with his super
lative rebounding.
At 6 p.m., the Stanford Fresh
men were slated to tangle with
Sacramento City College, a team
featuring 3-foot, 7-inch guards
and a second string center named
“Bugs” Walton! “Bugs” literally
all over the court, and his elbow
antics had Card pivotman Ray
Kosanke wondering if he was

trying to win the Pavilion twist championship. "Bugs” had the ef
frontery to tangle with 6-5 230-pound Card forward George Maentz.
George has the build of an All-American football player, which a
Relative of his was at Michigan, and "Bugs” was easily discouraged.
The gnat-sized guards tried vainly to stop Skip Hutchinson’s
jump shot, no mean feat, even for a 64 player. When the runts tried
to shoot 15-foot jumpers they couldn’t muster enough power to reach
the backboard.
They Were Rolling in the Aisles
Basketball purists ran down the aisles toward the exits clutching
their stomachs as the Stanford and Washington varsities ran onto
the court for the piece d’ resistance,
Friday’s Daily had characterized the Washington guards as
players hustling around, drawing fouls. It’s not likely that Charlie
Hart ever had a more accurate press release written about him.
Hart, who can alternately be described as a lovable, if uncoordinated,
ham, and a midget, Mike Ledgerwood, stole the show.

When fouls were called on him as he towered above the pros
trate form of a Stanford player, it was easy to detect his innocence
of any misdeed. His angelic expression could charm a dragon. It is
one of the tragedies of show business that a movie talent scout
missed his Saturday performance in the Stanford triple-feature.
Those who saw all three games Saturday are excused if they
felt cheated. Perhaps their time might have been better spent at an
Ingmar Bergman flick.

never played first string on any
college team until Craig Cordes
broke his frontal sinus lobe,
blocked most everything Torrence
launched toward the basket.
Despite Torrence’s difficulties,
the Presidio won because Charlie
Franklin, an ex-Oregon star,
ruined (he Braves with his super
lative rebounding.
At 6 p.m., the Stanford Fresh
men were slated to tangle with
Sacramento City College, a team
featuring 3-foot, 7-inch guards
and a second string center named
“Bugs” Walton! “Bugs” literally
all over the court, and his elbow
antics had Card pivotman Ray
Kosanke wondering if he was

trying to win the Pavilion twist championship. "Bugs” had the ef
frontery to tangle with 6-5 230-pound Card forward George Maentz.
George has the build of an All-American football player, which a
Relative of his was at Michigan, and "Bugs” was easily discouraged.
The gnat-sized guards tried vainly to stop Skip Hutchinson’s
jump shot, no mean feat, even for a 64 player. When the runts tried
to shoot 15-foot jumpers they couldn’t muster enough power to reach
the backboard.
They Were Rolling in the Aisles
Basketball purists ran down the aisles toward the exits clutching
their stomachs as the Stanford and Washington varsities ran onto
the court for the piece d’ resistance,
Friday’s Daily had characterized the Washington guards as
players hustling around, drawing fouls. It’s not likely that Charlie
Hart ever had a more accurate press release written about him.
Hart, who can alternately be described as a lovable, if uncoordinated,
ham, and a midget, Mike Ledgerwood, stole the show.

When fouls were called on him as he towered above the pros
trate form of a Stanford player, it was easy to detect his innocence
of any misdeed. His angelic expression could charm a dragon. It is
one of the tragedies of show business that a movie talent scout
missed his Saturday performance in the Stanford triple-feature.
Those who saw all three games Saturday are excused if they
felt cheated. Perhaps their time might have been better spent at an
Ingmar Bergman flick.


CHARLIE HART
A lovable ham
Those lucky enough to be present in the Pavilion Saturday
night were treated to a triple feature laugh riot that has been
equalled in recent Stanford history only by the twin bill shown in
Mem And at the Sunday Flicks a few days ago, “The Blob’’ and “I
Married a Monster from Outer Space.”
The first of the three acts started at 4 p.m. when the Stanford
Braves tackled the San Francisco Presidio. The Presidio featured
Walt Torrence, a former Uclan All-Coast forward who has high
jumped 6-6, and who can do almost anything with a basketball.
Though Torrence has gained his chief fame on the basketball court,
his latest renown is of another type completely.
He is now well-known around the barracks for the quantities of
,3.2 beverage he can consume. He may or may not have consumed

some of the aforementioned fluid
before he look the court against
the Braves, but in any case he
had trouble. Eric Loehwing, a 6-8
center for Stanford who had
never played first string on any
college team until Craig Cordes
broke his frontal sinus lobe,
blocked most everything Torrence
launched toward the basket.
