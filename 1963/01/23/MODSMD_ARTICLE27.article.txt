# Rubber Tracks A Springy Success
## 
### DICK DEW (UPI Sports Writer 
WALTHAM, Mass. If the
slingshot style of the fibreglass
vaulting pole upset the track and
field world, wait until they get
to the next gimmick the rubber
running track.
Actually, the mixing of rubber,
cork and various other substances
with asphalt for running tracks
has been going on for 40 years.
But modern technology and a
cinder shortage only recently
have made it a worthwhile busi
ness.

At least four U.S. firms now
are producing a bouncy track sur
face which, they claim, clearly
reduces log fatigue and thereby
markedly improves running
times.

A WALTHAM, Mass., firm,
“Rub Kor America,” is in the
highway surfacing business but
is actively going after the run
ning track market after seven
years of research in the field.

The firm already has built 16
tracks of its patented trade name
material, “Rub Kor,” and has or
ders for a dozen more.
“Rub Kor” claims its surfacing
can’t be damaged by moisture,
frost, dryness, punctures or ex
cessive use; that ti can be install
ed either indoors or outdoors;
that it has an average life of 30
years; that it eliminates body
shock, and that it prevents shin
splints.
THERE WAS a time when a
track just wasn’t a track unless it
was made of cinders. But cinders
ate going the way of the horse,
buggy, cigar store Indian, and
nickel beer.
In fact, Europe is about the
only place you can get a good,
legitimate, old-fashioned, eye-ir
ritating cinder these days. And
today’s cost for a full-scale cinder
■

track runs from $22,000 up to
$37,00.
That’s why “Rub Kor Ameri
ca” says it is getting more orders
than it can handle because the in
stallation cost for its surfacing
exclusive of site preparation—
ranges from $15,000 to $lB,OOO
for a quarter mile oval.
Till 1 . Biggest problem is, of
course, to get the surface in suf
ficiently general use to be ap

proved for Olympic competition.
Nations require four years notice
before anything new Is used un
der Olympic game competition.
Several more years will prob
ably be needed, however, before
Olympic runners compete on rub
ber tracks. The additional time
will be needed to argue whether
running records on rubber can
legitimately replace those made
on cinders.
