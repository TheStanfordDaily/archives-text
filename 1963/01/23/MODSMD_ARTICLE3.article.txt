the West Coast premiere of Her
bert Danska’s, “The Gift.”
Danska’s much-acclaimed film
was the 1962 United States entry
in the Venice, Edinburgh and
Vancouver film festivals. The
film deals with the question of
the sacrifice an artist must make
for his art. as an artist and as a
man.

IX A HUMOROUS vein are the
two films producd by the Nation
al Film Board of Canada. The
first, “I Was a 90-Pound Weak
ling,” explores the world of the
muscle-building crowd, lakes a
contrasting look at the ladies re
moving the bulges in a salon, and
views a perturbed Yogi instruc
tor. The second film, “The Cars
in Your Life,” reveals the essen
tial humor of mechanical objects
endowed with near human prop
erties.

A short film, “Pacific 231,”
concludes the program. This film
is a visualization of the symphon
ic composition of the same title
by Arthur Honegger.
The program of all four films
will b presented Friday at 4:30.
7 and 9:30 p.m., Room 274, Tre
sidder. Tickets are on sale at
