# Sessions Cites Mass Culture Effects in Public Music World
## 
### LYNN SUSAG 
; Mass communications and cul
j tine have profoundly altered the
I make up and character of the mu
| sic world since the end of World
| War I, Roger Sessions asserted in
the second Harry Camp lecture
j series talk on “Music and Society”
last night at Dinkelspiol Auditor
ium.
Sessions has played a role in
American music as composer,
! teacher, author and lecturer for
almost 50 years. A former recip
ient of a Guggenheim Fellowship,
the Fellowship of the American
Academy in Rome and a Carnegie
Fellowship, Sessions is now pi’o
fessor of music at Princeton Uni
versity.
THE MUSIC PUBLIC has
grown immensely from a few
thousand to a few million, Ses
sions said. In this public there has
| been a decline in individual par
i ticipation on the home level.

The immense growth of the
music conveying business was a
second change in the musical
world noted by Sessions. With the
development of the business enter
prise, the public has become a
body of consumers with a signifi
cant economic factor, Sessions
said. When business expands nor
mally this tends to standardize the
products with more quantity pro
duced at the lowest cost and high
est price the market will allow.
As a result the public has changed
from devotees to a mass that is
variable, unsure and subject to
the exigencies of the musical
market.

SESSIONS CITED a third ex
ample of the change in modern
music as the growth of the time
lage between the introduction of
advanced, modernistic “controver
sial’’ music and its eventual ac
ceptance by the public.
Another ramifaction of mass
culture has caused musicians to

become specialists. Earlier virtuo
sos such as Paganini and Liszt
were also composers of promi
nence, but there is hardly any mu
sician today with composer quali
ties, Sessions said.
Artistic enjoyment, Sessions
concluded, really mean s enjoy
ment on all the levels music has
to offer. Music like all other arts
is deeply enmeshed in the inner
lives of men and women and its
destiny is a part of the destiny
of human beings.
