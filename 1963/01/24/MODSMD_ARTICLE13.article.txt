# Text of Eating Clubs' Letter to Sterling Proposing Alterations in Open Contact
##

(Editor’s note: Published below
is flk* letter sent to President
Sterling from the eating clubs. In
it the clubs propose two altera
tions of the proposal submitted
by the five-man rush committee.)
Dear President Sterling,

The Stanford Eating Clubs
have never felt obliged to have
rules defining proper conduct
during the year with regard to
“rushing,” that is, selection of
freshman members for the fol
lowing three years. This means
that the clubs have been free to
invite freshmen to meals, parties,
or any other type of function,
either on-campus or off, through
out the year. This policy has been
very satisfactory among the
clubs and generally to the Wilbur
program as well, because modera
tion has been the rule in our
rushing methods.
But one element in our system
has helped to bring forth the dis
cussions of change. We join with
the fraternities to carry out a
hectic rush week at the beginning
of spring quarter-, securing a ma
jority of membership commit
ments by Sunday of the first
week. Then following that first
week, freshmen in Wilbur and
in Stern who have joined either
a club or a fraternity are present
ed with a split allegiance and un
derstandably gravitate toward
the new group, for it is here that
they will live for the three en
suing years. The split is further
encouraged by “pledge class” ac
tivities either in the form of at
tending weekly meetings in the
clubs or complete house duties
and “pledge” requirements in the
fraternities. The Wilbur and
Stern systems are left disorgan
ized, and even worse, are pre
sented with the conditions of
housing men who no longer care
to associate with their neighbors,
at least not to any degree of earli
er associations.

Because of this disruption of
the two systems, the Wilbur
Sponsors, in 19G1, submitted a
proposal summarizing the feel
ings of two years’ dissatisfaction,
asking that rush be carried out
prior to the sophomore year. The
proposal was not acted upon pre
sumably because it was felt that
too many difficulties were inher
ent, The Wilbur leaders remained
dissatisfied and with administra
tive urging, a committee of five
was created this fall, representing
the four hall groups concerned
with rush. The work of this com
mittee resulted in a proposal
which called for a change—appar
ently a drastic change. With fra
ternity representation complete,
the Interfraternity Council re
jected the proposal as did the
Interclub Council, both groups
claiming that their traditions
would be too greatly sacrificed
for the benefit of the other two
groups.

The Eating Clubs, however, re
alize most acutely that our nega
tive opinion may not maintain
the traditional liberal policy be
cause of the growing pressure of
the other systems involved in the
selection processes. We are aware
that the freshman administration
desires a change, and we are also

aware that (he University has
demonstrated considerable inter
est in the freshmen programs
and has done a great deal to
strengthen it during the past five
years. With these two factors in
mind, we agree that some change
must and will be made, and that
we will have to compromise our
system with the others, while at
the same time maintaining as
many of our past traditions as
possible. We realize that unity
within the Wilbur and Stern sys
tems is'desirable, but we are also
convinced that our selection of
members can best be made in the
freshman year, which will always
create some disunity.
Our selection policy is focused
on meeting as many potential
members as possible, trying to
provide as much opportunity for
those interested to learn a little
of our system. We feel that off
campus contact should be pro
vided because our social life as
well as nearly half of our living
arrangements are, indeed, off the
campus. Therefore, we strongly
recommend that a provision be
made for some minimal, off-cam
pus, social contact winter quarter,
as well as the present provision
for five days in spring quarter in
the Living Group Selection Pro
posal. This contact could ideally
he made following the open
houses which each group con
ducts during the quarter, and
would therefore create only a mi
nor increase in disruption already
present.

As well, it is our understanding
that further negotiation of the
committee resulted in the restate
ment of section 3-c to be as fol
lows; “Restrictions regarding
freshman eating in the upperclass
living groups may be imposed by
the IFC, ICC, or the IHC if they
so desire. If meal invitations are
allowed, no more than five fresh
men may be invited to any given
meal in a living group.” The clubs
feel that, within the proposal as
a whole, this restriction should be
accepted.
The Stanford Eating Clubs
fully understand that the system
of selection which has been pro
posed (with the recommendations
added above) will provide each
system with difficult, and unde
sirable changes. But we also be
lieve that the existing grievances
will be considerably reduced and
therefore subscribe to its adop
tion. We hope that, if put into
practice, this proposal will indeed
confirm the ideals held within.

freshman eating in the upperclass
living groups may be imposed by
the IFC, ICC, or the IHC if they
so desire. If meal invitations are
allowed, no more than five fresh
men may be invited to any given
meal in a living group.” The clubs
feel that, within the proposal as

The Stanford Eating Clubs
fully understand that the system
of selection which has been pro

Sterling from the eating clubs. In

by the five-man rush committee.)
Dear President Sterling,

The Stanford Eating Clubs
have never felt obliged to have
rules defining proper conduct
during the year with regard to
“rushing,” that is, selection of
freshman members for the fol
lowing three years. This means
that the clubs have been free to
invite freshmen to meals, parties,
or any other type of function,
either on-campus or off, through
out the year. This policy has been
very satisfactory among the
clubs and generally to the Wilbur
program as well, because modera
tion has been the rule in our
rushing methods.
But one element in our system
has helped to bring forth the dis
cussions of change. We join with
the fraternities to carry out a
hectic rush week at the beginning
of spring quarter-, securing a ma
jority of membership commit
ments by Sunday of the first
week. Then following that first
week, freshmen in Wilbur and
in Stern who have joined either
a club or a fraternity are present
ed with a split allegiance and un
derstandably gravitate toward
the new group, for it is here that
they will live for the three en
suing years. The split is further
encouraged by “pledge class” ac
tivities either in the form of at
tending weekly meetings in the
clubs or complete house duties
and “pledge” requirements in the
fraternities. The Wilbur and
Stern systems are left disorgan
ized, and even worse, are pre
sented with the conditions of
housing men who no longer care
to associate with their neighbors,
at least not to any degree of earli
er associations.

Because of this disruption of
the two systems, the Wilbur
Sponsors, in 19G1, submitted a
proposal summarizing the feel
ings of two years’ dissatisfaction,
asking that rush be carried out
prior to the sophomore year. The
proposal was not acted upon pre
sumably because it was felt that
too many difficulties were inher
ent, The Wilbur leaders remained
dissatisfied and with administra
tive urging, a committee of five
was created this fall, representing
the four hall groups concerned
with rush. The work of this com
mittee resulted in a proposal
which called for a change—appar
ently a drastic change. With fra
ternity representation complete,
the Interfraternity Council re
jected the proposal as did the
Interclub Council, both groups
claiming that their traditions
would be too greatly sacrificed
for the benefit of the other two
groups.

The Eating Clubs, however, re
alize most acutely that our nega
tive opinion may not maintain
the traditional liberal policy be
cause of the growing pressure of
the other systems involved in the
selection processes. We are aware
that the freshman administration
desires a change, and we are also

aware that (he University has
demonstrated considerable inter
est in the freshmen programs
and has done a great deal to
strengthen it during the past five
years. With these two factors in
mind, we agree that some change
must and will be made, and that
we will have to compromise our
system with the others, while at
the same time maintaining as
many of our past traditions as
possible. We realize that unity
within the Wilbur and Stern sys
tems is'desirable, but we are also
convinced that our selection of
members can best be made in the
freshman year, which will always
create some disunity.
Our selection policy is focused
on meeting as many potential
members as possible, trying to
provide as much opportunity for
those interested to learn a little
of our system. We feel that off
campus contact should be pro
vided because our social life as
well as nearly half of our living
arrangements are, indeed, off the
campus. Therefore, we strongly
recommend that a provision be
made for some minimal, off-cam
pus, social contact winter quarter,
as well as the present provision
for five days in spring quarter in
the Living Group Selection Pro
posal. This contact could ideally
he made following the open
houses which each group con
ducts during the quarter, and
would therefore create only a mi
nor increase in disruption already
present.

selection processes. We are aware
that the freshman administration
desires a change, and we are also

aware that (he University has
demonstrated considerable inter
est in the freshmen programs
and has done a great deal to
strengthen it during the past five
years. With these two factors in
mind, we agree that some change
must and will be made, and that
we will have to compromise our
system with the others, while at
the same time maintaining as
many of our past traditions as
possible. We realize that unity
within the Wilbur and Stern sys
tems is'desirable, but we are also
convinced that our selection of
members can best be made in the
freshman year, which will always
create some disunity.
Our selection policy is focused
on meeting as many potential
members as possible, trying to
provide as much opportunity for
those interested to learn a little
of our system. We feel that off
campus contact should be pro
vided because our social life as
well as nearly half of our living
arrangements are, indeed, off the
campus. Therefore, we strongly
recommend that a provision be
made for some minimal, off-cam
pus, social contact winter quarter,
as well as the present provision
for five days in spring quarter in
the Living Group Selection Pro
posal. This contact could ideally
he made following the open
houses which each group con
ducts during the quarter, and
would therefore create only a mi
nor increase in disruption already
present.

As well, it is our understanding
that further negotiation of the
committee resulted in the restate
ment of section 3-c to be as fol
lows; “Restrictions regarding
freshman eating in the upperclass
living groups may be imposed by
the IFC, ICC, or the IHC if they
so desire. If meal invitations are
allowed, no more than five fresh
men may be invited to any given
meal in a living group.” The clubs
feel that, within the proposal as
a whole, this restriction should be
accepted.
The Stanford Eating Clubs
fully understand that the system
of selection which has been pro
posed (with the recommendations
added above) will provide each
system with difficult, and unde
sirable changes. But we also be
lieve that the existing grievances
will be considerably reduced and
therefore subscribe to its adop
tion. We hope that, if put into
practice, this proposal will indeed
confirm the ideals held within.

Sterling from the eating clubs. In

by the five-man rush committee.)
Dear President Sterling,

The Stanford Eating Clubs
have never felt obliged to have
rules defining proper conduct
during the year with regard to
“rushing,” that is, selection of
freshman members for the fol
lowing three years. This means
that the clubs have been free to
invite freshmen to meals, parties,
or any other type of function,
either on-campus or off, through
out the year. This policy has been
very satisfactory among the
clubs and generally to the Wilbur
program as well, because modera
tion has been the rule in our
rushing methods.
But one element in our system
has helped to bring forth the dis
cussions of change. We join with
the fraternities to carry out a
hectic rush week at the beginning
of spring quarter-, securing a ma
jority of membership commit
ments by Sunday of the first
week. Then following that first
week, freshmen in Wilbur and
in Stern who have joined either
a club or a fraternity are present
ed with a split allegiance and un
derstandably gravitate toward
the new group, for it is here that
they will live for the three en
suing years. The split is further
encouraged by “pledge class” ac
tivities either in the form of at
tending weekly meetings in the
clubs or complete house duties
and “pledge” requirements in the
fraternities. The Wilbur and
Stern systems are left disorgan
ized, and even worse, are pre
sented with the conditions of
housing men who no longer care
to associate with their neighbors,
at least not to any degree of earli
er associations.

Because of this disruption of
the two systems, the Wilbur
Sponsors, in 19G1, submitted a
proposal summarizing the feel
ings of two years’ dissatisfaction,
asking that rush be carried out
prior to the sophomore year. The
proposal was not acted upon pre
sumably because it was felt that
too many difficulties were inher
ent, The Wilbur leaders remained
dissatisfied and with administra
tive urging, a committee of five
was created this fall, representing
the four hall groups concerned
with rush. The work of this com
mittee resulted in a proposal
which called for a change—appar
ently a drastic change. With fra
ternity representation complete,
the Interfraternity Council re
jected the proposal as did the
Interclub Council, both groups
claiming that their traditions
would be too greatly sacrificed
for the benefit of the other two
groups.

The Eating Clubs, however, re
alize most acutely that our nega
tive opinion may not maintain
the traditional liberal policy be
cause of the growing pressure of
the other systems involved in the
selection processes. We are aware
that the freshman administration
desires a change, and we are also
