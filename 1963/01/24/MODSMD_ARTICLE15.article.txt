## Seven Reasons Why Kennedy Unwilling to Let Katanga Secede

President Kennedy is unwilling
to allow Katanga the right of
self-determination:
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a man of his word and
so in keeping with his assurance
to the editor of Izvestia that “if
any nation should choose a com
munist system, we would recog
nize and accept that." Ilehasdone
w'hat is honest and honorable—in
order to stop the secession of Ka
tanga, What Richard Weinig and
most American sympathizers of
Katanga have constantly failed
to understand is that the Katan
gese at no time have expressed
any desire to secede.
That Moise Tshomhe advocates
secession shmdd never have been
taken for granted as the willing
ness of the majority of the Ka
tangese to secede. This, President
Kennedy fully recognized since
Katanga’s secession was never
made an election issue or sub
mitted to any form of referen
dum at any time in the history of
the nation. It was an after
thought of Moise Tshomhe as a
part of his unbounded appetite to
gobble up Lumumba’s cabinet,
and it was a reprisal against the
late Lumumba’s cabinet which
was reckless enough to commit
atrocities against the Belgians
who instigated this secession.
But the President, as a good
Christian, has since realized that
two wrongs never make a right
and that the late Patrice Lumum
ba’s shortcomings should not
lead to the misery of the Congo
lese people. The President has
thus extended “unqualified” sup
port to the United Nation’s ef
forts to forcibly unite the Congo
because like the civilized Ameri
can he is, he realizes that self-de
termination should be as express
ed by the people and not as ex
pressed for them by one man
without popular consent.

• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a very good politician and
statesman who understands the
African political temperament
and has the wisdom to differenti
ate between African nationalism
and communism. He has come to
realize that Tshombe’s maniacal
equivocations and inability to
keep his word make him nothing
but a turncoat whose pro-west
ern leanings cannot be trusted

and who is more likely to change
banners than any of the other
Congolese leaders. It is surpris
ing that despite Tshombe’s fail
ures to keep his word he still
commands some following in this
country. The charge that the
Adoula government is made up
mostly of Communists is nothing
but a manifestation of an ignor
ance of the African political atti
tudes. If these so-called Commu
nists are in virtual control of the
central government, it is incon
ceivable that they would let the
so-called arch-communist Gizenga
languish in detention.
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy, like a genuine American
nationalist whose nationalism is
blended with good intelligence,
knows that Communism is an
evil which should be forced to an
unconditional surrender without
the use of force. He therefore has
realized that the secession of Ka
tanga provides the most danger
ous loopholes for Communist in
filtration of the country, conti
nent and Katanga; he knows the
rest of the continent would not
stand for 1 1 he subversive forces of
such an ideology. He is a good
politician and has come to listen
to the l ight section of public opin
ion—the African neighbors of the
Congo and not, the European vest
ed interests.
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy loves peace and understands
that there would be no peace in
the Congo unless Katanga’s se
cession was stopped. If the United
Nations did not do it, the Central
government would have contin
ued to try. and if they had failed,
the Joint African High Command
would have come to its help and
there is no telling how far the
whole engagement would pro
ceed.

• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a good student of history
and realizes that the process of
divide and rule does not make for
the best interest of the people or
for good international under
standing and cooperation. His
support of Katanga’s secession on
the grounds of self-determination
would mean the support of the
Balubas of North Katanga, who
do not want to be part of a sepa
rate Katanga—and this subdi
vision would go on ad infinitum.
Besides Richard Weinig would
not like any state of the US. for
any reason whatever to secede
even if it were the poorest state,
and so there is no reason why he
should want this in the Congo.

Divided we fall and united we
stand. He may argue that the peo
ple of the Congo differ more lin
guistically and otherwise, hut I
assure him that their long stay
under the Belgians has given
them a national character and
goals to which all can look for
ward in the same spirit and which
unite them.

• BEC AUSE JFK is a good
economist with the milk of hu
man kindness in him and he un *
derstands the untold hardships
involved when the rest of the;
Congo is cut off from the riches |
of Katanga despite Mr, VVeinig’s
claims that the rest of the Congo I
is the "largest" country in Africa, j
which is wrong population-wise.
Also its agricultural and natural
resources make his claims look ;
unscholarly. The President rea- 1
lizes that the corruption of the j
Central Government and its eco
nomic problems will better he
solved with Katanga as part of
a united Congo than without it.
It was the decision of Tshomhc
to secede which led to the chaos
involving corruption, high pay of
army officers, etc., and with the |
return of Katanga and normalcy, i
the Congo will finally settle down j
to an admirable governmental
system. Besides, the question is;
not that of economics but that of
legality and legitimacy. Tshombe I
had no legal rights to secede;
since this was not guaranteed him I
by the constitution. Besides he I
never received the mandate of his
people for such a cause. The fact
that the central government is j
financially corrupt and adminis
tratively incompetent in no way
or form confers legality to
Tshombe’s secession and (he right
thing to do is seek means of rem-;
edying the failures of the govern-1
ment of a united Congo and the |
President is aware of this.

• BECAUSE the President rea
lizes that it is his duty to protect
and promote the good name of the
United States and that this can
only be done by doing what is
right and not W'hat others with
vested interests think. Only an in
significant percentage of the na
tions of the world support Ka
tanga’s action and these have
vested interests. Besides the best
interest of the U.S. can be served
if it ensures the absence of com
munism in the Congo which can
only be done by ending Katanga’s
secession.

such an ideology. He is a good
politician and has come to listen
to the l ight section of public opin
ion—the African neighbors of the
Congo and not, the European vest
ed interests.
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy loves peace and understands
that there would be no peace in
the Congo unless Katanga’s se
cession was stopped. If the United
Nations did not do it, the Central
government would have contin
ued to try. and if they had failed,
the Joint African High Command
would have come to its help and
there is no telling how far the
whole engagement would pro
ceed.

• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a good student of history
and realizes that the process of
divide and rule does not make for
the best interest of the people or
for good international under
standing and cooperation. His
support of Katanga’s secession on
the grounds of self-determination
would mean the support of the
Balubas of North Katanga, who
do not want to be part of a sepa
rate Katanga—and this subdi
vision would go on ad infinitum.
Besides Richard Weinig would
not like any state of the US. for
any reason whatever to secede
even if it were the poorest state,
and so there is no reason why he
should want this in the Congo.

Divided we fall and united we
stand. He may argue that the peo
ple of the Congo differ more lin
guistically and otherwise, hut I
assure him that their long stay
under the Belgians has given
them a national character and
goals to which all can look for
ward in the same spirit and which
unite them.

• BEC AUSE JFK is a good
economist with the milk of hu
man kindness in him and he un *
derstands the untold hardships
involved when the rest of the;
Congo is cut off from the riches |
of Katanga despite Mr, VVeinig’s
claims that the rest of the Congo I
is the "largest" country in Africa, j
which is wrong population-wise.
Also its agricultural and natural
resources make his claims look ;
unscholarly. The President rea- 1
lizes that the corruption of the j
Central Government and its eco
nomic problems will better he
solved with Katanga as part of
a united Congo than without it.
It was the decision of Tshomhc
to secede which led to the chaos
involving corruption, high pay of
army officers, etc., and with the |
return of Katanga and normalcy, i
the Congo will finally settle down j
to an admirable governmental
system. Besides, the question is;
not that of economics but that of
legality and legitimacy. Tshombe I
had no legal rights to secede;
since this was not guaranteed him I
by the constitution. Besides he I
never received the mandate of his
people for such a cause. The fact
that the central government is j
financially corrupt and adminis
tratively incompetent in no way
or form confers legality to
Tshombe’s secession and (he right
thing to do is seek means of rem-;
edying the failures of the govern-1
ment of a united Congo and the |
President is aware of this.

• BECAUSE the President rea
lizes that it is his duty to protect
and promote the good name of the
United States and that this can
only be done by doing what is
right and not W'hat others with
vested interests think. Only an in
significant percentage of the na
tions of the world support Ka
tanga’s action and these have
vested interests. Besides the best
interest of the U.S. can be served
if it ensures the absence of com
munism in the Congo which can
only be done by ending Katanga’s
secession.

President Kennedy is unwilling
to allow Katanga the right of
self-determination:
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a man of his word and
so in keeping with his assurance
to the editor of Izvestia that “if
any nation should choose a com
munist system, we would recog
nize and accept that." Ilehasdone
w'hat is honest and honorable—in
order to stop the secession of Ka
tanga, What Richard Weinig and
most American sympathizers of
Katanga have constantly failed
to understand is that the Katan
gese at no time have expressed
any desire to secede.
That Moise Tshomhe advocates
secession shmdd never have been
taken for granted as the willing
ness of the majority of the Ka
tangese to secede. This, President
Kennedy fully recognized since
Katanga’s secession was never
made an election issue or sub
mitted to any form of referen
dum at any time in the history of
the nation. It was an after
thought of Moise Tshomhe as a
part of his unbounded appetite to
gobble up Lumumba’s cabinet,
and it was a reprisal against the
late Lumumba’s cabinet which
was reckless enough to commit
atrocities against the Belgians
who instigated this secession.
But the President, as a good
Christian, has since realized that
two wrongs never make a right
and that the late Patrice Lumum
ba’s shortcomings should not
lead to the misery of the Congo
lese people. The President has
thus extended “unqualified” sup
port to the United Nation’s ef
forts to forcibly unite the Congo
because like the civilized Ameri
can he is, he realizes that self-de
termination should be as express
ed by the people and not as ex
pressed for them by one man
without popular consent.

• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a very good politician and
statesman who understands the
African political temperament
and has the wisdom to differenti
ate between African nationalism
and communism. He has come to
realize that Tshombe’s maniacal
equivocations and inability to
keep his word make him nothing
but a turncoat whose pro-west
ern leanings cannot be trusted

and who is more likely to change
banners than any of the other
Congolese leaders. It is surpris
ing that despite Tshombe’s fail
ures to keep his word he still
commands some following in this
country. The charge that the
Adoula government is made up
mostly of Communists is nothing
but a manifestation of an ignor
ance of the African political atti
tudes. If these so-called Commu
nists are in virtual control of the
central government, it is incon
ceivable that they would let the
so-called arch-communist Gizenga
languish in detention.
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy, like a genuine American
nationalist whose nationalism is
blended with good intelligence,
knows that Communism is an
evil which should be forced to an
unconditional surrender without
the use of force. He therefore has
realized that the secession of Ka
tanga provides the most danger
ous loopholes for Communist in
filtration of the country, conti
nent and Katanga; he knows the
rest of the continent would not
stand for 1 1 he subversive forces of

President Kennedy is unwilling
to allow Katanga the right of
self-determination:
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a man of his word and
so in keeping with his assurance
to the editor of Izvestia that “if
any nation should choose a com
munist system, we would recog
nize and accept that." Ilehasdone
w'hat is honest and honorable—in
order to stop the secession of Ka
tanga, What Richard Weinig and
most American sympathizers of
Katanga have constantly failed
to understand is that the Katan
gese at no time have expressed
any desire to secede.
That Moise Tshomhe advocates
secession shmdd never have been
taken for granted as the willing
ness of the majority of the Ka
tangese to secede. This, President
Kennedy fully recognized since
Katanga’s secession was never
made an election issue or sub
mitted to any form of referen
dum at any time in the history of
the nation. It was an after
thought of Moise Tshomhe as a
part of his unbounded appetite to
gobble up Lumumba’s cabinet,
and it was a reprisal against the
late Lumumba’s cabinet which
was reckless enough to commit
atrocities against the Belgians
who instigated this secession.
But the President, as a good
Christian, has since realized that
two wrongs never make a right
and that the late Patrice Lumum
ba’s shortcomings should not
lead to the misery of the Congo
lese people. The President has
thus extended “unqualified” sup
port to the United Nation’s ef
forts to forcibly unite the Congo
because like the civilized Ameri
can he is, he realizes that self-de
termination should be as express
ed by the people and not as ex
pressed for them by one man
without popular consent.

• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a very good politician and
statesman who understands the
African political temperament
and has the wisdom to differenti
ate between African nationalism
and communism. He has come to
realize that Tshombe’s maniacal
equivocations and inability to
keep his word make him nothing
but a turncoat whose pro-west
ern leanings cannot be trusted

and who is more likely to change
banners than any of the other
Congolese leaders. It is surpris
ing that despite Tshombe’s fail
ures to keep his word he still
commands some following in this
country. The charge that the
Adoula government is made up
mostly of Communists is nothing
but a manifestation of an ignor
ance of the African political atti
tudes. If these so-called Commu
nists are in virtual control of the
central government, it is incon
ceivable that they would let the
so-called arch-communist Gizenga
languish in detention.
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy, like a genuine American
nationalist whose nationalism is
blended with good intelligence,
knows that Communism is an
evil which should be forced to an
unconditional surrender without
the use of force. He therefore has
realized that the secession of Ka
tanga provides the most danger
ous loopholes for Communist in
filtration of the country, conti
nent and Katanga; he knows the
rest of the continent would not
stand for 1 1 he subversive forces of
such an ideology. He is a good
politician and has come to listen
to the l ight section of public opin
ion—the African neighbors of the
Congo and not, the European vest
ed interests.
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy loves peace and understands
that there would be no peace in
the Congo unless Katanga’s se
cession was stopped. If the United
Nations did not do it, the Central
government would have contin
ued to try. and if they had failed,
the Joint African High Command
would have come to its help and
there is no telling how far the
whole engagement would pro
ceed.

• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a good student of history
and realizes that the process of
divide and rule does not make for
the best interest of the people or
for good international under
standing and cooperation. His
support of Katanga’s secession on
the grounds of self-determination
would mean the support of the
Balubas of North Katanga, who
do not want to be part of a sepa
rate Katanga—and this subdi
vision would go on ad infinitum.
Besides Richard Weinig would
not like any state of the US. for
any reason whatever to secede
even if it were the poorest state,
and so there is no reason why he
should want this in the Congo.

Divided we fall and united we
stand. He may argue that the peo
ple of the Congo differ more lin
guistically and otherwise, hut I
assure him that their long stay
under the Belgians has given
them a national character and
goals to which all can look for
ward in the same spirit and which
unite them.

• BEC AUSE JFK is a good
economist with the milk of hu
man kindness in him and he un *
derstands the untold hardships
involved when the rest of the;
Congo is cut off from the riches |
of Katanga despite Mr, VVeinig’s
claims that the rest of the Congo I
is the "largest" country in Africa, j
which is wrong population-wise.
Also its agricultural and natural
resources make his claims look ;
unscholarly. The President rea- 1
lizes that the corruption of the j
Central Government and its eco
nomic problems will better he
solved with Katanga as part of
a united Congo than without it.
It was the decision of Tshomhc
to secede which led to the chaos
involving corruption, high pay of
army officers, etc., and with the |
return of Katanga and normalcy, i
the Congo will finally settle down j
to an admirable governmental
system. Besides, the question is;
not that of economics but that of
legality and legitimacy. Tshombe I
had no legal rights to secede;
since this was not guaranteed him I
by the constitution. Besides he I
never received the mandate of his
people for such a cause. The fact
that the central government is j
financially corrupt and adminis
tratively incompetent in no way
or form confers legality to
Tshombe’s secession and (he right
thing to do is seek means of rem-;
edying the failures of the govern-1
ment of a united Congo and the |
President is aware of this.

• BECAUSE the President rea
lizes that it is his duty to protect
and promote the good name of the
United States and that this can
only be done by doing what is

tanga provides the most danger
ous loopholes for Communist in
filtration of the country, conti
nent and Katanga; he knows the
rest of the continent would not
stand for 1 1 he subversive forces of
such an ideology. He is a good
politician and has come to listen
to the l ight section of public opin
ion—the African neighbors of the
Congo and not, the European vest
ed interests.
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy loves peace and understands
that there would be no peace in
the Congo unless Katanga’s se
cession was stopped. If the United
Nations did not do it, the Central
government would have contin
ued to try. and if they had failed,
the Joint African High Command
would have come to its help and
there is no telling how far the
whole engagement would pro
ceed.

• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a good student of history
and realizes that the process of
divide and rule does not make for
the best interest of the people or
for good international under
standing and cooperation. His
support of Katanga’s secession on
the grounds of self-determination
would mean the support of the
Balubas of North Katanga, who
do not want to be part of a sepa
rate Katanga—and this subdi
vision would go on ad infinitum.
Besides Richard Weinig would
not like any state of the US. for
any reason whatever to secede
even if it were the poorest state,
and so there is no reason why he
should want this in the Congo.

Divided we fall and united we
stand. He may argue that the peo
ple of the Congo differ more lin
guistically and otherwise, hut I
assure him that their long stay
under the Belgians has given
them a national character and
goals to which all can look for
ward in the same spirit and which
unite them.

• BEC AUSE JFK is a good
economist with the milk of hu
man kindness in him and he un *
derstands the untold hardships
involved when the rest of the;
Congo is cut off from the riches |
of Katanga despite Mr, VVeinig’s
claims that the rest of the Congo I
is the "largest" country in Africa, j
which is wrong population-wise.
Also its agricultural and natural
resources make his claims look ;
unscholarly. The President rea- 1
lizes that the corruption of the j
Central Government and its eco
nomic problems will better he
solved with Katanga as part of
a united Congo than without it.
It was the decision of Tshomhc
to secede which led to the chaos
involving corruption, high pay of
army officers, etc., and with the |
return of Katanga and normalcy, i
the Congo will finally settle down j
to an admirable governmental
system. Besides, the question is;
not that of economics but that of
legality and legitimacy. Tshombe I
had no legal rights to secede;
since this was not guaranteed him I
by the constitution. Besides he I
never received the mandate of his
people for such a cause. The fact
that the central government is j
financially corrupt and adminis
tratively incompetent in no way
or form confers legality to
Tshombe’s secession and (he right
thing to do is seek means of rem-;
edying the failures of the govern-1
ment of a united Congo and the |
President is aware of this.

• BECAUSE the President rea
lizes that it is his duty to protect
and promote the good name of the
United States and that this can
only be done by doing what is
right and not W'hat others with
vested interests think. Only an in
significant percentage of the na
tions of the world support Ka
tanga’s action and these have
vested interests. Besides the best
interest of the U.S. can be served
if it ensures the absence of com
munism in the Congo which can
only be done by ending Katanga’s
secession.

President Kennedy is unwilling
to allow Katanga the right of
self-determination:
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a man of his word and
so in keeping with his assurance
to the editor of Izvestia that “if
any nation should choose a com
munist system, we would recog
nize and accept that." Ilehasdone
w'hat is honest and honorable—in
order to stop the secession of Ka
tanga, What Richard Weinig and
most American sympathizers of
Katanga have constantly failed
to understand is that the Katan
gese at no time have expressed
any desire to secede.
That Moise Tshomhe advocates
secession shmdd never have been
taken for granted as the willing
ness of the majority of the Ka
tangese to secede. This, President
Kennedy fully recognized since
Katanga’s secession was never
made an election issue or sub
mitted to any form of referen
dum at any time in the history of
the nation. It was an after
thought of Moise Tshomhe as a
part of his unbounded appetite to
gobble up Lumumba’s cabinet,
and it was a reprisal against the
late Lumumba’s cabinet which
was reckless enough to commit
atrocities against the Belgians
who instigated this secession.
But the President, as a good
Christian, has since realized that
two wrongs never make a right
and that the late Patrice Lumum
ba’s shortcomings should not
lead to the misery of the Congo
lese people. The President has
thus extended “unqualified” sup
port to the United Nation’s ef
forts to forcibly unite the Congo
because like the civilized Ameri
can he is, he realizes that self-de
termination should be as express
ed by the people and not as ex
pressed for them by one man
without popular consent.

• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy is a very good politician and
statesman who understands the
African political temperament
and has the wisdom to differenti
ate between African nationalism
and communism. He has come to
realize that Tshombe’s maniacal
equivocations and inability to
keep his word make him nothing
but a turncoat whose pro-west
ern leanings cannot be trusted

and who is more likely to change
banners than any of the other
Congolese leaders. It is surpris
ing that despite Tshombe’s fail
ures to keep his word he still
commands some following in this
country. The charge that the
Adoula government is made up
mostly of Communists is nothing
but a manifestation of an ignor
ance of the African political atti
tudes. If these so-called Commu
nists are in virtual control of the
central government, it is incon
ceivable that they would let the
so-called arch-communist Gizenga
languish in detention.
• BECAUSE President Ken
nedy, like a genuine American
nationalist whose nationalism is
blended with good intelligence,
knows that Communism is an
evil which should be forced to an
unconditional surrender without
the use of force. He therefore has
realized that the secession of Ka
tanga provides the most danger
ous loopholes for Communist in
filtration of the country, conti
nent and Katanga; he knows the
rest of the continent would not
