# New Japanese Nationalism Based on Peace, Disarmament
## 
### MAYNARD J. TOLL, Jr. ASSU Exchange Student to Keio University, 1961-62 
In the summer of 1960 Americans were generally surprised, em
barrassed, and frankly concerned when thousands of Japanese
students protested in the streets of Tokyo against ratification of
the new security treaty which would continue to allow American
military bases on Japanese soil. The riots were in part a protest

against the methods of the Kishr
government which subsequent to
the riots went out of business.
But they were also clear evidence
of a rising belief among younger
Japanese that there is a
especially in Asia, for a truly in
dependent Japan.

sues, Japan is one nation which
is nearly 100 per cent for disarm
ament, the sooner the better.

Problems of world peace, there
fore, have become a basis, for a
new 7 kind of nationalism in Japan.
Even students who have little or
no recollection of the war years
regard themselves as belonging
to the only race which has truly
known the horrors of war, especi
ally of atomic attack. Enlightened
and transfigured by their com
mon misfortune, many young
Japanese feel they have been
raised to new spiritual heights,
and must now altruistically en
deavor to help those people, gen
erally speaking East and West,
who suffer from moral blindness.

At the time of (he riots, there
was a tendency on the part of the
American press to blame the
whole thing on an active but rel
atively unimportant communist
led student group, the Zengaku
ren. There is only one thing
wrong with this idea. The word
“zengakuren” means “all-student
federation,” and in fact automati
cally includes as its members the
total student bodies of nearly
every university in Japan. It is
true that the loaders of the Zon
gakuren have tended to be pro
communist, and this was particu
larly true at the time of the 1960
riots. Even now, there is one fac
tion in the Zengakuren which
is so far to the left that even the
Japan Communist Party has pub
licly denounced it.

Philosophically, this missionary
fervor may seem ludicrous. But
politically it has been very useful
to the JSP (Japan Socialist Par
ty) and will continue to be useful
to any political parly that wishes
to capitalize on it. The intelligent
sia of the country is behind it,
and the universities are perpetu
ating it. It is no wonder that Am
bassador Reischauer is forecast
ing a dark future in Japanese-
American relations. We have been
guests too long in Japan, and the
hosts are getting irritated.
In one respect, this may seem
like rude ingratitude on the part
of the hosts. After all, America
has poured much money into Ja
pan since the war. “True,” replies
one Zengakuren friend of mine,
‘but what does your generosity
mean when it is bound up with
patronizing superiority?”

But if the leadership of the
Zengakuren has leaned to the
left, the main body of Japanese
students are not really too far
behind. In many ways, however,
it is clear that this tendency is
more an effort to dissociate Ja
pan from the American guardian
angel than to create a new de
pendency on a traditional enemy,
Russia. In other words, most
Japanese students are leaning left
only because that is the direction
toward neutralism.

Why neutralism? In short, a
policy of neutralism would make
Japan the economic leader of all
the neutrals and give her a po
sition of influence in the world
from which she would better be
able to carry out her post-war
mission of spokesman for world
peace.

I took offense to this attitude
at the time and told him so. But
I think it is probably true. Psy
chological isolationism goes hand
in hand with political isolation
ism, and our present psychologi
cal problems in Asia stem from
the fact that Americans still ba
sically believe in Christian superi
ority, white supremacy, and one
nation under God.

Insofar as Japanese students
envisage the role of Japan as a
leader for peace, they echo the
sentiments of the entire nation -

Our association with Japan
since the war has been invalu
able in getting Americans inter
ested in Asia and less provincial
about it. We cannot afford to lose
this association. Japan must con
tinue to be a bridge, even if she
chooses to leave the western
camp in favor of the neutrals.

that after the bitter experience of
war, and especially because of the
devastation of Hiroshima and Na
gasaki, Japan must be a country
dedicated to peace in a world
hitherto committed to war. In
spite of the subtleties of the is-
