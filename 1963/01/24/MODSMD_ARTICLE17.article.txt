## All Clowns in 3 Rounds,' Quoth Clay as He Prepares for Powell 
### 
PITTSBURGH (UPD Cassius
Clay lays his high ranking on the
line tonight in a 10-round bout
with former professional football
player Charlie Powell who has j
vowed to "make it big’’ in boxing
on his second chance.
The two combatants, who have
exchanged a flurry of not-so-com
plimentary remarks in the past
five days, went into seclusion
last night.
For Clay, the bout is of ex
treme importance since a loss
could cost him his rating as the
third ranking contender for the
heavyweight crown held by cham
pion Sonny Liston.
For Powell, a victory would
boost him into the prominence he
held after kayoing Nino Valdez,

then the number two ranked con
tender, in 1958.
Both Clay and Powell have play
ed to standing-room-only audi
ences while training in a down
town hotel. And both have issued
predictions of victory, Clay in a
now well-known poetic vein and
Powell in an almost perfunctory
attitude.
Powell figures to have a five
to 10 pound advantage when they
enter the ring. He expects to scale
210. Clay will probably go about
202.
Both scored victories in their
last outings, Powell decisioning
Dave Furch in 10 rounds and
Clay knocking out Archie Moore
in four. And both figure tonight’s
meeting will end in a kayo. “If
anybody goes, it will be Clay,”
Powell said. “All I need is one
punch.”
"All clowns in three rounds,”
is the way Cassius puts it.
