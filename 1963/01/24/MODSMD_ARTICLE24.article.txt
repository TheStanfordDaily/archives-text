# Outstanding Americans To Get New IIR Award
## 
### 
This year the HR will begin
presenting an award to ‘‘that
American who, during the past
year, has contributed most to in
ternational understanding and
peace.”,
The award, which will probably
be an annual event, was created
in an effort to further the stu
dents’ awareness of international
affairs and personalities. It will
serve to give recognition to those
people involved in international
affairs who in the past have been
unrecognized in any capacity at
Stanford University.

HR hopes thal the recipients of
the award will come to Stanford
to receive it, and thus center the
student body's attention on inter
national issues.
Any Stanford student may
make a nomination for this
award and either mail it or sub
mit it in person to the HR Office
in Tresidder Union.
A nomination will not be con
sidered, however, unless it has
been signed by at least ten other
students. This is to insure careful
consideration as well as worthy
nominations. Nominations will be
received through Monday, Jan.
28, when a committee will review
nominations and select the final
candidate.
Those on the committee of se
lection will bo Armin Rosen
cranz, ASSU President; Jan Dc-
Baksey, Political Union Presi
dent; John Steinbruner, Head
Wilbur Sponsor; Michael
O’Flynn, President of the I Club;
Dan Schwartz, Staff Editor of the
Stanford Daily; Priscilla Ferge
son, ASSU Vice-President; and
W. Scott Thompson, HR Presi
dent.
