# Little LASSU Meets Tonight for Last Time
## 
### 
Tonight the little LASSU will
meet for the last time. Next week
its regular members, who will
continue to hold their seats, will
be joined by 120 limited-constitu
ency representatives.
Armin Rosencranz, ASSU Pres
ident, will present a special re
port on social action to LASSU.
“The report will be disagreed
with by virtually everyone in the
Administration,” he said.
LASSU will continue action on
the KPFA affair, begun last
week. At that time LASSU repre
sentatives asked a delay in order
to find out (heir constituents’
views. Since then, Rosencranz has
written Senator Dodd of the Sen
ate Internal Securities subcom
mittee and Chairman Minow of
the FCC to “express grave con
cern" over harassment of KPFA,
and a number of grad students
have begun collecting a KPFA
legal defense fund.
Other old business is discussion
of “third person responsibility.”
This issue appeared in the recent
Chaparral, which had “four pro
fessors” caption saying that Ju
das was probably just exorcising
his “third person responsibility.”

New business includes the
WUS and Cardinals drives pro
gram. appointment of a commit
tee to look into denial of rights
to students in foreign countries,
| the Rinconada flicks, and whether
! or not to pay the $250 required
! foe to NSA.
