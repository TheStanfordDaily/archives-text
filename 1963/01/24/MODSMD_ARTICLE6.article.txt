# 'Groundwork Laid For Fall Session Of Vatican II'

### 
Archbishop Joseph T. McGuck
en of San Francisco, in the first
public statement by a high rank
ing prelate of the Roman Catho
lic Church about the Ecumenical
Council, last night said that the
bishops at Rome had “plowed the
field and planted the seeds, but
the harvest will have to wait till
Fall.”

Addressing the delighted audi
ence which crowded into Cubber
ley Auditorium, the Archbishop
set out to place the Vatican II
Council in perspective, centering
his talk on the aims and purposes
of the Council.
“OTHER COUNCILS were c all
ed because of heresy, disunity, or
the need for reform,” said the
Archbishop, “but Vatican II was
called because of another kind of
crisis—the crisis of the modern
age.”
“Man is thinking and speaking
in a new language, while religious
truth is still being presented to
him in now outmoded terms,” he
asserted. The crisis is “not so
much a change in religious truth,
but a need to express it in mod
ern terms and apply it to modern
needs.”
Following "the most thorough
preparation of any Council in his
tory” and amid an atmosphere of
cordiality, charity, and IBM ma
chines, the main purpose of Vati
can II is to bring the Church up
to date,” said the Archbishop.
STATING SOME particulars of
the Council’s first session, the
Archbishop stated the case for
delatinizing the vernacular. “A
Latin vernacular has served the
unity of the Church, but the part
of the mass which is directed to
ward the people for their under
standing should bo in a language
that the people can understand.”
According to the Archbishop,
members of the Council generally
agreed that authority in matters
of vernacular would be given to
regional hierarchies in order that
those more keenly aware of local
needs might decide what would
be the best policy for their par
ticular countries.
IN MATTERS OF form and
ceremony in general, said the
Archbishop, “a groat decentrali
zation of authority is needed.

Ho concluded with the hope
that the Council might fulfill the
wish of Pope John that “we may
be able to renew the spirit of the
Church ... as it came from the
lips of Jesus.”
