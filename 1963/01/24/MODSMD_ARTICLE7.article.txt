# SU Phones Carry 5,000 Calls Daily
## 
### SUE LINEHAN 
When a Stanford student calls an extension of
DA 1-2300 he utilizes a complicated network of
phone lines and extensions that carries about
5,000 calls a day. The main University switchboard,
which five years ago moved into new buildings
across Panama Street from the Old Union, has
been operating as an interdepartmental system
since 1910.
Stanford’s first telephone was a pay phone in
stalled in the Post Office in 1893. Two years later
it was removed, and the University remained
phoneless until 1902. when the Business Office
| moved from San Francisco to the campus. The
j Registrar’s office obtained a phono in 1907. and
| the next year President David Starr Jordan finally
got one of his own.
Today the Stanford switchboard has 1.250 ex
| tension lines. Seven operators, headed by Chief
j Operator Edna Brookey, can man the board at one
1 lime. The staff maintains service 24 hours a day,
| seven days a week; it consists of ten full time
j operators, two part-time employees working on
| weekends, and student help in the evenings and on
week-ends and holidays. Right now- all the student
I helpers are men, but this is simply because no
| women have applied.
THE MAIN SWITCHBOARD is connected to
' the outside world by a variety of trunk lines.
jThere are 17 “0-level” trunks, which means that
j IT people can be calling the operator at once be-|
fore there is a busy signal. For long-distance calls!
' there are 35 trunks which carry both incoming!
land outgoing calls, and an additional 14 which!

handle only oulgoing calls.
All long-distance calls from a University ex
tension must go through the operator there is no
direct dialing from a University phone. In addition
there are three “foreign exchange” lines which go
directly to San Francisco without the usual long
distance procedure.
For local calls there are 35 “9-level” trunks;
“9” is the number dialed to get the dial tone for a
local call.
THERE ARE MANY other campus switch
boards besides DA 1-2300; these include the Hos
pital, the Stanford Electronics Labs, and the Han
sen Labs. The dormitories and row houses also
have their own switchboards and numbers; how
ever, some residences haw house phones with a
University extension number, paid for out of the
house dues. Also, a student may have an extension
in his room, with the approval of the house or
dorm director; he then assumes responsibility for
all calls charged to that phone.
The biggest plan in the future of the University
switchboard is the Centrex "in-dialing” system.
Under this plan each student will have a dial
phone in his room, so that he can reach anyone on
campus, even the person in the next room. This
system, which would eliminate dorm switchboards
and the buzzers which are used in most residences,
should be in effect in two to four years.
All campus phones (except the pay phones) are
rented by Stanford from Pacific Telephone, part of
I the Bell Telephone Company. However, since Stan
ford operates its own switchboard, all charges for
calls, damage, etc., are handled by the University
instead of the Telephone Company.

Under this plan each student will have a dial
phone in his room, so that he can reach anyone on
campus, even the person in the next room. This
system, which would eliminate dorm switchboards
and the buzzers which are used in most residences,
should be in effect in two to four years.
All campus phones (except the pay phones) are
rented by Stanford from Pacific Telephone, part of
I the Bell Telephone Company. However, since Stan
ford operates its own switchboard, all charges for
calls, damage, etc., are handled by the University
instead of the Telephone Company.
When a Stanford student calls an extension of
DA 1-2300 he utilizes a complicated network of
phone lines and extensions that carries about
5,000 calls a day. The main University switchboard,
which five years ago moved into new buildings
across Panama Street from the Old Union, has
been operating as an interdepartmental system
since 1910.
Stanford’s first telephone was a pay phone in
stalled in the Post Office in 1893. Two years later
it was removed, and the University remained
phoneless until 1902. when the Business Office
| moved from San Francisco to the campus. The
j Registrar’s office obtained a phono in 1907. and
| the next year President David Starr Jordan finally
got one of his own.
Today the Stanford switchboard has 1.250 ex
| tension lines. Seven operators, headed by Chief
j Operator Edna Brookey, can man the board at one
1 lime. The staff maintains service 24 hours a day,
| seven days a week; it consists of ten full time
j operators, two part-time employees working on
| weekends, and student help in the evenings and on
week-ends and holidays. Right now- all the student
I helpers are men, but this is simply because no
| women have applied.
THE MAIN SWITCHBOARD is connected to
' the outside world by a variety of trunk lines.
jThere are 17 “0-level” trunks, which means that
j IT people can be calling the operator at once be-|
fore there is a busy signal. For long-distance calls!
' there are 35 trunks which carry both incoming!
land outgoing calls, and an additional 14 which!

handle only oulgoing calls.
All long-distance calls from a University ex
tension must go through the operator there is no
direct dialing from a University phone. In addition
there are three “foreign exchange” lines which go
directly to San Francisco without the usual long
distance procedure.
For local calls there are 35 “9-level” trunks;
“9” is the number dialed to get the dial tone for a
local call.
THERE ARE MANY other campus switch
boards besides DA 1-2300; these include the Hos
pital, the Stanford Electronics Labs, and the Han
sen Labs. The dormitories and row houses also
have their own switchboards and numbers; how
ever, some residences haw house phones with a
University extension number, paid for out of the
house dues. Also, a student may have an extension
in his room, with the approval of the house or
dorm director; he then assumes responsibility for
all calls charged to that phone.
The biggest plan in the future of the University
switchboard is the Centrex "in-dialing” system.
