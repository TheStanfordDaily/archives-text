# Approval of 7-Week Rush Extension Expected in 2 Days, Larimer Says
## 
### 
The proposal to extend fresh
man rush to the seventh week of
spring quarter is “very likely” to
he approved, Acting Dean of
Men David Larimer reported yes
terday. He said the official de
cision is expected from the Presi
dent’s office within two days.
Larimer made the announce
ment before a meeting of gradu
ate resident assistants of frater
nities. The proposed rush revis
ions will become effective as soon
as the announcement is made, he
said.

As freshmen troop out to open
houses at fraternities again to
night much confusion exists as to
the status of rush regulations.
Fraternities were cautioned at
Monday’s meeting of the Inter-
Fraternity Council that the pro
posed open contact on campus be
tween freshmen and fraternity
members Winter Quarter (meals
excepted) is not in effect until
President Sterling approves the
revisions in rush.

WINTER QUARTER open
houses which began Tuesday,
were created by the tentative re
vision. It was assumed that since
the open houses were permitted,
on-campus open contact would

also begin, as it was felt to be a
concomitant part of the rush
revision and was to start at the
same time winter open houses be
gan.

However, Larimer explained,
winter open houses were author
ized because all groups concerned
with the proposal fraternities,
Stern men, Eating Club men,
freshmen sponsors, and faculty
representatives approve of
them. In other words, these open
houses were certain to be ap
proved by Sterling. Open contact,
on the other hand, has been an
object of controversy and must
await official approval, Larimer
said.

THE EXPECTED ruling will
prohibit freshmen pledging until
the seventh week of spring quar
ter, although “informal commit
ments” may be made. Both IFC
and the Inter-Club Council oppose
this change.

To add still more confusion to
the issue on Tuesday the Inter-
Fraternity Board -composed of
students and faculty—expressed
its approval of the seven-week
extension.

A joint Living Group Commit
tee, representing all interested

parties, originally drafted the con
troversial proposal.
ACCORDING to Larimer the
purpose of extending rush is to
relax an activity that is now very
constrained. Dean of Freshmen
Men William Clark has said the
proposal is intended to keep those
freshmen who don’t join fraterni
ties from getting hurt. He con
tends that freshmen men unable
to get a bid are upset at seeing
their friends in the dorm sucked
into fraternity activities as soon
as spring quarter begins.
On Monday night IFC President
Ed Eschbach asked that group,
which had first approved, then
condemned the proposed exten
sion, to restate its views. Instead,
the delegates adjourned the meet
ing, thereby reaffirming IFC’s
most recent stand—opposition to
any change in rushing spring
quarter.
