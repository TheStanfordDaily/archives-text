# Stern Hall Votes Unanimously To Form Inter House Council
## 
### 
The members of the eight Stern Houses voted last night to
ratify an Inter House Constitution and thus form the Inter House
Council.
The Constitution provides for a forum of the eight independent
house presidents, the LASSU representatives from the houses

and the Stern LASSU representa -
tives at large.
The Constitution also provides
for an IHC president elected at
large by the 600 members of the
houses. The Constitution defines
that the president will appoint,
“subject to the approval of the
council all committees and repre
sentatives of the council; and is
official representative of the In
ter House Council.”
The Stern Houses have been in
tiie past organized into Presi
dents' Council, chaired by one of
the house presidents chosen by
the members of the council.
"A popularly elected presi
dent,” Patrick Shue, the chair
man of the Presidents’ Council,
told The Daily, “would be con
sidered by others to be much
more representative of the opin
ions held in Stern than the chair
man has been.”
“UNTIL NOW,” John Moore,
Director of the Stern Houses,
wrote in an informal introduc
tion to the constitution “the ad
ministration saw no organized
political life in the houses, and,
therefore, when it sought student
opinion or wished to speak with
recognized student-leaders, it by
passed any Stern representation
and turned instead to those stu
dent leaders who clearly and of
ficially represented other large
student groups. As a result, the
Stern Houses were consistently
left out of these important coun

ells,”
The IHC Constitution also pro
vides for the allocation of funds
from each member house accord
ing to the size of its member
ship. The IHC will determine, by
budget, how much each man will
be assessed for the next quarter.
TIIL FUNDS will be used to
"sponsor programs and functions
benefiting the member houses
and the entire university com
munity. . .
Shue told The Daily: "The
council has the resources neces
sary to carry out cultural pro
grams, such as the Guest-in-Resi
dence, which would be prohibi
tively expensive for an individual
house to undertake. Under the
council, however, the expense to
the individual man would be neg
ligible.”
The constitution provides for
a formal structure to the house
council, where a completely in
formal and nebulous structure
existed before, Shue said.
“UNLIKE THE Inter Fraterni
ty and Inter Club Councils . . .
the Inter House Council will
serve no regulative function,”
Shue accentuated. “It has been
established to provide a sounding
board for the voice of the inde
pendent element on this campus.”
