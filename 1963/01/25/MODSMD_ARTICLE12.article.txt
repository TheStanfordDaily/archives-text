WASHINGTON President Kennedy expressed confidence at a
news conference yesterday that French President Charles de Gaulle
would continue to give strong support to the NATO alliance. But
he also accepted the fact that de Gaulle intends to push vigorously
his plan for an independent nuclear force.
Kennedy opened his 33-minute session with newsmen with a
special statement on allied unity. Then he covered a wide range of
subjects during which he fully backed Atty. Gen. Robert F. Ken
nedy's recent statements on the Cuban crisis, plugged for his tax
program, and voiced hope Negro James Meredith would return to
the University of Mississippi.
He said the resources needed for defense against “the constant
threat of the Communist advance” are concentrated overwhelmingly
in the Atlantic alliance.
The President wholeheartedly supported Atty. Gen. Kennedy’s
statement that no U.S. air cover ever was planned for the abortive
1061 Cuban invasion. He said he thought members of the Cuban
brigade who claim there was, had the wrong impression about
planes which might have been available.
As for Meredith, the President said he would be "sorry” if the
Negro student decides not to return to the University of Mississippi
next semester. If Meredith should leave, he said, “it would be a
loss not only to Mr. Meredith but also to the University of Missis
sippi.”

and formerly president of the University of South Carolina, said the
entrance of Negro Harvey Gantt to Clemson College Monday would
be accomplished “without violence, without dishonor and with proper
regard for the good name of our state and her people.”
