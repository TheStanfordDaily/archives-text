‘At the request of the President of the University, I am
writing to inform you (ASSU President Annin Rosencranz) that
pending the policy review and until further notice, Stanford stu
dent organizations may not take public stands on issues affecting
affairs beyond the Stanford campus without prior University
approval. This provision applies also to officers of Stanford stu
dent organizations in their own official capacities, although it does
not limit the right of any student as an individual to participate in
undertakings which are not identified with the University.”
—H. Donald Winbigler
Dean of Students
“A great university cannot long afford to discourage its stu
dents from involvement in, and concern for, the non-academic
world. Individually or collectively, students can speak only for
themselves, not for the University; to deny students the right of
self-expression because the public might erroneously feel that
they are speaking for the University as a whole, is to sacrifice the
stimulation of the mind to the preservation of the image.”

Executive Assistant to ASSU President Armin Rosencranz
In eager retreat to the good old days of the nineteenth century,
the University has prohibited the Associated Students from draft
ing public resolutions in support of their principles. Not only has
the University retreated to the comfort of Leland Stanford’s Grant,
it has also chosen to interpret the will with a paranoid vengeance.
With delusions, at once of persecution and greatness, the Univer
(sity has equated the ASSU with the University so that students
are bound by the Founding Grant’s prohibition against the Uni
versity’s participation in partisan political activity. By forbidding
L students the right to “take public stands on issues affecting affairs
beyond the Stanford campus without prior University approval,”
the University has gone far beyond the Founding Grant. The
University has erred on three points: I) it has mistaken the words
“partisan and “public”; 2) it has mistaken expression for “activ
ity, 3) it has equated “students” with the University administra
tion—for the first time in the history of student-administration re
lations. The reason for these interpretations is easy to find: the
University is afraid of people who will themselves mistake “par
tisan’’ and “public,” “expression” and “activity,” and “students” and
“University.” More importantly, the University fears the reper
cussions on its fund-raising campaign if influential, prospective
donors mistakenly think that the University is espousing a cause
anathema to the donors, themselves. In short, the stimulation of
the mind is being sacrificed to the preservation of the image. In
its very great efforts to raise enough money to become the Har
vard of the West, the University has set forth a policy more appro
priate to a second-rate state university.

the University has gone far beyond the Founding Grant. The
University has erred on three points: I) it has mistaken the words
“partisan and “public”; 2) it has mistaken expression for “activ
ity, 3) it has equated “students” with the University administra
tion—for the first time in the history of student-administration re
lations. The reason for these interpretations is easy to find: the
University is afraid of people who will themselves mistake “par
tisan’’ and “public,” “expression” and “activity,” and “students” and
“University.” More importantly, the University fears the reper
cussions on its fund-raising campaign if influential, prospective
donors mistakenly think that the University is espousing a cause
anathema to the donors, themselves. In short, the stimulation of
the mind is being sacrificed to the preservation of the image. In
its very great efforts to raise enough money to become the Har
vard of the West, the University has set forth a policy more appro
priate to a second-rate state university.
‘At the request of the President of the University, I am
writing to inform you (ASSU President Annin Rosencranz) that
pending the policy review and until further notice, Stanford stu
dent organizations may not take public stands on issues affecting
affairs beyond the Stanford campus without prior University
approval. This provision applies also to officers of Stanford stu
dent organizations in their own official capacities, although it does
not limit the right of any student as an individual to participate in
undertakings which are not identified with the University.”

“A great university cannot long afford to discourage its stu
dents from involvement in, and concern for, the non-academic
world. Individually or collectively, students can speak only for
themselves, not for the University; to deny students the right of
self-expression because the public might erroneously feel that
they are speaking for the University as a whole, is to sacrifice the
stimulation of the mind to the preservation of the image.”

In eager retreat to the good old days of the nineteenth century,
the University has prohibited the Associated Students from draft
ing public resolutions in support of their principles. Not only has
the University retreated to the comfort of Leland Stanford’s Grant,
it has also chosen to interpret the will with a paranoid vengeance.
With delusions, at once of persecution and greatness, the Univer
