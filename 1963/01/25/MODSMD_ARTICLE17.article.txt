# NNOLI IGNORANT OF AFRICAN EVENTS
## UN 						Intervention Cannot Solve Congo's Great Political Problems 
### CHRIS CHRISMAN 
With due respect to our foreign
students who are here to learn
I must respond to the article by
Albert Nnoli whose unbounded
admiration of President Kennedy
is exceeded only by his ignorance
of what has been going on in his
own continent. Without going in
to the question of whether or not
Communism must be weighed in
the Congo balance, some of the
misconceptions about Tshombe
and our role in the affair must be
cleared up.
It is true that the Katangese
did not actually express their
wish to secede, but in July of
1960 there was no time for a
referendum. After the Congo had
become a nation, the pent-up
forces of African nationalism
crystalized; the Force Republique
ran amuck and all hell broke
loose. Lumumba and Kasavubu
froze, knowing that their only al
ternative was to call back the
Belgian troops to restore order.
It was Tshombe and the Foreign
Minister Bomboko who had the
courage to bury their nationalist
and anti-colonialist feelings long
enough to request Belgian as
sistance.
ABOUT THIS time Tshombe
became aware that even the Bel
gians wouldn’t be able to solve
the greater problem, arising from
the fact that the Katanganese—
with the exception of the Balubas
—have little in common with the
rest of the Congo. Tshombe saw
only one solution for Katanga—
secession. His support by his peo
ple and by Union Miniere is wit
nessed by the fact that he sus
tained the civil war for 2’i years,
a war which has cost the UN
alone almost $lOO million.
It must be acknowledged that
the Baluba tribe is the largest
tribe in Katanga, but the wealth
of the province is below the 9th
Parallel, outside of Baluba terri
tory. Union Miniere, which is re
sponsible directly and indirectly
for 95 per cent of Katanga’s eco
nomic activity, conducts most of
its operations in the southern
part of Katanga.

Jeffersonian democrats might
argue that the majority (here the

Balubas) should rule, but real
ists, who accept the control of the
UN Security Council by the Big
Five, would counter that rule by
a majority which has no wealth
or power is unworkable. There
fore, the people in the rich south
ern half of Katanga should have
the right to determine their des
tiny and the destiny of their
wealth. This is what Tchombe has
tried to do.

NNOLI HAS implied that
Tshombe seceded because he was
thwarted in his “unbounded appe
tite to gobble up Lumumba’s cab
inet.” II is important to point out
that Katanga, with more wealth
than the rest of the Congo’s prov
inces combined, was offered only
token voice in the Congolese Gov
ernment. Tshombe’s party, CON
AKAT, had consented to letting
Lumumba and Kasavubu take the
two top positions in the govern
ment in return for three cabinet
seats. As it turned out Katanga
got only one of the requested
cabinet seats and then the Cabi
net was “packed” so as to reduce
Katanga’s power in the cabinet
to nothing. Katanga’s impatience
in such a situation is understand
able.

One of the issues constantly
harped on by supporters of the
UN action in Katanga is that
Tshombe is a turncoat and that
his promise is unreliable. This
attitude can be accepted only if
one assumes some double stand
ard of morality one for Tshom
be and one for the other dramatis
personae in the Katanga affair.
Tshombe has gone back on his
word, but no more than Belgium,
the Congolese government, and
the UN.

The Belgians took sides in Ihe
Round Table Conference in 1960
and refused to listen to the ap
peals of Kasavubu and Tshombe
for a loose federal government—
an action that killed the chances
for workable Congolese govern
ment. It has already been pointed
out how the Congolese Govern
ment made a mockery of CON
AKET’s trust by packing the
Cabinet. And the UN, who Tshom
be reluctantly allowed to enter
Katanga to restore order, at
tempted to destroy Tshombe’s

government instead of suppress
ing the rebellion of the Baluba
terrorists. Tshombe faced with
those "turncoat” practices has
been forced to modify his position
in order to keep Katanga from be
ing engulfed by these external
forces.

YESTERDAY'S article asserts
that “Tshombe had no legal
rights to secede since this was not
guaranteed by the constitution.”
In fact, July 11, 1960, when Ka
tanga declared herself a free and
independent nation, the loi funda
mental (the provisional consti
tution! had not been ratified, and
therefore Katanga was not bound
by the constitution.
The naivete of the Nigerian
med-student reaches its extreme
in the statement that Kennedy is
“a good politician and has come
to listen to the right section of
public opinion the African
neighbors of the Congo and not
the European vested interests.
True, Kennedy is a good politi
cian, but not for the reasons cited
by Mr. Nnoli. President Kennedy
is aware that the United Nations
General Assembly is dominated
by the Afro-Asian bloc—a group
of mostly infant nations driven
by radical nationalism and uto
pian dreams of immediate afflu
ence. With his ear bent to this
teeming mass. Kennedy has
thought it expedient in the Cold
War to throw them a few crumbs
by supporting the UN in putting
down a secession something
feared by many of the heteroge
nous, unstable African nations.
It is hardly a question of peace,
or right, or kindness; it’s politics.
KENNEDY could hardly be mo
tivated by a yearning for peace.
The UN when it occupied Katan
ga stayed in peaceful Elisabeth
ville and did nothing to suppress
the Baluba rebellion in the north
ern part of Katanga. Tshombe
had to call in the White Legion
to do a job that was the UN’s only
raison d’etre in Katanga.
Nor could have the President;
been moved on by a respect for
what is “right.” The Charter of
the United Nations explicitly de
nies the right to interfere in in
ternal affairs of a nation. (Article
2. Sec. 4 & 7.) The only condition
under international law in which
a nation may request assistance
from other nations against a re
bellion is when it can be proven
that the rebellion has been in
spired or supported by external
powers. That was the reason for
the UN operations in Korea and
Lebanon. No such external force
has been named in Katanga.

THE CASE for kind-hearted
Kennedy might be hard to prove.
His approval of the UN’s actions
in Katanga is also a tacit approv
al of their atrocities—bombing
hospitals, killing civilians, firing
upon civilian cars with anti-tank
guns- hardly sportsmanlike—etc.
UN supporters have gone to
great lengths to justify their po
sition in economic terms. But in
reality, Katanga has been over
the years just barely solvent. Ad
mittedly the rest of the Congo is
in great poverty, but the Robin
Hoods of the UN are not going to
contribute any significant amount
to the economic growth of the
Congo by stealing from the rich
copper fields of Katanga. More
over, the tribal hatreds are such
that Katanga would Ik 1 lowered
to the position of financier to the
corrupt Congolese Government’s
economic whims, and in the proc
ess drastically lower Katanga’s
standards of living. It would be
like the United States contribut
ing most of its wealth to the
People’s Republic of China.
The UN intervention in the
Congo will hardly solve its po
litical problems either. The Con
go was held together by force
under Belgian colonialism and the
only thing that is going to hold
her together as a unitary nation.
Tshombe has fought hard for his
FINALLY, Kennedy’s playing
for support in the UN by giving
up one of our long-held principles
of self-determination and inde
pendence is of questionable long
range expedience. Suppose, for in
stance, that the Ukraine or Geor
gia decide to secede from the So
viet Union (a privilege they are
granted in their constitution). We
have established the precedent
that the UN could be called in to
quell such a secession.
