# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Lawrence of Arabia' Superlative Picture 
### JOSEPH L. JACOBS 
Of T. E. Lawrence, the English soldier who led the Arab re
volt in World War I, Winston Churchill once said, '"I deem him
one of the greatest beings alive in our time. 1 do not see his like
elsewhere.” The same superlatives can he supplied to “Lawrence
of Arabia," the movie based on Lawrence’s life that opened a

reserved seat only rim at the-'
United Artists Theatre in San
Francisco yesterday.

For "Lawrence of Arabia” is a
remarkable motion picture. Al
though it runs (with intermis
sion) over 3Vi hours, it never
bores the viewer, nor does it over
power the senses. Whore this Sam
Spiegel-David Lean production
could have used blood for the
sake of blood (dripping all over
cardboard sets) and obviously
false romantic episodes, it has
instead told the truth with taste,
tact, and subtlety. Where it could
have settled on one of the many
characteristics in Lawrence’s of
ten contradictory personality and
said that this is (he “key” to Law
rence’s identity, it instead admits
that the man was an enigma, thus
turning what could have been a
weakness of the film into the ma
jor point of the movie.
THE SCRIPT, by Robert Bolt,
is extraordinarily literate and in
telligent, yet it is also full of hu
mor. After the opening scenes
showing Lawrence’s death and fu
neral, it flashes back and follows
him from his job as a map-maker
for the British army in Cairo to
Arabia, and across the “uncross
able” Nafud desert to Aquaba,
which he and a hand picked hand
capture from the Turks. Law
rence then returns to Cairo where
General Allenby—completely as
tounded by Lawrence’s feat—
promises him all that he wants.
Lawrence sets out again and
blows up Turkish trains all over
Arabia, until he is captured by
the Turks in Deraa. The Turks,
after torturing him, release him,
and ho returns to Cairo to ask for
a transfer. When informed that
he is a necessary part of the Brit
ish plans in the Middle East, he
leads his troops triumphantly in
to Damascus, and it is here that
the movie ends.

The acting is, in a word, su
perb, Alec Guinness gives a fine
ly delineated performance as the
wily and wise Prince Feisal. An
thony Quinn delivers a compel
ling performance as Auda Abu
Tayi, who cries that he “must do
something honorable.”
Jack Hawkins is magnificently
military and evasive as General
Allenby, and Jose Ferrer contrib
utes a brilliant vignette as the
homosexual Turkish Bey. Claude
Rains, as a crafty politician, and
Arthur Kennedy, as a sensation
seeking reporter, are also excel
lent. Especially impressive also is
Egyptian star Omar Sharif as

Ali, and his performance could
earn him an Oscar.
BUT IN this company of inter
national stars, this company in
which there is not a bad perform
ance. Peter O’Toole gives a por
trayal of Lawrence that will have
to rank with the truly great film
portraits. Lawrence haled blood
shed, yet enjoyed killing; he was
extraordinarily egotistic and ex
hibitionistic, yet spent much of
his life trying to escape his own
legend; he was extremely ideal
istic, had amazing courage and
will-power and was probably a
homosexual.
O’Toole manages to embody all
of these characteristics in his per
formance with great subtlety, and
turns the film into a virtual tour
de force.
DAVID LEAN’S direction is also
brilliant. When blood is neces
sary, he uses it, but it never be
comes a “blood and sand” epic.
His shots of the desert are breath
taking, but he is never so caught
up by it that he loses sight of the
man—Lawrence—and the story
he is telling. Maurice Jarre’s mu
sical score is also stunning, and
his subtle re-workings of a basic
theme complement and enhance
the rest of the film.
This is a movie in which every
thing is just right. Each of the
many components involved fit
together in just the right way to
provide for the viewer an experi
ence that is memorable and and
a motion picture that is great.

perb, Alec Guinness gives a fine
ly delineated performance as the
wily and wise Prince Feisal. An
thony Quinn delivers a compel
ling performance as Auda Abu
Tayi, who cries that he “must do
something honorable.”
Jack Hawkins is magnificently
military and evasive as General
Allenby, and Jose Ferrer contrib
utes a brilliant vignette as the
homosexual Turkish Bey. Claude
Rains, as a crafty politician, and
Arthur Kennedy, as a sensation
seeking reporter, are also excel
lent. Especially impressive also is
Egyptian star Omar Sharif as

Ali, and his performance could
earn him an Oscar.
BUT IN this company of inter
national stars, this company in
which there is not a bad perform
ance. Peter O’Toole gives a por
trayal of Lawrence that will have
to rank with the truly great film
portraits. Lawrence haled blood
shed, yet enjoyed killing; he was
extraordinarily egotistic and ex
hibitionistic, yet spent much of
his life trying to escape his own
legend; he was extremely ideal
istic, had amazing courage and
will-power and was probably a
homosexual.
O’Toole manages to embody all
of these characteristics in his per
formance with great subtlety, and
turns the film into a virtual tour
de force.
DAVID LEAN’S direction is also
brilliant. When blood is neces
sary, he uses it, but it never be
comes a “blood and sand” epic.
His shots of the desert are breath
taking, but he is never so caught
up by it that he loses sight of the
man—Lawrence—and the story
he is telling. Maurice Jarre’s mu
sical score is also stunning, and
his subtle re-workings of a basic
theme complement and enhance
the rest of the film.
This is a movie in which every
thing is just right. Each of the
many components involved fit
together in just the right way to
provide for the viewer an experi
ence that is memorable and and
a motion picture that is great.
Of T. E. Lawrence, the English soldier who led the Arab re
volt in World War I, Winston Churchill once said, '"I deem him

elsewhere.” The same superlatives can he supplied to “Lawrence
of Arabia," the movie based on Lawrence’s life that opened a

reserved seat only rim at the-'
United Artists Theatre in San
Francisco yesterday.

For "Lawrence of Arabia” is a
remarkable motion picture. Al
though it runs (with intermis
sion) over 3Vi hours, it never
bores the viewer, nor does it over
power the senses. Whore this Sam
Spiegel-David Lean production
could have used blood for the
sake of blood (dripping all over
cardboard sets) and obviously
false romantic episodes, it has
instead told the truth with taste,
tact, and subtlety. Where it could
have settled on one of the many
characteristics in Lawrence’s of
ten contradictory personality and
said that this is (he “key” to Law
rence’s identity, it instead admits
that the man was an enigma, thus
turning what could have been a
weakness of the film into the ma
jor point of the movie.
THE SCRIPT, by Robert Bolt,
is extraordinarily literate and in
telligent, yet it is also full of hu
mor. After the opening scenes
showing Lawrence’s death and fu
neral, it flashes back and follows
him from his job as a map-maker
for the British army in Cairo to
Arabia, and across the “uncross
able” Nafud desert to Aquaba,
which he and a hand picked hand
capture from the Turks. Law
rence then returns to Cairo where
General Allenby—completely as
tounded by Lawrence’s feat—
promises him all that he wants.
Lawrence sets out again and
blows up Turkish trains all over
Arabia, until he is captured by
the Turks in Deraa. The Turks,
after torturing him, release him,
and ho returns to Cairo to ask for
a transfer. When informed that
he is a necessary part of the Brit
ish plans in the Middle East, he
leads his troops triumphantly in
to Damascus, and it is here that
the movie ends.

of Arabia," the movie based on Lawrence’s life that opened a

reserved seat only rim at the-'
United Artists Theatre in San
Francisco yesterday.

For "Lawrence of Arabia” is a
remarkable motion picture. Al
though it runs (with intermis
sion) over 3Vi hours, it never
bores the viewer, nor does it over
power the senses. Whore this Sam
Spiegel-David Lean production
could have used blood for the
sake of blood (dripping all over
cardboard sets) and obviously
false romantic episodes, it has
instead told the truth with taste,
tact, and subtlety. Where it could
have settled on one of the many
characteristics in Lawrence’s of
ten contradictory personality and
said that this is (he “key” to Law
rence’s identity, it instead admits
that the man was an enigma, thus
turning what could have been a
weakness of the film into the ma
jor point of the movie.
THE SCRIPT, by Robert Bolt,
is extraordinarily literate and in
telligent, yet it is also full of hu
mor. After the opening scenes
showing Lawrence’s death and fu
neral, it flashes back and follows
him from his job as a map-maker
for the British army in Cairo to
Arabia, and across the “uncross
able” Nafud desert to Aquaba,
which he and a hand picked hand
capture from the Turks. Law
rence then returns to Cairo where
General Allenby—completely as
tounded by Lawrence’s feat—
promises him all that he wants.
Lawrence sets out again and
blows up Turkish trains all over
Arabia, until he is captured by
the Turks in Deraa. The Turks,
after torturing him, release him,
and ho returns to Cairo to ask for
a transfer. When informed that
he is a necessary part of the Brit
ish plans in the Middle East, he
leads his troops triumphantly in
to Damascus, and it is here that
the movie ends.

The acting is, in a word, su
perb, Alec Guinness gives a fine
ly delineated performance as the
wily and wise Prince Feisal. An
thony Quinn delivers a compel
ling performance as Auda Abu
Tayi, who cries that he “must do
something honorable.”
Jack Hawkins is magnificently
military and evasive as General
Allenby, and Jose Ferrer contrib
utes a brilliant vignette as the
homosexual Turkish Bey. Claude
Rains, as a crafty politician, and
Arthur Kennedy, as a sensation
seeking reporter, are also excel
lent. Especially impressive also is
Egyptian star Omar Sharif as

Ali, and his performance could
earn him an Oscar.
BUT IN this company of inter
national stars, this company in
which there is not a bad perform
ance. Peter O’Toole gives a por
trayal of Lawrence that will have
to rank with the truly great film
portraits. Lawrence haled blood
shed, yet enjoyed killing; he was
extraordinarily egotistic and ex
hibitionistic, yet spent much of
his life trying to escape his own
legend; he was extremely ideal
istic, had amazing courage and
will-power and was probably a
homosexual.
O’Toole manages to embody all
of these characteristics in his per
formance with great subtlety, and
turns the film into a virtual tour
de force.
DAVID LEAN’S direction is also
brilliant. When blood is neces
sary, he uses it, but it never be
comes a “blood and sand” epic.
His shots of the desert are breath
taking, but he is never so caught
up by it that he loses sight of the
man—Lawrence—and the story
he is telling. Maurice Jarre’s mu
sical score is also stunning, and
his subtle re-workings of a basic
theme complement and enhance
the rest of the film.
This is a movie in which every
thing is just right. Each of the
many components involved fit
together in just the right way to
provide for the viewer an experi
ence that is memorable and and
a motion picture that is great.
