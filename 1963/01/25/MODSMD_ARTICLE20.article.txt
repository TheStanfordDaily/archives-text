Editor, The Daily:
Your correspondent, Toshiki
Suga, has his finger on the pulse
of United States affairs when he
writes, “Americans are so much
afraid of Communism that they
. . . look like they have seen
nightmares . . .”
The irony of the situation is
emphasized when one reads on
and discovers that the arrange
ments Mr. Suga reports as desir
able in a Communistic Society are
almost exactly those under which
United States citizens enjoy like
in 1963.
Adjustment of the distribution
of personal incomes is adequately
met by the device of income tax;
defense is regarded as a matter
for the government; education is
largely financed from public
funds and Public Utilities func
tion under the watchful eye of
the Monopolies Commission.
Roads, ports, and parks are al
most exclusively organized and
run by public bodies, and it is in
conceivable that they could be
efficiently administered in any
other way.
If the American public has had
nightmares recently, one has to
look no farther for a cause than
the remaining service mentioned
by Mr. Suga: Health. “Socialized
Medicine” has been branded as a
dirty word, and (he development
of social conscience in this field
has undoubtedly been impeded by
politics.
Even so, a review of the pres
ent situation shows that by
means of private insurance, Vet
erans Administration Hospitals.
Social Service and many other
agencies, most people who need
medical help are able to get it.
This stage having been reached,
it is but a small step further to
regard health, together with edu
cation and defense, as the respon
sibility of the State.
May I hasten to say. first, that
I am aware of the dangers of this
course, and second, that I am not
a socialist. In 1948, the year of
the commencement of the British
National Health Service, I was at
Medical School in London and the
medico-political storm which
raged at that time has left a
lasting impression on my mem
ory. More recently, I spent a
month in Saskatchewan and here
again the results of political ma
neuvering were distressingly evi
dent.
In many countries it is now
recognized that medical care in
all its aspects must be freely
available to everyone who needs
it. My own view is that this prin
ciple will take America by storm,
probably during this decade, and,
provided that a lead Is given by
the medical profession, the pros
pect should give rise to no anxi
ety. But medical leadership will
be essential if the recent acrimo
nious situation in Saskatchewan
is not to bo repeated elsewhere.
Medicine must be kept out of pol
itics.
What is left of the matters
raised by Mr. Suga? He mentions
that in Japan, “salt and cigarettes
are run by the government.” I
hold no brief for salt, but I am
bound to wonder what will be
come of the tobacco industry in
future years. The cigarette stands
indicted as a principal cause of
one of the most dreadful and
least curable of human diseases,
lung cancer. But in 1961, the peo
ple of (he United States smoked
an estimated 490 billion cigarettes
or eleven cigarettes daily for
everyone over the age of fifteen
years. And the six major tobacco
companies spent 144 million dol
lars (some of it in The Stanford
Daily) in promoting their sale
(Ref. Readers Digest, January.
1963).
Can anyone seriously doubt
that some governmental control
of this rapidly worsening situa
tion will become necessary? This
would not bo Communism, but it
would be Common Sense.

What is left of the matters
raised by Mr. Suga? He mentions
that in Japan, “salt and cigarettes
are run by the government.” I
hold no brief for salt, but I am
bound to wonder what will be
come of the tobacco industry in
future years. The cigarette stands
indicted as a principal cause of
one of the most dreadful and
least curable of human diseases,
lung cancer. But in 1961, the peo
ple of (he United States smoked
an estimated 490 billion cigarettes
or eleven cigarettes daily for
everyone over the age of fifteen
years. And the six major tobacco
companies spent 144 million dol
lars (some of it in The Stanford
Daily) in promoting their sale
(Ref. Readers Digest, January.
1963).
Can anyone seriously doubt
that some governmental control
of this rapidly worsening situa
tion will become necessary? This
would not bo Communism, but it
would be Common Sense.

Editor, The Daily:
Your correspondent, Toshiki
Suga, has his finger on the pulse
of United States affairs when he
writes, “Americans are so much
afraid of Communism that they
. . . look like they have seen
nightmares . . .”
The irony of the situation is
emphasized when one reads on
and discovers that the arrange
ments Mr. Suga reports as desir
able in a Communistic Society are
almost exactly those under which
United States citizens enjoy like
in 1963.
Adjustment of the distribution
of personal incomes is adequately
met by the device of income tax;
defense is regarded as a matter
for the government; education is
largely financed from public
funds and Public Utilities func
tion under the watchful eye of
the Monopolies Commission.
Roads, ports, and parks are al
most exclusively organized and
run by public bodies, and it is in
conceivable that they could be
efficiently administered in any
other way.
If the American public has had
nightmares recently, one has to
look no farther for a cause than
the remaining service mentioned
by Mr. Suga: Health. “Socialized
Medicine” has been branded as a
dirty word, and (he development
of social conscience in this field
has undoubtedly been impeded by
politics.
Even so, a review of the pres
ent situation shows that by
means of private insurance, Vet
erans Administration Hospitals.
Social Service and many other
agencies, most people who need
medical help are able to get it.
This stage having been reached,
it is but a small step further to
regard health, together with edu
cation and defense, as the respon
sibility of the State.
May I hasten to say. first, that
I am aware of the dangers of this
course, and second, that I am not
a socialist. In 1948, the year of
the commencement of the British
National Health Service, I was at
Medical School in London and the
medico-political storm which
raged at that time has left a
lasting impression on my mem
ory. More recently, I spent a
month in Saskatchewan and here
again the results of political ma
neuvering were distressingly evi
dent.
In many countries it is now
recognized that medical care in
all its aspects must be freely
available to everyone who needs
it. My own view is that this prin
ciple will take America by storm,
probably during this decade, and,
provided that a lead Is given by
the medical profession, the pros
pect should give rise to no anxi
ety. But medical leadership will
be essential if the recent acrimo
nious situation in Saskatchewan
is not to bo repeated elsewhere.
Medicine must be kept out of pol
itics.
