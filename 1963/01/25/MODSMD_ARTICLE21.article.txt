Among the most important and
most sacred rights of free stu
dents is the right to speak out
both individually and collectively
against injustice. Students at
Stanford must be informed of
conditions of students elsewhere
in the world and must be encour
aged to empathize with such of
those students who are being im
prisoned and tortured for passive
ly resisting government author
ity.
We have not only an identity
with, but a responsibility for, the
struggles of students in Iran,
Spain. Angola, Paraguay; in the
developing and emerging nations
of the world; and, of course, in
all those countries under Commu
nist control where academic free
dom and student autonomy are in
credibly distant visions. We must
undertake the task of redeeming
them from poverty and intellec
tual bondage. The World Univer
sity Service, one of whose spon
sors is Stanford’s President, has
recently declared that “the press
ing task of this year and this cen
tury is to feed, clothe, and un
leash from fear the millions who,
through no fault of their own,
live in such desolation.” We must
empathize no less with students
in our own country who are con
ducting sit-ins and boycotts to at
tain human dignity.

THE INDIVIDUAL student
whether at Stanford or any other
campus is both a student and an
American citizen. The individual
in a democratic society ought
never to relieve himself of his
obligation to participate fully and
responsibly in the life of the total
community. We are involved in
mankind and are naturally con
cerned for the welfare of our fel
lowmen. As students, we are like
ly to be particularly concerned
for the welfare of other students,
and we are affected not only
when students’ rights are arbi
trarily abridged at our own Uni
versity but also when students
are denied access to a university
by arbitrary officials and jeering
mobs in Mississippi. The condi
tions and the rights of students
at “Ole Miss” affect conditions of
American education in general
and therefore concern us.
As a student the individual
does not stop relating to other
people and responding to them.
He influences and is influenced
by what he sees and hears and
feels. He may have to add fur
ther obligations as a student to
those ho already has as a citizen,
but he can never be asked to re
linquish or deny his human re
sponsibility for the welfare of the
community and the preservation
and propagation of American
ideals.

We reject the conception of the
student as a detached observer
and critic who must resist “pre
mature involvement” until he has
increased his knowledge of truth.
We do not see the student as one
who must reserve direct encoun
ters and subjective commitments
on the theory that such involve
ments may handicap his powers
of rational objective thought. We
cannot suppose that the mere
conferral of a university diploma
suddenly lifts all inhibitions and
enables the individual to partici
pate creatively in democratic life.
Student political and social ac
tion takes place as a vital part of
reflective thought and considered
knowledge. Knowledge must be
applied to the continuing func
tions of life.
ONLY through experience and
involvement can the student
learn the life of the responsible
citizen. We need to empirically
test the values which are being
conceptualized here at Stanford.
The laboratory, as it were, for

this empirical verification is the
larger society. We cannot learn
the meaning and worth of what
we are taught ethics, humanism,
democracy, citizenship except
through participation and involve
ment. One may recall the exis
tentialist attitude that by acting
one becomes something more.
One’s mind is never passive; it
is perpetually active and recep
tive. Whatever powers are being
strengthened in us as students
must be exercised here and now.
Viewed in this context commit
ment is not regrettable, but rath
er essential: it is not indicative of
impetuousness and naivete but is
rather a vital part of the educa
tional process. We are not talking
here about blind commitment to
ideology but rather commitment
to rectifying injustices and bet
tering the world. After college, a
great many of us are likely to
pursue narrow paths of learning
and professional interest and may
have little time to concern our
selves with social action issues.
Some of us will never be more
alert and aware nor more politi
cally knowledgeable and con
cerned than we are right now as
students at Stanford.
ACCORDINGLY, the Assort
ated Students affirms its right
indeed its duty, not merely to be
come informed but to take stand;
and speak out on public issues afl
fecting and concerning us as stul
dents and citizens. /I
We must make our concersH
known and our voices heard evija
in the wildernesses of Communist
and other tyrannical regimes. Our
rigid to speak out against totalH
tarianism in the international
arena is consistent with the right!
to speak out against injustice ami
inhumanity wherever it appears.

The Associated Students recog
nizes the great value of student
involvement, both individually
and collectively, in problems of
political and social action and the
integral connections of these pro
grams with the educational proc
ess.

ALTHOUGH the Stanford stu
dent ought to devote primary at
tention to his academic commit
ments, the Associated Students of
Stanford University encourages
student participation in, and com
mitment to, legitimate political
and social activities. The Stanford
student should be an active, in
formed, responsible participant
in the democratic life of the cam
pus, local, state, national and in
ternational communities. The
Stanford student should become
informed on those problems
which would responsibly involve
him in social and political action.
In this context the student must,
of course, concern himself not
merely with problems of direct
relevance to his life as a student
in the academic community, but
also with the greater problems
and issues of national and inter
national life.
