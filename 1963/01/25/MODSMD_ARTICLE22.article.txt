Editor, The Daily:
Students who had always
thought of the “Stanford Family’’
as a charming metaphor were
treated to a new surprise yester
day as Doctor Sterling implicitly
acknowledged Stanford’s organic
existence by assuring us that his
patient “enjoys good health.” But
I wonder if his diagnosis—al
though candid, and much appre
ciated—was not too simplified
and modest.

Presumably, if the University
has life, it is organized into or
gans, and then into cells —stu-
dents falling into the latter cate
gory. A healthy organism has
healthy cells. But as Doctor Ster
ling has shown, by pointing to the
condition of the grounds in front
of Tresidder Union, many stu
dents do not know how to dis
pose of waste materials properly.
And this is not the only problem.
On certain Saturdays during
Fall Quarter sudden worsenings
of tiie environment cause violent
reactions in many of these same
cells—reactions so strong that
they threaten the very existence
of the whole organism.
But where do these cells lie,
that a disastrous football game
might prove so disturbing as to
produce great suffering and pos
sibly even death in the organism
which contains them? If they
formed the brain, only a mild
headache would ensue; and if
they made up the stomach, only
a gastric upset would result. But
suppose these cells formed that
organ which gives its owner con
cern only when it misbehaves—
the appendix. This, in fact, seems
to he Doctor Sterling’s view when
he says, “The quality of the Uni
versity will never exceed the
quality of its members”—a chain
is only as strong as its weakest
link.
But the cells which make up

this appendix should not fear
that they may cause lasting harm
to the organism of which they
are a part. For the Doctor, ever
concerned about the health of his
patient, has placed him on an
operating table, .and given small
but continual doses of anesthetic
so that if his patient’s appendix
ever even threatens to rupture, it
can be quickly and painlesesly re
moved.
Thank heavens we have a Doc
tor in the house.

Fall Quarter sudden worsenings
of tiie environment cause violent
reactions in many of these same
cells—reactions so strong that
they threaten the very existence
of the whole organism.
But where do these cells lie,
that a disastrous football game
might prove so disturbing as to
produce great suffering and pos
sibly even death in the organism
which contains them? If they
formed the brain, only a mild
headache would ensue; and if
they made up the stomach, only
a gastric upset would result. But
suppose these cells formed that
organ which gives its owner con
cern only when it misbehaves—
the appendix. This, in fact, seems
to he Doctor Sterling’s view when
he says, “The quality of the Uni
versity will never exceed the
quality of its members”—a chain
is only as strong as its weakest
link.
But the cells which make up

this appendix should not fear
that they may cause lasting harm
to the organism of which they
are a part. For the Doctor, ever
concerned about the health of his
patient, has placed him on an
operating table, .and given small
but continual doses of anesthetic
so that if his patient’s appendix
ever even threatens to rupture, it
can be quickly and painlesesly re
moved.
Thank heavens we have a Doc
tor in the house.

Students who had always
thought of the “Stanford Family’’
as a charming metaphor were
treated to a new surprise yester
day as Doctor Sterling implicitly
acknowledged Stanford’s organic
existence by assuring us that his
patient “enjoys good health.” But
I wonder if his diagnosis—al
though candid, and much appre
ciated—was not too simplified
and modest.

Presumably, if the University
has life, it is organized into or
gans, and then into cells —stu-
dents falling into the latter cate
gory. A healthy organism has
healthy cells. But as Doctor Ster
ling has shown, by pointing to the
condition of the grounds in front
of Tresidder Union, many stu
dents do not know how to dis
pose of waste materials properly.
And this is not the only problem.
On certain Saturdays during
Fall Quarter sudden worsenings
of tiie environment cause violent
reactions in many of these same
