Chris Jessen, provides good re
bounding strength. Guard Chuck
Hudkins, who played frosh ball,
is a fine floor leader and heads
a mixed offense which may fast
break at any moment. The team

began the season with an Impres
sive 38-26 win over tough Phi Delt.
THK THETA BELTS rely on
a high-scoring, fast break offense.
They boast two of the best intra
mural guards in Munn Chin and
John Wells, as well as a pair of
good forwards, Steve King and
Dave Hisey. Theta Delt wrecked
AKL, 66-17, in its opening game.
Also threats are DU and ATO.
Bill Twist and Bruce Loughner
are high scorers in DU’s high post
offense, with Dick Agnich hauling
down most of the robounds. Soph
omore center Paul Miles is iho
big scorer in ATO’s attack, while
guards John Smurr and Don Gray
lead a hustling, man-to-man de
fense*.
Everyone else will be looking up
at Cedro, with a front lint* averag

ing over 6-5. Four players can
dunk the hall, the tallest of whom
is 6-6 center Steve Leonard, an
ineligible frosh team player and
high scorer.
BEST AMONG the eating clubs
is El Capitan, with John Rumsey
and Roger Cow an providing
points and rebounding, and all-
Nevada guard Lee Lyons helping
out with flashy hall handling.

Chris Cottle and Mike McArdle
give Fremont beef under the
boards, and guard Bill Blaylock is
excellent on defense. Theta Chi
runs a fast break attack with cen
ter Dave Stoner doing most of the
scoring and board work. Chuck
Horton’s rebounding and Jerry
Bengson’s passing and outside
shooting sparked Phi Kap to a
53-16 win over the KA’s.
Sigma Chi defends its intra
