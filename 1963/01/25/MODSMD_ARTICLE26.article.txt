Stanford students will have a
chance to learn what “sticky
wicket,’’ “maiden over,” and “silly
mid-off” mean when Stanford
plays host to the California Crick
et Association this Sunday on the
Farm. The match, which will last
from 12 noon to 5:30 p.rn., is to
be played with a wicket of jute
matting on the enclosed football
field near Sunken Diamond.

The Stanford team is composed
of graduate students and should
be a respectable aggregation. Last
year, Stanford managed a split of
two games with California.

THE TEAM appears to have
batting strength. Balan Salaya,
David Pyke and Dhanjoo Ghista,
all holdover’s from last year’s
side, should give Stanford a good
start. Andrew Ma, Elmo Perera
and James Meynell should pro
vide solidity to the middle of the
order. Bright knocks are expected
from newcomers Larry Chuk
wudebe, Michael English and Ran
jit Abeysuriya.
Indications are that the howl
ing will be steadier than it was
last year. Certainly there will be
greater depth. Andrew Ma will
probably start, using the new ball
from one end.

Pradir Basu, R. Krishnamurthy,
Michael English and Honeif Hoos
enally will provide the pace attack.
After the shine wears off the ball,
James Meynell. Nadaraja Kasi
raja and Pradeep Ratel will toss
them up to the batsmen.
