# Stanford Ruggers Meet Universities Club
## 
### BEX TIPTON 
Stanford’s varsity rugby squad
lays its undefeated status on the
line this Saturday, hosting tough
Universities Club on the Card
field at 3:00.
“They’re a pretty tough team,”
says Stanford coach Pete Kmelo
vie. Tough, he might have added,
when they play together. Univer

skies’ squad is composed of about
equal portions of ex-Stanford and
ex-Cal rugby and football stars.
Apparently relations between the
wo factions are amicable enough
Hit whether such an unnatural
situation can persist is of course
doubtful.
LEADING THE Stanford con
tingent for Universities are Tom
McManus, Rod Sears, and Rick
McMillen. McManus was captain
of Stanford’s rugby team last sea
son, and a solid player for the
Cards. Sea rs, better known for his
football exploits, was nonetheless
. valuable performer for the rug
gers as well. McMillen was like
wise a football standout who
transferred his skills to rugby.
From the Great Public Institu
tion, and bulwarking (he Univer
sities attack, are John Harrison,
Jim Burress, and Bob Chiappone.
Harrison, an Australian import,
is Universities’ kicker, and there
fore one of the top scorers on the
learn. Burress was captain of both
the rugby and football teams at
Cal during his senior year.
Chiappone is, in Kmetovic’s
words, “one of the best lineoul
men on the West Coast. He really
gets up there, and there’s no doubt
about who’s got the ball.” lane
outs are the inbounds play of
rugby. At the same time they are
analogous to the tip-off in hasket

ball.
WHEN THE ball goes out of
bounds, the team whose player
last touched the ball loses posses
sion. A player from the other
team throws the ball above and
between the opposing sets of for
wards. who are lined up at right
angles to the sidelines. Hence the
origin of the term.
Chiappone is one of the better
men for getting possession of the
ball in such a situation. This was
Stanford’s weak point against
Olympic Club last week. Only
when the older Olympic squad
began to tire did the Indians man
age to control the lineouts, and it
was only then that they could pull
ahead to stay.
A1 Hildebrand, out last week
with an injured knee, is a doubt

ful starter for Saturday’s match.'
Beau Bianchi will start at fullback
for the Cards, a position at which
he did very well last week in Stan
ford’s 23-11 victory. Steve Thur
low will join fellow football quar
terbacks Bob Price and Clark
Weaver on the varsity squad.
THE REMAINDER of the squad
will be the same as in the opener.
Randy Devening will start at
hook, with pr ops Troy Barbee and
Randy Vahan. In the second row
will he Dick Leeuwenberg, and
either- Hildebrand or Chuck Bueh
ler. Back row will be Steve Pur
sell. Frank Patitucci and Tim Han
sel will play at breaks. In the
backfield, Bianchi will lie joined
by Price, Gordon Waddell, Weav
er', Hal Steuber, Brad Freeman,
and Braden Beck.
