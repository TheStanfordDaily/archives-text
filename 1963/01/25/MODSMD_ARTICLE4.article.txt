# Commentator Says KPFA 'Left' Policy Lets Public Chose
## 
### NANCY MARSHALL 
Defending radio station KPFA's
liberal policy currently being in
vestigated by the Senate Sub
committee on Internal Security,
commentator Burton White of
that station said last night in
Tresidder that the public can gov
ern itself wisely, but that to do
so it must be able to choose from
alternative ideas.
Therefore, he said, people must
have access to Communist the
ory so they may learn what it is
and then either support or reject
it.

Until the Senate subcommittee
completes investigation of pos
sible Communist infiltration into
KPFA activities, the FCC is with
holding license renewal.

“In attempting to determine
whether or not some subversive
people have gotten themselves in
to position where they could
spread Communist doctrine, the
Senate subcommitte assumes
that such propaganda would
harm citizens of the United
States,” White said.
“However, the ‘freedom of
speech’ clause of the First
Amendment of the Constitution
is one of the most absolutely
stated limitations on government
interference,” he said. “This re
striction guarantees to the mi
nority its right to become the ma
jority.”
“If this country is under threat
of totalitarianism, security is de
rived from the right of free
speech,” the speaker said. “This
right distinguishes the American
from the totalitarian system, and
strength lies in amplifying this
difference,” ho said.
