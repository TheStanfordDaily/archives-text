# Cardinals Extend Drive; Take W.U.S. From IIR
## 
### 
Cardinals Board, after a joint
meeting with representatives of
the Institute of International Re
lations, decided to make the
World University Service, an in
ternational cooperative aid fund,
their sole drive of the Winter
Quarter.
Reflecting student opinion that
several drives per quarter are
neither successful nor wanted,
Cardinals chose WUS as the most
worthwhile charity for student
contributions. Cardinals’ chair
men Marco Magnano and Caro
lyn Volk announced that the
WUS drive, originally scheduled
by the HR to end today, will be
continued until Friday, Feb. 1.
Contributions will be made
through the living groups with
the aid of representatives chosen
by each group. This is the same
procedure that the HR has used
during the past week to raise
money. However, the goal of
$4,000 was not reached.
