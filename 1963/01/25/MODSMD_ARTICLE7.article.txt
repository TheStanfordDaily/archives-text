Disregarding a warning from

! in the name of President Wallace
jSterling, the Legislature of the
j Associated Students last night
{passed three resolutions 1) af
firming the right of the Associ
i ated Students to speak out on

public issues 21 approving the
letters from ASSU President
Armin Rosencranz to Senator
Thomas Dodd and FCC Chair
man Newton Minow in which
Rosencranz expressed “grave
concern” over the investigation
of KPFA and 3) expressing the
Legislature’s concern that the
right of free speech is being

threatened by the Senate's inves
tigation of KPFA.
Yesterday afternoon Rosen
cranz received the following let
ter forbidding the Legislature
from passing their third resolu
tion and contradicting the prin
ciples expressed in the first two.
This letter, to Rosencranz from
Winbigler, was written in reply
to Rosencranz’s letter to Minow
and Dodd and in reply to Legisla
ture’s announced intention of
voting on the KPFA investiga
tion:

“The resolution which has been
proposed for action by LASSU
regarding the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee repre
sents an improper involvement
of the University’s name in a
matter wKlch, accordihg'lo offi
cial policy, is not delegated to
student organizations.
“The President and the Board
of Trustees have begun a review
of the University’s policies relat
ing to institutional participation
in and identification with politi
cal and social action.

“At the request of the Presi
dent of the University, I am writ
ing to inform you that pending
the policy review and until fur
ther notice, Stanford student or
ganizations may not take public
stands on issues affecting affairs
beyond the Stanford campus
without prior University approv
al. This provision applies also to
officers of Stanford student or
ganizations in their official ca
pacities, although it does not lim
it the right of any student as an
individual to participate in under
takings which are not identified
with the University.”
H. Donald Winbigler
Dean of Students
Legislature passed the first
resolution: 17 for, 1 against, 2
abstentions; the second with 13
for, 6 against, 1 abstention: the
third with 12 for, 6 against, 2 ab
taining. On all three votes Rosen
cranz abstained.
The text of the first resolu
tion is printed on page three
as the ASSU’s position on the
educational role of social
action.
Legislature passed its second
resolution “approving” the fol
lowing letter, which caused the
response from Winbigler to Ro
sencranz printed above:
“On behalf of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
I would like to express grave
concern over the Internal Securi
ty Subcommittee’s investigation
of the Pacifica foundation, spon
sors of radio station KPFA
Berkeley'.
“KPFA is a favorite station
among Stanford students, and
many of our students and profes
sors have appeared on KPFA pro
grams. Rather than engage in
the insipid and unimaginative
programming so characteristic of

radio stations, the KPFA people
present a variety of intelligent,
illuminating, and educationally
valuable programs. If many of
these programs present liberal or
leftist viewpoints we find our
selves merely challenged and
stimulated the more. Surely the
sophisticated audience to whom
such programs are directed can
discriminate between valid ideas.
“Propaganda, of course, may
be excluded from the airwaves
by appropriate FCC action. There
is no suggestion that the Pacifica
Foundation has engaged in such
illegal behavior, nor is there any
reasonable expectation that it
will do so.
“Because the right to search
and question freely and to ex
press ideas, however unorthodox,
without fear of reprisal is so fun
damental to academic freedom in
America, and because KPFA is
an important channel in the com
munication of such ideas and
opinions, we have taken this op
portunity to make our concern
known. We will follow further de
velopments in this case with in
terest and close attention.”
Armin Rosencranz
President, ASSU

Prior to the KPFA discussion,
which had already been on the
agenda from last week, Rosen
cranz assured the Legislature
that in view of their endorsement
of the social action position, he
would not consider refusal to
discuss the KPFA issue as a vote
of no-confidence in him. Legisla
ture then passed the resolution.
In his opening remarks to Leg
islature, Rosencranz said, “The
last twenty-four hours have been
a crucial period in the history of\
student autonomy at Stanford.” \
In those twenty-four hours, Win- \
bigler responded to Rosencranz’s
letter to Minow and Dodd (a car
bon copy had been given to Ster
ling i. Yesterday morning and af
ternoon, various students and
faculty conferred with Rosen
cranz in his office. Subsequent to
those conferences, Rosencranz
drafted the resolution on the edu
cational role of social action.
Then, last night Legislature
passed the three resolutions.
The University in Winbigler’s
letter affirmed what it considers
to be long-standing policy al
though the Legislature this au
tumn passed resolutions on
Propositions 13 and 24.
Despite the disagreement be
tween the ASSU and the Admin
istration, Rosencranz emphasized
his “high regard and esteem” for
Sterling and regretted that the
matter seems to have been con
strued in personal terms by the
President’s Office.

Armin Rosencranz
President, ASSU

Prior to the KPFA discussion,
which had already been on the
agenda from last week, Rosen
cranz assured the Legislature
that in view of their endorsement
of the social action position, he
would not consider refusal to
discuss the KPFA issue as a vote
of no-confidence in him. Legisla
ture then passed the resolution.
In his opening remarks to Leg
islature, Rosencranz said, “The
last twenty-four hours have been
a crucial period in the history of\
student autonomy at Stanford.” \
In those twenty-four hours, Win- \
bigler responded to Rosencranz’s
letter to Minow and Dodd (a car
bon copy had been given to Ster
ling i. Yesterday morning and af
ternoon, various students and
faculty conferred with Rosen
cranz in his office. Subsequent to
those conferences, Rosencranz
drafted the resolution on the edu
cational role of social action.
Then, last night Legislature
passed the three resolutions.
The University in Winbigler’s
letter affirmed what it considers
to be long-standing policy al
though the Legislature this au
tumn passed resolutions on
Propositions 13 and 24.
Despite the disagreement be
tween the ASSU and the Admin
istration, Rosencranz emphasized
his “high regard and esteem” for
Sterling and regretted that the
matter seems to have been con
strued in personal terms by the
President’s Office.
