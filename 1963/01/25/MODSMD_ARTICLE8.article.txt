# Sessions Explains Composing, Performing of Musical Works
## 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
Concluding the Harry Camp
Lecture Series yesterday after-

| noon. Roger Sessions, Professor
I of Music at Princeton University,
discussed the process of compos
| ing and performing music.
“Many composers don’t even
i touch an instrument while they
[ are working . . . they elaborate
j their compositions entirely in
| their imagination,” he said. “Their
music is virtually never absent
from their consciousness.”
“The composer always starts
j with a musical idea,” such as pat
| tern or melodic fragment, which
| sets his mind in motion, he con
| tinued. The idea is not vague but
consists of “precise musical
sounds and movements.”
Notes or themes mean nothing
by themselves, however, he
stressed. “It is the context al
ways which is significant.”
The main considerations in the
elements of a composition, he ex
plained, are articulation, con
trast, association, and proportion.
“Articulation” is clear definition
and sharpness on each level of
the composition from musical
fragments to periods and groups.
“Contrast” involves organization,
placing and timing. "Associa
tion,” the relation of different
musical parts, provides clarifica
tion of the original design and
“invariably involves repetition.”
“Proportion” relates to the tim
j ing of sections of music and is
“a question of the satisfaction or
| disappointment of the listener.”

In the performance of music,
individual expression is more im
portant than perfection of notes,
he felt. To an experienced com
poser it is refreshing to hear his
piece played in a new and differ
ent way, he said. “There is no
such thing as a definitive or stan
dard performance of a piece.”
