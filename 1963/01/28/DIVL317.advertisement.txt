1. I'll tell you what you have
to look for in a job. You have
to look for fringe benefits.
That’s the hie thing today.
Yes the big thing.
2. You have to consider your needs.
You’re going to get married some
day, aren’t you? Then you need
life and accident insurance.
Go on—go on—
3. You’re going to have kids so
you'll want maternity benefits.
I’d like lots of children.
4. And what about medical bills?
That’s something every big
family has to think about. You
need a good major medical plan
that covers almost everything.
You’re right—you’re right!

5. And you’re not going to want to
work all your life, are you?
You’re going to want to take it
easy—you know, travel around,
live it up. So you need a
retirement plan that guarantees
you plenty of dough.
I can sec it now.
6. That’s why I say you have to
look at the fringe benefits when
you look for a job.
But don’t yon also have to
look for interesting work,
good income, the chance
for advancement?

7. You sure do. That’s why I’m
going to work for Equitable. You
get all those job advantages
and all the fringe benefits, too.
I admire your thinking.
