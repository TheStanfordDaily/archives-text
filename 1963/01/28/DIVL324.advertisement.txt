“What responsibilities will you start with at W. E.? M
Exciting ones. With plenty of room for your pro
fessional development. Western Electric's busi
ness depends on new ideas. And new engineers
take responsible, immediate part in projects
that implement the entire art of telephony
including electronic telephone offices, compu
ter-controlled production techniques and
microwave transmission. On many of these ex
citing advances in communications, Western's
engineers work closely with engineers from our
research team-mate, Bell Telephone Laborato
ries. For Western Electric to maintain the Bell
System's ultra-high quality standards, extraor
dinary manufacturing, process and testing
techniques are required. Opportunities for fast
moving careers exist now for electrical, me
chanical and industrial engineers, and also for
physical science, liberal arts and business
majors.
For more detailed information, get your copy of
the Western Electric career opportunities book
let from your Placement Officer. Or write Col
lege Relations Coordinator, Western Electric
Company, Room 6306, 222 Broadway, New
York 38, New York. And be sure to arrange for
a personal interview when the Bell System re
cruiting team comes to visit your campus this
year—or during your senior year.
