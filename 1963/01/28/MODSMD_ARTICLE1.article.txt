### 
United Press International
WASHINGTON President Kennedy’s senatorial mission to
Berlin recommended yesterday that the United States consider cut
ting its troop commitment to Western Europe. It also said this
country should consider boosting its non-stratcgic trade with the
Communist bloc in view of Western Europe’s trade with the area.
Release of the report came amid mounting Washington concern
over French President Charles do Gaulle's veto of Britain's entry
into the Common Market and his opposition to a multi-nation nuclear
defense force. The report said that if the Common Market-British
negotiations fail, “the prospects are for self-defeating commercial
conflicts in Western Europe.” Moreover, it said, U.S. foreign trade
would be endangered.

Lacking cooperation from Western Europe, the Mansfield group
said, this country should; “reduce grant or ‘easy-loan’ aid to former
European colonies in which the bulk of European aid is the ‘more
profitable form of assistance’ and consider equalizing the commer
cial opportunities of our own people in Eastern Europe.”

LOC KHEED, LONGSHOREMEN STRIKES Two of the nation’s
major labor disputes ended yesterday with the complete settlement
of the longshoremen’s strike and acceptance by Aero-Space workers
of a new contract with the Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
The eight-month deadlock between the International Association
ot Machinists (lAMi and Lockheed over union security ended when
union members accepted a management contract calling for exten
sive cooperation between the lAM and the firm. The settlement came
60 days after a strike against Lockheed was halted by an 80-day
cooling-off period under Taft-Hartley Act provisions. Included in the
3-year new contract was a 28.3 cent an hour pay increase over the
three years and other fringe benefits.
Dock workers in the South Atlantic region, the last to end their
walkout in the longshoremen dispute, signed a new contract yester
day afternoon. Federal mediator W. A. McAlister said the contract
provides a 39-cent pay increase. The dock strike lasted five weeks,
idled more than 100,000 workers and caused economic losses esti
mated about $9OO million.

WASHINGTON President Kennedy’s senatorial mission to
Berlin recommended yesterday that the United States consider cut
ting its troop commitment to Western Europe. It also said this
country should consider boosting its non-stratcgic trade with the
Communist bloc in view of Western Europe’s trade with the area.
Release of the report came amid mounting Washington concern
over French President Charles do Gaulle's veto of Britain's entry
into the Common Market and his opposition to a multi-nation nuclear
defense force. The report said that if the Common Market-British
negotiations fail, “the prospects are for self-defeating commercial
conflicts in Western Europe.” Moreover, it said, U.S. foreign trade
would be endangered.

Lacking cooperation from Western Europe, the Mansfield group
said, this country should; “reduce grant or ‘easy-loan’ aid to former
European colonies in which the bulk of European aid is the ‘more
profitable form of assistance’ and consider equalizing the commer
cial opportunities of our own people in Eastern Europe.”
