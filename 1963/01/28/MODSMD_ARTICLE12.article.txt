# Guest-in-Residence Lowenstein To Speak on South West Africa
## 
### 
Allard K. Lowenstein, who
probably knows more about
South West Africa than any
other man in America, is a Guest
in-Residence at Stern and Wilbur
this week.

A political science professor
with a law degree from Yale,
Lowenstein and two companions
spent several months of 1959
roving South Africa with a cam
era and a tape recorder. The re
sults of this trip were a report
to the United Nations Committee
on South West Africa and the
book “Brutal Mandate.”
In his book, which has been
praised both in the U.N. and on
the floor of the U.S. Congress,
Lowenstein recounts his often
fugitive journey by-Volkswagen
across South Africa, from town
to African reservation, across

borders, and into the huts of tri
bal leaders.

This is an almost unbelievable
tale of racism and of the police
state methods employed by the
white minority of South Africa,
both within its own borders and
in the U.N. Mandate of South
West which it administers, to
keep the Africans and the “Col
oreds” under domination.
“Brutal Mandate” has rated
glowing reviews from the New
York Times, The New Republic,
and the San Francisco Chronicle,
among others. Said the New Re
public:

“. . . What other scholars
know second-hand, Lowenstein
knows first-hand . . . Mr. Low
enstein not only provides a lucid
diagnosis and prognosis, but also
his indignation is tempered with
real sympathy for the white mi
nority.”

The 34-year-old Lowenstein has
been a member of South African
Chief Lutuli’s staff at Oslo when
the latter received the Nobel
Peace Prize, an elected delegate
to the Democratic National Con
vention in 1960, a member of a
committee working on political
reform in New York City, a legal
consultant to the N.A.A.C.P., one
of the three white men to attend
the Negro Leadership Conference
in New York last fall, and is a
member of the New York Bar
Association.
He has twice been in contact
with the Underground in Spain,
actually working there with
them last summer. He has also
served on the staffs of U.S. Sen
ators Hubert Humphrey and
Frank Graham.

Lowenstein spent last year at
Stanford as Director of Stern
Hall and also taught several
courses here. He will speak on
South West Africa and Spain in
discussions in Wilbur and Stern
lounges during this week. There
will be a reception for him in
the Donner lounge in Stern to
morrow from 5:15-6:15 p.m., to
which the entire campus is in
vited.
