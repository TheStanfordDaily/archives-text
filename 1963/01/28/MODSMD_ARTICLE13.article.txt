# $500 Stereo Player Disappears From Serra
## 
### 
Early yesterday morning a $5OO
stereo record player was stolen
from Serra House in Stern Hall.
A $lOO reward has been offered

“for information leading' to the
return of the set,” announced
Bob McNeil, house president.
According to McNeil, the set
was stolen between 2:35 and 9
a.m. Serra bought the set two
weeks ago with money from
house dues and had not yet in
sured it. Serra had asked the ad
ministration for funds but had
received “nothing but promises,”
said McNeil.
Serra had to forego installation
of the set until the administra
tion gave its approval since they
might otherwise be held liable
for damage to University prop
erty. Therefore, the person (s)
who took the set had only to pick
it up and cant it off.
The missing parts are: a Pilot
602 MA multiplex stereo FM
tuner, amplifier and pre-ampli
fier ($225); two KLH 10 speakers
($188); and a Garrard AT-6
changer and base and an AE car
tridge ($65).
Anyone with information is re
quested to call DA 6-8176, 7-9
p.m., and ask for Mr. Hunter.
McNeil said that all names will
be withheld.
