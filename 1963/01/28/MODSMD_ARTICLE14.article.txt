# A 						Rationale Needed
## 
### 
If the University has any respect for its students, it will not
remain silent on the Sterling Decree. It will justify its orders with
a rationale. Does the University really consider itself forced by
the Founding Grant to prohibit student organizations from taking
“public stands on issues affecting affairs beyond the Stanford
campus without prior University approval? No, the Decree was
handed down because the University believes students incapable
or unwilling to define “partisan political activity” as timidly as
the University defines it. So the University will prevent student
organizations from saying anything on off-campus issues until the
University Censor approves the subject matter.
If the University claims that the Founding Grant prohibits
students (as opposed to the University corporation) from speak
ing collectively on off-campus issues, then the University had bet
ter do more than say so. It had better cite the attorneys who insist
that the courts will say so. Ami the attorneys had better say why
this interpretation is the one the courts will insist on.
If the University insists on claiming that the Founding Grant
binds it to the policy that “no student organization may . . . ,”
then the University should publish a well-reasoned statement on
what the University thinks is the ideal policy educationally—irrel
evant of the alleged prohibitions in the Founding Grant. Students
and faculty have the right to know the Administration’s educa
tional philosophy on the educational role of both public expression
and social action.
