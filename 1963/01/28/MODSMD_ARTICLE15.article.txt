# A 						Question of Right

### 
There is one point in the current controversy over student
rights which is likely to be obscured in the course of debate: the
issue at hand is not whether Legislature is competent to speak on
issues beyond the campus. Neither is the issue whether Legisla
ture is sufficiently representative to accurately reflect student
opinion on any given issue. Rather, the issue is whether under any
circumstances (when Legislature is both competent and repre
sentative) Legislature or any student organization has the right
to speak out. So the issue is one of right, not competence or repre
sentation, for surely there are occasions when it is unwise for
Legislature to exercise its right to speak out. But may the Univer
sity arbitrarily abridge this right?
