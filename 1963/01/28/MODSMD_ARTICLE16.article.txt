Editor, The Daily:
As a relative newcomer to the
Stanford scene, I may need some
instruction into the subtleties of
the current “dispute” between
the students and the administra
tion over expression of political
opinion. If, for example, there
are certain legal issues in rela
tion to the university charter
that are still being ironed out,
this may suggest that students
postpone their declarations at
least until the issues are clari
fied. But as far as the ultimate
issues involved are concerned,
there are surely no subtleties
whatever. The aim of any univer
sity worthy of the name must be
to create an atmosphere in which
students are encouraged, even
prodded if necessary, to express
themselves on public Issues and
to involve themselves, responsi
bly. in the life of the body poli
tic.

The thing I find most disturb
ing about higher education in
America is not the over-eager
ness of students to “take stands”
that might prove an embarrass
ment to an administration, but
their appalling lack of willing
ness to stand up and be counted
on controversial issues. Silence
and apathy in the face of issues
concerning the public good are
not indications that the student
“has his mind on education,” but
merely that he is failing to put
his education to good use. No edu
cated person has a right to the
luxury of timidity. A university,
in fact, should be more fearful
of a silent conformist student
body mirroring predictably mid
dle-of-the-road convictions, than
of a student body in which the
clash of opinions leads students

to public expression of convic
tions that are important to them.
If such public expression occa
sionally verges on the ridiculous
or the embarrassing, then the
university must be willing to suf
fer fools gladly, realizing that the
exposure of foolish convictions
can be away toward more
thoughtful convictions.
I have enough faith in what the
Stanford University atmosphere
can create in the way of informed
opinion and reasoned statement
of that opinion to hope for more,
rather than less, student expres
sion on the matters of freedom,
censorship, human dignity, mi
nority rights, and other issues
that must occupy the minds of all
morally sensitive persons.
If a university’s encourage
ment of students to think, speak
and act responsibly on public is
sues threatens to cost it some fi
nancial support, then all of us in
university communities had bet
ter be willing to lighten our belts
a bit before we decide to sell too
cheaply our heritage of free in
quiry and expression.
