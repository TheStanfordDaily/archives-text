# FRENCH STUDENT UNION ACTIVE
## French Student Organizations' Social Action Role Described 
### BERNARD C. GIRIN 
(Bernard C. Girin is an ASSU
Scholar from France, lie is study
ing - economics at Stanford.)
A book would be necessary to
relate the complete history of
French student syndicalism, and
several studies have been written
on the subject anyway. The only
ambition of this article is to re
call briefly its main characteris
tics and to present some reflec
tions suggested by a comparison
with the American student or
ganizations.
IN REGENT years, the French
student union (U.N.E.F.) has
gained worldwide attention for
its participation in French poli
tics. But it would be incorrect to
say that every French student
agreed with the political ideals of
U.N.E.F. The student movement
in France is divided, and the
goals of the movement are al
ways hotly debated. The princi
pal problem is to decide if the
union has the right to speak on
behalf of all the students on po
litical affairs, and to decide if
true syndicalism could avoid po
litical interference in reaching its
goals.
U.N.E. F., especially in the last
few years, committed itself to
left wing political ideals. Students
opposed to this commitment re
signed two years ago from the
union and formed a rival one
much more conservative, the
F.N.E.F. (National Federation of
French Students). But of the two,
U.N.E.F. is far more important
and I will speak mainly about
U.N.E.F. is far more inportant
different from American student
organizations. In effect U.N.E.F.
is organized like a labor-union, in
a “syndicalist” spirit; that means
that beside its material activities
v- administration of student
health services, student cafeter
ias, student cooperatives—it acts
like a pressure group in its re
lations with the Ministery of Na
tional Education in order to
reach its goals. For U.N.E.F., the
student is an “intellectual work
er,” not so different from other
workers. A recent debate over
“pre-salary” reveals this attitude.
BESIDE the system of scholar
ships which exists in France,
U.N.E.F. has asked that every
student regardless of his par
ents’ financial status receive this

presalary, (that is, stipendi mere
ly for studying. (The fact that
the student is still in his appren
ticeship explains the term “pre
salary”.! It claims that it is the
interest of the future of the
whole nation to help the students
to meet, even partially, their
needs and to achieve their goals.
Furthermore, pre-salaries would
help to promote greater equality
among students coming from dif
ferent classes. Although I think
that the French system of edu
cation is still far from being real
ly democratic—supplying every
body equal chances to learn—the
pre-salary, in my opinion, is not
the best idea of U.N.E.F. and I
am not sure it would be the best
means to reach this goal.
The U.N.E.F. has many varied
means of action. Through meet
ings and symposiums on specific
issues, the student body is kept
informed and students are asked
to express their views; the offi
cers who are democratically
elected—call press conferences,
initiate petitions, call for student
strikes and organize mass demon
strations (for instance, last year
a nation-wide, anti-OAS demon
stration) to call attention to seri
ous problems while publicizing
students’ opinions.
THEY ALSO have conferences
with the university deans on lo
cal issues and with the Minister
of Education on broad national
issues—they deal most of the
time with such social problems
as improved housing and restau
rants, reduction of transportation
fare, student medical aid, and
construction of new educational
equipment. How to explain this
special role of the French stu
dent organization?
Among the factors are the so
cial framework and the cultural
heritage, so different from the
American. Campus life is un
known to the French students.
Most of them are completely on
their own, not only in their
studies but also in everyday life.
So they participate more than the
American in the life of the soci
ety. The conception of student
life as divided only between
“work”—to have a good GPA—
and “fun”—many parties and
many dates —which seems very
important here, and which has
resulted in a lack of curiosity for
the outside world (the university

being a big fraternity) is not
very wide-spread among French
students. Perhaps because they
have more problems.
Also the educational system in
Fiance is unified under the au
thority of the Ministry of Educa
tion, the only organization au
thorized to give degrees and
nominate professors. There is no
rivalry among the several uni
versities since they all have the
same academic standing and give
degrees which have the same
value throughout the country
(the only element of rivalry
would be among the “Great
Schools”—engineering schools
but it is not very important).
This system fosters a sense of
national unity among the stu
dents who feel that they are in a
common situation with common
problems and goals.
FURTHERMORE, given the
centralized political organization
of the country, it is possible and
“efficient” to influence the poli
tical decision-makers, while in
this country, the federal system
has sot limits to the central pow
er, hence to the effect of pressur
ing it; in the U.S. also we have
greater obstacles to the political
commitment of student organiza
tions: the private nature of most
of the universities (where trus
tees are conservative); and the
campus life, which forbids po
litical activities on the ground
that politics must no) enter Uni
versity life. In France, students
may organize politically because
they all live outside the universi
ty anyway.
Some other factors explain the
importance of the U.N.E.F. which
has increased immensely in the
past few years. The general cri
sis of political parties has in
duced the youth to seek else
where—in the unions—for the po
litical experience that the parties
were unable to offer; in effect
most of them are still old in their
spirit, lacking the dynamism
which attracts the young. This
is a part of the general problem
of a certain crisis for democracy
in France, which explains in a
large measure the success of
President De Gaulle. The unions
have seen their political influence
increased in the past few years,
especially since 1958, and the
U.N.E.F. has profited from this
general trend. The unions are
supposed to represent the “real
country,” by opposition to the
“political class”—the parties. And
in fact the labor unions had an
important role in the mobiliza
tion of public opinion against the
0.A.5., and for the Gaullist solu
tion in Algeria.
Indeed the Algerian war is one
of the most important factors
which explains the political role
of U.N.E.F. This was a brutal
problem for the youth, who
could not avoid taking a position.
The attitude of the U.N.E.F. was
ivery definite; it has always asked
for negotiations with the FLN,
and has established friendly links
the Algerian organization of
students sponsored by the FLN.
Phis was criticized by a part of
public opinion and some students
(especially those believing in “Al
geria Francaise”), This was also
he reason why the last president
)f the U.N.E.F., Dominique Wal
lon, a student in political sci
ence, was not allowed by the gov
ernment to take part in the com
petitive examination for admis
sion to the E.N.A, (National
School of Administration), the
highest French school for the
training of civil servants.
THE U.N.E.F. had to deal with
the problem of a shortened draft
deferment. Because of the Algeri
an war, many students had to
join the Army before the end of
their studies and this was a
source of conflicts between the
student movement and the gov
ernment.
Another explanation for the in
creased importance of the stu
dent movement is the demo
graphic explosion. The children
born after the second world war
entered the universities which
were unprepared to receive so
great a number. So, in the same
time public opinion had to know
the importance, the dynamism of
the French youth, and also the
lack of educational facilities for
this youth.
Now that the Algerian war is
finished the activities of the
U.N.E.F. will be more normal.
Its ambition is to call students to
an effort of reflection about a
reform of education (its modern
ization), its democratization, (the
U.N.E.F. is opposed to the cam
pus system), and more generally
an effort to seek new structures
for democracy and to establish
more contacts with the youths of
other countries, especially the de
veloping areas of (he world, in
the spirit of pacific coexistence.
BUT THIS orientation of the
movement, if accepted in general,
will continue to be very contro
versial, the heart of the debate
being the conception of “students’
interests” and the role of the
students in the society. They are
young and irresponsible, and they
must learn and be quiet, say
some people; others say: it is
true, they are young and easily
excited, but they are the future
elite and they have the right to
speak.

pre-salary, in my opinion, is not
the best idea of U.N.E.F. and I
am not sure it would be the best
means to reach this goal.
The U.N.E.F. has many varied
means of action. Through meet
ings and symposiums on specific
issues, the student body is kept
informed and students are asked
to express their views; the offi
cers who are democratically
elected—call press conferences,
initiate petitions, call for student
strikes and organize mass demon
strations (for instance, last year
a nation-wide, anti-OAS demon
stration) to call attention to seri
ous problems while publicizing
students’ opinions.
THEY ALSO have conferences
with the university deans on lo
cal issues and with the Minister
of Education on broad national
issues—they deal most of the
time with such social problems
as improved housing and restau
rants, reduction of transportation
fare, student medical aid, and
construction of new educational
equipment. How to explain this
special role of the French stu
dent organization?
Among the factors are the so
cial framework and the cultural
heritage, so different from the
American. Campus life is un
known to the French students.
Most of them are completely on
their own, not only in their
studies but also in everyday life.
So they participate more than the
American in the life of the soci
ety. The conception of student
life as divided only between
“work”—to have a good GPA—
and “fun”—many parties and
many dates —which seems very
important here, and which has
resulted in a lack of curiosity for
the outside world (the university

being a big fraternity) is not
very wide-spread among French
students. Perhaps because they
have more problems.
Also the educational system in
Fiance is unified under the au
thority of the Ministry of Educa
tion, the only organization au
thorized to give degrees and
nominate professors. There is no
rivalry among the several uni
versities since they all have the
same academic standing and give
degrees which have the same
value throughout the country
(the only element of rivalry
would be among the “Great
Schools”—engineering schools
but it is not very important).
This system fosters a sense of
national unity among the stu
dents who feel that they are in a
common situation with common
problems and goals.
FURTHERMORE, given the
centralized political organization
of the country, it is possible and
“efficient” to influence the poli
tical decision-makers, while in
this country, the federal system
has sot limits to the central pow
er, hence to the effect of pressur
ing it; in the U.S. also we have
greater obstacles to the political
commitment of student organiza
tions: the private nature of most
of the universities (where trus
tees are conservative); and the
campus life, which forbids po
litical activities on the ground
that politics must no) enter Uni
versity life. In France, students
may organize politically because
they all live outside the universi
ty anyway.
Some other factors explain the
importance of the U.N.E.F. which
has increased immensely in the
past few years. The general cri
sis of political parties has in
duced the youth to seek else
where—in the unions—for the po
litical experience that the parties
were unable to offer; in effect
most of them are still old in their
spirit, lacking the dynamism
which attracts the young. This
is a part of the general problem
of a certain crisis for democracy
in France, which explains in a
large measure the success of
President De Gaulle. The unions
have seen their political influence
increased in the past few years,
especially since 1958, and the
U.N.E.F. has profited from this
general trend. The unions are
supposed to represent the “real
country,” by opposition to the
“political class”—the parties. And
in fact the labor unions had an
important role in the mobiliza
tion of public opinion against the
0.A.5., and for the Gaullist solu
tion in Algeria.
Indeed the Algerian war is one
of the most important factors
which explains the political role
of U.N.E.F. This was a brutal
problem for the youth, who
could not avoid taking a position.
The attitude of the U.N.E.F. was
ivery definite; it has always asked
for negotiations with the FLN,
and has established friendly links
the Algerian organization of
students sponsored by the FLN.
Phis was criticized by a part of
public opinion and some students
(especially those believing in “Al
geria Francaise”), This was also
he reason why the last president
)f the U.N.E.F., Dominique Wal
lon, a student in political sci
ence, was not allowed by the gov
ernment to take part in the com
petitive examination for admis
sion to the E.N.A, (National
School of Administration), the
highest French school for the
training of civil servants.
THE U.N.E.F. had to deal with
the problem of a shortened draft
deferment. Because of the Algeri
an war, many students had to
join the Army before the end of
their studies and this was a
source of conflicts between the
student movement and the gov
ernment.
Another explanation for the in
creased importance of the stu
dent movement is the demo
graphic explosion. The children
born after the second world war
entered the universities which
were unprepared to receive so
great a number. So, in the same
time public opinion had to know
the importance, the dynamism of
the French youth, and also the
lack of educational facilities for
this youth.
Now that the Algerian war is
finished the activities of the
U.N.E.F. will be more normal.
Its ambition is to call students to
an effort of reflection about a
reform of education (its modern
ization), its democratization, (the
U.N.E.F. is opposed to the cam
pus system), and more generally
an effort to seek new structures
for democracy and to establish
more contacts with the youths of
other countries, especially the de
veloping areas of (he world, in
the spirit of pacific coexistence.
BUT THIS orientation of the
movement, if accepted in general,
will continue to be very contro
versial, the heart of the debate
being the conception of “students’
interests” and the role of the
students in the society. They are
young and irresponsible, and they
must learn and be quiet, say
some people; others say: it is
true, they are young and easily
excited, but they are the future
elite and they have the right to
speak.

A book would be necessary to
relate the complete history of
French student syndicalism, and
several studies have been written
on the subject anyway. The only
ambition of this article is to re
call briefly its main characteris
tics and to present some reflec
tions suggested by a comparison
with the American student or
ganizations.
IN REGENT years, the French
student union (U.N.E.F.) has
gained worldwide attention for
its participation in French poli
tics. But it would be incorrect to
say that every French student
agreed with the political ideals of
U.N.E.F. The student movement
in France is divided, and the
goals of the movement are al
ways hotly debated. The princi
pal problem is to decide if the
union has the right to speak on
behalf of all the students on po
litical affairs, and to decide if
true syndicalism could avoid po
litical interference in reaching its
goals.
U.N.E. F., especially in the last
few years, committed itself to
left wing political ideals. Students
opposed to this commitment re
signed two years ago from the
union and formed a rival one
much more conservative, the
F.N.E.F. (National Federation of
French Students). But of the two,
U.N.E.F. is far more important
and I will speak mainly about
U.N.E.F. is far more inportant
different from American student
organizations. In effect U.N.E.F.
is organized like a labor-union, in
a “syndicalist” spirit; that means
that beside its material activities
v- administration of student
health services, student cafeter
ias, student cooperatives—it acts
like a pressure group in its re
lations with the Ministery of Na
tional Education in order to
reach its goals. For U.N.E.F., the
student is an “intellectual work
er,” not so different from other
workers. A recent debate over
“pre-salary” reveals this attitude.
BESIDE the system of scholar
ships which exists in France,
U.N.E.F. has asked that every
student regardless of his par
ents’ financial status receive this

presalary, (that is, stipendi mere
ly for studying. (The fact that
the student is still in his appren
ticeship explains the term “pre
salary”.! It claims that it is the
interest of the future of the
whole nation to help the students
to meet, even partially, their
needs and to achieve their goals.
Furthermore, pre-salaries would
help to promote greater equality
among students coming from dif
ferent classes. Although I think
that the French system of edu
cation is still far from being real
ly democratic—supplying every
body equal chances to learn—the
pre-salary, in my opinion, is not

that politics must no) enter Uni
versity life. In France, students
may organize politically because
they all live outside the universi
ty anyway.
Some other factors explain the
importance of the U.N.E.F. which
has increased immensely in the
past few years. The general cri
sis of political parties has in
duced the youth to seek else
where—in the unions—for the po
litical experience that the parties
were unable to offer; in effect
most of them are still old in their
spirit, lacking the dynamism
which attracts the young. This
is a part of the general problem
of a certain crisis for democracy
in France, which explains in a
large measure the success of
President De Gaulle. The unions
have seen their political influence
increased in the past few years,
especially since 1958, and the
U.N.E.F. has profited from this
general trend. The unions are
supposed to represent the “real
country,” by opposition to the
“political class”—the parties. And
in fact the labor unions had an
important role in the mobiliza
tion of public opinion against the
0.A.5., and for the Gaullist solu
tion in Algeria.
Indeed the Algerian war is one
of the most important factors
which explains the political role
of U.N.E.F. This was a brutal
problem for the youth, who
could not avoid taking a position.
The attitude of the U.N.E.F. was
ivery definite; it has always asked
for negotiations with the FLN,
and has established friendly links
the Algerian organization of
students sponsored by the FLN.
Phis was criticized by a part of
public opinion and some students
(especially those believing in “Al
geria Francaise”), This was also
he reason why the last president
)f the U.N.E.F., Dominique Wal
lon, a student in political sci
ence, was not allowed by the gov
ernment to take part in the com
petitive examination for admis
sion to the E.N.A, (National
School of Administration), the
highest French school for the
training of civil servants.
THE U.N.E.F. had to deal with
the problem of a shortened draft
deferment. Because of the Algeri
an war, many students had to
join the Army before the end of
their studies and this was a
source of conflicts between the
student movement and the gov
ernment.
Another explanation for the in
creased importance of the stu
dent movement is the demo
graphic explosion. The children
born after the second world war
entered the universities which
were unprepared to receive so
great a number. So, in the same
time public opinion had to know
the importance, the dynamism of
the French youth, and also the
lack of educational facilities for
this youth.
Now that the Algerian war is
finished the activities of the
U.N.E.F. will be more normal.
Its ambition is to call students to
an effort of reflection about a
reform of education (its modern
ization), its democratization, (the
U.N.E.F. is opposed to the cam
pus system), and more generally
an effort to seek new structures
for democracy and to establish
more contacts with the youths of
other countries, especially the de
veloping areas of (he world, in
the spirit of pacific coexistence.
BUT THIS orientation of the
movement, if accepted in general,
will continue to be very contro
versial, the heart of the debate
being the conception of “students’
interests” and the role of the
students in the society. They are
young and irresponsible, and they
must learn and be quiet, say
some people; others say: it is
true, they are young and easily
excited, but they are the future
elite and they have the right to
speak.

A book would be necessary to
relate the complete history of
French student syndicalism, and
several studies have been written
on the subject anyway. The only
ambition of this article is to re
call briefly its main characteris
tics and to present some reflec
tions suggested by a comparison
with the American student or
ganizations.
IN REGENT years, the French
student union (U.N.E.F.) has
gained worldwide attention for
its participation in French poli
tics. But it would be incorrect to
say that every French student
agreed with the political ideals of
U.N.E.F. The student movement
in France is divided, and the
goals of the movement are al
ways hotly debated. The princi
pal problem is to decide if the
union has the right to speak on
behalf of all the students on po
litical affairs, and to decide if
true syndicalism could avoid po
litical interference in reaching its
goals.
U.N.E. F., especially in the last
few years, committed itself to
left wing political ideals. Students
opposed to this commitment re
signed two years ago from the
union and formed a rival one
much more conservative, the
F.N.E.F. (National Federation of
French Students). But of the two,
U.N.E.F. is far more important
and I will speak mainly about
U.N.E.F. is far more inportant
different from American student
organizations. In effect U.N.E.F.
is organized like a labor-union, in
a “syndicalist” spirit; that means
that beside its material activities
v- administration of student
health services, student cafeter
ias, student cooperatives—it acts
like a pressure group in its re
lations with the Ministery of Na
tional Education in order to
reach its goals. For U.N.E.F., the
student is an “intellectual work
er,” not so different from other
workers. A recent debate over
“pre-salary” reveals this attitude.
BESIDE the system of scholar
ships which exists in France,
U.N.E.F. has asked that every
student regardless of his par
ents’ financial status receive this

presalary, (that is, stipendi mere
ly for studying. (The fact that
the student is still in his appren
ticeship explains the term “pre
salary”.! It claims that it is the
interest of the future of the
whole nation to help the students
to meet, even partially, their
needs and to achieve their goals.
Furthermore, pre-salaries would
help to promote greater equality
among students coming from dif
ferent classes. Although I think
that the French system of edu
cation is still far from being real
ly democratic—supplying every
body equal chances to learn—the
pre-salary, in my opinion, is not
the best idea of U.N.E.F. and I
am not sure it would be the best
means to reach this goal.
The U.N.E.F. has many varied
means of action. Through meet
ings and symposiums on specific
issues, the student body is kept
informed and students are asked
to express their views; the offi
cers who are democratically
elected—call press conferences,
initiate petitions, call for student
strikes and organize mass demon
strations (for instance, last year
a nation-wide, anti-OAS demon
stration) to call attention to seri
ous problems while publicizing
students’ opinions.
THEY ALSO have conferences
with the university deans on lo
cal issues and with the Minister
of Education on broad national
issues—they deal most of the
time with such social problems
as improved housing and restau
rants, reduction of transportation
fare, student medical aid, and
construction of new educational
equipment. How to explain this
special role of the French stu
dent organization?
Among the factors are the so
cial framework and the cultural
heritage, so different from the
American. Campus life is un
known to the French students.
Most of them are completely on
their own, not only in their
studies but also in everyday life.
So they participate more than the
American in the life of the soci
ety. The conception of student
life as divided only between
“work”—to have a good GPA—
and “fun”—many parties and
many dates —which seems very
important here, and which has
resulted in a lack of curiosity for
the outside world (the university

being a big fraternity) is not
very wide-spread among French
students. Perhaps because they
have more problems.
Also the educational system in
Fiance is unified under the au
thority of the Ministry of Educa
tion, the only organization au
thorized to give degrees and
nominate professors. There is no
rivalry among the several uni
versities since they all have the
same academic standing and give
degrees which have the same
value throughout the country
(the only element of rivalry
would be among the “Great
Schools”—engineering schools
but it is not very important).
This system fosters a sense of
national unity among the stu
dents who feel that they are in a
common situation with common
problems and goals.
FURTHERMORE, given the
centralized political organization
of the country, it is possible and
“efficient” to influence the poli
tical decision-makers, while in
this country, the federal system
has sot limits to the central pow
er, hence to the effect of pressur
ing it; in the U.S. also we have
greater obstacles to the political
commitment of student organiza
tions: the private nature of most
of the universities (where trus
tees are conservative); and the
campus life, which forbids po
litical activities on the ground
that politics must no) enter Uni
versity life. In France, students
may organize politically because
they all live outside the universi

an effort of reflection about a

for democracy and to establish

A book would be necessary to
relate the complete history of
French student syndicalism, and
several studies have been written
on the subject anyway. The only
ambition of this article is to re
call briefly its main characteris
tics and to present some reflec
tions suggested by a comparison
with the American student or
ganizations.
IN REGENT years, the French
student union (U.N.E.F.) has
gained worldwide attention for
its participation in French poli
tics. But it would be incorrect to
say that every French student
agreed with the political ideals of
U.N.E.F. The student movement
in France is divided, and the
goals of the movement are al
ways hotly debated. The princi
pal problem is to decide if the
union has the right to speak on
behalf of all the students on po
litical affairs, and to decide if
true syndicalism could avoid po
litical interference in reaching its
goals.
U.N.E. F., especially in the last
few years, committed itself to
left wing political ideals. Students
opposed to this commitment re
signed two years ago from the
union and formed a rival one
much more conservative, the
F.N.E.F. (National Federation of
French Students). But of the two,
U.N.E.F. is far more important
and I will speak mainly about
U.N.E.F. is far more inportant
different from American student
organizations. In effect U.N.E.F.
is organized like a labor-union, in
a “syndicalist” spirit; that means
that beside its material activities
v- administration of student
health services, student cafeter
ias, student cooperatives—it acts
like a pressure group in its re
lations with the Ministery of Na
tional Education in order to
reach its goals. For U.N.E.F., the
student is an “intellectual work
er,” not so different from other
workers. A recent debate over
“pre-salary” reveals this attitude.
BESIDE the system of scholar
ships which exists in France,
U.N.E.F. has asked that every
student regardless of his par
ents’ financial status receive this

presalary, (that is, stipendi mere
ly for studying. (The fact that
the student is still in his appren
ticeship explains the term “pre
salary”.! It claims that it is the
interest of the future of the
whole nation to help the students
to meet, even partially, their
needs and to achieve their goals.
Furthermore, pre-salaries would
help to promote greater equality
among students coming from dif
ferent classes. Although I think
that the French system of edu
cation is still far from being real
ly democratic—supplying every
body equal chances to learn—the
pre-salary, in my opinion, is not
the best idea of U.N.E.F. and I
am not sure it would be the best
means to reach this goal.
The U.N.E.F. has many varied
means of action. Through meet
ings and symposiums on specific
issues, the student body is kept
informed and students are asked
to express their views; the offi
cers who are democratically
elected—call press conferences,
initiate petitions, call for student
strikes and organize mass demon
strations (for instance, last year
a nation-wide, anti-OAS demon
stration) to call attention to seri
ous problems while publicizing
students’ opinions.
THEY ALSO have conferences
with the university deans on lo
cal issues and with the Minister
of Education on broad national
issues—they deal most of the
time with such social problems
as improved housing and restau
rants, reduction of transportation
fare, student medical aid, and
construction of new educational
equipment. How to explain this
special role of the French stu
dent organization?
Among the factors are the so
cial framework and the cultural
heritage, so different from the
American. Campus life is un
known to the French students.
Most of them are completely on
their own, not only in their
studies but also in everyday life.
So they participate more than the
American in the life of the soci
ety. The conception of student
life as divided only between
“work”—to have a good GPA—
and “fun”—many parties and
many dates —which seems very
important here, and which has
resulted in a lack of curiosity for
the outside world (the university

being a big fraternity) is not
very wide-spread among French
students. Perhaps because they
have more problems.
Also the educational system in
Fiance is unified under the au
thority of the Ministry of Educa
tion, the only organization au
thorized to give degrees and
nominate professors. There is no
rivalry among the several uni
versities since they all have the
same academic standing and give
degrees which have the same
value throughout the country
(the only element of rivalry
would be among the “Great
Schools”—engineering schools
but it is not very important).
This system fosters a sense of
national unity among the stu
dents who feel that they are in a
common situation with common
problems and goals.
FURTHERMORE, given the
centralized political organization
of the country, it is possible and
“efficient” to influence the poli
tical decision-makers, while in
this country, the federal system
has sot limits to the central pow
er, hence to the effect of pressur
ing it; in the U.S. also we have
greater obstacles to the political
commitment of student organiza
tions: the private nature of most
of the universities (where trus
tees are conservative); and the
campus life, which forbids po
litical activities on the ground
that politics must no) enter Uni
versity life. In France, students
may organize politically because
they all live outside the universi
ty anyway.
Some other factors explain the
importance of the U.N.E.F. which
has increased immensely in the
past few years. The general cri
sis of political parties has in
duced the youth to seek else
where—in the unions—for the po
litical experience that the parties
were unable to offer; in effect
most of them are still old in their
spirit, lacking the dynamism
which attracts the young. This
is a part of the general problem
of a certain crisis for democracy
in France, which explains in a
large measure the success of
President De Gaulle. The unions
have seen their political influence
increased in the past few years,
especially since 1958, and the
U.N.E.F. has profited from this
general trend. The unions are
supposed to represent the “real
country,” by opposition to the
“political class”—the parties. And
in fact the labor unions had an
important role in the mobiliza
tion of public opinion against the
0.A.5., and for the Gaullist solu
tion in Algeria.
Indeed the Algerian war is one
of the most important factors
which explains the political role
of U.N.E.F. This was a brutal
problem for the youth, who
could not avoid taking a position.
The attitude of the U.N.E.F. was
ivery definite; it has always asked
for negotiations with the FLN,
and has established friendly links
the Algerian organization of
students sponsored by the FLN.
Phis was criticized by a part of
public opinion and some students
(especially those believing in “Al
geria Francaise”), This was also
he reason why the last president
)f the U.N.E.F., Dominique Wal
lon, a student in political sci
ence, was not allowed by the gov
ernment to take part in the com
petitive examination for admis
sion to the E.N.A, (National
School of Administration), the
highest French school for the
training of civil servants.
THE U.N.E.F. had to deal with
the problem of a shortened draft
deferment. Because of the Algeri
an war, many students had to
join the Army before the end of
their studies and this was a
source of conflicts between the
student movement and the gov
ernment.
Another explanation for the in
creased importance of the stu
dent movement is the demo
graphic explosion. The children
born after the second world war
entered the universities which
were unprepared to receive so
great a number. So, in the same
time public opinion had to know
the importance, the dynamism of
the French youth, and also the
lack of educational facilities for
this youth.
Now that the Algerian war is
finished the activities of the
U.N.E.F. will be more normal.

er,” not so different from other
workers. A recent debate over
“pre-salary” reveals this attitude.
BESIDE the system of scholar
ships which exists in France,
U.N.E.F. has asked that every
student regardless of his par
ents’ financial status receive this

presalary, (that is, stipendi mere
ly for studying. (The fact that
the student is still in his appren
ticeship explains the term “pre
salary”.! It claims that it is the
interest of the future of the
whole nation to help the students
to meet, even partially, their
needs and to achieve their goals.
Furthermore, pre-salaries would
help to promote greater equality
among students coming from dif
ferent classes. Although I think
that the French system of edu
cation is still far from being real
ly democratic—supplying every
body equal chances to learn—the
pre-salary, in my opinion, is not
the best idea of U.N.E.F. and I
am not sure it would be the best
means to reach this goal.
The U.N.E.F. has many varied
means of action. Through meet
ings and symposiums on specific
issues, the student body is kept
informed and students are asked
to express their views; the offi
cers who are democratically
elected—call press conferences,
initiate petitions, call for student
strikes and organize mass demon
strations (for instance, last year
a nation-wide, anti-OAS demon
stration) to call attention to seri
ous problems while publicizing
students’ opinions.
THEY ALSO have conferences
with the university deans on lo
cal issues and with the Minister
of Education on broad national
issues—they deal most of the
time with such social problems
as improved housing and restau
rants, reduction of transportation
fare, student medical aid, and
construction of new educational
equipment. How to explain this
special role of the French stu
dent organization?
Among the factors are the so
cial framework and the cultural
heritage, so different from the
American. Campus life is un
known to the French students.
Most of them are completely on
their own, not only in their
studies but also in everyday life.
So they participate more than the
American in the life of the soci
ety. The conception of student
life as divided only between
“work”—to have a good GPA—
and “fun”—many parties and
many dates —which seems very
important here, and which has
resulted in a lack of curiosity for
the outside world (the university

being a big fraternity) is not
very wide-spread among French
students. Perhaps because they
have more problems.
Also the educational system in
Fiance is unified under the au
thority of the Ministry of Educa
tion, the only organization au
thorized to give degrees and
nominate professors. There is no
rivalry among the several uni
versities since they all have the
same academic standing and give
degrees which have the same
value throughout the country
(the only element of rivalry
would be among the “Great
Schools”—engineering schools
but it is not very important).
This system fosters a sense of
national unity among the stu
dents who feel that they are in a
common situation with common
problems and goals.
FURTHERMORE, given the
centralized political organization
of the country, it is possible and
“efficient” to influence the poli
tical decision-makers, while in
this country, the federal system
has sot limits to the central pow
er, hence to the effect of pressur
ing it; in the U.S. also we have
greater obstacles to the political
commitment of student organiza
tions: the private nature of most
of the universities (where trus
tees are conservative); and the
campus life, which forbids po
litical activities on the ground
that politics must no) enter Uni
versity life. In France, students
may organize politically because
they all live outside the universi
ty anyway.
Some other factors explain the
importance of the U.N.E.F. which
has increased immensely in the
past few years. The general cri
sis of political parties has in
duced the youth to seek else
where—in the unions—for the po
litical experience that the parties
were unable to offer; in effect
most of them are still old in their
spirit, lacking the dynamism
which attracts the young. This
is a part of the general problem
of a certain crisis for democracy
in France, which explains in a
large measure the success of
President De Gaulle. The unions
have seen their political influence
increased in the past few years,
especially since 1958, and the
U.N.E.F. has profited from this
general trend. The unions are
supposed to represent the “real
country,” by opposition to the
“political class”—the parties. And
in fact the labor unions had an
important role in the mobiliza
tion of public opinion against the
0.A.5., and for the Gaullist solu
tion in Algeria.
Indeed the Algerian war is one
of the most important factors
which explains the political role
of U.N.E.F. This was a brutal
problem for the youth, who
could not avoid taking a position.
The attitude of the U.N.E.F. was
ivery definite; it has always asked
for negotiations with the FLN,
and has established friendly links
the Algerian organization of
students sponsored by the FLN.
Phis was criticized by a part of
public opinion and some students
(especially those believing in “Al
geria Francaise”), This was also
he reason why the last president
)f the U.N.E.F., Dominique Wal
lon, a student in political sci
ence, was not allowed by the gov
ernment to take part in the com
petitive examination for admis
sion to the E.N.A, (National
School of Administration), the
highest French school for the
training of civil servants.
THE U.N.E.F. had to deal with
the problem of a shortened draft
deferment. Because of the Algeri
an war, many students had to
join the Army before the end of
their studies and this was a
source of conflicts between the
student movement and the gov
ernment.
Another explanation for the in
creased importance of the stu
dent movement is the demo
graphic explosion. The children
born after the second world war
entered the universities which
were unprepared to receive so
great a number. So, in the same
time public opinion had to know
the importance, the dynamism of
the French youth, and also the
lack of educational facilities for
this youth.
Now that the Algerian war is
finished the activities of the
U.N.E.F. will be more normal.
Its ambition is to call students to
an effort of reflection about a
reform of education (its modern
ization), its democratization, (the
U.N.E.F. is opposed to the cam
pus system), and more generally
an effort to seek new structures
for democracy and to establish
more contacts with the youths of
other countries, especially the de
veloping areas of (he world, in
the spirit of pacific coexistence.
BUT THIS orientation of the
movement, if accepted in general,
will continue to be very contro
versial, the heart of the debate
being the conception of “students’
interests” and the role of the
students in the society. They are
young and irresponsible, and they
must learn and be quiet, say
some people; others say: it is
true, they are young and easily
excited, but they are the future
elite and they have the right to
speak.

A book would be necessary to
relate the complete history of
French student syndicalism, and
several studies have been written
on the subject anyway. The only
ambition of this article is to re
call briefly its main characteris
tics and to present some reflec
tions suggested by a comparison
with the American student or
ganizations.
IN REGENT years, the French
student union (U.N.E.F.) has
gained worldwide attention for
its participation in French poli
tics. But it would be incorrect to
say that every French student
agreed with the political ideals of
U.N.E.F. The student movement
in France is divided, and the
goals of the movement are al
ways hotly debated. The princi
pal problem is to decide if the
union has the right to speak on
behalf of all the students on po
litical affairs, and to decide if
true syndicalism could avoid po
litical interference in reaching its
goals.
U.N.E. F., especially in the last
few years, committed itself to
left wing political ideals. Students
opposed to this commitment re
signed two years ago from the
union and formed a rival one
much more conservative, the
F.N.E.F. (National Federation of
French Students). But of the two,
U.N.E.F. is far more important
and I will speak mainly about
U.N.E.F. is far more inportant
different from American student
organizations. In effect U.N.E.F.
is organized like a labor-union, in
a “syndicalist” spirit; that means
that beside its material activities
v- administration of student
health services, student cafeter
ias, student cooperatives—it acts
like a pressure group in its re
lations with the Ministery of Na
tional Education in order to
reach its goals. For U.N.E.F., the
student is an “intellectual work

workers. A recent debate over

versities since they all have the
same academic standing and give
degrees which have the same
value throughout the country
(the only element of rivalry
would be among the “Great
Schools”—engineering schools
but it is not very important).
This system fosters a sense of
national unity among the stu
dents who feel that they are in a
common situation with common
problems and goals.
FURTHERMORE, given the
centralized political organization
of the country, it is possible and
“efficient” to influence the poli
tical decision-makers, while in
this country, the federal system
has sot limits to the central pow
er, hence to the effect of pressur
ing it; in the U.S. also we have
greater obstacles to the political
commitment of student organiza
tions: the private nature of most
of the universities (where trus
tees are conservative); and the
campus life, which forbids po
litical activities on the ground
that politics must no) enter Uni
versity life. In France, students
may organize politically because
they all live outside the universi
ty anyway.
Some other factors explain the
importance of the U.N.E.F. which
has increased immensely in the
past few years. The general cri
sis of political parties has in
duced the youth to seek else
where—in the unions—for the po
litical experience that the parties
were unable to offer; in effect
most of them are still old in their
spirit, lacking the dynamism
which attracts the young. This
is a part of the general problem
of a certain crisis for democracy
in France, which explains in a
large measure the success of
President De Gaulle. The unions
have seen their political influence
increased in the past few years,
especially since 1958, and the
U.N.E.F. has profited from this
general trend. The unions are
supposed to represent the “real
country,” by opposition to the
“political class”—the parties. And
in fact the labor unions had an
important role in the mobiliza
tion of public opinion against the
0.A.5., and for the Gaullist solu
tion in Algeria.
Indeed the Algerian war is one
of the most important factors
which explains the political role
of U.N.E.F. This was a brutal
problem for the youth, who
could not avoid taking a position.
The attitude of the U.N.E.F. was
ivery definite; it has always asked
for negotiations with the FLN,
and has established friendly links
the Algerian organization of
students sponsored by the FLN.
Phis was criticized by a part of
public opinion and some students
(especially those believing in “Al
geria Francaise”), This was also
he reason why the last president
)f the U.N.E.F., Dominique Wal
lon, a student in political sci
ence, was not allowed by the gov
ernment to take part in the com
petitive examination for admis
sion to the E.N.A, (National
School of Administration), the
highest French school for the
training of civil servants.
THE U.N.E.F. had to deal with
the problem of a shortened draft
deferment. Because of the Algeri
an war, many students had to
join the Army before the end of
their studies and this was a
source of conflicts between the
student movement and the gov
ernment.
Another explanation for the in
creased importance of the stu
dent movement is the demo
graphic explosion. The children
born after the second world war
entered the universities which
were unprepared to receive so
great a number. So, in the same
time public opinion had to know
the importance, the dynamism of
the French youth, and also the
lack of educational facilities for
this youth.
Now that the Algerian war is
finished the activities of the
U.N.E.F. will be more normal.
Its ambition is to call students to
an effort of reflection about a
reform of education (its modern
ization), its democratization, (the
U.N.E.F. is opposed to the cam
pus system), and more generally
an effort to seek new structures
for democracy and to establish
more contacts with the youths of
other countries, especially the de
veloping areas of (he world, in
the spirit of pacific coexistence.
BUT THIS orientation of the
movement, if accepted in general,
will continue to be very contro
versial, the heart of the debate
being the conception of “students’
interests” and the role of the
students in the society. They are
young and irresponsible, and they
must learn and be quiet, say
some people; others say: it is
true, they are young and easily
excited, but they are the future
elite and they have the right to
speak.
