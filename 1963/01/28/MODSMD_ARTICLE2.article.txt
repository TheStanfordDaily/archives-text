# Pettit Speaks Of Humanities Sciences Gap
## 
### PATRICIA LONG 
The humanities are not intel
lectually superior to the sciences,
nor vice-versa, although the gulf
between these two fields has not
yet successfully been bridged, said
Dean Joseph M. Pettit of the
School of Engineering in a talk
last night in the Arroyo lounge of
Wilbur Hall on “Science vs. Hu
manities at Stanford.’’

The humanities are underprivi
lodged at Stanford, he asserted,
because of the availability of gov
ernment funds for scientific re
search, but an effort is being made
to upgrade them.
SCIENCE, however, is not just
a means of obtaining material
benefits or more effective weap
ons, Pettit said, but a probing that
enables one to get at the secrets
of knowledge. He pointed out the
difference between pure science
(knowledge) such as physics, and
applied science (service) such
as medicine.

Discussing the role of the uni
versity in uniting the sciences and
humanities, he said that it must
offer “culture for the scientist and
science for the liberal arts stu
dent.”

PETTIT flenied that the “pub
lish or perish” method is used in
choosing or promoting professors.
An instructor must both want to
work with students and engage in
research. The Engineering School
uses students’ evaluations as one
way of determining a professor’s
teaching effectiveness, he said.

In reply to a question, Pettit
said that individual students or
professors may present their own
views on public matters, but
should not claim to be represent
ing any group unless they have
unanimous consent of that group.
