### RON BASS Contributing Editor 
An incident such as the one prompted by the KPFA Resolution
brings instant and violent emotion. Those involved are so quickly
reduced to defending basic ideals that facts and issues are often
lost in swelling campus enthusiasm.
A week ago last Thursday, LASSU tabled a resolution con-

cerning the Senate investigation"
of KPFA. Armin Rosehcranz
then wrote to Thomas Dodd and
Newton Minow expressing
“grave concern” over the investi
gation. Dean H, Donald Winbig
ler wrote Rosencranz saying: “At
the request of the President of
the University, I am writing to
inform you that pending the poli
cy review and until further no
tice, Stanford student organiza
tions may not take public stands
on issues affecting affairs beyond
the Stanford campus without pri
or University approval.”
THIS MEANS that President
J. E. Wallace Sterling has for
bidden student organizations to
take any stand on any off-cam
pus issue until the University
gives them permission to do so.
That is quite an impressive de
cree; a decree which LASSU de
fied by its resolution of January
24. In contrast to other recent
student - administration crises,
this situation sees the adminis
tration finally on the defensive.
The administration decided their
course of action on the Liquor
Policy and all the students could
really do was complain. Here,
LASSU has the initiative. They
can fire off as many resolutions
as they wish, and the adminis
tration must find away to stop
those resolutions to which they
object. The alternatives of such
an outright clash would lead to
unfortunate consequences for
everyone involved, with publicity
doing more damage to the Uni
versity's reputation than any
number of student resolutions.
The Senate investigation of
KPFA will involve a concept very
central to the differing ideolo
gies of modern states —the im
portance of the right of free
speech. A University must allow
students a chance for critical ex
amination of their basic values,
and free speech would indeed
seem to be one of those values.
It is not surprising that many
find ironic the inability of stu
dent organizations to assert their
concern over the right of free
speech because the University re
fuses to give them permission to
express these opinions.
WHY WOIJIJ) a University de
mand categorical censorship
rights over such stands of stu
dent organizations? One reason
may be that they fear the stands
of LASSU might be mistaken for
the stands of the University. This
introduces the question of the
role of free and honest expres
sion in education, To subordinate

such expression to the ignorance
of those who may jump to falsej
conclusions might be considered
a strange position for an edu
cator. If the University feels that 1
outsiders do not realize that stu
dent opinion is not that of the
University, then the administra
tion should make statements to
that effect as often and as loudly
as they feel necessary. Whatever
the influence of these outsiders,
whatever their opinions of Stan
ford. whatever their financial
contributions—the University is
going to have to weigh the value
of their influence, opinions and
money against other values. The
University is going to have a
very basic decision to make con
cerning what is really important
to Stanford.
To fall back upon the Founding
Grant would be an evasion. The
Founding Grant says, “the Uni
versity must be forever main
tained upon a strictly non-parti
san and non-sectarian, basis.”
The word “non-partisan” is clear
ly the key. It is explained in the
next sentence which states that
the University “must never be
come an instrument in the hands
of any political party or any re
ligious sect or organization.”
This could be followed with an
explanation from the Latin prov
ing that “partisan” must refer to
“party.” This would hardly qual
ify LASSU’s expression of grave
concern over protection of free
speech as a partisan activity. It
would be nothing short of hypoc
risy to call such a resolution
“partisan” while excusing the
University’s mailing of postcards
urging a “yes” vote on Proposi
tion 13. There was a subtle differ
ence; the postcards were very
good for business.
MUCH MOKE important is the
fact that the Founding Grant
cannot absolve the administra
tion of their clear responsibility,
They are the policy-makers of
this' University. If they believe
that a University must allow its
students to deliberate on public
issues and to freely and honestly
express their convictions, if Pres
ident Sterling and the Board of
Trustees feel that the presence of
such an atmosphere is essential
to the educative process, then
they must do everything in their
power to create such an atmos
phere.
If there is something that is to
be valued more highly, then they
must tell us what that something
is.

that effect as often and as loudly
as they feel necessary. Whatever
the influence of these outsiders,
whatever their opinions of Stan
ford. whatever their financial
contributions—the University is
going to have to weigh the value
of their influence, opinions and
money against other values. The
University is going to have a
very basic decision to make con
cerning what is really important
to Stanford.
To fall back upon the Founding
Grant would be an evasion. The
Founding Grant says, “the Uni
versity must be forever main
tained upon a strictly non-parti
san and non-sectarian, basis.”
The word “non-partisan” is clear
ly the key. It is explained in the
next sentence which states that
the University “must never be
come an instrument in the hands
of any political party or any re
ligious sect or organization.”
This could be followed with an
explanation from the Latin prov
ing that “partisan” must refer to
“party.” This would hardly qual
ify LASSU’s expression of grave
concern over protection of free
speech as a partisan activity. It
would be nothing short of hypoc
risy to call such a resolution
“partisan” while excusing the
University’s mailing of postcards
urging a “yes” vote on Proposi
tion 13. There was a subtle differ
ence; the postcards were very
good for business.
MUCH MOKE important is the
fact that the Founding Grant
cannot absolve the administra
tion of their clear responsibility,
They are the policy-makers of
this' University. If they believe
that a University must allow its
students to deliberate on public
issues and to freely and honestly
express their convictions, if Pres
ident Sterling and the Board of
Trustees feel that the presence of
such an atmosphere is essential
to the educative process, then
they must do everything in their
power to create such an atmos
phere.
If there is something that is to
be valued more highly, then they
must tell us what that something
is.
An incident such as the one prompted by the KPFA Resolution
brings instant and violent emotion. Those involved are so quickly
reduced to defending basic ideals that facts and issues are often
lost in swelling campus enthusiasm.
A week ago last Thursday, LASSU tabled a resolution con-

cerning the Senate investigation"
of KPFA. Armin Rosehcranz
then wrote to Thomas Dodd and
Newton Minow expressing
“grave concern” over the investi
gation. Dean H, Donald Winbig
ler wrote Rosencranz saying: “At
the request of the President of
the University, I am writing to
inform you that pending the poli
cy review and until further no
tice, Stanford student organiza
tions may not take public stands
on issues affecting affairs beyond
the Stanford campus without pri
or University approval.”
THIS MEANS that President
J. E. Wallace Sterling has for
bidden student organizations to
take any stand on any off-cam
pus issue until the University
gives them permission to do so.
That is quite an impressive de
cree; a decree which LASSU de
fied by its resolution of January
24. In contrast to other recent
student - administration crises,
this situation sees the adminis
tration finally on the defensive.
The administration decided their
course of action on the Liquor
Policy and all the students could
really do was complain. Here,
LASSU has the initiative. They
can fire off as many resolutions
as they wish, and the adminis
tration must find away to stop
those resolutions to which they
object. The alternatives of such
an outright clash would lead to
unfortunate consequences for
everyone involved, with publicity
doing more damage to the Uni
versity's reputation than any
number of student resolutions.
The Senate investigation of
KPFA will involve a concept very
central to the differing ideolo
gies of modern states —the im
portance of the right of free
speech. A University must allow
students a chance for critical ex
amination of their basic values,
and free speech would indeed
seem to be one of those values.
It is not surprising that many
find ironic the inability of stu
dent organizations to assert their
concern over the right of free
speech because the University re
fuses to give them permission to
express these opinions.
WHY WOIJIJ) a University de
mand categorical censorship
rights over such stands of stu
dent organizations? One reason
may be that they fear the stands
of LASSU might be mistaken for
the stands of the University. This
introduces the question of the
role of free and honest expres
sion in education, To subordinate

such expression to the ignorance
of those who may jump to falsej
conclusions might be considered
a strange position for an edu
cator. If the University feels that 1
outsiders do not realize that stu

University, then the administra

take any stand on any off-cam
pus issue until the University
gives them permission to do so.
That is quite an impressive de
cree; a decree which LASSU de
fied by its resolution of January
24. In contrast to other recent
student - administration crises,
this situation sees the adminis
tration finally on the defensive.
The administration decided their
course of action on the Liquor
Policy and all the students could
really do was complain. Here,
LASSU has the initiative. They
can fire off as many resolutions
as they wish, and the adminis
tration must find away to stop
those resolutions to which they
object. The alternatives of such
an outright clash would lead to
unfortunate consequences for
everyone involved, with publicity
doing more damage to the Uni
versity's reputation than any
number of student resolutions.
The Senate investigation of
KPFA will involve a concept very
central to the differing ideolo
gies of modern states —the im
portance of the right of free
speech. A University must allow
students a chance for critical ex
amination of their basic values,
and free speech would indeed
seem to be one of those values.
It is not surprising that many
find ironic the inability of stu
dent organizations to assert their
concern over the right of free
speech because the University re
fuses to give them permission to
express these opinions.
WHY WOIJIJ) a University de
mand categorical censorship
rights over such stands of stu
dent organizations? One reason
may be that they fear the stands
of LASSU might be mistaken for
the stands of the University. This
introduces the question of the
role of free and honest expres
sion in education, To subordinate

such expression to the ignorance
of those who may jump to falsej
conclusions might be considered
a strange position for an edu
cator. If the University feels that 1
outsiders do not realize that stu
dent opinion is not that of the
University, then the administra
tion should make statements to
that effect as often and as loudly
as they feel necessary. Whatever
the influence of these outsiders,
whatever their opinions of Stan
ford. whatever their financial
contributions—the University is
going to have to weigh the value
of their influence, opinions and
money against other values. The
University is going to have a
very basic decision to make con
cerning what is really important
to Stanford.
To fall back upon the Founding
Grant would be an evasion. The
Founding Grant says, “the Uni
versity must be forever main
tained upon a strictly non-parti
san and non-sectarian, basis.”
The word “non-partisan” is clear
ly the key. It is explained in the
next sentence which states that
the University “must never be
come an instrument in the hands
of any political party or any re
ligious sect or organization.”
This could be followed with an
explanation from the Latin prov
ing that “partisan” must refer to
“party.” This would hardly qual
ify LASSU’s expression of grave
concern over protection of free
speech as a partisan activity. It
would be nothing short of hypoc
risy to call such a resolution
“partisan” while excusing the
University’s mailing of postcards
urging a “yes” vote on Proposi
tion 13. There was a subtle differ
ence; the postcards were very
good for business.
MUCH MOKE important is the
fact that the Founding Grant
cannot absolve the administra
tion of their clear responsibility,
They are the policy-makers of
this' University. If they believe
that a University must allow its
students to deliberate on public
issues and to freely and honestly
express their convictions, if Pres
ident Sterling and the Board of
Trustees feel that the presence of
such an atmosphere is essential
to the educative process, then
they must do everything in their
power to create such an atmos
phere.
If there is something that is to
be valued more highly, then they
must tell us what that something
is.
An incident such as the one prompted by the KPFA Resolution
brings instant and violent emotion. Those involved are so quickly
reduced to defending basic ideals that facts and issues are often
lost in swelling campus enthusiasm.
A week ago last Thursday, LASSU tabled a resolution con-

cerning the Senate investigation"
of KPFA. Armin Rosehcranz
then wrote to Thomas Dodd and
Newton Minow expressing
“grave concern” over the investi
gation. Dean H, Donald Winbig
ler wrote Rosencranz saying: “At
the request of the President of
the University, I am writing to
inform you that pending the poli
cy review and until further no
tice, Stanford student organiza
tions may not take public stands
on issues affecting affairs beyond
the Stanford campus without pri
or University approval.”
THIS MEANS that President
J. E. Wallace Sterling has for
bidden student organizations to
take any stand on any off-cam
pus issue until the University
gives them permission to do so.
