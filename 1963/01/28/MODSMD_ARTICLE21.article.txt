Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations to the Legisla
ture which I hope is truly repre
sentative of tile student body,
for its resolution re the Senate
Committee “investigating” KPFA
and the Pacifica Foundation.

To my way of thinking. Legis
lature’s resolution is an emphatic
re-assertion of Stanford’s motto.
I believe Dr. David Starr Jordan
would be proud to know that
Stanford’s undergraduates do not
merely look at the legend on the
Stanford seal. Surely, if the
“winds of freedom” are to con
tinue to blow, it is university stu
dents, administrators, and facul
ty who must continually be on
the alert to see that they do.
Stanford should be proud that its
students are not apathetic, smug
members of an insular campus,
but are deeply concerned with
the issues of the day and anxious
to have a part in determining
them.

Editor, The Daily;
The recent action of the admin
istration in the KPFA controver
sy was typical. That of the ASSU
was not. We can be thankful for
the increasing intellectual integ
rity and maturity of the ASSU.
We can hope for the same from
the administration. Lest it be fear
ed that there is no precedent up
on which to base such hope, let
me quote from a letter which I
received recently from the chair
man of the Department of Philos
ophy at Antioch College in Ohio.
“Antioch zealously sustains the
right of the citizen-student or fac
ulty to engage responsibly in po
litical and social discussion and
action. . ; . Education is not seen
as something created exclusively
in the classroom, nor as a matter
of bits and pieces, but as some
thing emerging from the diverse
ecology of life experience; a sus
tained effort by individuals over
a period of time in an environ
ment in which everyone and
everything may boar on the edu
cational process.”

While wo share little concern
about the ominous “improper in
volvement (s) of the University’s
name” foreseen by the adminis
tration, we question the propriety
of the recent actions of Mr. Ro
sencranz and his legislature pur
porting to represent the student
body on political issues.
Stanford students certainly
have the right and Iho obligation
to “speak out, individually and
collectively” on matters of pub
lic concern, and, wo might add, to
participate in partisan efforts to
realize their views here on cam
pus. But the issue which concerns
us is not only the infringement
on the rights of the students, but
also the presumption of our
ASSU officials to take non-repre
sentative political stands in our
name.

In none of last year’s cam
paigns for student office do we
recall any candidate who at
tempted to outline his views on
political issues. Yet these same
representatives seem to consider
their election a mandate to com
mit the student body to specific
policies. Although we happen to
agree with the policies presented
recently by LASSU, we disagree
with their unwarranted enact
ment.
If LASSU's constituents want

to turn the legislature into a for
um for political debate, so be it.
But they must be prepared for
the entry of all the political ac
tion groups in the area into the
selections of representatives and
officials.

Stanford University appears to
be facd with a true dilemma: to
raise the funds wdth which to at
tract great professors and build
on outstanding physical plant, it
must censor the expression of
views by its academic community
so as not to offend the contribu
tors of those funds.
The greatness of a university
is inherent in the greatness of
its faculty and student body. For,
lake away a university’s great
professors and carefully selected
student body, take away the free
dom of communication among its
students, their teachers, and the
outside world, and the remaining
physical plant, no matter how
costly, is nothing but an empty
shell. If this university is truly
great, its teachers and students
will reserve the right to speak in
dividually, in groups, and as a
body, and they will reserve the
right to use the name of the uni
versity which they constitute. It
is nothing less than the responsi
bility of every member of Stan
ford’s academic community to
back the right of LASSU to pass
such a resolution as the one pass
ed Thursday expressing Legisla
ture’s concern over the possible
consequences of the Senate in
vestigation of KPFA.
If we do not, if we sacrifice our
right to the hope of raising more
money to attract more great pro
fessors, then our image will suf
fer. And it will very likely follow
that the truly great professors
will refuse to teach here after
all. Stanford is presenting an im
age to the nation’s academic com
munity as well as to the nation’s
wealthy. Let us not sacrifice one
to the other.

The recent investigation of
KPFA radio and the subsequent
delay in the renewal of the sta
tion's broadcasting license has
once again focused attention on
the question of whether or not in
a free, open, and democratic soci
ety there can ever be a limitation
on the expression of the whole
range of political viewpoints and
opinions. The subversive appeals
of leftists and rightists have
caused consternation for many a
liberal and the reflective conserv
ative as well, for a person of
either political orientation is
equally as concerned with the
preservation of the liberties
which we can enjoy in our demo
cratic society and that disappear
in the more absolutist or modern
totalitarian stales.
One of the foundation stones
of a democracy, however, is the
maintenance of a means whereby
a minority opinion can become a
majority. It is on this point that
the dichotomy between the con
servative and the liberal position
arises. Whereas conservatives
have generally been more con
cerned with protecting the preva
lent majority opinion, liberals
have placed greater empsasis on
the unrestricted expression of mi
nority views as well, based on a
more absolute interpretation of
the first amendment.

If a truly democratic and open
society is to survive, we must

place faith in the desire of all
American citizens to maintain
the freedoms we possess, even if
they advocate the promulgation
of all political opinions. We must
be devoted to the principle that
the people, once informed of all
points of view, are capable of de
termining their sovereign respon
sibilities.

Pacifica Radio has been dedi
cated to serving the function of
providing its audience the fullest
and broadest coverage of thought
and has trusted to the sophistica
tion of its listeners to determine
those views that truly support
our democratic traditions. The un
derlying philosophy of investiga
tions by such committees as the
Senate Internal Security Sub
committee and HU AC is basically
anti-democratic for it removes
from the people the sovereign
right to determine what is truth.
In such a case it becomes govern
ment’s responsibility to decide
what is true and to impose upon
us such an official truth. It seems
to me that the desire to reserve
this responsibility for our citi
zens, rather than our govern
ment, should find undivided sup
port among both liberals and
conservatives.
Martin Lebowitz
Editor, The Daily:
The action of Armin Rosen
cranz and LASSU in recent days
has been a couse of consternation
and dismay for a large propor
tion of the student community.
Mr. Rosencranz seemingly has
forgotten the limit to our free
doms that we voluntarily impose
upon entrance to the university
to enjoy the privilege of attend
ance. He lias forgotten his con
j sent, and therefore obligation, as
a member of the student body, to
I act within the given framework,
I defined for him beyond question
of misinterpretation by Dean
Winbigler, or act in clear viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Yet even if we assume for the
sake of argument that the obli
gation accrued toward the univer
sity on entrance did not hold in
this case, Mr. Rosencranz’s argu
ments are still unsound.
In “The Associated Student's
Position on Social Action and Its
Role in the Educational Process”
which he drafted, he fails to In
dicate how the individual’s re
sponsibility to be informed and
to act on the vital questions of
the day (with which I heartily
concur) can in any way be con
strued as an obligation of the As
sociated Students or, more par
ticularly, as an obligation of their
legislature. How he can argue
that an assemblage elected to act
on a narrow range of local issues
is competent to make pronounce
ments on “the greater problems
and issues of national and inter
national life” is beyond logical
comprehension.
His thesis that action in itself,
whether ' based on rational
thought or not, is of value typi
fies the fundamental fallacies on
which present day liberals build
their ideological castles. His mis
conception of existentialist doc
trine, which sees virtue in action
only when it is based on an un
derstanding of the meaning of
existence (its absurdity), does lit
tle to help his case. One does not
know whther he is merely mis
informed or intellectually dis
honest.

His letter to Senator Dodd and
Mr. Mintow (sic) is one vast con
tradiction. He seems to limit the
very “right to search and ques
tion freely” which he calls “fun
damental to academic freedom in
America.” Does the United States
Senate and Chairman Dodd
(whose 73 per cent ADA rating,
sadly for Walter Lippmann and
Scotty Reston, precludes the
bandying around of the tried and
true "right wing lunatic fringe
extremist” epitaph) (sic) not
have this fundamental freedom?
One would think Mr. Rosencranz
would embrace this investigation
in the name of academic freedom,
lather than condemn it. Appar
ently the Senate, with its vastly
greater facilities for information
gathering, is not to be allowed to
make a decision Mr. Rosencranz
has.
It is indeed represensible that
power hungry demagogues seek
to overstep their bounds, pro

polled by their delusions. It is in
deed reprehensible that 20 indi
viduals should attempt to legis
late on what essentially is a mor
al question to be decided by each
of us separately. It is indeed rep
rehensible that Mr. Rosencranz
apparently forgets that he was
elected, not deified, last spring.

Congratulations to the Legisla
ture which I hope is truly repre
sentative of tile student body,
for its resolution re the Senate
Committee “investigating” KPFA
and the Pacifica Foundation.

To my way of thinking. Legis
lature’s resolution is an emphatic
re-assertion of Stanford’s motto.
I believe Dr. David Starr Jordan
would be proud to know that
Stanford’s undergraduates do not
merely look at the legend on the
Stanford seal. Surely, if the
“winds of freedom” are to con
tinue to blow, it is university stu
dents, administrators, and facul
ty who must continually be on
the alert to see that they do.
Stanford should be proud that its
students are not apathetic, smug
members of an insular campus,
but are deeply concerned with
the issues of the day and anxious
to have a part in determining
them.

The recent action of the admin
istration in the KPFA controver
sy was typical. That of the ASSU
was not. We can be thankful for
the increasing intellectual integ
rity and maturity of the ASSU.
We can hope for the same from
the administration. Lest it be fear
ed that there is no precedent up
on which to base such hope, let
me quote from a letter which I
received recently from the chair
man of the Department of Philos
ophy at Antioch College in Ohio.
“Antioch zealously sustains the
right of the citizen-student or fac
ulty to engage responsibly in po
litical and social discussion and
action. . ; . Education is not seen
as something created exclusively
in the classroom, nor as a matter
of bits and pieces, but as some
thing emerging from the diverse
ecology of life experience; a sus
tained effort by individuals over
a period of time in an environ
ment in which everyone and
everything may boar on the edu
cational process.”

While wo share little concern
about the ominous “improper in
volvement (s) of the University’s
name” foreseen by the adminis
tration, we question the propriety
of the recent actions of Mr. Ro
sencranz and his legislature pur
porting to represent the student
body on political issues.
Stanford students certainly
have the right and Iho obligation
to “speak out, individually and
collectively” on matters of pub
lic concern, and, wo might add, to
participate in partisan efforts to
realize their views here on cam
pus. But the issue which concerns
us is not only the infringement
on the rights of the students, but
also the presumption of our
ASSU officials to take non-repre
sentative political stands in our
name.

In none of last year’s cam
paigns for student office do we
recall any candidate who at
tempted to outline his views on
political issues. Yet these same
representatives seem to consider
their election a mandate to com
mit the student body to specific
policies. Although we happen to
agree with the policies presented
recently by LASSU, we disagree
with their unwarranted enact
ment.
If LASSU's constituents want

to turn the legislature into a for
um for political debate, so be it.
But they must be prepared for
the entry of all the political ac
tion groups in the area into the
selections of representatives and
officials.

Stanford University appears to
be facd with a true dilemma: to
raise the funds wdth which to at
tract great professors and build
on outstanding physical plant, it
must censor the expression of
views by its academic community
so as not to offend the contribu
tors of those funds.
The greatness of a university
is inherent in the greatness of
its faculty and student body. For,
lake away a university’s great
professors and carefully selected
student body, take away the free
dom of communication among its
students, their teachers, and the
outside world, and the remaining
physical plant, no matter how
costly, is nothing but an empty
shell. If this university is truly
great, its teachers and students
will reserve the right to speak in
dividually, in groups, and as a
body, and they will reserve the
right to use the name of the uni
versity which they constitute. It
is nothing less than the responsi
bility of every member of Stan
ford’s academic community to
back the right of LASSU to pass
such a resolution as the one pass
ed Thursday expressing Legisla
ture’s concern over the possible
consequences of the Senate in
vestigation of KPFA.
If we do not, if we sacrifice our
right to the hope of raising more
money to attract more great pro
fessors, then our image will suf
fer. And it will very likely follow
that the truly great professors
will refuse to teach here after
all. Stanford is presenting an im
age to the nation’s academic com
munity as well as to the nation’s
wealthy. Let us not sacrifice one
to the other.

The recent investigation of
KPFA radio and the subsequent
delay in the renewal of the sta
tion's broadcasting license has
once again focused attention on
the question of whether or not in
a free, open, and democratic soci
ety there can ever be a limitation
on the expression of the whole
range of political viewpoints and
opinions. The subversive appeals
of leftists and rightists have
caused consternation for many a
liberal and the reflective conserv
ative as well, for a person of
either political orientation is
equally as concerned with the
preservation of the liberties
which we can enjoy in our demo
cratic society and that disappear
in the more absolutist or modern
totalitarian stales.
One of the foundation stones
of a democracy, however, is the
maintenance of a means whereby
a minority opinion can become a
majority. It is on this point that
the dichotomy between the con
servative and the liberal position
arises. Whereas conservatives
have generally been more con
cerned with protecting the preva
lent majority opinion, liberals
have placed greater empsasis on
the unrestricted expression of mi
nority views as well, based on a
more absolute interpretation of
the first amendment.

If a truly democratic and open
society is to survive, we must

place faith in the desire of all
American citizens to maintain
the freedoms we possess, even if
they advocate the promulgation
of all political opinions. We must
be devoted to the principle that
the people, once informed of all
points of view, are capable of de
termining their sovereign respon
sibilities.

Pacifica Radio has been dedi
cated to serving the function of
providing its audience the fullest
and broadest coverage of thought
and has trusted to the sophistica
tion of its listeners to determine
those views that truly support
our democratic traditions. The un
derlying philosophy of investiga
tions by such committees as the
Senate Internal Security Sub
committee and HU AC is basically
anti-democratic for it removes
from the people the sovereign
right to determine what is truth.
In such a case it becomes govern
ment’s responsibility to decide
what is true and to impose upon
us such an official truth. It seems
to me that the desire to reserve
this responsibility for our citi
zens, rather than our govern
ment, should find undivided sup
port among both liberals and
conservatives.
Martin Lebowitz
Editor, The Daily:
The action of Armin Rosen
cranz and LASSU in recent days
has been a couse of consternation
and dismay for a large propor
tion of the student community.
Mr. Rosencranz seemingly has
forgotten the limit to our free
doms that we voluntarily impose
upon entrance to the university
to enjoy the privilege of attend
ance. He lias forgotten his con
j sent, and therefore obligation, as
a member of the student body, to
I act within the given framework,
I defined for him beyond question
of misinterpretation by Dean
Winbigler, or act in clear viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Yet even if we assume for the
sake of argument that the obli
gation accrued toward the univer
sity on entrance did not hold in
this case, Mr. Rosencranz’s argu
ments are still unsound.
In “The Associated Student's
Position on Social Action and Its
Role in the Educational Process”
which he drafted, he fails to In
dicate how the individual’s re
sponsibility to be informed and
to act on the vital questions of
the day (with which I heartily
concur) can in any way be con
strued as an obligation of the As
sociated Students or, more par
ticularly, as an obligation of their
legislature. How he can argue
that an assemblage elected to act
on a narrow range of local issues
is competent to make pronounce
ments on “the greater problems
and issues of national and inter
national life” is beyond logical
comprehension.
His thesis that action in itself,
whether ' based on rational
thought or not, is of value typi
fies the fundamental fallacies on
which present day liberals build
their ideological castles. His mis
conception of existentialist doc
trine, which sees virtue in action
only when it is based on an un
derstanding of the meaning of
existence (its absurdity), does lit
tle to help his case. One does not
know whther he is merely mis
informed or intellectually dis
honest.

His letter to Senator Dodd and
Mr. Mintow (sic) is one vast con
tradiction. He seems to limit the
very “right to search and ques
tion freely” which he calls “fun
damental to academic freedom in
America.” Does the United States
Senate and Chairman Dodd
(whose 73 per cent ADA rating,
sadly for Walter Lippmann and
Scotty Reston, precludes the
bandying around of the tried and
true "right wing lunatic fringe
extremist” epitaph) (sic) not
have this fundamental freedom?
One would think Mr. Rosencranz
would embrace this investigation
in the name of academic freedom,
lather than condemn it. Appar
ently the Senate, with its vastly
greater facilities for information
gathering, is not to be allowed to
make a decision Mr. Rosencranz

It is indeed represensible that

(whose 73 per cent ADA rating,
sadly for Walter Lippmann and

bandying around of the tried and

have this fundamental freedom?
One would think Mr. Rosencranz
would embrace this investigation

greater facilities for information

has.
It is indeed represensible that
power hungry demagogues seek

apparently forgets that he was

Congratulations to the Legisla
ture which I hope is truly repre
sentative of tile student body,
for its resolution re the Senate
Committee “investigating” KPFA
and the Pacifica Foundation.

To my way of thinking. Legis
lature’s resolution is an emphatic
re-assertion of Stanford’s motto.
I believe Dr. David Starr Jordan
would be proud to know that
Stanford’s undergraduates do not
merely look at the legend on the
Stanford seal. Surely, if the
“winds of freedom” are to con
tinue to blow, it is university stu
dents, administrators, and facul
ty who must continually be on
the alert to see that they do.
Stanford should be proud that its
students are not apathetic, smug
members of an insular campus,
but are deeply concerned with
the issues of the day and anxious
to have a part in determining
them.

The recent action of the admin
istration in the KPFA controver
sy was typical. That of the ASSU
was not. We can be thankful for
the increasing intellectual integ
rity and maturity of the ASSU.
We can hope for the same from
the administration. Lest it be fear
ed that there is no precedent up
on which to base such hope, let
me quote from a letter which I
received recently from the chair
man of the Department of Philos
ophy at Antioch College in Ohio.
“Antioch zealously sustains the
right of the citizen-student or fac
ulty to engage responsibly in po
litical and social discussion and
action. . ; . Education is not seen
as something created exclusively
in the classroom, nor as a matter
of bits and pieces, but as some
thing emerging from the diverse
ecology of life experience; a sus
tained effort by individuals over
a period of time in an environ
ment in which everyone and
everything may boar on the edu
cational process.”

While wo share little concern
about the ominous “improper in
volvement (s) of the University’s
name” foreseen by the adminis
tration, we question the propriety
of the recent actions of Mr. Ro
sencranz and his legislature pur
porting to represent the student
body on political issues.
Stanford students certainly
have the right and Iho obligation
to “speak out, individually and
collectively” on matters of pub
lic concern, and, wo might add, to
participate in partisan efforts to
realize their views here on cam
pus. But the issue which concerns
us is not only the infringement
on the rights of the students, but
also the presumption of our
ASSU officials to take non-repre
sentative political stands in our
name.

In none of last year’s cam
paigns for student office do we
recall any candidate who at
tempted to outline his views on
political issues. Yet these same
representatives seem to consider
their election a mandate to com
mit the student body to specific
policies. Although we happen to
agree with the policies presented
recently by LASSU, we disagree
with their unwarranted enact
ment.
If LASSU's constituents want

to turn the legislature into a for
um for political debate, so be it.
But they must be prepared for
the entry of all the political ac
tion groups in the area into the
selections of representatives and
officials.

Stanford University appears to
be facd with a true dilemma: to
raise the funds wdth which to at
tract great professors and build
on outstanding physical plant, it
must censor the expression of
views by its academic community
so as not to offend the contribu
tors of those funds.
The greatness of a university
is inherent in the greatness of
its faculty and student body. For,
lake away a university’s great
professors and carefully selected
student body, take away the free
dom of communication among its
students, their teachers, and the
outside world, and the remaining
physical plant, no matter how
costly, is nothing but an empty
shell. If this university is truly
great, its teachers and students
will reserve the right to speak in
dividually, in groups, and as a
body, and they will reserve the
right to use the name of the uni
versity which they constitute. It
is nothing less than the responsi
bility of every member of Stan
ford’s academic community to
back the right of LASSU to pass
such a resolution as the one pass
ed Thursday expressing Legisla
ture’s concern over the possible
consequences of the Senate in
vestigation of KPFA.
If we do not, if we sacrifice our
right to the hope of raising more
money to attract more great pro
fessors, then our image will suf
fer. And it will very likely follow
that the truly great professors
will refuse to teach here after
all. Stanford is presenting an im
age to the nation’s academic com
munity as well as to the nation’s
wealthy. Let us not sacrifice one
to the other.

The recent investigation of
KPFA radio and the subsequent
delay in the renewal of the sta
tion's broadcasting license has
once again focused attention on
the question of whether or not in
a free, open, and democratic soci
ety there can ever be a limitation
on the expression of the whole
range of political viewpoints and
opinions. The subversive appeals
of leftists and rightists have
caused consternation for many a
liberal and the reflective conserv
ative as well, for a person of
either political orientation is
equally as concerned with the
preservation of the liberties
which we can enjoy in our demo
cratic society and that disappear
in the more absolutist or modern
totalitarian stales.
One of the foundation stones
of a democracy, however, is the
maintenance of a means whereby
a minority opinion can become a
majority. It is on this point that
the dichotomy between the con
servative and the liberal position
arises. Whereas conservatives
have generally been more con
cerned with protecting the preva
lent majority opinion, liberals
have placed greater empsasis on
the unrestricted expression of mi
nority views as well, based on a
more absolute interpretation of
the first amendment.

If a truly democratic and open
society is to survive, we must

place faith in the desire of all
American citizens to maintain
the freedoms we possess, even if
they advocate the promulgation
of all political opinions. We must
be devoted to the principle that
the people, once informed of all
points of view, are capable of de
termining their sovereign respon
sibilities.

Pacifica Radio has been dedi
cated to serving the function of
providing its audience the fullest
and broadest coverage of thought
and has trusted to the sophistica
tion of its listeners to determine
those views that truly support
our democratic traditions. The un
derlying philosophy of investiga
tions by such committees as the
Senate Internal Security Sub
committee and HU AC is basically
anti-democratic for it removes
from the people the sovereign
right to determine what is truth.
In such a case it becomes govern
ment’s responsibility to decide
what is true and to impose upon
us such an official truth. It seems
to me that the desire to reserve
this responsibility for our citi
zens, rather than our govern
ment, should find undivided sup
port among both liberals and
conservatives.
Martin Lebowitz
Editor, The Daily:
The action of Armin Rosen
cranz and LASSU in recent days
has been a couse of consternation
and dismay for a large propor
tion of the student community.
Mr. Rosencranz seemingly has
forgotten the limit to our free
doms that we voluntarily impose
upon entrance to the university
to enjoy the privilege of attend
ance. He lias forgotten his con
j sent, and therefore obligation, as
a member of the student body, to
I act within the given framework,
I defined for him beyond question
of misinterpretation by Dean
Winbigler, or act in clear viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Yet even if we assume for the
sake of argument that the obli
gation accrued toward the univer
sity on entrance did not hold in
this case, Mr. Rosencranz’s argu
ments are still unsound.
In “The Associated Student's
Position on Social Action and Its
Role in the Educational Process”
which he drafted, he fails to In
dicate how the individual’s re
sponsibility to be informed and
to act on the vital questions of
the day (with which I heartily
concur) can in any way be con
strued as an obligation of the As
sociated Students or, more par
ticularly, as an obligation of their
legislature. How he can argue
that an assemblage elected to act
on a narrow range of local issues
is competent to make pronounce
ments on “the greater problems
and issues of national and inter
national life” is beyond logical
comprehension.
His thesis that action in itself,
whether ' based on rational
thought or not, is of value typi
fies the fundamental fallacies on
which present day liberals build
their ideological castles. His mis
conception of existentialist doc
trine, which sees virtue in action
only when it is based on an un
derstanding of the meaning of
existence (its absurdity), does lit
tle to help his case. One does not
know whther he is merely mis
informed or intellectually dis
honest.

His letter to Senator Dodd and
Mr. Mintow (sic) is one vast con
tradiction. He seems to limit the
very “right to search and ques
tion freely” which he calls “fun
damental to academic freedom in
America.” Does the United States
Senate and Chairman Dodd
(whose 73 per cent ADA rating,
sadly for Walter Lippmann and

His letter to Senator Dodd and
Mr. Mintow (sic) is one vast con

Senate and Chairman Dodd

true "right wing lunatic fringe

has.
It is indeed represensible that
power hungry demagogues seek
to overstep their bounds, pro

polled by their delusions. It is in
deed reprehensible that 20 indi

apparently forgets that he was

Congratulations to the Legisla
ture which I hope is truly repre
sentative of tile student body,
for its resolution re the Senate
Committee “investigating” KPFA
and the Pacifica Foundation.

To my way of thinking. Legis
lature’s resolution is an emphatic
re-assertion of Stanford’s motto.
I believe Dr. David Starr Jordan
would be proud to know that
Stanford’s undergraduates do not
merely look at the legend on the
Stanford seal. Surely, if the
“winds of freedom” are to con
tinue to blow, it is university stu
dents, administrators, and facul
ty who must continually be on
the alert to see that they do.
Stanford should be proud that its
students are not apathetic, smug
members of an insular campus,
but are deeply concerned with
the issues of the day and anxious
to have a part in determining
them.

The recent action of the admin
istration in the KPFA controver
sy was typical. That of the ASSU
was not. We can be thankful for
the increasing intellectual integ
rity and maturity of the ASSU.
We can hope for the same from
the administration. Lest it be fear
ed that there is no precedent up
on which to base such hope, let
me quote from a letter which I
received recently from the chair
man of the Department of Philos
ophy at Antioch College in Ohio.
“Antioch zealously sustains the
right of the citizen-student or fac
ulty to engage responsibly in po
litical and social discussion and
action. . ; . Education is not seen
as something created exclusively
in the classroom, nor as a matter
of bits and pieces, but as some
thing emerging from the diverse
ecology of life experience; a sus
tained effort by individuals over
a period of time in an environ
ment in which everyone and
everything may boar on the edu
cational process.”

While wo share little concern
about the ominous “improper in
volvement (s) of the University’s
name” foreseen by the adminis
tration, we question the propriety
of the recent actions of Mr. Ro
sencranz and his legislature pur
porting to represent the student
body on political issues.
Stanford students certainly
have the right and Iho obligation
to “speak out, individually and
collectively” on matters of pub
lic concern, and, wo might add, to
participate in partisan efforts to
realize their views here on cam
pus. But the issue which concerns
us is not only the infringement
on the rights of the students, but
also the presumption of our
ASSU officials to take non-repre
sentative political stands in our
name.

In none of last year’s cam
paigns for student office do we
recall any candidate who at
tempted to outline his views on
political issues. Yet these same
representatives seem to consider
their election a mandate to com
mit the student body to specific
policies. Although we happen to
agree with the policies presented
recently by LASSU, we disagree
with their unwarranted enact
ment.
If LASSU's constituents want

to turn the legislature into a for
um for political debate, so be it.
But they must be prepared for
the entry of all the political ac
tion groups in the area into the
selections of representatives and
officials.

Stanford University appears to
be facd with a true dilemma: to
raise the funds wdth which to at
tract great professors and build
on outstanding physical plant, it
must censor the expression of
views by its academic community
so as not to offend the contribu
tors of those funds.
The greatness of a university
is inherent in the greatness of
its faculty and student body. For,
lake away a university’s great
professors and carefully selected
student body, take away the free
dom of communication among its
students, their teachers, and the
outside world, and the remaining
physical plant, no matter how
costly, is nothing but an empty
shell. If this university is truly
great, its teachers and students
will reserve the right to speak in
dividually, in groups, and as a
body, and they will reserve the
right to use the name of the uni
versity which they constitute. It
is nothing less than the responsi
bility of every member of Stan
ford’s academic community to
back the right of LASSU to pass
such a resolution as the one pass
ed Thursday expressing Legisla
ture’s concern over the possible
consequences of the Senate in
vestigation of KPFA.
If we do not, if we sacrifice our
right to the hope of raising more
money to attract more great pro
fessors, then our image will suf
fer. And it will very likely follow
that the truly great professors
will refuse to teach here after
all. Stanford is presenting an im
age to the nation’s academic com
munity as well as to the nation’s
wealthy. Let us not sacrifice one
to the other.

The recent investigation of
KPFA radio and the subsequent
delay in the renewal of the sta
tion's broadcasting license has
once again focused attention on
the question of whether or not in
a free, open, and democratic soci
ety there can ever be a limitation
on the expression of the whole
range of political viewpoints and
opinions. The subversive appeals
of leftists and rightists have
caused consternation for many a
liberal and the reflective conserv
ative as well, for a person of
either political orientation is
equally as concerned with the
preservation of the liberties
which we can enjoy in our demo
cratic society and that disappear
in the more absolutist or modern
totalitarian stales.
One of the foundation stones
of a democracy, however, is the
maintenance of a means whereby
a minority opinion can become a
majority. It is on this point that
the dichotomy between the con
servative and the liberal position
arises. Whereas conservatives
have generally been more con
cerned with protecting the preva
lent majority opinion, liberals
have placed greater empsasis on
the unrestricted expression of mi
nority views as well, based on a
more absolute interpretation of
the first amendment.

If a truly democratic and open
society is to survive, we must

place faith in the desire of all
American citizens to maintain
the freedoms we possess, even if
they advocate the promulgation
of all political opinions. We must
be devoted to the principle that
the people, once informed of all
points of view, are capable of de
termining their sovereign respon
sibilities.

Pacifica Radio has been dedi
cated to serving the function of
providing its audience the fullest
and broadest coverage of thought
and has trusted to the sophistica
tion of its listeners to determine
those views that truly support
our democratic traditions. The un
derlying philosophy of investiga
tions by such committees as the
Senate Internal Security Sub
committee and HU AC is basically
anti-democratic for it removes
from the people the sovereign
right to determine what is truth.
In such a case it becomes govern
ment’s responsibility to decide
what is true and to impose upon
us such an official truth. It seems
to me that the desire to reserve
this responsibility for our citi
zens, rather than our govern
ment, should find undivided sup
port among both liberals and
conservatives.
Martin Lebowitz
Editor, The Daily:
The action of Armin Rosen
cranz and LASSU in recent days
has been a couse of consternation
and dismay for a large propor
tion of the student community.
Mr. Rosencranz seemingly has
forgotten the limit to our free
doms that we voluntarily impose
upon entrance to the university
to enjoy the privilege of attend
ance. He lias forgotten his con
j sent, and therefore obligation, as
a member of the student body, to
I act within the given framework,
I defined for him beyond question
of misinterpretation by Dean
Winbigler, or act in clear viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Yet even if we assume for the
sake of argument that the obli
gation accrued toward the univer
sity on entrance did not hold in
this case, Mr. Rosencranz’s argu
ments are still unsound.
In “The Associated Student's
Position on Social Action and Its
Role in the Educational Process”
which he drafted, he fails to In
dicate how the individual’s re
sponsibility to be informed and
to act on the vital questions of
the day (with which I heartily
concur) can in any way be con
strued as an obligation of the As
sociated Students or, more par
ticularly, as an obligation of their
legislature. How he can argue
that an assemblage elected to act
on a narrow range of local issues
is competent to make pronounce
ments on “the greater problems
and issues of national and inter
national life” is beyond logical
comprehension.
His thesis that action in itself,
whether ' based on rational
thought or not, is of value typi
fies the fundamental fallacies on
which present day liberals build
their ideological castles. His mis
conception of existentialist doc
trine, which sees virtue in action
only when it is based on an un

the day (with which I heartily
concur) can in any way be con
strued as an obligation of the As
sociated Students or, more par
ticularly, as an obligation of their
legislature. How he can argue
that an assemblage elected to act
on a narrow range of local issues
is competent to make pronounce
ments on “the greater problems
and issues of national and inter
national life” is beyond logical
comprehension.
His thesis that action in itself,
whether ' based on rational
thought or not, is of value typi
fies the fundamental fallacies on
which present day liberals build
their ideological castles. His mis
conception of existentialist doc

only when it is based on an un
derstanding of the meaning of
existence (its absurdity), does lit
tle to help his case. One does not
know whther he is merely mis
informed or intellectually dis
honest.

His letter to Senator Dodd and
Mr. Mintow (sic) is one vast con
tradiction. He seems to limit the
very “right to search and ques

damental to academic freedom in
America.” Does the United States
Senate and Chairman Dodd
(whose 73 per cent ADA rating,
sadly for Walter Lippmann and
Scotty Reston, precludes the
bandying around of the tried and
true "right wing lunatic fringe
extremist” epitaph) (sic) not
have this fundamental freedom?
One would think Mr. Rosencranz
would embrace this investigation

greater facilities for information

has.
It is indeed represensible that
power hungry demagogues seek
to overstep their bounds, pro

polled by their delusions. It is in
deed reprehensible that 20 indi

late on what essentially is a mor
al question to be decided by each
of us separately. It is indeed rep
rehensible that Mr. Rosencranz
apparently forgets that he was
elected, not deified, last spring.

Congratulations to the Legisla
ture which I hope is truly repre
sentative of tile student body,
for its resolution re the Senate
Committee “investigating” KPFA
and the Pacifica Foundation.

To my way of thinking. Legis
lature’s resolution is an emphatic
re-assertion of Stanford’s motto.
I believe Dr. David Starr Jordan
would be proud to know that
Stanford’s undergraduates do not
merely look at the legend on the
Stanford seal. Surely, if the
“winds of freedom” are to con
tinue to blow, it is university stu
dents, administrators, and facul
ty who must continually be on
the alert to see that they do.
Stanford should be proud that its
students are not apathetic, smug
members of an insular campus,
but are deeply concerned with
the issues of the day and anxious
to have a part in determining
them.

The recent action of the admin
istration in the KPFA controver
sy was typical. That of the ASSU
was not. We can be thankful for
the increasing intellectual integ
rity and maturity of the ASSU.
We can hope for the same from
the administration. Lest it be fear
ed that there is no precedent up
on which to base such hope, let
me quote from a letter which I
received recently from the chair
man of the Department of Philos
ophy at Antioch College in Ohio.
“Antioch zealously sustains the
right of the citizen-student or fac
ulty to engage responsibly in po
litical and social discussion and
action. . ; . Education is not seen
as something created exclusively
in the classroom, nor as a matter
of bits and pieces, but as some
thing emerging from the diverse
ecology of life experience; a sus
tained effort by individuals over
a period of time in an environ
ment in which everyone and
everything may boar on the edu
cational process.”

While wo share little concern
about the ominous “improper in
volvement (s) of the University’s
name” foreseen by the adminis
tration, we question the propriety
of the recent actions of Mr. Ro
sencranz and his legislature pur
porting to represent the student
body on political issues.
Stanford students certainly
have the right and Iho obligation
to “speak out, individually and
collectively” on matters of pub
lic concern, and, wo might add, to
participate in partisan efforts to
realize their views here on cam
pus. But the issue which concerns
us is not only the infringement
on the rights of the students, but
also the presumption of our
ASSU officials to take non-repre
sentative political stands in our
name.

In none of last year’s cam
paigns for student office do we
recall any candidate who at
tempted to outline his views on
political issues. Yet these same
representatives seem to consider
their election a mandate to com
mit the student body to specific
policies. Although we happen to
agree with the policies presented
recently by LASSU, we disagree
with their unwarranted enact
ment.
If LASSU's constituents want

to turn the legislature into a for
um for political debate, so be it.
But they must be prepared for
the entry of all the political ac
tion groups in the area into the
selections of representatives and
officials.

Stanford University appears to
be facd with a true dilemma: to
raise the funds wdth which to at
tract great professors and build
on outstanding physical plant, it
must censor the expression of
views by its academic community
so as not to offend the contribu
tors of those funds.
The greatness of a university
is inherent in the greatness of
its faculty and student body. For,
lake away a university’s great
professors and carefully selected
student body, take away the free
dom of communication among its
students, their teachers, and the
outside world, and the remaining
physical plant, no matter how
costly, is nothing but an empty
shell. If this university is truly
great, its teachers and students
will reserve the right to speak in
dividually, in groups, and as a
body, and they will reserve the
right to use the name of the uni
versity which they constitute. It
is nothing less than the responsi
bility of every member of Stan
ford’s academic community to
back the right of LASSU to pass
such a resolution as the one pass
ed Thursday expressing Legisla
ture’s concern over the possible
consequences of the Senate in
vestigation of KPFA.
If we do not, if we sacrifice our
right to the hope of raising more
money to attract more great pro
fessors, then our image will suf
fer. And it will very likely follow
that the truly great professors
will refuse to teach here after
all. Stanford is presenting an im
age to the nation’s academic com
munity as well as to the nation’s
wealthy. Let us not sacrifice one
to the other.

The recent investigation of
KPFA radio and the subsequent
delay in the renewal of the sta
tion's broadcasting license has
once again focused attention on
the question of whether or not in
a free, open, and democratic soci
ety there can ever be a limitation
on the expression of the whole
range of political viewpoints and
opinions. The subversive appeals
of leftists and rightists have
caused consternation for many a
liberal and the reflective conserv
ative as well, for a person of
either political orientation is
equally as concerned with the
preservation of the liberties
which we can enjoy in our demo
cratic society and that disappear
in the more absolutist or modern
totalitarian stales.
One of the foundation stones
of a democracy, however, is the
maintenance of a means whereby
a minority opinion can become a
majority. It is on this point that
the dichotomy between the con
servative and the liberal position
arises. Whereas conservatives
have generally been more con
cerned with protecting the preva
lent majority opinion, liberals
have placed greater empsasis on
the unrestricted expression of mi
nority views as well, based on a
more absolute interpretation of
the first amendment.

If a truly democratic and open
society is to survive, we must

place faith in the desire of all
American citizens to maintain
the freedoms we possess, even if
they advocate the promulgation
of all political opinions. We must
be devoted to the principle that
the people, once informed of all
points of view, are capable of de
termining their sovereign respon
sibilities.

Pacifica Radio has been dedi
cated to serving the function of
providing its audience the fullest
and broadest coverage of thought
and has trusted to the sophistica
tion of its listeners to determine
those views that truly support
our democratic traditions. The un
derlying philosophy of investiga
tions by such committees as the
Senate Internal Security Sub
committee and HU AC is basically
anti-democratic for it removes
from the people the sovereign
right to determine what is truth.
In such a case it becomes govern
ment’s responsibility to decide
what is true and to impose upon
us such an official truth. It seems
to me that the desire to reserve
this responsibility for our citi
zens, rather than our govern
ment, should find undivided sup
port among both liberals and
conservatives.

The action of Armin Rosen
cranz and LASSU in recent days
has been a couse of consternation
and dismay for a large propor
tion of the student community.
Mr. Rosencranz seemingly has
forgotten the limit to our free
doms that we voluntarily impose
upon entrance to the university
to enjoy the privilege of attend
ance. He lias forgotten his con
j sent, and therefore obligation, as
a member of the student body, to
I act within the given framework,
I defined for him beyond question
of misinterpretation by Dean
Winbigler, or act in clear viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Yet even if we assume for the
sake of argument that the obli
gation accrued toward the univer
sity on entrance did not hold in
this case, Mr. Rosencranz’s argu
ments are still unsound.
In “The Associated Student's
Position on Social Action and Its
Role in the Educational Process”
which he drafted, he fails to In
dicate how the individual’s re
sponsibility to be informed and
to act on the vital questions of
the day (with which I heartily
concur) can in any way be con
strued as an obligation of the As
sociated Students or, more par
ticularly, as an obligation of their
legislature. How he can argue

Winbigler, or act in clear viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Yet even if we assume for the
sake of argument that the obli
gation accrued toward the univer
sity on entrance did not hold in
this case, Mr. Rosencranz’s argu
ments are still unsound.
In “The Associated Student's
Position on Social Action and Its
Role in the Educational Process”
which he drafted, he fails to In
dicate how the individual’s re
sponsibility to be informed and
to act on the vital questions of
the day (with which I heartily
concur) can in any way be con
strued as an obligation of the As
sociated Students or, more par
ticularly, as an obligation of their
legislature. How he can argue
that an assemblage elected to act
on a narrow range of local issues
is competent to make pronounce
ments on “the greater problems
and issues of national and inter
national life” is beyond logical
comprehension.
His thesis that action in itself,
whether ' based on rational
thought or not, is of value typi
fies the fundamental fallacies on
which present day liberals build
their ideological castles. His mis
conception of existentialist doc
trine, which sees virtue in action
only when it is based on an un
derstanding of the meaning of
existence (its absurdity), does lit
tle to help his case. One does not
know whther he is merely mis
informed or intellectually dis
honest.

His letter to Senator Dodd and
Mr. Mintow (sic) is one vast con
tradiction. He seems to limit the
very “right to search and ques
tion freely” which he calls “fun
damental to academic freedom in
America.” Does the United States
Senate and Chairman Dodd
(whose 73 per cent ADA rating,
sadly for Walter Lippmann and
Scotty Reston, precludes the
bandying around of the tried and
true "right wing lunatic fringe
extremist” epitaph) (sic) not
have this fundamental freedom?
One would think Mr. Rosencranz
would embrace this investigation
in the name of academic freedom,
lather than condemn it. Appar
ently the Senate, with its vastly
greater facilities for information
gathering, is not to be allowed to
make a decision Mr. Rosencranz
has.
It is indeed represensible that
power hungry demagogues seek
to overstep their bounds, pro

polled by their delusions. It is in
deed reprehensible that 20 indi
viduals should attempt to legis
late on what essentially is a mor
al question to be decided by each
of us separately. It is indeed rep
rehensible that Mr. Rosencranz
apparently forgets that he was
elected, not deified, last spring.

Congratulations to the Legisla
ture which I hope is truly repre
sentative of tile student body,
for its resolution re the Senate
Committee “investigating” KPFA
and the Pacifica Foundation.

To my way of thinking. Legis
lature’s resolution is an emphatic
re-assertion of Stanford’s motto.
I believe Dr. David Starr Jordan
would be proud to know that
Stanford’s undergraduates do not
merely look at the legend on the
Stanford seal. Surely, if the
“winds of freedom” are to con
tinue to blow, it is university stu
dents, administrators, and facul
ty who must continually be on
the alert to see that they do.
Stanford should be proud that its
students are not apathetic, smug
members of an insular campus,
but are deeply concerned with
the issues of the day and anxious
to have a part in determining
them.

The recent action of the admin
istration in the KPFA controver
sy was typical. That of the ASSU
was not. We can be thankful for
the increasing intellectual integ
rity and maturity of the ASSU.
We can hope for the same from
the administration. Lest it be fear
ed that there is no precedent up
on which to base such hope, let
me quote from a letter which I
received recently from the chair
man of the Department of Philos
ophy at Antioch College in Ohio.
“Antioch zealously sustains the
right of the citizen-student or fac
ulty to engage responsibly in po
litical and social discussion and
action. . ; . Education is not seen
as something created exclusively
in the classroom, nor as a matter
of bits and pieces, but as some
thing emerging from the diverse
ecology of life experience; a sus
tained effort by individuals over
a period of time in an environ
ment in which everyone and
everything may boar on the edu
cational process.”

While wo share little concern
about the ominous “improper in
volvement (s) of the University’s
name” foreseen by the adminis
tration, we question the propriety
of the recent actions of Mr. Ro
sencranz and his legislature pur
porting to represent the student
body on political issues.
Stanford students certainly
have the right and Iho obligation
to “speak out, individually and
collectively” on matters of pub
lic concern, and, wo might add, to
participate in partisan efforts to
realize their views here on cam
pus. But the issue which concerns
us is not only the infringement
on the rights of the students, but
also the presumption of our
ASSU officials to take non-repre
sentative political stands in our
name.

In none of last year’s cam
paigns for student office do we
recall any candidate who at
tempted to outline his views on
political issues. Yet these same
representatives seem to consider
their election a mandate to com
mit the student body to specific
policies. Although we happen to
agree with the policies presented
recently by LASSU, we disagree
with their unwarranted enact
ment.
If LASSU's constituents want

to turn the legislature into a for
um for political debate, so be it.
But they must be prepared for
the entry of all the political ac
tion groups in the area into the
selections of representatives and
officials.

Stanford University appears to
be facd with a true dilemma: to
raise the funds wdth which to at
tract great professors and build
on outstanding physical plant, it
must censor the expression of
views by its academic community
so as not to offend the contribu
tors of those funds.
The greatness of a university
is inherent in the greatness of
its faculty and student body. For,
lake away a university’s great
professors and carefully selected
student body, take away the free
dom of communication among its
students, their teachers, and the
outside world, and the remaining
physical plant, no matter how
costly, is nothing but an empty
shell. If this university is truly
great, its teachers and students
will reserve the right to speak in
dividually, in groups, and as a
body, and they will reserve the
right to use the name of the uni
versity which they constitute. It
is nothing less than the responsi
bility of every member of Stan
ford’s academic community to
back the right of LASSU to pass
such a resolution as the one pass
ed Thursday expressing Legisla
ture’s concern over the possible
consequences of the Senate in
vestigation of KPFA.
If we do not, if we sacrifice our
right to the hope of raising more
money to attract more great pro
fessors, then our image will suf
fer. And it will very likely follow
that the truly great professors
will refuse to teach here after
all. Stanford is presenting an im
age to the nation’s academic com
munity as well as to the nation’s
wealthy. Let us not sacrifice one
to the other.

The recent investigation of
KPFA radio and the subsequent
delay in the renewal of the sta
tion's broadcasting license has
once again focused attention on
the question of whether or not in
a free, open, and democratic soci
ety there can ever be a limitation
on the expression of the whole
range of political viewpoints and
opinions. The subversive appeals
of leftists and rightists have
caused consternation for many a
liberal and the reflective conserv
ative as well, for a person of
either political orientation is
equally as concerned with the
preservation of the liberties
which we can enjoy in our demo
cratic society and that disappear
in the more absolutist or modern
totalitarian stales.
One of the foundation stones
of a democracy, however, is the
maintenance of a means whereby
a minority opinion can become a
majority. It is on this point that
the dichotomy between the con
servative and the liberal position
arises. Whereas conservatives
have generally been more con
cerned with protecting the preva
lent majority opinion, liberals
have placed greater empsasis on
the unrestricted expression of mi
nority views as well, based on a
more absolute interpretation of
the first amendment.

If a truly democratic and open
society is to survive, we must

place faith in the desire of all
American citizens to maintain
the freedoms we possess, even if
they advocate the promulgation
of all political opinions. We must
be devoted to the principle that
the people, once informed of all
points of view, are capable of de
termining their sovereign respon
sibilities.

Pacifica Radio has been dedi
cated to serving the function of
providing its audience the fullest
and broadest coverage of thought
and has trusted to the sophistica
tion of its listeners to determine
those views that truly support
our democratic traditions. The un
derlying philosophy of investiga
tions by such committees as the
Senate Internal Security Sub
committee and HU AC is basically
anti-democratic for it removes
from the people the sovereign
right to determine what is truth.
In such a case it becomes govern
ment’s responsibility to decide
what is true and to impose upon
us such an official truth. It seems
to me that the desire to reserve
this responsibility for our citi
zens, rather than our govern
ment, should find undivided sup
port among both liberals and
conservatives.

The action of Armin Rosen
cranz and LASSU in recent days
has been a couse of consternation
and dismay for a large propor
tion of the student community.
Mr. Rosencranz seemingly has
forgotten the limit to our free
doms that we voluntarily impose
upon entrance to the university
to enjoy the privilege of attend
ance. He lias forgotten his con
j sent, and therefore obligation, as
a member of the student body, to
