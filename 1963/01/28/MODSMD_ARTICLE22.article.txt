# PROF. JAN TRISKA:
## 'Red Congress in E. Germany Showed Sino-Soviet Strains' 
### MICHAEL SAKS 
“The recent Communist congress in East Germany lias not
brought any substantive changes in East Berlin or in Soviet for
eign policy,” believes Professor Jan F. Triska of the Stanford Po
litical Science Department. But the meeting did illustrate the
strained relations between the Soviet and Chinese Communists.

Professor Triska pointed out-"
that there have been four recent
congresses in the Eastern satel
lite states (Bulgaria, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, and East Ger
many), but that Khrushchev at
tended only the East German one.
The Chinese sent the same dele
gation, headed by Wu Hsiu-
Chuan, to all four.
“WHY 1)11) Khrushchev attend
the East German conference?”
asked Triska. “He went there es
sentially to express for all to see
the Soviet support of the East
German regime,” but at the same
time he was not supporting Wal
ter Ulbricht’s demands for a
peace treaty. "He went, he em
braced and kissed Ulbricht, but
he didn’t say Ulbricht was right.”
Khrushchev substituted himself
for a peace theaty.
Neither the East German nor
the Chinese problem advanced as
a result of the Communist con
gress, Triska noted. “I still think
the quarrel is going to come to a
head at a congress of all the
Communist parties. This is the
type of congress that China
wants,” Triska said. The last such
congress was in 1960. Soviet spon
sorship spoiled the other con
gresses for China.
“China is playing for support
of the other Communist parties
for her particular points of view
on such questions as Cuba, India,
and nuclear war,” Triska stated.
"Both Khrushchev and Commu
nist China are fishing in muddy
waters for support.”
AT PRESENT, the Sino-Soviet
split of world Communist sup
port is approximately two to
eight, he estimated. But the Chi-
I nese are gaining support in the
important underdeveloped areas
of South East Asia which look to
China for advice. Triska stated
that the Chinese need more Com
munist party support, especially
a foothold in the West. So far,
their only supporters are North
Korea and Albania. The Chinese
Communists lost some influence
in an Italian Communist confer
ence last year.

Triska noted the fact that since
last fall’s Cuban crisis, the So
viet Union has been on the de
fensive, putting the U.S. and the
West in an offensive position.
This situation is an attempt by
the Soviets to get Increased back
ing from the other Communist
countries.
THE SOVIETS are more cau
tious in their foreign policy than
are the Chinese, Triska stated. As
far back as 1946, Khrushchev
said that war is not fatalistically
inevitable. The threat of nuclear
war is acting as a deterent.
Triska believes that our warn
ings to the Soviets have finally
been understood for what they
are. The western powers are de
termined not to be pushed out of
Berlin.
Dr, Robert North of the Stan
ford Political Science Depart
ment is largely in agreement
with Professor Triska about the
implications for the Western
world of the Communist confer
ence. He sees a basic, peculiar
kind of struggle among the Com
munist forces that binds them to
gether and pushes them apart si
multaneously. This Sino-Soviet
conflict preceded World War II
and was latent during the days of
Stalin.
KHRUSHCHEV does not mer it
the same respect in Mao Tse-
Tung’s eyes that Stalin did, ac
cording to North. “In Asian eyes,
Mao is tlie Lenin of China. Why
should he have respect for a man
(Khrushchev) who danced on his
heels at Stalin’s command?”
North believes that Khru
shchev weighs more heavily the
destructive result of war than
does China. “Khrushchev has a
clear perception of the destruc
tive potential of nuclear war
ware. It would cost too high a
price. It would abolish what he
has been working for.”
Increasingly difficult decisions
are arising within Communist
ranks, according to North, over
specific programs such as under
developed countries, defense, and
the role of nuclear war. “Commu
nism, in the long run, is likely to
suffer from those differences,”
j said North. “The future is on our
side.”

gresses for China.
“China is playing for support
of the other Communist parties
for her particular points of view
on such questions as Cuba, India,
and nuclear war,” Triska stated.
"Both Khrushchev and Commu
nist China are fishing in muddy
waters for support.”
AT PRESENT, the Sino-Soviet
split of world Communist sup
port is approximately two to
eight, he estimated. But the Chi-
I nese are gaining support in the
important underdeveloped areas
of South East Asia which look to
China for advice. Triska stated
that the Chinese need more Com
munist party support, especially
a foothold in the West. So far,
their only supporters are North
Korea and Albania. The Chinese
Communists lost some influence
in an Italian Communist confer
ence last year.

Triska noted the fact that since
last fall’s Cuban crisis, the So
viet Union has been on the de
fensive, putting the U.S. and the
West in an offensive position.
This situation is an attempt by
the Soviets to get Increased back
ing from the other Communist
countries.
THE SOVIETS are more cau
tious in their foreign policy than
are the Chinese, Triska stated. As
far back as 1946, Khrushchev
said that war is not fatalistically
inevitable. The threat of nuclear
war is acting as a deterent.
Triska believes that our warn
ings to the Soviets have finally
been understood for what they
are. The western powers are de
termined not to be pushed out of
Berlin.
Dr, Robert North of the Stan
ford Political Science Depart
ment is largely in agreement
with Professor Triska about the
implications for the Western
world of the Communist confer
ence. He sees a basic, peculiar
kind of struggle among the Com
munist forces that binds them to
gether and pushes them apart si
multaneously. This Sino-Soviet
conflict preceded World War II
and was latent during the days of
Stalin.
KHRUSHCHEV does not mer it
the same respect in Mao Tse-
Tung’s eyes that Stalin did, ac
cording to North. “In Asian eyes,
Mao is tlie Lenin of China. Why
should he have respect for a man
(Khrushchev) who danced on his
heels at Stalin’s command?”
North believes that Khru
shchev weighs more heavily the
destructive result of war than
does China. “Khrushchev has a
clear perception of the destruc
tive potential of nuclear war
ware. It would cost too high a
price. It would abolish what he
has been working for.”
Increasingly difficult decisions
are arising within Communist
ranks, according to North, over
specific programs such as under
developed countries, defense, and
the role of nuclear war. “Commu
nism, in the long run, is likely to
suffer from those differences,”
j said North. “The future is on our
side.”
“The recent Communist congress in East Germany lias not
brought any substantive changes in East Berlin or in Soviet for
eign policy,” believes Professor Jan F. Triska of the Stanford Po
litical Science Department. But the meeting did illustrate the
strained relations between the Soviet and Chinese Communists.

Professor Triska pointed out-"
that there have been four recent
congresses in the Eastern satel
lite states (Bulgaria, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, and East Ger
many), but that Khrushchev at
tended only the East German one.
The Chinese sent the same dele
gation, headed by Wu Hsiu-
Chuan, to all four.
“WHY 1)11) Khrushchev attend
the East German conference?”
asked Triska. “He went there es
sentially to express for all to see
the Soviet support of the East
German regime,” but at the same
time he was not supporting Wal
ter Ulbricht’s demands for a
peace treaty. "He went, he em
braced and kissed Ulbricht, but
he didn’t say Ulbricht was right.”
Khrushchev substituted himself
for a peace theaty.
Neither the East German nor
the Chinese problem advanced as
a result of the Communist con
gress, Triska noted. “I still think
the quarrel is going to come to a
head at a congress of all the
Communist parties. This is the
type of congress that China
wants,” Triska said. The last such
congress was in 1960. Soviet spon

Dr, Robert North of the Stan
ford Political Science Depart
ment is largely in agreement
with Professor Triska about the
implications for the Western
world of the Communist confer
ence. He sees a basic, peculiar
kind of struggle among the Com
munist forces that binds them to
gether and pushes them apart si
multaneously. This Sino-Soviet
conflict preceded World War II
and was latent during the days of
Stalin.
KHRUSHCHEV does not mer it
the same respect in Mao Tse-
Tung’s eyes that Stalin did, ac
cording to North. “In Asian eyes,
Mao is tlie Lenin of China. Why
should he have respect for a man
(Khrushchev) who danced on his
heels at Stalin’s command?”
North believes that Khru
shchev weighs more heavily the
destructive result of war than
does China. “Khrushchev has a
clear perception of the destruc
tive potential of nuclear war
ware. It would cost too high a
price. It would abolish what he
has been working for.”
Increasingly difficult decisions
are arising within Communist
ranks, according to North, over
specific programs such as under
developed countries, defense, and
the role of nuclear war. “Commu
nism, in the long run, is likely to
suffer from those differences,”
j said North. “The future is on our
side.”
“The recent Communist congress in East Germany lias not
brought any substantive changes in East Berlin or in Soviet for
eign policy,” believes Professor Jan F. Triska of the Stanford Po
litical Science Department. But the meeting did illustrate the
strained relations between the Soviet and Chinese Communists.

Professor Triska pointed out-"
that there have been four recent
congresses in the Eastern satel
lite states (Bulgaria, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, and East Ger
many), but that Khrushchev at
tended only the East German one.
The Chinese sent the same dele
gation, headed by Wu Hsiu-
Chuan, to all four.
“WHY 1)11) Khrushchev attend
the East German conference?”
asked Triska. “He went there es
sentially to express for all to see
the Soviet support of the East
German regime,” but at the same
time he was not supporting Wal
ter Ulbricht’s demands for a
peace treaty. "He went, he em
braced and kissed Ulbricht, but
he didn’t say Ulbricht was right.”
Khrushchev substituted himself
for a peace theaty.
Neither the East German nor
the Chinese problem advanced as
a result of the Communist con
gress, Triska noted. “I still think
the quarrel is going to come to a
head at a congress of all the
Communist parties. This is the
type of congress that China
wants,” Triska said. The last such
congress was in 1960. Soviet spon
sorship spoiled the other con
gresses for China.
“China is playing for support
of the other Communist parties
for her particular points of view
on such questions as Cuba, India,
and nuclear war,” Triska stated.
"Both Khrushchev and Commu
nist China are fishing in muddy
waters for support.”
AT PRESENT, the Sino-Soviet
split of world Communist sup
port is approximately two to
eight, he estimated. But the Chi-
I nese are gaining support in the
important underdeveloped areas
of South East Asia which look to
China for advice. Triska stated
that the Chinese need more Com
munist party support, especially
a foothold in the West. So far,
their only supporters are North
Korea and Albania. The Chinese
Communists lost some influence
in an Italian Communist confer
ence last year.

Triska noted the fact that since
last fall’s Cuban crisis, the So
viet Union has been on the de
fensive, putting the U.S. and the
West in an offensive position.
This situation is an attempt by
the Soviets to get Increased back
ing from the other Communist
countries.
THE SOVIETS are more cau
tious in their foreign policy than
are the Chinese, Triska stated. As
far back as 1946, Khrushchev
said that war is not fatalistically
inevitable. The threat of nuclear
war is acting as a deterent.
Triska believes that our warn
ings to the Soviets have finally
been understood for what they
are. The western powers are de
termined not to be pushed out of
Berlin.
