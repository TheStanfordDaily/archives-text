# REPLY TO CHRISMAN
## UN 						Intervention Necessary for Congo Solution 
### ALBERT NNOLI 
I do not wish to engage in
polemics or any form of mud
slinging especially when I am con
vinced the other party has not got
the facts at its command and fol
lows the dictates of sentiments.

Mr'. Weinig sought reasons for
Kennedy’s support of the U.N. ac
tion in Katanga and I tried to
furnish these.
NOW >IR. CHRISMAN wishes
to Ire enlightened on the Katanga
issue and 1 am willing to perfor m
this task because I believe that
the foreign student is here not
only to learn but also to contrib
ute to the education of his Ameri
can counterparts. But Mr. Chris

man’s psychological escape-meth
od of camouflaging his ignorance
of the events in question by say
ing it was I, not he, who was ig
norant is not the best way to seek
this enlightenment.
In July, 1960, there was no time
in Katanga for a referendum, but
if the secessionist demand had
been genuine, it could not have
been an on-fhe-spur-of-the-moment
decision and an on-the-spot action.
There was time enough between
the end of the second Brussels
Round Table Conference which
dealt with the economic relation
ships of the Congo Provinces in
February, and July for a referen
dum. Besides, there was a good
alternative to a referendum— the
pre-independence general elections
of May and June.
Why did Tshombe not make
secession an election issue? Also,
why did Tshombe vote against
universal adult suffrage for such
an election at the first Brussels
Round Table Conference? The
reason is obvious, for Tshombe
knew he did not have the support
of the masses in Katanga since
his Conakat party derives its in
fluence from the few middle class.
In fact, after the elections, the
Balubakat party of M. Sendwe
had won over a third of (he seats
for Katanga, the Fedeka and At
car parties a few seats each, with
the Conakat having a slim major
ity over these to enable it to con
trol the Katanga Assembly. The
Conakat stood alone against the
other parties on secession and so
Tshombe brought pressure to bear
on the Central Government and
the Belgians to amend the two
third requirement for a forum in
the provincial assembly. M. Bom
boko and Tshombe in requesting
Belgian assistance lacked the wis
dom and foresight to realize that
European business interests were
attempting to continue domination
of their country after giving them
a nominal independence.

MR. CHRISMAN does not know
that Katanga contains three ma
jor tribes, the Balubas to the
North, and the Bembe and Lunda
to the South. Of these, only the
Lunda give majority support to
Conakat. The Balubas are hostile
to it while the Bembes are indif
ferent. The Balubas, although the
largest single tribe in the Congo,
are in the minority in Katanga
where the Lundas are in the ma
jority.

When the Balubas expressed
their intention not to be part of
a separate Katanga, Tshombe re
plied by burning villages and cut
ting throats. Besides, the relation
ship of the Lunda tribe of Katan
ga to the rest of the Congo is

exactly the same as those of the
Balubas, the Bembes, the Luluas,
the Bekongos, the Bayakas, the
Bassones, (he Batetelas, and the
Mongos.
If the Katangese do not have
something in common with the
rest, neither of the others has
something in common with the
rest. What Mr. Chrisman’s argu
ment implies is that the Congo
should be broken up into states
as numerous as the tribes and I
am sure he would not want this
to happen. As for sustaining the
war, any self ■ imposed dictator
with the loyalty of the army and
a good treasury can support a
war for decades. This does not
show public support of him.

MOREOVER, the confusion and
bloodshed itr the Congo took so
long because the U.N. at the out
set was unwilling to use force,
thinking they could trust the
double-dealing and double-faced
Tshombe. When they lost confi
dence in him, the engagement
lasted just a few weeks. Moreover,
it will pay Mr. Chrisman to check
in African magazines in Hoover
Library for the penalty recom
mended by some influential sec
tions of Katangese public opinion,
including relatives of Tshombe
and his interior minister Munon
go, for Tshombe and his hench
men.

It is interesting that Mr. Chris
man supports Tshombe’s plans to
gobble up Lumumba’s cabinet.
Tshombe was more interested in
demanding two, and not three, as
Chrisman said, cabinet scats than
in organizing an effective party
strong enough to win enough
seats in the country to warrant
these ministerial claims. Of the
113 political groupings which con
tested the 137 seats in the Assem
bly, Conakat was not among the
ten which had candidates in more
than three of the 26 electoral dis
tricts. Its activities were limited
to Katanga, and Katanga is the
most sparsely populated province
of the Congo.
Despite these, Tshombe wished
to have a great part to play in
determining the destiny of the
rest of the Congolese because the
rich mines are in Katanga. He con
tinually brandished the rich Ka
tanga mines as a weapon of black
mail, hut when Lumumba stood
his grounds, Tshombe’s request
would mean that the PUNA, PSA,
PNP, PP, MNPDC, UNIPONGO.
the Abako and the MNC parties
which fared much better than the
Conakat would have their share
of cabinet seats magnified by a
ratio which would make cabinet
government look stupid. The
Brussels Round Table Conference
which considered the political re
lationships of the Congo Provin
ces was attended by 44 Congo del
egates and 30 advisers. Of these
Conakat had six and Kasavubu’s
Abako eleven.

If Mr. Chrisman believes in ma
jority decision, there is no reason
why he should wish the Congo
lese and the Belgians to endorse

the balkanization plans of the
minority of the delegation led by
Kasavubu and Tshombe. I quite
realize (hat the “loi fundamentale”
was flue for ratification two years
after .independence but that did
not mean that there was no law
in the Congo. The pre-independ
ence constitution which gave le
gality to the provisional govern
ment was still in force and it
never gave Tshombe right or
choice of secession and this was
the constitution 1 referred to since
the new one was not in force.
If the Balubas of Northern Ka
tanga were in open rebellion
against Tshombe’s authorities, the
U. N. was supposed to protect
them because they stood for the
status quo which was allegiance
to the Central government and
did not want to be a party to
Tshombe’s criminal secessionist
action. It was Katanga’s rebellion
led by Tshombe that the U.N. was
supposed to quench.
MOREOVER, there is no ques
tion here of interfering in the in
ternal affairs of a country since
it was the Congolese government
which invited the U.N. to help
stop the Belgian paratroop inva
sion of the State and restore the
status quo.
Surely, peace was a motive, for
otherwise the Congo fighting
would still be raging. It is hard
to believe that Mr, Chrisman and
Mr. Weining cannot determine
who the thief in the Congo is.
They argue that the wealth from
the mines of Katanga belong to
Tshombe and his henchmen.
These mines had been opened and
worked by permission of the Cen
tral Government and its benefits
shared by the whole country for
over eighty years. Now suddenly
it belongs to Katanga alone be
cause the robber Tshombe has
guns enough to rob the rest of
the Congo of its share.
May I remind Mr. Chrisman
that genuine motives for entering
politics is that of kindness to oth
ers, defense of what is right and
help to fellow men, and so I agree
with him that Kennedy was play
ing politics—not throwing crumbs
to African States.

FINALLY may I tell him that
his analogy with Ukraine and
Georgia in Russia is a false one.
In Katanga there is no question
of self-determination except that
of Tshombe on how much power
he is to have. I never implied that
U.N. intervention in the Congo
will solve the country’s problems,
but without it, it would take a
very long time before the Congo
lese leaders would settle down to
think of their problems. I had
also thought that the Castro les
son would have changed people’s
minds about hasty decisions on
who is the friend of the West.
