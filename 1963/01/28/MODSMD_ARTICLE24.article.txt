Editor, Tin* Daily;
I have neyer before made a
public statement of opinion or
have argued publicly against
someone who has. But today I
see speakers stifled by those
who, constitutionally, have only
an equal right to voice.
I am not owned by, but do I
identify myself with, Stanford. I
am sure that if I made a state
ment worthy of publication, my
name would not be associated
with it, but a phrase such as “a
Stanford student said” would
mark my words. But “a Stanford
student” does not denote Stan
ford University. At least 1 be
lieved that the University was
too strong to be hurt by a single
student’s words—until Friday.
Now I have found out how
small this school and its adminis
tration believe they are. They are
bothered by trivialities, and ex
plode these details of conduct as
if they had import capable of
scorching the grass on the front
lawn. They do not have enough
responsibilities now', so they have
to claim ownership of their stu
dents’ voices for their own pro
tection. Maybe the students
should stop, for the time being,
taking “public stands on issues
affecting affairs beyond the Stan
ford campus,” and begin to take
strong public stands on affairs
within the Stanford campus.
There is one right which they
cannot refuse, and that is to fight
bigotry on its own ground. When
public statement is made by one
party to a dispute, the other par
ty should also have the right to
public statement. Therefore,
since Dean Winbigler’s state
ments have been made public, let
anyone who disagrees with the
administration’s restrictive policy
come forward, and use this, the
only platform they have not
burned.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Rosencranz, in his presi
dential campaign last year, ap
plied liberally the word “pom
pous” to campus politicians. This
condition of being pompous, un
fortunately, seems to be inherent
in the condition of being a cam
pus politician, for how else, when
compared with reality, can the
position of Mr. Rosencranz and
LASSU regarding their right to
represent the entire Stanford stu
dent body be described? That
these pompous politicians should
claim to represent me, and the
remaining large percentage* of
Stanford students who did not
even bother to vote in last year’s
student elections, on an issue of
off-campus significance, is ludi
crous. In practice, Stanford stu
dent government is, as it ought
to be, just another activity for
those w'ho are interested, not a
gimmick for amplifying the im
portance of personal opinions of
such as Mr. Rosencranz and the
members of LASSU.
