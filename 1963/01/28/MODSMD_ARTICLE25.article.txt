# Wee Scottish Laddie Leads Cards to Convincing Win Over Universities
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
Led by the fine running of Scot
tish grad student Gordon Waddell,
Stanford’s varsity ruggers down
ed a strong Universities Club
squad 11-3 on the Card field Sat
urday.
Waddell contributed to an al
ready perceptible Stanford advan
tage in the open field. Universities
throughout much of the game out
scrummed the Cards, and ex-Cal
player Bob Chiappone single-hand
edly controlled a majority of the

i lineouls for the visitors.
UNIVERSITIES couldn’t con
tain or equal Stanford’s well-dis
ciplined running attack, however.
Waddell, Beau Bianchi, Nate
i Shaw, and Dick Mac Queen all con
tributed to the Cards’ “defensive”
running. Although Universities
was in possession of the ball a
good portion of the time, Stanford
could generally count on the quick
run to take them out of danger.
Universities dominated the
opening minutes, keeping the In
dians boxed in with their hacks to
I lie goal. Then Waddell, faking
land cutting back at midfield, car
l l ied almost to the Universities
I goal. Stanford managed to hold
I tiie position, and Waddell powered
over for a well-earned try. Braden
I Beck missed the conversion in
| what could have been a crucial
play.
Universities bounced back, trap
ping Stanford fullback Bianchi in
1 ihe Card end zone. Bianchi man
aged to touch the ball down to
prevent the tying score just as
the half ended.
THE VISITORS would not be
stopped so easily, though, scoring
almost immediately after Ihe he
t ginning of the second half. John
Harrison missed the conversion,
leaving the score tied and taking
some of the pressure off of the
i Stanford squad.
Universities seemed ready to
I score again, but some key defen
sive work in the form of a pair
of bruising tackles by Randy
Vahan gave Stanford possession.
Finally, the Card scrum began to
show its strength, moving the ball
smartly back to scrum half Boh
Price. His good lead passes to
standoff Waddell sparked a sus
tained drive for the Cards. Tim
Hansel carried for the score, and
1 Waddell converted.
ON THE SECOND Stanford try.
Bianchi played a key role, carry
ing through most of the Univer
sities defense, and then passing
to Hansel, who went in easily
from the left.
The addition of A1 Hildebrand,
I who had been out with an injured
knee, helped the Stanford lineoul
position. He was able to contain
Chiappone to some extent at least.
A short Universities kick had
Stanford knocking at the gates
once again with five minutes re
maining.
IN SCRUM POSITION on the
five yard lin.e the Cards seemed
ready to score, but a penalty
moved the ball back to midfield.
Stanford had a beautiful run for
a try nullified by another penalty,
but finally got the clincher down
th e right sideline, courtesy of
Mac Queen.
Waddell faked the University
defense, passed to recent varsity
| addition Steve Th u rIo w, and
| moved into position for a return
I pass. Thurlow did some nice run
ning of his own, and fed back to
Waddell. Mac Queen came running
hard down the sideline, Waddell
threw another fake which moved
the defense in to the center, and
Mac Queen was in to score.
WADDELL then demonstrated
to the capacity crowd why a rug
by conversion is worth two points.
He missed his attempt, hut only
by inches, and from barely a yard
inside the right sideline.
Stanford’s Jayvees, after con
tributing players to make up a
full squad for the undermanned
San Jose Rugby Club, went on
towin 11-0 in the preliminary con
test. Both varsity and junior var
sity are now 2-0 for the season.

tained drive for the Cards. Tim
Hansel carried for the score, and
1 Waddell converted.
ON THE SECOND Stanford try.
Bianchi played a key role, carry
ing through most of the Univer
sities defense, and then passing
to Hansel, who went in easily
from the left.
The addition of A1 Hildebrand,
I who had been out with an injured
knee, helped the Stanford lineoul
position. He was able to contain
Chiappone to some extent at least.
A short Universities kick had
Stanford knocking at the gates
once again with five minutes re
maining.
IN SCRUM POSITION on the
five yard lin.e the Cards seemed
ready to score, but a penalty
moved the ball back to midfield.
Stanford had a beautiful run for
a try nullified by another penalty,
but finally got the clincher down
th e right sideline, courtesy of
Mac Queen.
Waddell faked the University
defense, passed to recent varsity
| addition Steve Th u rIo w, and
| moved into position for a return
I pass. Thurlow did some nice run
ning of his own, and fed back to
Waddell. Mac Queen came running
hard down the sideline, Waddell
threw another fake which moved
the defense in to the center, and
Mac Queen was in to score.
WADDELL then demonstrated
to the capacity crowd why a rug
by conversion is worth two points.
He missed his attempt, hut only
by inches, and from barely a yard
inside the right sideline.
Stanford’s Jayvees, after con
tributing players to make up a
full squad for the undermanned
San Jose Rugby Club, went on
towin 11-0 in the preliminary con
test. Both varsity and junior var
sity are now 2-0 for the season.
