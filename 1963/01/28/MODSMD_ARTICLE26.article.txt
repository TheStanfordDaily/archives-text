ALTHOUGH HIS EXPRESSION is somewhat unorthodox, Steve Cartwright's hurdling form is impec
cable, as he demonstrated Saturday by deadheating for first place at the Oregon Invitational Indoor
Track Meet. Although C. K. Yang was most noticibly in the limelight for setting a new pole vault
record at 16-3¼, Stanford performers managed to carve out their own niche, taking a first, two
seconds, and two thirds. Cartwright tied with Bob Pierce, a USC speedster, in a respectable 7.4.
