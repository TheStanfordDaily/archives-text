# Student Critique of Profs, Courses Will Appear in April Scratch Sheet
## 
### DAVE STEINHART 
The Scratch Sheet, a student
critique of courses and teaching,
has been reorganized and will bo
published in time for Spring pre
registration.
COMMENTS in the Scratch
Sheet are based on a poll among
Juniors and Seniors who major
in Humanities and Sciences. The
poll will start in living groups by
questionnaires being distributed
on Wednesday. January 30.
The philosophy behind the
Scratch Sheet is that many
courses at Stanford are, in the
frank estimate of students taking
them, poorly taught or badly or
ganized. The Scratch Sheet, by
assimilating and making public
what students think about their
courses, hopes to influence revi
sions where they seem in demand.
Some people have doubted the

ability or the right of students to
criticize professors. The Scratch
Sheet disagrees. It holds that stu
dents must be the judges of how
much they are benefiting from a
given course, and that, where the
benefit is low, most students are
capable of intelligent suggestions
for improvement.
MANY PROFESSORS have
warmly received the idea of teach
er evaluation. Some run their own
polls at the quarter’s end; others
rely on informal comments. How
ever, such free and open communi
cation is not the general rule. And
even where it is the rule, there are
understandable reasons why a stu
dent might disguise his real feel
ings in a face to face meeting with
the professor. The Scratch Sheet
plans to answer the need for
teaching evaluation in a manner
that is both public and objectively
frank.

Wednesday’s questionnaire wall
be exacting upon the student’s pa
tience. Each student will be asked
to complete five questionaires for
five courses he has taken in his
major. Since each form requires
at least 10 minutes, the total time
will run nearly an hour, perhaps
more for those with much to say.
The consolation for this work
will have to rest in the final prod
uct; the magazine, a course-by
course summary of the results of
the poll, will appear in time to
help students fill their study lists
for Spring quarter.

MANY PROFESSORS have
warmly received the idea of teach
er evaluation. Some run their own
polls at the quarter’s end; others
rely on informal comments. How
ever, such free and open communi
cation is not the general rule. And
even where it is the rule, there are
understandable reasons why a stu
dent might disguise his real feel
ings in a face to face meeting with
the professor. The Scratch Sheet
plans to answer the need for
teaching evaluation in a manner
that is both public and objectively
frank.

Wednesday’s questionnaire wall
be exacting upon the student’s pa
tience. Each student will be asked
to complete five questionaires for
five courses he has taken in his
major. Since each form requires
at least 10 minutes, the total time
will run nearly an hour, perhaps
more for those with much to say.
The consolation for this work
will have to rest in the final prod
uct; the magazine, a course-by
course summary of the results of
the poll, will appear in time to
help students fill their study lists
for Spring quarter.
The Scratch Sheet, a student
critique of courses and teaching,
has been reorganized and will bo
published in time for Spring pre
registration.
COMMENTS in the Scratch
Sheet are based on a poll among
Juniors and Seniors who major
in Humanities and Sciences. The
poll will start in living groups by
questionnaires being distributed
on Wednesday. January 30.
The philosophy behind the
Scratch Sheet is that many
courses at Stanford are, in the
frank estimate of students taking
them, poorly taught or badly or
ganized. The Scratch Sheet, by
assimilating and making public
what students think about their
courses, hopes to influence revi
sions where they seem in demand.
Some people have doubted the

ability or the right of students to
criticize professors. The Scratch
Sheet disagrees. It holds that stu
dents must be the judges of how
much they are benefiting from a
given course, and that, where the
benefit is low, most students are
capable of intelligent suggestions
for improvement.
