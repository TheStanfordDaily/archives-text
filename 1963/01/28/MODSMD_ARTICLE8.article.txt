Two Stanford Professors re
ceived awards this week, and a
third award winner will do re
search here this spring.
DK. GEORGE POLYA, emeri
tus professor of mathematics, has
received the Award for Distin
guished Service to Mathematics
from the Mathematical Associa
tion of America. The honor was
announced yesterday during a
meeting of the association at
the University of California at
Berkeley. The 75-year-old Stan
ford mathematician w y as cited for
“combining, during hi s distin
guished career, deep research on
a very broad front with an ever
present interest in mathematical
education.”

Noted among students for his
wit and high spirits, Dr. Polya
began teaching at Stanford in
1942 after 26 years at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology
at Zurich. His retirement in 1953
has had little effect on his brisk
schedule of writing and lecturing.
Of Dr. Polya’s 220 published
articles and six books, 24 of the
former and two of the latter have
been published since retirement.

A British scientific honor—the
Thomas Young Medal and Prize
of 50 guineas from London’s In
stitute of Physics and the Physi
cal Society—has been awarded to
Stanford Physics Prof. Arthur L.
Schawlow, along with MIT Pro
vost Charles H. Townes.
IT IS the second award within
a year for the two physicists, who
originated the laser, science’s
amazing new source of “coherent
light,” Last October the two phy
sicists received the Stuart Ballan
tine Medal of the Franklin Insti
tute of Philadelphia.
Prof. Chen Ning Yang, Chinese
born physicist who shared the
1957 Nobel Prize for demolishing
the "principle of parity” a cher
ished law of physics—will be a
visiting professor at Stanford Uni
versity this spring.. From mid-
April to mid-June Prof. Yang
plans to carry on research at Stan
ford’s Institute for Theoretical
Physics. His collaborators will in
clude Profs. Leonard I. Schiff,
Sidney D. Drell, and John D. Wal
ecka. He also will present several
seminars for students and faculty.

schedule of writing and lecturing.
Of Dr. Polya’s 220 published
articles and six books, 24 of the
former and two of the latter have
been published since retirement.

A British scientific honor—the
Thomas Young Medal and Prize
of 50 guineas from London’s In
stitute of Physics and the Physi
cal Society—has been awarded to
Stanford Physics Prof. Arthur L.
Schawlow, along with MIT Pro
vost Charles H. Townes.
IT IS the second award within
a year for the two physicists, who
originated the laser, science’s
amazing new source of “coherent
light,” Last October the two phy
sicists received the Stuart Ballan
tine Medal of the Franklin Insti
tute of Philadelphia.
Prof. Chen Ning Yang, Chinese
born physicist who shared the
1957 Nobel Prize for demolishing
the "principle of parity” a cher
ished law of physics—will be a
visiting professor at Stanford Uni
versity this spring.. From mid-
April to mid-June Prof. Yang
plans to carry on research at Stan
ford’s Institute for Theoretical
Physics. His collaborators will in
clude Profs. Leonard I. Schiff,
Sidney D. Drell, and John D. Wal
ecka. He also will present several
seminars for students and faculty.
Two Stanford Professors re
ceived awards this week, and a
third award winner will do re
search here this spring.
DK. GEORGE POLYA, emeri
tus professor of mathematics, has
received the Award for Distin
guished Service to Mathematics
from the Mathematical Associa
tion of America. The honor was
announced yesterday during a
meeting of the association at
the University of California at
Berkeley. The 75-year-old Stan
ford mathematician w y as cited for
“combining, during hi s distin
guished career, deep research on
a very broad front with an ever
present interest in mathematical
education.”

Noted among students for his
wit and high spirits, Dr. Polya
began teaching at Stanford in
1942 after 26 years at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology
at Zurich. His retirement in 1953
has had little effect on his brisk
schedule of writing and lecturing.
