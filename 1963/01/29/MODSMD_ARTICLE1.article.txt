## 
### ROBERT NAYLOR 
A survey conducted yesterday by The Daily of key faculty
members revealed a wide range of reaetoins to the Administra
tion’s policy concerning the rights of Legislature to speak out on
political issues.
There was a general agreement on the rights of students to

speak on political affairs and on
the immediate need for a clarifi
cation of the meaning of the
founding grant. According to
Professor David Freeman. Assist
ant Dean of the School of Law,
until such a clarificatoin is ob
tained, the present policy is just
ified, "hut as an interim measure
only.”
Freeman added that students
“cannot divorce themselves en
tirely from the University,”
which is responsible for what
comes from the campus. Certain
understandable precautions are
not "an infringement on any Con
stitutional, God-given rights.”
PROFESSOR Carlton A. Ped
erson, Associate Dean of the
Graduate School of Business, de
nied that the latest administra
tion action in any way limited
the freedom of speech. All stu
dents, he said, can say whatever
they want when acting as in
dividuals, but not when repre
senting the University. Pederson
expressed “complete and enthu
siastic support of the administra
tion.”
Professor Kenneth A, Arrow,
head of the Dept, of Economics,
emphasized that the University
has not hesitated to take a stand
on matters of a non-partisan vari
ety and that the same privileges
should be extended to the stu
dents, “if the opinion is carefully
labeled.”
“I cannot conceive of any spe
cial circumstances which would
require limiting freedom of
speech on Campus,” said Profes
sor John W. Dodds, Director of
Humanities Special Programs.
PROFESSOR Sanford M. Dorn
busch, head of the Sociology De
partment. in a special statement
to The Daily, stated, “The inter
ests of the students and aspira
tions of the University are both
moving in the direction of great
er student participation in po
litical affairs. Unfortunately this
gradual evolution is slower than
desired by a student government
whoso term of office is one or
two years. Though I sympathize
with the desires of students, I be
lieve that drawing the line in
temperately automatically de
fines the problem as ‘Who is run
ning the University?’ I doubt
that anything very useful will be
accomplished this year, but to
day’s furor will help the next
generation of students.”
Stanford students will have
further opportunity to hear fac
ulty members when Stanford To
day and Tomorrow presents a
group of seminars after dinner
tomorrow in the lounges of sev
eral living groups.
The speakers for the after-din
ner discussions will be Dr. James
T. Watkins, Roble Lounge; Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Branner
Lounge; Dr. Lewis Spitz. Lassen;
Dr. Charles Beye, Serra; Mr.
Robert Beyers, Larkin; Mr. Don
ald Carlson, Muir; Dean David
Larimer, Burbank.
