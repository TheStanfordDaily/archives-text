# An Indictment Of The University For Hypocrisy
## 
### 
Of all the University’s indefensible actions of the last five
clays, the most hypocritical has been its protest against the letter
sent by ASSU President Annin Rosencranz to Senator Thomas
Dodd and FCC Chairman Newton Minow expressing “grave con
cern over the Internal Security subcommittee’s investigation of
the Pacifica Foundation, sponsors of the radio station KPFA-
Berkeley." (See verbatim copy of letter in next column.) Incited
by tin's allegedly partisan stand, the University clamped down on
student organizations. Now no student organization or officer
may speak out publicly on issues of wide concern unless the Uni
versity Censor has put his seal of approval on the subject matter.
The hypocrisy of the University’s response to Rosencranz’s
letter is blatantly revealed in its circular of last November which
urged a “Yes-vote” on Proposition 13. (See verbatim copy in next
column.) In this circular, sent by postcard to “friends" of Stan
ford, the University advocates the passage of the Proposition in a
state-wide referendum. Because the Administration has decided
that the Founding Grant prohibits University involvement in par
tisan political expression as being partisan political adivity and
since the University is undeniably the University, this Proposition
had to be considered non-partisan by President Sterling. Indeed,
the postcard reads: “This non-partisan Proposition . . The
sentence after this explains why the' Proposition is considered non
partisan: "It was approved by a 103-1 vote of the (state) Legis
lature and has the endorsement of both major political parties,
both gubernatorial candidate's, and a host of state and local or
ganizations . . . Although the Proposition was supported by
both major political parties, there were ox era million “no-votes.”
Nevertheless, the University considered the 1 Proposition to be non
partisan. Why? Because the issue was irrelevant to party allegi
ance. In short, the issue did not attract unanimity of agreement,
but it was non-partisan because it was divorced from party lines.
And so when LASSU last autumn passed resolutions supporting
Proposition 13 and condemning Proposition 24, the University did
not protest to the ASSU.
But last Thursday, the University did pretest—and on an issue
which meets the definition of non-partisan as the University im
plicitly proclaimed it in November: irrelevant to party allegiance
although there is no unanimity of opinion on the issue. We agree
with the University’s interpretation and ask how the University
can be consistent in saying that Rosencranz’s letter is partisan in
the sense of their own definition found in President Sterling’s
official letter. This is hypocrisy. It is indefensible.
In this matter the University is totally unaware of anything
called intellectual consistency. As a substitute, it bas acted by the
test of expediency all the while proclaiming the irresponsibility
and immaturity of students. Even while chastising students for
their irresponsibility in not keeping the Union grounds tidy, the
University indulges in the most flagrant abuses of its own respon
sibility to be intellectually honest.
