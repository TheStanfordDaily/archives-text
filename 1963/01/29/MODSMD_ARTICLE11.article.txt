The University has directed that students may not take public
stands on issues of national significance without prior University
approval of the subject matter. Less than ten weeks ago, an official
high in the University hierarchy said that although students could
not be understood to constitute the University legally, there were
many people in the outside world who would erroneously construe
a student stand to be a University position, and therefore, the
University could not permit students to speak out collectively. In
brief, the University does not wish to afford the time, effort, and
expense of giving forthright answers to outsiders accusing the
University of endorsing student stands.
