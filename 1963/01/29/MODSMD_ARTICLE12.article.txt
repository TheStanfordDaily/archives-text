Editor, The Daily: The following
letter has been sent to President
Sterling:
Dear Dr. Sterling;
This is an open letter to you,
Senator Dodd, the “Stanford
Daily,” and the “San Francisco
Examiner.” I wish to publicly
endorse the statement issued by
you to Armin Rosencranz regard
ing his irresponsible action in ex
pressing the opinion of a small
minority of Stanford students by
writing to Senator Thomas Dodd
and F.C.C. Chairman Newton
Minow over the KPFA issue.
This open defiance of University
policy is anarchy, not academic
freedom of thought and action.
Stanford University spares no
expense, time, nor effort in culti
vating and equipping its students
to think and act in the world of
affairs concerning our unique
form of government, but their
first allegiance should be to Stan
ford during this period of their
preparation to enter into the
larger scene; for that very rea
son, the student should be doubly
aware of his present responsi
bility.

We must avoid at all cost any

thing that would undermine what
has taken so many years to build.
Until the individual is actually
standing on his own two feet and
is responsible for his own acts,
he has no right to use the Univer
sity as a shield behind which to
hide.

Editor, The Daily:
I wish to protest the use of co
ercion to obtain money for the
W.U.S. Granting that the W.U.S.
is worthy of support, is the 20
cent tax applied to the price of
the Sunday night flick a proper
means? I say no! If the 20 cents
per ticket were going to the Birch
Society, there would be all man
ner of protests, but because
W.U.S. is a good cause, the ethi
cal wrong is obscured. Does a
good cause justify coercion? If
students want to contribute to
the W.U.S., let them, but. volun
tarily! And I suggest this prin
ciple is not trivial; the idea that
mere need justifies confiscation
is rampant in this world.

policy is anarchy, not academic
freedom of thought and action.
Stanford University spares no
expense, time, nor effort in culti
vating and equipping its students
to think and act in the world of
affairs concerning our unique
form of government, but their
first allegiance should be to Stan
ford during this period of their
preparation to enter into the
larger scene; for that very rea
son, the student should be doubly
aware of his present responsi
bility.

We must avoid at all cost any

thing that would undermine what
has taken so many years to build.
Until the individual is actually
standing on his own two feet and
is responsible for his own acts,
he has no right to use the Univer
sity as a shield behind which to
hide.

Editor, The Daily:
I wish to protest the use of co
ercion to obtain money for the
W.U.S. Granting that the W.U.S.
is worthy of support, is the 20
cent tax applied to the price of
the Sunday night flick a proper
means? I say no! If the 20 cents
per ticket were going to the Birch
Society, there would be all man
ner of protests, but because
W.U.S. is a good cause, the ethi
cal wrong is obscured. Does a
good cause justify coercion? If
students want to contribute to
the W.U.S., let them, but. volun
tarily! And I suggest this prin
ciple is not trivial; the idea that
mere need justifies confiscation
is rampant in this world.

Sterling:
Dear Dr. Sterling;
This is an open letter to you,
Senator Dodd, the “Stanford
Daily,” and the “San Francisco
Examiner.” I wish to publicly
endorse the statement issued by
you to Armin Rosencranz regard
ing his irresponsible action in ex
pressing the opinion of a small
minority of Stanford students by
writing to Senator Thomas Dodd
and F.C.C. Chairman Newton
Minow over the KPFA issue.
This open defiance of University
policy is anarchy, not academic
freedom of thought and action.
