### 
(Editor’s note: A careful read
ing of ASSU President Annin
Kosencranz’s letter to Senator
Dodd and Chairman Minow will
show that Rosencranz expressed
no more than a concern over the
investigation. No condemnation
of the investigation anti no charge
of unconstitutional ity are in
volved. )
“On behalf of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
1 would like to express grave
concern over the Internal Securi
ty Subcommittee’s investigation
of tiie Pacifica Foundation, spon
sors of radio station KPFA
Berkeley.
“KPFA is a favorite station
among Stanford students, and
many of our students and profes
sors have appeared on KPFA pro
grams, Rather than engage in
the insipid and unimaginative
programming so characteristic of
radio stations, the KPFA people
present a variety of intelligent,
illuminating, and educationally
valuable programs. If many of
these programs present liberal or
leftist viewpoints we find our
selves merely challenged and
stimulated the more. Surely the
sophisticated audience to whom
such programs are directed can
discriminate between valid ideas.
“Propaganda, of course, may
be excluded from the airwaves
by appropriate FCC action. There
is no suggestion that the Pacifica
Foundation has engaged in such
illegal behavior, nor is there any
reasonable expectation that it
will do so.
“Because the right to search
and question freely and to ex
press ideas, however unorthodox,
without fear of reprisal is so fun
damental to academic freedom in
America, and because KPFA is
an important channel in the com
munication of such ideas and
opinions, we have taken this op
portunity to make our concern
known. We will follow further de
velopments in this case with in
terest and close attention.’’

President, ASSU
(Editor’s note: The following
letter to “Alumni, Parents, and
Friends of Stanford" was mailed
before the November election.)
“Private colleges and universi
ties enroll one-third of all Cali
fornia’s full-time, four-year stu
dents.
“Like Stanford, many private
institutions plan further growth.
Their expansion will enhance the
vigor and independence of all
higher education in California.
“You can support this growth
by voting YES on Proposition 13
at the November 6 election.
“This nonpartisan proposition
provides property tax exemption
on all land used exclusively for
educational purposes by private
colleges and universities. It was
approved by a 103-1 vote of the
legislature and has the endorse
ment of both major political par
ties both gubernatorial candi
dates, and a host of state and
local organizations.
“Stanford already enjoys this
exemption, thanks to a State con
stitutional provision adopted by
the voters in 1900 and special ac
tion by the State Legislature
three years ago. Although it
therefore has no direct stake in
Proposition 13, Stanford supports
passage of the measure as a
means to foster continued growth
of private higher education in
this state.”
J. E. Wallace Sterling,
President
