Editor, The Daily:
The Hume Society has sent
the following letter to President
Sterling:
Dear President Sterling;
The Hume Society is gravely
concerned over the attitude of
the University Administration to
ward freedom of expression of
student organizations. The recent
action against the Legislature of
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University and its president,
Armin Rosencranz, is an alarm
ing manifestation of this atti
tude.
We insist on the right of stu
dents and student organizations
to express their views.
We affirm our support of the
letters by Armin Rosencranz to
Newton Minow and Thomas
Dodd.
We affirm our support of the
recent resolutions of the Legisla
ture of the Associated Students
of Stanford University.
We, also, are concerned over
the Senate Internal Security Sub
committee’s investigation of
KPFA and the failure of the Fed
eral Communications Commis
sion to renew KPFA’s license. We
have accordingly sent letters to
Mr. Minow and Senators Dodd,
Engle and Kuchcl to that effect.
Sincerely,
The Hume Society
Executive Committee
Marcia Muelder
