# 'About Three Score And A Couple Years Ago'
## 
### STEVE ZOUSMER Contributing Editor 
About three score and a couple
years ago our Founding Fathers
brought forth on this campus a
new university conceived in liber
ality and dedicated to the propo
sition that there shall be no
smoking on Inner Quad and that
no students get smarty-pantsed
and start expressing political
opinions which might embarrass
somebody. Right now we are en
gaged in a big argument testing
whether this university, or for
that matter any other university
so conceived and so dedicated,
can go along keeping its mouth
shut when responsibility to its
lofty goals demands that it speak
out, which seems to be the alto
gether fitting and proper thing
to do. In a larger sense, can we
be serious about consecrating and
hallowing this acreage when
there are a bunch of men, living
and dead, who are set to slap
our hands and send us home if
we don’t hallow and consecrate
it just the way they want. Could
it be that they are messing
around with our poor power to

add or detract? The world might
never write down any notes or
remember for long what we feel
here, just because of what THEY
did here. It it for us, the living,
to continue putting up with this
jazz? Or is it rather for us to be
here dedicated to the greater
task remaining before us, for
which we are here equipped, and
which we really can’t ignore if
we want to be educated, cool, and
responsible citizens. The devotion
and good intention of the honored
dead should not be questioned,
but neither should their ill-fore
sight of a later day be perpetu
ated, don’t you think? So we have
to here dedicate our bods to the
goal that the terms of their
death are not going to constrain
posterity around here, and in this
we won’t bo twiddling our toe
nails in vain because the univer
sity will have a new birth of free
dom—of which the winds are
blowing rather weakly these
days—and the free thought and
vigilance which we here prepare
to exercise intelligently will not
disappear with our student body
cards when we got kicked out of
school.
