### DAVID STROUD 
Once upon a time, in the land
where the sun sets, there lived
an old man and his four sons.
The sons were the winds, and the
father was known as the father
of the winds. So restless were
these winds that the old man
their father felt obliged to keep
them closed op all day and all
night in a bag. But unceasingly
they clamored for release, mak
ing a tumult in the bag, until at
last he agreed to make them a
bigger house of their own. “I will
put my family in the groves of
the Academy,” he said, “and
there I will make them a home
of yellow stone and red tile.
Over them I will appoint one and
twenty men to whom their care
shall be entrusted. And in this
place the winds my sons shall
toss between them the golden
apples of delight, that their
minds may grow deeper and
their souls ferment. And thus
shall they do for all time.”
And so he did, and the winds
in time became content to play
at ball, while the hitter things of
the world, and likewise the
sweetnesses thereof, passed them
by, for they could not partake of
them without the loss of their
birthright. Every day their
games became more furious, and
up and down the hallowed corri
dors the winds shrieked madly,
while outside cities crumbled and
men died for their ideas.
The old generation died, and a
new one sprang up. And at last
those who were shut up in the
house of yellow stone and red
tile could hear it no longer, and
there was a confei’ence of the
winds. “We cannot stand and
watch the world fill up with
evil,” said one. “Behold, I have
written in behalf of all winds
condemning evil.” The winds
clamored agreement. But cities
continued to crumble, and men
went on dying as they would.
And the new father sternly bade
the winds go back to the echoing
corridors and the venerable
stones of the Academy. “No wind
has need to go silent,” he said,
“only let the prevailing breeze he
academic.”
And the winds saw that all was
against, them, and meekly bowed,
and said no more.

them without the loss of their
birthright. Every day their
games became more furious, and
up and down the hallowed corri
dors the winds shrieked madly,
while outside cities crumbled and
men died for their ideas.
The old generation died, and a
new one sprang up. And at last
those who were shut up in the
house of yellow stone and red
tile could hear it no longer, and
there was a confei’ence of the
winds. “We cannot stand and
watch the world fill up with
evil,” said one. “Behold, I have
written in behalf of all winds
condemning evil.” The winds
clamored agreement. But cities
continued to crumble, and men
went on dying as they would.
And the new father sternly bade
the winds go back to the echoing
corridors and the venerable
stones of the Academy. “No wind
has need to go silent,” he said,
“only let the prevailing breeze he
academic.”
And the winds saw that all was
against, them, and meekly bowed,
and said no more.
Once upon a time, in the land
where the sun sets, there lived
an old man and his four sons.
The sons were the winds, and the
father was known as the father
of the winds. So restless were
these winds that the old man
their father felt obliged to keep
them closed op all day and all
night in a bag. But unceasingly
they clamored for release, mak
ing a tumult in the bag, until at
last he agreed to make them a
bigger house of their own. “I will
put my family in the groves of
the Academy,” he said, “and
there I will make them a home
of yellow stone and red tile.
Over them I will appoint one and
twenty men to whom their care
shall be entrusted. And in this
place the winds my sons shall
toss between them the golden
apples of delight, that their
minds may grow deeper and
their souls ferment. And thus
shall they do for all time.”
And so he did, and the winds
in time became content to play
at ball, while the hitter things of
the world, and likewise the
sweetnesses thereof, passed them
by, for they could not partake of
them without the loss of their
birthright. Every day their
games became more furious, and
up and down the hallowed corri
dors the winds shrieked madly,
