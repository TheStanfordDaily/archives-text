team. The Daily runs this story

with the fervent hope (hat some
body, somewhere, understands
it.)
Stanford opened its cricket sea !
son in great style Sunday on the!
football practice field. Much
to the delight of the few hundred
spectators who braved the chilly
weather, Stanford trounced the
California Cricket Association,
126-125 (with seven outs unused).

Jnclivifluiil honors went to Mi
chael English and Elmo Perara,
who took six wickets and made
46 not out.

Stanford won the toss and
elected to field. English and Pra
san Mukherjee, who opened the
Indians’ attack, bowled slightly
short of length and got the ball
to rear up at times, much to the
discomfort of CCA’s opening
batsmen. Kasiraja, coming on in
place of English, commanded
some respect as he bowled his leg
breaks into the northeast breeze.
An hour had gone by and CCA
had SO on board with three wick
ets down

ENGLISH, in his second spell,
howled Stanford back into the
game. At lunchtime CCA was 100
for five. After lunch a rampant
! English let fly in magnificent
style for four overs, and by the
lend of them he had ripped the
CCA batting apart. ,
Stanford opened its innings at
a little after 3 p.m. with Ar.jun C
Saxena and Balan Salya. Both t
the batsmen played with delight- -
ful assurance. A lovely cover
drive by Salaya, the ball cutting
I a blazing trail as it sped to the
boundary, forced CCA’s captain
! to bring on the spinners.
SALAYA WAS bowled around
the pads, frying to go for a big
| hit. In came the stylish Perara.
i In quick lime he had the field
j disarranged and bedraggled. His
was a great inning which had the
[ spectators in raucous ecstasies of
delight. Saxena, with his hold
strokes, kept Stanford well ahead
of the clock.
In a desperate bid to stop this
brutal assault, the CCA captain
threw himself and his other fast
bowler into the attack. With the
! clock ticking away and the runs |
! piling up, they bowded faster and j
shorter.
Elmo, however, was not to be
perturbed. Square cutting and [
driving handsomely, Elmo dis-1
pensed his batting largesse like
a millionaire. After Saxena’s de
parture, James Meynell and |
f)hanjoo Ghista gave him stand |
jto enable him to complete the
rout.
