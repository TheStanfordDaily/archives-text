BOSTON- Robert Frost, four-time Pulitzer Prize winner and
unofficial poet laureate to the nation, died at a Boston hospital
today at the ago of 88. Authorities at Peter Bent Brigham Hos
pital said the white haired poet, a friend of President Kennedy, died
at 1:50 a.m.
Doctors only yesterday reported the condition of the ailing poet
had weakened in the past 48 hours.
Frost’s death ended a month-long battle against, a series of
critical complications which arose from major surgery to remove a
blockage of the urinary tract last Dec. 10. Shortly after the operation,
the elderly poet, who had enjoyed relatively good health until that
time, suffered a heart attack which left him near death. His re
covery from the heart seizure was further complicated by a series
of pulmonary embolisms, blood clots which invaded his lungs.
CLEMSON, S.C. Negro Harvey Gantt swept aside 100 years of
tradition and extended desegregation to the last of the nation’s 50
states yesterday when ho was accepted into Clemson College with
only a few jostful shouts. The nattily-dressed young Negro arrived
on campus accompanied by Matthew Perry, one of the attorneys
who fought his case through the courts and finally won an order
from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals directing that Gantt be
admitted to the previously all-white school.
