## 
### VIVIAN LEE 
South-African horn Blythe Thompson defended the partition
of the Union of South Africa and the segregation and independent
development of its peoples in a debate last night in Tresidder
Union against Allard K. Lowenstein, former Assistant Dean of
Men at Stanford and an authority on South African affairs.

“People are different and you
cannot by any legislative method
resolve these differences,” said
Thompson, who is chairman of
the African Society to Promote
Goodwill toward Africans.
“The only possible way out is
to recognize the differences be
tween peoples, to respect them,
and to provide ways for them to

liv'o in separate ways,” said
Thompson. He described the
South African aim as segregation
modeled on a commonwealth of
nations. Its closest analogy would
be the commonwealth of Europe
when it is “functioning properly
as the European Common Mar
ket.” said Thompson, who is pres
ently touring the U.S. as a lectur
er on South African affairs.
“FOR SEPARATE develop
ment. let the people you’re sepa
rating decide how they want to
bo separated, and under what
conditions,” said Lowenstein.
Quoting statements by South Af
rican government officials and
laws which restrict South Afri
can negroes, ho argued that there
is no sincere intent in the South
African government to separate
Africans into a situation where

they could live under standards
which would permit them im
provement.
The theory of “one man, one
vote” equality in South Africa
presupposes absolute equality of
opportunity, Thompson main
tained. If this policy wore fol
lowed in Africa today, the Afri
can would be condemned perma
nently by ordinary economic and
ordinary social factors to being
a permanent proletariat,” he pre
dicted. Then either revolution
like that in Russia in 1917 or the
permanent repression of minority
peoples in South Africa would
result.
LOWENSTEIN objected that
tree-elections and discussions for
whites and for blacks would
show “appalling differences in
concepts of social organization.

Allard K. Lowenstein, who
originally had planned to re
main at Stanford for a week
as a Guest-in-Residenee at
Stern and Wilbur, lias been
unexpectedly called back to
Washington and will leave to
day.
