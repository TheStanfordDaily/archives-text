# International Living Experience Told
## 
### MARTHA LITMAN 
The Experiment in International Living is a
private, non-profit organization in the field of in
ternational education, based upon the philosophy
that “significant advances toward world peace
can bo made at the individual level by introducing
the people of one country to the people of another
country through the basic social structure of the
family.” The primary feature is, therefore, ap
proximately one month spent with a family in
another country.
My Experiment last summer was to France
where I lived with a family in their sixteenth cen
tury chateau in the Cote d'Or country of Bur
gundy. In the family were Maman and her nine
children- seven girls and two boys aged 15 to 30.
The chateau is in the French wine country and
produces an excellent dry white wine. The family
is a very old one—both Maman and Papa, who is
deceased, come from families of the titled aristoc
racy- as well as educated and sophisticated ones.
We spoke only French.
The Experiment does not create a series of
temporary acquaintances. I correspond frequently
with Maman and several of my sisters; and Ma
man and my own parents correspond. Maman
refers to me as her daughter and considers me a
sister to her own children. I am her second Experi
ment daughter.
THE .SECOND part of the Experiment is the
informal trip. This is a two- to three-week journey
through the country by train, plane, boat, bus,

bicycle, on foot, or a combination of these. A
member, or members of the host family is asked
to go along.
Our informal trip was a 17-day bus-camping
trip from Lyons, our home city, through central
France, Brittany, and the Loire Valley. This was
followed by a five day-and-night adventure in
Paris for the Americans. During this and the
informal trip we all spoke nothing but French.
There were 11 American students, 15 French
youths, and one German girl.
Qualifications for the Experiment vary, al
though heavy emphasis is placed on the back
ground material and personal references which
are required of each applicant. The applicant’s
academic record is also considered. Financial aid
is available. Applicants for the collcge-age group
should bo between 19 and 30, although some coun
tries have a minimum age requirement.
THE PROGRAM chart for the Experiment in
1963 offers 38 possible countries including five in
Africa, three in Asia, four in Eastern Europe, four
in the Middle East, and the remaining 15 in West
ern Europe. Experienced persons between the
ages of 25 and 45 are encouraged to apply as
group leaders.
Only seven of these countries have a specific
language requirement.
The head of the Experiment office in San Fran
cisco, Miss Barbara Dinkos, will show a short
movie and answer questions at Room 270, Tresid
der, Thursday at 4:15.
