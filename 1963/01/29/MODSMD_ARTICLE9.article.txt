## 
### PAGE EDWARDS 
A new rushing policy to go into effect immediately has been
approved by President Sterling, announced Dean of Students,
H. Donald Winbigler yesterday.
The official policy provides for restricted open contact winter
quarter with an extended commitment period of seven weeks in

the spring. The IFC in Monday’s-'
meeting voted to retain the old
rushing policy of no contact until
next Monday so the IFC-IFB
Rush Committee can interpret
the new policy and propose any
additional restrictions to the IFC
that may be needed.
Tho policy, as approved by
President Sterling, is as follows:
A FALL QUARTER:
There will be no rushing con-

tact between upperclassmen
and freshmen.
B. WINTER QUARTER;
There will be restricted con
tact subject to the following
conditions:
1. No rushing contact
whatever is permitted off
the campus.
2. No rushing contact
by eating clubs and frater
nities is permitted with
freshmen in Wilbur or Stern.
3. Contact in Wilbur by
Stern residents is permited
to compensate for open
houses in clubs and fraterni
ties.
4. No commitments may be
made by the freshmen or the
upper-class living groups.
5. Additional restrictions
may be imposed on their re
spective groups by the Inter-
Fraternity Council, the Inter-
Club Council and the Inter-
House Council.
6. Otherwise open contact
is permitted on the campus.
C. SPRING QUARTER:
The same conditions will ap
ply during Spring Quarter as
during Winter Quarter with
the following exceptions:
1. There will be open con
tact off the campus on the
following dates; Thursday.

first week. Saturday of tho
third and fifth week.
2. Individuals may commit
themselves informally to any

year, May 15, 1963).
3. Restrictions regarding
freshmen eating in the up
per-class living groups may
be imposed on their respec
tive groups by tho IFC, the

in a living group.
4. No person (whether or
not he has given a volun
tary statement of commit
ment or intention) may bo

tributed before the official
date for formal commitment
is made. No formal pledge
class meetings, pledge class
dinners or other formal ac
tivities of freshmen relating
to pledging may be held pri
or to this date, nor may
