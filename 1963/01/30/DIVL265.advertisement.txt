CALPURNIA, HERE I COME
Now, as the college year approaches its mid-point, one fact
emerges clearly: you are all going to flunk everything.
There are two things you can do about it. First, you can
marry money. (I don’t mean you marry the money itself: 1
mean you marry a person who has money. Weddings between
people and currency have not been legal anywhere in the United
States sinee the Smoot-Hawley Act. Marlboro Cigarettes, on
the other hand, are legal everywhere and are, indeed, smoked
with great pleasure and enthusiasm in all fifty states of the
Union. I bring up Marlboro Cigarettes because this column is
sponsored by the makers of Marlboro, and they are inclined to
brood if I omit to mention their product.)
But I digress. 1 was saying you can marry money but, of
course, you will not because you arc a high-minded, clean
living, pure-hearted, freckle-faced American kid. Therefore, to
keep from flunking, you must try the second method; you must
learn how to take lecture notes.
According to a recent survey, 1211.0% of American under
graduates do not know the proper way to take lecture notes. To
illustrate this shocking statistic, let us suppose you are taking
a course in history. Let us further suppose the lecturer is lec
turing on the ruling houses of England. You listen intently. You
write diligently in your notebook, making a topic outline as you
have been taught. Like this:
I. House of Plantagenet.
11. House of Lancaster.
111. House of York.
Then you stop. You put aside your pen. You blink back a
tear, for you cannot go on. Oh, yes, you know very well that the
next ruling house is the House of Tudor. The trouble is you
don't know the' Roman numeral that comes after 111.

(It may, incidentally, be of some historical interest to point
out that Americans are not the only people who don’t know
Roman numerals. The Romans didn’t know them themselves.
I suppose they could tell you how much V or X were or like
that, but when it came to real cubes like LXI or MMC, they
just flang away their styluses and went downtown to have a
bath and take in a circus and maybe stab Caesar a few times.
(You may wonder why Rome stuck with these ridiculous
numerals when the Arabs had such a nice, simple system. Well
sir, the fact is that the Emperor Vespasian tried like crazy to
buy the Arabic numerals from Suleiman the Magnificent, but
Suleiman wouldn’t do business—not even when Vespasian
raised his bid to 100,000 gold piastres, plus he offered to throw
in the Colosseum, the Appian Way, and Charlton Heston.
(So Rome stuck with Roman numerals—to its sorrow, as it
turned out. One day in the Forum, Cicero and Pliny got to
arguing about how much is COL times MVIX. Well sir, pretty
soon everyone in town came around to join the hassle. In all
the excitement, nobody remembered to lock the north gate and
—wham!—before you could say perm fortiter, in rushed the
Goths, the Visigoths, and the Green Bay Packers!)
Well sir, that’s the way the empire crumbles, and I digress.
Let’s get back to lecture notes. Let’s also say a word about
Marlboro Cigarettes. The makers would be so pleased! And is
it not fitting that we should please these honest tobacconists
these fine men, fond of scpiare dancing, water sports, protein,
and tattoos—these tireless perfectionists who spend all of their
days trying to please us—searching everywhere for the best of
all possible tobaccos, aging them with patience, blending them
with tender, loving care? Marlboros are available in soft pack
and flip top box. You will find XX cigarettes in each package.
