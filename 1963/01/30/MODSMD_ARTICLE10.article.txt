## 
### 
More than 50 students from
Stanford have signed on as Stu
dent Ambassadors for the inter
national Peopledo-People Univer
sity program: another 50 ambas
sadorships are open. Franklin
Conway, regional manager of the
program, will describe the sum
mer flight program at 4 p.m. in
Tresidder, Room 275.
The Student Ambassador
flights are designed to give Peo
ple-to-People members a chance
to travel extensively in a Euro
pean state and to speak with
families and students. HR became
affiliated with the program this
fall. More than 1,000 students
from universities throughout the
country will fly on chartered
planes to Europe for ten weeks.
Groups of students will also fly
to the Middle East and the satel
lite countries.
FLIGHT COSTS range from
$275 to $320. Students are given
board and room with families in
the principal cities of the coun
try they visit. Four European
areas are open to the program
this year: the Romance coun
tries; central Europe; Scandina
via; and the British Isles. Individ
ual travel expense should be $2OO
- all ambassadors are given
discount cards similar to the Na
tional Student Association dis
count card.
Travel schedules are made by
each student. Applicants for the
program are asked to read per
tinent books on the country they
choose to visit; minimum lan
guage requirements are stipu
lated for a few of the countries;
several essays on history, gov
ernment, or culture are required.
A two-day orientation will be
held with Dean Rusk and the
State Department in Washington
before the ambassadors leave
from New York on the charter
flight. President Kennedy will
also meet with the students.
Booklets and sign up lists for
interview with Conway are avail
able in the HR loft.
