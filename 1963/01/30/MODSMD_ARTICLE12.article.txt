# North Sees No Relief For Chinese People
## 
### JONNET STEINBAUM 
Recognizing the power of Peking’s forced industrialization in
creating a cycle of frustration and scapegoat aggression within the
Red Chinese regime, Robert North, Professor of Political Science,
predicted no relief lor the Chinese without transformation or dis
ruption of their system. In his speech last night on the background

■of the current Sino-Indian dispute
over the Himalayan border terri
tories, North based the historical
claims of the countries on the old
Chinese imperialistic expansions
and the 38th and 19lh century ex
pansions of the British.
At present, New Delhi claims
that the Sino-Indian boundary is
either defined by specific inter
national agreements such as the
Simla Conference of 1913 or
“there exists a well-defined tra
ditional frontier.”
THE PEKING VIEW, North
said, is that “the boundary has
never been formally delimited by
international agreement, nor has
it been delineated on the ground.
Where a traditional frontier ex
ists, it is subject to dispute be
tween the governments involved.”
North proposed that the view
of the outside observer would de
pend on his attitude toward Ti
bet. If he believes that Tibet is
rightfully an integral part of Chi
na, a view substantiated by many
historical precedents, he will view
India’s claims as merely Nehru’s
continuation of British imperial
istic policies.
If, on the other hand, the ob
server views Chinese claims in
Tibet as reestablished by recent
conquests, and he supports the
right of Tibetans to self-determi
nation, he will see the Peking
claims as “a Marxist-Leninist ex
tension of traditional Chinese im
perialism” and ho will leave solu
tion of the problem to the Indians
and Tibetans.
TRACING THE lelations be
tween Communist China and In
dia, North emphasized the “al
most euphoric” rapport between
the two which existed just after
the Chinese Communists assum
ed power on the Mainland.
North attributed Red Chinese
behavior to “national pride, bit
terness against the West, the ex
pansionist ideology of commu
nism, the frustrations inherent
in plans for remaking China
'overnight,' a persistent determi
nation to reestablish the further
most reaches of the old empire,
the galling resistance movements
of hitherto disorganized non-Chi
nese minorities. Fused together,
these phenomena emerge as a vi
rulent Chinese nationalism, Com
munist organized and disci
plined. which is likely to strike
out with more and more aggres
siveness the more it is blocked by
internal difficulties and by in
evitable constraints from the out
side.”

THE PEKING VIEW, North
said, is that “the boundary has
never been formally delimited by
international agreement, nor has
it been delineated on the ground.
Where a traditional frontier ex
ists, it is subject to dispute be
tween the governments involved.”
North proposed that the view
of the outside observer would de
pend on his attitude toward Ti
bet. If he believes that Tibet is
rightfully an integral part of Chi
na, a view substantiated by many
historical precedents, he will view
India’s claims as merely Nehru’s
continuation of British imperial
istic policies.
If, on the other hand, the ob
server views Chinese claims in
Tibet as reestablished by recent
conquests, and he supports the
right of Tibetans to self-determi
nation, he will see the Peking
claims as “a Marxist-Leninist ex
tension of traditional Chinese im
perialism” and ho will leave solu
tion of the problem to the Indians
and Tibetans.
TRACING THE lelations be
tween Communist China and In
dia, North emphasized the “al
most euphoric” rapport between
the two which existed just after
the Chinese Communists assum
ed power on the Mainland.
North attributed Red Chinese
behavior to “national pride, bit
terness against the West, the ex
pansionist ideology of commu
nism, the frustrations inherent
in plans for remaking China
'overnight,' a persistent determi
nation to reestablish the further
most reaches of the old empire,
the galling resistance movements
of hitherto disorganized non-Chi
nese minorities. Fused together,
these phenomena emerge as a vi
rulent Chinese nationalism, Com
munist organized and disci
plined. which is likely to strike
out with more and more aggres
siveness the more it is blocked by
internal difficulties and by in
evitable constraints from the out
side.”
Recognizing the power of Peking’s forced industrialization in
creating a cycle of frustration and scapegoat aggression within the
Red Chinese regime, Robert North, Professor of Political Science,
predicted no relief lor the Chinese without transformation or dis
ruption of their system. In his speech last night on the background

■of the current Sino-Indian dispute
over the Himalayan border terri
tories, North based the historical
claims of the countries on the old
Chinese imperialistic expansions
and the 38th and 19lh century ex
pansions of the British.
At present, New Delhi claims
that the Sino-Indian boundary is
either defined by specific inter
national agreements such as the
Simla Conference of 1913 or
“there exists a well-defined tra
ditional frontier.”
