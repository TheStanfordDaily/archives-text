# An Exception—of Course

Despite the fact that the University retains an all-stifling in
terpretation ol the Founding Grant where the ASS Li is concerned
(if the Grant is the basis of the Sterling Decree), there has al
ways been a traditional exception to the University’s discourage
ment of organized student expression; this traditional exception
is the newspaper. The Daily is permitted, by Trustee benevolence,
to commit itself to the Republican cause, the Democratic cause,
the civil liberties cause or whatever.
The conclusion is irresistible that if there is one traditional
exception, there could be more—if the University is willing to
answer complaints from fired-np alumni when some student or
ganization takes a stand unpopular to certain individuals. Is it
too much to ask the University to explain why it insists that the
Founding Grant is restrictive of the rights of every student organi
zation but The Daily? The University’s bestowal of the freedom
of the press would be admirable were it not for the insistent and
persistent restrictions on every other student group.
