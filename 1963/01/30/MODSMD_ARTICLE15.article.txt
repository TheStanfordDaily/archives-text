# Scratch Sheet to Appear Despite Official Wariness
## 
### RANDY GALLISTEL 
When we approached some
members of the administration
for help in getting out a Scratch
Sheet evaluating key courses at
Stanford, they told us that stu
dents were in no way qualified
to criticize a teacher’s perform
ance. Now, for all we know, it
may well be that our having
spent the better part of the last
fifteen or sixteen years listening
to teacher’s leach has completely
stripped us of our qualifications
for judging a good performance
from a bad one. So we were
greatly disheartened.
But we finally decided that at
least we could report students’
reactions to courses so that other
students could judge whether
they wanted to have the same re
actions or not. If a student knew
that Professor X regularly put
half his class to sleep, and that
student felt he learned best in his
sleep, well that should help him
to decide the course would be
valuable for him. If he also knew
that students found Professor Y’s
lectures stimulating and filled
with interesting new material
presented in a well organized and
comprehensible manner, and he
felt that this would harm his in
tellectual development, well he

would probably he thankful to us
for having warned him about
Professor Y.
Hence we have decided to offer
the Scratch Sheet as a simple
evaluation of important courses
from the student viewpoint, how
ever limited that may be. The ef
fectiveness of the Scratch Sheet,
therefore, will depend heavily on
the number and quality of the
answers we get on the question
naires which were distributed yes
terday. For practical reasons we
are distributing questionnaires
only to upperclassmen living on
campus. However, upperclass
men living off campus and un
derclasmen who feel strongly
about some course are encour
aged to pick up questionnaires at
the Vice President’s office in the
A.S.S.U. quarters at Tresidder.
We urge students to write
about courses they particularly
liked as well as about the ones
they didn’t like. We want to call
attention to the good courses that
may go unnoticed as well as to
the courses that should be avoid
ed.

The Scratch Sheet will come
out during Prereg week this
quarter with evaluations of
courses to be given this spring
quarter and next fall quarter.

stripped us of our qualifications
for judging a good performance
from a bad one. So we were
greatly disheartened.
But we finally decided that at
least we could report students’
reactions to courses so that other
students could judge whether
they wanted to have the same re
actions or not. If a student knew
that Professor X regularly put
half his class to sleep, and that
student felt he learned best in his
sleep, well that should help him
to decide the course would be
valuable for him. If he also knew
that students found Professor Y’s
lectures stimulating and filled
with interesting new material
presented in a well organized and
comprehensible manner, and he
felt that this would harm his in
tellectual development, well he

would probably he thankful to us
for having warned him about
Professor Y.
Hence we have decided to offer
the Scratch Sheet as a simple
evaluation of important courses
from the student viewpoint, how
ever limited that may be. The ef
fectiveness of the Scratch Sheet,
therefore, will depend heavily on
the number and quality of the
answers we get on the question
naires which were distributed yes
terday. For practical reasons we
are distributing questionnaires
only to upperclassmen living on
campus. However, upperclass
men living off campus and un
derclasmen who feel strongly
about some course are encour
aged to pick up questionnaires at
the Vice President’s office in the
A.S.S.U. quarters at Tresidder.
We urge students to write
about courses they particularly
liked as well as about the ones
they didn’t like. We want to call
attention to the good courses that
may go unnoticed as well as to
the courses that should be avoid
ed.

The Scratch Sheet will come
out during Prereg week this
quarter with evaluations of
courses to be given this spring
quarter and next fall quarter.
When we approached some
members of the administration
for help in getting out a Scratch
Sheet evaluating key courses at
Stanford, they told us that stu
dents were in no way qualified
to criticize a teacher’s perform
ance. Now, for all we know, it
may well be that our having
spent the better part of the last
fifteen or sixteen years listening
to teacher’s leach has completely
stripped us of our qualifications
for judging a good performance
from a bad one. So we were
greatly disheartened.
