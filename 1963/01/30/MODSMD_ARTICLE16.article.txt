# Letters to the Editor

Editor, The Daily:
Recent letters to The Daily im
ply that a person has the power
to determine when his actions are
“official” and, therefore, repre
sent the University: and when
they ai’e “unofficial” and, there
fore, do not. I doubt that few
people outside the various dean’s
offices on campus are aware of,
or concerned with this distinc
tion. Stanford’s Rhodes Scholars,
student body presidents, gradu
ates, and present students all rep
resent Stanford whatever they
do, and wherever they go. In fact,
the chances that their “unoffi
cial” actions will be considered
more representative of the Uni
versity than their “official”
duties seems likely.
But since all of our actions re
flect on our school, would we not
be wise to avoid expressing any
views to anyone about public
issues for fear of bringing disre
spect to Stanford? Can we afford
the risk of injuring our Universi
ty by disagreeing with our ac
quaintances, our friends, and
even our parents? Would we not
be wise, when placed in a position
where we could or should express
ourselves on some public issue,
to simply smile benevolently, and
say, “I’d better not take a stand
on that issue, I’m a Stanford stu
dent.”

Editor, The Daily:
Listening to KZSU this week
end I heard Mr. Rosencranz’s
statement before the legislature
concerning the voicing of student
opinion in general and the KPFA
problem in particular.
His belief that students should
be free to express themselves on
current issues, be they local, na
tional or otherwise, is well based.
Very few members of the univer
sity community could take issue
with it. But what many of us
rankle at is the expression of the
student opinion without any idea
of just what it is.
I object in particular to Mr.
Rosencranz using his elected po
sition as a vehicle for the pom
pous articulation of his personal
views under the cloak of "student

opinion” and the letterhead of
Stanford University.
I think that Mr. Rosencranz
would be well advised to redeter
mine exactly what his duties as
student-body president are. In the
event that these duties include
making statements on contem
porary events, Mr. Rosencranz is
obligated to ascertain what the
consensus of student opinion is
before expressing it. Admittedly
this may be impossible to do, but
that is not our problem here.
Brian T. Dolan
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, members
of the Democratic Socialist Cau
cus of the Stanford Political Un
ion, would like to make the fol
lowing statements:
1. We consider it part of the
duty and right of Individuals and
organizations to speak up on all
issues which have a bearing up
on the community.
2. We consider such a right to
be an absolutely positive right,
not subject to any restraints im
posed by one’s profession, age,
or organizational affiliation.
3. The question of whether an
elected representative of a stu
dent body may take a political
stand is misplaced in the current
dispute between the LASSU and
the administration of the univer
sity, because the issue of re
straints on human rights is not
a political issue.
4. We consider it of particular
importance that in institutions of
learning a positive and unequivo
cal policy should be taken. In this
respect, we deeply regret the pro
cedure taken by the administra
tion of the university in attempt
ing to cloud the issue of free
speech, the very foundation of a
democratic society.
5. We consider our position
similar to those of other organi
zations and persons who have
spoken up on this issue, and wo
urge other persons and student
organizations to take a positive
stand likewise.
