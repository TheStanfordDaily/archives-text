# 'The Matchmaker' Accepts Comic Absurdity of Life
## 
### PROF. NORMAN PHILBRICK Director 
(Editor’s note: “The Matchmaker” opens in Memorial Auditorium
this Friday evening. It is a Stanford Players production.)
The Matchmaker is an absurd play, but rt is not a play of the
Absurd. There was a time, remembered and past, when the absurd
simply meant that the normal was presented on the stage with a
comic deviation of character or plot action. Today one encounters
serious minds flirting with a new designation. The Absurd now

means a recognition that our
codes of ethics, morals and re
ligion are breaking down and
that the break itself is the theme
of today.
In a remarkable paper on Har
old Pinter, Sister Marie Fleurette
has observed, "Actions in plays
of the Absurd, therefore, turn to
feeble gestures and the large in
compatibility is so great and
overpowering that laughter be
comes only a tool. Bit by bit it un
covers the ‘truth’—accidental or
incidental, contrived for the the
atrical moment, but much of it
is built purposefully into the
sounds of the language, the twist
of the thought, the surface of the
play. The very incongruities at
which we laugh are tragic under
neath, and conceal, for the mo
ment, the premise on which they
are founded.
“THIS IS a kind of existential
laughter without an integrity of
its own. It is merely a device for
leading an audience down an
ever-narrowing tunnel to a blank
wall where suddenly there’s noth
ing funny any more.”

lonesco, Beckett, Albee, and
Pinter have been attentive to the
themes of decadence and the in
ability of man in 1963 to commu
nicate with his fellows, to under
stand one another, and with the
hopelessness of despair, the am
biguity of the sexes, the hideous
plight of the intellectual in a
world of conformity and medioc
rity. We are impaled, it seems, on
the thorns of our own egos and
there is no hope for us, intellec
tuals and common folk as welt.

“The Matchmaker” accepts
comic absurdity as a condition
of human affairs. There is a
wicked uncle, softened by love,
a young pair of lovers, and yet
another, a young man who wants
to know about life, a spinster
who has lived romantically and
who senses that illusion can be
as rewarding as reality, an op
portunist who always needs one
vice to sustain him and rejects
two at the same time, a realistic
cabman who sees so much of hu
man nature that he relies on the
devotion of his horse, an artist
who has found success and a lit
tle love-canary who is mad for
him. And beyond all these there
is the Matchmaker, who knows
that life can be hard, earnest and
bears no trifling. Yet, in the end.
she realizes that she must live
among people in order to achieve
a fullness of existence and not
isolate herself behind a false
sense of security.
WILDER imbues his work with
the essentials which make it live
and which he communicates to us
all. This is not "Our Town” or
“The Skin of Our Teeth,” but
what it is results in a wonderful
and crazy world of ordinary ab
surdities within the context of
our present civilization. Silly and
contrived as some of it may be,
it tells us in no uncertain terms
that life offers an exciting experi
ence, and that we can only re
alize how satisfying it is when
we step out of our little patterns
and engage ourselves in a larger
one—a commitment to live with
other human beings. Wilder asks
us to enjoy that contact whether
it be limited or enlarged.
“Live, laugh and love,” declares
the Matchmaker. All else is be
side the point. The Professor in
his study, the businessman in his
conference room, the administra
tor in his panelled office, sur
rounded by his satraps, the ty
coon beside his swimming pool,

the fund raiser trembling beside
his prospect, the artist placating
his patron, the parent cajoling
his fearsome child, forget that
life is an engagement, a contest
and a joyous participation.
Wilder says that we need to ig
nore the complications of becom
ing big wheels in the amazing
simplicity of whirling in our own
orbits. The absurd is always with
us. We do not need to be con
cerned with the “Absurd." It be
trays its own weakness by an
emphasis on denial of the human
condition.

TO SOME “The Matchmaker”
may appear to be too ridiculous,
but it makes a serious point. One
cannot live forever among ner
vous and tired ants, as the Match
maker observes, but one must
find satisfaction in being a mem
ber of the human race.

Thus, with its patent and con
trived absurdities, Thornton Wil
der’s play becomes another clas
sic of its kind.

that life can be hard, earnest and

WILDER imbues his work with
the essentials which make it live
and which he communicates to us
all. This is not "Our Town” or
“The Skin of Our Teeth,” but
what it is results in a wonderful
and crazy world of ordinary ab
surdities within the context of
our present civilization. Silly and
contrived as some of it may be,
it tells us in no uncertain terms
that life offers an exciting experi
ence, and that we can only re
alize how satisfying it is when
we step out of our little patterns
and engage ourselves in a larger
one—a commitment to live with
other human beings. Wilder asks
us to enjoy that contact whether
it be limited or enlarged.
“Live, laugh and love,” declares
the Matchmaker. All else is be
side the point. The Professor in
his study, the businessman in his
conference room, the administra
tor in his panelled office, sur
rounded by his satraps, the ty
coon beside his swimming pool,

the fund raiser trembling beside
his prospect, the artist placating
his patron, the parent cajoling
his fearsome child, forget that
life is an engagement, a contest
and a joyous participation.
Wilder says that we need to ig
nore the complications of becom
ing big wheels in the amazing
simplicity of whirling in our own
orbits. The absurd is always with
us. We do not need to be con
cerned with the “Absurd." It be
trays its own weakness by an
emphasis on denial of the human
condition.

TO SOME “The Matchmaker”
may appear to be too ridiculous,
but it makes a serious point. One
cannot live forever among ner
vous and tired ants, as the Match
maker observes, but one must
find satisfaction in being a mem
ber of the human race.

Thus, with its patent and con
trived absurdities, Thornton Wil
der’s play becomes another clas
sic of its kind.
(Editor’s note: “The Matchmaker” opens in Memorial Auditorium
this Friday evening. It is a Stanford Players production.)
The Matchmaker is an absurd play, but rt is not a play of the
Absurd. There was a time, remembered and past, when the absurd
simply meant that the normal was presented on the stage with a
comic deviation of character or plot action. Today one encounters
serious minds flirting with a new designation. The Absurd now

means a recognition that our
codes of ethics, morals and re
ligion are breaking down and
that the break itself is the theme
of today.
In a remarkable paper on Har
old Pinter, Sister Marie Fleurette
has observed, "Actions in plays
of the Absurd, therefore, turn to
feeble gestures and the large in
compatibility is so great and
overpowering that laughter be
comes only a tool. Bit by bit it un
covers the ‘truth’—accidental or
incidental, contrived for the the
atrical moment, but much of it
is built purposefully into the
sounds of the language, the twist
of the thought, the surface of the
play. The very incongruities at
which we laugh are tragic under
neath, and conceal, for the mo
ment, the premise on which they
are founded.
“THIS IS a kind of existential
laughter without an integrity of
its own. It is merely a device for
leading an audience down an
ever-narrowing tunnel to a blank
wall where suddenly there’s noth
ing funny any more.”

lonesco, Beckett, Albee, and
Pinter have been attentive to the
themes of decadence and the in
ability of man in 1963 to commu
nicate with his fellows, to under
stand one another, and with the
hopelessness of despair, the am
biguity of the sexes, the hideous
plight of the intellectual in a
world of conformity and medioc
rity. We are impaled, it seems, on
the thorns of our own egos and
there is no hope for us, intellec
tuals and common folk as welt.

“The Matchmaker” accepts
comic absurdity as a condition
of human affairs. There is a
wicked uncle, softened by love,
a young pair of lovers, and yet
another, a young man who wants
to know about life, a spinster
who has lived romantically and
who senses that illusion can be
as rewarding as reality, an op
portunist who always needs one
vice to sustain him and rejects
two at the same time, a realistic
cabman who sees so much of hu
man nature that he relies on the
devotion of his horse, an artist
who has found success and a lit
tle love-canary who is mad for
him. And beyond all these there

old Pinter, Sister Marie Fleurette
has observed, "Actions in plays
of the Absurd, therefore, turn to
feeble gestures and the large in
compatibility is so great and
overpowering that laughter be
comes only a tool. Bit by bit it un
covers the ‘truth’—accidental or
incidental, contrived for the the
atrical moment, but much of it
is built purposefully into the
sounds of the language, the twist
of the thought, the surface of the
play. The very incongruities at
which we laugh are tragic under
neath, and conceal, for the mo
ment, the premise on which they
are founded.
“THIS IS a kind of existential
laughter without an integrity of
its own. It is merely a device for
leading an audience down an
ever-narrowing tunnel to a blank
wall where suddenly there’s noth
ing funny any more.”

lonesco, Beckett, Albee, and
Pinter have been attentive to the
themes of decadence and the in
ability of man in 1963 to commu
nicate with his fellows, to under
stand one another, and with the
hopelessness of despair, the am
biguity of the sexes, the hideous
plight of the intellectual in a
world of conformity and medioc
rity. We are impaled, it seems, on
the thorns of our own egos and
there is no hope for us, intellec
tuals and common folk as welt.

“The Matchmaker” accepts
comic absurdity as a condition
of human affairs. There is a
wicked uncle, softened by love,
a young pair of lovers, and yet
another, a young man who wants
to know about life, a spinster
who has lived romantically and
who senses that illusion can be
as rewarding as reality, an op
portunist who always needs one
vice to sustain him and rejects
two at the same time, a realistic
cabman who sees so much of hu
man nature that he relies on the
devotion of his horse, an artist
who has found success and a lit
tle love-canary who is mad for
him. And beyond all these there
is the Matchmaker, who knows
that life can be hard, earnest and
bears no trifling. Yet, in the end.
she realizes that she must live
among people in order to achieve
a fullness of existence and not
isolate herself behind a false
sense of security.
WILDER imbues his work with
the essentials which make it live
and which he communicates to us
all. This is not "Our Town” or
“The Skin of Our Teeth,” but
what it is results in a wonderful
and crazy world of ordinary ab
surdities within the context of
our present civilization. Silly and
contrived as some of it may be,
it tells us in no uncertain terms
that life offers an exciting experi
ence, and that we can only re
alize how satisfying it is when
we step out of our little patterns
and engage ourselves in a larger
one—a commitment to live with
other human beings. Wilder asks
us to enjoy that contact whether
it be limited or enlarged.
“Live, laugh and love,” declares
the Matchmaker. All else is be
side the point. The Professor in
his study, the businessman in his
conference room, the administra
tor in his panelled office, sur
rounded by his satraps, the ty
coon beside his swimming pool,

the fund raiser trembling beside
his prospect, the artist placating
his patron, the parent cajoling
his fearsome child, forget that
life is an engagement, a contest
and a joyous participation.
Wilder says that we need to ig
nore the complications of becom
ing big wheels in the amazing
simplicity of whirling in our own
orbits. The absurd is always with
us. We do not need to be con
cerned with the “Absurd." It be
trays its own weakness by an
emphasis on denial of the human
condition.

TO SOME “The Matchmaker”
may appear to be too ridiculous,
but it makes a serious point. One
cannot live forever among ner
vous and tired ants, as the Match
maker observes, but one must
find satisfaction in being a mem
ber of the human race.

Thus, with its patent and con
trived absurdities, Thornton Wil
der’s play becomes another clas
sic of its kind.
(Editor’s note: “The Matchmaker” opens in Memorial Auditorium
this Friday evening. It is a Stanford Players production.)
The Matchmaker is an absurd play, but rt is not a play of the
Absurd. There was a time, remembered and past, when the absurd
simply meant that the normal was presented on the stage with a
comic deviation of character or plot action. Today one encounters
serious minds flirting with a new designation. The Absurd now

means a recognition that our
codes of ethics, morals and re
ligion are breaking down and
that the break itself is the theme
of today.
