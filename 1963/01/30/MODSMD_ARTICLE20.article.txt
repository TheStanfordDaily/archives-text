The complicated controversy
between students and administra
tion over academic freedom for
tunately has a simple answer.
Students should be less concerned
with bringing their views to the
world’s attention and more con
cerned qbout developing them to
full maturity.. . ; . ■ i

As I interpret my freedom of
speech literally, I was surprised
and proud to see ASSU President
Armin Rosencranz speak out, in
spite of strong pressure from
above, on the KPFA issue.
In the interest of fair play and
giving credit where it is due,
however, I believe the obloquy
under which University President
J. E. Wallace Sterling has fallen
is almost totally unjustified. Sel
dom, in fact, has a man done as
much for an institution as Dr.
Sterling has done for Stanford.
His weighty burden, however,
has been the antiquated Board of
Trustees that he inherited, and
it should be understood that
these “old timers" do have most
of the power at Stanford. Their
regressive policies, culminating
in the deplorable condition and
reputation of Stanford at the end
of the 1940’5, have been a con
stant harassment to Dr. Sterling
as he has tried unceasingly to
rebuild Stanford into the fine in
stitution that it is today. In fact,
he has pulled a veritable coup
d’etat in the interests of free
dom at Stanford by effecting,
laboriously, a change in the
Board itself. Today there is a
sizeable and growing number of
young, liberal men taking over
more and more of the Board’s
duties.
If, then, criticism is necessary,
and I believe it is, let it fall
where it belongs—on the necks
of the reactionary members of
the Board of Trustees. Give the
“progressive wing” the opportu
nity they need to topple the old
fashioned rule-makers and their
dogmas: throw the light of criti
cism on those that shoidd incur
it. Once the source of the trouble
is correctly and effectively iden
tified, the cure cannot be long in
forthcoming.
