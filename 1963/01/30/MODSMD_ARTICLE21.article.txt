# New Coffee Shop, 'Tangent' Opens With Bill Wood
## 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
Amid the in-and-out bustle of
last-minute orders, and the low
moan of Southern Pacific locals
rushing past across the street,
Bill Wood with Keith and K. C.
Clark opened the Top of The
Tangent to an overflow crowd
Friday night.
At the eleven o’clock set, Bill
Wood seemed completely in his
element, and immediately took
command of the stage with the
controlled flow of his sophisticat
ed version of “John Henry.” He
continued with a selection of more
or less folkish standards: “This
Morning, This Evening, So Soon,”
“The Train to Morrow,” and Tom
fuehrer’s tongue-twisting epic of
the chemical elements. Wood
rounded out his segment with an
HUAC parody, and encored with
"Puttin’ On The Style.”
Keith and K. C. Clark began
with one of Keith’s folk-tradition
compositions. “Sing Out,” and
continued with “Lonesome Trav
eler,” written by one of their
friends. K. C,, a banjo student of
Pete Seeger, vindicated his excel
lent education with a brilliant
rlisplay of solo picking; at times
in his intense concentration he
seemed to be struggling with an
incubus inhabiting the instru
ment, whose resistance over
come produced such five-string
fireworks. K. C. proceeded with

“I Was Born About 10,000 Years
Ago,” punctuated with an im
provisation on the theme of Bee
thoven’s Ninth Symphony. “Mac-
Pherson’s Lament” followed,
with a banjo background sugges
tive of bagpipes. K. C.’s solo per
formance concluded with a med
ley of two Southern Appalachian
songs, the second a notable ar
rangement of “The Bird’s Court
in’ Song.”

Keith began his original solos
with his own “Sloopers From
Stavanger” and a Shaker-like
singalong based on the cook-book
motto. "Give your hands to work
and your mind to God.” The mood
shifted with his “Bring My Sa
vior To Me,” and came to a reso
lution with the “Tuberco-Bacillus
Blues.” Keith and K. C. conclud
ed with “It Takes Purpose.”
The Top decided to begin the
Midnight Special a week early in
order to present Connie Bowen,
who has appeared on most of the
stations in the area (notably
KPEN who made her first rec
ord, in limited edition). Miss
Bowen’s smooth but definite pre
sentation embellished several old
English ballads; the highlight of
her performance was a parody
of televisionitis based on Merle
Travis’ “Dark As A Dungeon,”
which she took down in short
hand from one hearing at the
Berkeley Folk Festival.

Bill Wood returned with some
what more authentic folk songs
at the following set. His justly
famous “Le Cheval Dans La
Baignoire,” a bilingual joke
about a dead horse in a bathtub,
convulsed the audience. His
“Henry Martin” shaded into the
little-known “Apples, Peaches
and Cherries”: for a finale he
unobtrusively guided the audi
ence into full participation in
three singalongs: a Calypso, “Run,
Come See Jerusalem,” and a re
peat of “Puttin' On The Style,”
to which Wood has added some
very funny topical verses. The
Clarks repeated their eleven
o’clock show; K. C.’s banjo stood
out with even more clarity on
second hearing.
Next week The Top will pre
sent Tom Kalmar, a folksinger
from Sydney, Australia, and Ran
dy Jarrell, folk songstress from
the Club de la Rue Mouffetard in
Paris.
