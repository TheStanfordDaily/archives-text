Editor, The Daily:
In regard to yesterday’s letter
protesting the increase in the
price of the flicks on Sunday
night, I would like to make the
following comments:
1. Cardinals Board took over
control of the W.U.S. Drive last
Thursday and following the pro
cedure of previous years request
ed LASSU to allow an increase in
the price of the flicks, which was
passed at the LASSU meeting
that night. We regret very much
that despite our request for pub
licity about the increase (so that
the student body could be proper
ly informed) The Daily did not
print any information about it
on Friday.
2. We all agree, I think, that
the flicks are just about the best
bargain on the campus whether
at 20 cents or 40 cents. I cannot
believe that the price increase for
one night as passed by LASSU is
las indicated in yesterday's let
ter) typical of a rampant world
principle of confiscation.
3. The W.U.S. Drive, which has
been extended until this Friday,
is the only drive of Winter Quar
ter. The funds raised at Stanford
are used to aid students in areas
of the world where educational
facilities are inadequate. The par
ticipation of the student body is
encouraged.
