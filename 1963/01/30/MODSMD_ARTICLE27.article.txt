## Ed Cummings Signs NY Giant Contract 
### Glenn Alford 
Something that all Stanford football followers hoped for has
happened. Ed Cummings, one of the best linebackers in college foot
ball last year, has signed to play for the New York Giants although
lie was not selected as a regular NFL draft choice.
Cummings was considered too light to play pro football. The
program listed him as a “mere" 195 pounds, and he wasn’t drafted.
However Cummings has been concentrating on building up his
weight with exercises and food supplements, and gained 15 pounds
to go up to a more respectable 210. Some of the better pro lineback
ers weigh no more, or maybe even less, than this. Larry Grantham,
an all-pro linebacker for the AFL New York Titans, weighs only 195.
PRO SCOUTS VIEWING the Shrine East-West Game were con
vinced that Cummings was pro material after seeing him batter
such runners as George Saimes into submission. As a television
viewer, I saw Number 46 hit the East ball-carriers on nearly every
play.
II was thought for a while (hat Paul Wiggin, an ex-Stanford All-
American tackle who is now an all-pro defensive end, might con
vince Cummings to join him with the Cleveland Browns.
However, the advancing age of some Giant linebackers must
have convinced Cummings to sign with the New Yorkers. Tom
Scott is a 10-year veteran, and Sam Huff isn’t getting any younger.
ANYONE WHO saw Cummings make 26 tackles against Michi
gan State, or remembers seeing him labor against Oregon State, try
ing almost single-handedly to stop Terry Baker, knows that he will
be a good pro.

Something very strange happened last Saturday in Portland at
the Oregon Invitational Indoor Track Meet. C. K. Yang, (he best
decathlon man in the world, became (he best pole vaulter in the
world. Since the pole vault is part of the 10 events comprising the
decathlon, it isn’t surprising that Yang should be good in that event.
HOWEVER, IT IS surprising that Yang now holds the world's
record of 16-3, because he had never vaulted higher than 14-7 in any
meet before last weekend. This means that Yang bested his previous
top mark by one foot eight inches. He not only vaulted 15 feet for
the first time in his competitive career, but he also hit 16 feet for
the first time in his career, and he broke the world’s record to boot.
This surprises you, and it surprises me. but it doesn’t surprise
UCLA Track Coach Ducky Drake, who predicted Yang would be the
next great pole vaulter to come down the pike, and perhaps the
world record-holder for some years to come. Yang had vaulted over
16 feet in practice. There is a big difference between practice and an
Invitational Track Meet, but apparently Yang didn’t notice it.
With his new found prowess in the pole vault, Yang may set
yet another world track record, in the number of decathlon points.
Vang, who has repeatedly scored the once impossible 8,000 points,
quite probably will be the first to score 9,000 and maybe even 10,000.
Nothing is impossible to a man who can do so much so well,

The most crucial basketball game of the season for Stanford
approaches rapidly. This game is the road game with Washington
Friday in the Washington cold-storage plant. Beating the Huskies
on their Seattle home court is almost as unusual as the Oakland
Raiders beating anyone.
THE COURT IS SPACIOUS, almost as spacious as the Pavilion is
cozy and close. The baskets hang down from the ceiling like balloons
on strings, and the feeling of vastness is overpowering. But the
court itself isn’t the only advantage the Huskies have been known
to take of unsuspecting visitors.
Back in the years when Pacific Coast basketball was divided into
the Northern and Southern Divisions, Washington and UCLA met
in a playoff to decide the conference representative in the NCAA
playoffs. UCLA had the privilege of playing two of the three tilts in
the Bruins’ tiny Westwood Gym. The Bruins turned the heat up to
90 degrees, closed the windows, and cruised past the sweltering
Huskies.
Tlie Li hies turned next year. Washington had two home games
out of three. They opened all the windows and turned off the heat.
UCLA had the coldest shooters on record. Both Fahrenheit ami
field goal.
Maybe Stanford rooters shouldn’t have given Charley so much
trouble.
