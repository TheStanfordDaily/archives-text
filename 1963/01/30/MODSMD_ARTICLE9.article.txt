## De Gualle Blocks British Effort To Join the Common Market 
### 
United Press International
BRUSSELS President Charles de Gaulle scuttled Britain’s bid
to join the Common Market yesterday despite a last minute U.S.
warning that a French veto would imperil the NATO alliance, “It is
a black day for Europe,” West German Vice Chancellor Ludwig
Erhard said when the negotiations finally broke down. “This failure
fills me with deep disillusionment.”
The implications were more far-reaching than merely economic,
and in Washington high administration sources said there are “going
to be a very bad few months ahead.” U.S. dismay stemmed from
belief De Gaulle was out to end U.S. and British influence on the
continent. American sources felt that De Gaulle had embarked on a
course which could shatter the anti-Communist NATO alliance and
force a drastic reappraisal in U.S. defense plans through his appar
ent effort to create a European third force led by France and
France only.
U.S. intervention came when John W. Tuthill, U.S. ambassador
to the European communities, met with Erhard and Bonn Foreign
Minister Gerhard Schroeder to present a last-ditch appeal from
Secretary of State Dean Rusk, apparently working under President
Kennedy’s direct orders.
KENNEDY SENDS NEW AID TO EDUCATION BILE TO CON
GRESS—WASHINGTON President Kennedy sent Congress a com
prehensive education program yesterday designed to aid students
from grade school to graduate school and give them more classrooms
and better teachers. But it contained the elements which will rekindle
the bitter public-parochial school dispute that killed the entire ad
ministration education program in the last Congress. The President
sought aid to public grade and high schools only, and asked for no
direct assistance for parochial schools. This prompted Rep. Adam
Clayton Powell, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Education and Labor
Committee, to say that unless the religious dispute is solved the
President’s proposals will get nowhere.
HOFF A AND KENNEDY FEUDING AGAIN WASHINGTON
James R. Hoffa renewed his bitter feud wilh Atty. Gen. Robert F,
Kennedy yesterday, accusing him of abusing the will of Congress in
an effort to victimize Teamsters union officials. The peppery Team
sters president complained that Justice and Labor Department
officials had pressured insurance companies not to underwrite Team
ster officials. So far, he said, 260 bonding companies have refused
to do business with the Teamsters, and the Teamster officials whose
bond expires February 8.

to join the Common Market yesterday despite a last minute U.S.
warning that a French veto would imperil the NATO alliance, “It is
a black day for Europe,” West German Vice Chancellor Ludwig
Erhard said when the negotiations finally broke down. “This failure
fills me with deep disillusionment.”
The implications were more far-reaching than merely economic,
and in Washington high administration sources said there are “going
to be a very bad few months ahead.” U.S. dismay stemmed from
belief De Gaulle was out to end U.S. and British influence on the
continent. American sources felt that De Gaulle had embarked on a
course which could shatter the anti-Communist NATO alliance and
force a drastic reappraisal in U.S. defense plans through his appar
ent effort to create a European third force led by France and
France only.
U.S. intervention came when John W. Tuthill, U.S. ambassador
to the European communities, met with Erhard and Bonn Foreign
Minister Gerhard Schroeder to present a last-ditch appeal from
Secretary of State Dean Rusk, apparently working under President
Kennedy’s direct orders.
KENNEDY SENDS NEW AID TO EDUCATION BILE TO CON
GRESS—WASHINGTON President Kennedy sent Congress a com
prehensive education program yesterday designed to aid students
from grade school to graduate school and give them more classrooms
and better teachers. But it contained the elements which will rekindle
the bitter public-parochial school dispute that killed the entire ad
ministration education program in the last Congress. The President
sought aid to public grade and high schools only, and asked for no
direct assistance for parochial schools. This prompted Rep. Adam
Clayton Powell, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Education and Labor
Committee, to say that unless the religious dispute is solved the
President’s proposals will get nowhere.

officials had pressured insurance companies not to underwrite Team
ster officials. So far, he said, 260 bonding companies have refused
to do business with the Teamsters, and the Teamster officials whose
