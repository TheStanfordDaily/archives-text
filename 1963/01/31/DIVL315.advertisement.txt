has a special distinction. Church (Gr.
EKKLASIA— Called out ) may refer to
any assembly: social, political, or reli
gious (Acts f 9:32, 39, 41).
The church of Christ refers to
believers called out of sin and
"Baptized (immersed) into
Christ Jesus." Mark 16:16;
John 3:5; Romans 6:3-5.
To obey 99 per cent Bible
and 1 per cent opinion is to
be called into a group distin
guished by the 1 per cent opin
ion. The large per cent of truth
that is taught may easily hid
the 1 per cent change and ac
count for the religious division.
Faith, love, and character
are required by Christ and are
beautifully taught by many
groups; however, to become a
child of God, Jesus adds that
baptism (immersion) is essen
tial. John 3.5; Col. 2:12; Acts
