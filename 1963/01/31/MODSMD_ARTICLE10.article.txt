# South West Africa Oppression Is World Concern: Lowenstein
## 
### NORMAN REITZ 
South West Africa, by any definition, is an international
concern, said Allard K. Lowenstein, as lie related his observa
tions as a UN observer in South West Africa last night in Tre
sidder.

He prefaced his personal obse
i

■rvations with these facts 1 ) SWA
"has a population of which ninety
per cent are native blacks 2) the
control of SWA has shifted from
the League of Nations to the
United Nations to Republic of
South Africa and 3) the World
Court is currently considering
whether SWA should be granted
autonomy.
AS A UN OBSERVER Lowen
slein was sent to SWA to check
reports that the natives were
openly oppressed by the whites.
Maltreatment and oppression is
possible, Lowenstein said, be
cause, “In SWA you have a de
gree of isolation from the world.’’
Restrictions on the travel, pub
lic meetings and the educational
opportunities of the natives are
levied by the government at will,
Lowenstein said. Natives are in
dentured, he said, for two-year
periods at low pay.
LOWENSTEIN described an in
cident in which a tribe had been
deprived gradually of their land.
When they were traded barren
wasteland for their former re
serve they were told, “We want
to give you more land. And be
sides,” the government said, “the
reserve had been declared a
‘while area’.”
“You wonder what it’s like to
live where you can treat ninety
per cent of the people as you
want and not be hold to account,”
Lowenstein said. And he answer
ed his own query when he told
of the reaction of a white settler
to an injury inflicted on a native,
“Don’t you know that these peo
ple don’t have feelings like we
do?”
The patience of the natives will
not keep them from violent action
for long, Lowenstein said. Prom
ised privileges have not been
granted and there is no alterna
tive but to resist or lose their hu
manity, he said.
When asked about possible
remedial measures Lowenstein
suggested that 1) the Republic of
South Africa be boycotted 2) the
United States advocate SWA self
rule under UN tutelage and 3)
SWA students in exile be support
ed. But most of all, he said, “It
is past time for those of us who
have everything to share.”
