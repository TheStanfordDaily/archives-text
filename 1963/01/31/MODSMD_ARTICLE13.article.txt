# A 						Disclaimer

### 
Today’s Stanford Daily appears with something new in it,
something that The Daily has never before carried. It is, for lack
of a hotter word, a disclaimer. In the masthead the disclaimer
states that “The Stanford Daily, while owned by and operated
under the auspices of the Associated Students of Stanford Univer
sity, is editorially independent from both the Associated Students
and the University. Editorial opinions do not necessarily express
the views of either the Associated Students or the University.”
The Daily offers this disclaimer as a convenience for the Uni
versity since the University is frequently called upon to answer
complaints from alumni on the editorial opinions taken. Readers
of The Daily now know explicitly that the University is not en
gaging in partisan political activity when The Daily states an
editorial opinion on a matter whose significance is not strictly
confined to the campus alone. This specific declaration of dis
sociation from the University should be adequate guarantee of
University non-involvement in the politically partisan stands
taken by The Daily.
A similar statement, were one attached to all resolutions of
student organizations, would also suffice to indicate explicitly
that one student organization is not the University corporation.
