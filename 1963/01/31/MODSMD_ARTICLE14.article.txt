## 
### 
The news that the Scratch Sheet will reappear at the end of
this Quarter is welcome news, for its two-year absence has de
prived Stanford students of valuable course evaluations.
Under the editorship of David Steinhart and Roan Conrad,
the Scratch Sheet will he printed in magazine format rather than
mimeographed as in previous years.
Although the format will, then, he new and improved, the
basic objective of the Sheet will remain as before: to inform
students as accurately and tactfully as possible of how preceding
students have evaluated their courses.
If past Scratch Sheets are any criteria, the new one should
meet with overwhelming student approval. There has been a
demonstrable need for a candid analysis of the curriculum.
