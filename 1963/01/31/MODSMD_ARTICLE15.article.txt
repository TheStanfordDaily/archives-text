Editor, The Daily:
As usual, a controversial “is
sue” (Rosencranz et al) has
served admirably to enable in
dividuals to become hyper-emo
tional in venting their irritations,
dissatisfactions, and personal
anxieties. This is neither produc
tive nor practical, and is uncom
fortably suggestive of some sort
of intellectualized Walpurgis
nacht. This need not be so.
As usual, a major “issue” (i.e.
that of Rosencranz implying that
he does represent all of ASSU be
cause he is the President) has
become dissected and for the
most part discarded in the scram
ble to satisfy the above mentioned
emotional needs.
As is not unusual, several let
ters to The Daily on this “issue”
are, in my opinion, pertinent, ra
tional and controlled emotionally
and therefore contain construc
tive suggestions and recommend
ations. Hopefully these letters
will serve as an impetus toward
partial “resolution” of the “is
sue.”
As usual, some people cannot
resist the understandable but not
justifiable temptation to mask
an “issue” with irrelevant, in
consistent and, at times, vicious
attacks. This is emotional imma
turity, not mature intellectuality.
Need it be so?

Editor, The Daily:
The Daily and its many “con
cerned” friends have all screamed
for responsibility and freedom for
students. Let us take them seri
ously. First the Daily should be
made to pay its own way. No
more subsidies from “apathetic”
students. Publish and sell it like
any other newspaper; no special
privilege. Second, make member
ship in the Associated Students
of Stanford University voluntary

and independent of administra
tion coercion. Third, abandon the
administration-built Union for
genuine student supported head
quarters.
Of course these things will not
be done because the “concerned”
students do not want responsi
bility, they want a prestigious,
respected platform from which
they can shoot off their mouths.
Let them earn this platform then,
and not borrow from the univer
sity which they are so quick to
criticize.
As for our elected "leader” Mr.
Rosencranz, he is living up to his
campaign statement of last
spring: “It takes a pompous per
son to deal with pompous people.
That is why I should be elected”
the Daily of May 1, 1962. That is
our ASSU President.
He has overstepped this one a
little, though: “I believe in seri
ous student government which
does not take itself too seriously;
that does not, for the sake of
being busy, interfere in every
thing. Onward to Rum, Intellec
tualism, and Autocracy.”
Is anyone really taking Armin
seriously?

Editor, The Daily:
Breakers Club has voted to en
dorse the position taken by Ar
min Rosencranz and the ASSU
in the KPFA controversy. The
investigation by a Senate Com
mittee of this valuable medium
of expression is of fundamental
concern to us.
The right of a campus group
such as Breakers Club to express
itself on political and social ques
tions is one to be cherished, and
we trust that other groups and
the Legislature itself will con
tinue to make public their beliefs.

most part discarded in the scram

emotional needs.
As is not unusual, several let
ters to The Daily on this “issue”
are, in my opinion, pertinent, ra
tional and controlled emotionally
and therefore contain construc
tive suggestions and recommend
ations. Hopefully these letters
will serve as an impetus toward
partial “resolution” of the “is
sue.”
As usual, some people cannot
resist the understandable but not
justifiable temptation to mask
an “issue” with irrelevant, in
consistent and, at times, vicious
attacks. This is emotional imma
turity, not mature intellectuality.
Need it be so?

Editor, The Daily:
The Daily and its many “con
cerned” friends have all screamed
for responsibility and freedom for
students. Let us take them seri
ously. First the Daily should be
made to pay its own way. No
more subsidies from “apathetic”
students. Publish and sell it like
any other newspaper; no special
privilege. Second, make member
ship in the Associated Students
of Stanford University voluntary

and independent of administra
tion coercion. Third, abandon the
administration-built Union for
genuine student supported head
quarters.
Of course these things will not
be done because the “concerned”
students do not want responsi
bility, they want a prestigious,
respected platform from which
they can shoot off their mouths.
Let them earn this platform then,
and not borrow from the univer
sity which they are so quick to
criticize.
As for our elected "leader” Mr.
Rosencranz, he is living up to his
campaign statement of last
spring: “It takes a pompous per
son to deal with pompous people.
That is why I should be elected”
the Daily of May 1, 1962. That is
our ASSU President.
He has overstepped this one a
little, though: “I believe in seri
ous student government which
does not take itself too seriously;
that does not, for the sake of
being busy, interfere in every
thing. Onward to Rum, Intellec
tualism, and Autocracy.”
Is anyone really taking Armin
seriously?

Breakers Club has voted to en
dorse the position taken by Ar

investigation by a Senate Com
mittee of this valuable medium
of expression is of fundamental
concern to us.
The right of a campus group
such as Breakers Club to express
itself on political and social ques
tions is one to be cherished, and
we trust that other groups and
the Legislature itself will con
tinue to make public their beliefs.

As usual, a controversial “is
sue” (Rosencranz et al) has
served admirably to enable in
dividuals to become hyper-emo

dissatisfactions, and personal
anxieties. This is neither produc
tive nor practical, and is uncom
fortably suggestive of some sort
of intellectualized Walpurgis
