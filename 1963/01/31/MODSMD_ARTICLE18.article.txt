## Will Kennedy's Budget Cause Business Expansion? 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
It is not going to bo easy to prove the case for the new budget
which superimposes a planned deficit of nearly 3 billion on top
of an involuntary deficit of some $7 or $8 billion. It is easier to
argue the case—which is novel and highly debatable—when it is
done with the modesty and learning of the economic message than

when it is done with the
assertiveness of the tax message.
For nothing can be so certain as
the tax message says it is, and no
tax bill can be so unqualifiedly
wonderful.
The basic question which will
have to be debated for some
months to come is whether the
budget for fiscal 1964 is likely to
do what it is designed to do. Will
it, that is to say, cause business
to expand, thereby reducing un
employment and using to some
thing nearer full capacity the in
dustrial plant?
THE PRINCIPLE of the 1964
budget is a new one. Why should
there be need of a new budget
principle? Because the country is
confronted with an economic
problem which first made its ap
pearance toward the end of 1957.
The problem arises from the fact
that there is a condition of chron
ic economic sluggishness: the
average rate of unemployment
has moved up to a new level—
from 4 per cent for the years
from 1947-1957 to 6 per cent ever
since.
The American economy has
been sluggish because total de
mand has been sluggish and cap
ital investment consequently in
adequate. This sluggishness is a
heavy burden on the nation. We
are not producing each year
about $30 billion of wealth that we
have the labor and resources to
produce. As a result of this non
production, tax revenues have fal
len and the chronic sluggishness
has produced chronic budget def
icits.
The problem of economic slug
gishness appeared under Eisen
hower and has persisted under
Kennedy. It cannot be blamed on
either party or either President.
There is something wrong for
which we have no generally-ac
cepted remedy. As wo cannot af
ford to non-produce $30 billion
annually while we are bearing
the great burden of military de
fense and trying to take care of
our expanding population, we
must make a bold attempt to
overcome the sluggishness. We
must take measures to produce
the lost $30 billion.
THAT IS what the new budget
is designed to do. Actually, it is a
new experiment for the United
States to have a planned-budge
tary deficit. But it is not a new
experiment in the rest of the
modern world, where all of the
advanced nations, if they used
our system of accounting, would
bo showing planned deficits.
The difficulty in adapting the
new budget principle to the
American situation is that there
are so many serious and respect
able and successful people who
think it is crazy, who think it is
ridiculous and who think it is not
far from being a swindle. They
are outraged at the idea of the
government going further into
debt in order to make the country
richer.
This is not the first time that a
true theory looked absurd. The
earth, for example, seems flat
and is round, and it is not so easy
to remember how to explain why
it is round. The new theory is
that the total demand for goods
and services should be approxi
mately large enough to pay for
approximately all the labor,
plant and capital resources are
capable of producing efficiently.
THOSE OF us who accept this
fundamental theory agree that
the chronic sluggishness since
1957 has been due to insufficient
total demand. We agree, there
fore, that demand should be in
creased, and while this could be

done by massive government
spending, it is easier and quicker
and has less of what the doctors
call “side effects” to do this by
reducing taxes. Experience has
shown that consumers spend 93
per cent of their disposable in
come, which means the total de
mand will rise quickly after a tax
reduction.
There are not many who now
oppose a reduction of taxes. But
there are many who believe that
the principle on which the admin
istration is acting is crazy and
immoral. They are saying that,
while taxes should be reduced,
the budget should be balanced at
the same time by induction of
government expenditures.
Have they, one wonders, looked
at the figures, and if they have,
can they really mean what they
are saying? The deficit in the
new administrative budget (1964)
is estimated at SI 1.9 billion after
tax deduction and tax reform.
This is over 10 per cent of the
total administrative budget which
is estimated at $98.8 billion.
Where do they think they can
find the nearly $l2 billion to cut?
Presumably they will not wish to
cut national defense, which takes
$55 billion. Nor will they cut
space research, which takes $4.2
billion. Nor the veterans, which
takes $5.5 billion. Nor interest on
the debt, which takes $lO billion.
Nor, if they are politically candid,
will they cut very seriously the
$5.7 billion taken by agriculture.
THAT LEAVES $2O billion for
everything else. Practically every
one who talks about the wild
spending in Washington is talk
ing about those $2O billion. Does
anyone think those $2O billion can
be cut in half? The truth is that
those who mean seriously to cut
government expenditures to an
amount equal to the deficit must
cut defense or give up the hope
of balancing the budget and cut
ting taxes.
The fact of the matter is, how
ever. that, if by some kind of ma
jor amputation they did cut ex
penditures by $lO billion, the re
sult would not be a balanced
budget. The withdrawal from the
economy of that much demand
for goods and services would be
a heavy blow at business, and it
would cause such a loss of reve
nue that the budget at the end
would be more unbalanced than
ever. In all likelihood, we would
have a serious recession.
There is no getting away from
this. There is only one way to
balance the budget and that is
first to balance the economy.
