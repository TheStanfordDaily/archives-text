Any thoughtful person who has
attended Stanford in recent years
and who took (and still takes) the
slightest interest in the institu
tion must surely wince at the
perennial spectacle of the Presi
dent’s Office (and allied adminis
trative bureaus) dabbling in stu
dent politics which impinge on
the outside world.
The current ruckus, stirred up
by President Sterling and his as
sociate Dean Winbigler over a
totally innocuous letter sent to
the Senate Internal Security Sub
committee by Student Body Pres
ident Armin Rosencranz, falls in
fo the same depressing pattern
repeated oft of late. . . .
