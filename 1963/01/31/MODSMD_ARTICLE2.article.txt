# SU Student Health Com Plans Blood Bank Drive
## 
### 
The Student Health Committee
has organized a blood bank drive
for Tuesday, Feb. 12 in order to
rebuild the supply of the Stan
ford blood bank which was se
verely depleted by a recent oper
ation on a graduate student.
The blood bank is built up by
student and faculty contributions
and provides blood at a substan
tially reduced rate for all stu
dents, faculty, and staff.
Students under 21 who ate
planning to donate blood are re
quested to pick up a small par
entâ€™s OK card from one of the
posters which will be displayed
around campus and have them
returned by Blood Bank Day.
