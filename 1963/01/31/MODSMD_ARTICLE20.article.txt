Editor, Tin* Daily:
The development of Tresidder
Memorial Union as a center for
campus activity and extracurricu
lar education is perhaps the sin
gle most significant change made
in Stanford in the past decade.
For those of us who have watched
and planned from the ad hoc
committee's beginning, the re
markably complete utilization of
the facilities has been most re
warding.
From its inception, the guiding
principle of the union has been
versatility: the providing of sur
roundings for “informal educa
tion,” for closer student-faculty
association, for cultural programs
easily available to the commu
nity and, certainly not least, for
recreational activities in many
forms.
That many of us have found
the quiet surroundings and in
deed the dining area ideal for
study, can only be considered a
real plus benefit. Hopefully the
Undergraduate Library soon will
be a reality and the study prob
lem will he solved. In the mean
time we must remember the pur
poses for which the building was
built. The possibility of using the
facilities in so many fashions
certainly must overshadow the
need for a few additional spots to
rest our books.

Charles de Gaulle’s attempts to
establish a European confedera
tion dominated by France make
urgent the need to establish an
Atlantic Union—a federation of
the United States, Canada, Great
Britain, most of the nations of
Western Europe, and possibly
Australia and New Zealand. At
lantic Union would give Euro
peans two things which they bad
ly want, but which only Gaullism
has so far offered them. Through
their representatives in the Un
ion Congress and their votes in
elections for the Union executive,
they would have a strong voice
in free world decisions. The Un
ion defense establishment, super
seding national ones, would de
fend them as readily and as well
as it would defend Americans,
with greater resources than (he
American defense system now
has. This arrangement would be
much better than the present one,
in which the large number of
separate national defense sys
tems in the West increases the
likelihood of war and complicates
disarmament negotiations with
the Communist bloc.
Atlantic Union is preferable to
a European confederation be
cause confederation would prob
ably subject Europe to domina
tion by France or by a Paris-
Bonn axis. It is preferable to Eu
ropean federation because a
merely European grouping would
leave the Atlantic Community
dangerously divided and would,
if confined to “Little Europe,”
leave English-speaking and Scan
dinavian nations other than the
United States with a dispropor
tionately small voice in free
world decisions. In addition, a
majority of the citizens of an At
lantic Union would be from na
tions which have shown them
selves able to maintain stable
free government consistently for
a long time, even during severe
crises. A majority of a European
Union’s citizens would be from
nations which have not so proven
themselves. Finally, because of
its broader base, Atlantic* Union
is much more likely than Euro
pean Union to serve as an initial
step toward a Union of all free
nations.

After reading Mr. Tipton’s Rug
by article of Saturday’s game
against the Universities club,
I’m beginning to wonder if we
saw the same game and players.
Not only did he falsely identify
two of the five Stanford backs
but he also wrongly identified
the final scorer. The names of the
backs are Dick Shaw and Henry
Mac Queen, not "Nate Shaw” and
“Dick Mac Queen”: and the wing
who did the scoring was not Mac-
Queen but Shaw. I know this for
fact since I have been Shaw’s
brother for eighteen years now
and a friend of Henry for several
years.
Douglas Shaw
Editor, The Daily:
With regard to Miss Volks’s
letter defending the 20 cent tax
on last Sunday’s flick, I would
like to clarify my position.
1. The amount of the tax is not
relevant.
2. The worthiness of theW.U.S.
is not relevant.
3. Publicizing in advance would
have been relevant since this
would have made the 20 cents
more or less voluntary.
My point was, and is, that a
good cause does not justify the
use of coercion to raise money. I
sincerely hope that Stanford stu
dents will support the W.U.S.,
but voluntarily. As for rampant
principles, I suggest that the idea
that a good end justifies the
means, —any means, is dominant
today (read any Birch Society
paper, communist theory, fascist
theory). Anyone who fels strong
ly about a particular goal uses
the argument that since it is a
good cause, it justifies the use of
some not so good means. I sug
gest that whether the goal is
good or bad is irrelevant.

Atlantic Union is preferable to
a European confederation be
cause confederation would prob

Bonn axis. It is preferable to Eu
ropean federation because a
merely European grouping would
leave the Atlantic Community
dangerously divided and would,
if confined to “Little Europe,”
leave English-speaking and Scan
dinavian nations other than the
United States with a dispropor
tionately small voice in free
world decisions. In addition, a
majority of the citizens of an At
lantic Union would be from na
tions which have shown them
selves able to maintain stable
free government consistently for
a long time, even during severe
crises. A majority of a European
Union’s citizens would be from
nations which have not so proven
themselves. Finally, because of
its broader base, Atlantic* Union
is much more likely than Euro
pean Union to serve as an initial
step toward a Union of all free
nations.

After reading Mr. Tipton’s Rug
by article of Saturday’s game
against the Universities club,
I’m beginning to wonder if we
saw the same game and players.
Not only did he falsely identify
two of the five Stanford backs
but he also wrongly identified
the final scorer. The names of the
backs are Dick Shaw and Henry
Mac Queen, not "Nate Shaw” and
“Dick Mac Queen”: and the wing
who did the scoring was not Mac-
Queen but Shaw. I know this for
fact since I have been Shaw’s
brother for eighteen years now
and a friend of Henry for several
years.

With regard to Miss Volks’s
letter defending the 20 cent tax
on last Sunday’s flick, I would
like to clarify my position.
1. The amount of the tax is not
relevant.
2. The worthiness of theW.U.S.
is not relevant.
3. Publicizing in advance would
have been relevant since this
would have made the 20 cents
more or less voluntary.
My point was, and is, that a
good cause does not justify the
use of coercion to raise money. I
sincerely hope that Stanford stu
dents will support the W.U.S.,
but voluntarily. As for rampant
principles, I suggest that the idea
that a good end justifies the
means, —any means, is dominant
today (read any Birch Society
paper, communist theory, fascist
theory). Anyone who fels strong
ly about a particular goal uses
the argument that since it is a
good cause, it justifies the use of
some not so good means. I sug
gest that whether the goal is
good or bad is irrelevant.

The development of Tresidder
Memorial Union as a center for
campus activity and extracurricu
lar education is perhaps the sin
gle most significant change made
in Stanford in the past decade.
For those of us who have watched
and planned from the ad hoc
committee's beginning, the re
markably complete utilization of
the facilities has been most re
warding.
From its inception, the guiding
principle of the union has been
versatility: the providing of sur
roundings for “informal educa
tion,” for closer student-faculty
association, for cultural programs
easily available to the commu
nity and, certainly not least, for
recreational activities in many
forms.
That many of us have found
the quiet surroundings and in
deed the dining area ideal for
study, can only be considered a
real plus benefit. Hopefully the
Undergraduate Library soon will
be a reality and the study prob
lem will he solved. In the mean
time we must remember the pur
poses for which the building was
built. The possibility of using the
facilities in so many fashions
certainly must overshadow the
need for a few additional spots to
rest our books.

With regard to Miss Volks’s
letter defending the 20 cent tax
on last Sunday’s flick, I would
like to clarify my position.
1. The amount of the tax is not
relevant.
2. The worthiness of theW.U.S.
is not relevant.
3. Publicizing in advance would
have been relevant since this
would have made the 20 cents
more or less voluntary.
My point was, and is, that a
good cause does not justify the
use of coercion to raise money. I
sincerely hope that Stanford stu
dents will support the W.U.S.,
but voluntarily. As for rampant
principles, I suggest that the idea
that a good end justifies the
means, —any means, is dominant
today (read any Birch Society
paper, communist theory, fascist
theory). Anyone who fels strong
ly about a particular goal uses
the argument that since it is a
good cause, it justifies the use of
some not so good means. I sug
gest that whether the goal is
good or bad is irrelevant.

The development of Tresidder
Memorial Union as a center for
campus activity and extracurricu
lar education is perhaps the sin
gle most significant change made
in Stanford in the past decade.
For those of us who have watched
and planned from the ad hoc
committee's beginning, the re
markably complete utilization of
the facilities has been most re
warding.
From its inception, the guiding
principle of the union has been
versatility: the providing of sur
roundings for “informal educa
tion,” for closer student-faculty
association, for cultural programs
easily available to the commu
nity and, certainly not least, for
recreational activities in many
forms.
That many of us have found
the quiet surroundings and in
deed the dining area ideal for
study, can only be considered a
real plus benefit. Hopefully the
Undergraduate Library soon will
be a reality and the study prob
lem will he solved. In the mean
time we must remember the pur
poses for which the building was
built. The possibility of using the
facilities in so many fashions
certainly must overshadow the
need for a few additional spots to
rest our books.

Charles de Gaulle’s attempts to
establish a European confedera
tion dominated by France make
urgent the need to establish an
Atlantic Union—a federation of
the United States, Canada, Great
Britain, most of the nations of
Western Europe, and possibly
Australia and New Zealand. At
lantic Union would give Euro
peans two things which they bad
ly want, but which only Gaullism
has so far offered them. Through
their representatives in the Un
ion Congress and their votes in
elections for the Union executive,
they would have a strong voice
in free world decisions. The Un
ion defense establishment, super
seding national ones, would de
fend them as readily and as well
as it would defend Americans,
with greater resources than (he
American defense system now
has. This arrangement would be
much better than the present one,
in which the large number of
separate national defense sys
tems in the West increases the
likelihood of war and complicates
disarmament negotiations with
the Communist bloc.
Atlantic Union is preferable to
a European confederation be
cause confederation would prob
ably subject Europe to domina
tion by France or by a Paris-
Bonn axis. It is preferable to Eu
ropean federation because a
merely European grouping would
leave the Atlantic Community
dangerously divided and would,
if confined to “Little Europe,”
leave English-speaking and Scan
dinavian nations other than the
United States with a dispropor
tionately small voice in free
world decisions. In addition, a
majority of the citizens of an At
lantic Union would be from na
tions which have shown them
selves able to maintain stable
free government consistently for
a long time, even during severe
crises. A majority of a European
Union’s citizens would be from
nations which have not so proven
themselves. Finally, because of
its broader base, Atlantic* Union
is much more likely than Euro
pean Union to serve as an initial
step toward a Union of all free
nations.

After reading Mr. Tipton’s Rug
by article of Saturday’s game
against the Universities club,
I’m beginning to wonder if we
saw the same game and players.
Not only did he falsely identify
two of the five Stanford backs
but he also wrongly identified
the final scorer. The names of the
backs are Dick Shaw and Henry
Mac Queen, not "Nate Shaw” and
“Dick Mac Queen”: and the wing
who did the scoring was not Mac-
Queen but Shaw. I know this for
