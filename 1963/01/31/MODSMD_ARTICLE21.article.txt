# Teacher Training in Uganda Fills Gap
## 
### HILARY SIMS 
(Editor's note: Hilary Sims
spent last year at Kakerere Uni
versity College in Kampala,
Uganda.)

Last year at the opening of
college, Makerere had fifty empty
places empty because there
were not enough highly qualified
secondary school graduates to
fill the places. It is to help fill
this gap that the Columbia Teach
ers East Africa program was in
itiated. Their aim is to build up
the teacher training facilities in
East Africa and to fill the vacan
cies in secondary schools created
by the departure of expatriate
teachers going home and of Afri
cans taking jobs in the new gov
ernments.
The schools to which TEA
teachers are sent vary consider
ably. One in Western Uganda, set
amid mountains rising to 10,000
feet is so cold at night that there
are fireplaces in every house.
The dormitories by contrast hold
from 10 to 16 boys whose only
light at night is a kerosene lamp.
Mascot of the school is a self
important crested crane which
shoves headmaster and pupil
alike off the path.
ANOTHER SCHOOL I visited,
this one in Western Kenya, was
run by a dynamic English Qua
ker. Within five years he had
built the school from a large one
room mud and thatch structure
to a busy compound of concrete
classrooms, semi-private dorms,
and individual faculty houses. It
is one of the first schools to take
on the added sth and 6th forms
(approximately 12th and 13th
grades formerly taught at Make
rere.
One member of TEA was as
signed to teach English at a
teacher training school for men
who have finished secondary
school. In two years, they would
be teaching it themselves. For
her, teaching English there was
a challenge—the essays of these
grown men read like sth and 6th
grade work here.
The teacher in an East African
school is not restricted to teach
ing alone. In addition to some re
quired supervisory duties, each
instructor is encouraged to pur
sue his special interests—music,
drama, sports—as a leader of a

club. It is all too easy for African
teenagers, straight out of the
bush, to finish secondary school
with a dry knowledge of the re
quired syllabus and nothing
more. The extracurricular clubs,
which become an important part
of these rural boarding schools,
add richness and life to their ed
ucation.
THERE ARE discomforts to
teaching in East Africa the
physical ones of running out of
hot water, or the generator break
ing down, the mental ones of liv
ing in close quarters with people
who may not be compatible. I
thinks these are offset however
by the spar k of light in a child’s
eye as he follows on a sheet of
music the strains of H.M.S. Pina
fore from the phonograph. One
is rarely allowed to forget how
welcome he is. Time and again,
we were asked. “When are you
coming back? We need you.”
More information about teach
ing in Africa can be gotten in
HR loft Thursday afternoons
3:30-4:30.

cans taking jobs in the new gov
ernments.
The schools to which TEA
teachers are sent vary consider
ably. One in Western Uganda, set
amid mountains rising to 10,000
feet is so cold at night that there
are fireplaces in every house.
The dormitories by contrast hold
from 10 to 16 boys whose only
light at night is a kerosene lamp.
Mascot of the school is a self
important crested crane which
shoves headmaster and pupil
alike off the path.
ANOTHER SCHOOL I visited,
this one in Western Kenya, was
run by a dynamic English Qua
ker. Within five years he had
built the school from a large one
room mud and thatch structure
to a busy compound of concrete
classrooms, semi-private dorms,
and individual faculty houses. It
is one of the first schools to take
on the added sth and 6th forms
(approximately 12th and 13th
grades formerly taught at Make
rere.
One member of TEA was as
signed to teach English at a
teacher training school for men
who have finished secondary
school. In two years, they would
be teaching it themselves. For
her, teaching English there was
a challenge—the essays of these
grown men read like sth and 6th
grade work here.
The teacher in an East African
school is not restricted to teach
ing alone. In addition to some re
quired supervisory duties, each
instructor is encouraged to pur
sue his special interests—music,
drama, sports—as a leader of a

club. It is all too easy for African
teenagers, straight out of the
bush, to finish secondary school
with a dry knowledge of the re
quired syllabus and nothing
more. The extracurricular clubs,
which become an important part
of these rural boarding schools,
add richness and life to their ed
ucation.
THERE ARE discomforts to
teaching in East Africa the
physical ones of running out of
hot water, or the generator break
ing down, the mental ones of liv
ing in close quarters with people
who may not be compatible. I
thinks these are offset however
by the spar k of light in a child’s
eye as he follows on a sheet of
music the strains of H.M.S. Pina
fore from the phonograph. One
is rarely allowed to forget how
welcome he is. Time and again,
we were asked. “When are you
coming back? We need you.”

Last year at the opening of
college, Makerere had fifty empty
places empty because there
were not enough highly qualified
secondary school graduates to
fill the places. It is to help fill
this gap that the Columbia Teach

itiated. Their aim is to build up
the teacher training facilities in
East Africa and to fill the vacan
