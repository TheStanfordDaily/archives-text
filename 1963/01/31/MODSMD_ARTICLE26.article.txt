Basketball at the Pavilion is an institution unique to Stanford.
Nowhere else can college students as spectators derive so much
satisfaction from a home team victory. When the Stanford team
pulls away to a substantial lead from a tenacious opponent or when
it wins a close game, the two thousand fans who have been yelling
and clapping and stamping in unison sense somehow that their
activity has been an integral part of the Indians’ victory.
Although fans yell, clap, and stamp at basketball games every
where, the effect seems so overwhelming only in the Pavilion.
Within its cramped confines, the cacaphony of the home crowd’s
enthusiasm reverberates until it approaches deafening proportions,
while the cumulative effect of the coordinated stamping literally
makes the rafters ring. Further, since nearly every seat (besides
being behind a post) is within easy voice range of the participants,
(he offerings of any avid fan, which in most places are clever but
idle ravings at best, in the Pavilion can be as compelling as the
commands of an irate coach.
PAVILION INADEQUATE FOR STANFORD BASKETBALL
Despite its sentimental value as an institution, however, the
Pavilion, as a facility for intercollegiate athletics, has been inade
quate for years. Because of its quaint claustrophobic proportions,
opponents constantly complain of its visitors’ disadvantage; because
of its limited seating, intercollegiate basketball has been a losing
operation at Stanford. The inadequacies, however, have been miti
gated for Stanford fans by the intangible home team advantage
Indian teams derive from it.
However, this season, Stanford students are no longer so tolerant
of the Pavilion. Due to the limited seating, many formerly faithful
rooters will have to pay scalper prices or he deprived of seeing one
of the best teams in Stanford history, for those whose names start
with letters from R through D had to register after 11 a.m. registra
tion day, and thus got their student body cards too late to buy one
of the 1000 student season tickets which were sold out by 11:30. The
smaller supply of student tickets and $1.75 general admission seats
usually sold for individual games throughout the season were gone
within a few additional days.
A LARGER PROBLEM IN ATHLETICS
Actually, the inadequate seating for Stanford basketball games
and the financial loss incurred annually in supporting basketball
are only minor symptoms of a larger problem in Stanford athletics.
The growth of the student body has made the present indoor athletic
facilities, which have not been increased in over 30 years, sadly over
used. Minor sports such as wrestling, boxing, and gymnastics, do not
have enough room to practice in. Intramural basketball is so cur
tailed by space that the competition, which starts the second week
of winter quarter, must run three weeks over into spring quarter.
Finally, except for Saturday afternoons when the gym is over
crowded. there is no opportunity for unorganized indoor athletics
on campus.
The administration, aware of this problem for several years,
made its first concrete move to solve it in 19(10 when $l a 4 million of
the $lOO million from PACE was allotted for the upgrading of indoor
athletic facilities. Since December, 1961, the Planning Office has been
working with the Athletic Department to determine the best applica
tion of the funds from PACE. They agreed that a new pavilion was
a primary necessity. At the end of last year, the Board of Trustees
approved the program for the pavilion prepared by the Planning
Office. Recently the Board appointed an architect firm, John War
necke and Associates, architects for the book store and post office,
to make schematic drawings for the new pavilion.
FEATURES OF THE NEW PAVILION
The architects’ task is to package, in an attractive and practical
design, a complete functional athletic unit, independent of other
buildings. The specific features the Planning Office wants included
in the pavilion are a seating capacity of up to 8000, 3200 of which are
to be handled by collapsible or retractable stands on the floor level;
locker rooms for home and visiting teams including non-lockable
lockers for intramural players; three full-size courts across the main
court for intramurals; a coaching classroom for chalk talks and
p.e. classes: press facilities, including a lounge; and an athletic
lounge and library. The pavilion would be usable for speakers, stu
dent conventions, and possibly even for musical entertainment.
It will be built on the northeast part of the campus, between
Campus Drive and the practice football field, just east of the soccer
field. With the pavilion located there, it will be possible to build
other athletic facilities adjacent to it, if and when the present
athletic facilities are displaced from their current locations by the
future expansion of academic facilities.
NEW USES FOR OLD FACILITIES
An integral part of the plans for building a new pavilion is the
alteration and reallocation of space in the old pavilion and Encina
gym. All the stands in the old pavilion will be torn down, increasing
the usable floor space by three times, and all minor intercollegiate
sports will then be relocated there. These facilities, along with the
basketball court, which will be retained, will also bo used for p.e.,
intramurals, and recreation.
With an eye to the future, there is a possibility that the area adja
cent to the new pavilion will some day contain facilities for handball
and squash courts as well as areas for other indoor sports. Eventu
ally, even the entire athletic department may move to this area.
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AHEAD
According to Robert Wilson, senior planner for the athletic
facilities project, the schematic drawings from Warnecke and As
sociates will be ready in from four to six months. If no delays turn
up. that is, if the Board immediately approves the drawings, suffi
cient funds are available, and if no construction delays occur, the
pavilion could be ready for the 1963-66 season. However, in order
to meet this schedule, the PACE fund raising will have to progress
as anticipated without delay so that the anticipated $lOO million is
collected by 1965. Another factor is the priority order of PACE
projects: since inflation and readjustment have raised the costs of
some projects, beyond the original plan, the extra money will have
to come out of other commitments, possibly the athletic facilities
allotment.
Even if all the PACE money comes through, the $l% million
will probably have to be supplemented by private donations ear
marked for athletic purposes. Whatever the outcome of the funding
problem, the scope of the program ultimately will have to adjust to
the money available, whether by dropping some aspect of the
program or by decreasing the seating capacity. Wilson is confident,
however, that by 1967 at the latest, Stanford will have a new
pavilion.
