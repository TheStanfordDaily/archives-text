# Hull, Suvanto Shoot for U.S.A. Records, Lead Tribe Swimmers
## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
The Stanford swimming team,
led by Marty Hull and Illka Su
vanto, is strong and well-bal
anced. but must face the toughest
and most extensive schedule in
Stanford swimming annals.
Suvanto, a sophomore from
Los Altos, may well become one
of the greatest middle distance
freestylers in the history of the
University. Last year he broke
Murray Rose’s national freshman
220 mark and was only .9 seconds
off Rose’s 440 record. The versa
tile Suvanto also swims the 200-
yard butterfly and the 200- and
400-yard individual medleys.
Even more versatile than Su
vanto is Hull, who is expected to
become the greatest all-around
swimmer in Stanford history.
Hull, the national freshman rec
ord-holder in the butterfly, will
he used in the individual medley
and the breaststroke and free
style events depending on the
competition. He is also one of the
finest water polo players in the
country.
THOUGH SUVANTO and Hull
are the standouts, the success of
coach Jim Gaughran’s squad al
so depends on the development
and performance of its other les
ser known members.
Of these Paul Halt is perhaps
the biggest question mark. Hail
is a senior breaststroker but did
not compete last year. However,
in 1960 he took a gold modal at
the Olympics in Rome. Behind
Hait in the breaststroke will be
sophomore Dave Oildea.
Backing up Hull in the butter
fly events will be junior Booth
Hartley. Hartley may also swim
the butterfly leg on the medley

relay team.
Another water polo star is
rangy Pete Pettigrew, upon
whom all of Stanford’s hope in
the backstroke events is pinned.
In the freestyle races, Stanford
has more depth. Mike Dosher, a
sophomore, swims the 50- and
100-yard freestyle events, as does
senior Tom Morgan. Water polo
stars Bill Lorton and Ron Kovas,
both juniors, are top freestylers.
If Hait returns to his 1960
form and if one of the freestylers
can consistently break 50 seconds
for the 100, the Tribe will have
one of the best medley relay
teams in the country.
THE INDIANS are strong and
deep in most of the swimming
events, but woefully weak in div
ing; the top diver, Dave Barnum,
was lost to Stanford-in-France.
Despite this deficiency, the team
is still a good bet to upset Wash
ington and gain second place in
the AAWU.
USC, the defending AAWU
champions, are a heavy favorite
to repeat their performance of
last year. Two important addi
tions have been made to last
year’s squad, most of which is re
turning. Australian Jon Konrads,
the world record holder in the
freestyle events longer than 100
yards, and Bob Bennet, the world
record holder in the backstroke
will be competing for USC this
year.
Southern Cal will be the Tribe’s
toughest opponent. Foothill Col
lege, last year’s Junior College
champions, also has many experi
enced swimmers as does the San
ta Clara Swim Club, with whom
Stanford has a dual meet next
week.
