# Stanford Faces Three Foes Tomorrow Night
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford (12-3) is favored to win a basketball game this weekend
against Washington (7-9), but any bets you make should be gentle
man’s wagers.
At first, the Indians look like a sure thing, having beaten the
Huskies three limes this season, including two convincing victories
in the Pavilion two weeks ago.
However, in these games Stanford was fortunate to have only
one opponent—Washington. At tip-off time tomorrow night in
Seattle, the Cards will be up against two more obstacles, both of
which have taken their toll of previous Husky opponents and have
contributed to five Indian losses in the last six games there.
Worst of these is Hoc Edmundsen Pavilion- the very mention of
which can give a West Coast basketball coach indigestion for a
week. Washington has regularly knocked off its superior Western
rivals at home, and even mighty Ohio State has met surprising
defeat in the Huskies’ den.
One reason is the cathedral-like proportions of the gym. It’s 85
feet longer than a football field, and when 12,000 frantic fans crowd
into it, the ceiling girders disappear into a smoky haze. This vast ness
can overwhelm a team, and the baskets, suspended 60 feet from any
bleachers, hinder the shooters in gauging the depth of their shots.
FLOOR A NICE FEATURE
Another nice feature is the floor, with a surface resembling the
Pacific Ocean in a tropical monsoon. High school players in the state
tournament held there have had the ball bounce eight directions on
as many dribbles down the court. The slow settling of the gym into
the old garbage dump on which it rests has buckled the ancient floor
boards, adding to the amusement of Seattleites during a game.
Then there is always the crowd to contend with. Referee AI
Lightner wasn’t far from the truth when he described, in a recent
magazine article, the ugly moods Husky fans can assume.
With no other major teams near their corner of the country,
local sports fans develop a congenital Husky-ism, which is nurtured
by doting sportswrifers who seem to feel that their heroes can
do no wrong.
This in itself is forgivable, but sometimes visiting players and
referees are subjected to a steady barrage of epithets and occasion
ally, during a tight game, a variety of missiles from the angry
spectators. Earlier this season, UCLA center Fred Slaughter was
rattled by the taunts of the crowd and the Husky players to the
point of ineffectiveness, and coach John Wooden had to send in
reserve Kim Stf.art, against whom Washington center Dale Easley
scored easily.
Lastly, the Huskies just aren’t the same team when at home.
Their usual habits of throwing the ball away and missing shots
while on the road are somehow forgotten. Add to this the fact that
they play a much more bruising and aggressive game before the
home folks, and opposing teams are usually glad to hear the final
buzzer ending the game.

Whether they win or lose tomorrow night, the Indians will have
played in one of the Coast’s most rugged gyms, and they should
find poor Washington State (3-121 relatively easy pickings Saturday
night.
