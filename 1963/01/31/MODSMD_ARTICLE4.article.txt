### VIRGINIA JOHNSTON 
After defending the Socialist
economic system on the basis of
theoretical and historical proof,
Paul Baran. professor of econom
ics, explained the positive mean
ing of freedom in a Socialist soci
ety as compared to the negative
concept of freedom in our society.
In his speech last night on “A
Socialist Discusses Freedom,”
Baran said that freedom should
be applicable to more than just
a small, privileged group which
constitutes a minority of people
in the world; it should bo equally
relevant to all men.
The gerierally prevailing con
cept of freedom in our society,
said Baran. is a condition of man
in which he is not subject to of
ficial, administrative, or govern
ment restrictions. This absence of
restrictions is what he called a
negative concept of freedom.
IN THE SOCIALIST definition
of freedom the nonrestrictive as
pect composes only one part of
the total idea. Freedom is posi
tive in the sense that "it implies
a condition in which men can
make full use of their capabili
ties as human beings,” Baran
said.
Bat an added that "the condition
of freedom is only feasible when
the stage of persistent economic
scarcity is abolished.” But, with
advances in scientific technology,
wo are close to achieving this
abolition of scarcity. Scarcity is
no longer an economic obstacle,
but it is a social obstacle, said
Baran.
Since our society is run by in
terests and pressures, it is not
a rational organization, and it
therefore cannot bo free. Free
dom implies human control,
through reason, not only over
nature, but over society, Baran
said.
REALIZING Till-; necessity to
remove the economic obstacle in
underdeveloped countries and to
develop a now social conscience
in Western nations, Baran inti
mated that our government
should not push spontaneous so
cial revolutions to more violence;
“we should rather try to keep
them less violent by recognizing
that the revolutions are results
of natural historical processes.”

said Baran. is a condition of man
in which he is not subject to of
ficial, administrative, or govern
ment restrictions. This absence of
restrictions is what he called a
negative concept of freedom.
IN THE SOCIALIST definition
of freedom the nonrestrictive as
pect composes only one part of
the total idea. Freedom is posi
tive in the sense that "it implies
a condition in which men can
make full use of their capabili
ties as human beings,” Baran
said.
Bat an added that "the condition
of freedom is only feasible when
the stage of persistent economic
scarcity is abolished.” But, with
advances in scientific technology,
wo are close to achieving this
abolition of scarcity. Scarcity is
no longer an economic obstacle,
but it is a social obstacle, said
Baran.
Since our society is run by in
terests and pressures, it is not
a rational organization, and it
therefore cannot bo free. Free
dom implies human control,
through reason, not only over
nature, but over society, Baran
said.
REALIZING Till-; necessity to
remove the economic obstacle in
underdeveloped countries and to
develop a now social conscience
in Western nations, Baran inti
mated that our government
should not push spontaneous so
cial revolutions to more violence;
“we should rather try to keep
them less violent by recognizing
that the revolutions are results
of natural historical processes.”
