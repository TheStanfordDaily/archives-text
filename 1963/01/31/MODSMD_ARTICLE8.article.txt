# Sterling to Address Old LASSU Today
## 
### 
President Sterling will address
the old Legislature at a special
session called by ASSU President
Armin Rosencranz at 4 p.m. to
day in Tresidder.
Sterling ordered postponement
of the convening of the new ex
panded legislature pending full
approval by the Board of Trus
tees. Approval is expected, but
not certain, within the month.
Old legislature will meet in a
regular session at 7:30 p.m. in
Physics 101. All people elected
to the new legislature are invited
to come as observers. The pres
ent status of the expanded legis
lature will be discussed.
Jim Woolsey and Don Boileau
will debate the right of student
organizations to voice their opin
ions on partisan political affairs
on Friday at 4:15 in Tresidder.
The discussion stems from the
University’s disapproval of Ar

min Rosencranz's letter to Sena
tor Dodd, but will not be limited
to that.
Mike Hall, captain of the Stan
ford debate team last year, will
moderate the debate.
Woolsey was chairman of the
committee that drafted the new
constitution. He is Rosencranz’s
executive assistant in charge of
faculty relations, and he has de
bated for the past three years.
Boileau has also debated, and
he is treasurer of the ASSU
Speech Association,

ICC in a special meeting
last night passed the follow
ing resolution unanimously:
“We endorse the right of
Stanford sfudent organiza
tions to speak freely on pub
liee issues, provided they are
delegated the right to speak
on these issues by (heir con
stituencies.”
