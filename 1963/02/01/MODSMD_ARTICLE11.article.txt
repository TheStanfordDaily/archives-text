# ROBERT FROST EULOGY
## Not People Die But Worlds Die in Them' 
### HOWARD L. WEINBERG 
Poet Robert Frost died at ago
88, Yesterday and today the met
ropolitan dalles around the world
have pulled from their files his
obituary, a page already set in
typo.

The printed page will repeat
the facts of biography and the
lines of verse but it cannot re
create the poet’s voice which en
livened his poetry. The morning’s
radio tribute once again enabled
me to hear him. Faltering, then
confident and finally apologetic,
he recited from memory, “The
(lift Outright” when his eyesight
failed in the bright sunshine at
President Kennedy’s Inaugural.

1\ PERSON, Robert Frost was
more than poet reading his
poems. He was teacher and sage.
He was a great human spirit. His
viewpoint was always fresh. His
ideas sparkled as did his couplets.
He thought before he spoke and
afterwards, too. In later years he
freely commented on the times,
chiding politicians with sharp
good humor. He turned life up
side down and shook it as if to
say, “Now doesn’t that look odd.
I like that; maybe I’ll write a
poem about it.”

Robert Frost was a maker of
poems. He immensely enjoyed
the sounds of words. In recent
years perhaps he had too much
fun with words to please serious
critics. But the clever poems with
cute end-rhymes gave his public
greater appreciation of his ex
treme delight in the rhymed
couplet. His audiences under
stood that the octogenerian was
enjoying himself and liked him
the more for it. At Dartmouth we
nearly always gave him a stand
ing ovation. We meant it. He was
loved by the College he had run
away from in 1892.

During my freshman year when
Frost came to speak in the fall
term of 1958, the seniors said,
“This may be the last time you’ll
be able to see him, be sure to go.”
But many of them didn’t go, for
they said they had seen and
heard him before. I went that
time and the following spring and
twice each year after that. I was
privileged to see him on other oc
casions, too. Each time he had

something new to say. On Octo
ber after a brief illness he ap
peared before his Dartmouth au
dience very weak, his voice un
steady and his logs uncertain of
their ability to support him. We
sat scared, fearful of losing him.
But by May he had regained his
strength.
I remember him last May walk
ing down Main Street in Hanover,
New Hampshire, with Dartmouth
President John Sloan Dickey. He
wore ankle length black shoes
and a blue suit that hung heavy
as he walked, his white hair look
ing even more out of place in the
spring and his complexion a
strange artistic combination of
reds and pinks and mottled flesh
tones.

HE WAS at Dartmouth for the
opening of Baker Library’s Rob
ert Frost room. Reproductions of
Frost’s first poem published in
The Independent were distributed
to guests at a reception at which
the poet presented the manu
script of his latest book of poetry
to the College librarian.
Dartmouth probably will not
gel Robert Frost’s complete pa
pers. Frost taught at Amherst
before he returned to Dartmouth.
He spent more years on the fac
ulty at the Massachusetts college
though he was at Dartmouth both
as professor of English and as
poet-in-residence for varying
lengths of time, the longest being
from 1941 to 1949. To dispute who
loved him more or which school
he liked better is hardly worth
while. People everywhere would
like to claim Robert Frost as
their own. Ironically, the New
England poet was born in San
Francisco but went East at an
early age.
Recently he traveled to Mos
cow where he boldly read his
poem “Mending Wall” with a
new meaning now attached to the
line, "Something there is that
doesn’t love a wall.” And he met
a young Soviet poet. Yevtushenko,
who’ll probably write a poem
about their meeting but until
then a line from “People” by this
poet of another culture and sixty
years younger than Frost ex
presses my feeling today, “Not
people die but worlds die in
them.”

term of 1958, the seniors said,
“This may be the last time you’ll
be able to see him, be sure to go.”
But many of them didn’t go, for
they said they had seen and
heard him before. I went that
time and the following spring and
twice each year after that. I was
privileged to see him on other oc
casions, too. Each time he had

something new to say. On Octo
ber after a brief illness he ap
peared before his Dartmouth au
dience very weak, his voice un
steady and his logs uncertain of
their ability to support him. We
sat scared, fearful of losing him.
But by May he had regained his
strength.
I remember him last May walk
ing down Main Street in Hanover,
New Hampshire, with Dartmouth
President John Sloan Dickey. He
wore ankle length black shoes
and a blue suit that hung heavy
as he walked, his white hair look
ing even more out of place in the
spring and his complexion a
strange artistic combination of
reds and pinks and mottled flesh
tones.

HE WAS at Dartmouth for the
opening of Baker Library’s Rob
ert Frost room. Reproductions of
Frost’s first poem published in
The Independent were distributed
to guests at a reception at which
the poet presented the manu
script of his latest book of poetry
to the College librarian.
Dartmouth probably will not
gel Robert Frost’s complete pa
pers. Frost taught at Amherst
before he returned to Dartmouth.
He spent more years on the fac
ulty at the Massachusetts college
though he was at Dartmouth both
as professor of English and as
poet-in-residence for varying
lengths of time, the longest being
from 1941 to 1949. To dispute who
loved him more or which school
he liked better is hardly worth
while. People everywhere would
like to claim Robert Frost as
their own. Ironically, the New
England poet was born in San
Francisco but went East at an
early age.
Recently he traveled to Mos
cow where he boldly read his
poem “Mending Wall” with a
new meaning now attached to the
line, "Something there is that
doesn’t love a wall.” And he met
a young Soviet poet. Yevtushenko,
who’ll probably write a poem
about their meeting but until
then a line from “People” by this
poet of another culture and sixty
years younger than Frost ex
presses my feeling today, “Not
people die but worlds die in
them.”
Poet Robert Frost died at ago
88, Yesterday and today the met
ropolitan dalles around the world
have pulled from their files his
obituary, a page already set in
typo.

The printed page will repeat
the facts of biography and the
lines of verse but it cannot re
create the poet’s voice which en
livened his poetry. The morning’s
radio tribute once again enabled
me to hear him. Faltering, then
confident and finally apologetic,
he recited from memory, “The
(lift Outright” when his eyesight
failed in the bright sunshine at
President Kennedy’s Inaugural.

1\ PERSON, Robert Frost was
more than poet reading his
poems. He was teacher and sage.
He was a great human spirit. His
viewpoint was always fresh. His
ideas sparkled as did his couplets.
He thought before he spoke and
afterwards, too. In later years he
freely commented on the times,
chiding politicians with sharp
good humor. He turned life up
side down and shook it as if to
say, “Now doesn’t that look odd.
I like that; maybe I’ll write a
poem about it.”

Robert Frost was a maker of
poems. He immensely enjoyed
the sounds of words. In recent
years perhaps he had too much
fun with words to please serious
critics. But the clever poems with
cute end-rhymes gave his public
greater appreciation of his ex
treme delight in the rhymed
couplet. His audiences under
stood that the octogenerian was
enjoying himself and liked him
the more for it. At Dartmouth we
nearly always gave him a stand
ing ovation. We meant it. He was
loved by the College he had run
away from in 1892.

their own. Ironically, the New
England poet was born in San
Francisco but went East at an
early age.
Recently he traveled to Mos
cow where he boldly read his
poem “Mending Wall” with a
new meaning now attached to the
line, "Something there is that

Poet Robert Frost died at ago
88, Yesterday and today the met
ropolitan dalles around the world
have pulled from their files his
obituary, a page already set in
typo.

The printed page will repeat
the facts of biography and the
lines of verse but it cannot re
create the poet’s voice which en
livened his poetry. The morning’s
radio tribute once again enabled
me to hear him. Faltering, then
confident and finally apologetic,
he recited from memory, “The
(lift Outright” when his eyesight
failed in the bright sunshine at
President Kennedy’s Inaugural.

1\ PERSON, Robert Frost was
more than poet reading his
poems. He was teacher and sage.
He was a great human spirit. His
viewpoint was always fresh. His
ideas sparkled as did his couplets.
He thought before he spoke and
afterwards, too. In later years he
freely commented on the times,
chiding politicians with sharp
good humor. He turned life up
side down and shook it as if to
say, “Now doesn’t that look odd.
I like that; maybe I’ll write a
poem about it.”

Robert Frost was a maker of
poems. He immensely enjoyed
the sounds of words. In recent
years perhaps he had too much
fun with words to please serious
critics. But the clever poems with
cute end-rhymes gave his public
greater appreciation of his ex
treme delight in the rhymed
couplet. His audiences under
stood that the octogenerian was
enjoying himself and liked him
the more for it. At Dartmouth we
nearly always gave him a stand
ing ovation. We meant it. He was
loved by the College he had run
away from in 1892.

During my freshman year when
Frost came to speak in the fall
term of 1958, the seniors said,
“This may be the last time you’ll
be able to see him, be sure to go.”
But many of them didn’t go, for
they said they had seen and
heard him before. I went that
time and the following spring and
twice each year after that. I was
privileged to see him on other oc
casions, too. Each time he had

something new to say. On Octo
ber after a brief illness he ap
peared before his Dartmouth au
dience very weak, his voice un
steady and his logs uncertain of
their ability to support him. We
sat scared, fearful of losing him.
But by May he had regained his
strength.
I remember him last May walk
ing down Main Street in Hanover,
New Hampshire, with Dartmouth
President John Sloan Dickey. He
wore ankle length black shoes
and a blue suit that hung heavy
as he walked, his white hair look
ing even more out of place in the
spring and his complexion a
strange artistic combination of
reds and pinks and mottled flesh
tones.

HE WAS at Dartmouth for the
opening of Baker Library’s Rob
ert Frost room. Reproductions of
Frost’s first poem published in
The Independent were distributed
to guests at a reception at which
the poet presented the manu
script of his latest book of poetry
to the College librarian.
Dartmouth probably will not
gel Robert Frost’s complete pa
pers. Frost taught at Amherst
before he returned to Dartmouth.
He spent more years on the fac
ulty at the Massachusetts college
though he was at Dartmouth both
as professor of English and as
poet-in-residence for varying
lengths of time, the longest being
from 1941 to 1949. To dispute who
loved him more or which school
he liked better is hardly worth
while. People everywhere would
like to claim Robert Frost as
their own. Ironically, the New
England poet was born in San
Francisco but went East at an
early age.
Recently he traveled to Mos
cow where he boldly read his
poem “Mending Wall” with a
new meaning now attached to the

doesn’t love a wall.” And he met

who’ll probably write a poem
about their meeting but until
then a line from “People” by this
poet of another culture and sixty
years younger than Frost ex
presses my feeling today, “Not
people die but worlds die in
them.”
