## Excluding Britain from EEC, Forces U.S. Policy Reappraisal 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
General De Gaulle has made it quite plain that, in excluding
Britain from the Common Market, he means to cut way down the
political influence of the United States in Europe. We shall delude
ourselves if we think his action is a mere episode which will be
washed away by the stream of history. We shall delude ourselves

also if we regard the general as
a relic of the past, say as an imi
tation Napoleon. For however ir
ritating he may be, General De
Gaulle is not and never has been
a fool, and though his roots are
deep in the past, again and again
it has been shown that he is en
dowed with second-sight about
the future.

HE IS confronting this coun
try with the.need to make a dif

■ ficult and mo-
I mentous reap-
I praisal of our
j post-war foreign
I policy as it has
I been developed
Ib y Roosevelt,
I Truman, Eisen-
I bower and Ken
| nedy. The policy
I has grown out of
| the demonstrat-

Ed fact that in the first World
War, again in the second World
War and again in the cold war,
the European members of the At
lantic Community have not been
able to defend themselves with
out the intervention of the United
States.

This is what brought the
American people out of their his
toric isolation and took them into
Europe, from which the general
would now wish to expel them.
Why does he wish to expel them?
No doubt, in ‘part, because we
have tiresome habits, and it
would be more agreeable if we
were not there. But the substan
tial reason for expelling us 1$
that, in the judgment of the gen
eral, we are at the end of that
post-war situation in which the
United States has been the de
fender and the banker of Western
Europe.

For one thing, the Russian
menace is no longer, he assumes,
a military matter, and even if it
is, the United States cannot be
relied upon to risk thermonuclear
war for the sake of a European
interest. Moreover, not only has
Western Europe recovered, but
the United Slates, with its heavi
ly-mortgaged and vulnerable gold
reserves, is, relatively speaking,
no longer the paramount econom
ic power that it was at the end
of World War 11.

OUR PROBLEM, therefore, is,
I submit, to reappraise our ideas
and our policies and to readjust
the'tn to (he passing of the post
war era. We are not dealing with
a wicked man who can be or
should be slapped down. We are
dealing, I believe, with a prophet
ic man who is acting as if the
future, which is probably coming,
has already arrived. Just as he
would not give Britain a few
years to readjust its agriculture
to the Common Market, so now
he is not giving us the time to
reappraise and revise our poli
cies. What makes him so difficult
is that he presents us not with a
diplomatic argument, but with an
accomplished fact. It is only fair
to add that this has often been
the one effective way to make
people change their minds.

Thus, while it is true that the
post-war role of the United
States in the defense of Europe
is bound to come to an end, there
arc great risks in bringing this
about so abruptly. Americans in
their heart of hearts do not like
being involved in Europe. There
is a serious risk, which should
not be overlooked, that they will
discount ,too quickly the future
which the general foresees. The
Mansfield Committee report is a

signpost pointing toward with
drawal and isolation.
There is a serious risk also that
such an abrupt turn in Europe
will provoke a protectionist re
action in this country. With Eu
ropeans holding a mortgage on
such a very large portion of our
dwindling gold reserves, a reac
tion would be only too easy to
start, and it may be very difficult
to prevent many undesirable pro
tectionist measures. France and
the rest of the Common Market
countries are mistaken if they
think that the United States can
be excluded from European af
fairs and at (he same time will
continue to provide the non-Com
munist world with its reserve
currency. That will seem to a
host of Americans a lot more
trouble than it is worth.

THERE IS also the question of
how Moscow will react to the vi
olent shaking up of the Western
Alliance. I hope Mr. Khrushchev
will react to it as we are reacting
to the violent shaking up of his
alliance with Red China—that is
to say, by doing nothing about it
except to sit back and enjoy it.
It will be tempting to him, of
course, to do some fishing in the
troubled waters of the Atlantic
Community. But it would not be
profitable to do so. For nothing
that is now happening in Europe
changes the fact that the peace
of the world will be made or lost
by the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A.
