The term “Arab Socialism” lias
largely been misunderstood out
side the Middle East; consequent
ly it has attracted different reac
tions from different parts of the
world.
The West has accused us of
leaning towards the East, and be
ing submerged into the Commu
nist sphere of influence; the
Communists, on the other hand,
have made it quite clear that
Arab Socialism is far too mild,
and oriented towards the Capital
ist world. One thing is clear, how
ever: Arab Socialism is distinctly
different from the two main ide
ologies in today’s world, and can
not be classified as being either
Communist or Capitalist in its
aspirations.

In response to the frequent
charges made that the Arabs are
rapidly adapting a Marxist ide
ology, it is impor tant to note that
while Communism considers man
an instrument in the service of
the collectivity, Arab Socialism
does not sacrifice the individual,
having faith in the intrinsic value
of man, while seeking a satisfac
tory medium between the needs
of the individual and those of the
collectivity.

Respect for the individual is
doubly important in an under-de
veloped country trying to achieve
industrialization, with the State
as the owner of (he means of pro
duction. In Communist regimes,
the State has exploited man for
the development and industriali
zation of the country. Arab So
cialism rejects this conception of
the relation between citizen and
Slate, since it implies that the
former is a mere cog in the gi
gantic machinery of production
and development.
Yet if there is a meeting ground
for Arab Socialism and Commu
nism, it is in the removal of the
means of exploitation and pro
duction from the hands of the cit
izen to the State; this, however,
does not replace one type of sub
jugation by another, nor does it
establish the dictatorship of one
class by another.

Unlike Communism, Arab So
cialism rejects the notion of the
class struggle, since it seeks a
“rapprochement” between the
classes without the absolute level
ling of income in bringing togeth
er various resources. With the
free world, Arab Socialism shares
a respect for private property and
agrarian ownership, recognizing
their importance in a developing
economy.

It is important to note that
Arab Socialism stems from, and
is a response to the conditions in
the Middle East. The Communists
have accused us of lacking a clear
program of action, while tire Cap
italists have criticized us for pro
ceeding in a sort of doctrinaire
and philosophical obscurity. Nev
ertheless, no definition is present
ed here because Arab Socialism
is largely pragmatic in character,
adapting to pending circum
stances. To the Arabs it is a
means of leaving their state of
lethargy and meeting the de
mands of a modern world, it is
not doctrine to be universally
proclaimed or internationally ap
plied.

the State has exploited man for
the development and industriali
zation of the country. Arab So
cialism rejects this conception of
the relation between citizen and
Slate, since it implies that the
former is a mere cog in the gi
gantic machinery of production
and development.
Yet if there is a meeting ground
for Arab Socialism and Commu
nism, it is in the removal of the
means of exploitation and pro
duction from the hands of the cit
izen to the State; this, however,
does not replace one type of sub
jugation by another, nor does it
establish the dictatorship of one
class by another.

Unlike Communism, Arab So
cialism rejects the notion of the
class struggle, since it seeks a
“rapprochement” between the
classes without the absolute level
ling of income in bringing togeth
er various resources. With the
free world, Arab Socialism shares
a respect for private property and
agrarian ownership, recognizing
their importance in a developing
economy.

It is important to note that
Arab Socialism stems from, and
is a response to the conditions in
the Middle East. The Communists
have accused us of lacking a clear
program of action, while tire Cap
italists have criticized us for pro
ceeding in a sort of doctrinaire
and philosophical obscurity. Nev
ertheless, no definition is present
ed here because Arab Socialism
is largely pragmatic in character,
adapting to pending circum
stances. To the Arabs it is a
means of leaving their state of
lethargy and meeting the de
mands of a modern world, it is
not doctrine to be universally
proclaimed or internationally ap
plied.

The term “Arab Socialism” lias
largely been misunderstood out
side the Middle East; consequent
ly it has attracted different reac
tions from different parts of the
world.
The West has accused us of
leaning towards the East, and be
ing submerged into the Commu
nist sphere of influence; the
Communists, on the other hand,
have made it quite clear that
Arab Socialism is far too mild,
and oriented towards the Capital
ist world. One thing is clear, how
ever: Arab Socialism is distinctly
different from the two main ide
ologies in today’s world, and can
not be classified as being either
Communist or Capitalist in its
aspirations.

In response to the frequent
charges made that the Arabs are
rapidly adapting a Marxist ide
ology, it is impor tant to note that
while Communism considers man
an instrument in the service of
the collectivity, Arab Socialism
does not sacrifice the individual,
having faith in the intrinsic value
of man, while seeking a satisfac
tory medium between the needs
of the individual and those of the
collectivity.

Respect for the individual is
doubly important in an under-de
veloped country trying to achieve
industrialization, with the State
as the owner of (he means of pro
duction. In Communist regimes,
the State has exploited man for
the development and industriali
zation of the country. Arab So
