## As The Curtain Rises On A Bedroom Farce ... 
### CHUCK McBBIAN TOM GALBRAITH 
Recently the university’s Spe
cial Committee to Research Uni
versity Benefactors (SCRUB) has
uncovered some startling infor
mation which may change the en
tire course of this exciting and
vital field of study. It is our
pleasure to present a dramatized
account of the committee’s revo
lutionary theory on the beginning
of Stanford University.
(The curtain rises on a suitably
Victorian bedroom: Senator and
Mrs. Stanford are discussing a
suitable memorial for their son.
Leland Jr.)
Mr. S. (with uncontrolled eager
ness) How about a new rail
road! I could grab up some
land in the North and run the
Union Pacific out of business.
Farmers everywhere will re
member the name, Leland Stan
ford Jr. . . . Memorial Rail
road.
Mrs. S. You and your dirty old
railroads. Leland was a delicate
boy. We ought to make his me
morial something cultured and
refined, like . . . like a univer
sity. A university with learned
and dignified scholars.
Mr. S. Sounds harmless enough.
As long as it’s not one of those
radical Eastern dens of iniqui
ty, like Harvard or Yale.
Mrs. S. It will certainly never
get like that.
Mr. S. I should hope not. But
just to be sure, let’s set up

some regulations to keep the
young whippersnappers in line.
We must consider their physi
cal, mental, and—far above all
—their moral well-being.
Mrs. S. I should like to think of
each Stanford student as an
imaginary playmate for little
Leland. He was such a nice hoy.
Mr. S. Let’s ban Politics.
Mrs. S. Politics is a nasty busi
ness.
Mr. S. I should know.
Mrs. S. What other horrid
things do college students like
to do?
Mr. S. Let’s ban liquor.
Mrs. S. Little Leland didn’t
drink.
Mr. S. Can you think of any
thing else important about a
university which we haven’t
discussed?
Mrs. S. No, nothing I can think
of . . . Oh, how about a dar
ling little motto.
Mr. S. Something snappy and
eye-catching.
Mrs. S. CHASTITY!
Mr. S. Well, it does have a nice
ring to it, dear, but I was think
ing of using the freedom bit.
You know, something like,
“The Winds of Freedom Blow.”
Mrs. S. Don’t you think that’s a
little radical?
Mr. S. We could say it in Ger
man so nobody would under
stand.
