# Nicaragua Election: a Crime against Democracy'
## 
### PETER EISENBERG 
(Editor’s note: This is the first
of two articles. Elsenberg spent
the quarter break in Nicaragua
and lias written the Nicaraguan
section of the “Hispanic American
Report” since 1961.)

A grotesque parody of democ
racy will take place in Nicaragua
this Sunday. Some 30 per cent of
the 570,000 registered voters in a
population of 1.7 million are ex
pected to elect a new president.
But the voters will have no real
choice because the two ruling
Somoza brothers, President Luis
and Army General Anastasio Jr.,
control the politics to maintain
their, dictatorship of this Central
American republic.
The winner, it is safe to predict,
will be Rene Schick Gutierrez, a
willing puppet of the Somozas
who can bo counted on to follow
faithfully their instructoins.
Schick heads the ticket of the
Nationalist Liberal Parly, the
party in power.
Somoza Opulence
The victory of Schick will moan
the continuation of the Somozas’
dominance of Nicaragua. During
the family’s 30-years of strong
man rule, the Somozas have
treated Nicaragua as their pri
vate hacienda. They are believed
to have amassed a fortune in ex
cess of $lOO million, including
one-third of the land, and large
sectors of industry, commerce,
public utilities, communications,
transport, and urban real estate.

Schick served as Minister of
Education and Minister of For
eign Affairs under Luis. He is
also reportedly deeply indebted
to the brothers because they sent
him to a New Orleans sanatorium
to cure a chronic health problem
several years ago.
I interviewed Schick in his com
fortable suburban Managua (the
capital and major city) homo
during the Xmas holidays. Amild
manered and unimpressive man,
Schick has a reputation for hon
esty and sincerity. He frankly as
serts that he will continue the
policies of the Liberal govern
ment, i.e. the Somozas’ policies.
He will keep General Anastasio
Jr. as Army chief, for his “tech
nical capacity” and “sense of re
sponsibility.”
Schick also intends to retain
Ambassador to the U.S. Guiller-

mo Sevilla Sacasa, the Somozas’
brother-in-law and dean of the
diplomatic corps in Washington.
Sevilla Sacasa has represented
the Somoza and the Nicaraguan
interests since the days of Presi
dent Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
And when Luis Somoza leaves the
presidency, Schick notes, he will
automatically enter the Senate,
the pasture grounds for Nicara
guan ex-presidents.
»
Somozas Everywhere
Schick then will be surrounded
by Somozas in the military, dip
lomatic, and legislative arms of
the government. While some ob
servers view his recent campaign
tours as an attempt to develop
popular support to counter the
Somozas’ backing, should Schick
attempt any independent actions
without the brothers’ blessing, he
will invite a coup d’etat by Gen
eral Anastasio Jr. The General is
a young (38 years old) aggressive
West Point graduate and he has
made no bones about his aspira
tions for the presidency. Should
Schick’s obedience falter, the
General may not wait until 1967
when Schick’s term will expire.
Opposing Schick at the polls is
Diego Manuel Chamorro, son of
a former president (1921-1923) of

the same name; Chamorro is an
honorable lawyer, but an un
known politician. His most mo
mentous achievement to date is
losing Nicaragua’s case in the
World Court, where a boundary
decision in 1960 awarded 8,000
square miles of disputed territory
to Honduras. Many Nicaraguans
believe that the clever Somoza
brothers back Chamorro and his
Nicaraguan Conservative Party’s
campaign, which did not begin
until October. These cynics
charge that the brothers are pay
ing Chamorro to run in order to
maintain the facade of a two
party system. Chamorro admits
Schick’s victory—but as the run
ner-up his party will receive a
minority of the government
posts.
The real opposition party to
the Nationalist Liberals, the par
ty of the Somozas and Schick, is
the Traditional Conservative
Party, from which Chamorro’s
group split. These Traditional

Conservatives refuse to partici
pate in the elections because they
fear, on the basis of bitter experi
ence, that the government will
use fraud to insure Schick’s vic
tory.

The government x-ecently pass
ed an election reform law which
created electoral courts, stacked
3-2 in Schick’s favor, to judge
protests.
Miami journalist A1 Burt in
November cast doubt on govern
ment promises of “free” elections.
He registered illegally in Mana
gua and not once but twice in
different districts. Yet the gov
ernment had the last word when
the Nicaraguan counsel in Miami,
a cousin of the Somozas, falsely
swore that he was a U.S. citizen
and registered to vote. Cynical
Nicaraguans could only conclude
that no one is perfect.

racy will take place in Nicaragua
this Sunday. Some 30 per cent of
the 570,000 registered voters in a
population of 1.7 million are ex
pected to elect a new president.
But the voters will have no real
choice because the two ruling
Somoza brothers, President Luis
and Army General Anastasio Jr.,
control the politics to maintain
their, dictatorship of this Central
American republic.
The winner, it is safe to predict,
will be Rene Schick Gutierrez, a
willing puppet of the Somozas
who can bo counted on to follow
faithfully their instructoins.
Schick heads the ticket of the
Nationalist Liberal Parly, the
party in power.
Somoza Opulence
The victory of Schick will moan
the continuation of the Somozas’
dominance of Nicaragua. During
the family’s 30-years of strong
man rule, the Somozas have
treated Nicaragua as their pri
vate hacienda. They are believed
to have amassed a fortune in ex
cess of $lOO million, including
one-third of the land, and large
sectors of industry, commerce,
public utilities, communications,
transport, and urban real estate.

Schick served as Minister of
Education and Minister of For
eign Affairs under Luis. He is
also reportedly deeply indebted
to the brothers because they sent
him to a New Orleans sanatorium
to cure a chronic health problem
several years ago.
I interviewed Schick in his com
fortable suburban Managua (the
capital and major city) homo
during the Xmas holidays. Amild
manered and unimpressive man,
Schick has a reputation for hon
esty and sincerity. He frankly as
serts that he will continue the
policies of the Liberal govern
ment, i.e. the Somozas’ policies.
He will keep General Anastasio
Jr. as Army chief, for his “tech
nical capacity” and “sense of re
sponsibility.”
Schick also intends to retain
Ambassador to the U.S. Guiller-

mo Sevilla Sacasa, the Somozas’
brother-in-law and dean of the
diplomatic corps in Washington.
Sevilla Sacasa has represented
the Somoza and the Nicaraguan
interests since the days of Presi
dent Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
And when Luis Somoza leaves the
presidency, Schick notes, he will
automatically enter the Senate,
the pasture grounds for Nicara
guan ex-presidents.
»
Somozas Everywhere
Schick then will be surrounded
by Somozas in the military, dip
lomatic, and legislative arms of
the government. While some ob
servers view his recent campaign
tours as an attempt to develop
popular support to counter the
Somozas’ backing, should Schick
attempt any independent actions
without the brothers’ blessing, he
will invite a coup d’etat by Gen
eral Anastasio Jr. The General is
a young (38 years old) aggressive
West Point graduate and he has
made no bones about his aspira
tions for the presidency. Should
Schick’s obedience falter, the
General may not wait until 1967
when Schick’s term will expire.
Opposing Schick at the polls is
Diego Manuel Chamorro, son of
a former president (1921-1923) of

the same name; Chamorro is an
honorable lawyer, but an un
known politician. His most mo
mentous achievement to date is
losing Nicaragua’s case in the
World Court, where a boundary
decision in 1960 awarded 8,000
square miles of disputed territory
to Honduras. Many Nicaraguans
believe that the clever Somoza
brothers back Chamorro and his
Nicaraguan Conservative Party’s
campaign, which did not begin
until October. These cynics
charge that the brothers are pay
ing Chamorro to run in order to
maintain the facade of a two
party system. Chamorro admits
Schick’s victory—but as the run
ner-up his party will receive a
minority of the government
posts.
The real opposition party to
the Nationalist Liberals, the par
ty of the Somozas and Schick, is
the Traditional Conservative
Party, from which Chamorro’s
group split. These Traditional

Conservatives refuse to partici
pate in the elections because they
fear, on the basis of bitter experi
ence, that the government will
use fraud to insure Schick’s vic
tory.

The government x-ecently pass
ed an election reform law which
created electoral courts, stacked
3-2 in Schick’s favor, to judge
protests.
Miami journalist A1 Burt in
November cast doubt on govern
ment promises of “free” elections.
He registered illegally in Mana
gua and not once but twice in
different districts. Yet the gov
ernment had the last word when
the Nicaraguan counsel in Miami,
a cousin of the Somozas, falsely
swore that he was a U.S. citizen
and registered to vote. Cynical
Nicaraguans could only conclude
that no one is perfect.

choice because the two ruling
Somoza brothers, President Luis
and Army General Anastasio Jr.,
control the politics to maintain
their, dictatorship of this Central
American republic.
The winner, it is safe to predict,
will be Rene Schick Gutierrez, a
willing puppet of the Somozas
who can bo counted on to follow
faithfully their instructoins.
Schick heads the ticket of the
Nationalist Liberal Parly, the
party in power.
Somoza Opulence
The victory of Schick will moan
the continuation of the Somozas’
dominance of Nicaragua. During
the family’s 30-years of strong
man rule, the Somozas have
treated Nicaragua as their pri
vate hacienda. They are believed
to have amassed a fortune in ex
cess of $lOO million, including
one-third of the land, and large
sectors of industry, commerce,
public utilities, communications,
transport, and urban real estate.

Schick served as Minister of
Education and Minister of For
eign Affairs under Luis. He is
also reportedly deeply indebted
to the brothers because they sent
him to a New Orleans sanatorium
to cure a chronic health problem
several years ago.
I interviewed Schick in his com
fortable suburban Managua (the
capital and major city) homo
during the Xmas holidays. Amild
manered and unimpressive man,
Schick has a reputation for hon
esty and sincerity. He frankly as
serts that he will continue the
policies of the Liberal govern
ment, i.e. the Somozas’ policies.
He will keep General Anastasio
Jr. as Army chief, for his “tech
nical capacity” and “sense of re
sponsibility.”
Schick also intends to retain
Ambassador to the U.S. Guiller-

mo Sevilla Sacasa, the Somozas’
brother-in-law and dean of the
diplomatic corps in Washington.
Sevilla Sacasa has represented
the Somoza and the Nicaraguan
interests since the days of Presi
dent Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
And when Luis Somoza leaves the
presidency, Schick notes, he will
automatically enter the Senate,
the pasture grounds for Nicara
guan ex-presidents.

Somozas Everywhere
Schick then will be surrounded
by Somozas in the military, dip
lomatic, and legislative arms of
the government. While some ob
servers view his recent campaign
tours as an attempt to develop
popular support to counter the
Somozas’ backing, should Schick
attempt any independent actions
without the brothers’ blessing, he
will invite a coup d’etat by Gen
eral Anastasio Jr. The General is
a young (38 years old) aggressive
West Point graduate and he has
made no bones about his aspira
tions for the presidency. Should
Schick’s obedience falter, the
General may not wait until 1967
when Schick’s term will expire.
Opposing Schick at the polls is
Diego Manuel Chamorro, son of
a former president (1921-1923) of

the same name; Chamorro is an
honorable lawyer, but an un
known politician. His most mo
mentous achievement to date is
losing Nicaragua’s case in the
World Court, where a boundary
decision in 1960 awarded 8,000
square miles of disputed territory
to Honduras. Many Nicaraguans
believe that the clever Somoza
brothers back Chamorro and his
Nicaraguan Conservative Party’s
campaign, which did not begin
until October. These cynics
charge that the brothers are pay
ing Chamorro to run in order to
maintain the facade of a two
party system. Chamorro admits
Schick’s victory—but as the run
ner-up his party will receive a
minority of the government
posts.
The real opposition party to
the Nationalist Liberals, the par
ty of the Somozas and Schick, is
the Traditional Conservative
Party, from which Chamorro’s
group split. These Traditional

Conservatives refuse to partici
pate in the elections because they
fear, on the basis of bitter experi
ence, that the government will
use fraud to insure Schick’s vic
tory.

The government x-ecently pass
ed an election reform law which
created electoral courts, stacked
3-2 in Schick’s favor, to judge
protests.
Miami journalist A1 Burt in
November cast doubt on govern
ment promises of “free” elections.
He registered illegally in Mana
gua and not once but twice in
different districts. Yet the gov
ernment had the last word when
the Nicaraguan counsel in Miami,
a cousin of the Somozas, falsely
swore that he was a U.S. citizen
and registered to vote. Cynical
Nicaraguans could only conclude
that no one is perfect.
