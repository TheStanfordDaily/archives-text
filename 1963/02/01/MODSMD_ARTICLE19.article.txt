Editor, Tin* Daily:
I regret every new evidence
that would tend to -characterize
us as an unprincipled people. We
seem more and more undisturbed
by hypocrisy and situations
where principle and actions are in
contradiction.
To find our formerly apathetic
and socially irresponsible Stan
ford students taking a courage
ous position on crucial questions
is thrilling. What is our ivory
tower coming to?
E. H. Wilson
M.A. 1950
