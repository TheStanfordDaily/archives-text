# Cards Seek Sweep in Washington
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
The Stanford Indians attempt
to enhance their position atop the
Big Six standings tonight when

they take on Washington’s Hus
kies. Saturday night, in a league
encounter, the Tribe meets Wash
ington State, Both games will be
played in Washington.
After a disastrous and puz
zling failure in the Los Angeles
Basketball Classic, Stanford has
fought back to become the
seventh ranked team in the na
tion. The Indians, having beaten
California once and Washington
twice, have a perfect 3-0 mark for
league play. Their overall season
record is 12-3.

WASHINGTON should prove a
rugged test for Stanford, even
though the Indians have beaten
them three times previously this
year. This is the first meeting of
the year for the two teams in
Washington's famed Edmundson
Pavilion, a gym so massive that
Del Webb was rumored to have
tried to buy it for another of his
tract housing projects. Just as
Stanford enjoys a tremendous
home court advantage in its
snug pavilion, the Huskies have
tremendous success in Seattle,
where even Ohio State has gotten
lost in the vast confines.
Not all of this home court ad
vantage is due to the dimensions
of the gym, however. Many teams
have been pounded into submis
sion by the force of pure noise
alone. John Grayson, who doubles
as Washington’s coach, does a re-

markable job of cheerleading. The
infamous sideline antics of this
Tommy Bolt of basketball have
provoked the vociferous Husky
fans to unequalled demonstra
tions of lung power.
STANFORD MUST ALSO con
tend with the men who actually
play on the team. The squad is
led by quick and powerful center
Dale Easley, who is averaging
15.7 points a game, and 6-6 for
ward Ed Corell, a fierce rebound
er who averages 14.5 markers per
game. These two front liners are
largely responsible for Washing
ton’s surprising success. In a re
building year which saw the Hus
kies lose four starters from last
year’s team, Washington has still
managed seven victories against
nine defeats.
—Then a Washingtoncan
always rely on Charlie Hart, the
lovable hatchet man who gets
more fouls than a seasoned duck
hunter and carries the ball more
than Jim Taylor. It was good old
Charlie, as you’ll remember, who
earned the wrath of Stanford
rooters by trying to run over Tom
Dose in the Pavilion. This looked
something like Willie Shoemaker
taking on Sonny Liston, or one
of the horses Willie rides, hut
Stanford fans failed to see the
humor in Charlie's vain effort.
SATURDAY Stanford plays
Washington State at Pullman.
WSU is going nowhere this year,
haying won only three of 15
games. They have lost to Oregon
three times, I.daho four times,
and Oregon State twice, their only
wins coming over Long Beach
State, Gonzaga, and Montana
State.
The Cougars are led by junior

guard Byron Vadset, who is aver
aging 14.8 points per game. For
ward A1 Thompson leads the club
in rebounding, while sophomore
center Ted Werner, who will
have more than he can handle in
trying to stop Dose, is second on
the team in scoring and rebound
ing.
Stanford will look to All-Ameri
can hopeful Dose to do most of
their scoring and rebounding,
while dead-eye Don Clcmetson
keeps the defense honest with his
accurate jump shooting. Clayton
Raaka has seen a lot of action in
recent games and has helped Dose
considerably on the boards.

Kadio station KCBS will
broadcast both Stanford
games, starting at 8 p.m. each
night.


HERE ARE the two men that Stanford center Tom Dose will be facing this weekend. At top is Washington s Dale Easley, against
whom Dose scored 23 points, but
was limited to two baskets the
next night. Below is Washington
State's sophomore Ted Werner.
He led the Cougar frosh to a 154 mark last year.
