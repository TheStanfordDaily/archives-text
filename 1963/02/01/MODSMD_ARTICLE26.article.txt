## PAPOOSES RESUME PLAY Kosanke to Start Against SJS Freshmen Squad 
### DAVID NYBERG 
The freshman basketball squad
faces one of the finest teams in
the area tonight when they travel
to San Jose State. The Spartan
yearlings have shot themselves a
9-2 season record, losing only to
Cal and USF, the only quintets
that have beaten Stanford.
This game will be only the
eighth of the season for the hust
ling frosh who have won five of
their first seven contests. Theonly
change in (he regular line-up—
which features Forward Bob Be
dell, good for 15 or 16 points a
game, and Skip Hutchison, a
jump • shooting guard with an
average of 11.5 per game— will be
Ray Kosanke who has played but
two games.
SAN JOSE STATE is a tall
team (6-1 avg.i, their two great
est scoring threats being 6-7 cen
ter Jeff Goodere, and forward S.
T. Saffold. Other starters are

Craig Fergus and Pete Newell
Jr. at guards, and Frank Terrants
at the other forward. Newell, son
of Cal’s athletic director and
former basketball coach, is the
leading playmaker of the well
coached squad.

Stanford’s freshmen should all
be confident after winning their
last three ball games and having
last weekend to relax. They will
have to use this confidence and a
great deal of skill, however, if
they wish to overcome their more
experienced opponents for their
fourth win in a row.
Stanford fans will have a
chance to see these two teams
again when San Jose visits the
Farm next Saturday.
