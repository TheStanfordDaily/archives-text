# Field May Hurt Stanford Ruggers Against Revenge-Minded Universities Club Tomorrow
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
Stap.forri's varsity rugby squad
a S a i/u meets Universities Club of
San--, Francisco tomorrow at 3:00
P-'-m. on the Stanford rugby field,
f'be 45-man junior varsity squad
will take on the San Francisco
Ramblers and the Olympic Club
“A” team in separate games both
starting at 1:30.
Universities will be looking for
revenge after last week’s 11-3 loss
to the Indians. That contest was
hard-fought and very much in
doubt until the final minutes,
when the Cards’ youth and con
ditioning began to show.
The visitors will have a couple
of advantages they didn’t enjoy
last week. First, the weather will
very probably be to their advan
tage. The Universities scrum
showed itself stronger and more
experienced than its Stanford
counterpart, an asset on a rain
soaked field. Universities also is
very strong in the lineout posi
tion, another factor which may
help to offset Stanford’s super
iority in the open field.
Second, as Stanford coach Pete
Kmetovic said, “They may have
a psychological advantage on us.
You beat a team once and you
get cocky. They’ll be out to get
us this week.”
Universities certainly lias the
wherewithal to "get" the Indians,
if they get a few breaks, too. The
visitors will have Bob Chiapone,
one of the strongest lint-out men
currently on the west coast. They
also will have Rick McMillain, an
ex-Stanford player who did quite
well against his old club last
week. John Harrison, an Austral
ian and ex-Cal performer, is the
Universities’ kicker.
Kmetovic attributed Universi
ties’ weaknesses in the backfield
partly to age and conditioning and
partly to lack of depth. “They’re
playing with three fullbacks,” he
said. “That’s got to hurt them
some.” The fullback in rugby does
most of his best work on defense.
He is the last man between the
offense and the goal. It is most
generally he who kicks the ball
out of trouble when the occasion
arises.
Their reliance on ex-fullbacks
to fill out the backfield gave Uni
versities some good kicking last
week, but hurt (hem in the open
field running at which Stanford,
led by Gordon Waddell, excels.
Stanford’s lineout strength wall
be helped this week by the return
of A1 Hildebrand to full duties.
He contained Chiapone in the sec
ond half last Saturday, but was
unable to play the entire game.

He will start with Dick Leeuwen
burg in the second row, but will
probably get some help from
Chuck Buehler before the end of
the game.
Dick Shaw and Steve Mac-
Queen, who both played outstand
ingly last week as reserves, will
be moved up the start in tomor
row’s contest. .

Also joining Waddell in the
backfield will be Bob Price, Clark
Weaver, Hal Steuber, and Braden
Beek. Leeuwenburg and Hilde
brand will be supported in the
scrum by Randy Devening, Randy
Vahan, Troy Barbee (who was
absent from last week’s game),
Steve Pursell, Tim Hansel, Frank
Patitueci, and Boh Burke.


230-POUND AL HILDEBRAND helps beef up the Stanford scrum,
and uses his six feet, five inches to good advantage on lineouts.
The Card rugby team goes after its third straight win tomorrow at
3 p.m. on the rugby field, next to the baseball diamond.

Stap.forri's varsity rugby squad
a S a i/u meets Universities Club of
San--, Francisco tomorrow at 3:00
P-'-m. on the Stanford rugby field,
f'be 45-man junior varsity squad
will take on the San Francisco
Ramblers and the Olympic Club
“A” team in separate games both
starting at 1:30.
Universities will be looking for
revenge after last week’s 11-3 loss
to the Indians. That contest was
hard-fought and very much in
doubt until the final minutes,
when the Cards’ youth and con
ditioning began to show.
The visitors will have a couple
of advantages they didn’t enjoy
last week. First, the weather will
very probably be to their advan
tage. The Universities scrum
showed itself stronger and more
experienced than its Stanford
counterpart, an asset on a rain
soaked field. Universities also is
very strong in the lineout posi
tion, another factor which may
help to offset Stanford’s super
iority in the open field.
Second, as Stanford coach Pete
Kmetovic said, “They may have
a psychological advantage on us.
You beat a team once and you
get cocky. They’ll be out to get
us this week.”
Universities certainly lias the
wherewithal to "get" the Indians,
if they get a few breaks, too. The
visitors will have Bob Chiapone,
one of the strongest lint-out men
currently on the west coast. They
also will have Rick McMillain, an
ex-Stanford player who did quite
well against his old club last
week. John Harrison, an Austral
ian and ex-Cal performer, is the
Universities’ kicker.
Kmetovic attributed Universi
ties’ weaknesses in the backfield
partly to age and conditioning and
partly to lack of depth. “They’re
playing with three fullbacks,” he
said. “That’s got to hurt them
some.” The fullback in rugby does
most of his best work on defense.
He is the last man between the
offense and the goal. It is most
generally he who kicks the ball
out of trouble when the occasion
arises.
Their reliance on ex-fullbacks
to fill out the backfield gave Uni
versities some good kicking last
week, but hurt (hem in the open
field running at which Stanford,
led by Gordon Waddell, excels.
Stanford’s lineout strength wall
be helped this week by the return
of A1 Hildebrand to full duties.
He contained Chiapone in the sec
ond half last Saturday, but was
unable to play the entire game.

He will start with Dick Leeuwen
burg in the second row, but will
probably get some help from
Chuck Buehler before the end of
the game.
Dick Shaw and Steve Mac-
Queen, who both played outstand
ingly last week as reserves, will
be moved up the start in tomor
row’s contest. .

Also joining Waddell in the
backfield will be Bob Price, Clark
Weaver, Hal Steuber, and Braden
Beek. Leeuwenburg and Hilde
brand will be supported in the
scrum by Randy Devening, Randy
Vahan, Troy Barbee (who was
absent from last week’s game),
Steve Pursell, Tim Hansel, Frank
Patitueci, and Boh Burke.
