A recent experiment in the
English department illustrates
the kind of innovation which is
going on in Stanford's academic
realms.
Under the direction of Dr. Al
bert Guerard, a group of highly
qualified freshmen have had the
opportunity to take an advanced
seminar in place of the standard
freshman English requirement.
Featuring a very small class, tu
torial attention, and progressively
more difficult work, the seminar
aims at making intellectual stim
ulation a reality for the new ar
rival at Stanford, rather than an
upper division possibility w’hich
he must be convinced of after his
original let-down.
“For the very bright or very
well-prepared student,’’ said Guer
ard, “freshman English is often a
stop back, offering no challenge
or excitement.’’ There are people
who can already write (relative
ly) correctly and think (fairly)
logically when they come to Stan
ford: those people need some
thing more.
Guerard offered them more in
his fall quarter seminar. The re
sults were encouraging. The con
tent of the course was flexible,
but the principle was constant:
keep raising the level of the work
as high as student capabilities
and responsiveness will allow'.
Around mid-quarter, Guerard
tried giving his freshmen the
same material as he was giving

| his graduate students. Invited to
| sit in on the grad seminar one
} afternoon, the bright-eyed frosh
1 left their venerable hosts blush
| ing. When a classical allusion in
“Kubla Khan” had the grads
! stumped, one of the young visi
| tors obligingly supplied it.
The project was sponsored, or
ganized, and executed by Guer
ard. He taught similar' groups at
Harvard, where nearly two hun
dred students are involved in
special programs in all depart
ments. This year ho himself
chose the students on the basis of
test scores and records, but fu
ture selections would be made
from applicatoins. Ideally, ob
serves Guerard, a special fresh
man seminar should deal with the
most advanced work the profes
sor is doing.
The eye to improvement in tire
English department is not focused
exclusively on the “cream of the
cream.” Guerard said. Plans are
under way to step up freshman
courses for everyone. Among
other things it is hoped that more
experienced professors will soon
be teaching freshman English,
trow 90 per cent grad student -
taught.
Guerard summarized the phi
losophy behind his project and
others like it: “If you can get
people involved in work that
really challenges their capacity
and at the same time is creative,
you get a dynamic instead of a
passive educational situation.”

passive educational situation.”
A recent experiment in the
English department illustrates
the kind of innovation which is
going on in Stanford's academic
realms.
Under the direction of Dr. Al
bert Guerard, a group of highly
qualified freshmen have had the
opportunity to take an advanced
seminar in place of the standard
freshman English requirement.
Featuring a very small class, tu
torial attention, and progressively
more difficult work, the seminar
aims at making intellectual stim
ulation a reality for the new ar
rival at Stanford, rather than an
upper division possibility w’hich
he must be convinced of after his
original let-down.
“For the very bright or very
well-prepared student,’’ said Guer
ard, “freshman English is often a
stop back, offering no challenge
or excitement.’’ There are people
who can already write (relative
ly) correctly and think (fairly)
logically when they come to Stan
ford: those people need some
thing more.
Guerard offered them more in
his fall quarter seminar. The re
sults were encouraging. The con
tent of the course was flexible,
but the principle was constant:
keep raising the level of the work
as high as student capabilities
and responsiveness will allow'.
Around mid-quarter, Guerard
tried giving his freshmen the
same material as he was giving

| his graduate students. Invited to
| sit in on the grad seminar one
} afternoon, the bright-eyed frosh
1 left their venerable hosts blush
| ing. When a classical allusion in
“Kubla Khan” had the grads
! stumped, one of the young visi
| tors obligingly supplied it.
The project was sponsored, or
ganized, and executed by Guer
ard. He taught similar' groups at
Harvard, where nearly two hun
dred students are involved in
special programs in all depart
ments. This year ho himself
chose the students on the basis of
test scores and records, but fu
ture selections would be made
from applicatoins. Ideally, ob
serves Guerard, a special fresh
man seminar should deal with the
most advanced work the profes
sor is doing.
The eye to improvement in tire
English department is not focused
exclusively on the “cream of the
cream.” Guerard said. Plans are
under way to step up freshman
courses for everyone. Among
other things it is hoped that more
experienced professors will soon
be teaching freshman English,
trow 90 per cent grad student -
taught.
Guerard summarized the phi
losophy behind his project and
others like it: “If you can get
people involved in work that
really challenges their capacity
and at the same time is creative,
you get a dynamic instead of a
passive educational situation.”
