# Legislature Reaffirms Stand On Student Rights Resolve
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
Ihe Legislature last night reaffirmed its resolution of last
week on social action and its role in the educational process,”
and further affirmed the right of any group of students, properly
identifying themselves, to speak out on public issues.” Lastly,
they resolved to encourage student action in concert with the

I Administration to provide amu
! tually acceptable means of realiz
j ing this right of expression.” The
vote was 15-4.
The motion was passed after a
, 15-minute discussion, which dealt
I mostly with the wording and im
| plication of the third section of
the resolution. Following the pas
; sage of this motion, another reso
j lution was unanimously passed
to “respect President Sterling’s
I request to postpone the conven
| ing of the new Legislature until
I the Board of Trustees ratifies the
new Constitution.”
ASSU President Armin Rosen
cranz opened the meeting with a
70-minute report on the events
following the Legislature’s reso
lutions of last week on KPFA,
Rosencranz’s letters to Sen. Dodd
of the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee and FCC Chair
man Newton Minow and the right
of students to speak out on public
issues.

Rosencranz stated that he was
greatly surprised by the reaction
of the Administration to his let
ters to Dodd and Minow. He re
called that neither his previous
letters to the editor of The Mis
sissippian of the University of
Mississipp last October, the Stu
dent Body President of Colorado
University, nor the Legislature's
resolution approving Proposition
13 and opposing Proposition 24 in
the November election, were
found objectionable by the Ad
ministration. He continued, “Un
der the present circumstances, I
regret that I wrote the letters (to
Dodd and Minow). With the pre
vious letters as precedents, I
thought there would be no prob
lem.”
However, Rosencranz did go on
to say that he resisted the idea
that the Legislature should not
speak without prior “censorship”
by the Administration. He said
that the resolutions of last Thurs
day resulted in a net gain in that
the “President and the Board of
Trustees are finally impressed
with, our need to speak out and
now are trying to find away to
accommodate this desire.”
In one instance, Rosencranz
strongly disagreed with Sterling’s
address to a special Legislature
meeting yesterday afternoon in
Tresidder Union. He deplored
Sterling’s suggestion that sus
pension from the University was
considered as a disciplinary mat
ter for some officers as a result
of the last Legislature meeting.
Said Rosencranz, “However mis
guided student opinion may be,
it is deplorable to suggest sus
pension or dissolution of the Leg
islature as a proper reaction to
our action.” Ho did commend
Sterling for his frequent meet
ings in the last week with stu
dent leaders and for the over all
“amiability” of his speech that
afternoon.
Rosencranz stated his belief
that expression of representative
student opinion will inevitably be
approved. He borrowed a quota
tion Sterling had used in his ad
di-ess that afternoon to conclude
his remarks, “There ain’t no hold
that can’t be broken.”

that can’t be broken.”
Ihe Legislature last night reaffirmed its resolution of last
week on social action and its role in the educational process,”
and further affirmed the right of any group of students, properly
identifying themselves, to speak out on public issues.” Lastly,
they resolved to encourage student action in concert with the

I Administration to provide amu
! tually acceptable means of realiz
j ing this right of expression.” The
vote was 15-4.
The motion was passed after a
, 15-minute discussion, which dealt
I mostly with the wording and im
| plication of the third section of
the resolution. Following the pas
; sage of this motion, another reso
j lution was unanimously passed
to “respect President Sterling’s
I request to postpone the conven
| ing of the new Legislature until
I the Board of Trustees ratifies the
new Constitution.”
ASSU President Armin Rosen
cranz opened the meeting with a
70-minute report on the events
following the Legislature’s reso
lutions of last week on KPFA,
Rosencranz’s letters to Sen. Dodd
of the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee and FCC Chair
man Newton Minow and the right
of students to speak out on public
issues.

Rosencranz stated that he was
greatly surprised by the reaction
of the Administration to his let
ters to Dodd and Minow. He re
called that neither his previous
letters to the editor of The Mis
sissippian of the University of
Mississipp last October, the Stu
dent Body President of Colorado
University, nor the Legislature's
resolution approving Proposition
13 and opposing Proposition 24 in
the November election, were
found objectionable by the Ad
ministration. He continued, “Un
der the present circumstances, I
regret that I wrote the letters (to
Dodd and Minow). With the pre
vious letters as precedents, I
thought there would be no prob
lem.”
However, Rosencranz did go on
to say that he resisted the idea
that the Legislature should not
speak without prior “censorship”
by the Administration. He said
that the resolutions of last Thurs
day resulted in a net gain in that
the “President and the Board of
Trustees are finally impressed
with, our need to speak out and
now are trying to find away to
accommodate this desire.”
In one instance, Rosencranz
strongly disagreed with Sterling’s
address to a special Legislature
meeting yesterday afternoon in
Tresidder Union. He deplored
Sterling’s suggestion that sus
pension from the University was
considered as a disciplinary mat
ter for some officers as a result
of the last Legislature meeting.
Said Rosencranz, “However mis
guided student opinion may be,
it is deplorable to suggest sus
pension or dissolution of the Leg
islature as a proper reaction to
our action.” Ho did commend
Sterling for his frequent meet
ings in the last week with stu
dent leaders and for the over all
“amiability” of his speech that
afternoon.
Rosencranz stated his belief
that expression of representative
student opinion will inevitably be
approved. He borrowed a quota
tion Sterling had used in his ad
di-ess that afternoon to conclude
his remarks, “There ain’t no hold
that can’t be broken.”
