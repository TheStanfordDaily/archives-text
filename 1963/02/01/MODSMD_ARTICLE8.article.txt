“I address this note to the stu
dent body of Stanford University.
“Student government at Stan
ford operates under a Constitu
tion which is approved by the
President of Ihe University and
the Board of Trustees. This Con
stitution provides for a legisla
ture, which exercises its ‘juris
diction over all student organiza
tions, . . . subject to the regula
tions of the University.’

“The proposed new Constitu
tion, voted by the students on 29
November 1962, has not been ap
proved, pending the completion
of a review of the University’s
regulations and of the relation
between these regulations and
the proposed Constitution. Stu
dent government continues to
function, therefore, under the
‘old’ Constitution.
"On 30 January, some student
leaders with whom I have had
discussions on University affairs
from time to time, met with me.
Those students present were
Misses Priscilla Ferguson and Su
san Westerberg, and Messrs. Ar
min Rosencranz. John Steinbrun
ner, Nils Wessell, and James
Woolsey.
“On 31 January the members
of Legislature met with me. On
both occasions I made clear that
the ‘old’ Constitution remains in
effect; that no student or student
officer may take action under the
aegis of the proposed but unap
proved ‘new’ Constitution; and
that any student or student offi
cer who takes any such action
will be held strictly accountable
for his act.
“On both occasions I also stated
my interest in continuing to af
ford Stanford students opportu
nity to discuss public issues, and
my concern to have any resolu
tions resulting from such discus
sions make clear what students
take what positions in what is
sues.”
