# No Farm Harm in Big Deluge
## 
### 
Our storm, ending a dry month
on a wet note and providing a
who - can - foresee-what-kind-of-a
month’s wet opening, has done
little material harm to the Farm
this far, and is providing some
benefits.

Elbridge Bacon. Jr., Superin
tendent of Buildings and Grounds,
reported that there had been a
few trees blown down and that a
falling limb had smashed an au
tomobile window near the Varian
lab. “There has been leakage in
Flo Mo and other buildings due
to the rain being driven horizon
tally,” he said.
This storm is bringing good
with it, as even an ill wind must,
proverbs aside. “Lake Lag is fill
ing nicely. We see no problems
in having a nice full lake for
spring. Searsvilie is already full,”
Bacon reported.
John Laird of tlie Development
Office said that the river and
thereby requisite ford in front of
the bookstore and post office
would remain at least throughout
this winter.
There is a long range plan to
provide adequate drainage, in
volving a run-off system extend
ing from the clusters to the Deke
house, down Lasuen past the
bookstore and Main Libe to His
tory Corner, then right past En
cina. As yet, this is only com
pleted from the Encina end to the
Libe.
