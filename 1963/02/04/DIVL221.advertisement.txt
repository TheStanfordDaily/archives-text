I INDIANS,
The start of a new
week is a likely time
to take stock, among
other things of the
state of the old ward
robe. How are you
fixed for I. Shirts, for
one? R A has ’em in
dacron and cotton for
carefree laundering,
fine-fitting, with a
one-piece reinforced
collarette that holds
its shape. February
Special price too —
usually 2.00, now but
a mere 1.59, or three
for 4.65. Why not
take on a supply?
ROOS/ATKINS
