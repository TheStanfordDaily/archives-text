# Clark, Steinbruner Investigate New Idea in Freshman Living
## 
### MICHAEL SAKS 
Freshman English and Western Civ without grades, integra
tion of classroom with residence—it’s not impossible. In fact, these
ideas and others are being discussed in University circles, accord
ing to Dwight Clark, Director of the Wilbur Houses, and John
Steinbruner, W ilbur Head Sponsor. Nothing definite has been
decided. Clark would like to sec*

“a molting together of living and
learning.” Ho explained that
"Wilbur faculty residents have
spent several months looking at
the current Freshman academic
program and its effects upon the
men in the houses.

“There has been some concern
that men who come with a high
degree of spirit and elan for the
University’s intellectual life and
program lose this feeling too fast,
and their life seems more charac
terized by moving from midterm
to midterm, civ assignment to civ
assignment, and English theme to
English theme.”
CI.AUK VOICED a complaint
that "their homework is getting
in the way of their education."
In an effort to replace “grade
grubbing” with intellectual mo
tivation and to tie together the
academic and resident parts of
the University, a pilot plan is be
ing considered that would:
1. Involve two to four Wilbur
houses. Students on one floor
would have the same English or
Civ instructor;
2. Replace present grading with
a “Pass” or “Fail” rating along
with a written analysis of the
general quality of the student's
work;
3. Integrate required English
themes with the Civ topic cur
rently under discussion;
4. Provide for a teaching as
sistant to live in the house if he
were interested.
MANY OPERATIONAL prob
lems still have to be solved. One
is the best way to integrate fresh
man women into the program.
The pilot plan calls for the usual
ratio of girls.
Dr. Wilfred Stone, Director of
Freshman English, agrees with
the basic philosophy behind the
program. He would like to see a
de-emphasizing of grades and an
increase in intellectual stimula
tion. Steinbruner emphasized that
the pilot program has no set date.
The proposal hasn’t oven been of
ficially made. It is just a glimpse
into Stanford’s academic
thoughts for the future.

program and its effects upon the
men in the houses.

“There has been some concern
that men who come with a high
degree of spirit and elan for the
University’s intellectual life and
program lose this feeling too fast,
and their life seems more charac
terized by moving from midterm
to midterm, civ assignment to civ
assignment, and English theme to
English theme.”
CI.AUK VOICED a complaint
that "their homework is getting
in the way of their education."
In an effort to replace “grade
grubbing” with intellectual mo
tivation and to tie together the
academic and resident parts of
the University, a pilot plan is be
ing considered that would:
1. Involve two to four Wilbur
houses. Students on one floor
would have the same English or
Civ instructor;
2. Replace present grading with
a “Pass” or “Fail” rating along
with a written analysis of the
general quality of the student's
work;
3. Integrate required English
themes with the Civ topic cur
rently under discussion;
4. Provide for a teaching as
sistant to live in the house if he
were interested.
MANY OPERATIONAL prob
lems still have to be solved. One
is the best way to integrate fresh
man women into the program.
The pilot plan calls for the usual
ratio of girls.
Dr. Wilfred Stone, Director of
Freshman English, agrees with
the basic philosophy behind the
program. He would like to see a
de-emphasizing of grades and an
increase in intellectual stimula
tion. Steinbruner emphasized that
the pilot program has no set date.
The proposal hasn’t oven been of
ficially made. It is just a glimpse
into Stanford’s academic
thoughts for the future.
Freshman English and Western Civ without grades, integra
tion of classroom with residence—it’s not impossible. In fact, these
ideas and others are being discussed in University circles, accord
ing to Dwight Clark, Director of the Wilbur Houses, and John
Steinbruner, W ilbur Head Sponsor. Nothing definite has been
decided. Clark would like to sec*

“a molting together of living and
learning.” Ho explained that
"Wilbur faculty residents have
spent several months looking at
the current Freshman academic
program and its effects upon the
men in the houses.
