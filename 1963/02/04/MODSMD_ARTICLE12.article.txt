# The
						KPFA Affair
## 
### 
If Stanford is to become a “great” university, it must al
low its students to take a united stand on national and inter
national affairs. This is the paramount issue in the current
controversy revolving around Legislature’s recent action on
the Senate investigation of KPFA,
LASSU, in endorsing Annin Rosencranz’s letter to Sena
tor Thomas Dodd, took a courageous stand. The members of
LASSU tried to impress upon the University that the right of
freedom of speech transcends any arbitrary ruling by the
Administration.
It would, however, have been wiser for LASSU to pass a
resolution deploring the Administration’s stand on this matter
than deliberately to defy University rules. Legislature is a
body representing, in theory, if not in practice, all of the
registered students of Stanford University. Stanford students
are members of an organized society, and for a society to
function successfully, members of the society must abide by
the rules set for the society. Only as a last resort is there justi
fication for defying these rules.
Legislature, in acting as it did, ignored the fact that if
the people in a society do not agree with the rules of the
society, they should try to change the rules, rather than make
a mockery of the entire legal system by arbitrarily setting the
rules aside. If all other methods fail, and direct resistance
to the rules is the only possible way to achieve the desired
end, then, and only then, is such action justified.
LASSU should, then, have attempted to change the policy
of the University by expressing its disapproval of Dean Win
bigler’s letter, rather than by ignoring the policy at the first
opportunity. Only if all other attempts had tailed wmdd
LASSU have been justified in deliberately defying a Univer
sity decree.
It is unfortunate that this oversight on LASSU’s part, com
bined with the fact that Mr. Rosencranz sent his original
letter to Senator Dodd without the approval of Legislature,
and the fact that LASSU, as it stands now, is not a truly repre
sentative body, have clouded the issue.
The central issue, that the right of students to speak out
on public affairs is essential to the development of a “great”
university, remains unchanged. The Administration and the
Board of Trustees should realize this fact and do all that is
in their power to change the University’s policy.
