# PLAY REVIEW
## The 						Matchmaker' Called Delightful' 
### 
By JOSEPH L. JAC OBS
“The Matchmaker,” the Thornton Wilder farce that opened
at Memorial Auditorium last Friday, is like a souffle. Well done,
it is light and sweet, leaving a pleasant taste; poorly done, it
is flat and ordinary. The Stanford Players production is neither
flat nor ordinary; in fact, director Norman Philbrick has
whipped up one of the frothiest and most delightful shows this
reviewer can remember.
The quality of a production of “The Matchmaker” depends
to a large extent upon its physical production. Philbrick’s direc
tion, superb as it is. would not be enough. But he has been
fortunate in getting Holmes Easley’s lovely sets, Paul Landry’s
effective lighting, and Marie Chesley’s charming costumes to
add to the audiences’ delight. Even more important, the work of
each of this quartet of creative craftsmen complements and
enhances that of each of the others, and they all combine to
provide a visual treat.
Easley’s sets and Mrs. Chesley’s costumes are all done in
pastels, mostly pinks, purples, and yellows. And Landry’s warm
lighting (one of the rare Stanford productions that uses foot
lights) brings out the best in both. The costumes are constantly
breathtaking and, although in the style of the 1880’s, afford the
actors a great deal of mobility. The stylized sets are equally
stunning, and the applause for the set when the fourth act cur
tain rose was well deserved.
Enough pi’aise cannot be given to Philbrick’s fast paced and
frenetic direction. The business that he has given to the actors is
laugh-provoking, and the chase at the end of the third act is
hysterical. The singing during the curtain call provides just the
right note on which to end the play.
The cast also is uniformly good. The actors are all having a
great deal of fun, and the audience is invited to join in. Leading
the merry romp is Priscilla Oliver as Mrs. Levi, the matchmaker.
She has the best lines in the play, and makes the most of them.
She can artfully throw a lino away or, by a split-second pause
or bit of business, turn a straight line into something outrage
ously funny. And in her fourth act soliloquy she manages to be
touching and tender without ever seeming out of character.
Alvin S. Kaufman ably portrays the blustering and miserly
merchant Horace Vandergelder. At one point he informs the
audience that “99 per cent of the people in the world are fools,
and the rest of us are in great danger of contagion.” But it is
his own foolishness, and his eventual awareness of it, that traps
him in the end.
Susan Leich is excellent as Mrs. Molloy. the milliner who
"can no longer stand being suspected of being a wicked woman
while I have nothing to show for it.” After a rather slow first
act (in which she does not appear), she dominates the second
act and gives the play enough vitality to carry through to the
final curtain.
M. H. Goldberg is delightful as the drunk apprentice who
is “trying out (his employer) for a few days.” And his soliloquy,
in which he encourages the audience to “nurse one vice in your
bosom . . . and let your virtues spring up modestly around it”
is one of the show’s hilarious high points.
Herman Poppe and Lawrence Madison are equally as ex
cellent as Vandergelder’s two clerks off on a spree in New York
City. Madison has a tendency to mug, but this is kept under
control for most of the play. They are both at their best in the
second act, which—thanks to Philbrick’s inventiveness—is the
best in the play.
Jane Loeb, as the secretly alcoholic Miss Van Huysen, con
tributes a charming performance and enlivens the fourth act
tremendously. Mary Louise Steinmetz and Lars Kampmann. as
the young lovers, are also very good.
Judith Burgess, J. P. Ellis, Donna Stone, Pauline Peotter,
and David Kirk all contribute well to the general mirth. Only
Bruce Salvatore and David Shookhoff, although not bad, seem
below the high level set by the others.
Although “The Matchmaker” is long, it is never boring, and
I heartily recommend its last three performances this Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday.

By JOSEPH L. JAC OBS
“The Matchmaker,” the Thornton Wilder farce that opened
at Memorial Auditorium last Friday, is like a souffle. Well done,
it is light and sweet, leaving a pleasant taste; poorly done, it
is flat and ordinary. The Stanford Players production is neither
flat nor ordinary; in fact, director Norman Philbrick has
whipped up one of the frothiest and most delightful shows this
reviewer can remember.
The quality of a production of “The Matchmaker” depends
to a large extent upon its physical production. Philbrick’s direc
tion, superb as it is. would not be enough. But he has been
fortunate in getting Holmes Easley’s lovely sets, Paul Landry’s
effective lighting, and Marie Chesley’s charming costumes to
add to the audiences’ delight. Even more important, the work of
each of this quartet of creative craftsmen complements and
enhances that of each of the others, and they all combine to
provide a visual treat.
Easley’s sets and Mrs. Chesley’s costumes are all done in
pastels, mostly pinks, purples, and yellows. And Landry’s warm
lighting (one of the rare Stanford productions that uses foot
lights) brings out the best in both. The costumes are constantly
breathtaking and, although in the style of the 1880’s, afford the
actors a great deal of mobility. The stylized sets are equally
stunning, and the applause for the set when the fourth act cur
tain rose was well deserved.
Enough pi’aise cannot be given to Philbrick’s fast paced and
frenetic direction. The business that he has given to the actors is
laugh-provoking, and the chase at the end of the third act is
hysterical. The singing during the curtain call provides just the
right note on which to end the play.
The cast also is uniformly good. The actors are all having a
great deal of fun, and the audience is invited to join in. Leading
the merry romp is Priscilla Oliver as Mrs. Levi, the matchmaker.
She has the best lines in the play, and makes the most of them.
She can artfully throw a lino away or, by a split-second pause
or bit of business, turn a straight line into something outrage
ously funny. And in her fourth act soliloquy she manages to be
touching and tender without ever seeming out of character.
Alvin S. Kaufman ably portrays the blustering and miserly
merchant Horace Vandergelder. At one point he informs the
audience that “99 per cent of the people in the world are fools,
and the rest of us are in great danger of contagion.” But it is
his own foolishness, and his eventual awareness of it, that traps
him in the end.
Susan Leich is excellent as Mrs. Molloy. the milliner who
"can no longer stand being suspected of being a wicked woman
while I have nothing to show for it.” After a rather slow first
act (in which she does not appear), she dominates the second
act and gives the play enough vitality to carry through to the
final curtain.
M. H. Goldberg is delightful as the drunk apprentice who
is “trying out (his employer) for a few days.” And his soliloquy,
in which he encourages the audience to “nurse one vice in your
bosom . . . and let your virtues spring up modestly around it”
is one of the show’s hilarious high points.
Herman Poppe and Lawrence Madison are equally as ex
cellent as Vandergelder’s two clerks off on a spree in New York
City. Madison has a tendency to mug, but this is kept under
control for most of the play. They are both at their best in the
second act, which—thanks to Philbrick’s inventiveness—is the
best in the play.
Jane Loeb, as the secretly alcoholic Miss Van Huysen, con
tributes a charming performance and enlivens the fourth act
tremendously. Mary Louise Steinmetz and Lars Kampmann. as

is “trying out (his employer) for a few days.” And his soliloquy,
in which he encourages the audience to “nurse one vice in your
bosom . . . and let your virtues spring up modestly around it”
is one of the show’s hilarious high points.
Herman Poppe and Lawrence Madison are equally as ex
cellent as Vandergelder’s two clerks off on a spree in New York
City. Madison has a tendency to mug, but this is kept under
control for most of the play. They are both at their best in the
second act, which—thanks to Philbrick’s inventiveness—is the
best in the play.
Jane Loeb, as the secretly alcoholic Miss Van Huysen, con
tributes a charming performance and enlivens the fourth act
tremendously. Mary Louise Steinmetz and Lars Kampmann. as
the young lovers, are also very good.
Judith Burgess, J. P. Ellis, Donna Stone, Pauline Peotter,
and David Kirk all contribute well to the general mirth. Only
Bruce Salvatore and David Shookhoff, although not bad, seem
below the high level set by the others.
Although “The Matchmaker” is long, it is never boring, and
I heartily recommend its last three performances this Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday.
