## China, India Both Have Good Claim To Disputed Territory' 
### MICHAEL WAGGONER Associate Editor 
The Indian students at Stanford sponsored the film “Munna”
this weekend as part of an effort to raise money for an Indian
Defense Fund to help prevent future aggression on the India-
China border. This is a noble effort, but that does not prevent
skepticism about their cause.
Both India and China have about equally good claims to
the disputed areas, and both sides have at one time in official
maps accepted the other’s claims.
The main area in dispute, Ladakh, is important to the
Chinese as they need a road through it between Sinkiang and
Tibet: the rest of the ai’ea has nothing but frontier posts, snow,
and potential invasion routes.
A long time passed between the time the road was started
and the time the Indian government did anything about it. The
reason given by Mr. Nehru is that he didn’t know about the road,
which is possible due to the isolation of the terrain, but unlikely
as it is near Kashmir, which is under surveillance due to the
dispute with Pakistan. Felix Greene, author of “Awakened
China,” suggested that the Indian government knew of the road,
but took a long time before deciding or realizing they owned
the territory.
This indicates that China wasn’t necessarily an aggressor in
taking the land to build the road, though one could criticize
them for the way they did it: they didn’t tell anyone, and they
knocked off a few border posts.
This year’s activities were started on India’s initiative. She
began gobbling up Chinese posts, edging towards her present
idea of the border. The Chinese told her to stop, which she didn’t,
then very neatly threw her out. They drove her away from the
road in Ladakh, but never crossed their idea of the border. On
the east, their attack opened an invasion route to Indian oil fields
and farm land, but also did not cross the Chinese idea of the
border.
These attacks were launched by well-trained, well-equipped
men against limited objectives. They were very successful, and
as humanely carried out as any war can be. There have been no
atrocity stories and Indian prisoners have been returned.
The attack was stopped before it threatened to escalate, but
after India called in U.S. planes and arms—a step that is likely
to lose Nehru friends among the Neutrals he once led. The Chi
nese then withdrew' from their newly-opened invasion route, a
thing of little use unless they were planning a full scale war,
but an act which gives the impression of non-aggression and
only defending one’s rights.
It seems to me that the Chinese are seeking something of
value, a road with its benefits of communication and construc
tion, and going about it with great diplomatic and military skill
and coolness. The Indian government seems to be acting only
for prestige and from domestic pressure, and doing it very
ineptly on all counts.
The Chinese Communists form a very powerful and impor
tant nation. We must know both their vices and their virtues to
deal with them. They have enough of both that neither need bo
fabricated.
