## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Charlie Hart, who has done lit
tle more than provide comic re
lief for Husky fans this season,
turned hero Friday night. His
running hook shot with four sec
onds remaining gave Washington
a 48-48 upset victory over Stan
ford. The deciding shot ruined a

Stanford rally that had overcome
an 11-point deficit in the second
half.

The Indians were deprived of
a chance to take out revenge on
struggling Washington State the
following night when icy roads
left the team stranded in Spo
kane.

Stanford jumped to an early
7-2 lead against Washington,
sparked by shots by Hollis Moore
and Darell Sutherland. The Hus
kies soon overtook the Tribe, tak
ing a 9-7 lead on Hart’s basket.
With Dale Easley doing a tre
mendous job of rebounding and
putting the clamps on Tom Dose,
the Huskies widened their lead
to 23-14. Easley prevented Dose
from getting a single field goal
in the entire first half. This,
linked with Don Clemetson’s in
ability to find the basket and the
hot shooting of Ed Corell, gave
Washington a 30-23 halftime
lead.
At the half-time break, Dose
and Clemetson, Stnford’s top
scorers, had just four free throws
between them.

Dose began to show his All-
American shooting ability as the

second half began. He shoveled
in three shots in a row. and then
Clemetson connected on a jump
er to narrow the Husky lead to
35-31. Clemetson and Hart got
into a tussle which threatened to
empty both benches, but order
was restored and the only result
was that Washington's temper
amental coach John Grayson was
slapped with a technical foul call.
Sutherland converted the free
throw, and a moment later an
other Sutherland free toss cut
Washington’s lead to just two at
35-33.

With Stanford seemingly ready
to surge ahead and control the
game, Dose collected his fourth
foul with ten minutes remaining.
Washington immediately capital
ized on Dose’s absence by spurt
ing to a 43-33 lead. Moments later
they took their biggest lead of
the game at 45-34.

Dose returned to action and
sparked a rally which saw the
Tribe outscore Washington 10-2
over a span of four minutes. In
the drive Dose and Clemetson
each collected two buckets. With
three minutes remaining in the
game, Stanford pulled to within
one point, 47-46.
Easley, an 82 per cent free
threw shooter, was fouled on the
nex play, but the big center
missed his attempt, giving the
ball back to Stanford. The In
dians worked for a good shot,
and with 50 seconds remaining
Moore tapped in a follow shot to
give Stanford a 48-47 advantage.
This set the stage for Hart’s ten
footer and Washington’s first win
in four meetings with Stanford
this season.
The loss left Stanford’s con
ference record at tjiree wins,and
‘ohie loSs season tnSrk at
12 wins and four losses.
Corell led all scorers with 15
points, while Hart had 13 for
Washington. Dose tallied 13 for
the Indians, followed by Moore
with ten and Sutherland and
Clemetson with seven each.
