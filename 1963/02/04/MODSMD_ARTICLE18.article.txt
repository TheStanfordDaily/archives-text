# SJS Trips Freshmen

### 
For all but the last three min
utes of the game Friday night it
looked as if Stanford’s freshman
basketball team would surprise
the powerful San Jose State frosh
and tag a loss on the Spartans.
But the Indians couldn’t hold on
to a large early advantage and
lost 56-52. The game was played
on the Spartans’ home coure.
The Tribe, which was coached
by former Stanford center Mike
Ledgerwood in the absence of
regular coach Bill Turner, jump
ed to an early lead. By half-time
Stanford had built the advantage
up to a 30-22 margin, and it look
ed as if San Jose, which now
boasts a 10-2 record, might be
upset.
It was not to he, however. San
Jose’s superior height began to
tell. The team, which averages
G’4” per man in their starling
lineup, started controlling the
boards, with Jeff Goodere and S.
T. Safford, both fi’7”. leading the
way.
With only four minutes re
maining, Stanford still clung to
a narrow three-point margin. At
this point the Indians’ two top
scorers, Skip Hutchison and Bob
Bedell, were taken out for a much
needed rest. With their scoring
punch gone, Stanford could not
hold the lead, and San Jose went
on to win by four.
Stanford’s scoring was led by
Bedell, who collected 15 points,
his season’s average. Hutchison,
who had a cold night from the
field, got 11 tallies. Jim Pandell
contributed nine for the Tribe.
The loss brought Stanford’s rec
ord on the season to 5 wins and
3 losses. The Indians have a
chance for revenge next Satur
day when they meet the Spartans
in the Pavilion.
