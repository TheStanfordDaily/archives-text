# Card Grapplers Down S.F. State
## 
### 
Thanks to forfeits in the 123-
and 127-pound classes, Stanfordâ€™s
varsity wrestling squad was able
to squeeze out an 18-15 win over
San Francisco State. The Cards
now are 3-2 for the season.
San Francisco collected the
only two pins of the match, as
Bill Denyer downed Tim Davis in
7:20 and Bill Simons pinned Hap
Klopp in 4:29. In fact, the San
Francisco squad had the unnerv
ing experience of winning a ma
jority of the matches actually
fought, and yet losing the meet.
Dan Barnett and Phil Kendall
scored three-point victories for
Stanford in the 137 and 157
weights. Winning for San Fran
cisco State was heavyweight
Craig Preiserdorf. Jim Connor of
Stanford fought to a two-point
standoff with George McNeal in
the other contested division, the
167-pound class.
