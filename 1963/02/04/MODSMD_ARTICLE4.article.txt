# Time For A Change?

### JAMES WILEY WILLIAM MOGUL 
Stanford’s present system of
selecting department heads -
through administrative appoint
ment for lifelong terms should
be junked in favor of more demo
cratic means.

At least that’s what a small
sample of University professors
told The Daily last week.
And the substitute method? De
partmental elections for definite
terms of office.
“I have been looking for a
change from the present execu
tive head to the more democratic
system for a long time,” said Dr.

I Gordon Wright, executive head
jof the History Department, on
leave during 1962-63.
And, he added, such a change
is bound to he made eventually.
UNDER the present system an
executive head is selected
through the University’s chain of
command—starting with the de
partment’s professors, w'ho give
their personal recommendations
to their dean, and ending with
the president and the provost,
who jointly make the final de
cision.
But under the system Wright
and a number of other faculty
members have proposed, a chair
man would bo elected by his own
department for a definite term of
office.
The chairman’s job would be
(the same as the executive head’s,
j Since the chairman’s would re
| main the only administrative of
fice with in the department, he
j would still be in charge of deter-
I mining such items as departmen
i tal programs, salaries, and budg
] ets. And he would be free- as the
j present executive heads are—to
use his department members as
advisors.
THE MAJOR obstacle to the
chairman system would be one of
numbers, pointed out Dr. Brooks
Otis, executive head of the Clas
sics Department.
“Although I’m in favor of the
| now method,” he said, “it would
be difficult for the smaller do
• partments since they would not
| have as many professors to rotate
j around for the office.”
And there’s another problem,
j too one of precedence. Accord
| ing to George Knoles, acting ex
ecutive head of the History De
j partment, only a few U.S. institu
j tions have adopted the chairman
; system. But one of them happens
1 to be Harvard.
