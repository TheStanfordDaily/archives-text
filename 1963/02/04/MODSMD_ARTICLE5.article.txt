# Don Glaser's Quartet Plays At Tresidder Jam Session
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
In these days of Miles Davis,
who walks off the bandstand, and
Thelonious Monk, who sometimes
doesn’t show up at all, it is a
pleasure to run across a genuine
ly affable maestro of a jazz com
bo. Such a leader is Don Glaser,
whose quartet jammed for an
hour and a half at Tresidder
Lounge yesterday afternoon.
THK GROUP features Glaser
on piano. Tom Harrell on trumpet
and flugelhorn, Mark Markley on

bass, and Charlie Hadenfeldt be
hind the drums. Its repertoire
ranges from blues to bop to Bossa
Nova. Opening with an up-tempo
“I Remember April,” the group
swung into a lilting version of
“Doxy,” highlighted by a short
but melodic bass solo and the big
chords and commanding instinct
of Don Glaser.
Glaser attempted a vocal on
“But Not for Me,” and though he
is not possessed of a brilliant
voice, his scat interpretation
compared not unfavorably with
| some of Ella Fitzgerald’s. The
[quartet finished out the first set
i with an untitled ad-lib blues, on
which the trumpet solo and the
cohesiveness between bass and
drums were notable.
AFTER THE break, Monk’s
original “Straight, No Chaser”
began the sitting. Don’s blues
tinged style, elsewhere very ef
fective, was not entirely appro
priate to the piece. This minor
flaw was overshadowed by an ex
plosive drum solo by Charlie
Hadenfeldt, into which he incor
porated three-drum rolls and the
tone on the snare drum by apply
ing pressure with his elbow.
Both devices are trademarks of
Art Blakey; Hadenfeldt used
them well.
When asked how long the group
had been together, Glaser grinned
and said, “Oh, about a day.” This
was not much of an exaggeration,
as the quartet, in spite of their co
operation on stage, had not play
ed any engagements prior to this
one.
GLASER hopes to continue the
quartet, depending on the reac
j lion to this concert. The four are
[ amateurs, but Harrell is not
j afraid to experiment. Glaser
j keeps a sure hand on the reins,
j and the rhythm section provides
i a sound backbone for their im
j provisatlons. It’s a young, fresh
1 music.

ly affable maestro of a jazz com
bo. Such a leader is Don Glaser,
whose quartet jammed for an
hour and a half at Tresidder
Lounge yesterday afternoon.
THK GROUP features Glaser
on piano. Tom Harrell on trumpet
and flugelhorn, Mark Markley on

bass, and Charlie Hadenfeldt be
hind the drums. Its repertoire
ranges from blues to bop to Bossa
Nova. Opening with an up-tempo
“I Remember April,” the group
swung into a lilting version of
“Doxy,” highlighted by a short
but melodic bass solo and the big
chords and commanding instinct
of Don Glaser.
Glaser attempted a vocal on
“But Not for Me,” and though he
is not possessed of a brilliant
voice, his scat interpretation
compared not unfavorably with
| some of Ella Fitzgerald’s. The
[quartet finished out the first set
i with an untitled ad-lib blues, on
which the trumpet solo and the
cohesiveness between bass and
drums were notable.
AFTER THE break, Monk’s
original “Straight, No Chaser”
began the sitting. Don’s blues
tinged style, elsewhere very ef
fective, was not entirely appro
priate to the piece. This minor
flaw was overshadowed by an ex
plosive drum solo by Charlie
Hadenfeldt, into which he incor
porated three-drum rolls and the
tone on the snare drum by apply
ing pressure with his elbow.
Both devices are trademarks of
Art Blakey; Hadenfeldt used
them well.
When asked how long the group
had been together, Glaser grinned
and said, “Oh, about a day.” This
was not much of an exaggeration,
as the quartet, in spite of their co
operation on stage, had not play
ed any engagements prior to this
one.
GLASER hopes to continue the
quartet, depending on the reac
j lion to this concert. The four are
[ amateurs, but Harrell is not
j afraid to experiment. Glaser
j keeps a sure hand on the reins,
j and the rhythm section provides
i a sound backbone for their im
j provisatlons. It’s a young, fresh
1 music.
