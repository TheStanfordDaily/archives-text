was defeated by Wayne State in
a 2-1 decision at the Harvard In

end. The team, consisting of
Chuck Bischoff and Barry Carter,
one of 108 debate teams from 92

feated Northwestern, the winner

Stanford went undefeated into
the finals along with Dartmouth,
Harvard, and Pepperdine and
won their first final round
against Whitman. At the Harvard

Tonight Stanford will debate j
