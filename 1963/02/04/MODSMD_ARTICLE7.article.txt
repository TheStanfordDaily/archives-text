## 
### 
Four Stanford students picket
ed the Friday and Saturday
showings of a movie sponsored
by the lIR and the India Associ
ation because proceeds from the
movie were to go to the National
Defense Fund of India.
In a letter in the Friday edition
of The Daily, Kit Havice, a mem
ber of the Peace Caucus, said he
and others would picket the film
“Munna” so “people who plan to
buy tickets would realize that
they will be supporting and aid
ing in the killing of human be
ings.”
The reference was to the India-
China border dispute, in which
the Defense Fund supplies cloth
ing and arms to the Indian sol
diers.
IN HIS FRIDAY letter. Havice
urged that the HR “Asia desk
and the India Association . . .
raise money for the Border Re
lief Fund, which is used for the
rehabilitation of refugees.”
As a result of the letter, the
organizations offered two options
to ticket buyers: They could spec
ify that money from their tickets
be designated for either the De-
I fense Fund or the Relief Fund.
! But out of 230 tickets sold, only
20 were designated for the Re-
I lief Fund.
Despite the conciliatory gesture,
I the pickets continued their pro-
I test in front of Cubberley Audi
| tolium, where the film was
i shown.
THEY BRANDISHED signs
reading: “Use Your Money to
Feed and Shelter, Not to Kill,”
“Give to Border Relief Funds.”
One sign carried a quotation
from former President Eisenhow
er: “Every government that is
made, every warship that is
! launched, every rocket that is
j fired, signifies, in the final sense,
j a theft from those who are hun
gry and are not fed, those who
are cold and are not clothed . . .

is there no other way the world
can live?”

In addition to Havice, picketers
included Steve Morris, Judy Op
penheimer and Philip Cohen.
