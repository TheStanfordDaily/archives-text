# Issue of Student Organizations Debated By Woolsey, Boileau
## 
### MICHAEL SAKS 
Jim Woolsey and Don Boileau debated the proposition “Re
solved that Stanford University should permit student organiza
tions to take stands on public issues and take part in social and
political actions last Friday afternoon in Tresidder main lounge
for a small but vocal audience. Woolsey opened with the af-

firmative position. He sketched a<
brief history of the controversy,
saying that it is older than
PACE. In his opinion, “Jane
Stanford lived too long.” She had
a heavy hand in forming Univer
sity policy, said Woolsey. This
policy has had different interpre
tations, as when, in the ]94o’s
President Wilbur upbraided the
student body for its indifference
to the Finnish situation.
LASSU has taken four stands
already this year. Woolsey listed
them as: 1 1 the Mississippi crisis,
2) the Colorado University ver
sus (he student editor, 3i proposi
tion 13, and 4) proposition 24. He
sees the KPFA letter as the mild
est of the stands, yet it prompted
the administration to forbid any
student group or officer from
taking a stand on a non-universi
ty issue. This is a reversal from
former policy.
WOOLSEY held that Stanford
should analyze and change its
policy. In support, he cited the
increasing political awareness of
the student body, as evidenced by
the high percentage of merit
scholars who list Stanford as
their first choice.
“Learning cannot be divorced
from doing,” Woolsey contended;
Stanford's isolated position keeps
students from actively participat
ing off campus. Also, he believes
it is superfluous to draw a line
between individual student action
and group action. A good idea is
good enough for both, he said.
The question should be, "Why
I isn’t the University encouraging
| students to take social and polit
ical stands?”

on campus but are disassociated
from the university. Woolsey be
lieves that President Wallace
Sterling may ask the Trustees lor
this plan.
There are many areas, accord
ing to Woolsey, where students
should take stands, particularly
when students’ rights are being
restricted.
He proposed several sugges
tions that could make the new
LASSU more representative of
student opinion, such as minori
ty reports, disclaimers, opinion
polls, and referendums.
BOILEAU countered with the
negative position; the University
has the right to control what the
student government has the right
to say. For legal proof, he quoted
Justice Holmes.
Above all, the university pro
vides a place to gain an educa
tion, according to Boileau;
LASSU and other student organi
zations are permitted to exist for
their educational functions, but
stands that the groups take will
be looked up as University
stands.
He pointed out that the univer
sity never prohibits an individu
al’s action. Also, it provides a Po
litical Union with caucuses and
allowed the M.U.S.S. to take a
stand on KPFA.
Because the university has le
gal, political, and economic obli
gations, it has the right to con
trol stands in any organization it
chooses.
BOILEAU asked if LASSU was
! formed to take stands on such is
sues as Mississippi or Colorado.
The LASSU reps weren’t elected
on these issues. Ife we allow’legis
lature to lake stands on certain
topics, w’here do we call a halt?
He sees the time when Republi
can and Democratic positions
would become part of Stanford
politics. Besides, Rosencranz can’t
help but speak for the student
body when he takes a stand, even
though he wasn’t elected to do so.
Dean H. Donald Winbigler’s
stand is too severe, Boileau be
lieves, but he thinks it will be
changed in line with Sterling’s
new statement.
At this point, the debate
stopped for a half-hour question
and answer period, after which
Boileau and Woolsey summarized
their positions.
Boileau restated his position
(hat student organizations should
harmonize with the functions of
the university, allowing it to ful
fill its public and educational re
sponsibilities.
Woolsey used his closing min
utes to bring in a bit of personal
philosophy. “Controversy, on the
whole, is healthy.” Although the
situation is improving, Woolsey
does not think that the University
is presenting the best educational
atmosphere for the student.
“You don’t encourage response
i bility by not allowing the making
! of mistakes,” he said. It would be
j better to hire more secretaries
[ than to tell (he Legislature what
j to do. “Stanford’s position for too
long has been ‘The Legend of
Sleepy Hollow’,” Woolsey con-
I eluded.

negative position; the University
has the right to control what the
student government has the right
to say. For legal proof, he quoted
Justice Holmes.
Above all, the university pro
vides a place to gain an educa
tion, according to Boileau;
LASSU and other student organi
zations are permitted to exist for
their educational functions, but
stands that the groups take will
be looked up as University
stands.
He pointed out that the univer
sity never prohibits an individu
al’s action. Also, it provides a Po
litical Union with caucuses and
allowed the M.U.S.S. to take a
stand on KPFA.
Because the university has le
gal, political, and economic obli
gations, it has the right to con
trol stands in any organization it
chooses.
BOILEAU asked if LASSU was
! formed to take stands on such is
sues as Mississippi or Colorado.
The LASSU reps weren’t elected
on these issues. Ife we allow’legis
lature to lake stands on certain
topics, w’here do we call a halt?
He sees the time when Republi
can and Democratic positions
would become part of Stanford
politics. Besides, Rosencranz can’t
help but speak for the student
body when he takes a stand, even
though he wasn’t elected to do so.
Dean H. Donald Winbigler’s
stand is too severe, Boileau be
lieves, but he thinks it will be
changed in line with Sterling’s
new statement.
At this point, the debate
stopped for a half-hour question

Boileau and Woolsey summarized
their positions.
Boileau restated his position
(hat student organizations should
harmonize with the functions of
the university, allowing it to ful
fill its public and educational re
sponsibilities.
Woolsey used his closing min
utes to bring in a bit of personal
philosophy. “Controversy, on the
whole, is healthy.” Although the
situation is improving, Woolsey
does not think that the University
is presenting the best educational
atmosphere for the student.
“You don’t encourage response
i bility by not allowing the making
! of mistakes,” he said. It would be
j better to hire more secretaries
[ than to tell (he Legislature what

long has been ‘The Legend of
Sleepy Hollow’,” Woolsey con-
I eluded.

firmative position. He sketched a<
brief history of the controversy,
saying that it is older than

Stanford lived too long.” She had
a heavy hand in forming Univer

sees the KPFA letter as the mild

the administration to forbid any
student group or officer from
taking a stand on a non-universi

former policy.
WOOLSEY held that Stanford
should analyze and change its
policy. In support, he cited the
increasing political awareness of
the student body, as evidenced by
the high percentage of merit
scholars who list Stanford as
their first choice.
“Learning cannot be divorced
from doing,” Woolsey contended;
Stanford's isolated position keeps
students from actively participat
ing off campus. Also, he believes
it is superfluous to draw a line

Jim Woolsey and Don Boileau debated the proposition “Re
solved that Stanford University should permit student organiza
tions to take stands on public issues and take part in social and
political actions last Friday afternoon in Tresidder main lounge
for a small but vocal audience. Woolsey opened with the af-

firmative position. He sketched a<
brief history of the controversy,
saying that it is older than
PACE. In his opinion, “Jane
Stanford lived too long.” She had
a heavy hand in forming Univer
sity policy, said Woolsey. This
policy has had different interpre
tations, as when, in the ]94o’s
President Wilbur upbraided the
student body for its indifference
to the Finnish situation.
LASSU has taken four stands
already this year. Woolsey listed
them as: 1 1 the Mississippi crisis,
2) the Colorado University ver
sus (he student editor, 3i proposi
tion 13, and 4) proposition 24. He
sees the KPFA letter as the mild
est of the stands, yet it prompted
the administration to forbid any
student group or officer from
taking a stand on a non-universi
ty issue. This is a reversal from
former policy.
WOOLSEY held that Stanford
should analyze and change its
policy. In support, he cited the
increasing political awareness of
the student body, as evidenced by
the high percentage of merit
scholars who list Stanford as
their first choice.
“Learning cannot be divorced
from doing,” Woolsey contended;
Stanford's isolated position keeps
students from actively participat
ing off campus. Also, he believes
it is superfluous to draw a line
between individual student action
and group action. A good idea is
good enough for both, he said.
The question should be, "Why
I isn’t the University encouraging

ical stands?”

on campus but are disassociated
from the university. Woolsey be
lieves that President Wallace
Sterling may ask the Trustees lor
this plan.
There are many areas, accord
ing to Woolsey, where students
should take stands, particularly
when students’ rights are being
restricted.
He proposed several sugges
tions that could make the new
LASSU more representative of
student opinion, such as minori
ty reports, disclaimers, opinion
polls, and referendums.
BOILEAU countered with the
negative position; the University
has the right to control what the
student government has the right
to say. For legal proof, he quoted
Justice Holmes.
Above all, the university pro
vides a place to gain an educa
tion, according to Boileau;
LASSU and other student organi
zations are permitted to exist for
their educational functions, but
stands that the groups take will
be looked up as University
stands.
He pointed out that the univer
sity never prohibits an individu
al’s action. Also, it provides a Po
litical Union with caucuses and
allowed the M.U.S.S. to take a
stand on KPFA.
Because the university has le
gal, political, and economic obli
gations, it has the right to con
trol stands in any organization it
chooses.
BOILEAU asked if LASSU was
! formed to take stands on such is
sues as Mississippi or Colorado.
The LASSU reps weren’t elected
on these issues. Ife we allow’legis
lature to lake stands on certain
topics, w’here do we call a halt?
He sees the time when Republi
can and Democratic positions
would become part of Stanford
politics. Besides, Rosencranz can’t
help but speak for the student
body when he takes a stand, even
though he wasn’t elected to do so.
Dean H. Donald Winbigler’s
stand is too severe, Boileau be
lieves, but he thinks it will be
changed in line with Sterling’s
new statement.
At this point, the debate
stopped for a half-hour question
and answer period, after which
Boileau and Woolsey summarized
their positions.
Boileau restated his position
(hat student organizations should
harmonize with the functions of
the university, allowing it to ful
fill its public and educational re
sponsibilities.
Woolsey used his closing min
utes to bring in a bit of personal
philosophy. “Controversy, on the
whole, is healthy.” Although the
situation is improving, Woolsey
does not think that the University
is presenting the best educational
atmosphere for the student.
