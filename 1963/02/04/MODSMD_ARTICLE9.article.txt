## De Gaulle Meets Military Chief Concerning Paris-Madrid Axis 
### 
United Press International
MADRID—Gen. Charles Ailleret, French military chief of staff,
flew here yesterday to press Charles de Gaulle’s courtship of a
bashful and coolly cautious Spain. The visit was one of six by key
French leaders which raised the possibility of creation of a Paris-
Bonn-Madrid axis that could touch off another serious Paris-Wash
ington policy clash.
In London the Sunday Express speculated that De Gaulle would
ask Spain to close down American air bases on Spanish soil in return
for a close military alliance with Paris. Ailleret arrived to handle the
military part of the wooing that many experts said could end with a
new power alignment inside De Gaulle’s “grand design” for Euro
pean leadership.
CANADA QUESTIONS HEMISPHERE DEFENSE ROLE OTTA
WA—Canada waited tensely yesterday to see whether Prime Minis
ter John Diefenbaker would dissolve Parliament and take his case
against the United States to the voters. The election would focus on
Canada’s role in this hemisphere’s defense and how much—if any
say-so the United States should have in it.
The country has been in a state of uncertainty since the release
of a U.S. State Department statement Wednesday criticizing Canada
for not including U.S.-supervised nuclear weapons in its defense
plans.
