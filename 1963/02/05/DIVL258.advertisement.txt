Who knows water better than a fish?
As an ultimate safeguard, we let our Sticklebacks
test the water, before it is released. If (hey like it,
we know it will be happy water for any fish.
The object is to keep our streams and coastal waters
pollution-free with abundant fish to nibble your
hooks, and clean playgrounds for your water sports,
Many other industries which depend upon water are
equally careful. Our common concern
is to protect a priceless heritage.
Planning ahead to serve you better
STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA
The fish we employ as water experts are tiny Stickle
backs. We pay them liberally in brine-shrimp, no
salary deductions.
It’s all because we use millions of gallons of water
daily in our refineries. After use, it is treated with
algae, bacteria, chemicals, sunshine and oxygen, to
make sure the water is clean and pure when we
return it to stream or sea.
