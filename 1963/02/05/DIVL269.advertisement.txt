Her name’s Chatty Cathy®. She and her sisters live
with over five million little girls who take daily de
light in playing with her. She’s made by Mattel Toy
makers, the industry’s leader.
In her own way, Chatty Cathy is an engineering
miracle. She was the first doll that really talked. She
was conceived by Mattel engineers (“invented to
order” is the term we use), fretted and fussed over
during her gestation period by Mattel engineers,
and attended at birth by Mattel engineers. All kinds
of engineers: mechanical; industrial; tooling; acous
tical ; electronic; chemical... applying their varied
talents, and using to the full every engineering prin
ciple, on problems as complex as those of any other
industry. Chatty Cathy typifies the fact that the
common denominator... and most necessary requi
site for a Mattel engineer... is imagination.
Thei'e could be a place for you at Mattel if you are
now studying any of the above engineering special
ties at the B.S. or M.S. level. You’ll join a company
whose every product is engineered to be unique in
its industry. If your future plans include adminis
trative as well as solid engineering work, and if
you feel, as Mattel does, that the enjoyment of
your work is as important as the constant challenge
it presents you, apply to your school placement
