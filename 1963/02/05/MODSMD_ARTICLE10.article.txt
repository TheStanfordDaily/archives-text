# Film About HUAC Premieres Today
## 
### 
The first public showing of the
film “The Committee on Un-
American Activities” will be
given this afternoon at 4:15 in
Cubberley Auditorium. The film,
soon to be released to commercial
theaters, will be shown by its
producer Robert Cohen. The
showing is sponsored by the Po
litical Union.

This special pre release show
ing is due in part to the recent
Senatorial and FCC investiga
tions of radio station KPFA—
Berkeley. Cohen had brought his
film to San Francisco to show to
his friends at KPFA. While in
San Francisco, Cohen was in
formed of the controversy which
has been stirred up at Stanford
between the administration and
the Associated Students. Because
of the pertinent nature of the
film, he was encouraged to bring
it to the campus this afternoon.
The hour-long film begins with
a historical review of the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities, why it was organized
and highlights of its activities.
Much of the film is an exposi
tion of arguments in favor of and
against the Committee. The criti
cisms of the HUAC which wore
lodged by Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Harry Truman and other states
men are answered by the narra
tor using standard answers em
ployed by HUAC supporters.
