# CAMPUS OPINION
## The
						New Legislature; What's Next? 
### ROAN CONRAD 
The recent election of a new Legislature of nearly one hun
dred members could hardly have come at a more propitious
moment in campus affairs. The time is propitious because for
the first time within recent memory the Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford University has asserted the right and
the duty of students to speak out collectively on social and
political issues. Legislature has begun to concern itself with
problems which involve not only Stanford students, but the
larger, off-campus world as well. This involvement with wider
issues has aroused criticism both by the administration and by
some students. But the criticism is of two types, depending on
its source. On the one hand, the University Administration is con
cerned about what seems to them to be improper involvement
of the name of the University in off-campus matters. On the
other hand, student criticism most frequently questions the com
petency of the present Legislature as a representative body to
reflect accurately student opinion.
Into the rather confused situation of the past two weeks the
new Legislature has intruded itself. The enlarged “body” in
cludes representatives for every campus living group, as well as
off-campus and graduate delegates; this composition should go
far to neutralize the criticism of disproportionate and insufficient
representation which students so often, and with justice, make.
For the new Legislature is representative and does reflect the
totality of campus opinion.
But the new Legislature has not yet convened. It cannot do
so, pending approval by the Board of Trustees of (he new ASSU
Constitution which the student body approved by referendum
last quarter. Hopefully the Trustees will act on this matter at
the February meeting. In any case, the Trustees (from all I can
gather) have not deferred action on the new Constitution be
cause of the legislative provisions of the document. Until a final
decision is reached, however, the new assembly has no official
function. This state of affairs is unfortunate, particularly in view
of the controversy of the past two weeks, because now, if ever,
there needs to be communication between the ASSU officials and
the students in living groups—two-way communication.
Even though the new legislature cannot yet meet, even
though it may never meet, this two-way communication could
be greatly facilitated if the ASSU President, with or without
his Ex Comm, would call together the new members of Legisla
ture to meet with him from time to time to exchange views.
This could easily be done as an ad hoc committee to assist the
President of ASSU. The main point is that student opinion—
campus-wide opinion—always has difficulty in filtering to the
top of the hierarchy; and vice-versa. If the President of ASSU
is concerned, as he claims to be, in giving enlightened leadership
to this campus, nothing would be more helpful to him than to
use the enlarged Legislature as a gauge of opinion. The instru
ment for improved communication between students and their
elected leader exists; all Mr. Rosencranz has to do is use it.
