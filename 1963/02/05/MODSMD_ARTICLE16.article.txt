# PLAY REVIEW
## Plays at Comedia 'Excellent' 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
Acting an absurd comedy can be like performing atonal
music. So much of it is frankly experimental and determinedly
unconventional, that one can never be sure he has hit the right
notes.
Thursday night the Comedia Theater in Menlo Park pre
sented two plays by Edward Albee, “The Zoo Story” and “The
American Dream”; and it can be said that Director Erich Faust
and his cast rarely missed a note.
The Comedia, the only independent repertory company on
the Peninsula, has been going steadily for several years, and
presents a continuous format four nights a week. On Monday
nights it alternately presents original and classical plays, on a
contribution basis. Friday and Saturday nights are given over
to two different musicals; Thursday nights are devoted to
dramas. “Two Plays by Edward Albee” gives a favorable im
pression of the latter series.
“The Zoo Story,” with its cast of two, is a terse, finely cut
piece of crystal, delicately hovering between absurd comedy and
bleak tragedy. It is a stark spotlight under which dramatic
ability is severely tested. Split-second timing and a resilient,
subtle focus-shift are the bare prerequisites. As the Comedia
production opened Thursday night liming was a little off-center.
Several of Albee’s most laughable lines slipped past the audience.
But once the action reached its pinnacle and all the cosmic im
plications began to crowd in, the tragic mode took control and
impelled the play to a conclusion. Erich Faust brought forth a
masterful portrayal of Jerry, an outcast schizophrenic. He shift
ed almost imperceptibly from the hopeless misfit, alienating
himself from still another passer-by, to a modern Everyman,
unconsciously building himself into a contemporary myth. Faust
had his hands full grappling with the varying noise level of the
torrential rains outside the theater, which would sometimes
cease and leave his voice resounding on the most inappropriate
line. But he generally overcame this handicap with an expres
siveness of movement and stage business. Richard Anton as
Peter, the lower-upper-middle-class conformist who nevertheless
finds some sympathy for Jerry, did a remarkable job of unob
trusive acting, tlie kind that is only noticed in retrospect. Many
critics have censured Albee’s tragic denouement as melodra
matic, but Anton and Faust manage to control (hose tendencies
so as to link Albee’s ending with the tradition of Greek and
Shakespearian tragedy.
“The American Dream,” while in a lighter, more detached
mode, continues the tragicomic ambiguity of Albee’s world.
The four main characters, Jean Ryder as Mommy, H. H. Bar
tholomew as Daddy, Dorothy Wyman as Grandma, and Lor
raine Huelsenkamp as Grandma, are all good and they interact
well. Bill Huelsencamp fills out his paid with excellent panto
mime. The theme is hypocrisy and culture-pap and (he cast
puts the right edge on Albee’s carefully calculated cliches and
euphuisms. They maintain a solid rhythm in a play which is,
superficially at least, quite disconnected. So well-established
is this rhythm that Mommy can demonstrate graphically the
real absurdity of life by breaking out of her normally pleasantly
vulgar character, shock the audience out of its soporific smug
enjoyment by a scream of deep personal loss, then return as
suddenly to the laugh level and have Grandma finish off the
whole play as neatly as any Restoration comedy.
“Two Plays by Edward Albee” will continue at the Comedia
in Menlo Park every Thursday through March 7.
