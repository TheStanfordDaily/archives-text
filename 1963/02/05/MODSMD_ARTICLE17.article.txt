## Nicaraguan Election in Dispute 
### 
By PETER RISEN BERG
(Editor’s note: This is the second in a series of two articles.
Eisenberg spent the quarter break in Nicaragua and has written
the Nicaraguan section of the “Hispanic American Report” since
1D61.)
Dr. Fernando Agiiero Rocha, leader of the Nicaraguan Tradi
tional Conservative Parly and the mosl popular opposition poli
tician, demanded that (he Organization of American States
(OAS) be invited to supervise last week’s elections to prevent
fraud. Agiiero swore that without OAS supervision his party
would not go to the polls. The popular masses cheered Agiiero
during his campaign which began when President Luis Somoza
raised a state of siege in May 1961. Agiiero brought his appeal
to the smallest towns in western Nicaragua and even visited the
long-neglected east coast. Blessed with a deep, resonant voice, a
gift for fine phrases, and a strong, attractive personality,
Agiiero caught the popular imagination and convinced it that
OAS supervision was necessary.
“I’ll go with Fernando
I’ll die with Agiiero
Because for Agiiero
The people come primero (first)”
The ruling Somoza brothers flatly rejected Agiiero’s de
mand, which they labeled “foreign intervention in violation of
the national sovereignty,” and Agiiero had no choice but to
abstain. “We can’t sit still watching a fraud,” several of the
47-year-old Agiiero’s top aides in Managua warned. With the
popular anger at Agiiero’s frustration, and with the perennial
hatred of the unyielding Somoza dictatorship, the explosive
situation could easily be ignited. . .
Nicaraguan leftists were also left out of the elections. The
socialists and social-Christians, as well aslhecqmmunists, backed
last summer a united front of seven "micro-parties,” supporting
small-town lawyer Humberto Alvarado Vasquez for president.
The micro-parties presumptiously invited Agiiero to join their
front but the conservative leader scoffed at the offer, labeling
Alvarado and his friends “a group of intellectuals, romantics”
without any popular following.
Attacking Agiiero’s plea for OAS supervision, the “united”
front disintegrated in the fall for lack of mass strength. “We are
now willing to let Schick prove himself,” says Alvarado Ramirez
Gonzalez, leader of the pro-Castro Mobilizacion Republicana and
former united front member.
In the eyes of many Nicaraguans, Agiiero’s conservatives
as much as the leftists, the United States is to blame for the
farce of democracy in Nicaragua. Successive U.S. governments
have consistently supported the Somoza dynasty. The U.S.
Marines, at the end of 20-years occupation, installed the old
General Somoza in 1933 as head of the National Guard. The old
General quickly seized control of the country.
Nicaraguans never tire of repeating a wry comment attrib
uted to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in reference to the
first Somoza dictatorship: “He may be an 5.0.b., but at least he’s
our 5.0.b.”
More recently, North Dakota potato farmer Thomas Whelan
served as U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua for 8 years under
President Dwight D. Eisenhower. A close friend of old General
Somoza, Whelan became the brothers’ political mentor, as they
themselves are proud to admit. Whelan frequently called the
pair “my boys.”
Since 1950 the U.S. has spent under Point Four agreements
nearly $9 million for Nicaragua. Informed government sources
in Managua told me that this aid often ended up in the Somozas’
foreign bank accounts. Under the Alliance for Progress, Nica
ragua has received so far some $8 million—supposedly for school
construction, medical equipment, roads, and water supply im
provement.
“But a feudal, dictatorial regime cannot have the advanced
reforms of the Alliance for Progress,” warns Agiiero, who be
lieves that the U.S. program will be “totally inoperative.” The
conservative leader, who is obviously disappointed that the U.S.
Embassy did nol exert more pressure in favor of his plea for
OAS supervision, affirmed that an ideological export of U.S.
democracy would benefit his country far more than the material
exports of U.S. dollars and surpluses.
Nicaraguan opposition leaders, Agiiero as well as Ramirez
Gonzalez and the leftists, criticize the U.S. especially for con
tributing to the strength of the National Guard. The iron fist of
this 5,000-man army-police force is probably the main reason
why all political pressures and revolutions to date have failed.
Only last fall the U.S. sold Somoza four jet planes, supposed
ly for “hemispheric defense against Communism.” But when on
Aviation Day, last Friday, two days before Election Day, Nica
raguans heard those jets scream overhead, they were not re
minded of what the military might do to the Communists (who
collaborate with the government and who condemn active revolu
tionary guerrillas as “adventurers”). Rather, they thought of
what the military might do to the frustrated, angry opposition
should it protest Sunday’s fraudulent elections.
