### BEN TIPTON 
I Stanford's varsity rugby team
I suffered its first loss of the sea
|j son Saturday, a 13-6 defeat at the
I j hands of Universities Club of
I j San Franeisoo. The Indians had
I beaten Universities 11-3 the pre-
I vious Saturday.
Universities, playing without
I star lineout man Bob Chiappone,
l had to rely on a couple of highly
improbable scoring plays and a
(rock-solid defense to provide the
1 margin of victory.
With the score tied at three
j apiece midway in the first half,
-IStanford seemed to he threaten
ing. Clark Weaver took the ball
i from scrum, passing it to first
five-eighths Gordon Waddell. The
ball never got to Waddell, how
ever, as Universities’ light break
shot through for an interception.
He had plenty of support, and
the visitors went some eighty
yards for an easy score. The con
version was automatic, and Uni
versities led, 8-3.
Universities tallied the final
try of tiie period (and of the
game) on another long play with
three minutes to go in the half.
Stanford’s defense seemed to col
lapse, as Universities raced
through the badly out-positioned
Indian backs for the score. Once
again the two-pointer was good,
providing the final 13-6 margin.
Stanford earlier fought back
from the 8-3 deficit. Henry Mac-
Queen scoring down the left side.
Weaver and Waddell both had
key passes in the final scoring
rush. Waddell’s try for the con
version missed.
Universities had opened the
scoring, moving quickly against
a disorganized Stanford defense,
Stanford came right back,
though, and seemed to have the
situation well in hand, as A1 Hil
debrand almost scored. Stopped
momentarily, the Indians sent
Frank Patitucci over from eight
yards out to tie the score.
