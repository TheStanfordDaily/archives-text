# Tuesday Evening Speaker to Explain Statistical Clues to Authorship Puzzle
## 
### WILLIAM REID 
Frederick Mosteller, tonight’s
Tuesday Evening Series speaker,
is a scientist whose field of Sta
tistics stands as a keystone, link
ing the natural sciences to the
humanities and social sciences.

Mosteller’s topic, “The Author
ship of the Disputed Federalist
Papers,” is typical of this synthe
sis for which statistical studies
are striving. In his study, Mostcl

lor attempts to answer a question
which has been baffling histori
ans and literary critics for years,
namely the correct authorship of
the disputed Federalist Papers.
MOSTELLEK has attempted to
find an index by which the
uniqueness of a man’s literary
stylo can be determined. His as
sumption is that a man’s literary
style is as unique to him as his
finger prints. The indices for lit
erary style are such things as
syllables, words, and the length
of sentences.
Mosteller is also famous for
the study ho did for the American
Statistical Society on the Kinsey
Report in which he criticized the
sampling done by Kinsey and his
associates. One of his more mun
dane applications of statistical in
ference is the prediction of the
World Series in baseball.
Probability theory and statisti
cal inference are being applied to
an ever-increasing number of
fields, said Herbert Solomon, ex
ecutive head of the Stanford Sta
tistics Department. The field of
disarmament and inspection is
one example which he gave. If
the disarmament agreement says
that each country will have a spe-

cific amount of time to inspect
the other countries for agree
ment violations, it is a problem
for statisticians to decide how
that time is best spent.

STATISTICIANS must decide
how many and what examples of
each of the basic war industries
should be inspected to give an
accurate picture of the country’s
production. For example, afier
statistical inference is applied to
the sample data about the
amount of steel and chemicals
which has been produced, statis
ticians can determine the gross
amount of production of the
country. If this amount is in ex
cess of the amount needed with
out defense, it can then be as
sumed that the country is not
obeying the disarmament agree
ment. Thus the statistician will
choose the sample which will
load to the most accurate predic
tion.

Solomon also said that political
scientists are using statistical
methods in their analysis. Stalls
j ticians study the patterns and
| groupings of the voting in the
Senate and with this data seek a
more exact answer to such ques
tions as whether or not the clas
sifications of liberal and conser
vative are truly meaningful.

uniqueness of a man’s literary
stylo can be determined. His as
sumption is that a man’s literary
style is as unique to him as his
finger prints. The indices for lit
erary style are such things as
syllables, words, and the length
of sentences.
Mosteller is also famous for
the study ho did for the American
Statistical Society on the Kinsey
Report in which he criticized the
sampling done by Kinsey and his
associates. One of his more mun
dane applications of statistical in
ference is the prediction of the
World Series in baseball.
Probability theory and statisti
cal inference are being applied to
an ever-increasing number of
fields, said Herbert Solomon, ex
ecutive head of the Stanford Sta
tistics Department. The field of
disarmament and inspection is
one example which he gave. If
the disarmament agreement says
that each country will have a spe-

cific amount of time to inspect
the other countries for agree
ment violations, it is a problem
for statisticians to decide how
that time is best spent.

STATISTICIANS must decide
how many and what examples of
each of the basic war industries
should be inspected to give an
accurate picture of the country’s
production. For example, afier
statistical inference is applied to
the sample data about the
amount of steel and chemicals
which has been produced, statis
ticians can determine the gross
amount of production of the
country. If this amount is in ex
cess of the amount needed with
out defense, it can then be as
sumed that the country is not
obeying the disarmament agree
ment. Thus the statistician will
choose the sample which will
load to the most accurate predic
tion.

Solomon also said that political
scientists are using statistical
methods in their analysis. Stalls
j ticians study the patterns and
| groupings of the voting in the
Senate and with this data seek a
more exact answer to such ques
tions as whether or not the clas
sifications of liberal and conser
vative are truly meaningful.
Frederick Mosteller, tonight’s
Tuesday Evening Series speaker,
is a scientist whose field of Sta
tistics stands as a keystone, link
ing the natural sciences to the
humanities and social sciences.

Mosteller’s topic, “The Author
ship of the Disputed Federalist
Papers,” is typical of this synthe
sis for which statistical studies
are striving. In his study, Mostcl

lor attempts to answer a question
which has been baffling histori
ans and literary critics for years,
namely the correct authorship of
the disputed Federalist Papers.
