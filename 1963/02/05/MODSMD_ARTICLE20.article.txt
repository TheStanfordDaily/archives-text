## 
### 
UCLA beat Stanford’s wrestl
ing team, 23-13, in a match held
at Los Angeles on Saturday. The
loss evened the Indians’ season
record at three wins and three
losses.
Stanford stayed fairly close to
the Bruins in the lower weight
classes, losing 10-8 after the first
four matches, but UCLA clinched
the win with victories in the 157,
167, and 177 pound classes.
Tim Davis at 130 pounds, and
Don Buehler, at heavyweight,
won by pins for the Indians, and
Hap Klopp picked up the Tribe’s
other three points with a decision
at 147.
Phil Kendall, unbeaten this
year at 157 pounds, missed Sat
urday’s meet, after suffering a
broken nose Friday in a win
against San Francisco State. He
is expected to be back in a week.
