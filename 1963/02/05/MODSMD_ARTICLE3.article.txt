“THE BIRTH OF A PLAY,” a new display at Tresidder Union traces
the backstage development of the recent Stanford production, "East
Wall, West Wall." The progress of the play from the first rehearsals
to its reception by the critics is illustrated by segments of the
script marked with the director's notes, photographs of rehearsals,
sketches of action in the play, newspaper clippings, and a painting depicting the mood of the story. Notes on the author and
director are also included in the exhibit. "East Wall, West Wall,"
the winner of a contest sponsored by the Stanford Players, was
written by Phillip Grayson and was presented for the first time at
Stanford last fall.
