# Seance Predicts Revolution
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
The launching of two Russian
astronauts on Saturday and the
possibility of an approaching rev
olution in the United States were
two of the revelations made by
Oara, president of the Solar Prae
sidium, to a group of Stanford
students Saturday night. Mr. Rob
ert Short, a member of the Space
craft Research Association, re
layed this information through
his brain wave beam, which put
him into communication with so
lar representatives meeting on
the planet Saturn.
The seance, attended by mem
bers of Rinconada House and
their guests, was preceded by
Short’s detailed explanation of
the foundation of the Spacecraft
Research Association and of the
events that led to his personal
commitment. The association, he
stated, was founded to promote
our understanding of the beings
that are infiltrating our planet
from other worlds, of their ac
tivities here, and of the craft in
which they travel.

“THESE BEINGS,” he affirm
ed, “arc no dumb bunnies.” They
speak all languages, they read
our newspapers and magazines,

they even steal books from our
public libraries. A few of the
more malevolent ones are report
ed to have taken some of our
water.

Only an ultraviolet lamp and a
candle illuminated the room as
Mr. Short prepared to “channel”
information from the solar pre
sidium. A rendition of the Lord’s
prayer precede the seance.

“MONITOR four, calling Cen
tral; monitor four, calling cen
tral,” broke the silence as com
munication began. After switch
ing to vector five, Orum, a judge
on Saturn, began to impart in
formation. The interference on
the transmission was said to ac
count for the suffix “-urn” which
he attached to every word. The
um Russians-um, for example,
launched-um two-um astronauts
um, male-um and female-um, on
um Saturday-um. If the flight
continues to be successful, we are
supposed to hear about it in the
near future.

After a few words from Kor
tan, representative from the plan
et Jupiter, the hour-long seance
came to an end with the benedic
tion of President Oara;
“Peace-um and-um blessings
um to-um your-um planet-urn.”
