# Radio Astronomer Observes Surface of Moon, Says May Have Structure Like Cotton Candy
## 
### 
While the moon may bo made
j of cotton candy or crackerjacks,
| Stanford University’s recent ra
\ dio astronomy observations have
j proved that it is definitely not
j made of green cheese. Dr. David
i Cudaback, a former visiting mem
ber of Stanford’s Radio Astron
omy Institute, posed a theory
I which indicated that the moon’s
I surface could be either filamen
| tary like cotton candy, or foam
: like.
If its structure is foamlike,
j two types are possible. One type
j suggests cracker.jack where the
; foam cells have burst and re
j leased their gas; the other sug
j gests a honeycomb with its cell
j walls intact and still containing
j gas. This highly porous surface
j could have been produced by
j molting from meteor impacts,
j while different velocities of the
j molted material thrown off by
I the impact could account for the
'cotton candy layer.
CUDABACK pointed out that a
surface like one of these would
create additional problems for a
I man attempting to land on the

moon, but such a landing cannot
even be attempted until much
more is learned about the moon’s
surface structure.
Cudaback's observations were
made possible by special manipu
lation of the 32-dish Stanford
Cross radio telescope located on
the Stanford antenna farm. This
telescope, one of many radio-as
tronomical research devices op
erated by the Institute, is laid out
in a cross with arms 375 feet
long. Because of its high resolv
ing power, it has proved extreme
ly useful in the study of sun
spots. solar brightness, and ob
servations of various galactic
sources.
ANOTHER parabolic antenna
used primarily for radar astron
omy. the study of natural radia
tion from (he cosmos, is a new
150-foot dish. Currently Ameri
ca’s largest, this instrument will
be shared by University and In
stitute scientists to measure cos
mic distances, explore the surface
of the moon and planets, deter
mine ionization density and dis
tribution of galactic bodies, and
record data on the amount and
movement of ionized gases and
space debris in interplanetary
space. Its 20- and 60-megacycle
transmitter, requiring a million
watt input, is the most powerful
ever built in its frequency range.


COTTON CANDY MOON or something very like it was seen by Dr. David Cudaback using the 32-dish
Stanford Cross radio telescope to determine that the moon's surface is at least 80 per cent porous to a
depth of several yards.
