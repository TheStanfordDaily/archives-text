# Speaker to Fight Peking U.N. Seat
## 
### 
Richard Pederson, senior po
litical advisor to the U.S. mission
to the United Nations, will speak
on why Red China should not be
admitted to the UN this Wednes
day at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. A Stanford alumnus,
Pederson has served under both
Lodge and Stevenson. The talk is
open to the public, and all Stan
ford United Nations (SUN) mem
bers are expected to attend.
Later in the same evening,
Pederson, who is being sponsored
by SUN, will meet with the Com
munist China Committee in a
special session at 6:45 p.m. at the
Beta Chi house.
Felix Green, author of “China
Awakened," will refute Peder
son’s views on Thursday, Feb. 28,
during the SUN sessions running
from Feb, 27 to March 1. He will
present the case for the admis
sion of Communist China to the
UN, drawing upon experiences
during his two trips to the Chi
nese mainland. Green’s views are
radically different from those of
the U.S. government.
