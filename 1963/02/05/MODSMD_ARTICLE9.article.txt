# Carnegie to Donate $1 Million For New Computation Center
## 
### 
The Carnegie Corporation today announced the award of
$1,050,000 to Stanford for the expansion of the University’s new
Computation Center.

r lhe headquarters building of the multi-million dollar Center
has been named Polya Hall after the famed mathematician and

Stanford emeritus professor, Dr.
George Polya.
Last week Polya received the
Award for Distinguished Service
to Mathematics from the Mathe
matical Association of America.
He was cited for his “brilliant
teaching” and “deep research”
during a career of more than half
a century.

The two-building, 33,000-square
foot Center was designed by ar
chitect Claude Oakland and will
house various computers and
data processing equipment. Chief
among these will be a giant IBM
7090/1401, which will he installed
this week in Pine Hall. To be
added next spring is a Burroughs
85000 which will increase the
data handling capacity of the cen
ter at least 50 times.

ALSO planned for the Center is
a computer-based learning and
teaching laboratory made possi
ble largely by the Carnegie grant.
The five-year grant, one of the
largest ever made by the corpor
ation to an American university,
will be augmented by $350,000 in
matching funds from the Ford
Foundation.
The laboratory will be housed
in an 1800-square-foot addition to
Polya Hall and, according to Pro
fessor Patrick Suppes, director of
the institute for Mathematical
Studies in the Social Sciences,
“will provide a major research
tool for the study of higher learn
ing processes in school-age chil
dren and young adults.”
Electric typewriters, audio and
visual equipment will be used to
communicate between experimen
tal subjects and the computer.
The instantly available summary
of individual progress, Dr. Suppes
explained, will allow researchers
to adjust the program to fit the
student as he goes along, even in
mid-lesson.

THE NEW laboratory is expect
ed to provide insight to a depth
and intensity never before known
into how human beings learn. It
will develop a normative theory
of the learning process and will
shed new light on how individu
als learn language and mathe
matics.

The IBM 7090 will be primarily
used to correlate the data from a
PDP-1 computer in the labora
tory.

Some 20 or 30 hours of pro
gramming in a foreign language
will have been stored in the com
puter’s memory by the time the
laboratory is in operation, so that
five students may work at differ
ent levels of ability at the same
time. When the student has
reached a previously determined
performance level in one pro
gram, the computer feeds him a
new one. Responses to problems
will be recorded by electric type
writers and “light pens” for os
cilloscopes.

Head of the laboratory’s execu
tive committee will be Dr. Sup
pes, aided by Professors Richard
Atkinson of the Department of
Psychology and School of Educa
tion, and William Estes of the
Department of Psychology.
They will work closely with a
Computation Center committee
consisting of Professors George
Forsythe, Wade Cole, and John
McCarthy.

ent levels of ability at the same
time. When the student has
reached a previously determined
performance level in one pro
gram, the computer feeds him a
new one. Responses to problems
will be recorded by electric type
writers and “light pens” for os
cilloscopes.

Head of the laboratory’s execu
tive committee will be Dr. Sup
pes, aided by Professors Richard
Atkinson of the Department of
Psychology and School of Educa
tion, and William Estes of the
Department of Psychology.
They will work closely with a
Computation Center committee
consisting of Professors George
Forsythe, Wade Cole, and John
McCarthy.
The Carnegie Corporation today announced the award of
$1,050,000 to Stanford for the expansion of the University’s new
Computation Center.

r lhe headquarters building of the multi-million dollar Center
has been named Polya Hall after the famed mathematician and

Stanford emeritus professor, Dr.
George Polya.
Last week Polya received the
Award for Distinguished Service
to Mathematics from the Mathe
matical Association of America.
He was cited for his “brilliant
teaching” and “deep research”
during a career of more than half
a century.

The two-building, 33,000-square
foot Center was designed by ar
chitect Claude Oakland and will
house various computers and
data processing equipment. Chief
among these will be a giant IBM
7090/1401, which will he installed
this week in Pine Hall. To be
added next spring is a Burroughs
85000 which will increase the
data handling capacity of the cen
ter at least 50 times.

ALSO planned for the Center is
a computer-based learning and
teaching laboratory made possi
ble largely by the Carnegie grant.
The five-year grant, one of the
largest ever made by the corpor
ation to an American university,
will be augmented by $350,000 in
matching funds from the Ford
Foundation.
The laboratory will be housed
in an 1800-square-foot addition to
Polya Hall and, according to Pro
fessor Patrick Suppes, director of
the institute for Mathematical
Studies in the Social Sciences,
“will provide a major research
tool for the study of higher learn
ing processes in school-age chil
dren and young adults.”
Electric typewriters, audio and
visual equipment will be used to
communicate between experimen
tal subjects and the computer.
The instantly available summary
of individual progress, Dr. Suppes
explained, will allow researchers
to adjust the program to fit the
student as he goes along, even in
mid-lesson.

THE NEW laboratory is expect
ed to provide insight to a depth
and intensity never before known
into how human beings learn. It
will develop a normative theory
of the learning process and will
shed new light on how individu
als learn language and mathe
matics.

The IBM 7090 will be primarily
used to correlate the data from a
PDP-1 computer in the labora
tory.

Some 20 or 30 hours of pro
gramming in a foreign language
will have been stored in the com
puter’s memory by the time the
laboratory is in operation, so that
five students may work at differ
ent levels of ability at the same
time. When the student has
reached a previously determined
performance level in one pro
gram, the computer feeds him a
new one. Responses to problems
