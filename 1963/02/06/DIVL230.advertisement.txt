Still another staple
campus item being
February—s pedalled
at knowing old R A, is
the basic all-cotton
oxford shirt. Take your
choice of the classic
button down or the
new grip tab collar in
white; also blue and
yellow and olive. Now
is the time to augment
your supply at R As
money-saving price of
but 3.99 (usually 5,00).
Save still another buck
by grabbing three for
11.00.—Don't just sit
there—move into
R A,today!
