YOUR EYES CAN BE ON THE STARS
BUT YOUR FEET MUST BE ON THE GROUND
The glamour and excitement of space age programs often obscure a fundamental fact. It is simply
that farsightedness must be coupled with sound, practical, down-to-earth engineering if goals arc
to be attained. This is the philosophy upon which Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's position as a world
leader in flight propulsion systems has been built
Almost four decades of solid engineering achievement at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft can be credited
to management’s conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy progress. In
addition to concentrated research and development efforts on advanced gas turbine and rocket
engines, new and exciting effects arc being explored in every field of aerospace, marine and industrial
power application.
The challenge of the future is indicated by current programs. Presently Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
is exploring the areas of technical knowledge in magnetohydrodynamics . . . thermionic and thermo
electric conversions . . . hypersonic propulsion .. .fuel cells and nuclear power.
If you have interests in common with us, if you look to the future but desire to take a down-to-earth
approach to get there, investigate career opportunities at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.
To help move tomorrow closer to today, we continually seek ambitious young engineers and scientists. Your de
gree? It can be a 8.5., MS. or PhD. in: MECHANICAL • AERONAUTICAL • ELECTRICAL • CHEMICAL and
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING • PHYSICS • CHEMISTRY > METALLURGY • CERAMICS • MATHEMATICS . ENGI
NEERING SCIENCE or APPLIED MECHANICS. The field still broadens. The challenge grows greater. And a future of
recognition and advancement may be here for you.
