# De Gaulle Gives Common Market Policy Narrow-Minded Nationalism'

### RENATA KIEFER ASSU Scholar from Germany 
The beginning of 1962 was a critical time
for the EEC because the Community estab
lished by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 was
entering the second stage of the 12-year trans
ition period. The first balance sheet of the
achievements of the EEC had to be summed
up, and the record for this first stage was one
of success in every respect; in economic, social
and cultural relations. Within certain of these
fields even greater advances than had been
expected were made.

The economic success, probably the one
which is most obvious to non-member countries,
is in paid evidenced by the high common
growth rate of the Community as a whole and
the even greater economic growth of members
with initially weak economies. Externally, the
most convincing evidence of the Community’s
power of attraction is the current negotiations

being held by the EEC with other European
nations concerning the possibilities for their
future membership and the large number of
applications of other states for association.
It is the success of an idea despite indiffer
ence and scepticism—the idea of a final united
Europe. All the organizations established by
the six members move parallel in this respect,
to build up concrete achievements creating a
"de facto” solidarity which will finally lead to
a European Federation . . indispensible to
the preservation of peace.” (Robert Schumann,
May 1950). This aim of political union of all
Europe is implicit in all the treaties of the
Community.
IN ORDER TO make the achieved results a
real value, the Community has to move ahead;
and it will move ahead because, and this is
crucial, the Community has the support of
public opinion in its effort. This movement
cannot be stopped by President De Gaulle’s
lather strange and irresponsible behavior; the
movement can only be retarded.
General De Gaulle’s ideas wore always dif

ferent in several lespects from those of the
representatives of the other member states. Hero
I will only refer to differences in inter-European
affairs.

The EEC is directed towards European inte
gration, but De Gaulle talks about an “associ
ation of sovereign nations” in which decisions
would be subject to the veto of individual gov
ernments. In other words, in crucial cases,
where there is more disagreement than usual,
the particular institution of the Community
would lack a quorum—a problem which the
UN has always had to deal with.
The argument Do Gaulle gives to justify his
attitude in reality speaks against it. He refers
to the “relativity” of all contracts which will
always be subject to misinterpretations. But
this can be effective only if the treaties are
made among countries which are in his sense
“sovereign,” independent, and not deeply con
cerned. As soon as the partners form a close
community, each member is so deeply involved
that treaties have an absolute value.
IT IS THE LACK of a powerful executive

which has always been the vulnerable point of
all the European organizations. The legislature
is usually very capable of issuing beautiful
laws. The judiciary, if it exists at all, renders
judgments beautifully, too. But the executive
is not strong enough to carry through the de
cisions of both bodies. “Recommending” repre
sentatives are sent to the diverse governments,
but the execution of any action depends, to a
large extent, on the individual governments.
Though De Gaulle always showed himself
very content with the Europe of the Six and
not very anxious to have other countries be
come members, he did not try to disturb the
negotiations. But now, after the representatives
of the Six and Great Britain had patiently ne
gotiated for a long period of time to find terms
acceptable for both sides, De Gaulle torpedoed
the results. The “reasons” he mentions are as
threadbare as they are irrelevant. His real
reasons can clearly be found from his own
words. His antiquated conceptions seem to im
ply that all the other European countries would
be willing to form a grand belt of satellites

around a French center.
HIS IMAGINATION in this respect corre
sponds to that of a politician of some former
century. His nationally and hegemonially ori
ented politics do not belong to our time. We are
living in the twentieth century, we are the first
European generation to grow up having hap
pily transcended the stage of nationalistic nar
rowmindedness. We, that moans Europeans
from anywhere in Europe.
There are two vital things the European
nations have in common which strengthen the
process of unification. The first is the sad ex
perience of horrible bloody wars destroying
everything again and again, and the second is
the knowledge that Europe has to assert her
self in order to meet the pressure of the blocs.
We want Europe, and our Europe is not De
Gaulle’s Europe; his is only one part of ours.
This movement towards the integration of
nations with long traditions is unique in his
tory. Our countries cease to be countries of
the past; it is not resurrection, but the building
of something new.

very content with the Europe of the Six and
not very anxious to have other countries be
come members, he did not try to disturb the
negotiations. But now, after the representatives
of the Six and Great Britain had patiently ne
gotiated for a long period of time to find terms
acceptable for both sides, De Gaulle torpedoed
the results. The “reasons” he mentions are as
threadbare as they are irrelevant. His real
reasons can clearly be found from his own
words. His antiquated conceptions seem to im
ply that all the other European countries would
be willing to form a grand belt of satellites

around a French center.
HIS IMAGINATION in this respect corre
sponds to that of a politician of some former
century. His nationally and hegemonially ori
ented politics do not belong to our time. We are
living in the twentieth century, we are the first
European generation to grow up having hap
pily transcended the stage of nationalistic nar
rowmindedness. We, that moans Europeans
from anywhere in Europe.
There are two vital things the European
nations have in common which strengthen the
process of unification. The first is the sad ex
perience of horrible bloody wars destroying
everything again and again, and the second is
the knowledge that Europe has to assert her
self in order to meet the pressure of the blocs.
We want Europe, and our Europe is not De
Gaulle’s Europe; his is only one part of ours.
This movement towards the integration of
nations with long traditions is unique in his
tory. Our countries cease to be countries of
the past; it is not resurrection, but the building
of something new.
The beginning of 1962 was a critical time
for the EEC because the Community estab
lished by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 was
entering the second stage of the 12-year trans
ition period. The first balance sheet of the
achievements of the EEC had to be summed
up, and the record for this first stage was one
of success in every respect; in economic, social
and cultural relations. Within certain of these
fields even greater advances than had been
expected were made.

The economic success, probably the one
which is most obvious to non-member countries,
is in paid evidenced by the high common
growth rate of the Community as a whole and
the even greater economic growth of members
with initially weak economies. Externally, the
most convincing evidence of the Community’s
power of attraction is the current negotiations

being held by the EEC with other European
nations concerning the possibilities for their
future membership and the large number of
applications of other states for association.
It is the success of an idea despite indiffer
ence and scepticism—the idea of a final united
Europe. All the organizations established by
the six members move parallel in this respect,
to build up concrete achievements creating a
"de facto” solidarity which will finally lead to
a European Federation . . indispensible to
the preservation of peace.” (Robert Schumann,
May 1950). This aim of political union of all
Europe is implicit in all the treaties of the
Community.
IN ORDER TO make the achieved results a
real value, the Community has to move ahead;
and it will move ahead because, and this is
crucial, the Community has the support of
public opinion in its effort. This movement
cannot be stopped by President De Gaulle’s
lather strange and irresponsible behavior; the
movement can only be retarded.
General De Gaulle’s ideas wore always dif

ferent in several lespects from those of the
representatives of the other member states. Hero
I will only refer to differences in inter-European
affairs.

The EEC is directed towards European inte
gration, but De Gaulle talks about an “associ
ation of sovereign nations” in which decisions
would be subject to the veto of individual gov
ernments. In other words, in crucial cases,
where there is more disagreement than usual,
the particular institution of the Community
would lack a quorum—a problem which the
UN has always had to deal with.
The argument Do Gaulle gives to justify his
attitude in reality speaks against it. He refers
to the “relativity” of all contracts which will
always be subject to misinterpretations. But
this can be effective only if the treaties are
made among countries which are in his sense
“sovereign,” independent, and not deeply con
cerned. As soon as the partners form a close
community, each member is so deeply involved
that treaties have an absolute value.
IT IS THE LACK of a powerful executive

which has always been the vulnerable point of
all the European organizations. The legislature
is usually very capable of issuing beautiful
laws. The judiciary, if it exists at all, renders
judgments beautifully, too. But the executive
is not strong enough to carry through the de
cisions of both bodies. “Recommending” repre
sentatives are sent to the diverse governments,
but the execution of any action depends, to a
large extent, on the individual governments.

General De Gaulle’s ideas wore always dif

ferent in several lespects from those of the
representatives of the other member states. Hero
I will only refer to differences in inter-European
affairs.

The EEC is directed towards European inte
gration, but De Gaulle talks about an “associ
ation of sovereign nations” in which decisions
would be subject to the veto of individual gov
ernments. In other words, in crucial cases,
where there is more disagreement than usual,
the particular institution of the Community
would lack a quorum—a problem which the
UN has always had to deal with.
The argument Do Gaulle gives to justify his
attitude in reality speaks against it. He refers
to the “relativity” of all contracts which will
always be subject to misinterpretations. But
this can be effective only if the treaties are
made among countries which are in his sense
“sovereign,” independent, and not deeply con
cerned. As soon as the partners form a close
community, each member is so deeply involved
that treaties have an absolute value.
IT IS THE LACK of a powerful executive

which has always been the vulnerable point of
all the European organizations. The legislature
is usually very capable of issuing beautiful
laws. The judiciary, if it exists at all, renders
judgments beautifully, too. But the executive
is not strong enough to carry through the de
cisions of both bodies. “Recommending” repre
sentatives are sent to the diverse governments,
but the execution of any action depends, to a
large extent, on the individual governments.
Though De Gaulle always showed himself
very content with the Europe of the Six and
not very anxious to have other countries be
come members, he did not try to disturb the
negotiations. But now, after the representatives
of the Six and Great Britain had patiently ne
gotiated for a long period of time to find terms
acceptable for both sides, De Gaulle torpedoed
the results. The “reasons” he mentions are as
threadbare as they are irrelevant. His real
reasons can clearly be found from his own
words. His antiquated conceptions seem to im
ply that all the other European countries would
be willing to form a grand belt of satellites

around a French center.
HIS IMAGINATION in this respect corre
sponds to that of a politician of some former
century. His nationally and hegemonially ori
ented politics do not belong to our time. We are
living in the twentieth century, we are the first
European generation to grow up having hap
pily transcended the stage of nationalistic nar
rowmindedness. We, that moans Europeans
from anywhere in Europe.
There are two vital things the European
nations have in common which strengthen the
process of unification. The first is the sad ex
perience of horrible bloody wars destroying
everything again and again, and the second is
the knowledge that Europe has to assert her
self in order to meet the pressure of the blocs.
We want Europe, and our Europe is not De
Gaulle’s Europe; his is only one part of ours.
This movement towards the integration of
nations with long traditions is unique in his
tory. Our countries cease to be countries of
the past; it is not resurrection, but the building
of something new.
The beginning of 1962 was a critical time
for the EEC because the Community estab
lished by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 was
entering the second stage of the 12-year trans
ition period. The first balance sheet of the
achievements of the EEC had to be summed
up, and the record for this first stage was one
of success in every respect; in economic, social
and cultural relations. Within certain of these
fields even greater advances than had been
expected were made.

The economic success, probably the one
which is most obvious to non-member countries,
is in paid evidenced by the high common
growth rate of the Community as a whole and
the even greater economic growth of members
with initially weak economies. Externally, the
most convincing evidence of the Community’s
power of attraction is the current negotiations

being held by the EEC with other European
nations concerning the possibilities for their
future membership and the large number of
applications of other states for association.
It is the success of an idea despite indiffer
ence and scepticism—the idea of a final united
Europe. All the organizations established by
the six members move parallel in this respect,
to build up concrete achievements creating a
"de facto” solidarity which will finally lead to
a European Federation . . indispensible to
the preservation of peace.” (Robert Schumann,
May 1950). This aim of political union of all
Europe is implicit in all the treaties of the
Community.
IN ORDER TO make the achieved results a
real value, the Community has to move ahead;
and it will move ahead because, and this is
crucial, the Community has the support of
public opinion in its effort. This movement
cannot be stopped by President De Gaulle’s
lather strange and irresponsible behavior; the
movement can only be retarded.
