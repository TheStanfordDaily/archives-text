## 
### 
“20th Century Drawings,” a
collection circulated by the Mu
seum of Modern Art. and spon
sored by the Columbia Broad
casting System, will be on exhibit
in the Art Gallery through Feb.
10. A collection of contemporary
Russian prints from The Associ
ation of Societies for Cultural
Relations with Foreign Countries
in Moscow is also on display.
The arrangement of the draw
ings in the gallery illustrates the
development of Expressionism,
Cubism, and Surrealism.
Among the Expressionists rep
resented is George Gross who
greatly influenced later German
Expressionism. The simplicity of
“Nude with Violet Stockings,” by
a relatively unknown artist Egon
Schiele makes it one of the most
popular drawings in the collec
tions. This drawing has received
excellent reviews in other shows.
The seven drawings of Paul
Klee, another Expressionist, have
a delicate, lyrical quality. One
drawing in the group, done by
the artist in the last year of his
life, still maintains the delicate
style of his other works, although
Klee drew it with a large brush
strapped to his hand.
Cubism’s development is also
shown by a collection of drawings
which range from those of the
early French Cubists, Modigliani

i ami Matisse, to works of the ah-
I stract expressionists, Levee, Cice
\ ro, and Dubuffet.
| Works from the Surrealist
school include two drawings by
j Salvador Dali both entitled, “The
j Cavalier of Death.” One of the
■ drawings is an example of Dali's
experimentation with the princi
i pie of the double image. The pen
| cil drawing, “Beggar Woman” by
| Peter Blume, an American sur
| realist, has such fine technique
i that it seems like a photograph.
Works of artists who fall into
. no particular school arc also in
j eluded in the collection. Their
styles range from representation
al to abstract. One series of four
| drawings by Morris Graves is a
j satirical commentary on the Mu-
I nich Conference. Each drawing
is of a chair and represents one
of the nations Franco, Germany,
i Great Britain, and Italy which
participated in the conference,
j The collection of Russian prints
j is in the words of Harold Clicks
j man, Exhibition Assistant of the
Gallery, "academic.” The tech
j niques used color lithograph,
woodcut, and etching -are oxcel
j lent, but the subjects are still
| life, Russian life, or social com
j mentary. The prints present a
I striking contrast to the imagina
tive works in the “20th Century
I Drawings” collection.

Expressionism. The simplicity of
“Nude with Violet Stockings,” by

excellent reviews in other shows.
The seven drawings of Paul
Klee, another Expressionist, have
a delicate, lyrical quality. One
drawing in the group, done by
the artist in the last year of his
life, still maintains the delicate
style of his other works, although
Klee drew it with a large brush
strapped to his hand.
Cubism’s development is also
shown by a collection of drawings
which range from those of the
early French Cubists, Modigliani

i ami Matisse, to works of the ah-
I stract expressionists, Levee, Cice
\ ro, and Dubuffet.
| Works from the Surrealist
school include two drawings by
j Salvador Dali both entitled, “The
j Cavalier of Death.” One of the
■ drawings is an example of Dali's
experimentation with the princi
i pie of the double image. The pen

| Peter Blume, an American sur
| realist, has such fine technique
i that it seems like a photograph.
Works of artists who fall into

j eluded in the collection. Their
styles range from representation
al to abstract. One series of four

participated in the conference,
