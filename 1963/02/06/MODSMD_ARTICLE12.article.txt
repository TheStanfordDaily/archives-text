## Economic Consequences of De Gaulle 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Speaking of fhe final rejection at Brussels of the British
application to join the Common Market, the Times of London
says that “The immediate task” for Britain “is to put her own
house in order” and then concludes by saying that “Only radical
measures will do now.”
If we ask ourselves what kind of radical measures, wo are
bound, I am afraid, to answer that, in excluding Britain from
Europe and seeking to expel the United States, General De
Gaulle is pushing the Western world away from liberalism and
ever more deeply into protection, regimentation and government
planning. If the British now take radical measures to earn their
living, they will almost certainly have to face the prospect of
freezing wages, compulsory arbitration, planned and directed
capital investment and the regulation of private profits.
Seen in its historical perspective, Macmillan’s decision to
apply for membership in the European Economic Community
and Kennedy’s proposal for a transatlantic low-tariff trade
partnership were joint and parallel efforts to set the Western
world on a liberal course.
I would say in parenthesis that I am using the word “lib
eral” in its true and historical meaning and not in the perverted
meaning given to it by the early New Dealers and the latter-day
right-wing conservatives. A liberal economy is one in which the
preponderant mass of economic transactions are made in free
markets and not by decree of the central government.
Britain wanted the opportunity to sell in the big European
market, and it wanted to be stimulated by the competition which
industry in the United Kingdom would face as part of a bigger
market. The United States has wanted a wider and freer world
mai’ket in which, as industry expanded, prosperity would be
more and more widely diffused. This is the liberal economic
design which the general has shattered.
In doing this, he dealt not only with the British membership
and the American partnership. He dealt also with the internal
condition of the Common Market itself.
There is no more significant passage in the General’s press
conference of January 14 than the one in which he told the
world and also the other five members what kind of economy
they were going to live in. I quote the crucial paragraph in full.
It will be much discussed in the days to come,
“The system of the six consists of making a pool of the
agricultural products of the entire community, of strictly
determining their prices, of forbidding subsidizing, of or
ganizing their consumption between all members and of
making it obligatory for each of these members to pay the
community any savings they might make by having food
stuffs brought in from outside instead of consuming those
offered by the Common Market.”
This says that the Common Market is to be a closed agri
cultural system in which French foodstuffs, particularly wheat
and feed grains, are to have a monopoly at an arbitrarily high
price. The other five members cannot obtain cheap foodstuffs
from the Western Hemisphere. For although these are produced
and sold at far lower cost, the so-called variable levy brings
their purchase price in Europe up to the high price of European
feed and grain. This is meant to be a prohibitive penalty.
The radical measures which the General will compel Britain
to take, and it may be in some lesser degree the United States
as well, are not at odds with his own philosophy. The system
was established before he took office in 1958, but under General
Do Gaulle, France has become, by American and even British
standards, a planned and directed economy. The General im
posed a wage freeze when he first took office. That is now
lifted, but France has planned capital investment to modernize
and expand basic industry. The government enforces the plan
which is drawn up by consultation with industry, labor and agri
culture, because it has—according to an estimate used by Mr.
Dan Corditz, the Paris correspondent of the Wall Street Journal
—under government control more than half of all investment
funds through ownership of banks, large insurance companies
and the like.
Whether the French system will run into trouble as wages
and prices rise is for the future. At present, the French system
is performing so brilliantly that the General has nothing to
worry about at home. Moreover, he can afford to spend a lot of
money on his nuclear weapons knowing that this spending will
stimulate the French economy if it begins to slow down.
