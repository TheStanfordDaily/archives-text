# STAFF OPINION
## Partisan Politics on Campus 
### MICHAEL SAKS 
(Editor’s note: This is the first of a three-part, series on
partisan polities on the Stanford campus.)
To (he casual observer, Stanford has a well-ordered political
atmosphere. Lillie does this person realize that there are oppos
ing views on Stanford’s policies that run deep, all the way back
to tlie Founding Grant; differences that are based upon theories
of education and question of semantic interpretation.
Whenever a discussion starts on partisan politics on campus,
reference is inevitably made to the Founding Grant. The Grant
states: “The University must be forever maintained upon a
strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian basis. It must never be
come an instrument in the hands of any political party, of any
sect or organization . . .” Going a step farther, the Trustees
have established a rule stating that “None of the halls, buildings,
or grounds of the University shall be used for political or par
tisan addresses or gatherings.”
The last part of this ruling has been modified by the exist
ence of the Political Union. Before its establishment in 1953,
there were no political speakers on campus at all. Tuesday Eve
ning Series speakers were limited to such topics as “Bird Mi
grations in Antarctica.” The Political Union now is in charge of
bringing political programs to the campus, doing its best to give
equal time to opposing viewpoints.
What does partisan mean? The fact is (hat its definition in
a dictionary and its definition on campus by the Administration
are two different things; and that’s where the clash of opinions
lies.
Jim Woolsey, executive assistant to Armin Rosencranz, stu
dent body president, believes that the dictionary definition of
partisan should apply to campus policy. Webster defines partisan
as: “adherent to a party or faction, especially unreasoningly.”
Fred Glover, executive assistant to President Sterling, sees
the word partisan in a different light. He hesitated to give a
definition but said that, in general, partisan means advocacy of
a point of view on social and political issues.
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Students, defined partisan as:
“The policy of the University that the name of Stanford should
not be exploited in support of any particular political or social
cause and that the University should not be identified with the
advocacy of any particular philosophy, point of view or action on
political and social issues, except where necessary on the Uni
versity’s own initiative, to protect its institutional interests and
discharge its educational obligations."
Elaborating on the last part of the statement, Winbigler
explained that the University will take a stand on issues vital to
its life, such as the Ladera Dam project. But it would not come
out with a position on building dams on the Colorado River. In
another example, he pointed out that the University has made
its position clear on discrimination in fraternities because this,
too, is fundamentally a part of University life.
It is one thing to state a position, but it is another thing to
apply it. Ail that can be said is that there are no hard and fast
rules.
Certain letters on file in the University help to illustrate the
complexity of interpreting the position. Glover wrote to Dean
Robert H. Alway of the Medical School on May 25, 1962: “The
dividing line between what is partisan activity and what is not,
is, of course, a fine one. To our mind, it revolves around whether
a matter is being discussed in an educational setting or whether
the primary purpose is political action which uses the Stanford
name for prestige.” *

Dr. Sterling wrote to John Steinbruner, Head Wilbur Spon
sor, on September 11, 1962: “Individual political action which
does not involve the University’s name is to be encouraged as a
citizen’s normal right. Partisan political action by individuals or
groups of individuals which does involve the University’s name
is contrary to the Founding Grant.”
This brings up the question as to what does constitute
“using the Stanford name for prestige”? According to Dean
Winbigler, allowing a partisan political groups to meet on cam
pus (i.e. using University property) would be giving University
sanction to the group. Because the Founding Grant states that
the University must be maintained on a non-partisan basis, such
meetings of groups on campus are prohibited.
Dr. Robert Wert, Vice Provost, stated that the key to the
problem of partisan politics on campus is whether or not the
political action is organized. He said that any individual can get
up in the Student Union and say anything he wants; “the basic
prblem is to make it impossible to make the name of the Uni
versity identified with organized political activity.”

the word partisan in a different light. He hesitated to give a
definition but said that, in general, partisan means advocacy of
a point of view on social and political issues.
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Students, defined partisan as:
“The policy of the University that the name of Stanford should
not be exploited in support of any particular political or social
cause and that the University should not be identified with the
advocacy of any particular philosophy, point of view or action on
political and social issues, except where necessary on the Uni
versity’s own initiative, to protect its institutional interests and
discharge its educational obligations."
Elaborating on the last part of the statement, Winbigler
explained that the University will take a stand on issues vital to
its life, such as the Ladera Dam project. But it would not come
out with a position on building dams on the Colorado River. In
another example, he pointed out that the University has made
its position clear on discrimination in fraternities because this,
too, is fundamentally a part of University life.
It is one thing to state a position, but it is another thing to
apply it. Ail that can be said is that there are no hard and fast
rules.
Certain letters on file in the University help to illustrate the
complexity of interpreting the position. Glover wrote to Dean
Robert H. Alway of the Medical School on May 25, 1962: “The
dividing line between what is partisan activity and what is not,
is, of course, a fine one. To our mind, it revolves around whether
a matter is being discussed in an educational setting or whether
the primary purpose is political action which uses the Stanford
name for prestige.” *

Dr. Sterling wrote to John Steinbruner, Head Wilbur Spon
sor, on September 11, 1962: “Individual political action which
does not involve the University’s name is to be encouraged as a
citizen’s normal right. Partisan political action by individuals or
groups of individuals which does involve the University’s name
is contrary to the Founding Grant.”
This brings up the question as to what does constitute
“using the Stanford name for prestige”? According to Dean
Winbigler, allowing a partisan political groups to meet on cam
pus (i.e. using University property) would be giving University
sanction to the group. Because the Founding Grant states that
the University must be maintained on a non-partisan basis, such
meetings of groups on campus are prohibited.
Dr. Robert Wert, Vice Provost, stated that the key to the
problem of partisan politics on campus is whether or not the
political action is organized. He said that any individual can get
up in the Student Union and say anything he wants; “the basic
prblem is to make it impossible to make the name of the Uni
versity identified with organized political activity.”
(Editor’s note: This is the first of a three-part, series on
partisan polities on the Stanford campus.)
To (he casual observer, Stanford has a well-ordered political
atmosphere. Lillie does this person realize that there are oppos
ing views on Stanford’s policies that run deep, all the way back
to tlie Founding Grant; differences that are based upon theories
of education and question of semantic interpretation.
Whenever a discussion starts on partisan politics on campus,
reference is inevitably made to the Founding Grant. The Grant
states: “The University must be forever maintained upon a
strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian basis. It must never be
come an instrument in the hands of any political party, of any
sect or organization . . .” Going a step farther, the Trustees
have established a rule stating that “None of the halls, buildings,
or grounds of the University shall be used for political or par
tisan addresses or gatherings.”
The last part of this ruling has been modified by the exist
ence of the Political Union. Before its establishment in 1953,
there were no political speakers on campus at all. Tuesday Eve
ning Series speakers were limited to such topics as “Bird Mi
grations in Antarctica.” The Political Union now is in charge of
bringing political programs to the campus, doing its best to give
equal time to opposing viewpoints.
What does partisan mean? The fact is (hat its definition in

partisan should apply to campus policy. Webster defines partisan
as: “adherent to a party or faction, especially unreasoningly.”

sor, on September 11, 1962: “Individual political action which
does not involve the University’s name is to be encouraged as a
citizen’s normal right. Partisan political action by individuals or
groups of individuals which does involve the University’s name
is contrary to the Founding Grant.”
This brings up the question as to what does constitute
“using the Stanford name for prestige”? According to Dean
Winbigler, allowing a partisan political groups to meet on cam
pus (i.e. using University property) would be giving University
sanction to the group. Because the Founding Grant states that
the University must be maintained on a non-partisan basis, such
meetings of groups on campus are prohibited.
Dr. Robert Wert, Vice Provost, stated that the key to the
problem of partisan politics on campus is whether or not the
political action is organized. He said that any individual can get
up in the Student Union and say anything he wants; “the basic
prblem is to make it impossible to make the name of the Uni
versity identified with organized political activity.”
(Editor’s note: This is the first of a three-part, series on
partisan polities on the Stanford campus.)
To (he casual observer, Stanford has a well-ordered political
atmosphere. Lillie does this person realize that there are oppos
ing views on Stanford’s policies that run deep, all the way back
to tlie Founding Grant; differences that are based upon theories
of education and question of semantic interpretation.
Whenever a discussion starts on partisan politics on campus,
reference is inevitably made to the Founding Grant. The Grant
states: “The University must be forever maintained upon a
strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian basis. It must never be
come an instrument in the hands of any political party, of any
sect or organization . . .” Going a step farther, the Trustees
have established a rule stating that “None of the halls, buildings,
or grounds of the University shall be used for political or par
tisan addresses or gatherings.”
The last part of this ruling has been modified by the exist
ence of the Political Union. Before its establishment in 1953,
there were no political speakers on campus at all. Tuesday Eve
ning Series speakers were limited to such topics as “Bird Mi
grations in Antarctica.” The Political Union now is in charge of
bringing political programs to the campus, doing its best to give
equal time to opposing viewpoints.
What does partisan mean? The fact is (hat its definition in
a dictionary and its definition on campus by the Administration
are two different things; and that’s where the clash of opinions
lies.
Jim Woolsey, executive assistant to Armin Rosencranz, stu
dent body president, believes that the dictionary definition of
partisan should apply to campus policy. Webster defines partisan
as: “adherent to a party or faction, especially unreasoningly.”
Fred Glover, executive assistant to President Sterling, sees
the word partisan in a different light. He hesitated to give a
definition but said that, in general, partisan means advocacy of
a point of view on social and political issues.
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Students, defined partisan as:
“The policy of the University that the name of Stanford should
not be exploited in support of any particular political or social
cause and that the University should not be identified with the
advocacy of any particular philosophy, point of view or action on
political and social issues, except where necessary on the Uni
versity’s own initiative, to protect its institutional interests and
discharge its educational obligations."
Elaborating on the last part of the statement, Winbigler
explained that the University will take a stand on issues vital to
its life, such as the Ladera Dam project. But it would not come
out with a position on building dams on the Colorado River. In
another example, he pointed out that the University has made
its position clear on discrimination in fraternities because this,
too, is fundamentally a part of University life.
It is one thing to state a position, but it is another thing to
apply it. Ail that can be said is that there are no hard and fast
rules.
Certain letters on file in the University help to illustrate the
complexity of interpreting the position. Glover wrote to Dean
Robert H. Alway of the Medical School on May 25, 1962: “The
dividing line between what is partisan activity and what is not,
is, of course, a fine one. To our mind, it revolves around whether
a matter is being discussed in an educational setting or whether
the primary purpose is political action which uses the Stanford
name for prestige.” *

Dr. Sterling wrote to John Steinbruner, Head Wilbur Spon
sor, on September 11, 1962: “Individual political action which
does not involve the University’s name is to be encouraged as a
citizen’s normal right. Partisan political action by individuals or
groups of individuals which does involve the University’s name
is contrary to the Founding Grant.”
This brings up the question as to what does constitute
“using the Stanford name for prestige”? According to Dean
Winbigler, allowing a partisan political groups to meet on cam
pus (i.e. using University property) would be giving University
sanction to the group. Because the Founding Grant states that
