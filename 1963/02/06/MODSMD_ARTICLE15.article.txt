Editors, The Daily:
During fall quarter the Committee on Student Services and
Affairs discussed the problems arising in and from overnight
parties, and made a number of recommendations for the conduct
of such parties. The recommendations were almost all adopted
by LASSU and formed the basis on which plans for Big Game
overnight parties were approved or disapproved by LASSU.
Reports on the conduct of Big Game parties have been collected,
and it may be of interest to members of the University to know
the results of the policy changes instituted by LASSU.
Questionnaires were sent out to adult guests who attended
the parties. Reports were obtained;from about two thirds-of all
the adult guests, and reports were obtained from at least one
adult guest at all except two of the overnight parties. Many of
the adult guests reported that the facilities and planned enter
tainment were excellent, and many of them (67 out of the 72
who returned answers to the questionnaire) indicated that the
overnight parties were sufficiently attractive and pleasant that
they would be willing to attend Big Game overnight parties in
the future.
Six of the adult guests rated the advance planning or the
execution as poor, and five adult guests reported that the room
facilities were fair or poor. Places on which adverse reports on
facilities were received have been removed from the list of
ASSU approved accommodations. Comments from some adult
guests suggest that in a few cases managers of motels tried to
make profits at student expense by serving poor food.
The general conclusion to be drawn from these reports is that,
the standard of conduct at this year’s Big Game overnight
parties was quite generally high, and it should be noted that no
cases involving disciplinary aciton have arisen from incidents
at any of the parties. Improved standards of behavior at these
parties can be directly traced, it seems to me, to the increased
student responsibility for careful planning of parties which the
new policies require, and LASSU is to be commended for adopt
ing and putting into effect the regulations which appear to have
brought about the marked improvement in standards.

Editors, The Daily:
According to the editorial in Monday’s Daily, we should not
deliberately contravene a rule or law until we have exhausted
all possible legitimate means to change it, even when the rule
is so stupid as is the university limitation on public pronounce
ments by campus organizations.
When a law is so clearly unreasonable that it doesn’t merit
general enforcement, its effect is precisely contrary to the main
tenance of justice and order. For it becomes, in effect, a tool of
the administration to selectively suppress actions which it finds
distasteful to it—not distastful to the spirit of the particular law
which would stupidly find all prohibited actions distastful, but
inconvenient to some other momentary interests or supposed
interests of the administration. Flagrant contravention of such
a law is therefore more in keeping with the maintenance of
legal order than is submission to it.

Dear President Wallace Sterling:
We read with concern the reports appearing in the Palo Alto
Times concerning the University’s ban against student organiza
tions taking stands on public issues. The ban appears not only
inconsistent with the duty of a university to encourage students
to care deeply about fundamental public issues, hut clearly in
compatible with Stanford’s proud motto “Let the Winds of Free
dom Blow.” As Stanford alumni we urge the administration to
formulate a policy allowing the student groups greater freedom
to express themselves publicly on matters of national concern.
