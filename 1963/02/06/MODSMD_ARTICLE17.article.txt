# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## Baseballers Open Season February 19 Against USF 
### Glenn Alford 
In the years Dutch Fob ring has coached baseball at Stanford
his teams have never lost more games than they have won in a
season. On the other side of the coin, his teams have never won a
California Intercollegiate Baseball Association championship. This
year’s squad has an excellent chance to do either one.
The Baseball team opens the 1963 season on Feb. 19 against Ihe
USF Dons on Sunken Diamond.
Feliring has an outfit boasting the best front-line pitching in
the CIBA. The problems facing Feliring, and they are big ones, are
finding a catcher, third baseman and second baseman from a group
of hard-working and willing but inexperienced youngsters.
Catcher poses the biggest problem. Jim Seckler, who caught
for the Braves (JVt last year, has the inside track. Buzz Riegel, first

stringer on last year’s frosh, is
Seckler’s top competition. He is
outstanding on defense, but at
present Fehring feels it is more
important to have Seckler’s
stronger batting in the lineup.
Bob Wall and Chuck French are
other candidates.
A number of youngsters are
contenders for the two trouble
some infield positions. Gary
Smith, Rich Berra and Dan Cona
way are among (he possibilities.
THE FRONT line pitching is
the team’s strength. Darrell Suth
erland and Jim Lonborg are two
of the best starters anywhere in
collegiate ball. Sutherland has
had pro offers despite his never
having an outstanding won-loss
record at Stanford. He was 5-5
with a 2.78 earned run average
in 1962. For two years he’s lost
games that he might have won

had he received minimum hitting and fielding support. A crackling
curve and a live fastball enabled him to pile up 20-% consecutive
scoreless innings in 1962. Lonborg has had trouble controlling his
curve, but, if anything, he has a swifter fast ball than Sutherland.
He was 3-3 with a 2.88 E.R.A.

Newell Can Also Pitch
There are other pitchers on the Stanford roster who are good,
though not in Sutherland and Lonborg’s class. Warren Newell, who
was named to the All-CIBA outfield last year, also did a fair amount
of pitching for the Cards. He had a 2-0 mark and a 2.61 E.R.A.
Others around are John LeCompte (3-0, 2.86), Pete Dixon (1-0, 2.08),
Bob Berry, and Jack Wood, all from last year’s varsity and junior
varsity. Rich Brear is up from the frosh.
Other- Stanford strong-points are shortstop, first base, and the
outfield.
Joel Shulmau is the shortstop and he is a good one. Though he
had a bad fielding year in 1962 he showed unexpected power, leading
the team in doubles and homers, and finishing second in runs
batter! in.
Bob Hollman is the starting first baseman, though Jim Chenu
and Bobby Cox may also play there when they aren’t in the outfield.
Hollman is a good glove man and his bat started Stanford off on a
nine-game win streak last year.
The Starting Outfield
Stanford’s starting outfield will probably consist of Cox, Greg
Post and Warren Newell. Cox is up from the Frosh, where he was
the team’s leading hitter and best all-around player. Post started in
center-field in 1962, batted .258, and led the team in runs scored. He
is also a good base runner. Newell didn’t start a game for Stanford
’til the season was well along, but he finished with a lusty .333
average. He was the only Car’d to be honored by the all-conference
selectors. Chenu has played both first base and the outfield at Stan
ford. He hit .267 in 1962.
THE 1963 VERSION of the Stanford baseball team will be a swift
one, and in the cavernous Sunken Diomand this is important. A
swift outfield such as Newell, Post and Cox should be able to hold
opposition hits to a minimum number of bases. When this is coupled
with the pitching of Sutherland and Lonborg, Stanford’s oppositoin
shouldn't score too many runs.
However, you have to score runs of your own to win, and this
has been an almost traditional Stanford weakness. Fehring hopes
that an early start and constant practice with a pitching machine
will cure that impotence. If it does, Stanford will be surprisingly
strong. If it doesn’t, Stanford will be not so surprisingly weak.

USF Dons on Sunken Diamond.
Feliring has an outfit boasting the best front-line pitching in
the CIBA. The problems facing Feliring, and they are big ones, are
finding a catcher, third baseman and second baseman from a group
of hard-working and willing but inexperienced youngsters.
Catcher poses the biggest problem. Jim Seckler, who caught
for the Braves (JVt last year, has the inside track. Buzz Riegel, first

stringer on last year’s frosh, is
Seckler’s top competition. He is
outstanding on defense, but at
present Fehring feels it is more
important to have Seckler’s
stronger batting in the lineup.
Bob Wall and Chuck French are
other candidates.
A number of youngsters are
contenders for the two trouble
some infield positions. Gary
Smith, Rich Berra and Dan Cona
way are among (he possibilities.
THE FRONT line pitching is
the team’s strength. Darrell Suth
erland and Jim Lonborg are two
of the best starters anywhere in
collegiate ball. Sutherland has
had pro offers despite his never
having an outstanding won-loss
record at Stanford. He was 5-5
with a 2.78 earned run average
in 1962. For two years he’s lost
games that he might have won

had he received minimum hitting and fielding support. A crackling
curve and a live fastball enabled him to pile up 20-% consecutive
scoreless innings in 1962. Lonborg has had trouble controlling his
curve, but, if anything, he has a swifter fast ball than Sutherland.
He was 3-3 with a 2.88 E.R.A.

Newell Can Also Pitch
There are other pitchers on the Stanford roster who are good,
though not in Sutherland and Lonborg’s class. Warren Newell, who
was named to the All-CIBA outfield last year, also did a fair amount
of pitching for the Cards. He had a 2-0 mark and a 2.61 E.R.A.
Others around are John LeCompte (3-0, 2.86), Pete Dixon (1-0, 2.08),
Bob Berry, and Jack Wood, all from last year’s varsity and junior
varsity. Rich Brear is up from the frosh.
Other- Stanford strong-points are shortstop, first base, and the
outfield.
Joel Shulmau is the shortstop and he is a good one. Though he
had a bad fielding year in 1962 he showed unexpected power, leading
the team in doubles and homers, and finishing second in runs
batter! in.
Bob Hollman is the starting first baseman, though Jim Chenu
and Bobby Cox may also play there when they aren’t in the outfield.
Hollman is a good glove man and his bat started Stanford off on a
nine-game win streak last year.
The Starting Outfield
Stanford’s starting outfield will probably consist of Cox, Greg
Post and Warren Newell. Cox is up from the Frosh, where he was
the team’s leading hitter and best all-around player. Post started in
center-field in 1962, batted .258, and led the team in runs scored. He
is also a good base runner. Newell didn’t start a game for Stanford
’til the season was well along, but he finished with a lusty .333
average. He was the only Car’d to be honored by the all-conference
selectors. Chenu has played both first base and the outfield at Stan
ford. He hit .267 in 1962.
THE 1963 VERSION of the Stanford baseball team will be a swift
one, and in the cavernous Sunken Diomand this is important. A
swift outfield such as Newell, Post and Cox should be able to hold
opposition hits to a minimum number of bases. When this is coupled
with the pitching of Sutherland and Lonborg, Stanford’s oppositoin
shouldn't score too many runs.
However, you have to score runs of your own to win, and this
has been an almost traditional Stanford weakness. Fehring hopes
that an early start and constant practice with a pitching machine
will cure that impotence. If it does, Stanford will be surprisingly
strong. If it doesn’t, Stanford will be not so surprisingly weak.

for the Braves (JVt last year, has the inside track. Buzz Riegel, first

stringer on last year’s frosh, is
Seckler’s top competition. He is
outstanding on defense, but at
present Fehring feels it is more
important to have Seckler’s
stronger batting in the lineup.
Bob Wall and Chuck French are
other candidates.
A number of youngsters are
contenders for the two trouble
some infield positions. Gary
Smith, Rich Berra and Dan Cona
way are among (he possibilities.
THE FRONT line pitching is
the team’s strength. Darrell Suth
erland and Jim Lonborg are two
of the best starters anywhere in
collegiate ball. Sutherland has
had pro offers despite his never
having an outstanding won-loss
record at Stanford. He was 5-5
with a 2.78 earned run average
in 1962. For two years he’s lost
games that he might have won

had he received minimum hitting and fielding support. A crackling
curve and a live fastball enabled him to pile up 20-% consecutive
scoreless innings in 1962. Lonborg has had trouble controlling his
curve, but, if anything, he has a swifter fast ball than Sutherland.
He was 3-3 with a 2.88 E.R.A.

Newell Can Also Pitch
There are other pitchers on the Stanford roster who are good,
though not in Sutherland and Lonborg’s class. Warren Newell, who
was named to the All-CIBA outfield last year, also did a fair amount
of pitching for the Cards. He had a 2-0 mark and a 2.61 E.R.A.
Others around are John LeCompte (3-0, 2.86), Pete Dixon (1-0, 2.08),
Bob Berry, and Jack Wood, all from last year’s varsity and junior
varsity. Rich Brear is up from the frosh.
Other- Stanford strong-points are shortstop, first base, and the
outfield.
Joel Shulmau is the shortstop and he is a good one. Though he
had a bad fielding year in 1962 he showed unexpected power, leading
the team in doubles and homers, and finishing second in runs
batter! in.
Bob Hollman is the starting first baseman, though Jim Chenu
and Bobby Cox may also play there when they aren’t in the outfield.
Hollman is a good glove man and his bat started Stanford off on a
nine-game win streak last year.
The Starting Outfield
Stanford’s starting outfield will probably consist of Cox, Greg
Post and Warren Newell. Cox is up from the Frosh, where he was
the team’s leading hitter and best all-around player. Post started in
center-field in 1962, batted .258, and led the team in runs scored. He
is also a good base runner. Newell didn’t start a game for Stanford
’til the season was well along, but he finished with a lusty .333
average. He was the only Car’d to be honored by the all-conference
selectors. Chenu has played both first base and the outfield at Stan
ford. He hit .267 in 1962.
THE 1963 VERSION of the Stanford baseball team will be a swift
one, and in the cavernous Sunken Diomand this is important. A
swift outfield such as Newell, Post and Cox should be able to hold
opposition hits to a minimum number of bases. When this is coupled
with the pitching of Sutherland and Lonborg, Stanford’s oppositoin
shouldn't score too many runs.
However, you have to score runs of your own to win, and this
has been an almost traditional Stanford weakness. Fehring hopes
that an early start and constant practice with a pitching machine
will cure that impotence. If it does, Stanford will be surprisingly
strong. If it doesn’t, Stanford will be not so surprisingly weak.


DUTCH FEHRING
Has problems
In the years Dutch Fob ring has coached baseball at Stanford
his teams have never lost more games than they have won in a
season. On the other side of the coin, his teams have never won a
California Intercollegiate Baseball Association championship. This
year’s squad has an excellent chance to do either one.
The Baseball team opens the 1963 season on Feb. 19 against Ihe
USF Dons on Sunken Diamond.
Feliring has an outfit boasting the best front-line pitching in
the CIBA. The problems facing Feliring, and they are big ones, are
finding a catcher, third baseman and second baseman from a group
of hard-working and willing but inexperienced youngsters.
Catcher poses the biggest problem. Jim Seckler, who caught
for the Braves (JVt last year, has the inside track. Buzz Riegel, first
