# Post Office Functioning Described for Students
## 
### WILLIAM REPPY Associate Editor 
If you have any questions about the postal system al Stanford,
this information should be of interest.
Mail is distributed to the 4,000 P.C). boxes at the Stanford Post
Office four times daily: at 8 and 10:30 a.m. and at 1 and 2:30 p.m.
That means if your box is empty at 8:30 a.m. there’s no point
looking again until after 10:30.

This schedule applies Monday through Saturday. On Sunday,
only two of the Stanford P.O.’s twenty employees are at work,
four hours each. They distribute to boxes all first class letters be
tween 7 and 11 a.m.
On weekdays mail comes in at 5:15, 7:30, 8, and 10:30 a.m.
and 12:15, 2:30, and 4:30 p.m., according to the Stanford Post
Office superintendent, Robert Lesh.
What about mailing an important letter? Mail leaves the Stan
-1 orcl P.O. at 10 and 11 a.m. and at 2, 4, and 5 p.m. All letters
dropped through the mailing slots inside the post office ten min
utes before any of the above hours will make that shipment
going out. So if you want to mail an urgent letter at ten minutes
after two, no need to run madly*

to the P. 0.; walk calmly, for you
have more than an hour and a
half to get it there.
All items mailed at Stanford go
to Palo Alto to be cancelled, and
they get Palo Alto postmarks.
Our Post Office is merely a sub
station of the main office in Pali;
but it’s an “independent” sub-sta
tion which means we have our
own destination code of “Stan
ford, California.”
ACCORDING TO Lesh. mail
addressed to someone at “Stan
ford University, Palo Alto, Cali
fornia,” takes four to five hours
longer to reach campus because
it must be sorted twice at Palo
Alto.
Mail addressed to a student at
Stanford lacking the appropriate
P.O. Box, fraternity name, etc., is
returned to sender, said Lesh.
“We are not allowed to give di
rectory privileges.”
"I wish all the rest of the
dorms had individual boxes built
in.” says Lesh. “It would be a
lot easier for the post office.
However, installation of boxes in
other dorms is not expected in
the near future.
SPECIAL DELIVERY letters,
Lesh explained, come in from
Palo Alto on the tops of the bun
dles of mail. Special delivery serv
ices are handled between 7 a.m.
and 11 p.m. Such letters address
ed to persons at the P.O. boxes
will be distributed immediately
after their arrival.
Special D letters addressed to

students at How or fraternity
houses with no box number ap
pearing on the envelope are sup
posed to be delivered to the house
by a mail carrier in a short time.

This hasn’t always happened.
Earlier this week, for example,
Lesh caught an employee about
to put a special D letter into a
P.O. drawer. Lesh noticed that it
was addressed to a fraternity
man at his house address, not
the house P.O. drawer. He had
the letter delivered by carrier.

LESH PROMISES this abuse of
special delivery privileges will
stop and plans a crack-down on
laziness at the P.O.

Another problem but a minor
one—is created by the name
"Stanford.” We get mail intended
for Stanton and Sanford, Calif.
Lesh said, and quite a bit intend
ed for Hanford, Calif. “It's amaz-

ing how many people can make
an ‘H’ look like an ‘St’,” he re
marked, shaking his head,
amused.

tween 7 and 11 a.m.
On weekdays mail comes in at 5:15, 7:30, 8, and 10:30 a.m.
and 12:15, 2:30, and 4:30 p.m., according to the Stanford Post
Office superintendent, Robert Lesh.
What about mailing an important letter? Mail leaves the Stan
-1 orcl P.O. at 10 and 11 a.m. and at 2, 4, and 5 p.m. All letters
dropped through the mailing slots inside the post office ten min
utes before any of the above hours will make that shipment
going out. So if you want to mail an urgent letter at ten minutes
after two, no need to run madly*

to the P. 0.; walk calmly, for you
have more than an hour and a
half to get it there.
All items mailed at Stanford go
to Palo Alto to be cancelled, and
they get Palo Alto postmarks.
Our Post Office is merely a sub
station of the main office in Pali;
but it’s an “independent” sub-sta
tion which means we have our
own destination code of “Stan
ford, California.”
ACCORDING TO Lesh. mail
addressed to someone at “Stan
ford University, Palo Alto, Cali
fornia,” takes four to five hours
longer to reach campus because
it must be sorted twice at Palo
Alto.
Mail addressed to a student at
Stanford lacking the appropriate
P.O. Box, fraternity name, etc., is
returned to sender, said Lesh.
“We are not allowed to give di
rectory privileges.”
"I wish all the rest of the
dorms had individual boxes built
in.” says Lesh. “It would be a
lot easier for the post office.
However, installation of boxes in
other dorms is not expected in
the near future.
SPECIAL DELIVERY letters,
Lesh explained, come in from
Palo Alto on the tops of the bun
dles of mail. Special delivery serv
ices are handled between 7 a.m.
and 11 p.m. Such letters address
ed to persons at the P.O. boxes
will be distributed immediately
after their arrival.
Special D letters addressed to

students at How or fraternity
houses with no box number ap
pearing on the envelope are sup
posed to be delivered to the house
by a mail carrier in a short time.

This hasn’t always happened.
Earlier this week, for example,
Lesh caught an employee about
to put a special D letter into a
P.O. drawer. Lesh noticed that it
was addressed to a fraternity
man at his house address, not
the house P.O. drawer. He had
the letter delivered by carrier.

LESH PROMISES this abuse of
special delivery privileges will
stop and plans a crack-down on
laziness at the P.O.

Another problem but a minor
one—is created by the name
"Stanford.” We get mail intended
for Stanton and Sanford, Calif.
Lesh said, and quite a bit intend
ed for Hanford, Calif. “It's amaz-

ing how many people can make
an ‘H’ look like an ‘St’,” he re
marked, shaking his head,
amused.
