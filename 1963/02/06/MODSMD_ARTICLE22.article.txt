# Coach Explains Loss
## 
### 
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
cited the Indians’ failure to con
trol the boards as a major factor
in their 49-48 loss to Washington
last. Friday night. Dallmar made
the observation that Washington
controlled the ball 65 per cent of
the time.
Dallmar also pointed out that
Tom Dose and Don Clemetson,
the Tribe’s top scorers, failed to
score from the field in the first
half. Far from singling these two
out for special blame, he also
commented that Clayton Raaka,
Darrell Sutherland, and Bob Som
mers hit on only three of 20 shots
between them from the field.
In talking about the play that
won the game for Washington in
the final four seconds, Dallmar
mentioned that the Husky’s pat
tern actually didn’t work, but
Charlie Hart was still able to
hook the ball in on a desperation
shot.
