WASHINGTON—WaIter C. Dowling, U.S. ambassador to Bonn,
said yesterday that West Germany wants Europe and the United
States to establish a partnership cemented by a joint NATO nuclear
force. Dowling made the statement as he arrived from Bonn for
consultations on shaping a new U.S. policy toward Europe in the
wake of France’s veto of British membership in the European Com
mon Market. French President Charles do Gaulle jolted the Western
alliance by blackballing Britain at Brussels and by insisting that
France will develop its own national nuclear force outside NTAO.
CANADA’S GOVERNMENT FALLS — OTTAWA— Canada’s Con
servative government was thrown out of office last night in a show
down confidence vote in the House of Commons. The defeat, on a
motion accusing Prime Minister John Diefenbaker’s minority ad
ministration of indecision on the question of accepting U.S. nuclear
warheads for Canadian rockets and planes, all but ensured dissolu
tion of the 25th Canadian Parliament and another general election
within two months.
