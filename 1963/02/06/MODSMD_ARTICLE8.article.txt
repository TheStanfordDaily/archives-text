PARlS—President Charles dc Gaulle said yesterday he had
turned down Prime Minister Harold Macmillan’s Common Market
hid because of Macmillan’s Nassau conference with President
Kennedy, and a reversal of his views on European defense, a
member of the French parliament reported. A parliament mem-

► ber who asked his name be with
! held said De Gaulle gave this ac
j count of Macmillan’s visit to De
1 Gaulle’s official country resi
dence of Rambouillet and of his
Nassau trip immediately after
wards;
“At Rambouillet Mr. Macmillan
came to me to say that we ought
to unite our two forces. Several
days later he went to the Baha
i mas where he agreed to accept
Polaris missiles instead of air
! borne Skybolts. Naturally that
changed the tone of my press con
ference Jan. 14.’’
EARLIER Premier Georges
i Pompidou said (he Nassau agree
ment showed that “special rela
tionships” still exist between the
United States and Britain. “The
United States is not in Europe
and the Anglo-American link is
not a European link,” he said.
But he denied the Nassau confer
ence caused De Gaulle to reject
Britain’s Common Market bid.
While Adenauer clashed with
De Gaulle, the Soviet Union
sharply attacked both France and
West Germany for their recently
concluded treaty of cooperation.
Notes delivered to the French and
German envoys in Moscow at
tacked the treaty in “very strong
terms,” especially in the provis
ions for military cooperation.
“Officially the negotiations for
British membership have not
ended,” Adenauer said. “The ap
plication is still in front of us
and must be negotiated and con
cluded.”
ADENAUER spoke as U.S.
Ambassador Walter C. Dowling
flew back to Washington a re
port to President Kennedy on
Adenauer’s true stand on De
Gaulle’s boycott of Britain. Many
diplomats believe the French veto
was a strong threat to European
unity. Hallstein emphasized that
point of view yesterday in a
speech to the European “parlia
ment” made up of parliamentari
ans from the six common market
countries meeting in Strasbourg,
j Members from Italy, Belgium,
I Luxembourg and The Nether
lands were expected to join the
Germans in condemning the
j French action.
