# Kruger Sees Link In Fallout, Storms

### WENDY DOBTORT 
Stormy weather and atomic
fallout go together, according to
new studies reported Paul Kru
ger, associate professor of nu
clear chemistry at Stanford, be
fore a meeting of the American
Nuclear Society.
Kruger’s work is supported by
the United States Atomic Energy
Commission under contract with
the Hazleton Nuclear Science
Corporation of Palo Alto.
It consists of studying four
types of storms in four areas:
Pennsylvania’s large-scale “air
uplift" conditions associated with
storm fronts; Oklahoma’s giant
thunderstorms; California’s cy
clonic storms from the Pacific
Ocean; and Hawaii’s trade winds
precipitation caused by uplift on
the slopes of Mauna Loa vol
cano.
Kruger’s investigators have
discovered that a storm front ap
parently can boost fallout as
much as 300 per cent. “All-water”
precipitation, rather rare, seems
to bring about three times as
much fallout as when ice or snow
is formed during the prosess.
The study centers on analysis
of Strontium-90, a product of nu
clear bomb tests with a half-life
of twenty-eight years, because of
its biological importance to man.
Strontium-90, chemically similar
to calcium, has an affinity for
bones and can be ingested
through vegetables and milk.
