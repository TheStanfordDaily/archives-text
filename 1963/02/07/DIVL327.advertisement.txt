Resußts "Cushion Recoil” provides a
dramaticaHy smoother ride
in 1963 Ford-built cars
Ttie challenge given Ford engineers was to design suspensions
that would permit wheels virtually to roll with the punches—not
only in a vertical plane but fore-and-aft as well. Conventional
suspension systems provide only a partial solution to road shocks
by limiting wheel recoil to an up-and-down motion.

The solution? Exclusive Cushion Recoil suspension design in all
Ford-built cars for ’63! Cushion Recoil, with cushioning action
in a fore-and-aft plane as well as vertical, smothers the jars and
jolts of rough roads, adds to your comfort, safety, and driving
pleasure. Even the thump of freeway tar strips is reduced, and
on deeply rutted roads you experience better control of the car.
Furthermore, your Ford-built car is spared the wear and tear of
road-induced vibration.
Another assignment completed—one more example of engineer
ing excellence at Ford and new ideas for the American Road.
