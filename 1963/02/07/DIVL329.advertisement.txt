THE CURSE OF THE CAMPUS: NO. 1
Hate me if you will, but I must speak. We college types are
far too complacent. Sure, we’ve got plenty to* he proud of.
We’ve got atom smashers, we’ve got graduate schools, we’ve got
new peaks in scholarship, new highs in academic honors. And yet,
in the midst of these triumphs, we have failed dismally to make
any progress in solving the oldest and most horrendous of all
campus problems: we’ve still got roommates.
To be sure, all roommates are not bad. There is the well
documented case of Hilquit Glebe, a student at the Manhattan
College of Agriculture, majoring in curds and whey, who ad
mitted publicly that he actually liked his roommate—an odd
admission when you consider that this roommate, Mervis
Trunz by name, was frankly not too winsome a fellow. He
practiced his tympani in his room, he kept an alligator, and he
collected airplane tires.
Hut, on the other hand, Mervis bought two packs of Marlboro
Cigarettes every day and gave one of them to Hilquit and—l ask
you—who can stay mad at a man who gives you Marlboro
('igarettes? Who, upon tasting that flavorful blend of Marlboro
tobaccos, upon drawing through that pure white Marlboro filter,
upon exulting in this best of all possible cigarettes, Marlboro—
who, I say, can harden his heart against his neighbor? Certainly
not Hilquit. Certainly not 1. Certainly not you, as you will find
when you scurry to your nearest tobacconist and buy a supply.
Marlhoros come in soft pack or Flip-Top Box. Tobacconists
come in small, medium, and large.

Hut I digress. Roommates, I say, are still with us and I
fear they always will be, so we better learn how to get along
with them. It can be done, you know. Take, for instance, the
classic case of Dolly Pitcher and Molly Madison.
Dolly and Molly, roommates at a prominent Midwestern
girls’school (Vassar) had a problem that seemed insoluble. Dolly
could only study late at night, and Molly could not stay awake
past nine o’clock. If Dolly kept the lights on, the room was too
bright for Molly to sleep. If Molly turned the lights off, the
•room was too dark for Dolly to study. What to do?
Well sir, those two intelligent American kids found an an
swer. They got a miner’s cap for Dolly! Thus, she had enough
light to study by, and still the room was dark enough for
Molly to sleep.
It must be admitted, however, that this solution, ingenious
as it was, had some unexpected sequelae. Dolly got so en
chanted with her miner’s cup that she switched her major from
18th Century poetry to mining and metallurgy. Shortly after
graduation she had what appeared to be a great stroke of luck:
while out prospecting, she discovered what is without question
the world’s largest feldspar mine. This might have made Dolly
very rich except that nobody, alas, has yet discovered a use for
feldspar. Today Dolly, a broken woman, squeezes out a meagre
living making echoes for tourists in Mammoth Cave.
Nor has Molly fared conspicuously better. Once Dolly got
the miner’s hat, Molly was able to catch up on her long-lost
sleep. She woke after eight days, refreshed and vigorous—more
vigorous, alas, than she realized. It was the afternoon of the
annual Dean’s tea. Molly stood in line with her classmates,
waiting to shake the Dean's hand. At last her turn came, and
Molly, full of strength and health, gave the Dean a firm hand
shake so firm, indeed, that all five of the Dean’s knuckles
were permanently fused.
The Dean sued for a million dollars, and, of course, won. To
day Molly, a broken woman, is paying off her debt by walking
the Dean’s cat every afternoon for ten cents an hour.

classic case of Dolly Pitcher and Molly Madison.
Dolly and Molly, roommates at a prominent Midwestern
girls’school (Vassar) had a problem that seemed insoluble. Dolly
could only study late at night, and Molly could not stay awake
past nine o’clock. If Dolly kept the lights on, the room was too
bright for Molly to sleep. If Molly turned the lights off, the
•room was too dark for Dolly to study. What to do?
Well sir, those two intelligent American kids found an an
swer. They got a miner’s cap for Dolly! Thus, she had enough
light to study by, and still the room was dark enough for
Molly to sleep.
It must be admitted, however, that this solution, ingenious
as it was, had some unexpected sequelae. Dolly got so en
chanted with her miner’s cup that she switched her major from
18th Century poetry to mining and metallurgy. Shortly after
graduation she had what appeared to be a great stroke of luck:
while out prospecting, she discovered what is without question
the world’s largest feldspar mine. This might have made Dolly
very rich except that nobody, alas, has yet discovered a use for
feldspar. Today Dolly, a broken woman, squeezes out a meagre
living making echoes for tourists in Mammoth Cave.
Nor has Molly fared conspicuously better. Once Dolly got
the miner’s hat, Molly was able to catch up on her long-lost
sleep. She woke after eight days, refreshed and vigorous—more
vigorous, alas, than she realized. It was the afternoon of the
annual Dean’s tea. Molly stood in line with her classmates,
waiting to shake the Dean's hand. At last her turn came, and
Molly, full of strength and health, gave the Dean a firm hand
shake so firm, indeed, that all five of the Dean’s knuckles
were permanently fused.
The Dean sued for a million dollars, and, of course, won. To
day Molly, a broken woman, is paying off her debt by walking
the Dean’s cat every afternoon for ten cents an hour.

THE CURSE OF THE CAMPUS: NO. 1
Hate me if you will, but I must speak. We college types are
far too complacent. Sure, we’ve got plenty to* he proud of.
We’ve got atom smashers, we’ve got graduate schools, we’ve got
new peaks in scholarship, new highs in academic honors. And yet,
in the midst of these triumphs, we have failed dismally to make
any progress in solving the oldest and most horrendous of all
campus problems: we’ve still got roommates.
To be sure, all roommates are not bad. There is the well
documented case of Hilquit Glebe, a student at the Manhattan
College of Agriculture, majoring in curds and whey, who ad
mitted publicly that he actually liked his roommate—an odd
admission when you consider that this roommate, Mervis
Trunz by name, was frankly not too winsome a fellow. He
practiced his tympani in his room, he kept an alligator, and he
collected airplane tires.
Hut, on the other hand, Mervis bought two packs of Marlboro
Cigarettes every day and gave one of them to Hilquit and—l ask
you—who can stay mad at a man who gives you Marlboro
('igarettes? Who, upon tasting that flavorful blend of Marlboro
tobaccos, upon drawing through that pure white Marlboro filter,
upon exulting in this best of all possible cigarettes, Marlboro—
who, I say, can harden his heart against his neighbor? Certainly
not Hilquit. Certainly not 1. Certainly not you, as you will find
when you scurry to your nearest tobacconist and buy a supply.
Marlhoros come in soft pack or Flip-Top Box. Tobacconists
come in small, medium, and large.

THE CURSE OF THE CAMPUS: NO. 1
Hate me if you will, but I must speak. We college types are
far too complacent. Sure, we’ve got plenty to* he proud of.
We’ve got atom smashers, we’ve got graduate schools, we’ve got
new peaks in scholarship, new highs in academic honors. And yet,
in the midst of these triumphs, we have failed dismally to make
any progress in solving the oldest and most horrendous of all
campus problems: we’ve still got roommates.
To be sure, all roommates are not bad. There is the well
documented case of Hilquit Glebe, a student at the Manhattan
College of Agriculture, majoring in curds and whey, who ad
mitted publicly that he actually liked his roommate—an odd
admission when you consider that this roommate, Mervis
Trunz by name, was frankly not too winsome a fellow. He
practiced his tympani in his room, he kept an alligator, and he
collected airplane tires.
Hut, on the other hand, Mervis bought two packs of Marlboro
Cigarettes every day and gave one of them to Hilquit and—l ask
you—who can stay mad at a man who gives you Marlboro
('igarettes? Who, upon tasting that flavorful blend of Marlboro
tobaccos, upon drawing through that pure white Marlboro filter,
upon exulting in this best of all possible cigarettes, Marlboro—
who, I say, can harden his heart against his neighbor? Certainly
not Hilquit. Certainly not 1. Certainly not you, as you will find
when you scurry to your nearest tobacconist and buy a supply.
Marlhoros come in soft pack or Flip-Top Box. Tobacconists
come in small, medium, and large.

Hut I digress. Roommates, I say, are still with us and I
fear they always will be, so we better learn how to get along
with them. It can be done, you know. Take, for instance, the
classic case of Dolly Pitcher and Molly Madison.
Dolly and Molly, roommates at a prominent Midwestern
girls’school (Vassar) had a problem that seemed insoluble. Dolly
could only study late at night, and Molly could not stay awake
past nine o’clock. If Dolly kept the lights on, the room was too
bright for Molly to sleep. If Molly turned the lights off, the
•room was too dark for Dolly to study. What to do?
Well sir, those two intelligent American kids found an an
swer. They got a miner’s cap for Dolly! Thus, she had enough
light to study by, and still the room was dark enough for
Molly to sleep.
It must be admitted, however, that this solution, ingenious
as it was, had some unexpected sequelae. Dolly got so en
chanted with her miner’s cup that she switched her major from
18th Century poetry to mining and metallurgy. Shortly after
graduation she had what appeared to be a great stroke of luck:
while out prospecting, she discovered what is without question
the world’s largest feldspar mine. This might have made Dolly
very rich except that nobody, alas, has yet discovered a use for
feldspar. Today Dolly, a broken woman, squeezes out a meagre
living making echoes for tourists in Mammoth Cave.
Nor has Molly fared conspicuously better. Once Dolly got
the miner’s hat, Molly was able to catch up on her long-lost
sleep. She woke after eight days, refreshed and vigorous—more
vigorous, alas, than she realized. It was the afternoon of the
annual Dean’s tea. Molly stood in line with her classmates,
waiting to shake the Dean's hand. At last her turn came, and
Molly, full of strength and health, gave the Dean a firm hand
shake so firm, indeed, that all five of the Dean’s knuckles
were permanently fused.
The Dean sued for a million dollars, and, of course, won. To
day Molly, a broken woman, is paying off her debt by walking
the Dean’s cat every afternoon for ten cents an hour.
