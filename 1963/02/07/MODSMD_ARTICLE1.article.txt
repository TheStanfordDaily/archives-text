# Foreign Campuses Are 'Asset,' But Draw Extensive Criticism
## 
### TEMP PECK ( First of a Two-Part Series 
The Stanford Overseas Program, after five years of operation,
continues to thrive, improve, and draw criticism. Some propose
abandoning the entire effort—an approach which is as unrealistic
as it is negative. Stirling L. Huntley, Assistant Director of Ad
missions, calls the program a “very important asset" in attracting

prospective freshmen to
each year. Even if the foreign
campuses were demonstrably
miserable, it is unlikely that the
University - which knows a good
thing when it sees one - would
liquidate an extensive investment
and a big drawing card among
prospective frosh.
THE OVERSEAS Program is
not lacking in constructive critics
either. “There is a considerable
division of opinion among the
faculty,” says Professor John
Goheen, who helped the Japanese
anti Chinese study centers in
Tokyo and Taipei. As for the stu
dents, several committees of stu
dents returning from abroad have
studied the problems in detail
and made recommendations on
possible improvements. An out
growth of this movement has been
the Overseas Campus Board which
now serves both as a channel for
constructive criticism and as an
aid to the orientation program for
students about to depart.
Criticism of the program falls
into two categories: there are
specific problems of administra
tion (such as disciplinary proce
dure >. and there are problems
surrounding the purposes and
goals of the campuses. The ad
ministrative “bugs” are being
worked out of the program at a
fairly constant rate. But after
five years of operation, the ac
tual goals of the study centers —
as the University states them—
remains nebulous. These articles
will therefore be concerned with
the goals of the Overseas Cam
puses, discussing the administra
tion's statement of those goals to
day and comparing wdth them the
goals of other programs tomor
row'.

The applicant will not be sur
prised to learn from the Univer
sity’s brochure that he is being
sent abroad because Stanford de
sires “that her men and women

shall achieve a broad comprehen
sion of the society in which they
live . . The brochure then pro
ceeds to break the cliche bank by
calling the six-month trip “a voy
age of discovery.” Actually, the
main goal of the program—if one
could call it that is elucidated
on a page entitled, “The Stanford
Plan Is Practical.”
IT IS PRACTICAL. It is inten
tionally designed so that many
for whom study abroad would
otherwise be impossible can go.
It is open to sophomores, it costs
as much as a tegular quarter at
Stanford plus transportation
home and somewhat increased
living expenses, its courses gen
erally satisfy General Studies re
quirements, and only two quar
ters of preparation are required
in the language.
The practicality of the program
is at once its biggest asset and its
greatest liability. Many students
in Engineering and the Natural
Sciences simply haven’t lime in
their schedules to include one or
two years of language training.
A Pre-med major would find it
nearly impossible to study abroad
for a year and take non-General
Studies courses. The Stanford pro
gram offers him about the only
practical chance to study abroad
before he starts his long period of
graduate work and internship.

THIS IMPLIED goal of “prac
ticality” is almost a sacred cow
among the Administration of the
Overseas Program. The program’s
Director, Dr. Robert A. Walker,
notes that only twenty percent of
the participants go abroad with
the minimum two quarters exper
ience in the language. Many take
advantage of the tutorial the
Overseas Office provides for
those who cannot fit extra in
struction into their schedules.
Both students and faculty mem
bers have occasionally pressed
for a raising of the minimum re
quirements, but the Administra
tion continues to rely on persua
sion and the tutorials rather than
“rule out a very large percentage
of students” who do not have
time for additional preparation.

growth of this movement has been
the Overseas Campus Board which
now serves both as a channel for
constructive criticism and as an

Criticism of the program falls
into two categories: there are
specific problems of administra
tion (such as disciplinary proce
dure >. and there are problems
surrounding the purposes and
goals of the campuses. The ad
ministrative “bugs” are being
worked out of the program at a
fairly constant rate. But after
five years of operation, the ac
tual goals of the study centers —
as the University states them—
remains nebulous. These articles
will therefore be concerned with
the goals of the Overseas Cam
puses, discussing the administra

day and comparing wdth them the
goals of other programs tomor

The applicant will not be sur
prised to learn from the Univer
sity’s brochure that he is being
sent abroad because Stanford de
sires “that her men and women

shall achieve a broad comprehen
sion of the society in which they
live . . The brochure then pro
ceeds to break the cliche bank by
calling the six-month trip “a voy
age of discovery.” Actually, the
main goal of the program—if one
could call it that is elucidated
on a page entitled, “The Stanford
Plan Is Practical.”
IT IS PRACTICAL. It is inten
tionally designed so that many
for whom study abroad would
otherwise be impossible can go.
It is open to sophomores, it costs
as much as a tegular quarter at
Stanford plus transportation
home and somewhat increased
living expenses, its courses gen
erally satisfy General Studies re
quirements, and only two quar
ters of preparation are required
in the language.
The practicality of the program
is at once its biggest asset and its
greatest liability. Many students
in Engineering and the Natural
Sciences simply haven’t lime in
their schedules to include one or
two years of language training.
A Pre-med major would find it
nearly impossible to study abroad
for a year and take non-General
Studies courses. The Stanford pro
gram offers him about the only
practical chance to study abroad
before he starts his long period of
graduate work and internship.

THIS IMPLIED goal of “prac
ticality” is almost a sacred cow
among the Administration of the
Overseas Program. The program’s
Director, Dr. Robert A. Walker,
notes that only twenty percent of
the participants go abroad with
the minimum two quarters exper
ience in the language. Many take
advantage of the tutorial the
Overseas Office provides for
those who cannot fit extra in
struction into their schedules.
Both students and faculty mem
bers have occasionally pressed
for a raising of the minimum re
quirements, but the Administra
tion continues to rely on persua
sion and the tutorials rather than
“rule out a very large percentage
of students” who do not have
time for additional preparation.
The Stanford Overseas Program, after five years of operation,
continues to thrive, improve, and draw criticism. Some propose
abandoning the entire effort—an approach which is as unrealistic
as it is negative. Stirling L. Huntley, Assistant Director of Ad
missions, calls the program a “very important asset" in attracting

prospective freshmen to
each year. Even if the foreign
campuses were demonstrably
miserable, it is unlikely that the
University - which knows a good
thing when it sees one - would
liquidate an extensive investment
and a big drawing card among
prospective frosh.

not lacking in constructive critics
either. “There is a considerable
division of opinion among the
faculty,” says Professor John
Goheen, who helped the Japanese
anti Chinese study centers in
Tokyo and Taipei. As for the stu
