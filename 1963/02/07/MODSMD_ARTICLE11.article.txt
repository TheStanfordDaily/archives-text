# Proposed Freshman Program
## 
### 
The plan to “integrate the classroom with the residence”
in a new History of Western Civilization and Freshman
English program is very welcome. It should be considered
seriously.
For many of the students at Stanford, their academic and
dormitory lives are quite removed from each other. For them,
learning ends when they leave the classroom or the library.
Yet, a university must be devoted to providing more than
simply a “class-room education.” Almost every educational
experience can, in many cases, be related to the non-aca
demic world.
As Dwight Clark, Dean of Freshman Men and Director of
Wilbur Hall, has said, “a melting together of living and learn
ing . . .” is a means toward this goal. He has proposed a pro
gram in which students on the same floor will have the same
English or Western Civ instructor. The English themes would
be integrated with the Western Civ topic under discussion.
When possible, the instructor would actually live in the house.
Also, grades would be replaced by a “Pass” or “Fail” rating
and a written analysis of the student’s work.
This program would greatly benefit the Freshmen in their
attempt to coordinate what they learn in the classroom with
the things and the people around them.
