# STAFF OPINION
## Is Social Action Part of Education? 
### MICHAEL. SAKS 
(Editors’ note; This is the second of a three-part series on
partisan politics on the Stanford campus.)
Another question that letters on file in the University raise
is, “What is education?” Is social action a necessary part of
education? President Sterling does not think so. Mr. Glover
quotes President Sterling as saying that “Social action is not
necessary to education.” Many students disagree with this state
ment. Jim Woolsey has said that “Education is that which
stretches the mind.” Students involved in political affairs as
well as faculty members believe that participation is a necessary
part of education.
Winbigler secs the University as a place for scholars to
study matters. The University’s role is to foster clear thinking
about candidates. “Often campaigning is a deterrent to clear
reflective and objective deliberation on ideas and issues,” he
said.
As could be predicted, the academic side of the University
has a broader view of the function of the University. Professor
Hubert Marshall of the Political Science Department believes
that it is ridiculous for the University to bo bound by a 19th
century will. As he sees it, the Stanfords’ idea was to keep the
campus from becoming known as a Republican or Democratic
stronghold. In his opinion, any student group should bo allowed
on campus that confines its proceedings to campus interest. The
campus should present a free market place of ideas. He would
allow all groups on campus. Since the students are old enough
to die for their country, they should get a taste of political
persuasion. They should learn to discriminate.
Professor Marshall feels it is important for students to be
exposed to open coercions such as campaigning and proselytiz
ing. This is the right place for it, because many students have
come from homes where politics is never discussed. He believes
that such open coercion is better than having a professor in
tentionally slant his lectures to put over his views. With a
twinkle in his eye, Marshall said that most Stanford students
are too clever anyway to have anything put over on them of
this sort. Professor Marshall emphasized that if groups were al
lowed to meet on campus, they would have to make it clear that
they were representing themselves and not Stanford University.
Professor Charles Drekmeier of the Political Science De
partment also added his view's to the subject. He believes that
“a major function of a University is to teach people to think
critically. Only through participation can students see the
ambiguities that are always involved in ideas.” It is Drekmeier’s
view that “the university is the way that society institutional
izes criticism. Therefore, controversy must be a part of what
goes on. Controversy is an important part of the educational
process.” Drekmeier posed the question, “What do ideas really
mean until they are applied to an immediate situation? In re
lating thought to the real world, we are able to see how the
world and society function.” Borrowing from Edmund Burke,
Drekmeier queried “perhaps we have here thought in a
vacuum?”

ing. This is the right place for it, because many students have
come from homes where politics is never discussed. He believes
that such open coercion is better than having a professor in
tentionally slant his lectures to put over his views. With a
twinkle in his eye, Marshall said that most Stanford students
are too clever anyway to have anything put over on them of
this sort. Professor Marshall emphasized that if groups were al
lowed to meet on campus, they would have to make it clear that
they were representing themselves and not Stanford University.
Professor Charles Drekmeier of the Political Science De
partment also added his view's to the subject. He believes that
“a major function of a University is to teach people to think
critically. Only through participation can students see the
ambiguities that are always involved in ideas.” It is Drekmeier’s
view that “the university is the way that society institutional
izes criticism. Therefore, controversy must be a part of what
goes on. Controversy is an important part of the educational
process.” Drekmeier posed the question, “What do ideas really
mean until they are applied to an immediate situation? In re
lating thought to the real world, we are able to see how the
world and society function.” Borrowing from Edmund Burke,
Drekmeier queried “perhaps we have here thought in a
vacuum?”
(Editors’ note; This is the second of a three-part series on
partisan politics on the Stanford campus.)
Another question that letters on file in the University raise
is, “What is education?” Is social action a necessary part of
education? President Sterling does not think so. Mr. Glover
quotes President Sterling as saying that “Social action is not
necessary to education.” Many students disagree with this state
ment. Jim Woolsey has said that “Education is that which
stretches the mind.” Students involved in political affairs as
well as faculty members believe that participation is a necessary
part of education.
Winbigler secs the University as a place for scholars to
study matters. The University’s role is to foster clear thinking
about candidates. “Often campaigning is a deterrent to clear
reflective and objective deliberation on ideas and issues,” he
said.
As could be predicted, the academic side of the University
has a broader view of the function of the University. Professor
Hubert Marshall of the Political Science Department believes
that it is ridiculous for the University to bo bound by a 19th
century will. As he sees it, the Stanfords’ idea was to keep the
campus from becoming known as a Republican or Democratic
stronghold. In his opinion, any student group should bo allowed
on campus that confines its proceedings to campus interest. The
campus should present a free market place of ideas. He would
allow all groups on campus. Since the students are old enough
to die for their country, they should get a taste of political
persuasion. They should learn to discriminate.
