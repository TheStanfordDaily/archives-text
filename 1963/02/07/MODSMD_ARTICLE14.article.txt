## Play Gives New Approach To Problems of World 
### STEVE WORDELL 
The play “Music at Midnight” which opened on Monday
night at the Curran Theater is a cleverly written treatise de
signed to show a new approach to world problems for the Com
munist and non-Communist world alike.
British authors Peter Howard and Alan Thornhill lake a
familiar stalemate situation where a Western nation, having
given vocal support to an uprising in a country subjected to a
totalitarian regime, faces the fact that armed support of the
rebels could only lead to a major atomic war with the totali
tarian power.
The play suggests that the Western Prime Minister (bril
liantly portrayed in Churchillian style by Walter Fitzgerald)
accepts a vastly greater sense of destiny for his own country,
enabling it to dwarf the claims and revolutionary aims of the
totalitarian power instead of maintaining the status quo. “We
need someone who will lead the world at a gallop to the place
where it can get food and work and a hope of lasting peace.
Someone who will cut corners to get there fast,” says the rebel
leader Nils (Derrick Sherwint who manages to escape to the
West for one day and interview the Prime Minister.
The key is turned in the Prime Minister’s thinking when his
beatnik son (John Forrest) who “Twists for Peace” decides that
instead of living in reaction to his father’s great reputation and
status quo politics, he will fight alongside him to expedite their
new vision of a national destiny.
The change in both father and son comes about as a result
of the reluctant recourse of the rebel leader Nils to a belief in
“God and the Devil, the Saints and the Angels, Heaven and Hell,
and the Ten Commandments thrown in.”
This play may provoke a regenerate spark of life in a Chris
tian democracy. It is the beginning of something new in the
theater.
“Music at Midnight,” produced by Moral Re-Armament, has
come on tour of the United States after a successful seven-month
run in London’s West End. It continues at the Curran through
the ninth and then heads across the country for Washington.
