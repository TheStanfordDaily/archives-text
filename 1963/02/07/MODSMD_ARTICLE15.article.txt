# BOOK REVIEW
## 'The Rothchilds': 'Only Half-Bad' 
### JOHN A. BISSELL 
“The Rothschilds,” Frederic Morton; Fawcett Publications,
Inc.; 1962 ; 244 pp.
Mr. Morton has set himself an ambitious goal in his rela
tively short biography of the Rothschilds: to depict the “human”
side of the Rothschild epic; to depict 199 years of family history,
from their origins in an obscure Frankfurt (on the Main)
ghetto to their twentieth century position as the very old, very
fashionable rich. He suffers from the added burden of having
chosen the less interesting aspect of the family about which to
write, for that aspect of life into which they sank their genius
was banking, not humanity.
Where Mr. Morton succeeds best in his aim of giving us the
flesh-and-blood Rothschilds he is at his worst. The book opens
on a scene which could have come out of “Paris Match.” Baron
Philippe is giving in marriage his daughter Philippine; the
wedding is held in the French village of Pauillac in March, 1961.
It’s very sweet, sickly sweet, and uncritical. These two adjec
tives, unfortunately, characterize much of the last third of the
book as well, where Mr. Morton is busy turning the essentially
mediocre late nineteenth and early twentieth century Roth
schilds into either models of social virtue or eccentric genius.
Mr. Morton does much better when discussing the rise of
the family. He cannot, and does not, ignore the brilliant series
of machinations which led old Mayer Rothschild to the top of
Germany’s banking world in the 1780’s, and which led his five
brilliant sons to dominate the finance of the western world by
the end of the Napoleonic Wars. This first half of the book is in
teresting indeed; whether this effect is a result of the subject
matter or of Mr. Morton’s insight into the family is immaterial.
The first half saves Mr. Morton’s book from being just one more
glorified gossip column.
