# FOREIGN CAMPUS
## French Civilization Course at Tours 
### ILENE STRELITZ 
(Editors’ note: Miss Strelitz is a Daily staff member pres
ently at Stanford-in-Franee.)
A bevy of leading French scholars, presented in the form of
a well-organized civilization course, has given Stanford-in-
France its own unique brand of “Tuesday Evening Series.”
Offered at the French campus for the first time, to the cur
rent Group V, the French Civilization course has been over a
year in planning by French directurs JTiul LeMoal and Jean
Marty.
Two to three evenings each week the eighty students gather
in the library lecture hall for two hours of lecture and debate
led by the visiting scholars. An extensive synopsis of the coming
address is given to the students in preparation for their con
ference with the scholars. The synopses are in French while, for
the first quarter of the group’s six-month stay, just over half of
the lectures are in French.
For the first quarter a series of 17 lectures, spread over a
period of 23 two-hour meetings, will be presented by six French
scholars.
One of the backbones of the program is Professor of Medi
eval History at the University of Poitiers, Bernard Chevalier,
whose lectures and debate sessions with the Stanford students
vary in subject matter among the French Army, the history of
Paris, the legacy of the Middle Ages, Catholic France at the time
of the Concordat, the contemporary institutions of France, the
geography of France, and the political parties of France. Che
valier is a familiar friend of the Stanford students who met him
as their guide on their first field trip to the Chateaux of the
Tourraine and benefited by his lectures once again as he ac
companied them on their recent field trip to Rome,
One of the leading men in his field, Gilbert Simondon, will
lecture the students on the great currents of contemporary
French philosophy. A two-part series on French teaching and
Universities in France was presented by Professor Claude Monod
who came before the students in the true French tradition of
the fluent and perfected rhetorician-lecturer.
French literature receives its share of the program in three
lectures covering poetry, literature, and theater. The first two
were discussed by Professor J. F. Leaud, himself a poet and a
writer, and in his animated presentation a symbol to the stu
dents of all that is alive in French culture.
A panorama of the French theater of the twentieth century
will be presented by Pier re Waldner. Leaud will also discuss the
Church in France since 1926.
Professor Renee Henri-Greard of the Institute of Political
Science in Paris will speak to the group of the great bodies of
the state.
The second quarter, when the group’s comprehension of
French will enable the administration to have an even greater
latitude in the series, such figures as Louis Gabriel Robimet,
political writer for the metropolitan Paris newspaper “Figaro.”
and Maurice Duverger, Professor of Law at the University in
Paris will come to Stanford-in-France.
Previous to last quarter’s program, a series of guest lec
turers spoke to the groups “without connection.” The program
is now arranged in a systematic manner. According to assistant
director of the campus Jean Marty, the previous program “had
no oneness.”
Now that the lecturers are presented in the form of an or
ganized curriculum, the students are receiving units for the first
time for this activity. Currently the students and administra
tion of Stanford-in-France are in contact with the administra
tors at Stanford in California in an attempt to increase the num
ber of units given for the French Civilization course in order to
open up more time for independent reading.

valier is a familiar friend of the Stanford students who met him
as their guide on their first field trip to the Chateaux of the
Tourraine and benefited by his lectures once again as he ac
companied them on their recent field trip to Rome,
One of the leading men in his field, Gilbert Simondon, will
lecture the students on the great currents of contemporary
French philosophy. A two-part series on French teaching and
Universities in France was presented by Professor Claude Monod
who came before the students in the true French tradition of
the fluent and perfected rhetorician-lecturer.
French literature receives its share of the program in three
lectures covering poetry, literature, and theater. The first two
were discussed by Professor J. F. Leaud, himself a poet and a
writer, and in his animated presentation a symbol to the stu
dents of all that is alive in French culture.
A panorama of the French theater of the twentieth century
will be presented by Pier re Waldner. Leaud will also discuss the
Church in France since 1926.
Professor Renee Henri-Greard of the Institute of Political
Science in Paris will speak to the group of the great bodies of
the state.
The second quarter, when the group’s comprehension of
French will enable the administration to have an even greater
latitude in the series, such figures as Louis Gabriel Robimet,
political writer for the metropolitan Paris newspaper “Figaro.”
and Maurice Duverger, Professor of Law at the University in
Paris will come to Stanford-in-France.
Previous to last quarter’s program, a series of guest lec
turers spoke to the groups “without connection.” The program
is now arranged in a systematic manner. According to assistant
director of the campus Jean Marty, the previous program “had
no oneness.”
Now that the lecturers are presented in the form of an or
ganized curriculum, the students are receiving units for the first
time for this activity. Currently the students and administra
tion of Stanford-in-France are in contact with the administra
tors at Stanford in California in an attempt to increase the num
ber of units given for the French Civilization course in order to
open up more time for independent reading.

A bevy of leading French scholars, presented in the form of
a well-organized civilization course, has given Stanford-in-
France its own unique brand of “Tuesday Evening Series.”
Offered at the French campus for the first time, to the cur
rent Group V, the French Civilization course has been over a
year in planning by French directurs JTiul LeMoal and Jean
Marty.
Two to three evenings each week the eighty students gather
in the library lecture hall for two hours of lecture and debate
led by the visiting scholars. An extensive synopsis of the coming
address is given to the students in preparation for their con
ference with the scholars. The synopses are in French while, for
the first quarter of the group’s six-month stay, just over half of
the lectures are in French.
For the first quarter a series of 17 lectures, spread over a
period of 23 two-hour meetings, will be presented by six French
scholars.
One of the backbones of the program is Professor of Medi
eval History at the University of Poitiers, Bernard Chevalier,
whose lectures and debate sessions with the Stanford students
vary in subject matter among the French Army, the history of
Paris, the legacy of the Middle Ages, Catholic France at the time
of the Concordat, the contemporary institutions of France, the
geography of France, and the political parties of France. Che
