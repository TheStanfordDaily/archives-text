# CAMPUS OPINION
## Indian Government Knew of Aksai-Chin Road' 
### 
By PR AN NATH
(Editors' note: This is a rebut
tal to the “Staff Opinion” which
appear*! in Monday's Daily, which
contested that Indian and China
both had good claim to (lie dis
puted territory between the two
countries.)
Felix Greene has suggested
that the Indian Government knew
of the road in Aksai-Chin but
took a long time before deciding
they owned it and that both India
and China have good claim to the
disputed territory. This sugges
tion is surprising because, for a
long lime, the state of Jammu
and Kashmir had a well estab
lished boundary with Tibet and
Sinkiang. The boundary of La-

dakh and Tibet was affirmed by
Treaty of 1842 signed by the au
thorities of Kashmir, the Dalai
Lama of Tibet and the represen
tative of the Emperor of China
called Kalon Sokon. The Treaty
asserts,
“. . . There will never be on
any acount in future while the
World lasts, any deviation even
by a hair’s breadth and any
breach in the alliance, friendship
and unity between the King of
the World Siri Khalsaji Saheb
and Siri Maharaj Raja-i-Rajagan
Ra.ja Saheb Bahadur and the
Khagon of China and the Lama
j Guru Saheb of Lhasa.”
As a matter of fact the boun
\ dary between Ladakh and Tibet
: was so well-known and accepted
by both sides that the communi
cation of 1847 from the Chinese
Imperial Commissioner at Canton
j to the British authorities reads:

"Respecting the frontiers, I
beg to remark that the borders
of these territories have been
sufficiently and distinctly fixed,
so that it will be best to adhere
to this ancient arrangement and
it will prove far more convenient
to abstain from any additional
measures for fixing them.’’
HOW TURN l)OKS this ‘indi
cate that China wasn’t necessari
ly an aggressor in taking the
land to build the road’? What was
this ‘ancient arrangement’ and
‘distinctly fixed borders’? The
Royal Chronicle of the Kings of
Ladakh written in the 17th Cen
tury A.D. refers to records of
10th Century A.D. where Imis
Pass was on the border of La
dakh and Tibet. The border be
tween Ladakh and Tibet was even
clear to the Italian traveller Ip
polito Desideri who travelled
from Leh to Lhasa in 1715. He
makes it clear that the boundary

j lay between Demchok and Tash-
I gong which is in accordance with
; the present Indian alignment.
How could the boundary which
| was so ‘distinctly fixed’ become
suddenly hazy to the Chinese
) eye? The territorial ambitions of
| China are no secret to anyone. A
| strong China has always been an
expansionist China. In 618-907
; A.D.. under the T'ang emperors,
| parts of what is now called the
| U.S.S.R. and the whole of Af
j ghanistan were forced to recog
nize Chinese authority. In 1280-
1 1644 under the Yuan rulers the
i Chinese overthrew Burma, Thai-
I land and Indo-China and landed
j troops in Indonesio. The entire
j Muslim world was terrorized by
I the exaction of an annual tribute
j from the holy city of Mecca.
THE STAFF OPINION holds
j that “This year’s activities were
started on India’s initiative. She
began gobbling up Chinese
posts.” India has been putting
checkposts for a long time in the
frontier regions after she be
came suspicious of the Chinese
motives. These checkposts were
only symbolic of the sovereignty
I of India in this territory but were
j not meant to be military offen
j sives. They were few and far be
| tween and with inadequate sup
ply lines and policed by few Ja
wans (GL’s). It was China alone
that was responsible for ‘this
year's activities’ i.e., of 1962 by
indulging in military build up
! secretly and opening new road
j in Ladakh from 78° 35’ E, 35° 0’
! 33” N to the west of 79° 10’ E, 34°
143’ N and thence southward to
j 79° 8’ E, 34° 33’ N. Starting on
110 th of July, 1962, the Chinese
I created a dangerous and tense sit

\ nation by encircling an Indian
post at 78° 38’ E, 34° 39’ 45” N on
the Galwan river for several days.
The Indian Government did not
send any enforcements to prevent
any further developments. By
August of 1962 China had estab-1
lished 18 new outposts deep in |
side Indian Territory in Chip
Chap, Galwan Valley, Pangong,
Sprangur, and Qura Qush region.
Far from having a claim (not
to talk of good) the Chinese have
given the impression of a bunch
of thugs who cannot decide
among themselves how much
ransom they want. They have
changed their maps even while
the talks were in progress. In
Ladakh for example the align
ment shown in 1960 map covered 1
2000 square miles more of Indian j

territory than of 1959, which was
endorsed by Chou-En-Lai. This
seems to he a curious ‘New Fron
tier Spirit’ of the Chinese. Chi
nese have been using the tactics
of the late Dr. Goebbels, that if
only a falsehood is uttered often
and with emphasis, it proves ir
resistable. Apparently this has
been the case with the Staff Opin
ion. As Ceylon’s Deputy Speaker
,\lr. Hugh Fernando puts it, China
has not been practising Panch
Shcela but “Pancha-Heela” the
doctrine of lying.

NOW LET l's turn our atten
tion to the other sector of the
border—the McMahon Line. Chi
na has created a great confusion
hy exploiting the word ‘McMa
hon’ by associating it with British
Imperialism, Let us examine this
problem. NEF. where the Chinese
claim about 36,000 square miles,
lies on the southern crest of the
Himalayas. The boundary line
here should run along the water
shed. This is a well-recognized
principle of international law.
When two countries are sepa
rated hy a mountain range the
{traditional boundary takes shape
along the crest which (divides I lie
major volume of the waters flow
ing into the two countries. The
McMahon Line is basically this,
and Indian political authority has
always been exercised on these
foothills of the Himalayan range.
The tribal people Akas. Dallas
and Bhutis paid tributes to the
Ahom Kings and later to the
British Government. Specific
proof of administrative control
occurs in the legislative enact
ments etc. of 1873, 1880, 1884,
1914, 1919, 1928. 1929, 1933 and
1950. The representatives of Chi
na and India met three times sep
arately: in Peking in 1960 with
18 meetings. Also in the same
year they had 19 meetings in New
Delhi and 10 meetings in Ran

*
I goon. The Indian team found not |
| a single Chinese law or adminis- $
i t native regulation which makes ‘
mention of any of the tribal areas $
j that they claim. ‘
The final outcome of the above I*l
, three sessions is interesting. Out
j of the 118 questions asked by the i 1?
Indian team only 59 were an- t .,
swered by the Chinese team. The j?
Indian side answered all the 57 _
questions put by the Chinese
team except one. Based on all
relevant considerations a formal
Treaty was signed in 1914 be
lt ween India and Tibet. Tibet at
[that time had the power to sign
treaties to negotiate its bounda
ries directly with its neighbors.
I The Chinese Government had rec- j
ogni/ed these rights enjoyed by
Tibet. China abstained at the end
j of the Convention from ratifying
jit, not because of the definition
|of the McMahon Line, but be-1
ieau.se of the definition of the)
;boundary between Inner and

Outer Tibet.
When wrong maps started ap |
peering in the Chinese press, In
dia brought it to the Chinese at- I
tention. On October 18, 1954 when |
Nehru was in Peking, he pointed J
out the maps which showed 50,- j I
000 square miles of Indian lerri- I
tory as Chinese, Chou-En-Lai I
said that they were merely a re-,
production of the' old Kuomin-j
tang maps and that they would j
be revised. On November 28. 1956
when Chou-En-Lai visited India, j
he agreed with Nehru that there j
was no major dispute between:
China and India on border.
Has ‘Nehru lost friends among j
the neutrals he once led’, and has
China made more friends by
| opening fire and ceasing fire at j
her will? Does the Chinese with-
S drawal indicate “an act which
1 gives the impression of non-ag
gression . . .”? The member of I
| the recent Colombo Conference!
have in essence arrived at the j
Sept. 8 position. Even the com
! munist parties of Italy, France
[ and East Germany have seen
! through the McMahon mist cre
ated by China.
I If China is interested in peace
j and goodwill, India, as Nehru has
I pointed out, would agree to put-1
1 ting the question to an Inter-1
national Court. Mao, however,
j does not love peace as much as
| some would like him to. “What
are a couple of hundred million
j people?” said Mao once to Rob
ert Sherrod, Editor of Saturday
| Evening Post referring to nu
| clear war. India does not plan to
crucify itself, so that humanity
j be saved. A philosophy of a more
human timbre has always ema-'
* nated from India.

lished boundary with Tibet and
Sinkiang. The boundary of La-

dakh and Tibet was affirmed by
Treaty of 1842 signed by the au
thorities of Kashmir, the Dalai
Lama of Tibet and the represen
tative of the Emperor of China
called Kalon Sokon. The Treaty
asserts,
“. . . There will never be on
any acount in future while the
World lasts, any deviation even
by a hair’s breadth and any
breach in the alliance, friendship
and unity between the King of
the World Siri Khalsaji Saheb
and Siri Maharaj Raja-i-Rajagan
Ra.ja Saheb Bahadur and the
Khagon of China and the Lama
j Guru Saheb of Lhasa.”
As a matter of fact the boun
\ dary between Ladakh and Tibet
: was so well-known and accepted
by both sides that the communi
cation of 1847 from the Chinese
Imperial Commissioner at Canton
j to the British authorities reads:

"Respecting the frontiers, I
beg to remark that the borders
of these territories have been
sufficiently and distinctly fixed,
so that it will be best to adhere
to this ancient arrangement and
it will prove far more convenient
to abstain from any additional
measures for fixing them.’’
HOW TURN l)OKS this ‘indi
cate that China wasn’t necessari
ly an aggressor in taking the
land to build the road’? What was
this ‘ancient arrangement’ and
‘distinctly fixed borders’? The
Royal Chronicle of the Kings of
Ladakh written in the 17th Cen
tury A.D. refers to records of
10th Century A.D. where Imis
Pass was on the border of La
dakh and Tibet. The border be
tween Ladakh and Tibet was even
clear to the Italian traveller Ip
polito Desideri who travelled
from Leh to Lhasa in 1715. He
makes it clear that the boundary

j lay between Demchok and Tash-
I gong which is in accordance with
; the present Indian alignment.
How could the boundary which
| was so ‘distinctly fixed’ become
suddenly hazy to the Chinese
) eye? The territorial ambitions of
| China are no secret to anyone. A
| strong China has always been an
expansionist China. In 618-907
; A.D.. under the T'ang emperors,
| parts of what is now called the
| U.S.S.R. and the whole of Af
j ghanistan were forced to recog
nize Chinese authority. In 1280-
1 1644 under the Yuan rulers the
i Chinese overthrew Burma, Thai-
I land and Indo-China and landed
j troops in Indonesio. The entire
j Muslim world was terrorized by
I the exaction of an annual tribute
j from the holy city of Mecca.
THE STAFF OPINION holds
j that “This year’s activities were
started on India’s initiative. She
began gobbling up Chinese
posts.” India has been putting
checkposts for a long time in the
frontier regions after she be
came suspicious of the Chinese
motives. These checkposts were
only symbolic of the sovereignty
I of India in this territory but were
j not meant to be military offen
j sives. They were few and far be
| tween and with inadequate sup
ply lines and policed by few Ja
wans (GL’s). It was China alone
that was responsible for ‘this
year's activities’ i.e., of 1962 by
indulging in military build up
! secretly and opening new road
j in Ladakh from 78° 35’ E, 35° 0’
! 33” N to the west of 79° 10’ E, 34°
143’ N and thence southward to
j 79° 8’ E, 34° 33’ N. Starting on
110 th of July, 1962, the Chinese
I created a dangerous and tense sit

\ nation by encircling an Indian
post at 78° 38’ E, 34° 39’ 45” N on
the Galwan river for several days.
The Indian Government did not
send any enforcements to prevent
any further developments. By
August of 1962 China had estab-1
lished 18 new outposts deep in |
side Indian Territory in Chip
Chap, Galwan Valley, Pangong,
Sprangur, and Qura Qush region.
Far from having a claim (not
to talk of good) the Chinese have
given the impression of a bunch
of thugs who cannot decide
among themselves how much
ransom they want. They have
changed their maps even while
the talks were in progress. In
Ladakh for example the align
ment shown in 1960 map covered 1
2000 square miles more of Indian j

territory than of 1959, which was
endorsed by Chou-En-Lai. This
seems to he a curious ‘New Fron
tier Spirit’ of the Chinese. Chi
nese have been using the tactics
of the late Dr. Goebbels, that if
only a falsehood is uttered often
and with emphasis, it proves ir
resistable. Apparently this has
been the case with the Staff Opin
ion. As Ceylon’s Deputy Speaker
,\lr. Hugh Fernando puts it, China
has not been practising Panch
Shcela but “Pancha-Heela” the
doctrine of lying.

NOW LET l's turn our atten
tion to the other sector of the
border—the McMahon Line. Chi
na has created a great confusion
hy exploiting the word ‘McMa
hon’ by associating it with British
Imperialism, Let us examine this
problem. NEF. where the Chinese
claim about 36,000 square miles,
lies on the southern crest of the
Himalayas. The boundary line
here should run along the water
shed. This is a well-recognized
principle of international law.
When two countries are sepa
rated hy a mountain range the
{traditional boundary takes shape
along the crest which (divides I lie
major volume of the waters flow
ing into the two countries. The
McMahon Line is basically this,
and Indian political authority has
always been exercised on these
foothills of the Himalayan range.
The tribal people Akas. Dallas
and Bhutis paid tributes to the
Ahom Kings and later to the
British Government. Specific
proof of administrative control
occurs in the legislative enact
ments etc. of 1873, 1880, 1884,
1914, 1919, 1928. 1929, 1933 and
1950. The representatives of Chi
na and India met three times sep
arately: in Peking in 1960 with
18 meetings. Also in the same
year they had 19 meetings in New
Delhi and 10 meetings in Ran

*
I goon. The Indian team found not |
| a single Chinese law or adminis- $
i t native regulation which makes ‘
mention of any of the tribal areas $
j that they claim. ‘
The final outcome of the above I*l
, three sessions is interesting. Out
j of the 118 questions asked by the i 1?
Indian team only 59 were an- t .,
swered by the Chinese team. The j?
Indian side answered all the 57 _
questions put by the Chinese
team except one. Based on all
relevant considerations a formal
Treaty was signed in 1914 be
lt ween India and Tibet. Tibet at
[that time had the power to sign
treaties to negotiate its bounda
ries directly with its neighbors.
I The Chinese Government had rec- j
ogni/ed these rights enjoyed by
Tibet. China abstained at the end
j of the Convention from ratifying
jit, not because of the definition
|of the McMahon Line, but be-1
ieau.se of the definition of the)
;boundary between Inner and

Outer Tibet.
When wrong maps started ap |
peering in the Chinese press, In
dia brought it to the Chinese at- I
tention. On October 18, 1954 when |
Nehru was in Peking, he pointed J
out the maps which showed 50,- j I
000 square miles of Indian lerri- I
tory as Chinese, Chou-En-Lai I
said that they were merely a re-,
production of the' old Kuomin-j
tang maps and that they would j
be revised. On November 28. 1956
when Chou-En-Lai visited India, j
he agreed with Nehru that there j
was no major dispute between:
China and India on border.
Has ‘Nehru lost friends among j
the neutrals he once led’, and has
China made more friends by
| opening fire and ceasing fire at j
her will? Does the Chinese with-
S drawal indicate “an act which
1 gives the impression of non-ag
gression . . .”? The member of I
| the recent Colombo Conference!
have in essence arrived at the j
Sept. 8 position. Even the com
! munist parties of Italy, France
[ and East Germany have seen
! through the McMahon mist cre
ated by China.
I If China is interested in peace
j and goodwill, India, as Nehru has
I pointed out, would agree to put-1
1 ting the question to an Inter-1
national Court. Mao, however,
j does not love peace as much as
| some would like him to. “What
are a couple of hundred million
j people?” said Mao once to Rob
ert Sherrod, Editor of Saturday
| Evening Post referring to nu
| clear war. India does not plan to
crucify itself, so that humanity
j be saved. A philosophy of a more

As a matter of fact the boun
\ dary between Ladakh and Tibet
: was so well-known and accepted
by both sides that the communi
cation of 1847 from the Chinese
Imperial Commissioner at Canton
j to the British authorities reads:

"Respecting the frontiers, I
beg to remark that the borders
of these territories have been
sufficiently and distinctly fixed,
so that it will be best to adhere
to this ancient arrangement and
it will prove far more convenient
to abstain from any additional
measures for fixing them.’’
HOW TURN l)OKS this ‘indi
cate that China wasn’t necessari
ly an aggressor in taking the
land to build the road’? What was
this ‘ancient arrangement’ and
‘distinctly fixed borders’? The
Royal Chronicle of the Kings of
Ladakh written in the 17th Cen
tury A.D. refers to records of
10th Century A.D. where Imis
Pass was on the border of La
dakh and Tibet. The border be
tween Ladakh and Tibet was even
clear to the Italian traveller Ip
polito Desideri who travelled
from Leh to Lhasa in 1715. He
makes it clear that the boundary

j lay between Demchok and Tash-
I gong which is in accordance with
; the present Indian alignment.
How could the boundary which
| was so ‘distinctly fixed’ become
suddenly hazy to the Chinese
) eye? The territorial ambitions of
| China are no secret to anyone. A
| strong China has always been an
expansionist China. In 618-907
; A.D.. under the T'ang emperors,
| parts of what is now called the
| U.S.S.R. and the whole of Af
j ghanistan were forced to recog
nize Chinese authority. In 1280-
1 1644 under the Yuan rulers the
i Chinese overthrew Burma, Thai-
I land and Indo-China and landed
j troops in Indonesio. The entire
j Muslim world was terrorized by
I the exaction of an annual tribute
j from the holy city of Mecca.
THE STAFF OPINION holds
j that “This year’s activities were
started on India’s initiative. She
began gobbling up Chinese
posts.” India has been putting
checkposts for a long time in the
frontier regions after she be
came suspicious of the Chinese
motives. These checkposts were
only symbolic of the sovereignty
I of India in this territory but were
j not meant to be military offen
j sives. They were few and far be
| tween and with inadequate sup
ply lines and policed by few Ja
wans (GL’s). It was China alone
that was responsible for ‘this
year's activities’ i.e., of 1962 by
indulging in military build up
! secretly and opening new road
j in Ladakh from 78° 35’ E, 35° 0’
! 33” N to the west of 79° 10’ E, 34°
143’ N and thence southward to
j 79° 8’ E, 34° 33’ N. Starting on
110 th of July, 1962, the Chinese
I created a dangerous and tense sit

\ nation by encircling an Indian
post at 78° 38’ E, 34° 39’ 45” N on
the Galwan river for several days.
The Indian Government did not
send any enforcements to prevent
any further developments. By
August of 1962 China had estab-1
lished 18 new outposts deep in |
side Indian Territory in Chip
Chap, Galwan Valley, Pangong,
Sprangur, and Qura Qush region.
Far from having a claim (not
to talk of good) the Chinese have
given the impression of a bunch
of thugs who cannot decide
among themselves how much
ransom they want. They have
changed their maps even while
the talks were in progress. In
Ladakh for example the align
ment shown in 1960 map covered 1
2000 square miles more of Indian j

territory than of 1959, which was
endorsed by Chou-En-Lai. This
seems to he a curious ‘New Fron
tier Spirit’ of the Chinese. Chi
nese have been using the tactics
of the late Dr. Goebbels, that if
only a falsehood is uttered often
and with emphasis, it proves ir
resistable. Apparently this has
been the case with the Staff Opin
ion. As Ceylon’s Deputy Speaker
,\lr. Hugh Fernando puts it, China
has not been practising Panch
Shcela but “Pancha-Heela” the
doctrine of lying.

NOW LET l's turn our atten
tion to the other sector of the
border—the McMahon Line. Chi
na has created a great confusion
hy exploiting the word ‘McMa
hon’ by associating it with British
Imperialism, Let us examine this
problem. NEF. where the Chinese
claim about 36,000 square miles,
lies on the southern crest of the
Himalayas. The boundary line
here should run along the water
shed. This is a well-recognized
principle of international law.
When two countries are sepa
rated hy a mountain range the
{traditional boundary takes shape
along the crest which (divides I lie
major volume of the waters flow
ing into the two countries. The
McMahon Line is basically this,
and Indian political authority has
always been exercised on these
foothills of the Himalayan range.
The tribal people Akas. Dallas
and Bhutis paid tributes to the
Ahom Kings and later to the
British Government. Specific
proof of administrative control
occurs in the legislative enact
ments etc. of 1873, 1880, 1884,
1914, 1919, 1928. 1929, 1933 and
1950. The representatives of Chi
na and India met three times sep
arately: in Peking in 1960 with
18 meetings. Also in the same
year they had 19 meetings in New
Delhi and 10 meetings in Ran

*
I goon. The Indian team found not |
| a single Chinese law or adminis- $
i t native regulation which makes ‘
mention of any of the tribal areas $
j that they claim. ‘
The final outcome of the above I*l
, three sessions is interesting. Out
j of the 118 questions asked by the i 1?
Indian team only 59 were an- t .,
swered by the Chinese team. The j?
Indian side answered all the 57 _
questions put by the Chinese
team except one. Based on all
relevant considerations a formal
Treaty was signed in 1914 be
lt ween India and Tibet. Tibet at
[that time had the power to sign
treaties to negotiate its bounda
ries directly with its neighbors.
I The Chinese Government had rec- j
ogni/ed these rights enjoyed by
Tibet. China abstained at the end
j of the Convention from ratifying
jit, not because of the definition
|of the McMahon Line, but be-1
ieau.se of the definition of the)
;boundary between Inner and

Outer Tibet.
When wrong maps started ap |
peering in the Chinese press, In
dia brought it to the Chinese at- I
tention. On October 18, 1954 when |
Nehru was in Peking, he pointed J
out the maps which showed 50,- j I
000 square miles of Indian lerri- I
tory as Chinese, Chou-En-Lai I
said that they were merely a re-,
production of the' old Kuomin-j
tang maps and that they would j
be revised. On November 28. 1956
when Chou-En-Lai visited India, j
he agreed with Nehru that there j
was no major dispute between:
China and India on border.
Has ‘Nehru lost friends among j
the neutrals he once led’, and has
China made more friends by
| opening fire and ceasing fire at j
her will? Does the Chinese with-
S drawal indicate “an act which
1 gives the impression of non-ag
gression . . .”? The member of I
| the recent Colombo Conference!
have in essence arrived at the j
Sept. 8 position. Even the com
! munist parties of Italy, France
[ and East Germany have seen
! through the McMahon mist cre
ated by China.
I If China is interested in peace
j and goodwill, India, as Nehru has
I pointed out, would agree to put-1
1 ting the question to an Inter-1
national Court. Mao, however,
j does not love peace as much as
| some would like him to. “What
are a couple of hundred million
j people?” said Mao once to Rob
ert Sherrod, Editor of Saturday
| Evening Post referring to nu
| clear war. India does not plan to
crucify itself, so that humanity
j be saved. A philosophy of a more

measures for fixing them.’’
HOW TURN l)OKS this ‘indi
cate that China wasn’t necessari
ly an aggressor in taking the
land to build the road’? What was
this ‘ancient arrangement’ and
‘distinctly fixed borders’? The
Royal Chronicle of the Kings of
Ladakh written in the 17th Cen
tury A.D. refers to records of
10th Century A.D. where Imis
Pass was on the border of La
dakh and Tibet. The border be
tween Ladakh and Tibet was even
clear to the Italian traveller Ip
polito Desideri who travelled
from Leh to Lhasa in 1715. He
makes it clear that the boundary

j lay between Demchok and Tash-
I gong which is in accordance with
; the present Indian alignment.
How could the boundary which
| was so ‘distinctly fixed’ become
suddenly hazy to the Chinese
) eye? The territorial ambitions of
| China are no secret to anyone. A
| strong China has always been an
expansionist China. In 618-907
; A.D.. under the T'ang emperors,
| parts of what is now called the
| U.S.S.R. and the whole of Af
j ghanistan were forced to recog
nize Chinese authority. In 1280-
1 1644 under the Yuan rulers the
i Chinese overthrew Burma, Thai-
I land and Indo-China and landed
j troops in Indonesio. The entire
j Muslim world was terrorized by
I the exaction of an annual tribute
j from the holy city of Mecca.
THE STAFF OPINION holds
j that “This year’s activities were
started on India’s initiative. She
began gobbling up Chinese
posts.” India has been putting
checkposts for a long time in the
frontier regions after she be
came suspicious of the Chinese
motives. These checkposts were
only symbolic of the sovereignty
I of India in this territory but were
j not meant to be military offen
j sives. They were few and far be
| tween and with inadequate sup
ply lines and policed by few Ja
wans (GL’s). It was China alone
that was responsible for ‘this
year's activities’ i.e., of 1962 by
indulging in military build up
! secretly and opening new road
j in Ladakh from 78° 35’ E, 35° 0’
! 33” N to the west of 79° 10’ E, 34°
143’ N and thence southward to
j 79° 8’ E, 34° 33’ N. Starting on
110 th of July, 1962, the Chinese
I created a dangerous and tense sit

\ nation by encircling an Indian
post at 78° 38’ E, 34° 39’ 45” N on
the Galwan river for several days.
The Indian Government did not
send any enforcements to prevent
any further developments. By
August of 1962 China had estab-1
lished 18 new outposts deep in |
side Indian Territory in Chip
Chap, Galwan Valley, Pangong,
Sprangur, and Qura Qush region.
Far from having a claim (not
to talk of good) the Chinese have
given the impression of a bunch
of thugs who cannot decide
among themselves how much
ransom they want. They have
changed their maps even while
the talks were in progress. In
Ladakh for example the align
ment shown in 1960 map covered 1
2000 square miles more of Indian j

territory than of 1959, which was
endorsed by Chou-En-Lai. This
seems to he a curious ‘New Fron
tier Spirit’ of the Chinese. Chi
nese have been using the tactics
of the late Dr. Goebbels, that if
only a falsehood is uttered often
and with emphasis, it proves ir
resistable. Apparently this has
been the case with the Staff Opin
ion. As Ceylon’s Deputy Speaker
,\lr. Hugh Fernando puts it, China
has not been practising Panch
Shcela but “Pancha-Heela” the
doctrine of lying.

NOW LET l's turn our atten
tion to the other sector of the
border—the McMahon Line. Chi
na has created a great confusion
hy exploiting the word ‘McMa
hon’ by associating it with British
Imperialism, Let us examine this
problem. NEF. where the Chinese
claim about 36,000 square miles,
lies on the southern crest of the
Himalayas. The boundary line
here should run along the water
shed. This is a well-recognized
principle of international law.
When two countries are sepa
rated hy a mountain range the
{traditional boundary takes shape
along the crest which (divides I lie
major volume of the waters flow
ing into the two countries. The
McMahon Line is basically this,
and Indian political authority has
always been exercised on these
foothills of the Himalayan range.
The tribal people Akas. Dallas
and Bhutis paid tributes to the
Ahom Kings and later to the
British Government. Specific
proof of administrative control
occurs in the legislative enact
ments etc. of 1873, 1880, 1884,
1914, 1919, 1928. 1929, 1933 and
1950. The representatives of Chi
na and India met three times sep
arately: in Peking in 1960 with
18 meetings. Also in the same
year they had 19 meetings in New
Delhi and 10 meetings in Ran

*
I goon. The Indian team found not |
| a single Chinese law or adminis- $
i t native regulation which makes ‘
mention of any of the tribal areas $
j that they claim. ‘
The final outcome of the above I*l
, three sessions is interesting. Out
j of the 118 questions asked by the i 1?
Indian team only 59 were an- t .,
swered by the Chinese team. The j?
Indian side answered all the 57 _
questions put by the Chinese
team except one. Based on all
relevant considerations a formal
Treaty was signed in 1914 be
lt ween India and Tibet. Tibet at
[that time had the power to sign
treaties to negotiate its bounda
ries directly with its neighbors.
I The Chinese Government had rec- j
ogni/ed these rights enjoyed by
Tibet. China abstained at the end
j of the Convention from ratifying
jit, not because of the definition
|of the McMahon Line, but be-1
ieau.se of the definition of the)
;boundary between Inner and

Outer Tibet.
When wrong maps started ap |
peering in the Chinese press, In
dia brought it to the Chinese at- I
tention. On October 18, 1954 when |
Nehru was in Peking, he pointed J
out the maps which showed 50,- j I
000 square miles of Indian lerri- I
tory as Chinese, Chou-En-Lai I
said that they were merely a re-,
production of the' old Kuomin-j
tang maps and that they would j
be revised. On November 28. 1956
when Chou-En-Lai visited India, j
he agreed with Nehru that there j
was no major dispute between:
China and India on border.
Has ‘Nehru lost friends among j
the neutrals he once led’, and has
China made more friends by
| opening fire and ceasing fire at j
her will? Does the Chinese with-
S drawal indicate “an act which
1 gives the impression of non-ag
gression . . .”? The member of I
| the recent Colombo Conference!
have in essence arrived at the j
Sept. 8 position. Even the com
! munist parties of Italy, France
[ and East Germany have seen
! through the McMahon mist cre
ated by China.
I If China is interested in peace
j and goodwill, India, as Nehru has
I pointed out, would agree to put-1
1 ting the question to an Inter-1
national Court. Mao, however,
j does not love peace as much as
| some would like him to. “What
are a couple of hundred million
j people?” said Mao once to Rob
ert Sherrod, Editor of Saturday
| Evening Post referring to nu
| clear war. India does not plan to
crucify itself, so that humanity
j be saved. A philosophy of a more

from Leh to Lhasa in 1715. He
makes it clear that the boundary

j lay between Demchok and Tash-
I gong which is in accordance with
; the present Indian alignment.
How could the boundary which
| was so ‘distinctly fixed’ become
suddenly hazy to the Chinese
) eye? The territorial ambitions of
| China are no secret to anyone. A
| strong China has always been an
expansionist China. In 618-907
; A.D.. under the T'ang emperors,
| parts of what is now called the
| U.S.S.R. and the whole of Af
j ghanistan were forced to recog
nize Chinese authority. In 1280-
1 1644 under the Yuan rulers the
i Chinese overthrew Burma, Thai-
I land and Indo-China and landed
j troops in Indonesio. The entire
j Muslim world was terrorized by
I the exaction of an annual tribute
j from the holy city of Mecca.
THE STAFF OPINION holds
j that “This year’s activities were
started on India’s initiative. She
began gobbling up Chinese
posts.” India has been putting
checkposts for a long time in the
frontier regions after she be
came suspicious of the Chinese
motives. These checkposts were
only symbolic of the sovereignty
I of India in this territory but were
j not meant to be military offen
j sives. They were few and far be
| tween and with inadequate sup
ply lines and policed by few Ja
wans (GL’s). It was China alone
that was responsible for ‘this
year's activities’ i.e., of 1962 by
indulging in military build up
! secretly and opening new road
j in Ladakh from 78° 35’ E, 35° 0’
! 33” N to the west of 79° 10’ E, 34°
143’ N and thence southward to
j 79° 8’ E, 34° 33’ N. Starting on
110 th of July, 1962, the Chinese
I created a dangerous and tense sit

\ nation by encircling an Indian
post at 78° 38’ E, 34° 39’ 45” N on
the Galwan river for several days.
The Indian Government did not
send any enforcements to prevent
any further developments. By
August of 1962 China had estab-1
lished 18 new outposts deep in |
side Indian Territory in Chip
Chap, Galwan Valley, Pangong,
Sprangur, and Qura Qush region.
Far from having a claim (not
to talk of good) the Chinese have
given the impression of a bunch
of thugs who cannot decide
among themselves how much
ransom they want. They have
changed their maps even while
the talks were in progress. In
Ladakh for example the align
ment shown in 1960 map covered 1
2000 square miles more of Indian j

territory than of 1959, which was
endorsed by Chou-En-Lai. This
seems to he a curious ‘New Fron
tier Spirit’ of the Chinese. Chi
nese have been using the tactics
of the late Dr. Goebbels, that if
only a falsehood is uttered often
and with emphasis, it proves ir
resistable. Apparently this has
been the case with the Staff Opin
ion. As Ceylon’s Deputy Speaker
,\lr. Hugh Fernando puts it, China
has not been practising Panch
Shcela but “Pancha-Heela” the
doctrine of lying.

NOW LET l's turn our atten
tion to the other sector of the
border—the McMahon Line. Chi
na has created a great confusion
hy exploiting the word ‘McMa
hon’ by associating it with British
Imperialism, Let us examine this
problem. NEF. where the Chinese
claim about 36,000 square miles,
lies on the southern crest of the
Himalayas. The boundary line
here should run along the water
shed. This is a well-recognized
principle of international law.
When two countries are sepa
rated hy a mountain range the
{traditional boundary takes shape
along the crest which (divides I lie
major volume of the waters flow
ing into the two countries. The
McMahon Line is basically this,
and Indian political authority has
always been exercised on these
foothills of the Himalayan range.
The tribal people Akas. Dallas
and Bhutis paid tributes to the
Ahom Kings and later to the
British Government. Specific
proof of administrative control
occurs in the legislative enact
ments etc. of 1873, 1880, 1884,
1914, 1919, 1928. 1929, 1933 and
1950. The representatives of Chi
na and India met three times sep
arately: in Peking in 1960 with
18 meetings. Also in the same
year they had 19 meetings in New
Delhi and 10 meetings in Ran

*
I goon. The Indian team found not |
| a single Chinese law or adminis- $
i t native regulation which makes ‘
mention of any of the tribal areas $
j that they claim. ‘
The final outcome of the above I*l
, three sessions is interesting. Out
j of the 118 questions asked by the i 1?
Indian team only 59 were an- t .,
swered by the Chinese team. The j?
Indian side answered all the 57 _
questions put by the Chinese
team except one. Based on all
relevant considerations a formal
Treaty was signed in 1914 be
lt ween India and Tibet. Tibet at
[that time had the power to sign
treaties to negotiate its bounda
ries directly with its neighbors.
I The Chinese Government had rec- j
ogni/ed these rights enjoyed by
Tibet. China abstained at the end
j of the Convention from ratifying
jit, not because of the definition
|of the McMahon Line, but be-1
ieau.se of the definition of the)
;boundary between Inner and

Outer Tibet.
When wrong maps started ap |
peering in the Chinese press, In
dia brought it to the Chinese at- I
tention. On October 18, 1954 when |
Nehru was in Peking, he pointed J
out the maps which showed 50,- j I
000 square miles of Indian lerri- I
tory as Chinese, Chou-En-Lai I
said that they were merely a re-,
production of the' old Kuomin-j
tang maps and that they would j
be revised. On November 28. 1956
when Chou-En-Lai visited India, j
he agreed with Nehru that there j
was no major dispute between:
China and India on border.
Has ‘Nehru lost friends among j
the neutrals he once led’, and has
China made more friends by
| opening fire and ceasing fire at j
her will? Does the Chinese with-
S drawal indicate “an act which
1 gives the impression of non-ag
gression . . .”? The member of I
| the recent Colombo Conference!
have in essence arrived at the j
Sept. 8 position. Even the com
! munist parties of Italy, France
[ and East Germany have seen
! through the McMahon mist cre
ated by China.
I If China is interested in peace
j and goodwill, India, as Nehru has
I pointed out, would agree to put-1
1 ting the question to an Inter-1
national Court. Mao, however,
j does not love peace as much as
| some would like him to. “What
are a couple of hundred million
j people?” said Mao once to Rob

| clear war. India does not plan to
crucify itself, so that humanity
j be saved. A philosophy of a more

j ghanistan were forced to recog
nize Chinese authority. In 1280-
1 1644 under the Yuan rulers the
i Chinese overthrew Burma, Thai-
I land and Indo-China and landed
j troops in Indonesio. The entire
j Muslim world was terrorized by
I the exaction of an annual tribute
j from the holy city of Mecca.
THE STAFF OPINION holds
j that “This year’s activities were
started on India’s initiative. She
began gobbling up Chinese
posts.” India has been putting
checkposts for a long time in the
frontier regions after she be
came suspicious of the Chinese
motives. These checkposts were
only symbolic of the sovereignty
I of India in this territory but were
j not meant to be military offen
j sives. They were few and far be
| tween and with inadequate sup
ply lines and policed by few Ja
wans (GL’s). It was China alone
that was responsible for ‘this
year's activities’ i.e., of 1962 by
indulging in military build up
! secretly and opening new road
j in Ladakh from 78° 35’ E, 35° 0’
! 33” N to the west of 79° 10’ E, 34°
143’ N and thence southward to
j 79° 8’ E, 34° 33’ N. Starting on
110 th of July, 1962, the Chinese
I created a dangerous and tense sit

\ nation by encircling an Indian
post at 78° 38’ E, 34° 39’ 45” N on
the Galwan river for several days.
The Indian Government did not
send any enforcements to prevent
any further developments. By
August of 1962 China had estab-1
lished 18 new outposts deep in |
side Indian Territory in Chip
Chap, Galwan Valley, Pangong,
Sprangur, and Qura Qush region.
Far from having a claim (not
to talk of good) the Chinese have
given the impression of a bunch
of thugs who cannot decide
among themselves how much
ransom they want. They have
changed their maps even while
the talks were in progress. In
Ladakh for example the align
ment shown in 1960 map covered 1
2000 square miles more of Indian j

territory than of 1959, which was
endorsed by Chou-En-Lai. This
seems to he a curious ‘New Fron
tier Spirit’ of the Chinese. Chi
nese have been using the tactics
of the late Dr. Goebbels, that if
only a falsehood is uttered often
and with emphasis, it proves ir
resistable. Apparently this has
been the case with the Staff Opin
ion. As Ceylon’s Deputy Speaker
,\lr. Hugh Fernando puts it, China
has not been practising Panch
Shcela but “Pancha-Heela” the
doctrine of lying.

NOW LET l's turn our atten
tion to the other sector of the
border—the McMahon Line. Chi
na has created a great confusion
hy exploiting the word ‘McMa
hon’ by associating it with British
Imperialism, Let us examine this
problem. NEF. where the Chinese
claim about 36,000 square miles,
lies on the southern crest of the
Himalayas. The boundary line
here should run along the water
shed. This is a well-recognized
principle of international law.
When two countries are sepa
rated hy a mountain range the
{traditional boundary takes shape
along the crest which (divides I lie
major volume of the waters flow
ing into the two countries. The
McMahon Line is basically this,
and Indian political authority has
always been exercised on these
foothills of the Himalayan range.
The tribal people Akas. Dallas
and Bhutis paid tributes to the
Ahom Kings and later to the
British Government. Specific
proof of administrative control
occurs in the legislative enact
ments etc. of 1873, 1880, 1884,
1914, 1919, 1928. 1929, 1933 and
1950. The representatives of Chi
na and India met three times sep
arately: in Peking in 1960 with
18 meetings. Also in the same
year they had 19 meetings in New
Delhi and 10 meetings in Ran

*
I goon. The Indian team found not |
| a single Chinese law or adminis- $
i t native regulation which makes ‘
mention of any of the tribal areas $
j that they claim. ‘
The final outcome of the above I*l
, three sessions is interesting. Out
j of the 118 questions asked by the i 1?
Indian team only 59 were an- t .,
swered by the Chinese team. The j?
Indian side answered all the 57 _
questions put by the Chinese
team except one. Based on all
relevant considerations a formal
Treaty was signed in 1914 be
lt ween India and Tibet. Tibet at
[that time had the power to sign
treaties to negotiate its bounda
ries directly with its neighbors.
I The Chinese Government had rec- j
ogni/ed these rights enjoyed by
Tibet. China abstained at the end
j of the Convention from ratifying
jit, not because of the definition
|of the McMahon Line, but be-1
ieau.se of the definition of the)
;boundary between Inner and

Outer Tibet.
When wrong maps started ap |
peering in the Chinese press, In
dia brought it to the Chinese at- I
tention. On October 18, 1954 when |
Nehru was in Peking, he pointed J
out the maps which showed 50,- j I
000 square miles of Indian lerri- I
tory as Chinese, Chou-En-Lai I
said that they were merely a re-,
production of the' old Kuomin-j
tang maps and that they would j
be revised. On November 28. 1956
when Chou-En-Lai visited India, j
he agreed with Nehru that there j
was no major dispute between:
China and India on border.
Has ‘Nehru lost friends among j
the neutrals he once led’, and has
China made more friends by
| opening fire and ceasing fire at j
her will? Does the Chinese with-
S drawal indicate “an act which
1 gives the impression of non-ag
gression . . .”? The member of I
| the recent Colombo Conference!
have in essence arrived at the j
Sept. 8 position. Even the com
! munist parties of Italy, France
[ and East Germany have seen
! through the McMahon mist cre
ated by China.
I If China is interested in peace
j and goodwill, India, as Nehru has
I pointed out, would agree to put-1
1 ting the question to an Inter-1
national Court. Mao, however,
j does not love peace as much as
| some would like him to. “What
are a couple of hundred million
j people?” said Mao once to Rob
ert Sherrod, Editor of Saturday
| Evening Post referring to nu
| clear war. India does not plan to
crucify itself, so that humanity
j be saved. A philosophy of a more
human timbre has always ema-'
* nated from India.
