# Palmer Enters Phoenix Open
## 
### 
PHOENIX, Aiiz. (UPI) Ar
nold Palmer goes out in quest of
his third consecutive Phoenix
Open championship today when
he tees off in the $35,000 event at
Arizona Country Club.
While Jack Nicklaus and Gary
Player probably will be rated as
co-favorites in this one, the great
Palmer figures this is his lucky
town and he’s playing well
enough to win any tournament.
He beat Doug Sanders in a play
off for the crown in 19(31 and he
won in a walkaway last year.
But Nicklaus, the National
Open champion, comes off a bril
liantly-executed slaughter of
Player in the playoff of the Palm
Springs Golf Classic marathon,
an event that took 108 holes to
decide.
Sun Helped
Nicklaus had been a reluctant
entrant in that event because of
bursitis in his hip. But the sun
thawed him out. And he’ll have
more sun here. The weatherman
says temperatures will be in the
80s all week.
Player probably will come back
fighting mad. He had been per
forming near-perfect golf for five
weeks before that Palm Springs
playoff. Then he was trounced by
8 strokes, with Nicklaus shooting
a 65 against Gary’s 73.
“You learn something, though,
in losing like that,” says Gary,
who has finished second three
times and won once in five
starts this year. “I ruined my
chances with a gamble when I
should hitve played it safe on that
12th hole. I’ll know better next
time.”
That was the hole in which the
little South African, the United
States PGA champion, hit three
palm trees and a trap and wound
up taking a triple bogey seven.
He already was three down at the
time and from there on Nicklaus
coasted.
Top Men Competing
Other top stars competing here,

including Gene Lit tier and Billy
Casper, are ready to get into the
act, too. Littler closed out his per
formance at Palm Springs with a
64, and Casper, winner of the
Bing Crosby, is at the peak of
his game.

forming near-perfect golf for five
weeks before that Palm Springs
playoff. Then he was trounced by
8 strokes, with Nicklaus shooting
a 65 against Gary’s 73.
“You learn something, though,
in losing like that,” says Gary,
who has finished second three
times and won once in five
starts this year. “I ruined my
chances with a gamble when I
should hitve played it safe on that
12th hole. I’ll know better next
time.”
That was the hole in which the
little South African, the United
States PGA champion, hit three
palm trees and a trap and wound
up taking a triple bogey seven.
He already was three down at the
time and from there on Nicklaus
coasted.
Top Men Competing
Other top stars competing here,

including Gene Lit tier and Billy
Casper, are ready to get into the
act, too. Littler closed out his per
formance at Palm Springs with a
64, and Casper, winner of the
Bing Crosby, is at the peak of
his game.
PHOENIX, Aiiz. (UPI) Ar
nold Palmer goes out in quest of
his third consecutive Phoenix
Open championship today when
he tees off in the $35,000 event at
Arizona Country Club.
While Jack Nicklaus and Gary
Player probably will be rated as
co-favorites in this one, the great
Palmer figures this is his lucky
town and he’s playing well
enough to win any tournament.
He beat Doug Sanders in a play
off for the crown in 19(31 and he
won in a walkaway last year.
But Nicklaus, the National
Open champion, comes off a bril
liantly-executed slaughter of
Player in the playoff of the Palm
Springs Golf Classic marathon,
an event that took 108 holes to
decide.
Sun Helped
Nicklaus had been a reluctant
entrant in that event because of
bursitis in his hip. But the sun
thawed him out. And he’ll have
more sun here. The weatherman
says temperatures will be in the
80s all week.
Player probably will come back
fighting mad. He had been per
