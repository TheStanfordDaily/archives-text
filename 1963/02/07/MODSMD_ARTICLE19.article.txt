### 
Several more nationally-rank
ing spike stars, including Charlie
Clark and Dennis Johnson, have
joined the fold for the new Gold
en Gate Invitational Indoor track
meet at the Cow Palace Friday
evening, Feb. 15.
Clark and Johnson join such
other standouts as Olympic cham
pions Wilma Rudolph, Ralph Bos
ton, Parry O’Brien and Otis Da
vis, John Thomas, George Kerr,
Ulis Williams, Hayes Jones, Joe
Faust, Jack Yerman, Gene John
son and Ron Morris in the fold.
Clark, the former San Jose
whiz, currently rates as Ameri
ca’s premier two-miler off his siz
zling 8:46 two-mile clocking in the
Millrose Games last Friday. The
time was one of the fastest ever
posted indoors.
Clark’s great effort established
a new American citizen's record
for the two-mile over the banked
boards, breaking Max Truex’s old
mark of 8:47.1.

Johnson will be up against two
co-holders of the 60-yard dash
mark—Herb Carper and Roscoe
Cook—in the dash.
Also joining the event were
Fran Washington, who will chal
lenge the virtually-unbeatable
Hayes Jones in the hurdles, and
Jim Ball, also a fine timber top
per.

school teacher who has been a
member of several international
squads. Ball is a captain at Ham
ilton Field.
