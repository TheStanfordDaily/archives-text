WALT HAZZARD (left) and Fred Slaughter (right) are the veteran stars of the UCLA team that will
meet The Indians Saturday night in the pavilion. The 6' 2" Hazzard is unquestionably the best play-maker in the country and although only a junior, could probably start for most pro teams. Slaughter
is short (6â€™ 5") for a center, but burly (230 lbs.) and the finest rebounder on the coast.
