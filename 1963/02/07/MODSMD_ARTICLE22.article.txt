CINCINNATI (UPI) Frank
Robinson, who said at the end of
last season he would quit base
ball, yesterday signed his 1963
contract with the Cincinnati Reds
for an estimated club record $60,-
000.
Robinson and outfield sidekick
Vada Pinson inked their pacts in
General Manager Bill DeWitt’s of
fice and immediately flew to Cal
ifornia for a vacation before
starting the grind of spring train
ing.
Pinson, who lives in Oakland.
Calif., signed for an estimated
$29,000. Robinson, a former Oak
land resident who now makes his
home in Cincinnati, received a
raise estimated at $20,000.
Asked if he was serious when
he threatened to quit at the end
of last season, his greatest in the
major leagues, Robinson said,
“Yes, but with this kind of con
tract in front of me I changed my
mind. It’s a wonderful contract.”
DeWitt said Robinson’s 1902
salary had been the largest ever
earned by a Cincinnati player un
til Robby signed his 1963 pact.
DeWitt called the 1963 contract
“a new high by far 1 .”
Robinson, who was believed to
have received about $40,000 last
year after winning the Most Val
uable Player award while leading
the Reds to the 1961 pennant,
said near the end of last season
that the physical strain of a 162-
game campaign was too much
for him and he was going to quit
baseball.
But right after the season he
met with DeWitt, and the Reds’
boss expressed a hope that the
slugging right fielder would
change his mind when he had
time to rest and think it over.
The 27-year-old Robinson fin
ished second in National League
batting in 1962 with a .342 aver
age, but led the league in slug
ging with a mark of .624 and in
doubles with 51. He clouted 39
home runs and batted in 136 runs.
Pinson, 24, slumped from a .343
batting average in 1961 to .292
last year, but hit career highs
with 23 home runs and 100 runs
batted in.
Signing of the two outfielders
brought the total in the Cincin
nati fold to 16. Only pitchers Joey
Jay and Jim O’Toole of the team’s
top players are still to be signed,
and Jay has indicated he is close
to agreement with DeWitt.

Calif., signed for an estimated
$29,000. Robinson, a former Oak
land resident who now makes his
home in Cincinnati, received a
raise estimated at $20,000.
Asked if he was serious when
he threatened to quit at the end
of last season, his greatest in the
major leagues, Robinson said,
“Yes, but with this kind of con
tract in front of me I changed my
mind. It’s a wonderful contract.”
DeWitt said Robinson’s 1902
salary had been the largest ever
earned by a Cincinnati player un
til Robby signed his 1963 pact.
DeWitt called the 1963 contract
“a new high by far 1 .”
Robinson, who was believed to
have received about $40,000 last
year after winning the Most Val
uable Player award while leading
the Reds to the 1961 pennant,
said near the end of last season
that the physical strain of a 162-
game campaign was too much
for him and he was going to quit
baseball.
But right after the season he
met with DeWitt, and the Reds’
boss expressed a hope that the
slugging right fielder would
change his mind when he had
time to rest and think it over.
The 27-year-old Robinson fin
ished second in National League
batting in 1962 with a .342 aver
age, but led the league in slug
ging with a mark of .624 and in
doubles with 51. He clouted 39
home runs and batted in 136 runs.
Pinson, 24, slumped from a .343
batting average in 1961 to .292
last year, but hit career highs
with 23 home runs and 100 runs
batted in.
Signing of the two outfielders
brought the total in the Cincin
nati fold to 16. Only pitchers Joey
Jay and Jim O’Toole of the team’s
top players are still to be signed,
and Jay has indicated he is close
to agreement with DeWitt.
