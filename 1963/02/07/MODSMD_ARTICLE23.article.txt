# Riflemen Host Cal Aim to Kill Streak
## 
### 
The Indians lake up their rifles
this afternoon in an attempt to
spoil California’s (Berkeley) per
fect seasonal record (4-0) in duel
matches. Stanford’s last outings
were against San Jose State and
Davis before the Christmas
break. The Spartans bowed to the
Indian marksmen, but the Davis
team evened Stanford’s record at
1-1.
California has boasted a cham
pionship team ever since the
NCIRA (Northern California In
tercollegiate Rifle Conference)
was organized. The Indians have
finished second for the last three
years. Obviously, this afternoon’s
match is a crucial one for both
squads.
There are five returning seniors
from last year's team, which was
ranked 11th nationally. Heading
the list is Bruce Ltteck, ranked
number 17 in the nation in in
dividual standings, and first in
the Intercollegiate Western Re
gionals (Northern California and
Nevada' last year. Mike Dunia
(who has shot at Camp Perry
with the Army rifle team), Norm
McCann. Phil Raster, and Kent
Carson are the other seniors on
whom Stanford hopes are resting.
