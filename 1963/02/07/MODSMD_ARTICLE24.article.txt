# Vaulters Need Poles, Not Skill
## 
### 
NEW YORK (UPD- Develop
ments are just about what was
predicted a couple of years back
by one-time world record-holder
Don Bragg. Bragg tried to blow
the whistle on the glass group
but his critics insisted it strictly
was sour grapes because Don was
both too big and too old to switch
to the new pole that bends and
bends and bends before it lets fly
with its human cargo.
Fiberglass Okayed
His lone wails were drowned
out last summer when the Inter
national Federation okayed fiber
glass for world record purposes,
Bui Bragg also predicted: "It
won’t be long before the world
record is held, not by a regular
pole vaulter. but by a gymnast
swinging on a fiberglass pole.”
So far the Russians, who have
made tremendous strides with
novel techniques in many other
events, have pooh-poohed the
glass pole.
“We are interested in develop
ing men. not implements,” said
Russian Coach Gavriel Korobkov,
whose programs have turned out
such record busters as high jump
er Valery Brumel and broad
jumper Igor Ter-Ovanesyan.
First 11-footer
Around 1928, Sabin Carr of
Yale became (he first 14-foot
vaulter. Then the fabulous Cor
nelius Warmerdam went off by
himself as the first over 15 feet.
Last February, John Uelses blew
the lid off the 1(5 footers.
Yang, a Nationalist Chinese

student at UCLA, is a decathlon
man whose best competitive vault
mark was 14-7 until he soared
16-3 1 4 recently.
Back in the musty files, how
ever, is a quote from Warmer
dam about an old vaulting buddy
of his, Bill Sefton, who gave up
the sport after reaching 14-11.
“He would have gone a long
way if he had stayed with it,”
according to Warmerdam in a
yellowed newspaper clipping. “He
was fast, strong and an accom
plished gymnast.”
