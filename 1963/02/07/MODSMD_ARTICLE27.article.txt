# DEFENSE OR OFFENSE
## Bill Russell or Wilt Chamberlain, Which Is the More Valuable? 
### Uy JIM DONOVAN 
Bill Russell joined the Boston Celtics at the midpoint of the
1955-1956 season and immediately became the dominant figure of (
professional basketball. Thereafter Russell and the Celtics led the
Eastern Division each year and Invariably had the highest winning j
percentage In the NBA. ,
Then three years ago Wilt Chamberlain entered the league. The
tans and experts fell that finally here was a man who could stop
Russell and who with the help of Paul Ari/in. Tom Gola and Guy!
Rodgers, could break the Celtics’ dynastic rule.
The second prediction was obviously an unwise one. for the (
Warriors were unable to defeat Boston, which has driven to three (
more championships since Chamberlain’s arrival and in his first j
year compiled a 59-16 mark, sotting all records for the most wins. (
the least losses, and highest percentage. ,
Though the Celtics remain the superior team, the controversy
over the relative abilities of the individual stars, Russell and Cham
berlain, is still the major debate of pro-basketball.
The 7’l” 255-pound Chamberlain has amassed staggering (joint i
totals using hut three basic maneuvers. His main scoring weapon is <
a turn-around fadeaway jump shot which he banks off the board <
and into the basket with amazing consistency.
His other two scoring plays are strictly close to the basket :
maneuvers. Chamberlain may fake the jump shot, gain a giant step i
on his man, jump toward the basket, anti either ram the ball through
or let it drop it. If anyone were to be so reckless as to attempt to
interfere with this shot, it would be for naught, since 1 hi* Dali only
travels downward and interfering with a ball in its downward path
is the definition of goaltending. Chamberlain can stuff the ball in
while he is facing the basket or flunk it in backwards fiver his head;
he has no preference.
Wilt scores the remainder of his floor points by grabbing loose |
rebounds and stuffing them into the basket, or. in a similar move, he
guides in some of the many errant shots of his teammates.
On defense Chamberlain’s greatest asset is his tremendous re-;
bounding on the defensive board. Ilis reach (94” finger-tip to finger-1
tip) and his quick reflexes enable him to block or discourage many
shooting attempts of the rival center or anyone else who tries to
score from near the basket.
Chamberlain was chosen the rookie of the year and the most
valuable player in his first year, but in the two subsequent seasons
he has been runner-up in the MVP selection. The winner each time
has been his major rival, in fact the only rival big man in the league.
Bill Russell,
Though the two are often compared, they are not as similar in
size as is generally thought. Russell is 6’9 r, »” tall and weighs 220
pounds. He, is then. 2'j” shorter and 35 pounds lighter than Cham
berlain. Comparing Chamberlain If) Russell is like comparing Russell
to the 6'6D" 185-pound Terry Dischinger. the excellent rookie guard
of the Chicago Zephyrs.
Moreover, Chamberlain's forte is offense, Russell’s defense. He j
is a master at this particular phase of the game. Russell plays his
man loosely around the key always ready to drop off him and to !
pick up a smaller man who may be driving through. This means I
that he often covers more than one man.
Each game Russell blocks between five and ten shots and dis- j
’ courages at least five more. He also averages 24 rebounds a game, j
and since he plays fewer minutes than Chamberlain, he grabs more
rebounds per minute than does the Stilt, o' any other star in the j
■ history of pro-basketball.
The pros score about one point every time they get the ball, for !
they hit on approximately 40 per cent of their shots and also convert j
‘ myriad free throws. Russell gives the Celtics the ball 35 more times j
than the opposing team; this mean 35 points, and probably even
more since when he blocks a shot fir grabs a rebound, it starts
I Boston’s fast break and the Celtics score on considerably more than I
■ 40 per cent of their fast break plays. Russell also puts in 18 to 20
points a game himself. He accounts, then, for more than 55 points j
each giime. J
Russell also handed out 149 more assists than did Chamberlain; ]
each of these assists is worth two points to the Celtics.
The above is a statistical analysis of the performance of these)
f two men against all the teams in the league, but perhaps even more
j revealing is the record of their competition against each other over)
the past three and a half seasons.
The Celtics have won about three quarters of the games. They j
are victorious for a reason that does not appear in the official game !
. statistics. Russell stops Chamberlain until the Celtics have the game
