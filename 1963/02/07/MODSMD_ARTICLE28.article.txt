fifteen or twenty points in the final quarter. In the first half Cham

the floor with a substantial lead.
Russell uses two basic tactics to neutralize Chamberlain's of
fensive power, lie plays neither behind Chamberlain nor in front of
him. but- rather right beside him, in this position he can dart
forward to intercept or defleet some of the many passes that are
thrown to the gigantic center and lie can recover in time to hindei
Chamberlain as he shoots his jump shot or block his drive to the
basket. Russell is the only player in the league who is quick enough,
tall enough, and strong enough to defend against Chamberlain, in |
this, or any other way.
The second defensive tactic which he employs against the Stilt
is less a demonstration of natural skills than an example of intelli
gent strategy. Russell and the Celtics’ coach. Red Auerbach, dis- [
covered that Chamberlain always shoots his Jump shot from the
exact same place on the floor, a point near the baseline, about 7 feel
from the basket on the left side of the key-hole. When the Warriors ,
gain possession, Russell runs quickly down the floor and assumes a
position on just this space of the floor. When Chamberlain arrives I
after loping down the floor as is his wont, he finds Russell in his
favorite spot and Russell will not budge. This means that the Stilt i
must now start his jump shot from a poinl about three or four feet
further out on the floor. It seems strange but this new position |
curtails the effectiveness of his major offensive weapon to a more ‘
than slight degree.
Russell's conti ibnlion to his team, then, is at least as great as
Chamberlain's and in a man to man situation Russell can stop
Chamberlain, while he himself gels his usual 20 points. It would
seem that the players and writers had good reason to select Russell
over Chamberlain as the Most Valuable Player of the NBA.
