# Philosopher from Oxford To Explain Tacit Knowing
## 
### 
The Committee on Public Exer
cises is presenting Dr. Michael
Polanyi of Oxford tonight at 8
p.m. in Tresidder, in a seminar
entitled: “Tacit Knowing: Its
Structure and Power."

Polanyi defined tacit knowing
as “things that we know but we
cannot tell” and cites as examples
such skills as swimming or riding
a bicycle which we can do, but
cannot tell somebody how to do.
Dr. Polanyi elaborates on this
concept in his publication: “Tacit
Knowing: Its Bearing on Some
Problems of Philosophy.”
