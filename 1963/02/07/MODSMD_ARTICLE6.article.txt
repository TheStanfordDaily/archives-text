## McNamara Answers Charges: No Offensive Missiles in Cuba 
### 
United Press International
WASHINGTON—The administration yesterday laid before the
American people aerial photographs and summarized intelligence
reports to back up its assertion that Cuba is free of offensive Soviet
weapons. In an extraordinary public report, Defense Secretary
Robert S. McNamara and Central Intelligence Agency Director John
A. McCone declared they were convinced beyond reasonable doubt
that all offensive weapons were rentoved from the island—and had
not been reintroduced.

To support this .statement, McNamara and his Defense Depart
ment aides appeared at a nationally televised news conference to
display aerial photographs so sharp that trucks could be observed
on highways and workers could be seen on the ground. McNamara
said U.S. military planes had flown 400 reconnaissance flights over
Cuba since the October missile crisis—an average of more than four
a day—and had found no sign of any such weapons. McCone said
all intelligence reports bore this out.
Shortly before the administration presentation, Son. Kenneth
B. Keating, R-N.Y.. renewed his charge that the buildup was con
tinuing. He also said he would eat his hat on the steps of the Senate
Office Building if he was wrong about his contention that medium
range missile sites remain intact on Cuba.

FINAL KATANGA SURRENDER— LEOPOLDVILLE The once-ro
bellious Katangese army formally ended its independent existence
here yesterday and President Moise Tshombe left Katanga amid
rumors he might be going into exile. The move was seen as another
big step toward ending the 2‘/ 2 -year secession of Katanga from the
central government.

At the United Nations, however, Secretary General Thant said
yesterday the U.N. might have to keep troops in the Congo for
another year because of the threat of a renewed Katanga secession
movement and tribal fighting in the Congo’s Kasai Province.
