# Free Will, Causal Determinism Can Co-exist Claims Davidson
## 
### STEPHEN LEOPOLD 
“It is possible for free will to co-exist and even unite with
causal determinism,” said Donald H. Davidson, professor of
philosophy, in a speech last night at Tresidder Union. The lecture
was part of the Freedom Series sponsored by the program Di
vision of the Union Board. Davidson prefaced his argument by

■stating that he would not bother
to prove that freedom of the will
exists, but would stick strictly to
sketching an answer as to how
free will is possible in the face
of determinism. He said that
everyone assumes that both they
and others do many things volun
tarily by their own free will.
However, they also believe that
there are causes and reasons for
these voluntary actions. Ho ana
lyzed this seeming contradiction
from three angles.

FIR.ST: If someone makes a
mistake or social blunder, a typi
cal reaction is “What made you
do that?”—thus implying that it
was not a voluntary action. Da
vidson disposed of this question
by saying that it was true that
the mistake was caused, but not
by the subject. It was caused by
some other agent not connected
with the subject.

Second: If free actions are
caused by an outside agent, as
the first question implies, then
these “free” actions are part of a
causal chain, and there really is
no freedom of choice. Davidson
argued that it is a mistake to
view voluntary actions as a re
sult of a causal chain because
causes do not compel action. He
clarified this statement by show
ing that all causal laws describe
actions (i.e. Law of Gravity de
scribes relationship between two
objects) and do not legislate or
command action as a Congres
sional law does.
THIS DISTINCTION between
causal, descriptive law and legis
lative law led Davidson to agree
with the third method of analy
sis; namely, that free will and
causal determinism co-exist. He
said that no matter how many
times a psychologist accurately
predicts a human action, ho can
never know for certain that he
will be right the next time.
As an example: If a glass
dropped, most people would pre
dict that it would break even be
fore it hit the floor. However, no
one could know that this predic
tion—an example of causal de
terminism would be ,accurate.
To know something will happen,
a person must have an unlimited
amount of information at his dis
posal, such as angle of impact,
hardness of the glass, and molec
ular structure of both the floor
and the glass. Even if one knows
all this, there is no definite law
that states that the glass will
break; there are only different
laws that deal with complicated
principles and are only vaguely
connected with falling glass.
THE SAME is true in human
relations, concluded Davidson.
“We can give no physical descrip
tion or determination to a mental
state. If an artist and an engineer
look at the same bridge, there are
two ideas of just what is beauti
ful.” The cause of the beauty is
determined in part by the sotting
and in part by the structure,
which the very same engineer
helped set up. Thus, the cause of
the beauty is the same for both
men, but there are two different
effects. Causal determinism can
thus be separated from free will
to some extent and both, there
fore, can co-exist.

THIS DISTINCTION between
causal, descriptive law and legis
lative law led Davidson to agree
with the third method of analy
sis; namely, that free will and
causal determinism co-exist. He
said that no matter how many
times a psychologist accurately
predicts a human action, ho can
never know for certain that he
will be right the next time.
As an example: If a glass
dropped, most people would pre
dict that it would break even be
fore it hit the floor. However, no
one could know that this predic
tion—an example of causal de
terminism would be ,accurate.
To know something will happen,
a person must have an unlimited
amount of information at his dis
posal, such as angle of impact,
hardness of the glass, and molec
ular structure of both the floor
and the glass. Even if one knows
all this, there is no definite law
that states that the glass will
break; there are only different
laws that deal with complicated
principles and are only vaguely
connected with falling glass.
THE SAME is true in human
relations, concluded Davidson.
“We can give no physical descrip
tion or determination to a mental
state. If an artist and an engineer
look at the same bridge, there are
two ideas of just what is beauti
ful.” The cause of the beauty is
determined in part by the sotting
and in part by the structure,
which the very same engineer
helped set up. Thus, the cause of
the beauty is the same for both
men, but there are two different
effects. Causal determinism can
thus be separated from free will
to some extent and both, there
fore, can co-exist.
“It is possible for free will to co-exist and even unite with
causal determinism,” said Donald H. Davidson, professor of
philosophy, in a speech last night at Tresidder Union. The lecture
was part of the Freedom Series sponsored by the program Di
vision of the Union Board. Davidson prefaced his argument by

■stating that he would not bother
to prove that freedom of the will
exists, but would stick strictly to
sketching an answer as to how
free will is possible in the face
of determinism. He said that
everyone assumes that both they
and others do many things volun
tarily by their own free will.
However, they also believe that
there are causes and reasons for
these voluntary actions. Ho ana
lyzed this seeming contradiction
from three angles.

FIR.ST: If someone makes a
mistake or social blunder, a typi
cal reaction is “What made you
do that?”—thus implying that it
was not a voluntary action. Da
vidson disposed of this question
by saying that it was true that
the mistake was caused, but not
by the subject. It was caused by
some other agent not connected
with the subject.

Second: If free actions are
caused by an outside agent, as
the first question implies, then
these “free” actions are part of a
causal chain, and there really is
no freedom of choice. Davidson
argued that it is a mistake to
view voluntary actions as a re
sult of a causal chain because
causes do not compel action. He
clarified this statement by show
ing that all causal laws describe
actions (i.e. Law of Gravity de
scribes relationship between two
objects) and do not legislate or
command action as a Congres
sional law does.
