# 'U.N.'s Red China Fight Is Political'
## 
### NORMAN REITZ 
The admision of Red China to
the U.N. is fought on the political
grounds of the representation of
China, said Dr. Richard Pederson,
senior political advisor on the U.S.
delegation to the U.N. speaking
yesterday in Dinkelspiel.
“Those who argue for the ad
mission of Rod China have two
reasons,” Pederson said; 1) 600
million people on the mainland of
China are not represented in the
U.N. and 2) if Red China were
admitted it would become a peace
loving member of the world com
munity.
Pederson countered these rea
sons with the stand taken by the
U.S. in the U.N. The Red Chinese
government does not really repre
sent the mainland Chinese; in Ko
rea, Tibet, and in India, Red China
has shown its attitude towards
peaceful co-existance; the admis
sion of Red China would not be
revocable: and membership in the
U.N. would, “give Red China a
hunting license to take over Tai-

wan.”
Prior to 1961 the Western allies
had been able to maintain a mora
torium on the question; even with
divergent national opinions they
were willing to delete the admis
sion issue from discussion. In
1961, Pederson said, the admis
sion of Red China itself was con
sidered.

The General Assembly vote on
the admission of Red China in
1961 was 48 no, 36 yes, with 12
abstentions, and in 1962 it was 56
no, 42 yes, with 12 abstentions.
The African and Asian members
of the U.N. were split in then
stands, Pederson said.

“The present situation will
probably be stable for some time
to come,” Pederson said, predict
ing the prospects of the future
admission of Rod China. But he
added, "One of the things you
learn in diplomacy is never to say
never.”
