# The 						Matchmaker' Cast and Crew Prepare for Performance
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS 
“Hell, I can’t get my shirt on.”
“Would you please button my
corset?”

“You mean Dr. Philbrick sent
! ALL the girls flowers?”
“Thus went the conversation
j backstage at Memorial Auditor

ium last Saturday, when the Stan
ford Players production of “The
Matchmaker” had the second of
its five performances. Trying to

interview cast and crew members
in the midst of this hubbub was
nearly impossible.
MARIE UHESLEV, the cos
tume designer, was busy ironing
a costume for the second act.
“Actually,” she said, “the cos
tumes are the 1890's rather than
the 1880’s as the program says.
I took some liberties with the sil
houette large sleeves and full
skirts—to help fill up that huge
stage.”

She finished the ironing and
took the costume to the proper
dressing room. “Before we made
the costumes themselves, we made
the corsets. All of the corsets are
padded to give the girls more of
an hourglass figure. Whenever
we fitted a costume, we had to
do it over the corset.”
CANDACE C A KEETON , the
prop mistress, was in the wings
getting the props ready. “This
show is inordinately simple
mostly because I don’t have to
run out in a blackout and push
things around. All of the prop
changes are done during intermis
sions.” She started arranging food
on a tray.
"The food is O.K. as long as it’s
kept in the refrigerator until
7:30 or so. Then I get it out, cut
it up, and arrange it on the trays.
We use raisin bread for meat,
parsley for greens, dried fruit,
and a combination of heels and
applesauce. Doesn’t that sound
awful? After Act 111 I wash all
the dishes in the sink backstage
and do all the linen in the cos
tume room’s washer. Then 1 take
them to my dorm after the show
and dry and iron them.”

JANE LOEB was putting on
her make-up. “I get here around
6:30 and put my make-up on.
Then, since I’m not on stage until
Act IV, I watch the first two acts
from the wings to got the feel of
the audience. During the third act
I put on my costume, go over all
my lines, and worry. I also talk
with the other actors, hut we
never talk about the show.”
Alvin Kaufman daubed some
shaving cream on his face. “An
actor should have only a light
meal before a performance. It
operates on a basic psychological
principle: if an actor is hungry,
he’s apt to be on edge and alert.”
He lit his first cigar for the
night. “All of the people in the
cast, particularly Priscilla Oliver,
are loaded with talent.”
MRS. OLIVER, adjusting the
red wig over her blonde hair,
agreed. “The entire cast is tre
mendous. Jane Loeb does a won
derful job with a very difficult
role. Sue Leich could be a profes
sional. She's an excellent actress,
and you should hear her sing. I
think Larry Madison has a great
future as a comic actor.” She put
a fur over her shoulder. “I haven’t
done any acting for four years.
But it’s been great fun for me -
Mrs. Levi is worth giving a mes
sage to the world. You know,
Wilder never writes characters
who are there for no reason. All
the roles are good, even those
with only six lines or so.”
She excused herself and went
j to the wings, preparing for her
first entrance. The backstage
chatter ceased, and the curtain
went up once again on “The
1 Matchmaker.”

“Hell, I can’t get my shirt on.”
“Would you please button my
corset?”

“You mean Dr. Philbrick sent
! ALL the girls flowers?”
“Thus went the conversation
j backstage at Memorial Auditor

ium last Saturday, when the Stan
ford Players production of “The
Matchmaker” had the second of
its five performances. Trying to

interview cast and crew members
in the midst of this hubbub was
nearly impossible.
MARIE UHESLEV, the cos
tume designer, was busy ironing
a costume for the second act.
“Actually,” she said, “the cos
tumes are the 1890's rather than
the 1880’s as the program says.
I took some liberties with the sil
houette large sleeves and full
skirts—to help fill up that huge
stage.”

She finished the ironing and
took the costume to the proper
dressing room. “Before we made
the costumes themselves, we made
the corsets. All of the corsets are
padded to give the girls more of
an hourglass figure. Whenever
we fitted a costume, we had to
do it over the corset.”
CANDACE C A KEETON , the
prop mistress, was in the wings
getting the props ready. “This
show is inordinately simple
mostly because I don’t have to
run out in a blackout and push
things around. All of the prop
changes are done during intermis
sions.” She started arranging food
on a tray.
"The food is O.K. as long as it’s
kept in the refrigerator until
7:30 or so. Then I get it out, cut
it up, and arrange it on the trays.
We use raisin bread for meat,
parsley for greens, dried fruit,
and a combination of heels and
applesauce. Doesn’t that sound
awful? After Act 111 I wash all
the dishes in the sink backstage
and do all the linen in the cos
tume room’s washer. Then 1 take
them to my dorm after the show
and dry and iron them.”

JANE LOEB was putting on
her make-up. “I get here around
6:30 and put my make-up on.
Then, since I’m not on stage until
Act IV, I watch the first two acts
from the wings to got the feel of
the audience. During the third act
I put on my costume, go over all
my lines, and worry. I also talk
with the other actors, hut we
never talk about the show.”
Alvin Kaufman daubed some
shaving cream on his face. “An

we fitted a costume, we had to
do it over the corset.”
CANDACE C A KEETON , the
prop mistress, was in the wings
getting the props ready. “This
show is inordinately simple
mostly because I don’t have to
run out in a blackout and push
things around. All of the prop
changes are done during intermis
sions.” She started arranging food
on a tray.
"The food is O.K. as long as it’s
kept in the refrigerator until
7:30 or so. Then I get it out, cut
it up, and arrange it on the trays.
We use raisin bread for meat,
parsley for greens, dried fruit,
and a combination of heels and
applesauce. Doesn’t that sound
awful? After Act 111 I wash all
the dishes in the sink backstage
and do all the linen in the cos
tume room’s washer. Then 1 take
them to my dorm after the show
and dry and iron them.”

JANE LOEB was putting on
her make-up. “I get here around
6:30 and put my make-up on.
Then, since I’m not on stage until
Act IV, I watch the first two acts
from the wings to got the feel of
the audience. During the third act
I put on my costume, go over all
my lines, and worry. I also talk
with the other actors, hut we
never talk about the show.”
Alvin Kaufman daubed some
shaving cream on his face. “An
actor should have only a light
meal before a performance. It
operates on a basic psychological
principle: if an actor is hungry,
he’s apt to be on edge and alert.”
He lit his first cigar for the
night. “All of the people in the
cast, particularly Priscilla Oliver,
are loaded with talent.”
MRS. OLIVER, adjusting the
red wig over her blonde hair,
agreed. “The entire cast is tre
mendous. Jane Loeb does a won
derful job with a very difficult
role. Sue Leich could be a profes
sional. She's an excellent actress,
and you should hear her sing. I
think Larry Madison has a great
future as a comic actor.” She put
a fur over her shoulder. “I haven’t
done any acting for four years.
But it’s been great fun for me -
Mrs. Levi is worth giving a mes
sage to the world. You know,
Wilder never writes characters
who are there for no reason. All
the roles are good, even those
with only six lines or so.”
She excused herself and went
j to the wings, preparing for her
first entrance. The backstage
chatter ceased, and the curtain
went up once again on “The
1 Matchmaker.”
