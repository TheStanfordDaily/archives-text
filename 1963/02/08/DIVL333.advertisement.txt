We’ll be on the campus on the dates listed below, ready to
give engineering and science seniors information on space
age careers in a dynamic industry.
If you are looking for a company offering assignments on
programs of unique interest and career potential, you’ll be
interested in the advantages Boeing can offer you.
Boeing, for instance, is a major contractor on such ad
vanced programs as the Saturn S-IC first-stage rocket
booster, the X-20 Dyna-Soar manned space glider, the
solid-fuel Minuteman ICBM, and the Bomarc defense mis
sile system. Boeing is also the world's foremost designer
and builder of multi-jet aircraft, including the eight-jet
B-52H missile bomber, the KC-135 tanker-transport, the
C-135 cargo-jet, and the famous Boeing 707, 720 and 727
jetliners. In addition, Boeing’s Vertol Division is one of
America’s leading designers and builders of helicopters.
Research projects at Boeing are under way in such advanced
fields as celestial mechanics, solid state physics, nuclear and
plasma physics, flight sciences, space flight and propulsion.
Expanding Boeing programs offer exceptional opportuni
ties to holders of 8.5., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in aeronauti
cal, mechanical, civil, electrical-electronic and industrial
engineering, and in engineering mechanics, engineering
physics as well as in mathematics and physics. Assign
ments are available in Washington, Pennsylvania, Kansas,
Louisiana, Alabama, California and Florida.
You’ll work in a small group where individual ability and
initiative get plenty of visibility. You’ll enjoy many other
advantages, including an opportunity to take graduate
studies at company expense to help you get ahead faster.
Drop in to your Placement Office and arrange for an
interview. We’re looking forward to meeting you!
