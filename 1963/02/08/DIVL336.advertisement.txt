Where Chemistry Means Business
. . . There's More Room to Grow
In the past few years Celanese' wide-ranging
operations in chemicals and plastics, as well as
in chemical fibers, have broadened into new areas,
and this forward - looking, diversified company
forsees an even greater range of products, markets
and interests tomorrow from today’s scientific
research and development, engineering and pro
duction skills.
You needn't be "slotted” at Celanese. There's
plenty of room for you to grow—not only room
and opportunity, but encouragement to grow. For
only through the growth of its individual em
ployees will this vigorous company be able to
meet its great, diverse tasks of tomorrow.
Wherever your technical interests lie—in chemi
cals, plastics or fibers—there are opportunities for
Chemists, Physicists and Engineers of all kinds—
in research and development, in manufacturing,
in technical service, in marketing.
