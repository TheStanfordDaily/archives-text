If you have trouble saying it...
Say it with a Parker
If you're a little shy and have difficulty say
ing "I love you" or even "I like you very
much"—say it with a Parker.
The new Parker Arrow makes a beauti
fully expressive gift and looks as if you paid
a small fortune for it. It only costs $3.95,
however, which should leave you with
enough date money for an impressive pres
entation ceremony in romantic surround
ings such as the second booth from the
back in your local drugstore.
The new Parker Arrow comes in black.
dark blue, light blue, light gray, and bright
red, with a choice of four instantly replace
able solid 14K gold points. Gift-boxed with
five free cartridges.
P. S.To girls: a Parker Arrow—besides being
a very romantic gift—comes in one size (the
right one), should last at least ten times
longer than a scarf or a lie, and should
bring in a harvest of correspondence you'll
cherish the rest of your life.
