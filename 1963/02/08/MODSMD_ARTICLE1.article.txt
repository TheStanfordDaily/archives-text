### 
United Press International
WASHINGTON President Kennedy said yesterday it would be
“a disaster” for the North Atlantic alliance to be divided in what he
said is still a time of peril from communism. Asked at his now con
ference about French President De Gaulle’s opposition to British
entry into the Common Market and to multilateral nuclear arrange
ments, Kennedy noted Europe and North America are still “in
stormy seas” of Soviet pressure. “It would be a mistake for us to be
divided when unity is essential,” he said. “That must not take place.”
It was one of the President’s most blunt statements so far regarding
the French president who has upset plans for European economic
unity and common nuclear defense arrangements.
President Kennedy also declared that the world would be faced
with the greatest crisis in its history if the United States ever again
should detect Soviet offensive missiles in Cuba. He repeatedly
asserted that the US has no evidence of any such weapons on the
island now. He conceded missiles could be concealed in Cuba. But
he said the Soviets would have to put them on launch pads to use
them and "we will find them when they do.”
FRENCH GOVERNMENT REBUFFS RUSSIA PARIS President
Charles de Gaulle’s government yesterday banned an interview with
Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev from the French television network
in a sharp public rebuff that dropped Paris-Moscow relations to their
lowest ebb in months. The stinging slap at Khrushchev was ordered
because he allegedly reneged on a pledge to steer clear of any
political propaganda remarks in the filmed interview with the state
operated French network. The tension between France and the
Soviet Union appear to dispel a recent spate of rumors that De
Gaulle was trying to set up a “Paris-Moscow axis” as part of his
so-called “grand design” for a French-dominated European third
bloc.
