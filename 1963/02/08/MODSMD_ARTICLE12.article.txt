# STAFF OPINION
## 'M' — But Not for 'Mother' 
### HOWARD I. WEINBERG 
Man seeks privacy—even gregarious man. And one place
ho insists upon being alone with himself or with his favorite
reading material is the toilet.
The scientist who said he had his best thoughts while taking
a shower probably was not being entirely honest with us. Ac
curacy was sacrificed to modesty.
But I will be frank with you. My privacy was invaded yes
terday. I glanced up at the closed gray metal door in front of
me and saw a purple mimeo sheet with a big “M” scrawled on it.
The first association was Mother. But that’s ridiculous, I
thought. I dismissed the idea as quickly as I must have my
mother when she fried to assist in my early toilet training.
The next thought was Murder. And that was particularly
disturbing for I had visions of Janet Leigh in "Psycho” clutch
ing at the shower curtain. The movies seldom entered the do
main of the bathroom. With the exception of Jack Kerouac’s
“Pull My Daisy” and Zurlini’s “Girl with a Suitcase,” I couldn’t
recall anyone answering the call of nature on the screen. But
murder was more disturbing than this lack of realism.
“M” is a film about a pathological child murderer starring
Peter Lorre and directed by Fritz Lang, a master of German
realism, the purple mimeo told me. The movie is presented by a
group of film students who call themselves Film Forum and
show a motion picture classic every Sunday night at 7:30 in 274
Tresidder Union.
Ordinarily I’d object to this intrusion upon my privacy, but
later I caught hold of the fellow putting up the purple mimeos
and asked him a few questions. His name is Jim Black, a gradu
ate student in the broadcasting and film division of the Com
munications depart merit. He’s a top flight professional photog
rapher and has a list of other talents, not the least of which is
knowing how to publicize his projects.
When I told him that his marketing technique was particu
larly effective, he asked if I would come to see “M.”
“I’ll go just because of the advertising,” I said.
“There are much better reasons. For one this is a movie by
one of the all-time great directors, Fritz Lang. You may not
know much about Lang, but you’ve heard of Lorre, Peter Lorre,
I suppose?” Black said.
“Is Boris Karloff in this, too?” I asked.
“No. but Lorre kills little girls. He’s delightful. This was
his best performance,” he replied.
I tried not to show’ my excitement and attempted to ask
him questions of a less emotional nature. “When was this movie
made? Does it have sound?”
“In 1931. It has sound—with plenty of screams,” he said
with a quick smile. ,
“What about other weeks? You have a film each Sunday
night?”
“That’s right,” he said unrolling a piece of paper. “On Feb
ruary 17, we have Charlie Chaplin in “The Kid.” On February
24, Orson Welles’ picture, “The Magnificent Ambersons.” And
then "Rashomon,” a Japanese film directed by Kurosawa who
made "The Seven Sammurai”; “Los Olvidados,” a Mexican film
on juvenile delinquency by Bunuel; Rene Clair’s “Le Million,” in
French of course, and another Japanese film, “Ugetsu.”
As you might guess, he sold me a two-dollar membership in
Film Forum. He gave me a blue card with the Latin inscription,
‘Veni Vidi Obihi,” and an idea that made sense:
“If you want to read the best literature of every age, you
merely go to a library,” Black said. “But to see a great motion
picture is much more difficult. There are film libraries, but only
in major cities, and there is a rental fee which is usually a
minimum of $25. We are offering people a chance to see seven
of these films for $2.”
I go to the Thursday night University film series and I
asked him about that.
“I see those, too. They are recent foreign films. Our films
are of historical importance as well as being equally great en
tertianment. You’d pick up the latest Russian novel, “One Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,” and read that as well as “The
Brothers Karamazov.” And if you haven’t read Dostoevsky
maybe you should. The larger a library the better. The more
good films you can see the better.”
I thanked Jim Black who hurried off to put up some more
purple mimeos-on bulletin boards.
