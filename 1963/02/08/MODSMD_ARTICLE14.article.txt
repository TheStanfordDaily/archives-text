# STAFF OPINION
## Opinions Differ on Partisan Politics 
### Michael Saks 
(Editors' note: This is the last of a three-part series on par
tisan polities on the Stanford earn pus.)

This open marketplace idea of a university is shared by
many students, but not by all. Mike Walsh presented some
questions to think about:
1. Isn’t it possible that the Stanfords know what they were
doing when they wrote in the Founding Grant that the Univer
sity should use its facilities to inform, not to convert?
2. Isn’t there a danger that with partisan politics on campus,
the students would go too far; that slander as well as support
campaigns would develop?
3. If students arc really interested in politics, why can’t they
get into Palo Alio to meet?
4. Do twenty-year-old students really know enough about
all sides of a question to campaign and vote wisely?
5. Don’t we owe something to the Founders since we are
here to a large degree because of them?
Jim Woolsey is a strong adherent of partisan politics on
campus. He interprets the University definition of partisan to be,
“if you’re being active, you’re being partisan.” He said, “This
definition does harm to what could be a vibrant political atmos
phere at Stanford.” He stated that the ASSU would like a
realistic definition of partisan.
Woolsey proposes that Stanford use the same system for
allowing groups on campus that is employed at Harvard. There,
each group has an affidavit on file stating that the group does
not necessarily reflect the University’s position. When asked
about the feasibility of this plan at Stanford, Dean Winbigler
said it would be impossible because of the Founding Grant.
When asked the same question, Dr. Wert explained that
Stanford is in a different position than other universities. Other
schools give their trustees a free hand to determine what poli
cies to follow. We at Stanford are limited by the Founding Grant,
except for its interpretation by the president and the board of
trustees.
Woolsey also takes issue with the theory presently in vogue
with the administration that once you stop sitting back and
listening and start doing, you are no longer educating.
The isolated setting of Stanford is another reason why
Woolsey believes that partisan politics should be allowed on
campus. He stated that “denial of the right to meet creates an
artificial, apolitical political atmosphere.”
As for the Political Union, “it isn’t doing a sufficient job of
inspiring political interest on campus,” he sad.
Dr. Glover mentioned that there is interest in the Political
Union only during election years. The rest of the time, the Ad
ministration works to keep the organization alive. For this rea
son, Glover believes that there is a lack of student interest in
politics. Jim Woolsey reverses the argument. In his view, stu
dent action wanes because the University makes it so difficult
for students to participate actively.
Dick Teschner, former chairman of the Student Opinion
Polls Bureau of the Political Union, has a compromise plan for
allowing partisan poltics on campus. At present, he believes that
the caucuses run by the Political Union are impotent, bureauc
racy found and somnolent. They are limited to talking. Tesch
ner’s plan is to “politicize” the caucuses, make them political
groups on campus . . . partisan, but under the control of the
Political Union. Political Union would bo in charge of co-ordi
nating room schedules and speaker dates, and making sure that
the meetings of groups sponsoring controversial speakers be
sufficiently policed.
Teschner who finds the average Stanford student "politically
naive in the extreme,” believes that his plan would make the
campus more poliitcally sophisticated and still allay the Uni
versity’s fear that, with partisan politics on campus, any crack
pot could use the campus platform,
“If you’re going to have caucuses, they might as well have a
purpose,” says Teschner., As caucuses stand, now. he sees them
as a waste of'time.

When asked about the feasibility of the Teschner plan. Dean
Winbigler said, “No.”
The recent controversy over Rosencranz’s letter concerning
KPFA has raised some hopes that the University will review
its position on partisan politics. Maybe it will. Maybe the Board
of Trustees will see fit to re-interpret the Founding Grant. But
little note from Mr. Glover to President Sterling written some
time last year should be kept in mind lest optimism and faith
in the results of student opinion and resolutions overtake you.
It reads: “In the meantime, we think it would be wise to set the
record straight that we mean business about partisan politics,
and that we are going to do the interpreting of the Founding
Grant and not have the students do it.”
