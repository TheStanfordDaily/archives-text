Editors, The Daily:
As a faculty member who is involved directly with student
speech activities, it is difficult to take seriously the current
complaints about freedom of expression. While some students
are griping about their lack of freedom to speak, other students
are out speaking.
Last Monday night two Stanford students argued before a
good audience at Princeton for a non-Communist economic com
munity. Last night four Stanford debaters spoke to the Chicago
Area Alumni Club and spent an hour responding to questions
from that group. Similar opportunities have been afforded
from Boston to Medford, Oregon before such diverse groups as
labor unions, ladies clubs, and university convocations.
“Why isn’t the University encouraging students to take
social and political stands?” A better question is: Why don’t
the students avail themselves of the opportunities they have?
In the fall of 1959, the following article appeared in the Stanford
Daily:
“CHALLENGE DEBATES OPEN TO STUDENTS—A Chal
lenge Debate Series to provide the general student body an arena
for debating any vital issue is being sponsored by the Speech
Association.
“Students wishing to express opinions on national or inter
national affairs will be provided with a room and a chairman by
the Association.”
One challenge was issued, to debate the idea “That Capital
ism is inherently unsound on both moral and economic grounds.”
Because no other Stanford students appeared to accept the chal
lenge, two Speech Association members argued the negative.
The Challenge Debate Series subsequently died of student
apathy.
Last year, on campus, students had the opportunity to argue
the question ‘That democracy as a form of government fails to
meet the needs of the 20th century.” Four Stanford students
participated and later argued the same question before massed
audiences at Reed College and the University of Nevada, The
same tournament will be held on our campus this weekend;
students may argue either side of the question: “That the powers
of the U.S. executive should be curtailed.’
Last winter quarter seventy Stanford students participated
in an intramural debate tournament, arguing either side of the
question “That the House Committee on Un-American Activities
Should Be Abolished.” A similar event will be held this spring
quarter on some controversial social or political question. To
my knowledge, no one in the University has ever placed limita
tions on the freedom of these students to voice their opinions on
any subject.
It may be argued that these students are the privileged few.
If these students have extraordinary freedom, it is because they
have earned it. While the student griper is in the coffee shop
complaining about his lack of freedom, the debater is in the
stacks preparing something worth saying. While the former is
wishing up an organization to speak for him, the latter is out
influencing the opinion of some organized group. I do not know
what this generation of debaters will do when they leave Stan
ford, but if the record of the past is an indication of the future
then an unusually high proportion of our student speakers will
become U.S. Senators, Congressmen, college presidents, top
corporation executives, U.S. Ambassadors, or hold other respons
ible positions. In short, they will continue to shape opinion
which others will happily endorse as the thinking of ‘their or
ganization.”
