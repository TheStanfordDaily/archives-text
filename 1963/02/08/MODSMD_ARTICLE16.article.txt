# Japan: Student's Zengakuren Discussed

### YOSHIKI SUGA 
Keio University—ASSU Scholar
There are many strategies that
the Japanese Communist Party
has used to advance the spread
of Communism throughout Ja
pan, taking advantage of democ
racy and freedom of speech. No
intrigues of the Communist Par
ty, however, have ever had so
mighty an effect on Japan and
the Japanese students as the
Zengakuren organization.
Moreover, today, Zengakuren
makes us think that when the
Japanese Communist Party es
tablished it in 1948, the Parly may
not have realized that Zengaku
ren would grow to be as violent
as it is today. The growth of
Zengakuren is compared to that
of a chicken, and someone com
pared it to a duck’s egg, hatched
by a hen. A hen—the Japanese
Communist Party—took the trou
ble to warm and to hatch one egg,
Zengakuren, but it proved to be
a duck’s egg. Once it grew, it
daunllessly got into the water
and swam out of reach of the
mother, i.e. the Japanese Commu
nist Party.
ZENGAKUREN is not an ex
ception among Communist groups
in our history. These groups seek
a certain ideology and then wor
ship it so that very often they
are split into various groups and
compete viciously for dictatorial
power.
Nowadays, Zengakuren is split
into two main streams, leaving
out one smaller group called the
Revolutionary Communist Alli
ance; one main stream stands for
the Communist Alliance and an

other anti-main stream which
stands for the Japanese Commu
nist Party. Today the former
group takes the initiative in Zen
gakuren and exclusively occupies
the primary administrative seats.
They are able to do this due to
the manner of electing commit
tee members. An elector writes
thirty names in if thirty commit
tee members are to be elected.
Thus a major group can succeed
in occupying all committee seats.
The main stream has been sep
arate from the Japanese Commu
nist Party since 1956, criticizing
the party as an opportunistic
group. They believe that students
have a responsibility to support
a revolution by the working
classes, that they should take the
most violent action at the front,
outside the campuses.
UNDER THIS idea, they have
demonstrated in the streets al
most every lime new affairs go
to Parliament. The main stream
thinks they should not give stu
dents and workers any rest,
rather they should drive relent
lessly. Taking the leftist extreme,
the main stream became more
and more criticized by the Japa
nese Communist Party, and, be
cause of irreconcilable disputes,
the executive committee mem
bers’of the main stream were dis
missed from Communist mem
bership. This newly established
party is called the Communist Al
liance.

Zengakuren is the abbreviation
in Japanese of the All Japanese
Students Government Association
Union. Nominally, it includes all
student government associations

of universities and colleges. But
in Japan, only a few students are
active in student government or
ganizations: the rest are quite in
different to these groups. Stu
dents generally join cultural
clubs, such as drama, literature
and tea ceremony clubs, or the
sports clubs. It is legally provid
ded in the Zengakuren constitu
tion that when a student govern
ment association of a university
decides to belong to Zengakuren,
all the university students auto
matically belong to Zengakuren.
Thus, usually without knowing
what the leaders of Zengakuren
want to do, innocent students are
drawn into it. I would estimate
the number of active students
throughout Japan to be loss than
one thousand.
I would like to show a compari
son of the two streams’ ideas to
show readers what the Zengaku
ren leaders want to do and in
what direction they are moving.
Main stream
Observation of present world:
Today the class struggle be
tween bourgeoisie and prole
tariat becomes more and more
severe throughout the world,
and the bourgeoisie intends to
get rid of this awkward situa
tion by reform or suppression.
Now is the time for decisive
strides; the time is ripe for rov
lution. Khrushchev’s co-exis
tence idea that by keeping
peace with the bourgeoisie they
can attain world revolution is
a degeneration from Marxist-
Leninist ideas and an abandon
ment of fighting.
Domestically, Japanese capi
talism has expanded through
recent booming, and Japan has
grown to bo one of the strong
est imperialist countries in the
world. Ikeda’s cabinet is the
political committee and the
first aim of the workers is to
fill the cabinet.
Revolution:
Zengakuren will fire the first
shot of socialist revolution
throughout the world and
knock down the imperialistic
bourgeoisie at a single stroke.
It is also necessary to defeat
both the Russian and Chinese
bureaucratic Communist Par
ties by political resolutions, for
they prevent the Zengakuren
revolution. In Japan they will
destroy both Japanese imperial
ism and the Japanese Commu
nist Party.
Student Movement:
Students are not of the labor
class but a middle class; how
ever, they are responsible for
acting as a trail of powder to
arouse the working class, now
set asleep by the present op
portunistic Communists, for
the class struggle.
Strategies;
Getting out of the frame of
the present leftist leaders, they
frequently make impulsive
demonstrations in the streets
in order to heighten the strife
spirit of the labor -class and to
stir up a spirit of revolution.
Anti-main Stream
Observation of present world:
Today in the world a group
of socialist countries who pro
fess peaceful co-existence and
a group of imperialist coun
tries stand by each other. In
imperialist countries and their
colonies the strife of the prole
tariat class is being manifested
in the form of peaceful strug
gle and a national independence
struggle, and day by day, so
cialistic power is taking over.

Domestically, Japan is ruled
by American imperialism and
the dependent Japanese capital
ism, and now it is a faithful
member of the anti-Communist
military alliance of the U.S.
Revolution:
The socialistic power is gain
ing in the world, so that under
a peaceful co-existence policy
the final purpose of socialistic
revolution by economic and ide
ological struggle can be aimed
at.
Student Movements:
Students are not a class but
part of the youth. They can
take initiative in the process of
revolution by their action and
ideology: however, the main
part of the revolution falls on
the laborers and farmers, i.e..
they still believe in nineteenth
century Marxism. They don’t
see how working class status
has been improved by heavy in
dustrialization.
Strategies:
They develop their actions
within the framework of the
Japanese Communist Party.
But what is the explanation of
the extensive student demonstra
tions which took place two years
ago and caused cancellation of
Eisenhower’s visit? Their immedi
ate cause was the U.S.-Japanese
treaty, which awakened memo
ries of the horror of Japan’s de
feat and atomic bombing at U.S.
hands in World War 11. Then
Japanese premier Ikeda had been
commerce minister in the war
time Tojo administration. The
love for peace is deep-rooted in
the character of the Japanese,
and it seems to belong to another
dimension which we cannot dis
cuss and analyze. In other words,
it belongs to the dimension in
which we have only to admit that
human beings desire happiness.
When Kennedy’s Cuban Quaran
tine was announced late last year,
I received a letter from a friend
in Tokyo tolling me he was afraid
of the tension and that he would
like to know how Americans felt
about it. Another young boy in
the ninth grade told me he was
so terrified that he couldn't even
go to school.
As long as the Japanese feel
the world is endangered and is
pregnant with war, they will be
distressed and troubled. This is
why Japanese scientists do not
want to help in the construction
of atomic weapons.

There are many strategies that
the Japanese Communist Party
has used to advance the spread
of Communism throughout Ja
pan, taking advantage of democ
racy and freedom of speech. No
intrigues of the Communist Par
ty, however, have ever had so
mighty an effect on Japan and
the Japanese students as the
Zengakuren organization.
Moreover, today, Zengakuren
makes us think that when the
Japanese Communist Party es
tablished it in 1948, the Parly may
not have realized that Zengaku
ren would grow to be as violent
as it is today. The growth of
Zengakuren is compared to that
of a chicken, and someone com
pared it to a duck’s egg, hatched
by a hen. A hen—the Japanese
Communist Party—took the trou
ble to warm and to hatch one egg,
Zengakuren, but it proved to be
a duck’s egg. Once it grew, it
daunllessly got into the water
and swam out of reach of the
mother, i.e. the Japanese Commu
nist Party.
ZENGAKUREN is not an ex
ception among Communist groups
in our history. These groups seek
a certain ideology and then wor
ship it so that very often they
are split into various groups and
compete viciously for dictatorial
power.
Nowadays, Zengakuren is split
into two main streams, leaving
out one smaller group called the
Revolutionary Communist Alli
ance; one main stream stands for
the Communist Alliance and an

other anti-main stream which
stands for the Japanese Commu
nist Party. Today the former
group takes the initiative in Zen
gakuren and exclusively occupies
the primary administrative seats.
They are able to do this due to
the manner of electing commit
tee members. An elector writes
thirty names in if thirty commit
tee members are to be elected.
Thus a major group can succeed
in occupying all committee seats.
The main stream has been sep
arate from the Japanese Commu
nist Party since 1956, criticizing
the party as an opportunistic
group. They believe that students
have a responsibility to support
a revolution by the working
classes, that they should take the
most violent action at the front,
outside the campuses.
UNDER THIS idea, they have
demonstrated in the streets al
most every lime new affairs go
to Parliament. The main stream
thinks they should not give stu
dents and workers any rest,
rather they should drive relent
lessly. Taking the leftist extreme,
the main stream became more
and more criticized by the Japa
nese Communist Party, and, be
cause of irreconcilable disputes,
the executive committee mem
bers’of the main stream were dis
missed from Communist mem
bership. This newly established
party is called the Communist Al
liance.

Zengakuren is the abbreviation
in Japanese of the All Japanese
Students Government Association
Union. Nominally, it includes all
student government associations

of universities and colleges. But
in Japan, only a few students are
active in student government or
ganizations: the rest are quite in
different to these groups. Stu
dents generally join cultural
clubs, such as drama, literature
and tea ceremony clubs, or the
sports clubs. It is legally provid
ded in the Zengakuren constitu
tion that when a student govern
ment association of a university
decides to belong to Zengakuren,
all the university students auto
matically belong to Zengakuren.
Thus, usually without knowing
what the leaders of Zengakuren
want to do, innocent students are
drawn into it. I would estimate
the number of active students
throughout Japan to be loss than
one thousand.
I would like to show a compari
son of the two streams’ ideas to
show readers what the Zengaku
ren leaders want to do and in
what direction they are moving.
Main stream
Observation of present world:
Today the class struggle be
tween bourgeoisie and prole
tariat becomes more and more
severe throughout the world,
and the bourgeoisie intends to
get rid of this awkward situa
tion by reform or suppression.
Now is the time for decisive
strides; the time is ripe for rov
lution. Khrushchev’s co-exis
tence idea that by keeping
peace with the bourgeoisie they
can attain world revolution is
a degeneration from Marxist-
Leninist ideas and an abandon
ment of fighting.
Domestically, Japanese capi
talism has expanded through
recent booming, and Japan has
grown to bo one of the strong
est imperialist countries in the
world. Ikeda’s cabinet is the
political committee and the
first aim of the workers is to
fill the cabinet.
Revolution:
Zengakuren will fire the first
shot of socialist revolution
throughout the world and
knock down the imperialistic
bourgeoisie at a single stroke.
It is also necessary to defeat
both the Russian and Chinese
bureaucratic Communist Par
ties by political resolutions, for
they prevent the Zengakuren
revolution. In Japan they will
destroy both Japanese imperial
ism and the Japanese Commu
nist Party.
Student Movement:
Students are not of the labor
class but a middle class; how
ever, they are responsible for
acting as a trail of powder to
arouse the working class, now
set asleep by the present op
portunistic Communists, for
the class struggle.
Strategies;
Getting out of the frame of
the present leftist leaders, they
frequently make impulsive
demonstrations in the streets
in order to heighten the strife
spirit of the labor -class and to
stir up a spirit of revolution.
Anti-main Stream
Observation of present world:
Today in the world a group
of socialist countries who pro
fess peaceful co-existence and
a group of imperialist coun

imperialist countries and their
colonies the strife of the prole
tariat class is being manifested
in the form of peaceful strug
gle and a national independence
struggle, and day by day, so
cialistic power is taking over.

Domestically, Japan is ruled
by American imperialism and
the dependent Japanese capital
ism, and now it is a faithful
member of the anti-Communist
military alliance of the U.S.
Revolution:
The socialistic power is gain
ing in the world, so that under
a peaceful co-existence policy
the final purpose of socialistic
revolution by economic and ide
ological struggle can be aimed
at.
Student Movements:
Students are not a class but
part of the youth. They can
take initiative in the process of
revolution by their action and
ideology: however, the main
part of the revolution falls on
the laborers and farmers, i.e..
they still believe in nineteenth
century Marxism. They don’t
see how working class status
has been improved by heavy in
dustrialization.
Strategies:
They develop their actions
within the framework of the
Japanese Communist Party.
But what is the explanation of
the extensive student demonstra
tions which took place two years
ago and caused cancellation of
Eisenhower’s visit? Their immedi
ate cause was the U.S.-Japanese
treaty, which awakened memo
ries of the horror of Japan’s de
feat and atomic bombing at U.S.
hands in World War 11. Then
Japanese premier Ikeda had been
commerce minister in the war
time Tojo administration. The
love for peace is deep-rooted in
the character of the Japanese,
and it seems to belong to another
dimension which we cannot dis
cuss and analyze. In other words,
it belongs to the dimension in
which we have only to admit that

ago and caused cancellation of
Eisenhower’s visit? Their immedi
ate cause was the U.S.-Japanese
treaty, which awakened memo
ries of the horror of Japan’s de
feat and atomic bombing at U.S.
hands in World War 11. Then
Japanese premier Ikeda had been
commerce minister in the war
time Tojo administration. The
love for peace is deep-rooted in
the character of the Japanese,
and it seems to belong to another
dimension which we cannot dis

it belongs to the dimension in

There are many strategies that
the Japanese Communist Party
has used to advance the spread
of Communism throughout Ja
pan, taking advantage of democ
racy and freedom of speech. No
intrigues of the Communist Par
ty, however, have ever had so
mighty an effect on Japan and
the Japanese students as the
Zengakuren organization.
Moreover, today, Zengakuren
makes us think that when the
Japanese Communist Party es
tablished it in 1948, the Parly may
not have realized that Zengaku
ren would grow to be as violent
as it is today. The growth of
Zengakuren is compared to that
of a chicken, and someone com
pared it to a duck’s egg, hatched
by a hen. A hen—the Japanese
Communist Party—took the trou
ble to warm and to hatch one egg,
Zengakuren, but it proved to be
a duck’s egg. Once it grew, it
daunllessly got into the water
and swam out of reach of the
mother, i.e. the Japanese Commu
nist Party.
ZENGAKUREN is not an ex
ception among Communist groups
in our history. These groups seek
a certain ideology and then wor
ship it so that very often they
are split into various groups and
compete viciously for dictatorial
power.
Nowadays, Zengakuren is split
into two main streams, leaving
out one smaller group called the
Revolutionary Communist Alli
ance; one main stream stands for
the Communist Alliance and an

other anti-main stream which
stands for the Japanese Commu
nist Party. Today the former
group takes the initiative in Zen
gakuren and exclusively occupies
the primary administrative seats.
They are able to do this due to
the manner of electing commit
tee members. An elector writes
thirty names in if thirty commit
tee members are to be elected.
Thus a major group can succeed
in occupying all committee seats.
The main stream has been sep
arate from the Japanese Commu
nist Party since 1956, criticizing
the party as an opportunistic
group. They believe that students
have a responsibility to support
a revolution by the working
classes, that they should take the
most violent action at the front,
outside the campuses.
UNDER THIS idea, they have
demonstrated in the streets al
most every lime new affairs go
to Parliament. The main stream
thinks they should not give stu
dents and workers any rest,
rather they should drive relent
lessly. Taking the leftist extreme,
the main stream became more
and more criticized by the Japa
nese Communist Party, and, be
cause of irreconcilable disputes,
the executive committee mem
bers’of the main stream were dis
missed from Communist mem
bership. This newly established
party is called the Communist Al
liance.

Zengakuren is the abbreviation
in Japanese of the All Japanese
Students Government Association
Union. Nominally, it includes all
student government associations

of universities and colleges. But
in Japan, only a few students are
active in student government or
ganizations: the rest are quite in
different to these groups. Stu
dents generally join cultural
clubs, such as drama, literature
and tea ceremony clubs, or the
sports clubs. It is legally provid
ded in the Zengakuren constitu
tion that when a student govern
ment association of a university
decides to belong to Zengakuren,
all the university students auto
matically belong to Zengakuren.
Thus, usually without knowing
what the leaders of Zengakuren
want to do, innocent students are
drawn into it. I would estimate
the number of active students
throughout Japan to be loss than
one thousand.
I would like to show a compari
son of the two streams’ ideas to
show readers what the Zengaku
ren leaders want to do and in
what direction they are moving.
Main stream
Observation of present world:
Today the class struggle be
tween bourgeoisie and prole
tariat becomes more and more
severe throughout the world,
and the bourgeoisie intends to
get rid of this awkward situa
tion by reform or suppression.
Now is the time for decisive
strides; the time is ripe for rov
lution. Khrushchev’s co-exis
tence idea that by keeping
peace with the bourgeoisie they
can attain world revolution is
a degeneration from Marxist-
Leninist ideas and an abandon
ment of fighting.
Domestically, Japanese capi
talism has expanded through
recent booming, and Japan has
grown to bo one of the strong
est imperialist countries in the
world. Ikeda’s cabinet is the
political committee and the
first aim of the workers is to
fill the cabinet.
Revolution:
Zengakuren will fire the first
shot of socialist revolution
throughout the world and
knock down the imperialistic
bourgeoisie at a single stroke.
It is also necessary to defeat
both the Russian and Chinese
bureaucratic Communist Par
ties by political resolutions, for
they prevent the Zengakuren
revolution. In Japan they will
destroy both Japanese imperial
ism and the Japanese Commu
nist Party.
Student Movement:
Students are not of the labor
class but a middle class; how
ever, they are responsible for
acting as a trail of powder to
arouse the working class, now
set asleep by the present op
portunistic Communists, for
the class struggle.
Strategies;
Getting out of the frame of
the present leftist leaders, they
frequently make impulsive
demonstrations in the streets
in order to heighten the strife
spirit of the labor -class and to
stir up a spirit of revolution.

Observation of present world:
Today in the world a group

Domestically, Japan is ruled
by American imperialism and
the dependent Japanese capital

Revolution:
The socialistic power is gain

a peaceful co-existence policy
the final purpose of socialistic

Student Movements:
Students are not a class but
part of the youth. They can
take initiative in the process of
revolution by their action and
ideology: however, the main
part of the revolution falls on
the laborers and farmers, i.e..
they still believe in nineteenth
century Marxism. They don’t
see how working class status
has been improved by heavy in
dustrialization.
Strategies:
They develop their actions
within the framework of the

ological struggle can be aimed
at.
Student Movements:
Students are not a class but
part of the youth. They can
take initiative in the process of
revolution by their action and
ideology: however, the main
part of the revolution falls on
the laborers and farmers, i.e..
they still believe in nineteenth
century Marxism. They don’t
see how working class status
has been improved by heavy in
dustrialization.
Strategies:
They develop their actions
within the framework of the
Japanese Communist Party.
But what is the explanation of
the extensive student demonstra
tions which took place two years
ago and caused cancellation of
Eisenhower’s visit? Their immedi
ate cause was the U.S.-Japanese
treaty, which awakened memo
ries of the horror of Japan’s de
feat and atomic bombing at U.S.
hands in World War 11. Then
Japanese premier Ikeda had been
commerce minister in the war
time Tojo administration. The
love for peace is deep-rooted in
the character of the Japanese,
and it seems to belong to another
dimension which we cannot dis
cuss and analyze. In other words,
it belongs to the dimension in
which we have only to admit that
human beings desire happiness.
When Kennedy’s Cuban Quaran
tine was announced late last year,
I received a letter from a friend
in Tokyo tolling me he was afraid
of the tension and that he would
like to know how Americans felt
about it. Another young boy in
the ninth grade told me he was
so terrified that he couldn't even
go to school.
As long as the Japanese feel
the world is endangered and is
pregnant with war, they will be

why Japanese scientists do not

There are many strategies that
the Japanese Communist Party
has used to advance the spread
of Communism throughout Ja
pan, taking advantage of democ
racy and freedom of speech. No
intrigues of the Communist Par
ty, however, have ever had so
mighty an effect on Japan and
the Japanese students as the
Zengakuren organization.
Moreover, today, Zengakuren
makes us think that when the
Japanese Communist Party es
tablished it in 1948, the Parly may
not have realized that Zengaku
ren would grow to be as violent
as it is today. The growth of
Zengakuren is compared to that
of a chicken, and someone com
pared it to a duck’s egg, hatched
by a hen. A hen—the Japanese
Communist Party—took the trou
ble to warm and to hatch one egg,
Zengakuren, but it proved to be
a duck’s egg. Once it grew, it
daunllessly got into the water
and swam out of reach of the
mother, i.e. the Japanese Commu
nist Party.
ZENGAKUREN is not an ex
ception among Communist groups
in our history. These groups seek
a certain ideology and then wor
ship it so that very often they
are split into various groups and
compete viciously for dictatorial
power.
Nowadays, Zengakuren is split
into two main streams, leaving
out one smaller group called the
Revolutionary Communist Alli
ance; one main stream stands for
the Communist Alliance and an

other anti-main stream which
stands for the Japanese Commu
nist Party. Today the former
group takes the initiative in Zen
gakuren and exclusively occupies
the primary administrative seats.
They are able to do this due to
the manner of electing commit
tee members. An elector writes
thirty names in if thirty commit
tee members are to be elected.
Thus a major group can succeed
in occupying all committee seats.
The main stream has been sep
arate from the Japanese Commu
nist Party since 1956, criticizing
the party as an opportunistic
group. They believe that students
have a responsibility to support
a revolution by the working
classes, that they should take the
most violent action at the front,
outside the campuses.
UNDER THIS idea, they have
demonstrated in the streets al
most every lime new affairs go
to Parliament. The main stream
thinks they should not give stu
dents and workers any rest,
rather they should drive relent
lessly. Taking the leftist extreme,
the main stream became more
and more criticized by the Japa
nese Communist Party, and, be
cause of irreconcilable disputes,
the executive committee mem
bers’of the main stream were dis
missed from Communist mem
bership. This newly established
party is called the Communist Al
liance.

Zengakuren is the abbreviation
in Japanese of the All Japanese
Students Government Association
Union. Nominally, it includes all
student government associations

of universities and colleges. But
in Japan, only a few students are
active in student government or
ganizations: the rest are quite in
different to these groups. Stu
dents generally join cultural
clubs, such as drama, literature
and tea ceremony clubs, or the
sports clubs. It is legally provid
ded in the Zengakuren constitu
tion that when a student govern
ment association of a university
decides to belong to Zengakuren,
all the university students auto
matically belong to Zengakuren.
Thus, usually without knowing
what the leaders of Zengakuren
want to do, innocent students are
drawn into it. I would estimate
the number of active students
throughout Japan to be loss than
one thousand.
I would like to show a compari
son of the two streams’ ideas to
show readers what the Zengaku
ren leaders want to do and in
what direction they are moving.

Observation of present world:
Today the class struggle be

tariat becomes more and more
severe throughout the world,
and the bourgeoisie intends to
get rid of this awkward situa
tion by reform or suppression.
Now is the time for decisive
strides; the time is ripe for rov
lution. Khrushchev’s co-exis
tence idea that by keeping
peace with the bourgeoisie they
can attain world revolution is
a degeneration from Marxist-
Leninist ideas and an abandon
ment of fighting.
Domestically, Japanese capi
talism has expanded through
recent booming, and Japan has
grown to bo one of the strong
est imperialist countries in the
world. Ikeda’s cabinet is the
political committee and the
first aim of the workers is to
fill the cabinet.
Revolution:
Zengakuren will fire the first
shot of socialist revolution
throughout the world and
knock down the imperialistic
bourgeoisie at a single stroke.
It is also necessary to defeat
both the Russian and Chinese
bureaucratic Communist Par
ties by political resolutions, for
they prevent the Zengakuren
revolution. In Japan they will
destroy both Japanese imperial
ism and the Japanese Commu
nist Party.
Student Movement:
Students are not of the labor
class but a middle class; how
ever, they are responsible for
acting as a trail of powder to
arouse the working class, now
set asleep by the present op
portunistic Communists, for
the class struggle.
Strategies;
Getting out of the frame of

frequently make impulsive

imperialist countries and their
colonies the strife of the prole
tariat class is being manifested
in the form of peaceful strug
gle and a national independence
struggle, and day by day, so
cialistic power is taking over.

Domestically, Japan is ruled
by American imperialism and
the dependent Japanese capital
ism, and now it is a faithful
member of the anti-Communist
military alliance of the U.S.
Revolution:
The socialistic power is gain
ing in the world, so that under
a peaceful co-existence policy
the final purpose of socialistic
revolution by economic and ide
ological struggle can be aimed
at.
Student Movements:
Students are not a class but
part of the youth. They can
take initiative in the process of
revolution by their action and
ideology: however, the main
part of the revolution falls on
the laborers and farmers, i.e..
they still believe in nineteenth
century Marxism. They don’t
see how working class status
has been improved by heavy in
dustrialization.
Strategies:
They develop their actions
within the framework of the
Japanese Communist Party.
But what is the explanation of
the extensive student demonstra
tions which took place two years
ago and caused cancellation of
Eisenhower’s visit? Their immedi
ate cause was the U.S.-Japanese
treaty, which awakened memo
ries of the horror of Japan’s de
feat and atomic bombing at U.S.
hands in World War 11. Then
Japanese premier Ikeda had been
commerce minister in the war
time Tojo administration. The
love for peace is deep-rooted in
the character of the Japanese,
and it seems to belong to another
dimension which we cannot dis
cuss and analyze. In other words,
it belongs to the dimension in
which we have only to admit that
human beings desire happiness.
When Kennedy’s Cuban Quaran
tine was announced late last year,
I received a letter from a friend
in Tokyo tolling me he was afraid
of the tension and that he would
like to know how Americans felt
about it. Another young boy in
the ninth grade told me he was
so terrified that he couldn't even
go to school.
As long as the Japanese feel
the world is endangered and is
pregnant with war, they will be
distressed and troubled. This is
why Japanese scientists do not
want to help in the construction
of atomic weapons.
