# Professor Mayhew Expresses Views on Curriculum of Liberal Arts Colleges
## 
### 
Most liberal arts colleges would
do themselves a financial and
educational favor if they threw 7
out a lot of their over-specialized
courses, Prof. Lewis B. Mayhew
of the School of Education be
lieves.
Quoting a series of nationwide
studies made by others, Prof.
Mayhew added: "Faculty salaries
are intimately bound to the num
ber of courses a liberal arts col
lege offers. “If the number of
courses can be reduced with an
attendant increase in the average
class size, it is possible over a
period of years to reduce the
number of faculty members
needed to raise faculty salaries.”
One of the arguments for offer
ing a highly diversified curricu
lum, ho said, is to prepare stu
dents for graduate work. Unfor
tunately, this doesn’t hold up be
cause few liberal arts, teachers’
or community colleges send an
appreciable number of students
to graduate school.
Mayhew also pointed out that
the belief that smaller upper di
vision classes allow for a distinc
tive type of teaching for greater
student growth is not true. “The
blunt fact is that class size has
apparently very litle relationship
to student achievement.”
Students don’t choose a college
because of a multiplicity of
courses which offer a wide pro
gram from which to choose. “Stu
dents select colleges for economic
reasons, because of the overall
prestige of an institution, because
of geography and because friends
are attending.”
When teachers choose a college,
he found, “the chance not to
teach may figure more promi
nently than the offer to teach
specific courses.” One survey

shows that the most important
rewards for college teachers are
research, stimulation from col
leagues, salary, and independence,
Mayhew reported.
“Why do faculties persist in al
lowing curricula to grow and be
come such a burden?” Dr. May
hew asks.
Perhaps, Prof. Mayhew sug
gests, the real explanation cen
ters in the confusion about the
goals of higher education.
Surveys show liberal arts col
leges are swinging more toward
technical training, while the tech
nical schools are tending more
toward the old liberal arts school,
he postulates.
He outlines some suggestions:
Teaching duties of a professor
in an undergraduate college need
not relate to the professor’s own
research specialty.
Departments should be re
quired to construct curricula
within definitely prescribed lim
itations, and there should be
tight restrictions on the number
of hours a professor might teach,
and on the number of courses he
might offer.
No course should be included
for which the institution did not
| have the requisite resources and
i equipment available.

Most liberal arts colleges would
do themselves a financial and
educational favor if they threw 7
out a lot of their over-specialized
courses, Prof. Lewis B. Mayhew
of the School of Education be
lieves.
Quoting a series of nationwide
studies made by others, Prof.
Mayhew added: "Faculty salaries
are intimately bound to the num
ber of courses a liberal arts col
lege offers. “If the number of
courses can be reduced with an
attendant increase in the average
class size, it is possible over a
period of years to reduce the
number of faculty members
needed to raise faculty salaries.”
One of the arguments for offer
ing a highly diversified curricu
lum, ho said, is to prepare stu
dents for graduate work. Unfor
tunately, this doesn’t hold up be
cause few liberal arts, teachers’
or community colleges send an
appreciable number of students
to graduate school.
Mayhew also pointed out that
the belief that smaller upper di
vision classes allow for a distinc
tive type of teaching for greater
student growth is not true. “The
blunt fact is that class size has
apparently very litle relationship
to student achievement.”
Students don’t choose a college
because of a multiplicity of
courses which offer a wide pro
gram from which to choose. “Stu
dents select colleges for economic
reasons, because of the overall
prestige of an institution, because
of geography and because friends
are attending.”
When teachers choose a college,
he found, “the chance not to
teach may figure more promi
nently than the offer to teach
specific courses.” One survey

shows that the most important
rewards for college teachers are
research, stimulation from col
leagues, salary, and independence,
Mayhew reported.
“Why do faculties persist in al
lowing curricula to grow and be
come such a burden?” Dr. May
hew asks.
Perhaps, Prof. Mayhew sug
gests, the real explanation cen
ters in the confusion about the
goals of higher education.
Surveys show liberal arts col
leges are swinging more toward
technical training, while the tech
nical schools are tending more
toward the old liberal arts school,
he postulates.
He outlines some suggestions:
Teaching duties of a professor
in an undergraduate college need
not relate to the professor’s own
research specialty.
Departments should be re
quired to construct curricula
within definitely prescribed lim
itations, and there should be
tight restrictions on the number
of hours a professor might teach,
and on the number of courses he
might offer.
No course should be included
for which the institution did not
| have the requisite resources and
i equipment available.
