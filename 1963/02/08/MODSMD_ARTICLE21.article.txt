# Ruggers Favored Over Inexperienced Ramblers
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford’s rugby team will take
the field tomorrow hoping to re
group into a winning combina
tion against the Peninsula Ram
blers. Game time is 3 p.m. on the
rugby field.
Considering the Ramblers’ rec
ord, the Indians should be able
to improve on their 2-1 mark.

Peninsula has lost tp the Olympic
Club, a team Stanford walloped,
23-11, and been beaten by Uni
versities Club, which the Tribe
defeated 11-3 before losing last
week.
THE RAMBLER backfield is
mostly inexperienced, the lone ex
ception being Walt Gomez. A
fine open field runner as well as
an excellent tackier, Gomez has

made several rugby all-star teams
and is the prime mover of Penin
sula’s otherwise anemic offense.
Another standout is John Gra
ham, who provides plenty of pow
er in the scrum as well as aggres
siveness on the all-important
lineouts.

The Rambler’s power attack
contrasts sharply with Stanford’s
running game. Backs such as

Gordon Waddell, Tim Hansel and
Clark Weaver specialize in get
ting the ball on a pitchout and
using their football talent to turn
in long runs through many
tacklers.
THK CARDS will be favored,
but anyone watching last week’s
game saw how easily an upset
can occur. Two long runs which
caught Stanford defenders out of
position broke open a tight de-

tensive game and resulted in a
13-6 Universities win.
The Tribe JV’s will meet the
Rambler second team at 1 p.m.
The JV’s have wins over the San
Francisco Ramblers, San Jose,
and the Olympic Club B team.
