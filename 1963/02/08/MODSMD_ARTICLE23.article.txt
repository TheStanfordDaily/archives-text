# Stanford Cricketeers to Meet California Cricket Association

### DHANJOO GHISTA 
(Editors’ Note: This is the sec
ond installment in a weekly
series telling of the adventures of
the Stanford erieketeers.)
Stanford’s last cricket victory
—and still more the manner of
il ensures that whatever may be
in store on Sunday, Feb. 10 from
noon to 5 p.m., when Stanford
takes on a powerful California
Cricket Association team at the
football practice field, interest in
all the matches will crackle like
a bush fire. Nothing succeeds like
success.
Overconfidence can be a dan
gerous anodyne, but in the right
measure it can be an important
asset. Stanfordites are now a
bouyant side ready to take on
any comers.
It was about two weeks back
that English with his seamers
and Kasiraji with his Chinamen
won the match for Stanford. The
visitors’ Captain went on record
as saying that they wore as sur
prised by the pitch as they wore
by Stanford’s batting strength.
Since then, we have had rains
and the pitch is expected to be
more docile than before.
This Sunday, in bowling Stan
ford will again lean heavily on
Kasi and English. Saxena, in
short spells, and Mukherjee’s
high-kicking off-breaks are po
tent dangers. In the last match,
Stanford sailed home with a daz
zling array of drives and cuts. R.

Date, W. Pyke, R. Abeysuriya
and J. Meynell are all stroke
players capable of hitting the
ball freely. In the wake of Elmo
Perara’s performance the whole
team has found a balance, that,
we hope, will flower from match
to match.
Whereas the California Cricket
Association team will hope that
the ghosts of their last visit to
the Farm have been firmly laid,
in the Stanford side there is much
excitement at the possibility of
turning the tables once more on
the Association. Psychologically
it is going to be Stanford’s match.
They are poised to strike while
the iron is hot.
