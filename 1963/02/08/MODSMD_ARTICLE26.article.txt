# STANFORD DEFENDS AAWU LEAD
## Trojans, Bruins Visit Farm 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
After a weekend of woe in the
Pacific Northwest, Stanford’s
basketball team returns to the
Pavilion for AAWU league games
against USC tonight and UCLA
tomorrow. Last week's mishaps
were a last-minute loss to Wash
ington and an impassible blizzard
which prevented the Indians from
reaching Pullman where they
were to have avenged that loss by
battering Washington State.
The loss dropped the Indians
from seventh place to eighth and
tenth in the national polls, but
they are in good shape to make
up that lost ground. All are
healthy except Clayton Raaka,
who will play both nights despite
a slight ankle sprain suffered
Tuesday.
WHILE UCLA, thirteenth in

the U.S., is the spotlight oppo
nent, USC is no pushover; (it
beat Stanford 65-57 in the L.A.
Classic'). On the other hand, the
Trojans are quite far from being
flawless: they often settle for
poor shots, make bad passes, and
commit traveling violations.
Neither are they very graceful;
their style of play, coached by
Forrest Twogood, appeals to
have been inspired by the bugle
calls associated with Los Angeles
sports audiences: a typical SC
fast break looks like a head
down, flat-footed charge with
about as much finesse as a flying
wedge*.
USC’s best known player is
Gordon Martin, the only starter
returning from 1962. Due to SC’s
lack of an adequate center, Mar
tin has been forced to play the
post, where his gangling 6-7
frame is ill-suited. He is woefully
overworked but manages to score
20 points a game to lead the
AAWU.
MARTIN is supported by
guards Welles Sloniger, a com
pact and aggressive playmaker,
and Bill Morris, last year’s Cali
fornia JC player of the year, aver
aging 26 points at Fullerton JC.

The two forwards are 6-5 Allen
Young, who has shown only er
ratic signs of living up to his
1962 freshman form (25 points.
15 rebounds per gamei, and 6-3
Pete Hillman, a converted guard.
Coach Howie Dallmar will sub
stitute freely against SC. hoping j
to prevent the Indians from being
overtaxed and fatigued for the
UCLA game tomorrow for the
AAWU lead. Much energy will
be required then to keep up with
Coach John Wooden’s fast break
offense.
It is directed by Walt Hazzard,
a 6-2 junior guard, who is the
most likely All-American on the
West Coast. During a fast break,
his composure and alertness are
unique: dribbling at full speed |
between the defensive foul line [
and the mid-court line. Hazzard
glances to both side to see who
is with him on the break; going I
down to the top of the key, he ]
concentrates on maneuvering the ■
defender*s) to one side; finally '

he makes his fake(sl, sometimes
two or three, and passes off for
the assist or scores himself.
HAZZARD isn’t the only rea
son for UCLA’s fast-break suc
cess. He is supported by two
speedy guards, Gail Goodrich and
Fred Goss, the L.A. City and CIF
players of the year for 1961 re
spectively, and Jack Hirsch, a
scrappy, 6-3 forward.
The Bruins’ team speed even
pays off in five-against-five situ
ations. Improvising a play. Haz
zard can usually bi-eak free, force
defenders to pick him up, and
then pass to unguarded team
mates. When opponents play him
to pass off, he relies on his 46 per
cent shooting which has netted
him 16 points a game.
Another Hazzardous talent is
offensive rebounding. “He jumps
like a man 6-6.” Dallmar said.
Along with Hazzard, Hirsch,
Goss, 6-3 center Fred “Bruiser”
Slaughter, and 6-5 Keith Erick
son make the Bruins “as good a
board team as Washington.” wept

Stanford in all three' games, t
STANFORD will have to com
pensate for its rebounding and
speed disadvantages by contain
ing Hazzard, mainly through the
individual efforts of Don Clemet
son and by an alert, switching
team defense when necessary. In
this way. Stanford will also keep
the tempo of play somewhat be
low the racehorse pace which
UCLA thrives on.
The Indians may also have an
advantage in shooting accuracy.
The Bruins’ outside shooting,
sometimes outstanding (42 per
cent on the season), has often
been vulnerable to cold spells,
especially during their double
loss to Washington in Seattle,
Meanwhile. Stanford should have
a minimum of trouble working
the ball in to Tom Dose through
UCLA's mediocre defense; with
a three-inch advantage over
Slaughter, Dose hopefully, will
sink a high percentage of his
shots.


UCLA SOPHOMORE FLASHES Gail Goodrich (left) and Freddie Goss,
who led last year's Bruin frosh to an undefeated season, share the
guard spot with the phenomenal Walt Hazzard. Goodrich, a southpaw, is averaging 11.1 points per game.
