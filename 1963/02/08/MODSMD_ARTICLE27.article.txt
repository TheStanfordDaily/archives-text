# HOST CAL POLY TOMORROW
## Stanford Matmen in Underdog Role Today, Against Powerful Oregon State Webfoots 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Stanford’s wrestling squad, at
full strength again with the re
turn of 157 pounder Phil Kendall,
faces a major test today against
Oregon State at 4 p.m. at Encina
Gym. Tomorrow the Indians face
Cal Poly (Pomonal also at 4 p.m.
at Encina Gym.
The OSU Webfoots, regarded as
one of the top teams on the coast,
have established quite a reputa
tion in Recent years, winning one
NCAA wrestling championship
and perenially finishing among
the leaders. On the other hand,
little is known of Cal Poly except
neither their reputation nor their
record has been on a par with the
Webfoots.
OREGON STATE has started
slowly this year, suffering two
defeats and a tie early in the sea
son. Since then, they have been
unbeaten, including a 28-0 white
wash of Cal.

“They’re a well-conditioned and
strong team,” said Stanford’s
wrestling coach Jim Easter,” and

they use pretty conventional tac
tics on the mat."
However, he feels that their
performance my not be quite as
to indicate. ‘“Against Cal, they
won three matches that they
could have easily lost merely be
cause their better conditioning
enabled them to beat their tiring
Cal opponents in the last few
minutes,” he said.
“THEY’VE GOT a real good
team,” ho said, “but Stanford is

really going to be up for them.
It should be a very exciting
match.”
Stanford’s lineup for this week
end will be about the same as last
week, the only changes being the
return of Kendall after suffering
a broken nose against San Fran
cisco State Thursday, Jon Kay at
167, and Tom Allen at 177.
Wrestling at other weights are:
George Musser, 123; Tim Davis,
130; Dan Barrett, 137; Hap Klopp,
147; and Don Buehler, heavy
weight. Buehler will probably
face the best of Oregon State’s
wrestlers, Mason Fries, at heavy
weight.
Stanford’s record up to this
weekend has been three wins and
three losses, the Indians losing
their last meet to UCLA, 23-13.

Cal Poly (Pomonal also at 4 p.m.
at Encina Gym.
The OSU Webfoots, regarded as
one of the top teams on the coast,
have established quite a reputa
tion in Recent years, winning one
NCAA wrestling championship
and perenially finishing among
the leaders. On the other hand,
little is known of Cal Poly except
neither their reputation nor their
record has been on a par with the
Webfoots.
OREGON STATE has started
slowly this year, suffering two
defeats and a tie early in the sea
son. Since then, they have been
unbeaten, including a 28-0 white
wash of Cal.

“They’re a well-conditioned and
strong team,” said Stanford’s
wrestling coach Jim Easter,” and

they use pretty conventional tac
tics on the mat."
However, he feels that their
performance my not be quite as
to indicate. ‘“Against Cal, they
won three matches that they
could have easily lost merely be
cause their better conditioning
enabled them to beat their tiring
Cal opponents in the last few
minutes,” he said.
“THEY’VE GOT a real good
team,” ho said, “but Stanford is

really going to be up for them.
It should be a very exciting
match.”
Stanford’s lineup for this week
end will be about the same as last
week, the only changes being the
return of Kendall after suffering
a broken nose against San Fran
cisco State Thursday, Jon Kay at
167, and Tom Allen at 177.
Wrestling at other weights are:
George Musser, 123; Tim Davis,
130; Dan Barrett, 137; Hap Klopp,
147; and Don Buehler, heavy
weight. Buehler will probably
face the best of Oregon State’s
wrestlers, Mason Fries, at heavy
weight.
Stanford’s record up to this
weekend has been three wins and
three losses, the Indians losing
their last meet to UCLA, 23-13.
Stanford’s wrestling squad, at
full strength again with the re
turn of 157 pounder Phil Kendall,
faces a major test today against
Oregon State at 4 p.m. at Encina
Gym. Tomorrow the Indians face
