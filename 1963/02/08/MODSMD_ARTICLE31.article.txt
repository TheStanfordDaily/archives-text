# Three Golfers Tie in Phoenix
## 
### 
PHOENIX, Ariz. (UPD—Gary
Player, Jack Nicklaus and Jay
Herbert each shot a five-under
par 67 Thursday to deadlock for
the first round lead in the $35,000
Phoenix Open golf tournament.
In a wild day of par-cracking on
the easy Arizona Country Club
course, the trio of shot makers
took a one-stroke lead over Ar
nold Palmer, Dr. Cary Middlecoff,
Jimmy Clark, Bob Harris, Tommy
Aaron and Julius Boros. They
each had 68.
PLAYER, POSSIBLY still burn
ing from the defeat handed him
by Nicklaus in the Palm Springs
Golf Classic playoff, appeared as
though he would take the lead all
by himself when he went out in
31. He had two eagles on the front
nine on par-five holes after he laid
four-woods within seven feet of
the pin.
“But I'm bloody tired,” said
Player. “I haven’t had a day off
since the start of the year.”
Coming back, Player had a 36,
missing a six-foot birdie putt on
the last hole that would have
given him the individual lead.
