THIS IS THE INSIDE of the Law Annex after the steel trusties collapsed Wednesday morning. One
workman suffered a fractured skull, but seven others in the building were not injured. The roofing
had already been removed, and the trusties were to have come down the next day. No damage
was done to the building. The Law Annex is being rebuilt and joined to the Law School. Construction is scheduled to be completed in August.
