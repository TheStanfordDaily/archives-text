# Basdevant of French Consulate Defends De Gaulle Directives
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
Great Britain’s inability to j
meet requirements for participa
tion in the European Economic
Community is the main reason
for the French veto of her bid for
entry, Pierre Basdevant, French
Consul General in San Francisco,
stated yesterday in his speech
at Tresidder.
Quoting French President
Dc Gaulle’s definition of the
French position in the current
controversy, Basdevant stated
that the structure of the British
economy, which differs from that
of the other members in that it
is primarily industrial rather
than agricultural, accounts for
Britain’s failure to accept the
conditions of the Treaty of Rome,
The Common Market was found
ed under this agreement in 1957.
De Gaulle, he continued, did
not terminate the Brussels nego
tiations on the question because
Britain was about to obtain her
demands, but rather because he
realized the depth of the gap be
tween the two nations. One of
the problems creating this gap
was the changes that would take
place if the organization were
augmented by Britain and the
other nations who are now mere
ly associate members. Economic
cohesion under these conditions
would be unstable and difficult
to maintain.

A possible cause of this insta
bility is Great Britain’s desire to
import newsprint, lead, and zinc
from other members of the Brit
ish Commonwealth without pay
ing: Common Market import du
ties. The economy of France and
Italy, both exporters of these
products, would suffer as a re
sult because the Common Market
has forced them to abandon their
protectionist policies. Another
problem is that Britain advocates
the delay of complete economic
integration, which is scheduled to
take place in 1970.
In the period of questions
which followed, Basdevant dis
cussed other aspects of the Com
mon Market, De Gaulle’s concep
tion of a united European com
munity, and Franco's relations
with the U.S.S.R.

tion in the European Economic
Community is the main reason
for the French veto of her bid for
entry, Pierre Basdevant, French
Consul General in San Francisco,
stated yesterday in his speech
at Tresidder.
Quoting French President
Dc Gaulle’s definition of the
French position in the current
controversy, Basdevant stated
that the structure of the British
economy, which differs from that
of the other members in that it
is primarily industrial rather
than agricultural, accounts for
Britain’s failure to accept the
conditions of the Treaty of Rome,
The Common Market was found
ed under this agreement in 1957.
De Gaulle, he continued, did
not terminate the Brussels nego
tiations on the question because
Britain was about to obtain her
demands, but rather because he
realized the depth of the gap be
tween the two nations. One of
the problems creating this gap
was the changes that would take
place if the organization were
augmented by Britain and the
other nations who are now mere
ly associate members. Economic
cohesion under these conditions
would be unstable and difficult
to maintain.

A possible cause of this insta
bility is Great Britain’s desire to
import newsprint, lead, and zinc
from other members of the Brit
ish Commonwealth without pay
ing: Common Market import du
ties. The economy of France and
Italy, both exporters of these
products, would suffer as a re
sult because the Common Market
has forced them to abandon their
protectionist policies. Another
problem is that Britain advocates
the delay of complete economic
integration, which is scheduled to
take place in 1970.
In the period of questions
which followed, Basdevant dis
cussed other aspects of the Com
mon Market, De Gaulle’s concep
tion of a united European com
munity, and Franco's relations
with the U.S.S.R.
