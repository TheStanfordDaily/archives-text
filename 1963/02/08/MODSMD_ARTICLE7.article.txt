# Campuses Role Unclear

### TEMP PECK 
(Second of a Two-Part Series)
The nebulous nature of the Uni
versity’s statement of the goals
of the Overseas Campuses is the
largest single fault of the pro
gram. The University brochure
never states straightforwardly
that the program is designed to
offer intensive instruction in the
local language, culture, or litera
ture. Indeed, it should not state
such goals, for the Stanford pro
gram is certainly not intensive in
these respects. But many students
manage to get exactly this mis
taken impression—either by mere
ly assuming that any overseas
program would concentrate heav
ily in these areas, or by reading
too much into the rather mislead
ing quotations from former over
seas students remarks scattered
liberally throughout the Univer
sity’s brochure.
“We walked along the Loire for
about two miles to an old abbey
where a famous French poet once
lived,” roads one quotation. An
other runs: “Germany was right
there, all around us. We had im
mediate entree into German cul
ture, German life, and the lan
guage.” And the inevitable, “The
whole of Europe is our class
room.” These quotations are with
out a doubt sincere and legiti
mate, but they give a somewhat
false impression. They suggest a
total immersion in the life of the
country a series of encounters
with charming, friendly Euro
peans a 11 dressed in authentic,
quaint native costumes. The sug
gestion is not totally inaccurate;
it is merely one sided.
WHAT THE brochure does not
say is that if you are vitally in
terested in meeting a large num
ber of Europeans and knowing
them in some depth, if you are
quite serious about perfecting
your use of the language, if you
really wish to study the country’s
literature in some detail, then you
had better not live abroad for only
: six months, taking courses in Ab
normal Psychology with eighty
j other Americans—many of whom
1 are a great deal less ambitious

than you.
The Stanford plan is almost
unique in American higher educa
tion. Most of the other programs
! are based on the “junior year
j abroad” system started by Smith
: College in the thirties. The latest
of these is Cal at Bordeaux,
i France, which will soon be joined
by two sister centers in Goettin
j gen, Germany, and Padua, Italy,
i The Cal system differs from that
of Stanford in that the Cal over
' seas students are required to have
j a greater language background.
They take tutorials at the Univer
i sity of Bordeaux, where they live,
j and they choose from a range of
I Bordeaux courses instead of from
American ones carefully imported
from Berkeley and Los Angeles.
The California Board of Regents
j specifically states that providing
“language training that would be
useful in teaching or later grad
| uate work” is a goal of the pro-

gram.
THIS TYPE of plan would not
appeal to every Stanford student
presently applying for the Stan
ford program. It would eliminate
i many who do not have the neces
i sary language background. This
j is exactly what has happened at
| Cal . Although the program is
| open to students from all the Cali-
I fornia campuses, it has managed
to attract to the present group in
Bordeaux some 28 French majors
| and 14 English majors; only four
per cent of the students presently
studying abroad major in the
Natural Sciences, and none are in
Engineering.
This may, however, be the type
of program that some of the Stan
j ford students who were disap
| pointed with the Stanford plan
were looking for. The Stanford
program as it now stands is an
i excellent program for students
and there are many of them—who
cannot get to Europe any other
j way. Unfortunately, many who
] are searching for a more intensive
j program such as Cal’s are attract
| ed to Stanford’s because the goals
j of the program are not made clear
| before application or during ori
-1 entation.

The nebulous nature of the Uni
versity’s statement of the goals
of the Overseas Campuses is the
largest single fault of the pro
gram. The University brochure
never states straightforwardly
that the program is designed to
offer intensive instruction in the
local language, culture, or litera
ture. Indeed, it should not state
such goals, for the Stanford pro
gram is certainly not intensive in
these respects. But many students
manage to get exactly this mis
taken impression—either by mere
ly assuming that any overseas
program would concentrate heav
ily in these areas, or by reading
too much into the rather mislead
ing quotations from former over
seas students remarks scattered
liberally throughout the Univer
sity’s brochure.
“We walked along the Loire for
about two miles to an old abbey
where a famous French poet once
lived,” roads one quotation. An
other runs: “Germany was right
there, all around us. We had im
mediate entree into German cul
ture, German life, and the lan
guage.” And the inevitable, “The
whole of Europe is our class
room.” These quotations are with
out a doubt sincere and legiti
mate, but they give a somewhat
false impression. They suggest a
total immersion in the life of the
country a series of encounters
with charming, friendly Euro
peans a 11 dressed in authentic,
quaint native costumes. The sug
gestion is not totally inaccurate;
it is merely one sided.
WHAT THE brochure does not
say is that if you are vitally in
terested in meeting a large num
ber of Europeans and knowing
them in some depth, if you are
quite serious about perfecting
your use of the language, if you
really wish to study the country’s
literature in some detail, then you
had better not live abroad for only
: six months, taking courses in Ab
normal Psychology with eighty
j other Americans—many of whom
1 are a great deal less ambitious

than you.
The Stanford plan is almost
unique in American higher educa
tion. Most of the other programs
! are based on the “junior year
j abroad” system started by Smith
: College in the thirties. The latest
of these is Cal at Bordeaux,
i France, which will soon be joined
by two sister centers in Goettin
j gen, Germany, and Padua, Italy,
i The Cal system differs from that
of Stanford in that the Cal over
' seas students are required to have
j a greater language background.
They take tutorials at the Univer
i sity of Bordeaux, where they live,
j and they choose from a range of
I Bordeaux courses instead of from
American ones carefully imported
from Berkeley and Los Angeles.
The California Board of Regents
j specifically states that providing
“language training that would be
useful in teaching or later grad
| uate work” is a goal of the pro-

gram.
THIS TYPE of plan would not
appeal to every Stanford student
presently applying for the Stan
ford program. It would eliminate
i many who do not have the neces
i sary language background. This
j is exactly what has happened at
| Cal . Although the program is
| open to students from all the Cali-
I fornia campuses, it has managed
to attract to the present group in
Bordeaux some 28 French majors
| and 14 English majors; only four
per cent of the students presently
studying abroad major in the
Natural Sciences, and none are in
Engineering.
This may, however, be the type
of program that some of the Stan
j ford students who were disap
| pointed with the Stanford plan
were looking for. The Stanford
program as it now stands is an
i excellent program for students
and there are many of them—who
cannot get to Europe any other
j way. Unfortunately, many who
] are searching for a more intensive
j program such as Cal’s are attract
