# Finer: De Gaulle Is Firm; Says Britain 'Can Do It'
## 
### PELL FENDER 
Professor Herman Finer of tl
expressed to The Daily some op
ethics of De Gaulle’s decision to
pean Common Market,
Neither does Finer foresee a i
can any member country rebel by
continuing trade with Britain. If
another country chooses to trade
with Britain, the powerful and
efficient executive of the Com
mon Market will expel that coun
try from the association.
Besides, asserted Finer, since
the time of the Common Market’s
formation under the Treaty of
Rome (1957), the members have
profited significantly from this
“economic integration.” The re
sult of De Gaulle’s action will be,
Finer predicted, a closer inter
dependence between the United
States and Britain.

Macmillan’s position in Britain,
though unsure now, may become
firmer, said Finer. Although
there has been increasing defla
tion in Britain over the last three
years, Britain's confidence in
Macmillan is epitomized by the
Conservative majority of 120 men
in Parliament.

A DILEMMA which Macmillan
must solve if he is to maintain
his position, is the unemployment
problem. To get Britain’s 800,000
unemployed back to work. Brit
ain must either renovate outside
trade policies, or revolutionize its
national investment programs,
stimulating desire for articles
which will increase Britain’s stan
dard of living. Since De Gaulle
has prevented Britain from deal
ing with member countries, Brit
ain’s economy must either be kept
alive by increased trade between
countries of the European Free
Trade Association (Britain, Portu
gal, Austria, Switzerland, Nor
way, Sweden, and Denmark I or a
program of public works within
Britain herself.
FINER FEELS that De Gaulle’s
action had "malice in it . . . in
sanity in it,” and was “the capri
cious will of one man.” Finer said
that he could understand any bit
terness De Gaulle might have
against the United States after
the Suez Canal affair; but France
and England were allies in the
Suez Canal affair and in World
War 11. One of the results of
Britain’s hard fighting in World
War II was the preservation of

probably taking this setback, said
Finer, with “dignity . . . and lots
of emotion.’’ But, as when France
recapitulated to Germany in
1940, England now knows where
she stands. She has no allies, but,
Finer said, “she can do it.”
France’s rejection of Britain is
proof of De Gaulle’s gratitude.
Professor Finer is visiting Stan
ford for one quarter. He is a pro
fessor of political science at the
University of Chicago, and is the
author of “Theory and Practice
of Modern Government,” one of
the most widely used texls in col
lege political science courses.
Finer was born in Rumania, but
taught in Britain at the London
School of Economics and Politics
until World War 11. In the United
States, Finer taught at Harvard
before going to the University of
Chicago.
