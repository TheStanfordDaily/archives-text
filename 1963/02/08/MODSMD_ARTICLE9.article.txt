# LASSU Approves I-Club-SUN Ball
## 
### 
In a short meeting last night
at Bowman Alumni House, the
Legislature approved scheduling
of the I-Club sponsored S.U.N.
Ball for Feb. 22 at the Cabana.
ASSU President Rosencranz in
dicated that he had formed an ad
hoc committee and had appointed
to this committee all the mem
bers of the newly elected, hut not
yet constituted, legislature. This
committee will meet on Tuesday,
Feb. 12, at 4:30 p.m, in Room 271
of Tresidder. The committee will
discuss the function of a repre
sentative in the new Legislature
and in what respects a represen
tative speaks for his constituency
and in what respects a represen
tative speaks for himself. The
committee will discuss in what
measure the new Legislature may
wish to express itself. The com
mittee will also discuss procedur
al questions involving the ma
chinery of the new Legislature.
In informal discussion there
arose, among those dedicated to
life and the pursuit of happiness,
a compelling desire to vole for a
party, at least the principle of it,
and to have a hang loose affair,
complete with high school rock
and roll band, on next Thursday
eve in commemoration of Valen
tineâ€™s Day.
