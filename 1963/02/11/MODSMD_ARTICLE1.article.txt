# Iraqi Revolution Will Work to Achieve Objectives Through Arab Socialism
## 
### SAHIL AL-SINAWI Iraqi Government Scholar 
Friday, February the eighth, was the be
ginning of a new era in Iraq and the rest of
the Arab world, when a national revolution
headed by the Iraqi army and backed by the
vast majority of the people toppled the four
and-a-half-year-old dictatorship regime of
Premier Abdul Karim Kassim.

This revolution came eight months after
the independence of Algeria and six months
after the revolution in Yemen, thus marking
the third national impact in the Arab world
in one year. The monarchy regime in Iraq of
King Faisel worked hard to isolate Iraq
which is an integral part of the Arab nation,
from the progressive trend of the Arab
Nationalism, and to gear it to foreign alli
ance which does not serve any Arab cause.
Oppression and tyranny were used but were
put down by the 14th of July revolution in
1958 which was headed by Premier Kassim
and Colonel Abdel Salam Arif, and the rest
of the free officers of the Iraqi Army.
The goals of the new revolution are to
restore and emphasize the objectives of the

14th of July revolution, which were betrayed
and deviated by Kassim who put Arif in jail
and executed several leaders with the help
of the Communists. His regime ended last
Friday and Colonel Arif is the new President
of Iraq.
THIS REVOLUTION works for goals
summarized as Arab unity, freedom and
democracy, and social justice through Arab
socialism. Every one of these goals compli
ments the other. This revolutionary concept
would consider Arab unity as a means rather
than an end in itself, a means toward giving
life and dignity to the Arab individual The
immediate objectives of the present revolu
tion are to emancipate the people from the
abyss of poverty, disease and subservience
under which they exist today. This is un
mistakably linked with the resurrection of
the Arab nation as a whole.

The international policy of the revolution
will follow non-alliance and positive neu
trality, which is not isolation or refusal to
participate in world affairs but rather a
plausible approach to the world which we
want to live in.

It should be mentioned that this revolu
tion, although conducted by the army, was
instigated by effective mass organizations:
the Arab Socialist Resurrectionist (Baath)
Party, the Movement of Arab Nationalists,
and the National Union of Iraqi Students.
The latter is given full credit for its leader
ship to the student body and arranging for
the strike which lasted for six weeks until
the new revolution took over last Friday.
The immediate responsibility of these insti
tutions is to safeguard the goals of the revo
lution and particularly the rights of the
Arab individual.

IN ORDER TO evaluate the impact of the
revolution one should not limit himself to
Iraq alone but rather to the over all political
structure of the Arab world. The revolution
will fortify the Arab Socialism movement
for democratic or liberal (sometimes refer
red to as utopian) socialism. The most dis
tinguishing feature of Arab Socialism is its
close, inseparable association with liberty
and Arab unity. Furthermore, the new Ara
bic nationalist axis of Algiers, Cairo, Bagh
dad and Sana will throw into disarray and

seriously weaken the Arab reactionary camp
of Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria.
An important significance comes from the
role of the communist movement in the Arab
world. A lesson to be drawn from this revo
lution is that any communist takeover or
even a partial success is doomed to failure
in the Arab lands. The Communist party in
Iraq was underground during the monarchy
and was given a full recognition by Premier
Kassim, who used it together with the re
actionists and opportunists against the Arab
nationalists who actually put him in power
in 1958.

The Communist party grew stronger. In
1959-60 it controlled the streets of Baghdad;
it commit ted violent atrocities and massacres
and filled the streets with blood on two oc
casions. The first time was after the failure
of the Shawaf Revolution in the traditional
Arabic city (Mosul) in March 8, 1959. At that
time the Communist party was given full
authority by Premier Kassim to control the
city and in the first week thousands of na
tionalists were executed, in addition to the
children and women and those who were

taken out from the hospital and dragged in
the streets. The second major blood bath
took place in Kirkuk city in July 1959 where
hundreds of young men and women, children
and old people were dragged out simply be
cause they were not communists. Other
tragedies and more executions took place in
numerous other cities of Iraq during the
last four years.

THE PEO P L E reacted vehemently
against the communists but only few com
munists were sent to prison; these were set
free by Premier Kassim a few months later.
One of the first orders of the new revolu
tionary regime in Iraq was to get rid of the
communist agents.

This in itself should give the United
States a good reason to act wisely in the
Middle East and to recognize and support
the new regime of President Abdel Salam
Arif; in this way the United States can
establish a good reputation among the eighty
million Arab people particularly after dis
engaging hersalf from backing the fuedal
reactionary regimes of kings, harems and
puppets in the Arab lands.

ments the other. This revolutionary concept
would consider Arab unity as a means rather
than an end in itself, a means toward giving
life and dignity to the Arab individual The
immediate objectives of the present revolu
tion are to emancipate the people from the
abyss of poverty, disease and subservience
under which they exist today. This is un
mistakably linked with the resurrection of
the Arab nation as a whole.

The international policy of the revolution
will follow non-alliance and positive neu
trality, which is not isolation or refusal to
participate in world affairs but rather a
plausible approach to the world which we
want to live in.

It should be mentioned that this revolu
tion, although conducted by the army, was
instigated by effective mass organizations:
the Arab Socialist Resurrectionist (Baath)
Party, the Movement of Arab Nationalists,
and the National Union of Iraqi Students.
The latter is given full credit for its leader
ship to the student body and arranging for
the strike which lasted for six weeks until
the new revolution took over last Friday.
The immediate responsibility of these insti
tutions is to safeguard the goals of the revo
lution and particularly the rights of the
Arab individual.

IN ORDER TO evaluate the impact of the
revolution one should not limit himself to
Iraq alone but rather to the over all political
structure of the Arab world. The revolution
will fortify the Arab Socialism movement
for democratic or liberal (sometimes refer
red to as utopian) socialism. The most dis
tinguishing feature of Arab Socialism is its
close, inseparable association with liberty
and Arab unity. Furthermore, the new Ara
bic nationalist axis of Algiers, Cairo, Bagh
dad and Sana will throw into disarray and

seriously weaken the Arab reactionary camp
of Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria.
An important significance comes from the
role of the communist movement in the Arab
world. A lesson to be drawn from this revo
lution is that any communist takeover or
even a partial success is doomed to failure
in the Arab lands. The Communist party in
Iraq was underground during the monarchy
and was given a full recognition by Premier
Kassim, who used it together with the re
actionists and opportunists against the Arab
nationalists who actually put him in power
in 1958.

The Communist party grew stronger. In
1959-60 it controlled the streets of Baghdad;
it commit ted violent atrocities and massacres
and filled the streets with blood on two oc
casions. The first time was after the failure
of the Shawaf Revolution in the traditional
Arabic city (Mosul) in March 8, 1959. At that
time the Communist party was given full
authority by Premier Kassim to control the
city and in the first week thousands of na
tionalists were executed, in addition to the
children and women and those who were

taken out from the hospital and dragged in
the streets. The second major blood bath
took place in Kirkuk city in July 1959 where
hundreds of young men and women, children
and old people were dragged out simply be
cause they were not communists. Other
tragedies and more executions took place in
numerous other cities of Iraq during the
last four years.

THE PEO P L E reacted vehemently
against the communists but only few com
munists were sent to prison; these were set
free by Premier Kassim a few months later.
One of the first orders of the new revolu
tionary regime in Iraq was to get rid of the
communist agents.

This in itself should give the United
States a good reason to act wisely in the
Middle East and to recognize and support
the new regime of President Abdel Salam
Arif; in this way the United States can
establish a good reputation among the eighty
million Arab people particularly after dis
engaging hersalf from backing the fuedal
reactionary regimes of kings, harems and
puppets in the Arab lands.
Friday, February the eighth, was the be
ginning of a new era in Iraq and the rest of
the Arab world, when a national revolution
headed by the Iraqi army and backed by the
vast majority of the people toppled the four
and-a-half-year-old dictatorship regime of
Premier Abdul Karim Kassim.

This revolution came eight months after
the independence of Algeria and six months
after the revolution in Yemen, thus marking
the third national impact in the Arab world
in one year. The monarchy regime in Iraq of
King Faisel worked hard to isolate Iraq
which is an integral part of the Arab nation,
from the progressive trend of the Arab
Nationalism, and to gear it to foreign alli
ance which does not serve any Arab cause.
Oppression and tyranny were used but were
put down by the 14th of July revolution in
1958 which was headed by Premier Kassim
and Colonel Abdel Salam Arif, and the rest
of the free officers of the Iraqi Army.
The goals of the new revolution are to
restore and emphasize the objectives of the

14th of July revolution, which were betrayed
and deviated by Kassim who put Arif in jail
and executed several leaders with the help
of the Communists. His regime ended last
Friday and Colonel Arif is the new President
of Iraq.

tinguishing feature of Arab Socialism is its
close, inseparable association with liberty
and Arab unity. Furthermore, the new Ara
bic nationalist axis of Algiers, Cairo, Bagh
dad and Sana will throw into disarray and

seriously weaken the Arab reactionary camp
of Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria.
An important significance comes from the
role of the communist movement in the Arab
world. A lesson to be drawn from this revo
lution is that any communist takeover or
even a partial success is doomed to failure
in the Arab lands. The Communist party in
Iraq was underground during the monarchy
and was given a full recognition by Premier
Kassim, who used it together with the re
actionists and opportunists against the Arab
nationalists who actually put him in power
in 1958.

The Communist party grew stronger. In
1959-60 it controlled the streets of Baghdad;
it commit ted violent atrocities and massacres
and filled the streets with blood on two oc
casions. The first time was after the failure
of the Shawaf Revolution in the traditional
Arabic city (Mosul) in March 8, 1959. At that
time the Communist party was given full
authority by Premier Kassim to control the
city and in the first week thousands of na
tionalists were executed, in addition to the
children and women and those who were

taken out from the hospital and dragged in
the streets. The second major blood bath
took place in Kirkuk city in July 1959 where
hundreds of young men and women, children
and old people were dragged out simply be
cause they were not communists. Other
tragedies and more executions took place in
numerous other cities of Iraq during the
last four years.

THE PEO P L E reacted vehemently
against the communists but only few com
munists were sent to prison; these were set
free by Premier Kassim a few months later.
One of the first orders of the new revolu
tionary regime in Iraq was to get rid of the
communist agents.

This in itself should give the United
States a good reason to act wisely in the
Middle East and to recognize and support
the new regime of President Abdel Salam
Arif; in this way the United States can
establish a good reputation among the eighty
million Arab people particularly after dis
engaging hersalf from backing the fuedal
reactionary regimes of kings, harems and
puppets in the Arab lands.
Friday, February the eighth, was the be
ginning of a new era in Iraq and the rest of
the Arab world, when a national revolution
headed by the Iraqi army and backed by the
vast majority of the people toppled the four
and-a-half-year-old dictatorship regime of
Premier Abdul Karim Kassim.

This revolution came eight months after
the independence of Algeria and six months
after the revolution in Yemen, thus marking
the third national impact in the Arab world
in one year. The monarchy regime in Iraq of
King Faisel worked hard to isolate Iraq
which is an integral part of the Arab nation,
from the progressive trend of the Arab
Nationalism, and to gear it to foreign alli
ance which does not serve any Arab cause.
Oppression and tyranny were used but were
put down by the 14th of July revolution in
1958 which was headed by Premier Kassim
and Colonel Abdel Salam Arif, and the rest
of the free officers of the Iraqi Army.
The goals of the new revolution are to
restore and emphasize the objectives of the

14th of July revolution, which were betrayed
and deviated by Kassim who put Arif in jail
and executed several leaders with the help
of the Communists. His regime ended last
Friday and Colonel Arif is the new President
of Iraq.
THIS REVOLUTION works for goals
summarized as Arab unity, freedom and
democracy, and social justice through Arab
socialism. Every one of these goals compli
ments the other. This revolutionary concept
would consider Arab unity as a means rather
than an end in itself, a means toward giving
life and dignity to the Arab individual The
immediate objectives of the present revolu
tion are to emancipate the people from the
abyss of poverty, disease and subservience
under which they exist today. This is un
mistakably linked with the resurrection of
the Arab nation as a whole.

The international policy of the revolution
will follow non-alliance and positive neu
trality, which is not isolation or refusal to
participate in world affairs but rather a
plausible approach to the world which we
want to live in.

It should be mentioned that this revolu
tion, although conducted by the army, was
instigated by effective mass organizations:
the Arab Socialist Resurrectionist (Baath)
Party, the Movement of Arab Nationalists,
and the National Union of Iraqi Students.
The latter is given full credit for its leader
ship to the student body and arranging for
the strike which lasted for six weeks until
the new revolution took over last Friday.
The immediate responsibility of these insti
tutions is to safeguard the goals of the revo
lution and particularly the rights of the
Arab individual.

IN ORDER TO evaluate the impact of the
revolution one should not limit himself to
Iraq alone but rather to the over all political
structure of the Arab world. The revolution
will fortify the Arab Socialism movement
for democratic or liberal (sometimes refer
red to as utopian) socialism. The most dis
tinguishing feature of Arab Socialism is its
close, inseparable association with liberty
and Arab unity. Furthermore, the new Ara
bic nationalist axis of Algiers, Cairo, Bagh
