# ONE SMALL BLESSING:
## LASSU Meets But Once a Week 
### MARGARET HARDING DANIEL SCHWARTZ Editors 
Past volumes show that every new Daily editor is amused
and astonished by his first official meeting of the Legislature.
These editors, who joined LASSU last Thursday, are no excep
tion to that rule.
Last week’s meeting of the Thursday Evening Series was
strange and wonderful to behold. Perhaps it could be accredited
to the release of tension from the past weeks—surely LASSU
can’t always be that way!
The meeting was held in the conference room of Bowman
Alumni House which was filled by various members of both the
old and the new LASSU, and about half of the I-Club, forming a
large lobby for Mike O’Flynn, I-Club president. Many of the
chairs were taken up by members of the expanded LASSU,
leaving many of the regular LASSU members to sit on table
tops and arms of chairs.
After the roll call—which made it apparent that at least half
of the students present were only substitutes—an approval of the
minutes of the last meeting was asked for. There were a few
small mistakes—“the university” had to be substituted for “one
university”: “boathouse roof” had to be substituted for simply
“boathouse.”
The officers’ and standing committees’ reports were rather
uneventful save for Priscilla Ferguson’s. It seemed Miss Fer
guson had a problem. The I-Club had scheduled an SUN dance
within the same short period as about seventy-two other events,
and Mr. Nelson had asked Miss Ferguson (by letter, of course!)
to withdraw her approval of the I-Club event because of the
large number of other events scheduled at the same time. Mr.
Nelson was afraid that either the I-Club or the other activities
would lose money. Mr. O’Flynn already had the place of the
dance arranged; he cared more about honor than money. After
about thirty minutes, LASSU decided that they really shouldn’t
be discussing the issue anyway, because it was entirely Miss
Ferguson’s business. Then LASSU went ahead and gave its ap
proval for the I-Club Dance, anyway. ... It definitely wasn’t
Mr. Nelson’s night.
Mr. Rosencranz muttered, “They told me there would be
nights like this . .
Then LASSU was asked to give its approval of the Stern
Inter-House Council Constitution, but there was nobody there
from the By-Laws Committee, whose approval had to be ob
tained first. It was learned later that the By-Laws Committee
hadn’t even met to discuss the Constitution. The Committee was
told to meet before next meeting and decide about the constitu
tion—the members had been told the same thing the week
before.
The main order of new business concerned the fact that next
Thursday was Valentine’s Day- might it not be proper to have a
party at “Arinin's Pad” after the meeting? It took about half an
hour, but LASSU finally made its stand, approving the prin
ciple of forming a party. It took about a dozen motions (all pre
sented formally, of course) to decide at what time the party
should be held, when and where the meeting should be held
before the party, how much should be charged each member,
how a band should be arranged, and—the main question—
whether informal dress would be appropriate.
Only a few other points of business—the Constitution for
the Stanford Village Family Council had to be given its second
reading—and LASSU adjourned for another week.
