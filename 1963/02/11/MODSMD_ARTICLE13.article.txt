# STAFF OPINION
## Main Libe Highlights 
### STEVE ZOUSMER Contributing Editor 
Among the more notable and praiseworthy highlights of the
Stanford campus is the Men's Room of the Main Library.
Obviously this is a statement which will raise a few eye
brows. But in the Main Library at this university, anything that
raises a drooping eyebrow deserves full recognition.
Tt is the spirit and vitality expressed in the liberal senti
ments and four-letter words of wisdom which Stanford men
through the years have inscribed on its walls which gives the
Main Libe’s Men’s Room a distinctive flavor. Like the rest of the
building it may he dingy and uncomfortable and short on facili
ties—and often you have to wait a long time —but it stands
nevertheless with the best in the nation.
The Libe itself, however, does not have such a lofty national
status. In a PACE-boosting “Time Magazine” article last No
vember, Professor Sanford Dornbush was quoted as criticizing
our library as “the worst 1 have yet to see in any leading uni
versity” (the quote is not exact —this particular issue is missing
from the library file. And guess who sneaked it away. Only
joking, folks.).
The students probably agree with Professor Dornbush. Stu
dents go to the library to nap, to hate, to read the funny names
in the file catalogues, to compile bibliographies; some go because
they can’t get to any other library and have serious work to do,
none go to smoke. Some don’t even go because they can’t
stand it.
The library is as unstimulating as it is uncomfortable.
Stretch out in a comfy wooden chair (which could give nose
bleeds to woodpeckers) and squint through the hard, dim light
on your faded and pedagogical old book. The book was probably
published about 1896—not that ’96 was a bad vintage but it gets
tiresome—and you have trouble reading it because it is printed
in Ukranian. The Libe has an extensive collection of foreign
language books like this, although you can never get the one
you want.
Read for a moment, interrupted only when fellow students
enter the room dribbling basketballs—or so it sounds—and when
your head caroms off the pillowy tables. Then, for a break, you
can browse around. You will not, however, find many interesting
up-to-date books because these are under lock and key in the
pompous Bender Room. You might find some good books in the
Institute of American History Room or the Jones Room after
huffing and puffing up the stairs to the fourth floor (there is
and elevator of course but us smokers get winded anyway),
where you will be turned away and sent back to the stairs be
cause you lack the requisite permission to use these facilities.
“Mustn’t touch,” as mama used to say.
So the only thing left is the stacks, often called “the heaps.”
There’s always laughs in the stacks. Some titles you may find
there are: “Salamanders” by Sherman Chauncey Bishop, “Zwy
cie/.cy” by Zdislaw Kowalewski, “The Life of Lord Curzon/’
“Two Thousand Years of Oriental Ceramics” by Fu jio Koyama,
or Saleeby’s book, “The Moro Problem.” These are real books,
no kidding.
Last on the list is the Reserve Book Room, which takes the
cake and eats it. There is nothing right about the RBR, and the
only hope is that merciful professors will assign reading else
where, any elsewhere.
As you’re getting back to your work it is 10:50 and the
lights go off, and you fall blindly down the cement stairs on
the way out.

The future, however, is not as dark as the library. The
University promises a new undergraduate library, carefully de
signed and expensively built, supplied, and furnished. It is sure
to be built this century and when it is finished Stanford students
will study in comfort and choose from the best of sources. The
only thing missing will be the old Men’s Room. But who gets
everything he asks for?
