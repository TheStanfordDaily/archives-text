Editors, The Daily:
I have just hart occasion to reart Carol Langford’s article in
your January 10th issue. You did your readers a service to print
so frank an evaluation of one Volunteer’s experience in the
Peace Corps—an experience that certainly is not “romantic,” or
“glamorous,” or even superficially “succeessful.” I think it’s
important that people like Carol who are in the Peace Corps tell
the people back home that the work which the Peace Corps is
trying to do is hard work, work being performed against great
odds, work shorn of the frills that Hollywood might add to one
of its adventure stories.
But important work, nonetheless. Carol would be less than
realistic if she dirt not wonder “if we could ever make a dent in
the situation.” But she is there because Colombian officials and
the Peace Corps believe that small dents pave the way for
greater improvements. I forget who said that progress is the
sum total of countless small victories, but he was right.
The thing I object to about your article is the headline, “Dis
illusion, Cynicism of Volunteers ,Contrary to C’ovps Propa
ganda.” The author of that headline seems to think that we have '
been trying to gloss over the kind, of situation which' Carol re
ports exists in Colombia. Let. me hasten to say that this is ab
solutely not the case. The Peace Corps’ publicity is not manufac
tured by the Peace Corps. Newspapers, radio and television and
even Peace Corps Volunteers are free to write and speak their
own opinions and have done so, just like Carol Langford. Some
times, that results in favorable public opinion, sometimes not.
But the Peace Corps has no control over what any of the net
works or any of the newspapers say about us. If the general
climate of opinion is that the Peace Corps is making some head
way in the newly developing countries of the world, I happen to
believe that that is actually the case. Whatever that opinion, it
is the result of a great deal of reporting and interpretations on
the part of journalists over whom we have no control.

Editors, The Daily:
In house meetings Monday night, four Lagunita houses
passed a resolution urging the Board of Trustees to take
action on University policy concerning “the right of students to
express their opinions both individually and collectively.” The
resolution passed unanimously in Eucalypto, Olivo, and Naranja
Casas and received majority approval in Magnolia. Approximate
ly 20 residents of Adelpha added their approval by signing their
names to the resolution.
The resolution reads as follows:
“We, the women of (Eucalypto, Olivo, Naranja, and Mag
nolia Casas), Lagunita Court, affirming the right of students to
express their opinions both individually and collectively and be
lieving that the Administration’s interpretation of University
policy on student expression is incongruous with the goals of
higher education, do hereby encourage the Board of Trustees to
take immediate action toward formulating a more realistic
policy.”

Editors, The Daily:
While I appreciate The Daily’s concern regarding freshman
life, academic and otherwise, Monday’s article and Thursday’s
editorial could easily mislead the reader. In addition, the editorial
attributed to me several proposals which are not, mine.
Though faculty residents and deans are trying to assess the
University’s impact, upon the freshmen and to communicate
their finding to the University community, no proposals have
been made; indeed, many of the ideas presented in The Daily
have been discussed and discarded. In any case, academic
changes in the freshman program are made by the department
involved.
Any such ideas should be regarded as evidence of a con
tinuing examination of the freshman year rather than of an im
mediate, revolutionary change.
