## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Tlie frosh team has jelled. Af
ter trouncing a weak Treasure
Island Naval Base team 79-41, the
Stanford squad took powerful
San Jose State apart by a decisive
77-54 margin.
The win over the Spartans Sat
urday night in the Pavilion was
especially sweet for the Tribe for
two reasons. First it revenged a
56-52 loss last Friday in San Jose,
but more importantly, it marked
the return to top form of Ray Ko
sanke. The big center, hampered
all year by a knee injury and ill
ness, look complete command of
this game. Utilizing sweeping
hooks, short jumpers, and lay-ins,
Kosanke scored 11 points in the
first seven minutes. After ten
minutes Kosanke had poured
through 16 points, and Stanford
had opened a 20-11 gap.

THU BIG man went out for a
rest, but Stanford wasn’t slowed
a bit. Skip Hutchison took over
and drilled seven quick field
goals. By half time Stanford held
a 44-24 lead, Kosanke and Hutch
ison had 32 points between them,
and the Spartans were wonder
ing why they bothered to show
up at all.
While Hutchison sat out the
second half, Kosanke continued
to roll, with scoring help from
Bob Bedell. The closest San Jose
could get was 49-32. When Ko
sanke left the game with five
minutes remaining, he had scored
30 points, nabbed 15 rebounds,
and helped his team to a 68-47
lead. The second string lengthen
ed the margin to the 77-54 final
score.
S. T. Saffold had 19 points for
San Jose's losing cause, while

leammate Frank Tarrants had 15
markers. Along with Kosanke’s
30 and Hutchison’s 14, Bedell had
ten for Stanford.
THE NIGHT before Stanford
had easily handled an inept Trea
sure Island team which seemed to
need radar to find the basket.
Bedell was Stanford’s entire at
tack for much of the first half.
The thin forward pumped in 18
points in elading the Tribe to a
41-19 half-time lead. It was Be
dell, scoring on long jumps and
fast break baskets, that got the
Indians off to an early 18-3 lead.
By half-time he had hit eight out
of eight free throws and five out
of eight field goals.
Wayne Brazil and Kosanke
took up some of the slack in the
second half when Bedell went to
the bench with 11 minutes re
maining and the game out of
reach at 51-25.

With six minutes remaining
Stanford’s cleanup crew came in
to provide a little comedy. The
result was a series of classic col
lisions. The game mercifully end
ed with the score 79-41 and Trea
sure Island still in one piece, al
though just barely. Another min
ute and someone would have had
to call the MB’s.
BFDFI.L led Stanford’s scoring
with 22 and rebounding with ten.
Kosanke contributed 11 points
and nine rebounds, while Jim
Pandell and Brazil scored nine
each. John Hover paced Treasure
Island with ten points.
The only bad news for Stan
ford this weekend was the tem
porary loss of starting forward
George Haentz, who sustanded a
scratched eye early in the Trea
sure Island game and did not play
against San Jose.
Stanford’s junior varsity Braves
also scored a pair of relatively
low pressure wins over the week
end. Friday they handed Hamil
ton Air Force Base a 74-64 defeat,
and nothing could stop them Sat
urday as they ran up a 101-43 vic
tory over Moffet Field Naval Air
Station.
John Murray led the Brave at
tack Friday with 23 points. In the
Saturday slaughter, Stanford put
six men in double figures, Rod
Young leading with 22. The
Braves had a 54-21 halftime score
over Moffet and coasted home for
the win.

The win over the Spartans Sat
urday night in the Pavilion was
especially sweet for the Tribe for
two reasons. First it revenged a
56-52 loss last Friday in San Jose,
but more importantly, it marked
the return to top form of Ray Ko
sanke. The big center, hampered
all year by a knee injury and ill
ness, look complete command of
this game. Utilizing sweeping
hooks, short jumpers, and lay-ins,
Kosanke scored 11 points in the
first seven minutes. After ten
minutes Kosanke had poured
through 16 points, and Stanford
had opened a 20-11 gap.

THU BIG man went out for a
rest, but Stanford wasn’t slowed
a bit. Skip Hutchison took over
and drilled seven quick field
goals. By half time Stanford held
a 44-24 lead, Kosanke and Hutch
ison had 32 points between them,
and the Spartans were wonder
ing why they bothered to show
up at all.
While Hutchison sat out the
second half, Kosanke continued
to roll, with scoring help from
Bob Bedell. The closest San Jose
could get was 49-32. When Ko
sanke left the game with five
minutes remaining, he had scored
30 points, nabbed 15 rebounds,
and helped his team to a 68-47
lead. The second string lengthen
ed the margin to the 77-54 final
score.
S. T. Saffold had 19 points for
San Jose's losing cause, while

leammate Frank Tarrants had 15
markers. Along with Kosanke’s
30 and Hutchison’s 14, Bedell had
ten for Stanford.
THE NIGHT before Stanford
had easily handled an inept Trea
sure Island team which seemed to
need radar to find the basket.
Bedell was Stanford’s entire at
tack for much of the first half.
The thin forward pumped in 18
points in elading the Tribe to a
41-19 half-time lead. It was Be
dell, scoring on long jumps and
fast break baskets, that got the
Indians off to an early 18-3 lead.
By half-time he had hit eight out
of eight free throws and five out
of eight field goals.
Wayne Brazil and Kosanke
took up some of the slack in the
second half when Bedell went to
the bench with 11 minutes re
maining and the game out of
reach at 51-25.

With six minutes remaining
Stanford’s cleanup crew came in
to provide a little comedy. The
result was a series of classic col
lisions. The game mercifully end
ed with the score 79-41 and Trea
sure Island still in one piece, al
though just barely. Another min
ute and someone would have had
to call the MB’s.
BFDFI.L led Stanford’s scoring
with 22 and rebounding with ten.
Kosanke contributed 11 points
and nine rebounds, while Jim
Pandell and Brazil scored nine
each. John Hover paced Treasure
Island with ten points.
The only bad news for Stan
ford this weekend was the tem
porary loss of starting forward
George Haentz, who sustanded a
scratched eye early in the Trea
sure Island game and did not play
against San Jose.
Stanford’s junior varsity Braves
also scored a pair of relatively
low pressure wins over the week
end. Friday they handed Hamil
ton Air Force Base a 74-64 defeat,
and nothing could stop them Sat
urday as they ran up a 101-43 vic
tory over Moffet Field Naval Air
Station.
John Murray led the Brave at
tack Friday with 23 points. In the
Saturday slaughter, Stanford put
six men in double figures, Rod
Young leading with 22. The
Braves had a 54-21 halftime score
over Moffet and coasted home for
the win.
Tlie frosh team has jelled. Af
ter trouncing a weak Treasure
Island Naval Base team 79-41, the
Stanford squad took powerful
San Jose State apart by a decisive
77-54 margin.
