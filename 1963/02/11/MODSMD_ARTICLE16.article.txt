# Wooden: 'We'll Get You Next Time'
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
“Wo got shot right out of the
place,” said UCLA Coach John
Wooden after the game Saturday
night, referring to Stanford’s 52.5
shooting percentage. By this
time, the 52-year-old coach had
calmed down from the near apo
plexy he had come to when he
was called for two technical
fouls. Also, he was affably look
inf three weeks ahead to when
Hie Bruins would play Stanford
in the cramped gym of Santa
Monica City College. “You do
well here,” Wooden said, “but
we’ll have a chance to get even
down in Santa Monica; of course
we do have to play you again here
in two weeks.”

According to Wooden, UCLA’s
main problem was failing to “get
out on the Stanford jump shoot
ers.”

WOODEN said he had Fred
Slaughter guard Tom Dose from
behind because with Slaughter in
front, they could lob pass over
him. and because the Indians had
cleared the floor behind Dose
well, leaving him all alone after
the lob pass. “It’s preferable to
defend against Dose from in front
if the man can do it,” he added.

Indian guard Don Clemetson,
who hit four for eight from out
side, was rather disparaging of
UCLA’s defense. “You can get
15-foot jump shots any lime you
want because they sag a lot.
That’s the way they always
play; they hope you’ll miss, then
they’ll have five rebounders by
the basket and will try to start a
fast break; they’re always play
ing for the fast break.”
SPEAKING about the Bruins’
tremendous offensive rebounding,
Craig Cordes who took the brunt
of Slaughter’s 225 pounds, said:
“I’ve never seen anyone jump so
well. He’s especially tough be
cause he jumps in as well as up.
He has 50 pounds on mo and just
pushed me under the basket
when he jumped.”
Darrell Sutherland may have
been seriously injured in the
Stanford victory. In making a
second half layup, he was sub
marined by Jack Hirsch and
landed on his left wrist. Although
he reentered the game, the wrist
may have been fractured; X-rays
of it will be taken today.

“Wo got shot right out of the
place,” said UCLA Coach John
Wooden after the game Saturday
night, referring to Stanford’s 52.5
shooting percentage. By this
time, the 52-year-old coach had
calmed down from the near apo
plexy he had come to when he
was called for two technical
fouls. Also, he was affably look
inf three weeks ahead to when
Hie Bruins would play Stanford
in the cramped gym of Santa
Monica City College. “You do
well here,” Wooden said, “but
we’ll have a chance to get even
down in Santa Monica; of course
we do have to play you again here
in two weeks.”

According to Wooden, UCLA’s
main problem was failing to “get
out on the Stanford jump shoot
ers.”

WOODEN said he had Fred
Slaughter guard Tom Dose from
behind because with Slaughter in
front, they could lob pass over
him. and because the Indians had
cleared the floor behind Dose
well, leaving him all alone after
the lob pass. “It’s preferable to
defend against Dose from in front
if the man can do it,” he added.

Indian guard Don Clemetson,
who hit four for eight from out
side, was rather disparaging of
UCLA’s defense. “You can get
15-foot jump shots any lime you
want because they sag a lot.
That’s the way they always
play; they hope you’ll miss, then
they’ll have five rebounders by
the basket and will try to start a
fast break; they’re always play
ing for the fast break.”
SPEAKING about the Bruins’
tremendous offensive rebounding,
Craig Cordes who took the brunt
of Slaughter’s 225 pounds, said:
“I’ve never seen anyone jump so
well. He’s especially tough be
cause he jumps in as well as up.
He has 50 pounds on mo and just
pushed me under the basket
when he jumped.”
Darrell Sutherland may have
been seriously injured in the
Stanford victory. In making a
second half layup, he was sub
marined by Jack Hirsch and
landed on his left wrist. Although
he reentered the game, the wrist
may have been fractured; X-rays
of it will be taken today.
