# Stanford Stunned by Trojans; Recovers to Defeat UCLA
## SU 86, UCLA 78 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
As UCLA’s defenses sagged to
ward the middle, the Indians

stepped up and hit a life-saving
52.5 per cent to beat the Bruins,
86-78, Saturday night in the Pa
vilion and gain a tie for the
AAWU lead. At 4-2, the Indians
are even with Washington, 6-3,
which beat Cal twice in Seattle
this weekend; UCLA is third at
3-3.

The Indians’ crack marksman
ship was both refreshing and
hope-inspiring for a team which
had failed to break the forty per
cent mark in its last three games.
Guards Kent Hinckley, who start
ed his first game, Darrell Suther
land. and Don Clcmetson teamed
with forwards Bob Sommers and
Hollis Moore to produce Stan
ford's best outside shoot ig this
year; from the perimeter, they
made 20 of 40 shots.
MOST ENCOURAGING was
Sutherland, who has been off all
year and did not start after play
ing a scoreless ten minutes
against USC the previous night.
He entered the game late in the
first half shortly after Stanford
had gone ahead to stay with the
aid of two technical fouls called
on Bruin coach John Wooden for
protesting. At that time, the In
dians were desperately fighting
to stay ahead of the Bruins who
were matching nearly every In
dian outside shot with a two
point rebound effort. Sutherland
quickly hit four of five long ones
plus a layup to maintain Stan
ford’s four-point lead at halftime,
47-43.

In the first eight minutes of
the second half, Stanford out
scored UCLA 1S-6 as the latter’s
shooting went cold. The Tribe
maintained the lead throughout
the half and was safely ahead by
17 with six minutes left. When
Clemetson and Tom Dose fouled
out, the Bruins caught up a bit
but, the closest they could get
was six points, with only eight
seconds left.
WHILE Stanford’s main bar
rage was carried on from the out
side. the Indians got a 23-point
performance inside from Dose,
who had little trouble from the
Bruin defense. 6-5 UCLA center
Fred Slaughter, who can out
jump Dose, started out the night
playing in front of the Indian
sent USC off the court with a
28-25 advantage.
Stanford started fast in the
second half, moving out to a 47-42
lead, and the Cards began to look
like conference champions. How
ever, it was all downhill after
that. SC ran off seven straight
pointers to lead 49-47, five of
those points coming on free
throws to again tie it at 51-all.
SC RAN off six points for 57-51,
four coming on free throws. Af
ter that, the game w r as in the Tro
jan bag.
One important statistic that
doesn’t show in the box score
was the comparative number of
free throws awarded the two
teams in the last ten minutes of
play. Southern Cal shot 14, mak
ing 10. Stanford received three,
qnd. made.two. And (that .was thp
ball game. - ' !

As UCLA’s defenses sagged to
ward the middle, the Indians

stepped up and hit a life-saving
52.5 per cent to beat the Bruins,
86-78, Saturday night in the Pa
vilion and gain a tie for the
AAWU lead. At 4-2, the Indians
are even with Washington, 6-3,
which beat Cal twice in Seattle
this weekend; UCLA is third at
3-3.

The Indians’ crack marksman
ship was both refreshing and
hope-inspiring for a team which
had failed to break the forty per
cent mark in its last three games.
Guards Kent Hinckley, who start
ed his first game, Darrell Suther
land. and Don Clcmetson teamed
with forwards Bob Sommers and
Hollis Moore to produce Stan
ford's best outside shoot ig this
year; from the perimeter, they
made 20 of 40 shots.
MOST ENCOURAGING was
Sutherland, who has been off all
year and did not start after play
ing a scoreless ten minutes
against USC the previous night.
He entered the game late in the
first half shortly after Stanford
had gone ahead to stay with the
aid of two technical fouls called
on Bruin coach John Wooden for
protesting. At that time, the In
dians were desperately fighting
to stay ahead of the Bruins who
were matching nearly every In
dian outside shot with a two
point rebound effort. Sutherland
quickly hit four of five long ones
plus a layup to maintain Stan
ford’s four-point lead at halftime,
47-43.

In the first eight minutes of
the second half, Stanford out
scored UCLA 1S-6 as the latter’s
shooting went cold. The Tribe
maintained the lead throughout
the half and was safely ahead by
17 with six minutes left. When
Clemetson and Tom Dose fouled
out, the Bruins caught up a bit
but, the closest they could get
was six points, with only eight
seconds left.
WHILE Stanford’s main bar
rage was carried on from the out
side. the Indians got a 23-point
performance inside from Dose,
who had little trouble from the
Bruin defense. 6-5 UCLA center
Fred Slaughter, who can out
jump Dose, started out the night
playing in front of the Indian
sent USC off the court with a
28-25 advantage.
Stanford started fast in the
second half, moving out to a 47-42
lead, and the Cards began to look
like conference champions. How
ever, it was all downhill after
that. SC ran off seven straight
pointers to lead 49-47, five of
those points coming on free
throws to again tie it at 51-all.

ed his first game, Darrell Suther
land. and Don Clcmetson teamed
with forwards Bob Sommers and
Hollis Moore to produce Stan
ford's best outside shoot ig this
year; from the perimeter, they
made 20 of 40 shots.
MOST ENCOURAGING was
Sutherland, who has been off all
year and did not start after play
ing a scoreless ten minutes
against USC the previous night.
He entered the game late in the
first half shortly after Stanford
had gone ahead to stay with the
aid of two technical fouls called
on Bruin coach John Wooden for
protesting. At that time, the In
dians were desperately fighting
to stay ahead of the Bruins who
were matching nearly every In
dian outside shot with a two
point rebound effort. Sutherland
quickly hit four of five long ones
plus a layup to maintain Stan
ford’s four-point lead at halftime,
47-43.

In the first eight minutes of
the second half, Stanford out
scored UCLA 1S-6 as the latter’s
shooting went cold. The Tribe
maintained the lead throughout
the half and was safely ahead by
17 with six minutes left. When
Clemetson and Tom Dose fouled
out, the Bruins caught up a bit
but, the closest they could get
was six points, with only eight
seconds left.
WHILE Stanford’s main bar
rage was carried on from the out
side. the Indians got a 23-point
performance inside from Dose,
who had little trouble from the
Bruin defense. 6-5 UCLA center
Fred Slaughter, who can out
jump Dose, started out the night
playing in front of the Indian
sent USC off the court with a
28-25 advantage.
Stanford started fast in the
second half, moving out to a 47-42
lead, and the Cards began to look
like conference champions. How
ever, it was all downhill after
that. SC ran off seven straight
pointers to lead 49-47, five of
those points coming on free
throws to again tie it at 51-all.
SC RAN off six points for 57-51,
four coming on free throws. Af
ter that, the game w r as in the Tro
jan bag.
One important statistic that
doesn’t show in the box score
was the comparative number of
free throws awarded the two
teams in the last ten minutes of
play. Southern Cal shot 14, mak
ing 10. Stanford received three,
qnd. made.two. And (that .was thp
ball game. - ' !

As UCLA’s defenses sagged to
ward the middle, the Indians

stepped up and hit a life-saving
52.5 per cent to beat the Bruins,
86-78, Saturday night in the Pa

AAWU lead. At 4-2, the Indians
are even with Washington, 6-3,
