# USC 61, 57

### GLENN ALFORD 
USC dealt a serious blow to
Stanford championship aspira
tions Friday night. The Trojans
pulled out a 61-57 victory in the
Pavilion.

The predominately Stanford
crowd constantly booed the work
of officials Richard Perry and
Tiny Bussenius. USC took 32 foul
shots to Stanford’s 17, and made
21. Stanford outscored the Tro
jans from the floor, 22 to 20.

TROJAN CENTER Gordon
Martin turned in perhaps the top
individual performance by a
Stanford opponent this year scor
ing 30 points and collecting eight
rebounds. Martin and Stanford’s
own fine center Tom Dose staged
one of the greatest personal duels
even seen in the Pavilion.

Dose scored 24 points, including
12 of Stanford’s first 14, and 14 of
the first 18. He also collected a
game high of 17 rebounds as
Stanford dominated the back
boards 51-36. Dose pulled off the
unusually high total of 15 of
fensive rebounds.

It was apparent from the start
that USC’s strategy was to pull
Dose out by setting Martin out
side while Dose was guarding
him. The Trojan center tanked
four long jumpers and sot shots
in the first six minutes of play,
and then went inside to pick up
six free throws in the remainder
of the first half.
STANFORD WAS behind al
most from the start of the game.
USC at one time had a 16-9 bulge,
thanks to Martin’s outside pop
ping. Then Dose and Kent Hinck
ley put in 11 quick points and
Stanford took the lead at 20-19.
Craig Cordcs’ two free throws
gave Stanford a 25-22 load near
the end of the half, but shots by
Wells Sloniger and Bill Morris,
and an off the oar shot by Allen
Young at the halftime buzzer
center. But after an easy layup
by Dose, set up by a lob pass,
Slaughter played behind him,
conceding the pass in to him but
hoping to cut him off after the
pass. However, Dose faked so
well he had Slaughter jumping
and lunging in every direction
but the right one and scored easi
ly on drives and short hook shots;
he added seven of eight free
throws and several rebound shots,
and thus contributed to Stan
fords astounding percentage by
sinking eight of 13 attempts in
all.
Stanford’s superlative shooting
was the weapon that counteract
ed UCLA’s brutal offensive re
bounding. With 6-3 Jack Hirsch
squirming his way to strong re
bounding position, 6-2 Walt Haz
zard, 6-3 Fred Goss, and 6-5 Keith
Erickson plainly jumping over
Indian players, and Slaughter
just bulling through to the of-

fensive backboard, the Bruins
compensated for their 35 per cent,
shooting by bringing their shot
total up 85; 11 of their 30 bas
kets resulted directly from re
bounds.

OFFENSIVE rebounding stood
out as UCLA’s only offensive
weapon, especially when Dose
was out of the game, as Stanford
contained the Bruins’ other weap
on, the fast break. They accom
plished this in two ways. First,
the Indians’ offensive rebounding
was good enough to contest most
of UCLA’s defensive rebounds so
that the Bruins could not make
that first, quick pass downcourt
to start the fast break. (With
Stanford hitting 52 per cent,
there weren’t many defensive re
bounds anyway.)
Second, the Indian defensive
guards, alerted for the fast break,
dropped back fast and were able
to cut off the Bruin dribbler. Of
seven Uclan breaks, only four led
to baskets. Two three-on-two fast
breaks pefered-out because a
third defender caught up and
covered the open Bruin; and a
third three-on-two failed when
Hazzard jumped at the top of the
key, expecting one of the two de
fenders to jump with him and
leave a teammate open under the
basket for a jump pass; but in
mid air, he found both teammates
covered, had to readjust his
sights to the hoop, and thus miss
ed a hurried 20-footer.
IP' HAZZARD was foiled by
the defense on that play, it was
an atypical sight. The Bruin
guard showed he is easily the
best individual to play in the Pa
vilion this year. He led both
teams with 27 points, including
11 free throws without miss;
passed off for six baskets; and
picked off eight rebounds, second
on the Bruins only to Slaughter’s
15.
