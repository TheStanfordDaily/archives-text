# USC 61, 57

### GLENN ALFORD 
USC dealt a serious blow to
Stanford championship aspira
tions Friday night. The Trojans
pulled out a 61-57 victory in the
Pavilion.

The predominately Stanford
crowd constantly booed the work
of officials Richard Perry and
Tiny Bussenius. USC took 32 foul
shots to Stanford’s 17, and made
21. Stanford outscored the Tro
jans from the floor, 22 to 20.

TROJAN CENTER Gordon
Martin turned in perhaps the top
individual performance by a
Stanford opponent this year scor
ing 30 points and collecting eight
rebounds. Martin and Stanford’s
own fine center Tom Dose staged
one of the greatest personal duels
even seen in the Pavilion.

Dose scored 24 points, including
12 of Stanford’s first 14, and 14 of
the first 18. He also collected a
game high of 17 rebounds as
Stanford dominated the back
boards 51-36. Dose pulled off the
unusually high total of 15 of
fensive rebounds.

It was apparent from the start
that USC’s strategy was to pull
Dose out by setting Martin out
side while Dose was guarding
him. The Trojan center tanked
four long jumpers and sot shots
in the first six minutes of play,
and then went inside to pick up
six free throws in the remainder
of the first half.
STANFORD WAS behind al
most from the start of the game.
USC at one time had a 16-9 bulge,
thanks to Martin’s outside pop
ping. Then Dose and Kent Hinck
ley put in 11 quick points and
Stanford took the lead at 20-19.
Craig Cordcs’ two free throws
gave Stanford a 25-22 load near
the end of the half, but shots by
Wells Sloniger and Bill Morris,
and an off the oar shot by Allen
Young at the halftime buzzer
