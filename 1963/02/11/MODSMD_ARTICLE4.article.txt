# Lincoln's Radical Policy Discussed By Fehrenbacher
## 
### LYNN SUSAG 
What would Lincoln’s stand be
today on de-segregation? “In a
sense this is a parlor game, but
this is a sort of parlor,” said Dr.
Don E. Fehrenbacher, associate
professor of history, in an infor
mal discussion at Tresidder on

“Lincoln and the Negro” yester
day afternoon.

It is inconceivable that a mod
ern Lincoln, if this can bo imag
ined. would be anything but a
firm supporter of the Supreme
Court decisions, Fehrenbacher
said. “But he would also be flexi
ble, cautious, and sympathetic.
LINCOLN did endorse princi
ples of segregation in his day and
even considered the colonization
of Haiti and Panama with Ameri
can Negroes as a solution, Feh
renbacher said. Lincoln was pri
marily concerned with slavery
which he considered morally
wrong. At that time, however,
slavery was sanctioned by the
Constitution and any attempt to
abolish it would have destroyed
the Union. Even though some of
Lincoln’s words on what, he would
deny the Negro grate on our sen
sitiveness today, it is historically
important that he claimed all the
rights enumerated in the Decla
ration of Independence for the
Negro.
The twentieth century has
broadened these concepts beyond
what Lincoln had in mind. Feh
renbacher said. The establish
ment of rights is only the be
ginning. Even with equal rights
the Negro is at a disadvantage
because of a history of suppres
sion.

Even from the greatest men of
the past wo cannot gain specific
answers to our problems. Their
problems are not ours and their
solutions are not ours, Fehren
bacher concluded. From Lincoln
we can learn about the wisdom of
flexible methods and gain inspira
tion from his humaneness, but
from there we arc on our own.
