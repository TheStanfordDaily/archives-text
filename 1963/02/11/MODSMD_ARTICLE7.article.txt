# Ketchum Views Existentialism, Four Crises of Western Man
## 
### JOHN BISSELL WILLIAM MOORE 
Tlic West needs to look “through the world, not at it,” Jona
than Ketchum, prominent existentialist, told the Beta Chi frater
nity last night.

“What we need is a Copernicam
revolution, a new look at old in
formation,” Ketchum said. He de
clared that Western man faces
four crises:
1. Philosophical: "There is a
danger of its disintegrating into
various points of view, of its fail
ing to examine the totality of
human experience, and thereby
destroying itself.”
2. SCIENTIFIC; “Scientists are
motivated primarily by govern
ment grants. They are unclear as
to why they are studying science
and they appear to have no foun
dation in their scientific approach
other than consistency . . . Were
it not for theory there would bo
no science. However, that theory
is arbitrary, and as a result many
sciences are not being studied.
The result is an anarchy of the
sciences.”
3. Cultural, “There is a need to
see through things—a diaphanous
consciousness. The development
of self can be divided into five
categories: The experience of pri
mal self as exemplified in sleep
without dreams; we do not know
our consciousness. The magical
self, the self which we see in our
dreams, or the self which cul
tures less advanced than our own
express in totem dances.
“THE MYTHICAL self . . . the
self which can identify with fa
bles or myths or traditions of the
past. Rational self, the highest
form of self which some of us
have attained. The future cate
gory is the stage of integral self
where one attains the diaphonous
consciousness.”
4. Personal. “There are succes
sive human conditions of bore
dom, escape from boredom to an
other world of one’s own, return
to engagement in that world from
which one has escaped, and,
naturally, resulting frustration.”
