# 'David' Too Mechanical, But Well-Executed
## 
### RALPH PEER 
“David” ’s San Francisco pre
miere Saturday evening was w r ell
executed, but mechanical.
Adele Addison as Michal. Ches
ter Ludgin as David, and Robert
Oliver as Goliath, wore the only
three soloists that managed to
pry themselves from their music
long enough to become aware of
their roles as characters in a
monumental epic. However, the
215-voice chorus of Stanford stu
dents in conjunction with the sur
prisingly lyrical music almost
compensated for the lack of ex
pressiveness in most of the minor
solo parts.
S A T U R D A Y’S performance,
honoring the composer’s seventi
eth birthday, was a presentation
of (he first three acts of the five
act opera, in concert form. The
three acts depicted the story of
David from his selection as king
by Saul to the planning of the
founding of Jerusalem.
Darius Milhaud, the composer,
has been stirred by his subject to
a sort of epic oratorio that re-

calls Handel in its heroic vision
of Israel- not to say that Mil
haud has risen to Handelian
heights, but the music is deeply
moving. The great episodes of

| biblical times are set before us in
; the form of a gigantic painting
j designed by the soloists, colored
| by the chorus, and textured by
I the orchestra.
THE OTHERWISE excellent
| performance was marred by a
{lack of understanding of their
| parts by most of the minor solo
ists which, in combination with
their poor diction, left the audi
ence at a loss to understand the
relatively complicated plot. How
ever, the high level of prepara
tion Dr. Schmidt and Mr. Aslan
ian w r ere able to achieve with the
chorus even drew praise from Mr.
Milhaud and, to a degree, made
up for the other problems.
The highlights of the opera
were the fight between David and
Goliath in the first act and the
reunion of David and Michal in
the third. In both cases the solo
ists' dramatic expression compli
mented the music’s tone and the
1 audience was able, for a moment,
i to partake in the story.
“David” is grand opera in the
1 true sense of the word, and
though the unclarity tended to

fog this for a brief time, the au
dience’s two warm standing ova
tions for Mr. Milhaud showed
that it is impossible to cloud the
greatness of the work.
