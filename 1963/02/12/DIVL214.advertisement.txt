Equally essential to
the well-planned col
lege wardrobe (as
crew socks) is a good
ly supply of T-shirts,
most particularly the
type purveyed by
Roos Atkins. These,
you’ll see, are dacron
and cotton, for no
sweat laundering.
They’re tailored to
fit, and have a special
reinforced collarette
that prevents neckline
sag (and you wouldn’t
want that, would
you?). Also at the
February Special tag
of I.s9.Three for 4.65.
