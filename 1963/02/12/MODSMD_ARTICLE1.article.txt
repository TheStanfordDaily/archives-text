# Bolivar House Is Reputed Finest Hispanic-American Studies Center
## 
### WILLIAM MOORE (First of a Two-Part Series 
While walking down Alvarado Row one
day last week, two students stopped before
a brightly painted white and blue house.
“What is that, anyway?” one of them
asked. “I’ve been seeing people come in and
out of there all year.”
“Beats me,” his companion replied.
"Looks busy, though.”
“Busy” sums up in a nutshell the activi
ties going on inside the building. Some peo
ple call it Bolivar House—or, more specific
ally, the headquarters for the Institute of
Hispanic American Studies.
SINCE ITS FOUNDING 15 years ago at
Stanford, it has developed a reputation for

being “busy"—and a reputation as the finest
center in the nation, perhaps in the world,
for the study of current affairs in Latin
America.
The Institute is both a research center
and a teaching organization for Hispanic
American and Luso-Brazilian studies. The
core of its activities revolve around publica
tion of the Hispanic American Report, a
monthly journal that is recognized as the
standard authority on political, social, and
economic developments.

AND NO WONDER. A staff of about 80
comprised of editorial board members, con
tributors, (including undergraduates and
graduates), correspondents, and undex-gradu
ate assistants—help compile the Report.

Each month they sift through hundreds of
newspapers, magazines, clippings, and other
printed materials that pour into Bolivar
House, many of which are selected and for
warded by correspondents throughout the
Hispanic American world.
The Institute has the most complete ar
chives in the U.S. on the area, according to
Dr. Ronald Hilton, director and founder of
the center and editor of the Report.
“FROM THE WATCHTOWER of the Re
port, we can see details of the whole Latin
American landscape in away which is un
equalled in Latin America Itself.” Dr. Hilton
pointed out. ‘There is in Latin America no
vantage point from which the whole of that
cultural area may be seen.”

There’s nothing new, however, about this
local interest in Latin America: It is a Stan
ford tradition dating back to the days of the
University’s second president, Dr. John Cas
par Branner, who is acknowledged as the
father of Brazilian studies in the U.S. For
merly a geologist in Brazil, Dr. Branner
came to Palo Alto as an ardent admirer and
scholar of Latin America. His enthusiasm
was contagious—and still is.
BUT TODAY IT IS Dr. Hilton who is the
key figure behind the current activities here.
Dr. Hilton has written and edited many
periodical articles and books. Among his
most notable works are the seven-volume
“Who’s Who in Latin America” and the
“Handbook of Hispanic Source Materials.”

JUST LAST DECEMBER he was award
ed the annual trophy presented by the Soci
ety for Pan-American Culture. He has also
been presented Brazil’s Cruzeiro do Sul
award (as was James Taylor, a lecturer on
the Institute’s staff.)

Dr. Hilton first developed an interest in
his present field while in Spain before and
during the 1936 civil war.
“Prior to that time I regarded an interest
in politics as unscholarly. But it was my ex
periences in Spain . . . when many of my
best Spanish friends were killed, which made
me realize that the boll was tolling for all
of us, including scholars. Especially in the
Hispanic world, politics constitute the warp
and woof of daily life.”
