## Salinger's Characters Plausible' 
### JOHN LUCE 
“Raise High tin* Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An
Introduction," .1. I). Salinger; Little, Brown, and Co. (Reprint
from “The New Yorker")

“Newsweek Magazine’’ of January 28, 1963, romplained
about J. D. Salinger’s latest work for several reasons. A) The
book is too expensive (four dollars). B) It is an artistic gyp as
well in that Salinger’s alter ego, the narrator buddy, is a “Nar
cissist” and “a windbag.” C) “Raise High” is far less a “paean
to Seymour than a merely boastful tale of Buddy’s entitled ‘How
I slew the Philistines and found love in my brother’s diary.’ ”
D) There is too much buddy, too little Seymour. E) Seymour
explained his success in marble-shooting in terms of Zen, “which
has the effect of making both Zen and Seymour sound brilliant
the easy way.” F) “Buddy is a fool and a faker.” G) “Seymour
still awaits a proper introduction.”
In spite of “Newsweek’s” only partially apt criticism, and
the remarks of others—who have called Salinger “intellectually
shallow” and a “literary fake”—argument does nothing to damp
en the fascination of these and Salinger’s other stories. In fact it
serves to point out that in spite of his often flagrant literary
misbehavior Salinger has and will continue to amaze many
critics and retain a considerable entourage of critics and artistic
passers-by who seek his writing in any form, albeit a reissue of
the old in place of the new.
Buddy Glass is not a “bore” as “Newsweek” would have it,
although he may be long-winded; furthermore, he is most cer
tainly a person and these two stories might well stand on this
strength alone. In “Franny and Zooey,” Buddy and the entire
Glass family including the oft-mentioned, yet unexplained Sey
mour, Salinger has created a very real set of beings whose
“aliveness” is realiz.ed all the more if the potential difficulty of
establishing the plausibility of their intellectual uniqueness is
considered. “Raise High” is a good story, tonally comic and over
ridingly serious; it is Buddy’s story and through Salinger’s re
markable ability of suggestion, it is Seymour’s and sister 800-
Boo’s as well. In the same manner “Seymour,” not an introduc
tion, belongs to Buddy, and although “Seymour” is not a “story,”
the meanderings of its narrator and the snatches of his mystic
ally mysterious brother are hardly the less interesting in "Sey
mour’s” diary form.
In respect of “Newsweek’s” criticism, both stories are con
tained within what one might call a whimsical framework, but
this does not distract from their seriousness, and human insight,
their value in the creation of a family that cannot be picked up
at midstream, and to the plausibility of the members of that
family.
Of course the credit for their plausibility (ultimately, their
conviction t relates to Salinger himself, and is far more a result
of his style than his alter ego imposition, his statements that
Seymour saw marble-playing in Zen terms. Salinger is far and
away the greatest master of colloquial prose in contemporary
fiction: dialogue, description, and the mental meanderings of a
Buddy Glass or a Holden Caulfield are true in the fullest sense
of the word, Salinger can make the slightest motion, the most
subtle variance in speech individualize as few writers can. And
in tone and accentuation he may often be light, but never obscur
ing, playing the hidden flash to its greatest imaginative appeal.
There is almost nothing the Glass family might do that is not
potentially intriguing, and in his latest offering Salinger de
livers their interest in a style so interesting that any amount of
mischief succeeds.
To borrow a phrase from Buddy in “Seymour,” “where there
is smoke, there is usually strawberry Jello”: few writers can say
that so convincingly: fewer still seem to spend their lives trying
to prove it; none succeed so successfully as J. D. Salinger. We
await another helping.
