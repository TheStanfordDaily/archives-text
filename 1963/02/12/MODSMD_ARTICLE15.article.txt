## The 						Coming of the Shady Deal 
### RICHARD WEINIG Contributing Editor 
Franklin D. Roosevelt distinguished himself with the New
Deal. Harry Truman followed suit with the Fair Deal. And it
appears as if John F. Kennedy may long bo remembered for
the Shady Deal.
Perhaps I am becoming suspicious in my old age, hut it
seems a bit more than coincidental that:
(a) During the Cuban crisis, Premier Khrushchev mag
nanimously offered to withdraw all bombers and intermediate
range missiles from Cuba if the United States would abandon
all missile establishments in Turkey, Italy, and Britain;
(b) In the December 10 issue of the “Saturday Evening
Post,” Stewart Alsop and Charles Bartlett—two of the Presi
dent’s closest friends and most trusted contacts with the press
—disclosed that Adlai Stevenson favored evacuation of the fore
named bases for reciprocal Soviet action in Cuba; <At his name,
every liberal head shall bow and knee shall bend, etc., etc., etc.,)
and
(c) Less than six weeks after the Alsop-Bartlett article ap
peared, White House sources announced that American bases in
Turkey and Italy were being abandoned- over the protests of
both governments—and that similar action in Britain was
pending.
However, the American people have been solemnly advised
that no deal with Mr. Khrushchev was made. The United Slates
is but implementing Robert McNamara’s long impending pro
gram of replacing supposedly obsolete, hard-cased, first-strike,
missiles with submarine-based Polaris bissiles. And any fool
shoidd realize that missiles stationed on the backs of rolling
submarines in high seas are infinitely more accurate than their
hard-cased, land-grounded counterparts.
Moreover, one is continually reminded that Mr. Kennedy’s
truthfulness is beyond reproach. One should trust one’s leaders;
unlike other white men, they would never speak with a forked
tongue. Take, for instance, the President’s statements to the
American people for the past four months with regard to Cuba;
(1) Nine days before his celebrated speech of October 22,
Mr. Kennedy was stumping across Indiana, proclaiming for all
to hear that no intermediate range missile bases had been estab
lished in Cuba; and that any politician calling for a blockade of
Cuba “ought to be kept home by the voters and replaced by one
who understands what the Twentieth Century is all about.”
(New York “Times.” October 14. p. 1.) But, 10, in the next few
days, 25 medium-range missile bases sprang, like tobacco leaf,
from the fertile Cuban soil. It seems as if things grow quickly
in the tropics.
(2) Before and around October 22, the White House as
sured the American people that no Soviet troops had been
stationed in Cuba and only four to five thousand technicians
were to be found there. But on January 24, the President stated
that between 16,000 and 17,000 soldiers and technicians are pres
ently In Cuba and alNHit 4,500 have been withdrawn since Octo
ber. a different story from that which he was peddling to the
nation before the election, isn’t it? His abacus must not have
been functioning properly in October.
(3) Since November, the President has repeatedly assured
the American people that all intermediate range missiles have
been removed from Cuba. But when questioned on the matter
in his press conference of February 7, he was forced to admit:
“It may be there are hidden away some missiles. Nobody can
prove in the finite sense, that they are not there, or they may
be brought in.” It seems as if nothing is a sure thing these days.
It therefore appears as if the discrepancies between fact and
each of the President’s former utterances may be viewed in any
of three ways: Mr. Kennedy has either been telling bare faced
lies to his constituents; or he simply doesn’t know what he is
talking about a good deal of the time; or both. I can envisage
no other alternatives.
Well, then, does the removal of American missile bases from
Turkey and Italy signify a rather shady deal with Khrushchev?
Or does it merely mean that Robert McNamara’s new program
of nuclear deterrence is being put into operation? I suppose
you pays your money and you takes your choice.
If Mr. Kennedy has shaded the truth in each of the fore
named instances, (albeit, covering his tracks rather ineptly)
there is little reason lo believe that a transaction was not made
with Khrushchev; and that removal of the bases is but crass,
Stevensonian appeasement. But this should surprise no one.
After all, Walter Lippmann seems to see in Mr. Kennedy all of
the attributes which he once saw in his idol, Adlai Stevenson—
save one. “Mr. Kennedy’s image,” wrote Lippmann in 1960, "is
so masculine.”
And, if the President actually agreed to remove the American
bases in exchange for Khrushchev’s pledge to refrain from
future arms shipments to Cuba, Senator Kenneth Keating’s
reports of a recent and massive military buildup on the island
indicate that Mr. Kennedy is not only a prevaricator. He is an
inexcusably poor horse trader.
However, if one chooses the second alternative—that Mr.
Kennedy, though truthful, simply doesn’t know what he is talk
ing about a good deal of the time—may heaven help the country.
It is doubtful if the President will be able to.
But under any circumstances, one may hope that Mr. Mc-
Namara’s latest undertaking is somewhat more successful than
his greatest venture while president of the Ford Company: It
was production of something called the Edsel.

all missile establishments in Turkey, Italy, and Britain;
(b) In the December 10 issue of the “Saturday Evening
Post,” Stewart Alsop and Charles Bartlett—two of the Presi
dent’s closest friends and most trusted contacts with the press
—disclosed that Adlai Stevenson favored evacuation of the fore
named bases for reciprocal Soviet action in Cuba; <At his name,
every liberal head shall bow and knee shall bend, etc., etc., etc.,)
and
(c) Less than six weeks after the Alsop-Bartlett article ap
peared, White House sources announced that American bases in
Turkey and Italy were being abandoned- over the protests of
both governments—and that similar action in Britain was
pending.
However, the American people have been solemnly advised
that no deal with Mr. Khrushchev was made. The United Slates
is but implementing Robert McNamara’s long impending pro
gram of replacing supposedly obsolete, hard-cased, first-strike,
missiles with submarine-based Polaris bissiles. And any fool
shoidd realize that missiles stationed on the backs of rolling
submarines in high seas are infinitely more accurate than their
hard-cased, land-grounded counterparts.
Moreover, one is continually reminded that Mr. Kennedy’s
truthfulness is beyond reproach. One should trust one’s leaders;
unlike other white men, they would never speak with a forked
tongue. Take, for instance, the President’s statements to the
American people for the past four months with regard to Cuba;
(1) Nine days before his celebrated speech of October 22,
Mr. Kennedy was stumping across Indiana, proclaiming for all
to hear that no intermediate range missile bases had been estab
lished in Cuba; and that any politician calling for a blockade of
Cuba “ought to be kept home by the voters and replaced by one
who understands what the Twentieth Century is all about.”
(New York “Times.” October 14. p. 1.) But, 10, in the next few
days, 25 medium-range missile bases sprang, like tobacco leaf,
from the fertile Cuban soil. It seems as if things grow quickly
in the tropics.
(2) Before and around October 22, the White House as
sured the American people that no Soviet troops had been
stationed in Cuba and only four to five thousand technicians
were to be found there. But on January 24, the President stated
that between 16,000 and 17,000 soldiers and technicians are pres
ently In Cuba and alNHit 4,500 have been withdrawn since Octo
ber. a different story from that which he was peddling to the
nation before the election, isn’t it? His abacus must not have
been functioning properly in October.
(3) Since November, the President has repeatedly assured
the American people that all intermediate range missiles have
been removed from Cuba. But when questioned on the matter
in his press conference of February 7, he was forced to admit:
“It may be there are hidden away some missiles. Nobody can
prove in the finite sense, that they are not there, or they may
be brought in.” It seems as if nothing is a sure thing these days.
It therefore appears as if the discrepancies between fact and
each of the President’s former utterances may be viewed in any
of three ways: Mr. Kennedy has either been telling bare faced
lies to his constituents; or he simply doesn’t know what he is
talking about a good deal of the time; or both. I can envisage
no other alternatives.
Well, then, does the removal of American missile bases from
Turkey and Italy signify a rather shady deal with Khrushchev?
Or does it merely mean that Robert McNamara’s new program
of nuclear deterrence is being put into operation? I suppose
you pays your money and you takes your choice.
If Mr. Kennedy has shaded the truth in each of the fore
named instances, (albeit, covering his tracks rather ineptly)
there is little reason lo believe that a transaction was not made
with Khrushchev; and that removal of the bases is but crass,
Stevensonian appeasement. But this should surprise no one.
After all, Walter Lippmann seems to see in Mr. Kennedy all of
the attributes which he once saw in his idol, Adlai Stevenson—
save one. “Mr. Kennedy’s image,” wrote Lippmann in 1960, "is
so masculine.”
And, if the President actually agreed to remove the American
bases in exchange for Khrushchev’s pledge to refrain from
future arms shipments to Cuba, Senator Kenneth Keating’s
reports of a recent and massive military buildup on the island
indicate that Mr. Kennedy is not only a prevaricator. He is an
inexcusably poor horse trader.
However, if one chooses the second alternative—that Mr.
Kennedy, though truthful, simply doesn’t know what he is talk
ing about a good deal of the time—may heaven help the country.
It is doubtful if the President will be able to.
But under any circumstances, one may hope that Mr. Mc-
Namara’s latest undertaking is somewhat more successful than
his greatest venture while president of the Ford Company: It
was production of something called the Edsel.
Franklin D. Roosevelt distinguished himself with the New
Deal. Harry Truman followed suit with the Fair Deal. And it
appears as if John F. Kennedy may long bo remembered for
the Shady Deal.
Perhaps I am becoming suspicious in my old age, hut it
seems a bit more than coincidental that:

nanimously offered to withdraw all bombers and intermediate
range missiles from Cuba if the United States would abandon
all missile establishments in Turkey, Italy, and Britain;

(c) Less than six weeks after the Alsop-Bartlett article ap
peared, White House sources announced that American bases in
Turkey and Italy were being abandoned- over the protests of
both governments—and that similar action in Britain was
pending.
However, the American people have been solemnly advised
that no deal with Mr. Khrushchev was made. The United Slates
is but implementing Robert McNamara’s long impending pro
gram of replacing supposedly obsolete, hard-cased, first-strike,
missiles with submarine-based Polaris bissiles. And any fool
shoidd realize that missiles stationed on the backs of rolling
submarines in high seas are infinitely more accurate than their
hard-cased, land-grounded counterparts.
Moreover, one is continually reminded that Mr. Kennedy’s
truthfulness is beyond reproach. One should trust one’s leaders;
unlike other white men, they would never speak with a forked
tongue. Take, for instance, the President’s statements to the
American people for the past four months with regard to Cuba;
(1) Nine days before his celebrated speech of October 22,
Mr. Kennedy was stumping across Indiana, proclaiming for all
to hear that no intermediate range missile bases had been estab
lished in Cuba; and that any politician calling for a blockade of
Cuba “ought to be kept home by the voters and replaced by one
who understands what the Twentieth Century is all about.”
(New York “Times.” October 14. p. 1.) But, 10, in the next few
days, 25 medium-range missile bases sprang, like tobacco leaf,
from the fertile Cuban soil. It seems as if things grow quickly
in the tropics.
(2) Before and around October 22, the White House as
sured the American people that no Soviet troops had been
stationed in Cuba and only four to five thousand technicians
were to be found there. But on January 24, the President stated
that between 16,000 and 17,000 soldiers and technicians are pres
ently In Cuba and alNHit 4,500 have been withdrawn since Octo
ber. a different story from that which he was peddling to the
nation before the election, isn’t it? His abacus must not have
been functioning properly in October.
(3) Since November, the President has repeatedly assured
the American people that all intermediate range missiles have
been removed from Cuba. But when questioned on the matter
in his press conference of February 7, he was forced to admit:
“It may be there are hidden away some missiles. Nobody can
prove in the finite sense, that they are not there, or they may
be brought in.” It seems as if nothing is a sure thing these days.
It therefore appears as if the discrepancies between fact and
each of the President’s former utterances may be viewed in any
of three ways: Mr. Kennedy has either been telling bare faced
lies to his constituents; or he simply doesn’t know what he is
talking about a good deal of the time; or both. I can envisage
no other alternatives.
Well, then, does the removal of American missile bases from
Turkey and Italy signify a rather shady deal with Khrushchev?
Or does it merely mean that Robert McNamara’s new program
of nuclear deterrence is being put into operation? I suppose
you pays your money and you takes your choice.
If Mr. Kennedy has shaded the truth in each of the fore
named instances, (albeit, covering his tracks rather ineptly)
there is little reason lo believe that a transaction was not made
with Khrushchev; and that removal of the bases is but crass,
Stevensonian appeasement. But this should surprise no one.
After all, Walter Lippmann seems to see in Mr. Kennedy all of
the attributes which he once saw in his idol, Adlai Stevenson—
save one. “Mr. Kennedy’s image,” wrote Lippmann in 1960, "is
so masculine.”
And, if the President actually agreed to remove the American
bases in exchange for Khrushchev’s pledge to refrain from
future arms shipments to Cuba, Senator Kenneth Keating’s
reports of a recent and massive military buildup on the island
indicate that Mr. Kennedy is not only a prevaricator. He is an
inexcusably poor horse trader.
However, if one chooses the second alternative—that Mr.
Kennedy, though truthful, simply doesn’t know what he is talk
ing about a good deal of the time—may heaven help the country.
It is doubtful if the President will be able to.
But under any circumstances, one may hope that Mr. Mc-
Namara’s latest undertaking is somewhat more successful than
his greatest venture while president of the Ford Company: It
was production of something called the Edsel.
Franklin D. Roosevelt distinguished himself with the New
Deal. Harry Truman followed suit with the Fair Deal. And it
appears as if John F. Kennedy may long bo remembered for
the Shady Deal.
Perhaps I am becoming suspicious in my old age, hut it
seems a bit more than coincidental that:
(a) During the Cuban crisis, Premier Khrushchev mag
nanimously offered to withdraw all bombers and intermediate
range missiles from Cuba if the United States would abandon
all missile establishments in Turkey, Italy, and Britain;
(b) In the December 10 issue of the “Saturday Evening
Post,” Stewart Alsop and Charles Bartlett—two of the Presi
dent’s closest friends and most trusted contacts with the press
—disclosed that Adlai Stevenson favored evacuation of the fore
named bases for reciprocal Soviet action in Cuba; <At his name,
