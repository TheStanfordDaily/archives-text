# CAMPUS OPINION
## Rarely Done 'Phormio' in One-Acts 
### STEVEN GILBORN 
(Editors’ note: Steven Gilborn is a graduate student in
Speech and Drama, and is directing “The Phormio,” one of the
plays for the Ram’s Head 1963 Winter One-Acts, which opens
this Friday in Little Theatre.)
Any campus teems with a breed of theater-goer who is as
frustrating as he is frustrated. He attends a play expecting the
actors to present his interpretation of it, an interpretation he has
adduced in the privacy of his own home; he suffers critical
short-circuits at every moment, as the actors refuse to perform
his reading, which he knows is definitive; and he departs un
delighted, nothing in his being confirmed except his worst sus
picions.
Because this is so, I am happy to he directing Terence, and
not Shakespeare or Ibsen. The piece is rarely performed, and
there has never been a staging of this translation, an honest and
eminently playable one by Daniel Arnaud. You probably have
never seen the play, and so have no preconceived notions about
how it should be interpreted. That gives me a fine opportunity
to play fast and loose with the script, and lam taking it.
Every director must take the opportunity. Any play that
admits but one interpretation is probably not worth his sweat;
and if it admits of more, he has to choose. Humbly, knowing
that he is omitting possibilities—-but knowing too that if he tries
to express all the meanings of a script he will convey none. To
direct is to select, to make a coherent series of decisions that
will affect everything the audience gets, and lead it, not merely
to meaning, but to the experience of meaning. What happens to
you as spectator must have the richness and uncontradictability
of a vision; and to afford you that, the director must pick a
version.
So: to those who bring their productions to the theater with
them, I would say, “Wouldn’t it be incredible if another man’s
conception of this play did correspond to yours? If your imagi
nation and his were identical? How depressing. How dangerous.”
Your imagination, like your mind, grows only by forsaking its
settlements for the wilderness. Be willing to risk your certainty,
because, will you or no, that is what you are always doing—
when you take a different route, when you go homo for holidays,
certainly when you visit the theater.
You can defer the risk: always go the same way, never
leave home, never visit the theater. But in two cases, time will
expose your folly, by ripping up your road and tearing down
your house. And if you are willing to confront time and your
folly, to pursue your curiosity beyond the edge of light, you will
also be willing to go to the theater.
What will you find? I promise you a lion in your living
room. I should reassure you, though, that “Phormio” contains
no such monsters. Just a couple of rich boys with girl problems
and pompous fathers; and a funny slave; and a parasite. That
is “Phormio,” who has never let poverty spoil his appetite, and
who knows which folks buy the best brands. So lock your larder
and come to the theater. Do more than that—come to the play.

Your imagination, like your mind, grows only by forsaking its
settlements for the wilderness. Be willing to risk your certainty,
because, will you or no, that is what you are always doing—
when you take a different route, when you go homo for holidays,
certainly when you visit the theater.
You can defer the risk: always go the same way, never
leave home, never visit the theater. But in two cases, time will
expose your folly, by ripping up your road and tearing down
your house. And if you are willing to confront time and your
folly, to pursue your curiosity beyond the edge of light, you will
also be willing to go to the theater.
What will you find? I promise you a lion in your living
room. I should reassure you, though, that “Phormio” contains
no such monsters. Just a couple of rich boys with girl problems
and pompous fathers; and a funny slave; and a parasite. That
is “Phormio,” who has never let poverty spoil his appetite, and
who knows which folks buy the best brands. So lock your larder
and come to the theater. Do more than that—come to the play.
(Editors’ note: Steven Gilborn is a graduate student in
Speech and Drama, and is directing “The Phormio,” one of the
plays for the Ram’s Head 1963 Winter One-Acts, which opens
this Friday in Little Theatre.)
Any campus teems with a breed of theater-goer who is as
frustrating as he is frustrated. He attends a play expecting the
actors to present his interpretation of it, an interpretation he has
adduced in the privacy of his own home; he suffers critical
short-circuits at every moment, as the actors refuse to perform
his reading, which he knows is definitive; and he departs un
delighted, nothing in his being confirmed except his worst sus
picions.
Because this is so, I am happy to he directing Terence, and
not Shakespeare or Ibsen. The piece is rarely performed, and
there has never been a staging of this translation, an honest and
eminently playable one by Daniel Arnaud. You probably have
never seen the play, and so have no preconceived notions about
how it should be interpreted. That gives me a fine opportunity
to play fast and loose with the script, and lam taking it.
Every director must take the opportunity. Any play that
admits but one interpretation is probably not worth his sweat;
and if it admits of more, he has to choose. Humbly, knowing
that he is omitting possibilities—-but knowing too that if he tries
to express all the meanings of a script he will convey none. To
direct is to select, to make a coherent series of decisions that
will affect everything the audience gets, and lead it, not merely
to meaning, but to the experience of meaning. What happens to
you as spectator must have the richness and uncontradictability
of a vision; and to afford you that, the director must pick a
version.
So: to those who bring their productions to the theater with
them, I would say, “Wouldn’t it be incredible if another man’s
conception of this play did correspond to yours? If your imagi
nation and his were identical? How depressing. How dangerous.”
