# Card Ruggers Slosh To 25-3 Win in Mud
## 
### FETE KING Daily Sports Editor 
In a game that resembled water
polo at its most rugged, the Stan
ford rugby team slogged its way I
through the lain and mud for a
hard-earned 25-3 win Saturday i
over the undermanned Peninsula
Ramblers. A crowd of some 50 j
hard core rugby followers watch-1
ed the proceedings, held for the '
most part in a downpour.
THE MUD and the' sizeable]
! rain puddles slowed the game’s
j pace to a crawl. Laterals from
| scrums never got past the second
man, since no one could hang on |
| to the slippery ball. Tackled ball !
| carriers skidded 20 feet, sending
I up geysers of mud and spray, j
! Breakaway I tins degeneiated into

| a mass soccer dribble, with four
| or five men kicking the ball down
‘ field by sheer weight of num
i hers. This resulted in many' pen
j ally kicks for illegal blocking,
but since most of them went low,
they hardly changed the nature
j of the game.
j Just about everyone was in on
the scoring for the Indians, as
| coach Pete Kmetovic put in the
reserves after Stanford had rolled
jup an insurmountable 17-0 half
time lead.
FRANK PATITUCCI started
things off by falling on the ball
1 after a dribbling rush for a try.
i Moments later, Hank Mac Queen
| scored another try from a five
yard scrum, and the Cards led.
j 6-0.
After the mud bogged down
j both teams, Card Gordon Wad
j dell got off one of his many
booming kicks, the ball rolled to
the end zone, and Tim Hansel fell
on it for the score. The Indians
j missed their third conversion,
and settled for a 9-0 margin.
By this time the Ramblers were
tiring fast, and Stanford’s excel
lent running attack, which should
| have been blunted by the slippery
[ field, began to move the ball with
[ ease.
[ Steve Van Nort dashed 25 yards
from a scrum to score, John Carl
son tallied on a 10-yarder. and
Gary Lofgren booted one of two
conversions for a 17-0 halftime
bulge.
THE RAMBLERS avoided a
shutout when Mike Ruiz scored
a penalty kick, but Stanford came
right back when Bob Price scored
a try from close in, and Braden
Beck kicked the extra two points.
Bob Burke put on the finishing
touch with a power rush down
the right side, shedding tacklers
right and left for the score and
25-3.
The Indians controlled the ball
about three-fourths of the game,
dominating the scrums and most
of the lineouts, and got superior
kicking, principally from Wad
dell and Dick Ragsdale. This was
a crucial factor, since rainy
weather strategy' calls for giving
your opponent the ball in his
territory to make him handle it.
The Ramblers were even more
j butterfingered than the Cards,
and never threatened to score.
| The win gave the Tribe a 3-1
1 season mark, their only' loss com
| ing at the hands of Universities
| Club two weeks ago.
The Stanford JV’s won an 8-0
| game under equally sloppy' con
ditions from the Ramblers’ “B”
i team, giving them a 4-1 record
I for the year.
