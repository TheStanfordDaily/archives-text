# Dallmar Gives Hinckley Credit For Tribe Win
## 
### 
BERKELEY (UPIi Coach
I Howie Dallmar of eighth-ranked
Stanford yesterday listed “the!
breaks” and a sophomore named ■
Kent Hinckley as the factors that
carried the Indians’ basketball
team to their clutch win over
UCLA last Saturday.
“Everything broke just right
for us against UCLA,” Dallmar
said of the 86-78 win over the
Bruins. “Hinckley is a guard hut
we tried him at forward because
not many of the other forwards
have been hitting in double fig
ures.”
Hinckley, a sophomore, put
away four field goals from the
outside during the first half to
get the Indians off to a good
start against the Bruins. South
ern Cal had upset the Indians.
61-57, the previous night.
Dallmar told the Northern Cali
fornia Basketball Writers Associ
ation that Hinckley “would see a
lot of action” in this weekend’s
tilts with California.
