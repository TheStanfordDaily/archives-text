# Three Professors Lead Arts, Sciences Hostel
## 
### 
Limited signups arc now being
taken in the ASSU office for this
week’s hostel on “The Peaceful
Co-existence of the Humanities
and Sciences.” The meetings will
feature Dr. Ralph Smith, Profes
sor of Electrical Engineering, Dr.
Donald Kennedy of the Biology
Department, and Dr. Wallace
Stegner, Director of Creative
Writing.
Discussion will probably center
around whether or not the sci
ences are supporting the humani
ties. whether the humanities
merit more financial support,
the similarities and differences of
teaching approaches, and possible
ways to correlate programs.
