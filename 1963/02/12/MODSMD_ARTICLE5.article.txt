# Trustees May Act On Constitution In March or April
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees will per
haps act on the proposed ASSU
constitution and the issue of on
campus politics at its March
meeting, but probably no action
will be taken until April. Assist
ant to the President Fred Glover
said yesterday.
February’s board meeting next
Thursday will be taken up by the
annual budget. “We would like
to have action on these issues
completed at the March meeting
before the Spring Elections, but
due to the importance of the is
sues raised and the amount of
pressure that is being brought to
hear, it may be impossible to act
that soon,” Glover said.

Ho said the trustees disap
proved of the section in the new
constitution disclaiming ASSU
responsibility for student organ
izations, but said that other than
that the constitution was gener
ally well-received by the trustees.
The constitution must be accepted
or rejected in full.
Under the new constitution,
any group could organize, but
would be forced to disband if it
violated University policy. Under
the present constitution, a group
must be approved before it can
form.
Glover described some of the
complexities of on-campus poli
tics. "LASSU may not be the best
institution for expressing student
stands, as it only gives one view,
the majority’s.
Glover sketched the relation
ship of the President and the
Board of Trustees. The Founding
Grant gives the trustees respon
sibility for the University; they
delegate a large part of this re
sponsibility to the President.
They must approve most of his
recommendations, which they
normally do, as it w'ould he con
sidered by the President a vote
of “no confidence” if the trustees
rejected his recommendations.
This docs not mean that the
trustees are merely a rubber
stamp. If President Sterling were
to recommend a radical change
in the policy on on-campus poli
| tics, Glover gave as an example,
j the trustees would probably turn
I it down, in which case they would
I probably be looking for a new
I President.
