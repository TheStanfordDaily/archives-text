# Ram's Head Rehearses; One-Acts Open Friday
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS 
Final rehearsals are now in progress for Ram’s Head’s 1963
Winter One-Acts, which open Friday in Little Theater.
“We’ve had some problems,” admitted producer Fred Brandt.
“Some of the cast members were in “The Matchmaker,” as was
one of the directors. Another of the directors is in one of the other

plays. And some actors are in
more than one one-act. But it’s
working out. We’ll be ready Fri
day night.”
Brandt also called attention to
the fact that the curtain time for
each of the live performances
will be 8 p.m. rather than 8:30
p.m.
ALL THREE plays, unlike past
years, are comedies. The first
play, ‘‘Lion in the Living Room.”
is an avant-garde comedy by Brad
Efron. ‘‘lt’s about an American
family,” explained director Robin
Brown. “The family is living in
the bathroom because there is a
lion in their living room. The play
is an interesting and thought
provoking comment on contem
porary society.”
Second on the program is
“Where There's a Will, There’s a
Play,” an Elizabethan farce writ
ten and directed by Dave Kirk.
Kirk, author of last year’s highly
acclaimed one-act, “The Inquisi
tion.” has done extensive research
for his play. "I looked up Shake
speare In an encyclopedia,” he
said.
“THEN I READ some stuff in
Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations
and threw in some of the best
linos. And to top it off, I came up
with this absolutely brilliant an
swer to the question, ‘Who wrote
Shakespeare’s plays?’ Not only is
it brilliant, but it will make every
bod happy,” Kirk said.
Completing the trio is “The
Phormio,” Dan Arnaul's now and
witty translation of the Latin
Classic by Terence. “Actually,”
commented director Steven Gil
born, “Terence adapted his play
from a Greek play by Apollodor
us.” “The Phormio,” longest of
the three one-acts, deals with the
romantic adventures of two
young men while their fathers
are away, and the complications
that ensue when their fathers re
turn.
