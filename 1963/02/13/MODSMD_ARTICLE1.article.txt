“A good athletic program will create enthusiasm, hut first you
need the enthusiasm to create the athletic program,” said Stan
ford’s new head football coach, John Ralston, in a talk last night,
presented hy the Stanford Today and Tomorrow Committee.
During the course of his talk, he introduced some members

of his staff: Dutch Fehring, who
was on the staff last year, and
new members, Frank Williams,
defensive coach, and Bob Gam
bold. backfiold coach. Afterwards
he answered some of the ques
tions students had about the ath
letic program.
Throughout his talk, Ralston
stressed the importance of every
one getting behind the athletic
program, saying, “we can’t win
without the help of you, the stu
dents, and the faculty.”
THE COACH said that the ath
letic program provides a tie be
tween alumni and the school be
cause the alumni are proud of
the university, but often they
can’t find any information about
Stanford, until they turn to the
sports page.
“It is the non-athlete who de
velops pride in a school’s athletic
program after he graduates,”
Ralston said. “All of you will
have that pride later on in life.
Why not develop it now?”
He also stressed the importance
of winning, saying, “Whether you
like the idea or not, winning is
important. The best education is
worthless without some competi
tive spirit.
“THERE IS a saying, ‘it’s not
whether you won or lost, but how
you played the game’,” he said.
“Imagine going into a doctor’s
office and seeing a sign like ‘it’s
not whether the patient lives or
dies, but how you make the in
cision’.”

Asked about de-emphasis and
the value of a major football
schedule for the 80 per cent of
Stanford students who do not
participate in inter collegiate ath
letics, Ralston replied that the
sport generates enthusiasm in the
university, and provides an in
teresting contest for the specta
tors.

On the value of playing a ma
jor schedule, he said, “Being a
major university, if we have a
program why not have the best
program? We are a major uni
versity and we are going to have
the best program,”
“WE WILE do more running,
but we will keep the offense flex
ible,” he said in answer to a
question on whether he favored
running or passing. “One makes
the other go; you have got to
have both.”

Discussing the problems of the
Stanford athletic program Ral
ston refuted the idea that intel
lect and athletics don’t mix.
“An athlete is an athlete. For
him pride is everything. He wants
to egt bettor. And if he is on the
squad he had better be proud,”
ho said, adding that it is the
same situation in academics, that
a student has to take pride in his
work.

“A LOT of people have asked
mo if I would be satisfied with
three wins or four, or five. We’ll
never bo satisfied until we win
them all.”
The coach talked about Stan
ford's football recruiting system,
and what the university offered
to prospective athletes, explain
ing what the staff looked for in
prospective athletes, and adding
that the university is considering
trying a junior college program
to increase the number of JC ath
letes transferring to Stanford.
mmmmmmmm—mmm.
