## 
### RALPH PEER 
Eleven Rineonada freshmen hiked fifty miles from the San
Jose State library to the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco yes
terday.
In an attempt to prove that physical fitness is not limited only
to athletes, twenty-nine men began the trek at 9:02 p.m. Mon-

day. At the suggestion of the
army, they were supplied with
chocolate, raisins, and Metrecal.
Bruce Wiggins set the initial
pace of 120 steps per minute, but
had to drop out when stricken by

cramps.
Seventeen others loft the march
at various points along El Ca
mino Real. Kirk Jensen walked
along Bayshore, and beat the
main group by half an hour.
The fifty-mile hike is a new
fad that is sweeping the country
in response to President Ken
nedy’s Physical Fitness program.
Jeff Mason and Randy Larson
were responsible for Rinconada’s
participation. They decided to
dress in suits, ties, and derby
hats to stress the cultural, as op
posed to the scientific or athletic,
aspects of the march.
The Fairmont Hotel was
chosen as the final goal because
“it’s a neat place.”
A group of six men from Cedro
making the occasion one for
competition, started out after the
Rinconada hikers and beat them
to the finish.
The most troublesome hin
drance to the marchers was the
constant presence of press pho
tographers who kept stopping the
participants and asking them to
pose for pictures.
Typical was the case of Ray
Handley: He removed his shoes
and socks to walk in some grass
and ease his aching feet. He had
just put his shoes back on when
a photographer rushed up to him.
made him take (hem off again
and pose as if in acute pain.
Hadley said, “The worst thing
about it was that I didn't have
my tie on.”
The marchers carried a plac
ard with a quotation from Aris
totle reading “No excellent soul
is exempt from a mixture of
madness.”
The men at first tried to sing
Stanford songs as they marched
but quit when they found they
couldn’t remember the words.

couldn’t remember the words.
Eleven Rineonada freshmen hiked fifty miles from the San
Jose State library to the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco yes
terday.
In an attempt to prove that physical fitness is not limited only
to athletes, twenty-nine men began the trek at 9:02 p.m. Mon-

day. At the suggestion of the
army, they were supplied with
chocolate, raisins, and Metrecal.
Bruce Wiggins set the initial
pace of 120 steps per minute, but
had to drop out when stricken by

cramps.
Seventeen others loft the march
at various points along El Ca
mino Real. Kirk Jensen walked
along Bayshore, and beat the
main group by half an hour.
The fifty-mile hike is a new
fad that is sweeping the country
in response to President Ken
nedy’s Physical Fitness program.
Jeff Mason and Randy Larson
were responsible for Rinconada’s
participation. They decided to
dress in suits, ties, and derby
hats to stress the cultural, as op
posed to the scientific or athletic,
aspects of the march.
The Fairmont Hotel was
chosen as the final goal because
“it’s a neat place.”
A group of six men from Cedro
making the occasion one for
competition, started out after the
Rinconada hikers and beat them
to the finish.
The most troublesome hin
drance to the marchers was the
constant presence of press pho
tographers who kept stopping the
participants and asking them to
pose for pictures.
Typical was the case of Ray
Handley: He removed his shoes
and socks to walk in some grass
and ease his aching feet. He had
just put his shoes back on when
a photographer rushed up to him.

and pose as if in acute pain.
Hadley said, “The worst thing
about it was that I didn't have
my tie on.”
The marchers carried a plac
ard with a quotation from Aris
totle reading “No excellent soul
is exempt from a mixture of
madness.”
The men at first tried to sing
Stanford songs as they marched
but quit when they found they
couldn’t remember the words.
