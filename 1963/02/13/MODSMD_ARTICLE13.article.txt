# Decision on Constitution Necessary
## 
### 
Doan of Students H. Donald Winbiglor lias stated that the
Board of Trustees will make no final decision on the proposed
ASSU constitution until March or April. Other Ins'll Admin
istrative sources have said that the reasons for this delay are
the importance of the decision and the pressures that have
been brought to bear.
The proposed ASSU constitution was overwhelmingly ap
proved in the student election held last November 26. Since
that time, there have been two meetings of the Board of
Trustees. There is another meeting next Thursday. Legislature
is immobilized: the old members can not act because they are
not representative, and, in the eyes of the student body, have
been replaced by the new LASSU; the new members must sit,
wasting their mandates, while they wait for a final decision.
Three months have passed. There has been ample time for
discussion and consideration of the factors which are prevent
ing a decision on the constitution. We realize that the Board
of Trustees is anxious to make a considered, rational decision.
It seems, however, that the decision is taking too long. Budget
ary matters, PACE, and new plans for the University take
precedence in the Trusteesâ€™ minds over student affairs. Yet
students are the reasons for the existence of the University.
Their plans and aspirations should be paramount in the minds
of men trying to run a University. The new constitution repre
sents much thought and effort on the part of the students.
It deserves a prompt decision. Student government should
be left in limbo no longer.
