# CAMPUS OPINION
## Overseas Program Worthwhile' 
### MICHAEL WALSH 
Judging from his two articles of last week, Temp Peck
seems unable to understand the moaning and intent of Stanford
University in sending nearly 40 per cent of each class overseas
to study for six months. Indeed, the goals of the Overseas Study
Program remain “nebulous” to him. As an alumnus of the same
study Center as Mr. Peck (Tours), let me comment on some of
the aspects of the program which he may have overlooked.
First and foremost, the program is an extension of the
General Studies Program and the concept of a liberal education.
As such it is designed as an exposure to, but not an immersion
in, the culture and language of a foreign people.
Generally speaking, the Overseas Program presents the stu
dent with a four-fold opportunity.
First, the student has the opportunity to follow his regular
Stanford academic program so that he may graduate in four
years. With military obligations and the increasing pressure to
attend graduate school, this is important to many students.
Second, the program provides the student with the oppor
tunity to learn a significant portion of a foreign language, and
enables the determined student to establish a meaningful rela
tionship with a foreign people.
Third, the program gives the student a chance to see and
appreciate a large portion of Europe. Three-day weekends, a
ten-day field trip each quarter, and a three-week vacation at
Christmas may be well used.
Finally, the program offers the student a unique experience
in small group living. An excellent cross section of Stanford
students has an opportunity to know and appreciate each other’s
strengths and weaknesses in an atmosphere far removed from
the everyday hustle-bustle of the Quad.
Concisely stated, this is the program as I see it—a four
faceted opportunity from which the student must pick and
choose according to his desires and abilities.
What the program is not is evident. It is not a junior year
abroad, nor is it a program designed exclusively for language
majors or future Foreign Service officers. It is a program de
signed to provide a large number of well qualified students with
an opportunity to study, live and travel abroad—an opportunity
they might not otherwise have.
The program makes no attempt to serve the students on a
silver platter. Learning a language, meeting a foreign people,
and making good use of free travel time is hard work. But this
is a strength, not a weakness, of the program. That some stu
dents do not take advantage of what is offered is not a failing of
the program but a weakness in the student. The student who is
already well versed in the language and culture of a country
may find another program more inviting. However, he should re
alize this before, not after, he loaves for Europe.
The pi’esent program is an excellent experience for the con
sciencious student who wishes to lay the foundations of a real
cultural appreciation and understanding.
