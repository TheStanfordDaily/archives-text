# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Summerskin' Shows 'Greatness' 
### Philip DeGuere 
Ten years ago in Argentina, Leopoldo Torre-Nilsson began
making films; since (hat lime he has established himself as one
of the foremost film makers of the world, and has been the
leader of a film production industry second only to that of Mexi
co in Latin America. Last spring Nilsson’s “Summerskin” (“Piel
de Verano") had its American premiere in New York where it
drew startled admiration from the film critics. This film, which
established Nilsson’s greatness in American eyes, is now showing
at the Fine Arts in Palo Alto.
The story is tragic and uncomplicated. Marcela, a young
Argentine aristocrat, is presented with an offer from her grand
mother to entertain the latter’s stepson during the summer.
The young man, Marlin, has some rare, incurable disease and is
expected to die by autumn. Although Marcela has loathed her
half-cousin for years, the prespect of a complete Dior collection
and a year in Paris convinces her.
Martin arrives, obviously in love with Marcela. She feigns a
similar feeling for him, and they pass a hectic, happy three
months. As autumn comes, Martin returns to the hospital to find
himself miraculously cured. He returns to claim his love, is
refused, and shoots himself.
Around this simple plot Nilsson has built up a film of
tragic beauty. He has pulled from his leading actors beautiful
and moving performances.
Graciela Borges, as Marcela, blends love with uncertainty
in just the right amount to fool Martin, but not herself. Her
extraordinary beauty stands out all the more because of the ter
rible game she is playing. But for Martin it is no game, and
Alfredo Alc6n has managed to make a potentially pitiful role
into one of convincing courage. His portrayal of a man living
under the spectre of death is magnificent.
But the greatness of the film lies in Nilsson camera work,
for he has made his tool an intricate part of the story. It does
not merely tell the story; its movements are fluid and eloquent,
never static, always probing the consciousness of the actors
as it draws the spectator deeper and deeper into the web of the
action. It is restless as it finds new angles from which to com
ment and explain. The result is a film of such penetrating
beauty that it leaves the audience breathless.
The tragedy of the film is not Martin’s death. It is instead
the fact that such apparent happiness as he and Marcela found
that summer was only a farce, as intangible as the suntan which
fades with autumn. It is the fact that Marcela was too con
vincing in her role, that her false love was 100 real. And it is
the fact that Leopoldo Torre-Nilsson surely one of the most
gifted directors of the decade, can find so much to condemn in
humanity.

similar feeling for him, and they pass a hectic, happy three
months. As autumn comes, Martin returns to the hospital to find
himself miraculously cured. He returns to claim his love, is
refused, and shoots himself.
Around this simple plot Nilsson has built up a film of
tragic beauty. He has pulled from his leading actors beautiful
and moving performances.
Graciela Borges, as Marcela, blends love with uncertainty
in just the right amount to fool Martin, but not herself. Her
extraordinary beauty stands out all the more because of the ter
rible game she is playing. But for Martin it is no game, and
Alfredo Alc6n has managed to make a potentially pitiful role
into one of convincing courage. His portrayal of a man living
under the spectre of death is magnificent.
But the greatness of the film lies in Nilsson camera work,
for he has made his tool an intricate part of the story. It does
not merely tell the story; its movements are fluid and eloquent,
never static, always probing the consciousness of the actors
as it draws the spectator deeper and deeper into the web of the
action. It is restless as it finds new angles from which to com
ment and explain. The result is a film of such penetrating
beauty that it leaves the audience breathless.
The tragedy of the film is not Martin’s death. It is instead
the fact that such apparent happiness as he and Marcela found
that summer was only a farce, as intangible as the suntan which
fades with autumn. It is the fact that Marcela was too con
vincing in her role, that her false love was 100 real. And it is
the fact that Leopoldo Torre-Nilsson surely one of the most
gifted directors of the decade, can find so much to condemn in
humanity.
Ten years ago in Argentina, Leopoldo Torre-Nilsson began
making films; since (hat lime he has established himself as one
of the foremost film makers of the world, and has been the
leader of a film production industry second only to that of Mexi
co in Latin America. Last spring Nilsson’s “Summerskin” (“Piel
de Verano") had its American premiere in New York where it
drew startled admiration from the film critics. This film, which
established Nilsson’s greatness in American eyes, is now showing
at the Fine Arts in Palo Alto.
The story is tragic and uncomplicated. Marcela, a young
Argentine aristocrat, is presented with an offer from her grand
mother to entertain the latter’s stepson during the summer.
The young man, Marlin, has some rare, incurable disease and is
expected to die by autumn. Although Marcela has loathed her
half-cousin for years, the prespect of a complete Dior collection
and a year in Paris convinces her.
Martin arrives, obviously in love with Marcela. She feigns a
similar feeling for him, and they pass a hectic, happy three
months. As autumn comes, Martin returns to the hospital to find
himself miraculously cured. He returns to claim his love, is
refused, and shoots himself.
