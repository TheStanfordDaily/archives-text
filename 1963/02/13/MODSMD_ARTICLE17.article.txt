# The
						Mandrake'; 'Fiery, Hilarious'

### LEE PROJECTOR 
Niccolo Machiavelli’s classic Italian comedy “The Man
drake” is receiving hilai’ious and fiery production on Monday
nights at the Comedia Theater in Menlo Park.
To an extent, “The Mandrake” is comparable to William
Congreve’s Restoration comedy “The Way of the World,” both
being of the genre of social criticism bordering on social anni
hilation. “The Mandrake” is the story of a successful attempt
at cuckoldry, involving a vastly entertaining conspiracy of lover,
manipulator, mother, friar, and the cuckold himself, all con
spiring to have the scrupulous young wife, Madonna Lucrezia,
“ravished.”
The key to the success of the play and the production is the
adept fusion of “straight” comedy and satirical power. Director
Eric Silins has executed both most marvelously. The “comedy”
ranges from creative stage business to the more subtle creation
of a tone, a tone of effervescent wickedness. Simultaneously,
the serious concerns of Machiavelli are made manifest. The Pro
logue decries this “bitter” hour (16th century Florence), be
moaning Italy’s “decline from ancient worth” (the imagined
virtue of his Roman ancestors being a thing with Machiavelli).
Friar Timoteo, played by director Silins, epitomizes Machiavelli’s
concept of Florentine degeneracy, as he garners “contributions”
and promises the young wife that he will “even intercede with
the angel Raphael” on her behalf. Charles Botsford as Ligurio,
the manipulating parasite, exhibits a careful understanding of
the play. He utilizes hypocrisy and deceit as casually as we use
knives and forks at the dinner table; and that is Machiavelli’s
entire concern. One of Ligurio’s throw-away lines, “Florence is
a great city.” rings with Machiavelli’s own ironic laughter.
Jerry Grant as Callimaco, the hot young man, supports the
main action very effectively. Despite the actor’s occasional dis
play of simple nervousness, he holds the audience in rapture as
he writhes and wriggles under the thrall of his lust. Robert
Perkins, the husband, creates a strong portrayal of a not undif
ficult role, being, in the last analysis, simply an object of ridi
cule. Carolyn Davis, as the wife who ultimately succumbs to
the way of the world, is excellent, as she is transmuted from a
pious young woman to a rosy adulteress. John Allan and Carole
Warren as “The Prologue” and “A Widow” respectively, infuse
their small parts with the full-scale meaning Machiavelli intend
ed as their portions. Robert Wiederhold, as the standard clever
servant, handles his low comedy exuberantly and needs only to
develop somewhat more cynicism in order to integrate more
directly with the other players. Elizabeth Retting, in the un
rewarding part of the mother, is adequate, if unrewarding.
August Guido’s set captures a reasonable essence
tia” in an area not much bigger than a tnan’,s hand. And Jeanne
Schultz’s costumes deserve special credit for purposeful selec
tion and striking attractiveness.
This production is unreservedly recommended. Produced at
never-a-dull-minute pace, “The Mandrake” convulses its audience,
while pouring acid on the times. Those who seek pure enter
tainment will find it here in abundance. Yet, in the words of
Stanford’s Visiting Professor of Dramatic Literature Theodore
Hoffman. “If you take it at all seriously, it’s quite frightening.”
Finally, those who want to study the “Weltschmerz” of Machia
velli will find in this moralistic comedy strong support for the
modern hypothesis that “The Prince” is political satire. For
“The Mandrake” is not, as the program note would have it,
“frankly amoral.” The director and cast fortunately seem not to
have read their program note, for the Comedia’s production of
“The Mandrake” leaves no doubt that it contains more morality
than a hundred Broadway sex comedies.
“The Mandrake” receives American production rather less
often than Halley’s comet. This neglect is unwarranted, and the
Comedia’s production deserves attendance. The Comedia’s Mon
day Evening Series of classical and original plays is on a basis
of free admission.
