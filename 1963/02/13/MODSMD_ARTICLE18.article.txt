Editors, The Daily:
There seems to he a great deal of controversy going on
about Armin Rosencranz’s letter. The Administration’s mad,
LASSU’s mad about the Administration being mad, and if they
keep at it, the student body might even get a little bit perturbed.
Who cares?
Picayune though this uproar is, it has brought a question
to mind: does Armin Rosencranz, or even LASSU, have a right
to speak for the Stanford student body?
Technically, I suppose, he does. Even though a majority of
the students didn’t even vote, he was nonetheless elected. But I
have heard quite a few comments to the effect that Rosencranz
was elected by a majority of a minority gung-ho enough to make
it to the polls, and since this is true, he should not speak for the
Stanford student body. These comments have validity, but, as
stated above, Mr. Rosencranz is nonetheless technically, though
not actually, the representative of the students.
A quite simple solution to controversies of this nature
comes to my mind, and that is simply to make membership in
ASSU voluntary. Every freshman, during pre-reg, should be
given a piece of paper, to sign and turn in, that says: “I (do, do
not) wish to be a member of the Associated Students of Stan
ford University.” A student would be allowed to cancel his mem
bership at any time, and only members would be allowed to vote
in elections. Then the President of ASSU could write letters to
his heart’s content, noting on each letter, of course, that the
organization he heads comprises, say, 26Vs per cent of the stu
dents at Stanford. The Administration would still be mad, of
course, and so would LASSU; but at least we, the unenlightened
and unvoting majority, wouldn’t have anything to complain
about and wouldn’t be involved.
But, as I have said above, who really cares anyway?
