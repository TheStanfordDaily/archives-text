## WSU Cancellation Hurts Dose's Scoring 
### Glenn Alford 
A week and a half ago, the Stanford-Washington State basket
ball game was cancelled because the driver of the Stanford bus
refused to try to drive over icy roads to Pullman, Washington, where
the game was scheduled to be played. Many Stanford basketball fans
thought this was hilariously funny, but Stanford center Tom Dose
isn’t laughing.
The cancellation quite possibly could cost Dose the all-time Stan
ford season scoring record set in 1953 by Rom Tomsic. Tomsio
poured 515 points through the nets as a sophomore that year to break
Hank Luisetti’s top mark of 465 points. Two years later, Tomsic
again broke Luisetti’s best with 482 points.
At present, Dose is averaging just a shade under 20 points per
game, at 19.994. If continued, this average would set a Stanford

record, but would drop Dose short
of Tomsic’s 515. When Ron made
the mark he played in 27 games.
Dose would have played 25
games, but the cancellation
makes it 24. Should Dose continue
to score at his present rate, he
would score 480 points, topping
Luisetti’s best, but a wee hit short
of Tomsic’s second best of 482,
and far back from his 515.
AS SAID before, Dose’s aver
age p.p.g. of 19.994 is the best in
Stanford history. No Card has
averaged over 20. Tomsic current
ly holds the record, 19.28, set in
1955. When Tomsic set the season
total point mark he averaged
19.01. Luisetti’s best average was
17.22.
Dose is currently 13th in the
all-time Stanford scoring totals.
With his 23 against UCLA he
moved ahead of Ed Tucker, who

totaled 791 in two years, 1951-2. Dose is in excellent position to move
up to eighth in the all-time standings, ahead of Jim Walsh, John
Arillaga, John Windsor, Bill Stephensen and George Yardley. All
those mentioned scored their totals in three years. If Dose keeps on
averaging 20, he will have 922 points for his two-year career total.
He would then need only 495 points his senior year to break Tomsic’s
career record of 1416, a mark set in four years. As it stands now,
Dose can’t miss shattering Tomsic’s career average record of 17.48.
The 6-8 center already holds most of the Stanford Frosh scoring
marks. He has a Frosh high of 38, a season total of 313, and an
average of 19.6.

A bug on statistics would notice a curious thing about the 19G2-.3
Stanford basketball season. On Saturday, the Indians are very, very
good, but Friday they are quite often just plain lousy. Three of the
five Stanford losses have been applied on Friday, the others on a
Wednesday and Thursday in the Los Angeles Classic. Overall Stan
ford is 2-4 on Friday, and 7-0 on Saturday.
AMONG THE FRIDAY GAMES have been a 65-57 loss to USC
in the Classic, a 65-58 loss to Oregon State, a 48-49 loss to Washing
ton, and a 61-57 loss to USC last weekend. Friday victories have been
less than perfectly played 81-62 and 57-48 triumphs over Wyoming
and Washington.
Stanford has played spectacular ball on Saturdays. The Tribe
massacred Oregon State 96-69. beat UCLA 86-78, slaughtered Texas
(rated in the top 20) 72-46, outclassed St. Mary’s 81-72, edged tough
USF 44-43, and slopped their way past Washington 58-49, and 63-62
in overtime.
OF THE SIX REMAINING Stanford games, three are played
each night. Stanford plays Cal and UCLA in the Pavilion, and UCLA
in the Sports Arena on Friday, their bad night. Saturday the Cards
meet Cal in Berkeley, and USC twice in the Sports Arena. Thus they
meet their jinx team, USC, twice on their good night, but meet then
strongest opposition, UCLA, twice on their bad night. They face Cal
in the Pavilion on their had night, but meet them at Cal on then
good night.

isn’t laughing.
The cancellation quite possibly could cost Dose the all-time Stan
ford season scoring record set in 1953 by Rom Tomsic. Tomsio
poured 515 points through the nets as a sophomore that year to break
Hank Luisetti’s top mark of 465 points. Two years later, Tomsic
again broke Luisetti’s best with 482 points.
At present, Dose is averaging just a shade under 20 points per
game, at 19.994. If continued, this average would set a Stanford

record, but would drop Dose short
of Tomsic’s 515. When Ron made
the mark he played in 27 games.
Dose would have played 25
games, but the cancellation
makes it 24. Should Dose continue
to score at his present rate, he
would score 480 points, topping
Luisetti’s best, but a wee hit short
of Tomsic’s second best of 482,
and far back from his 515.
AS SAID before, Dose’s aver
age p.p.g. of 19.994 is the best in
Stanford history. No Card has
averaged over 20. Tomsic current
ly holds the record, 19.28, set in
1955. When Tomsic set the season
total point mark he averaged
19.01. Luisetti’s best average was
17.22.
Dose is currently 13th in the
all-time Stanford scoring totals.
With his 23 against UCLA he
moved ahead of Ed Tucker, who

totaled 791 in two years, 1951-2. Dose is in excellent position to move
up to eighth in the all-time standings, ahead of Jim Walsh, John
Arillaga, John Windsor, Bill Stephensen and George Yardley. All
those mentioned scored their totals in three years. If Dose keeps on
averaging 20, he will have 922 points for his two-year career total.
He would then need only 495 points his senior year to break Tomsic’s
career record of 1416, a mark set in four years. As it stands now,
Dose can’t miss shattering Tomsic’s career average record of 17.48.
The 6-8 center already holds most of the Stanford Frosh scoring
marks. He has a Frosh high of 38, a season total of 313, and an
average of 19.6.

A bug on statistics would notice a curious thing about the 19G2-.3
Stanford basketball season. On Saturday, the Indians are very, very
good, but Friday they are quite often just plain lousy. Three of the
five Stanford losses have been applied on Friday, the others on a
Wednesday and Thursday in the Los Angeles Classic. Overall Stan
ford is 2-4 on Friday, and 7-0 on Saturday.
AMONG THE FRIDAY GAMES have been a 65-57 loss to USC
in the Classic, a 65-58 loss to Oregon State, a 48-49 loss to Washing
ton, and a 61-57 loss to USC last weekend. Friday victories have been
less than perfectly played 81-62 and 57-48 triumphs over Wyoming
and Washington.
Stanford has played spectacular ball on Saturdays. The Tribe
massacred Oregon State 96-69. beat UCLA 86-78, slaughtered Texas
(rated in the top 20) 72-46, outclassed St. Mary’s 81-72, edged tough
USF 44-43, and slopped their way past Washington 58-49, and 63-62
in overtime.
OF THE SIX REMAINING Stanford games, three are played
each night. Stanford plays Cal and UCLA in the Pavilion, and UCLA
in the Sports Arena on Friday, their bad night. Saturday the Cards
meet Cal in Berkeley, and USC twice in the Sports Arena. Thus they
meet their jinx team, USC, twice on their good night, but meet then
strongest opposition, UCLA, twice on their bad night. They face Cal
in the Pavilion on their had night, but meet them at Cal on then
good night.

Hank Luisetti’s top mark of 465 points. Two years later, Tomsic
again broke Luisetti’s best with 482 points.
At present, Dose is averaging just a shade under 20 points per
game, at 19.994. If continued, this average would set a Stanford

record, but would drop Dose short
of Tomsic’s 515. When Ron made
the mark he played in 27 games.
Dose would have played 25
games, but the cancellation
makes it 24. Should Dose continue
to score at his present rate, he
would score 480 points, topping
Luisetti’s best, but a wee hit short
of Tomsic’s second best of 482,
and far back from his 515.
AS SAID before, Dose’s aver
age p.p.g. of 19.994 is the best in
Stanford history. No Card has
averaged over 20. Tomsic current
ly holds the record, 19.28, set in
1955. When Tomsic set the season
total point mark he averaged
19.01. Luisetti’s best average was
17.22.
Dose is currently 13th in the
all-time Stanford scoring totals.
With his 23 against UCLA he
moved ahead of Ed Tucker, who

totaled 791 in two years, 1951-2. Dose is in excellent position to move
up to eighth in the all-time standings, ahead of Jim Walsh, John
Arillaga, John Windsor, Bill Stephensen and George Yardley. All
those mentioned scored their totals in three years. If Dose keeps on
averaging 20, he will have 922 points for his two-year career total.
He would then need only 495 points his senior year to break Tomsic’s
career record of 1416, a mark set in four years. As it stands now,
Dose can’t miss shattering Tomsic’s career average record of 17.48.
The 6-8 center already holds most of the Stanford Frosh scoring
marks. He has a Frosh high of 38, a season total of 313, and an
average of 19.6.

A bug on statistics would notice a curious thing about the 19G2-.3
Stanford basketball season. On Saturday, the Indians are very, very
good, but Friday they are quite often just plain lousy. Three of the
five Stanford losses have been applied on Friday, the others on a
Wednesday and Thursday in the Los Angeles Classic. Overall Stan
ford is 2-4 on Friday, and 7-0 on Saturday.
AMONG THE FRIDAY GAMES have been a 65-57 loss to USC
in the Classic, a 65-58 loss to Oregon State, a 48-49 loss to Washing
ton, and a 61-57 loss to USC last weekend. Friday victories have been
less than perfectly played 81-62 and 57-48 triumphs over Wyoming
and Washington.
Stanford has played spectacular ball on Saturdays. The Tribe
massacred Oregon State 96-69. beat UCLA 86-78, slaughtered Texas
(rated in the top 20) 72-46, outclassed St. Mary’s 81-72, edged tough
USF 44-43, and slopped their way past Washington 58-49, and 63-62
in overtime.
OF THE SIX REMAINING Stanford games, three are played
each night. Stanford plays Cal and UCLA in the Pavilion, and UCLA
in the Sports Arena on Friday, their bad night. Saturday the Cards
meet Cal in Berkeley, and USC twice in the Sports Arena. Thus they
meet their jinx team, USC, twice on their good night, but meet then
strongest opposition, UCLA, twice on their bad night. They face Cal
in the Pavilion on their had night, but meet them at Cal on then
good night.

A week and a half ago, the Stanford-Washington State basket
ball game was cancelled because the driver of the Stanford bus
refused to try to drive over icy roads to Pullman, Washington, where
the game was scheduled to be played. Many Stanford basketball fans
thought this was hilariously funny, but Stanford center Tom Dose
isn’t laughing.
The cancellation quite possibly could cost Dose the all-time Stan
ford season scoring record set in 1953 by Rom Tomsic. Tomsio
poured 515 points through the nets as a sophomore that year to break
