# Volcanoes Subject Of Williams' Talk
## 
### 
"Volcanology.” the old es 1
branch of geology and perhaps
the least developed, was the topic
of the lecture given by Dr. How--
ell Williams last night in the
Tuesday Evening Series.

lllustrating his talk on the
types, cases and histories of vari
ous volcanoes, Professor Wil
liams used colored slides and de
tailed maps.

As an example of the Hawaiian
shield type of volcano he used
the 1959 eruption of Mauna Loa.
Reaching the height of 1190 feet
and 1190 degrees Centigrade, this
eruption started with a huge
fountain of gas, then a fluid
dome, and finally a cascade of
molten lava, sometimes moving
at the rate of 30-40 mph. From
fissures on the mountain side
came more lava which traveled
tow'ard the sea where shallow
pockets of water caused steam
explosions.
PICTURES of Mediterranean
strombolian typo volcanoes with
their rhythmic eruptions which
form cylindric cones were shown.
This type throws forth incandes
cent bombs of lava usually far
dowm the cone. Gas can escape
i more easily from strombolian
j type volcanoes.
Williams stated that volcanic
eruptions may be predicted by
detecting an increase in volcanic
earthquakes and a change in the
tilt of the earth’s surface.
“The earth seems almost to
I breathe as the lava rises and falls
beneath the surface.”
Paricutin in Mexico was dis
cussed in detail with the accom
panying pictures showing the life
history of this volcano.
WILLIAMS explained other
volcanoes in various parts of the
world such as Iceland, the Valley
of the 10,000 Smokes, the West
and East Indies, Central America,
and California.
The possible origin of Crater
Lake was extensively explored.
The presentation was supported
by facts evident in the structure
of the present crater.
Williams graduated from the
University of Liverpool, and at
tended Imperial College in Lon
don. He came to Berkeley in 1930
as a faculty member. He belongs
to the National Academy of Sci
ences, and is a silver medalist of
the Geological Society of Liver
j pool.

volcanoes in various parts of the
world such as Iceland, the Valley
of the 10,000 Smokes, the West
and East Indies, Central America,
and California.
The possible origin of Crater
Lake was extensively explored.
The presentation was supported
by facts evident in the structure
of the present crater.
Williams graduated from the
University of Liverpool, and at
tended Imperial College in Lon
don. He came to Berkeley in 1930
as a faculty member. He belongs
to the National Academy of Sci
ences, and is a silver medalist of
the Geological Society of Liver
j pool.
"Volcanology.” the old es 1
branch of geology and perhaps
the least developed, was the topic
of the lecture given by Dr. How--
ell Williams last night in the
Tuesday Evening Series.

lllustrating his talk on the
types, cases and histories of vari
ous volcanoes, Professor Wil
liams used colored slides and de
tailed maps.

As an example of the Hawaiian
shield type of volcano he used
the 1959 eruption of Mauna Loa.
Reaching the height of 1190 feet
and 1190 degrees Centigrade, this
eruption started with a huge
fountain of gas, then a fluid
dome, and finally a cascade of
molten lava, sometimes moving
at the rate of 30-40 mph. From
fissures on the mountain side
came more lava which traveled
tow'ard the sea where shallow
pockets of water caused steam
explosions.
PICTURES of Mediterranean
strombolian typo volcanoes with
their rhythmic eruptions which
form cylindric cones were shown.
This type throws forth incandes
cent bombs of lava usually far
dowm the cone. Gas can escape
i more easily from strombolian
j type volcanoes.
Williams stated that volcanic
eruptions may be predicted by
detecting an increase in volcanic
earthquakes and a change in the
tilt of the earth’s surface.
“The earth seems almost to
I breathe as the lava rises and falls
beneath the surface.”
Paricutin in Mexico was dis
cussed in detail with the accom
panying pictures showing the life
history of this volcano.
WILLIAMS explained other
volcanoes in various parts of the
world such as Iceland, the Valley
of the 10,000 Smokes, the West
and East Indies, Central America,
and California.
