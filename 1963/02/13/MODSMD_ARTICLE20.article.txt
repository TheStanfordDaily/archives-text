# Uelses Felled By Los Angeles Jinx
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (UPD—John
Uelses, first athlete to pole vault
over a 16-foot-high bar, said yes
terday he has been grounded
again by a “Los Angeles jinx’’ in
jury. An ankle sprain suffered
when his pole snapped in two at
the Los Angeles track meet; last
Saturday night will prevent his
practicing for two weeks and may
sideline him for the remainder
of the indoor season.
The last time Uelses was in
Los Angeles, he suffered an al
most identical injury. That mis
hap at an outdoor meet last
May put him out of competition
for nine weeks. He was trying
for 15 feet, 8 inches when his
glass pole snapped as he was
about two feet off the ground. He
somersaulted in the air so that he
would land in the pit but his left
leg went into the bags surround
ing it and his foot was twisted.
