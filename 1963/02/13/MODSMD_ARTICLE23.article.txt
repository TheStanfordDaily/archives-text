# Gymnasts Seek Win Over USF
## 
### DAVE NYERG 
Stanford gymnasts have a
chance to even their dual meet
record at 1-1 tonight at San Fran
cisco State. Although SFS beat
the Indians last year, coach Wes
ley Ruff indicated that his team
is the likely victor in tonight’s
meet due to a much improved
Farm team, and a deletion of
talent at the host school.
Roger Rhoads, competitor in
four or five events, missed a
workout this week in an effort
to overcome a case of strep
throat, and Bill Rusher is still
somewhat hampered from a neck
injury suffered in a fall from the
still rings about a month ago.
Both will compete, however,
along with an otherwise healthy
team.
San Francisco State’s strength
last year was concentrated in the
still rings, tumbling and free ex
ercise. Russ Burmister should
equal if not overcome the chal
lenge in still rings while Marc
Weissbluth and Rhoads represent
Stanford’s prowess in the ground
events.
