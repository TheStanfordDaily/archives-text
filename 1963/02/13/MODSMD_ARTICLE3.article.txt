In conjunction with the Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow Busi
ness School program for under
graduates to be held this after
noon at 4:30 in Room 270 of Tre
sidder, The Daily yesterday inter
viewed Samuel A. Pond, Associ
ate Doan of the Graduate School
of Business, about the role of
ethics in business.

“In the final analysis most of
the important decisions made in
the field of business are ethical
ones,” said Pond. He went on to
say that although the problems
of economics and statistics are
considered first, the decision in
the end is one of ethics.
THE STANFORD Business
School, according to Pond, does
not teach any courses in business
ethics, as some schools do, be-

cause they tend toward preaching
and because, in a sense, every
course given by Stanford’s Busi
ness School is concerned in some
way with ethics in the field of
business.
Pond went on to say that the
image which (he public has had
of the business professlofl as un
ethical is a “false” one which is
detrimental to the power of Busi
ness Schools in attracting quali
fied students.

He cited the professions of
teaching, medicine and the clergy
as having the reputation of being
the “highest form of activity,”
whereas the field of business is
thought of in terms of such
things as the price fixing suits
against Westinghouse and Gen
eral Electric in 1961.
POND SAID he felt that this is
the primary reason w'hy business
schools are not getting the most
qualified students among those
who have had liberal arts and
the humanities as their under
graduate majors.
"Making money is an essential
but not the essential of any busi
ness,” ho added.
Responsibility to the public, the
personnel of a company, and the
stockholders are the more impor
tant considerations, he said. A
good business man and a well or
ganized business firm can lead a
very rewarding life by doing their
utmost to serve the needs and de
mands of the consumers.
SINCE BUSINESS is the pri
mary source of fulfilling these
demands, Pond added, there is a
great challenge for an ethical per
son in the field of business.
Pond stressed that one should
choose his field by deciding where
ids true abilities lie, and should
not turn away from any profes
sion because it is considered by
some as unethical, since all fields
have their ethical and unethical
parts.
He added that Business Schools
would be getting an oven bettor
group of students if students re
alized that “the major decisions
in business are ethical ones.”

cause they tend toward preaching
and because, in a sense, every
course given by Stanford’s Busi
ness School is concerned in some
way with ethics in the field of
business.
Pond went on to say that the
image which (he public has had
of the business professlofl as un
ethical is a “false” one which is
detrimental to the power of Busi
ness Schools in attracting quali
fied students.

He cited the professions of
teaching, medicine and the clergy
as having the reputation of being
the “highest form of activity,”
whereas the field of business is
thought of in terms of such
things as the price fixing suits
against Westinghouse and Gen
eral Electric in 1961.
POND SAID he felt that this is
the primary reason w'hy business
schools are not getting the most
qualified students among those
who have had liberal arts and
the humanities as their under
graduate majors.
"Making money is an essential
but not the essential of any busi
ness,” ho added.
Responsibility to the public, the
personnel of a company, and the
stockholders are the more impor
tant considerations, he said. A
good business man and a well or
ganized business firm can lead a
very rewarding life by doing their
utmost to serve the needs and de
mands of the consumers.
SINCE BUSINESS is the pri
mary source of fulfilling these
demands, Pond added, there is a
great challenge for an ethical per
son in the field of business.
Pond stressed that one should
choose his field by deciding where
ids true abilities lie, and should
not turn away from any profes
sion because it is considered by
some as unethical, since all fields
have their ethical and unethical
parts.
He added that Business Schools
would be getting an oven bettor
group of students if students re
alized that “the major decisions
in business are ethical ones.”
In conjunction with the Stan
ford Today and Tomorrow Busi
ness School program for under
graduates to be held this after
noon at 4:30 in Room 270 of Tre
sidder, The Daily yesterday inter
viewed Samuel A. Pond, Associ
ate Doan of the Graduate School
of Business, about the role of
ethics in business.

“In the final analysis most of
the important decisions made in
the field of business are ethical
ones,” said Pond. He went on to
say that although the problems
of economics and statistics are
considered first, the decision in
the end is one of ethics.
