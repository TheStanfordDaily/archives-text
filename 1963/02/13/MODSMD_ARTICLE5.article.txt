## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Draw ing a distinction betwe
doin of acting in a particular in
Legislature, meeting informally
by ASSU president Annin Rosei
supported the right of students
out collectively on issues outside*
the Campus.

Furthermore, the committee
fell that the now Legislature, aft
er considering the various rea
sons for exercising discretion in
the use of the right to speak out,
could speak out. It was suggest
ed that the extent to which future
legislatures would choose to in
volve themselves in issues out
side the campus would depend
upon the character of the legis
lature and the disposition of the
student body.
It was further suggested that
the extent to which a legislature
should involve itself in off-cam
pus issues should be determined
by student referendum. In re
gard to this suggestion, Jim
Woolsey, assistant to the ASSU
president, pointed out that white
such a limit could be it
would be too vague to serve its
purpose.

Bud VVcdin, chairman of
LASSU’s By-law Committee,
pointed out that the tenor of the
student body changes from year
to year and the effect of this
tenor on the election of legisla-

en the right to act and the wis
istance, the members of the new
as an ad hoc committee formed
icranz, yesterday overwhelmingly
at Stanford University to speak

ture members would serve as an
appropriate and effective guide
for legislature’s involvement in
off campus issues.
Regarding the new Constitu
tion, a question was raised as to
why it had not yet been approved
by President Sterling and the
Board of Trustees. ASSU presi
dent Rosencranz stated that the
trustees meet only once a month
and have not yet considered the
matter fully.
ROAN C’ONRAI), referring to
an interview with Dean Winbig
lor, stated that under the old
constitution the Legislature is
given the responsibility of ap
proving student groups which de
sire to organize on campus. Un
der the new constitution the Leg
islature relinquishes this respon
sibility, requiring only that
groups register with the ASSU
before forming. The University,
said Conrad, is concerned because
if groups are allowed to form on
campus by merely registering,
these groups could make state
ments which could be identified
with the University.
Rosencranz said that the pas
sage of the new constitution in
dicates the unwillingness of the
student body to engage in the
prior censorship of groups.

legislatures would choose to in

It was further suggested that
the extent to which a legislature
should involve itself in off-cam

by student referendum. In re

Woolsey, assistant to the ASSU
president, pointed out that white

Regarding the new Constitu

why it had not yet been approved
by President Sterling and the
Board of Trustees. ASSU presi

trustees meet only once a month
and have not yet considered the

ROAN C’ONRAI), referring to
an interview with Dean Winbig
lor, stated that under the old
constitution the Legislature is
given the responsibility of ap
proving student groups which de
sire to organize on campus. Un

islature relinquishes this respon
sibility, requiring only that
groups register with the ASSU
before forming. The University,
said Conrad, is concerned because
if groups are allowed to form on
campus by merely registering,
these groups could make state
ments which could be identified
with the University.
Rosencranz said that the pas
sage of the new constitution in
dicates the unwillingness of the
student body to engage in the
prior censorship of groups.
