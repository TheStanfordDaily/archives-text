# Future Venezuelan President Wrote for Hispanic Report
## 
### WILLIAM MOORE 
(Last of a Two-Part Series)
“He was an ordinary, nice per
son—and. most important for
around here, he worked hard.”
That’s how Ronald Hilton, di
rector of the Institute of Hispanic
American and Luso-Brazilian
Studies, described the Venezuelan
exile who came to work as a con
tributor at Bolivar House for five
months in 1957.
So what's unusual about that?
Nothing except the man’s name
was Romulo Betancourt. And in
1958 he was elected president of
Venezuela.
“AROUND HERE, though, we
really don’t care who you are,”
explained Charles Gaukl, a senior
contributor on the center’s
monthly Hispanic American Re
port. “What counts is that you
meet the rigorous challenge of
keeping up the very high stan
dards of the Report. Anyone who
works here tor a length of lime
especially those who get degrees
here- are of proven ability.”
Betancourt was one example.
But there are many more at Boil
var House. Most of the Report’s
16 contributors are graduate stu
dents, although there are a fevy
undergraduates.
Each contributor spends from
20 to 30 hours a week culling in
formation from the voluminous
amount of printed matter that
pours into Bolivar House. Almost
all the contributors speak Span
ish or Portuguese, and many have

I traveled in Latin America during
their vacations.
EVERY LATIN American coun
try is given a section in the Re
! port. Cuba and Brazil usually re
j ceive the most extensive cover
age (ranging from about four to
six pages each). But even the
most uneventful countries are al
lotted at least a page.
There’s also coverage on Spain
and Portugal. And at the back of
the journal there’s a book review'
section.
“The . . . contributors w'ork in
small groups, each one being re
sponsible for a country or group
of countries,” Hilton pointed out.
It is the contributors’ job, ho
added, to thoroughly examine and
evaluate - via any available nows
sources the political, social and
economic events taking place
within their respective countries.
IN' ADDITION to having a gen
eral conference room with basic
library references, Bolivar House
is divided into offices for the
main areas in Latin America.
There is also a recently-purchased
overflow' building next door
which houses the Institute’s ar
chives and the Spanish and Por
tuguese section offices.
But the growth won’t stop here.
I In Hilton's words: “My main aim
in life is to set up the Institute
on a broader base with perhaps
a permanent, small faculty.”
And. he noted, that "broad
base” might also include a branch
or two in Latin America.
