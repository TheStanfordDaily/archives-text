Ah so, ’tis St, Valentine's
Day, when thoughts of
male and miss turn to
things romantic—a small
remembrance perhaps?
Nothing too ostentatious,
mind you, just something
to express one's subtle
regards on this special
day. What to give, ah
what? There are inspira
tions aplenty at knowing
old Roos/Atkins, items
sure to please both guys
and dolls, at practically
any stipend you can
manage. But remember,
whatever it happens to
be, the R A gift package
states your good taste.
Today at R A.
