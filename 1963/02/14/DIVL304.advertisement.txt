If so, Miss Afflerbach will send you
your I
] label
THIS is a two-color striped button-down shirt designed and tailored
by Eagle Shirtmakers and sold everywhere by fine men’s stores.
Many of them admire our shirts so much they sell them under their
own names. High praise indeed, and we should like to reciprocate by
advertising their (our) shirts. But it’s hard to know just where to start.
Obviously we can’t say things like “None Genuine Without This Label”
when they are all quite genuine, you know. And it would be silly to say
“Try An Eagle Shirt Today!” when it is likely you already have a draw
erful; even though you didn’t know it until just this minute. So all we
can suggest is that you send in for your Eagle label. Write Eagle
Shirtmakers, Quakertown, Pennsylvania; Attention Miss Afflerbach.
