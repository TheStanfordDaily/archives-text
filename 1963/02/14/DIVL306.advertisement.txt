THE CURSE OF THE CAMPUS; NO. 2
As was pointed out last week, one would think that with all
the progress we have made in the education game, something
might have been done by now about roommates. But no. The
roommate picture has not brightened one bit since Ethan
(loud pimple founded the first American college.
(Contrary to popular belief, Harvard was not the first. Mr.
Ooodpimple started his institution some 7o years earlier. And
quite an institution it was, let me tell you! Mr. Ooodpimple
built schools of liberal arts, fine arts, dentistry, and tanning.
He built a lacrosse stadium that seated 102,000. Everywhere
on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin motto CAVE
M USfil— “Watch out for moose.” The student union contained
a bowling alley, a clock, and a 10-chair barber shop.

(It was this last feature—the barber shop—that, alas,
brought Mr. (ioodpimple’s college to an early end. The student
body, being drawn from the nearby countryside, was composed
chiefly of Pequots and Iroquois who, alas, had no need of a
barber shop. They braid their hair instead of cutting it, and as
for shaving, they don’t. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle by name,
grew so depressed staring all the time at 1(5 empty chairs that
one day his mind finally gave way. Seizing his vibrator, he ran
outside and shook the entire campus till it crumbled to dust.
This later became known as Pickett’s Charge.)
But 1 digress. We were discussing ways for you and your
roommate to stop hating each other. This is admittedly diffi
cult but not impossible if you will both bend a bit, give a little.
I remember, for example, my own college days (Berlitz, ’08).
My roommate was, I think you will allow, even less agreeable
than most. He was a Tibetan named Ringading whose native
customs, while indisputably colorful, were not entirely endear
ing. Mark you, I didn’t mind so much the gong he struck on
the hour or the string of firecrackers he set off on the half-hour.
I didn’t even mind his singeing chicken feathers every dusk and
daybreak. What I did mind was that he singed them in my hat.
To be fair, he was not totally taken with some of my habits
either—especially my hobby of collecting water. I had no jars
at the time and just had to stack the water any-old-where.
Well sir, things grew steadily cooler between Ringading and
me, and they might have gotten actually ugly had we not each
happened to receive a package from home one day. Ringading
opened his package, paused, smiled shyly at me, and offered
me a gift.
“Thank you,” I said, “What is it?”
“Yak butter,” he said. “You put it in your hair. In Tibetan
we call it grce see kidstuff.”
“Well now, that’s mighty friendly,” I said and offered him a
gilt from my package. “Now you must have one of mine.”
“Thank you,” he said. “What is this called?”
“Marlboro Cigarettes,” I said and held a match for him.
He puffed. “Wow!” he said. “This sure beats chicken feathers!”
“Or anything else you could name,” I said, lighting my own
Marlboro.
And as we sat together and enjoyed that fine flavorful
Marlboro tobacco, that pure white Marlboro filter, a glow of
good fellowship came over us—a serene conviction that no
quarrels exist between men that will not yield to the warmth of
honest good will. I am proud to say that Ringading and I re
main friends to this day, and we exchange cards each Christmas
and each Fourth of July, firecrackers. sum

happened to receive a package from home one day. Ringading
opened his package, paused, smiled shyly at me, and offered
me a gift.
“Thank you,” I said, “What is it?”
“Yak butter,” he said. “You put it in your hair. In Tibetan
we call it grce see kidstuff.”
“Well now, that’s mighty friendly,” I said and offered him a
gilt from my package. “Now you must have one of mine.”
“Thank you,” he said. “What is this called?”
“Marlboro Cigarettes,” I said and held a match for him.
He puffed. “Wow!” he said. “This sure beats chicken feathers!”
“Or anything else you could name,” I said, lighting my own
Marlboro.
And as we sat together and enjoyed that fine flavorful
Marlboro tobacco, that pure white Marlboro filter, a glow of
good fellowship came over us—a serene conviction that no

THE CURSE OF THE CAMPUS; NO. 2
As was pointed out last week, one would think that with all
the progress we have made in the education game, something
might have been done by now about roommates. But no. The
roommate picture has not brightened one bit since Ethan
(loud pimple founded the first American college.
(Contrary to popular belief, Harvard was not the first. Mr.
Ooodpimple started his institution some 7o years earlier. And
quite an institution it was, let me tell you! Mr. Ooodpimple
built schools of liberal arts, fine arts, dentistry, and tanning.
He built a lacrosse stadium that seated 102,000. Everywhere
on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin motto CAVE
M USfil— “Watch out for moose.” The student union contained
a bowling alley, a clock, and a 10-chair barber shop.

brought Mr. (ioodpimple’s college to an early end. The student
body, being drawn from the nearby countryside, was composed
chiefly of Pequots and Iroquois who, alas, had no need of a
barber shop. They braid their hair instead of cutting it, and as
for shaving, they don’t. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle by name,
grew so depressed staring all the time at 1(5 empty chairs that
one day his mind finally gave way. Seizing his vibrator, he ran

My roommate was, I think you will allow, even less agreeable
than most. He was a Tibetan named Ringading whose native
customs, while indisputably colorful, were not entirely endear
ing. Mark you, I didn’t mind so much the gong he struck on
the hour or the string of firecrackers he set off on the half-hour.
I didn’t even mind his singeing chicken feathers every dusk and
daybreak. What I did mind was that he singed them in my hat.
To be fair, he was not totally taken with some of my habits

body, being drawn from the nearby countryside, was composed
chiefly of Pequots and Iroquois who, alas, had no need of a
barber shop. They braid their hair instead of cutting it, and as
for shaving, they don’t. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle by name,
grew so depressed staring all the time at 1(5 empty chairs that
one day his mind finally gave way. Seizing his vibrator, he ran
outside and shook the entire campus till it crumbled to dust.
This later became known as Pickett’s Charge.)
But 1 digress. We were discussing ways for you and your
roommate to stop hating each other. This is admittedly diffi
cult but not impossible if you will both bend a bit, give a little.
I remember, for example, my own college days (Berlitz, ’08).
My roommate was, I think you will allow, even less agreeable
than most. He was a Tibetan named Ringading whose native
customs, while indisputably colorful, were not entirely endear
ing. Mark you, I didn’t mind so much the gong he struck on
the hour or the string of firecrackers he set off on the half-hour.
I didn’t even mind his singeing chicken feathers every dusk and
daybreak. What I did mind was that he singed them in my hat.
To be fair, he was not totally taken with some of my habits
either—especially my hobby of collecting water. I had no jars
at the time and just had to stack the water any-old-where.
Well sir, things grew steadily cooler between Ringading and
me, and they might have gotten actually ugly had we not each
happened to receive a package from home one day. Ringading
opened his package, paused, smiled shyly at me, and offered
me a gift.
“Thank you,” I said, “What is it?”
“Yak butter,” he said. “You put it in your hair. In Tibetan
we call it grce see kidstuff.”
“Well now, that’s mighty friendly,” I said and offered him a
gilt from my package. “Now you must have one of mine.”
“Thank you,” he said. “What is this called?”
“Marlboro Cigarettes,” I said and held a match for him.
He puffed. “Wow!” he said. “This sure beats chicken feathers!”
“Or anything else you could name,” I said, lighting my own
Marlboro.
And as we sat together and enjoyed that fine flavorful
Marlboro tobacco, that pure white Marlboro filter, a glow of
good fellowship came over us—a serene conviction that no
quarrels exist between men that will not yield to the warmth of
honest good will. I am proud to say that Ringading and I re
main friends to this day, and we exchange cards each Christmas
and each Fourth of July, firecrackers. sum
