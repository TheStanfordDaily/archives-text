# Hastorf Gives Differing Views About Freedom

### MIKE SAKS 
Thro? psychological ways of
looking at freedom and the con
flit ions under which a person
feels free wore the topics covered
by Professor Hastorf at the Tre
sidder Freedom Series last night.
He explained the subject “is a
tangled web,’’ and acknowledged
the dangers of oversimplification.
Hastorf listed three psycholo
gical ways of looking at freedom:
psychoanalytic, behavioristic, and
existentional thinking.
To illustrate different ways of
looking at the same thing, Has
torf asked Aristotle and Galileo
the same question, “Why does the
rock fall?” Aristotle would say
it falls because it is heavy; that
some quality exists within the
rock.

Galileo would say that the rock
falls because of the force of grav
ity upon it; an external force.
Aristotle’s answer is typical of
the psychoanalytical approach to
human behavior in which the
forces acting upon the individual
come from within. Galileo’s reply
is that of the behaviorists who
see all forces as external.
Hastorf explained that, for a
long time, it was thought that
freedom and determinism could
exist at the same lime. Behavior
was thought of as a being deter
mined by a combination of exter
nal and internal stimuli—then
along came Freud.
Freud said that the behavior
that appears to grow out of the
self is an illusion. Unconscious
forces are internalized and con
trol us.
On the question of freedom,
Hastorf concluded that both the
behaviorists and analysts agree
on one thing: we feel a lack of
freedom when the forces con
trolling us are unpleasant or
aversive. Whereas positive stimu
li make a person feel free, nega
tive controls lead to a feeling of
being controlled by environment.
As for existentialism, Hastorf
sees it as invoking a new force
besides those of sex and sadism,
a need for the individual to self
actualize himself.
