## The 						Mess With Canada' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The critical mistake in our affair with Canada was to make
any public statement about the negotiations between the two
governments. However provoking Mr. Diefenbaker’s disclosures
about confidential matters, this was a time when a wise govern
ment would have remained silent. It would have been well to
remember that it is not necessary to win every argument, and
whoever made the final decision in Washington should have
known that this controversy was one which should resolutely
have been handled by quiet diplomacy. He should have realized
that this was an especially bad moment to engage in a public
controversy.
Our dealings with the Canadian government have no doubt
been complicated. But the crucial issue is the same one which
has disrupted our relations with France and shaken the whole
Western Alliance, and has alienated us from General De Gaulle.
It is now to reconcile the American nuclear monopoly with the
sovereign independence of our closest allies. It was a thoughtless
decision to embroil us with Ottawa in a relatively minor aspect
of the great issue which is posed from Paris. General De Gaulle
was quite sufficient. We did not have to take on Mr. Diefenbaker
as well.
What went wrong in Washington was that the final decision
to scold the Canadian government was not seen in the context
of our foreign policy as a whole. Who does see our foreign policy
as a whole in all its ramifications? This deplorable and annoyed
episode has raised again the question of how to organize the con
trol of foreign policy.
The question cannot be answered by saying that X rather
than Y should be Secretary of State. The heart of the problem
is that, in the post-war era, so many departments of the govern
ment are involved in foreign policy that no Secretary of State
can direct all of it.
In principle, only the Chief Executive can conduct a foreign
policy which is in fact formulated and administered by State,
Defense, Treasury and Intelligence. But in practice, no President
can do it because the decision is so complicated and he has so many
other things to do. What has in fact developed is the conduct of
our foreign policy by committees of which the President is the
chairman, and on big questions the final arbiter. This committee
system fills what would otherwise be a vacuum. Without it, there
would in practice be on way to make the decisions by which the
great chiefs of the government departments work out a con
sensus.
We must ask ourselves what system would work better. An
omniscient Secretary of State advising the President? The fact
is that there can be no Secretary of State who is omniscient
enough. For this country is involved deeply in all five continents,
and inescapably, whatever the formal titles, there will in practice
be several several Secretaries of State. We are not alone in this.
In Great Britain, Lord Home is the Foreign Secretary and Mr.
Heath handles relations with Europe.
My own impression of the committee system today is that
the level of intelligence among the principal figures is high. But
it has its defects, and they have become vividly manifest in the
aftermath of the Gaullist explosion. Like all committees, whether
they run a government or a newspaper, they tend to favor a
consensus over creation. What is most obviously needed in
Washington at this moment is original thinking. General De
Gaulle has shattered the post-war structure of United States’
foreign policy, and we are launched on seas for which the old
charts do not show us the way.
It is easier, I know, for an outsider to say it than for the
President to do it. But what is needed is an infusion of fresh and
unfrightened minds, not to replace the men who are there but to
refresh them.
