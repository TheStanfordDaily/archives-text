## Realistic Approach to EEC Crisis 
### BERNARD GIRIN ASSU Scholar from France 
Much has already been written with 100 much passion about
Do Gaulle’s attitude towards Great Britain and the United
States. Even for the one who does not agree with the French
Grand Design, it is impossible, in my opinion, to hold a one-sided
view. One must distinguish the effects on European unity, on
one hand, and the effects on the relations with the United States,
on the other hand.
Obviously the unilateral decision of France about Great
Britain’s bid is very detrimental to the Community, more be
cause of the way the decision was taken than because of the
decision itself. Certainly in that case De Gaulle has chosen to be
brutal to dramatize the dispute and to make people think about
his “revindication” of “Europe for the Europeans.” But he has
taken a great risk; the other European countries now are afraid
of the French imperialism and the possible French leadership in
Europe.
The fact is that the veto of Great Britain was mainly di
rected towards the United Slates and De Gaulle’s hope is to get
a recognition by the Americans of the desire of independence
of Europe, and this has been judged more important than the
reactions of the five of the E.E.C.
Two conclusions are obvious:
1) As long as United Europe will he the “Europe of Govern
ments” and not the Europe of peoples, the governments will
continue to care for (he national interests and not for the Com
munity’s interests. Mr. Macmillan was a defender of British
interests, more intelligent than some of his anti-European op
ponents, but he acted for British interests: De Gaulle acts for
French interests and his nationalism is no more narrow-minded
than the nationalism of Dr. Erhard for instance, who wants an
“open Europe’’ because it is better for German economic inter
ests. So it is more obvious than ever that the only road to the
poliical unity of Europe is the supernationality, the building of
a strong common executive, as pointed out by Miss Renata
Kiefer.
2) The second conclusion is. in my opinion, that a little
revision is necessary in the American Foreign Policy towards
Europe. More and more Europe will ask for cooperation be
tween equals and will be reluctant to accept the status of a
satellite of the United States. And if it is not De Gaulle, an
other will ask it. because Europe has a peculiar role to play,
and it will not always coincide with American interests and
goals. The main reproach we can make to De Gaulle is that he
opposed the political integi%tion of Europe (this was a point
where he agreed with Great Britain, which also did not want
to be a member of a European Federation).
Perhaps this spectacular will have the effect of bringing
about a change in American-European relations. A risk has been
taken, and I am opposed to the brutality of the decision. But we
can only hope that the traditional friendship will not be affected.
