After seven days in Rome and having gathered everywhere
from ancient burial catacombs to their hotel run for pilgrims
by the Palottine monks, the 80 students and two faculty couples
of Stanford-in-France Group V left the banks of the Tibre to
return to the French campus on the banks of the Loire.
The Rome excursion, a masterpiece of administrative talent,
is one of two major organized field trips offered to each group
at the Stanford overseas campuses. At a cost of $32 per student,
all transportation, meals, lodging, tours, and admission into mu
seums was taken care of.
Two sightseeing busses, equipped with sound systems with
two young ecclesiastics at the microphone, chauffered the Stan
ford students through five tours. The young priest/guides’ love
of the eternal city and knowledge of its history carried through
to the students as they visited the Vatican, Renaissance and
Baroque Rome, the Forum and the Palatine, and the catacombs.
The average tour lasted three and a half hours, leaving the
students with either a morning or an afternoon free each day.
along with one completely free day and all nights.
In addition to the tours, the Stanford-in-France group was
given an audience with Pope John XXIII, amid the shouts and
cheers of the crowds gathered in the reception room of St.
Peter’s.
As the students stood on the steps where Brutus killed
Caesar, the spot where Marc Antony said “Brutus was an honor
able man,” and saw the many sculptures they pored over for
Western Civ exams as frosh, the meaning and intent of Stanford
University in placing them in the middle of Europe, at the cost
of untold extra problems and administrative detail, came
through to the collective sense of the group more strongly than
at any other time. The guides provided by the University were
academicions; the brief voyage was, for the students, an aca
demic experience.
The students arrived in Rome on a Sunday afternoon and
were free to wander through the qarrbyv streets late into the
evening—the streets always crowded with American-loving Itali
ans, dimly lit portraits of (he Madonna and Child, and pillars and
facades everywhere to keep alive the memory of the city that
was the fount of Western Civilization.
After having been introduced to true Italian spaghetti and
white wine at their lodging, Casa Palotti, the students left their
rooms that overlooked the gentle Tibre River and begain their
first tour. Every few moments the bus stopped and in small
groups the students descended upon the monuments of their
heritage. As the students saw the Pantheon, some of which dates
back to 27 centuries before Christ, they learned that it was dedi
cated to all the Saints in the 9th century. As it was All Saints
Day, the Stanfordites joined the Pantheon in celebrating an an
niversary of antiquity.
The two huge chartered coaches wound their way through
narrow streets that were designed for chariots. From Via Del
Corso, one of the central arteries of Rome, the group stopped at
the Fountain of Trevi which, tradition has it, assures a return to
Rome to him who throws a coin in it.
The Stanford busses passed the huge. Renaissance-style
American Embassy located near a portion of the ancient wall
that surrounded Rome, and went on to the Palace of the Medici’s
which now forms part of the French National Academy. The
groups hopped out of the busses and descended the famous
Spanish steps, one of the most elaborate stairs in the world,
noted for the intricate floral decoration that are given at Epiph
any each year.
A professor at the French institute in Rome guided the stu
dents through the Vatican museum, providing a running com
mentary on the history of Frescoes that its walls contain, being
especially rich in the works of Raphael.
A highlight of the Rome trip was the extended visit to the
Sistine Chapel, the ceiling of which contains a major portion of
Michelangelo’s best known frescoes, highlighted by the classic
touching of fingers of God giving life to Adam. Michelangelo
was commissioned to paint the ceiling in 1508; Pope Sixtus IV
asked his favorite, Roselli, to portray the last supper in the
chapel, a mosaic reproduction of which is found at Stanford
University’s Memorial Church.
An intensive, academically-approached tour of ancient and
modern Rome left the students pursuing conversations on the
24-hour train trip home to Tours that were a mixture of a sense
of living ancient history and the responsibilities to history of the
modern world. Perhaps one of the most typical of the group’s
remembrances of their brief voyage into two worlds was the
message of Pope John during the Stanford audience with him.
As the Catholic leader was carried to the altar of St. Peter’s in
a centuries-old manner, he spoke to a group alert to the problems
of a world at the mercy of nuclear arms.
