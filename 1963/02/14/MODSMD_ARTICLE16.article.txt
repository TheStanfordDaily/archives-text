# CAMPUS OPINION
## India Has No Solid Claim to Disputed Territory 
### GEORGE GUY 
The very nature of a dispute
implies either conflicting data or
different interpretations of data,
or a mixture of both. The Sino-
Indian border dispute is no ex
ception. Thus far nationalism and
emotionalism have entered in
evitably into the picture, further
complicated by the cross currents
of cold war illogicality and the
complex of power relations in
South Asia.
In older to analyze the dispute
in outline form, I propose to view
the question under three differ
ent aspects: (a) the status of the
frontier demarcation; (b) the
crossing of swords; and (c) the
political implications.
Two separate sector boundaries
are in dispute between the gov
ernments of China and India. In
the west the frontier between the
Indian state of Jammu and Kash
mir and the Chinese provinces of
Sinkiang and Tibet; and in the
eastern sector, the frontier be
tween the Indian Northeast Fron
tier Agency annd the Chinese
provinces of Tibet and Sinkiang
are in dispute.
AS LATE AS 1950 the official
Indian government agency Sur
vey of India published a definitive
map entitled “India Showing Po
litical Divisions in the New Re
public” in which the entire bor
der of Jammu facing China was
marked “boundary undefined.”
Four years later the same agency
published the “Political Map of
India” in which the border was
precisely drawn.
This latter alignment defines
the present Indian government
claims. But what remains unclear
is how it was possible for an un
defined boundary of 1950 to be
come the definitive border of
1954. What is beyond dispute is
that between these intervening
years there was no joint govern
mental delineation of the border,
no treaty signed between the gov
ernments of India and China.
In fact it was not until 1958
that an Indian reconnaissance
party was sent to the area.
(Prime Minister Nehru, state
ment in the Lok Sabha, August
28. 1959). This reconnaisance
party found itself in the hands of
Chinese border guards. Speaking
on Feb, 23, 1961, Nehru stated in
the Lok Sabha that as late as
1957 he did not know whether
Chinese border guards had vio
lated Indian territory.
IT THUS remains an open
question how the 1954 Survey of

India map could have been so
definitive in the delineation of
the border, and how valid such a
delineation could become the ba
sis of subsequent Indian govern
ment claims.
In the eastern sector, the bor
der claimed by the Indian govern
ment is even less clear. Currently
the Indian government claims
that the watershed line of the
eastern Himalayan range is the
"natural line,” and alternatively,
“roughly the MacMahon line.”
On the first definition, it is all
but impossible to be precise, since
the major rivers which flow
through the eastern Himalayan
range break through the moun
tain chain in a north-south direc
tion, thus the watershed runs
north-south along a frontier
which runs east to west.
It is difficult to imagine how
watershed lines which are per
pendicular to the frontier could
be used to delineate the frontier.
ALTERNATIVELY, the Mac-
Mahon line has never been ac
cepted by the Chinese govern
ment, not in 1914 nor at any later
date. In fact, of the three partici
pants at the convention only the
British delegation had no reserva
tions. The third party, represent
ing the Lama of Lhasa, made it
explicitly clear that his govern
ment did not consider the conven
tion satisfactory from its point
of view. (Cf. “The Boundary
Question Between China and Ti
bet,” p. 145 et sqq.)
Thus of the three parties to the
Simla convention one party. Chi
na, rejected the convention out
right; the second party, the Lon
chen (representing Lhasa), stipu
lated the disatisfaction of his gov
ernment to the convention; and
only the British delegate accept
ed the convention in full.
Just how valid such an arrange
ment is remains an open question.
A further question, of course, is
the validity of the present Indian
government’s assumption of the
situation created by the near-uni
lateral efforts of the British
government. The confused state
of the border of the eastern sec
tor is reflected in unbiased schol
arly sources. The 1929 edition of
the “Encyclopedia Britannica did
not use the MacMahon line as the
boundary in this sector, but in
stead retained the older bounda
ry. which is the current border
claimed by both Chinese govern
ments. The “Oxford Advanced
Atlas” (1950 edition) also used
the border claimed by the Chinese

government.
SUCH THEN, in brief, is the
status of the frontier demarca
tion of the two disputed sectors.
(B). In October of last year the
unsettled state of the border be
came even more unsettled with
the crossing of swords between
Chinese and Indian armed troops.
On Oct. 12 Nehru gave orders
that the Chinese border posts be
evicted from what was claimed
as Indian territory. These clear
cut directives were the immedi
ate result of the first serious in
cident, which took place in the
eastern sector, near Dhola post
(Leh) on Sept. 20.

Dhola is situated on latitude
27 degrees 46.5’ north. Based on
the original 1914 Simla conven
tion map (which the Indian gov
ernment accepts, but which both
Chinese governments do not), the
MacMahon line lies at latitude 27
degrees 44.5’ north, i.e., to the
south of Dhola; i.e., the fighting
took place beyond the Indian
claim. This fact w’as mentioned
in no western paper except in
“The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962.
WHAT FOLLOWED after Neh
ru’s Oct. 12 order is now
hashed history. Diplomatic ulti
matums flew in both directions,
followed by large-scale military
operations along both sectors, in
Jammu in the west as well as in
the eastern Himalayas. A last
chance at avoiding the conflict of
last October came just prior to
the Chinese initiation of counter
attack maneuvers.
In the Oct. 14 editorial of the
Peking “Jenmin Jih Pao,” condi
tions for a last-ditch effort at
peaceful settlement were pro
posed, which consisted of both
sides pulling back 12 miles from
the positions in which opposing
forces were facing each other.
This was essentially the same
proposal voiced by the Chinese
government three years earlier,
on Nov. 7, 1959, following the oc
currence of minor border clashes.
At that date the Chinese pro
posed that both sides withdraw
their forces 12 miles from where
they were positioned, and that the
border question be settled
through negotiations. The Indian
government turned down the
1959 proposal, as it also did the
Oct. 14, 1962, proposal.
NEHRU’S ORDERS of Oct. 12
were not impulsive gestures, for
already an Indian army corps of
at least 50,000 men was deployed
in the eastern sector under the
experienced General B. M. Kaul.
("The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962,
and "New York Times,” Oct. 6).
At the same time, on the Chinese
side of the border, extensive mili
tary preparations must have
taken place, in view of the subse
quent heavy involvement of
troops.
The military campaign conduct
ed along the world's most for
midable mountain ranges ended
with Chinese forces capturing
practically all the territory
claimed by China, on both the
western and the eastern sectors.
When the swords wore uncrossed,
the Chinese government with
drew its troops in the eastern sec
tor to a line roughly along the po
sitions prior to the campaign. On
the western sector Chinese forces
withdrew some 12 miles from
their line of furthest advance.
Prior to the withdrawals the
Chinese government announced
that negotiations should bo con
ducted either in New Delhi or in
Peking. Once again the Indian
government, in the face of strong
nationalistic sentiments, respond
ed negatively to the proposal.
Subsequently, after tempers cool
ed a few degrees, Prime Minister
Nehru suggested that India might

be willing to place the border dis
pute in the hands of an interna
tional court. The Chinese, how
ever, showed more respect to the
mediation efforts of a group of
neutral Afro-Asian states.

(C). VARIOUS and divergent
political currents have developed
as a result of the Sino-Indian bor
der dispute. The government of
Pakistan feared that the western
arms given to India might be
used against her. The Nationalist
government of China protested
the support of the U.S. for In
dian boundary claims, thus sup
porting Communist China’s
claims.

Internal Indian politics under
went radical splits and realign
ments. The complex of Southeast
Asian power relations became
further entangled. All these po
litical implications cannot be
dealt with in detail here.
The facts of the case would
seem to indicate that enither side
has clear-cut proof of their sov
ereignty over the disputed areas.
In light of this, the simplistic talk
of Chinese aggression and the cry
of invasion is somewhat question
able.

At the present writing, the Si
no-Indian dispute seems to be
heading toward the direction of
the conference tabic. If a negoti
ated border treaty should eventu
ally bo reached, it will be in the
interest of all the peoples of
South Asia.
The very nature of a dispute
implies either conflicting data or
different interpretations of data,
or a mixture of both. The Sino-

"natural line,” and alternatively,
“roughly the MacMahon line.”
On the first definition, it is all
but impossible to be precise, since
the major rivers which flow
through the eastern Himalayan
range break through the moun
tain chain in a north-south direc
tion, thus the watershed runs
north-south along a frontier
which runs east to west.
It is difficult to imagine how
watershed lines which are per
pendicular to the frontier could
be used to delineate the frontier.
ALTERNATIVELY, the Mac-
Mahon line has never been ac
cepted by the Chinese govern
ment, not in 1914 nor at any later
date. In fact, of the three partici
pants at the convention only the
British delegation had no reserva
tions. The third party, represent
ing the Lama of Lhasa, made it
explicitly clear that his govern
ment did not consider the conven
tion satisfactory from its point
of view. (Cf. “The Boundary
Question Between China and Ti
bet,” p. 145 et sqq.)
Thus of the three parties to the
Simla convention one party. Chi
na, rejected the convention out
right; the second party, the Lon
chen (representing Lhasa), stipu
lated the disatisfaction of his gov
ernment to the convention; and
only the British delegate accept
ed the convention in full.
Just how valid such an arrange
ment is remains an open question.
A further question, of course, is
the validity of the present Indian
government’s assumption of the
situation created by the near-uni
lateral efforts of the British
government. The confused state
of the border of the eastern sec
tor is reflected in unbiased schol
arly sources. The 1929 edition of
the “Encyclopedia Britannica did
not use the MacMahon line as the
boundary in this sector, but in
stead retained the older bounda
ry. which is the current border
claimed by both Chinese govern
ments. The “Oxford Advanced
Atlas” (1950 edition) also used
the border claimed by the Chinese

government.
SUCH THEN, in brief, is the
status of the frontier demarca
tion of the two disputed sectors.
(B). In October of last year the
unsettled state of the border be
came even more unsettled with
the crossing of swords between
Chinese and Indian armed troops.
On Oct. 12 Nehru gave orders
that the Chinese border posts be
evicted from what was claimed
as Indian territory. These clear
cut directives were the immedi
ate result of the first serious in
cident, which took place in the
eastern sector, near Dhola post
(Leh) on Sept. 20.

Dhola is situated on latitude
27 degrees 46.5’ north. Based on
the original 1914 Simla conven
tion map (which the Indian gov
ernment accepts, but which both
Chinese governments do not), the
MacMahon line lies at latitude 27
degrees 44.5’ north, i.e., to the
south of Dhola; i.e., the fighting
took place beyond the Indian
claim. This fact w’as mentioned
in no western paper except in
“The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962.
WHAT FOLLOWED after Neh
ru’s Oct. 12 order is now
hashed history. Diplomatic ulti
matums flew in both directions,
followed by large-scale military
operations along both sectors, in
Jammu in the west as well as in
the eastern Himalayas. A last
chance at avoiding the conflict of
last October came just prior to
the Chinese initiation of counter
attack maneuvers.
In the Oct. 14 editorial of the
Peking “Jenmin Jih Pao,” condi
tions for a last-ditch effort at
peaceful settlement were pro
posed, which consisted of both
sides pulling back 12 miles from
the positions in which opposing
forces were facing each other.
This was essentially the same
proposal voiced by the Chinese
government three years earlier,
on Nov. 7, 1959, following the oc
currence of minor border clashes.
At that date the Chinese pro
posed that both sides withdraw
their forces 12 miles from where
they were positioned, and that the
border question be settled
through negotiations. The Indian
government turned down the
1959 proposal, as it also did the
Oct. 14, 1962, proposal.
NEHRU’S ORDERS of Oct. 12
were not impulsive gestures, for
already an Indian army corps of
at least 50,000 men was deployed
in the eastern sector under the
experienced General B. M. Kaul.
("The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962,
and "New York Times,” Oct. 6).
At the same time, on the Chinese
side of the border, extensive mili
tary preparations must have
taken place, in view of the subse
quent heavy involvement of
troops.
The military campaign conduct
ed along the world's most for
midable mountain ranges ended
with Chinese forces capturing
practically all the territory
claimed by China, on both the
western and the eastern sectors.
When the swords wore uncrossed,
the Chinese government with
drew its troops in the eastern sec
tor to a line roughly along the po
sitions prior to the campaign. On
the western sector Chinese forces
withdrew some 12 miles from
their line of furthest advance.
Prior to the withdrawals the
Chinese government announced
that negotiations should bo con
ducted either in New Delhi or in
Peking. Once again the Indian
government, in the face of strong
nationalistic sentiments, respond
ed negatively to the proposal.
Subsequently, after tempers cool
ed a few degrees, Prime Minister
Nehru suggested that India might

be willing to place the border dis
pute in the hands of an interna
tional court. The Chinese, how
ever, showed more respect to the
mediation efforts of a group of
neutral Afro-Asian states.

(C). VARIOUS and divergent
political currents have developed
as a result of the Sino-Indian bor
der dispute. The government of
Pakistan feared that the western
arms given to India might be
used against her. The Nationalist
government of China protested
the support of the U.S. for In
dian boundary claims, thus sup
porting Communist China’s
claims.

Internal Indian politics under
went radical splits and realign
ments. The complex of Southeast
Asian power relations became
further entangled. All these po
litical implications cannot be
dealt with in detail here.
The facts of the case would
seem to indicate that enither side
has clear-cut proof of their sov
ereignty over the disputed areas.
In light of this, the simplistic talk
of Chinese aggression and the cry
of invasion is somewhat question
able.

At the present writing, the Si
no-Indian dispute seems to be
heading toward the direction of
the conference tabic. If a negoti
ated border treaty should eventu
ally bo reached, it will be in the
interest of all the peoples of
South Asia.
The very nature of a dispute
implies either conflicting data or
different interpretations of data,
or a mixture of both. The Sino-
Indian border dispute is no ex
ception. Thus far nationalism and
emotionalism have entered in
evitably into the picture, further
complicated by the cross currents
of cold war illogicality and the
complex of power relations in
South Asia.
In older to analyze the dispute
in outline form, I propose to view
the question under three differ
ent aspects: (a) the status of the
frontier demarcation; (b) the
crossing of swords; and (c) the
political implications.
Two separate sector boundaries
are in dispute between the gov
ernments of China and India. In
the west the frontier between the
Indian state of Jammu and Kash
mir and the Chinese provinces of
Sinkiang and Tibet; and in the
eastern sector, the frontier be
tween the Indian Northeast Fron
tier Agency annd the Chinese
provinces of Tibet and Sinkiang
are in dispute.
AS LATE AS 1950 the official
Indian government agency Sur
vey of India published a definitive
map entitled “India Showing Po
litical Divisions in the New Re
public” in which the entire bor
der of Jammu facing China was
marked “boundary undefined.”
Four years later the same agency
published the “Political Map of
India” in which the border was
precisely drawn.
This latter alignment defines
the present Indian government
claims. But what remains unclear
is how it was possible for an un
defined boundary of 1950 to be
come the definitive border of
1954. What is beyond dispute is
that between these intervening
years there was no joint govern
mental delineation of the border,
no treaty signed between the gov
ernments of India and China.
In fact it was not until 1958
that an Indian reconnaissance
party was sent to the area.
(Prime Minister Nehru, state
ment in the Lok Sabha, August
28. 1959). This reconnaisance
party found itself in the hands of
Chinese border guards. Speaking
on Feb, 23, 1961, Nehru stated in
the Lok Sabha that as late as
1957 he did not know whether
Chinese border guards had vio
lated Indian territory.
IT THUS remains an open
question how the 1954 Survey of

India map could have been so
definitive in the delineation of
the border, and how valid such a
delineation could become the ba
sis of subsequent Indian govern
ment claims.
In the eastern sector, the bor
der claimed by the Indian govern
ment is even less clear. Currently
the Indian government claims
that the watershed line of the
eastern Himalayan range is the
"natural line,” and alternatively,

the original 1914 Simla conven
tion map (which the Indian gov
ernment accepts, but which both
Chinese governments do not), the
MacMahon line lies at latitude 27
degrees 44.5’ north, i.e., to the
south of Dhola; i.e., the fighting
took place beyond the Indian
claim. This fact w’as mentioned
in no western paper except in
“The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962.
WHAT FOLLOWED after Neh
ru’s Oct. 12 order is now
hashed history. Diplomatic ulti
matums flew in both directions,
followed by large-scale military
operations along both sectors, in
Jammu in the west as well as in
the eastern Himalayas. A last
chance at avoiding the conflict of
last October came just prior to
the Chinese initiation of counter
attack maneuvers.
In the Oct. 14 editorial of the
Peking “Jenmin Jih Pao,” condi
tions for a last-ditch effort at
peaceful settlement were pro
posed, which consisted of both
sides pulling back 12 miles from
the positions in which opposing
forces were facing each other.
This was essentially the same
proposal voiced by the Chinese
government three years earlier,
on Nov. 7, 1959, following the oc
currence of minor border clashes.
At that date the Chinese pro
posed that both sides withdraw
their forces 12 miles from where
they were positioned, and that the
border question be settled
through negotiations. The Indian
government turned down the
1959 proposal, as it also did the
Oct. 14, 1962, proposal.
NEHRU’S ORDERS of Oct. 12
were not impulsive gestures, for
already an Indian army corps of
at least 50,000 men was deployed
in the eastern sector under the
experienced General B. M. Kaul.
("The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962,
and "New York Times,” Oct. 6).
At the same time, on the Chinese
side of the border, extensive mili
tary preparations must have
taken place, in view of the subse
quent heavy involvement of
troops.
The military campaign conduct
ed along the world's most for
midable mountain ranges ended
with Chinese forces capturing
practically all the territory
claimed by China, on both the
western and the eastern sectors.
When the swords wore uncrossed,
the Chinese government with
drew its troops in the eastern sec
tor to a line roughly along the po
sitions prior to the campaign. On
the western sector Chinese forces
withdrew some 12 miles from
their line of furthest advance.
Prior to the withdrawals the
Chinese government announced
that negotiations should bo con
ducted either in New Delhi or in
Peking. Once again the Indian
government, in the face of strong
nationalistic sentiments, respond
ed negatively to the proposal.
Subsequently, after tempers cool
ed a few degrees, Prime Minister
Nehru suggested that India might

be willing to place the border dis
pute in the hands of an interna
tional court. The Chinese, how
ever, showed more respect to the
mediation efforts of a group of
neutral Afro-Asian states.

(C). VARIOUS and divergent
political currents have developed
as a result of the Sino-Indian bor
der dispute. The government of
Pakistan feared that the western
arms given to India might be
used against her. The Nationalist
government of China protested
the support of the U.S. for In
dian boundary claims, thus sup
porting Communist China’s
claims.

Internal Indian politics under
went radical splits and realign
ments. The complex of Southeast
Asian power relations became
further entangled. All these po
litical implications cannot be
dealt with in detail here.
The facts of the case would
seem to indicate that enither side
has clear-cut proof of their sov
ereignty over the disputed areas.
In light of this, the simplistic talk
of Chinese aggression and the cry
of invasion is somewhat question
able.

At the present writing, the Si
no-Indian dispute seems to be
heading toward the direction of
the conference tabic. If a negoti
ated border treaty should eventu
ally bo reached, it will be in the
interest of all the peoples of
South Asia.
The very nature of a dispute
implies either conflicting data or
different interpretations of data,
or a mixture of both. The Sino-
Indian border dispute is no ex
ception. Thus far nationalism and
emotionalism have entered in
evitably into the picture, further
complicated by the cross currents
of cold war illogicality and the
complex of power relations in
South Asia.
In older to analyze the dispute
in outline form, I propose to view
the question under three differ
ent aspects: (a) the status of the
frontier demarcation; (b) the
crossing of swords; and (c) the
political implications.
Two separate sector boundaries
are in dispute between the gov
ernments of China and India. In
the west the frontier between the
Indian state of Jammu and Kash
mir and the Chinese provinces of
Sinkiang and Tibet; and in the
eastern sector, the frontier be
tween the Indian Northeast Fron
tier Agency annd the Chinese
provinces of Tibet and Sinkiang
are in dispute.
AS LATE AS 1950 the official
Indian government agency Sur
vey of India published a definitive
map entitled “India Showing Po
litical Divisions in the New Re
public” in which the entire bor
der of Jammu facing China was
marked “boundary undefined.”
Four years later the same agency
published the “Political Map of
India” in which the border was
precisely drawn.
This latter alignment defines
the present Indian government
claims. But what remains unclear
is how it was possible for an un
defined boundary of 1950 to be
come the definitive border of
1954. What is beyond dispute is
that between these intervening
years there was no joint govern
mental delineation of the border,
no treaty signed between the gov
ernments of India and China.
In fact it was not until 1958
that an Indian reconnaissance
party was sent to the area.
(Prime Minister Nehru, state
ment in the Lok Sabha, August
28. 1959). This reconnaisance
party found itself in the hands of
Chinese border guards. Speaking
on Feb, 23, 1961, Nehru stated in
the Lok Sabha that as late as
1957 he did not know whether
Chinese border guards had vio
lated Indian territory.
IT THUS remains an open
question how the 1954 Survey of

India map could have been so
definitive in the delineation of
the border, and how valid such a
delineation could become the ba
sis of subsequent Indian govern
ment claims.
In the eastern sector, the bor
der claimed by the Indian govern
ment is even less clear. Currently
the Indian government claims
that the watershed line of the
eastern Himalayan range is the
"natural line,” and alternatively,
“roughly the MacMahon line.”
On the first definition, it is all
but impossible to be precise, since
the major rivers which flow
through the eastern Himalayan
range break through the moun
tain chain in a north-south direc
tion, thus the watershed runs
north-south along a frontier
which runs east to west.
It is difficult to imagine how
watershed lines which are per
pendicular to the frontier could
be used to delineate the frontier.
ALTERNATIVELY, the Mac-
Mahon line has never been ac
cepted by the Chinese govern
ment, not in 1914 nor at any later
date. In fact, of the three partici
pants at the convention only the
British delegation had no reserva
tions. The third party, represent
ing the Lama of Lhasa, made it
explicitly clear that his govern
ment did not consider the conven
tion satisfactory from its point
of view. (Cf. “The Boundary
Question Between China and Ti
bet,” p. 145 et sqq.)
Thus of the three parties to the
Simla convention one party. Chi
na, rejected the convention out
right; the second party, the Lon
chen (representing Lhasa), stipu
lated the disatisfaction of his gov
ernment to the convention; and
only the British delegate accept
ed the convention in full.
Just how valid such an arrange
ment is remains an open question.
A further question, of course, is
the validity of the present Indian
government’s assumption of the
situation created by the near-uni
lateral efforts of the British
government. The confused state
of the border of the eastern sec
tor is reflected in unbiased schol
arly sources. The 1929 edition of
the “Encyclopedia Britannica did
not use the MacMahon line as the
boundary in this sector, but in
stead retained the older bounda
ry. which is the current border
claimed by both Chinese govern
ments. The “Oxford Advanced
Atlas” (1950 edition) also used
the border claimed by the Chinese

government.
SUCH THEN, in brief, is the
status of the frontier demarca
tion of the two disputed sectors.
(B). In October of last year the
unsettled state of the border be
came even more unsettled with
the crossing of swords between
Chinese and Indian armed troops.
On Oct. 12 Nehru gave orders
that the Chinese border posts be
evicted from what was claimed
as Indian territory. These clear
cut directives were the immedi
ate result of the first serious in
cident, which took place in the
eastern sector, near Dhola post
(Leh) on Sept. 20.

Dhola is situated on latitude
27 degrees 46.5’ north. Based on
the original 1914 Simla conven
tion map (which the Indian gov
ernment accepts, but which both
Chinese governments do not), the
MacMahon line lies at latitude 27

that negotiations should bo con
ducted either in New Delhi or in
Peking. Once again the Indian
government, in the face of strong
nationalistic sentiments, respond
ed negatively to the proposal.
Subsequently, after tempers cool
ed a few degrees, Prime Minister
Nehru suggested that India might

be willing to place the border dis
pute in the hands of an interna
tional court. The Chinese, how
ever, showed more respect to the
mediation efforts of a group of
neutral Afro-Asian states.

(C). VARIOUS and divergent
political currents have developed
as a result of the Sino-Indian bor
der dispute. The government of
Pakistan feared that the western
arms given to India might be
used against her. The Nationalist
government of China protested
the support of the U.S. for In
dian boundary claims, thus sup
porting Communist China’s
claims.

Internal Indian politics under
went radical splits and realign
ments. The complex of Southeast
Asian power relations became
further entangled. All these po
litical implications cannot be
dealt with in detail here.
The facts of the case would
seem to indicate that enither side
has clear-cut proof of their sov
ereignty over the disputed areas.
In light of this, the simplistic talk
of Chinese aggression and the cry
of invasion is somewhat question
able.

At the present writing, the Si
no-Indian dispute seems to be
heading toward the direction of
the conference tabic. If a negoti
ated border treaty should eventu
ally bo reached, it will be in the
interest of all the peoples of
South Asia.
The very nature of a dispute
implies either conflicting data or
different interpretations of data,
or a mixture of both. The Sino-
Indian border dispute is no ex
ception. Thus far nationalism and
emotionalism have entered in
evitably into the picture, further
complicated by the cross currents
of cold war illogicality and the
complex of power relations in
South Asia.
In older to analyze the dispute
in outline form, I propose to view
the question under three differ
ent aspects: (a) the status of the
frontier demarcation; (b) the
crossing of swords; and (c) the
political implications.
Two separate sector boundaries
are in dispute between the gov
ernments of China and India. In
the west the frontier between the
Indian state of Jammu and Kash
mir and the Chinese provinces of
Sinkiang and Tibet; and in the
eastern sector, the frontier be
tween the Indian Northeast Fron
tier Agency annd the Chinese
provinces of Tibet and Sinkiang
are in dispute.
AS LATE AS 1950 the official
Indian government agency Sur
vey of India published a definitive
map entitled “India Showing Po
litical Divisions in the New Re
public” in which the entire bor
der of Jammu facing China was
marked “boundary undefined.”
Four years later the same agency
published the “Political Map of
India” in which the border was
precisely drawn.
This latter alignment defines
the present Indian government
claims. But what remains unclear
is how it was possible for an un
defined boundary of 1950 to be
come the definitive border of
1954. What is beyond dispute is
that between these intervening
years there was no joint govern
mental delineation of the border,
no treaty signed between the gov
ernments of India and China.
In fact it was not until 1958
that an Indian reconnaissance
party was sent to the area.
(Prime Minister Nehru, state
ment in the Lok Sabha, August
28. 1959). This reconnaisance
party found itself in the hands of
Chinese border guards. Speaking
on Feb, 23, 1961, Nehru stated in
the Lok Sabha that as late as
1957 he did not know whether
Chinese border guards had vio
lated Indian territory.
IT THUS remains an open
question how the 1954 Survey of

India map could have been so
definitive in the delineation of
the border, and how valid such a
delineation could become the ba
sis of subsequent Indian govern
ment claims.
In the eastern sector, the bor
der claimed by the Indian govern
ment is even less clear. Currently
the Indian government claims
that the watershed line of the
eastern Himalayan range is the
"natural line,” and alternatively,
“roughly the MacMahon line.”
On the first definition, it is all
but impossible to be precise, since
the major rivers which flow
through the eastern Himalayan
range break through the moun
tain chain in a north-south direc
tion, thus the watershed runs
north-south along a frontier
which runs east to west.
It is difficult to imagine how
watershed lines which are per
pendicular to the frontier could
be used to delineate the frontier.
ALTERNATIVELY, the Mac-
Mahon line has never been ac
cepted by the Chinese govern
ment, not in 1914 nor at any later
date. In fact, of the three partici
pants at the convention only the
British delegation had no reserva
tions. The third party, represent
ing the Lama of Lhasa, made it
explicitly clear that his govern
ment did not consider the conven
tion satisfactory from its point
of view. (Cf. “The Boundary
Question Between China and Ti
bet,” p. 145 et sqq.)
Thus of the three parties to the
Simla convention one party. Chi
na, rejected the convention out
right; the second party, the Lon
chen (representing Lhasa), stipu
lated the disatisfaction of his gov
ernment to the convention; and
only the British delegate accept
ed the convention in full.
Just how valid such an arrange
ment is remains an open question.
A further question, of course, is
the validity of the present Indian
government’s assumption of the
situation created by the near-uni
lateral efforts of the British
government. The confused state
of the border of the eastern sec
tor is reflected in unbiased schol
arly sources. The 1929 edition of
the “Encyclopedia Britannica did
not use the MacMahon line as the
boundary in this sector, but in
stead retained the older bounda
ry. which is the current border
claimed by both Chinese govern
ments. The “Oxford Advanced
Atlas” (1950 edition) also used
the border claimed by the Chinese

government.
SUCH THEN, in brief, is the
status of the frontier demarca
tion of the two disputed sectors.
(B). In October of last year the
unsettled state of the border be
came even more unsettled with
the crossing of swords between
Chinese and Indian armed troops.
On Oct. 12 Nehru gave orders
that the Chinese border posts be
evicted from what was claimed
as Indian territory. These clear
cut directives were the immedi
ate result of the first serious in
cident, which took place in the
eastern sector, near Dhola post
(Leh) on Sept. 20.

Dhola is situated on latitude
27 degrees 46.5’ north. Based on
the original 1914 Simla conven
tion map (which the Indian gov
ernment accepts, but which both
Chinese governments do not), the
MacMahon line lies at latitude 27
degrees 44.5’ north, i.e., to the
south of Dhola; i.e., the fighting
took place beyond the Indian
claim. This fact w’as mentioned
in no western paper except in
“The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962.
WHAT FOLLOWED after Neh
ru’s Oct. 12 order is now
hashed history. Diplomatic ulti
matums flew in both directions,
followed by large-scale military
operations along both sectors, in
Jammu in the west as well as in
the eastern Himalayas. A last
chance at avoiding the conflict of
last October came just prior to
the Chinese initiation of counter
attack maneuvers.
In the Oct. 14 editorial of the
Peking “Jenmin Jih Pao,” condi
tions for a last-ditch effort at
peaceful settlement were pro
posed, which consisted of both
sides pulling back 12 miles from
the positions in which opposing
forces were facing each other.
This was essentially the same
proposal voiced by the Chinese
government three years earlier,
on Nov. 7, 1959, following the oc
currence of minor border clashes.
At that date the Chinese pro
posed that both sides withdraw
their forces 12 miles from where
they were positioned, and that the
border question be settled
through negotiations. The Indian
government turned down the
1959 proposal, as it also did the
Oct. 14, 1962, proposal.
NEHRU’S ORDERS of Oct. 12
were not impulsive gestures, for
already an Indian army corps of
at least 50,000 men was deployed
in the eastern sector under the
experienced General B. M. Kaul.
("The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962,
and "New York Times,” Oct. 6).
At the same time, on the Chinese
side of the border, extensive mili
tary preparations must have
taken place, in view of the subse
quent heavy involvement of
troops.
The military campaign conduct
ed along the world's most for
midable mountain ranges ended
with Chinese forces capturing
practically all the territory
claimed by China, on both the
western and the eastern sectors.
When the swords wore uncrossed,
the Chinese government with
drew its troops in the eastern sec
tor to a line roughly along the po
sitions prior to the campaign. On
the western sector Chinese forces
withdrew some 12 miles from
their line of furthest advance.
Prior to the withdrawals the
Chinese government announced
that negotiations should bo con
ducted either in New Delhi or in
Peking. Once again the Indian
government, in the face of strong

der of Jammu facing China was
marked “boundary undefined.”
Four years later the same agency
published the “Political Map of
India” in which the border was
precisely drawn.
This latter alignment defines
the present Indian government
claims. But what remains unclear
is how it was possible for an un
defined boundary of 1950 to be
come the definitive border of
1954. What is beyond dispute is
that between these intervening
years there was no joint govern
mental delineation of the border,
no treaty signed between the gov
ernments of India and China.
In fact it was not until 1958
that an Indian reconnaissance
party was sent to the area.
(Prime Minister Nehru, state
ment in the Lok Sabha, August
28. 1959). This reconnaisance
party found itself in the hands of
Chinese border guards. Speaking
on Feb, 23, 1961, Nehru stated in
the Lok Sabha that as late as
1957 he did not know whether
Chinese border guards had vio
lated Indian territory.
IT THUS remains an open
question how the 1954 Survey of

India map could have been so
definitive in the delineation of
the border, and how valid such a
delineation could become the ba
sis of subsequent Indian govern
ment claims.
In the eastern sector, the bor
der claimed by the Indian govern
ment is even less clear. Currently
the Indian government claims
that the watershed line of the
eastern Himalayan range is the
"natural line,” and alternatively,
“roughly the MacMahon line.”
On the first definition, it is all
but impossible to be precise, since
the major rivers which flow
through the eastern Himalayan
range break through the moun
tain chain in a north-south direc
tion, thus the watershed runs
north-south along a frontier
which runs east to west.
It is difficult to imagine how
watershed lines which are per
pendicular to the frontier could
be used to delineate the frontier.
ALTERNATIVELY, the Mac-
Mahon line has never been ac
cepted by the Chinese govern
ment, not in 1914 nor at any later
date. In fact, of the three partici
pants at the convention only the
British delegation had no reserva
tions. The third party, represent
ing the Lama of Lhasa, made it
explicitly clear that his govern
ment did not consider the conven
tion satisfactory from its point
of view. (Cf. “The Boundary
Question Between China and Ti
bet,” p. 145 et sqq.)
Thus of the three parties to the
Simla convention one party. Chi
na, rejected the convention out
right; the second party, the Lon
chen (representing Lhasa), stipu
lated the disatisfaction of his gov
ernment to the convention; and
only the British delegate accept
ed the convention in full.
Just how valid such an arrange
ment is remains an open question.
A further question, of course, is
the validity of the present Indian
government’s assumption of the
situation created by the near-uni
lateral efforts of the British
government. The confused state
of the border of the eastern sec
tor is reflected in unbiased schol
arly sources. The 1929 edition of
the “Encyclopedia Britannica did
not use the MacMahon line as the
boundary in this sector, but in
stead retained the older bounda
ry. which is the current border
claimed by both Chinese govern
ments. The “Oxford Advanced
Atlas” (1950 edition) also used
the border claimed by the Chinese

government.
SUCH THEN, in brief, is the
status of the frontier demarca
tion of the two disputed sectors.
(B). In October of last year the
unsettled state of the border be
came even more unsettled with
the crossing of swords between
Chinese and Indian armed troops.
On Oct. 12 Nehru gave orders
that the Chinese border posts be
evicted from what was claimed
as Indian territory. These clear
cut directives were the immedi
ate result of the first serious in
cident, which took place in the
eastern sector, near Dhola post
(Leh) on Sept. 20.

Dhola is situated on latitude
27 degrees 46.5’ north. Based on
the original 1914 Simla conven
tion map (which the Indian gov
ernment accepts, but which both
Chinese governments do not), the
MacMahon line lies at latitude 27
degrees 44.5’ north, i.e., to the
south of Dhola; i.e., the fighting
took place beyond the Indian
claim. This fact w’as mentioned
in no western paper except in
“The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962.
WHAT FOLLOWED after Neh
ru’s Oct. 12 order is now
hashed history. Diplomatic ulti
matums flew in both directions,
followed by large-scale military
operations along both sectors, in
Jammu in the west as well as in
the eastern Himalayas. A last
chance at avoiding the conflict of
last October came just prior to
the Chinese initiation of counter
attack maneuvers.
In the Oct. 14 editorial of the
Peking “Jenmin Jih Pao,” condi
tions for a last-ditch effort at
peaceful settlement were pro
posed, which consisted of both
sides pulling back 12 miles from
the positions in which opposing
forces were facing each other.
This was essentially the same
proposal voiced by the Chinese
government three years earlier,
on Nov. 7, 1959, following the oc
currence of minor border clashes.
At that date the Chinese pro
posed that both sides withdraw
their forces 12 miles from where
they were positioned, and that the
border question be settled
through negotiations. The Indian
government turned down the
1959 proposal, as it also did the
Oct. 14, 1962, proposal.
NEHRU’S ORDERS of Oct. 12
were not impulsive gestures, for
already an Indian army corps of
at least 50,000 men was deployed
in the eastern sector under the
experienced General B. M. Kaul.
("The Economist,” Oct. 20, 1962,
and "New York Times,” Oct. 6).
At the same time, on the Chinese
side of the border, extensive mili
tary preparations must have
taken place, in view of the subse
quent heavy involvement of
troops.
The military campaign conduct
ed along the world's most for
midable mountain ranges ended
with Chinese forces capturing
practically all the territory
claimed by China, on both the
western and the eastern sectors.
When the swords wore uncrossed,
the Chinese government with
drew its troops in the eastern sec
tor to a line roughly along the po
sitions prior to the campaign. On
the western sector Chinese forces
withdrew some 12 miles from
their line of furthest advance.
Prior to the withdrawals the
Chinese government announced
that negotiations should bo con
ducted either in New Delhi or in
Peking. Once again the Indian
government, in the face of strong
nationalistic sentiments, respond
ed negatively to the proposal.
Subsequently, after tempers cool
ed a few degrees, Prime Minister
Nehru suggested that India might

be willing to place the border dis
pute in the hands of an interna
tional court. The Chinese, how
ever, showed more respect to the
mediation efforts of a group of
neutral Afro-Asian states.

(C). VARIOUS and divergent
political currents have developed
as a result of the Sino-Indian bor
der dispute. The government of
Pakistan feared that the western
arms given to India might be
used against her. The Nationalist
government of China protested
the support of the U.S. for In
dian boundary claims, thus sup
porting Communist China’s
claims.

Internal Indian politics under
went radical splits and realign
ments. The complex of Southeast
Asian power relations became
further entangled. All these po
litical implications cannot be
dealt with in detail here.
The facts of the case would
seem to indicate that enither side
has clear-cut proof of their sov
ereignty over the disputed areas.
In light of this, the simplistic talk
of Chinese aggression and the cry
of invasion is somewhat question
able.

At the present writing, the Si
no-Indian dispute seems to be
heading toward the direction of
the conference tabic. If a negoti
ated border treaty should eventu
ally bo reached, it will be in the
interest of all the peoples of
South Asia.
The very nature of a dispute
implies either conflicting data or
different interpretations of data,
or a mixture of both. The Sino-
Indian border dispute is no ex
ception. Thus far nationalism and
emotionalism have entered in
evitably into the picture, further
complicated by the cross currents
of cold war illogicality and the
complex of power relations in
South Asia.
In older to analyze the dispute
in outline form, I propose to view
the question under three differ
ent aspects: (a) the status of the
frontier demarcation; (b) the
crossing of swords; and (c) the
political implications.
Two separate sector boundaries
are in dispute between the gov
ernments of China and India. In
the west the frontier between the
Indian state of Jammu and Kash
mir and the Chinese provinces of
Sinkiang and Tibet; and in the
eastern sector, the frontier be
tween the Indian Northeast Fron
tier Agency annd the Chinese
provinces of Tibet and Sinkiang
are in dispute.
AS LATE AS 1950 the official
Indian government agency Sur
vey of India published a definitive
map entitled “India Showing Po
litical Divisions in the New Re
public” in which the entire bor
der of Jammu facing China was
marked “boundary undefined.”
Four years later the same agency
published the “Political Map of
India” in which the border was
