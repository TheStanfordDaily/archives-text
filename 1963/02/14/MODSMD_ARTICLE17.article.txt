# Asian Flu Hits Campus, Under Control So Far
## 
### 
A new epidemic of Asian flu
which is sweeping the nation has
not yet seriously affected Stan
ford, according to the Stanford
Health Service. There have been
a “handful” of influenza cases on
campus, most of them short and
not severe.
Dr. Maurice Osborne of the
Health Service says that this
time of year is the “classical pe
riod” for flu to strike, if it
strikes. This year’s outbreak is a
possible recurrence of the Asian
flu which appeared in 1957. The
epidemic will probably not be as
serious though, since most people
have now built up an immunity.
Flu shots are available at the
Health Service. Since it takes
eight weeks to build immunity
the Health Service does not rec
ommend that students take their
first shots now. For those who
were immunized last year, a
booster might be helpful. An es
timated two to three thousand
Stanford students have had the
shots already.
Across the nation, the flu bug
has already left its marks. Mary
land has been fighting a flu epi
demic for the last four weeks. In
Kentucky several schools had to
be closed because of the high
number of absences. Health au
thorities in Indiana report its
worst epidemic in 30 years.
Dr. Osborne pointed out that
while most students need not be
too concerned about the virus,
students with respiratory trou
ble, older people, and pregnant
women are usually more suscep
tible to the influenza.
