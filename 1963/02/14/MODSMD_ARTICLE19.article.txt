# SJS Wrestlers Pin Stanford 20-6
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
San Jose Slate beat Stanford
20-6. in a wrestling match at En
cina Gym last night. The Indians
picked up their team points on
victories in the 157-pound class by
Phil Kendall, and in the 167-pound
class by Jim Cannon.
Not even a friendly referee who
passed out technical violations as
though they were some kind of
free sample could alter the final
outcome. In the course of the
meet, the referee called four vi
olations against the visitors, for
such offenses as covering the op
position’s face, crawling off the
mat deliberately, and unnecessary
roughness.
Only two matches were one

sided, in both cases to Stanford’s
disadvantage. At 123 George Mus
ser was in constant trouble, but
lasted the full nine minutes, los
ing the match, 9-1. At 147, Hap
Klopp, against Warren King,
probably SJS’s best wrestler, sur
vived four minutes and several
near pins, before losing. At the
time he was down, 12-1.
THE INDIANS looked much
better in the other matches, all
of which were either won or lost
by close margins. In the lighter
weights: at 130, Tim Davis and
the Spartans’ Dave Armstrong
traded the lead several times be
fore Armstrong pulled ahead 6-5,
picking up a bonus point for rid
ing time for a final 7-5 score. Dan
Barrett also lost his match at 137,

5-0.
At the half-way point, the In
dians were down 14-0. But. Ken
dall and Cannon came through
with wins to cut the margin to
eight points, 14-6. In what was
certainly the best match of the
night, Kendall and SJS’s Cliff Ol
son wont scoreless until about
midway in the second period
when Olson went off the mat too
quickly—costing him a point.
Kendall gained another point on
an escape and a third for riding
lime for a 3-0 win. At 167 Cannon
won another close one, 2-1, on a
reversal.
At 177 Tom Allen lost 4-2 re
peatedly barely missing take
downs throughout the match.
Don Beuhler lost 5-3 at heavy
weight in the final match, which
like most of the others, was pain
fully close.
