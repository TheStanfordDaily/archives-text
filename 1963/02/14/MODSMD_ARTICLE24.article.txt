# Lakers Miss West, Stumble In East
## 
### JIM DONOVAN 
The Los Angeles Lakers have
been slowed to a standstill in
their drive for the Western Di
vision championship and a per
centage edge over the perennial
Eastern champs, the Boston Cel
tics.
The Lakers have lost their last
two and were lucky to eek out
94-91 and 107-106 wins over the
lowly Chicago Zephyrs in the two
preceding games. They were
soundly defeated 120-93 by the
rival Celtics Tuesday night in
their most recent outing.
This sudden collapse can be at
tributed to the loss of Jerry West,
who has a bad muscle pull and
has been unable to play in the
last four games.

The high scoring West was, of
course, the key to the Lakers
Western Division championship
drive last year and to their strong
start this season. His outside
shooting has kept the pressure
off Rudy Larusso and the incom
parable Elgin Baylor up-front to
such an extent that the Lakers
have been a most successful team
without a good, or even adequate
center, a rare feat in NBA com
'petition.
However, even though a back
court man, West at 6-3 and 185
lbs., is almost too fragile for the
pounding he receives during the
nearly 100-game schedule (count
ing exhibition and play-off
games) that the Lakers must
play.

He has been remarkably dur
able so far, but how long he will
be able to continue the relentless
pace that he must if the Lakers
are to keep winning, is a matter
for conjecture.
