# S.T.&T. BUSINESS PROGRAM
## Students Concerned With Expediency 
### WILLIAM REID 
Stanford undergraduates inter
ested in attending business school
are primarily concerned with the
financial rewards to be earned by
business school graduates, judg
ing from questions addressed to
panelists following yesterday’s in
formation program on business
schools and careers. Held at Tres
idder Union, the program was
presented by Stanford Today and
Tomorrow in conjunction with
the Graduate school of Business
and the Placement Service.

) Steven Grand-Jean opened the
j meeting by introducing Nathan
! iel Allyn, director of admissions
| Graduate School of Businesses,
| who gave some introductory re
! marks concerning the admissions
i process of the business school,
J some basic factors which influ-
I (mce the decision of whether or
not a person should go to a busi
ness school, and the three types
j of business schools.
ALLVN indicated six factors by 1
which th e Admissions Depart
ment of the Stanford Business
[ School choose their students. A
i student should have a B average
I and be able to show a definite in
| tercst in entering the field of
j business, not just a desire to ob
{ tain further education. Allyn also
j said a student’s undergraduate
i major makes no difference to the
j admissions department. The three
other considerations are the busi-
I ness board exams, extra-curricu
lar activities, and experience in
I business.
j Allyn then introduced William
I Lowe, Director of Business and
Technical Placement. Lowe said
that there is “no rod carpet” for
those with the M.B.A. degree and
that employers are looking for
the individuals and not the de
j gree.
After these introductory re
marks the floor was open for
- questions: questions directed to
I Allyn were primarily concerned
I : with how one can most easily in-
| 1 sure entrance to a top business
| school and with which types of
students are most sought by these
schools. The questions directed

to Lowe mainly concerned how i
much money one can make once
one has an M.B.A. degree, and
how much trouble one has getting
a job.
ONE OF THESE questions
was: what considerations do busi-1
ness school admissions make for
those who have done their mili
tary service before entering busi
ness school? Allyn answered by
saying that since these people are
older, they are probably more
mature and arc more sure that
they want to go to business
school.

I Lowe added that once one has
his degree from a business school,
those who have done their mili
tary service are more appealing
to perspective employers.
Today, Stanford Today and To
-1 morrow continues their informa
tion program for undergraduates
with a similar program on the
Stanford Law School. Professor
William T. Keogh, Associate Dean
of the Law School, and Professor
John R. McDonough Jr., Acting
Dean of the Law School, will rep
resent the Law School in the dis
cussion at Tresidder at 4:30.
