# Cap and Gown Initiates New Selection Method
## 
### 
A new “tapping” procedure is
being initiated this year by the
Cap and Gown, Stanford women’s
honorary society.
Under the new procedure let
ters have been sent out during
the past weeks to resident assist
ants and directors in women’s
dorms and to the heads of student
organizations, asking them for
the names of girls who might be
eligible for Cap and Gown on llie
basis of leadership and service.
In the past members of the
honorary society were nominated
from activity and grade-point list
ings. Then Cap and Gown mem
bers then talked to people asso
ciated with the women eligible to
determine her contributions to
the University. This plan became
increasingly less practical as the
number of women at Stanford
increased. The new procedure was
adopted by this year's actives to
correct the situation.
Cap and Gown members arc
selected by active members from
the junior and senior classes on
the basis of leadership and schol
arship. The actual “tapping” will
take place this quarter when the
actives, dressed in caps and
gowns, will visit each dining hall
and “tap” the new girls, who will
then be taken to a dessert and
pinning ceremony with the Cap
and Gown Alumnae Board at
President Sterling’s homo.
Today, the most important proj
ect of the society is the sponsor
ship of two scholarships, one of
which goes to a foreign student.
This year’s Cap and Gown schol
ars are Judy Myers and Naziti
Choucri, ASSU scholar from
Egypt. These scholarships are
financed by the sale of Stanford
appointment calendars.
