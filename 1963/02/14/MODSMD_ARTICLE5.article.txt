LOS ANGELES Secretary of State Doan Rusk last night called
for early withdrawal of Soviet troops from Cuba. He said they
“poison the atmosphere and increase the dangers.” Rusk said both
Russian and Cuban officials must recognize the peril posed by this
situation and “the sooner this source of potential trouble is elimi
nated, the better for everyone concerned.”
The secretary reiterated (hat the United States is “reasonably
certain” that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev has pulled out all
the offensive weapons he secretly introduced into Cuba. But Rusk
acknowledged that it is impossible to “be absolutely certain” that
none remains, in the absence of the on-the-spot inspection.
