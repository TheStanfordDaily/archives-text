# WHEN IT RAINS:
## All the Quad's a Mudpuddle 
### ROBERT NAYLOR 
Do you enjoy wading through
mud puddles, leaping from curb
to flooded street, or standing an
inch deep in sheets of water pour
ing down past the book store and
post office? If you do, chances
are you’ll have plenty of oppor
tunity for watery recreation in
years to come.
It is true that the problem of
flood drainage on the central
campus area will be alleviated
somewhat during the next two
years, but “some trouble spots
will possibly remain for quite a
while,” according to John Lorry,
engineer in charge of utilities at
the Planning Office.
THE MAIN trouble spot, the
student activities center (book
store, Tresidder, etc.), will see

the installation of flood drainage
sewers starting this summer, ac
cording to Dan Rolfs, senior plan
ner. Work will bo completed by
June 1 on ditch systems to re
lieve flooding on Palm Drive,
near the chemistry center, and in
other out lying areas, especially
around the stadium.
When asked the reason for in
adequate drainage during the
first winter rains, Elbridge Bacon
Jr., Superintendent of the Build
ings and Grounds Dept., empha
sized that recent rains were high
ly unusual.
THOSE RAINS poured 4U
inches into Stanford in a little
over two days, 214 inches falling
within one 24-hour period. The
average yearly rainfall for this
area is about 15 inches.
“For this typo of storm, present
drainage systems are ineffective
and have been for years,” Bacon
stated.
He added that such rains, hard
er than anything since the 1955-
56 academic year, will always

create problems.
EXCEPT TO relieve street
flooding, there is no work plan
ned for the out-lying campus or
the wooded area between the Quad
and El Camino. The small lakes
which form in those areas are
really blessings, said Bacon. They
are the only means for getting
the water back into the well sys
tem, thereby reducing the amount
of water Stanford must purchase
from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
system that supplies San Fran
cisco.
This is not to say that water
experts are overjoyed when
there are hard storms. Bacon es
timated that in the heavy rain of
tw'o weeks ago, two years’ supply
of water was lost "to the fish in
the Bay” due to the inability of
the ground to absorb the rain so
quickly.
In spite of such losses, how
ever. the level of the water table
is up 50 feet over last year be
cause Palo Alto no longer uses
the same supply.

THOUGH PERHAPS this resembles the Quad, during the last rain storm, in fact it is Stanford s
Lagunita. The lake holds 103 million gallons and is at the moment about a foot from the top.
We have been assured it will not overflow.

are you’ll have plenty of oppor

years to come.
It is true that the problem of
flood drainage on the central
campus area will be alleviated
somewhat during the next two
years, but “some trouble spots
will possibly remain for quite a
while,” according to John Lorry,
engineer in charge of utilities at
the Planning Office.
THE MAIN trouble spot, the
student activities center (book
store, Tresidder, etc.), will see

the installation of flood drainage
sewers starting this summer, ac
cording to Dan Rolfs, senior plan
ner. Work will bo completed by
June 1 on ditch systems to re
lieve flooding on Palm Drive,
near the chemistry center, and in
other out lying areas, especially
around the stadium.
When asked the reason for in
adequate drainage during the
first winter rains, Elbridge Bacon
Jr., Superintendent of the Build
ings and Grounds Dept., empha
sized that recent rains were high
ly unusual.
THOSE RAINS poured 4U
inches into Stanford in a little
over two days, 214 inches falling
within one 24-hour period. The
average yearly rainfall for this
area is about 15 inches.
“For this typo of storm, present
drainage systems are ineffective
and have been for years,” Bacon
stated.
He added that such rains, hard
er than anything since the 1955-
56 academic year, will always

create problems.
EXCEPT TO relieve street
flooding, there is no work plan
ned for the out-lying campus or
the wooded area between the Quad
and El Camino. The small lakes
which form in those areas are
really blessings, said Bacon. They
are the only means for getting
the water back into the well sys
tem, thereby reducing the amount
of water Stanford must purchase
from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
system that supplies San Fran
cisco.
This is not to say that water
experts are overjoyed when
there are hard storms. Bacon es
timated that in the heavy rain of
tw'o weeks ago, two years’ supply
of water was lost "to the fish in
the Bay” due to the inability of
the ground to absorb the rain so
quickly.
In spite of such losses, how
ever. the level of the water table
is up 50 feet over last year be
cause Palo Alto no longer uses
the same supply.

THOUGH PERHAPS this resembles the Quad, during the last rain storm, in fact it is Stanford s
Lagunita. The lake holds 103 million gallons and is at the moment about a foot from the top.
We have been assured it will not overflow.
