# Stanford Volunteers Aid Students and Community
## 
### 
The Stanford Volunteers is an
organization fulfilling two needs:
the need of students wishing to
serve their community and the
need of institutions within the
community for their service. Or
ganized last fall by A1 Shevack, a
junior history major, the Volun
teers act as a liason between some
fifty institutions employing vol
unteer help and a growing group
of around three hundred students
interested in donating their time
to voluntary work.

Among the institutions the stu
dents serve are the two Palo Alto
hospitals, The Stanford Convales
cent Home, The Palo Alto Chil
dren’s Health Council, The Sara
toga Children’s Home, The Blind
Society, and The Palo Alto Y.M.
C.A. Services performed by the
students include: reading to the
blind; providing transportation
for out-patients from their homes
to hospitals for physical therapy
and supervising playground ac
tivities at the Children’s Health
Council.
The Convalescent Home Big
Brother Program is an example
of student service. Twelve volun
teers visit several asthmatic chil
dren during the week and help
organize recreation on weekends.
“Our goal,’’ said Shevack, “is
to give every student at Stanford
who wishes it, an opportunity to
do volunteer social work. Also,
we feel that our organization will
advance a positive relationship
between the University and the
Palo Alto community.” He added
that the students who have par
ticipated have, almost without ex
ception, received a groat deal of
personal satisfaction from the
services they have performed.
Working with Shevack are
Penny Brook, treasurer, Molly
Wetmore, Bill Bush, John Mudd,
Jon Wagner, Carl Reid ■ Adam,
Frances Gralnek and Mary Ed
wards. They staff the telephones
at the Stanford Volunteer Office
at Bowman Alumni House on
Monday, Wednesday, and Thurs
day, from 3:15 to 5:15. The num
ber is DA 1-2300, extension 2810.
