# Supreme Court Justice White Addresses Stanford Audience

### MIKE WAGGONER Associate Editor 
The Supreme Court is not outrunning the legislature and ex
ecutive branches of government, nor is it any further behind
the progress of science than the other social disciplines, Supreme
Court Justice Byron R. White told an audience of law students
at Cubberley yesterday afternoon. In answer to a question he

i pointed out that the Supreme-'
Court cannot originate cases,
and can in fact only handle about
15 per cent of the cases brought
before it. Rather than ’‘legislat
ing," the Supreme Court often
| postpones action on especially
difficult constitutional questions,
he said. The Supreme Court’s
function is to answer these ques
tions, so it must take controversi
al stands. This should be inter
preted as “outrunning the legis
lative and executive branches,” he
said.
WHITE STATED that law usu
ally lags behind problems, as it is
developed to answer problems,
| not anticipate them. It inevitably
| will lag behind, but it does this
no more than the other social
disciplines. (In Atlanta, Ga., yes
terday, Chief Justice Earl War
ren had suggested that legal re
| search might speed the advance
| of law. just as scientific research
| speeds the development of sci
ence, i
j While denied that the Court
would lake cases in an area, such
as discrimination, which would
not be heard on their own merits
in order to open up the area to
[ the courts. He declined to give his
[ interpretation of “due process” of
law, due to cases pending.
A TREND for lawyers to dis
i appear into the business-economic
community has been reversed
1 since World War II, While said,
j and then told of some of the ad
• vantages of the legal profession
| and government work.
“Being a New Frontiersman, do
1 you expect to be a liberal force
' on the Court?,” asked a student.

“There are those who would
call the New Frontier conserva
tive,” White replied, “and I don’t
like generalities like ‘liberal.’ 1
would suggest you wait five or
ten years, then decide in lino with
your own definition of liberal and
my record on the Court whether
or not I am a liberal force.”
With that White ended his
speech and walked out of the
room to a standing ovation.
