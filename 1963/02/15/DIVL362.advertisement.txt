Four different ways to make goii
more fun than getting there
You can see why one of America’s
favorite outdoor sports is driving
Chevrolets, with four entirely different
kinds of cars to choose from. There’s
the Jet-smooth Chevrolet, about as luxu
rious as you can go without going over
board in price; the low-cost
Chevy 11, a good-looking car
that would send any family
packing; another family
favorite, the sporty Corvair,
will make you think that ice and snos\
are kid stuff; and for pure adventure,
America’s only sports car, Corvette
now in two all-new versions with looks
that can stop traffic like a rush-hour
blizzard. Picked your favorite already?
The next thing is to take
the wheel at your Chevrolet
dealer’s. If that doesn’t have
you thinking of places to
go, maybe you’d rather just
whose rear-engine traction HCPps uOlllg bt63t have a ball around town!
