The Aißesearch divisions of the Garrett Corpora
tion are among the most successful organizations
in the fascinating field of producing specially
designed aerospace systems and components for
prime manufacturers or government agencies.
I hey also compete in industrial and commercial
fields on an international basis.
At t larrctl-AiHesearch the products are highly
engineered. \ ou work on advanced systems and
equipment doing much original design and state
of the art work. 1 lie majority of your engineering

background and training will not he wasted; you
will need it to solve the problems encountered in
the development of sophisticated equipment.
The demand and respect for an intense engineer
ing effort at Garrell-Aißescarch creates a profes
sional atmosphere that is second to none in the
aerospace industry.
To help you in job placement, an orientation
program covering several months is available to
acquaint you with various laboratory, design and
development assignments.
