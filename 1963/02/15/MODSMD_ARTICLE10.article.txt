denias in the symbolic “tapping.”
New members met at the home
of President and Mrs. Sterling,
where they were honored with a
party given by Cap and Gown ac
tives and alumnae.
The purpose of the Cap and
Gown Society is to “Bring togeth
er women who have been con
structively active in student af
fairs” so that they may “repre
sent the interests of all Stanford
women, raise funds to support
women’s scholarships, and pro
vide continuity to worthwhile tra
ditions at Stanford.”
Cap and Gown pays for one
half tuition for a foreign woman
student and one-half tuition for
a U.S. woman student. The main
source of funds is the annual
Stanford calendar which is pub
lished and sold by Cap and Gown
each fall.
