# IWIS
## A
						Nation of Lemmings 
### HOWARD L. WEINBERG 
(Editors’ note: “Iwis” is a four-letter Anglo Saxon word
meaning “Certainly!” It is being used by Mr, Weinberg as a
name for his weekly column.)
The rabbit has hardly left the starling gate in the Year of
the Hare, but the hobbling human, a degree swifter than the
rabbit’s usual opponent the tortoise, has declared this shall be
the Year of the 50-Mile Hike. The name change may not go down
in history as indicated by the fact that few people remember
1962 as the Year of the Automatic Toothbrush.
Always trying to beat the rabbit at his own game, the peri
patetic human race has only succeeded in hiking the world’s
population. Now hiking for exercise, they can only manage to
exhaust themselves.
But we are a record setting nation. We feel pressure to
measure everything we do. We stay awake longer, talk longer,
raise money longer, live longer, than any other people. The slow
starting anthem “Oh, say can you . . .” must give way to “I
can do anything longer than you.” But with what purpose?
Not too long ago we were a Nation searching for a purpose.
Today we are fast becoming a Nation of Lemmings. Lemmings
are little rodents who live in Northern Scandinavia and for no
apparent reason—without regularity or purpose like salmon and
swallows—march in droves long distances and drop off high
cliffs into the sea en masse.
Ever notice how many old men drop off in the annual
Shriners’ parades? And they don’t walk any 50 miles. But the
American Medical Association refused to comment. Evidently
they think prudence and podiatry obviate officail warning.
But who can warn an American effectively? Far better it
would be to issue another challenge. For example, has any Stan
ford student tried to set a study record? Can he be alone with
himself and a stack of books for 50 hours?
All walking is not without purpose. Besides crossing the
street to get to the other side—the usual purpose, Mothers
march for polio, children trick or tx-eat for UNICEF, and stu
dents walk for peace. What can be done?
Union strikers walking in front of New York newspaper
offices might sit down at their linotypes again so New Yorkers
could walk again.
Scientists might well note this current linear acceleration
and compare it with the Eisenhower age circular motoin, the
hula hoop.
Musicians can write music to hike by. Dwayne Eddy might
revive his “Forty Miles of Bad Road,” by adding another ten
miles.
The Bi'itish lady who hiked around the world about a year
ago could obtain an injunction for infringement of copyright.
Fifty-mile hikers ai’e receiving more publicity for what she
ah-eady did a hundred times over. But the descendants of Teddy
Roosevelt might claim prior right to the idea. But all this non
sense could only hope to stall hiking for a while. The police
would issue hiking pexmits to qualified hikers and off they
would go.
Vaughn Meader could start a new craze when his new hiking
repertoire of jokes wears out.
Columnists could substitute other fads for hiking in hope of
turning the trend. Charles McCabe of the Chi'onicle yesterday
reported on laundronauts, the record holders of spinning time in
dry cleaning machines. But, sir, fearless spectator, that is pre
hiking, though it is post-bed-pushing and telephone booth
stuffing.
Fully expecting this mania of hiking to continue, the Chron
icle instituted a section called “The Hiker's Corner” yesterday.
The Cubans might chai'ge that we are secretly training for
an invasion. (If we’re going to emulate Teddy Roosevelt why
not be consistent?)
Why not give the lemmings guns? President Kennedy may
have considered it, but today he announced an idea of Franklin
Roosevelt’s. Moving forward from 1908 to 1933 the country Is
going to take all those young men walking an the highways and
put them to work in a new-type Civilian Conservation Corps.
Does anyone detect a trend of backward evolution? Don’t
think it’s only us Americans, remember in France Charlie de
Gaulle is playing Napoleon.
