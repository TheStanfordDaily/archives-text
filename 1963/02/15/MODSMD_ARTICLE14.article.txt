# ON OTHER CAMPUSES
## 'On the Farm' 
### 
(Editors’ note: The following appeared as an editorial last
Friday in the Colorado Daily of the University of Colorado at
Boulder.)
If seems that Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman isn’t
the only one who is faced with the question of how “to keep ’em
down on the farm.” The same problem has been afflicting Presi
dent Wallace Sterling and Dean of Students Donald Winbigler,
caretakers of Leland Stanford’s Palo Alto, California, spread.
The “Farm,” and the University located upon it, recently
has had a hard time keeping the undergraduate residents from
intellectually straying too far from home.
The trouble began when a local radio station, KPFA, and its
sponsor, the Pacifica Foundation, became the subjects of an in
vestigaiton by the .Senate Subcommittee for Internal Security
for alleged "leftist” and “Communist” activities.
When the Stanford student government heard of this, it con
sidered sending a resolution to Senator Thomas Dodd and FCC
Chairman Newton Minow expressing “grave concern” over the
probe and claiming the programs on KPFA were “intelligent,
illuminating and educationally valuable.”
When word of this got to Sterling, he decided he best put an
end to the tom foolery. Accordingly, he had Winbigler issue the
following directive; “. . . Pending the policy review and until
further notice, Stanford student organizations may not take pub
lic stands on issues affecting affairs beyond the Stanford cam
pus without prior University approval.”
The student government balked at this, and passed the
resolution anyway, as well as resolutions affirming its right to
speak on public issues.
How the affair will finally end remains to be seen, but al
ready three points stand out.
First, even if KPFA and the Pacifica Foundation turn out
to the left of Mau Tse Tung, Sterling and Winbigler had no
business trying to limit public discussion among the Stanford
student body. Students should not be asked to give up their basic
rights as Americans just because they chose to enroll at a
university.
Second, the Stanford student government; called the school
administration’s bluff. The administration tried to confine the
student body to campus by decree and found it couldn’t do so.
If it chooses to force the issue any further, it might well find
that the only way it can keep any students at all on campus is
with an electrified fence.
Tlvird, the Stanford University administration appears to
have picked a rather questionable goal for its University. Its
action seems to indicate that it would rather build an institution
that turns out well-combed, socially safe, non-controversial boys
and girls rather than one that produces men and women able
and eager to take part in the affairs of democracy.
It makes us rather glad that the prevailing idea at the Uni
versity of Colorado is that we should try to become the “Harvard
of the West,” not the “Stanford of the East.”
