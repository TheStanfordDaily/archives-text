If Mr. Weinig would employ his political acumen in a ration
al manner rather than utilize it in behalf of “rightist” mud-sling
ing, he might then begin to render the appearance of an informed
political scientist. Mr. Weinig has strongly implied that (at since
Khrushchev during the height of the Cuban crisis offered to
withdi’aw all offensive missiles from Cuba in exchange for a
similar withdrawal by the United States in Turkey, Bxitain, and
Italy; (b) since Walter Lippman’s ex-idol, Adlai Stevenson,
urged such a trade; (c) since the United States six weeks later
has decided to abandon such bases in favor of the “inferior”
Polaris: thei’efoi’e, such “crass Stevensonian appeasement” has
actually taken place.
Such logical analysis is supplemented by an attack upon
the ability and integrity of Px-esident Kennedy. Mr. Weinig
argues that since there have been some inconsistencies in Mr.
Kennedy’s statements regarding Soviet military might in Cuba
(a question which the CIA has yet to resolve conclusively*
therefore Mr. Kennedy is either untruthful or “simply doesn’t
know what he is talking about.” 1 fail to see the validity or the
relevancy of such a deduction.
An objective appraisal of the decision to remove missiles
from European bases will point out the impotency of Mr. Wei
nig’s argument. The crux of the enth'e issue is that from a mili
tary standpoint the submarine-launched Polaris missile is vastly
superior to exposed Thor and Jupiter IRBMs, Assuming that
the United States will never initiate a nuclear holocaust, then it
must be admitted that European-based IRBM’s are of no military
value, since a surprise attack would destroy them on the launch
ing pads. Such a condition does not exist in the case of the Po
laris. Furthermore, in test flights the Polaris' has proven at
least as accurate, as well as having a 500-mile range advantage
in its latest model.
Therefore, in view of the far gi’eater militaxy value of the
Polaris, the decision by President Kennedy and Secretary of De
fense McNamara to dismantle our European bases can hardly
be placed in the appeasement category. Had such appeasement
transpired, Premier wquld have proudly broadcast
such a victory. Mao-Tse-Tung would have x’eceived fixe message
special delivery.

Many students here at Stanford have watched he walls of
tradition come tumbling down in the past few yeai’s. Some have
shed a tear or two, but most have been content to sit back and
observe the wheels of pi’ogress roll on in an attempt to satiate
her ravenous appetite.
The Row witnessed one of the initial steps of destruction,
and it won’t be long before most of these proud and willowly edi
fices have given up the ghost and oixly the echo of fabled tales of
heroic fi'at rats of old will resouxxd in their hallowed halls. Many
a heart will no longer feel a warm glow in the early morning
to know that KA wishes him a good morning.
The old I-Club was the next to fall, though, sad to say it
pi’obably would have come down of its own accord if a real Luft
der Freiheil weht. But (he next blow was almost more than any
mortal or Stanford beat could stand. The cellar. Yes, the cellar
that nourishing womb to which so many of us constantly re
turned. The umbilical cord has been irrevocably severed. It
was as if Pandora’s box had been opened and the Furies re
leased. The highly endeared and richly endowed walls of the
Art Board room and the Rally Com yielded to coats of paint.
Cactus Jack was uprooted. The Peace Caucus was admitted. And
liquor came close, but failed at the last moment (so that many
returned the old bottle to the closet.) Students finally awoke
from their lethargy and began to realize they could speak out
even if Mrs. Stanford did turn over in her grave. Then the
Twenties closed. And new the word is out that one of our very
founding stones is soon to topple. The Zete house is going and
the girls at Mirlo may have trouble getting to sleep at night
without the mellifluous refrains flooding hrough the air.
But it’s time to take a stand. One of our most cherished
ideals has been deal a lethal blow. About 22 years ago the origi
nal Peaches, the ATO Pig, first donned her laurel crown, en
tei'ed her winged chariot, and flew to the finish line of the
Gxeek Week x’aces. Many descendants have continued in the
path of their noble arxeestor. Not long ago, Peaches XX came
close to victory. Last year Peaches XXIII was attired in her
royal costume and like golden Aphrodite set many a Stanford
heart a-flutter. And now Peaches XXIII has been ignominously
robbed of the sweet fruits of victory. Despite the fact that two
eighty ATO warriors, who would have pleased even the heroic
Achilles, pxxlled her across the line in the swiftest time of all,
she has not received her laurel wreath. The Gods themselves
must have desh'ed her victory, if the speed of her chariot was
any indication, but now Peaches lies weeping in her pen because
of the injustice of men. How long will this heresy go on? How
long, oh, how long America? ! ! *

Many students here at Stanford have watched he walls of
tradition come tumbling down in the past few yeai’s. Some have
shed a tear or two, but most have been content to sit back and
observe the wheels of pi’ogress roll on in an attempt to satiate
her ravenous appetite.
The Row witnessed one of the initial steps of destruction,
and it won’t be long before most of these proud and willowly edi
fices have given up the ghost and oixly the echo of fabled tales of
heroic fi'at rats of old will resouxxd in their hallowed halls. Many
a heart will no longer feel a warm glow in the early morning
to know that KA wishes him a good morning.
The old I-Club was the next to fall, though, sad to say it
pi’obably would have come down of its own accord if a real Luft
der Freiheil weht. But (he next blow was almost more than any
mortal or Stanford beat could stand. The cellar. Yes, the cellar
that nourishing womb to which so many of us constantly re
turned. The umbilical cord has been irrevocably severed. It
was as if Pandora’s box had been opened and the Furies re
leased. The highly endeared and richly endowed walls of the
Art Board room and the Rally Com yielded to coats of paint.
Cactus Jack was uprooted. The Peace Caucus was admitted. And
liquor came close, but failed at the last moment (so that many
returned the old bottle to the closet.) Students finally awoke
from their lethargy and began to realize they could speak out
even if Mrs. Stanford did turn over in her grave. Then the
Twenties closed. And new the word is out that one of our very
founding stones is soon to topple. The Zete house is going and
the girls at Mirlo may have trouble getting to sleep at night
without the mellifluous refrains flooding hrough the air.
But it’s time to take a stand. One of our most cherished
ideals has been deal a lethal blow. About 22 years ago the origi
nal Peaches, the ATO Pig, first donned her laurel crown, en
tei'ed her winged chariot, and flew to the finish line of the
Gxeek Week x’aces. Many descendants have continued in the
path of their noble arxeestor. Not long ago, Peaches XX came
close to victory. Last year Peaches XXIII was attired in her
royal costume and like golden Aphrodite set many a Stanford
heart a-flutter. And now Peaches XXIII has been ignominously
robbed of the sweet fruits of victory. Despite the fact that two
eighty ATO warriors, who would have pleased even the heroic
Achilles, pxxlled her across the line in the swiftest time of all,
she has not received her laurel wreath. The Gods themselves
must have desh'ed her victory, if the speed of her chariot was
any indication, but now Peaches lies weeping in her pen because
of the injustice of men. How long will this heresy go on? How
long, oh, how long America? ! ! *

Many students here at Stanford have watched he walls of
tradition come tumbling down in the past few yeai’s. Some have
shed a tear or two, but most have been content to sit back and
observe the wheels of pi’ogress roll on in an attempt to satiate
her ravenous appetite.
The Row witnessed one of the initial steps of destruction,
and it won’t be long before most of these proud and willowly edi
fices have given up the ghost and oixly the echo of fabled tales of
heroic fi'at rats of old will resouxxd in their hallowed halls. Many
a heart will no longer feel a warm glow in the early morning
to know that KA wishes him a good morning.
The old I-Club was the next to fall, though, sad to say it
pi’obably would have come down of its own accord if a real Luft
der Freiheil weht. But (he next blow was almost more than any
mortal or Stanford beat could stand. The cellar. Yes, the cellar
that nourishing womb to which so many of us constantly re
turned. The umbilical cord has been irrevocably severed. It
was as if Pandora’s box had been opened and the Furies re
leased. The highly endeared and richly endowed walls of the
Art Board room and the Rally Com yielded to coats of paint.
Cactus Jack was uprooted. The Peace Caucus was admitted. And
liquor came close, but failed at the last moment (so that many
returned the old bottle to the closet.) Students finally awoke
from their lethargy and began to realize they could speak out
even if Mrs. Stanford did turn over in her grave. Then the
Twenties closed. And new the word is out that one of our very
founding stones is soon to topple. The Zete house is going and
the girls at Mirlo may have trouble getting to sleep at night
without the mellifluous refrains flooding hrough the air.
But it’s time to take a stand. One of our most cherished
ideals has been deal a lethal blow. About 22 years ago the origi
nal Peaches, the ATO Pig, first donned her laurel crown, en
tei'ed her winged chariot, and flew to the finish line of the
Gxeek Week x’aces. Many descendants have continued in the
path of their noble arxeestor. Not long ago, Peaches XX came
close to victory. Last year Peaches XXIII was attired in her
royal costume and like golden Aphrodite set many a Stanford
heart a-flutter. And now Peaches XXIII has been ignominously
robbed of the sweet fruits of victory. Despite the fact that two
eighty ATO warriors, who would have pleased even the heroic
Achilles, pxxlled her across the line in the swiftest time of all,
she has not received her laurel wreath. The Gods themselves
must have desh'ed her victory, if the speed of her chariot was
any indication, but now Peaches lies weeping in her pen because
of the injustice of men. How long will this heresy go on? How
long, oh, how long America? ! ! *

If Mr. Weinig would employ his political acumen in a ration
al manner rather than utilize it in behalf of “rightist” mud-sling
ing, he might then begin to render the appearance of an informed
political scientist. Mr. Weinig has strongly implied that (at since
Khrushchev during the height of the Cuban crisis offered to
withdi’aw all offensive missiles from Cuba in exchange for a
similar withdrawal by the United States in Turkey, Bxitain, and
Italy; (b) since Walter Lippman’s ex-idol, Adlai Stevenson,
urged such a trade; (c) since the United States six weeks later
has decided to abandon such bases in favor of the “inferior”
Polaris: thei’efoi’e, such “crass Stevensonian appeasement” has
actually taken place.
Such logical analysis is supplemented by an attack upon
the ability and integrity of Px-esident Kennedy. Mr. Weinig
argues that since there have been some inconsistencies in Mr.
Kennedy’s statements regarding Soviet military might in Cuba
(a question which the CIA has yet to resolve conclusively*
therefore Mr. Kennedy is either untruthful or “simply doesn’t
know what he is talking about.” 1 fail to see the validity or the
relevancy of such a deduction.
An objective appraisal of the decision to remove missiles
from European bases will point out the impotency of Mr. Wei
nig’s argument. The crux of the enth'e issue is that from a mili
tary standpoint the submarine-launched Polaris missile is vastly
superior to exposed Thor and Jupiter IRBMs, Assuming that
the United States will never initiate a nuclear holocaust, then it
must be admitted that European-based IRBM’s are of no military
value, since a surprise attack would destroy them on the launch
ing pads. Such a condition does not exist in the case of the Po
laris. Furthermore, in test flights the Polaris' has proven at
least as accurate, as well as having a 500-mile range advantage
in its latest model.
Therefore, in view of the far gi’eater militaxy value of the
Polaris, the decision by President Kennedy and Secretary of De
fense McNamara to dismantle our European bases can hardly
be placed in the appeasement category. Had such appeasement
transpired, Premier wquld have proudly broadcast
such a victory. Mao-Tse-Tung would have x’eceived fixe message
