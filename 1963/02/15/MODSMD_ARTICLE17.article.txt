## 'On the Cuban Question Today' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
In the past week, the adminis
tration has gone to extraordinary
lengths to win the country’s con
fidence in the reliability of its in
formation about the military sit
uation in Cuba. Since the October
confrontation, there can, of
course, be no lack of confidence
in the President’s courage and
determination to protect Ameri
can Interests once the facts of a
threat are established.

The crisis of confidence origi
nates in what happened in the six
weeks before the October con
frontation. During the month of
September and into October, the
administration was insisting that
the Soviet Union had not brought
offensive weapons into Cuba.
Senator Keating was insisting
that they had. When he was
found to have been right, there
occured a loss of confidence in
the administration’s intelligence

services which it is still strug
gling to repair.
With others, I have had first
hand experience which enables
me to understand how difficult it
is to restore confidence once it
has been shaken. On two occa
sions it was explained to me by
high officials how reliable was
our photographic surveillance of
the island and how certainly wc
could detect the exact nature of
the weapons being installed in
Cuba. These private explanations
came after the President had
said categorically in his press
conference of Sept. 13 that “these
new shipments do not constitute
a serious throat to any other part
of the hemisphere.” Some two
weeks later, on Oct. 3, the under
secretary of state, Mr. Ball, gave
to a congressional committee a
summary of the intelligence in
formation which came from the
CIA. The point of the summary
was that theie were no offensive
weapons in Cuba.
But in fact there wore. A week
later, on Oct. 10, Senator Keating
insisted that there were interme
diate range missiles in Cuba, and
five days later the President re
ceived the photographs which
confirmed the charge.
This should put an end to the
unseemly controversy about who
is telling the truth between a
senator of the United States and
the President of the United
States. But I am not sure it will
repair altogether the damage
done to public confidence by the
misleading information given out
in September and October. The
administration may well have
also to make a full explanation
of what wont wrong in Septem
ber and early October.

Examining the remarkable in
telligence briefing by Mr. John
Hughes of the Defense Depart
ment, I find myself quite con
vinced that our photographic in
telligence is now reliable. But I
am struck by the fact that there
was a blank space in Mr. Hughes’
testimony for the period from
Sept. 5 to Oct. 14.

Photographs taken on Aug. 29
of the San Cristobal area and on
Sept. 3 at Sagua La Grande show
positively that no missile sites
had boon built. The next photo
graph referred to by Mr. Hughes
is that of Oct. 14. It shows inter
mediate range missile sites being
erected. This is the photograph
which precipitated the interna
tional crisis.

Where, we are bound to ask,
was our photographic intelligence
between Sept. 5 and Oct. 14? That
was when the administration was
telling the country that there
were no offensive weapons in
Cuba. This is the source of the
infection which will have to be
removed if full confidence is to
be restored.

Having said this, I would say
that there is no reason to doubt
the thoroughness or the reliabili
ty of our photographic surveil
lance of Cuba and of the sea
around it. The situation is extra
ordinary. Wo arc repending on
being able to fly daily photo
graphic reconnaissance planes at
high and low altitude. In Cuba,
there arc a large number of the
latest anti-aircraft weapons man
ned by Soviet soldiers.

We may say, how come? Up to
the present—knock on wood—the
Soviet anti-aircraft gunners arc
not attacking our reconnaisance
pianos. They must bo under or
ders from Moscow, where it is
well-known that if the planes
were attacked there would be an
immediate reprisal.

What we have now is a substi
tute for (he original agreement.
We are able to carry on photo
graphic reconnaissance without
interference from the Soviet anti
aircraft weapons. And Cuba is
getting, in lieu of a United States’
guarantee against invasion, a
build up of its defensive capabili
ties. Both Moscow and Washing
ton know that this strange work
ing arrangement cannot be upset
deliberately without bringing on
a much mightier confrontation
than that of last October.

In the past week, the adminis
tration has gone to extraordinary
lengths to win the country’s con
fidence in the reliability of its in
formation about the military sit
uation in Cuba. Since the October
confrontation, there can, of
course, be no lack of confidence
in the President’s courage and
determination to protect Ameri
can Interests once the facts of a
threat are established.

The crisis of confidence origi
nates in what happened in the six
weeks before the October con
frontation. During the month of
September and into October, the
administration was insisting that
the Soviet Union had not brought
offensive weapons into Cuba.
Senator Keating was insisting
that they had. When he was
found to have been right, there
occured a loss of confidence in
the administration’s intelligence

services which it is still strug
gling to repair.
With others, I have had first
hand experience which enables
me to understand how difficult it
is to restore confidence once it
has been shaken. On two occa
sions it was explained to me by
high officials how reliable was
our photographic surveillance of
the island and how certainly wc
could detect the exact nature of
the weapons being installed in
Cuba. These private explanations
came after the President had
said categorically in his press
conference of Sept. 13 that “these
new shipments do not constitute
a serious throat to any other part
of the hemisphere.” Some two
weeks later, on Oct. 3, the under
secretary of state, Mr. Ball, gave
to a congressional committee a
summary of the intelligence in
formation which came from the
CIA. The point of the summary
was that theie were no offensive
weapons in Cuba.
But in fact there wore. A week
later, on Oct. 10, Senator Keating
insisted that there were interme
diate range missiles in Cuba, and
five days later the President re
ceived the photographs which
confirmed the charge.
This should put an end to the
unseemly controversy about who
is telling the truth between a
senator of the United States and
the President of the United
States. But I am not sure it will
repair altogether the damage
done to public confidence by the
misleading information given out
in September and October. The
administration may well have
also to make a full explanation
of what wont wrong in Septem
ber and early October.

Examining the remarkable in
telligence briefing by Mr. John
Hughes of the Defense Depart
ment, I find myself quite con
vinced that our photographic in
telligence is now reliable. But I
am struck by the fact that there
was a blank space in Mr. Hughes’
testimony for the period from
Sept. 5 to Oct. 14.

Photographs taken on Aug. 29
of the San Cristobal area and on
Sept. 3 at Sagua La Grande show
positively that no missile sites
had boon built. The next photo
graph referred to by Mr. Hughes
is that of Oct. 14. It shows inter
mediate range missile sites being
erected. This is the photograph
which precipitated the interna
tional crisis.

Where, we are bound to ask,
was our photographic intelligence
between Sept. 5 and Oct. 14? That
was when the administration was
telling the country that there
were no offensive weapons in
Cuba. This is the source of the
infection which will have to be
removed if full confidence is to
be restored.

Having said this, I would say
that there is no reason to doubt
the thoroughness or the reliabili
ty of our photographic surveil
lance of Cuba and of the sea
around it. The situation is extra
ordinary. Wo arc repending on

vinced that our photographic in
telligence is now reliable. But I
am struck by the fact that there
was a blank space in Mr. Hughes’
testimony for the period from
Sept. 5 to Oct. 14.

Photographs taken on Aug. 29
of the San Cristobal area and on
Sept. 3 at Sagua La Grande show
positively that no missile sites
had boon built. The next photo
graph referred to by Mr. Hughes
is that of Oct. 14. It shows inter
mediate range missile sites being
erected. This is the photograph
which precipitated the interna
tional crisis.

Where, we are bound to ask,
was our photographic intelligence
between Sept. 5 and Oct. 14? That
was when the administration was
telling the country that there
were no offensive weapons in
Cuba. This is the source of the
infection which will have to be
removed if full confidence is to
be restored.

Having said this, I would say
that there is no reason to doubt
the thoroughness or the reliabili
ty of our photographic surveil
lance of Cuba and of the sea
around it. The situation is extra
ordinary. Wo arc repending on
being able to fly daily photo
graphic reconnaissance planes at
high and low altitude. In Cuba,
there arc a large number of the
latest anti-aircraft weapons man
ned by Soviet soldiers.

We may say, how come? Up to
the present—knock on wood—the
Soviet anti-aircraft gunners arc
not attacking our reconnaisance
pianos. They must bo under or
ders from Moscow, where it is
well-known that if the planes
were attacked there would be an
immediate reprisal.

What we have now is a substi
tute for (he original agreement.
We are able to carry on photo
graphic reconnaissance without
interference from the Soviet anti
aircraft weapons. And Cuba is
getting, in lieu of a United States’
guarantee against invasion, a
build up of its defensive capabili
ties. Both Moscow and Washing
ton know that this strange work
ing arrangement cannot be upset
deliberately without bringing on
a much mightier confrontation
than that of last October.

In the past week, the adminis
tration has gone to extraordinary
lengths to win the country’s con
fidence in the reliability of its in
formation about the military sit
uation in Cuba. Since the October
confrontation, there can, of
course, be no lack of confidence
in the President’s courage and
determination to protect Ameri
can Interests once the facts of a
threat are established.

The crisis of confidence origi
nates in what happened in the six
weeks before the October con
frontation. During the month of
September and into October, the
administration was insisting that
the Soviet Union had not brought
offensive weapons into Cuba.
Senator Keating was insisting
that they had. When he was
found to have been right, there
occured a loss of confidence in
the administration’s intelligence

services which it is still strug
gling to repair.
With others, I have had first
hand experience which enables
me to understand how difficult it
is to restore confidence once it
has been shaken. On two occa
sions it was explained to me by
high officials how reliable was
our photographic surveillance of
the island and how certainly wc
could detect the exact nature of
the weapons being installed in
Cuba. These private explanations
came after the President had
said categorically in his press
conference of Sept. 13 that “these
new shipments do not constitute
a serious throat to any other part
of the hemisphere.” Some two
weeks later, on Oct. 3, the under
secretary of state, Mr. Ball, gave
to a congressional committee a
summary of the intelligence in
formation which came from the
CIA. The point of the summary
was that theie were no offensive
weapons in Cuba.
But in fact there wore. A week
later, on Oct. 10, Senator Keating
insisted that there were interme
diate range missiles in Cuba, and
five days later the President re
ceived the photographs which
confirmed the charge.
This should put an end to the
unseemly controversy about who
is telling the truth between a
senator of the United States and
the President of the United
States. But I am not sure it will
repair altogether the damage
done to public confidence by the
misleading information given out
in September and October. The
administration may well have
also to make a full explanation
of what wont wrong in Septem
ber and early October.

Examining the remarkable in
telligence briefing by Mr. John
Hughes of the Defense Depart
ment, I find myself quite con
vinced that our photographic in
telligence is now reliable. But I
am struck by the fact that there
was a blank space in Mr. Hughes’
