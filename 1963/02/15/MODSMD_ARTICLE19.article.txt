Editors, The Daily;
As the Anglo-Saxons of the
world grope toward an under
standing of De Gaulle’s policy for
the new Europe, a cursory glance |
at the Continental press would !
show them that De Gaulle has all i
sorts of friends and that his poli
cy quite transcends all considera
tions of politics and economics. |
Every civilization of the past has
presented as its champion that j
nation which has contributed j
most largely to it. If France were j
to accept as permanent the situa
tion now prevailing in the West,
she would not he France. For it
is in France, and nowhere else,
that Western civilizatoin has
made its avatar. And if De Gaulle
sets his aspirations high, he does
so in the spirit of Aristotle’s
great-souled man, “who claims
much, for he deserves much.” Do
Gaulle, Adenauer and Fanfani
are all men in whom the Western
tradition is a living, vibrant thing,
not just another pious platitude
to charm one’s allies with. Could
the most fervent supporters of
Kennedy, Macmillan and Diefen
baker claim as much for - them?

It is to be hoped that the An
glo-Saxon nations do not, in their
chagrin, force De Gaulle’s hand
and make him choose between
NATO and a rapprochement with
Eastern Europe. The result might
bo surprising.
