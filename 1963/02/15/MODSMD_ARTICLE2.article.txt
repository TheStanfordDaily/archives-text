# Legislature Defers Vote Over Anarchist Caucus
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
The approval of the Anarchist I
Caucus proposed by Political Un
ion was deferred by LASSU at a !
party-meeting at Armin Rosen-j
cranz’s last night.
Measures passed were the con
stitutions of the Stern Inter-
House Council and the Stanford I
Village family council, and the j
expansion of the business and!
advertising departments of The!
Daily.
ASSU President Armin Rosen
cranz, dressed for the occasion
in tuxedo and black tie with a j
valentine taped on his back, ad-1
dressed the body of fifteen mem-!
bers. nine of whom were substi
tutes. His report included a let
ter from Senator Dodd stating
that documents would soon bo re
leased on the KPFA case. Rosen
cranz also stressed the unofficial,
nature of Tuesday’s ad hoc meet- i
ing of the full legislature. The j
scratch sheet, he stated, will be j
published on February 28. and S
will sell for fifty cents a copy.
His address was punctuated by
blasts from the saxophone of the
twist band warming up in the
next room.
Also discussed was the contro
versy over printing of liquor ads
in The Daily. On Wednesday, the 1
Dean’s office unofficially stated 1
that this would be against Uni-1
versify policy. It was decided to !
wait for the official statement to [
come from the Dean Monday. )
The Anarchist Caucus, to be j
voted on next week, was proposed i
to fill the need for critical discus-1
sion of political theories in terms
of the conditions in which they
exist. Its members do not advo
cate anarchy itself, but rather the
constructive criticism of prescrip
tive legislation in terms of its
conformity with existing politi
cal conditions.
