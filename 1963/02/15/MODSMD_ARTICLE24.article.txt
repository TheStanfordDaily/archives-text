# YOUTH TO WIN OUT
## Racehorse Rugby Is Indians' Strategy Against Olympic Club 
### BEN TIPTON 
Stanford’s rugby squad meets
the Olympic Club of San Francis
co in a return match tomorrow.
The game will be played on the
Stanfoid rugby field at three.
The junior varsity squad will
play consecutive games beginning
at 1:30 with the Cal Aggies and
wilh the Olympic Club “A” team.
Both of those games will also be
at Stanford.

"Olympic Club should be im
proved.” said Stanford ocach
Pete Kmetovic. ‘‘They have two
more games under their bolt
since we played them last.” Stan
ford defeated the Olympians in
the opening game of the season
for both teams. The Indians won
that one in the second half, scor
ing easily and repeatedly on their
tired opponents in the final min
utes.

STANFORD will again try to
force the game into the open, ac
cording to Kmetovic. “Our con
ditioning is better. These club
teams are all experienced, but
their backs are getting old and
they just can’t run as fast as they
used to. We’ll try to run them to
death,” said the Card mentor.

The Cards will be out to pre
vent a repeat of their only loss of
the season, a 13-6 defeat at the
hands of Universities Club, a
team the Indians had beaten the
week before. It was a team of
“old, experienced” players who
did it that time.

The only Stanford player not
scheduled to see action is Steve
Thurlow, who pulled a muscle
while running in the Greek Week
chariot races Tuesday.

GOOD NEWS for Stanford is
the almost complete mending of
Gordon Waddell’s injured knee.
The ex-Scottish Internationals
star’s kicking was instrumental
in last week’s rain-splashed 25-3
conquest of the Peninsula Ram
blers. Steve VanNort and Dick
Ragsdale, both recent promotions
from the junior varsity who play
ed well last week, will start
against Olympic Club.
Kmelovic said he was satisfied
with the improvement shown in
the Stanford lineout play, per
haps the weakest aspect of the
Card’s game. “We’ll try to get the
ball in a little farther, to get it
to Waddell faster,” he said. “He
fakes very well in there, and can

draw in the breaks on the de
fense.”
SOME BAD NEWS for the
Cards is the addition of Stan
Lindskog to the Olympic squad.
Lindskog is not registered as a
student this quarter, and so is
not eligible to play for the In
dians. His good left foot could be
a big help to the Olympians.
“We’re hoping that he doesn’t
get too many chances at penalty
kicks from close in.” as Kmeto
vic put it. “That could cost us
some points.”

"Olympic Club should be im
proved.” said Stanford ocach
Pete Kmetovic. ‘‘They have two
more games under their bolt
since we played them last.” Stan
ford defeated the Olympians in
the opening game of the season
for both teams. The Indians won
that one in the second half, scor
ing easily and repeatedly on their
tired opponents in the final min
utes.

STANFORD will again try to
force the game into the open, ac
cording to Kmetovic. “Our con
ditioning is better. These club
teams are all experienced, but
their backs are getting old and
they just can’t run as fast as they
used to. We’ll try to run them to
death,” said the Card mentor.

The Cards will be out to pre
vent a repeat of their only loss of
the season, a 13-6 defeat at the
hands of Universities Club, a
team the Indians had beaten the
week before. It was a team of
“old, experienced” players who
did it that time.

The only Stanford player not
scheduled to see action is Steve
Thurlow, who pulled a muscle
while running in the Greek Week
chariot races Tuesday.

GOOD NEWS for Stanford is
the almost complete mending of
Gordon Waddell’s injured knee.
The ex-Scottish Internationals
star’s kicking was instrumental
in last week’s rain-splashed 25-3
conquest of the Peninsula Ram
blers. Steve VanNort and Dick
Ragsdale, both recent promotions
from the junior varsity who play
ed well last week, will start
against Olympic Club.
Kmelovic said he was satisfied
with the improvement shown in
the Stanford lineout play, per
haps the weakest aspect of the
Card’s game. “We’ll try to get the
ball in a little farther, to get it
to Waddell faster,” he said. “He
fakes very well in there, and can

draw in the breaks on the de
fense.”
SOME BAD NEWS for the
Cards is the addition of Stan
Lindskog to the Olympic squad.
Lindskog is not registered as a
student this quarter, and so is
not eligible to play for the In
dians. His good left foot could be
a big help to the Olympians.
“We’re hoping that he doesn’t
get too many chances at penalty
kicks from close in.” as Kmeto
vic put it. “That could cost us
some points.”
