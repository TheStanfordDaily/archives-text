## Gymnasts Take Four Firsts But Lose; Face Unbeaten California Tonight 
### 
By DAVID NYBERO
Even though Stanford’s gym
nasts won four first places and
tied for a fifth one in the seven
event meet with San Francisco
State last night, a painful lack of
depth prohibitively reduced the
Indians’ chance for victory. San
Francisco State’s well-balanced
team piled up fil V-> points to Stan
ford’s 48' 2.
There is little doubt that the
absence of Roger Rhoads, in bed
with a severe case of strep throat,
cost the Tribe their first seasonal
victory. Rhoads was scheduled in
all seven events. It is remarkable
that with only six men competing
(each school is expected to enter
three men in each of the seven
events), coach Ruff’s team came
so near winning. Obviously Stan
ford gymnasts are rich in versa
tility as well as the endurance
and competitive will that is so
vitally important in any athletic
competition. It would do well to
credit this team with a personal
triumph although the numerical
score indicates that they lost.
ALAN MIYAMOTO (side horse
and parallel bars) and Russ Bur
mister thigh bar and still rings)
were both double winners for
Stanford. Miyamoto earned 13
points while Burmister and Bill
Rusher worked for 12 each. Rush
er placed in four events, including
a tie for first in the long horse.
Tonight the luckless Indians
face one of the strongest teams
in the nation when they travel to
the Harmon Gym in Berkeley.
California has six performers
who are rated no less than 17th
nationally. Sophomore Paul New
man heads this spectacular pa
rade with a No. 4 rating on the
parallel bars, while Dave Beer
nink has earned the No. 5 spot on
the side horse.
The Bears have been undefeat
ed in their last four years of dual
and trianguler meets (a total of
35). They tied Southern Califor

nia, the eventual National colle
giate champions, for first place
in the AAWU championship meet
last year.
