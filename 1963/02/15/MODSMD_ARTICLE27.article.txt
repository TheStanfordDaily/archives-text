# Dodgers Win a Crucial To Open 1962 Season
## 
### 
In a game which compares to
a race between Ray Norton and
a quadruple amputee for unfair
ness, the Los Angeles Dodgers
All-Stars beat USCâ€™s baseball
team, 22-5, on Wednesday. It was
the first game of the year for
both teams.
For the Dodgers, it was a sig
nificant step in their long come
back after unceremoniously blow
ing the National League pennant
in 1962; it uncategorically pro
claimed the Dodgers professional
champions of L.A. County.
