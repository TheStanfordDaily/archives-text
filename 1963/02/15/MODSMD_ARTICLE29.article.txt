# Papooses to Meet Tough Competition In Cal Freshmen
## 
### PETE KING Sports Editor 
Stanford’s freshman basketball
team, fresh off its best weekend
series of the season, meets arch
rival Cal in a pair of games to
night and tomorrow night that
shoidd serve as a true indicator
of the caliber of ball the Papooses
are capable of playing. Both
games will precede the varsity
games and start at 6:10 p.m.
Thus far the frosh have had a
good year, winning seven of 10
games. However, they have lost
to their only tough opposition,
Cal, USF, and San Jose State,
with their victories being mostly
lopsided affairs over minor loams
such as Menlo College and Treas
ure Island Naval Base,
THKIK inconsistency can be
attributed partly to the fact that
6-9 center Raj’ Kosanke did not
play the first six games, and only
last week reached peak form
against San Jose State, scoring
30 points.
In losing to Cal 61-!50 last
month, the frosh blew a 12-point
first half lead, then fell behind in
the second half on numerous ball
control errors, poor shooting, and
equally poor rebounding.
But with Kosanke’s height and
scoring power now added, and
with the 46 per cent shooting of
last weekend, the Papooses should
he able to beat the Bear yearlings.
The duel between Kosanke and
Cal’s high - scoring center Dick
Vortmann should be an interest
ing one.
STANFORD has won the series
with the Bear frosh for the past
three years, although it took an
overtime win and an 18-point
second half comeback to do it
last year.
Forward Ceorge Maentz, who
scratched an eyeball in the San
Jose Stale game, will be out for
two weeks.
