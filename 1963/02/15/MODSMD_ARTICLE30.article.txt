# Hinkley Replaces Sutherland For Stanford-Cal Weekend Set
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The Stanford basketball team,
minus Darrell Sutherland, takes
on a bunch of Cal Bears fighting
for their- lives in the AAWU twice
this weekend. The two teams meet
tonight in the Pavilion and tomor
row in Cal’s Harmon Gym, with
both games starting at 8 p.m.
The loss of Sutherland is de
pressing, especially since he ap
peared to have shaken a season
long slump with seven buckets
in the all-important Stanford vic
tory over UCLA last Saturday,
Sutherland was injured when he
drove through the middle of the
UCLA team and scored on a lay
up. The UCLA players converged
toward the basket for a possible
rebound and Bruin forward Jack
Hirsch hit the reed-thin Stanford
guard blindside, causing him to
tumble.
The result was a hairline frac
ture of the big bone in his lower
arm. Sutherland now has a cast
covering the arm from the wrist
to elbow that will stay on till next
Wednesday, so he definitely is
out of both Cal games. He may
miss next week’s home UCLA
game. X-rays on Wednesday will
determine if he can face the
Bruins.
STANFORD COACH Howie
Dallmar plans to start Kent
Hinckley in Sutherland’s place
this weekend. Hinckley, a late
blooming sophomore junior col
lege transfer, has been Stanford’s
leading marksman of late. He has
his 52 per cent of his shots all
season, and in AAWU play he
leads the Cards with 48 per cent.
Otherwise, the same men will
start who have started all year.
The other guard will be Don Cle
metson, the center will be Tom
Dose, and the forwards will be
chosen from among Bob Som
mers, Hollis Moore and Clayton
Raaka.
Clemetson has been the leading
Stanford playmaker this season,
and he has had to provide most
of (he outside scoring until Hinck
ley was given a chance and made
good. No defensive press has been

totally effective against Stanford |
this year, and Clemetson’s fancy
dribbling and ball-handling have
been responsible for that.

Behind Clemetson and Hinck
ley will be 5-9 Lew Shupe, the for
gotten hero of Stanford’s double
overtime win at Cal on January 8.
Shupe scored 16 points that night,
hitting six of seven from the field.
DOSE moved into the lead in
AAWU rebounding with a pair
of good board games last week
end. He now has an average of
11 per game, after hauling down
31 against USC and UCLA. He is
third in Big Six scoring with an
18.8 average. Clemetson is ninth
with 13.2.
The best bets to start at for
ward are Sommers and Moore,
but Raaka could break into the
starting lineup as he did against
UCLA. Sommers improved h i s
stock with a nine-point perform
ance against the Bruins after
playing almost not at all against
SC. He also gave Dose valuable
help with the rebounding. Moore,
though always a rugged defender,
hasn’t been scoring at the rate
hoped for by Dallmar. The Stan
ford Coach hoped Moore would
be consistent at 10 points per
game. So far he has averaged six.
Raaka is Stanford’s second lead
ing rebounder, but has had trou
ble hitting from the outside. How
ever he has good moves when
close to the basket.

CAL will send 10 good men
against Stanford, led by guard
Dick Smith and center' Camden
Wall. Smith has averaged 14.2
points in six AAWU contests.
Wall is close behind at 13.8, and
he is second to Dose in rebound
ing, with 10.5 per game.
Other Cal starters are likely to
be forwards Don Lauer and Chris
Carpenter and guard Bruce Ball
mer. However some changes
could be made. Carpenter and
Ballmer have been starting all
year, but their time is running
out. Dan Wolthers and Denny
Lewis are ready to move up, and
this weekend might be the time.
Other top Cal bench strength in

eludes forward Jim Smith, center
Bob Wueste and guard Dan Luf
kin.
ONE FACTOR working for
Stanford this weekend is the pos
sible absence from the sideline of
Cal Coach Rene Herrerias. He has
been in the hospital with an in
fected gall bladder. While interim
coach Bob Blake has held forth.
Cal has lost three of four, includ
ing a pair to Washington in Ed-

munclson Pavilion, Seattle, cer
tainly no disgrace, and one to
Oregon they should have had in
their hip pocket.
It Herrerias isn’t on hand, Cal
will he hurting regardless of how
well the Bears are scoring. Of
such breaks, games are won.

TWO GUARDS who have been moving up rapidly in the Indian and Bear basketball hierarchies
respectively are Kent Hinkley (left) and Denny Lewis. Hinkley, a sophomore, replaces the injured
Darrell Sutherland tonight after hitting 11 of 24 shots last weekend, Lewis, an outstanding passer
and playmaker and a first-stringer the latter half of last year, missed Cal's first 14 games due to
scholastic inadequacy. He rejoined the team this semester and has been fighting for the spot along
side Dick Smith.

and playmaker and a first-stringer the latter half of last year, missed Cal's first 14 games due to
scholastic inadequacy. He rejoined the team this semester and has been fighting for the spot along
side Dick Smith.

The Stanford basketball team,
minus Darrell Sutherland, takes
on a bunch of Cal Bears fighting
for their- lives in the AAWU twice
this weekend. The two teams meet
tonight in the Pavilion and tomor
row in Cal’s Harmon Gym, with
both games starting at 8 p.m.
The loss of Sutherland is de
pressing, especially since he ap
peared to have shaken a season
long slump with seven buckets
in the all-important Stanford vic
tory over UCLA last Saturday,
Sutherland was injured when he
drove through the middle of the
UCLA team and scored on a lay
up. The UCLA players converged
toward the basket for a possible
rebound and Bruin forward Jack
Hirsch hit the reed-thin Stanford
guard blindside, causing him to
tumble.
The result was a hairline frac
ture of the big bone in his lower
arm. Sutherland now has a cast
covering the arm from the wrist
to elbow that will stay on till next
Wednesday, so he definitely is
out of both Cal games. He may
miss next week’s home UCLA
game. X-rays on Wednesday will
determine if he can face the
Bruins.
STANFORD COACH Howie
Dallmar plans to start Kent
Hinckley in Sutherland’s place
this weekend. Hinckley, a late
blooming sophomore junior col
lege transfer, has been Stanford’s
leading marksman of late. He has
his 52 per cent of his shots all
season, and in AAWU play he
leads the Cards with 48 per cent.
Otherwise, the same men will
start who have started all year.
The other guard will be Don Cle
metson, the center will be Tom
Dose, and the forwards will be
chosen from among Bob Som
mers, Hollis Moore and Clayton
Raaka.
Clemetson has been the leading
Stanford playmaker this season,
and he has had to provide most
of (he outside scoring until Hinck
ley was given a chance and made
good. No defensive press has been

totally effective against Stanford |
this year, and Clemetson’s fancy
dribbling and ball-handling have
been responsible for that.

Behind Clemetson and Hinck
ley will be 5-9 Lew Shupe, the for
gotten hero of Stanford’s double
overtime win at Cal on January 8.
Shupe scored 16 points that night,
hitting six of seven from the field.
DOSE moved into the lead in
AAWU rebounding with a pair
of good board games last week
end. He now has an average of
11 per game, after hauling down
31 against USC and UCLA. He is
third in Big Six scoring with an
18.8 average. Clemetson is ninth
with 13.2.
The best bets to start at for
ward are Sommers and Moore,
but Raaka could break into the
starting lineup as he did against
UCLA. Sommers improved h i s
stock with a nine-point perform
ance against the Bruins after
playing almost not at all against
SC. He also gave Dose valuable
help with the rebounding. Moore,
though always a rugged defender,
hasn’t been scoring at the rate
hoped for by Dallmar. The Stan
ford Coach hoped Moore would
be consistent at 10 points per
game. So far he has averaged six.
Raaka is Stanford’s second lead
ing rebounder, but has had trou
ble hitting from the outside. How
ever he has good moves when
close to the basket.

CAL will send 10 good men
against Stanford, led by guard
Dick Smith and center' Camden
Wall. Smith has averaged 14.2
points in six AAWU contests.
Wall is close behind at 13.8, and
he is second to Dose in rebound
ing, with 10.5 per game.
Other Cal starters are likely to
be forwards Don Lauer and Chris
Carpenter and guard Bruce Ball
mer. However some changes
could be made. Carpenter and
Ballmer have been starting all
year, but their time is running
out. Dan Wolthers and Denny
Lewis are ready to move up, and
this weekend might be the time.
Other top Cal bench strength in

eludes forward Jim Smith, center
Bob Wueste and guard Dan Luf
kin.
ONE FACTOR working for
Stanford this weekend is the pos
sible absence from the sideline of
Cal Coach Rene Herrerias. He has
been in the hospital with an in
fected gall bladder. While interim
coach Bob Blake has held forth.
Cal has lost three of four, includ
ing a pair to Washington in Ed-

munclson Pavilion, Seattle, cer
tainly no disgrace, and one to
Oregon they should have had in
their hip pocket.
It Herrerias isn’t on hand, Cal
will he hurting regardless of how
well the Bears are scoring. Of
such breaks, games are won.

respectively are Kent Hinkley (left) and Denny Lewis. Hinkley, a sophomore, replaces the injured
Darrell Sutherland tonight after hitting 11 of 24 shots last weekend, Lewis, an outstanding passer
and playmaker and a first-stringer the latter half of last year, missed Cal's first 14 games due to
scholastic inadequacy. He rejoined the team this semester and has been fighting for the spot along
side Dick Smith.

The Stanford basketball team,
minus Darrell Sutherland, takes
on a bunch of Cal Bears fighting
for their- lives in the AAWU twice
this weekend. The two teams meet
tonight in the Pavilion and tomor
row in Cal’s Harmon Gym, with
both games starting at 8 p.m.
The loss of Sutherland is de
pressing, especially since he ap
peared to have shaken a season
long slump with seven buckets
in the all-important Stanford vic
tory over UCLA last Saturday,
Sutherland was injured when he
drove through the middle of the
UCLA team and scored on a lay
up. The UCLA players converged
toward the basket for a possible
rebound and Bruin forward Jack
Hirsch hit the reed-thin Stanford
guard blindside, causing him to
tumble.
The result was a hairline frac
ture of the big bone in his lower
arm. Sutherland now has a cast
covering the arm from the wrist
to elbow that will stay on till next
Wednesday, so he definitely is
out of both Cal games. He may
miss next week’s home UCLA
game. X-rays on Wednesday will
determine if he can face the
Bruins.
STANFORD COACH Howie
Dallmar plans to start Kent
Hinckley in Sutherland’s place
this weekend. Hinckley, a late
blooming sophomore junior col
lege transfer, has been Stanford’s
leading marksman of late. He has
his 52 per cent of his shots all
season, and in AAWU play he
leads the Cards with 48 per cent.
Otherwise, the same men will
start who have started all year.
The other guard will be Don Cle
metson, the center will be Tom
Dose, and the forwards will be
chosen from among Bob Som
mers, Hollis Moore and Clayton
Raaka.
Clemetson has been the leading
Stanford playmaker this season,
and he has had to provide most
of (he outside scoring until Hinck
ley was given a chance and made
good. No defensive press has been

totally effective against Stanford |
this year, and Clemetson’s fancy
dribbling and ball-handling have
been responsible for that.

Behind Clemetson and Hinck
ley will be 5-9 Lew Shupe, the for
gotten hero of Stanford’s double
overtime win at Cal on January 8.
Shupe scored 16 points that night,
hitting six of seven from the field.
DOSE moved into the lead in
AAWU rebounding with a pair
of good board games last week
end. He now has an average of
11 per game, after hauling down
31 against USC and UCLA. He is
third in Big Six scoring with an
18.8 average. Clemetson is ninth
with 13.2.
The best bets to start at for
ward are Sommers and Moore,
but Raaka could break into the
starting lineup as he did against
UCLA. Sommers improved h i s
stock with a nine-point perform
ance against the Bruins after
playing almost not at all against
SC. He also gave Dose valuable
help with the rebounding. Moore,
though always a rugged defender,
hasn’t been scoring at the rate
hoped for by Dallmar. The Stan
ford Coach hoped Moore would
be consistent at 10 points per
game. So far he has averaged six.
Raaka is Stanford’s second lead
ing rebounder, but has had trou
ble hitting from the outside. How
ever he has good moves when
close to the basket.

CAL will send 10 good men
against Stanford, led by guard
Dick Smith and center' Camden
Wall. Smith has averaged 14.2
points in six AAWU contests.
Wall is close behind at 13.8, and
he is second to Dose in rebound
ing, with 10.5 per game.
Other Cal starters are likely to
be forwards Don Lauer and Chris
Carpenter and guard Bruce Ball
mer. However some changes
could be made. Carpenter and
Ballmer have been starting all
year, but their time is running
out. Dan Wolthers and Denny
Lewis are ready to move up, and
this weekend might be the time.
Other top Cal bench strength in

eludes forward Jim Smith, center
Bob Wueste and guard Dan Luf
kin.
ONE FACTOR working for
Stanford this weekend is the pos
sible absence from the sideline of
Cal Coach Rene Herrerias. He has
been in the hospital with an in
fected gall bladder. While interim
coach Bob Blake has held forth.
Cal has lost three of four, includ
ing a pair to Washington in Ed-

munclson Pavilion, Seattle, cer
tainly no disgrace, and one to
Oregon they should have had in
their hip pocket.
It Herrerias isn’t on hand, Cal
will he hurting regardless of how
well the Bears are scoring. Of
such breaks, games are won.
