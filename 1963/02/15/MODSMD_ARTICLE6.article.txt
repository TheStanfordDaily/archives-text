# Roszak: No Peace Under Government
## 
### NORMAN GREENBERG 
The throat of war, the pressing
j dangers of population and the
| dizzying turns of the economy
j manifest the fallacies of the ex
isting world societies and govern
| ments. Dr. Theodore Roszak.
j speaking last night before the
I Peace Caucus of the Political Un
| ion on the “Politics of Peace,”
stated that the social relations
I between human beings are natur
j ally regulated for the betterment
I of all. The disorder lies within
government, he said; its form
| alone is not malign, neither is its
| direction, but its very existence
is.
For government, he insists, lies
above the body politic, an “ab
stract power.” Since its existence
is illegitimate, then it is forced
to strive for the end of self-pres-
I ervation. Thus, the function of
government is to concentrate
power, which is “limitless and
purposeless," and it can only jus
tify its existence upon the threats
of other, similarly purposeless,
states. International tensions are
subsequently inevitable, Roszak
said, regardless of economical or
ideological consideration.
Having established the conten
j tibn that the extant governmental
I bureaucracies are inimical to the
I causes of peace and social har
{ mony, Roszak concluded that it is
vain to fight within this frame
j work for paece; lobbying, peti
tioning, office seeking, and adver
tising are all inefficacious. He
offered no simple or short-range
I solution to the present problems
j but suggested the establishment
of small communities, similar to
the utopian communities of the
past.
