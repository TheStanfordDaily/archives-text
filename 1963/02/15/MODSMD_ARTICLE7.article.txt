# KZSU Policy Strives for Diversity
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
Weekend programming, begun recently by
KZSU, and changes in the types of programs dur
ing the week are both part of KZSU’s policy of
offering a format which will appeal to diverse
groups throughout the campus.
The station’s schedule has offered jazz, news,
folk music, humor, and sports; in addition, KZSU
grogrammers are now planning to increase the
number of programs of more vital interest to the
Stanford community. “We’re trying to orient our
programming to the needs of the campus more
than it has been in the past, with our broadcasts
of such programs as the Tuesday Evening Series
and the Noon Musicalo,’’ said Ken Byram, station
manager.
A step in this direction is the Stanford Forum
series at 8;30 on Monday nights, which presents
an analysis of a major issue at Stanford including
interviews with those on each side of the ques
tion. Put together with commentary and back
ground, the Forum tries to draw out unexpressed
viewpoints as well. The grading system, housing,
and sectarian religious activities on campus have
already been topics for discussion.
the MUSIC DEPARTMENT is also being ex
panded. "Music of Sweden,’’ for example, is a
taped series broadcast in half-hour segments on
Sunday nights. The' selections range from very
ancient to very modern.
Beginning this Sunday. KZSU will broadcast
the Sunday services from Memorial Church. Jazz
is featured exclusively on Saturday except when
basketball game coverage or another special
event pre-empts it.
KZSU’s main problem is the limited broadcast
ing range. The station operates on a “carrier”
current system, which means it has chosen a spot
on the AM band and has registered with the Fed
eral Communications Commission. It is not ]j
censed, however, and thus is not authorized to

\ broadcast over the air. The station broadcasts not
into antennas, as most other stations do, but into
power lines, with the aid of transmitters located
in most' of the major dorms, with smaller trans
mitters in fraternities and Row houses. Off-cam
pus students and faculty homes cannot be reached.

he able to broadcast on an FM channel soon. FM
is static-free and reaches farther. A license for an
I’M educational channel can be obtained from the
FCC. but educational FM does not carry adver
tising. Since KZSU's finances are completely de
pendent upon advertising, the station would have
to keep its AM channel in operation. This is one
reason for the expanded weekend programming.
Byram said that there might also be difficulty
in securing the University’s permission. Since an
FM transmitter would enable KZSU to increase
its broadcasting range to about a 25-mile radius,
the administration would probably require much
stricter control over the programming, at elast
at the beginning, ho said. KZSU is now entirely
student-run, though it is under nominal control
by the communications department. Were this
control increased, the spontanlety and the rela
tive freedom in programming would perhaps be
decreased.
KZSU HAS BKKN broadcasting since 1946
when it was established by a group of war veter
ans returned to school who were interested in
radio. The station was located in Stanford Village
until 1948, when it was moved to its present loca
tion in the basement of Memorial Auditorium.
According to Prof. Stanley T. Dormer, faculty
advisor for KZSU, "KZSU has always had its ups
and downs” (including a period during the year
of 1958-59 when it went off the air, having been
found to be broadcasting with so much power
that it was picked up in Daly City.) “This has
been one of the best seasons the station has ver
had.”
