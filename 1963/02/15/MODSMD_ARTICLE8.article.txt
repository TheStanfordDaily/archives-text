# Two Law School Deans Discuss Legal Careers
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR 
"A legal career holds out tremendous opportunities,” Professor
John R. McDonough, Jr„ Acting Dean of the Law School, told
students yesterday. Participating in a series sponsored by Stan
ford I oday and Tomorrow, McDonough and Associate Dean Wil
liam T. Keogh answered the questions of over 75 Stanford under-

graduates interested in legal ca-t
reers.
“Our civilization is based on an
underlying network of legal or
der,” McDonough continued.
"This framework is established
and operated by lawyers in all
Phases of society.” Thus the le
gal profession offers one of its
members a “position of consider
able respect,” a chance to con
tribute to society, positions of in

♦
fluence as public servant, and the
opportunity “just to make money,
if that is his interest."
In discussing the goals of a
law school McDonough empha
sized the importance of acquiring
a broad, general legal education.
For the first two years the course
of study is completely prescribed.
The Socratic method of critical
analysis, as opposed to the lecture
system, is used to inculcate “anal
ysis, sythesis, and expression” in
to students. The idea is to teach
students “to think like lawyers,”
and ‘‘to reason a problem
through all its implications to a
solution.”
ASSOCIATE Dean Keough
spoke of the standards for admis
sion. The Stanford Law School
emphasizes, in order of impor
tance, the undergraduate record,
law school entrance exams, per
sonal recommendations by facul
ty of undergraduate schools, and
extra-curricular activities.
A “solid liberal education”
with emphasis on economics,
English composition, history and
political science is the ideal pre
law course, according to McDon
ough, but there is no discrimina
tion in admission policy against
science and engineering majors.
IN RESPONSE to questions of
students, the following facts were
brought out: the Law School has
openings for only 150 of its 1000
yearly applicants; scholarships
and loans support a substantial
number of students; there is no
limit on the number of women
admitted; and 85 per cent of the
graduates of (ho Stanford Law
School pass the California State
Bar Exam on the first try.
McDonough announced that
James Halman, Dean of Students
of the University of Chicago, will
be visiting Stanford today to dis
cuss (lie University of Chicago
School of Law. Those interested
in personal interviews should
contact the Political Science De
partment. Halman will appear in
the Board Room of the Bowman
Alumni House at 2:30 this after
noon.
