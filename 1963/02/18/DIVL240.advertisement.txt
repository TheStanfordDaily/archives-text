INDIANS
A mid-February Mon
day seems like an
appropriate time to
square things away,
like the score, on and
oft campus. Part of
the score, as we’re
sure you realize, is
the satisfaction and
comfort of an appro
priate wardrobe. Lack
the ready green you
say? Be reminded of
Roos Atkins’ very
understanding Super/
Charge plan, with
which you can pur
chase what you need,
when you need it,
now, and repay on
modest 10% per
month installments.
Your reg. card does it.
