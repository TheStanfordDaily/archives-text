Your Divine Invitation

*«r
Miracles proved Jesus to be the
Christ and divine. His word affected
natures laws, time, space, life, death
and established faith and love in the
hearts of men. Our democratic prin
ciples are the result of his elevation
of the individual as a responsible be
ing before God and Man. His mes
sage and invitation are as contem
porary now as when first spoken.
He invites you to be in his family,
kingdom, and church. Family suggests
relationship and the principles of life
that motivate and limit one s activity.
Church suggests that his people have
been "called out" of sin to live in
conformity to eternal values.
Jesus said, "He that believeth
and is baptized (immersed) shall be
saved. 1 Mk.16:16.
