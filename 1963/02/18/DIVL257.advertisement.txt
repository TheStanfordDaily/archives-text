The hounds of spring are on winter’s traces. Soon buds the
crocus, soon trills the giant condor, soon come the new spring
fashions to adorn our lissome limbs.
And what will the American college student wear this spring?
Gather round, you rascals, and light a Marlboro Cigarette and
enjoy that fine mellow tobacco, that pure white filter, and
possess your souls in sweet content, and listen.
As everyone knows, campus fashions have always been casual.
This spring, however, they have gone beyond being merely
casual: they have become makeshift.
The object is to look madly improvised, gaily spur-of-the
moment ! For example, why don’t you girls try wearing a
peasant skirt with a dinner jacket? Or matador pants with a
bridal veil? Or Bermuda shorts with bronze breastplates? Be
rakish! Be impromptu! Be devil-take-the-hindmost!
And, men, you be the same. Try an opera cape with sweat
pants. Or a letter-sweater with kilts. Or a strait jacket with
hip boots. Be bold! Be daring! Be a tourist attraction!

But all is not innovation in college fashions this spring. In
fact, one of the highlights of the season turns time backward in
its flight. I refer, of course, to the comeback of the powdered
wig.
This charming accoutrement, too long neglected, has already
caught on with in undergrads everywhere. On hundreds of
campuses the bossa nova is giving way to the minuet, and
patriotic undergraduates are dumping British tea into the
nearest harbor. This, as you may imagine, does not sit well with
King George 111 who, according to reliable reports, has been
stamping his foot and uttering curses not fit to reproduce in
this family newspaper. For that matter, a lot of our own people
are steamed up too, and there has even been some talk about the
American colonies declaring their independence of England.
But I hardly think it will come to that. I mean, how can we
break with the mother country when we are dependent on her
for so many things—linsey-woolsey, Minif; balls, taper snuffers,
and like that? She, on the other hand, relies on us for turkeys,
Marlboro Cigarettes, and Route 6<5. So I say, if Molly Pitcher
and those other Radcliffe hotheads will calm down, and if
gentlemen will cry “Peace! Peace!” we may yet find an
amicable solution to our differences. But let not our British
cousins mistake this willingness to negotiate for weakness. If
fight we must, then fight we will! Paul Revere is saddled up,
the rude bridge arches the flood, and the ROTC is armed!
But I digress. We were smoking Marlboro Cigarettes—O,
splendid cigarette! O, good golden tobaccos! O, pristine pure
white filter! O, fresh! O, tasty! 0, soft pack! O, flip top box!
O, get some!—we were, I say, smuking Marlboros and talking
about spring fashions.
Let us turn now to the season’s most striking new feature—
pneumatic underdrawers. These inflatable garments make every
chair an easy chair. Think how welcome they will be when you
sit through a long lecture! They are not, however, without
certain dangers. Last week, for example, Rimbaud Sigafoos, a
sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh, fell out of a 96th
story window in the Tower of Learning. Thanks to his pneu
matic underdrawers, he suffered no injury when he struck the
sidewalk, but the poor fellow is still bouncing—his seventh
consecutive day—and it is feared that he will starve to death.
