# Indians Flop on Friday, 61-60, But Find Range Saturday, 68-58
## Cal 61, Stanford 60 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Don Clcmetson, who plays like
an All-American when in the
Stanford Pavilion, and Tom Dose,
who plays like an All-American
no matter whom the game is con
tested, did their host, but their in
dividually fine performances
couldn’t overcome a fine Califor
nia team effort, and the Golden
Bears bopped Stanford 61-60 Fri
day night.

It was a 12-foot jump shot by
Cal center Camden Wall with 28
seconds remaining in the game
that sent Stanford down to defeat.
The game was in the tradition of
recent Stanford Friday night
games. The Indians have lost
throe of their last four games in
the Pavilion, and after all these
losses came back to play fine ball
in a winning Saturday effort.

DOSK AND Clemetson account
ed for 43 of Stanford’s 60 points.
Dose had 24 and Clemetson 19,
while Wall was high for the Bears
with 20. Dose led the rebounders
with 15, continuing his confer
ence-leading pace. Wall and Don
Lauer topped the Bears with nine
apiece, as Cal out-rebounded the
Indians 45-40.

Stanford had its best night of
the year on the charity stripe,
making 18 of 21, while Cal blew
11 of 20. Dose was largely respon
sible for the high Card free-throw
mark, hitting 12 of 14 shots.
Whenever he got the ball, three
men swarmed him and one invari
ably committed a foul. This ac
counted for Dose’s low field goal
percentage. He made only six of
19 shots.

Clemetson popped away from
the outside and spoiled Cal’s
press. He also did a fine defensive
job on Cal’s high-scoring guard
Dick Smith, holding him to 13
points.

STANFORD was hampered by
Darrell Sutherland’s absence from
the court. Kent Hinckley, who
took his place in the starting line
up, obviously wasn’t used to work
ing against a press such as the
full-court press employed by Cal.
and Stanford fell behind 9-1 in
the early minutes.

Stanford got its first lead at
21-20, after Low Shupe got hot
with two long jumpers and Cle
metson scored on a layin. How
ever Cal came back to lead 34-32
at the half as Dan Lufkin, Jim
Smith, Dan Wolthers, and Wall
all hit a pair of buckets.
The Indians started quickly in
the second half, as Dose made
three quick scores. Eventually
they stretched the margin to 56-51
on the strength of Clemetson’s
five straight points.
CAL CUT the lead to a single
point at 57-58, and went ahead
with 3:16 remaining on Wall’s
hook shot. The Indians came back
and took a 60-59 lead as Dose
made both ends of a 1-1 foul with
only 44 second remaining.
Cal called time out, set up a
shot for Wall, and he hit a fall
away jumper to give Cal the win.
Stanford had time to set up a
play, and fed the ball to Dose, but
he was bumped by his own man,
and a jump ball resulted. Dose
controlled the tip, but a Bear
snatched it away and that was the
game.
