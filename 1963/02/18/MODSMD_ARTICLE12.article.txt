# Survey of Class Government Needed
## 
### 
The University of California at Berkeley has become in
volved in a conflict over the utility of class governments.
President of the Freshman Class Boh Lander has resigned
from his office and has attacked class government .as “having
no goal, no purpose and no claim to existence.”
Lander, whose last semester grades fell below the 2.0 point
average required by the Cal administration for retention of
student office, said that the class governments were “sand that
clutters the wheels of government at Cal.” He wrote in The
Daily Californian: “I cannot work for something that I no
longer believe in and will he unable to change to benefit the
students at the University of California.”
Unfortunately, the issue at Cal has become clouded by a
great deal of dirty politics and name calling. However, the
problem of justifying the existence of class governments is
important not only at Berkeley but at Stanford as well.
A proposal to abolish class government at Stanford was
presented to LASSU last November. Caught in the middle of
Rally Com scandals and a new constitution, the motion about
the class governments was tangled in the red tape of the By-
Laws Committee, and never returned.

The problems involved, however, are still worth investi
gation. Are class governments serving a definite and useful
purpose, or are they a waste of student time and thought?
The class governments do serve a certain social function.
They sponsor dances, reunions, and other such events. For
example the Sophomore Class held an extremely successful
hostel at the beginning of this quarter.
Perhaps many of these functions could be better executed
by other existing associations of the ASSU. On the other
hand, perhaps the existing framework of class government
could be used by other ASSU agencies for matters which
require a wide sampling of student opinion.
L ASSU should take the time for a long and careful look
at class governments before the spring elections. Either a
large number of energetic and interested people are being
wasted in organizations that are worth nothing, or the or
ganizations can be utilized in a more beneficial and meaning
ful manner.
