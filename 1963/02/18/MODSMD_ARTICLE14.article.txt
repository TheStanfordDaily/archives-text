# PLAY REVIEW
## One Acts Skillful Production' 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
The irio of comedies presented hy 1963 Winter One-Acts
offers a variety of fare and in the main a quite skillful produc
tion.

“Where’s There’s a Will, There’s a Play,” an Elizabethan farce
written and directed by Dave Kirk, has a liberal technical
endowment. Bill Eddelman’s set and costumes immediately set
the tone of the Mermaid Tavern. Dave Kirk as Richard Burbage,
Robert Leppo as mine host Polonius, and Pauline Peotter as the
tavern wench Juliet throw themselves into the action with a rol
licking attack. But the audience’s response, apparently much
colder than expected, deflated in the cast a certain flambouyant
confidence required by the Shakespearian lines.
The cast did not fully recover until the middle of the play,
when the minor characters faded into the walls and tho focus
shifted to the three play-critics and their victim. Tom Tully bal
anced his part well as a solid Ben Johnson, and Richard D.
Smith interacts with him as an adequate Francis Bacon. Frank
lin Leib does not fully actuate the farcical possibilities of Chris
Marlowe; but Tim Burkett is an appropriate scapegoat as the
naive Horatio. Although Bruce Salvatore, who stars in all three
plays, did his least best in the Kirk farce, his Will Shakespeare
is adequate to the action. Despite the minor fallings-off caused
by first-night shock, the farce was well-done and should get
better once the cast learns to lake the audience’s immediate
response less seriously.

Brad Efron’s “Lion in the Living Room,” directed by Robin
Brown, profits by Ben Abercrombie’s detailed sets but is flat
tened by Peter Young’s lighting. Realistic bathroom lighting is
bound to be flat; but a little unobtrusive spotlighting might
have lent variety to a play which, despite many excellent ex
changes of wit, tends to be homogeneous.
Henry Ernstthal as Father James creates a convincing
monolith; Judy Holmes is equally appropriate as the obsessive
Mother James. Bruce Salvatore as cross-kissing, Bible-reading
Grandfather James, punctuates the main action well, chiming in
like a recurring motif. Hunter Lynn as Baby Bobbie is a good
child actor. Randy Hoey as younger brother Harold James
evokes the sympathy we need to feel for the only sane person
in the bathroom.
Jim Maine as James James, the cynical, myopic, and cruel
older brother who spends his time in the bathtub is over-obvious
at times; but at his best he is horrific. On the author's part,
however, James James seems an ill-conceived character. He is
the bridge by which a difficult transition from brittle comedy
to total tragedy is made, and playwright Efron ought to have
put more thought into his development. Such a change would
undoubtedly highlight the fast-moving and often quite clever
dialogue which now seems to lack a certain inevitability.
The true laurels, however, must go to “Phormio,” a Roman
comedy by Terence, directed by Steve Gilborn. Daniel Arnaud’s
translation should go a long way toward removing the supposi
tion that Roman comedy need be dull or remote. The translation
might have been cut a little; but its length is relieved in pro
duction by lively and expressive business. Victor Emeljanow as
Phormio strode the boards with a firm Shakespearean manner;
his tendency to steal scenes may be excused by the finesse with
which he steals them. Professors Charles Beye and James Ker
ans as Demipho and Chremes fill out their parts admirably, Beye
by august senatorial bluster and Kerans by some remarkable
underplaying. Bruce Salvatore as Geta, Demipho’s slave, brings
forth a resilient, many-faceted performance. Fred Watkins and
Ron Roberts as Antipho and Phaedria, sons of Demiphos and
Chremes, have a command of stage business, although they
would greatly diminish the difficulties of following the plot if
their characters were more clearly differentiated
Robin Brown as Dorio the slave dealer is notable for the
tone of implacable grimness which he injects into the action; it
provides a sort of “tragic relief” from a lot of slapstick. Nelda
Hackett as Nausitrata provides a thoroughly disagreeable wife
for Chremes. Susan Leich is good as Sophrona, an old crony of
a nurse; so are Stephen S. Lawry, Dave Kirk, and Lawrence
Madison as Demipho’s three counselors, Lawrence Madison also
doubling well as the slave Davus,
The costumes are bright and Roman-looking, the scenery is
compact and monumental, and the blue sky cast on the half
cyclorama behind lends a mellowness to the whole setting.
Winter One-Acts will continue Thursday, Friday, and Satur
day of this week.

lin Leib does not fully actuate the farcical possibilities of Chris
Marlowe; but Tim Burkett is an appropriate scapegoat as the
naive Horatio. Although Bruce Salvatore, who stars in all three
plays, did his least best in the Kirk farce, his Will Shakespeare
is adequate to the action. Despite the minor fallings-off caused
by first-night shock, the farce was well-done and should get
better once the cast learns to lake the audience’s immediate
response less seriously.

Brad Efron’s “Lion in the Living Room,” directed by Robin
Brown, profits by Ben Abercrombie’s detailed sets but is flat
tened by Peter Young’s lighting. Realistic bathroom lighting is
bound to be flat; but a little unobtrusive spotlighting might
have lent variety to a play which, despite many excellent ex
changes of wit, tends to be homogeneous.
Henry Ernstthal as Father James creates a convincing
monolith; Judy Holmes is equally appropriate as the obsessive
Mother James. Bruce Salvatore as cross-kissing, Bible-reading
Grandfather James, punctuates the main action well, chiming in
like a recurring motif. Hunter Lynn as Baby Bobbie is a good
child actor. Randy Hoey as younger brother Harold James
evokes the sympathy we need to feel for the only sane person
in the bathroom.
Jim Maine as James James, the cynical, myopic, and cruel
older brother who spends his time in the bathtub is over-obvious
at times; but at his best he is horrific. On the author's part,
however, James James seems an ill-conceived character. He is
the bridge by which a difficult transition from brittle comedy
to total tragedy is made, and playwright Efron ought to have
put more thought into his development. Such a change would
undoubtedly highlight the fast-moving and often quite clever
dialogue which now seems to lack a certain inevitability.
The true laurels, however, must go to “Phormio,” a Roman
comedy by Terence, directed by Steve Gilborn. Daniel Arnaud’s
translation should go a long way toward removing the supposi
tion that Roman comedy need be dull or remote. The translation
might have been cut a little; but its length is relieved in pro
duction by lively and expressive business. Victor Emeljanow as
Phormio strode the boards with a firm Shakespearean manner;
his tendency to steal scenes may be excused by the finesse with
which he steals them. Professors Charles Beye and James Ker
ans as Demipho and Chremes fill out their parts admirably, Beye
by august senatorial bluster and Kerans by some remarkable
underplaying. Bruce Salvatore as Geta, Demipho’s slave, brings
forth a resilient, many-faceted performance. Fred Watkins and
Ron Roberts as Antipho and Phaedria, sons of Demiphos and
Chremes, have a command of stage business, although they
would greatly diminish the difficulties of following the plot if
their characters were more clearly differentiated
Robin Brown as Dorio the slave dealer is notable for the
tone of implacable grimness which he injects into the action; it
provides a sort of “tragic relief” from a lot of slapstick. Nelda
Hackett as Nausitrata provides a thoroughly disagreeable wife
for Chremes. Susan Leich is good as Sophrona, an old crony of
a nurse; so are Stephen S. Lawry, Dave Kirk, and Lawrence
Madison as Demipho’s three counselors, Lawrence Madison also
doubling well as the slave Davus,
The costumes are bright and Roman-looking, the scenery is
compact and monumental, and the blue sky cast on the half
cyclorama behind lends a mellowness to the whole setting.
Winter One-Acts will continue Thursday, Friday, and Satur
day of this week.
The irio of comedies presented hy 1963 Winter One-Acts
offers a variety of fare and in the main a quite skillful produc
tion.

“Where’s There’s a Will, There’s a Play,” an Elizabethan farce
written and directed by Dave Kirk, has a liberal technical
endowment. Bill Eddelman’s set and costumes immediately set
the tone of the Mermaid Tavern. Dave Kirk as Richard Burbage,
Robert Leppo as mine host Polonius, and Pauline Peotter as the
tavern wench Juliet throw themselves into the action with a rol
licking attack. But the audience’s response, apparently much
colder than expected, deflated in the cast a certain flambouyant
confidence required by the Shakespearian lines.
The cast did not fully recover until the middle of the play,
when the minor characters faded into the walls and tho focus
shifted to the three play-critics and their victim. Tom Tully bal
anced his part well as a solid Ben Johnson, and Richard D.
Smith interacts with him as an adequate Francis Bacon. Frank

like a recurring motif. Hunter Lynn as Baby Bobbie is a good
child actor. Randy Hoey as younger brother Harold James
evokes the sympathy we need to feel for the only sane person
in the bathroom.
Jim Maine as James James, the cynical, myopic, and cruel
older brother who spends his time in the bathtub is over-obvious
at times; but at his best he is horrific. On the author's part,
however, James James seems an ill-conceived character. He is
the bridge by which a difficult transition from brittle comedy
to total tragedy is made, and playwright Efron ought to have
put more thought into his development. Such a change would
undoubtedly highlight the fast-moving and often quite clever
dialogue which now seems to lack a certain inevitability.
The true laurels, however, must go to “Phormio,” a Roman
comedy by Terence, directed by Steve Gilborn. Daniel Arnaud’s
translation should go a long way toward removing the supposi
tion that Roman comedy need be dull or remote. The translation
might have been cut a little; but its length is relieved in pro
duction by lively and expressive business. Victor Emeljanow as
Phormio strode the boards with a firm Shakespearean manner;
his tendency to steal scenes may be excused by the finesse with
which he steals them. Professors Charles Beye and James Ker
ans as Demipho and Chremes fill out their parts admirably, Beye
by august senatorial bluster and Kerans by some remarkable
underplaying. Bruce Salvatore as Geta, Demipho’s slave, brings
forth a resilient, many-faceted performance. Fred Watkins and
Ron Roberts as Antipho and Phaedria, sons of Demiphos and
Chremes, have a command of stage business, although they
would greatly diminish the difficulties of following the plot if
their characters were more clearly differentiated
Robin Brown as Dorio the slave dealer is notable for the
tone of implacable grimness which he injects into the action; it
provides a sort of “tragic relief” from a lot of slapstick. Nelda
Hackett as Nausitrata provides a thoroughly disagreeable wife
for Chremes. Susan Leich is good as Sophrona, an old crony of
a nurse; so are Stephen S. Lawry, Dave Kirk, and Lawrence
Madison as Demipho’s three counselors, Lawrence Madison also
doubling well as the slave Davus,
The costumes are bright and Roman-looking, the scenery is
compact and monumental, and the blue sky cast on the half
cyclorama behind lends a mellowness to the whole setting.
Winter One-Acts will continue Thursday, Friday, and Satur
day of this week.
The irio of comedies presented hy 1963 Winter One-Acts
offers a variety of fare and in the main a quite skillful produc
tion.

“Where’s There’s a Will, There’s a Play,” an Elizabethan farce
written and directed by Dave Kirk, has a liberal technical
endowment. Bill Eddelman’s set and costumes immediately set
the tone of the Mermaid Tavern. Dave Kirk as Richard Burbage,
Robert Leppo as mine host Polonius, and Pauline Peotter as the
tavern wench Juliet throw themselves into the action with a rol
licking attack. But the audience’s response, apparently much
colder than expected, deflated in the cast a certain flambouyant
confidence required by the Shakespearian lines.
The cast did not fully recover until the middle of the play,
when the minor characters faded into the walls and tho focus
shifted to the three play-critics and their victim. Tom Tully bal
anced his part well as a solid Ben Johnson, and Richard D.
Smith interacts with him as an adequate Francis Bacon. Frank
lin Leib does not fully actuate the farcical possibilities of Chris
Marlowe; but Tim Burkett is an appropriate scapegoat as the
naive Horatio. Although Bruce Salvatore, who stars in all three
plays, did his least best in the Kirk farce, his Will Shakespeare
is adequate to the action. Despite the minor fallings-off caused
by first-night shock, the farce was well-done and should get
better once the cast learns to lake the audience’s immediate
response less seriously.

Brad Efron’s “Lion in the Living Room,” directed by Robin
Brown, profits by Ben Abercrombie’s detailed sets but is flat
tened by Peter Young’s lighting. Realistic bathroom lighting is
bound to be flat; but a little unobtrusive spotlighting might
have lent variety to a play which, despite many excellent ex
changes of wit, tends to be homogeneous.
Henry Ernstthal as Father James creates a convincing
monolith; Judy Holmes is equally appropriate as the obsessive
Mother James. Bruce Salvatore as cross-kissing, Bible-reading
Grandfather James, punctuates the main action well, chiming in
like a recurring motif. Hunter Lynn as Baby Bobbie is a good
child actor. Randy Hoey as younger brother Harold James
evokes the sympathy we need to feel for the only sane person
in the bathroom.
