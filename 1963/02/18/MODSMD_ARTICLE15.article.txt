# CONCERT REVIEW
## Violinist Shapiro Called Admirable' 
### WALTER MOORE 
One of the greatest delights afforded the chronie concert
goer is the occasional “discovery” of an artist previously un
known to him. Such was undoubtedly the experience of many
who attended the violin recital by Eunice Shapiro at Memorial
Auditorium last week. Miss Shapiro’s appearance on campus
was the second event of the ASSU concert series this season;
she took the place of the scheduled Joseph Fuchs who was ill.
By any criteria an outstanding artist, Miss Shapiro brings
to the concert stage a winsome personality and musical equip
ment which anyone might admire. Her violinigtic assets include
a beautiful singing tone, an all'encompassihg technique, and. a
keen intelligence which can command and control the strongest
colors and most subtle shadings of string sound. From the Ro
mantic eccentricities of an Ysaye Sonata to the Divertimento
from “Le Baiser de la Fee” of Stravinsky, Miss Shapiro is mis
tress of her instrument, and projects with unmistakable con
viction and insight the character of each movement and piece.
The Stravinsky suite was indeed the high point of the program.
It was played with great virtuosity, rhythmic vitality and a
profound awareness of its wit and lyricism.
Lest it he imagined that Miss Shapiro is less at home in the
classics, it is a pleasure to note that her performance of the
great C minor sonata, Op. 30, No. 2 of Beethoven was magnifi
cently conceived and projected on a grand scale. In this, as in
the rest of the program, she was more than ably partnered by
Brooks Smith, an accompanist of uncommon solidity and artistic
merit. He contributed much to an evening notable for the warm
and dignified presentation of great music.
