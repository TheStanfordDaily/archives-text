Editors, The Daily:
Mr. Weinig’s “shady deal” article in last Tuesday’s Daily
needs clarification. He attempted to establish a link “a bit more
than coincidental,” with carefully selected facts, that since the
Kennedy Administration wants to remove certain missiles from
bases in England, Italy and Turkey, it is possible that a secret,
“shady deal” was made last fall with Mr. Khrushchev.
Withdrawing the missiles is in line with long-standing,
widely-known programs. British Defense Minister Peter Thorney
croft announced in the House of Commons August 2, 1962, that
U.S. Thor missiles would be withdrawn from Britain “in the
course of a year,” to be replaced by more modern British medi
um-range missiles. The U.S. attempted to persuade Turkey to
give up its NATO Jupiter base more than a year ago. Last May
the U.S. offered five Polaris submarines for NATO control, with
the promise of more to come.
Mr. Weinig claimed that the missiles to be withdrawn—the
Thors and Jupiters—are “hard-cased, first-strike” weapons. In
fact, they are extremely vulnerable, stored above ground, and
require a long 15-minute countdown. Both are old, the Jupiter
being little more than an enlarged German V 2.
Mr. Weinig hoped that Robert S. McNamara will be more
successful than “his greatest venture while president of the
Ford Company: ... the Edsel.”
Mr. McNamara was named head of Ford in November 1960
and Defense Secretary a month later. Edsel production ceased
in November 1959. When the Edsel was conceived in 1955 Mc-
Namara was head of the rival Ford division. The ill-fated car
was dumped while McNamara was group vice-president for
all Ford car and truck divisions.
Perhaps Mr. Weinig himself may be characterized by his
own phrase about the President: (Mr. Weinig) “has either been
telling bare-faced lies to his (readers); or he simply doesn’t
know what he is talking about a good deal of the time; or both.
I can envisage no other alternatives.”

give up its NATO Jupiter base more than a year ago. Last May
the U.S. offered five Polaris submarines for NATO control, with
the promise of more to come.
Mr. Weinig claimed that the missiles to be withdrawn—the
Thors and Jupiters—are “hard-cased, first-strike” weapons. In
fact, they are extremely vulnerable, stored above ground, and
require a long 15-minute countdown. Both are old, the Jupiter
being little more than an enlarged German V 2.
Mr. Weinig hoped that Robert S. McNamara will be more
successful than “his greatest venture while president of the
Ford Company: ... the Edsel.”
Mr. McNamara was named head of Ford in November 1960
and Defense Secretary a month later. Edsel production ceased
in November 1959. When the Edsel was conceived in 1955 Mc-
Namara was head of the rival Ford division. The ill-fated car
was dumped while McNamara was group vice-president for
all Ford car and truck divisions.
Perhaps Mr. Weinig himself may be characterized by his
own phrase about the President: (Mr. Weinig) “has either been
telling bare-faced lies to his (readers); or he simply doesn’t
know what he is talking about a good deal of the time; or both.
I can envisage no other alternatives.”
