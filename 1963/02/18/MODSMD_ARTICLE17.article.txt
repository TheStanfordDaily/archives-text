# Papooses' Scoring, Rebounding Fail in Two Loses to Cal Frosh
## 
### PETE KING Sports Editor 
A lacking scoring punch and re-
I bounding in the closing seconds
j cost the Stanford freshman has
! kctball team dearly last weekend,
1 and the Cal frosh beat them twice,
.■5O-48 and .5(5.52, to give the Bears

a swoop of their series with the
Papooses.
Forward Myron Erickson and
guards Robby Olson and Steve
Smith were the key men for Cal.
Erickson showed traces of great
ness in scoring 28 points and haul
ing down 28 rebounds for both
nights, while Smith and Olson
scored in double figures each
night and picked off crucial re
bounds in tite closing minutes.
CENTER Ray Kosanke vvas (he
only fairly consistent player for
Stanford, with 29 points and near
ly as many rebounds. lie did an
excellent defensive job on the
Bears' center, Dick Vortmann,
blocking many of his shots, ands
holding him to a mere seven bas
kets for both nights.

Stanford lost the games pri
marily because of its utter de
pendence on Kosanke’s scoring
ability. When the defense pre
vented lob passes to Kosanke, the
rest of the team took bad shots.
When he wasn’t scoring at all (no
baskets in the second half Friday
night), the frosh offense com
pletely collapsed. Usually high
scoring Bob Bedell and Skip
Hutchison hit only 19 of 58 shots.
RICH BAKER, replacing Ko
sanke, did a brilliant job on the
boards as the second half started.
He hit two buckets, one of them
on his fourth shot, after grabbing
his own rebound three times.
Hutchison then hit a couple of his
patented 20-foot jump shots, and
the Papooses pulled away to a
40-33 lead.
Then suddenly they fell apart.
Two jump shots by Vortmann and
a couple of ball-steal lay-ins by
Olson boosted Cal into a 44-40
lead, later increased to 48-42. Dur
ing this stretch Stanford went
scoreless for eight minutes, with
out a basket for 11 minutes. Stan
ford’s Werner Boettcher potted a
35-foot shot in the waning sec
onds to cut the final margin to
50-48.
Saturday, in Cal’s Harmon gym,
it was much the same story. The
frosh pulled away to a 15-6 lead,
then watched Erickson sink four
free throws and two baskets, and
the Cards held a shaky 22-21 lead.
The lead changed hands several
times, but key rebounds by Erick
son and Smith, along with three
Papoose ball control errors,
helped Cal ahead, 54-52, with 37
seconds remaining. Both teams
missed free throws, and an Erick
son lay-in iced it for the Bears.

Papooses.
Forward Myron Erickson and
guards Robby Olson and Steve
Smith were the key men for Cal.
Erickson showed traces of great
ness in scoring 28 points and haul
ing down 28 rebounds for both
nights, while Smith and Olson
scored in double figures each
night and picked off crucial re
bounds in tite closing minutes.
CENTER Ray Kosanke vvas (he
only fairly consistent player for
Stanford, with 29 points and near
ly as many rebounds. lie did an
excellent defensive job on the
Bears' center, Dick Vortmann,
blocking many of his shots, ands
holding him to a mere seven bas
kets for both nights.

Stanford lost the games pri
marily because of its utter de
pendence on Kosanke’s scoring
ability. When the defense pre
vented lob passes to Kosanke, the
rest of the team took bad shots.
When he wasn’t scoring at all (no
baskets in the second half Friday
night), the frosh offense com
pletely collapsed. Usually high
scoring Bob Bedell and Skip
Hutchison hit only 19 of 58 shots.
RICH BAKER, replacing Ko
sanke, did a brilliant job on the
boards as the second half started.
He hit two buckets, one of them
on his fourth shot, after grabbing
his own rebound three times.
Hutchison then hit a couple of his
patented 20-foot jump shots, and
the Papooses pulled away to a
40-33 lead.
Then suddenly they fell apart.
Two jump shots by Vortmann and
a couple of ball-steal lay-ins by
Olson boosted Cal into a 44-40
lead, later increased to 48-42. Dur
ing this stretch Stanford went
scoreless for eight minutes, with
out a basket for 11 minutes. Stan
ford’s Werner Boettcher potted a
35-foot shot in the waning sec
onds to cut the final margin to
50-48.
Saturday, in Cal’s Harmon gym,
it was much the same story. The
frosh pulled away to a 15-6 lead,
then watched Erickson sink four
free throws and two baskets, and
the Cards held a shaky 22-21 lead.
The lead changed hands several
times, but key rebounds by Erick
son and Smith, along with three
Papoose ball control errors,
helped Cal ahead, 54-52, with 37
seconds remaining. Both teams
missed free throws, and an Erick
son lay-in iced it for the Bears.
