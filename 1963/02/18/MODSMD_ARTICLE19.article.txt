# Switch in Offense Aids Tribe Attack

### ROGER MENDELSON 
For both halves of the game
Friday night and for the first half
Saturday night, Stanford was un
able to generate any consistent,
scoring against California. “Cal’s
defense was doing a great job of
keeping the ball way from our
forwards and sagging on (Tom)
Dose in the middle.” said coach
Howie Dallmar. “We can’t start
OMi! offense Uplcss up got thp
ball into fhe forwards Sides
where they can feed Dose.
“We changed the offense at
halftime on Saturday night,” he
continued. “One forward would
break out to the foul line and the
guards would take the ball in to
ward the corners, where they
could pass to Dose or to the for
ward if the Bears continued to
ignore him and sag on Dose.”
The strategy worked perfectly:
in the first nine minutes of the
half, Hollis Moore sank three
shots from outside and Dose got
four baskets inside and drew
three fouls as Stanford scored 23
points to open up a ten-point lead.
The Bear defense became over
anxious thereafter and lacked the
usuel discipline of a Rene Her
rerias-coached team; it committed
numerous unnecessary fouls and
allowed Stanford several easy lay
ins and wide-open floor shots.
