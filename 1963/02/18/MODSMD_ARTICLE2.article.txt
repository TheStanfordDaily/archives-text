Stanford’s Indians awoke in
time to throw their famed Satur
day punch at the California Bears
and regain the Big Six lead. Over
coming a three-point half-time
deficit, the Tribe stormed back to
take a convincing 68-58 win at the
Cal gym.
The victory, Stanford’s eighth
straight Saturday night win with
out a defeat this season, left their
conference record at five and
three. Washington lost at home
to USC and dropped behind the
Indians with a six and four mark.
STANFORD JUMPED to a five
to one lead, but in the process
Tom Dose gathered two quick
fouls. He then became cautious,
playing Cal center Camden Wall
more loosely, and Cal began to
dominate its offensive board,
scoring eight consecutive points.
Stanford tied the score at nine all
on Don Clemetson’s jump shot.
The lead changed hands through
out the first half, the two teams

finding themselves still dead
locked at 21-all with two-thirds
of the period gone.
At this point the Bears began
to pull away, relying on the shoot
ing of reserve guard Danny Luf
kin. Cal took a 27-23 lead, its
largest margin of the night, but
Dose scored throe quick points to
cut the advantage to 29-26 at the
half.
CAL OLTKKBOUNDKD Stan
ford in the first half, but as the
second period opened the Indians
gave indication that they planned
to repossess the boards. Dose
tapped in a two-pointer after two
previous tries had failed. After
Hollis Moore had hit a jump shot
to cut Cal’s precarious lead to
one point at 31-30, Dose hit an
other follow shot, and Stanford
had the lead for good.
Moments later co-captain Cle
metson. who has proved himself
to be better than any guard Stan
ford has faced this year, tallied
on a three-point play and gave the
Tribe a 38-33 lead. The Indians re
mained hot while Cal hit a cold
spell, failing to score from the
field for the first seven minutes
of the second half. Stanford mean
while had increased the gap to
45-34.
AFTER A time out, Cal made a
run at the Stanford lead, narrow
ing the margin to 45-38. The Bears
tried a full court press, but Cle
metson easily handled the double
and triple teaming with some ex
pert hall handling.

STANFORD’S DON CLEMETSON drives around Cal's Camden Wall
in some of the action in Friday night's loss to Cal, 61 -60. Clemetson scored 19 points for the losers, and had 18 more in Saturday's
68-58 win over the Bears.
52-15 Dose collected two more
fouls, his first two since the open
ing two minutes, and retired to
the bench in favor of Craig Cor
des. Cordes responded with sever
al rebounds and a key basket, so
that when Dose returned to ac
tion Stanford was resting com
fortably with a 56-45 lead.
Dose’s two free throws length
ened the lead to 62-19, Stanford’s
biggest margin of the game, and
gave Tom his 18th and 19th
points, enough for him to pass
John Windsor and become the
eleventh leading all-time Stanford
scorer. Tom has another full sea
son in which to better his posi
tion.
STANFORD HELD its lead for
the remaining four minutes,
coasting to the 68-58 win.
Dose led all scorers, as usual,
with 21 tallies. His opponent,
Wall, led California with 15. Cle
mctson had 18 markers for the
Tribe and played a brilliant floor
game as well. Moore contributed
12 to the Stanford cause, while
Dick Smith had 10 for the Bears.
Dose and Wall cancelled each
other out in the first half, both
collecting two fouls and getting
three baskets between them. How
ever, in the second half Cal
sagged off as many as three men
on Dose, resulting in numerous
fouls, which the big Stanford cen
ter converted into six free throws.
Wall and Smith, the Bears’ two
leading scorers, could hit on only
six of 23 shots, and three of these
were in the final four minutes,
when Stanford had the game on
ice with a 10-point lead.
The Indians shot at a 40 per
cent clip from the field for the
game, which is their season aver
age. The Bears hit 40 per cent in
the first half, but fell off to a 35
per cent pace for the full game.
Stanford outrebounded the Bears
48-44, due to their rugged offen
sive rebounding in the second
half.
