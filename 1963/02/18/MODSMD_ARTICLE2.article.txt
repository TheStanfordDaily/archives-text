Stanford’s Indians awoke in
time to throw their famed Satur
day punch at the California Bears
and regain the Big Six lead. Over
coming a three-point half-time
deficit, the Tribe stormed back to
take a convincing 68-58 win at the
Cal gym.
The victory, Stanford’s eighth
straight Saturday night win with
out a defeat this season, left their
conference record at five and
three. Washington lost at home
to USC and dropped behind the
Indians with a six and four mark.
STANFORD JUMPED to a five
to one lead, but in the process
Tom Dose gathered two quick
fouls. He then became cautious,
playing Cal center Camden Wall
more loosely, and Cal began to
dominate its offensive board,
scoring eight consecutive points.
Stanford tied the score at nine all
on Don Clemetson’s jump shot.
The lead changed hands through
out the first half, the two teams

finding themselves still dead
locked at 21-all with two-thirds
of the period gone.
At this point the Bears began
to pull away, relying on the shoot
ing of reserve guard Danny Luf
kin. Cal took a 27-23 lead, its
largest margin of the night, but
Dose scored throe quick points to
cut the advantage to 29-26 at the
half.
CAL OLTKKBOUNDKD Stan
ford in the first half, but as the
second period opened the Indians
gave indication that they planned
to repossess the boards. Dose
tapped in a two-pointer after two
previous tries had failed. After
Hollis Moore had hit a jump shot
to cut Cal’s precarious lead to
one point at 31-30, Dose hit an
other follow shot, and Stanford
had the lead for good.
Moments later co-captain Cle
metson. who has proved himself
to be better than any guard Stan
ford has faced this year, tallied
on a three-point play and gave the
Tribe a 38-33 lead. The Indians re
mained hot while Cal hit a cold
spell, failing to score from the
field for the first seven minutes
of the second half. Stanford mean
while had increased the gap to
45-34.
AFTER A time out, Cal made a
run at the Stanford lead, narrow
ing the margin to 45-38. The Bears
tried a full court press, but Cle
metson easily handled the double
and triple teaming with some ex
pert hall handling.
