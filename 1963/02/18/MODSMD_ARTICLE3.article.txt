# CCUN Stimulates Interest in
## 
### CAROL GOLDHAMMER 
In 1946, 66 college students,
sponsored by the American Asso
ciation for the United Nations,
formed the Collegiate Council for
the United Nations. Since that
time the organization has grown
to over 4000 college affiliates. Ac
cording to Don Light, a junior
and International Affairs Vice
President of the CCUN, it now
ranks as one of the most effective
and powerful of the national stu
dent associations.

The main purpose of the CCUN
is “to study and support” the
United Nations. It works to
spread information about the
United Nations and to stimulate
the interest of college students in
its policies and activities. It tries

to stimulate the formation of
opinions on U.N. policies and en
courages students to "take action
on their convictions.”

TIIK CCUN IS a member of the
Young Adult Council, which is
the coordinating body for the ma
jor student organizations in the
country. Through YAC the CCUN
carries on exchanges with other
national youtli organizations. Al
so. through YAC membership in
the World Assembly of Youth, the
western counterpart of the com
munist World Federation of Dem
ocratic Youth, the CCUN main
tains contact with worldwide stu
dent affairs.
The CCUN has built up a great
variety of programs and services
in working toward its goals.
In order to promote the educa
tional goals, the CCUN provides
its affiliates with a speaker serv
ice, materials for debates and
other programs, publications, and
films. It sponsors the Model Unit
ed Nations and aids in publicizing
such projects as United Nations
week.

i State and regional conferences
I are sot up which offer discussions !
on important and timely topics,
: formulate opinions and policies,!
| and leadership training.
EACH JUNE the CCUN holds a |
| National Leadership Institute on j
j the United Nations in New York.
A selected group of 300 students]
| from various college campuses j
j meets for an intensive eight days j
I of seminars, discussions, speakers, j
| and visits to the U.N. In past!
| years the group has held talks
| with the Soviet delegation, ambas-1
I sadors from Asia, Africa, and i
Latin America, and visited spe
| cialized U.N, agencies. The con
ference also offers leadership
[ training.
The CCUN also works through
! other student organizations. On
i the West Coast the main center

of CCUN activities is the Institute
of International Relations, which
is a CCUN affiliate.
In addition the CCUN carries
on extensive activities on the in
ternational level, and carries
many of its beliefs into practice.
THE ('('UN IS affiliated with
the International Student Move
ment for the United Nations. This
is the only world youth organiza
tion which is not split between
East and West. It now has over
j 30 countries participating. Thus,
! states Light, it provides a valu
i able medium of exchange between
eastern and western youth lead
ers.
In Bolivia the UNESCO has
! turned a literacy campaign over
j to ISMUN, in which the CCUN is
I participating. The goal is to or
j ganize an international peace
corps within the organization.
CCUN is also involved in other
| technical aid programs to less
i well-developed member nations of
ISMUN. One project in which
Stanford is involved is “Project
Amigos.” The purpose of the proj-

i ect is to provide teachers, medical
I aid, and workers to improve
i housing for Tijuana. Volunteer
I workers are headed by a profes
j sional social worker in such proj
ects.
ALSO, UNDER the sponsorship
of UNESCO, the CCUN organizes
| fund drives to help educational
I institutions in poorer nations.
The CCUN aids the UNICEF by
| helping to sell greeting cards, or
! ganizes the Asian Book Drive, and
sponsors activities of WUS.
' Through its constantly expand
i ing and maturing membership,
says Light, the CCUN is coming
to play an increasingly more im
portant role both in educating
and stimulating interest in the
U.N. among American students,
and in helping to fulfill the ideals
of the U.N. throughout the world.
