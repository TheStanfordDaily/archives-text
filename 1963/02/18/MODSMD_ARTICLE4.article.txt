# North to Discuss Armed Conflict
## 
### 
"Conflict”—the danger of re
lying on armed force as a re
sponse to the tensions of today’s
world will be discussed by Dr.
Robert North today at 4:15 p.m.
in Tresidder.

"From the dawn of history man
has been accustomed to armed
conflict as a response to his un
bearable anxieties and fears,”
North said. “But under current
conditions, it is difficult to per
ceive how large-scale armed force
can serve this function much
longer, no matter how real the
threat.”

Especially interested in inter
national conflict, Soviet relations
with Asia, and decision making in
a crisis, North has been a profes
sor of political science here since
last year. Ho is the author of four
books: “Kuomintang and Chinese
Communist Elites,” "Moscow and
Chinese Communists,” “Soviet
Russia and the East, 1920-1927”
(Co-author), and "Revolt in San
Marcos.”
