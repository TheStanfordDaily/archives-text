## Brandt s Party Wins Election in West Berlin; Reds Blanked 
### 
United Press Inter national
BERLIN—West Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt’s Socialists last night
won an overwhelming victory in elections that shut out the Com
munists without a single seat in the 134-memher city council.
Brandt’s increased majority came at the expense of Chancellor Kon
rad Adenauer’s Christian Democrats. The Communists never were
a threat, and again failed to get the 5 per cent of the vote they
needed to gain representation.
Tlie Communists promised West Berliners passes to visit friends
and relations in East Bei lin if they gained seats in the city assembly.
The Communists coupled the promise with a threat of “intolerable
results’’ if the democratic parties won.
The election campaign was so bitter that it placed in doubt a
continuation of a coalition government of Brandt’s socialists and the
Berlin branch of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s Christian Democrats.
The two parties have been fighting since the Christian Democrats
here blocked Brandt’s plan to confer with Soviet Premier Nikita
Khi’ushchev on his trip to East Berlin last month.
SOVIET TECHNICIANS LEAVE IRAQ— BAGHDAD—Sources close
to the Russian embassy said yesterday the Soviet Union has begun a
massive recall of Communist technicians stationed in Iraq. But the
new Iraqi government hastily denied the reports. The reported with
drawal followed sharp Soviet complaints against a crackdown on
Communists by the new Iraqi revolutionary regime.
In Baghdad, however, Iraqi Minister of State Hazim Jawad told
newsmen Iraq intends to honor all its existing international agree
ments “irrespective of what countries are involved.” Jawad dismissed
as “unimportant” a series of Communist broadcasts openly urging
Kurdish tribesmen in Iraq's oil-rich north to overthrow the now
regime.
ADENAUER FEARS COMMON MARKET ENTRY OF ENGLAND
BONN The long-standing doubt over Chancellor Konrad Ade
nauer’s true position towards further expansion of the Common
Market has suddenly erupted into something much more serious.
Suspicion has grown into practically certain knowledge that Ade
nauer really opposes British entry into the economic community and
supports the idea only as long as the Scandinavian countries and
perhaps Iceland are kept out. Adenauer fears socialist and neutralist
influence in Europe.
