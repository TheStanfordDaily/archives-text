# Katz Speaks on Warren s Proposal For Ethics Experts
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
“Justice Warren’s Proposal for
Ethics Experts” was the subject
of the Stanford Authors series
speech given yesterday by Dr. Jo
seph Katz, professor of Philoso
phy and research co-ordinator for
the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems.
Dr. Katz, co-editor of “Writers
on Ethics,” a book dealing with
literary interpretations of cur
rent ethical problems, gave a sy
nopsis of Warren’s proposals
stressing the need for ethics ex
perts to make important decisions
regarding individuals and corpor
ate bodies. Specifically this would
involve the addition of ethics ex
perts to the boards of business
corporations and other bodies
such as universities and hospitals.
LAWS ALONE, Warren feels,
are not enough to serve as a basis
for the regulation of society. Un
less based on moral grounds
which the majority feel are pro
moting human welfare, they are
ineffective like the the Prohibi
tion amendment to the Constitu
tion. The addition of ethics ex
perts to bodies of jurisprudence,
government, business, and labor
would give these groups a new in
sight into how their proposals
would affect the people whom
they influence.
The ensuing period of ques
tions and discussion investigated
the possibility and practicality of
this use of ethics experts It was
agreed that the export would not
only have to be sensitive to the
ethical implications of legal de
cisions, but would also have to
possess a broad background in so
ciology and economics.
THIS USE OF the ethics expert
incurs difficulty when applied to
large business corporations. Here
the expert could run into the
problem of being a “moral con
science” for the board, exerting
ethical control on capitalistic
competition. To help avoid pos
sible opposition to the basic
profit-making drive of corpora
tions, Dr. Katz suggested that the
expert have no official power on
the board save that of an institu
tionalized voice.
