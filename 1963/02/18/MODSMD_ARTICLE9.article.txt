### STEPHEN LEOPOLD 
Officers of the Institute of International Relations arc looking
into the possibility and feasibility of bringing 5 to 10 African
students from Bulgaria to study at Stanford, W. Scott Thompson,
president of the HR, told The Daily last night. During the last
week, the Africans have protested and demonstrated against the

Bulgarian Communist regimo foH
its ban on the organization of an
African Students’ Union in Bul
garia.
LETTERS have been sent to
both G. Mennen Williams, Under
secretary of State for African Af
fairs, and Daniel Montenegro, Di
rector of the Office of Public
Services. Thompson said, to find
out the immediate plans of the

African students and discover if
any of them have the requisite
academic qualifications for apply
ing to Stanford and a desire to
study in America.
Money will have to be raised
from the Stanford community to
pay for tuition and travel fare
from Bulgaria, added Thompson.
One tentative plan is to have dif
ferent living groups pay for the
Africans’ room and board. Robert
Rosch, vice-president of Beta Chi
fraternity, told The Daily that
“Beta Chi house has discussed
providing free room and board
for one of these students and is
very anxious to aid any African
students who may come over
from Bulgaria.”
THOMPSON said that he had
talked to Rixford K. Snyder, Stan
ford Director of Admissions, but
that University approval had not
yet been given to the plan. It has
been suggested that the Universi
ty, before accepting any of the
African students, would arrange
for interviews at one of the over
seas campuses.

Thompson concluded, “It is not
known at this time what the re
sult of the inquiry will be, but
success will largely depend on
the receptivity of the Stanford
community on helping out these
African students and on the State
Department's ability to help in
bringing the students over.”
