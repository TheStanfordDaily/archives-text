Quite naturally, the
fashion-conscious col
lege man is concerned
with his footwear,
with appearance and
also with good wear
ing qualities. On both
counts, you’ll go a
long way to beat a
pair of new cordovan
shoes from Roos
Atkins. Not cheap,
true enough. But
they’ll outwear any
two pairs of another
breed. Take your pick
from R A's extensive
selection, from 22.00
to 40.00. Various
styles; all very sturdy,
very correct.
