BAPTISM vs.
SPRINKLING
Catholic efforts to encour
age religious unity, and other
such efforts are to be com
mended. I would suggest
that they do as Mary and
Joseph did to find the lost
Christ. They had to return to
where they left Him.
Most religious people un
derstand that Jesus included
baptism as one essential to become a child of God. Mk. 16:16;
Jn.3:5.
God has authorized no man to substitute sprinkling for bap
tism (immersion-Col.2:1 2; Rom. 6:3-5; Jn.3:5; Ga1.1,-8; Mk.7:7.
This practice first started in A.D. 251 in the case of Novation
but wasn't given official recognition "until the year 1311, that
the legislature, in the council held at Ravenna, declared immer
sion or sprinkling to be indifferent." Edinburg Encyclopedia.
As various groups departed from the Catholic church but re
tained this change. In 1643, Presbyterians met at Westminister
Assembly to vote for the change. The vote was 24 to substitute
sprinkling and 24 to continue immersion. Chairman Lightfoot
became the deciding influence to practice sprinkling. This is a
dangerous one vote decision.
Baptize comes from a Greek word meaning immerse. In no
place in the Bible is it translated sprinkle. Greek words for
sprinkle are never translated baptize. The Christians hope hinges
on obedience of this commend. Mk,16:16; Jn.3:5.
To obey Christ is to become united with Him and with others of
His church. To obey something else is to become something else.
