It's now a fact: every Ford-built car in ’63 has self-adjusting brakes
“Give us a brake," Ford Motor Company engineers were told, “that
will automatically compensate for lining wear whenever an adjustment
is needed—and make it work for the entire life of the lining."
Tough assignment-but not insurmountable. Today, not only does
every Ford-built car boast self-adjusting brakes (Falcon extra-duty
bus-type wagons excluded), but the design is so excellent that adjust
ments can be made more precisely than by hand.
This Ford-pioneered concept is not complex. Key to it is a simple
mechanism which automatically maintains proper clearance between
brake drum and lining.
Self-adjustment takes place when the brakes are applied while backing
up. This adjustment normally occurs but once in several hundred
miles of driving. The brake pedal stays up, providing full pedal
reserve for braking.
Another assignment completed-and another example of how Ford
Motor Company provides engineering leadership for the American Road.
