# Kaufman to Attack Surrogate Parent' Higher Education
## 
### 
“What Is Wrong in Higher Ed
ucation?’’ will ho the subject of a
group discussion lod by Profes
sor Arnold S. Kaufman in the
small lounge of Tresidder today j
at 4:30 p.m. Dr. Kaufman, Asso
ciate Professor of Philosophy at
the University of Michigan, is
currently on leave at the Stan-:
ford Center for the Behavioral j
Sciences. He is the author of sev
eral articles dealing with the j
proper role in society of higher j
education and educational insli |
tut ions.
Kaufman argues in a recent ar
ticle, “The Ideals of Higher Edu- [
cation” that the notion of a uni
versity as a “surrogate parent”
is antithetical to the whole aim
of education, which is to develop
not only competent individuals,
but also responsible individuals.
Thus, institutions of higher ed-j
ucation should provide “ample j
scope for participation for inter-j
ested students in the making of
decisions which affect their lives.
It is not possible to become
responsible without being given
the opportunity to act responsi
bly.”
Commitment to a philosophy of
education, and action on the basis
of that commitment, concludes
Kaufman, is essential on the part
of faculty members. The teacher
should “be willing to speak out
and act, at the right time and in
the right way, on issues that con
cern him. He should demon
strate. by his example, that rea
son and commitment are not at
odds, but rather support and firm
one another up.”

Copies of Kaufman’s article
are available today in the brows
ing room at Tresidder Union.
Since the discussion will be based
on this article, students planning
to attend should read it before
hand. Refreshments will be
served. The meeting is sponsored
jointly by the ASSU Committee
on Academic Affairs and the Pro
gram Division of the Union.
