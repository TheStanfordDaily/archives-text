# Change Class Government Structure
## 
### 
The class governments at Stanford seem to serve only one
purposeâ€”one of social planning and coordination. Even this
one accomplishment is duplicated by residence social com
mittees and other campus organizations of various sizes and
ranges of campus influence.
The suggestion that the influence and power of the class
governments be enlarged simply because the governments
exist merely evades the issue. It would he illogical to take
powers from other campus organizations, or to duplicate their
powers to preserve class government structure.
The social duties fulfilled by the class governments are,
however, of some importance. These duties could be fulfilled
by special committees under the direction of the ASSU vice
president. The establishment of such committees would elimi
nate the little power blocs which serve no other purposes
than ones of obstruction and self-preservation. These proposed
committees could coordinate their activities better than the
existing class governments can and their purpose would be
more clearly defined. Such committees would be a great
improvement over the structure of class governments which
exists now.
