## Comedia's 'Carousel:' 'Chintzy, Dreary' 
### LEE PROJECTOR 
Rodgers’ and Hammerstein’s “Carousel” (adapted from Fer
enc Molnar’s “Liliom”) tells an oddly tragic story of various New
England seaside folk, living in the mythic days of innocence, the
late nineteenth century.
Despite its distended presentation, despite the late Oscar
Hammerstein’s gaggingly overwrought extrasuperoptimism, the
tale offers green avenues of possibility. Ah, but so sad to say,
the Saturday night “Carousel” production by the Comedia Thea
ter in Menlo Park travels for too few of these avenues. The
Comedia’s “Carousel” does have seventeen beautiful pieces of
music. Music the likes of “If I Loved You,” “Soliloquy,” “The
Highest Judge of All,” and “The Carousel Ballet” must fill any
one’s psyche with melody, be he an elite esthete or the T
squarest engineer. But seventeen songs, after all, do not a musi
cal make.
A legitimate musical demands, elementally, a director and
actors. But the people in the Comedia's production are some two
dozen non-actors in search of a director. They hobble, flounder,
and ingloriously stumble their way through the script in a style
that could not do justice to a first-grade Easter pageant. There
is no conception of timing; there is not a hint of focus; there is
no control whatsoever; in short, there is no direction. And what
kills the mustard is the fact that few of the principals have any
acting capacity beyond that of a paper clip. In every non-musical
aspect this production is barbaric, a cruel slap in the audience’s
face. They do sing wonderfully. And oh, when they get a chance,
they do dance nicely. And that’s it.
Casting, it seems, was done by voice. Hence, the beautiful
songs are sung beautifully by Allen Praefke, Lorna Peden, Ra
mona Grim, and Lila Lloyd. Mary Alyce’s choreography is con
sistently entertaining, and it climaxes in the captivating emotion
of the long “Carousel Ballet,” featuring worthy Carolyn Carlson
and worthy Charles Graziani. For song and dance, this “Carou
sel” is a lark and a lily.
But as a whole it is chintzy and dreary, filled with people
whose virtues are limited to the eight-note scale. There are only
three noble exceptions. Rusty D'Anna as an engaging yet vil
lainous wharf-rat plies his bihued role with great skill. Leading
chorus member Linda Dexter is blessed with an almost indecent
amount of talent. And Lorna Peden as angelic Julie Jordan goes
beyond the one-dimension in which her character is so carefully
conceived, managing to charge “Carousel’s” conclusion with
some honest emotion (against Rodgers’ and Hammerstein’s in
tent, no doubt).
The strong points of this “Carousel” production are the
music, the dance, reliable Jeanne Schultz’s costumes, the noble
trio mentioned above, and, not least. Lorna Peden’s classically
golden hair. But, overwhelmingly, the key metaphor for the pro
duction is hash. Seventeen songs do not a musical make. They
only make seventeen songs.
