## Unity at the Brink 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
There would be less puzzlement about General De Gaulle, I
believe, if vve began by recognizing that the difference between
us is over the cold war. The General writes down to a degree
which President Kennedy would not dare to do the military and
political threat of the Soviet Union. That is why the General
dares, as Mr. Macmillan said last week, “to bring the whole
Western Alliance into great jeopardy.’’
In the General’s view, the balance of power has turned de
cisively against the Soviet Union, and, consequently, the Western
Alliance is obsolescent and of diminishing importance.
The General, it seems to me, is acting today on what is likely
to happen, but to happen only in the future. Surely it would be
more prudent if in our dealings with Mr. Khrushchev, which are
still very difficult and dangerous, the Western Alliance were
being consolidated rather than disrupted. But the General has,
of course, heard this argument. He is unimpressed by it. How
ever much we may think that western unity is paramount and
imperative, he does not in fact believe that western unity is para
mount and imperative. We shall not move him by crying out
that the Western Alliance is in danger and that American troops
may be withdrawn from Europe.
We may be sure that General De Gaulle, who certainly is
not wanting in foresight, has foreseen this possibility. I would
suppose he has satisfied himself that what counts most in the
Western Alliance, the American military commitment in Europe,
is bound to remain until Gaullist Europe is strong enough to deal
on equal terms with the Soviet Union. He does not have to woo
us. For we are already indissolubly married to Europe, and. until
the West and the East arrive at an eventual peace, we cannot
dissolve this marriage. In the meantime', there is no need to re
ward us for doing what we have to do.
This is the right context, I would say, in which to study the
question of ‘‘how,’’ as Life magazine puts it, “we shift our west
ern nuclear monopoly .. . info (an) alliance of genuine
equals . .
The inner core of our nuclear monopoly is the fact that only
the President of the United States has authority to use our nu
clear weapons. Because our nuclear weapons at e something like
98 per cen of the nuclear strength of the whole Western Alliance,
no other nuclear power, neither Britain nor France, can in fact
fire a nuclear weapon without the consent of the President of
the United States. Neither General De Gaulle nor Prime Minister
Macmillan could conceivably use their nuclear weapons unless
they knew for certain that they were covered by the United
States against Soviet reprisals.
This is the American nuclear monopoly and to live under
its protection is, says the General, “intolerable for a great state.”
How are we to arrive at a tolerable relationship? For there will
have to be a relationship between European and American nu
clear power—at least until that very distant day when Europe
has a nuclear power of its own capable of coping with the Soviet
Union.
The crucial problem of the relationship turns on the ultimate
command decision to use nuclear weapons. The more closely we
examine this problem, the clearer it becomes, I submit, that at
the final point of decision in war there must be unity of com
mand. Coalitions cannot be conducted by committees in time of
war. In the whole process of preparing and planning, there is
not only room but need for committees representing the mem
bers of the coalition. But when there is war, they must choose a
Foch, an Eisenhower, a Mac Arthur, a Kennedy.
The further we get from the brink, the less do we have to
think about unity of command (i.e„ monopoly) and the more we
can think of a committee of equals. For this reason, it is most
unlikely that we shall find now a theoretical solution of the
problem posed by our nuclear monopoly. The problem is most
acute when war is not imminent. One can say that monopoly, or
unity of command, may he intolerable in peacetime. But it is
indispensable in wartime. The great controversy today about the
monopoly is due primarily to the relaxation of the tension of thq
cold war. The controversy would evaporate if we were on the
brink of a great war.
