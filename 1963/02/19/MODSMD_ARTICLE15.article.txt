Editors, Tin* Daily:
I would like to commend the Daily staff for its editorial
“Survey of Class Government Needed.” It was not an irrational
scathing attack—the kind which results in nothing but bad
feeling and antagonism. It was, on the contrary, a constructive
piece of criticism which maintained that class government needs
“a long and careful look.” With this suggestion, I heartily
concur.
It seems that the editorial was prompted by the recent
resignation of the University of California’s Freshman Class
President, Bob Lander. Ostensibly, Lander quit his position be
cause class government was useless. But let us check further
into his motives. First, he grades were below the 2.00 level
needed to stay in office. So he would have been ejected from
office had he not resigned first. Secondly, he had done nothing
to try to reform what he considered a bad situation—as a mat
ter of fact he had done nothing at all. His vice-president, Mike
Kahan, said that Lander “had not organized or participated in a
single class activity, had not called a council meeting in two and
a half months, and had not attempted to talkWany of *thelotheir(
class officers in three months.” Ih the light of these facts, I feel
that Lander’s resignation must be regarded as the irresponsible
act of a lazy class officer seeking to save face and gain political
prestige.
Although I can have no respect for Mr. Lander’s stand, I,
nevertheless, feel that The Daily has raised a question that
merits consideration. It is my belief that class governments can
and must go beyond the stage of merely being class social com
mittees. The social functions—reunions, dances, entertainment
are valuable services, but the class governments must work into
other areas of university life, if they are really to be meaningful.
The sophomore class government has been working this year on
the problem of extending the range of class activity, so that it
becomes a service to a wider range of students. An important
step in this direction was the recent hostel with Professors
Robert McAfee Brown and Lucio Ruotolo. The hostel, sponsored
and subsidized by the sophomore class and worked out in con
junction with the Student-Faculty committee, was a great success.
If class governments are to be really worthwhile they must
expand their activities and efforts with more programs such as
the sophomore class hostel—they must become, as The Daily
editorial suggests, “organizations . . . utilized in a more bene
ficial and meaningful manner.”

Editors, The Daily:
I am writing on behalf of what I consider to be a large but
silent body of student opinion. Our concern is with the unpaved
path leading from the junction of the Tresidder parking lot with
the stairs to the ASSU office down to the patio of the union.
Because the path is unpaved, it is very muddy and difficult to
use in wet weather. Furthermore, the landscape crew is in the
habit of storing their barricades there, and thus add to the
difficulty.
While this path may not have been envisioned by the archi
tect, its existence is another thrilling example of student effort
uniting to achieve a necessary goal. Its necessity is proven by
the ridiculousness of its alternative, the paved 440 down around
the front of Dinkelspiel which, like Columbus, tries to go east
by heading west.
Students, I urge you to speak out without fear; this is an
on campus issue.
Administration, I urge you to join the PAVE drive. A prob
lem does exist.

The undersigned members of Los Arcos Eating Club strong
ly encourage the members of the Board of Trustees to review
the role of the University administration in regard to rights of
expression on public issues. It is the strong conviction of this
group that student organizations have the right and obligation to
express their opinions on issues transcending the boundaries of
the campus.
It is hoped that members of the Board of Trustees seriously
consider these rights at their March meeting and that a policy
consistent with academic freedom be adopted.

class officers in three months.” Ih the light of these facts, I feel
that Lander’s resignation must be regarded as the irresponsible
act of a lazy class officer seeking to save face and gain political
prestige.
Although I can have no respect for Mr. Lander’s stand, I,
nevertheless, feel that The Daily has raised a question that
merits consideration. It is my belief that class governments can
and must go beyond the stage of merely being class social com
mittees. The social functions—reunions, dances, entertainment
are valuable services, but the class governments must work into
other areas of university life, if they are really to be meaningful.
The sophomore class government has been working this year on
the problem of extending the range of class activity, so that it
becomes a service to a wider range of students. An important
step in this direction was the recent hostel with Professors
Robert McAfee Brown and Lucio Ruotolo. The hostel, sponsored
and subsidized by the sophomore class and worked out in con
junction with the Student-Faculty committee, was a great success.
If class governments are to be really worthwhile they must
expand their activities and efforts with more programs such as
the sophomore class hostel—they must become, as The Daily
editorial suggests, “organizations . . . utilized in a more bene
ficial and meaningful manner.”

Editors, The Daily:
I am writing on behalf of what I consider to be a large but
silent body of student opinion. Our concern is with the unpaved
path leading from the junction of the Tresidder parking lot with
the stairs to the ASSU office down to the patio of the union.
Because the path is unpaved, it is very muddy and difficult to
use in wet weather. Furthermore, the landscape crew is in the
habit of storing their barricades there, and thus add to the
difficulty.
While this path may not have been envisioned by the archi
tect, its existence is another thrilling example of student effort
uniting to achieve a necessary goal. Its necessity is proven by
the ridiculousness of its alternative, the paved 440 down around
the front of Dinkelspiel which, like Columbus, tries to go east
by heading west.
Students, I urge you to speak out without fear; this is an
on campus issue.
Administration, I urge you to join the PAVE drive. A prob
lem does exist.

The undersigned members of Los Arcos Eating Club strong
ly encourage the members of the Board of Trustees to review
the role of the University administration in regard to rights of
expression on public issues. It is the strong conviction of this
group that student organizations have the right and obligation to
express their opinions on issues transcending the boundaries of
the campus.
It is hoped that members of the Board of Trustees seriously
consider these rights at their March meeting and that a policy
consistent with academic freedom be adopted.

I would like to commend the Daily staff for its editorial
“Survey of Class Government Needed.” It was not an irrational
scathing attack—the kind which results in nothing but bad
feeling and antagonism. It was, on the contrary, a constructive
piece of criticism which maintained that class government needs
“a long and careful look.” With this suggestion, I heartily
concur.
It seems that the editorial was prompted by the recent
resignation of the University of California’s Freshman Class
President, Bob Lander. Ostensibly, Lander quit his position be
cause class government was useless. But let us check further
into his motives. First, he grades were below the 2.00 level
needed to stay in office. So he would have been ejected from
office had he not resigned first. Secondly, he had done nothing
to try to reform what he considered a bad situation—as a mat
ter of fact he had done nothing at all. His vice-president, Mike
Kahan, said that Lander “had not organized or participated in a
single class activity, had not called a council meeting in two and
a half months, and had not attempted to talkWany of *thelotheir(
class officers in three months.” Ih the light of these facts, I feel
that Lander’s resignation must be regarded as the irresponsible
act of a lazy class officer seeking to save face and gain political
prestige.
