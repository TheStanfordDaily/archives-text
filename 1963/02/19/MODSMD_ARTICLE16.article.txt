The Stanford rugby team
snored an easy 11-6 victory over
ihe Olympic Club of San Fran
cisco last Saturday afternoon in
a bitterly fought contest that

saw many near fights. Early in
j the game it looked as if Stan

1 rival uniform to haunt his old
(teammates as the Olympic Club

scored first on a penalty kick by
the ex-Card.
But the Indians were not be
hind for long as Gordon Waddell
scored, the conversion was good,
and Stanford never trailed again.
Bob Price and Steve Van Nort
each scored again in the first
half, putting Stanford ahead 11-3
at the bleak.

Midway through the second
half. Lindskog scored another
penally kick for the Olympic
Club, making the score 11-6,
where it remained for the rest of
the game.
Coach Fete Kmetovic singled
out Waddell and Frank Patilucci
as playing a particularly good
game, and Tim Hansel for his
play in the scrums.

The two Stanford J.V. teams
also played this weekend. The
number one team beat the Olym
pic Club 8-0, but the second J.V.
team lost to the Cal Aggies. 11-3,
