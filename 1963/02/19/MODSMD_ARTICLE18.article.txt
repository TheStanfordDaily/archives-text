# Cal Gymnasts Beat Indians Easily
## 
### 
Alan Miyamoto with a second
on the side horse and Russ Bur
mister, who tied for second on
the still rings, were Stanford’s
top finishers in the Cal meet Fri
day night. California, co-cham
pions of the AAWU last year, had
little difficulty in registering
their 36th straight dual meet vic
tory by an SO I '■< to 28 1 2 score.
The Indians were without the
services of two regular perform
ers; Roger Rhoads, a seven-event
man, is still out with strep
throat; and Rod Rinderknicht
(free exercise, side horse and
tumbling) is sidelined with an in
jured foot. That left only four
Indians in the meet.
Bill Rusher added a spot of
humor to the meet when he en
tered the tumbling event (just to
pick up the fifth place point) and
amused the audience as well as
the judges with his impromptu
exhibition.
Tonight the Indians travel to
San Jose State for a meet on
more equal terms.
