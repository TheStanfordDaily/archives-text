## Swimmers Set Records, Lose 
### JIM DONOVAN 
On Saturday the Stanford
swimming team placed second to
Foothill College in a triangular
meet. Last year’s Junior College
champions scored 66 points to
Stanford's 29, but this statistical
chasm is no valid indication of
the Tribe’s performance at Foot
hill.
The medley relay team set a
new Stanford record but lost by
wo tenths of a second. Pete Pet
tigrew lopped all his previous
marks in the 200-yard backstroke
only to come in second.
However, I Ilka Suvanto won
the 500-yard freestyle with a
5:03.1, breaking pool and Stan
ford records and Paul Hait set
another varsity mark by winning
the 200-yard breaststroke in
2:24.4. Marty Hull also broke the
pool record, winning the 200-yard |
butterfly.
Though the Stanford swim-1
mers came in second to Foothill
in many races, their perform
ances were often strong enough
to defeat Oregon, the third team
in the meet. The Indians out
pointed the Ducks, 57';!-27 Vi.
On Friday the Tribe defeated
an overmatched UCLA team 64-
31. The versatile Suvanto broke
the varsity 200-yard butterfly
record with a 2:02,2. Doscher’s
time of 50.9 in the 100-yard free
style was good enough to lake
first. Hull, Pettigrew, and Hait
also won.
