# German Measles Cases Reach Epidemic Point
## 
### 
The number of German measles
cases during the past four weeks
has increased to epidemic propor
tions, according to Dr. Maurice
Osborne, Executive Director of
the Health Service. There have
been thirty-five cases reported
within the past month. This con
stitutes a significantly larger
amount than any similar period
of time within the past five years.
Dr. Osborne described it as a
"nuisance disease” with very lit
tle actual illness. The major
symptom is a slightly itchy rash
proceeded by a few days of “non
specific cold symptoms.” The dis
ease lasts only about five to six
days, with a period of commu
nicability of about four days. It
is requested that students report
to the Health Service if the rash
should appear.
Dr. Osborne suggests that the
public try to avoid the typical
“Victorian attitude” towards the
disease. It is harmful to only one
ago group the fetus during the
first three months of pregnancy:
to all others it is entirely harm
less. As for preventative mea
sures, Dr. Osborne stated that all
"available means have very little,
if any, effectiveness.”
