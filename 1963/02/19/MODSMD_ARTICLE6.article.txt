# North Discusses Society Conflict

1 “Man cannot abolish conflict
it is impossible but he must
| learn to integrate it into his sod
i ety or else annihilate himself,’’
j warned Dr. Robert North, pro
fessor of political science, yester
j day, in a speech sponsored by the
Program Division at Tresidder |
j Union.
North pointed out that the two I
fundamental processes in human |
development are “conflictual and j
integralive.” Previous to Hiro- j
shima, mankind was able to solve,
or at least settle temporarily, all
conflicts by using armed force;
but in the atomic age this meth
od of all-out struggle is prohibi
tive.
Thus, man now must control
his inherent conflicts under the
“integrative umbrellas” of organ
izational control in order to solve
any problem peaceably.
This is not a new proposition,
North asserted, for “integrative
umbrellas” have been used be
fore. The U.S. Constitution is one
instance, and the traffic laws of
the state of California arc an
other. These documents work un
der a “means-end chain,” which
simply outlines the means by
which one can properly obtain an
end without conflict.
However, conflict is not elimi
nated under such a system for
there are still law courts and elec
tions, “licensed rebellions.” to
serve as outlets for necessary
conflict. Indeed, there is more
conflict in a democracy than in a
monolithic state.
North mentioned a “respected
U.N.” as one possible integrative
organization for the future. He
assorted (hat the U.N. needs two
things to become such a body:
11 a respect for its existence,
since presently “it is almost as
frequently ignored as the prohi
bition amendment”: and 2) a
realization by all parties that the
U.N. should not solve problems,
but serve only as an international
