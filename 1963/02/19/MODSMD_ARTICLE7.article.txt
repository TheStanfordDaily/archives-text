# YR Faction Accuses Birchers of Conspiracy
## 
### PHIL DEUERE 
Yesterday two Stanford students conneeted ith the Stanford
Area Young Republicans accused the John Birch Society of trying
to lake over the entire California Young Republicans and said
that the Stanford Area branch “was being used as a tool of the
Society.” The accusation was made as a result of the election last

Sunday as president of the Cali
fornia YR's of a man whom the
New York Times called a Birch
"supporter.”

♦ .
sue at the election, and that this
was influential in the ultimate
election of Robert A. Gaston of
Los Angelos as president. Gaston
| has admitted that he used Birch
] Society funds partly to sponsor
j his campaign.
Smith said that the Stanford
1 Area YR’s were nationally known
las a Birch-oriented organization,
j primarily due to the presence of
j former president Richard Noble,
1 a second-year law student alleged
jly connected unofficially with the
western governor of the John
j Birch Society, John Rousselot. He
j said that to outside observers
j “the views of Westerlund and
| Noble appear to he the views of
| the Stanford Republican students
M under the present system. These
students are using the prestige
l of the Stanford student body to
■ support the John Birch Society.”
IN CONCLUSION Smith at
j tacked Westerlund’s support of
the Birchers in the balloting. He
said that she carried the only
| vote of the Stanford delegation,
and that her voting did not re
j fleet the views of the majority of
I the Stanford Area members. He
said no poll of the club was taken
before the delegation left for

Mike Matheson, area director
of the Young Republicans Col- j
lege Federation and a former |
vice-president of the Stanford j
Area YR’s, and Ron Smith, for !
mer member of the Nixon staff j
and former member of the Re |
publican State Central Commit-1
tee staff, both attended the meet
ing in Fresno last weekend. They {
came back saying that the Birch
ers had made the first step to
wards the takeover of the Cali
fornia YR’s, an event which
would ultimately lead to the take
over of the Republican Party in
the state.
SMITH SAID that the Stanford
delegation, headed by SAYR pres
ident Barbara Westerlund, voted
with the Birch slate on every is-

Fresno.
In answer to the above state
ments, Stanford Area president
Westerlund said that she had
been unaware that there had
been a "Birch slate,” and said
that Matheson had been one of
her supporters during her elec
tion campaign. She said that her
views were w’ell known at that
time and had not changed. An
other member of the delegation,
P. J. DeWolf, said that as far as
he knew. Westerlund had voted
only after a thorough investiga
tion of the issues.
Both Westerlund and Dick Wci
nig, former Stanford Area presi
dent, denied the charges that Gas
ton was a Birch supporter. De-
Wolf suggested that Gaston had
j a pragmatic outlook in using the
' Birchers as long as they could
help him. but said that he was
certainly not a “tool” of the so
ciety.
Westerlund and Weinig also
j denied the accusation that the
j Stanford Area YR’s had anything
j at all to do with the John Birch
| Society. Westerlund said that
there had been no communica-
I tion with the Society, and that if
there were any Birch money on
campus she had not seen it.
NOBLE, former two-time presi
dent, answered the charges that
I he was connected with Birch lead
er Rousselot by saying that the
j last lime he had seen him had
j been a year and a half ago at a
YR meeting. Ho denied that he
had any connection whatever
with the Society.
In conclusion. Weinig pointed
j out that Matheson and Smith had
j both been supporters of the lib
j oral candidate for president and
I had lost the election. He said that
“in absence of any facts to sup
| port their accusations” their
I statements can only be regarded
jas “sour grapes.” He said that
“unless they have any concrete
facts to support what they say,
wo see no reason to pay any at
-1 lent ion to them.”

delegation, headed by SAYR pres
ident Barbara Westerlund, voted
with the Birch slate on every is-

Fresno.
In answer to the above state
ments, Stanford Area president
Westerlund said that she had
been unaware that there had
been a "Birch slate,” and said
that Matheson had been one of
her supporters during her elec
tion campaign. She said that her
views were w’ell known at that
time and had not changed. An
other member of the delegation,
P. J. DeWolf, said that as far as
he knew. Westerlund had voted
only after a thorough investiga
tion of the issues.
Both Westerlund and Dick Wci
nig, former Stanford Area presi
dent, denied the charges that Gas
ton was a Birch supporter. De-
Wolf suggested that Gaston had
j a pragmatic outlook in using the
' Birchers as long as they could
help him. but said that he was
certainly not a “tool” of the so
ciety.
Westerlund and Weinig also
j denied the accusation that the
j Stanford Area YR’s had anything
j at all to do with the John Birch
| Society. Westerlund said that
there had been no communica-
I tion with the Society, and that if
there were any Birch money on
campus she had not seen it.
NOBLE, former two-time presi
dent, answered the charges that
I he was connected with Birch lead
er Rousselot by saying that the
j last lime he had seen him had
j been a year and a half ago at a
YR meeting. Ho denied that he
had any connection whatever
with the Society.
In conclusion. Weinig pointed
j out that Matheson and Smith had
j both been supporters of the lib

I had lost the election. He said that
“in absence of any facts to sup

Yesterday two Stanford students conneeted ith the Stanford

las a Birch-oriented organization,
j primarily due to the presence of
j former president Richard Noble,
1 a second-year law student alleged

that the Stanford Area branch “was being used as a tool of the
Society.” The accusation was made as a result of the election last

Sunday as president of the Cali
fornia YR's of a man whom the
New York Times called a Birch
"supporter.”

♦ .
sue at the election, and that this
was influential in the ultimate
election of Robert A. Gaston of
Los Angelos as president. Gaston
| has admitted that he used Birch
] Society funds partly to sponsor
j his campaign.
Smith said that the Stanford
1 Area YR’s were nationally known
las a Birch-oriented organization,
j primarily due to the presence of
j former president Richard Noble,
1 a second-year law student alleged
jly connected unofficially with the
western governor of the John
j Birch Society, John Rousselot. He
j said that to outside observers
j “the views of Westerlund and
| Noble appear to he the views of
| the Stanford Republican students
M under the present system. These
students are using the prestige
l of the Stanford student body to
■ support the John Birch Society.”
IN CONCLUSION Smith at
j tacked Westerlund’s support of
the Birchers in the balloting. He
said that she carried the only
| vote of the Stanford delegation,
and that her voting did not re
j fleet the views of the majority of
I the Stanford Area members. He
said no poll of the club was taken
before the delegation left for

Mike Matheson, area director
of the Young Republicans Col- j
lege Federation and a former |
vice-president of the Stanford j
Area YR’s, and Ron Smith, for !
mer member of the Nixon staff j
and former member of the Re |
publican State Central Commit-1
tee staff, both attended the meet
ing in Fresno last weekend. They {
came back saying that the Birch
ers had made the first step to
wards the takeover of the Cali
fornia YR’s, an event which
would ultimately lead to the take
over of the Republican Party in
the state.
SMITH SAID that the Stanford
delegation, headed by SAYR pres
ident Barbara Westerlund, voted
with the Birch slate on every is-

Fresno.
In answer to the above state
ments, Stanford Area president
Westerlund said that she had
been unaware that there had
been a "Birch slate,” and said
that Matheson had been one of
her supporters during her elec
tion campaign. She said that her
views were w’ell known at that
time and had not changed. An
other member of the delegation,
P. J. DeWolf, said that as far as
he knew. Westerlund had voted
only after a thorough investiga
tion of the issues.
Both Westerlund and Dick Wci
nig, former Stanford Area presi
dent, denied the charges that Gas
ton was a Birch supporter. De-
Wolf suggested that Gaston had
j a pragmatic outlook in using the
' Birchers as long as they could
help him. but said that he was
certainly not a “tool” of the so
ciety.
Westerlund and Weinig also
j denied the accusation that the
j Stanford Area YR’s had anything
j at all to do with the John Birch
| Society. Westerlund said that
there had been no communica-
I tion with the Society, and that if
there were any Birch money on
campus she had not seen it.
NOBLE, former two-time presi
dent, answered the charges that
I he was connected with Birch lead
er Rousselot by saying that the
j last lime he had seen him had
j been a year and a half ago at a
YR meeting. Ho denied that he
had any connection whatever
with the Society.
In conclusion. Weinig pointed
j out that Matheson and Smith had
j both been supporters of the lib
j oral candidate for president and
I had lost the election. He said that
“in absence of any facts to sup
| port their accusations” their
I statements can only be regarded
jas “sour grapes.” He said that
“unless they have any concrete
facts to support what they say,
wo see no reason to pay any at
-1 lent ion to them.”
