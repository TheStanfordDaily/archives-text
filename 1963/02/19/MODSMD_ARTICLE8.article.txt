## 
### 
Malcolm Cowley, this week's
Tuesday Evening Series speaker,
will he discussing “The Literary 1
1930’5,” at 7:45 in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. Mr. Cowley is a well
known literary critic, at one lime
Book Editor of the “New Repub
lic” and is now affiliated with the
Viking Press. He taught at Stan
ford for a short time in 1960-61
and before that in the spring of
1956. He has also taught at Yale,
Michigan, and the University of
Washington.
During the depression, Mr.
Cowley went to Paris, like many
of the literary men lured by the
5 to 1 value ratio of francs to dol
lars and the absence of prohibi
tion laws, and lived among the
“left-bankers” who at that time
included such men as Heming
way, Steinbeck, James Joyce and
his followers and the dadaists.
His book "The Exile’s Return”
is a literary summing-up of this
experience.
The “Literary 1930’5” included
the writings of Steinbeck, Faulk
ner, and Thomas Wolfe. This was
a period of “social consciousness”
which colored the tone of the lit
erature of the time, lead by
Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath.”
Communism had a less threaten
ing tinge and many of the writers
and intellectuals of the time were
sympathetic towards it as a solu
tion to the economic situation.
Besides his own books which
include “The Dry Season” and
“The Literary Situation” as well
as “Exile’s Return,” ho has edited
“The Poetry and Prose of Walt
Whitman,” “The Portable Faulk
• ner,” “Leaves of Grass,” and has
written an introduction to F.
. Scott Fitzgerald, and a preface
