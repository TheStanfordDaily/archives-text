# Stanford Will Not Adopt Yale-Type Plan to Aid Humanities
## 
### RICHARD INWOOD 
Yale University last fall announced its adoption of
a plan to provide salary supplements of $l,OOO beyond
basic salary for summer research work by junior fac
ulty members in the humanities not supported by out
side grants.
Commenting on the plan, Yale Provost Kingman
Brewster said, “This bold action will restore genuine
academic independence and self-determination in the
face of pressures which tend to corrupt and distort the
academic profession into an army of organization men.’’
According to Brewster. Yale feared damage to "aca
demic self-determination” and distortion of the careers
of young professors drawn to special studies in the hu
manities and social sciences for which meager founda
tion funds are made available.
BKEWSTK.K STRESSED the automatic nature of
the Yale fund, conditional solely upon the junior faculty
member’s word that ho will work just two months in
his field. No approval by a superior faculty member
will be necessary. It is Yale’s hope, says Brewster, that
other campuses will be influenced to similarly protect
the security and integrity of its professors in the hu
manities and social sciences.
Benjamin M. Page, chairman of the Stanford aca
demic council, admits that mounting government and
foundation research awards to the sciences have indeed
tended to overshadow the humanities at the relatively
few institutions across the nation wealthy enough in
physical plant and brain-power to support large con
tracts.

The situation at Stanford does, Page believes, con
stitute a problem a problem that has been discussed
in the academic council but it is only the reflection of
a national trend.
ROBERT -I. WERT, Vice Provost of Stanford, states
that although available funds in the natural or “hard”
sciences do, in fact, considerably outweigh those in the
humanities and social sciences, Stanford has tried to
alleviate the situation with measures similar to the new'
Yale program. Limited funds are provided for summer
work by the faculty. Stanford faculty can also save
expenses on summer research work in Europe by join
ing a Stanford foreign campus flight. Wert, however,
foresees no expansion of the Stanford program to ap
proximate the Yale plan in scope or in ease of obtaining
funds.
When questioned about possible danger to the hu
manities at Stanford from outsize government and
foundation grants to science, Frederic O. Glover, execu
tive' assistant to the president, stressed the strength of
several humanities departmenlsandpointedtoaconstant
improvement. There was never, he feels, a real prob
lem in the strength of the humanities at Stanford. Sal
aries have been increasing, as the number of recent
professors from eastern universities will demonstrate.
As far as Glover knows, there is no prospect of a plan
to methodically provide funds for special research in
humanities.
GhOVUIt DENIES that there is any danger of weak
ening the relative overall strength of the humanities
and social sciences through government grants to the
hard sciences, or any clear danger that careers of
humanists are likely to be distorted through limited
research funds available for special problems and areas.

II the prospect ol more extensive and less conditional
aid to humanities scholars at Stanford is unlikely, it is
not because such aid could not do much good at Stan
ford. A foreign-born professor now teaching at Stanford
has called attention to what ho considers the “inferior
ity complex” of humanistic studies in America in the
face of rapid scientific and technological progress, and
he feels that unconditional and more extensive research
support from the administration at Stanford would do
much to relieve the “little sister” status of the humani
ties here as elsewhere.
Dean Joseph M. Pettit less than a month ago assert
ed that the humanities at Stanford are “underpriviliged”
and assigned as a cause “the availability of govern
ment funds for scientific research.”
|;M;N at HARVARD, whose traditional strength in
the humanities is largely unquestioned, President Na
than N. Pusey has recently seen fit to declare that
higher education in America is not receiving sufficient
federal aid and that “concern for disciplines other than
science is being deliberately fostered and rigorously
maintained at Harvard, with private support.”
Professor Herbert L. Packer of the Stanford Law
School made this statement published in the “Stanford
Today” of Spring 1062: ”... if there is some catching
up to be done at Stanford, I suspect that it's on the side
of the humanities and social sciences rather than the
natural sciences and engineering.”
Vet when questioned as to the likelihood of a Yale
type plan to further strengthen the humanities, the
tendency at Stanford is to call attention to tho general
health of the humanities as they stand, the increasing
size of graduate departments, and the “name” profes
sors acquired from the East,
