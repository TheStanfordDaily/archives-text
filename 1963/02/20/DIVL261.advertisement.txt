Truth not history is the proof of the church of Christ. In the parable of the
sower, Christ says that. The seed is the word of God." When God s word as
seed is planted (believed] in the heart of man and obeyed, that man is “called
out" of sin into Christ. He is a child of God, a Christian, a citizen in the kingdom
of God, and is a member of the church that Christ established. To obey 99%
Bible, beautifully taught, and 1 % something else, is to become something else.
Truth not Peter is the rock upon which Christ built his church. Peter had wit
nessed Christ s miracles, fulfilled prophecy, influence, and teachings that de
clared him to be the Son of God. This truth that inspired faith, love and obedience
is the foundation of the church that Christ established.
Ritualism, tradition, history and other substitues cannot take the place of indi
vidual responsibility to truth before God. Acts 2:13-41; Mk.16;16 ; Jn.3:5.
