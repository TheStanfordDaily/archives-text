## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Mike Malheson, Area Director
of the California Young Republi
can College Federation, and Tom
Peterson, president of the Re
publican Caucus of the Political
Union, yesterday resigned as
members of (he executive board
of the Stanford Area Young Re
publicans.
Matheson and Peterson, in a
letter of resignation submitted to
Barbara Westerlund. president of
SAYR. “disassociated (them
selves) from (Miss Westerlund’s)
recent actions as president of
(SAYR)” in protest against her
support of Robert Gaston at the
recent California YR convention
at which Gaston was elected pres
ident.
The letter charged that support
of Gaston, “a man described by
the major newspapers as a ‘Birch
suporter’ and whose platform
consisted of a promise to reject
all compromises with other Re
publican views.” rather than an
other candidate, “a Goldwater
conservative who had pledged to
work with all elements of the
Republican Party,” violated Miss
Westerlund’s campaign pledge of
last fall.
Peterson and Matheson assert
ed that Miss Westerlund had
promised, during her campaign,
“to maintain neutrality in state
political contests’ and not to favor
conservative Republican views
over liberal Republican views,
both of which were held by SAYR
members.
Miss Westerlund prefaced the
resignation with the request that
Matheson resign his board posi
tion. She charged that he had
contributed little to SAYR and
had not participated fully in ex
ecutive board meetings. Matheson
later denied the charges.
Miss Westerlund defended her
actions at the YR convention,
stating that she had talked with
the candidates and had voted for
Gaston because 1) the other can
didate would not take a clear
stand on the issues, 2) no SAYR
members at the convention ex
pressed their support for the
other candidate to her, and 3)
those SAYR members who had
spoken to her had expressed a
preference for Gaston.
The members of the executive
board, after accepting the resig
nations of Matheson and Peter
son, endorsed the actions of Miss
Westerlund at the convention
and objected to the “Birch sup
ported” label given to Gaston and
the Young Republicans.

spoken to her had expressed a
preference for Gaston.

letter of resignation submitted to
Barbara Westerlund. president of
SAYR. “disassociated (them
selves) from (Miss Westerlund’s)
recent actions as president of
(SAYR)” in protest against her
support of Robert Gaston at the
recent California YR convention
at which Gaston was elected pres
ident.
The letter charged that support
of Gaston, “a man described by
the major newspapers as a ‘Birch
suporter’ and whose platform
consisted of a promise to reject
all compromises with other Re
publican views.” rather than an
other candidate, “a Goldwater
conservative who had pledged to
work with all elements of the
Republican Party,” violated Miss
Westerlund’s campaign pledge of
last fall.

promised, during her campaign,
“to maintain neutrality in state
political contests’ and not to favor
conservative Republican views
over liberal Republican views,
both of which were held by SAYR
members.
