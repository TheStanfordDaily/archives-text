## 'A Boy, an Axe.. .and a Cherry Tree' 
### HOWARD L. WEINBERG Contributing Editor 
“Why does Stanford celebrate George Washington’s birth
day as a holiday?’’ I asked.
Quick and clever and blonde, the Stanford coed said, “Don’t
you know who he was?”
I remembered the story of our country: A boy, an axe . . .
and a cherry tree. George Washington was a farmer, and not
only that—he was a Founder.
He was the Founder- of Our Country. Stanford has a fond
place in its inner courtyard for founders. Yes, it was only
natural that we should celebrate our Founder’s birthday.
But I remembered that Stanford didn’t declare Abraham
Lincoln’s birthday a holiday. At first this seemed incongruous.
After all, Stanford was not only founded, but organized. And if
Washington was the Founder of Our Country, then Lincoln was
the Organizer. And yet Lincoln involved himself in politics. He
did not rise above partisan squabbles. He was a Republican.
And for this he is not as honored as George Washington who,
though a Federalist, was in essence non partisan.
My questioning caused me some difficulty. I read the words
of President Sterling, who has characterized as “the true course
of a true university, . . . the freedom to question what has
been accepted as old truth at the same time as it probes the
unknown.” Encouraged, I persevered.
The Stanford motto is in German, “Die Luft der Freiheit,”
which the guide book says is usually translated as “The Wind of
Freedom Blows.” The words are from Ulrich von Hutten, a six
teenth century German poet, whom the buide book says was a
fighter for freedom. Something was wrong. Not only did the
quote seem lifted from Bartlett’s oV perhaps from the first
words of an unemployed German professor hired by David
Starr Jordan, but I recalled that the British had employed Hes
sian soldiers against George Washington in the Revolutionary
War.
And weren’t most mottos in Latin to withstand the tides of
history? And if in German, why not Goethe? But I was probing
the unknown too far. After all, I thought, a motto might have
been culled from an expression of an obscure nineteenth cen
tury coolie working on Leland Stanford’s railroad. How would
the guide book usually translate a motto in Chinese?
In my quest for truth I turned to the library. Many of my
questions were unanswered until I received the assistance of a
librarian who told me she could arrange an inter-library loan
and get most anything I wanted from Berkeley. I asked why
Stanford’s library didn’t have it. That opened a whole new field
of questions.
But the library was exhibiting The Founding Gi’ant, that
much talked about document which both benefltted and suffered
from being amended by Jane Lathrop Stanford who survived
her husband. Thank Jane that there is no cemetery or agricul
tural farm to restrict the growth of the University. But she
found other ways to accomplish much the same thing.
Generous as founders are, so were Leland and Jane who
wanted students to attend their memorial university free. Mrs.
Stanford said as late as October 3, 1902, “The University has
been endowed with a view of offering instruction free, or nearly
free, that it may resist the tendency to the stratification of
society, by keeping open an avenue whereby the deserving and
exceptional may rise through their own efforts from the lowest
to the highest stations in life.” This dream awaited the coming
of still another Founder, The Ford Foundation.
In Jhe actual body of The Founding Grant, dated November
11, 1885, article ton, point four stated one of the purposes was:
“To establish and have given at the university by its
ablest professors, courses of lectures upon the Science of
Government, and upon Law, Medicine and the Arts, and
Sciences which shall bo free to the postgraduates of the
Colleges of the University hereby founded, and to the post
graduates of all other colleges and universities, and to all
deserving persons, to the full capacity of the lecture-rooms,
under such rules and regulations as the Trustees may adopt.
I know the graduate students are paying despite the decree
of article ten, point four.
But what still is in effect is the desire of Mrs. Stanford that
the University forever be kept out of politics. Yet a close read
ing of this document, now on display outside the Humanities
Reference Room, seems to indicate she intended only that pro
fessors not speak at elections limes that neither faculty nor
students be influenced in their exercise of the vote. She asked
the professors if they agreed with her premise that it was not
common for university faculty members to speak on partisan
politics because of the chance that their own personal opinions
might be interpreted as the views of their university. On the
basis of her generalization, Mrs. Stanford “indulges in the hope”
that professors at Stanford will follow what she believes to be
the example of their colleagues at other universities.
To interpret Mrs. Stanford’s desire as a fixed rule, the
trustees must bo faithful to an obscurantist tradition if not
“consistent with Stanford’s motto.” Why not admit that Mrs.
Stanford’s words survive only for the sake of convenience?
The non-partisan rule saves University officials much embar
rassment. But wasn’t George Washington embarrassed with his
hatchet behind his back as ho stood near the fallen tree His
motto was simple: “I cannot tell a lie,” he said
