Last weekend in Fresno, Robert Gaston, a 31-year-old Los
Angeles attorney, gained control of the presidency of the 13,000-
member California Young Republicans organization. Gaston’s
victory at the two-day annual convention was complete: his can
didates won all hut two minor offices.
Ordinarily, Young Republican elections cause no unusual
amount of excitement or comment from the press. But this time
the newspaper headlines testified to the fact that this was no
ordinary election. Headlined the San Francisco “Examiner”:
ARCH CONSERVATIVES TAKE OVER YOUNG G.O.P. Like
wise, the “Chronicle”: RIGHT WINGERS SEIZE CONTROL OF
THE YOUNG G.O.P.
What was all the commotion about? The answer is simple:
Gaston, President in 1962 of the Los Angeles County Young Re
publicans, was elected YR state president with strong and vital
and decisive support from the John Birch Society. And Robert
Gaston had done nothing to disafliliate himself from the Birch
ers. Ho enthusiastically asked for Birch support, and welcomed
it when he got it.
The February 18 Western Edition of the “New York Times”
said that Gaston admitted that his candidacy had been supported
(“as an individual”) by ex-Congressman John Rousselot of
southern California. Rousselot, defeated last November, was
recently appointed the Society’s “Western Governor” by Birch
chief Robert Welch.
“I welcome the John Birch Society’s help,” Gaston said.
Two of John Rousselot’s “top lieutenants,” according to the
“Chronicle,” were “both active in the convention maneuvers.”
But the question as to whether the new Young Republican
president is “Birch or not Birch” is not really the point at issue.
For simply being "not Birch” does not automatically turn Robert
Gaston into a good Republican and a respectable politician any
more than being “Birch” would necessarily make him persona
non grata.
Rather, it is something else which is more disturbing about
the new President of the CYRs. What worried me most about
Robert Gaston and his supporters as I observed them in action
for two days in Fresno was their attitude toward politics in gen
eral and the Republican Party in particular.
The Gastonite “attitude” was best revealed during Gaston’s
campaign. An example of the “attitude” was the official Gaston
slogan, much in evidence at the Convention: "No Compromise!!
Vote Gaston!” Also significant was the chief Gaston hand-out
sheet, which concluded with this phrase: “We must demonstrate
to all Democrats and moderates that Conservatism and Repub
licanism are synonomous.”
What Mr. Gaston means here is all too clear. He has, in
effect, redefined Republicanism to exclude all moderates and to
include only those Conservatives who accept the Gaston defini
tion of “conservative.”
In their acceptance speeches Sunday, several of the Gaston
ite candidates expressed the hope that all Young Republicans
might now “unite” behind the new administration. Gaston him
self felt confident that “factionalism will cease within the Young
Republicans.” Having fought hard (Gaston traveled 25,000 miles
before the convention and personally talked to all delegates who
supported him) and having been held to have violated no laws
in winning. Mr. Gaston expects that 1963 will find him con
trolling a unified organization.
But it is possible that Bob Gaston may prove to be a poor
prophet. Gaston might find that a large number of Young Re
publicans are not going to sit back and be told that their brand
of Republicanism is not “acceptable.” There are a strong num
ber—a majority, I believe—of California Republicans who con
sider themselves moderates and who do not intend to follow
Gaston’s lead in scrapping the party of Eisenhower and Nixon
for the “party” of ex-Congressman Rousselot and ex-candy
maker Welch.
Hopefully, Bob Gaston will modify his views now that ho
has won his election. Perhaps his “No Compromise” statements
were merely political deceptions to capture the Birch vote at the
Convention, along with the Birch money before the Convention.
Perhaps Gaston will cool down a bit and make room again for
moderates in the California Young Republicans.
Hopefully Gaston will do this, and will by doing so realize
that compromise is and must continue to be the essence of intra
party politics. But should Gaston not reverse his position, he
may find himself losing financial and membership support from
important segments of the CYR organization. Gaston must
realize that a narrow 189-170 victory does not give him an over
whelming mandate to recreate the Young Republicans in his
image.
Republican moderates intend to follow the advice of out
going YR President Harry Keaton and give Gaston a chance to
show what he will do.
But should Gaston actually put his position of “No Com
promise” into effect, then Republican moderates need no longer
feel bound to give him and the YR organization any more than
the most minimal perfunctory support.
If this happens, the Gastonites surely will brand the moder
ates “sore losers,” and accuse them of “treason,” or what have
you. But is it being a “sore loser” to refuse to support a man
who himself refuses to compromise? I think not.
Time will show what Gaston will do. As a Republican moder
ate. I can only hope that Gaston’s new responsibilities as CYR
President will help him to grow up.
