One of the most popular institutions of the young intellec
tuals of France is the “cine club’’—groups of students gathering
together to view and analyze a film of cinemagraphic or con
tent value. Each province—and above all, Paris—abound in these
clubs, all of which are well attended. And on an informal basis,
Stanford University’s campus at Tours, France has initiated its
own film club.
As a film of special interest comes to Tours, the eighty
students from Stanford, and the French and English members
of the “English Circle” of the branch of the University of Poi
tiers at Tours, go to see the film. A week to ten days is allowed
for all to see the chosen film; then the “film club” meets. The
French and English students come to the Stanford campus for
dinner, after which all participate in student-led discussion
groups on the film.
When the film is in French, discussion is in English, and vice
versa. All dinnertime conversation is in French, as is after-dis
cussion coffee-time.
The first conference was based upon “Le Jour Le Plus
Long,” the American film “The Longest Day” which has a
dubbed-in French sound track, and has achieved great popularity
in France. The film deals with the Allied taking of the beaches
of Normandy.
The second conference utilized the film adaptation of Fran
cois Mauriac’s renowned noved, “Therese Desqueyroux,” the
story of a woman who, trapped in the bourgeois world of her
insensitive husband, attempts to poison him. Mauriac is well
known for his religious philosophy, and posed in his work
several classic questions of value judgment.
After dinner, the French-English-American group gathered
in the Stanford library for a lecture in French on the film/novel
by Stanford-in-France director Paul Le Moal. LeMoal is also Pro
fessor of Literature at the University of Poitiers.
following the lecture, the students divided up among the
classrooms for their discussions. One of the five French classes
at the Stanford Center had used the Mauriac novel for 10 weeks
of literary analysis, and it was students from this class that led
the discussions in each group. Topics of discussion ranged from
lectures by the Fi’ench students on the validity of the image of
the French bourgeoisie presented by Mauriac, to the question of
which of the principal characters Mauriac was condemning, to
whether an adaptation of a novel can be an independent work of
art, or must only recreate the book faithfully.

One of the most popular institutions of the young intellec
tuals of France is the “cine club’’—groups of students gathering
together to view and analyze a film of cinemagraphic or con
tent value. Each province—and above all, Paris—abound in these
clubs, all of which are well attended. And on an informal basis,
Stanford University’s campus at Tours, France has initiated its
own film club.
As a film of special interest comes to Tours, the eighty
students from Stanford, and the French and English members
of the “English Circle” of the branch of the University of Poi
tiers at Tours, go to see the film. A week to ten days is allowed
for all to see the chosen film; then the “film club” meets. The
French and English students come to the Stanford campus for
dinner, after which all participate in student-led discussion
groups on the film.
When the film is in French, discussion is in English, and vice
versa. All dinnertime conversation is in French, as is after-dis
cussion coffee-time.
The first conference was based upon “Le Jour Le Plus
Long,” the American film “The Longest Day” which has a
dubbed-in French sound track, and has achieved great popularity
in France. The film deals with the Allied taking of the beaches
of Normandy.
The second conference utilized the film adaptation of Fran
cois Mauriac’s renowned noved, “Therese Desqueyroux,” the
story of a woman who, trapped in the bourgeois world of her
insensitive husband, attempts to poison him. Mauriac is well
known for his religious philosophy, and posed in his work
several classic questions of value judgment.
After dinner, the French-English-American group gathered
in the Stanford library for a lecture in French on the film/novel
by Stanford-in-France director Paul Le Moal. LeMoal is also Pro
fessor of Literature at the University of Poitiers.
following the lecture, the students divided up among the
classrooms for their discussions. One of the five French classes
at the Stanford Center had used the Mauriac novel for 10 weeks
of literary analysis, and it was students from this class that led
the discussions in each group. Topics of discussion ranged from
lectures by the Fi’ench students on the validity of the image of
the French bourgeoisie presented by Mauriac, to the question of
which of the principal characters Mauriac was condemning, to
whether an adaptation of a novel can be an independent work of
art, or must only recreate the book faithfully.
