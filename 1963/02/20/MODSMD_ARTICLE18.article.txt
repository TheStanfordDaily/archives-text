## New Psychology of Peace Needed —War No Longer Feasible Today 
### PELL FENDER 
In the* past nations have sought to resolve international conflicts
hy war. The result has always been multilateral suffering and
issues virtually unsolved. In fact past history has shown little other
justification for war than, as Canon L. John Collins phrased, “in
dividual or national paranoia.” Now war is unfeasible; there is no

rationale for war. We are
with truly ultimate weapons, and
exchanging thoughtless interna-
I tional threats of using these
I weapons.
FOB WE ARE dealing with nu
clear weapons, weapons against
which no human being can de-
I fend himself. Bomb shelters,
'Civil Defense, and evacuation
! routes are only theoretically prae
j (leal and will, at best, only pro
j long human life for a lew more
i moments, should one nation use
the horror of a nuclear attack
against another nation. Perhaps
only the military, fighting on a
different front, will escape to
fight the war; thus a nation with
out citizens.
Therefore man must develop
the ultimate and final attitude to
! match the implications of the ul
j iimate and perhaps, final weap
on.
First of all all people must ac
cept the fact that war, particu
larly nuclear war, is not the so
lution to differences which exist
between nations. Further, man
must accept the sanctity of hu
man life.
FOR THE ETHIC that “thou
shalt not kill” does not apply
j only to the Christian religion.
From the soul of every man has
j come the realization that the in
j dividual human life is sacrosanct.
For the world is constituted of
human beings, all of whom have
the same hurts, the same fears,
all of whom have the same de
sire to love and be loved. The abo
ut ion of nuclear weapons and the
abolition of war transcend na
tional sovereignty. In this light
there is no “good guy” and “bad
guy.’ No human being desires to
be annihilated.
The world must then, as a pos
sible solution to the now intense
nationalism of the world, aban-
I don the sovereignty of nations,
j In the place of national sover
j eignty, the world must deal with
its internal problems much as a
| family settles its problems.
THIS CALLS lor a reformed
I psychology of international af
j fairs. But imagine a world in
which one nation sought to settle
a conflict because its conscience
moved it, rather than the present
practice of a nation waiting until
! advantageous conditions and ul
terior motives prod it to act. If
a nation truly wants peace, then
let it show this desire by acting
j without the motive of deriving
, some benefit out of its actions.
This view, which is part of the
I pacifist view, has been termed

super-ideal. And by present
modes of thought, admittedly,
this view is ideal. But World War
I and World War II have shown
us that accepted solutions to in
ternational conflicts have proved
temporary, and ineffectual.
A new psychology of peace
must evolve. Man can abolish
wars. True peace, peace from
distrust and fear, can exist. But
it had better come soon. Soon
mankind must reactivate the
plea, “Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you.”
