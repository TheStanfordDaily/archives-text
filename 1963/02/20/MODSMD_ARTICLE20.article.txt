# Bruin-Indian Game May Decide AAWU Scramble
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Supremacy in the AAWU is at
stake tomorrow night, when
league-leading Stanford faces top
contender UCLA In the Pavilion.
Game time is 8 p.m.
Stanford currently has a 5-3
league record, just a short way
ahead of Washington (6-4) and
UCLA (3-3). The Huskies can bo
counted out because their two

! remaining games are away from
j home, against Cal in Harmon
Gym, and against UCLA in Los
Angeles. Washington notoriously
has trouble winning away from
,lhe homey confines of Edmund
son Pavilion. So the struggle is
between Stanford and UCLA, and
tomorrow night’s game may be
the determining factor.
STANFORD’S fortunes are
i buoyed up by the return of Dar
rell Sutherland to the lineup aft
j era week’s absence due to a
; hairline fracture in his left arm.
He was submarined by UCLA
forward Jack Hirsch two weeks
ago.
Sutherland seems to save his
j best for the Bruins. Last year he
stopped the Bruins with a 30-
point performance that led Stan
j ford to an 82-67 victory. And two
| weeks ago he fired seven shots
! through the net in 10 trys to end
| a personal slump and give Stan
ford the momentum to edge past
the Bruins 86-78.
Sutherland won’t start, but his
presence will provide a psycho
j logical lift. Coach Howie Dallmar
( plans to start Kent Hinckley at
j guard with Don Clemetson.
| Hinckley has perhaps the best
outside shooting eye on the team,
[ and has adjusted well to guard
i after playing forward all his life.
| Sutherland is ready, willing and
able to go into action, and here's
hoping he’s kept his shooting eye.
CLEMETSON, who last week

was chosen Northern California
Player of the Week for the third
time, draws the unenviable task
of guarding Walt Hazzard, every
one’s All-AAWU guard, most peo
ple’s All-American, and probably
the most valuable player in the
conference. Hazzard’s value to
his team is shown by the fact that
his 27-point performance against
the Cards two weeks ago was one

of his worst games of 1963.
Stanford probably won’t use a
full-court press against UCLA. A
slick ball-handler like Hazzard in
vites the press, as does Clemet
son. A Hazzard or Clemetson will
wait for the defender and break
past him toward the basket. An
easy lay-in or a slick pass is the
inevitable result.
Tom Dose will start at center
for Stanford and nothing need be
said about him. He is a cinch to
be named All-AAWU center, and
doubtless will pick up some All-
American votes. He leads the
AAWU in rebounding, and is
third in scoring.
DOSE’S OPPOSING center will
doubtless be Fred Slaughter, the
leaping bruiser who bulls his way
to so many tip-ins. UCLA came
close to Stanford two weeks ago
because of the Bruin offensive
rebounding. Stanford made its
first shot. UCLA continued to
miss the first shot but would
score on a tip-in.
Slaughter also has a dangerous
jump shot from the free throw
line, but is weak in defense. Con
sequently, UCLA will sag back
to prevent the high lob pass to
Dose.
The Stanford and UCLA for
wards play basketball similarly
and should cancel each other out.
Stanford’s Clayton Raaka, Bob
Sommers and Hollis Moore, and
UCLA’s Keith Ericson and Jack
Hirsch are strong rebounders and
tenacious defenders, but have
trouble scoring away from the
basket.


WALT HAZZARD, UCLA forward-guard, playmaker-scorer-rebounder

CLEMETSON, who last week

was chosen Northern California
Player of the Week for the third
time, draws the unenviable task
of guarding Walt Hazzard, every
one’s All-AAWU guard, most peo
ple’s All-American, and probably
the most valuable player in the
conference. Hazzard’s value to
his team is shown by the fact that
his 27-point performance against
the Cards two weeks ago was one

of his worst games of 1963.
Stanford probably won’t use a
full-court press against UCLA. A
slick ball-handler like Hazzard in
vites the press, as does Clemet
son. A Hazzard or Clemetson will
wait for the defender and break
past him toward the basket. An
easy lay-in or a slick pass is the
inevitable result.
Tom Dose will start at center
for Stanford and nothing need be
said about him. He is a cinch to
be named All-AAWU center, and
doubtless will pick up some All-
American votes. He leads the
AAWU in rebounding, and is
third in scoring.
DOSE’S OPPOSING center will
doubtless be Fred Slaughter, the
leaping bruiser who bulls his way
to so many tip-ins. UCLA came
close to Stanford two weeks ago
because of the Bruin offensive
rebounding. Stanford made its
first shot. UCLA continued to
miss the first shot but would
score on a tip-in.
Slaughter also has a dangerous
jump shot from the free throw
line, but is weak in defense. Con
sequently, UCLA will sag back
to prevent the high lob pass to
Dose.
The Stanford and UCLA for
wards play basketball similarly
and should cancel each other out.
Stanford’s Clayton Raaka, Bob
Sommers and Hollis Moore, and
UCLA’s Keith Ericson and Jack
Hirsch are strong rebounders and
tenacious defenders, but have

basket.
