Stanford's lop swimming event
of the year, indeed northern Cali
fornia’s top swimming event, will
he held at Encina Pool on Satur
day at 2 p.m., when the In
dians meet powerful U.S.C.
Last year the Trojans were sec
ond to Ohio State in the national
rankings. Murray Rose, often
called the best swimmer in the
world, has graduated hut two ex
cellent new - comers more I han
compensate for his absence. Fel
low Australian Jon Konrads, who
holds all the world records in the
freestyle events over 200 meters,
is now a member of the U.S.C.
squad. Konrads is joined by an
other first-year performer. Bob
Bennett, the world record holder
in the 100 yard backstroke and a
member of the 1 960 Olympic
team. The remaining members of
the squad demonstrate both depth
and excellence.
If the Trojans can discover or
develop two divers who exceed
mediocrity, with the addition of
Konrads and Bennett they should
have an excellent chance of win
ning the national championship
in the NCAA finals this spring.
Clearly U.S.C. has an ex
tremely strong team, but where
does this leave Stanford. It would
seem that this meet will be a Tro
jan walkaway, displaying little for

spectator Interest. However, such
is not the case. Though the In
dians cannot match Southern Cali
fornia in over-all team strength,
Stanford swimmers Marty Hull,
Illka Suvanto, Paul Halt, Mike
Doscher and Pete Pettigrew are
well able to meet the challenge of
U.S.C.’s ablest athletes.
The Indians may be defeated
on total points, hut there will bo
excellent races, especially those
beween Suvanto and Konrads,
and since competition always
stimulates performance, national
and world records may well be
broken.
There will be an admission
charge of 50 cents for Stanford
students and $1.50 for all others.
It is suggested that those plan
ning to attend, should arrive early
at Encina Pool to assure the pur
chase of a good seat, or any seat
at all, for when USC last com
peted at Stanford, three years
ago, the seating accommodations
were filled well before the start
of the first race.
On Friday the Indians warm
up for U.S.C. by hosting the Uni
versity of Utah in a dual meet.
The Utes were surprisingly
strong last year; Stanford was
victorious by but seven points.
Top Utah swimmer is Clint
Shultz, who competes in both the
butterfly and the freestyle middle
distance events.
