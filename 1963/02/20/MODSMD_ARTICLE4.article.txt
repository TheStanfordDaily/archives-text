# Prof Analyzes Free Decision
## 
### STEPHEN LEOPOLD 
“Because we can have no abso
j lute concept of causality in any
I so called free decision, we cannot
possibly make an ultimate analy
sis of freedom,” declared profes
sor Patrick C. Suppcs, director of
the institute for mathematical
studies in social sciences, last
night, in a Freedom Series lecture
at Tresidder Union.
Suppes expressed the opinion
that philosophers have been “bad
ly corrupted” by the classical phy
sicists’ proposal that cause and
effect are strictly regulated. He
quickly pointed out that although
causal analysis is probably the
only valid method of understand
ing the movement of the solar
system, this method is much too
rigid for analyzing human action.
COMPULSION is one cause in
| human action that limits freedom
in decisions. If there is only one
| action open to a person that will
! give him some benefit, then he
will logically take it. But if there
| are two or more profitable alter
| natives, then the person does in
-1 deed have a free decision to make.
It is unfortunate, however, that
philosophers “cannot give any
satisfactory analysis as to which
internal human causes are com
pulsory and which are not,"
Suppes concluded.
