United Press International
WASHINGTON—A former president of the Cuban Senate told
a congressional hearing yesterday that the Russians have set up
secret bases in Brazil and Paraguay. The claim was made by Dr.
Manuel deVarona who said he had hoard of the Soviet operation
from “well-informed sources in Vienna.” The anti-Castro refugee
said he understood that both bases appeared to have airstrips that
could accommodate large planes.
In his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommit
tee on Latin America. De Varona also said that only military action
led by the United States "can liberate Cuba and restore peace to
the hemisphere.” DeVarona, who was Cuba’s prime minister from
1948 to 1950. did not specifically call for an invasion but ho com
mented that other Latin American countries would understand if
the United States sent armed forces into Cuba.
The witness attached no significance to reports that the Rus
sians will soon pull several thousand more roops out of Cuba. While
one contingent leaves, he said, another group could come in.
RUSSIANS DELAY TEST TALKS— GENEVA—The gulf deepened
between East and West on the nuclear test ban issue yesterday as
the Soviet Union offered the West a non-aggression pact in a move
Western officials denounced as sheer Kremlin stalling. "It had ab
solutely nothing to do with the business at hand, that of writing a
nuclear test ban treaty,” a conference source said of the Russian
proposal.
U.S. chief negotiator William C. Foster departed to report to
President Kennedy on the deadlocked disarmament talks after mak
ing anoher vain effort to budge the Russians from their take-lt-or
leave-it terms for a test ban treaty. But the official U.S. delegation
spokesman denied reports that Foster had lowered demands on test
ban terms. The United States has been insisting on eight to ton on
site inspections a year on Soviet territory to investigate any sus
picious blasts, while the Russians refuse to budge from their top
limit of three such inspections.
U.S. REJECTS RIVAL TRADE PROPOSAL WASHINGTON
Undersecretary of State George W. Ball yesterdey vetoed any move
for U.S. backing of a special trading bloc competitive with the Euro
pean Common Market. Ball rejected the notion of a rival trade bloc
to counter the French-dominated European Economic Community
(EECI in a letter to Sen. Paul H. Douglas, D-111. "We do not believe
that this would be sound policy,” Ball wrote. “For us to enter into
preferential trading relations with any nation or nations would
moan discrimination against all other nations.”
