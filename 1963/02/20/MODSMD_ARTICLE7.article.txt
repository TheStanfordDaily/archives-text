# Former San Quentin Warden Duffy Tells Capital Punishment Injustices
## 
### WILLIAM REID 
“A man docs not die for the
cause he committed it in the wn
of that state, or at the wrong tii
jury or judge.” This was the es:
at Tresidder Union last night.

■ crime he commits. He dies bc-
state, or in the wrong county
me, or because he faced a tough
scnce of Clinton Duffy’s lecture
Duffy was the warden of San
♦Quentin Prison for 12 years and
is the author of the book. “88
Men and 2 Women,” the story of
those executed while he was war
den.
Duffy related the history of
capital punishment in California
and the change which has taken
place in these prisons—the em
phasis on punishment changing
to rehabilitation and retraining.
Some of his innovations are
schools covering grades 1
through 12, debate teams, and
the installation of union shops
within the prison, such as the
machinists.
THE FIRST argument he used
was that capital punishment is
not a deterrent to crime. Duffy
has asked every prisoner he has
come in contact with whether
they had considered the death
penalty before they committed
their crimes, and each had an
swered, “No.”

Duffy also said (hat he, and all
other wardens to whom he has
spoken, had never known a
wealthy person to have been ex
ecuted. Furthermore, he argued,
if an innocent person were killed,
there is no way to rectify it.
Duffy lastly declared that the
state does not have the right of
judgment on an individual’s life.
TO CLARIFY his point Duffy
told of several prisoners he had
known who, he felt, were execut
ed unjustly. Caryl Chessman was
among those he cited as exam
ples. Duffy also gave the details
of the various forms of death
penalty in current use across the
nation and their “gruesome”
qualities.
In the question and ansvrer
session which followed the talk,
Duffy indicated the parole sys
tem he prefers: a gradual release
program and sentences which all
give a chance for a parole. He
said that the two types of pris
oners statistically safest to parole
were those who were sentenced
for life and the sex offenders.

Howard of the Civil Liberties

Caucus attended a fireside at the
Solo Lounge in Wilbur,

ples. Duffy also gave the details
of the various forms of death
penalty in current use across the
nation and their “gruesome”
qualities.
In the question and ansvrer
session which followed the talk,
Duffy indicated the parole sys
tem he prefers: a gradual release
program and sentences which all
give a chance for a parole. He
said that the two types of pris
oners statistically safest to parole
were those who were sentenced
for life and the sex offenders.
After (he talk Duffy and John
Howard of the Civil Liberties

Caucus attended a fireside at the
Solo Lounge in Wilbur,
“A man docs not die for the
cause he committed it in the wn
of that state, or at the wrong tii
jury or judge.” This was the es:
at Tresidder Union last night.

■ crime he commits. He dies bc-
state, or in the wrong county
me, or because he faced a tough
scnce of Clinton Duffy’s lecture
Duffy was the warden of San
♦Quentin Prison for 12 years and
is the author of the book. “88
Men and 2 Women,” the story of
those executed while he was war
den.
Duffy related the history of
capital punishment in California
and the change which has taken
place in these prisons—the em
phasis on punishment changing
to rehabilitation and retraining.
Some of his innovations are
schools covering grades 1
through 12, debate teams, and
the installation of union shops
within the prison, such as the
machinists.
THE FIRST argument he used
was that capital punishment is
not a deterrent to crime. Duffy
has asked every prisoner he has
come in contact with whether
they had considered the death
penalty before they committed
their crimes, and each had an
swered, “No.”

Duffy also said (hat he, and all
other wardens to whom he has
spoken, had never known a
wealthy person to have been ex
ecuted. Furthermore, he argued,
if an innocent person were killed,
there is no way to rectify it.
Duffy lastly declared that the
state does not have the right of
judgment on an individual’s life.
TO CLARIFY his point Duffy
told of several prisoners he had
known who, he felt, were execut
ed unjustly. Caryl Chessman was
among those he cited as exam
ples. Duffy also gave the details
of the various forms of death
penalty in current use across the

qualities.
