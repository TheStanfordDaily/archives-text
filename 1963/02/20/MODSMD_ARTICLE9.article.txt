# Plans Underway for New Library
## 
### KATHY FARGO 
Plans for a new and separate undergraduate
library are well under way. The new library, when
i completed, will eliminate the crowding in the main
| library, allow the main library to be adapted and
! improved for graduate research, and provide books
j and services especially suited to the Stanford
1 undergraduate.
ACCORDING TO THE present plans, the new
library will have a floor area of 85.000 square feel
on three levels with a seating capacity of 1500
students. The building will be constructed over
Escondido Road and will be located so that stu
dents will have access to the library on different
levels from the street, the bookstore, and the
main library. John Warneke of San Francisco is
the architect.
Elmer M. Grieder, director of the library, said
he hoped that plans would develop sufficiently to
begin construction in four or five years.
THE NEW LIBRARY will not be merely a copy
| of another university’s library. According to Orie
| der, it will be a “Stanford-oriented library." The
cataloging system, for example, is being devised
not only to make it easy to find books but also
to group books on related subjects according to
; the way in which the subjects are treated in the
University. The types of hooks in the library will
also reflect Stanford’s idea of a broad under
graduate education. The bulk of the books and
periodicals on math and the sciences will be in
cluded in the collection because of their impor
-1 lance in the concept of a liberal education.

ALTHOUGH THE NEW library will bo de
signed specifically to serve the needs of the under
graduate, students will also be encouraged to use
the main library, which will be converted into a
research library.
The new library, which will have space for
150.000 books, will start wih an initial collection
of 60,000 books and 300 periodicals. The number of
books will be built up rapidly during the first
years. Tentative plans include a simple classifi
cation system, as much freedom of access to books
as possible within the library, and a system of
control at the entrances.
A COMMITTEE OF both faculty member’s and
librarians will confer on the selection of books.
Each undergraduate department will select a fac
ulty representative to help choose the initial col
lection.
A complete music and language listening room
will be provided in the building, and possibly the
reserve book room and the Wesern Civ library
will also be moved to the new library.
When the new library is built, the main li
brary will be improved for graduate use. Two
more levels of stack may be added on the ground
floor under the stairs, and amicrotext reading
room and bettor map room will also be provided.
With the extra space there will be more room for
private study cubicles for graduate students and
air-conditioned space for special collections.

siy library system, when complete, w’ould make
Stanford a book-oriented campus.

Stanford a book-oriented campus.
Plans for a new and separate undergraduate
library are well under way. The new library, when
i completed, will eliminate the crowding in the main
| library, allow the main library to be adapted and
! improved for graduate research, and provide books
j and services especially suited to the Stanford
1 undergraduate.
ACCORDING TO THE present plans, the new
library will have a floor area of 85.000 square feel
on three levels with a seating capacity of 1500
students. The building will be constructed over
Escondido Road and will be located so that stu
dents will have access to the library on different
levels from the street, the bookstore, and the
main library. John Warneke of San Francisco is
the architect.
Elmer M. Grieder, director of the library, said
he hoped that plans would develop sufficiently to
begin construction in four or five years.
THE NEW LIBRARY will not be merely a copy
| of another university’s library. According to Orie
| der, it will be a “Stanford-oriented library." The
cataloging system, for example, is being devised
not only to make it easy to find books but also
to group books on related subjects according to
; the way in which the subjects are treated in the
University. The types of hooks in the library will
also reflect Stanford’s idea of a broad under
graduate education. The bulk of the books and
periodicals on math and the sciences will be in
cluded in the collection because of their impor
-1 lance in the concept of a liberal education.

ALTHOUGH THE NEW library will bo de
signed specifically to serve the needs of the under
graduate, students will also be encouraged to use
the main library, which will be converted into a
research library.
The new library, which will have space for
150.000 books, will start wih an initial collection
of 60,000 books and 300 periodicals. The number of
books will be built up rapidly during the first
years. Tentative plans include a simple classifi
cation system, as much freedom of access to books
as possible within the library, and a system of
control at the entrances.
A COMMITTEE OF both faculty member’s and
librarians will confer on the selection of books.
Each undergraduate department will select a fac
ulty representative to help choose the initial col
lection.
A complete music and language listening room
will be provided in the building, and possibly the
reserve book room and the Wesern Civ library
will also be moved to the new library.
When the new library is built, the main li
brary will be improved for graduate use. Two
more levels of stack may be added on the ground
floor under the stairs, and amicrotext reading
room and bettor map room will also be provided.
With the extra space there will be more room for
private study cubicles for graduate students and
air-conditioned space for special collections.
