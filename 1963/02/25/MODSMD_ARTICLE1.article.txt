### 
The Senate of the Associated
Students of the University of
Oregon passed a resolution last
Thursday reaffirming the Stan
ford Legislature’s stand on speak
ing out on public issues, accord
ing to The Daily Emerald, the
campus newspaper.
The resolution states; “A uni
versity by its very nature is dedi
cated to the free expression of
ideas by faculty members and
students alike, and one function
of student organizations is to pro
vide an outlet for the expression
of student opinion.”
Another section of the resolu
tion declares that “it is contrary
to the ideals of a university for
administrators to attempt to cur
tail the free expression of ideas
and opinions by student organiza
tions and their officers.”
The vote was nearly unani
mous, The Emerald said, with the
only objections coming on pro
cedural issues, no t the subject
matter of the bill. Copies of the
resolution will be sent to the trus
tees of Stanford University, Pres
ident J. E. Wallace Sterling, and
Student Body President Armin
Rosencranz.
The Emerald quoted Gary New
ton. co-chairman of the committee
that submitted the bill, as saying,
“The incident at Stanford sets a
precedent for the curtailment of
free speech. It is not confined to
the Stanford campus, but con
cerns all universities in general.”
At Oregon a resolution of the
“KPFA” type would not attract
any warnings from the Dean of
Students, Any campus group at
the University of Oregon can
sponsor a speaker, political or
non-political. Last year Gus Hall,
editor of The Worker, spoke on
campus, and this year Harry
Bridges, left-winging West Coast
labor leader, is scheduled to talk.
