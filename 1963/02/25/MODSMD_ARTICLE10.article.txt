### 
United Press International
MOGADISHU, Somali—Wild demonstrations directed against
the American and Ethiopian embassies erupted yesterday in this
capital city after news we I'eceived of armed clashes between
British troops and Somalis in a disputed area on the Kenya border.
The border clashes, in which 24 persons were reported wounded,
broke out last Wednesday, but news of the fighting reached here
only Saturday night. The reports said 47 Somalis were arrested
there.
Although neither the United States nor Ethopia was directly
involved in the Kenya border dispute, Ethiopia has been under fire
here for more than two years because it holds other lands claimed by
Somalia. The United States has been accused of furnishing weapons
to Ethiopia while refusing to provide arms to Somalia.
MANSFIELD RESPONDS TO CASTRO ATTACK WASHINGTON
—Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield fired back at Cuban
Premier Fidel Castro yesterday and said there are “Castro fifth
columns” in many Latin American countries. Mansfield replied to a
Castro attack on U.S. senators as Sen. Hugh Scott R-Pa., called for
a total quarantine of Cuba except for food and said this would “get
rid of the Russians” there.
Castro said in a Saturday night speech that the United States is
afraid of Cuba and has “an empire to lose” if it tries to destroy his
regime. He denied Cuba was reporting subversion to the rest of the
hemisphere. “We want to ask the Yankee governors and senators:
If Cuba is not attractive to other hemisphere nations why are you
so worried about Cuba,” Castro said.
Commenting on the Castro remarks, Mansfield told United
Press International that the premier was “parroting” the Russian
line announced by Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Rodion Malinov
sky who warned any attack on Cuba would touch off World War 111.
U.S. TROOPS IN SOUTH VIET NAM MAY FIGHT OFFENSIVELY
-SAIGON—The United States has finally decided to permit its
soldiers, in some instances, to shoot first without waiting to be
fired on by Communist Viet Cong guerrillas. The move is aimed at
checking the mounting U.S. casualty rate in the war in South Viet
Nam. A U.S. Army machinegunner was killed Sunday when guer
rillas downed two helicopters.
Under the more relaxed “rules of engagement,” according to in
formed military sources, the U.S. Army’s new heavily armed HU-1
gas turbine helicopters will be able to open fire on any “positively
identified’ guerrillas without waiting to be fired on first.
COMMUNISTS DENY DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AFRICAN
STUDENTS- MOSCOW Soviet Educational authorities said yester
day that Western charges of discrimination against Afro-Asian stu
dents in Communist universities were nothing more than “intrigue”
and propaganda.
Pavel Kerzin, rector of Moscow's Patrice Lumumba Friendship
University which 2.000 foreign students attend claimed that Amer
ican, British and West German propagandists were trying to scare
off students from going to Socialist countries.
Reports and charges abroad of unrest among African students
in Communist universities have been mounting since the exodus of
African students from Bulgaria. Soviet authorities brought forward
over the weekend Lumumba students who declared that they had
encountered neither racism in the Soviet union nor excessive politi
cal indoctrination.

COMMUNISTS DENY DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AFRICAN
STUDENTS- MOSCOW Soviet Educational authorities said yester
day that Western charges of discrimination against Afro-Asian stu
dents in Communist universities were nothing more than “intrigue”
and propaganda.
Pavel Kerzin, rector of Moscow's Patrice Lumumba Friendship
University which 2.000 foreign students attend claimed that Amer
ican, British and West German propagandists were trying to scare
off students from going to Socialist countries.
Reports and charges abroad of unrest among African students
in Communist universities have been mounting since the exodus of
African students from Bulgaria. Soviet authorities brought forward
over the weekend Lumumba students who declared that they had
encountered neither racism in the Soviet union nor excessive politi
cal indoctrination.
United Press International
MOGADISHU, Somali—Wild demonstrations directed against
the American and Ethiopian embassies erupted yesterday in this
capital city after news we I'eceived of armed clashes between
British troops and Somalis in a disputed area on the Kenya border.
The border clashes, in which 24 persons were reported wounded,
broke out last Wednesday, but news of the fighting reached here
only Saturday night. The reports said 47 Somalis were arrested
there.
Although neither the United States nor Ethopia was directly
involved in the Kenya border dispute, Ethiopia has been under fire
here for more than two years because it holds other lands claimed by
Somalia. The United States has been accused of furnishing weapons
to Ethiopia while refusing to provide arms to Somalia.
MANSFIELD RESPONDS TO CASTRO ATTACK WASHINGTON
—Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield fired back at Cuban
Premier Fidel Castro yesterday and said there are “Castro fifth
columns” in many Latin American countries. Mansfield replied to a
Castro attack on U.S. senators as Sen. Hugh Scott R-Pa., called for
a total quarantine of Cuba except for food and said this would “get
rid of the Russians” there.
Castro said in a Saturday night speech that the United States is
afraid of Cuba and has “an empire to lose” if it tries to destroy his
regime. He denied Cuba was reporting subversion to the rest of the
hemisphere. “We want to ask the Yankee governors and senators:
If Cuba is not attractive to other hemisphere nations why are you
so worried about Cuba,” Castro said.
Commenting on the Castro remarks, Mansfield told United
Press International that the premier was “parroting” the Russian
line announced by Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Rodion Malinov
sky who warned any attack on Cuba would touch off World War 111.
