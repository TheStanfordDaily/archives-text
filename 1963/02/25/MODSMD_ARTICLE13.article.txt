## Atlantic Alliance Will Survive 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Washington, which is stunned and dazed by General De
Gaulle’s actions, is still reacting instinctively rather than de
liberately. In excluding Britain and in seeking to expel America
from Europe, the General has struck a blow at the foundations
of American post-war policy.
The first reaction to this radical strike against ideas and
policies which had come to be regarded as part of the nature of
things was to deny that General De Gaulle had changed any
thing—or to avow that he could not change anything because
history and destiny were working for our ideas and our policies
—or to try to improvise in a hurry some projects which would
tempt and seduce the wayward General or, failing that, would
circumvent him.
Nothing much is likely, it seems to me, to come of those in
stinctive reactions. There is to be sure some truth in each of
them. Thus in the long run the Atlantic Community, which has
been a controlling fact for three centuries, will reassert its in
fluence on national purposes. The geography and the history
which unites the people on the two sides of the Atlantic will
prevail over all other considerations in the long run. There is
also truth in the feeling that, since Europe and America cannot
go their separate ways, they will eventually devise, because they
have to, some kind of working partnership.
None of this should close our eyes to the momentous fact
that the partnership which we have assumed to be existing has
in fact been struck a shattering blow.
The heart of the situation is that Western Europe has out
grown the dependence upon America who began with the First
World War, Western Europe will not, theiefore, accept any
longer American leadership and dominance in European affairs.
This is the new reality upon which General De Gaulle is acting,
and it is to this new reality that we must perforce adjust our
foreign policy.
The new reality has been in the making for about 10 years.
Into it have gone the great changes in the military balance of
power between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. ... the brilliant re
covery of Western Europe . . . the depletion of the United
States’ gold reserves and the decline of the United States from
its financial pre-eminence ... the failure of the United States
under two Presidents to cope successfully with a chronic slug
glishness which contrasts so vividly with the exuberant ex
pansion of Western Europe . . . the recognition in Moscow
that the balance of military power is so favorable to the West
that the cold war cannot be waged aggressively in Europe.
The net sum of these contributing factors is that in relation
not only to the protecting power of the United States, but also to
the unfriendly power of the Soviet Union, Western Europe is in
the ascendant. Its economic and political power is increasing; the
military threat to its security is declining. And so, except in the
event of an improbable military explosion, Western Europe is
much less dependent on the United States than it has been for
nearly 50 years.
If what has changed is the relation of the world powers,
then the question is how to draw the right practical conclusions
from the changed situation. Our discussions with General De
Gaulle will have to turn upon whether’ he or - we can draw the
right conclusions from the new reality.
The best way, indeed the only way, for us to test the ques
tion is to relax and to let it become the problem of our European
friends to decide the basic question. The basic question is where,
in the descent from American paramountcy into American iso
lation from Europe, they wish to stabilize our relations. This is
the question posed in many forms and most specifically by the
French decision for an “independent” nuclear force. Our best
line is to say that if France means literally to have an independ
ent right to start a nuclear war, she will have to leave us with
the independent right not to participate in it. If, however,
France in fact does not want that kind of independence, then in
fact she wants some kind of partnership. If so, we shall have
to face the issue of whose finger is to be on the trigger of the
nuclear forces of the partnership.
These are difficult questions. It may be that they are the
oretically insoluble questions. But there is no pressing need to
solve them, because, for quite other reasons, there is for the time
being no serious danger of thermonuclear war. It is not tidy to
do nothing to settle the questions. But it is, I think, wiser to do
nothing than to spend a lot of energy on gimmicks—such as a
NATO nuclear force— which seek to bypass and disguise the
insoluble issue of how to combine the exhilaration of national
independence with the security of a great alliance.
This is, I realize, an uncongenial attitude for most of our
people. We believe that for every problem there must be a solu
tion, and it irks us badly when we find—as all powers in history
have had at one time or another to find—that there are prob
lems which cannot be solved and have to be lived with.
