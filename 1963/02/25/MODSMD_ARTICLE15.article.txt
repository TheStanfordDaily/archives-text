## No Birch Takeover of YR's 
### RICHARD WEINIG Contributing Editor 
A good deal of foolishness has been written during the past
week about the election of Robert Gaston as President of the
California Young Republicans. One can hardly scan a headline
these days without being confronted with preachments that
Gaston and his associates are agents of “the closest thing to a
fascist type party in this country”; are dupes of the John Birch
Society, and are, in short, guilty of all sins short of holding
blood-rites at full moon and devouring children.
I am not sure whether these charges should be viewed with
amusement or irritation. But it is high time to set the record
straight: to counter nonsense with fact; invective with reason.
One who is unacquainted with the personalities involved
could well gain two false impressions of the recent state con
vention by casually perusing through current press releases.
(1) It is charged that because Mr. Gaston accepted finan
cial and physical support from members of the John Birch So
ciety, his views must be nearly equivalent to those of Robert
Welch; or he and his followers must be dupes thereof;
(2) Therefore, Robert Gaston’s election over his opponent,
Ken Davis, constitutes the triumph of an unqualified “right
wing extremist” over a qualified Goldwater Republican.
Fortunately, neither allegation is true.
Surely few persons of a “moderate” or “liberal” persuasion
believe that mere acceptance of aid from a group or organiza
tion, ipso facto, establishes one as a member of that organization
or a dupe thereof. This is decidedly true of the relationship be
tween Robert Gaston and the John Birch Society.
Gaston has never been a member of the Society; his views
are roughly commensurate with those of Senator Goldwater;
and, like most other persons, he believes that Robert Welch is
a rather befuddled old soul. But Mr. Gaston is intelligent enough
to realize that most members of the Young Republicans who
are also members of the Society are sincere and not afraid of
hard work. They do not, for example, consider it beneath them
selves to contribute to perennially impoverished party coffers,
lick envelopes, address mailings, ring doorbells, man telephones,
and all the other menial tasks by which elections are won or
lost. (I wish that the same might be said of many of our “mod
erate” or “liberal” brethren who wring their hands about the
fate of the nation over coffee cups and bridge tables; but seem
to disappear when a bit of work is to be done.)
Such willingness to work is a quality so rare that it ought
to be received with open arms and rejoicing. Therefore, Gas
ton’s use of this source of labor should draw no more objections
than say, Mr. Kennedy’s utilization of the Birch Society’s liberal
counterparts: the ADA and the American Civil Liberties Union.
If anything, Mr. Gaston was the user and the Birch Society was
the used.
Moreover, the allegation that Gaston’s victory over his op
ponent, Ken Davis, constitutes the victory of a radical over a
responsible, experienced conservative sems rather preposterous
to anyone who knows both Mr. Gaston and Mr. Davis—as I do.
Mr. Gaston’s ideology is perfectly clear and is hardly ex
treme: it is, by and large, expressed in Senator Goldwater’s
book; “The Conscience of a Conservative.”
On the other hand, Mr. Davis's position is rather ambiva
lent. At the National Young Republican Convention in Minneap
olis, a year and one half ago, he was the most outspoken admirer
of Nelson A. Rockefeller in the California delegation; and active
ly supported the candidacy of a paid member of Rockefeller’s
staff for National Co-Chairman. But in Fresno last week, pre
sumably after sensing the ideological orientation of the assem
bly, Mr. Davis announced that he stood unequivocably behind
Senator Goldwater. In the light of his past record, Davis’s con
version to conservatism seems as sudden as the Pauline con
version on the road to Damascus—and seems less motivated by
conscience than by the realization that no professed liberal
could possibly have won the state presidency.
On top of seeming prevarication, Mr. Davis’s qualifications
to lead the state’s 14,000 Young Republicans were somewhat
less than stellar. His primary source of experience had been
his tenure as chairman of the Ventura County Young Republi
cans. The recommendation seems rather impressive—until one
realizes that Ventura County has only 95 members, less than
one third the number of even the Stanford Area Young Repub
licans. When this is compared with Gaston’s experience as
chairman of the Los Angeles County group, with a membership
of nearly 5,000, their respective qualifications for the state
presidency become readily apparent. This, undoubtedly, con
vinced far more delegates to vote for Gaston than any “Birch
money” could possibly have done.
Thus, Gaston’s victory was not that of a protege of Robert
Welch over a well-qualified conservative, but that of a well
qualified Goldwater Republican over an inexperienced and rather
confused liberal.
What, then, is all the fuss about?
The entire story of a “Birch takeover” appears to stem from
two individuals: the defeated candidate. Ken Davis, and his
most prominant supporter, out-going state President, Harry
Keaton. Nearly a month before the election, both saw that the
outcome would be close; but that Davis was trailing and would
probably lose unless some political rabbit could be pulled from
a hat. Therefore, in an attempt to sour some fifteen or twenty
voters voters across the state on Gaston, Keaton bombarded the
Press with incredible fables ahbut an impending "Birch take
over.” Mr. Keaton’s honesty in this regard was somewhat less
than one might expect from an instructor of labor law from
the University of Southern California, but the strategy almost
worked. The final vote was 189-170 and a switch of ten votes
would have given the election to Davis.
However, Mi'. Keaton’s attacks upon Gaston following the
election are difficult to explain unless the former president is
following recent directives from the chambers of one Nelson
A. Rockefeller: that is, to discredit the conservatives if they
couldn’t be beaten by fair means or foul. In a word, rule or ruin
the Young Republicans of California.
But even so, Keaton’s actions seem a bit hypocritical. If I
ame not mistaken, he was, only a short time ago, solemntly ad
vising all Young Republicans to settle their differences in pri
vate; to actively support their elected leaders in a spirit of party
unity; and refrain from limning to the press every time they
lost a fight. But I suppose that since Mr. Keaton and his liberal
friends have been turned out of office, they consider themselves
to be exempt from the very rules of conduct within the party
which they themselves articulated while in power. Nothing
like a double standard, is there?

week about the election of Robert Gaston as President of the
California Young Republicans. One can hardly scan a headline
these days without being confronted with preachments that
Gaston and his associates are agents of “the closest thing to a
fascist type party in this country”; are dupes of the John Birch
Society, and are, in short, guilty of all sins short of holding
blood-rites at full moon and devouring children.
I am not sure whether these charges should be viewed with
amusement or irritation. But it is high time to set the record
straight: to counter nonsense with fact; invective with reason.
One who is unacquainted with the personalities involved
could well gain two false impressions of the recent state con
vention by casually perusing through current press releases.
(1) It is charged that because Mr. Gaston accepted finan
cial and physical support from members of the John Birch So
ciety, his views must be nearly equivalent to those of Robert
Welch; or he and his followers must be dupes thereof;
(2) Therefore, Robert Gaston’s election over his opponent,
Ken Davis, constitutes the triumph of an unqualified “right
wing extremist” over a qualified Goldwater Republican.
Fortunately, neither allegation is true.
Surely few persons of a “moderate” or “liberal” persuasion
believe that mere acceptance of aid from a group or organiza
tion, ipso facto, establishes one as a member of that organization
or a dupe thereof. This is decidedly true of the relationship be
tween Robert Gaston and the John Birch Society.
Gaston has never been a member of the Society; his views
are roughly commensurate with those of Senator Goldwater;
and, like most other persons, he believes that Robert Welch is
a rather befuddled old soul. But Mr. Gaston is intelligent enough
to realize that most members of the Young Republicans who
are also members of the Society are sincere and not afraid of
hard work. They do not, for example, consider it beneath them
selves to contribute to perennially impoverished party coffers,
lick envelopes, address mailings, ring doorbells, man telephones,
and all the other menial tasks by which elections are won or
lost. (I wish that the same might be said of many of our “mod
erate” or “liberal” brethren who wring their hands about the
fate of the nation over coffee cups and bridge tables; but seem
to disappear when a bit of work is to be done.)
Such willingness to work is a quality so rare that it ought
to be received with open arms and rejoicing. Therefore, Gas
ton’s use of this source of labor should draw no more objections
than say, Mr. Kennedy’s utilization of the Birch Society’s liberal
counterparts: the ADA and the American Civil Liberties Union.
If anything, Mr. Gaston was the user and the Birch Society was
the used.
Moreover, the allegation that Gaston’s victory over his op
ponent, Ken Davis, constitutes the victory of a radical over a
responsible, experienced conservative sems rather preposterous
to anyone who knows both Mr. Gaston and Mr. Davis—as I do.
Mr. Gaston’s ideology is perfectly clear and is hardly ex
treme: it is, by and large, expressed in Senator Goldwater’s
book; “The Conscience of a Conservative.”
On the other hand, Mr. Davis's position is rather ambiva
lent. At the National Young Republican Convention in Minneap
olis, a year and one half ago, he was the most outspoken admirer
of Nelson A. Rockefeller in the California delegation; and active
ly supported the candidacy of a paid member of Rockefeller’s
staff for National Co-Chairman. But in Fresno last week, pre
sumably after sensing the ideological orientation of the assem
bly, Mr. Davis announced that he stood unequivocably behind
Senator Goldwater. In the light of his past record, Davis’s con
version to conservatism seems as sudden as the Pauline con
version on the road to Damascus—and seems less motivated by
conscience than by the realization that no professed liberal
could possibly have won the state presidency.
On top of seeming prevarication, Mr. Davis’s qualifications
to lead the state’s 14,000 Young Republicans were somewhat
less than stellar. His primary source of experience had been
his tenure as chairman of the Ventura County Young Republi
cans. The recommendation seems rather impressive—until one
realizes that Ventura County has only 95 members, less than
one third the number of even the Stanford Area Young Repub
licans. When this is compared with Gaston’s experience as
chairman of the Los Angeles County group, with a membership
of nearly 5,000, their respective qualifications for the state
presidency become readily apparent. This, undoubtedly, con
vinced far more delegates to vote for Gaston than any “Birch
money” could possibly have done.
Thus, Gaston’s victory was not that of a protege of Robert
Welch over a well-qualified conservative, but that of a well
qualified Goldwater Republican over an inexperienced and rather
confused liberal.
What, then, is all the fuss about?
The entire story of a “Birch takeover” appears to stem from
two individuals: the defeated candidate. Ken Davis, and his
most prominant supporter, out-going state President, Harry
Keaton. Nearly a month before the election, both saw that the
outcome would be close; but that Davis was trailing and would
probably lose unless some political rabbit could be pulled from
a hat. Therefore, in an attempt to sour some fifteen or twenty
voters voters across the state on Gaston, Keaton bombarded the
Press with incredible fables ahbut an impending "Birch take
over.” Mr. Keaton’s honesty in this regard was somewhat less
than one might expect from an instructor of labor law from
the University of Southern California, but the strategy almost
worked. The final vote was 189-170 and a switch of ten votes
would have given the election to Davis.
However, Mi'. Keaton’s attacks upon Gaston following the
election are difficult to explain unless the former president is
following recent directives from the chambers of one Nelson
A. Rockefeller: that is, to discredit the conservatives if they
couldn’t be beaten by fair means or foul. In a word, rule or ruin
the Young Republicans of California.
But even so, Keaton’s actions seem a bit hypocritical. If I
ame not mistaken, he was, only a short time ago, solemntly ad
vising all Young Republicans to settle their differences in pri
vate; to actively support their elected leaders in a spirit of party
unity; and refrain from limning to the press every time they
lost a fight. But I suppose that since Mr. Keaton and his liberal
friends have been turned out of office, they consider themselves
to be exempt from the very rules of conduct within the party
which they themselves articulated while in power. Nothing
like a double standard, is there?

these days without being confronted with preachments that
Gaston and his associates are agents of “the closest thing to a
fascist type party in this country”; are dupes of the John Birch
Society, and are, in short, guilty of all sins short of holding
blood-rites at full moon and devouring children.
I am not sure whether these charges should be viewed with
amusement or irritation. But it is high time to set the record
straight: to counter nonsense with fact; invective with reason.
One who is unacquainted with the personalities involved
could well gain two false impressions of the recent state con
vention by casually perusing through current press releases.
(1) It is charged that because Mr. Gaston accepted finan
cial and physical support from members of the John Birch So
ciety, his views must be nearly equivalent to those of Robert
Welch; or he and his followers must be dupes thereof;
(2) Therefore, Robert Gaston’s election over his opponent,
Ken Davis, constitutes the triumph of an unqualified “right
wing extremist” over a qualified Goldwater Republican.
Fortunately, neither allegation is true.
Surely few persons of a “moderate” or “liberal” persuasion
believe that mere acceptance of aid from a group or organiza
tion, ipso facto, establishes one as a member of that organization
or a dupe thereof. This is decidedly true of the relationship be
tween Robert Gaston and the John Birch Society.
Gaston has never been a member of the Society; his views
are roughly commensurate with those of Senator Goldwater;
and, like most other persons, he believes that Robert Welch is
a rather befuddled old soul. But Mr. Gaston is intelligent enough
to realize that most members of the Young Republicans who
are also members of the Society are sincere and not afraid of
hard work. They do not, for example, consider it beneath them
selves to contribute to perennially impoverished party coffers,
lick envelopes, address mailings, ring doorbells, man telephones,
and all the other menial tasks by which elections are won or
lost. (I wish that the same might be said of many of our “mod
erate” or “liberal” brethren who wring their hands about the
fate of the nation over coffee cups and bridge tables; but seem
to disappear when a bit of work is to be done.)
Such willingness to work is a quality so rare that it ought
to be received with open arms and rejoicing. Therefore, Gas
ton’s use of this source of labor should draw no more objections
than say, Mr. Kennedy’s utilization of the Birch Society’s liberal
counterparts: the ADA and the American Civil Liberties Union.
If anything, Mr. Gaston was the user and the Birch Society was
the used.
Moreover, the allegation that Gaston’s victory over his op
ponent, Ken Davis, constitutes the victory of a radical over a
responsible, experienced conservative sems rather preposterous
to anyone who knows both Mr. Gaston and Mr. Davis—as I do.
Mr. Gaston’s ideology is perfectly clear and is hardly ex
treme: it is, by and large, expressed in Senator Goldwater’s
book; “The Conscience of a Conservative.”
On the other hand, Mr. Davis's position is rather ambiva
lent. At the National Young Republican Convention in Minneap
olis, a year and one half ago, he was the most outspoken admirer
of Nelson A. Rockefeller in the California delegation; and active
ly supported the candidacy of a paid member of Rockefeller’s
staff for National Co-Chairman. But in Fresno last week, pre
sumably after sensing the ideological orientation of the assem
bly, Mr. Davis announced that he stood unequivocably behind
Senator Goldwater. In the light of his past record, Davis’s con
version to conservatism seems as sudden as the Pauline con
version on the road to Damascus—and seems less motivated by
conscience than by the realization that no professed liberal
could possibly have won the state presidency.
On top of seeming prevarication, Mr. Davis’s qualifications
to lead the state’s 14,000 Young Republicans were somewhat
less than stellar. His primary source of experience had been
his tenure as chairman of the Ventura County Young Republi
cans. The recommendation seems rather impressive—until one
realizes that Ventura County has only 95 members, less than
one third the number of even the Stanford Area Young Repub
licans. When this is compared with Gaston’s experience as
chairman of the Los Angeles County group, with a membership
of nearly 5,000, their respective qualifications for the state
presidency become readily apparent. This, undoubtedly, con
vinced far more delegates to vote for Gaston than any “Birch
money” could possibly have done.
Thus, Gaston’s victory was not that of a protege of Robert
Welch over a well-qualified conservative, but that of a well
qualified Goldwater Republican over an inexperienced and rather
confused liberal.
What, then, is all the fuss about?
The entire story of a “Birch takeover” appears to stem from
two individuals: the defeated candidate. Ken Davis, and his
most prominant supporter, out-going state President, Harry
Keaton. Nearly a month before the election, both saw that the
outcome would be close; but that Davis was trailing and would
probably lose unless some political rabbit could be pulled from
a hat. Therefore, in an attempt to sour some fifteen or twenty
voters voters across the state on Gaston, Keaton bombarded the
Press with incredible fables ahbut an impending "Birch take
over.” Mr. Keaton’s honesty in this regard was somewhat less
than one might expect from an instructor of labor law from
the University of Southern California, but the strategy almost
worked. The final vote was 189-170 and a switch of ten votes
would have given the election to Davis.
However, Mi'. Keaton’s attacks upon Gaston following the
election are difficult to explain unless the former president is
following recent directives from the chambers of one Nelson
A. Rockefeller: that is, to discredit the conservatives if they
couldn’t be beaten by fair means or foul. In a word, rule or ruin
the Young Republicans of California.
But even so, Keaton’s actions seem a bit hypocritical. If I
ame not mistaken, he was, only a short time ago, solemntly ad
vising all Young Republicans to settle their differences in pri
vate; to actively support their elected leaders in a spirit of party
unity; and refrain from limning to the press every time they
lost a fight. But I suppose that since Mr. Keaton and his liberal
friends have been turned out of office, they consider themselves
to be exempt from the very rules of conduct within the party
which they themselves articulated while in power. Nothing
like a double standard, is there?

Gaston and his associates are agents of “the closest thing to a
fascist type party in this country”; are dupes of the John Birch
Society, and are, in short, guilty of all sins short of holding
blood-rites at full moon and devouring children.
I am not sure whether these charges should be viewed with
amusement or irritation. But it is high time to set the record
straight: to counter nonsense with fact; invective with reason.
One who is unacquainted with the personalities involved
could well gain two false impressions of the recent state con
vention by casually perusing through current press releases.
(1) It is charged that because Mr. Gaston accepted finan
cial and physical support from members of the John Birch So
ciety, his views must be nearly equivalent to those of Robert
Welch; or he and his followers must be dupes thereof;
(2) Therefore, Robert Gaston’s election over his opponent,
Ken Davis, constitutes the triumph of an unqualified “right
wing extremist” over a qualified Goldwater Republican.
Fortunately, neither allegation is true.
Surely few persons of a “moderate” or “liberal” persuasion
believe that mere acceptance of aid from a group or organiza
tion, ipso facto, establishes one as a member of that organization
or a dupe thereof. This is decidedly true of the relationship be
tween Robert Gaston and the John Birch Society.
Gaston has never been a member of the Society; his views
are roughly commensurate with those of Senator Goldwater;
and, like most other persons, he believes that Robert Welch is
a rather befuddled old soul. But Mr. Gaston is intelligent enough
to realize that most members of the Young Republicans who
are also members of the Society are sincere and not afraid of
hard work. They do not, for example, consider it beneath them
selves to contribute to perennially impoverished party coffers,
lick envelopes, address mailings, ring doorbells, man telephones,
and all the other menial tasks by which elections are won or
lost. (I wish that the same might be said of many of our “mod
erate” or “liberal” brethren who wring their hands about the
fate of the nation over coffee cups and bridge tables; but seem
to disappear when a bit of work is to be done.)
Such willingness to work is a quality so rare that it ought
to be received with open arms and rejoicing. Therefore, Gas
ton’s use of this source of labor should draw no more objections
than say, Mr. Kennedy’s utilization of the Birch Society’s liberal
counterparts: the ADA and the American Civil Liberties Union.
If anything, Mr. Gaston was the user and the Birch Society was
the used.
Moreover, the allegation that Gaston’s victory over his op
ponent, Ken Davis, constitutes the victory of a radical over a
responsible, experienced conservative sems rather preposterous
to anyone who knows both Mr. Gaston and Mr. Davis—as I do.
Mr. Gaston’s ideology is perfectly clear and is hardly ex
treme: it is, by and large, expressed in Senator Goldwater’s
book; “The Conscience of a Conservative.”
On the other hand, Mr. Davis's position is rather ambiva
lent. At the National Young Republican Convention in Minneap
olis, a year and one half ago, he was the most outspoken admirer
of Nelson A. Rockefeller in the California delegation; and active
ly supported the candidacy of a paid member of Rockefeller’s
staff for National Co-Chairman. But in Fresno last week, pre
sumably after sensing the ideological orientation of the assem
bly, Mr. Davis announced that he stood unequivocably behind
Senator Goldwater. In the light of his past record, Davis’s con
version to conservatism seems as sudden as the Pauline con
version on the road to Damascus—and seems less motivated by
conscience than by the realization that no professed liberal
could possibly have won the state presidency.
On top of seeming prevarication, Mr. Davis’s qualifications
to lead the state’s 14,000 Young Republicans were somewhat
less than stellar. His primary source of experience had been
his tenure as chairman of the Ventura County Young Republi
cans. The recommendation seems rather impressive—until one
realizes that Ventura County has only 95 members, less than
one third the number of even the Stanford Area Young Repub
licans. When this is compared with Gaston’s experience as
chairman of the Los Angeles County group, with a membership
of nearly 5,000, their respective qualifications for the state
presidency become readily apparent. This, undoubtedly, con
vinced far more delegates to vote for Gaston than any “Birch
money” could possibly have done.
Thus, Gaston’s victory was not that of a protege of Robert
Welch over a well-qualified conservative, but that of a well
qualified Goldwater Republican over an inexperienced and rather
confused liberal.
What, then, is all the fuss about?
The entire story of a “Birch takeover” appears to stem from
two individuals: the defeated candidate. Ken Davis, and his
most prominant supporter, out-going state President, Harry
Keaton. Nearly a month before the election, both saw that the
outcome would be close; but that Davis was trailing and would
probably lose unless some political rabbit could be pulled from
a hat. Therefore, in an attempt to sour some fifteen or twenty
voters voters across the state on Gaston, Keaton bombarded the
Press with incredible fables ahbut an impending "Birch take
over.” Mr. Keaton’s honesty in this regard was somewhat less
than one might expect from an instructor of labor law from
the University of Southern California, but the strategy almost
worked. The final vote was 189-170 and a switch of ten votes
would have given the election to Davis.
However, Mi'. Keaton’s attacks upon Gaston following the
election are difficult to explain unless the former president is
following recent directives from the chambers of one Nelson
A. Rockefeller: that is, to discredit the conservatives if they
couldn’t be beaten by fair means or foul. In a word, rule or ruin
the Young Republicans of California.
But even so, Keaton’s actions seem a bit hypocritical. If I
ame not mistaken, he was, only a short time ago, solemntly ad
vising all Young Republicans to settle their differences in pri
vate; to actively support their elected leaders in a spirit of party
unity; and refrain from limning to the press every time they
lost a fight. But I suppose that since Mr. Keaton and his liberal
friends have been turned out of office, they consider themselves
to be exempt from the very rules of conduct within the party
which they themselves articulated while in power. Nothing
like a double standard, is there?
