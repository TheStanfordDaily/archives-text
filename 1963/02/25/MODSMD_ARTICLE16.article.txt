Editors, The Daily:
As everybody knows, the use of one word rather than an
other, or the position of a particular word in a sentence can make
considerable difference in meaning. In speaking at the Coffee
Hour Monday I did not intend to convey the nation—as reported
in The Daily—that prior to Hiroshima “mankind was able to
at least settle temporarily, all conflicts by using armed
force. But certainly, from before the dawn of history, men have
been willing to pay the cost of settling many conficts through
armed force. I believe that the cost of large scale armed force is
rapidly becoming prohibitive—to “winner” and “loser” alike.
Nor did I moan to suggest that the United Nations is ignored
or abused to the degree that the Prohibition Amendment was
ignored and abused. I wanted to suggest that a law or institu
tion is effective to the degree that it has been accepted and “in
ternalized” by the society of which it is a part. The United Na
tions is not yet sufficintly internationalized to speak for the
human conscience.
Finally, it is not my belief that the United Nations “should
not solve problems, but serve only as an international arena for
peace. The more problems the United Nations can solve the
better. For human survival, however, the United Nations will be
pei foi ming a vital function if we can learn to use it and accept
it and depend upon it as an arena for non-violent conflict—re
gardless of how many problems it is able (or unable) to “solve.”
In this sense I look upon the United Nations, potentially, at least,
as an alternative to large scale violence as a mode or medium or
method of conflict
