Last \\ c'diK’sclay the Associated Students of the University of
Washington Noted 10-9 with two abstentions to remain a part of
the National Student Association. The decision came at the end
of a two-hour dehate when ASUW President Boh Joss broke the
9—9 tie with his decision, joe Ryan, head of the faction against

membership in NSA, opened the*
discussion by attacking the size
of the budget. He said that NSA
did not warrant the $2,500 appro
priated to it each year, and said
that various other campus or
ganizations benefited many more
students at a lower cost.
"THU (DMAS we gain (from
NSA) do not warrant the costs,”
Ryan said in the Washington
Daily. “We are not using our
minds. We should solve our own
problems.” He added that in his
opinion the only people benefit
ting from NSA were the board
members.
Sandy Law, ASUW Secretary,
took the other side by saying that
NSA, through its tours and
pamphlets, was of benefit to the
entire student body. She also
pointed out that the University
dues in the Association were paid
up until August.
TOM WAKRKN, ASUW Vice-
President and co-initiator of the
bill to pull out, disagreed. “NSA
is supposed to stimulate and im
prove student government,” he
said in The Daily. "I don’t think
it’s done either for us.” He said
he felt there was a lack of stu
dent-campus orientation in the

program.
Warren referred to the minutes
of Control Board meetings in
1951 and 1951 when disaffiliation
had been previously discussed.
“The same problems occur every
lime the NSA is debated,” he said.
The Daily reported David York,
Junior Class President, as saying,
“1 hale to see a selfish, material
istic, near-sighted approach to
this problem. If we don’t like
what NSA is doing, we can
change it during the national con
gress.”
He said that the University was
“finally developing a little social
conscience and it would be a
shame to withdraw from NSA be
cause of a little budget pressure.”
GARY AUSMAN, co-author of
the anti-NSA bill, referred to an
article in the Columbus, Ohio,
Dispatch which dealt with Ohio
State’s decision to withdraw from
the Association last year, and
brought up the matter of Com
munists or Communist supporters
at the conference in Columbus
last summer.
Debate went on until a vote
was taken to end it. At 5:45 p.m.
a roll call vote was taken ending
in the 9-9 lie which Joss broke.
