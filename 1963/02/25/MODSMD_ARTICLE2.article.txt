# Cal Frosh Snatches Moir's Yell Sweater
## 
### 
Doug Moir. Stanford head yell
leader, had a few cold moments
at the Stanford-Cal. game Feb. 17
when a Cal freshman pilfered his
sweater. Moir and (he other Stan
ford yell leaders challenged the
Cal leaders to a basketball game
at half-time and he laid his sweat
er on the bench only to return
and find it missing.
Monday afternoon the Cal
Daily called Moir to tell him that
a Cal freshman had snatched the
big red trophy as a prank and
had returned the sweater to them.
Moir remarked. “It was a good
stunt—after I had gotten it
back."
