# Stanford Outlegs Cal Women In 'Long' 50-Mile Walkathon
## 
### DAVE WELCH 
In what was probably the most
humorous if not the most suc
cessful 50-mile hike since Presi
dent Kennedy’s no w Infamous
challenge, 10 Stanford students
successfully defended their honor
against 10 athletic girls from the
University of California at Berke
ley.
The Stanford students chal
lenged the Cal student body to a
fifty-mile hike over San Francis
co’s famed 49-mile scenic route,
but the student body, termed
“apathetic" hy the Daily Califor
nian, refused to accept. However,
10 girls from Cal volunteered to
accompany the Stanford team if
the route were changed to one of
their own choosing. The route
agreed upon ran from San Fran
cisco down El Camino to Stanford.
By starting time last Friday
morning, the number of hikers
had swelled to approximately 30.
Among the additional starters
were Professor Alphonse G. Juil
land of the Stanford French De
partment, a girl from the Univer
sity of Oregon, and several Stan
ford graduate students.
When one member of the Stan
ford team dropped out after 12
miles, it appeared that their rapid

pace might be the downfall of the
team. Two of the Cal gills gave
out after twenty miles, hut by
this time three more of the Stan
ford team had dropped out al
though they had gone close to
thirty miles.
The remainder of the Stanford
team continued their rapid pace
with the two leaders finishing at
4:30 p.m. for a total time of 12
and a half hours. The next finish
er came in about a half hour later,
and the last two to finish sprinted
through the arch in front of Me
morial Church at 6:30 p.m.
While the graduate students had
dropped out at 20 miles, Professor
Juilland lasted for more than 40
miles before he was forced to
drop out because of severe cramps
in both legs. Two of the Cal girls
had gone on ahead and were fin
-1 ishing at this time for a total time
of 17 hours.
While discussing the hike (lie
next day it was generally agreed
; that the course might have been
more than 50 miles. At this time
; arrangements are being made to
. remeasure the course. It now
seems likely that the course was
closer to 56 miles than 50, which
would mean that the times of the
finishers would have to be ad
justed downward.
But all involved agreed.
“NEVER AGAIN!"

out after twenty miles, hut by
this time three more of the Stan
ford team had dropped out al
though they had gone close to
thirty miles.
The remainder of the Stanford
team continued their rapid pace
with the two leaders finishing at
4:30 p.m. for a total time of 12
and a half hours. The next finish
er came in about a half hour later,
and the last two to finish sprinted
through the arch in front of Me
morial Church at 6:30 p.m.
While the graduate students had
dropped out at 20 miles, Professor
Juilland lasted for more than 40
miles before he was forced to
drop out because of severe cramps
in both legs. Two of the Cal girls
had gone on ahead and were fin
-1 ishing at this time for a total time
of 17 hours.
While discussing the hike (lie
next day it was generally agreed
; that the course might have been
more than 50 miles. At this time
; arrangements are being made to
. remeasure the course. It now
seems likely that the course was
closer to 56 miles than 50, which
would mean that the times of the
finishers would have to be ad
justed downward.
But all involved agreed.
“NEVER AGAIN!"
In what was probably the most
humorous if not the most suc
cessful 50-mile hike since Presi
dent Kennedy’s no w Infamous
challenge, 10 Stanford students
successfully defended their honor
against 10 athletic girls from the
University of California at Berke
ley.
The Stanford students chal
lenged the Cal student body to a
fifty-mile hike over San Francis
co’s famed 49-mile scenic route,
but the student body, termed
“apathetic" hy the Daily Califor
nian, refused to accept. However,
10 girls from Cal volunteered to
accompany the Stanford team if
the route were changed to one of
their own choosing. The route
agreed upon ran from San Fran
cisco down El Camino to Stanford.
By starting time last Friday
morning, the number of hikers
had swelled to approximately 30.
Among the additional starters
were Professor Alphonse G. Juil
land of the Stanford French De
partment, a girl from the Univer
sity of Oregon, and several Stan
ford graduate students.
When one member of the Stan
ford team dropped out after 12
miles, it appeared that their rapid

pace might be the downfall of the
team. Two of the Cal gills gave
out after twenty miles, hut by
this time three more of the Stan
ford team had dropped out al
though they had gone close to
thirty miles.
