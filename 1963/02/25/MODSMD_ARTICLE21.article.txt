# Frosh 'Edge' Moffett, Down Card Jayvees

### ROGER MENDELSON 
The freshman basketball team
scheduled t wo inept opponents
this weekend and won both
Karnes against them by a com
posite margin of 83 points; the
Moffett Field Flyers fell 79-22 and
the Stanford Junior Varsity
Braves lost 58-32.
The Moffett Field farce Friday
night was staged three hours pre
maturely, Had it followed the var
sity game instead of preceding it.
it could have provided a refresh
ing comic relief to the tense
Bruin-Indian contest,
WHILE MOFFKTT Field may
easily have been the worst team
to play on the Farm this year, it
may also have been the most col
orful. Ostensibly representing a
naval air station, the Flyers’ 6-7,
240-pound center AI Dittman
looked like a loan from the Army
Tank Corps and threw elbows
with the rapidity of a machine
gun: in contrast to him, 5-3, 125-
pounder Bob Black would have
been more valuable to the Air
Force as an astronaut for an

Explorer I sized satellite than he |
was to the Navy as a basketball
player.
Led by these questionable as
sets (as well as others), the Fly
ers hit a grand 11.5 per cent of
their field goal attempts, commit
ted myriads of ball control errors,
and generally provided less com
petition for the Frosh than the
average intramural team could
have. At one point early in the
second half, they went 12 minutes
without scoring.
Bob Bedell and Jim Pandell
took most advantage of the Mof
fett Field gravy train with game
high totals of 16 and 12 points
respectively. The rest of the
goodies were spread out evenly
among the other 12 who scored
for Stanford, none of whom had
more than five points.
THE JV FROSH game, played
as the 8 p.m. Pavilion main
event Saturday night, could have
been billed as a match between
the freshman teams of 1962 and
1963. The JV’s had the top seven
men from last year’s Papooses:
Craig Cordes, John Murray,
Mike Preisler, Rod Young, Frank
Olrich, Jack Gilbert, and Bob
Garner. However, all seven of
them work out daily with the var
sity and therefore have not prac
ticed as a team, together with the
others who play JV ball.
The absence of team coordina
tion was obvious as the JV’s were
unable to set up much of an of
fense against the Frosh’s strong
defense. Thus most of their pal
try total of 38 shots had to be
forced against close guarding for
lack of better openings; the re
sult was a 31.6 shooting percent
age.
MEANWHILE, the Frosh wore
taking more shots (48) and hit
ting a better percentage (36.8).
The freshmen’s rebounding edge,
41-32, due mainly to the board
work of Bedell, Ray Kosanke,
Wayne Brazil, and Rich Baker,
consistently gave them control of
the ball, thereby enabling them
to shoot more often.
The top scorere were Kosanke
and Pandell with 13 and 11 points.
Young and Preisler led the
Braves with eight and six.

for Stanford, none of whom had
more than five points.
THE JV FROSH game, played
as the 8 p.m. Pavilion main
event Saturday night, could have
been billed as a match between
the freshman teams of 1962 and
1963. The JV’s had the top seven
men from last year’s Papooses:
Craig Cordes, John Murray,
Mike Preisler, Rod Young, Frank
Olrich, Jack Gilbert, and Bob
Garner. However, all seven of
them work out daily with the var
sity and therefore have not prac
ticed as a team, together with the
others who play JV ball.
The absence of team coordina
tion was obvious as the JV’s were
unable to set up much of an of
fense against the Frosh’s strong
defense. Thus most of their pal
try total of 38 shots had to be
forced against close guarding for
lack of better openings; the re
sult was a 31.6 shooting percent
age.
MEANWHILE, the Frosh wore
taking more shots (48) and hit
ting a better percentage (36.8).
The freshmen’s rebounding edge,
41-32, due mainly to the board
work of Bedell, Ray Kosanke,
Wayne Brazil, and Rich Baker,
consistently gave them control of
the ball, thereby enabling them
to shoot more often.
The top scorere were Kosanke
and Pandell with 13 and 11 points.
Young and Preisler led the
Braves with eight and six.
The freshman basketball team

Moffett Field Flyers fell 79-22 and

Braves lost 58-32.

to play on the Farm this year, it

Led by these questionable as
sets (as well as others), the Fly
ers hit a grand 11.5 per cent of
their field goal attempts, commit

and generally provided less com
petition for the Frosh than the
average intramural team could
have. At one point early in the
second half, they went 12 minutes
without scoring.
