## Varsity Horsehiders Win Two Weekend Shutouts 
### PETE KING 
It was a changed Stanford base
ball team that took the field last
weekend in Sunken Diamond. The
team that earlier in the week had
looked so poor against USF easi
ly shut out Cal Poly (San Luis
Obispo), 8-0, and the Alumni,
4-0, for an impressive two-game
sweep.

Five Indian pitchers allowed
only six hits in the series, while
Tribe hitting improved from five
hits against USF to 20 safeties
for the weekend. Another bright
spot was the fielding only four
errors were committed as against
the eight in the USF game.
ON FRIDAY Card hurler Dick
Kovacevich allowed Cal Poly only
two hits (in the first inning) in
the six innings he pitched. He
combined with Jim Lonborg to
retire the last 17 Mustang batters
in a row.

The Indians did not score until
the fifth inning. Kovacevich drew
a walk, and Dave Stout went in
to run for him. Under the speed
up rules adopted by both teams,
Kovacevich was still in the game.
Stout stole second, then scored
on Grog Post’s hard-hit triple
down the left field baseline.
Outfielder Post led the Stan
ford batsmen with a triple, two
singles, a walk, two stolen bases,
two runs scored, and two RBl’s.
He was also hit by apitch.
THE ALUMNI contest on Sat
urday was a well-attended, gay
affair. The alums lost, as usual,
but not before intertaining the
crowd with a pitching and field
ing display worthy of many col
lege teams.
The umpires were sympathetic
chaps. When a towering drive by
Alum A1 Spurgeon landed one
foot foul in left field, he was gra
ciously awarded a double for his
efforts. On another play, the
scorer, Mike Ledgerwood, ruled

that a grounder had taken a “bad
bounce” off third baseman A1
Schutzman’s foot, and gave Card
Joel Shulman a hit.
The initial four innings were
played by members of the 1953
Stanford team, which won the
CIBA title and compiled a 29-15-4
record. Chuck Essegian, former
Cleveland Indian and Los Angeles
Dodger, had a double in three
trips to the plate. Besides Spur
geon’s “double,” the alums got
only a pair of singles for the rest
of the afternoon.
