# Wooden Praises Dose, Strategy
## 
### 
“We couldn’t control Dose
(Tom)” was UCLA coach John
Wooden’s understated analysis of
his 73-69 loss to Stanford last
Friday. Dose scored 35 points, the
highest one-game production in
several years for an Indian play
er hut was still five short of Ron
Tomsic’s 40-point performance in
1955. “Dose is certainly the all
league center and must be men
tioned on several All-America
teams,” said Wooden.
“We tried to keep the ball away
from Dose by sagging our defens
ive forwards toward him to pre
vent the pass into him,” he con
tinued. This strategy worked in
the first half when Stanford’s
cornermen could not hit from the
outside consistently enough to
force the UCLA forwards to come
out on them, away from Dose.
HOWEVE K, Indian coach
Howie Dallmar countered in the
second half by playing his guards,
Don Clemetson and Kent Hinck
ley, who are good outside shoot
ers, in the corners. With the
Bruin guards playing them tight
ly, they consistently fed Dose in
prime scoring position with only
one Uclan, center Fred Slaughter,
to beat. Dose made short work of
him, continually waiting for
Slaughter to commit himself with
his groat jumping ability and
then muscling in a lay-up or short
hook. In the second half and over
time, he made 10 of 13 shots and
scored 28 points.
A significant factor, according
to Dallmar, was Stanford’s cur
tailment of UCLA’s devastating
fast break, which was largely re
sponsible for beating Cal on Sat
urday. “We stopped the fast
break with strong offensive re
bounding,” he said. “Even when
we didn’t control the rebound, our
nearest man would drop off on
the UCLA player with the ball
to harass him and prevent the
first quick pass out.
