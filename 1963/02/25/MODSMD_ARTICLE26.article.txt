# Stanford Defeats UCLA 73-69; Dose Champions Cards With 35
## 
### GLENN ALFORD Tom Dose 
Tom Dose: that’s who the 2,800
present in I he Stanford Pavilion
wore praising as they filed out
after Stanford had squeaked past
UCLA 73-69 in overtime last Fri
day.
TOM DOSK: he scored 35
points and grabbed 14 rebounds
despite l absorbing more physical
punishment than Floyd Patterson
in his recent sleeper with Sonny
Liston.
Tom Dose: who ruined UCLA
with 28 second-half points, includ
ing eight in the overtime period.
Tom Dose: the player that Wall
Hazzard floored with an elbow
smash out of sheer frustration as
time ran out in the Dose-dominat
ed Stanford overtime spurt.
That is not to say that Stan
ford didn’t have other stars. Don
Clemetson played a brilliant floor
game and scored 12 crucial points
despite being flattened and forced
to leave the game late in the sec
ond half.
KENT HINCKLEY tallied 10
points and took over Clemetson’s
role as floor leader when he had
to leave the game at a crucial
point.
Hollis Moore scored 12 points
including three crucial free
throws which gave the Indians a
chance to win the game in over
time, and he carried the Tribe
scoring early in the game with
three field goals that kept Stan
ford from being run right out of
the Pavilion,
Clayton Raaka was a brilliant
rebounder, grabbing 11, and he
scored four important points late
in the game. His crucial lay-in
with 0:47 remaining in the over
time was the last and most im
portant Stanford field goal of the
game.
BUT IP’ ever a team was car
ried offensively by one man.
Stanford was carried by Dose.
He made lay-ins, he made hooks,
he made jump shots, he made
free throws, he' made lip-ins, and
most of all. he made Fred Slaugh
ter look sick trying to guard him.
UCLA was supposed to be one
of the slickest teams, if not the
best in the nation, at passing to
set up easy baskets. Yet Stanford
more than doubled UCLA in the
statistic that measures that de
partment, assists. Stanford had
15, UCLA seven. Don Clemetson
alone had more than the entire
Bruin team, eight. Walt Hazzard
had one brilliant assist for UCLA
but only one. For the most part,
when he got the ball the other
Bruins might not even have ex
isted for all the times he fed
(hem.
This cannot be attributed com
pletely to Hazzard’s selfishness.
The fact is the other Bruins were
blanketed by as fine a defense
as Stanford has shown all yea.r
When a team holds UCLA to 58
points in 40 minutes, and 69 in
45, they’ve done a whale of a job.
AS USUAL, UCLA relied on
Hazzard’s outside shooting and
drives and Slaughter's tip-ins for
most of their scoring. They got
a bonus in the fine outside shoot
ing and rebounding of guard Gail
Goodrich.
As has been their custom of
late, the Cards started slowly and
fell behind 30-24 at the half. They
shot only 29 per cent and would
have been blown right off the
court if Moore hadn’t made three
long jumpers in a row. UCLA’s
poor tree throw shooting helped
Stanford. The Bruins made 25
per cent, two of eight.
Dose had a relatively poor first
half. He made only three of 13
shots, though he had 10 rebounds.
Clemetson managed only one bas
ket in sewn attempts. In the sec
ond half things were a little dif
ferent. Dose made 10 of 13 shots
from the floor and eight for

eight from the charity stripe.
Clemetson sank three of eight
and held Hazzard to only two bas
kets in the regulation 20-minute
period. Once the Indians went
ahead in the overtime the strat
egy was not to foul, so Clemet
son played his man loosely. Haz
zard sank four quick baskets to
get his 22-point total.
STANFORD moved up slowly
on the Bruins in the second half,
finally catching up on Dose’s
lip-in with 8:05 remaining. UCLA
wisely called time out, as the
Stanford crowd raised the roof
off the Pavilion with the loudest
ovation over heard there.
UCLA got the lead only once
more, that with 6:48 remaining
on Goodrich’s free throw. The
score then was 48-47. Stanford re
gained the advantage on Raaka’s
long jump shot and never again
was behind, though once tied.
This was for a period of 24 sec
onds; the last 12 seconds of the
regulation time when Goodrich
converted a three-pointer to tie
the score, and the first 12 seconds
of the overtime when Dose made
both ends of a one-and-one free
throw.
In all, Dose made eight points
in the overtime. Clemetson scored
five and set up Raaka’s lay-in
with a perfect pass.
TDK VICTORY was a must for
Stanford. The Tribe has a 6-3
AAWU record, compared to
Washington’s 6-4. Stanford’s re
maining games are away from
home while UCLA plays all its
games in Los Angeles. Washing
ton must be discounted because
it plays its remaining two games
aw'ay from home, where the Hus
kies have trouble winning.
Finally, the victory was es
pecially sweet for Stanford in a
way that may not show up in
the AAWU standings for several
years to come. Several outstand
ing high school athletes were
guests of Stanford at the game.
They couldn’t help but be im
pressed with the wild enthusiasm
of the Stanford rooters, the
sportsmanship of the players and
the playing ability of the team as
a whole.
Any way you look at it, Stan
ford profited by Friday night’s
game.

THERE WAS PLENTY of rough action under the backboards in the
Pavilion Friday night. Here Clayton Raaka and Hollis Moore go
up against UCLA's Keith Erickson and Walt Hazzard. The Bruins
got more rebounds, 58-54, but Stanford got more points, 73-69,
in the overtime contest which put the Indians back in first place in
the AAWU.
