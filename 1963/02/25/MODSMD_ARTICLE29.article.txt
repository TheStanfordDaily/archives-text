# Colorado Administration Censures Daily Editor For Insulting Letter
## 
### 
A special board of appeal com
posed of three deans has upheld
an administration action placing
ex-managing editor of the Colo
rado Daily Terry Marshall on pro
bation for writing an outspoken
letter to university Regent Dale
Atkins.
The only change remommended
by the board was to amend the
terminology of the disciplinary
action to read “Dean’s warning”
instead of “administrative proba
tion.”
Atkins, who has been recently
elected, had been instrumental in
pressuring the Colorado adminis
tration to take action against the
Colorado Daily because the paper
had earlier allowed a student-writ
ten article to be printed w h ich
referred to Senator Barry Gold
water in derogatory terms.
Atkins campaigned for the
Board of Regents and won on a
“clean the subversives out of the
University” platform, and made
the Daily a major issue for con
servatives in the November elec
tion campaign. After a month
long furor on the Boulder cam
pus, university president Quigg
Newton fired the editor of the
Daily, Gary Althen.
The letter, which the board said
was "intemperate and insulting,”
told the regent that Marshall in
tended to “continue to subvert
vour dirty Americanism.” The
special board held that “students
at the University do not have the
priviledge, as a matter of right,
to write scurrilous and insulting
letters to other students, teachers,
or to members of the Board of
Regents.”
The special board also said that
as far as it could determine, Mar
shall’s letter was private, not in
tended for publication, but that
Marshall “could reasonably have
expected it to be made public
considering the time and circum
stance of its writing.” The board
flid direct that the disciplinary
measure was not to be made a
part of Marshall’s academic rec
ord.
