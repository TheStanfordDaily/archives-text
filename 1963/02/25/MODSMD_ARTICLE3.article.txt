# Alexander Urges U.S. Understanding Of Latin America
## 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
“The basic challenge of Latin \
America is for us to join with '

Latin America into something!
which is worthy to be called the !
New World,” said Professor Rob
ert Alexander of Columbia Uni-1
verslty in his Friday evening ad- j
dross of the HR Latin America!
conference.

LATIN AMERICA is an awak
ening continent that wants social,
economic, and political change, he
explained. The people used to ac
cept their poor way of life but
are becoming aware of their lot
and desire improvement, he said.
Revolutionary changes in Latin

America began, not with Castro,

hut in the nineteenth century j
when America looked to Latin
America for economic goods, he (
asserted. Latin America used to 1
he dominated by a small land
owning oligarchy that differed
from the mass of people in their
religion, race and culture. “Since
the nineteenth century the middle
class has gained in power, cities 1
have grown, the economic market
has greatly expanded, and land
has been distributed through
agrarian reform,” he said; nation- j
alism has become the dominant
ideology.
ALEXANDER pointed out that
economic growth increased furth
er during the two world wars
when Latin America found she'
could not depend on others for
her economic goods. The world,
in particular the United States, (
must increase its awareness and ,
understanding of Latin America, |
he said; “we must clarify the U.S.
policy to Latin America, and must
clear up the inconsistences in
carrying out the policies.”
We need not fear the Fidel
following students, according to
Alexander; students are no longer)
greatly influential as they were (
in the 1920’s when the middle class ■
was small. Now labor unions, con- \
taining little communist influence,
have risen to power, he explained.
The “Fidelistas”, or “Jacobin
Left” young people who go to
the hills with guns have little
influence; Communist strength
lies in the older, orthodox com
munists who have been present
in Latin America for a long time,
and have influence in political
groups. “There is a growing di
vergence between the “Fidelistas”
and the orthodox Communists,”
Alexander noted in conclusion.

sor of political science at Colum

professorship of economics at
Rutgers. He has written many
books and articles on Latin Amer
ica.

“The basic challenge of Latin \
America is for us to join with '

Latin America into something!
which is worthy to be called the !
New World,” said Professor Rob
ert Alexander of Columbia Uni-1
verslty in his Friday evening ad- j
dross of the HR Latin America!
conference.

LATIN AMERICA is an awak
ening continent that wants social,
economic, and political change, he
explained. The people used to ac
cept their poor way of life but
are becoming aware of their lot
and desire improvement, he said.
Revolutionary changes in Latin

America began, not with Castro,

hut in the nineteenth century j
when America looked to Latin
America for economic goods, he (
asserted. Latin America used to 1
he dominated by a small land
owning oligarchy that differed
from the mass of people in their
religion, race and culture. “Since
the nineteenth century the middle
class has gained in power, cities 1
have grown, the economic market
has greatly expanded, and land
has been distributed through
agrarian reform,” he said; nation- j
alism has become the dominant
ideology.
ALEXANDER pointed out that
economic growth increased furth
er during the two world wars
when Latin America found she'
could not depend on others for
her economic goods. The world,
in particular the United States, (
must increase its awareness and ,
understanding of Latin America, |
he said; “we must clarify the U.S.
policy to Latin America, and must
clear up the inconsistences in
carrying out the policies.”
We need not fear the Fidel
following students, according to
Alexander; students are no longer)
greatly influential as they were (
in the 1920’s when the middle class ■
was small. Now labor unions, con- \
taining little communist influence,
have risen to power, he explained.
The “Fidelistas”, or “Jacobin
Left” young people who go to
the hills with guns have little
influence; Communist strength
lies in the older, orthodox com
munists who have been present
in Latin America for a long time,
and have influence in political
groups. “There is a growing di
vergence between the “Fidelistas”
and the orthodox Communists,”
Alexander noted in conclusion.
