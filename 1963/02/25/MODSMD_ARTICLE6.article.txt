Professional photography, pho
to-journalism, documentary film
directing, and the Film Forum
are some of the many activities
of a talented young man in the
Communications Department.
Jim Black, a journalist from
Washington, D.C., with a B.A.
from George Washington Univer
sity last June, is on fellowship
here to be trained as a documen

j tary film director. Eventually he j
( will direct programs such as “CBS j
| Reports,” “to make citizens re- i
I aware through film.” His grad-,
( uate thesis project is producing '
, a film of this sort on the Califor
nia Youth Symphony.
HARDLY ALLOWED to devote
himself exclusively to that proj
ect, Black is also involved with
the Film Forum, an adjunct to
the University community that is
i an extra-curricular must for mem
: hers of the Communications De- |
; part ment.
The Film Forum is a “closed
I Society” of approximately 110 (
i members, 30 per cent of them |
faculty. The members view for- j
| eign film classics, not because of
j their entertainment value alone, (
j but because they are significant |
( events in movie history.
As Black says, for most fields
j of study, ample literature is read- (
ily available in the library. For I
| motion pictures, only so much ,
( history and technique can be j
j absorbed from books; then the (
1 student has to see the films them- j
| solves. The problem is that most
j American film budgets cannot {
1 maintain these classic films. No i
j prints are available for education; !
j the only way to see the films is j
| to rent them. But on campus, the J
I Film Forum makes these classics 1
| available.
WHEN HIS DUTIES with the
Film Forum ease off, Black will (
j be utilizing his spare time orga- (
! nizing his one-man photography
exhibit, to be held outside at Tres
| idder in April.
Black is hoping to use this [
I show as a rallying point for pho- I

| tography here at Stanford, and
j ultimately a photography society
| on campus. The proposed society
iwou 1 cl include student-faculty
( competition, seminars, and cri
| tiques. The society would be a
(“training-ground”, a place where
(advice, or help, is available, and
also a “clearinghouse for cquip
| ment.”
As a professional photographer
and past teaching-assistant in pho
| tography, Black is well-qualified
i to offer the kind of help amateurs
( need and want. His philosophy is
simply that photography is “just
1 learning what not to do—up to a
| point.” Beyond that point will be
j readily available advice.
BLACK CAN also give much
I valuable information to budding
| photo-journalists on what he calls
( the “ability to put pictures and
| type together.” It is a skill that
j involves using pictures and type
j in a meaningful spatial relation
| ship of placement and emphasis.
“It takes savvy and a little tech
nical ability mostly savvy,” says
Black.
As far as Black is concerned, a
(photo-journalist must train him
self to get keyed and stay that
! way, responding with his whole
j mind and body to catch the pic
(ture with news value before it is
( irrevocably gone. Part of this sen
sitivity to “news value” is an all
(around education that helps the
j photographer to size-up the situa
( tion and know what is needed for
his reading public.
With the advent of his one-man
j show at Tresidder, Black hopes to
[ get this photographic society off
I on a running start.
