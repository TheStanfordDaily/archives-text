# Communist Banned from Cal
## 
### 
Last Thursday Herbert Apthek
er, a member of the American
Communist Party, arrived in
Berkeley to speak to University
of California students, and was
banned from talking on campus
by University Regulation No. 5.
Unperturbed, Aptheker and his
sponsors moved off campus to ad
dress a SRO crowd of about 175
people in Stiles Hall.
Sponsored by Cal’s WEB Du
Bois Club, Aptheker is the editor
of the official theoretical organ
of the American Communist
Party, “Political Affairs.” He
spoke once before on the Cal
campus, in 1961, when he was
picketed by the now extinct Stu
dents Associated Against Totali
tarianism.
APTHEKER confined his re
marks Thursday to a discussion
of socialism in America. As re
ported in the Daily Californian,
ho said that socialism “can come
only when the overwhelming ma
jority of citizens want it."
Later in the week the Young

People's Socialist League spon
sored a debate between Aptheker
and the Socialist Bogden Denitch,
and the History Department had
him in a colloquium. Both func
tions were held off campus.
There was apparently no furor
over the University’s ban, but the
Du Bois club did issue a state
ment censuring the regulation.
“IT IS A TRAGKDV of our
time that college students are for
bidden to confront Dr. Aptheker
and the views which he presents
in the halls of the University,”
the Daily Californian quoted.
“It is an insult to our intelli
gence for the ASUC to sponsor
such self-styled ‘experts’ on com
munism as . . . Barry Goldwater
. . . without providing an oppor
tunity for us to confront those
with a first-hand knowledge of
the subject,” the statement said.
