# African Students in Bulgaria Harassed; Officials Ignored Their Appeals

### ROBERT ROTEY 
Secretary of the Ghana Students Union
In Bulgaria
(Editors' Note: This article, the first of
three parts, tells of the events which caused
a large number of African students in Bul
garia hi leave tlie country and attempt to
pursue their education elsewhere. It was dis
tributed by UOSEC, the (’oordenating Secre
tariat of National Unions of Students in Lei
den, Netherlands.)
It has been my unhappy lot to serve as the
informal leader of a group of 20 Ghanaian
students—all of those Ghanaians studying in
Sofia, Bulgaria—who have been forced by cir
cumstances to interrupt our studies and to
seek new countries in which to pursue them.
It was a painful decision which we and almost
all the other African students in Bulgaria
have taken, hut when denied police protection
in the face of a pattern of consistent racial
discrimination, when denied the right to or
ganize an All-African Students Union, when
our very lives were threatened, it was clearly
not possible for us to remain in the country.
My own experience began when I applied
for a scholarship to study in my chosen field

of economics, and my government, which has
worked out scholarship agreements with a
number of other governments in both the
East and the West, selected me for a position
in Bulgaria. In December. 1961, a number of
Ghanaian students—who had been selected
solely on the basis of educational qualifica
tions—flew from Accra to Sofia to begin our
higher education.
WE HAD COME WITH open minds, and in
the beginning we were filled with high hopes.
We received a friendly welcome from many
Bulgarian people, and wo were placed in the
same hostels, even the some rooms, with our
Bulgarian fellow students. We set about the
formidable task of mastering the Bulgarian
language in order that we might bo able to
understand our textbooks and lectures.

Early in the year, however, we began to
experience some difficulties. We had come to
Bulgaria to study, and not to live luxuriously,
but living conditions turned out to bo not
nearly so good as we had expected—not as
good as they arc for university students in
Ghana itself. We were unhappy at being
cramped four in a room which was only 14 by
9 feet, with four beds and one table in the

middle with a chair at either end. It made
studying very inconvenient, as some in the
room had to sit or lie on their beds in order
to read. Our living allowance came to only 124
a month, fully £lB of which had to go for food,
and this left little over for books, recreation,
transportation, and supplies.
We had all arrived in tropical weight cloth
ing and were given no allowance to purchase
clothes, so that simply trying to keep warm
in the cold Bulgarian winter posed a real eco
nomic hardship.

WE BROUGHT OpR problems to the at
tention of the University authorities, who re
plied that there was no way out of our diffi
culties. We later appealed to the Minister of
Education, who told us that ho would do some
thing to help. He never did, however, and
eventually we were forced to turn to the
government of Ghana, which sympathized
with us and provided us with an additional
living allowance of £lO a month.

As time went on our relations with the Bul
garian students and people took a disturbing
turn. We had been impressed from the begin
ning with the large number of misconceptions
and general ignorance in the country concern-

ing modern Africa. From students to profes
sors they seemed in total darkness concerning
our continent; all they appear to have been
told is that it is “too hot,” that we still have
snakes in the streets, and the people go about
naked. They were very surprised, in fact,
when we told them that the suits we were
wearing had been made in Ghana. They
seemed to expect that we would be wearing
leaves to cover ourselves.

African students increasingly became the
objects of harassment by some of the Bul
garian students and people. We were called
all sorts of names as we walked along the
streets, names such as “black monkeys” and
“jungle people” which were insults not only
to ourselves but to all of Africa. Boys were
spat upon from buses and trains, or had
water poured on their heads as they walked
beneath windows. A vicious rumor was start
ed which alleged that we were all suffering
from venereal disease, and boys in the streets
would shout “syphilis” at us as we passed.
We finally had to demand that we all be given
medical examinaitons to disprove this charge.
Although the tests showed that not one of us
had such a disease, the government refused

to give any publicity to the results.
RACIALISM IN BULGARIA frequently
took violent forms. For example, a Nigerian
student was waiting for a bus to take him to
the hostel when he was approached by a group
of Bulgarians who had left a restaurant and
who were laughing, spitting and calling
names. Taking them to be happily drunk he
did not take offense but joined in their laugh
ter. At this point one of the Bulgarians
grabbed him by the collar and gave him a
blow, while a policeman standing by made
no effort to help. The Nigerian reported the
incident and the negligence of the policeman,
but nothing was ever done about it. Frequent
ly African students had the experience of be
ing beaten up by Bulgarians while a police
man nearby would protest that he could do
nothing because he was assigned to another
district, or would merely disperse the crowd
while letting the beating continue.
We continued to have some good friends
among the Bulgarian students and people, but
the Bulgarian government took no steps to
stamp out the hooliganism against us, and
this led us to conclude that it was being sup
ported from "above.”
