# Spindler Panel Members Claim U.S. Negroes Not Racial Group
## 
### NORMAN REITZ 
“Negroes are not a racial
group in the United States,” said
Roy Dandrade in a panel discus
sion yesterday in Tresidder Un
ion on “Contemporary Views of
Race.”

An estimated eighty per cent
of American Negroes have while
blood, he said, so they cannot be
classified as a distinct race. In
the United States, he said, wo
have, “a caste system which is
typically marked by a fear of
pollution of one group by the
other.”

Dandrade and the other panel
members from the Anthropology
Department, Alan Beals and Bert
Gerow. covered the contemporary
view's of race following an open
ing statement by the moderator,
Professor George Spindler.

SPINDLER divided the discus
sion into the consideration of
three questions; It What is race?
2) How are race and culture re
lated? and 3) How can we ex
plain the lower average IQ of the
Negro?
Race is a recent development,
said Bert Gerow. It is difficult,
ho said, to find fossil differences
farther back than 25 thousand
years which would indicate

unique racial characteristics.
Non-determinable features such
as straightness of hair or color of
skin are superficial aspects of
race which are over-emphasized
in our society but which are trivi
al genetic traits, said Roy Dan
drade.

Most of the analyses of the re
lationship between race and cul
ture, said Alan Beals, is descrip
tive. The complexity of political
organization and the type of econ
omy are sometimes rated and the
conclusion drawn is that Africa
is backward and Europe is mod
ernized because of innate racial
differences. But, Beals said, the
differences are directly attributa
ble to geographical advantages
and to access to information from
other cultures. There is no corre
lation between race and culture,
he said.

ON INTELLIGENCE tests
given by the Army, Negroes have
consistently scored twenty points
lower than whites, Dandrade said.
But, he said, this is primarily
due to unfamiliarity with the ter
minology used on the tests. He
cited tests in which literate New
York Negroes outscored literate
Alabama whites. The test results
appear to reflect the sociological
rather than the biological back
ground.

The level of achievement of the
intelligent American Negro is
lower than that of the white
American with a comparable in
telligence, Dandrade said. He pos
tulated four possible reasons for
this discrepancy: 1) the ambiti
ous Negro is considered to be ag
gressive and evokes a response of
hostility from his white counter
part, 2) the Negro doesn’t want
(he Joss of Negro companionship
which success might bring, 3) the
Negro is expected to fail so he
has a built-in excuse, and 4) con
stant mistreatment leads to an
ger and rage which leads to frus
tration which leads to an inhibi
tion of one’s faculties.
In any society there are those
who have to use others to ration
alize and justify their own posi
tion. Spindler said. And in conclu
sion he chided the current at
tempts to scientifically establish
the inferiority of one and the su
periority of another race by those
who express, “an eagerness to
seize upon anything which might
contribute to a racist position.”

ble to geographical advantages
and to access to information from
other cultures. There is no corre
lation between race and culture,
he said.

ON INTELLIGENCE tests
given by the Army, Negroes have
consistently scored twenty points
lower than whites, Dandrade said.
But, he said, this is primarily
due to unfamiliarity with the ter
minology used on the tests. He
cited tests in which literate New
York Negroes outscored literate
Alabama whites. The test results
appear to reflect the sociological
rather than the biological back
ground.

The level of achievement of the
intelligent American Negro is
lower than that of the white
American with a comparable in
telligence, Dandrade said. He pos
tulated four possible reasons for
this discrepancy: 1) the ambiti
ous Negro is considered to be ag
gressive and evokes a response of
hostility from his white counter
part, 2) the Negro doesn’t want
(he Joss of Negro companionship
which success might bring, 3) the
Negro is expected to fail so he
has a built-in excuse, and 4) con
stant mistreatment leads to an
ger and rage which leads to frus
tration which leads to an inhibi
tion of one’s faculties.
In any society there are those
who have to use others to ration
alize and justify their own posi
tion. Spindler said. And in conclu
sion he chided the current at
tempts to scientifically establish
the inferiority of one and the su
periority of another race by those
who express, “an eagerness to
seize upon anything which might
contribute to a racist position.”
“Negroes are not a racial
group in the United States,” said
Roy Dandrade in a panel discus
sion yesterday in Tresidder Un
ion on “Contemporary Views of
Race.”

An estimated eighty per cent
of American Negroes have while
blood, he said, so they cannot be
classified as a distinct race. In
the United States, he said, wo
have, “a caste system which is
typically marked by a fear of
pollution of one group by the
other.”

Dandrade and the other panel
members from the Anthropology
Department, Alan Beals and Bert
Gerow. covered the contemporary
view's of race following an open
ing statement by the moderator,
Professor George Spindler.

SPINDLER divided the discus
sion into the consideration of
three questions; It What is race?
2) How are race and culture re
lated? and 3) How can we ex
plain the lower average IQ of the
Negro?
Race is a recent development,
said Bert Gerow. It is difficult,
ho said, to find fossil differences
farther back than 25 thousand
years which would indicate

unique racial characteristics.
Non-determinable features such
as straightness of hair or color of
skin are superficial aspects of
race which are over-emphasized
in our society but which are trivi
al genetic traits, said Roy Dan
drade.

Most of the analyses of the re
lationship between race and cul
ture, said Alan Beals, is descrip
tive. The complexity of political
organization and the type of econ
omy are sometimes rated and the
conclusion drawn is that Africa
is backward and Europe is mod
ernized because of innate racial
differences. But, Beals said, the
differences are directly attributa
ble to geographical advantages
and to access to information from
other cultures. There is no corre
lation between race and culture,
