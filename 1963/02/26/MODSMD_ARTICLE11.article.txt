# Nelson Seeks Next Financial Manager
## 
### 
Fred Nelson, the present stu
dent financial manager, is comb
ing the Quad for next year’s
Scrooge McDuck.
He said that his job requires a
“total commitment.” The next
three months will be spent break
ing the new manager in.
NELSON believes “the practi
cal benefits of the job can’t be
equalled.” It gives experience in
handling both large and small
matters dealing with the ASSU,
the University, and the outside
world.

Besides the benefits provided
through experience, the position
also offers: a salary paid by the
University, the biggest desk of
any student officer, and four
telephone extensions.
The job takes 50 hours a week
on the average, Nelson estimates.
This is why it is traditional for
the student financial manager to
carry eight academic units a

quarter.
Nelson sees his job as both
complex and challenging. He ex
plained that roughly 250 student
organizations bank their money
with the ASSU. The turnover
averages $1 million a year. Such
a large operation requires the
use of purchase orders to keep
things straight.
THE ASSU budget alone runs
to $70,000 a year. This covers the
functions of the 25 ASSU created
groups such as the Political Un
ion, the HR, and (he Debate
Team.
Nelson sees his duties as falling
into three overlapping categories:
1) he is the agent of the Dean of
Students (who appoints him) for
the operations of the student or
ganizations fund; 2) he is the fi
nancial agent for ASSU organiza
tions and finances and is responsi
ble to them; and 3) he is the
agent of the student body presi
dent for the management of the
j ASSU office activities.
Applications for the position of
student financial manager are
available in the ASSU office. The
deadline is March 1.
