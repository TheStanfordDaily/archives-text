# Bulgarian Students, HR and the NSA
## 
### 
The United States National Student Association, of which
Stanford is a member, announced last week the creation of
an “African Freedom Fund” to transport and place the 300
African students who last week announced their decision to
terminate their study at Bulgarian universities.
The students, who are from twenty-two African nations
and territories, objected to the country’s attempts to indoctri
nate them and to control their efforts to form an All African
Students’ Union. The students also cited a great deal of racial
discrimination and suppression.
The NSA, working with the Coordinating Secretariat of
National Unions (COSEC) in Leiden, Netherlands, and the
Ghanian Embassy, are presently interviewing a number of
the African students, and are attempting to find other places
for them—according to their specific needs and abilities—in
Western Europe, African and American Universities.
The NSA, in the past week, has raised $15,000 to help pro
vide for scholarship funds, residence, and transportation ex
penses. The NSA is now looking for universities in the U.S.A.
to take the students.
Stanford’s Institute of International Relations has also
tried to help the students, and has sent out letters to see what
they can do. Unfortunately, the HR and the NSA have only
learned of each other’s projects in the last few days.
Now, however, each organization does know about the
others activities and can make use of each other’s facilities.
COSEC is infinitely better qualified to interview and pre
scribe placement for the students than HR or Stanford.
COSEC and the NSA know the problems and questions in
volved much better than HR, and have the personnel and
physical set-up to take care of them.
At the same time, the HR can lend its energy to finding
places at Stanford for those Bulgarian students who are
qualified to come here, and can help to raise the funds needed
for their transportation and care.
It would be a mistake for the HR to attempt to tackle the
problem by itself, but, by working with NSA, success can be
achieved. Membership in NSA offers unique benefits; Stan
ford student organizations should take advantage of them.
