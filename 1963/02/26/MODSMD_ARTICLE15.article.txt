# PLAY REVIEW
## 'Volpone' Called 'Superb' 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
The Actor’s Workshop is giving Ben Jonson’s satire “Vol
pone,” playing Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays at Marine’s
Theater in San Francisco, and as rollicking and fasl-pased a pro
duction as has been seen anywhere for a long time.
“Volpone,” set in the subtle atmosphere of Venice, is about
a rich old miser without legitimate heirs who with his parasite
seeks to augment his riches by playing off one against the other
the mutually suspicious contenders for his fortune. As a bitter
castigation of greed Jonson’s satire is unsurpassed. The Work
shop cast has admirably solver! (he monumental task of forging
the tightly compressed dramatic verse of Jonson into living
speech. They are rewarded by an idiom which expresses in one
line what a looser diction might say in ten. At moments, notably
in the trial scene, the barriers between the Elizabethans and
ourselves break down completely and we are living in Jonson’s
world: a universe scaled to size, in which classical eloquence is
instinctual utterance.
Robert Symonds’ direction is undoubtedly responsible for
the high polish annd pure entertainment of the production. Sy
monds is equally remarkable as old Volpone himself. He per
forms with elastic dexterity the thousand-and-one variations on
Volpone’s central humor—avarice. When he ventures into love,
the contrast between Volpone’s seductive cleverness and the
sting of its frustrations points up the fatal limitation imposed
by the miser’s destiny. When the fox is caught in the trap, he
accepts his situation with the resoluteness of a man who knows
his temperament could not have been otherwise.
Robert Phalen, with his forked beard and suit of mail like
the skin of a fly. is a most excellent Mosca, Volpone’s clever
parasite who worms his way into indispensibility. Phalen pro
duces the quick, sharp movements and ineluctible presence of
mind essential in the parasite. Paul Rebillot as Nano the Dwarf,
Robert Benson as Castrone the eunuch, and Frank Bayer as
Androgyne the Hermaphodite perform some vastly entertaining
singing and dancing. They have a tendency towards the gro
tesque; but that is dampened by the wittiness of Rebillot’s Nano.
Volpone’s three potential heirs fit into their roles like hand
in glove. Irving Israel as Corhaccio the decrepit raven, with
cane in one hand and ear-trumpet in the other, provides an en
tertaining character part. Glen Mazen as Voltore the advocate,
lurking vulture-like within the sinister folds of his black robe,
brings out the lawyer’s full hypocrisy in the passionate trial
scene. James Gavin in his swept-wing cloak as the crow Corvine,
a spruce merchant, is ruthless in his pander’s pursuit of Vol
pone’s gold.
Elizabeth Huddle as Corvino’s wife Celia accepts the limita
tions of her role and produces an engaging portrait of Celia’s
gentleness and innocence. Edward Winter supports her well in
the Prince Charming part of Bonario, Corbaccio’s son. Mara
Alexander appears to be having great fun in the contrasting
role of Lady Politic Would-Be.
Tom Rosqui as self-important, empty-headed Sir Politic
Would-Be recreates the figure of the foolish English knight by
facial expression and intonation. Soby Kalman as Peregrine the
gentleman traveler, however, might be more convincing if he
would get rid of his un-English accent.
The play is excellently framed by a set of seven standards
representing the seven cardinal sins, gold skeletons on a red
cloth background, which extend across the stage at rise and are
replaced at final curtain. As the play opens five of the standards
are carried off, and only Lust and Ency remain to haunt the
scene. The multi-functional setting is a successful compromise
between the sceneryless Elizabethan stage and the modern pro
scenium arch setting. The background music adds still another
dimension to this superlative production.

pone’s gold.
Elizabeth Huddle as Corvino’s wife Celia accepts the limita
tions of her role and produces an engaging portrait of Celia’s
gentleness and innocence. Edward Winter supports her well in
the Prince Charming part of Bonario, Corbaccio’s son. Mara
Alexander appears to be having great fun in the contrasting
role of Lady Politic Would-Be.
Tom Rosqui as self-important, empty-headed Sir Politic
Would-Be recreates the figure of the foolish English knight by
facial expression and intonation. Soby Kalman as Peregrine the
gentleman traveler, however, might be more convincing if he
would get rid of his un-English accent.
The play is excellently framed by a set of seven standards
representing the seven cardinal sins, gold skeletons on a red
cloth background, which extend across the stage at rise and are
replaced at final curtain. As the play opens five of the standards
are carried off, and only Lust and Ency remain to haunt the
scene. The multi-functional setting is a successful compromise
between the sceneryless Elizabethan stage and the modern pro
scenium arch setting. The background music adds still another
dimension to this superlative production.
The Actor’s Workshop is giving Ben Jonson’s satire “Vol
pone,” playing Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays at Marine’s
Theater in San Francisco, and as rollicking and fasl-pased a pro
duction as has been seen anywhere for a long time.
“Volpone,” set in the subtle atmosphere of Venice, is about
a rich old miser without legitimate heirs who with his parasite
seeks to augment his riches by playing off one against the other
the mutually suspicious contenders for his fortune. As a bitter
castigation of greed Jonson’s satire is unsurpassed. The Work
shop cast has admirably solver! (he monumental task of forging
the tightly compressed dramatic verse of Jonson into living
speech. They are rewarded by an idiom which expresses in one
line what a looser diction might say in ten. At moments, notably
in the trial scene, the barriers between the Elizabethans and
ourselves break down completely and we are living in Jonson’s
world: a universe scaled to size, in which classical eloquence is
instinctual utterance.
Robert Symonds’ direction is undoubtedly responsible for
the high polish annd pure entertainment of the production. Sy
monds is equally remarkable as old Volpone himself. He per
forms with elastic dexterity the thousand-and-one variations on
Volpone’s central humor—avarice. When he ventures into love,
the contrast between Volpone’s seductive cleverness and the
sting of its frustrations points up the fatal limitation imposed
by the miser’s destiny. When the fox is caught in the trap, he
accepts his situation with the resoluteness of a man who knows
his temperament could not have been otherwise.
Robert Phalen, with his forked beard and suit of mail like
the skin of a fly. is a most excellent Mosca, Volpone’s clever
parasite who worms his way into indispensibility. Phalen pro
duces the quick, sharp movements and ineluctible presence of
mind essential in the parasite. Paul Rebillot as Nano the Dwarf,
Robert Benson as Castrone the eunuch, and Frank Bayer as
Androgyne the Hermaphodite perform some vastly entertaining
singing and dancing. They have a tendency towards the gro
tesque; but that is dampened by the wittiness of Rebillot’s Nano.
Volpone’s three potential heirs fit into their roles like hand
in glove. Irving Israel as Corhaccio the decrepit raven, with
cane in one hand and ear-trumpet in the other, provides an en
tertaining character part. Glen Mazen as Voltore the advocate,
lurking vulture-like within the sinister folds of his black robe,
brings out the lawyer’s full hypocrisy in the passionate trial
scene. James Gavin in his swept-wing cloak as the crow Corvine,
a spruce merchant, is ruthless in his pander’s pursuit of Vol
pone’s gold.
