## Supporters Harm Aid-to-Education 
### Collegiate Press Service 
WASHINGTON—The friends of President Kennedy’s new
aid-to-education program are once again killing its chances of
becoming law.
It may seem ironical—but it’s nothing new. Internecine
strife between groups backing increased federal aid to education
have killed similar programs before,
Kennedy’s sweeping new omnibus education proposal would
assist American education from the first grade to the post-gradu
ate level, through construction loans, matching funds and stu
dent loan plans.
Opponents of federal aid to education are (his year relaxing
while the measure’s proponents kill its chances. Once again, the
apparent cause of death will be the church-state dispute: the
administration program would give $1.5 billion to assist public
elementary and secondary schools, with no aid to go to private
schools at the same level.
The main antagonists in the dispute are the National Edu
cation Association (NEA), which considers the administration
plan near-perfect, and the National Catholic Welfare Conference,
which asserts the program is unfair to parents who pay public
school taxes as well as extra tuition to send their children to
parochial and private schools.
Backers of the administration plan assert that federal aid
to private and church-supported schools violates the Constitu
tion and the traditional doctrine of; separation of church and
state—while the opponents hold thai (he administration's way of
doing things would discriminate against Catholic and other tax
payers who also pay to support private schools. These opposing
views are held by a sufficient number of Congressmen to block
passage of the legislation entirely, as indeed happened in the
last Congress.
There are some indications that the two factions may com
promise to get some of the legislation through Congress, but the
groups have yet to settle on a suitable agreement. Kennedy’s
program would give indirect benefits to private schools—but
these are called inadequate by Catholic spokesmen. One feature
of the plan would make construction loans for specialized class
rooms and laboratories available to private schools, and another
portion of the program would extend the “forgiveness" of Na
tional Defense Education Act loans to teachers in private schools.
Since the two opposing factions have yet to settle on a com
promise, Washington educational circles and lobbyists are giving
increased support to a “salvage job” on the program, to get
through what can be gotten through this session. In other words,
colleges and universities are hopeful that legislation benefitting
both sides will be divorced from the omnibus bills and passed.
