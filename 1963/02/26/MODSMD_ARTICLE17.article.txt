Editors, The Daily:
Stanford, they say, is a good university and could be a great
one. Certainly it has unlimited potential, but this potential will
be realized, if ever, only in the far distant future.
Stanford's basic fault is its conservative philosophy. This is,
of course, typical of university administrations everywhere.
If an administration is going to accomplish anything, it has
to be pushed, and no one is more suited to do the pushing than
the student body. But this august group of scholars is a hotbed
of indifference. Even the oldest janitor does not remember the
last time a Daily editor got canned.
If there is one bona fide nut on this campus he is well
hidden. We even shun partisan politics on campus because the
Dean says, “Don’t touch.” Anyway, little Leland thought politics
was a dirty game. The fact that an overwhelming number of
Stanford students will vote in the next election has little effect
on either administration or student body.
What we need is a group of active Socialists, some Birchers.
and enough Communists to make Nixon blush. Who knows? It
might be interesting. For a change.

Editors, The Dally:
We should like to express our concern over any effort on
the part of the University to curtail collective student expression.
If opinions are clearly labeled, there should be no question
as to their source, and the University need take no responsibility
for their contents. These views will stand on their own merits,
and it will thus be the task of free minds to evaluate their worth.
We urge that re-evaluation of University policy on student
rights involve a realistic awareness that responsible students
are collectively exorcising their right of free speech and will
continue to do so in the future.
