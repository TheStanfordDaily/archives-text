# Project Amigos Established To Help Mexican Workers
## 
### MADELINE PUZO 
Anyone who has ever visited
Tijuana has been shocked by the
great number of jobless Mexicans
living on the outskirts of the
town.

These Mexicans immigrate each
year to the north from the interi
or of Mexico in the hopes of find
ing a job either in the United
States or in Tijuana, and of, per
haps, raising their standard of
living. Because there are not
enough jobs for the increasing
number of immigrants, these
workers are faced with inade
quate food supplies, medical care,
and educational facilities.

IN OHDEK TO help these
workers, a new philanthropic,
non profit organization has been
formed. Called Project Amigos,
it is planned to help promote ac
tivities concerned with social wel
fare, health, recreation, and edu
cation in Tijuana, Baja Califor
nia. The philosophy of Project
Amigos, as stated by Martin Le
bowitz, Chairman of the Teacher
Placement and Volunteer Work
Service Committee of the HR. is
“not to do for, but to work for
our neighbors to the end that
they can carry on by themselves.”

To begin Ihe project, ten used
Army barracks have been trans
ported to a Tijuana hillside, to be
used eventually as a social center.
Further plans, as outlined by Le
bowitz, call for “two buildings
dedicated to the teaching of basic
literacy, four barracks as elemen
tary classrooms, two as recrea
tion and crafts centers, one for
medical and social work, and one
for storage.”
THE TIJUANA government
has given its full support to the
young adult volunteers who have
worked on this first unit. But
much still remains to be done,
and Stanford students are being
offered now through Project Ami
gos an opportunity to help pro
mote the literacy, understanding,
good will and friendship of our
closest neighbors to the south.

Any students interested in
working with a group of Stan
ford volunteers on Project Ami
gos this summer may obtain ap
plications in the HR Loft. Lebo
witz pointed out to students in
terested in working that “a will
ing pair of hands can be put to
profitable use this summer and
leave a lasting achievement of
' friendship.”
