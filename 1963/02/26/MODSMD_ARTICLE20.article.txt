# INDIANS EDGED, 48-46
## Hull, Suvanto Set Card Records, But Trojans Win Swim Meet 
### JIM DONOVAN 
The Stanford Indian. s ? lost 48-46
to powerful U.S.C. on Saturday
at Encina pool, but in defeat per
formed more brilliantly than any
swimming team in the history of
the University. Tribe coach Jim
Gaughran eould only say, “It was
the greatest team performance I
have ever seen.”
The Trojans, ranked second
nationally last year, are even
stronger this season with the ad
dition of world record holders Jon
Konrads and Bob Bennett. Each
Indian personally met the chal
lenge of this juggernaut by swim
ming the greatest individual race
of his life,
MARTY HULL broke the world
record for the butterfly leg of the
medley with a time of 50.7 sec
onds. However, since it was a re
lay time, it wall not count as a
world record. The all time record

for the 100-yard butterfly is 51.9.
Allowing for a relay start, Hull’s
time would have been 51,4, or
good enough to better the world
record by half a second. The med
ley relay team, on the strength of
this superlative performance by
Hull and of brilliant efforts by
Pete Pettigrew, Paul Hait, and
Mike Doscher, chopped an amaz
ing five seconds off the old Stan
ford record and set a new one at
3:40.5.
Hull also broke the University
and Encina Pool records in the
200-yard butterfly with a 2:00.2,
easily defeating Bennett, who
placed third, nearly five seconds
behind.
ILLKA SUVANTO defeated
world record holder Konrads in
the 200-yard freestyle with a time
of 1:49.2, breaking his own Stan
ford record and the Encina Pool
record. Suvanto also won the 500-
yard freestyle event.
Pete Pettigrew set a personal
mark in the 200-yard backstroke,
turning in a 2:05.6, but placed
second to Chuck Klein of USC by
two-tenths of a second. Bill Lor
ton reached a personal high in
his leg of the freestyle relay. The
Indians defeated USC’s highly
rated freestyle team and broke
Stanford and Pool records with a
3:18.4.
ON FRIDAY Stanford warmed
up for Southern Cal with a home
meet against the University of
Utah. Coach Gaughran rested
most of his top swimmers with an
eye to the following day. He
planned to win, but not by too
much. Utah was surprisingly
strong and nipped Stanford 54-41
with the aid of a disputed deci
sion on the final relay. However
the meet was not a total disap
pointment. for Marty Hull set the
Stanford 200-yard breaststroke
record with a time of 2:22.3.
