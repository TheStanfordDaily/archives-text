# Baseballers Play USF
## 
### 
Stanford will try to vindicate
last week’s loss to USF when it
again takes on the Dons this
afternoon at Sunken Diamond,
the game beginning at .1 p.m. The
Dons’ 7-o victory came as a re
sult of eight Card fielding errors,
accounting for four unearned
runs.
Five sophomores started last
week’s game and three, outfield
er Bob Cox. infielder George
Thatcher, and pitcher Pete Dix
on, will probably see action this
afternoon.
