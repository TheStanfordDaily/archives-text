MOSCOW U.S. Ambassador Foy Kohler met yesterday with
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in an apparent effort to probe
Kremlin intentions regarding Russian troops in Cuba. The Soviet is
estimated to have 17,000 Russians still in Cuba, about 6.000 of them
in combat units. The Kohler-Gromyko talks fallowed Friday’s belli
cose speech by Defense Minister Marshal Rodion Malinovsky in
which he warned that any U.S. attack on Cuba would mean a devas
tating thermonuclear world war HI. Malinovsky’s threat, coupled
with Soviet stalling at the Geneva disarmament talks, has led to

speculation here the Kremlin may be swinging toward Communist
China’s hard-line foreign policy in an effort to smooth over the
Moscow-Peking quarrel.

KENNEKY MAY BOW TO CONGRESS WASHINGTON Presi
dent Kennedy declared yesterday that ho is willing to have Congress
jettison his lax reform proposals if they are going to stand in the
way of a $lO billion tax cut need to avoid a recession. His original
proposals to Congress called for a gross tax reduction of $13.5 billion
over three years. The government would recover more than $3 billion
of this through reform measures designed to tighten loopholes and
correct inequities.
