## 
### 
Selection of women sponsors for next year is getting under way
this week with explanatory meetings and distribution of applications.
All sophomore and junior women with a 2.0 grade-point average
or better arc eligible to apply for the program.
The sponsor has throe main tasks: acquainting the freshmen

’with Stanford, intellectually, cul
turally and socially; organizing a
dormitory program; and, proba
bly most important, helping in
dividual freshmen lo get as much
as possible out of their first year.
THE ONLY LIMITS to possi
bilities for contribution as a spon
sor are her own time and talents.
Each year, the potential of an in
creasingly interested and talented
freshman class, and the experi
ence of many years of sponsoring
add up to one of the most chal
lenging and satisfying areas of
participation in the University
for those who are selected.
There is no particular “ideal
type” of sponsor, but a definite
interest in, and commitment to,
doing a good job are necessary.
A short meeting will be held in
the Brannor lobby tonight at 7:15,
and tomorrow night in Roble at
7:15 to explain the application
and interview procedure.
THE SELECTION includes a
written questionnaire, to be com
pleted this quarter, and a person
al interview with the Sponsor
Choosing Committee at the begin
ning of Spring Quarter.
Those who are chosen to spon
sor next year will be notified by
mail during April. There will he
a hostel in May for old and new
sponsors, both men and women,
and several orientation sessions
in the following weeks, to help
acquaint new sponsors with some
of their responsibilities.
| Sponsors must return a few
