A particularly ugly incident occurred in
August, 19G2. Half a dozen Ghanaian students
missed dinner at the hostel dining room and
went to a nearby restaurant, the “Chuchu
liga.” There was music playing, and one of the
Ghanaians asked a Bulgarian girl in the res
taurant to dance with him. As they were
dancing a young soldier W'ent up to the girl
and asked her; "Is it not a shame for you to
dance with a black monkey?”
The Ghanaian did not want to make trou
ble, so he returned to his table, but just as he
was about to sit down another Bulgarian boy
pulled his chair out from behind him. and he
toppled onto the floor. Before ho could even
get back on his feet another Bulgarian knock
ed him over the head with a chair, and he fell
over unconscious. By this time the Ghanaians
were furious, and a general fight ensued be
tween the dozens of Bulgarians who were in
the restaurant and who poured in from the
streets and the handful of Ghanaian students

at their table.
Surprisingly enough, the Bulgarian police
who were in the restaurant did not attempt
to intervene but left the place immediately.
It was only when the Ghanaians appeared to
be holding their own against the Bulgarians,
despite the fact that they were so seriously
outnumbered, that the police returned and
broke up the fight. They made no effort to
find the young Bulgarians who had started
the fight, but rather arrested only the six
Ghanaians. Four of the six were wounded in
the fight, and they were released by the police
the next day. At the request of the Govern
ment of Ghana they were immediately flown
back to Accra. The two who were not wound
ed, however, were kept in jail for one full
month before their case came before any kind
of court for a hearing.
The only witnesses called were Bulgarians,
none of whom had themselves been arrested.
One of the students, George Anmah, was sen
tenced to one year in prison and the other,
E. A. Atliga, to three years. As a result of
pressure from the Ghanaian government they
were released and sent home, but the incident
created much concern among the African stu
dents remaining in Bulgaria.
PRIOR TO LAST YEAR there were only a
few African students—from Mali, the Sudan
and Guinea in Bulgaria, and there was,
therefore, no need for an all-African students’

organization. When we Ghanaian students ar
rived last year we found ourselves all in the
same hostel, and in order to sit together and
exchange views we formed the Ghana Stu
dents’ Union, of which I was elected secretary.
Wo never thought to ask the permission of
the authorities to form such an organization,
and we came to feel that they were prepared
to deal with us thus on individual national
bases.
We had gone to Bulgaria to study, not to
engage in politics, and we had in the begin
ning resisted the formation of an all-African
organization for fear that it might bo involved
in politics. It was only when we became con
vinced that an all-African organization in Bul
garia need have nothing to do with politics
that we agreed to form one.
When in November and December of 1962.
we took definite steps toward the organization
of the All-African Students’ Union, we had
several objectives in mind. First of all, we
wished to have a means by which we African
students could defend our interests in the ab
sence of police protection and look after our
welfare in the face of inadequate living con
ditions. Secondly, we wished to have an or
ganization which could bring us together in
the true spirit of pan-Africanism. We felt that
if our various national leaders are now fight
ing to unite all of Africa, as students it was
our duty to accelerate this realization in any

way we could. Thirdly, we wanted to foster
friendship between the Bulgarian youth and
the Africans.
BY DECEMBER we had drafted a constitu
tion of our AASU—which, with the participa
tion of students from 22 countries, represent
ed a true “voice of Africa”—and had elected a
list of seven officers, headed by Tetteh Tawiah
of Ghana, a student of philosophy. When the
Union had been formed we invited two in
dividuals to patronize it—the Ghanaian Am
bassador and, as an act of good will toward
the Bulgarian authorities, the Minister of Edu
cation.
We were surprised when shortly there
after Tawiah was called before the Minister of
Education and told (hat ho would have to dis
band the Union because it was against the
“principles” of Bulgaria. This was all the Bul
garian authorities ever said, then or later,
that in some strange way this genuinely pan-
African movement was “against our prin
ciples.” We sent a delegation to the Minister
of Education to present him with a copy of
our constitution and to explain our non-po
litical aims.
ON FEBRUARY 6 Tetteh Tawiah was
served with an order of expulsion from the
University, He was charged with having been
irregular in classes and having failed to take
an examination. Actually, in Bulgaria every
student has a report book (stydentska klnish

ka) which his professors and lecturers sign
when they are satisfied with his atendance at
classes, and in every case Tawiah’s book had
been signed. We would not have been con
vinced of the full implications of Tawiah’s
case had it not been for the fact that the Vice-
President of the AASU, Mr. Amlak of Ethio
pia, was also warned the next morning that
he would be expelled if he did not abide by
the regulations of the University. Wo decided
then that the actions of the authorities were
not based on the personal conduct of the two
students but rather on the hostility of the
Bulgarian government to the formation of an
organization which would unite all the African
students in the country.
On February 9, Tawiah was ordered to
leave Bulgaria within 12 hours. As news of
the order spread some 150 African students
gathered at the hostel and walked down Lenin
Street to the Prime Minister’s office. We
wished to demand the reinstatement of Ta
wiah in the University and the withdrawal of
the deportation order against him and to in
sist upon recognition of the AASU as the
representative voice of the African students.
When we arrived at the Ministry, however,
we were told by a man who said he was a
leader of the Bulgarian Komsomol (Young
Communist League) that the Prime Minister
was not available but that he would meet with
our representatives 9 o’clock Monday morning.

pia, was also warned the next morning that
he would be expelled if he did not abide by
the regulations of the University. Wo decided
then that the actions of the authorities were
not based on the personal conduct of the two
students but rather on the hostility of the
Bulgarian government to the formation of an
organization which would unite all the African
students in the country.
On February 9, Tawiah was ordered to
leave Bulgaria within 12 hours. As news of
the order spread some 150 African students
gathered at the hostel and walked down Lenin
Street to the Prime Minister’s office. We
wished to demand the reinstatement of Ta
wiah in the University and the withdrawal of
the deportation order against him and to in
sist upon recognition of the AASU as the
representative voice of the African students.
When we arrived at the Ministry, however,
we were told by a man who said he was a
leader of the Bulgarian Komsomol (Young
Communist League) that the Prime Minister
was not available but that he would meet with
our representatives 9 o’clock Monday morning.

A particularly ugly incident occurred in
August, 19G2. Half a dozen Ghanaian students
missed dinner at the hostel dining room and
went to a nearby restaurant, the “Chuchu
liga.” There was music playing, and one of the
Ghanaians asked a Bulgarian girl in the res
taurant to dance with him. As they were
dancing a young soldier W'ent up to the girl
and asked her; "Is it not a shame for you to
dance with a black monkey?”
The Ghanaian did not want to make trou
ble, so he returned to his table, but just as he
was about to sit down another Bulgarian boy
pulled his chair out from behind him. and he
toppled onto the floor. Before ho could even
get back on his feet another Bulgarian knock
ed him over the head with a chair, and he fell
over unconscious. By this time the Ghanaians
were furious, and a general fight ensued be
tween the dozens of Bulgarians who were in
the restaurant and who poured in from the
streets and the handful of Ghanaian students

at their table.
Surprisingly enough, the Bulgarian police
who were in the restaurant did not attempt
to intervene but left the place immediately.
It was only when the Ghanaians appeared to
be holding their own against the Bulgarians,
despite the fact that they were so seriously
outnumbered, that the police returned and
broke up the fight. They made no effort to
find the young Bulgarians who had started
the fight, but rather arrested only the six
Ghanaians. Four of the six were wounded in
the fight, and they were released by the police
the next day. At the request of the Govern
ment of Ghana they were immediately flown
back to Accra. The two who were not wound
ed, however, were kept in jail for one full
month before their case came before any kind
of court for a hearing.
The only witnesses called were Bulgarians,
none of whom had themselves been arrested.
One of the students, George Anmah, was sen
tenced to one year in prison and the other,
E. A. Atliga, to three years. As a result of
pressure from the Ghanaian government they
were released and sent home, but the incident
created much concern among the African stu
dents remaining in Bulgaria.
PRIOR TO LAST YEAR there were only a
few African students—from Mali, the Sudan
and Guinea in Bulgaria, and there was,
therefore, no need for an all-African students’

organization. When we Ghanaian students ar
rived last year we found ourselves all in the
same hostel, and in order to sit together and
exchange views we formed the Ghana Stu
dents’ Union, of which I was elected secretary.
Wo never thought to ask the permission of
the authorities to form such an organization,
and we came to feel that they were prepared
to deal with us thus on individual national
bases.
We had gone to Bulgaria to study, not to
engage in politics, and we had in the begin
ning resisted the formation of an all-African
organization for fear that it might bo involved
in politics. It was only when we became con
vinced that an all-African organization in Bul
garia need have nothing to do with politics
that we agreed to form one.
When in November and December of 1962.
we took definite steps toward the organization
of the All-African Students’ Union, we had
several objectives in mind. First of all, we
wished to have a means by which we African
students could defend our interests in the ab
sence of police protection and look after our
welfare in the face of inadequate living con
ditions. Secondly, we wished to have an or
ganization which could bring us together in
the true spirit of pan-Africanism. We felt that
if our various national leaders are now fight
ing to unite all of Africa, as students it was
our duty to accelerate this realization in any

way we could. Thirdly, we wanted to foster
friendship between the Bulgarian youth and
the Africans.
BY DECEMBER we had drafted a constitu
tion of our AASU—which, with the participa
tion of students from 22 countries, represent
ed a true “voice of Africa”—and had elected a
list of seven officers, headed by Tetteh Tawiah
of Ghana, a student of philosophy. When the
Union had been formed we invited two in
dividuals to patronize it—the Ghanaian Am
bassador and, as an act of good will toward
the Bulgarian authorities, the Minister of Edu
cation.
We were surprised when shortly there
after Tawiah was called before the Minister of
Education and told (hat ho would have to dis
band the Union because it was against the
“principles” of Bulgaria. This was all the Bul
garian authorities ever said, then or later,
that in some strange way this genuinely pan-
African movement was “against our prin
ciples.” We sent a delegation to the Minister
of Education to present him with a copy of
our constitution and to explain our non-po
litical aims.
ON FEBRUARY 6 Tetteh Tawiah was
served with an order of expulsion from the
University, He was charged with having been
irregular in classes and having failed to take
an examination. Actually, in Bulgaria every
student has a report book (stydentska klnish

ka) which his professors and lecturers sign
when they are satisfied with his atendance at
classes, and in every case Tawiah’s book had
been signed. We would not have been con
vinced of the full implications of Tawiah’s
case had it not been for the fact that the Vice-
President of the AASU, Mr. Amlak of Ethio
pia, was also warned the next morning that
he would be expelled if he did not abide by

after Tawiah was called before the Minister of
Education and told (hat ho would have to dis
band the Union because it was against the
“principles” of Bulgaria. This was all the Bul
garian authorities ever said, then or later,
that in some strange way this genuinely pan-
African movement was “against our prin
ciples.” We sent a delegation to the Minister
of Education to present him with a copy of
our constitution and to explain our non-po
litical aims.
ON FEBRUARY 6 Tetteh Tawiah was
served with an order of expulsion from the
University, He was charged with having been
irregular in classes and having failed to take
an examination. Actually, in Bulgaria every
student has a report book (stydentska klnish

ka) which his professors and lecturers sign
when they are satisfied with his atendance at
classes, and in every case Tawiah’s book had
been signed. We would not have been con
vinced of the full implications of Tawiah’s
case had it not been for the fact that the Vice-
President of the AASU, Mr. Amlak of Ethio
pia, was also warned the next morning that
he would be expelled if he did not abide by
the regulations of the University. Wo decided
then that the actions of the authorities were
not based on the personal conduct of the two
students but rather on the hostility of the
Bulgarian government to the formation of an
organization which would unite all the African
students in the country.
On February 9, Tawiah was ordered to
leave Bulgaria within 12 hours. As news of
the order spread some 150 African students
gathered at the hostel and walked down Lenin
Street to the Prime Minister’s office. We
wished to demand the reinstatement of Ta
wiah in the University and the withdrawal of
the deportation order against him and to in
sist upon recognition of the AASU as the
representative voice of the African students.
When we arrived at the Ministry, however,
we were told by a man who said he was a
leader of the Bulgarian Komsomol (Young
Communist League) that the Prime Minister
was not available but that he would meet with
our representatives 9 o’clock Monday morning.

A particularly ugly incident occurred in
August, 19G2. Half a dozen Ghanaian students
missed dinner at the hostel dining room and
went to a nearby restaurant, the “Chuchu
liga.” There was music playing, and one of the
Ghanaians asked a Bulgarian girl in the res
taurant to dance with him. As they were
dancing a young soldier W'ent up to the girl
and asked her; "Is it not a shame for you to
dance with a black monkey?”
The Ghanaian did not want to make trou
ble, so he returned to his table, but just as he
was about to sit down another Bulgarian boy
pulled his chair out from behind him. and he
toppled onto the floor. Before ho could even
get back on his feet another Bulgarian knock
ed him over the head with a chair, and he fell
over unconscious. By this time the Ghanaians
were furious, and a general fight ensued be
tween the dozens of Bulgarians who were in
the restaurant and who poured in from the
streets and the handful of Ghanaian students

at their table.
Surprisingly enough, the Bulgarian police
who were in the restaurant did not attempt
to intervene but left the place immediately.
It was only when the Ghanaians appeared to
be holding their own against the Bulgarians,
despite the fact that they were so seriously
outnumbered, that the police returned and
broke up the fight. They made no effort to
find the young Bulgarians who had started
the fight, but rather arrested only the six
Ghanaians. Four of the six were wounded in
the fight, and they were released by the police
the next day. At the request of the Govern
ment of Ghana they were immediately flown
back to Accra. The two who were not wound
ed, however, were kept in jail for one full
month before their case came before any kind
of court for a hearing.
The only witnesses called were Bulgarians,
none of whom had themselves been arrested.
One of the students, George Anmah, was sen
tenced to one year in prison and the other,
E. A. Atliga, to three years. As a result of
pressure from the Ghanaian government they
were released and sent home, but the incident
created much concern among the African stu
dents remaining in Bulgaria.
PRIOR TO LAST YEAR there were only a
few African students—from Mali, the Sudan
and Guinea in Bulgaria, and there was,
therefore, no need for an all-African students’

organization. When we Ghanaian students ar
rived last year we found ourselves all in the
same hostel, and in order to sit together and
exchange views we formed the Ghana Stu
dents’ Union, of which I was elected secretary.
Wo never thought to ask the permission of
the authorities to form such an organization,
and we came to feel that they were prepared
to deal with us thus on individual national
bases.
We had gone to Bulgaria to study, not to
engage in politics, and we had in the begin
ning resisted the formation of an all-African
organization for fear that it might bo involved
in politics. It was only when we became con
vinced that an all-African organization in Bul
garia need have nothing to do with politics
that we agreed to form one.
When in November and December of 1962.
we took definite steps toward the organization
of the All-African Students’ Union, we had
several objectives in mind. First of all, we
wished to have a means by which we African
students could defend our interests in the ab
sence of police protection and look after our
welfare in the face of inadequate living con
ditions. Secondly, we wished to have an or
ganization which could bring us together in
the true spirit of pan-Africanism. We felt that
if our various national leaders are now fight
ing to unite all of Africa, as students it was
our duty to accelerate this realization in any

way we could. Thirdly, we wanted to foster
friendship between the Bulgarian youth and
the Africans.
BY DECEMBER we had drafted a constitu
tion of our AASU—which, with the participa
tion of students from 22 countries, represent
ed a true “voice of Africa”—and had elected a
list of seven officers, headed by Tetteh Tawiah
of Ghana, a student of philosophy. When the
Union had been formed we invited two in
dividuals to patronize it—the Ghanaian Am
bassador and, as an act of good will toward
the Bulgarian authorities, the Minister of Edu
cation.
We were surprised when shortly there
after Tawiah was called before the Minister of

sence of police protection and look after our
welfare in the face of inadequate living con
ditions. Secondly, we wished to have an or
ganization which could bring us together in
the true spirit of pan-Africanism. We felt that
if our various national leaders are now fight
ing to unite all of Africa, as students it was
our duty to accelerate this realization in any

way we could. Thirdly, we wanted to foster
friendship between the Bulgarian youth and
the Africans.
BY DECEMBER we had drafted a constitu
tion of our AASU—which, with the participa
tion of students from 22 countries, represent
ed a true “voice of Africa”—and had elected a
list of seven officers, headed by Tetteh Tawiah
of Ghana, a student of philosophy. When the
Union had been formed we invited two in
dividuals to patronize it—the Ghanaian Am
bassador and, as an act of good will toward
the Bulgarian authorities, the Minister of Edu
cation.
We were surprised when shortly there
after Tawiah was called before the Minister of
Education and told (hat ho would have to dis
band the Union because it was against the
“principles” of Bulgaria. This was all the Bul
garian authorities ever said, then or later,
that in some strange way this genuinely pan-
African movement was “against our prin
ciples.” We sent a delegation to the Minister
of Education to present him with a copy of
our constitution and to explain our non-po
litical aims.
ON FEBRUARY 6 Tetteh Tawiah was
served with an order of expulsion from the
University, He was charged with having been
irregular in classes and having failed to take
an examination. Actually, in Bulgaria every
student has a report book (stydentska klnish

ka) which his professors and lecturers sign
when they are satisfied with his atendance at
classes, and in every case Tawiah’s book had
been signed. We would not have been con
vinced of the full implications of Tawiah’s
case had it not been for the fact that the Vice-
President of the AASU, Mr. Amlak of Ethio
pia, was also warned the next morning that
he would be expelled if he did not abide by
the regulations of the University. Wo decided
then that the actions of the authorities were
not based on the personal conduct of the two
students but rather on the hostility of the
Bulgarian government to the formation of an
organization which would unite all the African
students in the country.
On February 9, Tawiah was ordered to
leave Bulgaria within 12 hours. As news of
the order spread some 150 African students
gathered at the hostel and walked down Lenin
Street to the Prime Minister’s office. We
wished to demand the reinstatement of Ta
wiah in the University and the withdrawal of
the deportation order against him and to in
sist upon recognition of the AASU as the
representative voice of the African students.
When we arrived at the Ministry, however,
we were told by a man who said he was a
leader of the Bulgarian Komsomol (Young
Communist League) that the Prime Minister
was not available but that he would meet with
our representatives 9 o’clock Monday morning.

A particularly ugly incident occurred in
August, 19G2. Half a dozen Ghanaian students
missed dinner at the hostel dining room and
went to a nearby restaurant, the “Chuchu
liga.” There was music playing, and one of the
Ghanaians asked a Bulgarian girl in the res
taurant to dance with him. As they were
dancing a young soldier W'ent up to the girl
and asked her; "Is it not a shame for you to
dance with a black monkey?”
The Ghanaian did not want to make trou
ble, so he returned to his table, but just as he
was about to sit down another Bulgarian boy
pulled his chair out from behind him. and he
toppled onto the floor. Before ho could even
get back on his feet another Bulgarian knock
ed him over the head with a chair, and he fell
over unconscious. By this time the Ghanaians
were furious, and a general fight ensued be
tween the dozens of Bulgarians who were in
the restaurant and who poured in from the
streets and the handful of Ghanaian students

at their table.
Surprisingly enough, the Bulgarian police
who were in the restaurant did not attempt
to intervene but left the place immediately.
It was only when the Ghanaians appeared to
be holding their own against the Bulgarians,
despite the fact that they were so seriously
outnumbered, that the police returned and
broke up the fight. They made no effort to
find the young Bulgarians who had started
the fight, but rather arrested only the six
Ghanaians. Four of the six were wounded in
the fight, and they were released by the police
the next day. At the request of the Govern
ment of Ghana they were immediately flown
back to Accra. The two who were not wound
ed, however, were kept in jail for one full
month before their case came before any kind
of court for a hearing.
The only witnesses called were Bulgarians,
none of whom had themselves been arrested.
One of the students, George Anmah, was sen
tenced to one year in prison and the other,
E. A. Atliga, to three years. As a result of
pressure from the Ghanaian government they
were released and sent home, but the incident
created much concern among the African stu
dents remaining in Bulgaria.
PRIOR TO LAST YEAR there were only a
few African students—from Mali, the Sudan
and Guinea in Bulgaria, and there was,
therefore, no need for an all-African students’

organization. When we Ghanaian students ar
rived last year we found ourselves all in the
same hostel, and in order to sit together and
exchange views we formed the Ghana Stu
dents’ Union, of which I was elected secretary.
Wo never thought to ask the permission of
the authorities to form such an organization,
and we came to feel that they were prepared
to deal with us thus on individual national
bases.
We had gone to Bulgaria to study, not to
engage in politics, and we had in the begin
ning resisted the formation of an all-African
organization for fear that it might bo involved
in politics. It was only when we became con
vinced that an all-African organization in Bul
garia need have nothing to do with politics
that we agreed to form one.
When in November and December of 1962.
we took definite steps toward the organization
of the All-African Students’ Union, we had
several objectives in mind. First of all, we
wished to have a means by which we African
students could defend our interests in the ab
sence of police protection and look after our
welfare in the face of inadequate living con
ditions. Secondly, we wished to have an or
ganization which could bring us together in
the true spirit of pan-Africanism. We felt that
if our various national leaders are now fight
ing to unite all of Africa, as students it was
our duty to accelerate this realization in any

way we could. Thirdly, we wanted to foster
friendship between the Bulgarian youth and
the Africans.
