# S.U.N. to Open Today; Boland to Talk on China
## 
### WENDY DORTORT 
Frederick Henry Boland, Irish ambassador to the United
Nations and president of the fifteenth session of the General
Assembly, will officially open the Stanford United Nations Gen
eral Assembly at 4:15 p.m. today in Memorial Auditorium with
a speech on the issue of Chinese representation as it faces the

►U.N. today. The S.U.N. agenda
for Thursday includes a discus
sion on the China topic and an
other address by Boland on the
Berlin issue. World Government;
will be the subject for the ses
sions on Friday and Saturday;
the topic will be presented in a
talk by Louis B. Sohn, professor
of International Law at Harvard
Law School.
K. Venkata Raman of India,
president of the Stanford General
Assembly, stated that he has ac
cepted this position “as an honor
to his country.” Raman, a gradu
ate student of international law
and the United Nations, is study
ing under the International Legal
Studios Plan of the Stanford Law
School and working as an associ
ate of Professor of Law Carl
Spaeth.
Boland has been a UN repre
sentative since 1956. In 1958 he
was selected president of the UN
Trusteeship Committee. In this
position he stressed Ireland’s
anti-colonial stand, but favored
neither the colonial nor anti-co
lonial nations.
IRELAND’S POLICY, as guided
by Boland, is one of independence
rather than neutrality. He feels
that "the Western obsession with
defining such issues as the Hun
garian revolution in terms of the
cold war might antagonize the
neutral powers.”
Boland has hopes of making
the uncommitted nations a more
positive moderating force which
will act as an antidote to the
rigid thinking of the power blocs.
Believing that all important
questions of international rele
vance should be discussed openly,
Boland disagrees with the United
States’ policy of postponing de
bate on the issue of Red China’s
admittance.
IRELAND’S STAND on some
major issues of the past few
years include: disapproval of the
actions of Great Britain and
France in the Suez crisis, but a
criticism of Nasser for provoking
the attack; endorsement of Al
gerian self-determination; favor
of improvement of Arab-Israeli
relations, unification of Ger
many, and prevention of wider
dissemination of nuclear weap
ons.
KZSU will broadcast Boland’s
speech at 4:15 p.m. today.

Frederick Henry Boland, Irish ambassador to the United
Nations and president of the fifteenth session of the General
Assembly, will officially open the Stanford United Nations Gen
eral Assembly at 4:15 p.m. today in Memorial Auditorium with
a speech on the issue of Chinese representation as it faces the

►U.N. today. The S.U.N. agenda
for Thursday includes a discus
sion on the China topic and an
other address by Boland on the
Berlin issue. World Government;
will be the subject for the ses
sions on Friday and Saturday;
the topic will be presented in a
talk by Louis B. Sohn, professor
of International Law at Harvard
Law School.
K. Venkata Raman of India,
president of the Stanford General
Assembly, stated that he has ac
cepted this position “as an honor
to his country.” Raman, a gradu
ate student of international law
and the United Nations, is study
ing under the International Legal
Studios Plan of the Stanford Law
School and working as an associ
ate of Professor of Law Carl
Spaeth.
Boland has been a UN repre
sentative since 1956. In 1958 he
was selected president of the UN
Trusteeship Committee. In this
position he stressed Ireland’s
anti-colonial stand, but favored
neither the colonial nor anti-co
lonial nations.
IRELAND’S POLICY, as guided
by Boland, is one of independence
rather than neutrality. He feels
that "the Western obsession with
defining such issues as the Hun
garian revolution in terms of the
cold war might antagonize the
neutral powers.”
Boland has hopes of making
the uncommitted nations a more
positive moderating force which
will act as an antidote to the
rigid thinking of the power blocs.
Believing that all important
questions of international rele
vance should be discussed openly,
Boland disagrees with the United
States’ policy of postponing de
bate on the issue of Red China’s
admittance.
IRELAND’S STAND on some
major issues of the past few
years include: disapproval of the
actions of Great Britain and
France in the Suez crisis, but a
criticism of Nasser for provoking
the attack; endorsement of Al
gerian self-determination; favor
of improvement of Arab-Israeli
relations, unification of Ger
many, and prevention of wider
dissemination of nuclear weap
ons.
KZSU will broadcast Boland’s
speech at 4:15 p.m. today.
