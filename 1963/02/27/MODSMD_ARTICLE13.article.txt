# The
						Board and the New Constitution
## 
### 
In their meeting last Thursday, the Board of Trustees
came up with no decision regarding the proposed ASSU
constitution. Instead, they made plans to hear a “full report”
on the proposed constitution at their March meeting.
Will the Trustees vote on the constitution at their March
meeting? Or will they mull over the “full report” for yet an
other month while student government is strangled by their
indecision?
The proposed constitution was passed overwhelmingly by
the student body over three months ago. There has been
ample time for the Trustees to have heard and judged a re
port on the constitution. So much time has elapsed that un
less the Board of Trustees takes action at their next meeting,
spring elections will be hopelessly confused. Two legislatures
will have to be elected, one for each constitution.
Student government, even in a student body as predomi
nantly apathetic as Stanford’s, can play a meaningful role in
campus life. In their March meeting, the Board of Trustees
should act on the constitution and save student government
at Stanford from utter choas and from the disillusionment
which might mean its eventual dissolution.
