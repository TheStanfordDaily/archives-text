# New Rush System Faulty
## 
### 
This week finds the Stanford fraternities dragging them
selves through the fourth in a series of Winter Quarter open
houses. As a result, the Row is suffering from a severe case
of over-exposure.
Most students involved in the new rush procedure which
was originally planned to encourage a closer inspection of
both fraternity men and freshmen by one another, admit the
present arrangement is as much of a flop as was its prede
cessor. The earlier system suffered from the superficiality of
two Winter Quarter open houses; the present system suffers
from the superficiality of four such open houses.
Freshmen are canning the whole works in favor of the
Reformation, Western Civ’s offering of the week. Nothing
curtails a good rush quite as well as the successful efforts of
an Admissions Department to attract a class of academically
oriented freshmen.
More significant is the aversion (hat fraternity men them
selves have for the increased number of open houses. The row
is not known for its academic prowess in the first place, and
twenty hours spent on rush are certain not to better the situ
ation. One group averaged a 1.9 last quarter without opening
house or book. Unless someone comes up with a scheme
whereby academic credit is doled out for open houses, the
present system will only promote the slippage of the Row
down tiro non-academic rat hole.
The new rush program then is pulling the fraternity system
farther away from the rest of the academic community, fresh
men included. A university simply cannot do its job effectively
with such a growing schism between its residential and its
academic spheres.
