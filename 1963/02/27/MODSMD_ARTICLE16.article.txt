In his hook “Colombia, A Contemporary Political Survey,”
John D. Mart?, describes the background and present status of
the unique Colombian experiment with “controlled democracy.”
With two short but very illuminating chapters on the philosophy
and nature of traditional Colombian politics and Ihe existing socio
political conditions as background for the novice student of Co
lombian affairs, the author then plunges into a detailed well
written analysis of the country’s unusual recent political history.
Colombia is one of the few Latin American countries which
has an historic two-party system (over 150 years old). These two
parties are the Liberals, who uphold the separation of Church
and State, popular suffrage, and social and economic legislation
for the masses; and the Conservatives wtio urge close church
state cooperation, limited suffrage, maintenance of class privi
leges and rule by an elite.
But it is important to note that the leadership from both
parties is. with few exceptions, drawn from the privileged elite.
The first president with what might be termed a social con
science, who wrote into the constitution the unpopular (with the
oligarchy) affirmation that “public assistance is a function of
the state,” produced such a rift in his Liberal Party that they
lost the next presidential election. The resultant presidential
election of Mariano Ospina Perez in 1946 by a conservative mi
nority set the nation on the road to chaos.
One of Ospina Perez’s two liberal opponents was Jorge Elie
cer Gaitan, a man whose control over the masses has been ex
ceeded in Latin America only by Castro. At one time a social
revolutionary, Gaitan had taken a slight swing towards modera
tion. He was the first prominent political leader to come from
the lower classes and in many respects was the hope for the
masses (and the country). The oligarchy, however, shied away
from his reform program.

Ospina Perez assumed control of the presidency backed by
a minority in Congress and in an atmosphere charged with
tension and mistrust. Small incidents of violence between liber
als and conservatives began to break out in the countryside. But
the detonator for the explosive situation was the tragic assas
sination of Jorge Gaitan on April 9, 1948—an assassination
which has yet to be fully investigated. A mob dismembered the
assassin's body seconds after the fatal shot, and then proceeded
to raze and pillage the capital—an incident which has been ap
propriately termed the ‘‘Bogotaze.’’ Several thousand died before
the day was over. As Martz says, “The thin veneer of civilization
was cracked open.” In the author’s eyes, the violent death of
Gaitan was for Colombia what the assassination of the Austrian
Archduke Franz Ferdinand was for Europe. In the ensuing
months and years the two parties have tried to cooperate in
bringing an end to the widespread violence which has since
1948 claimed more Colombian lives than all the U.S. World War
II casualties.
Following Ospina Perez in 1950 came the greatest leader and
parliamentarian the Conservative Party had known. An extreme
rightist, who has been compared with Hitler and Franco in ide
ology and action, Laureane Gomez promptly set out to consoli
date his party’s position, slowly moving towards an authori
tarian government and dictatorship. His tampering with Con
gress and the Constitution and abrogation of a variety of civil
liberties finally led to the intervention in 1953 by the traditionally
non-political army under the leadership of General Gustavo
Rojas Pinilla. Hailed as the liberator of the country and at first
reluctant to sot up a government, Rojas Pinilla soon changed
his public image as he attempted to emulate Peron.
Rojas Pinilla’s press censorship, packing of legislature, con
tinuation of the state of siege imposed by Ospina P£rez, and
other forms of repression of criticism paved the way towards
dictatorship and led to his final capitulation before the opposi
tion composed of the army, church, and students in 1957.
During the four-year military dictatorship, the leaders of
the two traditional parties, Gomez and Alberto Lleras Camargo,
met in Sitges, Spain (where Gomez was in exile) and drew up
the historic “Pact of Sitges” in which they agreed to alternate
the presidency between the two parties for the next sixteen
years, maintaining a parity in the legislature, governorships
(which are appointive positions), etc.
Lleras Camargo, one of the outstanding liberal statesmen
of his age, was elected to lead the country through the first four
years of National Front Government. He dedicated himself to
leading Colombia out of the monstrous debt left by Rojas Pinilla
to social and agrarian reform, and to the eradication of the omni
present rural violence. But Lleras frequently found his hands
tied by an equally divided Congress and anti-National Front
factions in both parties.
While Martz is not overly optimistic about the successful
completion of the National Front sixteen-year agreement, he
nevertheless believes that it has set a healthy precedent of inter
party cooperation (unusual in Latin America) in Colombia and
has given the country a breathing spell of relative order. It is
unfortunate that Martz did not write one year later, for he
would have been confronted with a rising disaffected, popular,
leftist movement (which he predicted). Although the reading be
comes thick in some places for the reader who ; is not too well
versed in economics, the bizarre Colombian politics and the
author’s helpful insight soon revitalizes the text. It is unfor
tunate that a contemporary analysis of this type is not available
for every country.
“Colombia” is an excellent reference book and useful back
ground reading for those interested in this specific country. It
is also a fascinating study of the rise and fall of a Latin Ameri
can dictator (Rojas Pinilla), who was once hailed as a savior
and finally deposed amid cries of “tyrant” and “traitor.”
In many way the book is sad reading when one considers
that this is what goes on in a country which has been described
as one of the strongest Latin American democracies. But a note
of optimism is interjected at the end where Martz hopes for and
predicts a new generation of leadership which will awaken and
usher into the Twentieth Century this nation which has been
aptly termed "The Sleeping Beauty of the Tropics.”
