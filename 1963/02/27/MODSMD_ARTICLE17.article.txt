Editors, The Daily:
As U.S. representative of the International Student Movement
for the United Nations, I would like to add strong support to
yesterday’s Daily editorial. For the HR to take action in the
international field without consultation with the leading inter
national student organizations is irresponsible. During the past
year, the HR has displayed immature zeal in these areas which
students of other lands take with dead seriousness, and I am
surprised that negotiations on the Helsinki Festival did not pro
duce better judgment. Such organizations as the World Assem
bly of Youth and COSEC are run by highly competent students
of international reputation who have had years of experience at
the international level. To ignore these organizations not only
weakens the strongest Western influence we have in the inter
national student field, but it also runs the danger of promoting
naively irresponsible action. The fact that these organizations,
who hold business conferences instead of festivals, do not make
great noises or arc not known among U.S. students is no reason
for the HR not to write them, associate with them, and work
through them.

Editors, The Daily:
May I bring to your attention that in Monday’s Daily writing
under the head of “President” in the last column of the front
page, there has been a factual mistake. I would very much ap
preciate it if you can publish the following statement:
“While appreciating the honor conferred on him, in asking
to be President of the Stanford United Nations General Assem
bly, Mr. Raman would like to correct that he is not a research
assistant to Prof. Carl B. Spaeth, as it is published, but he is a
graduate student in the International Legal Studies Program of
the Stanford Law School.”
