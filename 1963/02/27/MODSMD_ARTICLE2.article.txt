### KATHLEEN FARGO 
Catherine* Drinker Bowen, who as a biographer has spent
nmeh of her life in the eompany of scholars, stated in last night’s
1 nesday Evening Series that there is a distinction between a
writer and a scholar and that each knows in which category he
belongs. Scholars dread the day when research ends and the

writing begins, while writers and*
biographers look forward to the
task of compiling their research
and writing it down.
Each of her books took two to
six years to write, and during
that time she was stimulated and
challenged by scholars. A biog
rapher needs and benefits from
the company of scholars and the
care of the specialist.
MRS. BOWEN stated that she
was interested in the scholar for
himself and for what he is as
well as for what he has done.
She observed that most of the
great scholars were bachelors.
Scholars, she feels, are as en
viable as any men on earth. It is
often argued that no escapist or
man who lacks vigor can be hap
py, but scholars are involved in a
constant search for reality, and
their vitality is tremendous.
“The scholar,” according to
Emerson, “is the world’s eye and
the world’s heart,” and the Soci
ety of Antiquaries, a group of
Elizabethan scholars that includ
ed John Stowe, William Camb
den, and Sir Robert Cotton served
as England’s eye and heart by
helping to compile the history of
the new world power.
MRS. BOWEN used the sub
jects of her biographies -Oliver
Wendall Holmes, Francis Bacon,
Edward Cook, and John Adams
to illustrate other qualities of
scholars.
Scholars have a boldness that
is necessary for a life of original
thinking. Most of them lived long
lives and wore as fond of books
in the end as they were in the be
ginning. In all scholars there has
been a conflict between thought
and action. Perhaps because he
was so intellectually gifted, Ba
con oscillated continuously be
tween his active and contempla
tive talents. Finally, in many
scholars there is a playful qual
ity, a zest for living, a responsive
laugh, and perhaps even a sud
den exaggerated sense of humor.

scholars.
Scholars have a boldness that
is necessary for a life of original
thinking. Most of them lived long
lives and wore as fond of books
in the end as they were in the be
ginning. In all scholars there has
been a conflict between thought
and action. Perhaps because he
was so intellectually gifted, Ba
con oscillated continuously be
tween his active and contempla
tive talents. Finally, in many
scholars there is a playful qual
ity, a zest for living, a responsive
laugh, and perhaps even a sud
den exaggerated sense of humor.
Catherine* Drinker Bowen, who as a biographer has spent
nmeh of her life in the eompany of scholars, stated in last night’s
1 nesday Evening Series that there is a distinction between a
writer and a scholar and that each knows in which category he
belongs. Scholars dread the day when research ends and the

writing begins, while writers and*
biographers look forward to the
task of compiling their research
and writing it down.
Each of her books took two to
six years to write, and during
that time she was stimulated and
challenged by scholars. A biog
rapher needs and benefits from
the company of scholars and the
care of the specialist.
MRS. BOWEN stated that she
was interested in the scholar for
himself and for what he is as
well as for what he has done.
She observed that most of the
great scholars were bachelors.
Scholars, she feels, are as en
viable as any men on earth. It is
often argued that no escapist or
man who lacks vigor can be hap
py, but scholars are involved in a
constant search for reality, and
their vitality is tremendous.
“The scholar,” according to
Emerson, “is the world’s eye and
the world’s heart,” and the Soci
ety of Antiquaries, a group of
Elizabethan scholars that includ
ed John Stowe, William Camb
den, and Sir Robert Cotton served
as England’s eye and heart by
helping to compile the history of
the new world power.
MRS. BOWEN used the sub
jects of her biographies -Oliver
Wendall Holmes, Francis Bacon,
Edward Cook, and John Adams
to illustrate other qualities of
scholars.
