# Larson Leads Rinconada's Win
## 
### DOUGLAS SCHWAB 
Randy Larson’s one-handed set
shot with ten seconds left to play
gave Rinconada a 31-29 victory
over previously unbeaten Arrayo.
Arroyo completely dominated the
first half, leading 18-14 at the
break. But Rinconada came back
in the second half and more than
made up for some sloppy first
half ball control.
Arroyo played a fast break in
the first period, but lacked the
height on the offensive boards,
as rebounding was controlled by
6’B” Roger Connor and the 6’f>”
Larson, both of Rinconada.
“B” Basketball also finds Rin
conada faring well, as they lead
their league with a 3-0 record.
Leading the fraternity “B” teams
are Theta Chi at 3-0, DU, Sigma
Chi, and Theta Delt, all with per
fect 4-0 records, and Delta Tau
Delta, also with a 3-0 record.
Serra and Alpha Biz contend the
lead of their league, both having
3-0 records.
