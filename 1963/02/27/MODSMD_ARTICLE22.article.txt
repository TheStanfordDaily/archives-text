### 
Over the weekend, the gymnas
tics team lost to Long Beach
State, one of the better state col
lege squads in the western Unit
ed States, by a 70-41 score. This
was the fifth consecutive set-back
for coach Wesley Ruff’s six-man
aggregation, who hardly ever
face a team of less than twelve
members.
Alan Miyamoto took first place
on side horse with an 8.25 total,
and Russ Burmester managed the
other Stanford premium with a
score of 8.55 in high bar compe
tition. Burmester added a second
in still rings which put him one
point ahead of Miyamoto, who
also took third in parallel bars,
for Stanford scoring honors.
Marc Weissbluth, tumbling:
and Bill Rusher, long horse, were
the only other Indians to score as
high as second in any single
event.
Tonight at 7:50 in Enema Gym,
San Francisco State will match
strength with the Indians for the
second time this season. SFS won
the first competition by a 61 f£-
48'£ score, although Stanford
took four of the seven first places
in the meet—and they did it
without Roger Rhoads, who has
rejoined the team after a period
of illness.
