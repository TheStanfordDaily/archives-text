# THE 						INSIDE PITCH
## Cards Face Uphill Battle to Title 
### Pete King 
Picked to win tho AAWU title at the season’s start, Stanford’s
basketball team has found it difficult to live up to its advance
notices, and will find the road to the championship even rockier in
the next two weeks.
Til K INDIANS are currently 6-3. not a had record, but they
have made the mistake of losing two close games at home and now
must play three games in hostile Los Angeles, scene of the December
debacle wherein they lost to lowly Northwestern and USC, and
where they have won only four of 21 conference games in the past
eight years.
Meanwhile, Stanford’s rival for West Coast cage honors, UCLA,
will enjoy its final four games at home, three of them in the cozy
confines of Santa Monica gymnasium. With a game against each of
the other teams, the Bruins should win all four; only Stanford and
USC appear to have a chance at upsetting coach Johnny Wooden’s
well-drilled crew. If the Cards fail to beat the Uclans for the third
time, they must sweep both contests with USC or kiss goodbye their
chances for Stanford’s first title in 21 years.
ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES
THE POSSIBLE combinations of wins and losses in the next two
weeks are myriad enough to keep a math major busy for hours.
Stanford could win the championship with a 9-3 or 8-4 record, could
lose it to UCLA, tie with UCLA, or conceivably could tie with both
UCLA and Washington at 7-5.
A tie would make Stanford co-champion, but there is a much
bigger prize at stake, i.e. a berth in tin* NCAA tournament.
In case of a tie with UCLA, a playoff game to determine the
AAWU tournament team would be held in Los Angeles, since the
Bruins played two of their three conference games here in the
Pavilion. A three-way tie would not be played off, since the winner
would be exhausted for the regionals, held in Provo, Utah. Instead,
the athletic directors of the five schools would vote to send one of
the teams to Provo. Stanford would probably get the nod, since the
Indians have beaten both the Bruins and Huskies two out of three
games.
SINCE UCLA, which has lost a mere four times at home in the
past three years, probably would win a playoff game, the Indians
must win their remaining three games (their record on the road
makes this unlikely) or hope that by some miracle the Bruins are
knocked off by Cal nr USC. A UCLA loss to Cal last Saturday would
have been such a miracle, but the Berkeley boys unkindly blew a
12-point leaf!, and Walt Hazzard blew the Bears off the floor for a
64-57 win.
TROIANS IN SPOILERS ROLE
Whatever happens, the Indians had better hope that justice
doesn’t enter into the outcome. Last year USC, with John Rudomet
kin, Chris Appel & Company, was the conference favorite and had a
shot at the title until Stanford beat them three times.
This year, the Trojans are in the spoiler's role. They killed off
what naive ho|>es Washington rooters may have bad for a Husky
title by beating Washington in, of all places, Seattle, where Stanford,
UCLA, ami Cal have met surprising defeat.
Coach Forrest Twogood’s outfit has already topped the Tribe
twice, once in the Pavilion. The Cards played below their ability
both nights, and are clearly the better team. But USC has won four
of its last five games, including a 67-58 shocker over powerful Ore
gon State in Corvallis, and are always tough to beat on their home
court. Hopefully, UCLA will take some of the starch out of the Tro
jans this Friday before the Indians play them Saturday. But even
Stanford’s Saturday night luck probably won’t be enough to contain
Gordon Martin and his USC teammates.
OF COURSE, there is always the ludicrous possibility that the
Indians will blow three games. Cal will get hot, and the conference
end up in a five-way 6-6 tie. In which event the athletic directors
would throw’ up their hands in dismay and turn their attention to
track, a more sensible sport where the favorites nearly always win.
Let’s see; if Washington beats UCLA, and USC beats Cal, that
means. . . .
