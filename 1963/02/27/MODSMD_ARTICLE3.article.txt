# LASSU Approves Anarchist Caucus
## 
### 
The Anarchist Caucus, the
seventh caucus of Political Un
ion, has been formed. The formal
organization of this caucus was
approved by the By-Laws Com
mittee of LASSU last night, and
the group will meet for the first
time next Wednesday.
In terms of structure, the An
archist Caucus has several unique
features. First, the presidency is
to be hold for a period of one
week in a manner determined by
alphabetical rotation. Thus all
active members will eventually
be president. Secondly, those
members present at any given
meeting constitute a quorum. The
continuance of the Anarchist Cau
cus is therefore almost a certain

Philosophically, the Anarchist
Caucus will be dedicated to free
ing the human mind from the
bondage of dogma and the sup
pression of criticism by authori
tarian legislative groups, accord
ing to Karl Phaler, the First Ro
tating President.
The interim officers of the cau
cus, First Rotating President
Phaler, non-Business Manager R.
Kimberley Maxwell, and Secre
tary Cosot te Dudley, have ex
pressed the hope that the group
will provide an organ for the ex
pression of valid criticisms. Lack
of such a group in the past, they
feel has falsely characterized
Stanford students as apathetic.
