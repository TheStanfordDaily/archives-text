# Stanford to Defend Indian Action in Goa at M.U.N.
## 
### LINDA HESS Contributing Editor 
To demonstrate that what Portugal de
scribes as “India’s aggressive seizure of Goa"
was actually the “Indian liberation of Goa”
will be one of the tasks of the eleven Stan
ford students selected as delegates to the
thirteenth annual Model United Nalions of
the Pacific West, in which Stanford is to
represent the Republic of India.
Scheduled to assemble at San Jose for four
days in April, this year’s M.U.N. is an ex
panded version of a conference which origi
nally mot at Stanford in 1951. when 350 stu
dents. presided over by Ralph Bunchc, con
ferred on international problems focused in
Korea and Yugoslavia. Since that confer
ence took place the M.U.N. has grown steadi
ly in scope and participation. This year U.N.
representation will bo complete, with dele
gations coming from 108 colleges and uni
versities in thirteen states from Hawaii to
Wyoming and California to Alaska.
The issues before this year’s M.U.N. re
flect its operational aim: as close as possible
an approximation of the actual workings of
the U.N. Its principles and governing rules
are patterned on those of the U.N. Charter,
and its structure includes General Assembly!
Security Council. International Court of
Justice, and six major committees.
TIIK DRAFTING of international cove
nants on human rights and U.N. resolutions
to curtail racial, national, and religious in
tolerance will be the special consideration of

Maynard Toll, senior history major and
member of M.U.N.’s Social, Humanitarian,
and Cultural Committee. Toll heads the
United Nations Desk of the HR and is gen
eral chairman of the first annual Stanford
United Nations, being held this week.
Admission of Red China and action re
garding the member nations who have re
fused to contribute their share to the U.N.
operation in the Congo will be the concern
of Stuart Novick and Antonio Armellini,
Stanford-Indian representatives on the Po
litical and Security Committee. Novick, a
freshman history major, is also serving as
chairman of the Indian delegation for S.U.N.
Armellini, a Roman law student taking up
international law at Stanford, will double as
defender of India’s position In the World
Court, where she has been indicted by Por
tugal for her 1961 seizure of Goa.
Other international trouble spots which
will be the subjects of M.U.N. resolutions
and debates are Cuba, Berlin, Angola, and
South Africa. General topics of concern to
all nations will include control of nuclear
weapons, economic and social consequences
of disarmament, and distribution of food
surpluses to underdeveloped nations. These
and other questions will be studied for in
committee discussion by delegates Steve
Dobbs, Peter Flcrstein, Ted Fogliani. Linda
Hess, Paul Holdorf, Martin Lebovvitz, and
Wayne Stinson.
“AS DELEGATES OF India,” says M.U.N.
committee chairman Bob Ronka, “we will
be thinking and acting like true Indians, in

the interests of India as, ideally, all of the
delegations will represent the interests of
their countries.”
Ronka added that the Stanford M.U.N. is
very fortunate to have access to the many
Indian students presently on the campus,
and serving as a valuable source of counsel
for the delegation. Working as advisor to
the group is Singh Walia, an Indian student
who is a special program Ph.D. candidate in
statistics.
The M.U.N. delegation has been holding
seminars. Scheduled to speak at future sem
inars are Professor James Liu, on Indian
history and culture; Professor Robert North
on Sino-Indian relations; and Professor
Claude Buss on Indian politics and foreign
relations.
ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS of the series
will bo a dialogue between Professor Carl
Spaeth, Dean of the Stanford Law School,
and K. V. Raman, an Indian attorney, profes
sor of law, and currently student of inter
national law at Stanford, on the subject of
India’s position in the neutralist world today.
The Model United Nations, originally
sponsored by the Collegiate Council for the
United Nations, has, since 1953, been main
tained by the participating schools them
selves. It is hosted by a different campus
each year, and preceded by a regional “dry
run” conference where delegates acquire
procedural know-how and working familiar
ity with the issues. This year's regional con
ference will be held on March 2 at Sacra
mento.

TIIK DRAFTING of international cove

to curtail racial, national, and religious in

Maynard Toll, senior history major and
member of M.U.N.’s Social, Humanitarian,

United Nations Desk of the HR and is gen
eral chairman of the first annual Stanford
United Nations, being held this week.
Admission of Red China and action re
garding the member nations who have re
fused to contribute their share to the U.N.
operation in the Congo will be the concern
of Stuart Novick and Antonio Armellini,
Stanford-Indian representatives on the Po
litical and Security Committee. Novick, a
freshman history major, is also serving as
chairman of the Indian delegation for S.U.N.
Armellini, a Roman law student taking up
international law at Stanford, will double as
defender of India’s position In the World
Court, where she has been indicted by Por
tugal for her 1961 seizure of Goa.
Other international trouble spots which
will be the subjects of M.U.N. resolutions
and debates are Cuba, Berlin, Angola, and
South Africa. General topics of concern to
all nations will include control of nuclear
weapons, economic and social consequences
of disarmament, and distribution of food
surpluses to underdeveloped nations. These
and other questions will be studied for in
committee discussion by delegates Steve
Dobbs, Peter Flcrstein, Ted Fogliani. Linda
Hess, Paul Holdorf, Martin Lebovvitz, and
Wayne Stinson.
“AS DELEGATES OF India,” says M.U.N.
committee chairman Bob Ronka, “we will
be thinking and acting like true Indians, in

the interests of India as, ideally, all of the
delegations will represent the interests of
their countries.”
Ronka added that the Stanford M.U.N. is
very fortunate to have access to the many
Indian students presently on the campus,
and serving as a valuable source of counsel
for the delegation. Working as advisor to
the group is Singh Walia, an Indian student
who is a special program Ph.D. candidate in
statistics.
The M.U.N. delegation has been holding
seminars. Scheduled to speak at future sem
inars are Professor James Liu, on Indian
history and culture; Professor Robert North
on Sino-Indian relations; and Professor
Claude Buss on Indian politics and foreign
relations.
ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS of the series
will bo a dialogue between Professor Carl
Spaeth, Dean of the Stanford Law School,
and K. V. Raman, an Indian attorney, profes
sor of law, and currently student of inter
national law at Stanford, on the subject of
India’s position in the neutralist world today.
The Model United Nations, originally
sponsored by the Collegiate Council for the
United Nations, has, since 1953, been main
tained by the participating schools them
selves. It is hosted by a different campus
each year, and preceded by a regional “dry
run” conference where delegates acquire
procedural know-how and working familiar
ity with the issues. This year's regional con
ference will be held on March 2 at Sacra
mento.
To demonstrate that what Portugal de
scribes as “India’s aggressive seizure of Goa"
was actually the “Indian liberation of Goa”
will be one of the tasks of the eleven Stan

represent the Republic of India.
Scheduled to assemble at San Jose for four
days in April, this year’s M.U.N. is an ex
