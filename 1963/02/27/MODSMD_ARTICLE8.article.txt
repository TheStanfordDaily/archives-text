# U.of Oregon Senate Requests 'Emerald' Editor's Resignation
## 
### 
The Senate of Associated Stu
dents of the University of Ore
gon has asked Ron Duel, editor
of the “Oregon Emerald,” to re
sign in a 13-12 vote. The request
resulted from charges of irre
sponsibility in “Emerald” news
coverage and editorial policy this
year.
Bill Vertress, who introduced
the motion against Buel, cited
four examples of alleged irre
sponsibility in (he “Emerald.” He
then added. “And the worst of
fense of the year is the recent
hazing business.” Vertress ap
parently felt that hazing in the
fraternity structure at the Uni
versity of Oregon should not
have been mentioned in the “Em
erald” as it would “irreparably”
damage the University of Oreogn.
Buel, while admitting the exist
ence of errors in Emerald report
ing, implied that the Senate was
attempting to exercise unauthor
ized censorship over the “Emer
ald.” He stated that he had no in
tention of resigning.
The motion to ask for Buel’s
resignation came only after one
vote had ended in a tie. Senate
Vice-President Art Erickson cast
the deciding vote.
