EVERY CHURCH
has a special distinction. Church (Gr.
EKKLASIA—' Called out’ ) may refer to
any assembly: social, political, or reli
gious (Acts 19:32, 39, 41).
The church of Christ refers to
believers called out of sin and
"Baptized (immersed) into
Christ Jesus." Mark 16:16;
John 3:5; Romans 6:3-5.
To obey 99 per cent Bible and
1 per cent opinion is to be called
into a group distinguished by
the 1 per cent opinion. The large
per cent of truth that is taught
may easily hide the 1 per cent
change and account for the re
ligious division.
Faith, love, and character are
required by Christ and are beau
tifully taught by many groups;
however, to become a child of
God, Jesus adds that baptism
(immersion) is essential. John
3:5; Col. 2:12; Acts 2:38.

To be a child of God one must obey
Christ rather than men.
