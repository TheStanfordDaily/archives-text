Over the weekend, seven students were
elected to represent our position before the
Prime Minister, and they arrived promptly at
9. After they had waited at the office for five
full hours without a response, a man who said
ho was the secretary to the Prime Minister
told them that he was prepared to see them
only later in the day. The seven students then
returned to the hostel to report to us what
had happened, and the executive committee of
the AASU met to plan just how our case
should be presented to the Prime Minister.
Later Monday afternoon the Sofia police
commissioner arrived at the hostel and in
formed us that he had been instructed to say
that demonstrations of the type we had car
ried out on Saturday (we had walked infor
mally together for several kilometers, with
out carrying any signs or chanting any slo
gans) were illegal in Bulgaria. He said that
persons involved in such demonstrations who
had not been warned by the police were liable
to three years imprisonment, that persons
who had been warned were liable' to fifteen
years imprisonment, and that we should con
sider ourselves to have been officially warned.
VVE TOM) HIM that our intention had not
been to demonstrate hut only to obtain an
interview with the Prime Minister, and the
police commissioner promised that through

the Minister of the Interior he would arrange
such a meeting for us. The AASU executive
committee thereupon decided to go the next
day to the Ministry of the Interior to estab
lish a definite time for an interview with the
Prime Minister.
At 3 a.m. Tuesday morning a large number
of policemen—at least 100—quietly surround
ed the hostel where we were all sleeping. For
tunately, Bulgarian student friends had warn
ed us that the police might attempt to arrest
our leaders. Five of the members of the execu
tive committee had therefore gone to differ
ent rooms to sleep, and Tawiah was hiding in
my room for safety. Mr. Mathews of Togo, a
member of the AASU executive committee,
however, had not switched from his regular
room, which was adjacent to mine.
I was awakened by the noise of him pound
ing on my wall and shouting for help as the
police were breaking down his locked door.
1 ran to my door, but as I opened it the police
men outside forced me at pistol point to go
back into my room. I then ran to the window
only to see police spread throughout the
courtyard, and I realized that if I made any
effort to help Matthews or to warn the others
I would only be jeopardizing the security of
Tawiah.
The police told Matthews not to speak to
anyone and to pack his belongings, but as
they carried him away he shouted, “I have
been arrested and I am going, but stand firm
for the African Union!” His shouting awoke
the rest of the Africans in the hostel, and so
many of them came out of their rooms that
the police had to content themselves with ar-

resting Matthews and Daniel Orfah of Ni
geria, the other executive committee member
who had made the mistake of staying in his
own room.
THE NEXT MORNING we virtually all de
cided that as fighters for African unity we
were not interested in staying in a country
where the authorities wore working so active
ly against this cause. We therefore agreed
that by 8 o’clock we would each pack a bag
as a symbol of our determinatoin to leave Bul
garia and would march to the Ministry of
Education. There we would demand that if
our two brothers were not unconditionally and
immediately released we must be given exit
visas and air tickets to permit us to leave
Bulgaria for good.
By 7:45 p.m. fully 200 of us, students from
21 different African countries, began our
march down Lenin street through the heavy
snowfall. We had covered most of the three
and-a-half kilometers when some 600 jeeps
full of six to seven hundred armed policemen
circled us. The police were soon joined by
civilians who came down from the halted
buses. Together they began attacking us in
discriminately; one Togolese girl was hit so
hard on the face that she bled profusely from
her nose and mouth, and many others of the
students were injured, some of them seri
ously.
The police began arresting us by the
dozens, and as civilian informers pointed out
the remaining members of the executive com
mittee the Ethopian Vice-President, the
Guinean Secretary-General, another Togolese
and a Somali—they were one by one arrested

and hauled into waiting police vans. As a Bul
garian civilian directed the police to Tawiah,
however, dozens of African students clustered
around him for his protection. The police
broke their way through a solid human wall
to take Tawiah, the last of their 40 to 50
prisoners.
Later in the day all were released save the
five members of the executive committee of
the AASU who had eluded arrest in the raid
on the hostel the previous night. The students
then formed a temporary executive commit
tee of the AASU to see to the unconditional
release of the seven arrested students and to
obtain exit visas and tickets for all of the
African students in Bulgaria (except for the
Sudanese, who are political refugees from
their country and were alone in wanting to
stay.t
THE GOVERNMENT agreed to issue all
African students exit visas good only for
three days, but they refused to provide the
tickets which were necessary if the students
were to leave and to which they were entitled
under the terms of their scholarships. On
February 14, a group of African students went
to the Ministry of Education again to demand
tickets for their flights. The government re
sponded by sending a delegation of Bulgarian
professors and students, who asked us to re
main in the country and assured us that con
ditions would be modified later on.
We had had more than enough of such
assurances, however, and we resolved to stay
in our hostel and not to attend lectures until
we were provided with tickets. The authorities
finally replied to our demand by saying that

if wo wished to leave we could go out on our
own. Since none of us was able on his own to
purchase a ticket, this became a matter of
robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Ethiopians left
first, followed by us Ghanaians, accompanied
by our country’s ambassador to Bulgaria. Mr.
Appah Sampong. We in turn were followed
by the students in Bulgaria from Nigeria,
Mali and Guinea. Other than the Sudanese,
any African students who have stayed in
Bulgaria have done so only because they have
no means to pay their transportation out of
the country.
WE NOW FACE the problem of finding
new places and new means of support in order
that we may further our higher education.
We would like to study in any country where
educational standards are high, although most
of us are not anxious to return to a Socialist
country for fear that our experiences might
bo similar and that our freedom might again
be limited.
We are also concerned about the fate of
our seven leaders, of whom we have had no
clear word since we left Bulgaria. All student
organizations and others concerned with the
defense of student rights must demand that
the Bulgarian authorities permit these stu
dents to leave the country promptly and un
punished, as their only “crime” has been that
of working for the unity of Africa. Our ex
perience has convinced us all the more of the
potential power of African unity, as demon
strated—if by nothing else by the determined
character of the efforts made against it by
those who would deny or subvert its lofty
aspirations.

ent rooms to sleep, and Tawiah was hiding in
my room for safety. Mr. Mathews of Togo, a
member of the AASU executive committee,
however, had not switched from his regular
room, which was adjacent to mine.
I was awakened by the noise of him pound
ing on my wall and shouting for help as the
police were breaking down his locked door.
1 ran to my door, but as I opened it the police
men outside forced me at pistol point to go
back into my room. I then ran to the window
only to see police spread throughout the
courtyard, and I realized that if I made any
effort to help Matthews or to warn the others
I would only be jeopardizing the security of
Tawiah.
The police told Matthews not to speak to
anyone and to pack his belongings, but as
they carried him away he shouted, “I have
been arrested and I am going, but stand firm
for the African Union!” His shouting awoke
the rest of the Africans in the hostel, and so
many of them came out of their rooms that
the police had to content themselves with ar-

resting Matthews and Daniel Orfah of Ni
geria, the other executive committee member
who had made the mistake of staying in his
own room.
THE NEXT MORNING we virtually all de
cided that as fighters for African unity we
were not interested in staying in a country
where the authorities wore working so active
ly against this cause. We therefore agreed
that by 8 o’clock we would each pack a bag
as a symbol of our determinatoin to leave Bul
garia and would march to the Ministry of
Education. There we would demand that if
our two brothers were not unconditionally and
immediately released we must be given exit
visas and air tickets to permit us to leave
Bulgaria for good.
By 7:45 p.m. fully 200 of us, students from
21 different African countries, began our
march down Lenin street through the heavy
snowfall. We had covered most of the three
and-a-half kilometers when some 600 jeeps
full of six to seven hundred armed policemen
circled us. The police were soon joined by
civilians who came down from the halted
buses. Together they began attacking us in
discriminately; one Togolese girl was hit so
hard on the face that she bled profusely from
her nose and mouth, and many others of the
students were injured, some of them seri
ously.
The police began arresting us by the
dozens, and as civilian informers pointed out
the remaining members of the executive com
mittee the Ethopian Vice-President, the
Guinean Secretary-General, another Togolese
and a Somali—they were one by one arrested

and hauled into waiting police vans. As a Bul
garian civilian directed the police to Tawiah,
however, dozens of African students clustered
around him for his protection. The police
broke their way through a solid human wall
to take Tawiah, the last of their 40 to 50
prisoners.
Later in the day all were released save the
five members of the executive committee of
the AASU who had eluded arrest in the raid
on the hostel the previous night. The students
then formed a temporary executive commit
tee of the AASU to see to the unconditional
release of the seven arrested students and to
obtain exit visas and tickets for all of the
African students in Bulgaria (except for the
Sudanese, who are political refugees from
their country and were alone in wanting to
stay.t
THE GOVERNMENT agreed to issue all
African students exit visas good only for
three days, but they refused to provide the
tickets which were necessary if the students
were to leave and to which they were entitled
under the terms of their scholarships. On
February 14, a group of African students went
to the Ministry of Education again to demand
tickets for their flights. The government re
sponded by sending a delegation of Bulgarian
professors and students, who asked us to re
main in the country and assured us that con
ditions would be modified later on.
We had had more than enough of such
assurances, however, and we resolved to stay
in our hostel and not to attend lectures until
we were provided with tickets. The authorities
finally replied to our demand by saying that

if wo wished to leave we could go out on our
own. Since none of us was able on his own to
purchase a ticket, this became a matter of
robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Ethiopians left
first, followed by us Ghanaians, accompanied
by our country’s ambassador to Bulgaria. Mr.
Appah Sampong. We in turn were followed
by the students in Bulgaria from Nigeria,
Mali and Guinea. Other than the Sudanese,
any African students who have stayed in
Bulgaria have done so only because they have
no means to pay their transportation out of
the country.
WE NOW FACE the problem of finding
new places and new means of support in order
that we may further our higher education.
We would like to study in any country where
educational standards are high, although most
of us are not anxious to return to a Socialist
country for fear that our experiences might
bo similar and that our freedom might again
be limited.
We are also concerned about the fate of
our seven leaders, of whom we have had no
clear word since we left Bulgaria. All student
organizations and others concerned with the
defense of student rights must demand that
the Bulgarian authorities permit these stu
dents to leave the country promptly and un
punished, as their only “crime” has been that
of working for the unity of Africa. Our ex
perience has convinced us all the more of the
potential power of African unity, as demon
strated—if by nothing else by the determined
character of the efforts made against it by
those who would deny or subvert its lofty
aspirations.

Over the weekend, seven students were
elected to represent our position before the
Prime Minister, and they arrived promptly at
9. After they had waited at the office for five
full hours without a response, a man who said
ho was the secretary to the Prime Minister
told them that he was prepared to see them
only later in the day. The seven students then
returned to the hostel to report to us what
had happened, and the executive committee of
the AASU met to plan just how our case
should be presented to the Prime Minister.
Later Monday afternoon the Sofia police
commissioner arrived at the hostel and in
formed us that he had been instructed to say
that demonstrations of the type we had car
ried out on Saturday (we had walked infor
mally together for several kilometers, with
out carrying any signs or chanting any slo
gans) were illegal in Bulgaria. He said that
persons involved in such demonstrations who
had not been warned by the police were liable
to three years imprisonment, that persons
who had been warned were liable' to fifteen
years imprisonment, and that we should con
sider ourselves to have been officially warned.
VVE TOM) HIM that our intention had not
been to demonstrate hut only to obtain an
interview with the Prime Minister, and the
police commissioner promised that through

the Minister of the Interior he would arrange
such a meeting for us. The AASU executive
committee thereupon decided to go the next

and-a-half kilometers when some 600 jeeps
full of six to seven hundred armed policemen
circled us. The police were soon joined by
civilians who came down from the halted
buses. Together they began attacking us in
discriminately; one Togolese girl was hit so
hard on the face that she bled profusely from
her nose and mouth, and many others of the
students were injured, some of them seri
ously.
The police began arresting us by the
dozens, and as civilian informers pointed out
the remaining members of the executive com
mittee the Ethopian Vice-President, the
Guinean Secretary-General, another Togolese
and a Somali—they were one by one arrested

and hauled into waiting police vans. As a Bul
garian civilian directed the police to Tawiah,
however, dozens of African students clustered
around him for his protection. The police
broke their way through a solid human wall
to take Tawiah, the last of their 40 to 50
prisoners.
Later in the day all were released save the
five members of the executive committee of
the AASU who had eluded arrest in the raid
on the hostel the previous night. The students
then formed a temporary executive commit
tee of the AASU to see to the unconditional
release of the seven arrested students and to
obtain exit visas and tickets for all of the
African students in Bulgaria (except for the
Sudanese, who are political refugees from
their country and were alone in wanting to
stay.t
THE GOVERNMENT agreed to issue all
African students exit visas good only for
three days, but they refused to provide the
tickets which were necessary if the students
were to leave and to which they were entitled
under the terms of their scholarships. On
February 14, a group of African students went
to the Ministry of Education again to demand
tickets for their flights. The government re
sponded by sending a delegation of Bulgarian
professors and students, who asked us to re
main in the country and assured us that con
ditions would be modified later on.
We had had more than enough of such
assurances, however, and we resolved to stay
in our hostel and not to attend lectures until
we were provided with tickets. The authorities
finally replied to our demand by saying that

if wo wished to leave we could go out on our
own. Since none of us was able on his own to
purchase a ticket, this became a matter of
robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Ethiopians left
first, followed by us Ghanaians, accompanied
by our country’s ambassador to Bulgaria. Mr.
Appah Sampong. We in turn were followed
by the students in Bulgaria from Nigeria,
Mali and Guinea. Other than the Sudanese,
any African students who have stayed in
Bulgaria have done so only because they have
no means to pay their transportation out of
the country.
WE NOW FACE the problem of finding
new places and new means of support in order
that we may further our higher education.
We would like to study in any country where
educational standards are high, although most
of us are not anxious to return to a Socialist
country for fear that our experiences might
bo similar and that our freedom might again
be limited.
We are also concerned about the fate of
our seven leaders, of whom we have had no
clear word since we left Bulgaria. All student
organizations and others concerned with the
defense of student rights must demand that
the Bulgarian authorities permit these stu
dents to leave the country promptly and un
punished, as their only “crime” has been that
of working for the unity of Africa. Our ex
perience has convinced us all the more of the
potential power of African unity, as demon
strated—if by nothing else by the determined
character of the efforts made against it by
those who would deny or subvert its lofty
aspirations.

Over the weekend, seven students were
elected to represent our position before the
Prime Minister, and they arrived promptly at
9. After they had waited at the office for five
full hours without a response, a man who said
ho was the secretary to the Prime Minister
told them that he was prepared to see them
only later in the day. The seven students then
returned to the hostel to report to us what
had happened, and the executive committee of
the AASU met to plan just how our case
should be presented to the Prime Minister.
Later Monday afternoon the Sofia police
commissioner arrived at the hostel and in
formed us that he had been instructed to say
that demonstrations of the type we had car
ried out on Saturday (we had walked infor
mally together for several kilometers, with
out carrying any signs or chanting any slo
gans) were illegal in Bulgaria. He said that
persons involved in such demonstrations who
had not been warned by the police were liable
to three years imprisonment, that persons
who had been warned were liable' to fifteen
years imprisonment, and that we should con
sider ourselves to have been officially warned.
VVE TOM) HIM that our intention had not
been to demonstrate hut only to obtain an
interview with the Prime Minister, and the
police commissioner promised that through

the Minister of the Interior he would arrange
such a meeting for us. The AASU executive
committee thereupon decided to go the next
day to the Ministry of the Interior to estab
lish a definite time for an interview with the
Prime Minister.
At 3 a.m. Tuesday morning a large number
of policemen—at least 100—quietly surround
ed the hostel where we were all sleeping. For
tunately, Bulgarian student friends had warn
ed us that the police might attempt to arrest
our leaders. Five of the members of the execu
tive committee had therefore gone to differ
ent rooms to sleep, and Tawiah was hiding in
my room for safety. Mr. Mathews of Togo, a
member of the AASU executive committee,
however, had not switched from his regular
room, which was adjacent to mine.
I was awakened by the noise of him pound
ing on my wall and shouting for help as the
police were breaking down his locked door.
1 ran to my door, but as I opened it the police
men outside forced me at pistol point to go
back into my room. I then ran to the window
only to see police spread throughout the
courtyard, and I realized that if I made any
effort to help Matthews or to warn the others
I would only be jeopardizing the security of
Tawiah.
The police told Matthews not to speak to
anyone and to pack his belongings, but as
they carried him away he shouted, “I have
been arrested and I am going, but stand firm
for the African Union!” His shouting awoke
the rest of the Africans in the hostel, and so
many of them came out of their rooms that
the police had to content themselves with ar-

resting Matthews and Daniel Orfah of Ni
geria, the other executive committee member
who had made the mistake of staying in his
own room.
THE NEXT MORNING we virtually all de
cided that as fighters for African unity we
were not interested in staying in a country
where the authorities wore working so active
ly against this cause. We therefore agreed
that by 8 o’clock we would each pack a bag
as a symbol of our determinatoin to leave Bul
garia and would march to the Ministry of
Education. There we would demand that if
our two brothers were not unconditionally and
immediately released we must be given exit
visas and air tickets to permit us to leave
Bulgaria for good.
By 7:45 p.m. fully 200 of us, students from
21 different African countries, began our
march down Lenin street through the heavy
snowfall. We had covered most of the three
and-a-half kilometers when some 600 jeeps
full of six to seven hundred armed policemen
circled us. The police were soon joined by

We had had more than enough of such
assurances, however, and we resolved to stay
in our hostel and not to attend lectures until
we were provided with tickets. The authorities
finally replied to our demand by saying that

if wo wished to leave we could go out on our
own. Since none of us was able on his own to
purchase a ticket, this became a matter of
robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Ethiopians left
first, followed by us Ghanaians, accompanied
by our country’s ambassador to Bulgaria. Mr.
Appah Sampong. We in turn were followed
by the students in Bulgaria from Nigeria,
Mali and Guinea. Other than the Sudanese,
any African students who have stayed in
Bulgaria have done so only because they have
no means to pay their transportation out of
the country.
WE NOW FACE the problem of finding
new places and new means of support in order
that we may further our higher education.
We would like to study in any country where
educational standards are high, although most
of us are not anxious to return to a Socialist
country for fear that our experiences might
bo similar and that our freedom might again
be limited.
We are also concerned about the fate of
our seven leaders, of whom we have had no
clear word since we left Bulgaria. All student
organizations and others concerned with the
defense of student rights must demand that
the Bulgarian authorities permit these stu
dents to leave the country promptly and un
punished, as their only “crime” has been that
of working for the unity of Africa. Our ex
perience has convinced us all the more of the
potential power of African unity, as demon
strated—if by nothing else by the determined
character of the efforts made against it by
those who would deny or subvert its lofty
aspirations.

Over the weekend, seven students were
elected to represent our position before the
Prime Minister, and they arrived promptly at
9. After they had waited at the office for five
full hours without a response, a man who said
ho was the secretary to the Prime Minister
told them that he was prepared to see them
only later in the day. The seven students then
returned to the hostel to report to us what
had happened, and the executive committee of
the AASU met to plan just how our case
should be presented to the Prime Minister.
Later Monday afternoon the Sofia police
commissioner arrived at the hostel and in
formed us that he had been instructed to say
that demonstrations of the type we had car
ried out on Saturday (we had walked infor
mally together for several kilometers, with
out carrying any signs or chanting any slo
gans) were illegal in Bulgaria. He said that
persons involved in such demonstrations who
had not been warned by the police were liable
to three years imprisonment, that persons
who had been warned were liable' to fifteen
years imprisonment, and that we should con
sider ourselves to have been officially warned.
VVE TOM) HIM that our intention had not
been to demonstrate hut only to obtain an
interview with the Prime Minister, and the
police commissioner promised that through

the Minister of the Interior he would arrange
such a meeting for us. The AASU executive
committee thereupon decided to go the next
day to the Ministry of the Interior to estab
lish a definite time for an interview with the
Prime Minister.
At 3 a.m. Tuesday morning a large number
of policemen—at least 100—quietly surround
ed the hostel where we were all sleeping. For
tunately, Bulgarian student friends had warn
ed us that the police might attempt to arrest
our leaders. Five of the members of the execu
tive committee had therefore gone to differ
ent rooms to sleep, and Tawiah was hiding in
my room for safety. Mr. Mathews of Togo, a
member of the AASU executive committee,
however, had not switched from his regular
room, which was adjacent to mine.
I was awakened by the noise of him pound
ing on my wall and shouting for help as the
police were breaking down his locked door.
1 ran to my door, but as I opened it the police
men outside forced me at pistol point to go
back into my room. I then ran to the window
only to see police spread throughout the
courtyard, and I realized that if I made any
effort to help Matthews or to warn the others
I would only be jeopardizing the security of
Tawiah.
The police told Matthews not to speak to
anyone and to pack his belongings, but as
they carried him away he shouted, “I have
been arrested and I am going, but stand firm
for the African Union!” His shouting awoke
the rest of the Africans in the hostel, and so
many of them came out of their rooms that
the police had to content themselves with ar-

resting Matthews and Daniel Orfah of Ni
geria, the other executive committee member
who had made the mistake of staying in his
own room.
THE NEXT MORNING we virtually all de
cided that as fighters for African unity we
were not interested in staying in a country
where the authorities wore working so active
ly against this cause. We therefore agreed
that by 8 o’clock we would each pack a bag
as a symbol of our determinatoin to leave Bul
garia and would march to the Ministry of
Education. There we would demand that if
our two brothers were not unconditionally and
immediately released we must be given exit
visas and air tickets to permit us to leave
Bulgaria for good.
By 7:45 p.m. fully 200 of us, students from
21 different African countries, began our
march down Lenin street through the heavy
snowfall. We had covered most of the three
and-a-half kilometers when some 600 jeeps
full of six to seven hundred armed policemen
circled us. The police were soon joined by
civilians who came down from the halted
buses. Together they began attacking us in
discriminately; one Togolese girl was hit so
hard on the face that she bled profusely from
her nose and mouth, and many others of the
students were injured, some of them seri
ously.
The police began arresting us by the
dozens, and as civilian informers pointed out
the remaining members of the executive com
mittee the Ethopian Vice-President, the
Guinean Secretary-General, another Togolese
and a Somali—they were one by one arrested

and hauled into waiting police vans. As a Bul
garian civilian directed the police to Tawiah,
however, dozens of African students clustered
around him for his protection. The police
broke their way through a solid human wall
to take Tawiah, the last of their 40 to 50
prisoners.
Later in the day all were released save the
five members of the executive committee of
the AASU who had eluded arrest in the raid
on the hostel the previous night. The students
then formed a temporary executive commit
tee of the AASU to see to the unconditional
release of the seven arrested students and to
obtain exit visas and tickets for all of the
African students in Bulgaria (except for the
Sudanese, who are political refugees from
their country and were alone in wanting to
stay.t
THE GOVERNMENT agreed to issue all
African students exit visas good only for
three days, but they refused to provide the
tickets which were necessary if the students
were to leave and to which they were entitled
under the terms of their scholarships. On
February 14, a group of African students went
to the Ministry of Education again to demand
tickets for their flights. The government re
sponded by sending a delegation of Bulgarian
professors and students, who asked us to re
main in the country and assured us that con
ditions would be modified later on.
We had had more than enough of such
assurances, however, and we resolved to stay
in our hostel and not to attend lectures until
