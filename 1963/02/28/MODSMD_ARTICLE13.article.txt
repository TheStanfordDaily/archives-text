# S.U.N.: A Commendable Effort
## 
### 
The Stanford United Nations met yesterday for its first
official meeting. The S.U.N., though plagued with the usual
disorganization and confusion, has made a successful start.
It is a credit to the S.U.N. committee and the Institute of
International Relations that Mr, Frederick Roland, Irish Am
bassador to the United States, and Dr. Louis Sohn, Professor
of International Law at the Harvard Law School, were will
ing to come to Stanford for the S.U.N. and it is fortunate that
they were able to attend the sessions.
The work of the Stanford delegates has been very good.
The reports of the three committees—China, Berlin and World
Government—are excellent, well researched, and well-written.
The amount of knowledge and experience gained by each
delegate is dependent upon his own energy and ability, but
S.U.N. and UR have certainly provided the students at Stan
ford with an excellent opportunity to learn about some of the
world’s problems and how they are dealt with in the United
Nations.
The S.U.N. and HR should be highly commended for
this.
