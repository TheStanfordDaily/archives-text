# Responsibility and the Oregon Editor
## 
### 
The editor of the University of Oregon Daily Emerald,
Ron Buel, has been asked by the Oregon Associated Student
Senate to resign for what the Senate calls “irresponsibility.”
Mr. Buel, in an editorial, mentioned that hazing does exist
in University of Oregon fraternities. The Senate felt that haz
ing in the fraternity structure should not have been men
tioned in the student newspaper as it would “irreparably”
damage the reputation of the University of Oregon.
The function of all newspapers, including university news
papers, is to report the facts fully, accurately, and honestly.
If hazing did exist at the University of Oregon, Editor Buel
had a responsibility to the students of the University to let
the facts be known. Suppression of news because the facts are
damaging to an institution is both morally and legally wrong.
Mr. Buel has stated that he has no intention of resigning.
He is right. He did only what it was his responsibility as edi
tor of the Emerald to do, and there is no reason for him to
resign.
