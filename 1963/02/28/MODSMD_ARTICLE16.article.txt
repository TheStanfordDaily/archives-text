To achieve both an emotional and objective understanding
of art is the purpose of an unusual program of drawing origi
nated by Associate Professor of Art Matt Kahn for undergradu
ates attending Stanford-in-Italy.
Prof. Kahn gives two reasons for the program. “Drawing
from works of art is an excellent way to study them; one be
comes much more acutely aware of the subtleties of a work of
art through drawing than by more casual looking. Secondly, in
the study of art the student should feel some empathy with the
creative process and some sense of the emotional and intellec
tual expenditure that goes into a work of art. No amount of
traditional study can make a student understand how committed
an artist is to his work as well as getting similarly committed.”
Study in Florence has special value because students are
living in a great art center and have the unique opportunity to
explore beyond the restraint of (he textbook, to see, study and
appreciate the works of art aboid which they have read at
school, and to discover works not previously known to them,
even through books.
Because of their lack of previous training in art, drawing
was not required of the students first quarter, but was rather
urged and encouraged. However, Prof. Kahn was pleased to find
that practically all the students chose to draw and considered
the experience very rewarding.
“Of the people who are drawing, a large number would
seem to be getting involved in the study of art in a deep and
lasting way,” Prof. Kahn stated.
Fall quarter each student chose a period or personality in
art from Greek to Baroque and specialized on this subject. In
structed to “become experts in your field,” the students not only
did academic research in books, but did personal research, visit
ing works of art again and again, drawing them, learning to
know them visually, academically, and emotionally.
Prof. Kahn noted that many students explored “quite be
yond the limitations of their own project and in ways that will
leave them culturally oriented.
"I did not expect so many to do this. Of those who got in
volved, many became dedicated. So many students are much
more aware—and their own subjective experience is the key to
this.”
The winter quarter art course, entitled “The New Renais
sance in Italian Visual Arts,” also includes a study of modern
movements in art all over (he world. Again students are choos
ing a special subject on which (hey will write a report.
“The student drawing will perhaps take more personal
forms,” Prof. Kahn said, “since the art of our own time naturally
inspires us to find our own identity.” Thus, the drawing which
was at first historically oriented can build on this basis to be
come more personal.
Prof. Kahn’s goal for the winter quarter study Is that stu
dents will come away from the experience “thoroughly familiar
with Italian art, but, more important, capable of mature and
sensitive response to art anywhere.”
