# PEACE CORPS LETTER
## Peace Corps in Malaya 
### KIRK BUNNELL 
(Editors’ note: The following was received as a letter by
the Peace Corps Desk of the Institute of International Relations.
Mr. Bunnell is a Stanford graduate presently with the Peace
Corps in Malaya.)

I should like to fill you in on a few details on life in Malaya
and working as a corpse, a Peace Corpse, which is what the
people here refer to it as. There is very litle I can say of a very
sophisticated nature about the Asian way of life, since one dis
covers the more one learns, the less one knows. To grasp Ma
layan thoughts and cultural patterns is a greater task than I
can hope to achieve in six months, or even two years. I hope,
for those who are thinking about joining the Peace Corps, that
you will remember that every volunteer has a completely unique
experience. For example, the fellow living eight miles from me
lives an entirely different life.
My official job in Malaya is with the Ministry of Education,
who assigns me, and I have been assigned to a high school in
northern Malaya, in a town, size of about fifty thousand—
though the size is very deceiving since by looking at it one would
guess it is about five thousand. I teach mineral science which is
about the equivalent of high school biology, physics and chem
istry. We do not have any other jobs besides teaching except
that we are frequently called on to give talks.
Malaya is a multiracial society, with Malays, Chinese and
Indians, all with different restaurants, religions—Muslim, Bud
dhist, and Tamil, respectively and languages—Malay, Hokkien,
and Hindustani, respectively. Therefore, there is a great mixing
of traditions and one is never lacking for festivals since the
state recognizes all three religions and their holidays. Right
now we are in the middle of the Chinese New Year .which js
quite something. j ;•! [ .: i -'; I ” ' !; ' 1 *
I live alone in town, although most of the volunteers live in
groups of two or three. The main difficulty I run into is com
munication. That is, many of the people do speak English, but
it is often difficult to understand what is meant, and if they
don't speak English, my Malay is not good enough to carry on
a conversation except for “How are you?” etc. Even those who
speak good English realize that, our meanings for words are
frequently different, in fact, at times obscene, which can be
rather embarrassing.
It is generally recognized that the physical adjustment one
must make is almost inconsequential compared to the mental
change. It is not so much a vivid difference in attitudes, but is
slower and much more evasive, and one soon realizes that the
Malayans have an entirely different way of thinking. Cracking
this problem is the biggest job. Many of the volunteers who live
in the big cities do not feel this. In most of the countries the
Peace Corps visits, the West has made an impact. In Malaya,
Elvis Presley often haunts the radio—what a great heritage to
bring across the Pacific!
Most of the students wear Western clothes, as I do—white
shirts and ties. Coats are never worn here since it is very humid
and extremely hot. Many of the people wear their local dress,
and I frequently put on my sarong merely because it is the
coolest thing I own.
I am in an all boys’ school, and I have found the students
very polite. Every morning for every class they stand and say,
‘‘good morning, sir.” Some of them say it so hypocritically loud
I feel like an idiot. There is very little social life over here. There
are three married couples in town and they all enjoy Malaya and
have very nice homes. Married volunteers really do a better job
over here since they tend to get out in society more than the
single ones. I must confess that the women over here are very
beautiful but also very shy.
One encounters a myriad of small things one must adjust to
. , . each one of the volunteers lives a different life, some four
in a group with a servant and a cook and others as myself, alone,
doing all my own cooking and cleaning. There are advantages to
both, but the point is that no training can really prepare you for
a foreign country. I really hope that anyone who are interested
in the Peace Corps will consider it carefully. It is in many ways a
lonely existence, but well worth it to one who really wants to do
a job.
One must come with the idea that he can and will accept,
whatever comes, and be prepared for anything. For example, I
arrived in Bukit Mertajam on a Thursday night and began teach
ing a full load on Friday and tried to find a house on Saturday.
All the preparation in the world could not cover what you learn
in one week here. You have to have a sense of humor and be
able to laugh at yourself—especially since everyone else laughs
at you.
Although the communication is difficult, one can feel that
there is progress, although one can not look for it intelligently.
It is more a feeling one gets that this is your home and your
work. One can not help growing to love the people, especially the
students. When you know that something is right, the little
things make little difference.
So it is that I find myself at night lying awake under my
mosquito net glad for this chance to help.

speak good English realize that, our meanings for words are
frequently different, in fact, at times obscene, which can be
rather embarrassing.
It is generally recognized that the physical adjustment one
must make is almost inconsequential compared to the mental
change. It is not so much a vivid difference in attitudes, but is
slower and much more evasive, and one soon realizes that the
Malayans have an entirely different way of thinking. Cracking
this problem is the biggest job. Many of the volunteers who live
in the big cities do not feel this. In most of the countries the
Peace Corps visits, the West has made an impact. In Malaya,
Elvis Presley often haunts the radio—what a great heritage to
bring across the Pacific!
Most of the students wear Western clothes, as I do—white
shirts and ties. Coats are never worn here since it is very humid
and extremely hot. Many of the people wear their local dress,
and I frequently put on my sarong merely because it is the
coolest thing I own.
I am in an all boys’ school, and I have found the students
very polite. Every morning for every class they stand and say,
‘‘good morning, sir.” Some of them say it so hypocritically loud
I feel like an idiot. There is very little social life over here. There
are three married couples in town and they all enjoy Malaya and
have very nice homes. Married volunteers really do a better job
over here since they tend to get out in society more than the
single ones. I must confess that the women over here are very
beautiful but also very shy.
One encounters a myriad of small things one must adjust to
. , . each one of the volunteers lives a different life, some four
in a group with a servant and a cook and others as myself, alone,
doing all my own cooking and cleaning. There are advantages to
both, but the point is that no training can really prepare you for
a foreign country. I really hope that anyone who are interested
in the Peace Corps will consider it carefully. It is in many ways a
lonely existence, but well worth it to one who really wants to do
a job.
One must come with the idea that he can and will accept,
whatever comes, and be prepared for anything. For example, I
arrived in Bukit Mertajam on a Thursday night and began teach
ing a full load on Friday and tried to find a house on Saturday.
All the preparation in the world could not cover what you learn
in one week here. You have to have a sense of humor and be
able to laugh at yourself—especially since everyone else laughs
at you.
Although the communication is difficult, one can feel that
there is progress, although one can not look for it intelligently.
It is more a feeling one gets that this is your home and your
work. One can not help growing to love the people, especially the
students. When you know that something is right, the little
things make little difference.
So it is that I find myself at night lying awake under my
mosquito net glad for this chance to help.

I should like to fill you in on a few details on life in Malaya
and working as a corpse, a Peace Corpse, which is what the
people here refer to it as. There is very litle I can say of a very
sophisticated nature about the Asian way of life, since one dis
covers the more one learns, the less one knows. To grasp Ma
layan thoughts and cultural patterns is a greater task than I
can hope to achieve in six months, or even two years. I hope,
for those who are thinking about joining the Peace Corps, that
you will remember that every volunteer has a completely unique
experience. For example, the fellow living eight miles from me
lives an entirely different life.
My official job in Malaya is with the Ministry of Education,
who assigns me, and I have been assigned to a high school in
northern Malaya, in a town, size of about fifty thousand—
though the size is very deceiving since by looking at it one would
guess it is about five thousand. I teach mineral science which is
about the equivalent of high school biology, physics and chem
istry. We do not have any other jobs besides teaching except
that we are frequently called on to give talks.
Malaya is a multiracial society, with Malays, Chinese and
Indians, all with different restaurants, religions—Muslim, Bud
dhist, and Tamil, respectively and languages—Malay, Hokkien,
and Hindustani, respectively. Therefore, there is a great mixing
of traditions and one is never lacking for festivals since the
state recognizes all three religions and their holidays. Right
now we are in the middle of the Chinese New Year .which js
quite something. j ;•! [ .: i -'; I ” ' !; ' 1 *

ing a full load on Friday and tried to find a house on Saturday.
All the preparation in the world could not cover what you learn
in one week here. You have to have a sense of humor and be
able to laugh at yourself—especially since everyone else laughs
at you.
Although the communication is difficult, one can feel that
there is progress, although one can not look for it intelligently.
It is more a feeling one gets that this is your home and your
work. One can not help growing to love the people, especially the
students. When you know that something is right, the little
things make little difference.
So it is that I find myself at night lying awake under my
mosquito net glad for this chance to help.

Mr. Bunnell is a Stanford graduate presently with the Peace
Corps in Malaya.)

I should like to fill you in on a few details on life in Malaya
and working as a corpse, a Peace Corpse, which is what the
people here refer to it as. There is very litle I can say of a very
sophisticated nature about the Asian way of life, since one dis
covers the more one learns, the less one knows. To grasp Ma
layan thoughts and cultural patterns is a greater task than I
can hope to achieve in six months, or even two years. I hope,
for those who are thinking about joining the Peace Corps, that
you will remember that every volunteer has a completely unique
experience. For example, the fellow living eight miles from me
lives an entirely different life.
My official job in Malaya is with the Ministry of Education,
who assigns me, and I have been assigned to a high school in
northern Malaya, in a town, size of about fifty thousand—
though the size is very deceiving since by looking at it one would
guess it is about five thousand. I teach mineral science which is
about the equivalent of high school biology, physics and chem
istry. We do not have any other jobs besides teaching except
that we are frequently called on to give talks.
Malaya is a multiracial society, with Malays, Chinese and
Indians, all with different restaurants, religions—Muslim, Bud
dhist, and Tamil, respectively and languages—Malay, Hokkien,
and Hindustani, respectively. Therefore, there is a great mixing
of traditions and one is never lacking for festivals since the
state recognizes all three religions and their holidays. Right
now we are in the middle of the Chinese New Year .which js
quite something. j ;•! [ .: i -'; I ” ' !; ' 1 *
I live alone in town, although most of the volunteers live in
groups of two or three. The main difficulty I run into is com
munication. That is, many of the people do speak English, but
it is often difficult to understand what is meant, and if they
don't speak English, my Malay is not good enough to carry on
a conversation except for “How are you?” etc. Even those who
speak good English realize that, our meanings for words are
frequently different, in fact, at times obscene, which can be
rather embarrassing.
It is generally recognized that the physical adjustment one
must make is almost inconsequential compared to the mental
change. It is not so much a vivid difference in attitudes, but is
slower and much more evasive, and one soon realizes that the
Malayans have an entirely different way of thinking. Cracking
this problem is the biggest job. Many of the volunteers who live
in the big cities do not feel this. In most of the countries the
Peace Corps visits, the West has made an impact. In Malaya,
Elvis Presley often haunts the radio—what a great heritage to
bring across the Pacific!
Most of the students wear Western clothes, as I do—white
shirts and ties. Coats are never worn here since it is very humid
and extremely hot. Many of the people wear their local dress,
and I frequently put on my sarong merely because it is the
coolest thing I own.
I am in an all boys’ school, and I have found the students
very polite. Every morning for every class they stand and say,
‘‘good morning, sir.” Some of them say it so hypocritically loud
I feel like an idiot. There is very little social life over here. There
are three married couples in town and they all enjoy Malaya and
have very nice homes. Married volunteers really do a better job
over here since they tend to get out in society more than the
single ones. I must confess that the women over here are very
beautiful but also very shy.
One encounters a myriad of small things one must adjust to
. , . each one of the volunteers lives a different life, some four
in a group with a servant and a cook and others as myself, alone,
doing all my own cooking and cleaning. There are advantages to
both, but the point is that no training can really prepare you for
a foreign country. I really hope that anyone who are interested
in the Peace Corps will consider it carefully. It is in many ways a
lonely existence, but well worth it to one who really wants to do
a job.
One must come with the idea that he can and will accept,
whatever comes, and be prepared for anything. For example, I
arrived in Bukit Mertajam on a Thursday night and began teach
ing a full load on Friday and tried to find a house on Saturday.
