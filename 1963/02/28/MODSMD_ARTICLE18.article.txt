## Tribe Wrestlers Send Kendall, Three Others to PCIWA Meet 
### JUSTIN BECK 
This weekend four Stanford
j varsity wrestlers travel to Ash
[ land, Oregon, for the PCIWA
| meet, held this year at Southern
Oregon. Wrestling coach Jim
I Easter has selected Jon Kay at
i 147 pounds, Phil Kendall at 157,
| Tom Allen at 177, and Don Bueh
ler at heavyweight, to make the
trip.
Easter said that at least 17
schools are entered in the tour
nament, including UCLA, Cal,
and Washington State, in addi
tion to Stanford, from the AAWU.
THE TRIBE has already met
Cal and UCLA in dual meets this
year, losing to Cal 16-9, and to
UCLA 23-10, Easter hopes to get
a good look at the rest of Stan
ford’s AAWU opposition this
weekend in preparation for the
conference meet in Los Angeles,

March 8-9.
Kendall finished third at 157
pounds in last year’s PCIWA.
This year he has ihe best record
on the team. 7-1, his only loss
coming against powerful Oregon
State, after Kendall had missed
a week of practice with a broken
nose. Kendall and Kay are this
year’s co-captains.
Both Allen and Buehler were
late starters this year. Allen saw
no action in varsity competition
until the last four meets, when
he slimmed down to 177 pounds.
Since then he has compiled a 2-2
record at that weight. Buehler
didn’t wrestle until the fourth
meet of the year, turning in a
4-3 season mark.
Last night the Indians met
San Quentin in a dual meet at
San Quentin. The results will be
in tomorrow’s Daily.
