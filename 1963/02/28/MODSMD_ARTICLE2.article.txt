# 'Scratch Sheet' to Go on Sale Tomorrow at Library, Union
## 
### JAMES POAGE 
Tlit* "Scratch Sheet”—containing criticisms of more than ninety
courses—will make its debut tomorrow.
The new publication, which reviews courses given this spring
and next fall, will go on sale for 50 cents in front of the library
and Tresidder. Critiques are included for almost all the general

slunies courses, except Western
Civilization and freshman Eng
lish courses, and three to five up
per division courses in each of
the major departments in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences. Engineering courses are
not covered.
QUESTIONNAIRES that asked
specific hut open-ended questions
were completed by students who
had taken courses in the various
departments. Randy Gallister, 1
one of flic organizers said, “We
tried very hard to give fair and
balanced appraisals based almost
entirely on what we got in the
polls and not on our personal
opinions. It some polls praised a
course and others panned it, we
gave both sides along with the
reasons why they did or did not
like it.”
More than 20 different people
were involved in writing the cri
tiques. The critiques were edited
primarily to obtain consistency
of style, and not to change their
content. According to Gallister,
the editors “tried to make them
as witty and readable as possible
without interfering with their ob
jectivity.’’
THE “SCRATCH SHEET" is
the first publication of its kind at
Stanford. Plans are in the mak
ing for it to be a bi-annual pub
lication, one issue appearing in
the fall covering winter and
spring courses and another issue
in the spring covering fall and
series courses.
Preparation for the publication
began last spring and was plan
ned and organized during the rest
of the year. Some of the problems
faced were how r courses should be
criticized, how the questionnaires
should be worded, how many up
per division courses should be
criticized, and what sort of criti
cal lone should be adopted.
