# Indians End Home Season with Bears
## 
### 
The Stanford swimming team
closes its home season this week
end. On Saturday the Indians will
compete in the second seasonal
“Big Meet” against Cal. Though
the Bears are not particularly
strong this year and though Stan
ford defeated them easily in their
first meeting, they may well pre
sent surprising competition,
since they will be more than anxi
ous to salvage a losing season by
tarnishing the best Indian record
in ten years.

On Friday the Tribe will meet
local rival San Jose State. Since
the Spartans have won the last
two encounters with the Indians
and have a strong team again
this season, they must be con
sidered a formidable opponent.
SJS has excellent depth, especial
ly in sprinters. The most out
standing of these short distance
swimmers is Nick Shoenmann,
the fastest sprinter in San Jose
history and one of the best in
Northern California. Shoenmann
is also the mainstay of an excel
lent freestyle relay team. The
Spartans also possess several
divers of quality, a commodity
conspicuously absent from the In
dian team.
