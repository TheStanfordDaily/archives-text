# RUSSELL KIRK:
## Intemperance of Mind Creates Most Severe Threat to Academic Freedom 
### 
“Intemperance of mind is prob
ably the greatest and most per
sistent threat to academic free
dom in the academy,” said Dr.
Russell Kirk yesterday in a
speech on “The Essence of Aca
demic Freedom” presented by the
Conservative Caucus of Political
Union in Tresidder at 4:15 p.m.
This intemperance of mind ere- j
ales ideologues who seek academ
ic power rather than freedom and |
who wish to indoctrinate rather !
than to teach, according to Kirk. I
a conservative known for such i
books as “The Conservative I
Mind.”
KIKK NAMED the existence of i
a body of sound scholars who arc
temperate and tolerant of mind |

as the first condition for aca
demic freedom. The second con
dition is the existence of a body
of students who are reasonably
well educated, seeking the truth,
and able to carry on free dis
course.
Kirk feels lhal the growth of
mass higher education in (he
United States in the years since
World War II presents a danger
to academic freedom since “only
about three per cent and at most
ten per cent of the students arc
really in pursuit of truth.”
If a professor faces “rows of
empty human milk bottles wait
ing to be filled with answers
which they can pour back on the
tests, the temptation for the pro
fessor to become an Indoctrinator
can hardly be resisted,” according
to Kirk.
ALTHOUGH KIUK stated that
“the question of academic free
-1 dom is larger and more impor
| tanl than this issue” of Cormnu
| nist teachers, ho did give his
views on the matter.
In describing the decision of
I the President of the University of
j Washington who more than a
decade ago'fired members of the
faculty who had refused to sign
declaimer oaths, he said. “I am
j satisfied with the general decision
that a communist does not have
( a place as a faculty member, but
j I am not wholly satisfied with his
grounds.”
Kirk feels that the fact that
j communist professors do not be
j lieve in academic freedom and are
! trying to destroy it is more im
i portant than the reason advanced
I in the University of Washington
1 incident, the fact that a commit
; nist is bound by Marxist dogma
i and is, therefore, not free to
I search for truth.
