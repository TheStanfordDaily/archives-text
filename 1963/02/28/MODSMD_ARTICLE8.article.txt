# ACCORDING TO POLL
## Fraternities Don't Favor Rush Plan 
### PELL FENDER 
A Daily lelephone poll of various members of
Stanford fraternities revealed that most of the
fraternities do not favor the present extended
rush program.
Most of the individuals polled feel that the in
creased number of open houses is disagreeable
both to the freshmen and to the fraternities them
selves. A member of Phi Kappa Sigma stated that
neither the freshmen nor the actives were as en
thusiastic about each other. John Luce, Beta Chi
feels that the present program is an attempt oi
the part of Wilbur sponsors to save the Wilbui
House system.
THIi RUSH CHAIRMAN of Theta Delta Ch
stated that the open houses were 100 lime consum
ing, especially with midterms and finals to worry
about. Also, he stated, the house is getting a chi'
ferent group of freshmen each time. A typical
opinion was, “the first week was fine, and the
house was happy.”

Most of the individuals liked the idea of open
contact during the winter quarter but agreed that
the increased number of open houses did nothing
to stem “dirty rush” practices. One member of
Phi Gamma Delta feels that the winter rush is
“fine” and that the house is getting to know the
freshmen better.
Other complaints about the program included
the strain on a house's treasury, and a difficulty
in keeping a house in shape.
ALMOST ALL OF the individuals interviewed
agreed that the seven-week program in the spring
is impractical and should be abandoned. The Rush
Chairman of Zeta Psi feels that the spring pro
gram defeats the very purpose of the new plan.
By then, the freshmen know what they want, said
the rush chairman of Sigma Chi.
Many of the individuals expressed a desire to
return to the old system of rushing. They feel that
fewer open houses and one week in the spring
suffice to acquaint a freshman with all the fra
ternities at Stanford.
