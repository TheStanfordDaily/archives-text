# U.N. Ambassador Boland: Blocs Forced to Reappraise Policies
## 
### STEPHEN LEOPOLD 
"In the last six months, noticeable conflicts and rifts have torn
the three major blocs—the Communists, the Western powers, and
the nonaligncd countries—and forced these nations to make a new
reappraisal of their policies" commented Dr. Frederick 11. Boland,
Irish Ambassador to the United Nations and former president of

the General Assembly, in his
opening address lo the Stanford
United Nations yesterday in Me
morial Auditorium.
Boland went on to say that the
events of recent months, the
widening of the Sino-Soviet split,
the division of the Atlantic Alli
ance by Gen. De Gaulle’s recent
actions, and the China-India bor
der conflict, have forced each of
the blocs to reflect on their fu
ture. He noted that the Sino-
Soviet split is already very wide
and probably will become even
wider in the future. On the other
side of the Iron Curtain, Franco
has thrown up “a serious chal
lenge to American leadership of
the Atlantic Alliance, which will
take patience and statesmanship
on both sides to resolve.”
THE CONFUSION among the
so-called ‘non-aligned’ in the
aftermath of the Chinese attack
on India has been a major cause
of the recent reappraisal of poli
cy by the members of the neutral
bloc.
“Non-alignment as a foreign
policy was found to have certain
limitations. For if a neutral na
tion, and certainly there is no
more neutral nation than India,
is attacked by a member of either
of (he two opposing blocs, she
must cither accede to the de
mands of the aggressor, or else
seek aid from the other bloc.”
India took the latter course,
and the other non-aligned nations
were not unified in their view of
India’s stand. Thus, the unity of
neutrals, if it was over a fact,
certainly is not one now.
ON THE ISSUE of admission
of Communist China to the Unit
ed Nations, a proposal which the
SUN will debate today, Boland
conceded that if the problem was
dealt with in a “purely abstract
manner,” then a good case can
be made for seating the Commu
nists.
He noted that the arguments
for admission namely, that as a
world organization, the UN
should recognize all effective
governments; that a vote for
seating does not mean approval
of the members of the UN or the
Communist government; and that
China must be admitted to the
UN in order to discuss disarma
ment and war and peace had
some validity.
However, Boland presented two
rebuttals to Ihese arguments: li
Admission of Red China will be
a signal for war to break out be
tween Peiping and Taiwan; 2)
On a moral order,” admission of
Red China would nullify the
meaning of the UN. “We all noted
the disappointment in the UN
: when no action was taken when
India attacked Goa. What then
1 would be the feeling of world
opinion if Red China, the nation
i that attacked India, were admit-
I ted to the UN?”

and the other non-aligned nations
were not unified in their view of
India’s stand. Thus, the unity of
neutrals, if it was over a fact,
certainly is not one now.
ON THE ISSUE of admission
of Communist China to the Unit
ed Nations, a proposal which the
SUN will debate today, Boland
conceded that if the problem was
dealt with in a “purely abstract
manner,” then a good case can
be made for seating the Commu
nists.
He noted that the arguments
for admission namely, that as a
world organization, the UN
should recognize all effective
governments; that a vote for
seating does not mean approval
of the members of the UN or the
Communist government; and that
China must be admitted to the
UN in order to discuss disarma
ment and war and peace had
some validity.
However, Boland presented two
rebuttals to Ihese arguments: li
Admission of Red China will be
a signal for war to break out be
tween Peiping and Taiwan; 2)
On a moral order,” admission of
Red China would nullify the
meaning of the UN. “We all noted
the disappointment in the UN
: when no action was taken when
India attacked Goa. What then
1 would be the feeling of world
opinion if Red China, the nation
i that attacked India, were admit-
I ted to the UN?”
"In the last six months, noticeable conflicts and rifts have torn
the three major blocs—the Communists, the Western powers, and
the nonaligncd countries—and forced these nations to make a new
reappraisal of their policies" commented Dr. Frederick 11. Boland,
Irish Ambassador to the United Nations and former president of

the General Assembly, in his
opening address lo the Stanford
United Nations yesterday in Me
morial Auditorium.
Boland went on to say that the
events of recent months, the
widening of the Sino-Soviet split,
the division of the Atlantic Alli
ance by Gen. De Gaulle’s recent
actions, and the China-India bor
der conflict, have forced each of
the blocs to reflect on their fu
ture. He noted that the Sino-
Soviet split is already very wide
and probably will become even
wider in the future. On the other
side of the Iron Curtain, Franco
has thrown up “a serious chal
lenge to American leadership of
the Atlantic Alliance, which will
take patience and statesmanship
on both sides to resolve.”
THE CONFUSION among the
so-called ‘non-aligned’ in the
aftermath of the Chinese attack
on India has been a major cause
of the recent reappraisal of poli
cy by the members of the neutral
bloc.
“Non-alignment as a foreign
policy was found to have certain
limitations. For if a neutral na
tion, and certainly there is no
more neutral nation than India,
is attacked by a member of either
of (he two opposing blocs, she
must cither accede to the de
mands of the aggressor, or else
seek aid from the other bloc.”
India took the latter course,
and the other non-aligned nations
were not unified in their view of
India’s stand. Thus, the unity of
neutrals, if it was over a fact,
certainly is not one now.
