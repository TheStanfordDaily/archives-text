HAIL TO THE DEAN!
Today let us examine that much maligned, widely misunder
stood, grossly overworked, wholly dedicated campus figure
the dean.
The dean (from the Latin Deanere —to expel) is not, as many
think, primarily a disciplinary officer. He is a counselor and
guide, a haven and refuge for the troubled student. The dean
(from the Greek Deanos— to skewer) is characterized chiefly by
sympathy, wisdom, patience, forbearance, and a fondness for
homely pleasures like community singing, farina, spelldowns,
and Marlboro Cigarettes. The dean (from the German Deanqe
mncht—to poop a party) is fond of Marlboros for the same
reason that all men of good will are fond of Marlboros—because
Marlboro is an honest cigarette. Those good Marlboro tobaccos
are honestly good, honestly aged to the peak of perfection, hon
estly blended for the best of all possible flavors. Marlboro
honestly comes in two different containers—a soft pack which
is honestly soft and a Flip-Top box which honestly flips. You
too will flip when next you try an honest Marlboro, which, one
honestly hopes, will be soon.

But I digress. We were learning how a dean helps poor,
troubled undergraduates. To illustrate, let us take a typical
case from the files of Dean S of the University of Y
(Oh, why be so mysterious? The dean’s name is Sigafoos and
the University is Yutah.)
Wise, kindly Dean Sigafoos was visited one day by a fresh
man named Walter Aguincourt who came to ask permission to
marry one Emma Blenheim, his dormitory laundress. To the
dean the marriage seemed ill-advised, for Walter was only 18
years old and Emma was 91. Walter agreed with the dean, but
said he felt obligated to go through with it because Emma had
invested her life savings in a transparent rainhood to protect
her from the mist at Niagara Falls, where they planned to spend
their honeymoon. If Walter called off the wedding, what use
would the poor woman possibly have for a rainhood in Yutah?
The wise, kindly dean pondered briefly and came up with a
brilliant answer; let Walter punch holes in the back of Emma’s
steam iron. With steam billowing back at the old lady, she
would find a rainhood very useful—possibly even essential.
Whimpering with gratitude, Walter kissed the dean’s Phi
Beta Kappa key and hastened away to follow his advice—and
the results, I am pleased to report, were madly successful!
Today Emma is a happy woman—singing lustily, wearing
her rainhood, eating soft-center chocolates, and ironing clothes
twice as happy, to be candid, than if she had married Walter
. . . And what of Walter? He is happy too. Freed from his un
wanted liaison with Emma, he married a girl much nearer his
own age—Agnes Yucca, 72. Walter is now the proud father—
stepfather, to be perfectly accurate—of three fine, healthy
boys from Agnes’s first marriage—Everett, 38; Wilhelm, 43;
and Irving, 55—and when Walter puts the boys on a lead and
takes them for a stroll in the park on Sunday afternoon, you
may be sure there is not a dry eye in Yutah.
And Dean Sigafoos? He too is happy—happy to spend long,
tiring hours in his little office, giving counsel without stint and
without complaint, doing his bit to set the young, uncertain
feet of his charges on the path to a brighter tomorrow.

IFe don t say Marlboro is the dean of filter cigarettes, but
we’re sure it’s at the head of the class. Get some soon—
wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states of the Union.
