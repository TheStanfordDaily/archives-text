In many ways the story of the Thunderbird is one of
the most unusual in the automobile business. The
whole idea of the car was born at one of the great
European automobile shows. The then president of
our company pointed to some of the small, lush sports
cars that arc always a center of attention at such
shows and asked his companion, "Why can't we build
something like these?"
The companion, who later became a vice president
of the company, said, "It just so happens I have one
on the boards. I'll show it to you when we get back to
Detroit." Then as fast as he could discreetly get to a
transatlantic telephone he called his assistant and told
him, "Remember that car we've been talking about?
Finish those sketches on it."
The Thunderbird became one of the few cars ever
built that was produced essentially as the original
sketches presented it. Most cars undergo countless
changes in the design period. But there was a natural
clarity and cleanness to the Thunderbird design that
immediately captured all of us at Ford.
It was probably this clean, sharp look that won so
many friends so fast when the car went into produc
tion. That first Thunderbird had its drawbacks. For
example, it was too soft-sprung for true sports-car
handling. But, the truth is, it was not designed in the
European tradition of the fast performance car. Some
people called it a sports car but we never did. We
called it a "personal" car; a small, tairly luxurious car
that was fun to look at and fun to drive. It had its
own integrity: it was one alone.
Wo built the Thunderbird as a bellwether car for
Ford. It was our intention to test new ideas before
we put them into our lords, Fairlanes and Falcons.
The new Ford ride and Swing-Away steering wheel
appeared first on the Thunderbird, for instance. How
ever, we never foresaw the extraordinary influence
Thunderbird would have on the whole automobile
business here and abroad. Almost everybody offers
the Thunderbird bucket scats these days. And the
Thunderbird look is the most decisive styling of the '6os.
The Thunderbird is a classic, made so by a peculiar
blend of magic ingredients of which wo would love
to know the secret. We're building cars right now we
hope will become classics, but the truth is, we don't
make classics, we make cars. People make the car a
classic. And that's the story of the Thunderbird.
