### STEVE LEOPOLD 
Admission of Communist China to the Stanford United Nations
was rejected by a vote of 20 for, 54 against, and 19 abstentions
after a 90-minnte debate in the second session of the SUN at
Memorial Auditorium yesterday.
The defeated resolution resolved that “in every organ of the

►United Nations, the Republic of
China ho replaced by the People’s
Republic of China, which shall
he recognized as the de facto and
do jure representative of the peo
ple of the mainland of China.” It
was proposed as part of a much
more extensive resolution offered
to the General Assembly by Leon
Scales, chairman of the Nepalese
delegation. The original resolu
tion consisted of nine paragraphs
giving reasons for recognizing
Communist China, proposing a
plebiscite on the islands of For
mosa under U.N. supervision, and
reorganizing the Security Coun
cil to some extent.
Ken Jameson, chairman of the
Albanian delegation, immediately
moved that the first five para
graphs of the resolutions, those
giving reasons for recognizing
Communist China, be omitted,
and that the remaining four para
graphs he divided into two sec
tions, the first section to consist
of only paragraph six, the one
that would replace Nationalist
China with Communist China,
and the second section to include
the paragraphs on the plebiscite
and Security Council organiza
tion,
THE USSR backed the Albani
an proposal, the U.S. did not, and
the division of the resolution
I passed 35-20.
| During the debate on paragraph
| six that followed, Nationalist Chi
!na rejected any suggestion of
legitimacy of the mainland “revo
! lutionary” government and warn
jed the S.U.N. that it would be
“hypocrisy” to admit an aggres
sive nation into the “sole organ
of peace in the world.”
After several other delegates
had spoken on the issue, two
amendments were offered. The
first, co-sponsored by Luxem
bourg and Italy, proposed that
both Chinas be admitted to the
S.U.N. and that neither country
have a veto, or oven a permanent
seat, on the Security Council.
This amendment was rejected
33-44 with 9 abstentions.
ANOTHER amendment spon
sored by seven diverse countries
I and offered to the Assembly by
the Republic of the Congo—Leo-
I poldville, proposed that plebi
j scites be held under S.U.N. super-
I vision in both mainland China
; and Formosa to determine which
government should represent Chi
na. This amendment was also de
feated, 26-44 with 11 abstentions.
In both votes the U.S. and the
USSR voted against the proposed
amendments.
