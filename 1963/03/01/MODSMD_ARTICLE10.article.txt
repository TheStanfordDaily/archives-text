### United Press International 
NEW YORK The Now York Post broke from the solid front
of the Now York City Publishers’ Association yesterday and an
nounced it would resume publication Monday under an arrange
ment offered by the striking printers union.
Mrs. Dorothy Schiff, Post publisher, announced her resignation
from the publishers association at a news conference.
She said the newspaper would resume publication under terms
of the old union contract which ran out Dec. 8. The Post was one of
five papers that suspended or curtailed operations when the printers
went on strike against the Times, News, Journal American, and
World-Telegram & Sun,
Publishers of the other New York newspapers closed by the
strike stood firm despite Mrs. Schiff’s decision to resume publica
tion. They issued a statement saying;
“The decision of Mrs. Dorothy Schiff. publisher of the New
York Post, to resign from the Publishers’ Association of New York
City, and to resume publication, does not alter the firm determina
tion of the other publishers in the association to continue to press
for satisfactory agreement to end the current strike,
“They will meet Friday morning for this purpose, at the sug
gestion of Mayor Robert Wagner, with union representatives, in
cluding Elmer Brown, international president of the International
Typographical Union."
JFK URGES STRONGER CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION—WASH
INGTON President Kennedy sent Congress a special message yes
terday urging passage of civil rights legislation that won praise
from liberals of both parties but drew hot Southern opposition.
In his first direct request for anti-discrimination legislation on
behalf of Negroes, Kennedy asked for bills that would protect Negro
voting rights, provide federal aid for school districts trying to
desegregate and broaden the operations of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission.
Sen. Kenneth B. Keating, R-N.Y., who has accused Kennedy in
the past of dragging his feet on civil rights, commented: “Although
there are some notable omissions, this is the President’s strongest
message on civil rights to date.”
The Now York Republican said, however, that Kennedy’s “elo
quent words will have to be matched by determined leadership” if
any civil lights legislation is to be enacted.
Sen. Richard B. Russell, D-Ga., leader of the Senate Southern
bloc, said Kennedy has never urged Negro leaders “to make any
effort whatever to improve themselves so that, they will bo more
acceptable to other citizens who may have certain standards for
their associates.”
