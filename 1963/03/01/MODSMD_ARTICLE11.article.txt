# TELLER:
## Atomic Explosions Have Possible Peaceful Uses 
### HOPE SELBY 
Releasing water from rocks on the moon, reversing the direc
tion of rivers in Australia, and digging a canal through the
Malayan peninsula were some of the potential peaceful uses of
atomic energy cited by Dr. Edward Teller, professor-at-large
at the University of California, in his speech at Dinkelspiel Audi-

torium yesterday. The chief com
mercial use of atomic energy.
Teller stated, is that of isotopes
and radiation in industry and ag
riculture. Industrial uses of iso
topes Include testing the cleaning
power of detergents and the
thickness of cigarette paper.
More important are the uses of
radiation in agriculture and food
research that enable scientists to
test the effectiveness of fertilizer
and to produce beneficial muta
tions in plants and animals.
FAR MORE important than
this, Teller felt, is the peaceful
use of nuclear explosives for eco
nomic progress. Through re
search, thermonuclear explosives
have been reduced in size and
noise, making it possible to use
nuclear materials cheaply for
small explosions. Another impor
tant development is the ability of
scientists to make “clean” explo
sions in which workers can enter
the site of the explosion imme
diately after detonation.
The principle use of these ex
plosives is in geographical engi
neering—the use of nuclear ma
terials to change the surface of
the earth. In Hawaii, for example,
four new harbors could be blast
ed that would increase Hawaiian
trade and distribute the popula
tion more evenly throughout the
islands. In Alaska, a harbor
could be blasted near the coal
mines that would benefit the Pa
cific coal economy.
OTHER USES of atomic energy
in Alaska could include the con
struction of a canal through the
Aleutian peninsula and the cre
ation of a hydi'oelectric project
on the Yukon River.
In Egypt, nuclear explosives
could be used on the GabGaba
project, which could replace the
proposed Aswan dam. This proj
ect would store flood waters of
the Nile in the GabGaba depres
sion in the Lybian desert, thus
avoiding the displacement of peo
ple and the inundation of histori
cal monuments that the dam
would bring about.
In Australia, those explosives
could bo used to reverse the di
rection of the rivers, thus irrigat
ing the Australian desert. They
could also be used to create a
lake to store the dociennial des
ert rainfall. The construction of
a canal through the Malayan pe
ninsula would greatly facilitate
trade between the Philippines and
India.
A USE of this energy that
would have to be reserved for
the future would he the boiling
of rocks on the moon to release
the water they contain. This ex
periment was successfully car
ried out in the New Mexico Des
ert, where large quantities of
water were released from the
rocks. On the moon, this water
would be used to nourish the sci
entists working there.
At the conclusion of Teller’s
speech, the moderator suggested
that perhaps the first peaceful
use of nuclear explosives could
be made to relieve the parking
problem on the Berkeley campus.
“But that,” Teller said, “would
be too difficult.”

FAR MORE important than
this, Teller felt, is the peaceful
use of nuclear explosives for eco
nomic progress. Through re
search, thermonuclear explosives
have been reduced in size and
noise, making it possible to use
nuclear materials cheaply for
small explosions. Another impor
tant development is the ability of
scientists to make “clean” explo
sions in which workers can enter
the site of the explosion imme
diately after detonation.
The principle use of these ex
plosives is in geographical engi
neering—the use of nuclear ma
terials to change the surface of
the earth. In Hawaii, for example,
four new harbors could be blast
ed that would increase Hawaiian
trade and distribute the popula
tion more evenly throughout the
islands. In Alaska, a harbor
could be blasted near the coal
mines that would benefit the Pa
cific coal economy.
OTHER USES of atomic energy
in Alaska could include the con
struction of a canal through the
Aleutian peninsula and the cre
ation of a hydi'oelectric project
on the Yukon River.
In Egypt, nuclear explosives
could be used on the GabGaba
project, which could replace the
proposed Aswan dam. This proj
ect would store flood waters of
the Nile in the GabGaba depres
sion in the Lybian desert, thus
avoiding the displacement of peo
ple and the inundation of histori
cal monuments that the dam
would bring about.
In Australia, those explosives
could bo used to reverse the di
rection of the rivers, thus irrigat
ing the Australian desert. They
could also be used to create a
lake to store the dociennial des
ert rainfall. The construction of
a canal through the Malayan pe
ninsula would greatly facilitate
trade between the Philippines and
India.
A USE of this energy that
would have to be reserved for
the future would he the boiling
of rocks on the moon to release
the water they contain. This ex
periment was successfully car
ried out in the New Mexico Des
ert, where large quantities of
water were released from the
rocks. On the moon, this water
would be used to nourish the sci
entists working there.
At the conclusion of Teller’s
speech, the moderator suggested
that perhaps the first peaceful
use of nuclear explosives could
be made to relieve the parking
problem on the Berkeley campus.
“But that,” Teller said, “would
be too difficult.”
Releasing water from rocks on the moon, reversing the direc
tion of rivers in Australia, and digging a canal through the
Malayan peninsula were some of the potential peaceful uses of
atomic energy cited by Dr. Edward Teller, professor-at-large
at the University of California, in his speech at Dinkelspiel Audi-

torium yesterday. The chief com
mercial use of atomic energy.
Teller stated, is that of isotopes
and radiation in industry and ag
riculture. Industrial uses of iso
topes Include testing the cleaning
power of detergents and the
thickness of cigarette paper.
More important are the uses of
radiation in agriculture and food
research that enable scientists to
test the effectiveness of fertilizer
and to produce beneficial muta
tions in plants and animals.
