# Scratch Sheet': Aid to Students
## 
### 
The administration has indirectly discouraged its publi
cation, the faculty will claim not to have read it, and every
undergraduate ought to have one before he makes out next
quarter’s schedule.
The Stanford Scratch Sheet, on sale today, presents strik
ingly perceptive appraisals of every major course being offered
by the School of Humanities and Sciences in the Spring and
Fall of this year. Editor Randy Gallistel and his staff have
compiled ninety odd criticisms that are concise, thoughtfully
thorough and occasionally humorous. As a result, the reader
glancing at reviews of courses he has taken, more often than
not finds exact correspondence with his own views. Such a
result might be expected of a publication which has con
ducted an accurate, although often small, polling of students
through questionnaires.
The majority of courses are favorably reviewed and praise
is awarded where it is due. The History, Biology, and Political
Science Departments deserve and rightly receive a good share
of the acclamation. On the other hand, as a result of the stu
dent polling, French and Humanities courses are dealt with
harshly.
By avoiding the obvious temptation of criticizing unde
sirable idiosyncrasies of professors, and by limiting itself
solely to a discussion of teaching abilities, the “Sheet” has
avoided a pitfall that has hindered the effectiveness of such
documents on other campuses. The whole tone of this work’s
presentation is one of responsibility that demands the respect
and indeed the commendation of students and faculty alike.
If students do follow the advice of the Scratch Sheet, sev
eral courses will suffer from sparse enrollment or indeed no
enrollment at all next quarter. Long needed revisions will
presumably be made, and the whole academic community
will benefit.
Whatever the repercussions of such a frank appraisal
may be, the students and faculty should accept the Scratch
Sheet for exactly what it is: an effective, precise guide telling
undergraduates what their immediate predecessors have
thought of the Stanford academic curriculum.
