## Your Brand of Bird Seed 
### HOWARD L. WEINBERG Contributing Editor 
“You won’t get the sports fans to read your column,”
chirped the crafty cardinal, “and those are the undergraduates
who count.”
“I could talk about the PCIWA?”
“Piece-a-wha?”
“Are you a cardinal or a brave?” I said.
“I’m a brave cardinal that’s what. I’m a mascot.” declared
the bird.
Satisfied that this was neither a raven nor Peter Lorre in
disguise, but a genuine voice of the Stanford undergraduate, I
tried to communicate with the bird. This was nearly as difficult
as talking with one of the longer two-legged undergraduates. I
waited until he had finished the sports page.
“What class are you?” I asked.
"Nobody asks that question here. Where do you come from
—the East? Yeah, you Easterners are always trying to change
things out here. But we don’t buy your brand of bird seed,”
said the cardinal as he tried to peck at the keys of my type
writer.
“Look, cardinal, do you attend the theater?” I said as he
hit the carriage return and replied, "Of course.”
“Did you ever notice that very few undergraduates act in
the plays? You can’t always tell this because the classes aren’t
listed after the cast’s names. But if you inquire you learn that
most of the performers are graduate students, professors or
professional actors. Where are the undergraduates? If this
school has a talking cardinal, it must have some talented under
graduates—they’re not nearly as rare,” I said.
Red in the face as well as all over his body, the cardinal
countered, “You call yourself a graduate student. You don’t
understand the simple principle of a competitive market. The
best actors get the parts. Few undergrads can compete with the
pros. Anyway, aren’t the plays better?”
“They shouldn't have to compete. It’s no wonder audiences
are composed of mostly faculty and staff and grad students. If
undergraduates were given the chance to play the lead roles in
plays directed by their professors, not only would they benefit
greatly from the experience but their friends—other under
graduates—would come and see the plays more frequently. If the
football team was operated as the drama department is, we’d see
the coach playing quarterback,” I said.
“Not a bad idea,” chirped the cardinal, “But there are rules
of eligibility.”
“Just as there should be in the drama department or in any
other area where undergraduates are not given preference—
establish rules.”
“No comment.” said the cardinal who confessed he some
times had to represent the administration as will as the stu
dents. He saw no problem of conflicting loyalties in his position.
“Student judiciary committees are the same way,” he said.
"You shouldn’t worry more than the students themselves do
about their status in the university.”
I had seen the PACE movie and even in the original version
the undergraduate was sacrificed to the larger needs of the in
stitution. “The undergraduates should be the stuff of this in
stitution, not go unnoticed by a university that seems to exist
for grants and graduates. Stanford cannot expect to be a great
university unless her students are aware, unless the university
strives to stimulate them and provide them with the freedom
and opportunity to express themselves and to enable them to
benefit from association with graduate students and faculty, not
force them to retreat before their elders,” I said.
“If you’re going to be polemical, then I’ll fly away. The
weather’s too nice to argue with you over a typewriter. I prefer
the peace of my live oak tree,” sang the bird. “Funny freshmen,
silly sophomores, jaded juniors, sluggish seniors: beware, be
ware the gruesome graduates. They would try to improve your
taste. Don’t listen to them. Stick to your own brand of bird
seed.” He finished in a whistle.
“Bye, bye, birdie, cover your cage with The Daily tomorrow
and read the rest of this column.” I was irritated. Why did ho
interrupt me, anyway? Perhaps, he thought the title read “Avis.”

A carload of credit to Jan Studebaker whose colorful cray
ola and pen enliven the Faculty-Staff newsletter.
A reminder that it’s French movie time again at Film Forum
with Rene Clair’s “Le Million” showing Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in
the Little Theater.
And three cheers to whoever scheduled this week’s double
bills at the local theaters: A real double header is “Diamond
Head” and “Onion Head.” “Days of Wine and Roses” is aptly
bracketed with “Bramble Bush.” "Two for the Seesaw” is truly
a"Two Way Stretch.” Someone’s having fun. Iwis.

—the East? Yeah, you Easterners are always trying to change
things out here. But we don’t buy your brand of bird seed,”
said the cardinal as he tried to peck at the keys of my type
writer.
“Look, cardinal, do you attend the theater?” I said as he
hit the carriage return and replied, "Of course.”
“Did you ever notice that very few undergraduates act in
the plays? You can’t always tell this because the classes aren’t
listed after the cast’s names. But if you inquire you learn that
most of the performers are graduate students, professors or
professional actors. Where are the undergraduates? If this
school has a talking cardinal, it must have some talented under
graduates—they’re not nearly as rare,” I said.
Red in the face as well as all over his body, the cardinal
countered, “You call yourself a graduate student. You don’t
understand the simple principle of a competitive market. The
best actors get the parts. Few undergrads can compete with the
pros. Anyway, aren’t the plays better?”
“They shouldn't have to compete. It’s no wonder audiences
are composed of mostly faculty and staff and grad students. If
undergraduates were given the chance to play the lead roles in
plays directed by their professors, not only would they benefit
greatly from the experience but their friends—other under
graduates—would come and see the plays more frequently. If the
football team was operated as the drama department is, we’d see
the coach playing quarterback,” I said.
“Not a bad idea,” chirped the cardinal, “But there are rules
of eligibility.”
“Just as there should be in the drama department or in any
other area where undergraduates are not given preference—
establish rules.”
“No comment.” said the cardinal who confessed he some
times had to represent the administration as will as the stu
dents. He saw no problem of conflicting loyalties in his position.
“Student judiciary committees are the same way,” he said.
"You shouldn’t worry more than the students themselves do
about their status in the university.”
I had seen the PACE movie and even in the original version
the undergraduate was sacrificed to the larger needs of the in
stitution. “The undergraduates should be the stuff of this in
stitution, not go unnoticed by a university that seems to exist
for grants and graduates. Stanford cannot expect to be a great
university unless her students are aware, unless the university
strives to stimulate them and provide them with the freedom
and opportunity to express themselves and to enable them to
benefit from association with graduate students and faculty, not
force them to retreat before their elders,” I said.
“If you’re going to be polemical, then I’ll fly away. The
weather’s too nice to argue with you over a typewriter. I prefer
the peace of my live oak tree,” sang the bird. “Funny freshmen,
silly sophomores, jaded juniors, sluggish seniors: beware, be
ware the gruesome graduates. They would try to improve your
taste. Don’t listen to them. Stick to your own brand of bird
seed.” He finished in a whistle.
“Bye, bye, birdie, cover your cage with The Daily tomorrow
and read the rest of this column.” I was irritated. Why did ho
interrupt me, anyway? Perhaps, he thought the title read “Avis.”

A reminder that it’s French movie time again at Film Forum
with Rene Clair’s “Le Million” showing Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in
the Little Theater.
And three cheers to whoever scheduled this week’s double
bills at the local theaters: A real double header is “Diamond
Head” and “Onion Head.” “Days of Wine and Roses” is aptly
bracketed with “Bramble Bush.” "Two for the Seesaw” is truly
a"Two Way Stretch.” Someone’s having fun. Iwis.
“You won’t get the sports fans to read your column,”
chirped the crafty cardinal, “and those are the undergraduates
who count.”
“I could talk about the PCIWA?”
“Piece-a-wha?”
“Are you a cardinal or a brave?” I said.
“I’m a brave cardinal that’s what. I’m a mascot.” declared
the bird.
Satisfied that this was neither a raven nor Peter Lorre in
disguise, but a genuine voice of the Stanford undergraduate, I
tried to communicate with the bird. This was nearly as difficult
as talking with one of the longer two-legged undergraduates. I
waited until he had finished the sports page.

Red in the face as well as all over his body, the cardinal
countered, “You call yourself a graduate student. You don’t
understand the simple principle of a competitive market. The
best actors get the parts. Few undergrads can compete with the
pros. Anyway, aren’t the plays better?”
“They shouldn't have to compete. It’s no wonder audiences
are composed of mostly faculty and staff and grad students. If
undergraduates were given the chance to play the lead roles in
plays directed by their professors, not only would they benefit
greatly from the experience but their friends—other under
graduates—would come and see the plays more frequently. If the
football team was operated as the drama department is, we’d see
the coach playing quarterback,” I said.
“Not a bad idea,” chirped the cardinal, “But there are rules
of eligibility.”
“Just as there should be in the drama department or in any
other area where undergraduates are not given preference—
establish rules.”
“No comment.” said the cardinal who confessed he some
times had to represent the administration as will as the stu
dents. He saw no problem of conflicting loyalties in his position.
“Student judiciary committees are the same way,” he said.
"You shouldn’t worry more than the students themselves do
about their status in the university.”
I had seen the PACE movie and even in the original version
the undergraduate was sacrificed to the larger needs of the in
stitution. “The undergraduates should be the stuff of this in
stitution, not go unnoticed by a university that seems to exist
for grants and graduates. Stanford cannot expect to be a great
university unless her students are aware, unless the university
strives to stimulate them and provide them with the freedom
and opportunity to express themselves and to enable them to
benefit from association with graduate students and faculty, not
force them to retreat before their elders,” I said.
“If you’re going to be polemical, then I’ll fly away. The
weather’s too nice to argue with you over a typewriter. I prefer
the peace of my live oak tree,” sang the bird. “Funny freshmen,
silly sophomores, jaded juniors, sluggish seniors: beware, be
ware the gruesome graduates. They would try to improve your
taste. Don’t listen to them. Stick to your own brand of bird
seed.” He finished in a whistle.
“Bye, bye, birdie, cover your cage with The Daily tomorrow
and read the rest of this column.” I was irritated. Why did ho
interrupt me, anyway? Perhaps, he thought the title read “Avis.”

ola and pen enliven the Faculty-Staff newsletter.
A reminder that it’s French movie time again at Film Forum
with Rene Clair’s “Le Million” showing Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in
the Little Theater.
And three cheers to whoever scheduled this week’s double
bills at the local theaters: A real double header is “Diamond
Head” and “Onion Head.” “Days of Wine and Roses” is aptly
bracketed with “Bramble Bush.” "Two for the Seesaw” is truly
a"Two Way Stretch.” Someone’s having fun. Iwis.
