Some time ago mention was made by the Administration
that Stanford students should be more responsible and show this
responsibility by keeping the area of student activities neater
than it had been kept. It is all very well to talk of keeping a well
developed area clean, but when the “patio” or “mall” between
Tresidder Union and the Post Office is still in the state of being
either a quagmire or a dust bowl depending on the weather,
there is little incentive to keep such a place clean. There is, in
fact, a noticeable difference between the developed terrace near
th Union Store and the aforementioned mall as far as amount of
trash is concerned. I would be interested to know what is to be
done with the mall area, if anything. Certainly University pub
licity is not aided by such slum appearances.

Editors, The Daily:
As a delegate to the Stanford United Nations, I feel com
pelled to disagree with The Daily’s strong commendation of the
S.U.N. No matter what the energy and ability of the individual
delegate, he cannot really function within a weak organizational
framework.
Many things are wrong with the S.U.N. of which the follow
ing are particularly annoying:
1) Only one of the three questions on the agenda, the ad
mission of Red China to the U.N. has ever been discussed at the
U.N. at length. Consequently, delegates cannot study the atti
tudes of the country they represent and must rely largely on
personal opinion.
2) The committee system established under the S.U.N. bears
no relation to that of the real U.N. Instead of discussing the
questions as delegates, committee members were to revert to
their roles as Stanford students and do research for what
amounted to committee term papers. No constructive resolu
tions came out of committees and students learned nothing
about the operation of a U.N. Committee.
3) Delegates wore not properly informed of the operating
procedures and agenda of the S.U.N. Consequently, the first
session was a morass of parliamentary procedures, confusion as
to the order of business and red tape.
It is unfortunate that an idea as commendable as the S.U.N.
should have been so poorly developed. Perhaps next year the HR
should pattern their program more closely to that of the M.U.N.,
an organization of 10 years experience.

Jazz sessions will no longer be held in Tresidder dining room
on Friday afternoons at four o’clock because there have been
complaints about excessive noise. We understand that the music
cannot be heard in the lecture rooms above. It is our feeling that
the purpose of a student union is not to serve as a surrogate
library. For those who wish to study there, one may conclude
that either they have no serious academic intentions or they
have admirable powers of concentration. Therefore, we would
like to recommend the reinstatement of the Friday afternoon
jazz sessions.

delegate, he cannot really function within a weak organizational
framework.
Many things are wrong with the S.U.N. of which the follow
ing are particularly annoying:
1) Only one of the three questions on the agenda, the ad
mission of Red China to the U.N. has ever been discussed at the
U.N. at length. Consequently, delegates cannot study the atti
tudes of the country they represent and must rely largely on
personal opinion.
2) The committee system established under the S.U.N. bears
no relation to that of the real U.N. Instead of discussing the
questions as delegates, committee members were to revert to
their roles as Stanford students and do research for what
amounted to committee term papers. No constructive resolu
tions came out of committees and students learned nothing
about the operation of a U.N. Committee.
3) Delegates wore not properly informed of the operating
procedures and agenda of the S.U.N. Consequently, the first
session was a morass of parliamentary procedures, confusion as
to the order of business and red tape.
It is unfortunate that an idea as commendable as the S.U.N.
should have been so poorly developed. Perhaps next year the HR
should pattern their program more closely to that of the M.U.N.,
an organization of 10 years experience.

Jazz sessions will no longer be held in Tresidder dining room
on Friday afternoons at four o’clock because there have been
complaints about excessive noise. We understand that the music
cannot be heard in the lecture rooms above. It is our feeling that
the purpose of a student union is not to serve as a surrogate
library. For those who wish to study there, one may conclude
that either they have no serious academic intentions or they
have admirable powers of concentration. Therefore, we would
like to recommend the reinstatement of the Friday afternoon
jazz sessions.

Some time ago mention was made by the Administration
that Stanford students should be more responsible and show this
responsibility by keeping the area of student activities neater
than it had been kept. It is all very well to talk of keeping a well
developed area clean, but when the “patio” or “mall” between
Tresidder Union and the Post Office is still in the state of being
either a quagmire or a dust bowl depending on the weather,
there is little incentive to keep such a place clean. There is, in
fact, a noticeable difference between the developed terrace near
th Union Store and the aforementioned mall as far as amount of
trash is concerned. I would be interested to know what is to be
done with the mall area, if anything. Certainly University pub
licity is not aided by such slum appearances.

As a delegate to the Stanford United Nations, I feel com

S.U.N. No matter what the energy and ability of the individual
delegate, he cannot really function within a weak organizational
