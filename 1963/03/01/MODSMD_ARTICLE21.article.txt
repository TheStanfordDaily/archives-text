The question of integrating
dormitories for next year was
decided in the affirmative last
night by the Women's Student
Government Association assem
bly by a vote of 28 to 20.
The integration will be an a |
corridor basis and follow the
model established in Donlon this
year. The administrative func
tions of the dormitory and the
role of the vice president will be
altered in these four dormitories.
The change will affect the
WSGA dormitory officer selec
i tion and training program. There
I will be 45 V.P.'s and 4 freshman
dormitory presidents selected,
and all of them will undergo a
training program stressing the
problems of living in an inte
grated dormitory.
Relating WSGA’s two pressing
problems, its preoccupation with
intra - dormitory management
which inhibits its proper concern
for the broad interests of Cornell
women and the ineffectiveness of
its highly organized structure, de
signed primarily for sensitive
communication between the gov
ernment and its constituents,
Edith Osborne, president of
WSGA. urged a partial reorgani
zation to allow more time for at
tention to general concerns of
women.
Under the jurisdiction of the
Exec Com. will bo a Residential
Council to deal with dormitory
matters, committees for selection,
publicity and training and Panhel
Council. The Exec Com. can re
view the actions of all these
groups—and those of Panhel
which deal with sororities as liv
ing units.
