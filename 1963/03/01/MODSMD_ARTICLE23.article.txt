# Cards Meet USC for Crucial Game
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
The USC Trojans play two
AAU basketball games in Los
Angeles Ibis weekend, both of
vital interest to the league-lead
ing Stanford Indians. Tonight SC
meets UCLA, the top contestant
for first place despite its third
place standing. (Washington, cur
rently in second place, has little
chance of winning either of its
two remaining games, at Cal and
UCLA, and thus is no threat to
Stanford.)
A Trojan win in tonight’s game
between L.A.’s traditional collegi
ate rivals would immeasurably
help Stanford toward its first
league championship in 21 years;
the Indians would then be virtual
ly assured of at least a tie and
could clinch the title by winning
two of the i r three remaining
league games.
SC's SECOND weekend game
is of even greater concern to
Stanford, for it matches the Tro
jans and Indians in the L.A. State
Gym. Although it will be played
at 7 p.m, tomorrow night, its out
come will undoubtedly be influ
enced by the result and mien of
the SC UCLA game. Even if SC
loses (which is more likely than

most Indian fans like to think),
a strenuous game may physically
fatigue Troy for tomorrow; fur
ther, SC may suffer some sort of
letdown after reaching an emo
tional peak for the Bruin-game.
Naturally, either of these occur
ances would favor Stanford.
Judging from the two previous
Indian-Trojan games this year, it
looks like Stanford may need one
of these extra advantages. SC
has won both games, 65-57 in the
L.A. Classic and 61-57 three weeks
ago in the Pavilion. Both nights
Stanford had miserable shooting,

hitting 31 and 33 per cent respec
tively, while the Trojans were
shooting 44 per cent, substantially
above (heir season’s average of
about 38 per cent.
SINCE THEN the Trojans have
won three out of four games in
cluding victories over Oregon
Stale (67-58) and Washington,
(59-53) both in the Northwest; it

was the Huskies’ only league loss
in Seattle.
6-7 center Gordon Martin con
tinues to lead USC in just about
has dropped to second in AAWU
scoring with a 21.1 point average.
His best support comes from 6-5
forward Allen Young, who is aver
aging 12 points and nine rebounds
in league play.
Center Tom Dose, now leading
the AAWU in scoring (21.4) and
rebounds (12), will be Stanford’s
main weapon. He has scored over
twenty points in each of Stan
ford’s last five games and should
continue this string against the
mediocre team defense of SC and
the non • existent individual de
fense of Martin. However, he’ll
need help from Don Clemetson,
Kent Hinckley, Darrell Suther
land, and Hollis Moore in the
form of outside shooting if the
Tribe is to win its first game in
the Southland this season.

Radio station KCBS (710)
will broadcast the Stanford-
IJSC game starting at 7 p.m.

tomorrow night to stay in the Big Six conference race.

jans and Indians in the L.A. State
Gym. Although it will be played
at 7 p.m, tomorrow night, its out
come will undoubtedly be influ
enced by the result and mien of
the SC UCLA game. Even if SC
loses (which is more likely than

most Indian fans like to think),
a strenuous game may physically
fatigue Troy for tomorrow; fur
ther, SC may suffer some sort of
letdown after reaching an emo
tional peak for the Bruin-game.
Naturally, either of these occur
ances would favor Stanford.
Judging from the two previous
Indian-Trojan games this year, it
looks like Stanford may need one
of these extra advantages. SC
has won both games, 65-57 in the
L.A. Classic and 61-57 three weeks
ago in the Pavilion. Both nights
Stanford had miserable shooting,

hitting 31 and 33 per cent respec
tively, while the Trojans were
shooting 44 per cent, substantially
above (heir season’s average of
about 38 per cent.
SINCE THEN the Trojans have
won three out of four games in
cluding victories over Oregon
Stale (67-58) and Washington,
(59-53) both in the Northwest; it

was the Huskies’ only league loss
in Seattle.
6-7 center Gordon Martin con
tinues to lead USC in just about
has dropped to second in AAWU
scoring with a 21.1 point average.
His best support comes from 6-5
forward Allen Young, who is aver
aging 12 points and nine rebounds
in league play.
Center Tom Dose, now leading
the AAWU in scoring (21.4) and
rebounds (12), will be Stanford’s
main weapon. He has scored over
twenty points in each of Stan
ford’s last five games and should
continue this string against the
mediocre team defense of SC and
the non • existent individual de
fense of Martin. However, he’ll
need help from Don Clemetson,
Kent Hinckley, Darrell Suther
land, and Hollis Moore in the
form of outside shooting if the
Tribe is to win its first game in
the Southland this season.

Radio station KCBS (710)
will broadcast the Stanford-
IJSC game starting at 7 p.m.


LITTLE LEW SHUPE (11) hits on a jump shot against USC while
teammate Tom Dose screens out Trojan Wells Sloniger in Stanford's 61-57 loss earlier this month. The Indians must beat USC
tomorrow night to stay in the Big Six conference race.
The USC Trojans play two
AAU basketball games in Los
Angeles Ibis weekend, both of
vital interest to the league-lead
ing Stanford Indians. Tonight SC
meets UCLA, the top contestant
for first place despite its third
place standing. (Washington, cur
rently in second place, has little
chance of winning either of its
two remaining games, at Cal and
UCLA, and thus is no threat to
Stanford.)
A Trojan win in tonight’s game
between L.A.’s traditional collegi
ate rivals would immeasurably
help Stanford toward its first
league championship in 21 years;
the Indians would then be virtual
ly assured of at least a tie and
could clinch the title by winning
two of the i r three remaining
league games.
SC's SECOND weekend game
is of even greater concern to
Stanford, for it matches the Tro
jans and Indians in the L.A. State
Gym. Although it will be played
at 7 p.m, tomorrow night, its out
come will undoubtedly be influ
