## 
### 
The Stanford gymnastics team
came through in fine form
Wednesday night as they earned
their first dual meet victory of
the season with a 75-52 topping
of San Francisco State.
Roger Rhoads, who did not
compete in the last match with
SFS (Stanford lost 61 V-z -48 Va ),
placed second in four events, third
in one and fourth in another for
21 total points. Bill .Rusher, with
a first in long horse and places in
four more events, had 14 points,
while double winners Russ Bur
mester ihigh bar and rings), and
Alan Miyamoto (side horse and
parallel bars) had 12 and 13
points apiece.
Marc Weissbluth had a second
(in tumbling), a third and a
fourth for 9 points, and Rod Rin-
I derknecht had six points with a
I third, a fourth and a fifth place.

Burmester had the high indi
vidual event total with a fine 8.75
on the still rings, and Rusher re
ceived an 8.32 rating in his long
horse win.

The Indians lost only three
events in team scoreâ€”free exer
cise, side horse and trampoline.
This was the first meet that Stan
ford has entered the optional
trampoline event.
Tonight the team will try for
their second seasonal win against
Sacramento State in the capitol
city.
