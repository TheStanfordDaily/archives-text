## San Jose to Test Indian Power 
### 
Stanford’s roundball nine hope
to continue their current hot hit
ting streak in two baseball games
with San Jose State this week
end. The Cards play in San Jose
this afternoon, and return to
Sunken Diamond tomorrow for a
game at 3 p.m.
Centerfielder Greg Post is
leading the Indian batters with a

fat .300 batting average. Ho has
also scored quite a few of Stan
ford’s four-game total of 26 runs.
COACH Dutch Fehring plans
to start right-hander Pete Dixon
on the mound today, following
with ace pitcher Jim Lonborg in
tomorrow’s contest.
San Jose lost its opener to Cal
last weekend, 8-2, on seven un
earned runs. The Spartans will
probably start their ace hurler.
John Dawson today. Dawson
went six innings against Cal, al
lowing only one run.
Last year San Jose split with
Stanford, the Spartans winning
the opener 10-3, and Stanford
taking the return engagement,
2-0.
