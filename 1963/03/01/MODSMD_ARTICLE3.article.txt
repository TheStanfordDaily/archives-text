# Boland Foresees World Federation
## 
### 
Ultimately, mankind will ac
cept world federation, said Dr.
Frederick H. Boland, Irish Am
bassador to the United Nations
and former President of the Gen
eral Assembly, speaking last
night in Memorial Auditorium be
fore the Stanford United Nations.
The possibility of the advent
of world government becomes in
creasingly a real possibility: sci
entific advances are shrinking
the world; peoples of the world
are becoming aware of the inter
dependence of societies; and the
Cold War threat of world annihi
lation necessitates world unity
and understanding, making “na
tional safety and national delu
sion nothing but snares.”
Boland recognized the practical
limitations to the. establishment
of a world government at the
present time, but cited two con
ditions which were once theoreti
cal dreams but are now essential
ly realized: the end of colonial
ism, and the unity of Western
Europe.
Berlin, the embodiment of the
rift between East and West, ex
emplified the inadequacy of the
U.N.’s powers. The movement of
the U.N. or one of its special
agencies to Berlin and the estab
lishment of Berlin as a free city
have been suggested as solutions
to the problem, but these sugges
tions have never been proposed
or discussed within the United
Nations, Boland said. It is feared
that the U.N. might he irrepara
bly damaged if it ventured onto
the battleground of the East and
the West. The U.N. must not re
ject any effort whereby the Ber
lin crisis might be allayed, Bo
land concluded.
