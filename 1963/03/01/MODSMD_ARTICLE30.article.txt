# TRIBE HAS BALANCE. DEPTH
## Trackmen Debut Tomorrow 
### PETE KINO 
Stanford’s potentially greatest
track team in many years will
tost its strength tomorrow against
an aggregation of independent
trackmen from the Santa Clara
Valley Youth Village at 1:30 p.m.
on Angell Field.
The Indians have five school
record holders back from last
year’s squad and plenty of prom
ising sophomore talent to hack
them up. Coach Payton Jordan
calls his 1963 team the deepest

and best balanced he has had in
seven seasons as coach.
TOMORROW’S CONTEST will
be scaled after an Olympic meet,
with no team scoring and with
such odd events as the 3000-yard
steeplechase, three-mile run, and
hop, step, and jump. The Stanford
freshmen will be the third team
competing.
Not much is known of the
Youth Village team, with only
two of their best marks available.
The team is composed mainly of
ex-college trackmen, and in the
past has been strongest in the
field events. Many of its runners
have done well in the indoor track

circuit this year, so the meet will
be a tough first test for the In
dians. It should also answer a
few of the questions that Jordan
has about how the team’s many
inexperienced sophomores will
stand up to varsity competition.
STANFORD will he led by dis
cus thrower Dave Weill, the de
fending national collegiate cham
pion and current school record
holder at 191-7'j. Although Weill
is by far the best in the area, he
will get good competition from

SCVYV’s Dan Studney and from
freshman Bob Stoecker, who has
thrown the high school platter
195-4 and the larger college discus
164-4 .
In the dashes, transfer Jack
Scott, who has best times of 9.6
and 21.1 in the 100 and 200-yard
sprints, and Phil Lamoreaux (9.8,
21.4), last year’s top sprinter,
should battle it out for first.
In the middle distances, Ken
Emanuels, beaten only once in
dual meets in the 440 last year,
will face Keith Thomassen of
SCVYV. whom he barely defeated
last season. Bob Miltz, Bill Pratt,
and Robin Ruble are the Tribe’s
best half-milers.
TWO OF Stanford’s strongest

events this year will be the mile i
and two-mile, Harry McCalla is
the only Indian ever to crack nine
minutes for two miles, and is the |
AAWU champion in the three-!
mile. He’ll run the steeplechase I
tomorrow, while Paul Schlieke,
Dave Deubner, and Weym Kirk
land will run the three-mile.
Freshman Deubner has the best
lime in this event, 13:57.7.
The hurdles will feature Stan
ford’s Steve Cortright, who lost
by two-tenths of a second to col
legiate champion Hayes Jones
earlier in the month. His best of
14.4 in the highs is approached
only by Stoecker’s high school
14.6 time. Cortright is also en
tered in the hop, step, and .lump,
where his 49-IVi> effort leads all
Stanford competitors,
John Fontius and Sam Kipp are
the Cards’ top high jumpers. Kipp
soared over 6-5 earlier in the year,
while Fontius has a 6-6 host.
IN THE JAVELIN, Stanford
grad Art Batchelder, of SCVYV, |
has a best mark which is 40 feet I
better than the nearest competi
tor, Stoecker.
The versatile Stoecker will be!
competing in the discus, shot put,
javelin, and high hurdles, and i
holds the best marks among the
freshmen in three of those events.


STANFORD’S CHANCES for a fine track season rest partly on Ken
Emanuels, left, and Phil White, right. Emanuels was beaten only
once in dual competition in the 440 last year, while White set a
Stanford pole vault record of 15-1/ 2 .
