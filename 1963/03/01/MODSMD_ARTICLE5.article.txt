# JOSEPH MSIKA:
## Racial Tension in Southern Rhodesia Caused by Negro in Political Minority 
### Bv SHEILA RICKETTS 
"There is racial tension in my country at the moment,” said
Joseph Msika, Secretary for Youth Affairs and a member of tin 1
National Executive of Z.A.F.U., the African nationalist party of
Southern Rhodesia, yesterday in Tresidder where he was the
opening speaker in a panel discussion of four youth leaders
from the Central African Feder-+ ■

ation.
“This tension arises from the
political crisis resulting from the
attempt of the white men to se
cure political rule under a minor
ity,” Msika continued.
Msika, who has spent lime in
Southern Rhodesian jails for his
political activities, went on to de
scribe the events which led up to
the refusal of Z.A.P.U. to take
part in the recent elections under
the new constitution.
The primary African objec
tions to the new constitution, ac
cording to Msika, were that it
did not change the franchise, that
it did not have land reforms en
shrined in it, and that while it

raised the number of Parliamen
tary seats from 30 to 65, Africans
were allowed only 15 or less than
one third of these seats.
The African leaders felt that
while Ihe black man was going
to participate in the government
for the first time, he was going
to be there merely as a “dummy”
to impress the outside world.
“We refused to have anything
to do with this constitution,”
said Msika. “If we had accepted
the 15 seats, we would have be
trayed the interests of the black
people of our country.”
Vernon Mwaanga, representing
the United National Independence
Party (U.N.1.P.) of Northern
Rhodesia, pointed out similar
problems in his country, which
with Southern Rhodesia and Ny
asaland forms the uneasy Central
African Federation.
The present constitution, which
allows 15 seats to the blacks, 15
to the whites, and 15 national
seats chosen through a long
series of stipulations is, accord
ing to Mwaanga, “one of the most
complicated constitutions the
world has even seen.”
In spite of these complications,
the U.N.I.P. decided to take part
in the recent elections and now
rules in coalition with the moder
ate African National Congress.
“We have drafted a new consti
tution for Ihe territory of North
ern Rhodesia," said Mwaanga,
“and have presented it to the
British government. We are hop
ing there will be a constitution
conference next year.”
