# Scratch Sheet: Brutal But Honest
## 
### BRAD EFRON 
The first and most important
| thing to notice about the “Stan
| ford Scratch Sheet” is that it is
j once again being published after'
i an absence of several years. It is
| not surprising that an organ de
j voted to honest and therefore oc
casionally brutal criticism of
Stanford’s course material has
not commanded overwhelming
support from a student body pre
occupied with “getting good rec
i ommendations.” The team of Gal
i listel, Conrad, and Rosenbaum
j are to be congratulated for their
I perseverance, honesty, and bald
I courage.
LEAFING THROUGH this slim
j volume is like delving into some
strange mad anti-catalogue, pre
| pared by the administration in a
j moment of insane candor. It
j made me almost giddy to read
I that “The French Department is
| hardly the shining light of the
school of humanities and sci
ences,” that “in its present for-
I mat History 65 ought to be avoid-
I ed,” and that “the Journalism
( Department is virtually a trade

school.” Nor is the criticism con
ducted at an entirely impersonal
level. One feels an actual twinge
of pity for poor Stokes, who ‘‘can
he called good only in compari
son with Giraud,” for Knoles,
who “never really gets to first
base,” and for “flashy and amus
ing” Dornbush. who “unfortun
ately has little substance to what
he says,” at least not in Sociology
1. It must be some unexpected
loophole in Mrs. Stanford’s other
wise ironclad will that permits
such refreshing roughage to re
place our usual diet of pap.
HAPPILY, the “Scratch Sheet"
is not just an angry fist waving
in the face of academic tyranny.
It is not oven just a couple of an-1
gry fingers. The majority of the
critiques are favorable, some oc
casionally ecstatic. As the au
thors take pains to explain in
their ambiguously titled intro
duction (“Why We Did It and
How”) one of the main purposes S
of the sheet is to guide under
graduates toward excellent
courses they might otherwise
overlook.
The Scratch Sheet’s course crit
icisms are the concensus of long

! and difficult “thought-type ques
tion” polls sent to upperclass res
: idences earlier (his year. The
I number of respondees is typically
Ismail (about 8), but the re
sponses are intelligent, incisive,
and well-written. They are occa
sionally even witty, which shows
that the authors are not yet mak
ing the mistake of taking their
own mission too seriously. Mathe
matics and science are covered
less proficiently than the humani
ties, and statistics isn’t even men
tioned in its own right. The one
j consistent error is an excessive
i premium placed on comprehensi
bility and organization, and a
! corresponding disinterest in con
tent. Some of the best courses
are taught by the worst teachers,
and Dewey, Charlie Chaplain, and
the Great Caruso working to
gether couldn’t make home eco
nomics worth knowing.
The current issue favors Fall
i Quarter courses but a review of
this quarter is promised in the
Spring. The price is fifty cents
two and a half flick tickets—for
thirty pages, a cheap enough way
to strike a blow for improved
pedagogy.
