# S.U.N. Approves Berlin Resolution
## 
### ANN TODD 
The General Assembly of the
S.U.N. voted to leave the settle
ment of the Berlin situation to
the four powers directly concern
ed and to leave the establishment
of a constitution for world gov
ernment to the International Law
Commission with the provision
that the member nations would
retain the right to make sugges
tions to the Commission.
The Berlin resolution, proposed
by Austria on Friday, was passed,
46 yes, 29 no, and 15 abstentions.
With the adoption of this resolu
tion, all further U.N. resolutions
were merely considered as recom
mendations and not binding to
the four powers.
Some delegates became disturb
ed when a Honduras resolution
providing for the condemnation
of the Beilin wall was put to the
vote without debate at the insist
ence of Secretary-General, Law
rence Deßivort. The x’esolution
was passed, 46 yes, 12 no, 15 ab
staining, but the Russian dele
gation under Allan Anderson
threatened its walkout from the
Assembly.
The indignation of the Russian
delegation was expressed during
the Friday evening session by
Nepal which complained of the
change of agenda after the begin
ning of the session. Deßivort re
plied that expected speakers had
dropped out, requiring a change
in agenda.
Several delegations then called
for a reopening of the Honduras
discussion. Deßivort said no but
consented to a revote. In revote,
39 delegations voted yes, 7 no.
and 42 nations abstained in pro
test to procedure.
The session ended with the de
feat. of the Norwegian constitu
tion for world government by a
decisive vote because "it is too
idealistic.”
In Saturday’s session, Assem
bly debate on a later defeated
United Arab Republic-Afghani
stan constitution was interrupted
by a Cuban procedural motion
that the People’s Republic of
China be allowed to attend de
bates on world government, “for
to discuss world government
while excluding one-third of the
world’s population would be sheer
hypocrisy.” The motion was car
ried, 43-23-11; however, Red Chi
na refused, claiming it would not
participate in such a farcical de
bate by an assembly which would
not accept the People’s Republic
as the true representative of the
Chinese people.
The S.U.N. ended on a dramatic
note. Nepal delegate, Clark Hin
denliter, again brought up the
touchy subject of the Secretary-
General’s “lack of notice of the
assembly’s feeling over the Hon
duras Resolution. Deßivort im
mediately ruled Hinderliter out of
order, and his ruling was answer
ed by the mass walkout of the
Nepal delegation, the entire So
viet bloc, and other scattered del
egations.
