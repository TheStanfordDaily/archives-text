# The

The Stanford United Nations, sponsored by the Institute
of International Relations, met last Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday, It would he very difficult to give the S.U.N. over
whelming acclamation.
Mistakes—many made long ago in the first planning
stages—became evident in the general assemblies held last
week. Undoubtedly, the lack of elemental organization which
plagued the entire S.U.N. could have been eliminated had
the planners taken more time to prepare carefully for the
assemblies and for those difficulties which arose.
The different delegations apparently were not made to
understand what was expected of them. They were not aware
of what their responsibilities were to be; neither were they
aware what goal the S.U.N. was to achieve. A member of the
S.U.N. Committee has said that the main purpose of the
S.U.N. was to bring the questions—China, Berlin, World Gov
ernment—before the students. A model of the United Nations
was a purely coincidental incentive to the students to look
at the different sides of the questions. It is very doubtful that
any large percentage of the delegates were aware of this
goal, or that the delegates would have been willing to accept
it had they been aware of it.
The tremendous time span between the initiation of the
program and the final assembly was unnecessary. There was
a great deal of time between the middle of October and the
middle of Winter Quarter in which delegates were supposed
to have been studying about their countries and the U.N. and
in which very little work of any sort was accomplished.
The assemblies were handicapped by a great deal of con
fusion caused, in part, by the unwillingness of some students
to act responsibly and with good manners. They were also
handicapped by the lack of knowledge about the procedural
rules (which were, in fact, inadequate for the situation), and
by chairmen unable to control or to communicate to the as
sembly.
1 he idea of having a Stanford United Nations is an excel
lent one. The S.U.N. is almost limitless in the value that it can
have in teaching about the United Nations and about the par
ticular country which a student may represent. Any organiza
tion which is able to get so many Stanford students interested
in a project of some worth is commendable.
Before the S.U.N. is held again, however, the committees
involved would do well to organize more closely and carefully
all of the different aspects of the delegations and to communi
cate to the delegates exactly what is expected of them.
ith a hard working and well organized steering commit
tee and a well instructed and industrious group of delegates,
the S.U.N. could develop into a tradition of which Stanford
could be proud.
