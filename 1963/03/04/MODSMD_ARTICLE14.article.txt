## 'The Exiles' Could be More' 
### JOHN LUCE 
“The Exiles,” Albert Guerartl, Macmillan
In his latest novel, “The Exiles,” Albert Guerard tells a fast
moving story and tells It well. His topic, South and Central
American politics and political zealots, is timely and pertinent;
his writing and prose style is flawless and given added credulity
as it is written by an ostensibly first-hand reporter. Those char
acters presented in the novel, and the events in which they are
involved, are so interesting and absorbing one barely has time
to consider their plausibility. In sum, “The Exiles” is an inter
esting and entertaining book, and perhaps more impoidant, it
should, and will sell. So do Earle Stanley Gardner mysteries;
so do Dick Tracy, and Dondi.
My complaint with “The Exiles” rests not on what the book
says but on what it does not: the incomplete or non-existent
thematic structure of the novel, and eventually Mr. Guerard’s
artistic purpose. “The Exiles” only begins to discuss the various
human elements that seemingly work at cross-purposes within
the psyche and the extension of such elements into the personal
and political world of the novel. In this world, two personalities
play tile key roles: Manuel Andrada, a bumbling mixture of
sexual obsession and political fanaticism, and Justo de Villa
mayor, one-time politician, leader of men, poet and historian,
who bears the yoke of disciples in his search for peace and non
involvement. Among Villamayor’s following are a host of finan
cial and quasi-intellectual patrons, an entourage of mistresses
and wellwishers, and a particular Norte Americano, Nicholas
Clive, narrator and reporter of the story, swept along with the
human tide on “a whim.”
The inter- and intra-personal struggles and attractions of
this motley crew are the substance of the plot structure of the
novel, but they are not fully explored or understood in terms
of theme or meaning. Guerard is seemingly interested in the
equivalence of sexual and political zeal in Andrada, presenting
the relation in Andrada’s initial appearance (“ . . . the two
bulges, small misplaced female breasts, signified first a receiver
and second a wallet containing many documents . . . ”) but no
where is the complexity of desire fully explained, nor is Andrada
carried to potential symbolic length. Villamayor, at once a tired
man who would shrug off his following while nodding them on,
is not great nor magnetic enough to justify his followers, nor is
his “non-greatness” and passivity played up enough to suggest
the irony of personal or political popularity. And ultimately the
possible theme of personal and political devotion is still in the
formative stages at the conclusion of the novel. Nichalos Clive
is but a reporter at the scene; his participation is not sufficient
to justify his control over the story, and his inherent thematic
potential in explaining character motivation is never realized.
Basically, Clive’s place in the story explains the very limitations
of the novel: Guerard does little with the narrator, and little
with “The Exiles.”
The jacket cover of “The Exiles” describes it as a “comedy.”
If it were, much of (he above criticism might be disregarded, but
it cannot, because “The Exiles” is predominately serious and
throughout one receives the impression that the author is trying
much more than burlesque and satire. "A whim, yet not entirely
a whim ...” is the initial statement of the novel—“ The Exiles”
could, and should, be more.

potential in explaining character motivation is never realized.
Basically, Clive’s place in the story explains the very limitations
of the novel: Guerard does little with the narrator, and little
with “The Exiles.”
The jacket cover of “The Exiles” describes it as a “comedy.”
If it were, much of (he above criticism might be disregarded, but
it cannot, because “The Exiles” is predominately serious and
throughout one receives the impression that the author is trying
much more than burlesque and satire. "A whim, yet not entirely
a whim ...” is the initial statement of the novel—“ The Exiles”
could, and should, be more.
“The Exiles,” Albert Guerartl, Macmillan
In his latest novel, “The Exiles,” Albert Guerard tells a fast
moving story and tells It well. His topic, South and Central
American politics and political zealots, is timely and pertinent;
his writing and prose style is flawless and given added credulity
as it is written by an ostensibly first-hand reporter. Those char
acters presented in the novel, and the events in which they are
involved, are so interesting and absorbing one barely has time
to consider their plausibility. In sum, “The Exiles” is an inter
esting and entertaining book, and perhaps more impoidant, it
should, and will sell. So do Earle Stanley Gardner mysteries;
so do Dick Tracy, and Dondi.
My complaint with “The Exiles” rests not on what the book
says but on what it does not: the incomplete or non-existent
thematic structure of the novel, and eventually Mr. Guerard’s
artistic purpose. “The Exiles” only begins to discuss the various
human elements that seemingly work at cross-purposes within
the psyche and the extension of such elements into the personal
and political world of the novel. In this world, two personalities
play tile key roles: Manuel Andrada, a bumbling mixture of
sexual obsession and political fanaticism, and Justo de Villa
mayor, one-time politician, leader of men, poet and historian,
who bears the yoke of disciples in his search for peace and non
involvement. Among Villamayor’s following are a host of finan
cial and quasi-intellectual patrons, an entourage of mistresses
and wellwishers, and a particular Norte Americano, Nicholas
Clive, narrator and reporter of the story, swept along with the
human tide on “a whim.”
The inter- and intra-personal struggles and attractions of
this motley crew are the substance of the plot structure of the
novel, but they are not fully explored or understood in terms
of theme or meaning. Guerard is seemingly interested in the
equivalence of sexual and political zeal in Andrada, presenting
the relation in Andrada’s initial appearance (“ . . . the two
bulges, small misplaced female breasts, signified first a receiver
and second a wallet containing many documents . . . ”) but no
where is the complexity of desire fully explained, nor is Andrada
carried to potential symbolic length. Villamayor, at once a tired
man who would shrug off his following while nodding them on,
is not great nor magnetic enough to justify his followers, nor is
his “non-greatness” and passivity played up enough to suggest
the irony of personal or political popularity. And ultimately the
possible theme of personal and political devotion is still in the
formative stages at the conclusion of the novel. Nichalos Clive
is but a reporter at the scene; his participation is not sufficient
to justify his control over the story, and his inherent thematic
potential in explaining character motivation is never realized.
