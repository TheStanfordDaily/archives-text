## Peace Corps Moves into Universities 
### Collegiate Press Service 
CARACAS, Venezuela—The Peace Corps has been sending
volunteers into jungle, desert, swamp and mountain in the last
year, in widely varied areas of Latin America.
But, perhaps not surprisingly, the Corps is having one of
its greatest successes in the relatively comfortable grounds of
Venezuelan universities.
When the Peace Corps first went to work in Venezuela,
Corps administrators and volunteers began to make contacts and
become friends of many Venezuelan educators and students.
Soon requests for teachers began to come in, and the Corps
decided to comply with the requests. The Corps has since pro
vided 29 volunteer teachers to Venezuela’s universities.
Many Latin American universities have long histories of
anti-American sentiment, and the autonomous, inviolate nature
of the universities makes them important centers of political
agitation. The students often constitute an elite in their society
by virtue of the relatively low level of general education in their
countries, and many of them are bound to go into government
and business, taking their anti-American sentiments learned in
the universities with them. Venezuelan university students have
one of the longest histories of political activity and agitation in
all Latin America.
Equally conversant in Spanish and English, the Corps teach
ing volunteers are teaching in non-political fields, but feel that
they are having a significant political impact by virtue of their
continued presence in the universities. The volunteers feel that
they are clearing away inbred political myths about Americans
and the U.S. as a whole as they make friends with students
and other teachers. They note that their willingness to discuss
issues and the fact that some of (he volunteers express positions
at variance with U.S. government policy with complete freedom
impresses these students and teachers.
Whether or not they are able ot destroy ingrown prejudices,
the volunteers say that they are at'leiast ending stereotyping of
Americans as reactionary imperialists* forcing those with whoi'n
they come in contact to admit that there are at least a few ex
ceptions—29 of them in fact.
Since the teaching volunteers are provided room and board
by the universities in which they teach, they have taken a size
able cut in the regular Corps living allowance. None gets moi'e
than $l3O a month, considerably less than low-salaried Vene
zuelan teachers. The Corps volunteers are teaching primarily in
the state universities in the outlying states of Venezuela. They
have not yet been invited to the Central University of Vene
zuela, in Caracas, where an extremist student government has
won student elections for several years.
