Editors, The Daily:
The group of students for whom Mr. Bert Carp registered
an appeal in Tuesday’s Daily, has been formed and approved
by LASSU; a group which will be outspoken, unafraid to voice
criticism, provide a platform from which others can criticize, and
in general, force people and institutions to evaluate themselves.
This group is the Anarchist Caucus of Political Union, and it,
although not made up of Communists, might, very well make
Nixon and lots of other people blush.
Wednesday’s Daily covered the general outline of the An
archist Caucus, but failed to indicate its emotional outlook. This
outlook is best summed up in the immortal line from the Bo
gart opus “Treasure of the Sierra Madre,” where the bandito
indignantly cries out, as will the members of the Anarchist Cau
cus, “I don’t gotta show you no stinkin’ badges” (Spoken with
a heavy Mexican accent).
The first meeting of the Anarchist Caucus will take place
Wednesday, March 6, in Room 271 in Tresidder Union. I hope
Mr. Carp and all others who wish to either voice an opinion with
the guarantee that it will be heard, or help others to do this, will
be in attendance.

Dear General Studies Department:
We the undersigned seniors wish to express our extreme
disappointment in the proposed list of Senior Colloquia. We ap
preciate the attempts of our gurus to “stimulate serious
thought” through these colloquia. However, we feel that the
array of obscure subjects presented for Spring Quarter can add
nothing but laughter, boredom, and trumpery to our education.
Indeed, the Chaparral could have though up nothing as ludi
crous as “How to Ask a Question,” “Sociology of Adolescent
Sub-Cultures,” “Man and Society in Doderer’s Novel” (who?),
or “Plants and Their Relation to History.” Who wants to be re
quired to buy “The History and Social Influence of the . . .
Potato?”
