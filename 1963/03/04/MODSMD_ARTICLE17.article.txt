# Gagers Clinch Title Tie; Dose Basket Beats USC
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
The Stanford basketball team
frizzled away a tremendous sec
ond-half advantage Saturday
night against USC, but as soon
as the Trojans tied the game, in
the last 20 seconds, the Indians
abruptly awoke them from their
state of euphoria with a tie-break
ing basket to win 60-58. The de
ciding goal was a lay-in by Tom
Dose at 0:03 with great assistance
from Kent Hinckley.
For the entire weekend, the

Trojans had shunned their low
status in the AAWU hierarchy
and played great hall against the
best two teams in the league,
UCLA and Stanford. Although
they fell short against the Tribe,
their performance Friday night
was inspired enough to edge the
Bruins 62-60. The weekend for
Stanford, however, was a com
plete success; at 7-3, the Indians
can do no worse now than tie
UCLA (4-5) for the champion
ship: another Stanford win or
UCLA loss will clinch the title.
Stanford’s first in 21 years.
IT MIGHT easily have been
otherwise, however, for with 15
seconds left in the Saturday
game in L.A. State’s Gym, the
score was tied at 58-58, with three
Stanford starters, Hollis Moore,
Clayton Raaka, and Don Clemet
son, fouled out and Dose ginger
ly nursing four fouls. Stanford
has once owned second-half leads
of 14 points with twelve minutes
left and nine points with 2:30 re
maining. But as their shooting
went cold, the Trojans steadily
reduced the lead, setting up good

shots and hitting them consist
ently. They finally closed the
margin to 36-58 at 1:45 on a three
point play by Gordon Martin, his
24th point, to lead both teams.
I However, for over one minute
they remained two points behind
| despite Stanford’s losing the ball
I on a missed free throw and on an
| offensive foul by Clemetson;
j nevertheless, SC passed up two
1 ideal opportunities to tie, as Wells
Sloninger and Martin, two of the
I AAWU's best free throwers,
I choked both ends of two-shot
| fouls (Sloninger missed every
thing on his first shot).
I BUT WHEN Stanford tried to
| inbound the ball against SC’s full
j court press, after an out-of
j bounds rebound, Sloninger slap-
I ped the ball away from Dose and
sank the tying basket, a five
footer at 0:15.
Stanford immediately called
time out to set up a play for Dose
inside; but guard Kent Hinckley,
the man with the ball, and Dose
were guarded so closely that a
j pass was impossible. So Hinckley
I broke around his man and drove
| toward the basket. As he neared
j the baseline, Martin came out to
j stop him, leaving Dose open for
a beautiful bounce feed from
Hinckley, the winning play of the
j game.
STATISTICALLY, Stanford led
[ nearly every phase of the contest.
|Clemetson’s outstanding floor
! play, offensively and defensively,
j together with several pass inter
ceptions by other Indians, result
}od in substantially fewer ball
| control errors. Stanford's superi
or rebounding (47-35), led by
Raaka with 16, was another domi
jnating factor. With these advan-
I (ages, Stanford was able to take
j 21 shots more than SC. However,
| many of these were missed by
t Dose, who had an off-night with
jl3 points, despite , many good,
i open shots underneath.
The only compensatory factor
for SC was its free throwing. In
their usual scrambling style of
play, the Trojans drew 20 fouls
(while being called for only 11)
and outscored Stanford by 10
from the line.
