# Trackmen Impressive in Debut; Records Set
## 
### PETE KINO 
The 1963 track season may plow
a swath through the Stanford
record books, if Saturday’s warm- 1
up meet with the Santa Clara
Valley Youth Village on Angell
Field is any indication.
Since it was the first meet of
the year, the times and distances
as a whole naturally were far
short of spectacular. However,
two Stanford records were set,
and seven trackmen bettered
their all-time best efforts, a heal
thy sign that coach Payton Jor
dan’s protegees could be on their
way to the greatest Stanford
track year since the 1949-51 teams
set six University records and
finished second and third in the
NCAA meet.
THE MEET was not scored, hut
Stanford would have won handily
if it had been. The Indians won
12 of 18 events, with two of
SCVYV’s victories by former
Stanford trackmen. The Stanford
freshmen also competed as a
team and picked up two seconds
and thirds against the stronger
opposition.
The meet started off on a bril
liant note when Harry McCalla,
Stanford two-mile record holder,
ran the 3000-yard steeplechase in
9:01, breaking his own Stanford
record by over 15 seconds. He
would have finished under nine
minutes if he hadn’t stumbled
over a barrier and fallen into the
water hazard. Dripping wet. Mc-
Calla got up quickly and put on
a finishing dash that nearly
made up for his fall.
Steve Cortright was the day’s
big winner. The Indian hurdler
won the 120 highs in 14.6, only
two-tenths off his best, won the
hop, step, and jump with a 46-2Vi*
leap, and easily won the 330-yd.
intermediate hurdles, a new event
this year. His 38-sec. time was
automatically a Stanford record.
SOPHOMORE Phil Arnaudo
ran a close second to Cortright
in the highs, his 14.8 time beating
his previous best. Sheridan
Downey almost upset teammate
Cortright (the Stanford record
holder) in the hop-step-jump, his
46-li effort nearly equalling his
previous best.
Art Batchelder of the Youth
Village had the best mark in the
field events. He hurled the jave
lin 247 feet, six inches. This effort
broke his own previous best (the
Stanford record) by almost six
feet. The throw was so prodigious
that the spear stuck only a foot
from the track boundary.
Jerry Winters was the other
Stanford grad to win. His 55-8
heave in the shotput was two feet
past Stanford’s Steve Arch.
IN THE SPRINTS, junior Eric
Frische stole the show. He was
nudged at the wire by the Vil
lage’s Bob Poynfer in the 100, but
his 10 flat time was his fastest
ever. In the 220, he ran away
from everybody except team
mate Jack Scott to win in 21,3,
bettering his previous mark by
half a second.
Freshman John Goode, who
competed in six events, broad
jumped more than a foot better
than his previous best and nearly
beat Dan Moore, who set a Stan
ford record in finishing fourth in
(he NCAA meet last year.
Goode’s 23-7% leap was best until
Moore sailed 23-11 on his fourth
jump.
DAVE WEILL, collegiate dis
cus champion at 191 -7 Va, easily
won for the Indians with a toss of
173-10, his first effort since get
ting out of the hospital.
SCVYV’s John Dobroth took the
high jump at 6-6, closely followed
by freshman Sam Kipp, at 6-4.
Kipp has cleared 6-8 in practice,
and is a fine prospect to break
Phil Fehlen’s six-year old 6-812
record. Stanford’s Jay Marik
copped fourth at 6-2 with his best
effort.
The three-mile was won by
Stanford’s Paul Schlicke, with a
14:26.5 clocking, excellent for this
early in the season. Card Bob
Miltz also had a creditable 1:53.2
in the half-mile.
THE INDIANS swept the 440,
mile, and weight man’s relays.
The team of Bob Mclntyre, Jack
Scott, Phil Lamoreaux, and Larry
Questad toured one lap in 42.3,
only four-tenths off their best.

All-in-all, it was a satisfying
first performance for Jordan’s
team, which showed that even
early in the season, personal and
team records can be set. A stiffor
test awaits them next Saturday,
when they host Cal and San Jose
State, two formidable track pow
ers, in the Stadium for the Stan
ford Relays.

ever. In the 220, he ran away
from everybody except team
mate Jack Scott to win in 21,3,
bettering his previous mark by
half a second.
Freshman John Goode, who
competed in six events, broad
jumped more than a foot better
than his previous best and nearly
beat Dan Moore, who set a Stan
ford record in finishing fourth in
(he NCAA meet last year.
Goode’s 23-7% leap was best until
Moore sailed 23-11 on his fourth
jump.
DAVE WEILL, collegiate dis
cus champion at 191 -7 Va, easily
won for the Indians with a toss of
173-10, his first effort since get
ting out of the hospital.
SCVYV’s John Dobroth took the
high jump at 6-6, closely followed
by freshman Sam Kipp, at 6-4.
Kipp has cleared 6-8 in practice,
and is a fine prospect to break
Phil Fehlen’s six-year old 6-812
record. Stanford’s Jay Marik
copped fourth at 6-2 with his best
effort.
The three-mile was won by
Stanford’s Paul Schlicke, with a
14:26.5 clocking, excellent for this
early in the season. Card Bob
Miltz also had a creditable 1:53.2
in the half-mile.
THE INDIANS swept the 440,
mile, and weight man’s relays.
The team of Bob Mclntyre, Jack
Scott, Phil Lamoreaux, and Larry
Questad toured one lap in 42.3,
only four-tenths off their best.

All-in-all, it was a satisfying
first performance for Jordan’s
team, which showed that even
early in the season, personal and
team records can be set. A stiffor
test awaits them next Saturday,
when they host Cal and San Jose
State, two formidable track pow
ers, in the Stadium for the Stan
ford Relays.

The 1963 track season may plow
a swath through the Stanford
record books, if Saturday’s warm- 1
up meet with the Santa Clara
Valley Youth Village on Angell
Field is any indication.
Since it was the first meet of
the year, the times and distances
as a whole naturally were far
short of spectacular. However,
two Stanford records were set,
and seven trackmen bettered
their all-time best efforts, a heal
thy sign that coach Payton Jor
dan’s protegees could be on their
way to the greatest Stanford
track year since the 1949-51 teams
set six University records and
finished second and third in the
NCAA meet.
THE MEET was not scored, hut
Stanford would have won handily
if it had been. The Indians won
12 of 18 events, with two of
SCVYV’s victories by former
Stanford trackmen. The Stanford
freshmen also competed as a
team and picked up two seconds
and thirds against the stronger
opposition.
The meet started off on a bril
liant note when Harry McCalla,
Stanford two-mile record holder,
ran the 3000-yard steeplechase in
9:01, breaking his own Stanford
record by over 15 seconds. He
would have finished under nine
minutes if he hadn’t stumbled
over a barrier and fallen into the
water hazard. Dripping wet. Mc-
Calla got up quickly and put on
a finishing dash that nearly
made up for his fall.
Steve Cortright was the day’s
big winner. The Indian hurdler
won the 120 highs in 14.6, only
two-tenths off his best, won the
hop, step, and jump with a 46-2Vi*
leap, and easily won the 330-yd.
intermediate hurdles, a new event
this year. His 38-sec. time was
automatically a Stanford record.
SOPHOMORE Phil Arnaudo
ran a close second to Cortright
in the highs, his 14.8 time beating
his previous best. Sheridan
Downey almost upset teammate
Cortright (the Stanford record
holder) in the hop-step-jump, his
46-li effort nearly equalling his
previous best.
Art Batchelder of the Youth
Village had the best mark in the
field events. He hurled the jave
lin 247 feet, six inches. This effort
broke his own previous best (the
Stanford record) by almost six
feet. The throw was so prodigious
that the spear stuck only a foot
from the track boundary.
Jerry Winters was the other
Stanford grad to win. His 55-8
heave in the shotput was two feet
past Stanford’s Steve Arch.
IN THE SPRINTS, junior Eric
Frische stole the show. He was
nudged at the wire by the Vil
lage’s Bob Poynfer in the 100, but
his 10 flat time was his fastest
ever. In the 220, he ran away
from everybody except team
mate Jack Scott to win in 21,3,

The 1963 track season may plow
a swath through the Stanford
record books, if Saturday’s warm- 1
up meet with the Santa Clara
Valley Youth Village on Angell
Field is any indication.
Since it was the first meet of
the year, the times and distances
as a whole naturally were far
short of spectacular. However,
two Stanford records were set,
and seven trackmen bettered
their all-time best efforts, a heal
thy sign that coach Payton Jor
dan’s protegees could be on their
way to the greatest Stanford
track year since the 1949-51 teams
set six University records and
finished second and third in the
NCAA meet.
THE MEET was not scored, hut
Stanford would have won handily
if it had been. The Indians won
12 of 18 events, with two of
SCVYV’s victories by former
Stanford trackmen. The Stanford
freshmen also competed as a
team and picked up two seconds
and thirds against the stronger
opposition.
The meet started off on a bril
liant note when Harry McCalla,
Stanford two-mile record holder,
ran the 3000-yard steeplechase in
9:01, breaking his own Stanford
record by over 15 seconds. He
would have finished under nine
minutes if he hadn’t stumbled
over a barrier and fallen into the
water hazard. Dripping wet. Mc-
Calla got up quickly and put on
a finishing dash that nearly
made up for his fall.
Steve Cortright was the day’s
big winner. The Indian hurdler
won the 120 highs in 14.6, only
two-tenths off his best, won the
hop, step, and jump with a 46-2Vi*
leap, and easily won the 330-yd.
intermediate hurdles, a new event
this year. His 38-sec. time was
automatically a Stanford record.
SOPHOMORE Phil Arnaudo
ran a close second to Cortright
in the highs, his 14.8 time beating
his previous best. Sheridan
Downey almost upset teammate
Cortright (the Stanford record
holder) in the hop-step-jump, his
46-li effort nearly equalling his
previous best.
Art Batchelder of the Youth
Village had the best mark in the
field events. He hurled the jave
lin 247 feet, six inches. This effort
broke his own previous best (the
Stanford record) by almost six
feet. The throw was so prodigious
that the spear stuck only a foot
from the track boundary.
Jerry Winters was the other
Stanford grad to win. His 55-8
heave in the shotput was two feet
past Stanford’s Steve Arch.
IN THE SPRINTS, junior Eric
Frische stole the show. He was
nudged at the wire by the Vil
lage’s Bob Poynfer in the 100, but
his 10 flat time was his fastest
ever. In the 220, he ran away
from everybody except team
mate Jack Scott to win in 21,3,
bettering his previous mark by
half a second.
Freshman John Goode, who
competed in six events, broad
jumped more than a foot better
than his previous best and nearly
beat Dan Moore, who set a Stan
ford record in finishing fourth in
(he NCAA meet last year.
Goode’s 23-7% leap was best until
Moore sailed 23-11 on his fourth
jump.
DAVE WEILL, collegiate dis
cus champion at 191 -7 Va, easily
won for the Indians with a toss of
173-10, his first effort since get
ting out of the hospital.
SCVYV’s John Dobroth took the
high jump at 6-6, closely followed
by freshman Sam Kipp, at 6-4.
Kipp has cleared 6-8 in practice,
and is a fine prospect to break
Phil Fehlen’s six-year old 6-812
record. Stanford’s Jay Marik
copped fourth at 6-2 with his best
effort.
The three-mile was won by
Stanford’s Paul Schlicke, with a
14:26.5 clocking, excellent for this
early in the season. Card Bob
Miltz also had a creditable 1:53.2
in the half-mile.
THE INDIANS swept the 440,
mile, and weight man’s relays.
The team of Bob Mclntyre, Jack
Scott, Phil Lamoreaux, and Larry
Questad toured one lap in 42.3,
only four-tenths off their best.

All-in-all, it was a satisfying
first performance for Jordan’s
team, which showed that even
early in the season, personal and
team records can be set. A stiffor
test awaits them next Saturday,
when they host Cal and San Jose
State, two formidable track pow
ers, in the Stadium for the Stan
ford Relays.

The 1963 track season may plow
a swath through the Stanford
record books, if Saturday’s warm- 1
up meet with the Santa Clara
Valley Youth Village on Angell
Field is any indication.
Since it was the first meet of
the year, the times and distances
as a whole naturally were far
short of spectacular. However,
two Stanford records were set,
and seven trackmen bettered
their all-time best efforts, a heal
thy sign that coach Payton Jor
dan’s protegees could be on their
way to the greatest Stanford
track year since the 1949-51 teams
set six University records and
finished second and third in the
NCAA meet.
THE MEET was not scored, hut
Stanford would have won handily
if it had been. The Indians won
12 of 18 events, with two of
SCVYV’s victories by former
Stanford trackmen. The Stanford
freshmen also competed as a
team and picked up two seconds
and thirds against the stronger
opposition.
The meet started off on a bril
liant note when Harry McCalla,
Stanford two-mile record holder,
ran the 3000-yard steeplechase in
9:01, breaking his own Stanford
record by over 15 seconds. He
would have finished under nine
minutes if he hadn’t stumbled
over a barrier and fallen into the
water hazard. Dripping wet. Mc-
Calla got up quickly and put on
a finishing dash that nearly
made up for his fall.
Steve Cortright was the day’s
big winner. The Indian hurdler
won the 120 highs in 14.6, only
two-tenths off his best, won the
hop, step, and jump with a 46-2Vi*
leap, and easily won the 330-yd.
intermediate hurdles, a new event
this year. His 38-sec. time was
automatically a Stanford record.
SOPHOMORE Phil Arnaudo
ran a close second to Cortright
in the highs, his 14.8 time beating
his previous best. Sheridan
Downey almost upset teammate
Cortright (the Stanford record
holder) in the hop-step-jump, his
46-li effort nearly equalling his
previous best.
Art Batchelder of the Youth
Village had the best mark in the
field events. He hurled the jave
lin 247 feet, six inches. This effort
broke his own previous best (the
Stanford record) by almost six
feet. The throw was so prodigious
that the spear stuck only a foot
from the track boundary.
Jerry Winters was the other
Stanford grad to win. His 55-8
heave in the shotput was two feet
past Stanford’s Steve Arch.
IN THE SPRINTS, junior Eric
Frische stole the show. He was
nudged at the wire by the Vil
lage’s Bob Poynfer in the 100, but
his 10 flat time was his fastest
ever. In the 220, he ran away
from everybody except team
mate Jack Scott to win in 21,3,
bettering his previous mark by
half a second.
Freshman John Goode, who
competed in six events, broad
jumped more than a foot better
than his previous best and nearly
beat Dan Moore, who set a Stan
ford record in finishing fourth in
(he NCAA meet last year.
Goode’s 23-7% leap was best until
Moore sailed 23-11 on his fourth
jump.
DAVE WEILL, collegiate dis
cus champion at 191 -7 Va, easily
won for the Indians with a toss of
173-10, his first effort since get
ting out of the hospital.
SCVYV’s John Dobroth took the
high jump at 6-6, closely followed
by freshman Sam Kipp, at 6-4.
Kipp has cleared 6-8 in practice,
and is a fine prospect to break
Phil Fehlen’s six-year old 6-812
record. Stanford’s Jay Marik
copped fourth at 6-2 with his best
effort.
The three-mile was won by
Stanford’s Paul Schlicke, with a
14:26.5 clocking, excellent for this
early in the season. Card Bob
Miltz also had a creditable 1:53.2
in the half-mile.
THE INDIANS swept the 440,
mile, and weight man’s relays.
The team of Bob Mclntyre, Jack
Scott, Phil Lamoreaux, and Larry
Questad toured one lap in 42.3,
only four-tenths off their best.

All-in-all, it was a satisfying
first performance for Jordan’s
team, which showed that even
early in the season, personal and
team records can be set. A stiffor
test awaits them next Saturday,
when they host Cal and San Jose
State, two formidable track pow
ers, in the Stadium for the Stan
ford Relays.

Cortright (the Stanford record
holder) in the hop-step-jump, his
46-li effort nearly equalling his
previous best.
Art Batchelder of the Youth
Village had the best mark in the
field events. He hurled the jave
lin 247 feet, six inches. This effort
broke his own previous best (the
Stanford record) by almost six
feet. The throw was so prodigious
that the spear stuck only a foot
from the track boundary.
Jerry Winters was the other
Stanford grad to win. His 55-8
heave in the shotput was two feet
past Stanford’s Steve Arch.
IN THE SPRINTS, junior Eric
Frische stole the show. He was
nudged at the wire by the Vil
lage’s Bob Poynfer in the 100, but
his 10 flat time was his fastest
ever. In the 220, he ran away
from everybody except team
mate Jack Scott to win in 21,3,
bettering his previous mark by
half a second.
Freshman John Goode, who
competed in six events, broad
jumped more than a foot better
than his previous best and nearly
beat Dan Moore, who set a Stan
ford record in finishing fourth in
(he NCAA meet last year.
Goode’s 23-7% leap was best until
Moore sailed 23-11 on his fourth
jump.
DAVE WEILL, collegiate dis
cus champion at 191 -7 Va, easily
won for the Indians with a toss of
173-10, his first effort since get
ting out of the hospital.
SCVYV’s John Dobroth took the
high jump at 6-6, closely followed
by freshman Sam Kipp, at 6-4.
Kipp has cleared 6-8 in practice,
and is a fine prospect to break
Phil Fehlen’s six-year old 6-812
record. Stanford’s Jay Marik
copped fourth at 6-2 with his best
effort.
The three-mile was won by
Stanford’s Paul Schlicke, with a
14:26.5 clocking, excellent for this
early in the season. Card Bob
Miltz also had a creditable 1:53.2
in the half-mile.
THE INDIANS swept the 440,
mile, and weight man’s relays.
The team of Bob Mclntyre, Jack
Scott, Phil Lamoreaux, and Larry
Questad toured one lap in 42.3,
only four-tenths off their best.

All-in-all, it was a satisfying
first performance for Jordan’s
team, which showed that even
early in the season, personal and
team records can be set. A stiffor
test awaits them next Saturday,
when they host Cal and San Jose
State, two formidable track pow
ers, in the Stadium for the Stan
ford Relays.

The 1963 track season may plow
a swath through the Stanford
record books, if Saturday’s warm- 1
up meet with the Santa Clara
Valley Youth Village on Angell
Field is any indication.
Since it was the first meet of
the year, the times and distances
as a whole naturally were far
short of spectacular. However,
two Stanford records were set,
and seven trackmen bettered
their all-time best efforts, a heal
thy sign that coach Payton Jor
dan’s protegees could be on their
way to the greatest Stanford
track year since the 1949-51 teams
set six University records and
finished second and third in the
NCAA meet.
THE MEET was not scored, hut
Stanford would have won handily
if it had been. The Indians won
12 of 18 events, with two of
SCVYV’s victories by former
Stanford trackmen. The Stanford
freshmen also competed as a
team and picked up two seconds
and thirds against the stronger
opposition.
The meet started off on a bril
liant note when Harry McCalla,
Stanford two-mile record holder,
ran the 3000-yard steeplechase in
9:01, breaking his own Stanford
record by over 15 seconds. He
would have finished under nine
minutes if he hadn’t stumbled
over a barrier and fallen into the
water hazard. Dripping wet. Mc-
Calla got up quickly and put on
a finishing dash that nearly
made up for his fall.
Steve Cortright was the day’s
big winner. The Indian hurdler
won the 120 highs in 14.6, only
two-tenths off his best, won the
hop, step, and jump with a 46-2Vi*
leap, and easily won the 330-yd.
intermediate hurdles, a new event
this year. His 38-sec. time was
automatically a Stanford record.
SOPHOMORE Phil Arnaudo
ran a close second to Cortright
in the highs, his 14.8 time beating
his previous best. Sheridan
Downey almost upset teammate
Cortright (the Stanford record
holder) in the hop-step-jump, his
46-li effort nearly equalling his
previous best.
Art Batchelder of the Youth
