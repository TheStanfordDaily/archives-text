the weekend.
Barry Carter and Chuck Bis

Barrie Thorne and Edie Brown de
feated Occidental, Los Angeles
State. Santa Barbara, and Loyola,
the eventual tournament winner.
In addition, Miss Thorne won
one of ten awards for outstanding
individual speeches.
Only one team from each school
could qualify for the quarter

were selected. They eventually
dropped a split decision to the San
Fernando team whom the Stan
ford men had defeated previously.
Misses Thorne and Brown were
rated fifth in the tournament, and
the men, though not formally
ranked, w'ere in the top eight.
The teams debated the forma
