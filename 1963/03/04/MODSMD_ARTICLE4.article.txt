JOAN BAEZ, appearing tonight at Memorial Auditorium at 8:30
p.m., rose from rock-and-roll singing at Palo Alto High School to
the forefront of contemporary folk music. After high school she
went to Boston for a short-lived college career, where she soon became a favorite at Boston coffee houses. An appearance at The
Gate of Horn in Chicago catapulted her into national prominence.
Since then she has undoubtedly appeared at more colleges and
universities throughout the country than any other folksinger. This
will be her third concert appearance in the area: she performed at
Palo Alto High School two years ago, and at Memorial Auditorium
last April. Miss Baez has been praised for her "achingly pure
soprano," her resiliant and vigorous presentation, and her depth
and delicacy.
