“Were trying to acquaint the Stanford student body with con
temporary student work in the Bay Area,” said John McPherson,
coordinator of the Stern Hall Art Show in explaining the purposes
of the current exhibit.
The show, made up of about 30 works, includes oils, ink

'washes, and pencil drawings from
the San Francisco Art Institute
and the California College of
Arts and Crafts in Oakland. The
paintings, on display from 1 to 3
p.m. and in the evenings, are in
the dining rooms of Lassen, Lar
kin, and Fremont houses in Stern
Hall. The show will continue un
til the end of the quarter.
“Some of the work may appear
inexplicable and worthless be
cause it has no subject matter,”
said McPherson. “Paintings liked
by some students are disliked by
others, and this controversy in
dicates that there is something
worthwhile in each of the paint
ings.
“These are by no means mas
terpieces," he continued. “But be
cause the paintings are so diverse
in technique, subject matter, and
abstract content, the viewer can
contrast them and thus better
understand the basic elements of
the painting.”
Pointing to an untitled work by
Stephen Cohen, McPherson said
that ‘this one suggests motion
and turmoil in the use of diago
nals as well as in the contrast of
white, red, black, and blue. The
feeling of tension is emphasized
by the spaciousness in the lower
right corner. This highly intellec
tual painting—cold, but powerful
—demands much thought from
the viewer.
“On the other hand,” he con
tinued, pointing to a large can
vas titled “Transfiguration Ritual
Number 3,” “this one has a mood
of gaiety and the color of the
Mardi Gras. It’s expressive and
emotional and, being very rich in
color and form, offers much to
the viewer’s amusement.”
