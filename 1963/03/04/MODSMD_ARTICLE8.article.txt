# Historians Discuss Civil War Politics
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR 
“The prospect of the extension of slavery” was
the “most important concrete factor” in the vic
tory of the “new” Republican Party in 1860. So
concluded Professor Emeritus Glyndon G. Van
Deuscn of the University of Rochester during the
Institute of American History’s Conference on
the Civil War held at Stanford University last
Friday and Saturday.
Van Deusen was among five hundred educa
tors, historians, and students who attended the
conference and participated in four discussions
centered around “The Crisis of the Union 1860-61.”
The subjects for discussion were papers writ
ten by four leading historians on the Civil War.
The papers were “Why the Republican Party
Came to Power" by Van Deusen, “Why (he Demo
cratic Party Divided” by University of Pennsyl
vania Professor Roy F. Nichols, “Why the South
ern States Seceded,” by Professor Avery Craven
of the University of Chicago, and “Why the Re
publican Party Rejected both Compromise and
Secession,” by Professor David M. Potter of Stan
ford.
| Van Deusen, addressing the opening session of
! the two-day conference, granted that the tariff
| issue, internal improvements, and free land all
i contributed to the 1860 Republican victory. “But,”
i he said, “there remains the phenomenon of a sec
tional party that rallied to its ranks hundreds of
thousands of people who believed that slavery
was morally wrong.” This phenomenon exists in
j spite of the fact that “some Republicans were
politicians first and men of principle afterwards.”
Lincoln, Van Deusen proposed, was the ideal
I candidate. He was a westerner, a log-cabin rail
; splitter, a friend of labor “who had publicly ap
i proved the right to strike.” a “moderate” on
j slavery, and “sufficiently in the middle so that
j all sides in the party could rally to him.”
In his commentary on Van Deusen’s paper,
1 Stanford Professor Don E. Fehrenbacher said that

in view of the ‘‘low value ordinarily placed on
party platform,” it is surprising that historians
should attach so much importance to the Repub
lican platform of 1860. Fehrenbacher, an authority
on Lincoln and his party, pointed out that al
though free land was written into the platform,
“two-thirds of the voters in California and Ore
gon remained loyal Democrats.”
He suggested that a turning point in Republican
victory came in the 1858 elections in the key state
of Pennsylvania. Fehrenbacher said the reason
for Pennsylvania’s swing to the new party wasn’t
the Republican tariff, which is most frequently
cited as the cause, but the attempts by Buchanan
“to force admission of Kansas as a slave state.”
Pulitzer prize winner and authority on the
Democratic Party, Nichols related in the second
paper that “the course of Southern leadership
included an unhappy series of unfortunate de
cisions.” When the Democratic convention col
lapsed “a bloc of Southern delegates shattered the
organization deliberately" and “precipitated the
catastrophe that was to follow.”
In his paper “Why the Southern States Seced
ed,” Craven asserted that the South thought it
was fighting abolitionists bent on taking away
eight hundred million dollars worth of property.
Instead, Craven suggested, the South was fighting
“an Age.” Slavery, a “vital factor” in its fragile,
undiversified, plantation economy, “could not:
stand criticism on moral grounds.” Secession,
Craven said, “was an admission of the fact.”
David M. Potter of Stanford suggested in the
fourth paper that the Republicans rejected com
promise “because they could not boar to make
concessions to the fire-eaters and rejected separa
tion because they could not bear to see the union
broken up.”
Potter, an authority on the secession, said that
these attitudes did not mean the Republicans
“chose war.” It may have really meant “that they
chose a course whose consequences were easier to
appraise.”
