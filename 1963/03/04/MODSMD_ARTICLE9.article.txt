# Sohn Finds Four Points Needed for World Unity

### ANN TODD 
“The four basic ingredients of world organization are com
plete disarmament, a United Nations peace force strong enough to
be opposed by no one, adequate arrangement for settlement of
international disputes, and the solving of basic economic differ
ences for the betterment of all mankind,” stated Lewis B. Sohn,
professor in the Harvard Law, jl- jl jl.

School and expert on world or
ganization, in an address Friday
night to the General Assembly of
the Stanford United Nations.
Nuclear disarmament and the

effectiveness of a peace machin
ery must be proportional, he
staled. As disarmament increases,
adequate organization must be
available to insure international
peace. Disarmament by itself
cannot insure peace, for police
forces could be substituted for
missiles, or, in case of partial
disarmament, a nation could
easily rebuild its nuclear force.
So.hn went on to point out prob
lems connected with the develop
ment of an international peace
organization. Such an organiza
tion. to prove effective, must be
backed up by a police force.
There is a danger that such a
force could promote world tyran
ny: countries could prevent this
by allowing only a limited force
from each nation.
For the solution of internation
al disputes, Sohn suggested that
an international tribunal be es
tablished, which would solve
cases not with respect to law but
with respect to what is reason
able. He cited the dispute over
Goa as an example. The tribunal
could call a plebescite, allowing
the people of Goa to choose Por
tuguese or Indian rule; compensa
tion would be made to Portugal
if tlie territory should be lost to
India.
Lastly, Sohn insisted on the
importance of settling economic
differences between countries for
the insurance of world peace.
“Economic problems cause war
and could force rearmament even
if disarmament were once
achieved.” Such problems, con
tinued Sohn, cannot be solved
within our generation, but “At
least we can give hope; men can
live for awhile on this.”
Although we must attack the
problems standing in the way of
world government on a large
scale, we cannot suddenly thrust
world government on mankind
and expect it to be effective. Sohn
suggested that perhaps govern
ments on a regional basis could
be established first, one for Afri
ca, one for Asia.
Bringing the S.U.N. General
Assembly to an official close
Saturday, Sohn elaborated on his
discussion on disarmament. “Pre
cautions,” he said, “are not fool
proof, and there are many fools
in the world.”
In ending, he said, “Don’t
think the peace race will be won
by 100-yard dashes. Get ready
for a long, grueling race—more
like a 50-mile hike.”
