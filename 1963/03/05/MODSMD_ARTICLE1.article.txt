# Opinions Vary at NSA Conference on Proposed Domestic Peace Corps

### KEN TITTLE 
Stanford Delegate, NSA Conference on Hie
Proposed National Service Program
Thirty-two to forty million Americans live
in conditions of poverty in the United States
today, and 6,200.000 rural families have in
comes under $2,700 per year, President Ken
nedy was told by his Study Group on National
Valuntcer Services this January.
The study group, chaired by Attorney Gen
eral Bobby Kennedy since early last fall, cited
several more statistics of deprivation in “pro
perous” America, then outlined in broad gen
eral terms a proposal for a national service
corps ( a “Domestic Peace Corps” as It is
widely known) to meet some of these needs
and stimulate volunteer activity in all serv
ice areas.
AT THE NATIONAL Student Association
(USNSA) conference on the proposal In Wash
ington. D.C., this weekend it was evident that
while the facts tended to be impressive, there
was loss than general acceptance of the study
group’s proposals to meet the problems.
Essentially the administration proposal
was for an “exemplary,” “catalytic” group, to
reach a maximum strength of 5,000 volunteers

in three years. Mr. Richard Boone of the pres
idential “task force" sketched the principles
on which this limited proposal was based.
The service corps would attack areas of the
most critical need he said, and only where the
corps volunteer would have a distinctive con
tribution to make to a locally formulated
project. The corps would enter a project only
at the invitation of a local agency, either pub
lic or private. It would work only through
existing agencies and would not conduct its
own projects.

A basic aspect of the volunteer’s work
would be accomplishing his own eventual with
drawal from the project, preferably in one
to three years. Boone suggested that such a
planned “phasing-out” might be accomplished
by establishing programs where part-time lo
cal volunteers assumed the service responsi
bilities, by instituting workable self-help pro
grams, or by a community decision that
services rendered by the volunteer had been
valuable enough to warrant hiring workers
to continue them; but emphasized that some
"phasing-out” plan was a necessary local obli
gation.

Further, Boone asserted that poverty and
deprivation in the United States are fast be-

coming “invisible,” and that a fundamental
purpose of a “national service corps” must
be to dramatize “invisible needs,” thus spur
ring service on a private and local level.
CONSERVATIVE opposition to the propos
al at the conference was presented by Con
gressman Finley (R-Ill.) and spearheaded in
the plenary discussions by Robert E. Bauman,
national chairman of the Young Americans
for Freedom. Finley charged that such a corps
of non-professionals would be one more bu
reau in a “plethora” of bureaucratic agencies
and federal programs presently attempting to
meet the same problems. Citing the study
group estimate of 20 million volunteer work
ers in social service in the U.S. today, Finley
said that the corps would only be duplicating
existing public and private efforts. Rather
than visualizing the corps as stimulating a
new rise of volunteer efforts, both Bauman
and Finley argued that the proposal would
undercut the whole principle of personal in
itiative and local responsibility in social wel
fare.

An alternate to the conference resolutions,
introduced by Bauman and heavily defeated
in the plenary, advocated the abandonment
of the national service corps idea in favor of

federal stimulation of private action by re
tention and expansion of tax deductions for
charitable contributions, and by granting draft
deferment to young people engaged in social
welfare work for private, religious, or com
munity agencies.

While some delegates opposed the prin
ciple of the corps, others criticized the scope
of the proposals. They argued that requiring
local invitation and a great deal of local con
trol for a project would limit or destroy the
program in areas of the Deep South where
local interests did not seem to be concerned
with some of the most critical needs. They
also argued that emphasis on dramatization
of need with a small corps of 5,000 volunteers
would prove inadequate for meeting the prob
lems of wide-spread deprivation, and they sup
ported a corps of unlimited upper size with
less publicity.

THE GENERAL AREAS which the study
group proposal dealt with are the problems of
(1) migrant labor, (2) American Indians, (3)
the mentally ill and the mentally retarded.
(4) basic community development, and (5)
basic education in rural and urban depressed
areas.

Although it was not clear in what ways

volunteers would be used, the Peace Corps
success seems to have made problems of selec
tion and terms of service much simpler. The
major difference between the international
and “domestic” corps proposals here is that
domestic volunteers would probably serve
only one year including training, and they
could then be reappointed for a second year.
While no legislation with administrative
saction has yet been drafted, medical pro
visions would probably be less rigorous and
the training would be slightly shorter, from
four to six weeks. Minimum age would be 18,
with no maximum age and selection would
follwo the Peace Corps formula of tests, ex
tensive recommendations, and in-training
screenings. “Pay” would be a living allowance,
transportation and medical costs, and a ter
mination allowance of $73 for each month
served, and military deferment but not ex
emption would be granted volunteers.
Despite criticism the group continues its
work from its Washington office and expects
to see legislation introduced in April. Boone
of the study group told the conference that if
enabling legislation is passed this spring, the
group felt that assignment and training of
the first volunteers could begin by next fall.

group proposal dealt with are the problems of
(1) migrant labor, (2) American Indians, (3)
the mentally ill and the mentally retarded.
(4) basic community development, and (5)
basic education in rural and urban depressed
areas.

Although it was not clear in what ways

volunteers would be used, the Peace Corps
success seems to have made problems of selec
tion and terms of service much simpler. The
major difference between the international
and “domestic” corps proposals here is that
domestic volunteers would probably serve
only one year including training, and they
could then be reappointed for a second year.
While no legislation with administrative
saction has yet been drafted, medical pro
visions would probably be less rigorous and
the training would be slightly shorter, from
four to six weeks. Minimum age would be 18,
with no maximum age and selection would
follwo the Peace Corps formula of tests, ex
tensive recommendations, and in-training
screenings. “Pay” would be a living allowance,
transportation and medical costs, and a ter
mination allowance of $73 for each month
served, and military deferment but not ex
emption would be granted volunteers.
Despite criticism the group continues its
work from its Washington office and expects
to see legislation introduced in April. Boone
of the study group told the conference that if
enabling legislation is passed this spring, the
group felt that assignment and training of
the first volunteers could begin by next fall.
Stanford Delegate, NSA Conference on Hie
Proposed National Service Program
Thirty-two to forty million Americans live
in conditions of poverty in the United States
today, and 6,200.000 rural families have in
comes under $2,700 per year, President Ken
nedy was told by his Study Group on National
Valuntcer Services this January.
The study group, chaired by Attorney Gen
eral Bobby Kennedy since early last fall, cited
several more statistics of deprivation in “pro
perous” America, then outlined in broad gen
eral terms a proposal for a national service
corps ( a “Domestic Peace Corps” as It is
widely known) to meet some of these needs
and stimulate volunteer activity in all serv
ice areas.
AT THE NATIONAL Student Association
(USNSA) conference on the proposal In Wash
ington. D.C., this weekend it was evident that
while the facts tended to be impressive, there
was loss than general acceptance of the study
group’s proposals to meet the problems.
Essentially the administration proposal
was for an “exemplary,” “catalytic” group, to
reach a maximum strength of 5,000 volunteers

in three years. Mr. Richard Boone of the pres
idential “task force" sketched the principles
on which this limited proposal was based.
The service corps would attack areas of the
most critical need he said, and only where the
corps volunteer would have a distinctive con
tribution to make to a locally formulated
project. The corps would enter a project only
at the invitation of a local agency, either pub
lic or private. It would work only through
existing agencies and would not conduct its
own projects.

A basic aspect of the volunteer’s work
would be accomplishing his own eventual with
drawal from the project, preferably in one
to three years. Boone suggested that such a
planned “phasing-out” might be accomplished
by establishing programs where part-time lo
cal volunteers assumed the service responsi
bilities, by instituting workable self-help pro
grams, or by a community decision that
services rendered by the volunteer had been
valuable enough to warrant hiring workers
to continue them; but emphasized that some
"phasing-out” plan was a necessary local obli
gation.

Further, Boone asserted that poverty and
deprivation in the United States are fast be-

coming “invisible,” and that a fundamental
purpose of a “national service corps” must
be to dramatize “invisible needs,” thus spur
ring service on a private and local level.
CONSERVATIVE opposition to the propos
al at the conference was presented by Con
gressman Finley (R-Ill.) and spearheaded in
the plenary discussions by Robert E. Bauman,
national chairman of the Young Americans
for Freedom. Finley charged that such a corps
of non-professionals would be one more bu
reau in a “plethora” of bureaucratic agencies
and federal programs presently attempting to
meet the same problems. Citing the study
group estimate of 20 million volunteer work
ers in social service in the U.S. today, Finley
said that the corps would only be duplicating
existing public and private efforts. Rather
than visualizing the corps as stimulating a
new rise of volunteer efforts, both Bauman
and Finley argued that the proposal would
undercut the whole principle of personal in
itiative and local responsibility in social wel
fare.

An alternate to the conference resolutions,
introduced by Bauman and heavily defeated
in the plenary, advocated the abandonment
of the national service corps idea in favor of

federal stimulation of private action by re
tention and expansion of tax deductions for
charitable contributions, and by granting draft
deferment to young people engaged in social
welfare work for private, religious, or com
munity agencies.

While some delegates opposed the prin
ciple of the corps, others criticized the scope
of the proposals. They argued that requiring
local invitation and a great deal of local con
trol for a project would limit or destroy the
program in areas of the Deep South where
local interests did not seem to be concerned
with some of the most critical needs. They
also argued that emphasis on dramatization
of need with a small corps of 5,000 volunteers
would prove inadequate for meeting the prob
lems of wide-spread deprivation, and they sup
ported a corps of unlimited upper size with
less publicity.

group estimate of 20 million volunteer work
ers in social service in the U.S. today, Finley
said that the corps would only be duplicating
existing public and private efforts. Rather
than visualizing the corps as stimulating a
new rise of volunteer efforts, both Bauman
and Finley argued that the proposal would
undercut the whole principle of personal in
itiative and local responsibility in social wel
fare.

An alternate to the conference resolutions,
introduced by Bauman and heavily defeated
in the plenary, advocated the abandonment
of the national service corps idea in favor of

federal stimulation of private action by re
tention and expansion of tax deductions for
charitable contributions, and by granting draft
deferment to young people engaged in social
welfare work for private, religious, or com
munity agencies.

While some delegates opposed the prin
ciple of the corps, others criticized the scope
of the proposals. They argued that requiring
local invitation and a great deal of local con
trol for a project would limit or destroy the
program in areas of the Deep South where
local interests did not seem to be concerned
with some of the most critical needs. They
also argued that emphasis on dramatization
of need with a small corps of 5,000 volunteers
would prove inadequate for meeting the prob
lems of wide-spread deprivation, and they sup
ported a corps of unlimited upper size with
less publicity.

THE GENERAL AREAS which the study
group proposal dealt with are the problems of
(1) migrant labor, (2) American Indians, (3)
the mentally ill and the mentally retarded.
(4) basic community development, and (5)
basic education in rural and urban depressed
areas.

Although it was not clear in what ways

volunteers would be used, the Peace Corps
success seems to have made problems of selec
tion and terms of service much simpler. The
major difference between the international
and “domestic” corps proposals here is that
domestic volunteers would probably serve
only one year including training, and they
could then be reappointed for a second year.
While no legislation with administrative
saction has yet been drafted, medical pro
visions would probably be less rigorous and
the training would be slightly shorter, from
four to six weeks. Minimum age would be 18,
with no maximum age and selection would
follwo the Peace Corps formula of tests, ex
tensive recommendations, and in-training
screenings. “Pay” would be a living allowance,
transportation and medical costs, and a ter
mination allowance of $73 for each month
served, and military deferment but not ex
emption would be granted volunteers.
Despite criticism the group continues its
work from its Washington office and expects
to see legislation introduced in April. Boone
of the study group told the conference that if
enabling legislation is passed this spring, the
group felt that assignment and training of
the first volunteers could begin by next fall.
Stanford Delegate, NSA Conference on Hie
Proposed National Service Program
Thirty-two to forty million Americans live
in conditions of poverty in the United States
today, and 6,200.000 rural families have in
comes under $2,700 per year, President Ken
nedy was told by his Study Group on National
Valuntcer Services this January.
The study group, chaired by Attorney Gen
eral Bobby Kennedy since early last fall, cited
several more statistics of deprivation in “pro
perous” America, then outlined in broad gen
eral terms a proposal for a national service
corps ( a “Domestic Peace Corps” as It is
widely known) to meet some of these needs
and stimulate volunteer activity in all serv
ice areas.
AT THE NATIONAL Student Association
(USNSA) conference on the proposal In Wash
ington. D.C., this weekend it was evident that
while the facts tended to be impressive, there
was loss than general acceptance of the study
group’s proposals to meet the problems.
Essentially the administration proposal
was for an “exemplary,” “catalytic” group, to
reach a maximum strength of 5,000 volunteers

in three years. Mr. Richard Boone of the pres
idential “task force" sketched the principles
on which this limited proposal was based.
The service corps would attack areas of the
most critical need he said, and only where the
corps volunteer would have a distinctive con
tribution to make to a locally formulated
project. The corps would enter a project only
at the invitation of a local agency, either pub
lic or private. It would work only through
existing agencies and would not conduct its
own projects.

A basic aspect of the volunteer’s work
would be accomplishing his own eventual with
drawal from the project, preferably in one
to three years. Boone suggested that such a
planned “phasing-out” might be accomplished
by establishing programs where part-time lo
cal volunteers assumed the service responsi
bilities, by instituting workable self-help pro
grams, or by a community decision that
services rendered by the volunteer had been
valuable enough to warrant hiring workers
to continue them; but emphasized that some
"phasing-out” plan was a necessary local obli
gation.

Further, Boone asserted that poverty and
deprivation in the United States are fast be-

coming “invisible,” and that a fundamental
purpose of a “national service corps” must
be to dramatize “invisible needs,” thus spur
ring service on a private and local level.
CONSERVATIVE opposition to the propos
al at the conference was presented by Con
gressman Finley (R-Ill.) and spearheaded in
the plenary discussions by Robert E. Bauman,
national chairman of the Young Americans
for Freedom. Finley charged that such a corps
of non-professionals would be one more bu
reau in a “plethora” of bureaucratic agencies
and federal programs presently attempting to
meet the same problems. Citing the study
