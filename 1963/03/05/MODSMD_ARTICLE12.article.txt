# STAFF OPINION
## "Chubby" and "The Limbo" 
### STEVEN ZOUSMER Contributing Editor 
Twist-king, limbo-king Chubby Checker and a raving team
of lesser screamers invaded the Cow Palaee Saturday night and
gave a crowd of more than 15,000 young fanatics all they had
paid for. The twenty-five act procession of the nation’s foremost
unknown teenage musical idols wore on for four hours, and it
is a matter for speculation whether some of the more sophisti
cated young fans present would have paid extra for a little less
entertainment. Or a little less noise.
This was Chubby Checker’s “Limbo Party,” the sequel to
last year’s Chubby Checker’s “Twist Party.” Both of these very
lucrative events have featured music for long hairs with plenty
of greasy kid’s stuff, and plenty greasy kids. I greased up for
it myself and sat through bumper-to-bumper traffic outside the
Cow Palace eager to witness in person such stars as Marvin
Gaye, Little E., The Ribbons, and, of course, Steve Alaimo.
The show began with some words of caution by Tom “Big
Daddy” Donahue, a fat KYA disc jockey. He told the screeching
crowd that when the music moved them to dance they could
dance as much as they pleased, although it would have to be
done sitting down. If anyone started gyrating in the aisles, he
said, he would waddle down from the stage and personally fall
on them. This was enough to keep the audience fairly orderly,
which was a disappointment to those of us who recalled the
“Twist Party” last year in which there was constant rioting and
a couple good stabbings.
Then the acts started. There were several boys who sang
like girls and several girls who sang like boys singing like girls.
Several quartets bounced around and stripped off their suit
coats and ties and threw the microphone around, did flips and
finally carried each other off. There was some comic relief too;
“Hope you’re having a good time tonight—we aren’t,” cracked
Paul of the act of Paul and Paula (who sang “Hey, Paula”).
Nobody quite fathomed the wit of that remark and Paul blushed
as crimson as his red tuxedo. The outstanding humor was the
Furies, a group of four Negroes who came on stage and leaped
around for five minutes without singing a single note. After
that they all lined up at the microphone and yelled for half a
minute. Then they introduced a song titled “I’ve Got Tears in
My Eyes Because the Girl I’m Dancing with Is a Boy,” instead
sang “Up on the Roof,” which is a good place for them to sing.
The Alley Cats and The Rivingtons did the same act, not to
mention the high-flying Olympics. The audience hollered for
more.
The very fundamental and animalistic nature of this kind
of enterntainment was perhaps best reflected in the names of
some of the dance crazes the singers plugged: the Fly, the Pony,
the Bug, and the Bird (“We’re gonna bird for you,” said the
leader of one group, and the audience stood up and tried to bird
along). Then there were dances reflecting more upon modern
civilization: the Mashed Potato, the Limbo, and the Exercise.
The Exercise is the newest of the lot. Bobby Freeman, its in
ventor, gave a demonstration and asked the crowd to follow
along. “Here’s an exercise for the thumb,” he shouted, and the
audience mimicked his hitch-hiking motion. “Here’s an exercise
for the hips, it’s a gas,” he said, and everybody stood up and
shook their hips. “Here's an exercise for the armpits,” he said.
It was hardly necessary.
The show was as basic as toilet training and by the looks of
the audience it was about time. The zoo-parade of spectators
provided as much variety as the entertainers. A high school girl
lost her glasses and flung away lit cigarettes in rapt frenzy.
A blue-jeaned youth in a pink jersey brought his tape recorder
and sang into it himself while the paid performers wailed on the
stage below. Ten year-olds puffed on cigarillos. A very cute
little Negro girl waved her arms and wiggled around frantically
for the first few acts before falling asleep on her mother’s lap.
And no one seemed to fit in more than the girl sitting next
to me. Her blond hair was ratted and frizzly, a gold medallion
with the initial “L” (for Lolita, I think) hung over her bright
colored sweater which went nicely with white lipstick, her skirt
was so short she had to hold a coat in her lap, and the eyebrow
pencilling started at her ears. She was, of course, my date; a
Dean’s List Stanford Lovely and the proof that The Farm’s
daughters can be earthy if they put their hearts in it. I had told
her beforehand that I wouldn’t take her along if she planned to
embarrass me by dressing tastefully and snooty. And what could
she say to that?
Somehow though her enthusiasm wore off. After about
twenty acts she said, “I wanna go home.” “Whatsamatta wif
you?” I said, “You’ll miss five great acts.” “All these acts are
the same anyway,” she said. “Well maybe they’re all the same,”
I replied, “But they’re all just as bad. And we can’t miss Chub
by’s limbo lessons.” “I can miss Chubby’s limbo lessions,” she
said. What could I say to that?
We left without limbo lessons but stayed long enough for a
glimpse of Chubby, the twenty-one-year-old former chicken
plucker from Philadelphia. Fat Donahue introduced him: “Here
he is, CHUBBY CHECKER.” Applause and screams but no
Chubby. “Here he is, he’s coming now. CHUBBY CHECKER.”
Finally Chubby realized he was on and bounced in from the
wings in a wild orange shirt. “Get me out of here,” said the
Stanford lovely, and we got up and ran through the twisting
masses to the exit, then to the parking lot and into the car with
a sigh of relief. On the way out of the parking lot I cracked up
my car.
