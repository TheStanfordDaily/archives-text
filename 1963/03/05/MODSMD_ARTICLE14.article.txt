Editors, The Dally:
The seniors who expressed their disappointment in the
Senior Colloqnia to he offered in the spring seem not yet to have
learned that one should investigate a subject prior to displaying
one’s ignorance of it in an arrogant manner.
I am referring to the remark “‘Man and Society in Doder
er’s Novel’ (who?).” If, instead of blowing off steam, these stu
dents (some of whom ought, to know belter) had taken the
time to look up at least critical reaction to Doderer’s novel “The
Demons,” they would have found the following;
“When this book appeared ... it was instantly hailed as
the greatest Austrian novel of the century . . . The vast array
of characters are introduced, reintroduced, labeled and com
mented upon until they become more easily recognizable than
one's neighbors. Narrative skill of a very high order makes the
book consistently engrossing.” (N.Y. Tribune Books, p. 4, S 24,
’GI)
“Last, not least, among Doderer’s troublesome talents, is
his eye for social detail. . . . All this huge, finely meshed novel
istic apparatus has been geared to produce insinuation rather
than declaration. . . . The novel, expertly modern in its drama
turgy, achieves a stunningly old-fashioned climax. It restores
moral grandeur to what, so many contemporary writers have
interpreted as man’s mean and mangy condition. Not only the
brilliance of his technique, but his moral responsiveness to his
material makes (Doderer) the foremost novelist, writing in
German today.” (N.Y. Times Book Review, p. 4, S 24 ’6l)
Doderer has frequently been compared to Proust and, with
Uwe Johnson and Gunter Grass (who are they?) represents the
astonishing revival of the modern German novel that has been
admired everywhere in Europe. I proposed last year that we
invite Doderer to lecture at Stanford and I hope that an invita
tion will bo extended to this great novelist.
If our seniors do not find Doderer interesting enough (An
thony West, in the “New Yorker” review, calls him “the spokes
man for the ideology of the extreme Right”—a fine subject for
controversy), I would consider it a rare privilege just to be per
mitted to listen to Professor Burkhardt’s colloquium.

Editors, The Daily:
As participants in the S.U.N., we wonder if delegates to the
real UN often feel as wo did after our first session—disappoint
ed, questioning if such a body could ever come up with any
constructive action. It seemed that most of the S.U.N. sessions
were taken up with debate over procedure and remarkably little
time was spent in discussion of the basic issues. This was partly
due to the nature of the resolutions presented. For example, two
of the proposals on world government consisted of long constitu
tions for a future world federation. They were so loaded with
details that they obscured the fundamental issues such as, how
will disarmament proceed; what kind of economic integration
will be most workable; how will the constitution be enforced.
The subject of world government is immensely complex, and if
we are to discuss it in a meaningful way, it is necessary to begin
with the most basic problems. If resolutions were limited to one
or two fundamental proposals, then one could hope for good
debate on clearly defined issues.
It seems also that resolutions should offer some change in
the status quo; a proposal which suggests turning the issue
of a world constitution to an international law commission may
get passed because it merely shifts the responsibility to another
body, it does not really pose a significant question for debate.
We hope that the next session can build on this experience
and make the S.U.N. a more constructive body.

The HR is grateful to The Daily for its excellent coverage
of the Stanford United Nations, without which the initial suc
cess of the program would have been hampered. We especially
appreciate both the intelligent criticism and the welcome encour
agement of the S.U.N. We agree, of course, that much improve
ment will be necessary in the future; indeed, it would be surpris
ing if it were otherwise with such an entirely new program.
Considering the proliferation of organizations at Stanford, how
ever, to start a program with such great potential value as the
S.U.N. literally from scratch is a commendable achievement. Such
people as Maynard Toll, Lawrence de Bivort, Judy Sterling,
Mikey Upson, Keith Lesar, Jim Bischoff, Bill Quandt, and many
others deserve special commendation for the tremendous effort
begun in the first week of Autumn Quarter to plan and organize
the first session of the S.U.N., a program uniqueamong American
universities.
As the editorial in yesterday’s Daily pointed out, a number
of mistakes were made which can be avoided in the future; these
are the inevitable “growing pains” of a large organization. With
the experience gained at the first session of the S.U.N., and with
the cooperation of the delegates to this session in evaluating the
relative strengths and weaknesses of the program, we are con
fident that the S.U.N. can indeed become a tradition of which
Stanford can be proud.

felt that the decision of the General Assembly to vote on the
Honduras resolution concerning the ‘Berlin Wall’ without first
debating the issue was a violation of the true spirit of the
United Nations.
Further, we feel that the large number of abstentions
recorded when a re-vote was taken on (his issue shows that many
delegates had reversed their previous hasty stand and were now
reluctant to vote on an issue that had not been debated.
Finally, we regard it as unfortunate that the S.U.N. is record

Coming from a strong Harvard background, where the boys
must wear coats and ties to meals, I had a reassuring experience
in Roble yesterday. Seated comfortably with my date on the
long-awaited furniture in the Roble lounge w’e were politely
informed that slacks and shorts are prohibited in the main
room. The woman told us sweetly that it was in the “blue book”
but it rather reminded me of my home state blue laws. If this
type of incident becomes a trend, I am sure that Stanford can
stamp out western informality and become the Harvard of
the West.

El Campo Eating Club has added its voice to those of other
student groups which urge the Board of Trustees to review at
their March meeting the roles of student and administrative
bodies in expressing opinions on public issues. We feel that the
volume of student concern over this issue warrants a statement
by the Board clarifying University position toward such expres
sion. We invite those student groups which have not yet spoken
on the issue to join us in this request.

of a world constitution to an international law commission may
get passed because it merely shifts the responsibility to another
body, it does not really pose a significant question for debate.
We hope that the next session can build on this experience
and make the S.U.N. a more constructive body.

The HR is grateful to The Daily for its excellent coverage
of the Stanford United Nations, without which the initial suc
cess of the program would have been hampered. We especially
appreciate both the intelligent criticism and the welcome encour
agement of the S.U.N. We agree, of course, that much improve
ment will be necessary in the future; indeed, it would be surpris
ing if it were otherwise with such an entirely new program.
Considering the proliferation of organizations at Stanford, how
ever, to start a program with such great potential value as the
S.U.N. literally from scratch is a commendable achievement. Such
people as Maynard Toll, Lawrence de Bivort, Judy Sterling,
Mikey Upson, Keith Lesar, Jim Bischoff, Bill Quandt, and many
others deserve special commendation for the tremendous effort
begun in the first week of Autumn Quarter to plan and organize
the first session of the S.U.N., a program uniqueamong American
universities.
As the editorial in yesterday’s Daily pointed out, a number
of mistakes were made which can be avoided in the future; these
are the inevitable “growing pains” of a large organization. With
the experience gained at the first session of the S.U.N., and with
the cooperation of the delegates to this session in evaluating the
relative strengths and weaknesses of the program, we are con
fident that the S.U.N. can indeed become a tradition of which
Stanford can be proud.

Coming from a strong Harvard background, where the boys
must wear coats and ties to meals, I had a reassuring experience
in Roble yesterday. Seated comfortably with my date on the
long-awaited furniture in the Roble lounge w’e were politely
informed that slacks and shorts are prohibited in the main
room. The woman told us sweetly that it was in the “blue book”
but it rather reminded me of my home state blue laws. If this
type of incident becomes a trend, I am sure that Stanford can
stamp out western informality and become the Harvard of
the West.

El Campo Eating Club has added its voice to those of other
student groups which urge the Board of Trustees to review at
their March meeting the roles of student and administrative
bodies in expressing opinions on public issues. We feel that the
volume of student concern over this issue warrants a statement
by the Board clarifying University position toward such expres

on the issue to join us in this request.

Editors, The Dally:
The seniors who expressed their disappointment in the
Senior Colloqnia to he offered in the spring seem not yet to have
learned that one should investigate a subject prior to displaying
one’s ignorance of it in an arrogant manner.
I am referring to the remark “‘Man and Society in Doder
er’s Novel’ (who?).” If, instead of blowing off steam, these stu
dents (some of whom ought, to know belter) had taken the
time to look up at least critical reaction to Doderer’s novel “The
Demons,” they would have found the following;
“When this book appeared ... it was instantly hailed as
the greatest Austrian novel of the century . . . The vast array
of characters are introduced, reintroduced, labeled and com
mented upon until they become more easily recognizable than
one's neighbors. Narrative skill of a very high order makes the
book consistently engrossing.” (N.Y. Tribune Books, p. 4, S 24,
’GI)
“Last, not least, among Doderer’s troublesome talents, is
his eye for social detail. . . . All this huge, finely meshed novel
istic apparatus has been geared to produce insinuation rather
than declaration. . . . The novel, expertly modern in its drama
turgy, achieves a stunningly old-fashioned climax. It restores
moral grandeur to what, so many contemporary writers have
interpreted as man’s mean and mangy condition. Not only the
brilliance of his technique, but his moral responsiveness to his
material makes (Doderer) the foremost novelist, writing in
German today.” (N.Y. Times Book Review, p. 4, S 24 ’6l)
Doderer has frequently been compared to Proust and, with
Uwe Johnson and Gunter Grass (who are they?) represents the
astonishing revival of the modern German novel that has been
admired everywhere in Europe. I proposed last year that we
invite Doderer to lecture at Stanford and I hope that an invita
tion will bo extended to this great novelist.
If our seniors do not find Doderer interesting enough (An
thony West, in the “New Yorker” review, calls him “the spokes
man for the ideology of the extreme Right”—a fine subject for
controversy), I would consider it a rare privilege just to be per
mitted to listen to Professor Burkhardt’s colloquium.

As participants in the S.U.N., we wonder if delegates to the
real UN often feel as wo did after our first session—disappoint
ed, questioning if such a body could ever come up with any
constructive action. It seemed that most of the S.U.N. sessions
were taken up with debate over procedure and remarkably little
time was spent in discussion of the basic issues. This was partly
due to the nature of the resolutions presented. For example, two
of the proposals on world government consisted of long constitu
tions for a future world federation. They were so loaded with
details that they obscured the fundamental issues such as, how
will disarmament proceed; what kind of economic integration
will be most workable; how will the constitution be enforced.
The subject of world government is immensely complex, and if
we are to discuss it in a meaningful way, it is necessary to begin
with the most basic problems. If resolutions were limited to one
or two fundamental proposals, then one could hope for good
debate on clearly defined issues.
It seems also that resolutions should offer some change in
the status quo; a proposal which suggests turning the issue
of a world constitution to an international law commission may
get passed because it merely shifts the responsibility to another
body, it does not really pose a significant question for debate.

student groups which urge the Board of Trustees to review at
their March meeting the roles of student and administrative

volume of student concern over this issue warrants a statement

Editors, The Dally:
The seniors who expressed their disappointment in the
Senior Colloqnia to he offered in the spring seem not yet to have
learned that one should investigate a subject prior to displaying
one’s ignorance of it in an arrogant manner.
I am referring to the remark “‘Man and Society in Doder
er’s Novel’ (who?).” If, instead of blowing off steam, these stu
dents (some of whom ought, to know belter) had taken the
time to look up at least critical reaction to Doderer’s novel “The
Demons,” they would have found the following;
“When this book appeared ... it was instantly hailed as
the greatest Austrian novel of the century . . . The vast array
of characters are introduced, reintroduced, labeled and com
mented upon until they become more easily recognizable than
one's neighbors. Narrative skill of a very high order makes the
book consistently engrossing.” (N.Y. Tribune Books, p. 4, S 24,
’GI)
“Last, not least, among Doderer’s troublesome talents, is
his eye for social detail. . . . All this huge, finely meshed novel
istic apparatus has been geared to produce insinuation rather
than declaration. . . . The novel, expertly modern in its drama
turgy, achieves a stunningly old-fashioned climax. It restores
moral grandeur to what, so many contemporary writers have
interpreted as man’s mean and mangy condition. Not only the
brilliance of his technique, but his moral responsiveness to his
material makes (Doderer) the foremost novelist, writing in
German today.” (N.Y. Times Book Review, p. 4, S 24 ’6l)
Doderer has frequently been compared to Proust and, with
Uwe Johnson and Gunter Grass (who are they?) represents the
astonishing revival of the modern German novel that has been
admired everywhere in Europe. I proposed last year that we
invite Doderer to lecture at Stanford and I hope that an invita
tion will bo extended to this great novelist.
If our seniors do not find Doderer interesting enough (An
thony West, in the “New Yorker” review, calls him “the spokes
man for the ideology of the extreme Right”—a fine subject for
controversy), I would consider it a rare privilege just to be per
mitted to listen to Professor Burkhardt’s colloquium.

As participants in the S.U.N., we wonder if delegates to the
real UN often feel as wo did after our first session—disappoint
ed, questioning if such a body could ever come up with any
constructive action. It seemed that most of the S.U.N. sessions
were taken up with debate over procedure and remarkably little
time was spent in discussion of the basic issues. This was partly
due to the nature of the resolutions presented. For example, two
of the proposals on world government consisted of long constitu
tions for a future world federation. They were so loaded with
details that they obscured the fundamental issues such as, how
will disarmament proceed; what kind of economic integration
will be most workable; how will the constitution be enforced.
The subject of world government is immensely complex, and if
we are to discuss it in a meaningful way, it is necessary to begin
with the most basic problems. If resolutions were limited to one
or two fundamental proposals, then one could hope for good
debate on clearly defined issues.
It seems also that resolutions should offer some change in
the status quo; a proposal which suggests turning the issue
of a world constitution to an international law commission may
get passed because it merely shifts the responsibility to another
body, it does not really pose a significant question for debate.
We hope that the next session can build on this experience
and make the S.U.N. a more constructive body.

The HR is grateful to The Daily for its excellent coverage
of the Stanford United Nations, without which the initial suc
cess of the program would have been hampered. We especially
appreciate both the intelligent criticism and the welcome encour
agement of the S.U.N. We agree, of course, that much improve
ment will be necessary in the future; indeed, it would be surpris
ing if it were otherwise with such an entirely new program.
Considering the proliferation of organizations at Stanford, how
ever, to start a program with such great potential value as the
S.U.N. literally from scratch is a commendable achievement. Such
people as Maynard Toll, Lawrence de Bivort, Judy Sterling,
Mikey Upson, Keith Lesar, Jim Bischoff, Bill Quandt, and many
others deserve special commendation for the tremendous effort
begun in the first week of Autumn Quarter to plan and organize
the first session of the S.U.N., a program uniqueamong American
universities.
As the editorial in yesterday’s Daily pointed out, a number
of mistakes were made which can be avoided in the future; these
are the inevitable “growing pains” of a large organization. With
the experience gained at the first session of the S.U.N., and with
the cooperation of the delegates to this session in evaluating the
relative strengths and weaknesses of the program, we are con
fident that the S.U.N. can indeed become a tradition of which
Stanford can be proud.

Coming from a strong Harvard background, where the boys
must wear coats and ties to meals, I had a reassuring experience
in Roble yesterday. Seated comfortably with my date on the
long-awaited furniture in the Roble lounge w’e were politely
informed that slacks and shorts are prohibited in the main
room. The woman told us sweetly that it was in the “blue book”
but it rather reminded me of my home state blue laws. If this

tions for a future world federation. They were so loaded with
details that they obscured the fundamental issues such as, how
will disarmament proceed; what kind of economic integration
will be most workable; how will the constitution be enforced.
The subject of world government is immensely complex, and if
we are to discuss it in a meaningful way, it is necessary to begin
with the most basic problems. If resolutions were limited to one
or two fundamental proposals, then one could hope for good
debate on clearly defined issues.
It seems also that resolutions should offer some change in
the status quo; a proposal which suggests turning the issue
of a world constitution to an international law commission may
get passed because it merely shifts the responsibility to another
body, it does not really pose a significant question for debate.
We hope that the next session can build on this experience
and make the S.U.N. a more constructive body.

The HR is grateful to The Daily for its excellent coverage
of the Stanford United Nations, without which the initial suc
cess of the program would have been hampered. We especially
appreciate both the intelligent criticism and the welcome encour
agement of the S.U.N. We agree, of course, that much improve
ment will be necessary in the future; indeed, it would be surpris
ing if it were otherwise with such an entirely new program.
Considering the proliferation of organizations at Stanford, how
ever, to start a program with such great potential value as the
S.U.N. literally from scratch is a commendable achievement. Such
people as Maynard Toll, Lawrence de Bivort, Judy Sterling,
Mikey Upson, Keith Lesar, Jim Bischoff, Bill Quandt, and many
others deserve special commendation for the tremendous effort
begun in the first week of Autumn Quarter to plan and organize
the first session of the S.U.N., a program uniqueamong American
universities.
As the editorial in yesterday’s Daily pointed out, a number
of mistakes were made which can be avoided in the future; these
are the inevitable “growing pains” of a large organization. With
the experience gained at the first session of the S.U.N., and with
the cooperation of the delegates to this session in evaluating the
relative strengths and weaknesses of the program, we are con
fident that the S.U.N. can indeed become a tradition of which
Stanford can be proud.

felt that the decision of the General Assembly to vote on the
Honduras resolution concerning the ‘Berlin Wall’ without first
debating the issue was a violation of the true spirit of the
United Nations.
Further, we feel that the large number of abstentions
recorded when a re-vote was taken on (his issue shows that many
delegates had reversed their previous hasty stand and were now
reluctant to vote on an issue that had not been debated.
Finally, we regard it as unfortunate that the S.U.N. is record
ed as having passed a resolution which it never even debated.

Coming from a strong Harvard background, where the boys
must wear coats and ties to meals, I had a reassuring experience
in Roble yesterday. Seated comfortably with my date on the
long-awaited furniture in the Roble lounge w’e were politely
informed that slacks and shorts are prohibited in the main
room. The woman told us sweetly that it was in the “blue book”
but it rather reminded me of my home state blue laws. If this
type of incident becomes a trend, I am sure that Stanford can
stamp out western informality and become the Harvard of
the West.

El Campo Eating Club has added its voice to those of other
student groups which urge the Board of Trustees to review at
their March meeting the roles of student and administrative
bodies in expressing opinions on public issues. We feel that the
volume of student concern over this issue warrants a statement
by the Board clarifying University position toward such expres
sion. We invite those student groups which have not yet spoken
on the issue to join us in this request.

Editors, The Dally:
The seniors who expressed their disappointment in the
Senior Colloqnia to he offered in the spring seem not yet to have
learned that one should investigate a subject prior to displaying
one’s ignorance of it in an arrogant manner.
I am referring to the remark “‘Man and Society in Doder
er’s Novel’ (who?).” If, instead of blowing off steam, these stu
dents (some of whom ought, to know belter) had taken the
time to look up at least critical reaction to Doderer’s novel “The
Demons,” they would have found the following;
“When this book appeared ... it was instantly hailed as
the greatest Austrian novel of the century . . . The vast array
of characters are introduced, reintroduced, labeled and com
mented upon until they become more easily recognizable than
one's neighbors. Narrative skill of a very high order makes the
book consistently engrossing.” (N.Y. Tribune Books, p. 4, S 24,
’GI)
“Last, not least, among Doderer’s troublesome talents, is
his eye for social detail. . . . All this huge, finely meshed novel
istic apparatus has been geared to produce insinuation rather
than declaration. . . . The novel, expertly modern in its drama
turgy, achieves a stunningly old-fashioned climax. It restores
moral grandeur to what, so many contemporary writers have
interpreted as man’s mean and mangy condition. Not only the
brilliance of his technique, but his moral responsiveness to his
material makes (Doderer) the foremost novelist, writing in
German today.” (N.Y. Times Book Review, p. 4, S 24 ’6l)
Doderer has frequently been compared to Proust and, with
Uwe Johnson and Gunter Grass (who are they?) represents the
astonishing revival of the modern German novel that has been
admired everywhere in Europe. I proposed last year that we
invite Doderer to lecture at Stanford and I hope that an invita
tion will bo extended to this great novelist.
If our seniors do not find Doderer interesting enough (An
thony West, in the “New Yorker” review, calls him “the spokes
man for the ideology of the extreme Right”—a fine subject for
controversy), I would consider it a rare privilege just to be per
mitted to listen to Professor Burkhardt’s colloquium.

Editors, The Daily:
As participants in the S.U.N., we wonder if delegates to the
real UN often feel as wo did after our first session—disappoint
ed, questioning if such a body could ever come up with any
constructive action. It seemed that most of the S.U.N. sessions
were taken up with debate over procedure and remarkably little
time was spent in discussion of the basic issues. This was partly
due to the nature of the resolutions presented. For example, two
of the proposals on world government consisted of long constitu
tions for a future world federation. They were so loaded with
details that they obscured the fundamental issues such as, how
will disarmament proceed; what kind of economic integration
will be most workable; how will the constitution be enforced.
The subject of world government is immensely complex, and if
we are to discuss it in a meaningful way, it is necessary to begin
