## 
### 
Rolling up their fifth and sixth
straight wins, Stanford’s rugby
team crushed St. Mary’s 22-3, and
edged Cal. 13-11 in a pair of
games last week. The victories
gave the Cards an 8-1 season rec
ord, which is better than any
other major team on the Coast.
Boh Burke was the scoring
hero against Cal on Saturday. He
kicked two conversions and also
the game-winning penalty kick
just before the first half ended.
He wound up with seven points.
THE INDIANS shocked the
Bears with a quick score after
only a minute had been played.
The Card front line executed a
series of laterals, and A1 Hilde
brand wound up with the hall on
the goal line.
Minutes later, Dick Ragsdale

faked his way through the Cal
defender's for 2a yards and a sec
ond try. Bur ke's conversion made
it 10-0. The Indians left the field
with a 13-0 halftime edge.
Content with this margin, Stan
ford played mostly defense in the
second half. Cal didn’t threaten
until quite late in the game, when
they scored a try and closed the
gap to two points. The Indians
stalled out the remaining minutes
to preserve the win.
