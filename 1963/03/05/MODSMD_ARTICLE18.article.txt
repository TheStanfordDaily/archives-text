# Frosh End Play With Two Wins
## 
### MARSHALL COOK 
Basketball called it a year at
the Stanford Pavilion Saturday
night. Led by Bob Bedell’s un
canny shooting, the freshman
team topped the JV Braves by a
60-51 margin. The night before
the frosh easily routed Santa
Clara, 80-52.

The Braves, trying to avenge a
lopsided loss to the frosh last
week, came up with a fine team
effort, even without the services
of Craig Cordes, John Murray,
and Bob Garner. But Bedell’s 27
tallies, added to a 13-point effort
by Ray Kosanke plus some fine
rebounding work, were enough
to overcome the Braves.
Against Santa Clara, a scoring
outburst by Kosanke, plus a bal
anced team effort, gave the frosh
their second win without a loss
against the Broncos this season.
In Saturday’s game, the In
dians broke to an eight-to-two
lead, but the Braves overhauled
them with 12 minutes remaining
to take a 11-10 advantage. The
two teams battled on even terms
until, with seven minutes left in
the half, the frosh pulled out to
leads of 28-22 and 30-24. By the
half-time break the Tribe owned
a 31-26 lead, and the high scoring
Bedell had bagged 14 points. At
this juncture Kosanke had tallied
nine to support Bedell’s effort.
The Braves narrowed the gap
to 31-27 to start the second half
but could never get closer. De
spite some fine outside shooting
by Brave guard Rod Young, who
netted 14 points for the game and
10 in the second half, the frosh
opened a 41-29 lead and coasted
to the victory.
With a minute and a half to go
in the game and the season,
Coach Turner unleashed his
cleanup crew, a quintet of highly
entertaining, if somewhat inept,
young men. They failed to equal
the record they set earlier in the
year of having eight men on the
ground on one play, but provided
thrills for the 12 or 13 fans who
jammed the Pavilion.
The two weekend wins left the
frosh with an 11-6 season’s mark,
but three of the losses came at
the hands of arch-rival California.
