# Look Editor Condemns Frats; Predicts Their Steady Decline
## 
### LINDA HESS Contributing Editor 
In “The Perils of Big Brother
hood,” feature article in the cur
rent issue of “Look” magazine,
Senior Editor John Poppy takes
a hard look at college fraternities,
attacks the values and attitudes
which permeate fraternity life,
and predicts the gradual but
steady demise of fraternities on
American campuses.
The feature opens with a five
page story on a Fiji pledge at the
University of Illinois and follows
up with an article which, under
the heading “Can Fraternities
Survive?”, probes the status of
the fraternity system today. Pop
py asserts that the system is an
anachronism, a 19th-century in
stitution rapidly becoming unac
ceptable to the 20th-century stu
dent, He quotes S.U. psychologist
Nevitt Sanford as supporting
this view, and cites Stanford as
one of the campuses where the
fraternity’s “traditional way of
life now faces extinction.”
HIS REFERENCE to Stanford
is based on Sigma Nu's withdraw
al from national affiliation last
year.

Tho first impression of a Stan
ford student who dips into the
“Look" article is likely to be a re
action against the extremity of
the picture painted, a feeling that
if is a little too journalistically
dramatic:

“A pledge must admit that in
dividual action is selfish and un
healthy. He must view nearly
every move he makes—from tak
ing a tost to getting a date—in
light of what it does ‘for the
house’ ...”

At Stanford, whore in two years
two fraternities have gone local
in protest against national dis
criminatory clauses, where many
campus leaders arc in fraterni
ties and members often recom
mend their houses on the grounds
that they foster individuality and
variety of interests, Poppy’s
statement sounds exaggerated.
BUT II 1 ’ THE interested Indian
leads the article through ho will
find that its analysis of the cur
rent status of fraternities
throughout the country is well
considered. hard-hitting, and
clear-headed.
“The Perils of Big Brother
hood” is a significant and provoc
ative article, of interest to any
one who belongs to or is consider
ing joining a fraternity.
