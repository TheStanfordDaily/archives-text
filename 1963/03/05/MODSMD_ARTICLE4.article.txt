| work is in stressing the human

large part of the art admirers and
patrons in the Bay Area, was ac
tive in initiating the project.
"This is a big step on the road
to a great art. program,” Mrs.
Ernest Sultan, chairman of the
| Committee’s executive board,
said. "It shows growing recogni
| tion of the importance of art in
i a liberal education.”

OF THE FUTURE of the pro
