# SPITZER TALK:
## French Revolution Is Source Of Modern Revolt Techniques 
### ROBERT NAYLOR 
The tradition of violent revolution with techniques that are
present in the 20th-century Community conspiracy, had its origin
in the French Revolution of 1789.
With this fact as a unifying background, Dr. Allen B. Spitzer,
visiting Associate Professor of History from the State University

of lowa yesterday examined the-)
19th century tradition of the “Pro
fessional Revolutionary in
France” and the historian’s prob
lems of Interpreting it. The pro
gram was part of the coffee hour
series sponsored by the Program
Division of Tresiddcr Union.
DEFINING the professional
revolutionary as “an individual
whose occupation is the over
throw of the established order,”
to be distinguished from the
peaceable believer in revolution
ary ideas, Spit/er traced the de
velopment of the French revolu
tionary tradition through several
leading figures.
In 1796 at the time of the Di
rectory and the Conspiracy of
Equals, the first professional
revolutionist appeared in the per
son of Philip Buonarotti, who
during the next 35 years became
the center of a network of con
spiratorial groups in France, a
network that had as its goal “the
fundamental regeneration of
mankind,” and was organized into
small secret groups of profession
al men and college students.
RISING TO fame after Buo
narotti’s death and possibly in
fluenced by him. Louis Auguste
Blanqui became the most impor
tant figure in the tradition during
the middle 19th century and has
been called the "incarnation of
revolutionary idealism.” Blan
quism became a standai’d word
j for left-wing groups to signify
the attempt of a radical elite to
seize power in spite of obviously
difficult conditions under which
to do so.

Spitzer said he preferred to
consider the revolutionary objec
tively as a “product of political
and social climate” of France, and
he admitted during the question
period that such an objective ap
proach may be indicative of his
own ‘neo-Blanquist” sympathies.

tionary tradition through several
leading figures.
In 1796 at the time of the Di
rectory and the Conspiracy of
Equals, the first professional
revolutionist appeared in the per
son of Philip Buonarotti, who
during the next 35 years became
the center of a network of con
spiratorial groups in France, a
network that had as its goal “the
fundamental regeneration of
mankind,” and was organized into
small secret groups of profession
al men and college students.
RISING TO fame after Buo
narotti’s death and possibly in
fluenced by him. Louis Auguste
Blanqui became the most impor
tant figure in the tradition during
the middle 19th century and has
been called the "incarnation of
revolutionary idealism.” Blan
quism became a standai’d word
j for left-wing groups to signify
the attempt of a radical elite to
seize power in spite of obviously
difficult conditions under which
to do so.

Spitzer said he preferred to
consider the revolutionary objec
tively as a “product of political
and social climate” of France, and
he admitted during the question
period that such an objective ap
proach may be indicative of his
own ‘neo-Blanquist” sympathies.
