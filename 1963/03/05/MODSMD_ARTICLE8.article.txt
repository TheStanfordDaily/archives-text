# Reduction of Pianos Is New College Fad
## 
### 
“The art of piano reduction, in
its modern form, is intended to
foster more fundamental under
graduate investigation of the de
tailed basic structure of the up
right piano, and its relation to
other similar devices of modern
technology which may bo subject
to reduction in the future.”
So begins a tract sent out by
the Reduction Study Group of Cal
Tech, an organization dedicated
to the propagation of this newest
collegiate art destined to replace
phone-booth stuffing and perhaps
even parity raids.
“The term ‘reduce,’ as adopted
by the R.S.G., is nearly synono
mous with dismantle, demolish,
or rend. The object of Piano Re
duction is, of course, to reduce
the piano—in the shortest possi
ble time, and such a state that it
may be passed through an aper
ture of 20 cm. (about 8 in.) in di
ameter. In addition to scientific,
educational, and cultural useful
ness, this valuable activity pos
sesses usefulness in that it pro
motes psychological catharsis.”
The above summarizes the rules
and aims of the activity, which
allows the use of various hand
tools such as sledge hammers,
knives, and hand grenades in the
attempt to shove the various “re
duced” particles through a small
hole in the shortest possible time.
The sport was started at Brit
ain’s Derby College of Technolo
gy, where the best time was 14
min. 3 sec., but Cal Tech’s R.S.G.
bested the effort with a time of
10 min, 44.4 sec. The newest rec
ord has been set by Detroit’s
Wayne State University, 4 min.
51 sec.

Any undergraduates interested
in forming a reduction team may
read the R.S.G.’s publication in
the Daily Shack, which outlines
all the rules and regulations for
official competition.
