# New IFC Head Cites Row's Responsibilities
## 
### RICK SEIFERT Staff Editor 
“I'd hate to see fraternities disbanded because fraternity men
haven’t seen the responsibilities facing them,” said Don Haider,
newly elected Intra-Fraternity Council President, in his cam
paign speech before the IFC last night.
Haider, a member of the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity, was

elected by the IFC to take over'
the position now held by Ed Esch
bach. A Junior majoring in Po
litical Science, Haider received a
clear two-to-one majority of the
votes in the run-off against Mar
co Magnano, Phi Kappa Sigma.

IN HIS SPEECH before the
election, Haider assured the IFC
that fraternities are “not on the
way out.” “Any institution with
our high ideals can’t go wrong”
he asserted. The new president
went on to say that the fraterni
ty system’s problems arise when

the houses “don’t live up to their
ideals.”
Haider next addressed himself
to the academic problems con
fronting various fraternities.
“One way of solving the inability
of certain fraternities to live up
to the academic standards of the
University would be to set up a
loose-knit tutorial system made
up of fraternity men,” he said.
Another aid cited by Haider was
the institution of an IFC advisory
board to interest more faculty
members in the problems con
fronting the individual houses.
Existing discrimination clauses
and the problems presented by
the administration’s liquor policy
might be further areas the IFC
could study in order to strength
en its position on the campus, ac
cording to Haider.

“I HOPE IFC can start doing
things around campus,” Haider
said. Sponsorship of a visit by
poet Carl Sandberg is entirely
within the scope of the IFC the
new president maintained. “I’d
hate to see fraternities disbanded
because fraternity men haven’t
seen the responsibilities facing
them,” he concluded.
In an interview after his elec
tion, Haider addressed himself to
problems arising from the new
rush system. Ho maintained that
a probing study of the rushing
program is needed. He included
the costs of rush, anxiety prob
lems among freshmen, the effects
of rush upon house grades, and,
in general, the “over-exposure”
resulting from the longevity of
the new system as specific areas
of study.
OTHER CANDIDATES for the
office of president showed a gen
eral dissatisfaction with the pres
ent effectiveness of the IFC.
Laird Holladay began his cam
paign speech by saying that “the
influence and prestige of the IFC
is negligible and even negative.”
He placed the blame on the dis
unity of the organization. “We
aren’t taking complete advantage
of all our weapons” he added.
Rick Swenson, another candi
date for the office, accused the
IFC of taking a “defensive and
negative attitude” toward the rest
of the campus which “leads to
zero respect.” He went on to say
that “if we can’t solve our own
problems, someone else will step
in and do it for us.”
“The most important problem,”
began candidate Steve Arch, “is
a lack of unity.” Better commu
nication within the organization
is necessary before the IFC can
direct its attention to the rest of
the campus, ho said.
Haider will take over his posi
tion in the second week of Spring
Quarter.

University would be to set up a
loose-knit tutorial system made
up of fraternity men,” he said.
Another aid cited by Haider was
the institution of an IFC advisory
board to interest more faculty
members in the problems con
fronting the individual houses.
Existing discrimination clauses
and the problems presented by
the administration’s liquor policy
might be further areas the IFC
could study in order to strength
en its position on the campus, ac
cording to Haider.

“I HOPE IFC can start doing
things around campus,” Haider
said. Sponsorship of a visit by
poet Carl Sandberg is entirely
within the scope of the IFC the
new president maintained. “I’d
hate to see fraternities disbanded
because fraternity men haven’t
seen the responsibilities facing
them,” he concluded.
In an interview after his elec
tion, Haider addressed himself to
problems arising from the new
rush system. Ho maintained that
a probing study of the rushing
program is needed. He included
the costs of rush, anxiety prob
lems among freshmen, the effects
of rush upon house grades, and,
in general, the “over-exposure”
resulting from the longevity of
the new system as specific areas
of study.
OTHER CANDIDATES for the
office of president showed a gen
eral dissatisfaction with the pres
ent effectiveness of the IFC.
Laird Holladay began his cam
paign speech by saying that “the
influence and prestige of the IFC
is negligible and even negative.”
He placed the blame on the dis
unity of the organization. “We
aren’t taking complete advantage
of all our weapons” he added.
Rick Swenson, another candi
date for the office, accused the
IFC of taking a “defensive and
negative attitude” toward the rest
of the campus which “leads to
zero respect.” He went on to say
that “if we can’t solve our own
problems, someone else will step
in and do it for us.”
“The most important problem,”
began candidate Steve Arch, “is
a lack of unity.” Better commu
nication within the organization
is necessary before the IFC can
direct its attention to the rest of
the campus, ho said.
Haider will take over his posi
tion in the second week of Spring
Quarter.

DON HAIDER
New IFC President
“I'd hate to see fraternities disbanded because fraternity men
haven’t seen the responsibilities facing them,” said Don Haider,
newly elected Intra-Fraternity Council President, in his cam
paign speech before the IFC last night.
Haider, a member of the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity, was

elected by the IFC to take over'
the position now held by Ed Esch
bach. A Junior majoring in Po
litical Science, Haider received a
clear two-to-one majority of the
votes in the run-off against Mar
co Magnano, Phi Kappa Sigma.

IN HIS SPEECH before the
election, Haider assured the IFC
that fraternities are “not on the
way out.” “Any institution with
our high ideals can’t go wrong”
he asserted. The new president
went on to say that the fraterni
ty system’s problems arise when

the houses “don’t live up to their
ideals.”
Haider next addressed himself
to the academic problems con
fronting various fraternities.
“One way of solving the inability
of certain fraternities to live up
to the academic standards of the
University would be to set up a
loose-knit tutorial system made
up of fraternity men,” he said.
Another aid cited by Haider was
the institution of an IFC advisory
board to interest more faculty
members in the problems con
fronting the individual houses.

and the problems presented by
the administration’s liquor policy
might be further areas the IFC
