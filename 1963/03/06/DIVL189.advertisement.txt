INDIANS,
Presumably, no one
would term our well
tended campus grounds
a vast wasteland, but,
nonetheless, the most
popular shoe for walk
ing it is the Clark
Desert® Boot. Why?
Easy. Brushed buck
uppers, cut high to sup
port the ankles. Easy
going cushiony rubber
soles to make 50-mile
hikes a snap. Steal in to
R A for a new pair of
COB's, in sand tan or
crazy black. The tab
won’t dent the budget
much either, just 12.95.
