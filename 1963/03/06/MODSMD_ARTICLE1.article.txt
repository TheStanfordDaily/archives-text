## Terman Says U.S. Must Raise Number of Trained Scientists 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
I lit 1 United States must increase its number of highly trained
engineers and scientists in order to compete with Russia in mili
tary strength, said Dr. Fred Terman last evening in his Tuesday
Evening Series address. The University provost and vice-president
spoke on ‘Scientific and Engineering Manpower in a Highly

Competitive World.” The elec
tronics growth in Russia is amaz
ing. he said. The United States is
ahead technologically in the over
all picture, but the gap is closing
fast and may be gone in fifteen
to twenty years.
IN THE United States there is
a decline in the number of stu
dents selecting engineering ma
jors, and the drop is not compen
sated for by an increase in the
math and physical science fields,
he said.
In order to have military
strength, a country needs a good
industrial base, well-trained en
gineers and scientists, and a will
ingness to place priority on the
growth of military strength, he
stated, and Russia meets these
conditions.
Russia has the goal of control
ling the world, he said, whereas
the United States does not have a
directed plan.
THE USSR has reorganized its
school system to increase the
number of graduate enginers and
scientists, he said. Science and
engineering majors are made
compulsory for many students,
and two-thirds as many women
as men in Russia arc engineering
college graduates, he explained.
Because of Russia’s greater
population, we cannot outnumber
her scientists and engineers, hut
the degree of higher training is
more significant than numbers,
he felt. The complexity of mili
tary projects such as the ICBM’s
require advanced skill. Many
math and engineering students in
the United States fail to got ad
vanced training, he explained,
and poorly trained technologists
cost our military program time
and money.
A recent study on the use of
United States resources found our
most serious shortage in man
power was in technologists with
the combination of high ability
and advanced training, he stated.
Kennedy's proposed legislation
includes a program of increased
aid to full-time graduate students
in engineering and science, and
funds for the corresponding ex
panded school facilities, he said.
