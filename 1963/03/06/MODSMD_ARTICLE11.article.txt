## 'War Hawks and War Whoops' 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
After a week in Arizona. I not only have a fine sunburn, but
I also think I have learned something. By reading Mr. Pulliam’s
newspapers in the morning and the evening, I have learned
that we must distinguish between a war party—of which I have
seen no traces out here and a war whoop party, which likes to
be warlike but does not want war.
A war party consists of people conspiring and agitating to
start a war from which the country will win, they think, profit
and glory. II would be hard to find an American who thinks
that in any great war today there could be much profit or glory.
The war whoop party consists of people who suppose that, no
matter what we do, the Russians will not go to war. Having this
kind of confidence, they suppose that, in order to get rid of
Castro, we are quite free to flirt with smallish acts of war, such
as blockade or even an invasion and occupation. They see no
essential difference between the Cuban War of 1898 and a Cuban
War in 1963.
Yet there are in fact not many who want to take such risks.
The mass of the war whoop party—a significant minority of the
nation—do not want any war or any shooting. What they do
want are the fruits of a successful war without having to fight
a war. Every day, Mr. Pulliam’s editorial writers knock the stuff
ings out of Khrushchev with a smashing editorial.
I shall be going back to Washington convinced that the
country wants Cuba handled without war, big or little, and that
it would not only be wrong hut quite unnecessary for the Presi
dent to change his course in order to quiet the war whoopers.
The fact in the Cuban is that there is now a consensus on the
controlling facts.
The responsible opposition, which is best represented by
Senator Keating of New York, is in agreement with the admin
istration that (1) with the removal of the long-range missiles,
there is no military threat to the Unied States, and (2) that with
constant aerial photography, it would not be possible to do again
what was done during the intelligence gap in September and
October—to construct secretly an offensive base. They are
agreed furthermore (3) that the Cuban problem is not military
but paramilitary. Cuba is a convenient base for training and
equipping agents and infiltrators, saboteurs and guerillas to
operate in Central and South America.
This being the character of the Cuban problem today, the
American people have to make a fundamental decision. Shall we
wipe out the subversive base by conquering it, expelling the
Russians, arresting the Castroites and governing Cuba? The
answer is that we shall not do this unless there is deliberate
planned aggression from Cuba against American interests and
rights. Why won’t we do it? Because the invasion of Cuba would
require several divisions of troops and would cost very heavy
casualties and would, after a successful invasion and conquest,
leave us with the odious task of policing Cuba and with the ob
ligation to feed and restore Cuba for a period of perhaps 10
years at the least.
Not even the war whoopers in their most carefree and irre
sponsible moments want an invasion and occupation. What then
is left? What is left is what we now have: the policy of contain
ment. Once wo adopt the policy of containment, we are faced
with the consoling reality, which is that the United States alone
cannot contain Castro tightly. How tightly he is contained de
pends not on us alone, but most of all on what the other Ameri
can states are able and willing to do. We can help them with
advice and technical devices, but the United States cannot guard
all the harbors and airports and control the channels of com
munication, including embassies from all parts of the world,
through which subversion operates. Each American country will
have to deal with the small aggressions. The United States, if it
has Latin-American cooperation, can control the seas and inter
cept any large scale operation which might be launched from
Cuba.
The policy of containment cannot be emotionally satisfying.
Only an invasion, and an invasion only in the first days before
the casualty lists come in, would satisfy the emotions of the war
whoopers. But while the country will not feel happy about con
tainment, it will surely feel unhappy about the alternative. For
a war would not be clean and surgical and quick. It would be
long, dreary and inconclusive.
