## 'One Half of a Concert' 
### HOWARD I., WEINBERG Contributing Editor 
I watched the first half of (ho Joan Baez concert Monday
night from the orchestra pit. And no one threw me out, I left
voluntarily to give up my seat to a young couple w’ho also
wanted to hear Joan.
I figured that 1 had at least one-half of Joan Baez concert
coming to me free. Two or three years ago she came to Winter
Carnival at Dartmouth. If anyone knows what goes on at the
snowiest of college weekends, one will be quite aware that not
much happens at 11 a.m. Saturday morning. Yet Joan was there
in a bright red (corduroy—from where I sat) jumper. She had
to wake up one-third of an auditorium and hope that some
more would show before noon.
One of the absent was my date who resisted all attempts to
see Joan—“l’ve seen her in Boston”—(my date went to Boston
University—and since she probably had managed to filler into
a Harvard Square coffeeshop to see Joan, I let her sleep).
The empty seat next to me at that concert long ago was a
painful reminder that my date was not the Carnival type—not
even a snow bunny. We missed the ski jumping because she
didn’t bring overshoes . . . but after six she became the ideal
Carnival date—but this consolation was ineffective as I sat
watching Joan Baez. Finally everyone realized that there was no
reason to sit in reserved seats and the sparse audience condensed
itself around Joan—one eager student ran to the edge of the
stage to gel a better look at her.
I think she was shier then, or her hair was shorter. She hid
behind her hair. Monday night she wrapped her hair around her
neck and tried several times to get it into a comfortable po
sition. “I could use a bobby pin,” she said, “but you know what
it would do to the imago.” And she added, after the crest of the
laughter, “Besides you might be able to see what I look like.”
Joan Baez had come home. Her friends were in the audi
ence and she signaled each time she spotted one. But she greeted
the rest of us with "I’m a rambler. I’m a gambler. I’m a long
way from home and if people don’t like me they can leave me
alone.”
Was she at home? I began to wonder. Her answer came in
a Mexican song she sang. The audience didn’t understand the
words but they knew she enjoyed singing it the most—it was
obvious; therefore, they applauded the loudest. After the song,
Joan said, “Sometimes I think it really isn’t fair when there’s a
song like that—it’s like floating—anyway, I’m not too explicit.”
But I think she was. If it’s home, then it’s got to be private—or
in some way special so that, the members of the family know
they’re together. When you’re home you can behave with aban
don, there are few onlookers who don’t know you as the family
does . . .And when the family’s around you can talk a special
language, just feel good, despite the others—or at least for a
while. Many of the strangers do understand, though they know
they can’t participate. But they prefer it that way. Joan probably
realized this when she took another chance and sang without
accompanying herself on the guitar. But she meant the words
“I once was lost but now I’m found. I once was blind but now I
see.” And for her final song before intermission she said, “Sing
one with me.”
I think she even meant that for me in the orchestra pit. the
two girls hidden in the stairwell, the boy with the camera behind
the curtain and the tall boy in the doorway in the balcony.
