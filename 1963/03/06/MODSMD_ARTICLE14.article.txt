# CONCERT REVIEW
## Joan Baez 'Enthralling' 
### KATHLEEN DOWNING Managing Editor 
Joan Baez reduced her audience to an awed gamin seated
before her bare toes last night in Memorial Auditorium. Her
lyric soprano enthralled the capacity crowd; her stage de
meanor tickled them as gently as her slick black hair would
have teased their faces.
The restraint of her voice was echoed in the majority of
her selections. The dozen Anglo-American ballads she sang
espoused resignation in the face of the pathetic dilemmas of
desertion and desolation. “I think the fair maid usually got the
rough end,” Miss Baez explained; ‘‘that’s why I have such a
large repertoire.” The laments of the “fair maids” personally
concerned the young folksinger; her concern was not delivered
by her voice. She maintained, in her clear soprano, a high and
sweet enunciation of song themes. Miss Baez did not pull any
emotional punches by varying her voice. Breaks in pronuncia
tion, emotive breath pauses and other devices valid for a de
livery of ethnic music are not part of her technique. She can be
praised for rejecting the school of ethnic fanatics who consider
a good piece of folk music to be that sung by a cracked-voiced
illiterate, captured on tape by technicians who have tracked the
old singer down through twenty mile of back country; but she
cannot be praised for so modulating her voice that the emotional
beauty of her favorite ballads is carried solely by facial ex
pression.
In the front of the auditorium, the beauty of her facial ex
pression cannot be missed. Caressing her guitar and narrowing
her eyes, Miss Baez withdraws from the mike and spotlight
into a private vision; impressed with the sincerity of her per
sonal concern, the listener can join her in the shadowy wbrld of
lament and resignation.
Fortunately, the listener is not asked to believe that the
world is overwhelmingly erratic. Miss Baez is an apostle of the
particular overcoming. “I know.” she said, “that I’m not sup
posed to preach, but I had a fragment, of a thought while walk
ing in the sunlight several days ago.” She convinced the audi
ence of the ugliness of destruction with this fragment: “Things
shouldn’t be destroyed for we are young and must live longer
. . . should live long enough to know right from wrong.” That
she will continue to define the pathos and to react, as an in
dividual, against the world dilemma was evident during one of
her encores. Miss Baez asked the audience to join her in the
“Battle Hymn of the Republic.” “I’m going on a tour of the
South soon,” she explained, “and I will sing this song.”
Perhaps the clearest statement of her style was her solo,
“Amazing Grace.” Without guitar accompaniment, this spiriual
was exemplary of the pensive force of her delivery and the
reserve of her voice. She is not a rambunctious gospel singer;
the simplicity of her delivery contrasted effectively with the
usual mode of delivery for a spiritual. For a moment, she
seemed transfixed as the innocent young wanderer, the epithet
she gave herself in her opening song. The lack of the guitar
implicitly indicated the secondary nature of that instrument to
her style. Miss Baez did miss the pitch in this piece without a
cue from the guitar. Occasionally she enlivened her guitar strum
with breathy humming.
The final comment on her performance was stated by a
subdued audience. As her second encore, Miss Baez chose the
subtle protest song, “What did they do to the rain?” She con
cluded, nodded gently and was rewarded with the cry of Pac
ifists in the balcony. They resolutely entoned the stanza of
Pete Seeger’s protest song, “We shall overcome.”

her eyes, Miss Baez withdraws from the mike and spotlight
into a private vision; impressed with the sincerity of her per
sonal concern, the listener can join her in the shadowy wbrld of
lament and resignation.
Fortunately, the listener is not asked to believe that the
world is overwhelmingly erratic. Miss Baez is an apostle of the
particular overcoming. “I know.” she said, “that I’m not sup
posed to preach, but I had a fragment, of a thought while walk
ing in the sunlight several days ago.” She convinced the audi
ence of the ugliness of destruction with this fragment: “Things
shouldn’t be destroyed for we are young and must live longer
. . . should live long enough to know right from wrong.” That
she will continue to define the pathos and to react, as an in
dividual, against the world dilemma was evident during one of
her encores. Miss Baez asked the audience to join her in the
“Battle Hymn of the Republic.” “I’m going on a tour of the
South soon,” she explained, “and I will sing this song.”
Perhaps the clearest statement of her style was her solo,
“Amazing Grace.” Without guitar accompaniment, this spiriual
was exemplary of the pensive force of her delivery and the
reserve of her voice. She is not a rambunctious gospel singer;
the simplicity of her delivery contrasted effectively with the
usual mode of delivery for a spiritual. For a moment, she
seemed transfixed as the innocent young wanderer, the epithet
she gave herself in her opening song. The lack of the guitar
implicitly indicated the secondary nature of that instrument to
her style. Miss Baez did miss the pitch in this piece without a
cue from the guitar. Occasionally she enlivened her guitar strum
with breathy humming.
The final comment on her performance was stated by a
subdued audience. As her second encore, Miss Baez chose the
subtle protest song, “What did they do to the rain?” She con
cluded, nodded gently and was rewarded with the cry of Pac
ifists in the balcony. They resolutely entoned the stanza of
Pete Seeger’s protest song, “We shall overcome.”
Joan Baez reduced her audience to an awed gamin seated
before her bare toes last night in Memorial Auditorium. Her
lyric soprano enthralled the capacity crowd; her stage de
meanor tickled them as gently as her slick black hair would
have teased their faces.
The restraint of her voice was echoed in the majority of
her selections. The dozen Anglo-American ballads she sang
espoused resignation in the face of the pathetic dilemmas of
desertion and desolation. “I think the fair maid usually got the
rough end,” Miss Baez explained; ‘‘that’s why I have such a
large repertoire.” The laments of the “fair maids” personally
concerned the young folksinger; her concern was not delivered
by her voice. She maintained, in her clear soprano, a high and
sweet enunciation of song themes. Miss Baez did not pull any
emotional punches by varying her voice. Breaks in pronuncia
tion, emotive breath pauses and other devices valid for a de
livery of ethnic music are not part of her technique. She can be
praised for rejecting the school of ethnic fanatics who consider
a good piece of folk music to be that sung by a cracked-voiced
illiterate, captured on tape by technicians who have tracked the
old singer down through twenty mile of back country; but she
cannot be praised for so modulating her voice that the emotional
beauty of her favorite ballads is carried solely by facial ex
pression.
In the front of the auditorium, the beauty of her facial ex
pression cannot be missed. Caressing her guitar and narrowing
her eyes, Miss Baez withdraws from the mike and spotlight
into a private vision; impressed with the sincerity of her per
sonal concern, the listener can join her in the shadowy wbrld of
lament and resignation.
