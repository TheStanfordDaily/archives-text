Editors, The Daily;
In answer to the Roth House letter of March 1, the Friday
afternoon jazz sessions in Tresidder have not been discontinued.
The design of Tresidder permits a music program to be
presented in one room without it being heard elsewhere in the
building. I have not heard people studying in Tresidder complain
about the jazz sessions. Even if the music did interfere with their
studying, I would point out that the jazz sessions are presented
for only two hours each week, that they provide an end of the
week “breather,” and that the facilities in Tresidder are pri
marily for the presentation of informal educational activities,
not for studying.
We hope that the Friday afternoon jazz sessions, as well as
other informal entertainment can be presented more frequently
in the quarter ahead. These kinds of programs are a unique op
portunity for talented campus people to be heard. We are by
no means aware of all the people on campus who would want
to participate in such programs. Suggestions concerning them
are always welcome.
Todd Davis
Chairman, Program Division—Tresidder Union
