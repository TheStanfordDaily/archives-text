# OUR MAN ON THE FARM
## UCLA Basketball: Oh (P)Shaw! 
### Glenn Alford 
One of my favorite pastimes is reading the deathless prose of
other college dailies, especially when they have reports on athletic
contests between Stanford and their schools.
I especially enjoy reading the UCLA Daily Bruin because it
Usually carries an impartial account of any and all games, with teams’
good and bad points outlined. The feature columns are another mat
ter. In particular I cite “Oh (P)Shaw” written by David Shaw, Daily
Bruin Sports Editor.
On February 2(1, Shaw featured a column telling of the UCLA
road trip which hud the Bruins playing Stanford on February 22,

and Cal on February 23. Among
other things, Shaw indulged in
the second most popular sport of
Big Six member schools —knock-
ing the Stanford Pavilion.
The part concerning Stanford
reads as follows:
“Unfortunately for the Bruins,
he (Hazzard) and his team
mates found playing conditions
in Palo Alto far from ideal.
“THE GYM was so small that
Gail Goodrich almost scraped his
arm on the wall going up for a
rebound. The fans were so rowdy
that Slaughter wanted to quit
when a Pepsi Cola bottle sailed
out of the stands and broke on
the floor.” (I would like to add
parenthetically that the bottle
sailed out of the stands near
where some UCLA rooters were
sitting, when a call went against
UCLA.)

“And the officiating was so poor that I'm beginning to think it
would he easier to find a chaste woman in a brothel than to find a
fairly officiated game in Palo Alto,”

That is the substance dealing with Stanford. Most of the above
is patently absurd. To begin with, the officiating in that game was
excellent, the best Stanford has had all year. The game could have
gotten out of hand, hut Ernie Filiberti and Bill Bussenius kept con
trol until Hazzard belted Dose with an elbow in the last seconds of
the overtime. If the officiating was lacking something, it was
severity against Fred Slaughter, who decked Dose more times with
elbows than Howie Dallmar has grey hairs on his head.
Since Shaw indulged in knocking the Pavilion, I feel almost
obligated to knock the UCLA basketball team.
Walter Hazzard is one of the biggest showboats in basketball to
day. He complained to the referees on almost every call made against
UCLA in both games played in tlu* Pavilion, and the game against
California at Berkeley. The Cal game, which I saw on television,
made this especially obvious.
Every time the whistle blew, the camera turned on the referee
making the call. And the camera also showed Hazzard jawing with
the arbiter.
Though I admire Hazzard’s playing ability and privately con
cede that he may be the best college basketball player in America,
I cannot condone some of his playing methods: lor example, the
elbowing of Dose.
Fred Slaughter impresses me as much as Hazzard with his
sportsman-like conduct. When he fouled out of the UCLA-USC game
last weekend he threw the ball into the stands and had to be re
strained as he was led to the bench.
KNOCKING UCLA CAN BE carried too far. When Darrell
Sutherland fractured his wrist Jack Hirsch took the blame because
he was called for a foul on the play. Films showed that Sutherland
was guilty of as obvious an offensive foul as has ever been seen in
the Pavilion. He drove to the basket and hit Hirsch head on while
teh latter was trying to cover up. He flattened Hirsch and dove over
the top. landing on his left side and breaking the bone in his wrist.

To completely purge myself of all desire to write about UCLA ;
basketball let me mention an article I saw in Rube Samuelson’s
“Southland Reporter” of the San Francisco Chronicle. Samuelson
presented a comment by UCLA basketball broadcaster Fred Hessler,
whose broadcasting ability may be likened to that of Russ Hodges.
Hessler directed a broadside at the Stanford Red Vest Band,
complaining that it played during UCLA free-throw attempts. He
also said that the band should be located at center-court, which can
hardly be argued. The part a-bout the band playing UCLA free |
throws however deserves comment.
I may be short of memory, but I can remember only a few in- (
stances of smli behavior. On file other band. Hie UCLA band played
on virtually every Stanford free toss.
Before Mr. Hessler takes it upon himself to haul out the skel
etons in the Stanford closet, he should clean out the Bruin closet.

the overtime. If the officiating was lacking something, it was
severity against Fred Slaughter, who decked Dose more times with
elbows than Howie Dallmar has grey hairs on his head.
Since Shaw indulged in knocking the Pavilion, I feel almost
obligated to knock the UCLA basketball team.
Walter Hazzard is one of the biggest showboats in basketball to
day. He complained to the referees on almost every call made against
UCLA in both games played in tlu* Pavilion, and the game against
California at Berkeley. The Cal game, which I saw on television,
made this especially obvious.
Every time the whistle blew, the camera turned on the referee
making the call. And the camera also showed Hazzard jawing with
the arbiter.
Though I admire Hazzard’s playing ability and privately con
cede that he may be the best college basketball player in America,
I cannot condone some of his playing methods: lor example, the
elbowing of Dose.
Fred Slaughter impresses me as much as Hazzard with his
sportsman-like conduct. When he fouled out of the UCLA-USC game
last weekend he threw the ball into the stands and had to be re
strained as he was led to the bench.
KNOCKING UCLA CAN BE carried too far. When Darrell
Sutherland fractured his wrist Jack Hirsch took the blame because
he was called for a foul on the play. Films showed that Sutherland
was guilty of as obvious an offensive foul as has ever been seen in
the Pavilion. He drove to the basket and hit Hirsch head on while
teh latter was trying to cover up. He flattened Hirsch and dove over
the top. landing on his left side and breaking the bone in his wrist.

To completely purge myself of all desire to write about UCLA ;
basketball let me mention an article I saw in Rube Samuelson’s
“Southland Reporter” of the San Francisco Chronicle. Samuelson
presented a comment by UCLA basketball broadcaster Fred Hessler,
whose broadcasting ability may be likened to that of Russ Hodges.
Hessler directed a broadside at the Stanford Red Vest Band,
complaining that it played during UCLA free-throw attempts. He
also said that the band should be located at center-court, which can
hardly be argued. The part a-bout the band playing UCLA free |
throws however deserves comment.
I may be short of memory, but I can remember only a few in- (
stances of smli behavior. On file other band. Hie UCLA band played
on virtually every Stanford free toss.
Before Mr. Hessler takes it upon himself to haul out the skel
etons in the Stanford closet, he should clean out the Bruin closet.

One of my favorite pastimes is reading the deathless prose of
other college dailies, especially when they have reports on athletic
contests between Stanford and their schools.
I especially enjoy reading the UCLA Daily Bruin because it
Usually carries an impartial account of any and all games, with teams’
good and bad points outlined. The feature columns are another mat
ter. In particular I cite “Oh (P)Shaw” written by David Shaw, Daily
Bruin Sports Editor.
On February 2(1, Shaw featured a column telling of the UCLA
road trip which hud the Bruins playing Stanford on February 22,

and Cal on February 23. Among
other things, Shaw indulged in
the second most popular sport of
Big Six member schools —knock-
ing the Stanford Pavilion.
The part concerning Stanford
reads as follows:
“Unfortunately for the Bruins,
he (Hazzard) and his team
mates found playing conditions
in Palo Alto far from ideal.
“THE GYM was so small that
Gail Goodrich almost scraped his
arm on the wall going up for a
rebound. The fans were so rowdy
that Slaughter wanted to quit
when a Pepsi Cola bottle sailed
out of the stands and broke on
the floor.” (I would like to add
parenthetically that the bottle
sailed out of the stands near
where some UCLA rooters were
sitting, when a call went against
UCLA.)

“And the officiating was so poor that I'm beginning to think it
would he easier to find a chaste woman in a brothel than to find a
fairly officiated game in Palo Alto,”

That is the substance dealing with Stanford. Most of the above
is patently absurd. To begin with, the officiating in that game was
excellent, the best Stanford has had all year. The game could have
gotten out of hand, hut Ernie Filiberti and Bill Bussenius kept con
trol until Hazzard belted Dose with an elbow in the last seconds of
the overtime. If the officiating was lacking something, it was
severity against Fred Slaughter, who decked Dose more times with
elbows than Howie Dallmar has grey hairs on his head.
