# Tribe Wrestlers Lose to SFS
## 
### 
Stanfordâ€™s wrestlers ended
their regular season Monday
night, losing to San Francisco
State 17-14. Strangely, the In
dians had more individual wins
in losing to SFS than they did in
an 17-15 win against the same
school earlier in the year. How
ever, Monday the Indians forfeit-

Ed both 123 pounds and 107, giv
ing SFS ten free points.
Stanford picked up its points
on a tie by Hap Klopp at 117 and
four wins. Dan Barrett won at
137; 5-1; Phil Kendall won at 157,
3-1; Tom Allen won at 177, 2-1;
and Don Buehler won at heavy
weight, 2-0.
