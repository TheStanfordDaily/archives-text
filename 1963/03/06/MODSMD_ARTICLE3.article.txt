### ANN TODD 
Former President Herbert Hoo
ver yesterday became the fh'st
recipient of the Herbert Hoover
Medal for Distinguished Service
which was named for him last
year.
Stanford Alumni Association
President, Guy R. Neely, who
presented the solid gold medal to
Hoover reported, “When the five
member selection committee sat
down to ponder the letters of
nomination received from alumni
around the world, many names
merited consideration . . . and in
the time ahead will be honored.
But, for the first award? Herbert
Hoover, who else?"
NO OTHER American Presi
dent has been more deeply in
volved in the development of a
single academic institution for as
long as Hoover. As President J.
Wallace Sterling wrote in his let
ter of congratulations to Hoover,
“It is singularly appropiiate that
this medal should bear your
name and that you should bo the
first recipient of it. It is appropri
ate that it is presented to you
during Founders’ Week. You
were present on that October day
in 1891 when Senator Stanford
said to the students assembled in
the Inner Quad that the Universi
ty could do no more than ‘place
the opportunities within your
reach: it rests with you to grasp
and improve them.’ ”
HOOVER’S SERVICE to Stan
ford did not begin in 1912 when
he became the first alumnus
elected to the Board of Trustees.
As a student, in 1892, Hoover
helped arrange the first Big
Game with the University of
California. “Thanks to Hoover’s
astute management at the ticket
gate, it also helped put athletics
on a sound financial footing.”
During the seven months after
his election as treasurer, he eras
ed a $1,200 deficit and “put stu
dent government back in the
black.”
“Hoover’s strong interest in fi
nancial matters led to the first
full statement of the University’s
resources and liabilities, income
and expenditures, ever given to
the trutees and the public. If con
tinues today in his honorary
chairmanship of the University’s
PACE Program.”
A re-run of NBC’s program,
‘Biography: Herbert Hoover” will
be presented tonight in Cubber
ley Auditorium immediately after
“Stanford: Challenging Era”
which starts at 7:30 p.m.
