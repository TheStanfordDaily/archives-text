# Surgery Team Has Low Death Rate

The open-heart surgery team at the Stanford
Medical Center maintains the lowest known mor
tality rate in the nation through the combined
use of a new X-ray technique, the heart-lung ma
chine, and the efficient cooperation of the de
partments in the Hospital and the Medical School.
Since the performance of the first open-heart oper
ation at the Center on January 8, 1960, the mor
tality rate stands at six for the first 100 opera
tions and only four in the next 150.
‘‘Open-heart surgery means operating within
the heart under direct vision,” explains Dr. Eu
gene Dong, a member of the team. In closed
heart surgery the surgeon does not see into the
ehart and the heart does not have to be stopped
during the operation. The Stanford team of sur
' geons. headed by Dr. Norman Shumway, uses a
heart-lung machine in the operations, in which
the heart is opened. “Ours is well developed, well
designed, and the technicians who operate it are
the best,” says Dr. Shumway.
The machine, developed In Sweden in the
! 1950'5, by-passes the heart and lungs and takes
over their functions by supplying the blood with
fresh oxygen and pumping it back into the body.
With the machine the teams have achieved some
spectacular seults in taking out tumors, closing
holes, and opening stuck valves.
In a very few operations where no more than
seven minutes are needed to correct a defect, the
machine does not have to be used. The patient can
be cooled before the operation to 27 degrees C, so
i that with reduced oxygen needs the blood flow to

his heart can actually be stopped. This method j
was more widely used before the heart-lung ma
chine was developed. The dexterity it requires is
unsafe for more complicated operations, says Dr.
Dong,
The surgeons partly atribute their precision
to the use of a new moving picture technique of
X-ray, known as cineangiography. This method is
able to show up heart defects otherwise hard to
pinpoint. This biplane cineangiocardiographic unit
in the Stanford Diagnostic X-ray division is the
only one of its kind in current use throughout the
U.S., although three others are currently being
installed in other centers. It takes pictures from
two sides of the heart simultaneously, so that the
doctors have a three-dimensional impression of
the heart by looking at the two views sequentially.
The Medical Center’s Intensive Care Unit is
another factor in the successful record of his
heart surgery, says Dr. Shumway. Each patient
can be under the exclusive care of one nurse until
he is out of the critical period.
Each operation, no matter how simple, de
mands a surprising number of people, approxi
mately 50 in all. Ten people assist in the actual
operation: four surgeons, an anesthetist, a pump
operator for the heart-lung machine and his two
helpers, and two nurses. The total manpower
needed includes adult and pediatric cardiologists,
who thoroughly examine the patient; radiologists,
who use both the conventional and the new cine
angiographic techniques; clinical technicians, and
the sixteen blood donors required for each oper
ation.
