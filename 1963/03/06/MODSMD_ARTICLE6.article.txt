# Brazilian Students Talk on Politics
## 
### VICTORIA NICOL 
"The Brazilian student movo
mtYit is one of the most dynamic
stifHent movements of any nation
in the world,” said John Worth
as ho introduced the discussion
led by the visiting Brazilian stu
dents in the El Campo lounge
Monday night.
The discussion which followed,
by 16 enthusiastic Brazilian stu
dent leaders, proved his point.
The topic cited for the discussion,
“The Brazilian Loft and Its Po
litical Role” was thoroughly
treated, for the student movement
and the Brazilian left are one and
the same, and the students have
assumed the political responsi
bility of trying to organize a new
nationality, “New Brazil.”
“Our major slogan.” said one
of the students, “is that every
student must also be a politician.”
THIS FUELING has developed
in the short history of Brazilian
Federal Universities which have
developed since the Revolution of
1930. The two major federal Uni
versities, the University of San
Paolo, and the University of Bra
zil were not founded until 1934
and 1935 respectively,
“Our movement,” said one stu
dent, “is part of the middle class
participation.” Although there is
disagreement as to the methods
by which the reforms in Brazil
should be accomplished, by evo
lution or by revolution, the stu
dents all emphatically agree that
something must be done, now.
They see the solution to Bra
zil’s problems in two major
fields; education and land reform.
Fifty-five per cent of the people
are illiterate and as many or
are starving.
THE NATIONAL Student Un
ion is actively working to solve
these problems. Volunteer stu
dents are going out into the coun
tryside and into the slums to
teach the people how to read and
write, and to “propagandize” for
a more active and aware outlook
amongst the Brazilian population,
both politically and economically.
They are allied with the workers
and support them when they
strike.
The students arc visiting the
United States on a program
sponsored by the State Depart
ment. They have studied the civi
lization and history of the United
States for four weeks at UCLA
and are now traveling around
awhile before returning to their
1 country.

assumed the political responsi
bility of trying to organize a new
nationality, “New Brazil.”
“Our major slogan.” said one
of the students, “is that every
student must also be a politician.”
THIS FUELING has developed
in the short history of Brazilian
Federal Universities which have
developed since the Revolution of
1930. The two major federal Uni
versities, the University of San
Paolo, and the University of Bra
zil were not founded until 1934
and 1935 respectively,
“Our movement,” said one stu
dent, “is part of the middle class
participation.” Although there is
disagreement as to the methods
by which the reforms in Brazil
should be accomplished, by evo
lution or by revolution, the stu
dents all emphatically agree that
something must be done, now.
They see the solution to Bra
zil’s problems in two major
fields; education and land reform.
Fifty-five per cent of the people
are illiterate and as many or
are starving.
THE NATIONAL Student Un
ion is actively working to solve
these problems. Volunteer stu
dents are going out into the coun
tryside and into the slums to
teach the people how to read and
write, and to “propagandize” for
a more active and aware outlook
amongst the Brazilian population,
both politically and economically.
They are allied with the workers
and support them when they
strike.
The students arc visiting the
United States on a program
sponsored by the State Depart
ment. They have studied the civi
lization and history of the United
States for four weeks at UCLA
and are now traveling around
awhile before returning to their
1 country.
