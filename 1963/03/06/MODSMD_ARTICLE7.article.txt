# Three SU Students Win Marshall Scholarships
## 
### WENDY DORTORT 
Three Stanford students have just been named Marshall Schol
ars, making Stanford the leading university in this year’s competi
tion. William Butler, Thomas Grey, and Mark Matovich have all
received two-year fellowships with a possible third-year renewal
to study at British universities. Twenty-four scholarships are

awarded yearly. The scholars are
chosen by five United States re
gional committees, with the
stress mainly placed on intellec
tual promise.
Unlike Rhodes Scholars who
must be unmarried males and
must attend Oxford, Marshall
Scholars may be men or women,
married or unmarried college
graduates who then work to earn
either graduate or undergraduate
degrees at any of Britain’s twen
ty-four universities.
GREY is planning to study phi
losophy at Brasenose College in
Oxford: Butler’s field is modern
history which he will pursue at
Wadham College, Oxford. Mato
vich intends to follow chemical
engineering at Cambridge Uni
versity.
With three Marshall and three
Rhodes Scholars, Stanford this
year has had the largest concen
tration of awards since 1947-48.
Harvard was second in the na
tion in the Marshall competition
with two scholars named. Sixteen
other American universities had
one scholar each. Three were se
lected at large.
THE BRITISH government es
tablished Marshall Scholarships
ten years ago as a gesture to the
United States, naming them for
the late General George Catlett
Marshall who inspired the post
war plan of American aid to Eu
rope.
