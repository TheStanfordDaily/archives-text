# Poppy Criticizes Fraternity System, Raises Spirited Audience Discussion
## 
### LINDA HESS Contributing Editor 
Does joining a fraternity set
a man up for three years of social
complacency, eliminating the ne
cessity to broaden his sphere of
friends and interests? Is the
pledge program indicative of the
fraternity’s encouragement of un
questioning conformity?
These are some of the ques
tions which were raised and dis
cussed last night by a panel fea
turing John Poppy, Senior Editor
of “Look” magazine and author
of a recent article attacking col
lege fraternities. Seated with
Poppy on the panel were IFC
president Ed Eschbach, Stern As
sistant Director Tom Boysen,
Wilbur Head Sponsor John Stein
bruner, and two fraternity presi
dents.
THE JUNIPER© Lounge was
} crowded with freshmen and rep-
I resentatives of various houses,
who later became active and
sometimes angry participants in
I the discussion when it was open
ed to the audience.
Poppy opened the program
with introductory remarks on his
article. His intention, he said,
was to take a serious look at
fraternities, not merely to use
them as a “whipping boy.”
The question of authoritarian
ism and conformity was a central
issue. “I don’t think that pledge
training is nearly as rigorous at
Stanford as at most places,” said
Tom Boysen. “However, I think
that fraternities do represent sets
of values which mold the atti
tudes of their members. This is a
more insidious and more danger
ous form of authoritarianism
than the pledge line-up.”
FRATERNITIES were defend
ed on the grounds that they offer

an opportunity for a student to
become closely acquainted with a
fairly large group of people dur
ing their college years. Beim
brought out the practical advan
tages of alumni and national sup
port for local endeavors- the new
SAE house is an example—and
the knowledge that hospitality is
available with brothers on cam
puses all over the country.
Stanford fraternities were de
fended in' particular as being
more liberal and more hetero
geneous than most. Most Stan
ford students are outstanding to
start with, and the fraternities
here tend to encourage leader
ship and diversity.
POPPY ADMITTED that the
level of enlightenment was prob
ably relatively high at Stanford.
He cited as evidence (he fact that
many nationals consider Stanford
a bad fraternity campus.
Still, he insisted, the supposed
advantages of fraternity affili
ation do not begin to compensate
for its negative effects on educa
tion and individual development.
The Harvard house system was
pointed out as a working alter
native system where these ef
fects are largely eliminated.
“People in this country are too
willing to be identified with a
group without knowing what the
group is doing and why. I would
prefer to see a man set his own
goals and be responsible to him
self rather than to a group.”
POPPY SUMMARIZED his po
sition with the statement that
“in the last analysis fraternities
do not add enough to a man’s
education and character to make
up for the risks they involve:
commitment to a group and a
system without understanding
what they are representing and
teaching.”

I resentatives of various houses,
who later became active and
sometimes angry participants in

ed to the audience.
Poppy opened the program
with introductory remarks on his
article. His intention, he said,
was to take a serious look at
fraternities, not merely to use
them as a “whipping boy.”
The question of authoritarian
ism and conformity was a central
issue. “I don’t think that pledge
training is nearly as rigorous at
Stanford as at most places,” said
Tom Boysen. “However, I think
that fraternities do represent sets
of values which mold the atti
tudes of their members. This is a
more insidious and more danger
ous form of authoritarianism
than the pledge line-up.”
FRATERNITIES were defend
ed on the grounds that they offer

an opportunity for a student to
become closely acquainted with a
fairly large group of people dur
ing their college years. Beim
brought out the practical advan
tages of alumni and national sup
port for local endeavors- the new
SAE house is an example—and
the knowledge that hospitality is
available with brothers on cam
puses all over the country.
Stanford fraternities were de
fended in' particular as being
more liberal and more hetero
geneous than most. Most Stan
ford students are outstanding to
start with, and the fraternities
here tend to encourage leader
ship and diversity.
POPPY ADMITTED that the
level of enlightenment was prob
ably relatively high at Stanford.
He cited as evidence (he fact that
many nationals consider Stanford
a bad fraternity campus.
Still, he insisted, the supposed
advantages of fraternity affili
ation do not begin to compensate
for its negative effects on educa
tion and individual development.
The Harvard house system was
pointed out as a working alter
native system where these ef
fects are largely eliminated.
“People in this country are too
willing to be identified with a
group without knowing what the
group is doing and why. I would
prefer to see a man set his own
goals and be responsible to him
self rather than to a group.”
POPPY SUMMARIZED his po
sition with the statement that
“in the last analysis fraternities
do not add enough to a man’s
education and character to make
up for the risks they involve:
commitment to a group and a
system without understanding
what they are representing and
teaching.”
Does joining a fraternity set
a man up for three years of social
complacency, eliminating the ne
cessity to broaden his sphere of
friends and interests? Is the
pledge program indicative of the
fraternity’s encouragement of un
questioning conformity?
These are some of the ques
tions which were raised and dis
cussed last night by a panel fea
turing John Poppy, Senior Editor
of “Look” magazine and author
of a recent article attacking col
lege fraternities. Seated with
Poppy on the panel were IFC
president Ed Eschbach, Stern As
sistant Director Tom Boysen,
Wilbur Head Sponsor John Stein
bruner, and two fraternity presi
dents.
