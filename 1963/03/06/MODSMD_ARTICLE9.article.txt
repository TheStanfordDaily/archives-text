# Wilbur Freshman Falls Off Third Floor Balcony
## 
### ANN TODD 
Ronald Waller Kaiser, Arroyo
freshman, took a three-story fall
late yesterday afternoon while
trying to hit another freshman
on the second level of Junipero
with a water-balloon.
An ambulance was called to
Wilbur immediately after the
fall, between 4:30 and 5 p.m. Kai
ser was taken to Palo Alto Gen
eral Hospital where he was treat
ed in emergency until after seven
o’clock. Then he was officially
admitted for a “good night’s
sleep.”
The injuries of the freshman
from El Monte, California, mainly
consisted of bruises, pulled mus
cles and tendons, and a “mighty
sore rear end. I can't lie down.”
There were no serious injuries,
and recuperation will moan only
a few days rest.
WHEN ASKED how the acci
dent happened, Kaiser said, “Af
ter I threw the balloon, curiosity
got the better of me, and I leaned
over to see if I’d hit my target.
I slipped and flipped over the
railing. I didn’t manage to hang
on, hit my chin on the way down,
and fell on my feet. Then I rolled
over on my back.”
On the way down, he remem
bers thinking first of grabbing
for the railing. “When I missed
it. I began to remember how I
used to dream of falling that
way. It was quite a shock to
have it come true.”
As for how his water-balloon
toss came out, Kaiser laughed,
“I got him right square in the
belly.”
