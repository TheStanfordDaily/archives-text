INDIANS
Yesterday, we spoke
of everybody’s favor
ite campus shoe, the
desert boot. Now
here’s the hose to put
inside it— R A's own
crew socks. White ny
lon and cotton with
colored stripes around
the top for easy iden
tity in the wash, com
fortable cushioned
sole, and, best of all,
they s-f-r e-t-c-h to fit
any foot without
bunching or wrinkling.
What else can you
buy with so many at
tributes for a mere
buck a pair? So get
with it, today.
