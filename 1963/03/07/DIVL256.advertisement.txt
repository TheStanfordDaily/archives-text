1. According to the Department of
Labor, you’re worth over $350,000
as soon as you get your sheepskin.
That’s theoretical, of course.
2. The way they figure it, that
$'350,000 is how much the
average college graduate will
earn by the time he retires.
I didn’t even know the
Department was thinking
about me.
I’ll take it right now
in a lump sum. Would
I live! Penthouse. Yacht.
Homburg. The works.

3. As an Eco major, I feel obliged to
tell you what would happen to
that bundle. First, Uncle Sam
would help himself to about 290 Gs.
With the going rate for penthouses,
your life’s earnings would disappear
in one year.
4. Since you’d be only 22 )
couldn’t qualify for St
Security. You’d have t

5. Fortunately, there’s away out
for you.
Tell me—tell me.
Wcli, you won’t be getting all that
money in one year. You’ll be get
ting some of it each year, at a much
lower tax rate. What you should do is
put aside a certain amount of it.
6. Put some money into cash-value
insurance, the kind they call
Living Insurance at Equitable.
It gives your wife and kids solid
protection and it saves for you
automatically—builds a cash
fund you can use for retire
ment or any other purpose.
You Eco guys have
all the answers.
