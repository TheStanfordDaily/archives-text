Result: All 3-speed manual
transmissions in
Ford-built cars with V-B’s
now are fully synchronized
in each forward gear
To get more "go" in low, Ford engineers
were asked to upgrade the conventional
3-speed transmission to give drivers
more control in all three forward gears—
to make "low" a driving gear—and they
tackled the problem imaginatively,
Their achievement, another Ford First,
is the only U.S. 3-speed manual trans
mission with all three forward gears
fully synchronized I No need now to come
to a complete stop when you shift into
low—and no clashing gears! It lets you
keep more torque on tap for negotiating
sharp turns and steep grades, It makes
driving more flexible, more pleasurable.
Another assignment completed and
another example of how engineering
leadership at Ford provides fresh ideas
for the American Road.
