United Press International
WASHINGTON- President Kennedy said yesterday he is not
satisfied with the rate at which Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev
is pulling Russian troops out of Cuba. Kennedy told a new confer
ence that he did not have precise information on the number of Red
forces withdrawn but made it clear that they were not being pulled
out as fast as the United States wanted.
The President, however, ruled out for the time being a blockade
of Cuba to cut Soviet oil supplies to the island and weaken the
Castro regime. Kennedy said a blockade would lead to open arms
conflict with the Soviet “and at this time we do not believe that war
in the Caribbean is to the national advantage,” Shortly after the
President discussed the Cuban situation, Ma.j. Gen. Alva R. Fitch, the
Army’s chief of intelligence, said “there are no indications that
Soviet ground force units have departed from Cuba” other than
those assigned to the missiles which were withdrawn.
KENNEDY PREDICTS TAX BILL PASSAGE WASHINGTON—
President Kennedy predicted yesterday that Congress will pass a
tax cut bill including “important elements” of the revenue raising
reforms he has recommended. He flatly denied he has abandoned
his demands for reforms that would bring in $3.25 million to offset
the $13.5 billion fax reduction he has proposed. The President told
a news conference the combined lax cut and reform program he sub
mitted to Congress is the fairest, most equitable and fiscally re
sponsible approach. “What we will do will depend of course on
what kind of bill the Congress enacts," he said, “but my judgment
is that they will enact a tax reduction bill which will include im
portant elements of the reforms we sent up.”
I»E GAULLE. KENNEDY NOT TO MEET PARIS President
Charles de Gaulle has abandoned any thought of meeting with Presi
dent Kennedy soon, responsible French government sources said
yesterday. A Kennedy-De Gaulle meeting this year probably can be
ruled out, they said, because De Gaulle feels that United States and
French thinking on major issues at the moment is hopelessly far
apart. He sees no point in restating positions with which each is
familiar. The two most glaring issues currently poisoning U.S.-
French relations, in De Gaulle’s eyes, are the nuclear problem and
the Common Market.
