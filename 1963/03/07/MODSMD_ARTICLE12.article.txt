# CONCERT REVIEW
## 'Rigoletto' Production 'Commendable' 
### WALTER MOORE 
The most unique event on the ASSU Concert Series this
session took place Sunday afternoon in Memorial Auditorium
a performance of Guiseppe Verdi’s magnificent opera “Rigo
letto.” Presented by the Goldovsky Opera Theater, a mobile
group now touring the western states, this “Rigoletto” offered
much that was both musically and visually commendable.
Vocal honors go to John Robert Dunlap, who brought to
the title role a stylistic maturity and finesse which few singers
in the cast could approach. No stranger to this campus (he
created the role of Riviere in Stanford’s “Night Flight” just a
year ago), Dunlap possesses a beautiful voice which he colors
with taste and sensitivity. The appropriately legato flow of
sourrd he sustained in the second act duet with Gilda offers but
one compelling example of his vocally artistic portrayal, it was
all the more meaningful because every word of the excellent
English text could be easily understood.
As Gilda, Gwen Little contributed a beautifully poised and
well-considered characterization of the hunchback's daughter.
The voice is not remarkable, but this is a keenly musical and
intelligent singer who looks and moves well on the stage and
invites the respect of the audience by her expressive acting.
The Duke of Eric Davis revealed a well focused youthful tenor,
but the personality of the playboy is not yet clearly projected.
In shorter roles, David Giosso provided a properly sonorous
and sinister Sparafucile, while Gretchen Hilfreich as Gilda’s
nurse projected a voice of considerable beauty. The Naddalena
of Kathleen de Spain was visually attractive is vocally woolly,
and Marvin Klebe’s voice is simply too light for Monterone’s
weighty accusations. Comprimario roles were well taken and
the small chorus was excellent.
The performance was conducted by Boris Goldovsky, the
founder and director of the company. Much credit is due him for
his sure knowledge of the score and confident reading, but there
were more than a few instances of lax tempi and insecure en
semble. In demanding complete autonomy of his singers, i.e. no
assistance from the pit for entrances, cues, phrasing, etc., he has
sacrificed the conductor’s traditional role of controlling the
total musical performance. Whether this is a feasible means of
securing a thoroughly integrated presentation was not proven
by Sunday’s “Rigoletto.” It obviously suffered from the lack of
a central musical spark needed to unite music and cast into an
effective whole and which is usually supplied by the conductor.
Goldovsky’s staging was purposeful and direct and comple
mented the well-designed, if somewhat cramped, sets of Aristi
des Gazetas. The nineteen-piece orchestra proved inadequate for
the more violent climaxes, notably Rigoletto’s Act 111 aria in
which he denounces the courtiers. Otherwise they worked well
together and provided a decent approximation of Verdi’s beau
tifully orchestrated score.
Included in the opera were many welcome passages usually
omitted from modern performances. Especially notable were
the complete cadenza to the duet between Gilda arid the Duke in
Act 11. and the cabaletta to the Duke’s aria in Act 111, a dramatic
ally valuable piece, although not one of Verdi’s greatest in
spirations. The presentation was warmly received.

semble. In demanding complete autonomy of his singers, i.e. no
assistance from the pit for entrances, cues, phrasing, etc., he has
sacrificed the conductor’s traditional role of controlling the
total musical performance. Whether this is a feasible means of
securing a thoroughly integrated presentation was not proven
by Sunday’s “Rigoletto.” It obviously suffered from the lack of
a central musical spark needed to unite music and cast into an
effective whole and which is usually supplied by the conductor.
Goldovsky’s staging was purposeful and direct and comple
mented the well-designed, if somewhat cramped, sets of Aristi
des Gazetas. The nineteen-piece orchestra proved inadequate for
the more violent climaxes, notably Rigoletto’s Act 111 aria in
which he denounces the courtiers. Otherwise they worked well
together and provided a decent approximation of Verdi’s beau
tifully orchestrated score.
Included in the opera were many welcome passages usually
omitted from modern performances. Especially notable were
the complete cadenza to the duet between Gilda arid the Duke in
Act 11. and the cabaletta to the Duke’s aria in Act 111, a dramatic
ally valuable piece, although not one of Verdi’s greatest in
spirations. The presentation was warmly received.
The most unique event on the ASSU Concert Series this
session took place Sunday afternoon in Memorial Auditorium
a performance of Guiseppe Verdi’s magnificent opera “Rigo
letto.” Presented by the Goldovsky Opera Theater, a mobile
group now touring the western states, this “Rigoletto” offered
much that was both musically and visually commendable.
Vocal honors go to John Robert Dunlap, who brought to
the title role a stylistic maturity and finesse which few singers
in the cast could approach. No stranger to this campus (he
created the role of Riviere in Stanford’s “Night Flight” just a
year ago), Dunlap possesses a beautiful voice which he colors
with taste and sensitivity. The appropriately legato flow of
sourrd he sustained in the second act duet with Gilda offers but
one compelling example of his vocally artistic portrayal, it was
all the more meaningful because every word of the excellent
English text could be easily understood.
As Gilda, Gwen Little contributed a beautifully poised and
well-considered characterization of the hunchback's daughter.
The voice is not remarkable, but this is a keenly musical and
intelligent singer who looks and moves well on the stage and
invites the respect of the audience by her expressive acting.
The Duke of Eric Davis revealed a well focused youthful tenor,
but the personality of the playboy is not yet clearly projected.
In shorter roles, David Giosso provided a properly sonorous
and sinister Sparafucile, while Gretchen Hilfreich as Gilda’s
nurse projected a voice of considerable beauty. The Naddalena
of Kathleen de Spain was visually attractive is vocally woolly,
and Marvin Klebe’s voice is simply too light for Monterone’s
weighty accusations. Comprimario roles were well taken and
the small chorus was excellent.
The performance was conducted by Boris Goldovsky, the
founder and director of the company. Much credit is due him for
his sure knowledge of the score and confident reading, but there
were more than a few instances of lax tempi and insecure en
semble. In demanding complete autonomy of his singers, i.e. no
