## Chinese Poetry Anthology Portrays Social Revolution 
### GEORGE GUY 
Twentieth Century Chinese Poetry, Edited and translated
by Kai-yn Hsu, New York: Doubleday, Mareh, 1063. 434 pp.

In this anthology of the writings of 45 named and unnamed
poets and nineteen folksongs is portrayed the most convulsive
social revolution of this century. The panorama of the suffer
ings, struggle, and triumphs of 700 million people is vividly, ex
cruciatingly, and beautifully painted in song and verse. The
scope of the anthology is at once too vast and too varied; it is
impossible to do justice to the work in a few short paragraphs.
All one can hope to do is give a few impressionistic flashes to
spotlight individual aspects of the social background.
Long before the turn of the century the internal forces of
traditional China were slowly building up towards a climax. Had
the country been left to herself, the cataclysmic changes of the
last quarter century might have been delayed for some time.
Given the positive and negative pressures exerted from without,
the process of change came much faster, with greater thorough
ness and fearsome energy. Western ideas, as much as gunboats,
contributed to the process. The gunboats and cheap manufac
tured goods were the first influence felt. The former made it
patently clear that the traditional Chinese political structure was
not viable against an aggressive and dynamic West. The latter
only aggravated the tottering institutions by undermining the
economic base of a semi-feudal society.
The impact of these powerful forces unleashed the latent
internal social forces, bringing into being the ugliest form of in
fant capitalism and foreign imperialism, war-lordism, and social
disintegration. But the very same outside pressures also brought
about a young generation of restless and searching intelligentsia
whose thoughts and visions were crucial to the transformation
that shook the country to its very rice roots.
Members of this new intelligentsia were as capable of start
ing uprisings as they were literary movements, equally likely
to take up aims as to take up the pen. Quite often they did both.
When they took up the pen the results cannot be expected to
disguise the white hot social currents of their time. Thus it is
that in the pages of this anthology of the poetry of twentieth
century China, almost without exception, the authors were
crucially influenced by the events of their time. Few and far be
tween are the strictly meditative or purely artistic poets. There
just wasn’t time nor interest to afford the luxury of intellectual
dilettantism. Whatever their answers to the pressing questions
before them, the writers of twentieth-century China were far
too embittered, far too angered, far too frustrated, and above
all far too concerned and aware of the historic process to waste
their energy on trivia. An undercurrent of tension is built up as
one reads the developing style of each poet, or the growth and
decay of each literary school.
This undercurrent of tension and development goes through
very distinct phases. From the early painful poetry, to the de
fiant voice of the middle period, down finally to the heroic
post-1949 era. The choice of the word “era” is intended. The
break was too sharp, the transformation too complete, for any
casual reader to fail to notice.
It is notable that only in poetry is the agony of a changing
nation so intimately recorded. How better could one record, for
instance, the scene of a mother who blinds her son so that he
might escape the rapacious conscript system, or the suicide of
a young girl “teaching languages” in a hotel? The historian
cannot find headings to tabulate these statistics; the poet can.
How does one even begin to grasp the reality of millions of
starving peasants after a flood or in the wake of a warlord’s
army? It remained for the angry young poets to chronicle this
reality. Then, finally, how does, one record the vision and aspira
tion of a lesurgent people? It is customary to dismiss, and great
fun to laugh at, poetry about the worker who falls in love with
his machine. It is a great surprise that even by merely sampling
this anthology one could actually appreciate the significance and
validity of socialist realism.
Professor Hsu (Ph.D. Stanford, 1959) has done an admirable
job of balancing and selecting the authors and their works for
inclusion, ranging from Hu Shih to Mao Tse-tung. The trans
lations (probably intentionally) tend towards fidelity and liter
alness. and unavoidably something intangible is lost; neverthe
less, they are ingenious, and often very well done. The 44 pages
of introduction are valuable, and the biographical sketches well
written. The bibliograhy provides a helpful research tool. The
small collection of contemporary folksongs is indeed a very de
lightful bonus.
The above evaluation may give the impression that there is
little poetry but much contemporary history in the book. This
would be a sad mistake. The simple truth is that the color and
the substance of history have been instilled in song and verse,
often quite beautifully.
