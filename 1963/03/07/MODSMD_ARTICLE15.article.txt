## IFC Weaknesses Apparent 
### RICK SEIFERT Staff Editor 
After delivering a campaign speech immersed in a slough of
disappointment over the general ineffectiveness of the Inter-
Fraternity Council in the past year, Don Haider emerged from
Monday night’s election as the new president of IFC. His prob
lem now, of course, is to vitalize an organization that has been
shackled by its reactoinary character.
If the IFC were to react against the doings of other campus
organizations then it would at least fulfill some role in the
community. Instead the group finds itself in best form reacting
against itself. The classic example of course is the present rush
system which the IFC passed and then rejected only to have the
program forced upon them by the administration. As Rick Swen
son, one of the candidates for the office of IFC president put
it: “If we can’t solve our own problems, someone else will step
in and do it for us.” Unfortunately the new rush system didn’t
solve the problem of rush but only intensified it.
The weakness of the IFC stems from a disunity among
fraternities, a disunity that is inherent to the fraternity system
itself. Rush, the means of perpetuating each of the living groups,
sets house against house in a fierce competition for members.
It is simply too much to ask for the 24 houses to come together
on Monday nights and to march in unison.
To complicate the problem, each house has an image to
maintain, an image that it feels compelled to force upon the
IFC. As a result, frustration at IFC meetings mounts as the
turmoil is heightened. In desperation, the group usually forces
through a compromise measure that is worse than the results
of taking no action at all. Again, the new rush program is an
excellent example. Then the realization of what they have done
usually is apparent or made apparent to the representatives, and
the next week they come back to undo the previous week’s work.
All of which, according to Swenson again, “leads to zero respect”
on the campus, and an overwhelming ineffectiveness.
