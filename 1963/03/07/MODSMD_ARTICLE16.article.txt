Editors, The Daily:
The article concerning Dr, Frederick Terman’s lecture in the
Tuesday Evening Series illustrated an “If you want peace, pre
pare for war’’ philosophy. While these words were once a motto
of the Roman Empire, like the Roman Empire, they are no more.
Certainly many of Dr. Terman’s ideas concern Stanford’s
efforts to provide well-trained scientists in order to strengthen
this country militarily. And eventually those ideas will further
creep into the PACE program and the continued trend of more
and more money to Science at Stanford will be further main
tained. But which way are we PACE-ing? Some answers, not
necessarily many of the answers, but possibly some answers,
may lie in studying the humanities.
