### VICTORIA NICOL 
“My dear Chief’ wrote Presi
dent Sterling to the Honorable
Herbert Hoover, congratulating
him on the receipt of the Herbert
Ho /er award, the highest honor
bet awed by the Stanford alumni,
“ . J. it is singularly appropri
ate that this medal should bear
yo 1 name and that you should
be he first recipient of it.”
1 erbert Hoover’s accomplish
m< fs and contributions to Stan
foi I University are well known,
an indeed merit the honor
wl ch has been given him. But
th award is also singularly ap
pr priate because of the degree
to vhich Herbert Hoover is an in
to ral part of the Stanford spirit.

bi It is one of the most memora
bl part of every Freshman’s in
it ,1 orientation to Stanford.
T ese things are a definite part

of the impressions of Stanford
which we have and retain with us
when we leave.
Even as an undergraduate Hoo
ver had captured the unique spir
it of Stanford. He came to the
campus in 1891 at the age of 17,
and decided to major in engineer
ing—a trend which has become
part of the Stanford tradition for
undergraduate men.
Of these years he says “I was
able to carry an unusual amount

—for engineers—of instruction
in history, economics, and Eng
lish and French literature ... I
do not recollect that I ever at
tained “A” grades in any of
them.” What could be more defi
nitely a part of the Stanford ex
perience.
HOOVER’S TIME was mostly
taken up with outside activities.
As he put it, he had “too many
other yens and occupations in
non-curricular activities.” He was
an orphan and had the task of
supporting himself which he did
by running a laundry service,
having a paper route, and or
ganizing a lecture service.
He also worked in the labora
tory for Dr. Branner who was a
geology professor at the time. It
is difficult to determine, how
ever. whether Hoover classified
this as a “yen” or an “occupa
tion,” for it is here that he met
the future Mrs. Hoover.
AMONG HIS memories of his
undergraduate days Hoover re

Commencement exercises where
I was to got the degree which I
thought was vital to my future
life, the Registrar of the Univer
sity dug up the fact that I still

Hoover did, of course, receive
his diploma, but this small inci
dent serves again to demonstrate
how completely Hoover has
shared in the Stanford experi
ence, how definitely he repre
sents the spirit of Stanford.


HERBE T HOOVER receives the congratulations of Wallace Sterling for his reception of the Herbert
Hoove Medal for Distinguished Service. Hoover became the first alumnus elected to the Board
of Tru fees in 1912. Hoover is presently honorary chairman of the PACE Program.
