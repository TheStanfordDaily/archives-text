# S.F. Seals on Verge of Hockey Title
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
It took the Giants four years
to win a championship since the
National League arrived in San
Francisco. But it may take just
half that period of time for a
later addition to the San Fracis
co sports family, the professional
hockey Seals, to accomplish that
same feat.
It is currently the second year
since the Western Hockey League
expanded south, to San Francisco
and Los Angeles, and with the

season better than three-fourths
complete, (he S.F. Seals, at 37-
20-1, are tied for the lead in the
southern division.

THKIR POSITION is actually
stronger than a tie might indi
cate. because they have played
two games fewer than the co
holder of first place, the Portland
Buckaroos, since hockey stand
ings are computed on a point
basis (two points per win, one
per tie, and zero per loss), the
Seals can lose no ground and
stand to gain up to four points
when they make up those two
games. Thus, at this late date,
San Francisco is in the best posi
tion to win its division.
This prospect is amazing con
sidering the Seals’ miserable road
trip (3-9) last November, which
kept them busy fighting to stay
out of last place during the first
month of the season. Since then,
Coach Bud Poile has regrouped
his players and come on to over

take Portland; the Seals have
won 19 of their last 23, and actu
ally led the division for four
days.
THE SEALS are probably the
roughest team in the league, in
timidating their opponents with
enthusiastic blocks Into the re
straining walls, frequent brawls,
and a high accumlation of penal
ty minutes. Foremost among the
Seals’ beef-trust is defenseman
Larry McNabb, who leads the
WHL in penalty minutes with
122. Other individual stars are
forward Nick Nickoski, the
league-leader in goals and total
points, and Orland Kurtenbach,
Ed Panagabko, and Duke Ed
mundson, all in the WHL’s top
ten scorers.
San Francisco plays a vital
game in Portland this Saturday
ion KTVU-TV) and returns to
the Cow Palace next Wednesday
and Friday to play Seattle, the
leader in the northern division.


SAN FRANCISCO SEALS GOALIE makes a diving save against the LA Blades in a recent game at
the Cow Palace. The Seals in their second season are currently tied for the lead in the Western
Hockey league. Defenseman Phil Jackson cleverly screens an LA forward from a possible rebound.
