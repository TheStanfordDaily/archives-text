# Tresidder Gets the Profits From Peanuts in the Cluster
## 
### MIKE SAKS 
Every time you buy a candy bar, ice cream sandwich, or a
pack of cigarettes in a Canteen vending machine, yon are eon
tiUniting to tresidder Memorial Union. And, you either buy your
snacks in a Canteen vending machine or you go without. Such
conditions do not happen by accident. Stanford has a policy about
vending machines. A ruling dat-*

ing back to 1953 states that “a
machine is installed for the gen
eral welfare of the University
and not for the profit of any in
dividual or group.”
The University decided that
since every purchase in a vending
machine takes away a potential
customer from the student union,
the profits from the machines
should go to the Union.
THIS IS WHY academic de
partments or living groups are
not allowed to keep the profits
from vending machines on their
premises. There are a few places
on campus where this does not
hold because the machines come
under a “grandfather clause.”
Now, all applications for vending
machines are processed through
the Union business office.
A man high up in Union man
agement maintains that there is
no vending machine monopoly on
campus. After a six-month study,
the University decided that the 13
vending machine concessioners
on campus were not returning an
adequate amount of their profits
to the University and that service
was inefficient. To remedy the
confused situation, the purchas
ing department received competi
tive bids from the five largest
vending machine firms.
“THERE IS NO monopoly as if

they wore here to stay,” the Un
ion official said. The contract is
let on a year to year basis. Now
the University enjoys a more lu
crative contract and better serv
ice.
When the Union receives a re
quest for a machine installation,
a Union representative and the
Canteen people investigate the
site to see if setting up a machine
would bo possible or profitable.
He said that the Union tries to
be fair to both the asking group
and the Canteen company. Each
machine must make a certain
minimum per month to break
\ even. This minimum varies with
| the type of machine. Coffee or
cup machines are particularly
costly to service. If the coffee sits
around in the machine too long,
people complain.
Servicing and stocking the
vending machines now requires
a full-time supervisor on campus.
| Routemen work seven days a
i week to keep the machines filled.

Now, all applications for vending
machines are processed through
the Union business office.
A man high up in Union man
agement maintains that there is
no vending machine monopoly on
campus. After a six-month study,
the University decided that the 13
vending machine concessioners
on campus were not returning an
adequate amount of their profits
to the University and that service
was inefficient. To remedy the
confused situation, the purchas
ing department received competi
tive bids from the five largest
vending machine firms.
“THERE IS NO monopoly as if

they wore here to stay,” the Un
ion official said. The contract is
let on a year to year basis. Now
the University enjoys a more lu
crative contract and better serv
ice.
When the Union receives a re
quest for a machine installation,
a Union representative and the
Canteen people investigate the
site to see if setting up a machine
would bo possible or profitable.
He said that the Union tries to
be fair to both the asking group
and the Canteen company. Each
machine must make a certain
minimum per month to break
\ even. This minimum varies with
| the type of machine. Coffee or
cup machines are particularly
costly to service. If the coffee sits
around in the machine too long,
people complain.
Servicing and stocking the
vending machines now requires
a full-time supervisor on campus.
| Routemen work seven days a
i week to keep the machines filled.
Every time you buy a candy bar, ice cream sandwich, or a
pack of cigarettes in a Canteen vending machine, yon are eon
tiUniting to tresidder Memorial Union. And, you either buy your
snacks in a Canteen vending machine or you go without. Such
conditions do not happen by accident. Stanford has a policy about
vending machines. A ruling dat-*

ing back to 1953 states that “a
machine is installed for the gen
eral welfare of the University
and not for the profit of any in
dividual or group.”
The University decided that
since every purchase in a vending
machine takes away a potential
customer from the student union,
the profits from the machines
should go to the Union.
THIS IS WHY academic de
partments or living groups are
not allowed to keep the profits
from vending machines on their
premises. There are a few places
on campus where this does not
hold because the machines come
under a “grandfather clause.”
