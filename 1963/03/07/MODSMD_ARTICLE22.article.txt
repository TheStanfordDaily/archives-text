## Theta Delts Outlast Delts for League Title 
### DOUGLAS SCHWAB 
Theta Delt clearly proved their
basketball prowess Monday night
as they scored a 42-32 victory
over Delta Tan Delta. The victory
j gives Theta Delta Chi the cham
pionship of their league, with a
| perfect 5-0 record. Although the
Theta Delts were at a disadvan
tage in both height and brute
strength, a consistently controlled
offense, alertness, and speed
proved to make the difference.

Trailing 27-15 at halftime, the
Delts semed unable to capitalize
on their obvious assets, namely
the height and strength of Dick
Leeuwenberg playing the post. In
the second half, primarily by con
sistent feeding to Leeuwenberg.
j the Delts outscored the Theta
j Delts, 17-15.
j This second half advantage was
unable to overcome tremendous
playing by Munn Chin, Bob Stro
hecker. and Steve King of the
I Theta Delts. These three played
j a great game, very wide awake
! and able to capitalize on the nu
merous Delt ball control errors.
Strohecker led the game scor
ing with 16 points, and King,
along with Phil Wagner of the
I Delts, had 11.
! The powerful Theta Delts use
i a Villanova-type offense. Big,
| burly strong rebounding for
wards and center, set up picks
for small, fast guards, who are
amazingly accurate with jump
shots from fifteen or twenty feet.
Thus, the box score will show a
j preponderance of scoring in the
j backcourt (Strohecker and Chin
| are both guards),
j There are three methods of
rendering such an offense inop
| erable. The opposing team may
| try to break through the picks,
j or lineup in a tight zone defense
forcing the screens to be set fur
ther outside and thus cutting
down on the accuracy of shots
taken from behind them. Thirdly,
J they can hope that the opposing
guards will have a bad night. The
Delts imprudently .chose this last
alternative.
