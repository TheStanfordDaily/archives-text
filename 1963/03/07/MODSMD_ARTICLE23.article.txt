# Ten Stanford Swimmers Enter AAWU Championships in L.A.
## 
### 
Stanford's regular season is [
over but the conference cham
pionships, to be held al UCLA to
day, tomorrow, and Saturday, are
about to begin. The AAWLI cham
pionship is decided on a total
point basis. Thus the team with
the most swimmers who can
either win or place will be the
eventual conference champion.
This is as it should be, but it
hurts Stanford chances, for
though some Indian swimmers
I are the best on the coast in their
I particular events, the squad lacks
both balance and depth.
U.S.C. must he conceded the
winner almost before the races
| begin, for even if the top Trojan
| swimmers are upset. Southern
Cal will pile up enough second I
and third places to win.
However. Stanford and Wash-;
ington will vie for second place, i
If the Indians can continue to |
perform as they have for the past
two weeks, Stanford must he
rated a favorite over the Huskies.
Marty Hull and I Ilka Suvanto
established their West Coast su
premacy in the butterfly and dis
tance freestyle events against
U.S.C. Hopefully each can be
counted on to win two events.
Moreover, the medley relay team
sot a new Stanford record in the
Southern Cal meet with a time
which would have placed them
second in last year’s nationals.
Thus the relay team should at
least place if not win.
Coach Jim Gaughran has

named nine swimmers and a
diver to represent the university:
Suvanto, Hull. Pete Pettigrew,
Paul Hait, Mike Doscher, Tom
Morgan, Bill Lorton. Ron Kovas. ,
Dave Giidea and diver John Thiel
bahr.
Of these ten only Hait and |
Morgan are seniors. Next year's ' •
team will thus have eight re- |
turnees. Moreover, help from Ihe|
Frosh squad is in sight. Diver |
Bill Freeman, freestyler Bill |
Schubach, Don Shanley (back
stroke) and Paul Westling
(breaststroke) are a group which
should bolster the undermanned j
team, providing at least a partial j
panacea for the depth problem.

Suvanto, Hull. Pete Pettigrew,
Paul Hait, Mike Doscher, Tom
Morgan, Bill Lorton. Ron Kovas. ,
Dave Giidea and diver John Thiel
bahr.
Of these ten only Hait and |
Morgan are seniors. Next year's ' •
team will thus have eight re- |
turnees. Moreover, help from Ihe|
Frosh squad is in sight. Diver |
Bill Freeman, freestyler Bill |
Schubach, Don Shanley (back
stroke) and Paul Westling
(breaststroke) are a group which
should bolster the undermanned j
team, providing at least a partial j
panacea for the depth problem.
