# Boyle Discusses Attitudes of Artist; Comments on Show of Bay Area Art

### KATHLEEN FARGO 
“The contemporary artist has detached himself and his work
from any preconceived social, political, or religious objectives. He
creates an art object with nothing more in mind than stimulating
his further creation." Basing his lecture on these ideas. Profes
sor Keith Boyle discussed “Allusion, Parody, and Quotation in

♦
A COLLAGE, “Winter,” by De
lap is an example of both quota
tion and allusion. The principle of
quotation is established by the
fact that he uses paper as the
principle medium of his work. In
addition, Delap makes allusions
to the forms of cubism as well as
to other contemporary art forms.
Boyle preferred this work to that
j of Pinkerton because he felt that
j it has a more elegant surface.
A COPPER PLATE print by
Ihle deals primarily with the
principle of quotation. The con
tral figure is a kind of bird im
age which may be the Phoenix,
for it seems to be dissolving and
reappearing. Ihle is therefore re
ferring to a literary figure of
long tradition.
Boyle stated that viewing art
is difficult because we approach
art with certain preconceptions,
and some art may bother us if it
doesn’t seem to us what art
should be. He discussed the works
from the standpoint of an artist,
in terms of how they stimulated
him in relation to his own work.
Boyle’s talk was given in con
nection with the current exhibit
of Bay Area art which will be on
display upstairs in Tresidder un
til March 23. The collection of
I prints, paintings, drawings, and
sculpture is from the Art Bank
lof the San Francisco Art Insti
jtute, an institution which was
I founded to make the work of Bay
j Area and West Coast artists
available to out-of-town museums
'and collectors.

Boyle defined allusion as a ref
erence to something without def
inite mention of it, parody as a
trivial or comical imitation of
something serious, and quotation
as a direct reference to another
work of art.
In his discussion, he considered
four works which are now on dis
play in Tresidder as a part of the
exhibit of contemporary Bay
Area art.
THE FIRST WORK, "One for
Every Time She Broke My
Heart,” is a collection of multiple
images flowers, an old-fashioned
photograph, Victorian legs
which evoke images from our
memory of experience about
these objects. The objects the
artist has used are translated
from visual images to word im
ages by the viewer. Boyle stated
that it is nearly impossible, how
ever, to know the artist’s intent
in an object of art.
The viewer also receives a word
imago from a small painting by
Pinkerton which is dominated by
the printed word, “Yankee.” Ac
cording to Boyle, this work bor
ders between parody and allusion.
The word “Yankee." the dead
black background, the crude and
awkward letters, the vile colors,
all have connotations for the
viewer. The artist presents the
word “Yankee” but says nothing
more about it and thus allows
the observer to let the allusions
carry him off on some wild fan
tasy.
