Twenty-five paintings from the
touring exhibit "New Directions
of Art from South America” will
be displayed in Tresidder Union
March 12-27. These paintings are
i a part of a 44-piece collection
! which has been shown all over
' the nation under the sponsorship
of Kaiser Industries.
The collection, which is present
ly being exhibited at the Oakland
An Museum in Oakland, repre
sents the work of 19 artists. Each
picture was selected from the
first South American Art Bien
nal held in Cordoba, Argentina.
' lasl year. Artists from Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay are
represented in the exhibit.
According to Janet Cuthbert
' son, exhibit chairman of the cul
tural arts division at Tresidder,
| all 19 of the artists will be repre
sented at the Stanford showing.
Two of Raquel Forner’s grand
prize winning works. “The Astro
naut” and “Those Who Look At
the Moon," will be in the exhibit.
I Miss Forner’s three paintings
I swept lop honors at the Biennial.
Nearly all of the paintings
j place a heavy accent on interna-
I tional abstraction, as the titles of
I Miss Forner’s two works would

suggest. Aside from this limiting
feature, neither the art critic of
The Oakland Tribune or The San
Francisco Examiner could find
any major faults in the collection.
'l'lie former wrote. “The exhibit
is abstract, sophisticated, techni
cally skillful and often deeply
emotional.” And the latter called
J the entire exhibit “ambitious,
high-grade art of the avant-garde
I type.”
Within the framework of inter
national abstraction, several
styles are represented. Miss For
tier dotes on the theme of inter
planetary flight with the result
ing contrasts of total black and
flooding white light; Fernandez
Mura uses black and red-pink dots
in her works, a feature which one
critic called “the photoengraving
process”; and Jose Gamarra’s
paintings are quite literal and in
ventive. with a style that has
best been described as “mono
chrome architecture.”
The picture that will probably
draw the most comment, how
ever. is “Sleep or Death” by Ro
mulo Maccio of Argentina. His
“new image” style features the
figures of a horrified female and
a creature with bloody teeth and
ja primitively drawn skeletal
body. This work took fourth
I place at the Biennial.
