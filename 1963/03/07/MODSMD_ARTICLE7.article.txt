## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Providing funds can be obtained, a dozen Stanford students,
yet to be selected, will be sent to Washington, D.C., this summer
to assist various Congressmen in legislative research, writing
speeches, and preparing for committee hearings.
Sen. Frank Church of Idaho (class of ’47), Sen. Lee Metcalf of
Montana (class of ’36), Rep. Edith*- ——

Green of Oregon (graduate class
of ’44), Steve Horn (class of ’53),
legislative assistant to Sen. Ku
chel, and Win Griffith (former
Daily editor), press aid to Sen.
Humphrey of Minnesota, have
tentatively offered to employ se
lected Stanford students as “in
terns” on Capitol Hill for the
summer, according to ASSU pres
ident Armin Rosencranz.
THE INTERN program, model
ed after similar programs at
Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Welles
ley, Vassar, and Mt. Holyoke,
would be the first of its kind in
the West. Under the present plan,
applications from students who
will have at least junior standing
by next fall will be processed by
an Advisory Board composed of
students, faculty, administration,
and alumni.
There will bo a meeting of all
those interested in learning more
about the program at 10 p.m. this
evening in Bowman Alumni
House. Applications will be avail
able.
The idea for Stanford in Wash
ington originated last Spring with
Jamie Hunter, a law student who
had been student chairman of a
similar program at Yale. Specific
job offerings materialized last
week following interviews by
ASSU president Rosencranz with
various congressmen and their
legislative assistants in Washing
ton.
THE ADVISORY Board will
have three functions. First,
through the University Alumni
Association and other University
offices, it will attempt to secure

funds and provide access to pro
spective employers. Second, it,
will select those internships
which it is able to finance with
the secured funds. Third, it will
select those applications most ap
propriate for each internship and
send these to the prospective em
ployer, who will then make the
final choice.
NOTE: LEGISLATURE will
meet tonight in Bowman Alumni
House, not in room 271 as previ
ously scheduled. Appropriations
and the censorship of Ram’s Hoad
productions will be discussed.

Providing funds can be obtained, a dozen Stanford students,
yet to be selected, will be sent to Washington, D.C., this summer
to assist various Congressmen in legislative research, writing
speeches, and preparing for committee hearings.
Sen. Frank Church of Idaho (class of ’47), Sen. Lee Metcalf of
Montana (class of ’36), Rep. Edith*- ——

Green of Oregon (graduate class
of ’44), Steve Horn (class of ’53),
legislative assistant to Sen. Ku
chel, and Win Griffith (former
Daily editor), press aid to Sen.
Humphrey of Minnesota, have
tentatively offered to employ se
lected Stanford students as “in
terns” on Capitol Hill for the
summer, according to ASSU pres
ident Armin Rosencranz.
THE INTERN program, model
ed after similar programs at
Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Welles
ley, Vassar, and Mt. Holyoke,
would be the first of its kind in
the West. Under the present plan,
applications from students who
will have at least junior standing
by next fall will be processed by
an Advisory Board composed of
students, faculty, administration,
and alumni.
There will bo a meeting of all
those interested in learning more
about the program at 10 p.m. this
evening in Bowman Alumni
House. Applications will be avail
able.
The idea for Stanford in Wash
ington originated last Spring with
Jamie Hunter, a law student who
had been student chairman of a
similar program at Yale. Specific
job offerings materialized last
week following interviews by
ASSU president Rosencranz with
various congressmen and their
legislative assistants in Washing
ton.
THE ADVISORY Board will
have three functions. First,
through the University Alumni
Association and other University
offices, it will attempt to secure

funds and provide access to pro
spective employers. Second, it,
will select those internships
which it is able to finance with
the secured funds. Third, it will
select those applications most ap
propriate for each internship and
send these to the prospective em
ployer, who will then make the
final choice.
