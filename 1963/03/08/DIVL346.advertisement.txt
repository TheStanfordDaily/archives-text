Does a man really take unfair advantage of women
when he uses Mennen Skin Bracer?
All depends on why he uses it.
Most men simply think Menthol-Iced Skin Bracer is the best
after-shave lotion around. Because it cools rather than burns.
Because it helps heal shaving nicks and scrapes. Because it
helps prevent blemishes.
So who can blame them if Bracer’s crisp, long-lasting aroma
just happens to affect women so remarkably?
Of course, some men may use Mennen Skin Bracer because
of this effect.
