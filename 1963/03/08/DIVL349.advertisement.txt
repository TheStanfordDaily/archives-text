W<£Q>-:
How do we thank such a man as this ?
The railroad hat is deceptive. Bill Schupbach is a
lifetime Standard Oiler, retired. His grandfather,
father and uncle were Standard Oilers before him.
Before retiring, Bill was a refinery foreman. His
company retirement plan gives him security, and
time for model railroading, but his big enthusiasm is
still Standard Oil Company.
Bill keeps close to us, and we to him. He is invited
to our picnics and parties, receives our publications,
and is still one of the “Boys” at the refinery. He
knows that he belongs.
It isn’t the spoken thanks that do it; but your
lasting interest in a man, your counting him as a
person and not a statistic, these are the things (hat
liven his spirit.
We have thousands of such fine men and women on
our retirement payroll. If you know some of them,
you know that they, too, are ardent
Standard Oilers,
