Skip the sulphur and molasses—
get a CHEVROLET SUPER SPORT
Chevrolet Super Sports* have a charm that
soothes your springtime yen for romantic
adventure as fast as you can slip into a
bucket seat. (Especially the Impala’s, with
its adjustable new Comfortilt steering
wheel*.) Front bucket seats are
a great start, but Super Sports
also feature plush all-vinyl in
teriors, special interior-exterior
trim in tasteful touches, and a
veritable feast of goodies we call
performance options*. Chev
rolet and Chevy II Super Sports
invite adventure in convertible
or coupe form. That same Super
SUPER
SPORT
Sport zing applies to the Corvair Monza
Spyder, very breezy with its air-cooled 150-
horsepower rear-mounted engine, and 4-
speed shift*. Ditto for the new Corvette Sting
Ray, a magnificent thoroughbred among
pure-blood sports cars with not
asinglesacrificein comfort. Both
Spyder and Sting Ray come in
coupe or convertible styles. All
Chevrolet Super Sports are like
spring days—you’ve got to get
out in them to savor them. So
catch yourself a passing zephyr
and waft on down to your
Chevrolet showroom.
