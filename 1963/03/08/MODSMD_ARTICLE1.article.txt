# Latin America Interest Inspires Living System
## 
### HOLT RUFFIN 
The past two weeks have witnessed the birth and grow th of a
novel and possibly highly repercussive housing idea. Feeling that
Latin America is one of the most important yet one of the most
neglected and misunderstood of all the world areas, three Stan
ford students, Stu Rawlings, Fred Goff, and Holt Ruffin, have
drawn up a plan named Opera ♦

cion Panamerica.
Under this plan students with
a strong interest in Latin Ameri
ca would live together through
out the school year. About six of
these would be Latin American
exchange students.
Spanish-speaking meal tables,
a group of mariachis, a short

wave radio to receive transmis
sions in Spanish and Portuguese,
a soccer team, publications and
commentaries, lounge decoration
in a certain Latin American
theme these are but a few of
the activities which have already
been suggested.
Speakers such as Phillip Ray,
John Collier, and Tad Szulc have
been contacted in hopes that they
might come to Stanford next year
to speak at the Latin America
house. When consulted on this
idea during a recent visit, Tad
Szulc, the New York Times spe
cialist in Latin Americart affairs,
expressed great enthusiasm and
explained that he had been sug
gesting a similar program for
years.

During the year various groups
in the house would work on proj
ects such as setting up a "Cross
roads Latin America” and a
spring vacation work camp in
Mexico. The house would also
work in conjunction with Bolivar
House, the center for Hispanic
American and Luso-Brazilian
studies, and the Latin American
Desk of the HR.
Those interested in such a liv
ing arrangement should contact
either Stu Rawlings, Fred Goff
or Holt Ruffin.
