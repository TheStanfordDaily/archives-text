# 'Domestic Peace Corps Needs Bold Approach'
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
“The Domestic Peace Corps, ;
orous program. If the program :
have to be approached in a moi
than is presently being contemp
min Rosencranz at Legislature’s

as planned, is not a bold and vig
is to accomplish its goals it will
re extensive and forceful manner
dated,” said ASSU President Ar
meeting last night. Rosencranz,
"reporting on his attendance at the
NSA conference on the National
Service Corps in Washington last
week, indicated that the delegates
voted overwhelmingly to reject
a clause in the plans for the Na
tional Service Corps giving states
veto power over the requests of
localities for assistance.
The delegates also discussed
the question of requests lor as
sistance by segregated institu
tions. A resolution to refuse as
sistance to segregated institutions
was defeated on the grounds that
integration is not the purpose of
the National Service Corps and
riders combating segregation
were not appropriate.
ROSENCRANZ said that the
initial presentation by the direc
tors of the Corps had given the
delegates the impression that
they were there “to soak up in
formation and squeeze it out back
on campus rather than critically
evaluate the National Service
Corps.”
Rosencranz also reported on
his interviews with various Con
gressmen concerning the Stan
ford-in-Washington plan for stu
dent internships during the sum
mer. A number of Congressmen,
including Senators Church of Ida
ho and Metcalf of Montana, Stan
ford adumni, were enthused about,
the program and said they would
accept student interns if the
funds could be provided.
UNDER THE present plan, ap
plications from students who will
have at least junior standing by
next fall will be processed by an
Advisory Board composed of stu
dents, faculty, administration,
and alumni. This board will se
lect those applications most ap
propriate for each internship po
sition available and send these
applications to the prospective
employers, who will then make
the final choices.
The Advisory Board is com
posed of Dr. Robert Wert, Vice
Provost, Julio Hirsh, Student-
Alumni Coordinator, and Profes
sors Herbert Packer (Law), Mar
tin Shapiro (Political Science),
and Don Fehrenbacher (History).
Jamie Hunter, Heath Chamber
lain, Armin Rosencranz, Susan
Westerberg, and William Butler,
all of whom have been involved
in developing the intern program,
are the students on the Advisory
Board.
BV A 10-4 VOTE, Legislature

the Authority of the Board of
Trustees of Stanford University,

The clause in bolf face was
added to correct a stylistic over
sight. A second recommended
change in wording, to add inclu

ASSU president, “The president

change rather than a stylistic
change.
“The Domestic Peace Corps, ;

than is presently being contemp
min Rosencranz at Legislature’s

as planned, is not a bold and vig
is to accomplish its goals it will

dated,” said ASSU President Ar
meeting last night. Rosencranz,
"reporting on his attendance at the
NSA conference on the National
Service Corps in Washington last
week, indicated that the delegates
voted overwhelmingly to reject
a clause in the plans for the Na
tional Service Corps giving states
veto power over the requests of
localities for assistance.
The delegates also discussed
the question of requests lor as
sistance by segregated institu
tions. A resolution to refuse as
sistance to segregated institutions
was defeated on the grounds that
integration is not the purpose of
the National Service Corps and
riders combating segregation
were not appropriate.
ROSENCRANZ said that the
initial presentation by the direc
tors of the Corps had given the
delegates the impression that
they were there “to soak up in
formation and squeeze it out back
on campus rather than critically
evaluate the National Service
Corps.”
Rosencranz also reported on
his interviews with various Con
gressmen concerning the Stan
ford-in-Washington plan for stu
dent internships during the sum
mer. A number of Congressmen,
including Senators Church of Ida
ho and Metcalf of Montana, Stan
ford adumni, were enthused about,
the program and said they would
accept student interns if the
funds could be provided.
UNDER THE present plan, ap
plications from students who will
have at least junior standing by
next fall will be processed by an
Advisory Board composed of stu
dents, faculty, administration,
and alumni. This board will se
lect those applications most ap
propriate for each internship po
sition available and send these
applications to the prospective
employers, who will then make
the final choices.
The Advisory Board is com
posed of Dr. Robert Wert, Vice
Provost, Julio Hirsh, Student-
Alumni Coordinator, and Profes
sors Herbert Packer (Law), Mar
tin Shapiro (Political Science),
and Don Fehrenbacher (History).
Jamie Hunter, Heath Chamber
lain, Armin Rosencranz, Susan
Westerberg, and William Butler,
all of whom have been involved
in developing the intern program,
are the students on the Advisory
Board.
