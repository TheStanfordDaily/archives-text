# Domestic Peace Corps to Fill 'Drastic Need'
## 
### KEN TITTLE 
Stanford Delegate, NSA Conference on the
Proposed National Service Program
More than 20 million Americans do volunteer
social service in a year, according to the Presi
dent's Study Group on National Voluntary Serv
ces, and a “plethora” of local, state, and federal
programs grapple with need and deprivation. Yet
in the inner-city slums, migrant camps, Indian
reservations, and otjier areas conditions exist as
poor as those faced by many of our Peace Corps
j /olunteers in the “underdeveloped” nations of the
| world. The proposed “Domestic Peace Corps” is
potentially a powerful weapon for bringing middle
| dass America's manifest desire “to do good” into
j meaningful contact with our drastic and generally
unseen needs.
The current recommendations of the Presi
dent’s study group (although not yet written into
egislation) are well formulated to accomplish this
;oal while still safeguarding against federal usur
pation of the rights and responsibilities of private
citizens and local governments. The “Corps” is
obviously not conceived as a direct, frontal federal
assault on deprivation, with only 5,000 volunteers
compared to 30 or 40 million Americans estimated
living in “poverty,” or compared to more than 20
million Americans now doing some volunteer
service work. The assumption is that the problems
must be met locally. A “National Service Corps”
is only to support, stimulate, or help direct local
I efforts.
PROJECTS are to be submitted by local public
or private groups and conducted by the local
group. That is, project requests would not be for
a federal “program,” hut for a capable, full-time

volunteer to help implement a local program.
Wisely the proposed “Corps” is also limited to
creative action, since acceptable projects must al
low the volunteer to help initiate or establish a
program which could then function when volun
ters are withdrawn eventually, as in one to five
years. Such creative action in community develop
ment, in self-help programs, or in making commu
nity efforts relevant to pressing problems is a
basic need not now adequately met.
THE “CORPS” would require a local invitat ion
and a locally formulated and administered project
before entering any area. Unfortunately, such a
limitation would emasculate the program in the
Deep South where there are areas of critical need.
Sacrificing this limitation, however, is directly
counter to the ideal of the “Corps” stimulating
rather than stifling local and private initiative
and responsibility, and probably counter also to
the spirit of the federalist system. The “Corps”
must make its inroads in the South by fulfilling
its ideals elsewhere, and efforts to force social
justice in the South must be, as the study gi’oup
proposes, divorced from a “National Service
Corps.”
The presidential study group demonstrated to
us at the NSA conference last weekend a highly
sophisticated knowledge of the problems and their
possible solutions and also a concern that a federal
volunteer corps should make a distinctive contri
bution rather than compete with existing efforts
or oven pre-empt areas which potentially could bo
dealt with locally. We hope that such a knowledg
able approach and such a concern arc Incorporated
into legislation to organize as "National Service
Corps” this year
