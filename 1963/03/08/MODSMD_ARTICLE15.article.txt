## The 						Fundamental Standard 
### MIKE WAGGGONER

The Fundamental Standard is not codified. It is a “concept
of personal honor, based on the principles of integrity, common
sense, and respect for civil law which we students bring with
us to Stanford,” according to the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission’s official booklet, rather than a set of
laws.
There is much to be said for life under an authority in
which one has confidence, and where there are few rules. It
allows for more humanity and flexibility in controlling disorder.
Above all, it avoids the basic inequality of law. By applying
the same rules to dissimilar people, the law bears on people
unequally. A grotesque example would be a law fining all people
over six feet tall: it would apply to all equally, each would have
to meet the test, “Are you under six feet tall?” but it would be
very unfair. A less grotesque example is a law limiting drinking,
which applies to all equally but only hurts those who like liquor.
But there can be disadvantages to not having a system of
rules or law. Suppose the enforcing authority were to have a
different set of standards than those who must live under these
standards, a condition which might exist in a University where
the Deans were responsible for discipline.
Tho problem here is that one cannot really know what is
right, so is liable to do wrong unwittingly.
Thus far, we have been assuming a benevolent authority.
It is possible that the authority might not be benevolent. This
could be because it had a different value system, so either fails
to understand or else fears and seeks to destroy a value system
held by some of its charges, or because it is simply malevolent.
Under such a system, the charges are in a very poor posi
tion. They do not know what the rules are, nor perhaps even the
standards on which the rules are based. They may have no ap
peal, They are totally, subject to the whims and power of au
thority.
Not only does this expose chai’ges to ultimate penalties, it
more often exposes them to lesser penalties. A student, for ex
ample, who is suspended for a quarter or year on what he feels
to be unjust grounds is not likely to appeal or protest if he
knows that by so doing he tempts expulsion. The ultimate pen
alty may be more often just a threat or a shield from which to
deal to lesser penalties.
The same points both for and against an unwritten standard
also apply to a system of unenforced laws: the selection of
which to enforce may be benevolent or arbitrary.
The Fun Stan is not codified. It is interpreted by the judicial
councils, whose recommendations are almost always followed by
the Deans, according to Toni Williamson of Women’s Council;
but, as one may gather from conversation with Peter Hoagland
of Men’s Council, the idea of what the Fun Stan is, from which
they form their interpretations, is largely furnished by the
Deans.
How much is the standard under which we are governed our
own and how much is it foreign? How much confidence may we
have that we know what it is? Is the present humanity worth
the uncertainty?
