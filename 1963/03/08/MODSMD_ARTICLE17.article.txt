Dear Police Department :
I am an on-campus parker. I live 7.5 tenths of a mile from
the Tresidder Union parking lot. I drove into the parking lot
this morning and noticed an interesting new sign. It read “No
parking for on-campus vehicles.” Thinking this was a practical
Joke on behalf of our very witty police department, 1 paid no
heed. Yet I was rather alarmed to find that there was a similar
sign on the other Tresidder entrance. It then occurred to me that
those signs might have not been put up in jest, but were really
honest to goodness signs, bearing the same amount of weight
that signs leading, “No parking except for staff and faculty
cars: Sat. p.m. ami Sunday excepted,” do. Well, I was alarmed,
taken aback by this. So I figured this out:
That if I were Herb Elliot, the renowned four-minute miler,
and if I practiced running up and down Australian sand dunes,
I could feasibly make the parking lot from my place of resi
dence in approximately three minutes. But I have the tendency
to walk to class. No, I am not very physically fit, and I still am
rather adverse to perspiring in lectures, and would be adverse
to anyone that came into a lecture perspiring profusely as milers
do. Especially girls from Roth house; or Guthrie, So it would
lake me about ton minutes to get just to the parking lot alone.
Also, my trip back is almost entirely uphill. This would dis
courage ever going back till at least the end of the day and
would consequently force me into spending a lot more time in
such time consuming places as the RBR or the Music listening
rooms, which are already crowded as it is.
So dear police department, please take down those signs.
Say you don’t mean it. If not, on-campus parkers, unite. Unite
and fill that lot.

I found Mr. Saks’ article discussing the history of vending
machines on campus to be very informative. However, I wish to
take exception to one point and that is the statement of “a man
high up in Union management” contending that there is no vend
ing machine monopoly on campus. Such a monopoly certainly
exists in both the Union and in Encina Hall, to name only two of
the campus buildings, where the only cola beverage available
is Pepsi. Without going into the various merits of Coca-Cola
versus Pepsi-Cola, it is sufficient to state here that there are
some people who prefer the former; their best Interests are cer
tainly not being served by removing all Coca-Cola vending ma
chines and prohibiting the sale of Coca-Cola in the Union Cafe
teria and in the Encina Store.
While it is possible to purchase Pepsi in bottle, glass or can,
the Union management is losing both good will and sales by
banning the “Pause that Refreshes” from their operations. The
same Union source justified the monopolistic tendencies of its
policy with the year to year contract basis for vending opera
tions. I fail to see the economy of having a complete replace
ment of machines and services each year and doubt very much
that this action would seriously be considered. Until the Union
decides to leave the choice to the customer, my §26.00 per year
for ‘cokes’ will bo spent elsewhere.

Rick Seifert’s editorial of March 7 criticizing the weaknesses
of the Interfraternity Council seems to be a masterpiece of
malevolent myopia. Certainly the IFC has been a rather weak,
reactionary body in the past, but not for the reasons cited in the
ditorial. All the candidates for the IFC presidency emphasized
the need of communications among the fraternities and the
more coherent presentation of ideas. Contrary to Mr. Seifert’s
opinion, a more effective IFC is possible.
As an IFC representative, I have never felt “frustrated” or
“resperate” and don’t carry the idea of competition into the
Monday meetings, any more than I try to force an image on the
council. To portray the IFC as a group of fiercely antagonistic
champions of the individual houses, rather than as a group of
men interested in an honest solution of campus problems, is to
miss the spirit of the body. The image of the IFC presented in
the editorial is therefore unfair and unrealistic. It has suffered
in the past from a certain lack of decision and communication,
but not because of an innate interhouse hostility.
The fraternities have such a great field of common interest
that disunity is not necessarily inherent in the IFC. It is my be
lief, therefore, that through better organization and administra
tion the “reactionary character” and “overwhelming ineffective
ness” can and will be eliminated in the future.

A strange thing happened yesterday while I perused The
Daily; I came across a sensitive, intelligent and thorough-going
review of the Joan Baez concert along with an equally sensitive
editorial commentary. Last year, on arriving at Stanford, I had
expected this sort of thing in the paper of such a “high-standard”
university, but was sorely disappointed. The paper turned out
to be a poorly organized hodge-podge of “pews”- and articles
typical of he poorer women’s pages in the country. Reviews of
various concerts, movies, etc. were cursory and often downright
puerile. This style was epitomized in a review of “Les Liaisons
Dangerouses,” wherein the movie was characterized as being
“the most ammoral film over produced” although it had a most
obvious moral.
Thus it was rather refreshing to read Miss Downing’s review
in the Wednesday issue. Her comments were apt and well ex
pressed, and they left the feeling that if the performance had
been a poor one, she would have said more than, “This was a
bad performance.” In addition Mr. Weinburg’s comments pro
vided an interesting insight into the artist-audience relationship.
This is the kind of reporting that should appear in a college
paper.

Dr. Terman demonstrated Tuesday night that the cold war
is entering the classroom as a quest for military might. This au
tomatically elevates the sciences while squashing the liberal arts
to a lowly but tolerated position. The result is that the pressure
of the cold war is creating a lopsided philosophy of education.
Instead of learning how to search for truth, the student is more
inclined to think of what he can earn with what little truth he
knows. I fail to see how this nation can advance beyond its im
mature, materialistic beginnings to the position of a mature
world leader when its youth are encouraged to think in such
terms.
What has all this to do with winning the cold war? Plenty.
Our military strength merely keeps Ihe war cold. It is predomi
nately a war for the minds of new nations. Russian has been
meeting this challenge for years. While we promise aircraft and
tanks, they provide men who speak the laguage of that particu
lar country. The Peace Corps is the first good move we’ve made
in that direction. In line with this non-materialistic mode of
thinking, if the pressure of the cold war were redirected those
students who now turn away from an education in the sciences
might find such an education more satisfying.

It pains me—right where I sit down (on my wallet). There is
nothing, almost, that I enjoy more than a cup of coffee. For this
reason I go to the Union and pay a 500 per cent mark-up for a
cup of that golden-black liquid. The pain begins after pressing
the “button” and the quaint machine stops gurgling. There I
stand with two-thirds of a cup of coffee. Oh the temptation to
press the button once more and get another two-thirds! But, I
am sure that the waste of the extra one-third would be a viola
tion of the Fundamental Standard, and you know what a viola
tion of that Commandment leads to. Perhaps the only recourse is
to buy a thermos or go to the rifle range where Sgt. Hawkins
will sell coffee for only a nickel. With such an action by masses
of people, maybe some idiot at the union will make sure that
those quaint machines will give a full cup.
