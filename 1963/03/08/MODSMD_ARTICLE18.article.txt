# RECORD REVIEW
## Second Judy Collins Album Shows Multiple Talents 
### TIMOTHY PAVLIS 
Judy Collins’ second and new
est record, “Golden Apples of the
Sun,” (Elektra EKL-222) is an il
lumination. It resurrects songs
which have fallen into undeserved
obscurity, and introduces exciting
new songs and arrangements.
Miss Collins is one of a breed
of eclectic singers which is doing
for folksong what the scholars
and critics of the last half-century
have done for Renaissance litera
ture-made it live again in our
minds.
In recording the title-song,
Miss Collins has performed a
needed public service. “Golden
Apples of the Sun” is a musical
setting of the most vivid of Wil
liam Butler Yeats’ early lyrics,
“The Song of the Wandering An
gus.” This poem has long been
crying out for musical arrange
ment; its supernal beauty makes
it an enduring fixture of our cul
tural tradition.
The song has long been sung

by Will Holt; the melody, we are
told, was composed by Richard
Dyer-Bennet. The present melody
is not a total success; its slipping,
flowing motion does not fully re
inforce the ritualistic and incan
tory tone of “The Wandering An
gus.” But the present arrange
ment does evoke the dreamy, fil
my atmosphere of the “Celtic twi
light” which is the charm of the
early Yeats. Miss Collins’ resili
ant guitar-work does more to ex
plicate Yeats’ lyric than a dozen
scholarly tomes.
“Little Brown Dog” is a chil
dren’s song, one that seems for
merly to have had political over
tones which disappeared, leaving
the song with a built-in irony
that makes it amusing to adults
as well. It is a medley of leg
ends: about a fabulous dog, a
miniature bull (the inverse of
Paul Bunyan’s Blue Ox), a flock
of feathered sheep which “bring
forth lambs and geese,” and a
prophetic green glass. Miss Col
lins’ ironic yet sincere presenta
tion preserves the satiric with
the childlike.
Similarly, the lullaby “Crow on
the Cradle” is the most subtle
kind of protest song. It is an
ironic excoriation of the common
place tragedy that there will be
a war during the life of every
baby born. Like Edgar Allen
Poe’s “Raven,” to which it bears
strong resemblance, Miss Col
lins’ Crow has few consolations
to offer—only that of articula
tion. But such articulation goes
further than ten ban-the-bomb
songs.
“Great Selchie of Shule Sker
ry” contributes still another ver
sion to the growing corpus of the
traditional British Ballad “Silkie”
(Child No. 113)—folksong’s ex
panded account of Coleridge’s
“woman wailing for her demon
lover.” Miss Collins’ version does
not stand out with stark simplici
ty on this album as Joan Baez’s
“Silkie” does on hers. But it ap
pears that Miss Collins is aiming
at, and achieves, something dif
ferent: a complete dramatic ac
tion. Her “Selchie” moves from
introduction, through rising ac
tion, accentuated climax, and
rapid falling action, to conclusion
and a small quiet moment at the
end.
Miss Collins’ Shule Aroon,” a
relative of “Buttermilk Hill” and
“Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier,”
is one of the fastest-moving and
attention-holding versions around.
Her singing and accompaniment
seem to bo having a mutual flir
tation, and the witty thrust and
counterthrust sweeps the verses
along. In "Tell Me Who I’ll Mar
ry” the quiet humor of the girl’s
indecision is accentuated by Miss
Collins’ skillful and unobtrusive
shifts from the major to minor
mode and back again. “Fan
nerio” reveals her narrative skills
in a powerful exposition of this
simple but violent story.
Miss Collins has indeed made
a notable advance over her first
album, which this column looked
into a few months ago. As the al
bum notes suggest, much of the
huskiness of her early singing is
gone. There remains a certain
toughness in her voice, but she
channels that into the singing of

songs that demand it. She makes
“Bonnie Ship the Diamond” the
work song it should be; and her
fervor and vigor are most wel
come in “Twelve Gates to the
City” and “Sing Hallelujah.” She
is resourceful enough to carry off
a cappella songs like “Christ Child
Lullaby” and “Lark in the Morn
ing” with grace; although after
so much intricate instrumenta
tion the silence is audible. The
Maid of Constant Sorrow has
given away to a woman of many
talents.

a notable advance over her first
album, which this column looked
into a few months ago. As the al
bum notes suggest, much of the
huskiness of her early singing is
gone. There remains a certain
toughness in her voice, but she
channels that into the singing of

songs that demand it. She makes
“Bonnie Ship the Diamond” the
work song it should be; and her
fervor and vigor are most wel
come in “Twelve Gates to the
City” and “Sing Hallelujah.” She
is resourceful enough to carry off
a cappella songs like “Christ Child
Lullaby” and “Lark in the Morn
ing” with grace; although after
so much intricate instrumenta
tion the silence is audible. The
Maid of Constant Sorrow has
given away to a woman of many
talents.
Judy Collins’ second and new
est record, “Golden Apples of the
Sun,” (Elektra EKL-222) is an il
lumination. It resurrects songs
which have fallen into undeserved
obscurity, and introduces exciting
new songs and arrangements.
Miss Collins is one of a breed
of eclectic singers which is doing
for folksong what the scholars
and critics of the last half-century
have done for Renaissance litera
ture-made it live again in our
minds.
In recording the title-song,
Miss Collins has performed a
needed public service. “Golden
Apples of the Sun” is a musical
setting of the most vivid of Wil
liam Butler Yeats’ early lyrics,
“The Song of the Wandering An
gus.” This poem has long been
crying out for musical arrange
ment; its supernal beauty makes
it an enduring fixture of our cul
tural tradition.
The song has long been sung

by Will Holt; the melody, we are
told, was composed by Richard
Dyer-Bennet. The present melody
is not a total success; its slipping,
flowing motion does not fully re
inforce the ritualistic and incan
tory tone of “The Wandering An
gus.” But the present arrange
ment does evoke the dreamy, fil
my atmosphere of the “Celtic twi
light” which is the charm of the
early Yeats. Miss Collins’ resili
ant guitar-work does more to ex
plicate Yeats’ lyric than a dozen
scholarly tomes.
“Little Brown Dog” is a chil
dren’s song, one that seems for
merly to have had political over
tones which disappeared, leaving
the song with a built-in irony
that makes it amusing to adults
as well. It is a medley of leg
ends: about a fabulous dog, a
miniature bull (the inverse of
Paul Bunyan’s Blue Ox), a flock
of feathered sheep which “bring
forth lambs and geese,” and a
prophetic green glass. Miss Col
lins’ ironic yet sincere presenta
tion preserves the satiric with
the childlike.
Similarly, the lullaby “Crow on
the Cradle” is the most subtle
kind of protest song. It is an
ironic excoriation of the common
place tragedy that there will be
a war during the life of every
baby born. Like Edgar Allen
Poe’s “Raven,” to which it bears
strong resemblance, Miss Col
lins’ Crow has few consolations
to offer—only that of articula
tion. But such articulation goes
further than ten ban-the-bomb
songs.
“Great Selchie of Shule Sker
ry” contributes still another ver
sion to the growing corpus of the
traditional British Ballad “Silkie”
(Child No. 113)—folksong’s ex
panded account of Coleridge’s
“woman wailing for her demon
lover.” Miss Collins’ version does
not stand out with stark simplici
ty on this album as Joan Baez’s
“Silkie” does on hers. But it ap
pears that Miss Collins is aiming
at, and achieves, something dif
ferent: a complete dramatic ac
tion. Her “Selchie” moves from
introduction, through rising ac
tion, accentuated climax, and
rapid falling action, to conclusion
and a small quiet moment at the
end.
Miss Collins’ Shule Aroon,” a
relative of “Buttermilk Hill” and
“Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier,”
is one of the fastest-moving and
attention-holding versions around.
Her singing and accompaniment
seem to bo having a mutual flir
tation, and the witty thrust and
counterthrust sweeps the verses
along. In "Tell Me Who I’ll Mar
ry” the quiet humor of the girl’s
indecision is accentuated by Miss
Collins’ skillful and unobtrusive
shifts from the major to minor
mode and back again. “Fan
nerio” reveals her narrative skills
in a powerful exposition of this
simple but violent story.

and a small quiet moment at the

Miss Collins’ Shule Aroon,” a
relative of “Buttermilk Hill” and
“Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier,”
is one of the fastest-moving and
attention-holding versions around.
Her singing and accompaniment
seem to bo having a mutual flir
tation, and the witty thrust and
counterthrust sweeps the verses
along. In "Tell Me Who I’ll Mar
ry” the quiet humor of the girl’s
indecision is accentuated by Miss
Collins’ skillful and unobtrusive
shifts from the major to minor
mode and back again. “Fan
nerio” reveals her narrative skills
in a powerful exposition of this
simple but violent story.
Miss Collins has indeed made
a notable advance over her first
album, which this column looked
into a few months ago. As the al
bum notes suggest, much of the
huskiness of her early singing is
gone. There remains a certain
toughness in her voice, but she
channels that into the singing of

songs that demand it. She makes
“Bonnie Ship the Diamond” the
work song it should be; and her
fervor and vigor are most wel
come in “Twelve Gates to the
City” and “Sing Hallelujah.” She
is resourceful enough to carry off
a cappella songs like “Christ Child
Lullaby” and “Lark in the Morn
ing” with grace; although after
so much intricate instrumenta
tion the silence is audible. The
Maid of Constant Sorrow has
given away to a woman of many
talents.
Judy Collins’ second and new
est record, “Golden Apples of the
Sun,” (Elektra EKL-222) is an il
lumination. It resurrects songs
which have fallen into undeserved
obscurity, and introduces exciting
new songs and arrangements.
Miss Collins is one of a breed
of eclectic singers which is doing
for folksong what the scholars
and critics of the last half-century
have done for Renaissance litera
ture-made it live again in our
minds.
In recording the title-song,
Miss Collins has performed a
needed public service. “Golden
Apples of the Sun” is a musical
setting of the most vivid of Wil
liam Butler Yeats’ early lyrics,
“The Song of the Wandering An
gus.” This poem has long been
crying out for musical arrange
ment; its supernal beauty makes
it an enduring fixture of our cul
tural tradition.
The song has long been sung

by Will Holt; the melody, we are
told, was composed by Richard
Dyer-Bennet. The present melody
is not a total success; its slipping,
flowing motion does not fully re
inforce the ritualistic and incan
tory tone of “The Wandering An
gus.” But the present arrange
ment does evoke the dreamy, fil
my atmosphere of the “Celtic twi
light” which is the charm of the
early Yeats. Miss Collins’ resili
ant guitar-work does more to ex
plicate Yeats’ lyric than a dozen
scholarly tomes.
“Little Brown Dog” is a chil
dren’s song, one that seems for
merly to have had political over
tones which disappeared, leaving
the song with a built-in irony
that makes it amusing to adults
as well. It is a medley of leg
ends: about a fabulous dog, a
miniature bull (the inverse of
Paul Bunyan’s Blue Ox), a flock
of feathered sheep which “bring
forth lambs and geese,” and a
prophetic green glass. Miss Col
lins’ ironic yet sincere presenta
tion preserves the satiric with
the childlike.
Similarly, the lullaby “Crow on
the Cradle” is the most subtle
kind of protest song. It is an
ironic excoriation of the common
place tragedy that there will be
a war during the life of every
baby born. Like Edgar Allen
Poe’s “Raven,” to which it bears
strong resemblance, Miss Col
lins’ Crow has few consolations
to offer—only that of articula
tion. But such articulation goes
further than ten ban-the-bomb
songs.
“Great Selchie of Shule Sker
ry” contributes still another ver
sion to the growing corpus of the
traditional British Ballad “Silkie”
(Child No. 113)—folksong’s ex
panded account of Coleridge’s
“woman wailing for her demon
lover.” Miss Collins’ version does
not stand out with stark simplici
ty on this album as Joan Baez’s
“Silkie” does on hers. But it ap
pears that Miss Collins is aiming
at, and achieves, something dif
ferent: a complete dramatic ac
tion. Her “Selchie” moves from
introduction, through rising ac
tion, accentuated climax, and
rapid falling action, to conclusion
and a small quiet moment at the
end.
