### 
Six-month openings in a newly
formed Army National Guard
missile unit are being offered,
first, to Stanford men who plan
to fulfill their military obligation
as enlisted men.
Lieutenant J. B. Truher, (B.S.
’6O), has been appointed com
mander of one of four California
National Guard Nike-Hercules
sites.
“We might well develop a
‘Stanford-at-Fort Bliss (Texas)’
as most men will be there for
their six months training. This
is a remarkable situation since
the unit is new, and I’m the only
one doing any real recruiting,” he
said.
Enlistees will be trained for
six months as part of an opera
tional air defense missile firing
team. Technical background Is
not required.
