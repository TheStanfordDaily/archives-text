# Indian Talent vs. San Jose Depth In Stanford Relays Tomorrow
## 
### PETE KING 
The intercollegiate track sea
son opens tomorrow with North
ern California’s three track pow
ers—Stanford, San Jose State,
and Cal—clashing in the Stanford
Relays at 1 p.m. in Stanford Sta

dium.
It will bo an unusual meet, with
every event save the 100-yard dash
and high hurdles run on a relay
basis. In the field events, the
marks of the best three men will
be added together to determine
the winner.

AS IS THE case in relay meets,
the team with the most depth
will probably win. That team ap
pears to be San Jose State, with
one of the deepest track squads
in the country. Stanford has more
individual standouts, though, and
they may overcome the all round
Spartan talent.
The outstanding event should
be the distance medley (440, 880,
1320, mile), where the meet rec
ord of 10 minutes will probably
fall. Stanford is sending Jack
Scott, Bob Miltz, Paul Fishback,
John Hatton, and Art Heinemann,
and San Jose’s Dwight Middleton,
Mike Gibeau, Jose Azevedo, and
Ben Tucker. The race could go
down to the last of the 10 laps
before being decided.
IN THE HURDLES, both Stan
ford’s Steve Cortright and SJS’s
Bob Taylor have 14.6 clockings
this spring. San Jose splinters
Tom Webb and Lloyd Murad
have the fastest times, but Larry
Questad, whom Stanford coach
Payton Jordan calls his best
sprinter in seven years, will pro
vide a strong challenge to the
fleet Spartans.
The field events will be close,
the question being whether Stan
ford’s individual stars will get
enough support from teammates
to overcome San Jose's fine jump
ers and weightmen.
