# TRIBE EYES PROVO
## Cagers Bid for Title in Southland 
### PETE KING 
Having clinched a tie for the
AAWU basketball title, the In
dians must now show that they
deserve to win it. They play
UCLA, their only contender, to
night in the Santa Monica gym
nasium and meet USC tomorrow
night in the L.A. State gym. Stan
ford needs one win in the two
games to claim its first title in
21 years.
If the Indians win one of the
two games, or if UCLA loses to
Cal, Stanford will travel to Provo,
Utah, next weekend for the NCAA
regionals. Should the Tribe lose
two and tie with UCLA for the

title, a playoff game would be
played Monday in Los Angeles
between the two teams, the win
ner going to Provo.
AT PROVO, the AAWU team
will play the winner of the Ari
zona State-Utah State game, to be
played in Eugene, Oregon, Mon
day. Seattle and Oregon State will
also play in Eugene, that winner
playing the WCAC champ (USF
or Santa Clara). The two winners
will play March 16 for the right
to go to Louisville and a probable
game with Cincinnati.
The task for the Cards is a lot
harder than it sounds. True, Stan
ford has beaten UCLA twice this
year—in the Pavilion. But the
Bruins are practically unstoppable
in the cramped Santa Monica
gym; they haven’t lost there in
two seasons, and last week de
molished Washington there, 80-52.
Add to this the vindictiveness of
the Bruins, easily discernible in
their last game here, and the
Tribe’s chances for victory seem
slim.
HOWEVER, if Stanford center
Tom Dose has his usual good
game against UCLA’s Fred
Slaughter, and guards Don Cle
metson and Kent Hinckley can
neutralize All-American Wait Haz
zard, while scoring some on their
own, Stanford should sweep its
first series with UCLA since 1942.
In that year the Tribe won the
national championship.
Getting by USC doesn’t appear
easy, either. The Cards won last
week, 60-58, but only on a last
second basket after they had
blown a 14-point lead. The Tro
jans w'ere also tired, having play
ed a racehorse game with UCLA

the night before. Even so, center
Gordy Martin hit 10 of 18 shots,
while holding Dose to 13 points.
IN THE LAST analysis, a Stan
ford victory in L.A. will depend
more on the rest of the team than
on Dose. All season long, Stanford
has usually lost when its forwards
and guards weren’t scoring a lot,
no matter how spectacular Dose
was. Last week, Clayton Raaka
played his finest game of the

year, and Stanford won because
he and Clemetson were able to
take up the scoring slack. If Stan
ford wins, the same will be true
this weekend.
Dose needs 64 points this week
end to break Ron Tomsic’s one
season scoring record of 515
points. He also has an excellent
chance to become the first Stan
ford player to average 20 points
a game.

Radio station HUBS will
broadcast both tonight’s and
tomorrow’s games at 8:30
p.m.

year, and Stanford won because
he and Clemetson were able to
take up the scoring slack. If Stan
ford wins, the same will be true
this weekend.
Dose needs 64 points this week
end to break Ron Tomsic’s one
season scoring record of 515
points. He also has an excellent
chance to become the first Stan
ford player to average 20 points
a game.

Radio station HUBS will
broadcast both tonight’s and
tomorrow’s games at 8:30

TOM DOSE (far left) needs 64 points against UCLA and USC this
weekend to break the all-time Stanford scoring record, while the
Indians need just one win to clinch the AAWU title. Here, Dose
muscles in a lay-up over SC’s Bill Morris (12); the Trojans won
this game four weeks ago, 61-57.
Having clinched a tie for the
AAWU basketball title, the In
dians must now show that they
deserve to win it. They play
UCLA, their only contender, to
night in the Santa Monica gym
nasium and meet USC tomorrow
night in the L.A. State gym. Stan
ford needs one win in the two
games to claim its first title in
21 years.
If the Indians win one of the
two games, or if UCLA loses to
Cal, Stanford will travel to Provo,
Utah, next weekend for the NCAA
regionals. Should the Tribe lose
two and tie with UCLA for the

title, a playoff game would be
played Monday in Los Angeles
between the two teams, the win
ner going to Provo.
AT PROVO, the AAWU team
will play the winner of the Ari
zona State-Utah State game, to be
played in Eugene, Oregon, Mon
day. Seattle and Oregon State will
also play in Eugene, that winner
playing the WCAC champ (USF
or Santa Clara). The two winners
will play March 16 for the right
to go to Louisville and a probable
game with Cincinnati.
The task for the Cards is a lot
harder than it sounds. True, Stan
ford has beaten UCLA twice this
year—in the Pavilion. But the
Bruins are practically unstoppable
in the cramped Santa Monica
gym; they haven’t lost there in
two seasons, and last week de
molished Washington there, 80-52.
Add to this the vindictiveness of
the Bruins, easily discernible in
their last game here, and the
Tribe’s chances for victory seem
slim.
HOWEVER, if Stanford center
Tom Dose has his usual good
game against UCLA’s Fred
Slaughter, and guards Don Cle
metson and Kent Hinckley can
neutralize All-American Wait Haz
zard, while scoring some on their
own, Stanford should sweep its
first series with UCLA since 1942.
In that year the Tribe won the
national championship.
Getting by USC doesn’t appear
easy, either. The Cards won last
week, 60-58, but only on a last
second basket after they had
blown a 14-point lead. The Tro
jans w'ere also tired, having play
ed a racehorse game with UCLA

the night before. Even so, center
Gordy Martin hit 10 of 18 shots,
while holding Dose to 13 points.
IN THE LAST analysis, a Stan
ford victory in L.A. will depend
more on the rest of the team than
on Dose. All season long, Stanford
has usually lost when its forwards
and guards weren’t scoring a lot,
no matter how spectacular Dose
was. Last week, Clayton Raaka
played his finest game of the

year, and Stanford won because
he and Clemetson were able to
take up the scoring slack. If Stan
ford wins, the same will be true
this weekend.
Dose needs 64 points this week
