# Stanford, Cal Play For Big Scrum Axe
## 
### 
Stanford’s ruggers will attempt
to run their season record to 9-1
tomorrow when they host Cal on
the Stanford field at 3:00. The
Golden Bears will be seeking re
venge for the 13-11 loss imposed
on them last Saturday in Berke
ley by the Indians.
Despite its mediocre 2-4 record
there is talent on the Groat North
ern Institution’s team. Tom Nes
bitt, a former New Zealand All-
Black player, is at first five five
eights for the Bears. Also in the
lineup is Jim Mollin, a member
of the touring New Zealand Uni
versities squad last season. That
team inflicted Stanford’s only loss
of the 1961-62 campaign.
Stanford also puts its posses
sion of the Big Scrum Axe in
jeopardy tomorrow. The axe goes
to the team scoring the highest
number of total points in the two
Stanford-Cal games played every
season. Stanford has held the axe
for the last two years.
