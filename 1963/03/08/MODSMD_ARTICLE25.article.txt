# Long Season Finally Ends for Gymnasts
## 
### DAVID NVBKRG 
[ The ‘Stanford gymnasts ended
I their dual meet season with a
145-67 loss to San Jose State
j Wednesday night. Three Indians
i accumulated a total of four first
places in the seven events, but the
story of Stanford gymnastics is
j one of no depth. Marc Weiss-
I bluth, number one tumbler, who
; is usually entered in three events,
j was in jured earlier in the week,
| so he did not compete.
| Of the five Indians who did
compete, Roger Rhoads was high
point man with 14. His best mark
was a second in the high bars; he
olaced in five other events. Russ
Burmester had 12 points, with
firsts on the still rings and high
bar. Alan Miyamoto (side horse)
j and Bill Rusher (long horse) had
the other S.U. firsts.
A RATHER DISMAL season
(1 win, 7 losses) was brightened
by some top individual perform
ances. Captain Russ Burmester
| won the high bar and still rings
events in six of the eight meets.
Alan Miyamoto also won the side
horse six times. Roger Rhoads
earned the most points in a single
meet —21—and Burmester had the
| high individual rating of 8.75 for
still rings. Burmester was also
the seasonal high point man with
85.5, Miyamoto was second with
74.5.
This team, which had a better
comparative score against Long
I Beach State (one of the better
teams in the West) than either
I Southern California or UCLA, has
j for the first time in many years
a chance to finish second behind
| California in the AAWU meet at
! USC, March 23.
