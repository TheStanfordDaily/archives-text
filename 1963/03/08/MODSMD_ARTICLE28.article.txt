# University Observes Founder's Day
## Senator Stanford Great Influence In California History 
### LES BROWN 
Leland Stanford went West and he made
good. Perhaps Horace Greeley would have
considered Stanford to be the epitome of the
bright young men who went West and made
their fortunes. Then again he might not, for
Stanford has often been criticized for his
economic practices. Be that as it may. no
one can deny that Stanford was active in
almost a Faustian manner.
Stanford was president of the Central
Pacific Railroad, Governor of California,
U.S. Senator, a knowledgeable horse breeder,
and a giant among American philanthropists.
Stanford in his youth at Watervllet, N.Y.,
was considered as “something of a student.”
His friends and neighbors called him
“judge.” And indeed, he might have become
a New York judge, doomed to obscurity, had
it not been for a fire. The elder Leland Stan
ford passed his boyhood in the hard disci
pline of farm life, with its emphasis on work
and thrift. Then ho studied law. But a fire
that destroyed his law library turned him
from that profession and sent him West.
.MONKY WAS EASY to make in Califor
nia in the 1850’s, and Stanford made plenty,
first as a merchant in Sacramento and later
as a mine operator. Within three years of
coming to California, Stanford was able to
purchase the Stanford Bros, store from his
five biothers and bring Jane Lathrop Stan
ford. whom he had married in 1850, to Cali
fornia.
When he was bringing his wife West—
by steamer and the Isthmus—she became
seasick. He promised: “Never mind, a time
will come when I will build a railroad for
you to go homo on.”
And that he did, after making himself
unpopular by opposing slavery in a state
dominated by ox-southerners and then mak
ing himself popular enough to be elected
governor.
Stanford was the most active member of
the Republican party in California. He ran
for stale treasurer in 1857 and governor in
1859. In both races there was no hope for
his election. In 1860 he campaigned up and
down the state for Lincoln, and the Lincoln
electors won. In 1861 he told the California
Republican convention that the South stood
for aristocracy while the Union represented
democracy. He was nominated for governor,
and after stumping the state with Jane at
his side, he won. Stanford not only kept Cali
fornia in the Union, but saw that the state
contributed substantially to the Union vic
tory.
DESPITE THE RISKS inherent in the
project, a group of Sacramento merchants
formed the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany to lay track eastward to connect with
westward-building Union Pacific. Stanford
was elected president Of the company in
1861, and he along with Collis P. Huntington,
Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker emerged
as the “Big Four” who risked their financial
hides and worked almost to the breaking
point. But the task was completed, and Stan
ford drove the final spike on May 10, 1869.
Thus Leland Stanford was a man who
surmounted obstacles that would have lev
eled a lesser man to become the individual
largely responsible for linking California to
the rest of the United States. This linkage
was twofold: on one hand the physical link
age afforded by the railroad and the political
binding epitomized by the position assumed
by California in the Civil War.
Stanford bought the Farm mainly for the
benefit of the son born to him and Jane after
many childless years. Here he developed
trotters which set 19 world records. He also
explored the conditions necessary for pro
ducing fine wines and brandies.
In 1885, Stanford went to Washington as
a Senator, but not before he made provisions
for the founding of Leland Stanford Junior
University in memory of his only son who
died in 1884.
LELAND STANFORD, already in failing
health and crushed under the weight of the
impending national financial panic, died in
his sleep at the Palo Alto home early on the
morning of July 21, 1893. The funeral was
held in the open air of the Inner Quadrangle.
At the close of his sermon, the minister
turned to the pallbearers, eight senior loco
motive enginers and admonished them,
“Gentle up your strength a little, for ’tis a
man you bear.” These were appropriate
words indeed.


THE ONLY STANFORD GIRLS to ever win
Block S Awards, members of the nine-girl
basketball team earned their letters by
beating Cal's all-girl team 2-1 in 1896.
The game was played at the Page Street
Armory in San Francisco. The girls played
before an ail female audience of about
700, while guards armed with sticks prevented curious males from peering through
the windows. The team uniform was a
cardinal red sweater with a wide red sailor
collar worn over bloomers.

benefit of the son born to him and Jane after
many childless years. Here he developed
trotters which set 19 world records. He also
explored the conditions necessary for pro
ducing fine wines and brandies.
In 1885, Stanford went to Washington as
a Senator, but not before he made provisions
for the founding of Leland Stanford Junior
University in memory of his only son who
died in 1884.
LELAND STANFORD, already in failing
health and crushed under the weight of the
impending national financial panic, died in
his sleep at the Palo Alto home early on the
morning of July 21, 1893. The funeral was
held in the open air of the Inner Quadrangle.
At the close of his sermon, the minister
turned to the pallbearers, eight senior loco
motive enginers and admonished them,
“Gentle up your strength a little, for ’tis a
man you bear.” These were appropriate
words indeed.


THE ONLY STANFORD GIRLS to ever win
Block S Awards, members of the nine-girl
basketball team earned their letters by
beating Cal's all-girl team 2-1 in 1896.
The game was played at the Page Street
Armory in San Francisco. The girls played
before an ail female audience of about
700, while guards armed with sticks prevented curious males from peering through
the windows. The team uniform was a
cardinal red sweater with a wide red sailor
collar worn over bloomers.
Leland Stanford went West and he made
good. Perhaps Horace Greeley would have
considered Stanford to be the epitome of the
bright young men who went West and made
their fortunes. Then again he might not, for
Stanford has often been criticized for his
economic practices. Be that as it may. no
one can deny that Stanford was active in
almost a Faustian manner.
Stanford was president of the Central
Pacific Railroad, Governor of California,
U.S. Senator, a knowledgeable horse breeder,
and a giant among American philanthropists.
Stanford in his youth at Watervllet, N.Y.,
was considered as “something of a student.”
His friends and neighbors called him
“judge.” And indeed, he might have become
a New York judge, doomed to obscurity, had
it not been for a fire. The elder Leland Stan
ford passed his boyhood in the hard disci
pline of farm life, with its emphasis on work
and thrift. Then ho studied law. But a fire
that destroyed his law library turned him
from that profession and sent him West.
.MONKY WAS EASY to make in Califor
nia in the 1850’s, and Stanford made plenty,
first as a merchant in Sacramento and later
as a mine operator. Within three years of
coming to California, Stanford was able to
purchase the Stanford Bros, store from his
five biothers and bring Jane Lathrop Stan
ford. whom he had married in 1850, to Cali
fornia.
When he was bringing his wife West—
by steamer and the Isthmus—she became
seasick. He promised: “Never mind, a time
will come when I will build a railroad for
you to go homo on.”
And that he did, after making himself
unpopular by opposing slavery in a state
dominated by ox-southerners and then mak
ing himself popular enough to be elected
governor.
Stanford was the most active member of
the Republican party in California. He ran
for stale treasurer in 1857 and governor in
1859. In both races there was no hope for
his election. In 1860 he campaigned up and
down the state for Lincoln, and the Lincoln
electors won. In 1861 he told the California
Republican convention that the South stood
for aristocracy while the Union represented
democracy. He was nominated for governor,
and after stumping the state with Jane at
his side, he won. Stanford not only kept Cali
fornia in the Union, but saw that the state
contributed substantially to the Union vic
tory.
DESPITE THE RISKS inherent in the
project, a group of Sacramento merchants
formed the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany to lay track eastward to connect with
westward-building Union Pacific. Stanford
was elected president Of the company in
1861, and he along with Collis P. Huntington,
Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker emerged
as the “Big Four” who risked their financial
hides and worked almost to the breaking
point. But the task was completed, and Stan
ford drove the final spike on May 10, 1869.
Thus Leland Stanford was a man who
surmounted obstacles that would have lev
eled a lesser man to become the individual
largely responsible for linking California to
the rest of the United States. This linkage
was twofold: on one hand the physical link
age afforded by the railroad and the political
binding epitomized by the position assumed
by California in the Civil War.

1859. In both races there was no hope for
his election. In 1860 he campaigned up and
down the state for Lincoln, and the Lincoln
electors won. In 1861 he told the California
Republican convention that the South stood
for aristocracy while the Union represented
democracy. He was nominated for governor,
and after stumping the state with Jane at
his side, he won. Stanford not only kept Cali
fornia in the Union, but saw that the state
contributed substantially to the Union vic
tory.
DESPITE THE RISKS inherent in the
project, a group of Sacramento merchants
formed the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany to lay track eastward to connect with
westward-building Union Pacific. Stanford
was elected president Of the company in
1861, and he along with Collis P. Huntington,
Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker emerged
as the “Big Four” who risked their financial
hides and worked almost to the breaking
point. But the task was completed, and Stan
ford drove the final spike on May 10, 1869.
Thus Leland Stanford was a man who
surmounted obstacles that would have lev
eled a lesser man to become the individual
largely responsible for linking California to
the rest of the United States. This linkage
was twofold: on one hand the physical link
age afforded by the railroad and the political
binding epitomized by the position assumed
by California in the Civil War.
Stanford bought the Farm mainly for the
benefit of the son born to him and Jane after
many childless years. Here he developed
trotters which set 19 world records. He also
explored the conditions necessary for pro
ducing fine wines and brandies.
In 1885, Stanford went to Washington as
a Senator, but not before he made provisions
for the founding of Leland Stanford Junior
University in memory of his only son who
died in 1884.
LELAND STANFORD, already in failing
health and crushed under the weight of the
impending national financial panic, died in
his sleep at the Palo Alto home early on the
morning of July 21, 1893. The funeral was
held in the open air of the Inner Quadrangle.
At the close of his sermon, the minister
turned to the pallbearers, eight senior loco
motive enginers and admonished them,
“Gentle up your strength a little, for ’tis a
man you bear.” These were appropriate
words indeed.


THE ONLY STANFORD GIRLS to ever win
Block S Awards, members of the nine-girl
basketball team earned their letters by
beating Cal's all-girl team 2-1 in 1896.
The game was played at the Page Street
Armory in San Francisco. The girls played
before an ail female audience of about
700, while guards armed with sticks prevented curious males from peering through
the windows. The team uniform was a
cardinal red sweater with a wide red sailor
collar worn over bloomers.
Leland Stanford went West and he made
good. Perhaps Horace Greeley would have
considered Stanford to be the epitome of the
bright young men who went West and made
their fortunes. Then again he might not, for
Stanford has often been criticized for his
economic practices. Be that as it may. no
one can deny that Stanford was active in
almost a Faustian manner.
Stanford was president of the Central
Pacific Railroad, Governor of California,
U.S. Senator, a knowledgeable horse breeder,
and a giant among American philanthropists.
Stanford in his youth at Watervllet, N.Y.,
was considered as “something of a student.”
His friends and neighbors called him
“judge.” And indeed, he might have become
a New York judge, doomed to obscurity, had
it not been for a fire. The elder Leland Stan
ford passed his boyhood in the hard disci
pline of farm life, with its emphasis on work
and thrift. Then ho studied law. But a fire
that destroyed his law library turned him
from that profession and sent him West.
.MONKY WAS EASY to make in Califor
nia in the 1850’s, and Stanford made plenty,
first as a merchant in Sacramento and later
as a mine operator. Within three years of
coming to California, Stanford was able to
purchase the Stanford Bros, store from his
five biothers and bring Jane Lathrop Stan
ford. whom he had married in 1850, to Cali
fornia.
When he was bringing his wife West—
by steamer and the Isthmus—she became
seasick. He promised: “Never mind, a time
will come when I will build a railroad for
you to go homo on.”
And that he did, after making himself
unpopular by opposing slavery in a state
dominated by ox-southerners and then mak
ing himself popular enough to be elected
governor.
