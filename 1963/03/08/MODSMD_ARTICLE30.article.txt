# FEAR IN 1899:
## Stanford May Become 'Vassar of Pacific Coast' 
### NANCY MARSHALL 
While Stanford is now acclaimed as the
“Harvard of the West,’’ it was in 1899 be
lieved by some to be in danger of becoming
the “Vassar of the Pacific Coast.” The ratio
of women to men in the early years of the
University grew at such a rapid rate that
Mrs. Stanford, fearing that the memorial to
her son would become a finishing school for
the cultured young American woman,
amended to the University Charter a rule
limiting the number of women students to
five hundred.
At first Mrs. Stanford was wary of in
cluding any women in the student body be
cause the school was to be so distinctly a
memorial to Leland Junior. Orrin L. Elliott,
the first Stanford Registrar, relates this and
other anecdotes in his history, “Stanford,
First 25 Years.”
>IRK. STANFORD did not foresee that as
the number of students grew, the number of
women students would grow faster. During
the first year, one-fourth of all Stanford stu
dents were women; four years later, they
composed one-third of the student body.
Made uneasy by this trend, officials ex
pressed fears that women might soon pre
dominate. Rather than to limit the enroll
ment of women, President Jordan felt the
solution was to increase that of men. The
Portland Oregonian quoted Jordan, “The
University must have more men if we expect
to make a better showing in athletics.”
The Oregonian wrote in the same article,
“Another objection to the present status is
the increase of power among women. They
are voting themselves into all the offices and
thereby rendering the institution less desir
able to male students than it otherwise
would be. There is an alarming tendency ap
parent toward reducing the University to the
level of a ‘woman’s seminary,’ which Mrs.
Stanford very much dreads.”
BUT THE EARLY Stanford woman was
as refined in the social sphere as she was
aggressive in the civic. One “frosh dolly”
wrote home in 1891, “There are no rules over
us yet. but there are a few things wo are
expected to do, like coming in at nine o’clock,
being on time at meals, and some other
things that most of us would do anyway.”
Stanford social life was initiated in 1891
when Roble held a reception for the faculty
and students. In exchange, the Encina men
later invited Roble girls for a reception and
dance. The girls took this as an insult, be
cause. as one girl wrote, it was “more proper
that Ihe girls give the first dance, and some
of the young men were not known to be of
the best character.”
In a meeting the gills voted to send a
note politely declining the invitation saying
that they preferred not to dance at such an
early date and on slight acquaintance. Irri
tated by the coyness demonstrated by the
girls, the Encina men wrote back that due
to circumstances beyond their control, they
could not receive the girls anyway.
Thus, the girls did not predominate over
men at Stanford. The University therefore
can be considered an appropriate memorial
to Leland Junior in Mrs. Stanford’s eyes.
Anyway, Stanford is not the “Vassar of the
Pacific Coast.”


DESPITE THE DRESSES and the furniture, this informal gathering of typically alert and
intelligent Stanford women in the Roble parlor in 1898 may call to mind presentday Roble house meetings.

cause. as one girl wrote, it was “more proper
that Ihe girls give the first dance, and some
of the young men were not known to be of
the best character.”
In a meeting the gills voted to send a
note politely declining the invitation saying
that they preferred not to dance at such an
early date and on slight acquaintance. Irri
tated by the coyness demonstrated by the
girls, the Encina men wrote back that due
to circumstances beyond their control, they
could not receive the girls anyway.
Thus, the girls did not predominate over
men at Stanford. The University therefore
can be considered an appropriate memorial
to Leland Junior in Mrs. Stanford’s eyes.
Anyway, Stanford is not the “Vassar of the
Pacific Coast.”


DESPITE THE DRESSES and the furniture, this informal gathering of typically alert and
intelligent Stanford women in the Roble parlor in 1898 may call to mind presentday Roble house meetings.
While Stanford is now acclaimed as the
“Harvard of the West,’’ it was in 1899 be
lieved by some to be in danger of becoming
the “Vassar of the Pacific Coast.” The ratio
of women to men in the early years of the
University grew at such a rapid rate that
Mrs. Stanford, fearing that the memorial to
her son would become a finishing school for
the cultured young American woman,
amended to the University Charter a rule
limiting the number of women students to
five hundred.
At first Mrs. Stanford was wary of in
cluding any women in the student body be
cause the school was to be so distinctly a
memorial to Leland Junior. Orrin L. Elliott,
the first Stanford Registrar, relates this and
other anecdotes in his history, “Stanford,
First 25 Years.”
>IRK. STANFORD did not foresee that as
the number of students grew, the number of
women students would grow faster. During
the first year, one-fourth of all Stanford stu
dents were women; four years later, they
composed one-third of the student body.
Made uneasy by this trend, officials ex
pressed fears that women might soon pre
dominate. Rather than to limit the enroll
ment of women, President Jordan felt the
solution was to increase that of men. The
Portland Oregonian quoted Jordan, “The
University must have more men if we expect
to make a better showing in athletics.”
The Oregonian wrote in the same article,
“Another objection to the present status is
the increase of power among women. They
are voting themselves into all the offices and
thereby rendering the institution less desir
able to male students than it otherwise
would be. There is an alarming tendency ap
parent toward reducing the University to the
level of a ‘woman’s seminary,’ which Mrs.
Stanford very much dreads.”
BUT THE EARLY Stanford woman was
as refined in the social sphere as she was
aggressive in the civic. One “frosh dolly”
wrote home in 1891, “There are no rules over
us yet. but there are a few things wo are
expected to do, like coming in at nine o’clock,
being on time at meals, and some other
things that most of us would do anyway.”
Stanford social life was initiated in 1891
when Roble held a reception for the faculty
and students. In exchange, the Encina men
later invited Roble girls for a reception and
dance. The girls took this as an insult, be
cause. as one girl wrote, it was “more proper
that Ihe girls give the first dance, and some
of the young men were not known to be of
the best character.”
