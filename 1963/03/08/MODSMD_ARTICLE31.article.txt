# STANFORD HISTORY:
## Crises Met In Early Years 
### Hy MARY KAY BECKER 
Did you know that Stanford, instead of
being the liberal arts university that it now
is, at its beginning might have been built
as a technical school for civil and mechani
cal enginers? Or that it might iiave been an
institution in San Francisco combining a
museum with a large public lecture hall?
Under the advice of President Eliot of
Harvard, however, the Stanfords decided in
1881 to (uect this university as a monument
to their son. Once they had set their minds
on a university the Stanfords pursued the
plan with characteristic energy. The corner
stone was laid in 1887.
FOR THK PRESIDENT of their university
the Stanfords found David Starr Jordan, an
ichthyologist whose presidency had remade
the University of Indiana. Stanford was well
satisfied with the selection; he stated that
"I might have found a more famous edu
cator, but I desired a comparatively young
man who would grow up with (he Univer
sity.” \
At the Opening Day exercises on Oct. 1,
1891, more than 400 students appeared to
register. Classes began the next day. As
might have been expected, the students were
a motley group. One-third were from out of
state; some had come completely unpre
pared. In fact, several parents had even re
quested that (heir 8-year-olds be admitted in
order to be members of the first Stanford
graduating class.
THK FIRST < RISIS of the University’s
history, and still considered its greatest trag
edy, was the Ross Affair which reached its
climax in 1900-01. The controversy centered
around the right of Stanford’s professors
to speak out publicly on non-university af
fairs.
Edward A. Ross earn** to Stanford as
Professor of Economics in 1893. Popular
among the students for his vivid lectures,
Ross was nevertheless viewed with concern
by many faculty members for his radical
opinions and unorthodox methods of teach
ing Finance. In 1896 he came out in full sup
port of Bryan for President and “the free
and unlimited coinage of silver.” His pamph
lets, his active campaigning, and his radical
lectures and speeches were somewhat dis
tasteful to Mis. Stanford. To Dr. Jordan,
however, suppression of academic freedom

of speech was unthinkable, and he considered
Ross “a valuable source of strength to the
University.” Consequently until 1900 nothing
conclusive was done about Ross.
BI T THE SITUATION came to a head
when Mrs. Stanford read a report of Ross’s
speech in San Francisco on Japanese immi
gration, which included this isolated quota
tion: “And should the worst come to worst
it would be better for us to turn our guns on
every vessel bringing Japanese to our shores
rather than to permit them to land.” This
was the last straw, and she forcefully re
quested his removal from his job. Jordan,
still convinced that the situation was not
this extreme, tried to persuade her to allow
Ross to stay. When it became evident that
she would not permit this, Joxdan finally
proposed a solution whereby Ross could he
quietly eased from his position after a period
of about six months.
All correspondence between Jordan. Ross,
and Mrs. Stanford had been carried on pri
vately. As soon as Jordan thus made Ross’s
removal official, however, Ross released a
public statement giving all the details of
the correspondence and violating the “gentle
men’s agreement,” prefacing his statement
by saying, “Well, boys, I’ve been fired.”
Embarrassing as this was for the Uni
versity, it might have blown over had the
situation not been immediately intensified
by a lecture by the widely-respected Prof.
Howard of the History Dept. Howard made
an impassioned protest against what he felt
had been a flagrant violation of the principle
of academic freedom. His information had
been gathered solely from Ross’s statement.
He denounced Ross’s removal and accepted
Ross’s assertion that the influence of great
corporations had caused his dismissal. After
repeated attempts hy Dr. Jordan to smooth
this over, Howard’s resignation was also
enforced.
THE GREAT MAJORITY of faculty, stu
dents, and alumni came to support Jordan’s
stand in dealing with the two professors,
but the affair received great coverage in
newspapers and thus was a source of preju
dice, suspicion, and criticism against the
University.
The earthquake of 1906, following a ty
phoid epidemic a couple of years before, was
another crisis for the University. Classes
had to be temporarily halted while Stanford
students worked in relief forces around the
Bay Area. Dr. Jordan considered it a sober
ing effect on the student body; this seemed
to be justified by the year 1907, in which
affairs on the Farm went exceptionally
smoothly.
1908 was a different matter. This was the
year of the Parade.
THE PARADE had its beginnings in two
dominant articles of current student opinion:
the right to have “beer busts” and the right
of the student to regulate his own conduct.
At that time the favorite drinking spots were
in Mayfield. Then Prof. A. B. Clark, a resi
dent of Mayfield, was elected mayor and pro
ceeded to close its saloons, only to see them
re-open in Menlo Park. Drinking was subject
to few regulations there, and an increase in
late-night disturbances and revelry among
the students resulted.
The hated Committee on Student Affairs
resigned, unable to control the students. A
new conciliatory committee was formed,
asking only for a gentlemen’s agreement to
restrain the excesses. This policy only
brought about a feeling of mastery in the
students; if they resisted strongly enough,
the faculty could be bent to their wishes.
THE CONCILIATORY Committee’s brief
existence Was ended when a drunken under
graduate entered the wrong house in Palo
Alto, was mistaken for a burglar, and was
shot to death. The committee resigned and
a third one was formed, headed by Clark,
mayor of “dry” Mayfield.
The new committee’s statement of a plan
to eliminate student drinking resulted in the
Parade. A crowd of about 300 men assembled
in vague protest and spontaneously set off
toward Clark’s house, shouting and singing.
Finding him gone, the mob marched through
the library, around the campus, and figura
tively burned the committee’s statement at
the foot of the Founders’ statue.
THE DEMONSTRATION could not be
overlooked by the administration. But by the
time the judgments of the students involved
were handed down by the Faculty Student
Affairs Committee 11 suspended, 80 penal
ized by addition of extra units to require
ments for graduation group solidarity had
asserted itself and even students who dis
approved of the Parade felt that students
as a whole were being persecuted.
To resolve the bad feeling between stu
dents and faculty, Jordan made two changes
in the fall of 1908: the President’s Confer
ence had been expanded to allow greater
student control of their own affairs, and
an adviser to work with underclassmen had
been appointed. Control was gradually
loosened, with presidential committee sanc
tion and retained in case of need.


HORSES, HOUSES, and limestone blocks
were all part of the construction of Inner
Quad. The Philosophy, Housing, and Registrar Buildings shown here remained in a
roofless, unfinished state until long after the
first scheduled opening of the University.


LONG BEFORE BICYCLES were prohibited
from the Quad, the Palo Alto Wheels casually posed with their one, two, and three
wheelers. These Encina men were members
of the racing squad.


IMPORTED ITALIAN stonecutters chisel away
at two of the multitudinous capitals which
ornament the columns on Inner and Outer
Quads. The capitals were carved out of
white limestone.


BUILDING OPERATIONS were energetically
pushed forward following the laying of the
cornerstone in 1887. Stanford had hoped
that the University would be ready to receive students the next spring, but minor
problems and changes in details delayed
construction. The University opened in 1891.


PROTECTED FROM the sun by an umbrella,
Trustee Judge Lorenzo Sawyer delivers an
opening day speech to an audience of 465
students, David Starr Jordan and his faculty
of 15, and Governor and Mrs. Stanford. The
speaker's stand was erected at the west end
of Quad.
