# SCHWARZ:
## British Guiana to be Next Base of Russian Troops 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
By allowing Russia to station troops in Cuba, the U.S. has
made a dangerous concession to the Communists which may soon
boomerang in our faces in British Guiana. Thus stated Fred C.
Schwarz, director of the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade, on
the ramifications of the Cuban crisis. Schwarz, whose address

yesterday was sponsored by the
Conservative Caucus of the Po
litical Union, prophesied that
British Guiana is the most likely
spot to harbor Russian troops in
the near future. He offered this
| possible sequence of events: 1)
British Guiana is granted inde
pendence by Britain; 2) The new
government, led by Communist
Prime Minister Cheddi Jagan,
signs a friendship treaty with the
Soviet Union; 3i Riots break out
in Georgetown, capital of British
Guiana, and Jagan, who only re
cently had to call on British
troops to break up unruly dem
j onstratlons in the city, asks Rus
| sia to send over a few thousand
jtroops to keep the peace "as a
' gesture of friendship.”
Thus, a beachhead will he es
| tabiished on the mainland of
South America. Next, the Com
munists will return to their typi
cal tactics of guerrilla warfare
and subversion with Brazil and
Venezuela being the principal
targets, Schwarz continued. This
operation, which is entirely con
ceivable under present circum
stances, will be just another ex
ample of the Communist strategy
for conquering the world by “en
circlement and demoralization,
leading to progressive surren
der,” he said.
According to Schwarz, the Cu
ban crisis is also an example of
this principal put in action.
"Khrushchev emerged from last
October’s crisis, a crisis of his
own making, as a man of moder
ation and peace,” he declared.
But this was only a bonus, for
he had also received from the
U.S. an unvoiced but implicit ac
ceptance of the status quo in
Cuba, which includes the presence
of Russian troops.
