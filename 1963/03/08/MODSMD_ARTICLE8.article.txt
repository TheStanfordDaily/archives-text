# Lackmann Foresees Christianity United In Wake of Council
## 
### SUE LINEHAN 
The Roman Catholic Church
seems on the verge of a new for
mulation of its concept of unity;
this was the impression which
Max Lackmann, leader of the
German Protestant Ecumenical
movement, received at the first
session of the Second Ecumeni
cal Conference In Rome.
Lackmann said that while the
first session held last fall, did
not produce any tangible results
towards unity, the spirit present
in the conference was “marvel
ous.” The Catholics, while never
consenting to give up completely
their privileges and beliefs, recog
nize that there is no limitation of
the power of the Holy Spirit to
any one group.
He feels that part of the diffi
culties surrounding church unity
is duo to the use of different
words to express the same ideas;
however, difference in semantics
does not mean separation in
truth. Lackmann feels that all in
all the Christian world has more
in common than apart, and that
there is a possibility of a real,
complete unity of Christianity.
He based some of his hope on
the way (he ecumenical fathers
conducted their business. He was
impressed by the freedom of
speech, which was “almost scru
pulously guarded.” He was sur
prised at the way in which the
Pope kept in the background, and
at the high place of importance
given the college of bishops.
The Catholics also indicated a
change in approach to the scrip
tural basis of religion. Lackmann
said “It is the Bible itself which
brings about the hope of unity of
Christians, even at the council,”
