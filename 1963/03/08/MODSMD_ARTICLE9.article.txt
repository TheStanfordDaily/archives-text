# Fairbanks: New Physics Looks at Life
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
"The Powers and Limitations of
Science” was the subject of the
"My Last Lecture” series speech
given yesterday in Trosidder by
Dr. William Fairbanks, professor
of physics.
Fairbanks began with a brief
recapitulation of the history of
scientific thought in an attempt
to determine the objectives of
scientific inquiry throughout the
iges. The Greeks of Plato’s acad
>my, ho stated, used astronomy
and physics to support Plato’s
view that the construction of the
universe was mathematically per
fect.

The science of the Middle Ages,
I ased on the philosophy of Aris-
I otle and the Scholastics, attempt
ed io explain the universe as a
creation of God to be used by men
to serve His will. Thus changes
I in scientific theory affected theol
ogy and philosophy as well.
The mechanical theory of the
universe, he continued, has been
replaced by the “efficient, cold”
quantum physics of the twentieth
century. The complex, all - inclu
i sive theories of this science have
| It'd many scientists to believe that
| physics is dead, that the future
j of science lies in the field of engi
j ncering. Fairbanks refuted this
| argument, stating that physics
has yet to explain the complexi
ties of living systems. The future
of physics, he feels, lies in this
field.
But science is limited in that it
provides no answer to the basic
questions of man’s purpose on
earth and of the meaning of his
life. For answers to these ques
tions it is necessary to turn to
the fields of ethics and, above all,
religion.
