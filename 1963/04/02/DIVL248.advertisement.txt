Come East Young Man
A Message to MBA Candidates
From Donald C. Cook, President
American Electric Power System
Many years ago Horace Greeley advised young men
to "Go West" to find new career opportunities. To
day, I urge you to investigate an unusual opportun
ity offered to outstanding MBA candidates by the
American Electric Power System to “Come East."
We offer a select group of young men the oppor
tunity to participate in a comprehensive two-year
management training program. Twelve months of
this training takes place in New York City.
Included in this program are rotating assignments
in accounting, finance and other functional areas.
Experience is gained from top executive staff contact.
I can assure you that as a participant in this
program, which is under my personal guidance, you
will have every opportunity to prepare for future
positions in management. Your salary will reflect
the high regard we hold for men of ability.
The American Electric Power System, through
its operating electric power companies, serves over
2,300 communities in a 7-state area from Michigan
to Virginia. AEP is recognized as a world pace set
ter in the generation, transmission and distribution
of electricity.
Mr. Harry Hergert (BS, U of California, MBA,
Harvard Business School) of our New York office
will visit your campus. As my personal representa
tive he will be pleased to meet with you and review
in more detail the various aspects of this program.
Please make your appointment through your place
ment office.
