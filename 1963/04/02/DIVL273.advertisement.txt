OVE MAKES STANFORD
GO ROUND
(Love for Uncle John s, that is)
And Uncle’s in a spin. What a welcome! Folks in
other towns have taken a fancy to Uncle John’s Pan
cake Houses, but never before has a town turned on a
welcome sign like Stanford.
During the first 20 days Uncle John flipped 240,000
pancakes, eggs, omelettes and hamburgers. So he’s in
the harness, mixing better batter to keep up with de
mand for his ever-lovin’ pancakes.
With Uncle John so busy mixing and making
delicious pancakes, he just can’t get around the town
to thank everybody. That’s why he says:
THANKS. STANFORD. WE LL KEEP WORKING
TO DESERVE YOUR CONTINUED PATRONAGE! -
