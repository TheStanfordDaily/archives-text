# Action by Board of Trustees Laudable and Welcome
## 
### 
The new policies issued by the Board of Trustees regard
ing student organizations are welcome and laudable. The
Trustees have approved the new ASSU constitution in time
for Spring elections, they have approved the use of Univer
sity facilities for student partisan and sectarian organiza
tions, and they have decided to permit voluntary student or
ganizations to make stands on public issues.
The new policy allows voluntary partisan and sectarian
organizations to make public their views on off-campus af
fairs, “providing any public statement made by the group
makes it clear that the group does not represent or speak for
the entire University or its student body.” The fact that sec
tarian and partisan student organizations will be allowed to
meet on campus and express their views is a significant step
forward. The presence of such groups on campus will be an
important stimulus to Stanford education by encouraging
students to become active and interested in off-campus af
fairs.
The new policy does not, however, allow the Associated
Students to take stands on off-campus issues, because “all
students are required to become members of the Associated
Students, which represents them with respect to student af
fairs on the Stanford campus.”
The policy statement issued by the Trustees further ex
plained their reluctance to let LASSU take stands on public
issues by stating: “The expressing of opinions or taking of
positions with respect to these matters is up to the individual
student or to volunteer groups of students so constituted that
they are authorized to speak for their members. This is not
a function of student government at Stanford.”
It is unfortunate that LASSU will not be allowed to take
stands on public issues. Other student legislatures across the
country arc allowed to take stands and LASSU, deprived of
this privilege, is denied a full part in the national student
community.
Although the Trustees’ action is not all that was hoped
for, it is a significant and welcome step forward. The hard
work of many members of the Stanford student community
has at last borne fruit. Their work and achievements are ap
preciated.
