## The 						Gamble on Foreign Aid 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The foreign aid program, which began with the Marshall
Plan in 1948, has always been a gamble, Has never been a sure
thing. In Europe, it has been a brilliant success. But 15 years ago,
nobody could know that it would be. In fact, such were the pov
erty and paralysis of France, Italy and Germany that there was
a serious possibility of a general collapse into communism. The
Marshall Plan was expensive. But because it worked, all would
agree today that it was cheap at the price.
Now we are concerned with foreign aid in this hemisphere.
The problem is not what it was in postwar Europe. There the
purpose of aid was to enable advanced and highly -developed
countries to recover from the world war. Our purpose in this
hemisphere is more complicated and difficult. Broadly speaking,
it is to help our neighbors achieve peaceably, and with liberty
if not with democracy, a revolution out of their semi-feudal past.
Our hope is that they will in fact achieve by progressive govern
ment what, failing that, their people will attempt to achieve by
revolutionary communism.
Knowing this, we are looking to the progressive govern
ments, as in Mexico, Costa Rico, Venezuela, Colombia and Bra
zil, to carry out the progressive revolutions which are the alter
native to the Castroite kind of revolution. It is, of course, a
gamble, and nothing is easier than to think up the many reasons
why it may be lost.
The biggest gamble in all our foreign aid in this hemisphere
is in Brazil. This is not only because Brazil is the biggest coun
try in Latin America and the geographical heart of the South-
American continent, but also because, in Brazil, there are the
biggest stakes to be won or lost.
If the progressive revolution fails in Brazil and the country
descends into revolutionary violence, the whole continent is cer
tain to become involved. It is possible more or less effectively
to contain the revolutionary influence of a small island like
Cuba. It would be a wholly different thing with a continental
mass like Brazil which has a common frontier with every coun
try in South America except two.
On the other hand, the prospects of success in Brazil are
bright and alluring. For while Brazil has its desperately poor
masses, it is not a primitive and undeveloped country. It has a
certain resemblance to Italy before its brilliant recovery when
there was desperate poverty and backwardness in the south and
high technical progress in the north. In Brazil, there are great
modern cities like Sao Paulo and Rio, and while the Brazilian
west is still being opened, it is empty like the American west in
the 19th century. It has no resemblance to the underdeveloped
and overpopulated parts of Asia and Africa.
If w r e study the agreement just worked out in Washington
between Brazilian Finance Minister Dantas and Mr. Bell, who
now manages foreign aid, we are bound to marvel at the po
litical courage of the Goulart government. To end the inflation
and to re-establish its international credit-worthiness, the Bra
zilian government has adopted a program which only a very
strong government, strong in its hold on popular support, would
dare to undertake.
The Goulart government is going to raise tax collections by
25 per cent. It has eliminated the subsidy of wheat, which has
doubled the price of bread. It has eliminated the subsidy of
petroleum products, which raised the price of gasoline 80 per
cent. It has increased commuter railroad fares five limes. It is
cutting down the expansion of bank credit to a third of what it
has been. It is freezing government employment and is trying
to freeze government pay.
It is an astonishing program. Let it is said that the Goulart
gvernment, which is left of center, is strong enough to carry out
the program. We must hope lhat it will be, and surely the admin
istration has been right in deciding to help it. For it would be
hard to name any item in our whole global for eign aid progr am
which, if it succeeds, will do so much good.

gamble, and nothing is easier than to think up the many reasons
why it may be lost.
The biggest gamble in all our foreign aid in this hemisphere
is in Brazil. This is not only because Brazil is the biggest coun
try in Latin America and the geographical heart of the South-
American continent, but also because, in Brazil, there are the
biggest stakes to be won or lost.
If the progressive revolution fails in Brazil and the country
descends into revolutionary violence, the whole continent is cer
tain to become involved. It is possible more or less effectively
to contain the revolutionary influence of a small island like
Cuba. It would be a wholly different thing with a continental
mass like Brazil which has a common frontier with every coun
try in South America except two.
On the other hand, the prospects of success in Brazil are
bright and alluring. For while Brazil has its desperately poor
masses, it is not a primitive and undeveloped country. It has a
certain resemblance to Italy before its brilliant recovery when
there was desperate poverty and backwardness in the south and
high technical progress in the north. In Brazil, there are great
modern cities like Sao Paulo and Rio, and while the Brazilian
west is still being opened, it is empty like the American west in
the 19th century. It has no resemblance to the underdeveloped
and overpopulated parts of Asia and Africa.
If w r e study the agreement just worked out in Washington
between Brazilian Finance Minister Dantas and Mr. Bell, who
now manages foreign aid, we are bound to marvel at the po
litical courage of the Goulart government. To end the inflation
and to re-establish its international credit-worthiness, the Bra
zilian government has adopted a program which only a very
strong government, strong in its hold on popular support, would
dare to undertake.
The Goulart government is going to raise tax collections by
25 per cent. It has eliminated the subsidy of wheat, which has
doubled the price of bread. It has eliminated the subsidy of
petroleum products, which raised the price of gasoline 80 per
cent. It has increased commuter railroad fares five limes. It is
cutting down the expansion of bank credit to a third of what it
has been. It is freezing government employment and is trying
to freeze government pay.
It is an astonishing program. Let it is said that the Goulart
gvernment, which is left of center, is strong enough to carry out
the program. We must hope lhat it will be, and surely the admin
istration has been right in deciding to help it. For it would be
hard to name any item in our whole global for eign aid progr am
which, if it succeeds, will do so much good.

The foreign aid program, which began with the Marshall
Plan in 1948, has always been a gamble, Has never been a sure
thing. In Europe, it has been a brilliant success. But 15 years ago,
nobody could know that it would be. In fact, such were the pov
erty and paralysis of France, Italy and Germany that there was
a serious possibility of a general collapse into communism. The
Marshall Plan was expensive. But because it worked, all would
agree today that it was cheap at the price.
Now we are concerned with foreign aid in this hemisphere.
The problem is not what it was in postwar Europe. There the
purpose of aid was to enable advanced and highly -developed
countries to recover from the world war. Our purpose in this
hemisphere is more complicated and difficult. Broadly speaking,
it is to help our neighbors achieve peaceably, and with liberty
if not with democracy, a revolution out of their semi-feudal past.
Our hope is that they will in fact achieve by progressive govern
ment what, failing that, their people will attempt to achieve by
revolutionary communism.
Knowing this, we are looking to the progressive govern
ments, as in Mexico, Costa Rico, Venezuela, Colombia and Bra
zil, to carry out the progressive revolutions which are the alter
native to the Castroite kind of revolution. It is, of course, a
gamble, and nothing is easier than to think up the many reasons
