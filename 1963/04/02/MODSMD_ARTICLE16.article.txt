Editors, The Daily:
We, Peace Caucus members, as part of the 190 signatories
of the following letter to President Sterling, declare that we
would be most happy to assist the University in the removal of
fallout shelter signs from the campus and to meet with mem
bers of the administration and faculty in order to discuss the
possibility of sponsoring informative activities and public de
bate on the issue of civil defense.
Steven Weisshlntli and 13 others
President Sterling:
We, the undersigned persons, believe that the presence
of fallout shelters in our society enhances the probability of
thermonuclear war in the following ways:
1. Fallout shelters reduce our will to find peaceful solu
tions to international conflict by lulling us into a false sense
of security regarding the chances for survival in a thermo
nuclear war.
2. Fallout shelters suggest to our adversaries that we
are seriously contemplating a first strike and are merely
seeking to minimize the destructiveness of the anticipated
retaliation.
3. Fallout shelters discourage the attitudes of coopera
tion and mutual aid and foster a selfish struggle for indi
vidual survival. i!; ' •' ■
Hence, we strongly urge you to take the following steps
toward abolishing fallout shelters on the Stanford University
campus:
1. Refuse to accept further federal funds for the de
velopment of additional proposed shelters.
2. Donate the emergency rations in the shelters to
either Food For Peace or CARE.
3. Suggest that federal funds for civil defense be turned
over to the federal Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
4. Remove all fallout shelter signs from the campus.
5. Aid and encourage research devoted to finding means
to the peaceful resolution of conflict and seek to correct all
misleading information regarding the efficacy of fallout
shelters.
Dear President Sterling:
In accordance with the action taken by the Associated Stu
dents of the University of Oregon Senate February 21, 1963,
1 forward to you a copy of that body’s resolution concerning
the recent controversy over the right of student groups to par
ticipate in partisan political activity in a university community.
The unanimous approval by our University’s student legislative
body of the resolution reaffirms, once again, the truth in the
statement that the loss of freedom to one individual or to any
group is a loss of freedom to all.
We encourage the Board of Trustees and the officials of
Stanford University to give careful consideration to the issue at
stake. Had Leland Stanford lived to witness the problems con
fronting our society in this decade I believe he would join with
us in encouraging universities everywhere to promote partisan
political activity. There is no alternative to adequate training
of the future leaders of our country. Such training cannot be ef
fective if minds are not challenged and if ideals must exist in
a vacuum. The students of the University of Oregon are plead
ing an important case. A four-year moratorium on partisan po
litical activity can insure nothing but mediocrity. Mediocrity
cannot be accepted by such a great University as Stanford.
Very sincerely yours,
Neil Goldschmidt, ASUO President
(Editors’ note: The following is the resolution submitted
by the Senate of the Associated Students of the University of
Oregon.)
WHEREAS, a University by its very nature is dedicated to
the free expression of ideas by faculty members and
students alike, and
WHEREAS, one function of student organizations is to pro
vide an outlet for the expression of student opinion, and,
WHEREAS, it is contrary to the ideals of a University for its
administrators to attempt to curtail the free expression
of ideas and opinions by student organizations and their
officers,
BE IT RESOLVED THAT we, the ASUO Senate, affirm the
right of Stanford student organizations and their offi
cers to be free from administrative control or censorship
in their expression of a position on any public issue.

officers,
BE IT RESOLVED THAT we, the ASUO Senate, affirm the
right of Stanford student organizations and their offi
cers to be free from administrative control or censorship
in their expression of a position on any public issue.
Editors, The Daily:
We, Peace Caucus members, as part of the 190 signatories
of the following letter to President Sterling, declare that we
would be most happy to assist the University in the removal of
fallout shelter signs from the campus and to meet with mem
bers of the administration and faculty in order to discuss the
possibility of sponsoring informative activities and public de
bate on the issue of civil defense.
Steven Weisshlntli and 13 others
President Sterling:
We, the undersigned persons, believe that the presence
of fallout shelters in our society enhances the probability of
thermonuclear war in the following ways:
1. Fallout shelters reduce our will to find peaceful solu
tions to international conflict by lulling us into a false sense
of security regarding the chances for survival in a thermo
nuclear war.
2. Fallout shelters suggest to our adversaries that we
are seriously contemplating a first strike and are merely
seeking to minimize the destructiveness of the anticipated
retaliation.
3. Fallout shelters discourage the attitudes of coopera
tion and mutual aid and foster a selfish struggle for indi
vidual survival. i!; ' •' ■
Hence, we strongly urge you to take the following steps
toward abolishing fallout shelters on the Stanford University
campus:
1. Refuse to accept further federal funds for the de
velopment of additional proposed shelters.
2. Donate the emergency rations in the shelters to
either Food For Peace or CARE.
3. Suggest that federal funds for civil defense be turned
over to the federal Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
4. Remove all fallout shelter signs from the campus.
5. Aid and encourage research devoted to finding means
to the peaceful resolution of conflict and seek to correct all
misleading information regarding the efficacy of fallout
shelters.
Dear President Sterling:
In accordance with the action taken by the Associated Stu
dents of the University of Oregon Senate February 21, 1963,
1 forward to you a copy of that body’s resolution concerning
the recent controversy over the right of student groups to par
ticipate in partisan political activity in a university community.
The unanimous approval by our University’s student legislative
body of the resolution reaffirms, once again, the truth in the
statement that the loss of freedom to one individual or to any
group is a loss of freedom to all.
We encourage the Board of Trustees and the officials of
Stanford University to give careful consideration to the issue at
stake. Had Leland Stanford lived to witness the problems con
fronting our society in this decade I believe he would join with
us in encouraging universities everywhere to promote partisan
political activity. There is no alternative to adequate training
of the future leaders of our country. Such training cannot be ef
fective if minds are not challenged and if ideals must exist in
a vacuum. The students of the University of Oregon are plead
ing an important case. A four-year moratorium on partisan po
litical activity can insure nothing but mediocrity. Mediocrity
cannot be accepted by such a great University as Stanford.
Very sincerely yours,
Neil Goldschmidt, ASUO President
(Editors’ note: The following is the resolution submitted

WHEREAS, a University by its very nature is dedicated to
the free expression of ideas by faculty members and
