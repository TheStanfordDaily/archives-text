# Government Stocks 18 Shelter Areas
## 
### 
Eighteen civil defense shelter
areas have been established on
the Stanford campus.
Marked by distinctive black and
yellow signs, tho shelters will ac
commodate more than 6800 per
sons. Locations for the shelters
offer the highest protection
against radiation factors.
Financed by the federal gov
ernment, the $50,000 project is
the first phase in a long-range
program. The “second phase" j
shelters, with a slightly lower i
protection, will accommodate an I
additional 5000 persons.
For each shelter the federal
government has provided first aid
supplies, radiological monitoring
equipment, water, and survival
biscuits. These supplies will .suf
fice for a two-week period.
The first 18 units are located
in the basements of Stern Hall,
Toyon Hall. Crothers Hall, En
eina Hall, School of Education,
Hoover Tower, Dinkelspiel Audi
torium, Law School, Chemistry
Building, Applied Electronics
Laboratories, High Energy Phys
ics Laboratory, and the eight
story apartment buildings now
under construction in Escondido
11.
The University's civil defense
system operates as part of the
county, state, and national or
ganization. Members of the Uni
versity staff, acting in Civil De- ■
tense capacities, are proceeding
with shelter management studies
and radiological monitoring tech
niques.
In case of military alert, the
following procedure should be ob
served:

TAKE ( OVER SIGNAL: Wail
ing tone on Fire House Siren or
short blast on Air Horn. Get into
shelter immediately. If no mark
ed shelter is available, take cover
in basement or first floor room,
inside hallway preferred. Shut
outside doors and windows.
ALERT SIGNAL: Steady blast
of 3-5 minutes. Don't use tele
phone. Tune AM radio to CONEL
IIAI) 1640-1240) for instructions.
IN CLASSROOM, the faculty
member in charge of class or lab
is the person responsible for car
rying out disaster procedure.
IN OFFICES Ol{ LIBRARIES,
heads of departments are respon
sible for carrying out disaster hi
st ructions.
IN DORMITORIES, the direc
tor of the hall has the responsi
bilities of the organization form
ed in the hall for disaster. Each
unit or wing organization is re
sponsible for carrying out its
duties.
ALL STUDENTS in dormito
ries, fraternities, or residences
are requested to report to then
place of residence as soon after
the disaster as possible.
Civil Defense also recommends
that persons keep a few emergen
cy supplies on hand and readily
available to carry to the nearest
shelter if necessary.
The fallout shelters do not re
quire special construction. Exist
ing basements and sheltered stor
age rooms are stocked with sur
vival supplies and are adequately
marked. For intelligent use the
location of the shelters must be
known and the rules for their use
must he followed.

HOOVER TOWER, housing detailed documents recording the past
relations of men and nations, has become an ominous sign pointing to possible relations in the future. One of Stanford's eighteen
new fallout shelters is set up in the basement: a storeroom stocked
with survival supplies. The supplies, donated by the federal government, include food, medical supplies and radiological monitoring equipment.

HOOVER TOWER, housing detailed documents recording the past
relations of men and nations, has become an ominous sign pointing to possible relations in the future. One of Stanford's eighteen
new fallout shelters is set up in the basement: a storeroom stocked
with survival supplies. The supplies, donated by the federal government, include food, medical supplies and radiological monitoring equipment.
Eighteen civil defense shelter
areas have been established on
the Stanford campus.
Marked by distinctive black and
yellow signs, tho shelters will ac
commodate more than 6800 per
sons. Locations for the shelters
offer the highest protection
against radiation factors.
Financed by the federal gov
ernment, the $50,000 project is
the first phase in a long-range
program. The “second phase" j
shelters, with a slightly lower i
protection, will accommodate an I
additional 5000 persons.
For each shelter the federal
government has provided first aid
supplies, radiological monitoring
equipment, water, and survival
biscuits. These supplies will .suf
fice for a two-week period.
The first 18 units are located
in the basements of Stern Hall,
Toyon Hall. Crothers Hall, En
eina Hall, School of Education,
Hoover Tower, Dinkelspiel Audi
torium, Law School, Chemistry
Building, Applied Electronics
Laboratories, High Energy Phys
ics Laboratory, and the eight
story apartment buildings now
under construction in Escondido
11.
The University's civil defense
system operates as part of the
county, state, and national or
ganization. Members of the Uni
versity staff, acting in Civil De- ■
tense capacities, are proceeding
with shelter management studies
and radiological monitoring tech
niques.
In case of military alert, the
following procedure should be ob
served:

TAKE ( OVER SIGNAL: Wail
ing tone on Fire House Siren or
short blast on Air Horn. Get into
shelter immediately. If no mark
ed shelter is available, take cover
in basement or first floor room,
inside hallway preferred. Shut
outside doors and windows.
ALERT SIGNAL: Steady blast
of 3-5 minutes. Don't use tele
phone. Tune AM radio to CONEL
IIAI) 1640-1240) for instructions.
IN CLASSROOM, the faculty
member in charge of class or lab
