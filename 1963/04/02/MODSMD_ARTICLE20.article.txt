# Cagers Collapse in Last Games; Tom Dose Sets Scoring Mark
## 
### ROGER MENDELSON 
The 1962-63 AAWU basketball
season ended in an exact replay
of last year’s National League
finish- except for one change:
the Southland beat the Bay Area
this time.
Just as the Dodgers backed into
a tie last September for the
championship which they had vir
tually clinched with a week left,
the Stanford Indians blew a two
game lead in the last week of
play this March.
And just as the Giants caught
up to tie on the last day of the

season and went on to win the NL
playoff series, the UCLA Bruins
came on to force a playoff game
and won it to become the
AAWU’s representative to the
NCAA tournament.
STANFORD came out a little
bit better from its tie than did
Los Angeles, however. Although
they lost the playoff, the Indians
are still the official co-champions
of the AAWU whereas the
Dodgers dropped from the tie to
mere runners-up.
This co-championship, a rather
dubious honor for the Indians in

1 1 light of their expectations prior
; I to and right up to end of the sea
■ | son, is the greatest achievement
. for a Stanford basketball team
' I since the national championship
squad of 1942. It is also the near
est thing to a league champion
ship in a major sport for any
Stanford team since the Rose
| Bowl squad of 1951.
THE INDIANS’ best chance to
clinch the title for which they
seemed destined came during the
last game of the season against
| USC in Los Angeles. The previous
night a surprisingly aggressive
UCLA defense had disintegrated
Stanford's normal composure and
provoked 24 ball control errors;
I these misplays more than com
! pensated for 31- and 16-point per
formances by Tom Dose and
Clayton Raaka respectively, and
Stanford had lost to UCLA, 64-54.
But with revenge (SC had
| beaten Stanford two out of three
j games previously) and the
I AAWU championship as motives,
the Indians came back and led
SC comfortably—until five and
a half minutes remained. At that
point, Dose fouled out, and the
Trojans methodically diminished
| a seven-point margin. However,
Stanford still had the ball and a
two-point lead with only 30 sec
onds left. But a pass went awry,
i SC quickly found an opening for
a game-tying layup, and easily
| outscored the offense-less Indi
ans, 8-2, in the overtime. The fi
j nal score was 67-61, and Stanford
had only half of the league title.
THE INDIAN BRUIN playoff
was nearly no-contest after the
first ten minutes. UCLA’s great
est lead was 13 points, but worse
; than that, Stanford’s shooting
was so inconsistent thit the In
| dians stood little chance of mak
ing a comeback in the game.
They closed to 35-40 with about
| seven minutes left, but the
i Bruins drew away and coasted in
to a 51-45 win and the right to
play at Provo. Utah. (They didn’t
last long there as Arizona State
shot 65 per cent in the first half
against them for a 31-point lead,
and the Bruins were blitzed, 93-
| 79..
In the closing minutes of the
Indian-Bruin playoff. Dose scored
seven points, bringing his 25-
! game total to 520, a new Stan
ford record for a single season.
He broke Ron Tomsic’s 19.53 mark
j of 515 points in 27 games, and
I also became (he first Stanford
player to average twenty points
for an entire season. His two-year
scoring total is now 962, seventh
among all-time Stanford players.
DOSE was named to several all-
West Coast teams, and along with
senior guard Don Clemetson, was
selected for the all-AAWU team.
Stanford loses only three play
ers from the top ten via gradu
ation. They are Clemetson, Dar
rell Sutherland, and Bob Som
mers. Four starters. Dose, Raaka,
Hollis Moore, and Kent Hinckley,
| return for the 1963-63 season.
